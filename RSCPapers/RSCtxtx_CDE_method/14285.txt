Solution-processed bathocuproine (BCP) has been widely used in fullerene (FA)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades as an electron transport layer (ETL). However, it has not emerged for use in non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based OSCs due to the interfacial chemical interaction between the NFA and BCP, leading to poor device performance. Herein, newly synthesized amine-functionalized bathocuproine (BCPN) is successfully applied as an electron transport layer (ETL) in NFA based OSCs (PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-ec9) for the first time with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.5% and 16.7%, respectively. Nonencapsulated OSCs based on PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-ec9 built using BCPN demonstrate substantially improved photostability (T80 ∼ 140 and 100 hours, respectively) compared to both control devices built using BCP (T80 ∼ 1 hour) under continuous photoirradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The improvement in photostability is primarily attributed to the prevention of the breakage of the conjugated bond in the NFAs (Y6 and BTP-eC9). This is verified by the observation that the surface morphology of BCPN on the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer is retained, whereas that of BCP on the BHJ layer is completely degraded, leading to an inferior photostability for OSCs. Moreover, we further explored the behaviour of charge extraction property in the NFA based OSCs built using BCPN and BCP as a function of photoirradiation time. It also preserves the charge extraction property in the NFA based OSCs built using BCPN. Thus, our approach demonstrates that the amination of the BCP moiety (BCPN) affords a desirable ETL material for improving the photostability of OSCs based on NFAs without sacrificing the PCE.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) comprising electron donors and electron acceptors are used to achieve a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% for single-junction devices. This dramatic improvement in PCE opens-up a bright future for OSCs. Because of their specific features, such as low-cost production, light weight, and flexibility, OSCs have been regarded as next-generation technology for portable and wearable photovoltaics. The high level of PCE in OSCs is attributed to the development of a new class of electron-accepting materials: non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Specifically, a combination of the PM6 donor and derivatives of the Y6 acceptor can result in a high PCE due to their broad absorption spectrum ranging from the visible to near-infrared regions, which can lead to a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and reduced nonradiative recombination and minimized voltage losses with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc).

Despite these excellent advantages of OSCs based on NFAs, they suffer from significant instability in device performance under continuous photoirradiation, which induces both thermal stress and a photochemical reaction at the BHJ layer/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. These external stimuli induce a change in the microscale morphology of the BHJ layer and the number of light-induced traps in the BHJ layer, which deteriorate the device performance including the efficiency and stability of the OSCs. Therefore, the addition of a third component (e.g., phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM, or other NFAs) into binary systems based on NFAs (called the “ternary system”) has been used to reduce the number of light-induced traps in BHJ films with more desirable morphologies between donor and acceptor materials under photoirradiation. However, this strategy requires the use of a delicate fabrication approach to form uniform films. Alternatively, the introduction of an ETL at the interface between the BHJ and cathode/anode (“interfacial engineering”) is a simple approach for achieving excellent device performance. This removes the undesired charge accumulation at the interface via the formation of an ohmic contact at the interface, which is enabled by modifying the electronic structure of the cathode/anode, thus enhancing the device performance of OSCs. Over a period of decade years, several organic-based ETL materials, such as polyethylenimine (PEI), ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE), and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), have been reported for OSCs based on fullerene acceptors (FAs), which show excellent device performance. However, for OSCs based on NFAs, recent studies have indicated that PEI and PEIE chemically react with NFAs to decompose the BHJ layer, resulting in poor stability under continuous photoirradiation, even under inert atmospheric conditions. Therefore, it is important to develop a substituting ETL material that can be used to improve the stability of OSCs based on NFAs without sacrificing the PCE.
Recently, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) (PDIN and PDINO, which are PDI-bearing amino groups and amino N-oxide groups, respectively) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives have been reported to improve the device performance. This is attributed to not only the thickness-independent property of the ETL but also the presence of a secondary amine as the side chain in PDINN leading to hydrogen bonding with the NFA molecule. However, for practical applications, PDIs have several limitations, such as poor work function (WF) tunability and limited stability (only storage stability). Therefore, it is still challenging to develop ETL materials that can be used to improve the stability of OSCs based on NFAs under such harsh conditions, including continuous photoirradiation or thermal stress. Alternatively, bathocuproine (BCP) molecules are widely used in the field of OSC based FAs and perovskite solar cells (PVSKs) as an ETL due to their excellent charge-carrier transport and extraction abilities, which can be ascribed to their hole blocking function and the elimination of charge accumulation at the interface between the BHJ layer and metal electrode. However, they are only applied to OSCs based on FAs because the chemical interaction between BCP and NFAs induces a deterioration of the BHJ layer, resulting in poor device efficiency and stability. Therefore, preventing the chemical reaction between the BHJ layer and BCP molecule is a key factor for applying BCP as an ETL to OSCs based on NFAs with improved photostability as well as potential uses.
In this work, we demonstrate photostable OSCs based on NFAs by the simple introduction of an amine-modified BCP (hereafter BCPN) as an ETL material. Under continuous photoirradiation of 1 sun in a nitrogen atmosphere, a non-encapsulated OSC (PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-eC9) built using BCPN exhibits enhanced photostability over 140 and 100 hours, respectively, (retaining approximately 80% of its initial efficiency, T80), while both control devices built using BCP show a dramatic decrease in PCE within 1 hour (T80). This is attributed to BCPN dramatically preventing the photoinduced chemical interaction from inducing a morphological change in the ETL on top of the BHJ film. In addition, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements also show that the charge extraction time (τ) for OSCs built using BCPN is maintained even after the photoirradiation time, while a significant increase in τ is observed for OSCs built using BCP. Furthermore, by forming the dipole layer at the BCPN/cathode interface, the modified work function (WF) of the cathode leads to a slightly increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), yielding a high PCE of 15.5% (for PM6:Y6) and 16.7% (for PM6:BTP-eC9).


Fig. 1(a) presents the device structure used in this work. The normal structure of OSCs is fabricated with the device configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (∼40 nm)/BHJ layer (∼100 nm)/ETL (∼5 nm, BCP or BCPN)/Ag (∼100 nm). PEDOT:PSS was used as the hole transport layer (HTL). The chemical structures of the ETL materials (BCP and BCPN) used here are presented in Fig. 1(b). The details of the synthesis method and characterization of BCPN are summarized in the Experimental section and Fig. S1.Fig. 1(c) shows the chemical structures of the photoactive materials used in this work: PM6 (donor), Y6 and BTP-eC9 (NFAs). The optimized concentration of BCP or BCPN in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solvent was 0.5 mg ml−1, and these solutions were spin-coated on top of the BHJ layer with an approximate thickness of ∼5 nm. The OSCs based on PM6:Y6 built using BCP show a PCE of 15.28% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. A slightly increased performance is also obtained in the OSC built using BCPN; a PCE of 15.49%, a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 24.0 mA cm−2, and FF of 77.6%. For the case of PM6:BTP-eC9 OSCs built using BCP, we obtained a PCE of 16.50% with a Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 24.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 80.0%, whereas the OSC built using BCPN shows a slightly higher PCE of 16.70% with an enhanced Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 24.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 80.3%. The Jsc (Jcal) values calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra agree well with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves (Fig. S2), with an error of less than 1%. The obtained PCE is consistent with recent publications. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. 1(d) and (e) and Table 1. A histogram of the PCEs for a population of 10 independent devices is shown in Fig. 1f and g, which shows a narrower distribution for the OSCs built using BCPN.

To identify the mechanism for the observed increase in both Jsc and FF for OSCs built using BCPN, we conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for the BCP/Ag, BCPN/Ag and Ag electrodes. As shown in Fig. 2(a), after employing BCP and BCPN as the ETL, the binding energy (BE) of the Ag electrode shifts toward higher energy from 16.66 eV to 17.15 eV and 17.33 eV, respectively; the WF for the BCP/Ag, BCPN/Ag and Ag electrodes is calculated to be −4.05 eV, −3.87 eV and −4.54 eV, respectively (see Fig. 2(b)). It is noticeable that BCPN/Ag exhibits a lower WF value than the BCP/Ag electrode, implying that the electron transfer from the lone pair of tertiary amines to the metal electrode occurs at this interface, thereby forming a dipole moment at the interface. This is also confirmed by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) for the BCP or BCPN/Ag film. As shown in Fig. S3, the Ag 3d binding energy shifts toward a lower energy from 368.23 eV to 367.80 eV (for BCP) and 367.61 eV (for BCPN), which can be attributed to the strong binding interaction between Ag and the amine functional group. The above two experiments indicate that the enhanced dipole moment at the ETL/Ag interface due to attachment of the amine functional group of the BCP (BCPN) leads to lower binding energy. Therefore, the slightly higher Jsc and FF of the OSC built using BCPN can be attributed to better charge-carrier extraction or transport from the BHJ layer to the Ag electrode by lowering the energetic barrier at the interfaces. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also confirms that the replacement of BCP with BCPN leads to a slight enhancement of the charge transport at the BHJ/Ag electrode interface, supporting an improvement in the PCE of OSCs built using BCPN (see Fig. 2(c) and (d)).
The photostability of OSCs with ETLs (BCP and BCPN) was tested by tracking the J–V curves measured for OSCs under continuous photoirradiation with 1 sun (100 mW cm−2 intensity with a UV cut-off filter in N2 gas, without encapsulation). As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the OSC built using BCPN (PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-eC9) shows enhanced photostability with T80 (time for maintaining 80% of the initial efficiency) over 140 and 100 hours, respectively, compared to both OSCs built using BCP (T80 < 1 hour). The other photovoltaic parameters, such as Voc, Jsc, and FF, corresponding to OSC devices built with and without BCP or BCPN are presented in Fig. S4. It is noticeable that the fast decay in the PCE observed for the OSC built using BCP with increasing photoirradiation time is mainly dominated by a decrease in all the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF), which is consistent with a recent publication. Surprisingly, after replacing the ETL with BCPN, a small degradation is observed at early times within 20 hours for Jsc and FF with a negligible variation in Voc. Since this photostability test was performed in a closed system (in a moisture-free and oxygen-free N2 gas environment), we can rule out degradation due to moisture or oxygen, thus inferring that the degradation of the BHJ layer is mainly related to the different roles of ETLs at the BHJ/ETL interface.
To identify the reason for the different behaviour observed for OSCs with ETLs in the photostability test, we primarily investigated the surface morphology of BHJ/ETL films. Fig. 4(a) shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of BHJ films with BCP or BCPN before and after 48 hours photoirradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), which is the same experimental condition for photostability measurements. Note that several spherical features are observed for the BHJ/BCP film, which is observed to be slightly enlarged for the BHJ/BCPN film. Since the pristine BHJ film shows no such features (see Fig. S5), the spherical feature is attributed to the presence of BCP or BCPN molecules. Interestingly, after photoirradiation, the spherical features in the BHJ/BCP films disappear, whereas no significant change is observed for the BHJ/BCPN films. This result indicates that the improved photostability of the OSC built using BCPN is strongly related to the different behaviour at the BHJ/ETL interface under photoirradiation. Since the chemical reaction between NFAs and BCP molecules degrades NFAs, leading to poor OSC device performance, as reported previously, the appearance of BCP molecules in the AFM image of the BHJ/BCP film after photoirradiation can be interpreted as being due to the diffusion of BCP molecules into the BHJ layer. In contrast, the diffusion of BCPN molecules into the BHJ layer is prevented in the BHJ/BCPN film. This finding is more clearly observed from water contact angle (WCA) measurements for both as-cast BHJ (PM6:Y6) films and photoaged BHJ films incorporating BCP or BCPN. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the WCAs for the as-cast BHJ film with BCP and BCPN are measured to be 85.14° and 74.06°, respectively. Considering that the WCA for the PM6:Y6 BHJ film without the ETL is 102.99°, representing a hydrophobic surface, these results indicate that the surface of the BHJ/ETL films is relatively less hydrophobic. We also note that the BHJ film with BCPN shows a more hydrophilic surface than the BHJ film with BCP, indicating that the presence of amine functional groups on the BCP core molecule contributes to a conversion of the surface property. This is pronounced in the results of WCA obtained for the samples after photoirradiation. The WCA for the BHJ film with BCP becomes 91.49° after photoirradiation for 6 hours, indicating that the degradation of the BCP layer on top of the BHJ film is enabled by diffusing the BCP molecules into the BHJ film. In contrast, the BHJ film with BCPN shows no significant change in the WCA (73.27°) even after photoirradiation. We infer that the preservation of surface properties in BHJ/BCPN can be attributed to the hydrophilicity of the amine functional group of BCPN preventing the diffusion of BCPN molecules into the BHJ layer.
To clarify the different behaviour of ETLs (BCP and BCPN) on top of the BHJ layer under photoirradiation, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra for films with a configuration of ITO/PM6:Y6/BCP and ITO/PM6:Y6/BCPN. Fig. S6 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra for these films before and after photoirradiation (0, 2, 7 hours). The peak observed at approximately 600 nm can be assigned to the π–π* absorption of PM6, while the characteristic Y6 peak is observed at approximately 800 nm. All spectra are normalized for the PM6 main absorption peak (∼600 nm). Note that the intensity of the absorption peak measured at approximately 800 nm is decreased with increasing photoirradiation time (both for BHJ/BCP and BHJ/BCPN films). This observation indicates that the PM6:Y6 blend ratio in the local region is slightly changed. Since long-term photoirradiation frequently induces thermal stress in BHJ films, the observed change in the PM6:Y6 blend ratio can be attributed to thermal stress-induced morphological changes. Meanwhile, for the BHJ/BCP film, it is noticeable that the Y6 peak position (∼800 nm) is slightly blue-shifted with increasing photoirradiation time, while no change in the peak position is observed for the BHJ/BCPN film. Since the blue-shift in the absorption spectra implies a deaggregation of Y6, we attribute this observation to the diffusion of BCP molecules into Y6 molecules. However, for the BHJ/BCPN film, the peaks observed at approximately 800 nm are similar, indicating that the diffusion of BCPN molecules into the BHJ film is prevented, which agrees well with the findings from the AFM images.
To further verify the enhanced photostability of OSCs built using BCPN, we performed transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements for OSCs built using BCP and BCPN with increasing photoirradiation time, which can be used to examine the charge dynamics at the BHJ/ETL interface (e.g., the charge extraction from the BHJ layer to ETL). The TPC measurements for the OSCs were performed for different photoirradiation times (from 0 to 100 hours). As shown in Fig. 5 (a), PM6:Y6 OSCs built using BCP exhibit an increased charge extraction time (τ) (from 283.5 to 760.9 ns) with increasing exposure time (0, 2, 4, 8 hours). Similar behaviour is also obtained for a PM6:BTP-eC9 OSC built using BCP; the τ value is increased from 230 to 1520 ns with increasing exposure time from 0 to 48 hours (Fig. 5(c)). In contrast, no significant change in the τ value for OSCs based on PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-eC9 built using BCPN is observed (Fig. 5(b) and (d)). Therefore, we attribute the observed degradation in PCE for OSCs built using BCP with increasing photoirradiation time to the interaction between BCP and NFAs in the BHJ layer, which leads to increased non-radiative recombination at the BHJ/BCP interface. In contrast, the enhanced photostability of the OSC with BCPN can be attributed to the hindrance of the interaction between NFA and the BCP molecule due to the attachment of the amine functional group on the BCP molecule, as observed in the AFM images.
Finally, we compared the PCE measured for OSCs built using different ETLs with various device active areas from 4 to 100 mm2. Although both devices built using BCP and BCPN show a decrease in PCE with increasing active area, as expected, the OSCs with BCPN show a relatively higher PCE value for a large-area device compared to the OSC with BCP (Fig. 6 and Table S1). In addition, we also examined the photostability of the large-area OSCs. As shown in Fig. S7, after 10 hours, the large-area OSC (100 mm2) built using BCPN retains 68% of the initial efficiency, while a significant reduction in PCE is observed within 1 hour for the OSC built using BCP.

In conclusion, we fabricated highly photostable OSCs based on NFAs by introducing a newly synthesized BCP derivative, BCPN. The amino-functionalized alkyl chain of BCPN effectively reduces the WF of the Ag electrode by forming a dipole moment, thus enhancing the charge-carrier extraction from the BHJ layer to the cathode. Furthermore, the hydrophilicity induced by the attached side chains inhibits the chemical interaction between NFA and BCP, showing a stable surface morphology for BCPN molecules on the BHJ layer after photoirradiation. Therefore, the replacement of ETL from BCP to BCPN effectively prevents interfacial charge accumulation at the BHJ/ETL interface even after photoirradiation, which is confirmed in the TPC measurement. As a result, the optimized OSCs built using BCPN, fabricated with PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-eC9, exhibit high PCEs of 15.5% and 16.7%, with impressive FFs of up to 77.6% and 80.3%, respectively. In addition, we observe excellent photostability for an OSC built using BCPN; 80% of the initial efficiency is retained after 100 hours (T80 ∼ 140 for PM6:Y6 and 100 hours for PM6:BTP-eC9). In contrast, an OSC built using BCP exhibits a short T80 of less than 1 hour. This excellent photostability is also observed for a large-area OSC built using BCPN. Our results show that aminated BCP materials can greatly impact device efficiency and stability, which is a prerequisite that OSCs must meet before they are commercially accepted.

PEDOT:PSS (Celvios PVP AI 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. PM6 and Y6 for PM6:Y6-based devices were purchased from 1-Materials Inc. PM6 and BTP-eC9 for PM6:BTP-eC9-based devices were purchased from Solamer Materials Inc. Bathocuproine (BCP) (96%), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), chloroform (CF) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 1-Chloronaphthalene (1-CN) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.


BCP and BCPN solutions were prepared by dissolving in IPA at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1. The PM6:Y6 (D:A = 1:1, by weight) solution was prepared by dissolving in chloroform (CF) at a concentration of 12 mg ml−1 and adding 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive. PM6:BTP-eC9 (D:A = 1:1.2, by weight) solution was prepared by dissolving in chloroform (CF) at a concentration of 16.5 mg ml−1 and adding 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive.


The organic solar cell devices based on PM6:Y6 were fabricated with a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/BCPN/Ag. First, the prepatterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned using the following procedure; the substrates were swabbed with detergent and then sonicated in DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each. PEDOT:PSS solution was spun onto the ITO substrates at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s after the substrates were exposed to UV-ozone for 20 min. Subsequently, PEDOT:PSS films were baked at 150 °C for 15 min by using a hotplate. The active solutions were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to obtain films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. Subsequently, the films were annealed at 75 °C for 5 min (for PM6:Y6) or at 80 °C for 10 min (for PM6:BTP-eC9). The BCP or BCPN was spin-coated onto the active layers for use as a charge transport layer (ETL) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick Ag layer was thermally evaporated onto the ETL through a shadow mask. The area of the mask was 0.12 cm2.


The J–V characteristics for devices with an aperture area of 0.05 cm2 were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a Keithley 2420 source measuring unit and solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A 450W, Newport). The intensity of the solar spectrum was calibrated using a calibrated standard silicon reference cell with a KG5 filter (Model 91150V, Newport). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were obtained using an ORIEL QuantX 300 (Newport). The calibration for the EQE measurements was performed using a silicon detector calibrated by Newport. The photostability tests were conducted using a xenon-arc lamp (AM 1.5 G filtered) in a N2-filled chamber. The devices were swept from −0.2 V to 1.0 V every 10 minutes. Through N2 blowing, the temperature of the devices was kept at approximately 20 °C during the stability test. The surface topographies of the films were characterized utilizing AFM XE-100 (Park Systems, Inc.) in tapping mode. A PPP-NCHR 10M AFM cantilever was used at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out using a Nexsa XPS system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.). The ultraviolet discharge lamp was used as an excitation source (He I, 21.22 eV) with a binding energy resolution of 0.05 eV. The spectrometer was calibrated using a cleaned silver (Ag) reference standard. The base pressure of the sample analysis chamber for measurement was maintained below 2 × 10−7 Torr. 1H/13C NMR was recorded using a Varian Gemini-300 spectrometer. TGA was performed with an SDT Q600 instrument in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to a temperature of 600 °C. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Carry 5000). The frequency response analyzer (FRA) system of AUTOLAB equipment was utilized to conduct electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for the devices. The EIS measurement was performed in potentiostatic mode under applied open-circuit conditions (with frequencies ranging between 50 Hz and 1 MHz) and under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 in a N2-filled box. Transient photocurrent (TPC) was acquired using an oscilloscope (Waverunner 625Zi, Teledyne LECROY) coupled with a 470 nm picosecond laser (P-C-470, PicoQuant GmbH) as the excitation source. For TPC measurements, the input impedance of the oscilloscope was set to 50 Ω, and then the sample was exposed to an excitation pulse laser with a repetition rate of 100 kHz. The TPC decays were obtained by averaging over 20000 measurements for each sample.
