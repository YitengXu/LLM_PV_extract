Recently, squaraine (SQ) dyes used as donor materials in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have received increasing attention because of their simple synthetic routes, high absorption coefficients with tunable bandgaps and bandwidths in the visible-near infrared region, as well as high photochemical and thermal stabilities. Using fullerenes or their derivatives as electron accepting materials, SQ:fullerene-based OPV devices have shown power conversion efficiencies as high as over 8%, which indicates the potential of SQ dyes for future solar cell applications. In this review, we briefly introduce the history of this group of materials, and present recent advances in SQ dye materials and their applications to OPV cells, including the major methodologies employed to exploit the full potential of these molecules as light harvesting materials in OPV devices. From the perspective of the current status of this field, we provide an overview of the primary issues affecting future development of OPV, as well as possible solutions.

Solar energy is an abundant and clean energy source, which represents a primary candidate for renewable energy. The abiding problem associated with this energy source has been in the development of a viable means of converting this energy into a form that can be easily used. In this regard, photovoltaic (PV) cells, which directly convert solar energy into electricity, have been well established as a promising long-term solution for harvesting solar energy. Currently, Si-based solar panels dominate the market with a share of over 90%, whereas thin film products represent a small minority. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are a third-generation PV technology, which utilizes organic semiconductor materials to absorb solar light and to convert photons into free charge carriers. This technology has attracted increasing attention owing to its relatively simple processing requirements and the potential for fabricating light-weight, large-area flexible solar panels. These features make OPV technology an attractive alternative to traditional inorganic solar cells. For efficient charge generation, donor–acceptor systems are necessary to overcome the strong exciton binding energy. While fullerenes and their derivatives form the mainstream of electron accepting materials, many types of organic molecules, including both small molecular weight materials and polymers, have been used as electron donors. Polymer-based OPV cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10%. Simultaneously, OPV cells based on small molecules have also been developed because of their numerous advantages, including facile material synthesis and purification, as well as easily tunable molecular structures and energy levels. The PCEs of these devices have already attained values as high as 10% for both single junction and tandem cells. While the PCEs of OPV cells have been improving, further improvement in OPV performance is necessary.

Common approaches to boost OPV performance can be organized into the following five categories: (i) tuning the bandgap of photoactive materials for better matching with the solar spectrum; (ii) using very thin films of less than 100 nm thickness with high absorption coefficients so that they can completely absorb the incident light; (iii) deepening the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the donor materials for an increased open circuit voltage (Voc); (iv) modulating molecular interactions for optimal film morphology, and thus optimal charge transport; (v) constructing ohmic contacts comprising metal electrodes with photoactive layers for sufficient built-in potential and efficient charge collection. Squaraine (SQ) dyes belong to a material family that coordinates very well with these different approaches.
SQ dyes were firstly synthesized in the 1960s. The compounds are 1,3-disubstituted squaric acid derivatives containing an electron-deficient central four-membered ring and two electron-donating groups in a donor–acceptor–donor configuration in which a π-conjugated resonance structure helps stabilize the molecule. The very dense electron distribution on the central ring imparts a very high absorption coefficient of approximately 105 cm−1 to these molecules, which exceeds that of all but a small number of organic semiconductor molecules. In the last 30 years, SQ dyes have attracted considerable interest because of their intense light absorption and less pronounced fluorescence emission for potential applications in various fields.
Owing to the strong light absorption properties of SQ molecules, SQ dyes have been applied for light harvesting. For example, Yum et al. used an asymmetric SQ molecule as an absorber in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and reasonable PV performance with a PCE of 4.5% was obtained. However, the efficiency was severely limited by a narrow absorption band and a relatively low Voc. SQ dyes normally exhibit a photoresponse only in the spectral range of 500–700 nm, and the metal oxide layer, e.g., the TiO2 photoanode, provides little contribution to the photocurrent generation. In addition, the reported Voc is approximately 0.6 V, much smaller than the bandgap (1.7 eV) of the SQ absorption material, which is subject to the work function difference between TiO2 and the I−/I3− electrolyte. In addition to the limitations associated with the narrow absorption band and low Voc, SQ molecules tend to aggregate, which is also harmful to the PV conversion process in the DSSC device architecture. It is worth noting that further modification of asymmetric structures of SQ dyes enables significant enhancement in the PV performance in the DSSC structure, reaching a PCE of over 8%. The significant improvement is ascribed to either the rational design of the π-conjugated system or spatial arrangements of solubilizing groups. Though the aggregation behaviors do not favor PV conversion in DSSC, we will see in this review that such aggregation behaviors can be beneficial to SQ:fullerene-based OPV cells.
SQ dyes have also been considered as promising donor materials for OPV cells. Their unique properties meet the basic requirements for OPV materials. Several examples are given as follows: (i) the high absorption coefficient (approximately 105 cm−1) of SQ dyes affords the use of thinner photoactive films, which may facilitate charge transport in the OPV device; (ii) because of the intermolecular interaction and aggregation, the absorption spectra of SQ dyes in a solid-state film are broadened and red-shifted to the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range relative to those in the solution phase making SQ dyes more efficient light harvesting materials. The aggregation behaviors are also very sensitive in processing parameters that offer an opportunity to finely tune the film morphologies of SQ materials, and thereby utilize optimal correlations between morphology and charge recombination behaviors; (iii) the bandgaps of SQ dyes can be tailored through molecular design, ranging from 2.5 to 1.6 eV; (iv) the proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO levels can be easily tuned to match well with the fullerene acceptor, ensuring both efficient charge separation and a large Voc. It has been recognized that fullerene derivatives used as acceptor materials in OPV cells have complementary absorption in the blue and green regions, and thus the combination of SQ dyes and fullerenes covers the entire visible and NIR spectral range.
From a synthetic perspective, SQ dyes have superior advantages compared with other donor polymers and oligomers. In general, the polymers and oligomers used as donor materials in OPV cells are prepared via a multistep palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction that typically employs metal-catalysts, phosphine ligands, and halogenated and toxic metal-containing compounds. Consequently, a considerable amount of by-products and residual catalysts/ligands remain in the final products, which require purification because the contaminants generally have a negative influence on or may even change the optoelectronic properties of the target products. The relative advantages of SQ materials are follows: (i) facile preparation occurs via a condensation reaction between electron-rich aromatic amines and squaric acid, and thus the by-product is only water, which is easily removed via distillation; (ii) expensive and hardly separable metal-catalysts and ligands are not required in the final reaction; (iii) easy separation and purification from the reaction mixture. Therefore, synthesis is practical on a large scale and amenable to extension for the production of large numbers of related compounds. These fascinating features make SQ materials an attractive donor for OPV cells. Although SQ molecules have been applied as light absorbing dyes in DSSC, in this review, we focused on recent developments of SQ dyes and SQ-based OPV devices, covering the topics of molecular design and OPV cell design, discussing the impacts of molecular packing and film morphology, and examining the various strategies employed to achieve high OPV performance.


Fig. 1 presents PCE data from various reported studies representing the important milestones in the development of SQ dye-based OPV cells. As shown, the PCE was very low at approximately 0.02% for the first SQ-based OPV device developed in 1976. However, since the time when the p–n junction OPV device structure was first reported by Tang in 1986 (ref. 25) and fullerene C60 was first determined to be an efficient acceptor material by Sariciftci et al. in 1992, OPV cell research has achieved rapid progress in the fundamental understanding of the mechanism, new material exploration, device physics, and morphology and interface engineering. By introducing an n-type fullerene as an electron acceptor into the SQ dye system, significant progress has been achieved in SQ dye-based OPV research (Table 1). The 1% PCE barrier was broken by Silvestri et al. in 2008. With further development of device engineering and material exploitation, the PCE dramatically jumped to 3.2% in 2009 for a planar heterojunction (PHJ) device reported by Wang and coworkers, followed by PCEs of 4.6% in 2010 (ref. 29) and 5.2% in 2011 (ref. 30) by Wei et al. In April 2012, Chen et al. reported a PCE of 6.1% for a vacuum co-evaporated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV device. In August 2012, Lassiter et al. reported a PCE of 6.6% for an SQ:fullerene-based OPV system with a tandem structure. Shortly thereafter, in 2013, a PCE of 8.3% was achieved. The sharp rise in the PCEs of OPV devices from 2008 to 2013 indicates that SQ:fullerene-based OPV cells has significant potential for future commercial applications.

As shown in Fig. 2–5, the 45 predominant SQ molecules with symmetric or asymmetric molecular skeleton have been employed as donors or molecular sensitizers in OPV cells and their relative OPV performances are summarized in Table 1. The following discussion will include several sections in which these SQ molecules are classified as symmetric and asymmetric SQs and briefly introduced one by one by using several topics.

The genesis of SQ dyes applied as donors in OPV devices was reported by Merritt and Hovel in 1976, where a symmetric SQ dye 1 was first applied as a single photoactive layer in a Schottky barrier-type OPV cell. In the device, 1 was sandwiched by two electrodes, i.e., a transparent In2O3 anode and a metal cathode. The electric field resulting from the difference between the work functions of the anode and cathode was not sufficient to separate the photogenerated excitons, and the electrons tended to recombine with the holes rather than reach the electrodes, hence the photocurrent generation mainly occurred at the Schottky junction, providing a very low light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of approximately 0.02%. Unless stated otherwise, the following discussion will be based on the combination of an SQ dye as a donor and fullerenes or their derivatives as acceptors.

In 2008, SQ dyes were first introduced in a p–n junction OPV system by Silvestri et al., which displayed an efficient performance of over 1%. The researchers employed hydrazone end-capped symmetric SQ dyes 2 and 3 as donors combined with a soluble n-type fullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor to fabricate solution-processed BHJ OPV devices. In SQ dyes 2 and 3, both linear and branched alkyl chain substituents allow for managing the solubility, and also offer a tool for the control of the solid-state organization, a key feature in BHJ OPV technology. The absorption coefficients of 2 and 3 are approximately 2 × 105 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 6a, the absorption spectra of the solid films are significantly broader with respect to those in the solution, which is a favorable feature for OPV applications, as discussed previously. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both 2 and 3 are −5.0 and −3.3 eV, respectively. These energy levels are suitable for the preparation of an OPV device exploiting PCBM as an acceptor. The difference of LUMO levels shown in Fig. 6b between SQ dyes 2 and 3 and PCBM is 0.7 eV, which is a sufficiently large driving force for efficient exciton dissociation. Moreover, the energy offset between the HOMO level of the SQ dye and the LUMO level of PCBM is approximately 1 eV, which is a prerequisite for a high OPV cell Voc. Additionally, these SQ:PCBM-based BHJ devices are fabricated by a spin-coating process under an ambient atmosphere, which is a very significant advantage over polymer-based devices. The broad NIR absorbing spectrum and suitable energy levels of 2 and 3 indicate that they are efficient donor materials for OPV devices. Spin-coating a 2:PCBM blend with a blend ratio of 1:3 from a chloroform solution yields an OPV device with an efficiency of 1.24%. This is one of the highest efficiencies reported for small molecule OPVs in 2008. However, the device efficiency is severely limited by the small short circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.7 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 35%, strongly indicating that charge transport in the SQ:fullerene blend film is poor. This is consistent with the poor shunt resistance under light illumination. Note that the solution process was conducted in ambient air, suggesting SQ and fullerene had good stability in both liquid solution and solid phase.
In the following step, on the basis of the skeleton of 2 and 3, the same research group synthesized two new symmetric SQ dyes by substitution at the pyrrolic nitrogen with n-hexyl (4) and n-hexenyl (5) to investigate the alkyl- and alkenyl-substituent effects on SQ dye solid-state structure, carrier mobility, and BHJ cell efficiency. Their results indicated that the alkyl/alkenyl chains negligibly affect the energy level of the SQ dye; however, the N-alkenyl substituent affords a more compact packing in solid state, enhancing charge mobility and OPV performance. The study conducted a typical strategy for designing new SQ materials via non-covalent alkenyl–phenyl contacts to enhance charge transport efficiency in OPV devices. By combining [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as an acceptor, the researchers obtained a PCE of 2.0% from an SQ 5 dye-based BHJ cell.
One way to further increase the efficiencies of OPV cells is by broadening the absorption spectrum of the photoactive layer. To obtain an SQ dye with a broad absorption spectrum, Silvestri et al. bound two Ru(II)phthalocyanine molecules to a single SQ molecule to develop the supramolecular SQ–phthalocyanine 6, which can absorb light over a larger portion of the solar spectrum relative to the isolated compounds. However, the 6:PCBM BHJ device exhibits a low PCE of approximately 0.3% mainly due to a small Jsc of 1.65 mA cm−2, which is ascribed to the low carrier mobility of the active layer.
In 2009, Mayerhöffer et al. explored a series of SQ derivatives bearing an additional dicyanovinyl acceptor moiety at the central acceptor unit, and used these SQ dyes as donors combined with a PCBM acceptor to fabricate BHJ OPV devices. Even though most of these SQ compounds demonstrated poor OPV performance, the symmetric SQ derivative 7-based OPV device exhibited a PCE of 1.79% with an unusually high Jsc of 12.6 mA cm−2 after thermal annealing. The high photocurrent is attributed to the approximately 40 nm red-shift of the absorption band and the improved hole mobility from 1.3 × 10−5 to 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing. Further evidence for the relatively high charge-carrier mobility of 7 in the OPV device was given by an FF of 47%. However, the overall PCE is limited by the rather low Voc (0.31 V) that is attributed to the shallower HOMO level of 7 (−5.1 eV).
Rao et al. synthesized a series of low bandgap symmetric SQ dyes 8–10 and used them as electron donors along with PC70BM for solution-processed BHJ cells. The charge-donating methyl and ethyl groups at the vinylic position in 9 and 10 resulted in a significant red-shift of their absorption spectra compared to the parent SQ dye 8. The red-shift of the absorption was beneficial to achieving a higher Jsc in the OPV cells. Their finding indicated that the mixed processing solvent can effectively improve the device performance of SQ:fullerene BHJ cells. By using chloroform as the processing solvent, the 8:PC70BM, 9:PC70BM and 10:PC70BM BHJ devices exhibited a PCE of 1.71%, 2.15%, and 1.89%, respectively. The PCEs of the BHJ cells based on 9:PC70BM blends cast from the DIO–THF (DIO = 1,8-diiodooctane, THF = tetrahydrofuran) mixed solvent and cast from DIO–THF with subsequent thermal annealing have been further improved up to 2.73% and 3.14%, respectively. The enhancement in the PCE was attributed to the improvement in the crystalline nature of the blend 9:PC70BM film and more balanced charge transport resulting from the higher hole mobility.
The symmetric SQ dye 11 is one of the most successful examples in SQ dye-based OPV cells. SQ dye 11 has a high absorption coefficient (>3 × 105 cm−1), and the HOMO/LUMO levels are located at −5.3/−3.5 eV, which provide a high Voc. Furthermore, as already mentioned from a synthesis perspective, SQ 11 has the following typical advantages. (i) 11 is prepared via a condensation reaction between 5 N,N-diisobutylamino-1,3-dihydroxybenzene and squaric acid, which are easily prepared with extremely inexpensive precursors, as shown in Scheme 1, and thus the by-product is only water, which is easily removed via distillation; (ii) in this reaction, expensive and hardly separable catalysts and ligands are not necessary; (iii) the final SQ product has a highly crystalline nature, and can form crystalline solids that can be easily separated from the reaction mixture with high purity over 99%; (iv) the product yield is as high as 80%. These features make SQ 11 an attractive donor for OPV devices. Forrest and Thompson obtained an efficient PHJ device using a vacuum evaporation technique to make thin films of 11 combined with the C60 acceptor. As depicted in Fig. 7, a pure film of 11 exhibits a high absorption coefficient and strong absorption in the NIR region with λmax = 680 nm. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 11 are −5.3 eV and −3.5 eV, respectively. In 11-based PHJ devices, even when employing a 6.5 nm-thick film of 11, the device shows a remarkable PCE of 3.1% with a Voc of 0.76 V, Jsc of 7.01 mA cm−2, and FF of 56%. This result opens up the way for sublimatable SQs as high performing donors in high-vacuum grown OPV devices. Solution-processed thin films of 11 combined with vacuum-deposited C60 films were later used to fabricate a PHJ device. The performances of 11/C60 OPV devices are influenced by the morphology and crystallinity of the 11 thin film controlled via post-deposition annealing. A much higher PCE of 4.6% was obtained for 11/C60 PHJ OPV devices where the SQ dye film was thermally annealed at 110 °C. Chen and co-workers used a vacuum deposition process to conform 11-based PHJ OPV devices using fullerene C70 as an acceptor instead of C60. The optical absorbance of C70 in the visible region is much greater than that of C60, as shown in Fig. 7a, which also contributes to the photocurrent of the PHJ device. Therefore, the 11:C70-based PHJ device provides a higher PCE of 4.1%. In addition, an optical simulation method determined that the exciton diffusion length (LD) in the solid thin film of 11 was as short as 4.5 nm, which is expected to be the main limitation in the efficiency of 11-based PHJ devices. Note that post thermal annealing may reduce the dark current of the PHJ device, resulting in improved FF and Voc. A BHJ device structure with a larger donor–acceptor interface in the active layer is known to be beneficial to charge separation, and thus leads to a higher PCE than that of the PHJ device structure. Therefore, in a subsequent study, Wei et al. applied 11 in a BHJ OPV system using a solution process. In this system, the researchers employed PC70BM as an acceptor, and used blend films of 11:PC70BM with various blend ratios as a photoactive layer. As shown in Fig. 7b, the absorption of the blend films covers the entire visible and NIR region, which matches well with the solar spectrum, and contributes to the high photocurrent of the BHJ cell. As a result, an optimized PCE of 2.7% with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 8.85 mA cm−2, and FF of 35% was obtained for a 11:PC70BM (1:6) active layer-based BHJ cell. Wei et al. then focused on the 11:PC70BM (1:6) system, and employed solvent annealing for treating the active layer to further improve device performance to 5.2% with a Jsc of 12.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 V, and FF of 50%. A film morphology analysis of the 11:PC70BM (1:6) blend before and after solvent annealing indicated that significant phase separation occurs on the solvent-annealed film, which benefits charge transport, and thus improves the Jsc and FF of the BHJ cell. Chen and co-workers also observed a PCE of 4.0% from the solution-processed 11:PC70BM (1:5) BHJ cell shown in Fig. 8. Using the vacuum co-evaporation technique, the researchers further improved the PCE of the BHJ cells to 6.1% for a 11:C70 (1:5) active layer-based device. The higher carrier mobility in the co-evaporated photoactive layer is expected to contribute to the larger Jsc and FF, and thus a higher PCE than that of the solution-processed BHJ cells. Chen et al. found that the device performance of 11:PC70BM BHJ cells was also sensitive to the anode buffer layer. For example, MoO3 anode buffer layer-based devices exhibited a larger Voc than that of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode buffer layer-based devices, which may be explained by the different work functions of the indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoO3 anode (−5.7 eV) and the ITO/PEDOT:PSS anode (−5.0 eV).
Though SQ dye 11 has shown promising properties for high-efficiency OPVs, the material still has several drawbacks that limit the OPV device performance, such as relatively low solubility unless substituted with large alkyl groups, an absorption band mainly in the red and NIR requiring other materials to achieve a broadband response, and a low charge carrier mobility of 3.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. To overcome these negative factors, a series of symmetrical SQ dyes 12–14 based on the molecular structure of 11 were synthesized by Wang et al. Straight alkyl or aromatic groups were introduced into the SQ derivatives as side chains to tune the energy level and absorption of the material, and also improve solubility in organic solvents. The SQ dyes 12–14 have deep HOMO levels from −5.2 to −5.3 eV and small bandgaps of 1.5–1.6 eV. PHJ devices based on 12 and 13 with N,N-diarylamine substituents and fullerene C60 demonstrate high PCEs of 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively, whereas PHJ device based on 14 with N,N-dialkylamine substituents show relatively lower PCE of 4.6%. The researchers found that the introduced N-aryl groups strongly affect the solubility of the SQs, and thus affect the morphology of solution-cast thin films. Furthermore, the N-aryl groups deepen the HOMO levels relative to that of SQs with N-alkyl groups, such that OPV devices employing SQ dyes 12 and 13 as a donor material exhibit a significant increase in Voc compared to devices employing SQ dyes 11 and 14. Employing a 12/C70 OPV device as a front subcell, Lassiter et al. obtained a PCE of 6.6% for tandem OPV cells.
Based on the SQ dye 12, Pelle and co-workers synthesized a series of symmetric SQ dyes functionalized with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents to tune the optical and electrochemistry properties of the dyes. Karak et al. chose the SQ dye 15 which possessed a very small bandgap (1.4 eV) and a deep HOMO level (−5.3 eV) as the donor material to make solution-processed BHJ cells. By using THF as the processing solvent, the 15:PC70BM BHJ cell showed poor OPV performance with PCE of 0.63%. Interestingly, a 7-fold higher PCE of 4.44% with Jsc of 10.01 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.84 V and FF of 53% was achieved by using the mixed solvent THF–CB–DIO (CB = chlorobenzene) as the processing solvent combined with post-fabrication thermal film annealing treatment. The improvement of the device performance was attributed to the formation of active layer morphology with better π-system stacking of 15 and improved PC70BM phase crystallinity.
The symmetric SQ dyes 12 and 13 have shown excellent device performance in PHJ OPV cells. The N-aryl groups in these SQ molecules deepen the HOMO levels relative to SQ dyes with N-alkyl groups, thereby increasing the Voc as well as improving charge carrier transport. However, these types of SQs were introduced into the solution-processed BHJ system with difficulty because of their limited solubility in organic solvents. To improve their solubility, a series of symmetric SQ derivatives 16–18 containing a phenyl group and alkyl chains of different lengths have been synthesized by Sasabe et al. The solubility of these SQ dyes increased with increasing alkyl chain length. SQ dye 18 possessed the longest alkyl chains and exhibited the highest solubility of up to 15 mg mL−1 in chloroform and non-halogenated solvents such as THF and toluene. These SQs had high extinction coefficients of approximately 3.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in solution and exhibited broad NIR absorption in thin films. All these SQs exhibited equivalent HOMO/LUMO levels of −5.3/−3.6 eV irrespective of the different alkyl chain lengths. These SQs were developed as donor materials and combined with the PC70BM acceptor for solution-processed BHJ cells. SQ:PC70BM OPV devices employing 16, 17, and 18 demonstrated PCEs of 4.9%, 4.1%, and 2.0%, respectively. These observations indicate that devices based on the SQ dye 16 with shorter alkyl chains generated a higher PCE than those of 17 and 18 with longer alkyl chains. This is attributed to the shorter alkyl chains inducing a strong red-shift and broadened peak for enhanced photoresponse in the NIR region, which is favorable for high OPV performance.
As shown in the above examples, Chen and co-workers have found that the symmetric amino-SQs with four hydroxyl (OH) groups, i.e., the SQ dyes possessing an SQ(OH)4 skeleton, exhibit outstanding performance in OPV cells because of their large absorption coefficients greater than 2 × 105 cm−1, their relatively small bandgaps of approximately 1.7 eV, and their deep HOMO levels of approximately −5.3 eV. An important question related to the chemical structure of SQ(OH)4 skeleton-based SQ dyes is why these compounds exhibit superior material properties and OPV performance compared with other SQs. To investigate the effect of the OH groups in these compounds on the material properties and OPV performance, Chen and co-workers investigated the series of symmetric SQ dyes 19–21 based on the 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-dibutylamino)-phenyl] squaraine skeleton with different numbers of OH groups, where SQ dyes 19, 20, and 21 have 4, 2, and 0 OH groups, respectively. Their investigations indicated that the number of OH groups controls the HOMO level of SQ dyes 19–21 through intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, where the HOMO levels of 19, 20, and 21 are −5.18, −5.07, and −5.02 eV, respectively. A comparison of the HOMO levels of 19–21 reveals that the HOMO deepens with increasing number of OH groups, suggesting that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces the overall energy in the SQ core via the participation of the conjugated structures. SQ dye 19, having four OH groups, possesses a deeper HOMO level, and thus provides a higher Voc in OPV devices.
As discussed, among the symmetric SQ dyes, the SQ(OH)4 skeleton-based N,N-diarylamino-SQ derivatives have exhibited excellent performance for OPV cells. By using this kind of SQ dye as the donor, a PCE of over 5% has been realized from both the PHJ or BHJ devices. However, the relatively lower hole mobilities and thus limited hole-transport properties seem to represent a major problem as suggested by the generally observed low FF in most of the reported devices. From the molecular design point of view, the synthesis of SQ materials based on the SQ(OH)4 skeleton with different side chains attached on this skeleton represents a promising strategy to obtain efficient SQ dyes possessing deep HOMO levels, high absorption coefficients, broad NIR absorption, and high hole mobilities.

Some recent research results have shown that asymmetrical SQs are also promising donor materials for OPV cells due to their fine-tuning optoelectronic properties and good solubility in common organic solvents. Two asymmetric SQ derivatives 22 and 23 were first employed as electron donors in a PHJ device combined with fullerene C60 as an electron acceptor. SQs 22 and 23 possess a low bandgap (approximately 1.6 eV) and a deep HOMO level (−5.3 eV). Due to the extremely high extinction coefficient of 3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and the limited LD of 22 and 23, OPV devices based on these SQs show strong light filtering effects even at small film thicknesses of 35 to 40 nm. At reduced film thicknesses of 20 nm, this filtering effect can be alleviated, and PCEs of 0.59% and 1.01% were obtained for 22- and 23-based OPV devices, respectively. The further reduction of the SQ film thickness benefits charge extraction because of the short travel distance from the bulk film to the electrode, thereby providing improved device efficiency.

Wang et al. synthesized two asymmetrical SQ dyes 24 and 25 along with the symmetrical SQ dyes 12–14.24 and 25 possess deep HOMO levels of −5.3 and −5.4 eV, and large bandgaps of 2.1 and 1.9 eV, respectively. Despite the relatively lower PCE, the asymmetric SQ dyes 24 and 25 have achieved a high Voc in devices because of their deep HOMO levels. For example, 24- and 25-based SQ/C60 PHJ devices were shown to possess Voc values as high as 1.0 and 0.92 V, respectively. Interestingly, the PHJ device based on the blended donor layer 13:25 with a ratio of 1:0.5 and C60 exhibited an improved PCE of 5.9%. Meanwhile, the blended donor layer 25:12 with a ratio of 4:6 based the SQ/C70 PHJ device also displayed an improved PCE of 5.4%. By introducing a 25:12(4:6)/C70 PHJ device as a front subcell into the tandem OPV cell, Zimmerman et al. obtained an excellent PCE of 8.3%, which is the highest PCE value until now in the family of SQ dye-based OPV cells.
Yang et al. explored two new asymmetric SQ dyes 26 and 27. In SQ dye 26, a strong electron-donating diisobutylamino group was incorporated into the phenyl group, while a carbazyl substituent instead of diisobutylamino was employed in SQ dye 27. The strong electron-donating diisobutylamino group in 26 resulted in a relatively low bandgap and good solubility. However, the relatively high HOMO level as well as the electron-insulating isobutyls in 26 led to lower PCE of 1.54% with Voc of 0.75 V, Jsc of 5.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 38% from the 26:PC70BM BHJ cell. Owing to the relatively weak electron-donating capability of the carbazyl group, 27 exhibited an extremely deep HOMO energy level of −5.46 eV and a relatively small bandgap of 1.65 eV, which rendered solution-processed 27:PC70BM OPV cells with an impressive Voc of up to 1.12 V. However, the PCE was limited to 2.34% due to the low FF of 36% and Jsc of 5.81 mA cm−2.
The low Jsc and FF of 26 and 27 based BHJ cells might be mostly ascribed to the low hole mobility of the optical active layer. The SQ dyes with good planar molecular skeletons can be obtained through rational molecular design to promote better intermolecular packing for enhanced carrier mobility, essentially improving the Jsc and FF and the resulting PCE of the corresponding BHJ cells. Along this molecular design strategy, Yang et al. designed two asymmetric SQ dyes 28 and 29 by introducing the indolinyl and indolyl groups with high molecular rigidity and good planarity, respectively. In 28 and 29, the cyclopentyl segment was fused onto the indoline or indole segments to endow the SQ dyes with good solution-processing capability. In comparison with the SQ dye 29 bearing cyclopenta[b]-indolyl substituent, the SQ dye 28 with cyclopenta[b]indolinyl as end-capper showed more planar molecular geometry, more intense intermolecular interactions, higher density in crystalline state, bathochromic-shifted absorption spectra, higher absorption coefficient, and higher hole mobility. Consequently, the 28 based BHJ cell displayed much higher Jsc and FF, and thus a much higher PCE of 3.9% than that of the 29 based device.
To further explore other efficient asymmetric SQ dyes for high performance OPV cells, Yang et al. designed and synthesized a series of asymmetrical SQ derivatives 30–35 bearing N,N-diarylamino substituents as end-capping groups based on the molecular skeleton of 26.30–35 exhibited red-shifted and broadened absorption bands as well as lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared to the reference SQ dye 26. Despite the hole mobilities of most of the compounds still being lower than that of 26, solution-processed SQ:PC70BM BHJ cells using 30–35 as electron donor materials all showed drastically higher PCE of 3.08–3.69% than that of the 26-based reference device. The much enhanced OPV performance could be attributed to the simultaneously enhanced Jsc of 8.07–9.06 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81–0.87 V and FF of 45–47% relative to those of the reference 26-based device. These research studies demonstrated that N,N-diarylamino end-capping might pave a very important strategy for simultaneous enhancement of Jsc, Voc and FF, resulting in high PCE in SQ dye-based OPVs.
Considering most SQ dyes suffer from a narrow absorption band, which is disadvantageous for the light-harvesting process in OPV cells, Chen et al. have done some research work to explore asymmetric SQs showing relatively broad absorption spectra in the visible-NIR region. Silvestri et al. and Bagnis et al. have discovered that the symmetric SQ dyes containing an (E)-2-((2,2-diphenylhydrazono)-methyl)-1-(hex-5-enyl)-1H-pyrrole unit had relatively broad absorption bands and high hole mobility due to the presence of double-bond end-capped alkyl side-chains. Yang et al. have found that N-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)indoline with a planar geometry was an ideal segment for constructing high performance asymmetric SQs with relatively low bandgaps. Based on these reports, Chen et al. designed and synthesized an asymmetric SQ dye 36 by employing both the (E)-2-((2,2-diphenylhydrazono)-methyl)-1-(hex-5-enyl)-1H-pyrrole and N-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)indoline subunits directly linked to the squaric acid core.37 and 38 were successively synthesized by changing the 1-indolinyl subunit of 36 to cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl and benzo[e]cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl groups, respectively, to improve the solubility and intermolecular π–π stacking. Through this rational molecular design strategy, they obtained a promising asymmetric SQ dye 38 with good solubility, an ideal bandgap of 1.33 eV, together with an intense and broad absorption band in the range 550–950 nm. Hence, the solution-processed 38:PC70BM based BHJ cells displayed an impressive Jsc of 11.80 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 4.12%.
By using the asymmetrical SQ dyes as electron donors, the PCE of over 4% has been realized from both PHJ devices and BHJ devices. However, the synthesis of asymmetric SQ molecules specifically designed for OPV cells has been limited to a few examples so far, it may be premature to draw definitive conclusions about the molecular design strategy to get efficient asymmetric SQ compounds for OPV applications.

SQ dyes exhibit pronounced aggregation features that are known to affect absorption bands both in solution and at the solid–liquid interface, which is a frequently encountered phenomenon in dye chemistry owing to strong intermolecular interactions between the molecules. Aggregates with absorption bands that shifted to shorter wavelengths (hypsochromically shifted) with respect to the monomer band are denoted as H-aggregates, which in most cases provide low or no fluorescence. In contrast, aggregates with narrow absorption bands that shift to longer wavelengths (bathochromically shifted) with respect to the monomer band and provide a nearly resonant fluorescence within a narrow band are denoted as J-aggregates.

Recently, several groups have found that the control of the aggregation behavior of SQ molecules in solid-state films plays an important role in improving the PCE of the resulting OPV cells. Deing et al. first investigated the effect of the aggregation of SQ dyes on the performance of SQ:PCBM BHJ cells. They observed the presence of either H- or J-aggregates for several different SQ molecules in the SQ:PCBM blend films, and even for the same SQ dye such as SQ 7 depending on the thermal annealing conditions of the blends. Spencer et al. observed a J-aggregation-like absorption red-shift in the 39:PCBM BHJ system, and the amount of J-aggregate was increased using co-solvent addition, which increased both the Jsc and PCE of OPV devices by 50%. They also controlled the aggregation properties of SQ dye 40 in a 40:PCBM BHJ cell by thermal annealing to improve OPV performance. Chen and co-workers also systematically studied the effect of aggregation of SQ dyes 11 and 19–21 on solid film properties and SQ:fullerene OPV device performance. They observed that these four SQ dyes exhibit substantially different aggregation behavior in neat films; however, all of these exhibit J-aggregation in an SQ:PC70BM active layer. The absorption of the J-aggregates improves the photoresponse at longer wavelengths, and thus provides a higher Jsc in OPV cells. Chen and co-workers also found that the aggregation behavior of SQ dye 21 in solid films can be controlled via processing solvents, where different casting solvents provided different aggregation behaviors and correspondingly different device performance in 21/C60 PHJ cells. Brück et al. also observed different aggregation states in SQ:PCBM blend films of SQ dyes 41–43, which cause different effects on device performance. From these investigations, we conclude that there are three methods to control the aggregation states of SQ dyes in solid films: (i) molecular structure modification; (ii) thermal annealing treatment; and (iii) the processing solvent. These three methods will be individually described in detail in combination with some examples.

Molecular structure modification is the most efficient method to realize different aggregation states for SQ dyes in solid films. Tian et al. found that SQ(OH)4 skeleton-based SQ molecules with branched N-alkyl side chains such as sec-butyls and isobutyls tend to form J-aggregates in the neat film, whereas molecules with linear N-alkyl chains are apt to form H-aggregates. Of the above mentioned SQs, 11 and 43, possessing isobutyl or sec-butyl side chains, displayed J-aggregation behavior in solid films, whereas 19 and 42 with linear N-butyl or N-hexyl chains displayed H-aggregation behavior in solid films. In addition, the SQ(OH)2 skeleton-based SQ molecules with linear side chains such as 20 and 39 displayed typical H-aggregation properties in solid films.


For the thermal annealing treatment method, the most illustrative example is the 7:PCBM blend film in which four different aggregation states could be obtained depending upon the choice of the annealing temperature.Fig. 9a shows the absorption spectra of 7:PCBM blend film with different domain types. In the figure, A represents the amorphous state from an as-cast film, R-110 represents the red-shifted (J-aggregate) domain obtained at an annealing temperature of 110 °C, and R-150 and B-150 represent red-shifted (J-aggregate) and blue-shifted (H-aggregate) domains obtained at an annealing temperature of 150 °C. Fig. 9b and c display the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the different domain types of the 7:PCBM blend film. From Fig. 9, the J-aggregate is observed to exhibit a red-shift of the absorption maximum, resulting in a significant increase in the Jsc and decrease in the Voc compared to that in the as-cast device. The H-aggregate exhibits a blue-shift in the absorption maximum, and concomitantly, only a moderate increase in the Jsc as well as an increase in the Voc.


Chen and co-workers found that the aggregation behavior of SQ dyes in solid films can be also controlled via processing solvents. As shown in Fig. 10a, the spin-cast films of SQ dye 21 exhibit a narrow absorption peak at 770 nm, which shifts by 125 nm toward a longer wavelength, characterized as a J-aggregate, when the films are processed using dichloromethane, chloroform, or chlorobenzene solutions. However, from an o-dichlorobenzene solution, a dramatic blue-shift in the absorption peak at 544 nm is observed, characterized as an H-aggregate, which is attributed to the parallel alignment of the molecular dipole moments. Fast solvent evaporation appears to favor the formation of J-aggregates. Furthermore, the hole mobilities for the J-aggregation films are an order of magnitude higher than those for H-aggregation films. Chen and coworkers ascribe this to the strong intermolecular coupling of the J-aggregation states. Therefore, Fig. 10b and c show a significant contribution of J-aggregation to the photocurrent in 21/C60 PHJ OPV cells. In addition, the J-aggregation films demonstrate a deeper ionization potential by approximately 0.3 eV, which is most likely due to intermolecular charge transfer interactions, and thus provides larger Voc values than those of the H-aggregation film-based devices. Therefore, both the Jsc and Voc of J-aggregation-based devices are three times higher than those of the H-aggregation-based devices. J-aggregate formation is considered then as an effective approach to tune the optical/electrical properties in organic optoelectronic devices.

The above examples indicate that J-aggregates display a positive effect on OPV performance because of the following two factors. (1) The bathochromically shifted absorption band derived from J-aggregates has a better spectral match with the solar spectrum in the infrared range, where the photon flux is mainly distributed in promoting the photocurrent of the OPV cells. (2) Due to strong inter-molecular coupling, J-aggregation provides a potential opportunity to tune the energy levels and carrier mobilities of organic thin films. Both these factors are prerequisites for the efficient light-electricity conversion of OPV devices.

It has long been argued what type of the optimal morphology at the donor–acceptor interface allows both efficient charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor and minimal charge non-germinate recombination in a BHJ device. However, this issue remains challenging due to its complexity involving interactions from the molecular scale up to phase separation at a scale of tens of nanometers, as well as some processing parameters. Several types of phases coexist in the film. The mixed donor–acceptor amorphous phase is necessary for obtaining sufficient driving force to separate the weakly bound electron–hole pairs, while the relatively pure donor or acceptor phases should have high carrier mobility for efficient charge extraction. Various mechanisms have been proposed to provide a consistent explanation of the experimental results.

In the meantime, the OPV performance of the PHJ device structure is thus far severely limited by inefficient exciton collection, and overall the photocurrent is smaller than that of BHJ devices. However, to understand charge generation and recombination in an OPV cell, the clear-cut interface provides a unique testing vehicle.
A previous report on the solvent vapor treatment of 11:PC70BM-based BHJ devices indicates that the SQ molecules tend to form a crystalline structure when exposed to various solvent vapors. Such fine tuning of the film morphology has been used in polymer OPV cells. For the PHJ device structure, Zimmerman et al. conducted a systematic study to elucidate the correlation between the donor–acceptor interface and OPV performance. They deposited C60 fullerene as an acceptor on a solution-coated SQ dye 12 donor film. As shown in Fig. 11, the pristine heterojunction provides for a high Voc but a low Jsc. If the donor SQ film is treated by solvent vapors prior to C60 deposition, the strong crystallinity of the SQ film results in a high Jsc and excellent FF, although the Voc is significantly reduced. Hence, the donor–acceptor interface is considered to be responsible for the low Voc, which has been adequately discussed by Lam et al. in a SQ:PC70BM system. While the bulk property, i.e., crystallinity, of the donor film is responsible for high photocurrent. To obtain a high Jsc while preserving a high Voc, the made-up heterojunction was treated by solvent vapors. In this case, a highly ordered structure for both donor and acceptor bulk films was obtained, which is important for efficient exciton collection and charge transport. Yet, the donor–acceptor interface remains in an amorphous form. As a result, both high Jsc and Voc are achieved without sacrificing the FF.

Recently, rapid development has been achieved for polymer OPV cells, and the PCE has been increased to over 10%. Though impressive, further development is required to ensure promising future commercial applications. The relatively narrow spectral overlap of organic polymer absorption bands with the solar spectrum is one of the major limitations for the PCE of polymer OPV cells. Among the different strategies available, blending additional NIR absorbing donors into the polymer OPV cell system is a promising method to extend the absorption spectra of large bandgap polymers to the NIR region, and thus enhance the light harvesting capacity of single BHJ OPV cells. The NIR absorbing property of SQ dyes makes these ideal candidates to be employed as additives in polymer OPV cells. More importantly, compared to other NIR small molecular sensitizers, the efficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the polymer to SQ in the SQ:polymer:fullerene ternary-blend system enables the effective use of multiple donors, thereby bringing significant improvements in light absorption and conversion.

The first demonstration of a polymer OPV cell employing an SQ dye as a molecular sensitizer was presented by Huang et al., where the NIR absorber SQ dye 11 was used to sensitize poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PCBM polymer OPV cells. In their experiment, various ratios of 11 from 0.5 to 5 wt% were incorporated into P3HT:PCBM blends to fabricate organic ternary OPV cells with the device structure ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM:11/Ag, as presented in Fig. 12a. Devices with 1 wt% 11 in the P3HT:PCBM film obtained an optimal device performance with a PCE of 4.5% shown in Fig. 12b, which represents a 38% enhancement relative to the P3HT:PCBM reference devices. In addition to the efficiency enhancement, Förster-type energy transfer from P3HT to 11 was observed, making such a ternary system very interesting for a fundamental study.
By incorporating 1 wt% 11 in the P3HT:PCBM matrix, the absorption of the active layer film was extended to 750 nm, as shown in Fig. 12a. The broadened absorption resulted in a constant EQE of approximately 13% (Fig. 12c), which was achieved for a wavelength range from 650 to 750 nm, where P3HT does not contribute to the photocurrent. Similarly, the FRET from P3HT to 11 was also demonstrated to improve exciton migration over long distances using the transient spectroscopic method. Both the enhancements in the photon absorption range and exciton harvesting contribute to the increased Jsc. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the BHJ device blend films with and without 11 indicated a better nanoscale crystallinity and improved nanomorphology in the BHJ device blends with 11, which result in a better FF than that of the reference P3HT:PCBM BHJ device. Both the improved Jsc and FF contribute to an improved overall efficiency.
A second successful case of an SQ sensitized P3HT:PCBM system was reported by Cho et al. In their experiment, 5 wt% of SQ dye 12 was introduced into the P3HT:PCBM host matrix to produce OPV cells with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM:12/LiF/Al. The NIR absorption of the blend film was enhanced by the addition of SQ dye 12, resulting in an increased PCE of the P3HT:PCBM devices by over 20%, where a maximum PCE of 3.4% ± 0.3% and an EQE as high as 55% were achieved.
Concurrently, Chen and co-workers also employed SQ dye 11 as a molecular sensitizer to increase the light-harvesting capacity in P3HT:PCBM polymer OPV cells. The absorption of 11 contributed to the photoresponse of the cells in the NIR region. The enhancement of the light harvesting capacity efficiently increased the Jsc, and thus improved the PCE by approximately 10%. An optimized PCE of 3.4% under 1 sun, AM 1.5G solar irradiation was achieved with the 11:P3HT:PCBM system that included 3 or 5 wt% of 11. The morphological analysis results demonstrated that low concentrations of 11 did not disturb the film morphology. However, the film morphology was disturbed if the concentration of the SQ additive was increased to 10 wt%, which may be responsible for the lower FF and poor device performance of the 10 wt% 11:P3HT:PCBM BHJ cells.
Most recently, Rao et al. found that the SQ dye 8 was also a promising molecular sensitizer for increasing the PCE of P3HT:PC70BM-based polymer OPV cells. With the incorporation of 2.5 wt% of SQ dye 8 in a P3HT:PC70BM blend, the PCE has been enhanced up to 4.55% as compared to 3.47% for the reference P3HT:PC70BM device. The PCE has been further enhanced to 5.15% when the thermally annealed P3HT:8:PC70BM blend was used as the photoactive layer. The improvement in the OPV performance with the incorporation of 8 attributed to the improvement in the light-harvesting efficiency in the NIR region of the solar spectrum and increased exciton dissociation into free charge carriers in the ternary blended film.
Kokil et al. also employed three SQ dyes 12, 44 and 45 as molecular sensitizers to increase the PCEs of air-processed P3HT:PCBM polymer OPV cells. Their finding demonstrated that these three SQ dyes can significantly enhance the OPV performance of P3HT:PCBM BHJ cells, not just through improved device Jsc but also enhanced Voc. Upon addition of 10 wt% of SQ dye 45 in the P3HT:PCBM devices, the device showed much enhanced PCE up to 4.6%, which was over 3-fold higher than the PCE of reference P3HT:PCBM cells.
The above several cases demonstrate that SQ dyes are efficient molecular sensitizers for increasing the light harvesting capacity and device performance of polymer OPV cells. As suggested in the work of Huang et al., the photocurrent can be further increased by incorporating other SQ molecules with different end-groups to broaden the absorption range more deeply into the NIR region. In the future, the realization of a single-junction cell with a PCE beyond 10% could be very easily achieved by adopting SQ sensitizers in other polymer systems, such as thieno[3,4-b] thiophene/benzodithiophene polymers (PTB7) and its analogs, reaching a PCE of approximately 10%.

In summary, we have reviewed the recent developments of SQ dyes and SQ dye-based OPV cells, covering the topics of molecular design and OPV cell design, discussing the impacts of molecular packing and film morphology, and examining the various strategies employed to achieve high OPV performance. From an electronic properties perspective, the symmetric SQ dyes possessing an SQ(OH)4 skeleton show promising properties for OPV applications because of their large absorption coefficients, relatively small bandgaps, and deep HOMO levels. Meanwhile, asymmetric SQ dyes also display promising properties for OPV cells, such as their fine-tuning optoelectronic properties and good solubility in common organic solvents. Furthermore, control of the aggregation behavior of SQ molecules in solid-state films is found to play an important role in improving the PCEs of OPV cells. For example, J-aggregation of SQ molecules in a solid-state film leads to a red-shift of the absorption spectrum, which contributes toward an enhancement in the photocurrent of the OPV cell, thereby improving OPV performance. We believe that J-aggregation is an efficient approach for obtaining high performance OPV devices. Meanwhile, solvent vapor annealing of SQ heterojunctions can be used to independently control the interface characteristics and bulk thin-film morphologies, thereby modifying charge transport and exciton dissociation in PHJ devices, and offering extensive opportunities to improve the PV performance. From the standpoint of the presently very low FF of the SQ:fullerene BHJ structure, the PCE can be enhanced to 8–10% if the FF can attain a value over 70%. In addition, SQ dyes have been found to act as efficient molecular sensitizers for improving the performance of polymer OPV cells by increasing their light harvesting capacities. Adopting SQ dye sensitizers in polymer systems could be a promising method of realizing high performance single-junction OPV cells.

To further enhance the PCEs of SQ dye-based OPV cells to values greater than 10%, the critical issue is the carrier mobility in SQ:fullerene blend films, through which charge recombination can be minimized, and thus achieve a high Jsc and FF. Several methods could solve the above issue. In the exploration of new SQ donors to obtain efficient SQ dyes possessing deep HOMO levels, high absorption coefficients, broad NIR absorption, and high hole mobilities, the presented analysis suggests that the synthesis of SQ materials based on the SQ(OH)4 skeleton with different side chains attached on this skeleton represents a promising strategy. Furthermore, the aggregation behaviors of SQ dyes can be finely tuned to obtain thin solid films possessing NIR absorption, deep HOMO levels, and high carrier mobilities. Finally, the tuning of processing treatments such as thermal annealing and solvent vapor annealing is necessary to precisely control the film morphology of the active layer for both efficient charge generation and extraction. Improved carrier mobility in SQ:fullerene films can be realized by optimizing morphology and molecular ordering of the active layer, thereby obtaining high efficiency OPV cells.
