The present review gives an overview of four of the most promising classes of conjugated polymers for plastic solar cells. The latest developments on poly(2,7-carbazole)s, poly(1,4-diketopyrrolopyrrole)s, poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)s, and poly(thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)s are reported. More precisely, the synthesis and the physical and electronic properties of the polymers are discussed. Devices characteristics such as the open-circuit voltage, the fill factor, the short-circuit current density and the power conversion efficiency are also addressed. In summary, this review wants to give the reader a highlight of the very latest improvements in the organic photovoltaic field.

The world energy need is increasing steadily. Therefore, it is important to find new ways of producing energy with minimal impact on the environment. Many types of renewable energies have been proposed such as hydroelectricity, wind power, hydrogen, biomass, geothermal, and solar energy to name a few. From these, solar energy is one particularly interesting way to contribute to lower the greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce our imprints on the environment. Indeed, the energy coming from the sun is free and abundant over the earth. Using solar panels based on silicon, it is relatively easy to harvest this energy. However, the cost of these solar panels is still expensive. Unless new progress is made to lower their manufacturing cost, new approaches have to be proposed. The utilisation of plastic solar cells should permit the widespread development of the solar energy and their day-to-day application in small portable and flexible solar cells for recharging, for instance, cell phones or laptop computers.


Harvesting energy directly from sunlight using solar cells is a very important method to address growing global energy needs with a renewable resource while minimizing detrimental effects on the environment. Along these lines, plastic solar cells (PSC) possess many advantages over silicon-based solar cells such as low cost synthesis and easy processing (roll-to-roll, doctor blading, etc.). Moreover, they can be chemically fine tuned to increase their solubility in organic solvents and to better absorb the emission spectrum of the sun. To optimize such polymers solar cells, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) approach which consists of an active layer composed of a polymeric material (donor) blend with a fullerene derivative (acceptor) has been particularly successful. This configuration maximizes the interface between the phases and allows a good charge percolation. For instance, power conversion efficiencies higher than 8% have been recently achieved using such a strategy.

To fully characterize the performance of a polymer solar cell, a few parameters must be taken into account, such as: the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE). All of these parameters are defined by this equation (eqn (1)):
(1)

Pin is the power density of the incident light source. Furthermore, when blended with a fullerene derivative (for instance PCBM, Fig. 1), it is important to develop polymers material with low LUMO energy levels (hopefully between −3.7 and −4.0 eV) while keeping the band gap between 1.2 and 1.9 eV. These optimized parameters should provide efficient charge separation, high open circuit voltage while keeping a good air-stability. Following those rules, it should be possible to achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 10%.

There have been many good reviews on the subject in the past few years, many of them focusing on the well-known P3HT/PCBM blends (Fig. 1). To cover the latest developments, we will review recent studies on poly(2,7-carbazole)s, poly(1,4-diketopyrrolopyrrole)s, poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)s, and poly(thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)s. Those new materials have attracted much interest from the scientific community with their promising results for commercial applications.

Polycarbazoles (i.e. polyvinylcarbazoles or PVKs) were first reported as photoconductive materials in photocopiers. Since then, different families of poly(carbazole)s have been reported in the literature such as poly(3,6-carbazole)s, poly(1,8-carbazole)s, and poly(2,7-carbazole)s. This last class of materials was found to exhibit interesting features that make these polymers attractive for photovoltaic applications. Indeed, poly(2,7-carbazole)s possess low HOMO energy levels which lead to air-stable materials and to high open circuit voltage (Voc). Upon structure modifications, those materials can be easily fine tuned to match the optimal solar spectra emission. They can also exhibit good hole mobility values. Also, the 2,7-carbazole ring is fully aromatic, which provides a better chemical stability. To prepare the 2,7-carbazole unit, 4,4′-dibromodiphenyl must first undergo a nitration reaction followed by a Cadogan ring closure reaction. Then, it is possible to add an alkyl chain on the carbazole ring as reported in Scheme 1.

Müllen and his team were the first ones to report a 2,7-carbazole-based polymer in a solar cell. They described a poly(N-(2′-decyltetradecyl)-2,7-carbazole) (P1) blended with perylene tetracarboxydiimide as the acceptor Scheme 2. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.6% was obtained for a 1:5 blend ratio (Table 1). To better fit with the solar spectrum, a series of carbazolevinylene polymers (P2 to P6) was reported by Leclerc et al. Several oligothiophene comonomers were utilized to reduce the band gap and enhance the hole transporting properties. Interestingly, a metal-free Horner's–Emmons polymerization reaction was employed for the synthesis of the polymers. Unfortunately, molecular weights below 5 kg mol−1 were obtained. However, the optical band gap is easily tuned by the addition of the thiophene unit in the backbone, ranging from 2.78 eV for P2 to 2.00 eV for P6. Power conversion efficiency reached a maximum of 0.8% with P6 with a low Jsc value of 1.56 mA cm−2. Results for polymers P2 to P6 are summarized in Table 1. These low PCE results can be partially explained by the low molecular weights of the polymers. All devices were made with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC60BM/Al configuration under an active area of 25 mm2.

Soon after, Leclerc's group reported a poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative with branched alkyl side chains on the carbazole unit copolymerized with a dithienylbenzothiadiazole moiety, which led to a material with a higher molecular weight and better processability. Indeed, polymerization by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction gave polymer P7 with a Mn over 30 kg mol−1. To further complete the study, several benzothiadiazole derivatives, P8 to P12, were synthesized and characterized. DFT theoretical calculations were made on model compounds and a good fit was found with the experimental values of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and band gaps. Polymers with a pyridine core (P9–P11) showed lower molecular weights (4.0 to 11 kg mol−1), probably due to the fact that the pyridine ring might act as a ligand for the palladium catalyst. Nevertheless, the use of quinoxaline, benzothiadiazole, or benzooxadiazole had a direct effect on the optical band gaps which can be tuned from 2.02 to 1.67 eV (see Table 1). The photovoltaic properties revealed that polymer P7 shows the highest PCE among the poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives with a PCE value of 3.6%, a Voc of 0.86 V, a FF of 0.56 and a Jsc of 6.8 mA cm−2 (with PC60BM and an active area of 90 mm2). To investigate the charge mobility, OFET measurements were also performed and a hole mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1 was obtained for P7. Further optimization, especially by varying the solution concentration, the acceptor ratio, and the thickness of the active layer, improved the PCE from 3.6% to 4.6% to 5.7%. Studies by Heeger et al. even improved the PCE up to 6.1% without the use of thermal annealing or processing additives. It is important to note that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) reached nearly 100%, indicating that almost every photon absorbed in the active layer leads to a pair of charge carriers, collected at their respective electrodes. Very recently, a remarkable PCE of 7.1% has been reached for P7.
Following this work, a series of 2,7-carbazole with a pyridazine core were reported. The introduction of a pyridazine core should lower both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels. Polymers were obtained by a Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization. Unfortunately, P13–P15 possess number-average molecular weights below 5 kg mol−1, which could be explained by a strong interaction between the palladium catalyst and the pyridazine core. Yet, the optical band gaps reported are ranging from 1.57 to 1.91 eV. A maximum PCE of 0.5% was obtained with P13 with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC60BM/Al configuration on an active area of 100 mm2 (Table 1). The low current densities (Jsc), fill factors (FF), and PCE can be partially explained by the low molecular weight and the non-optimized morphologies.
To improve the charge carrier transport, Zhang et al. have reported P16, which has a linear alkyl chain on the carbazole part and an alkyloxy chain at the 5,6-positions on the benzothiadiazole core. Indeed, X-ray data confirmed that P16 possesses a better chain packing in the solid state. Also, FET mobility measurements showed a balanced electron and hole mobilities of 1 × 10−4 and 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. A high PCE of 5.4% was reached with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 9.6 mA cm−2, and an impressive FF of 0.69. It is important to note that PC70BM was used as the acceptor and the active layer morphology was optimized by processing additives such as 2.5% of DIO (diiodooctane). P16 shows a good solubility in organic solvents and a broad absorption in the visible region (band gap of 1.95 eV).
In parallel, polymers P17–P19 were reported by Hashimoto et al. Number-average molecular weights under 10 kg mol−1 were obtained for P18 and P19 (thienopyrazine core) which were synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization. Low power conversion efficiencies of 1.0% and 0.9% have been reported for P18 and P19, respectively. With P17, a PCE of 3.0% was obtained without optimization, which is lower than the similar polymer P7. In the same vein, Iraqi et al. reported a new 2,7-carbazolethiadiazoloquinoxaline derivative, P20, with a triarylamine group at the 9-position of the carbazole ring. Molecular weights are low (3.3 kg mol−1) due to the lack of solubility generated by the triarylamine group. Interestingly, a very low band gap of 1.10 eV was obtained for this polymer mainly caused by the fact that P20 adopts a planar conformation in the solid state. After annealing at 150 °C and using a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC60BM/Ca/Ag configuration, a PCE of 0.6% was reached, but with both low Voc of 0.41 V and low FF of 0.29.
In summary, poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives with their relatively low HOMO energy levels have made great progress in terms of power conversion efficiencies over the past few years. Indeed, a PCE above 7% has been recently obtained which is probably about the maximum that one can reach with the presently known poly(2,7-carbazole)s. Therefore, to get a PCE of 10%, new low band gap poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives will have to be developed.

The first mention of the 1,4-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) ring in the literature goes back to the work of Farnum in 1974. They wanted to use a Reformatsky-type reaction to prepare derivative of the 2-azetidinones, but instead got a “brilliant red crystalline compound” which turned out to be a DPP derivative. The synthesis was further developed by several groups and many fields of interest were investigated (Scheme 3).

Despite these interesting features, the DPP core was only recently reported in solar cells. The DPP synthesis is simple and involves few steps. It is also possible to use a variety of aryl groups and substituents on the nitrogen atoms. One of the first DPP polymers (P21, see Table 2) used in organic electronics with significant results was reported by the group of Janssen. Indeed, polymer P21 shows an optical band gap of 1.4 eV with a number-average molecular weight of 20 kg mol−1. They first used a chloroform solution of P21 with PC60BM but they observed a fast evaporation of the solvent leading to an amorphous layer (Scheme 4). They obtained a PCE of only 1.1%. To solve this problem and to improve the efficiency, they used a chloroform/ODCB mixture (4:1) which completely dissolves the polymer and the fullerene. Using optimized conditions (i.e. the utilization of PC70BM), they were able to improve the efficiency up to 4.0% (see Table 2) with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.61 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.58, and short circuit current (Jsc) of 11.3 mA cm−2. These properties were obtained on an active area of 9 mm2. Following this first work on P21, the Janssen's group reported another derivative, P22, using 2-hexyldecyl alkyl chains on the DPP core and no alkyl chains on the thiophene units. They used a Suzuki coupling polymerization to obtain a material with a Mn of 54 kg mol−1. Indeed, the presence of the 2-hexyldecyl side chains improves the solubility of the material. P22 also shows a lower band gap than P21 (1.3 eV compared to 1.4 eV). Field effect transistors (FETs) were made and hole and electron mobilities of 0.04 and 0.01 cm2 V−1s−1 were obtained. Furthermore, BHJ solar cells were first made using a PC60BM fullerene derivative and also using diiodooctane as a processing additive. A PCE of 3.8% was reported. To increase the photocurrent in the visible region, PC60BM was replaced with PC70BM. This change increases the device performance which provided a Voc of 0.65 V, a FF of 0.60, a Jsc of 11.8 mA cm−2, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.7%. Recently, Janssen reported P23 with a benzene ring as the comonomer to further increase the open circuit voltage. Bimodal molecular weights are reported (see Table 2) with a band gap of 1.53 eV. Fabrication of BHJ device while using DIO (diiodooctane) as a processing additive and PC70BM as the acceptor led to a high PCE of 5.5%. This is the highest PCE reported so far for a conjugated polymer within the DPP family. Finally, OFETs were made and mobilities of 0.02 and 0.04 cm2 V−1s−1 were obtained for electrons and holes, respectively.

P24 to P37polymers represent alternative push–pull copolymers using the DPP as the electron deficient unit. P24 was reported by Leclerc's group using a 2,7-carbazole unit copolymerized with a 1,4-diketopyrrolopyrrole moiety. A molecular weight (Mn) of 30 kg mol−1 and an optical band gap of 1.57 eV were obtained (Table 2). FETs were fabricated and a hole mobility up to 0.02 cm2 V−1s−1 was recorded. The first BHJ solar cell reported with copolymer P24 led to an efficiency of 1.6% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a FF of 0.37, and a Jsc of 5.2 mA cm−2. PC60BM was used as the acceptor and the active area was 36 mm2. After optimization of the processing conditions (i.e. the polymer/fullerene ratio, solvent, annealing) new devices were fabricated and a higher efficiency was obtained. On a 1 cm2 active area, a PCE of 3.2% was obtained with a Voc of 0.80 V but with higher fill factor and short circuit current (see Table 2). Changing the octyl alkyl chain for a decyl alkyl chain on both the carbazole and DPP moieties, P25 was able to reach a PCE of 3.8% after optimization such as the utilization of processing additives and anti-reflection layer. Leclerc's group also reported the synthesis of many copolymers combining thiophenes, carbazoles, fluorenes, dibenzosiloles, or dithienylsiloles with the DPP core. Physical and electronic properties were reported, but no results on BHJ solar are yet available. P26, a germafluorene derivative, was also reported. A molecular weight (Mn) of 13 kg mol−1 was obtained with an optical band gap of 1.63 eV. Furthermore, FETs were also reported, and hole mobility of 0.04 cm2 V−1s−1 was reached with an On/Off ratio of 1 × 106. For photovoltaic applications, the best power conversion efficiency reported was 1.5% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a high FF of 0.62 but a low short-circuit current density of 4.10 mA cm−2. This new heterofluorene unit will likely need further investigation to evaluate its potential in photovoltaic devices.
In parallel, Hashimoto et al. also reported similar copolymers; for instance, an alternating copolymer with 2-ethylhexyl side chains on the DPP core and with two n-decyl chains on the carbazole unit (P27). Using those alkyl chains, a high molecular weight (Mn) of 91.3 kg mol−1 with a PDI of 1.7 was obtained. This team also reported the synthesis and characterization of two other copolymers, P28 and P29 (see Table 2), using units such as fluorene or N-alkyldithienopyrrole. Those units possess different electron-donating abilities, so it will have a direct effect on the absorption spectra, energy levels, and photovoltaic performance. The best results were obtained with polymer P27. In fact, they obtained for P27 a PCE of 2.3% with a Voc of 0.76 V. Following their work, Hashimoto et al. later described a new DPP copolymer derivative containing an N-1-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-ethylheptanyl dithienopyrrole unit (P30). They used an n-butyl side chain on the DPP core to enhance the π–π stacking. A number-average molecular weight of 18.4 kg mol−1 and an optical band gap of 1.13 eV were reported for P30. It is noteworthy that this is one of the lowest band gaps reported so far for a DPP copolymer. Fabrication of BHJ solar cells, using PC70BM dissolved in ODCB, followed by an annealing of the film at 150 °C, led to a low Voc of 0.38 V but a high Jsc of 14.87 mA cm−2. A PCE of 2.7% on an active area of 6 mm2 was reached.

Polymers
P31–P33 were reported by the group of Yang. In their paper, they compared several DPP copolymers in terms of optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties. The utilization of those units did permit a good modulation of the absorption and electronic properties of the resulting polymers. They reported the synthesis of some copolymers with electron-rich (push) units such as dithienosilole (P31), benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (P32), and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (P33). All polymers were obtained by a Stille coupling polymerization, using dibromo-DPP derivatives with the appropriate di-stannate derivatives. For polymers P31–P33, molecular weights (Mn) over 20 kg mol−1 were obtained with polydispersity indexes ranging from 2.1 to 2.8. Optical band gaps of the polymer films are about 1.3 eV (see Table 2). All of the devices were made using an ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymers: PC70BM (1:2 w/w)/Ca/Al (10/80 nm) configuration under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2, and with a surface area of 9.5 mm2. The best PCE was obtained for P33. While annealing the active layer for 30 min at 110 °C under an inert atmosphere, they were able to reach a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%, with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 10.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.62. For polymers P31 and P32, PCEs of 2.1% and 2.5% was obtained, respectively.

Polymers
P34 and P35 were reported by Ting et al. First, an unusual electron-rich (push) unit, the TPT (thiophene/phenylene/thiophene) moiety, was copolymerized with the DPP unit. TPT is not frequently used, but its forced coplanarity and the possible tailoring of the morphology and processability through the hexaryl group can bring good performances in both FET and BHJ devices.P34 was obtained by a Stille coupling polymerization of the TPT stannate derivative with the dibrominated DPP monomer. Molecular weights, polydispersity indexes, and optical band gaps are reported in Table 2. FETs were evaluated with the material, and a hole mobility of 2.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1 with an On/Off ratio of 1.8 × 104 has been reached. Using PC70BM as the acceptor, a power conversion efficiency of 4.2% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.54 was obtained. The surface area of this device was 4 mm2. Later, P35 was reported as a two dimensional (2-D) like conjugated polymer. Conjugated side chains have been developed to enhance charge transport as well as the BHJ device performances by broadening the absorption spectrum. Properties of 2-D conjugated side chains have yet to be explored. A Stille coupling polymerisation in microwave conditions did afford P35 with a Mn of 10 kg mol−1 and a PDI of 1.9. The optical band gap of P35 still follows other DPP-based copolymers with a low value at 1.29 eV. Using top-contact FET device configuration, a hole mobility up to 0.15 cm2 V−1s−1 was calculated with On/Off ratio of 2.5 × 104. After optimization of the processing conditions and the donor/acceptor ratios, a PCE of 2.4% with a FF of 0.37, a Voc of 0.64 V, and a Jsc of 7.02 mA cm−2 was obtained.
Other groups also reported the synthesis of DPP-based copolymers (P36–P37) using benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene and cyclopentadithiophene as comonomers. PCEs of 2.8% and 2.3% were reached for polymers P36 and P37, respectively. Full study of the donor/acceptor ratio was undertaken to optimize the device performance.
In conclusion, DPP-based polymers are newcomers in the field of organic electronics. Their HOMO/LUMO energy levels, band gaps, and high hole/electron mobilities reported so far make these materials highly promising for different applications. It should not be surprising to see much better PCEs with such polymers in the near future.

Early reports on poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) by Sotzing showed a very low band gap material (Eg = 1.2 eV) with good electrical properties. The monomer seems to have a low oxidation potential for polymerization and was thus studied for applications in LEDs and electrochromic devices. The Ferraris' group also reported the synthesis of poly(2-phenylthieno-[3,4-b]thiophene). The monomer was synthesized in only two steps. The polymerization was carried out by repetitive oxidative electrochemical cycles of a saturated solution of the 2-phenylthieno-[3,4-b]thiophene monomer. An optical band gap of a 0.85 eV was obtained. Later, Pomerantz reported a poly(2-decylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene-4,6-diyl) which was obtained by a FeCl3 oxidative polymerization. A number-average molecular weight of 52 kg mol−1 with an optical band gap of 0.92 eV was obtained.

A few years later, Yang's group reported the first poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) derivative (polymer P38) used in a near-infrared photodetector (Table 3). It has been shown that the utilization of a fused thiophene ring such as the thienothiophene ring can stabilize the quinoid structure of the backbone and can therefore reduce the band gap of the system. They also used an ester group at the 2-position to stabilize the electron-rich thienothiophene ring and to further increase the solubility of the polymer. Using a Stille polycondensation reaction, a number-average molecular weight of 11.8 kg mol−1 was obtained. As for previous thienothiophene polymers, P38 is also a low band gap polymer with an optical band gap of 1.3 eV. Finally, a PCE of 1% was reported using a monochromatic light source of λ = 850 nm.

Later, Yu et al. reported P39 another thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based copolymer incorporating a benzodithiophene unit. The synthesis of this thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit is really straightforward. Starting from thiophene, the dibrominated monomer is obtained after five steps. Then, a Stille polycondensation reaction between the ester-substituted 2,5-dibromothieno[3,4-b]thiophene comonomer and the dialkoxylbenzodithiophene distannate monomer led to polymer P39 with a molecular weight of 18 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index of 1.3. An optical band gap of 1.58 eV was calculated. Photovoltaic properties of P39 were first tested using an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC60BM/Ca/Al configuration. A very interesting PCE of 4.7% was reported. Moreover, switching to PC70BM, which is known to have a higher absorption coefficient in the visible region, gave a better power conversion efficiency. Indeed, a PCE of 5.6%, a Voc of 0.56 V, a FF of 0.63, and a Jsc of 15.6 mA cm−2 were obtained. The optimal band gap, the rigidity, and planarity of the backbone, and the network morphology can explain those high efficiencies.
To further study the impact of the side chains on the electronic properties, the solubility, and the morphology of the blend, Yu et al. reported a series of five new copolymers (P40 to P44). They used alkyl side chains such as n-octyl, n-octyloxy, or 2-ethylhexyloxy on the benzodithiophene unit and n-octyl, 2-butyloctyl, 2-ethylhexyl, or n-dodecyl on the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene moiety. It is important to note that P42 has a fluorine atom at the 3-position. The fluorine atom is relatively small and has a strong electronegativity. Thus, the introduction of the fluorine should have an effect on the electronic properties by lowering both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The synthetic pathway for this last derivative is different. All materials possess a molecular weight between 15 and 18 kg mol−1. Besides the use of different alkyl of alkyloxy side chains, optical band gaps of the material remained approximately the same for all polymers (∼1.6 eV). BHJ devices were made using PC60BM with an active area of 9.5 mm2. Data of the polymer solar cells are reported in Table 3. Polymer P42 shows the highest Voc (0.74 V) and the best PCE (6.1%). These other derivatives (P39, P40, P41, P43, P44) show high efficiency (above 2%) with Voc ranging from 0.58 V to 0.72 V, FF higher than 0.43, and Jsc between 7.74 and 13.9 mA cm−2. TEM experiments showed that P43 and P44 have a non-optimized morphology which led to lower performances. In fact, bulky side chains reduce the miscibility of the polymer with the PC60BM, so the interfacial areas of charge separation are reduced.

P45 was reported by Li's group and shows good performance in solar cells. As shown in Schemes 5 and 6, the ester group at the 2-position on the thienothiophene ring was replaced by a ketone group. This modification decreases the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and thereby increases the Voc in the BHJ solar cells. Molecular weight and optical band gap are almost the same for P39 to P45 (see Table 3). However, the best cell with polymer P45 revealed a very high PCE of 6.6% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a FF of 0.64, and a Jsc of 14.7 mA cm−2. The photovoltaic measurements were made using PC70BM under an active area of 10 mm2.

Polymer
P46 shows good solubility in organic solvents owing to the branched side chains on both the ester group and the benzodithiophene moiety which ultimately led to a number average molecular weights of 46.6 kg mol−1 with a PDI of 2.1 (Table 3). In BHJ solar cells, while using PC70BM as the acceptor and chlorobenzene (CB) as the solvent, a PCE of 3.9% was obtained. By adding processing additives such as 3% DIO (diiodooctane), the efficiency greatly improved and reached 7.4%. TEM measurements show that this dramatic increase of the PCE is mainly caused by the change of the morphology in the film. Indeed, films prepared using CB and DIO are more uniform which will increase the exciton migration in the donor/acceptor interphase.
In the same series, recent studies provided polymers P47 and P48. Photovoltaic characterization led to a PCE of 5.1% for polymer P47 (with the ester group at the 2-position of the thienothiophene ring). BHJ devices tested with polymer P48, which possesses a ketone group and a fluorine atom on the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene ring, reached a PCE of 7.7%. This value remains the best reported so far for a fully characterized polymer solar cell. High Voc of 0.76 V, Jsc of 15.2 and a FF of 0.67 were also obtained. Interestingly, Solarmer recently reported a NREL-certified PCE of 8.1% for, most probably, a similar copolymer.
The thieno[3,4-b]thiophene core was also copolymerized with alkyl-substituted thiophenes. To modulate the opto-electronic properties, Yu et al. synthesized a regiorandom copolymer (P49). It is important to note that a perfluroalkyl chain was put on the thienothiophene ring to mimic the electron-withdrawing effect of an ester group. Number-average molecular weights over 13 kg mol−1 were obtained. The optical band gap of P49 (1.62 eV) is in agreement with the previous copolymers using benzodithiophene units. Photovoltaic experiments were carried out with an ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer:PC60BM/Al configuration on an active area of 3.14 mm2. Interestingly, a PCE of 2.4% was reached for P49 with a high Jsc of 10.22 mA cm−2 but with lower values for Voc (0.59 V), and FF (0.40).

Polymers
P50–P54 were synthesized by varying the ratio of the alkyl-dithiophene monomer to study their impact on the absorption spectra and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymers.Polymerizations with a Stille reaction led to materials with number-average molecular weights above 45 kg mol−1. Depending upon the alkylthiophene ratio, band gaps ranging from 1.22 to 1.78 eV were obtained (see Table 3). Likewise, PCEs are also influenced by the thiophene ratio and are ranging from 0.7% for P50 to 1.8% for P54.
Poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene) derivatives have demonstrated an excellent potential in organic photovoltaics. In fact, this class of materials showed PCEs moving 1% to over 8% in a very short time. Nevertheless, to further enhance these values and their potential for industrial applications, new simple copolymers should probably be designed.


Thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione- (or dioxypyrrolothiophene, DOPT) based polymers were first reported by Tour and Zhang in the late 90's. They used a strong electron-donating moieties (N,N-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,4-diamino thiophene derivative) with this strong electron-withdrawing unit to generate zwitterion-like interaction. At that time, the synthesis of the DOPT units involved many reaction steps. Polymers were obtained by using modified conditions of the Stille cross-coupling reaction. Later, Tour and Zhang reported a series of polythiophenes (push/pull) synthesized by step-growth polymerization that allowed good charge transfer while reducing the band gaps. A number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 5.9 kg mol−1 was reached for a polymer containing N,N′-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3,4-diamino-2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene and 3,4-(N-n-butylimido)-2,5-dibromothiophene comonomers. Homopolymers were studied by Pomerantz. Molecular weights of 13 kg mol−1 and an absorption maximum of 539 nm in the solid state were reported for a homopolymer. By analyzing those experimental results and using molecular calculations, it was concluded that those polymers are likely co-planar. Another study by Bjørnholm reported the synthesis and characterization of another DOPT homopolymer. Apart from a few modifications in the synthetic scheme to obtain the DOPT monomer, they mainly discuss the UV-vis absorption data and X-ray diffraction of their homopolymer. Considering those results, they suggested that π-stacking can be efficient in the DOPT system.

The actual synthesis of the DOPT monomer is now much more convenient and involves only four steps. Starting from the 3,4-dicarboxylic acid thiophene, a ring closure reaction with acetic anhydride affords the 1H,3H-thieno[3,4-c]furan-1,3-dione. A reaction with an alkyl amine gives the 4[N-alkylamino]carbonyl]-3-thiophenecarboxylic acid intermediate. In fact, it is possible to fine tune the solubility and the processability of the copolymers by introducing different alkyl chains on the nitrogen atom. Then, the 5-(alkyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (DOPT) unit is obtained upon heating to reflux in the presence of thionyl chloride. Finally, to get the monomer, the DOPT unit undergoes a bromination reaction (H2SO4, CF3CO2H, NBS, 24 h) to yield the dibromo DOPT derivative (Scheme 7).
Leclerc et al. was the first group to report the utilization of DOPT in polymer solar cells.P55a was synthesized by a Stille coupling with the 1,3-dibromo-5-octyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (DOPT) monomer and the 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) comonomer. A number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 13 kg mol−1 was obtained. It was found that the presence of the 2-ethylhexyloxy chain on the BDT unit enhanced the solubility of the polymer. An optical band gap of 1.81 was calculated for the polymer in the solid state. BHJ devices were fabricated using a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTPD:PC70BM/LiF/Al configuration under AM1.5G illumination with an active area of 100 mm2. While using a P55a:PC70BM 1:2 ratio power conversion efficiency of 5.5% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a FF of 0.66 and a Jsc of 9.81 mA cm−2 has been reached (Table 4). Those preliminary results first revealed the great potential of this new class of conjugated polymers.

Almost at the same time, Jen et al. reported the same polymer, P55b. They obtained a higher molecular weight (Mn of 33 kg mol−1) but got approximately the same band gap of 1.82 eV. BHJ devices have been tested in two ways, in a conventional (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTPD:PC70BM/LiF/Al), and an inverted type (ITO/ZnO/C70-SAM/PBDTTPD:PC70BM(1:2)/PEDOT:PSS/Ag). While also using PC70BM for a stronger light absorption in the visible region, they reached a PCE of 4.1% in the conventional type devices. They further increased this value by using a SAM-C70 modified surface in an inverted configuration. PCE of 4.2% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a FF of 0.54 and a Jsc of 9.1 mA cm−2 was reported. A hole mobility of 4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1 was calculated for P55b.

P55c
–
P57 were later reported by Fréchet et al. Three different alkyl side chains (n-octyl for P55c, 2-ethylhexyl for P56, and 3,7-dimethyloctyl for P57) were investigated on the DOPT moiety (Scheme 8). Molecular weights between 35 and 42 kg mol−1 were calculated. First photovoltaic devices were made using PC60BM and PCE of 2.8% and 3.9% was obtained for P56 and P57. When adding a processing additive such as diiodooctane (DIO) into the blend, higher PCEs were obtained such as 4.0% and 5.7% for P56 and P57, respectively. For P55c, the utilization of DIO didn't improve the PCE, suggesting that a certain level of order is already present into the blend. Finally, GIXS experiments show the impact of the alkyl groups (on the DOPT unit) which induce structural order and orientation in the polymer backbones, which, ultimately, affect the device performance.
Recently, Xie et al. reported two other DOPT derivatives with different alkyl side chains on the nitrogen atom, a 2-octyldodecyl (P58) and a 2-ethylhexyl group (P59). Number-average molecular weights above 40 kg mol−1 were obtained for both polymers with an optical band gap of 1.84 eV (see Table 4). BHJ devices were fabricated with PC70BM as acceptor and PCEs of 3.4% and 4.8% were reached for P58 and P59 respectively while using 2% DIO as a solvent additive. It is worth noting that high Voc was obtained (above 0.90 V) for both devices. However, without DIO, much lower PCEs are observed such as 1.9% for P58 and 1.5% for P59. Therefore, the addition of 2% DIO seems to have a certain effect of control over the morphology of the blend.
To further explore the DOPT system, Leclerc group reported a series of new polymers, P60–P67. They have studied the influence of the alkyl side chain on the morphology, solubility, and charge mobility of DOPT-based polymers. Indeed, four types of polymers were reported: the first type has no thiophene spacer between the benzodithiophene unit and the DOPT unit (P60 and P61), the second type possesses a thiophene spacer (P62), the third one has a thiophene spacer bearing alkyl chain facing the DOPT unit (P63, P64 and P66), and finally the last type has a thiophene spacer bearing alkyl chain that does not face the DOPT unit (P65 and P67). All polymers were prepared by a Stille cross-coupling polymerisation reaction. As reported in Table 4, there is practically no effect of the length/type nor of the position of the alkyl side chain of the thiophene unit on the optical band gap of the polymers. Polymers P60 and P61 show good photovoltaic results with PCEs of 2.6 and 4.8% respectively. While adding a thiophene spacer between the benzodithiophene and the DOPT units (P62), PCE drastically decreased to 0.9%. On the other hand, with alkyl side chain on the thiophene unit as for P63, P64, and P66, power conversion efficiencies over 3% were obtained: 3.9% for P63, 3.5% for P64, and 3.6% for P66. All data are reported in Table 4. Finally, P65 and P67 show a really poor PCE (0.2% and 0.7% for P65 and P67 respectively). Those results can be explained by the completely different morphology obtained for the blends. In fact, AFM analyses show the formation of “donut” shapes which influence the percolation pathways and seriously limit the transport of the charges to the corresponding electrodes.
Wei et al. reported another DOPT polymer derivative (P68). They copolymerised by a Stille cross-coupling condensation the DOPT unit with a bi(dodecyl)-thiophene rigid fused-ring to enhance the crystallinity and to keep a low HOMO energy level. Interestingly, while comparing polymer P68 with previous similar polymers (P55a to P67), the utilization of a bithiophene moiety instead of a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit does not seem to influence the band gap of the resulting material. By using an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P68:PC60BM/Al configuration, a PCE of 4.7% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 8.02 mA.cm2, and a FF of 0.62 was reached (see Table 4).
Watson and Jenekhe et al. reported a series of DOPT polymers (P69 to P71) using dialkoxybithiophene and cyclopentadithiophene as comonomers. These polymers were prepared by a Stille polymerization reaction and number-average molecular weight (Mn) between 32 and 64 kg mol−1 with a PDI between 2.0 and 4.7 was obtained (see Table 4). It is worth noting that the presence of an alkyloxy side chain on the thiophene unit led to a quite low band gap (1.50 eV). Photovoltaic measurements show poor results for polymers P69 and P70 with PCE under 1.5%. The authors explain those results by the poor charge transport properties and the non-optimized morphology of the films. Nevertheless, when using the cyclopentadithiophene unit instead of the dialkoxybithiophene, better results were obtained. Indeed, a PCE of 3.0% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a FF of 0.5 and a Jsc of 8.12 mA cm−2 was reached for polymer P71.
Finally, Tao and Leclerc et al. have found a new polymer with a PCE of above 7% using the DOPT unit copolymerized with a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole moiety (P72). This polymer prepared by a Stille cross-coupling polymerization shows good molecular weights and solubility in organic solvents. Interestingly, when blended with PC70BM, this low band gap polymer (1.69 eV) was able to reach a PCE of 7.3% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 12.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.68. A PCE of 6.1% was obtained for a 200 nm thick active layer. A thicker active layer improves the light absorption maximum and also grants a better production yield during a possible roll-to-roll printing process.
To sum up, DOPT polymers used in organic photovoltaic had just been reported in early 2010. Even so, PCEs over 7% have now been obtained with this young class of polymers. One can think of a bright future for the DOPT but many derivatives will have to be tested to achieve a 10% power conversion efficiency.

In summary, four important classes of conjugated polymers have been presented. Polymers in each of those classes have shown interesting results. Indeed, high PCEs were reached for P7 (7.1%), P23 (5.5%), P48 (7.7%), and P72 (7.3%). However, further work need to be done to improve the power conversion efficiencies near the 10% target. So, what is next?

After years of intensive interdisciplinary research, some basic rules have become clear for designing an efficient p-type material for solar cell applications. First, the material should possess a relatively low optical band gap (1.2–1.9 eV) and have strong optical absorption in the solar spectral range. Secondly, the material should have a low-lying HOMO energy level to offer high open circuit voltage (Voc). Thirdly, the energy offset between the LUMO energy levels of the p-type polymer and the n-type acceptor (not necessarily a fullerene derivative) should be well controlled to be just large enough to provide a driving force for efficient charge separation and not to cause too much energy loss. Fourthly, the material should have a good hole mobility for efficient charge transport. Finally, the material should own good solubility in organic solvents for solution processing. If one follows these designing rules and obtains an optimized and stable morphology, a PCE of 10% should be reached.
However, there is another important parameter that should be considered and is related to the thickness of the active layers. Up to now, most published results have been obtained with active layers of about 80–100 nm but for industrial processes, thicker active layers should be investigated. A thicker active layer will not only give us the access to stronger light absorption but will also guarantee a high production yield during roll-to-roll printing production, which is critically important for industrial applications. If all those requirements are filled, one can soon glimpse of a bright future for the plastic solar cells. In this regard, the recent DOPT-based polymers might become an important class of both p-type and n-type materials.
