Three compounds consisting of the electron-donating triphenylamine–phenothiazine conjugate backbone and each of the electron-withdrawing groups 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indandione have been synthesized and used as donors in blends with [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) for organic solar cell devices. After improvements of the active layer structure by a selected donor-to-acceptor weight ratio and a two-step solvent and thermal annealing, the organic solar cells showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) values in the range of 4.79–7.25%. The highest PCE was obtained for the bulk heterojunction device with the indandione compound, which can be attributed to its better absorption profile, higher crystallinity, more balanced electron and hole transport, higher charge collection efficiency and reduced recombination, in comparison with the photovoltaic cells from the other two compounds. DFT-calculated characteristics, absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry of the compounds, along with X-ray diffraction patterns of the blend films, are used to validate the photovoltaic results.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention owing to their potential low-cost, light weight, flexibility and solution processability. By significant innovations in active layer materials, interfacial materials, and device processing technologies, PCEs above 12% have been achieved in both single-junction and tandem organic solar cells. The typical OSC is a blend of electron donor (polymer or ‘small molecule’) and electron acceptor (fullerene and non-fullerene derivative) materials. Although OSCs made from polymers are very promising, with PCEs over 12%, OSCs from small molecules (SMs) appear to have several advantages such as their well-defined chemical structure, and less batch-to-batch variation in their chemical synthesis and purification, and in SC preparation. The PCEs of small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) are steadily catching up with the high-performing polymer-based OSCs, reaching values in the range of 10–12%. However, there is a great interest for new ideal small molecule materials to further improve the PCEs and address device durability, which are major concerns for the commercialization of this technology.

Intensive research has been devoted to the design and synthesis of new SM donors with small optical band gaps and broad absorption profiles, and suitable electronic energy levels for high and balanced charge transfer properties. The design also entails considerations of molecular interactions for sufficient crystallinity and suitable size of SM aggregates in the blend with an acceptor, as well as of molecular interactions that result in energy-level alterations at the organic/electrode interfaces. The molecular design strategy to approach at least the absorption and energy level goals has generally been to apply the “push–pull” or “donor–acceptor (D–A)” concept where the subunits are combined in different sequences such as A–D–A, D–A–D and extended A–D–A′–D–A and D–A–D′–A–D. Currently, all the high-performing small molecules have symmetric chemical structures and are based on the above frameworks. Breaking the symmetry of the aforementioned motifs results in the generation of asymmetric D–A, D–A–D′, A–D–A′, D–D′–A and D–A–A′ type molecules with pronounced dipolarity, which are interesting alternatives to their counterparts. These systems are relatively less explored and their photovoltaic performances are lagging behind those of SCs from symmetric SMs. For asymmetric molecules, the molecular dipole moment has been correlated to their orientation and assembly, and to material morphology associated with photovoltaic parameters. A significant dipole moment might be expected to result in extensive self-assembly and formation of too large aggregates in relation to the exciton diffusion length (ca. 5–15 nm) in normal organic materials. However, if appropriate side groups and bends in the main SM skeleton are introduced, the aggregation may not become an obstacle. Further, polar molecules can self-assemble in antiparallel structures, which reduces the polar character of each dimer in a growing aggregate. An example is the formation of centrosymmetric dimers of polar merocyanines, disclosed by X-ray diffraction and 2D-NMR, where the individual dipole moments of those molecules are cancelled out by the antiparallel orientation. Another example is reported for p-DTS(BTTh2)2 molecules, where partial cancelation of the net dipole of dimers is suggested on the basis of PV results and DFT-optimized geometry of the dimers. Other interesting studies including asymmetric SMs are as follows: Demeter et al. investigated a series of symmetric and asymmetric septithiophenes end-capped with malononitrile and thiobarbituric electron-withdrawing groups for OSCs. It was found that breaking the symmetry of the donor structure can lead to a significant increase of Voc, which may be attributed to the intermolecular interactions and molecular orientation. Huang et al. reported four asymmetric molecules with varying terminal units and found that the increase in the donor-to-PC71BM dipolarity difference adversely influenced the donor-to-PC71BM phase-separation. Besides this, asymmetric small molecules based on the building blocks diketopyrrolopyrrole, benzothiadiazole, indenothiophene, squaraine, and triphenylamine have been reported for use in OSCs.
In this context, we report the design, synthesis and study of optical and electrochemical properties of three D–D′–A type asymmetric SMs denoted as M1, M2 and M3, which are based on the phenothiazine core and the terminal groups 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indandione, respectively (Fig. 1). These small molecules were used as the donor along with PC71BM as an acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ-OSCs. After optimization of the active-layer structure with the selected donor to acceptor ratio and two step annealing (solvent additive followed by thermal annealing) process, PCE values of 4.79%, 6.18%, and 7.25% were achieved for the OSCs based on the M1, M2 and M3 donor, respectively. The variation in PCE as a result of acceptor group in the donors and related factors are discussed.

All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, and TCI chemicals. Solvents were HPLC grade and used as received. Dry dichloromethane, THF, and DMF were collected from a PureSolv micro solvent purification system containing a column with activated aluminium oxide under argon. Flash chromatography was performed using a Biotage Isolera One instrument with Biotage SNAP Column. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker AVANCE III 400 and 600 MHz spectrometers. High resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) data were recorded using an Agilent 1290 binary LC System connected to an Agilent 6230 Accurate-Mass TOF LC/MS (ESI+). Elemental analyses were carried out using an EA 1108 CHNS-O elemental analyzer at Mikroanalytisches Laboratorium, Univ. of Vienna. UV-Vis absorption spectra (Lambda 35 UV-Vis spectrometer, Perkin-Elmer) were recorded on 1 × 10−5 M solutions of the small molecules in chloroform, using a quartz cuvette with 10 mm path length (PerkinElmer). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q1000, TA Instruments) and thermogravimetry (TGA, Q5000IR, TA Instruments) were conducted under a N2 atmosphere with a heating and cooling rate of 10 K min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed on an electrochemistry workstation Autolab PGSTAT302, Metrohm. All measurements were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration employing a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (NBu4BF4, 0.1 M) in dichloromethane was used as the supporting electrolyte, and the scan rate was 100 mV s−1. The redox couple Fc/Fc+vs. vacuum was measured to be −4.51 eV in this system.

Compound 3 was reacted with 4 under palladium-mediated Suzuki coupling reaction conditions to prepare intermediate compound 5. Subsequently, Knoevenagel condensation of 5 and 3-ethylrhodanine or malononitrile or 1,3-indandione resulted in M1, M2, and M3 respectively. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the intermediates and target compounds are given as ESI.

Under protection of Ar flow, Pd(PPh3)4 (56 mg, 48 μmol) was added. The mixture was refluxed under Ar for 24 hours. Then, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, and washed with water and brine. The obtained organic phase was dried by anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated and purified on a silica column with petroleum ether:ethyl acetate (8:2) as eluent to yield a yellow solid (370 mg, 78%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 9.80 (s, 1H), δ 7.66 (dd, J = 8.4, 1.9 Hz, 1H), 7.63 (d, J = 1.9 Hz, 1H), 7.44–7.32 (m, 4H), 7.30–7.22 (m, 4H), 7.16–7.08 (m, 6H), 7.07–6.99 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 6.94 (dd, J = 8.4, 2.5 Hz, 2H), 3.81 (d, 2H), 2.01–1.90 (m, 1H), 1.53–1.36 (m, 4H), 1.32–1.27 (m, 4H), 0.95–0.78 (m, 6H).

Compound 5 (100 mg, 0.171 mmol) and 3-ethylrhodanine (41.5 mg, 0.257 mmol) were dissolved in dry chloroform (30 mL). Then, three drops of piperidine were added and the resulting solution was stirred overnight at 60 °C under argon. The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane and water. The collected organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was separated by column chromatography using dichloromethane:hexane (1:1) as eluent to afford a red solid (100 mg, 80%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 7.60 (s, 1H), 7.47–7.36 (m, 4H), 7.35–7.27 (m, 6H), 7.18–7.10 (m, 6H), 7.06 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 6.93 (dd, J = 8.5, 4.0 Hz, 2H), 4.22 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H), 3.82 (br s, 2H), 1.98 (m, 1H), 1.52–1.39 (m, 4H), 1.34–1.26 (m, 7H), 0.94–0.87 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 192.84, 167.68, 148.12, 147.63, 147.15, 142.87, 136.15, 133.53, 132.16, 130.71, 129.57, 129.31, 127.59, 127.19, 126.32, 125.66, 124.99, 124.44, 123.90, 122.99, 120.20, 116.62, 116.02, 51.32, 39.80, 36.11, 30.61, 28.54, 23.94, 23.05, 14.04, 12.30, 10.50.

The crude product was separated by column chromatography (silica gel, chloroform) to afford M3 as a dark brown solid (120 mg, 75%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 8.44 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H), 8.37 (dd, J = 8.8, 2.1 Hz, 1H), 8.04–7.91 (m, 2H), 7.83–7.78 (m, 2H), 7.78–7.74 (m, 1H) 7.44 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.38 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 2H), 7.30–7.28 (m, 4H), 7.18–7.08 (m, 6H), 7.06 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 2H), 7.00–6.94 (m, 2H), 3.85 (b, 2H), 2.07–1.88 (m, 1H), 1.52–1.37 (m, 4H), 1.32–1.24 (m, 4H), 0.92–0.81 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 190.83, 189.55, 147.6, 147.2, 145.7, 142.4, 140.04, 136.4, 135.4, 135.0, 134.8, 133.5, 129.3, 127.3, 126.5, 125.6, 124.5, 124.0, 123.0, 116.8, 116.75, 115.6, 115.5, 51.50, 36.33, 30.59, 28.53, 23.91, 23.05, 14.02, 10.49. ESI-TOF MS [M + H]+ found: 711.3040, calculated: 711.3040.


The quantum chemical modelling of M1–M3 was performed with the Gaussian 09 (rev. D.01) software, using density functional theory (DFT) and the B3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation functional with the 6-31G(d) basis set for geometry optimizations. Energy minima were confirmed by frequency calculations and the absence of negative frequency values. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) was applied to calculate excitation energies for an optimized geometry, and this calculation was solved for twelve singlet excited states. The 2-ethylhexyl group in the PTZ unit was replaced by a methyl group in the structures of M1–M3 to shorten computational time. The Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) in Gaussian was applied to simulate a solvent cavity around the solute. Molecular orbitals are visualized with Gauss-view. For each molecule, various conformations were optimized, and the data for the one with the lowest energy are reported.


The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(M1 or M2 or M3):PC71BM/PFN/Al, as shown in Fig. 5. PFN (poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]) was used as an interfacial layer for the cathode. The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min and dried in ambient conditions. A thin film of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P Al 4083) was spin-coated onto ITO glass and baked at 120 °C for 10 min in an ambient atmosphere and then cooled down to room temperature. The photoactive layer was formed by spin-coating a blend chloroform solution of M1 or M2 or M3:PC71BM (in different weight ratios) onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The total concentration of SMs:PC71BM was kept to 18 mg mL−1 for each active layer. For the two-step annealing (TSA), the active layer was thermally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature. The active layer was subsequently kept in a Petri disc in a chamber filled with a CS2 solution for 10 min. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by the spinning speed during the spin coating of the active layer and was in the range 90 ± 5 nm. Finally, the aluminium (Al) top electrode was thermally deposited on the active layer at a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask of area 20 mm2. All devices were fabricated and tested in the ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The hole-only and electron-only devices with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/M1 or M2 or M3:PC71BM/Au and ITO/Al/M1 or M2 or M3:PC71BM/Al architectures were also fabricated in an analogous way in order to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. The current–voltage characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to give the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured illuminating the device using the light source coupled with monochromators and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.


In our D–D′–A molecular design, a larger conjugated donor backbone was chosen relative to a smaller acceptor moiety to facilitate a substantial electron redistribution from the donor to the acceptor at photoexcitation. Further, the ‘propeller’ structure of TPA and the bent shape of PTZ made these units suitable to avoid a larger part of the SMs being planar, therefore probably reducing the risk of excessive aggregation and formation of too large SM domains in the active layer with PC71BM. The choice of the 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indandione groups was based on their known acceptor strength and common use for the same purpose in many other D–A compounds, which could be beneficial for comparisons with similar OSC studies.

Four structures of M1 (two configurations and two conformations of each configuration) and two conformers of M2 and M3 each, which differed by double-bond orientation or rotation of the electron withdrawing group (EWG), were geometry-optimized by B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations (Table S1, ESI). With structure ‘1’ being that of lowest energy, structures 2 have only 0.5–1.4 kJ mol−1 higher energy compared to structure 1, suggesting that structures 2 also contribute to the spectral and other properties reported here. For M1, the two additional structures 3 and 4 were found at 15 and 16 kJ mol−1 higher energy compared to structure 1, and therefore only structures 1 and 2 of M1 need to be considered for possible variation in the measured data. All geometry-optimized structures exhibit a similar characteristic bent form of the PTZ unit. The nodal plane of the π-systems of the terminal electron-withdrawing groups in M1–M3 are nearly coplanar with the adjacent benzenoid ring of the PTZ unit, while there is a dihedral angle of 35° between the other PTZ benzenoid ring and the phenylene unit of the TPA group. For all three compounds, the HOMO is mainly distributed over the TPA–PTZ conjugated system, while the LUMO is spread over the terminal acceptor units and on the nearby ring atoms of the PTZ unit, as shown in Fig. 2. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of M1, M2 and M3 are, in units of eV: −4.97/−2.42, −5.08/−2.63, and −4.93/−2.39, respectively. Although DFT calculations of this type can give results that differ substantially from experimental data, these energy levels did support the idea that the SMs would have both HOMO and LUMO energies suitable for blends with PC71BM. TD-DFT calculations resulted in two excitations at wavelengths (λexc) above 400 nm and oscillator strengths (f) in the range of 0.14–0.28 for all three SMs. The long-wavelength excitation at ca. 539, 565 and 546 nm for M1, M2 and M3, respectively, mainly corresponds to a HOMO-to-LUMO transition, while the excitations in the range of 468–477 nm are mainly described by HOMO−1-to-LUMO transitions with a small contribution from HOMO-to-LUMO in the case of M1 and M3. The third excitation with f above 0.1 for all three molecules appears in the range 360–372 nm and has f values in the range 0.67–1.03. All singlet excitations above 300 nm with f larger than 0.1 are given in Table S2, ESI.
To reliably estimate and understand the electron-withdrawing strength of an acceptor from a SC perspective prior to the synthesis would be quite advantageous. A way to estimate the electron-withdrawing strength of an acceptor for a specific process of photoexcitation is to apply a method for calculation of the electron distribution in both the ground state and the excited states that are involved in the exciton formation. In this study, we have utilized the B3LYP/6-31G(d) Mulliken charges for the ground state and the first excited state (which correspond to the HOMO-to-LUMO transition and a charge transfer (CT) absorption band) to get an estimate of the difference in electron-withdrawing strength of the acceptors in M1–M3. For this, we have taken the sum of the Mulliken charges for all atoms in the acceptor group, including the methine group that connects the TPA–PTZ unit to the acceptor. (Accordingly, the sum of the charges in the TPA–PTZ donor unit is the same as in the acceptor group but with a positive sign.) The total charges obtained in this way for the acceptor group in M1, M2 and M3 in the ground state are −0.188, −0.261 and −0.232, respectively. The corresponding values for the vertically excited state are −0.540, −0.669 and −0.673. This results in the GS-to-excited-state charge differences of −0.325, −0.408 and −0.441 for the acceptor group in M1, M2 and M3, respectively. The increased electron density is thus 25% from M1 to M2 and 8% from M2 to M3, which suggests that indandione is the strongest electron acceptor in the sense that it accumulates more electron density than the other two upon photoexcitation, for further exciton development to free charge carriers, which may translate to better Jsc and FF values.

The normalized optical absorption spectra of the small molecules (M1, M2, and M3) in dilute chloroform solution and thin film cast from the chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 3a and b, and the optical data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, all three small molecules showed two absorption bands: one located in the shorter wavelength region (300–400 nm) attributed to a π–π* transition, and one in the visible region (450–650 nm) assigned to the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) from the TPA–PTZ conjugate backbone to the terminal acceptor unit in the SMs. The ICT band of M3 is significantly red shifted (28 nm) relative to that of M1 and M2. The compounds have rather high molecular absorption coefficients (ε) in the range of 2.7–3.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for this absorption. For the thin films, the absorption bands of the compounds are red-shifted and significantly broadened towards lower energies compared to the solution spectra. All three films showed a vibronic shoulder at a longer wavelength, indicating enhanced π–π stacking interactions and some ordered structure in the solid state. The spectrum of M3 exhibits a more pronounced vibronic shoulder compared to those of M1 and M2, indicating a more ordered molecular packing and stronger crystalline properties for M3, presumably linked to the planar indandione π-system. The optical bandgaps of the compounds were determined from the absorption onset in the thin-film absorption spectra and are 1.93 eV, 1.90 eV, and 1.74 eV for M1, M2, and M3, respectively. The smaller optical bandgap of M3 compared to the M1 and M2 bandgaps appears to be due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor in M3.

The electrochemical properties of these small molecules were investigated using cyclic voltammetry. The voltammograms are shown in Fig. 4, and the derived HOMO and LUMO energy levels are compiled in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels of M1, M2 and M3 were estimated from the onsets of oxidation potentials while the LUMO energy levels were calculated according to ELUMO = EHOMO − Eoptg, where Eoptg is the optical band gap. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of M1, M2 and M3 are estimated to be −5.21/−3.03 eV, −5.31/−3.16 eV, and −5.28/−3.26 eV respectively. An energy level diagram with the components of the BHJ OSCs is shown in Fig. 5. On the basis of the HOMO energy levels of M1–M3, we expect different open circuit voltages for M1, M2 and M3 and a highest Voc for the device based on the M2 BHJ organic solar cell. On the whole, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels for these SMs match well with that for PC71BM for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer from donor to acceptor. Thus, it appears that M1–M3 can function as donors for bulk heterojunction OSCs along with PC71BM as the acceptor.

The BHJ solar cells using these small molecules with PC71BM as the acceptor were fabricated in chloroform as the processing solvent. The weight ratio of donor to acceptor was varied from 1:05 to 1:2.5 and the optimal ratio was found at 1:1.5 for all three SC devices. The current–voltage characteristics under illumination and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the OSCs based on the as cast optimized weight ratio active layers are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. We have also fabricated the devices based on PC71BM alone with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PC71BM/Al and observed that the photocurrent is very low, on the μA level, which may be due to the lack of an appropriate interface in the active layer limiting the exciton dissociation into free charge carriers. Moreover, the SVA treatment also did not improve the value of photocurrent. The devices based on M1:PC71BM, M2:PC71BM and M3:PC71BM active layers without any treatment showed an overall PCE of 1.91% (Jsc = 6.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V, FF = 0.37), 2.55% (Jsc = 7.04 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.93 V, FF = 0.39), and 3.03% (Jsc = 8.332 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, FF = 0.41), respectively. Hence, the order of PCE follows the trend M3 > M2 > M1, and it is obvious that the best performance of the M3 based device is due to higher values of Jsc and FF. Compared with M1 and M3, the higher Voc value for the device based on M2 is attributed to its deeper HOMO energy level, since Voc is related to the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and LUMO level of the acceptor.

The overall PCEs of these OSCs based on the as cast active layer are rather low, in the range of 1.90–3.03%, mainly limited by the low values of Jsc and FF. This is most likely due to the poor nanoscale morphology of the active layer cast from chloroform, which is crucial for exciton dissociation into free charge carriers and their transport through the active layer towards electrodes and finally charge collection.
It is well known that a solvent additive, solvent annealing, thermal annealing and combined use of solvent additive/solvent annealing and thermal annealing processes have increased the PCEs of OSCs significantly due to the enhancement in the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility. In order to increase the overall PCE of our devices, we have adopted a two-step annealing process, i.e., thermal annealing followed by solvent vapour annealing to optimize the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. After the TSA, the M1, M2 and M3 based OSCs showed overall PCEs of 4.79% (Jsc = 9.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.77 V, FF = 0.63), 6.18% (Jsc = 10.68 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, FF = 0.65), and 7.25% (Jsc = 12.36 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.85 V, FF = 0.69), respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs based on the TSA processed active layers are shown in Fig. 6a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Hence, after the TSA, the Jsc and FF significantly increased while Voc slightly decreased, and the PCE performance of the OSCs with all three SMs was significantly improved.
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the optimized OSCs was measured and the diagrams are shown in Fig. 6b. The IPCE spectrum of the M3 based OSC is more extended towards longer wavelength, which is consistent with the absorption profiles of M1–M3 in thin films (Fig. 3b). The IPCE in the shorter wavelength region may have a contribution from both the SMs and PC71BM, while in the longer wavelength region, it is due to the ICT absorption band of the SMs. Therefore, the absorption of photons by both the SMs and PC71BM can contribute to the exciton generation and subsequent dissociation into free charge carriers. The values of IPCE for the device based on M3 are higher through the entire wavelength region than those for the devices based on M1 and M2, which also confirms the higher values of Jsc for the M3 based devices. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are 9.76 mA cm−2, 10.55 mA cm−2, and 12.27 mA cm−2 for M1, M2 and M3, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the values observed from the J–V characteristics under illumination.
To get information about the reasons for the difference in Jsc and FF values of the OSCs and the influence of the acceptor units on the transport properties of holes and electrons, the hole and electron mobilities in the blend films were estimated from the dark J–V characteristics of the hole only and electron only devices, respectively (as shown in Fig. 7a and b). The characteristics were fitted to a space charge limited current (SCLC) model and the data are summarized in Table 2. Both hole and electron mobilities are higher for the M3:PC71BM blend than for the other two, and the change in hole and electron mobilities in the order M1 to M2 to M3 agrees well with the corresponding trends in the variation in Jsc and FF of the OSCs. Moreover, the ratio of electron to hole mobility is M3 (2.14) < M2 (3.21) < M1 (5.09). Hence, the relatively high and more balanced charge transport in the OSCs based on M3 results in the higher Jsc, FF, and PCE in comparison with that of the other two counterparts. It has been reported that the introduction of a highly electron withdrawing unit into D–π–A small molecules can enhance the intermolecular π–π electronic coupling (as confirmed by the absorption spectra of SMs in a thin film), which will thereby reduce the molecular carrier reorganization energy and result in efficient charge transport in the OSC.
In the OSC, the excitons are generated in the active BHJ active layer (in both donor and acceptor) after the absorption of light, and can subsequently dissociate to give free carriers that undergo transport towards the electrodes due to the existence of the internal voltage (Vint) between the anode and cathode. The photocurrent (Jph) under the internal electric field can be reflected by Jph–Vin plots. Jph can be estimated from Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively.Vint is determined as Vint = Vo − V, where Vo is the built-in voltage, which refers to the voltage at which Jph is zero, and V is the applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 8, Jph linearly increases with Vin in the low voltage region and reaches a saturation value (Jphsat) at a high value of Vint. In general and theoretically, Jphsat correlates to the maximum exciton generation rate after absorption of photons. When Jph reaches the Jphsat value at high Vint, it means that all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and efficiently swept out towards the electrodes. The value of Vin at which Jph starts to saturate follows the trend M3 < M2 < M1, which suggests that a lower value of effective voltage is needed to sweep out the charge carriers in the OSC based on M3 as compared to the other two devices. The value of Jphsat is also highest for the M3 OSC, which indicates that efficient exciton dissociation occurs between M3 and PC71BM and implies better phase separation in the M3:PC71BM blend compared to the other two. Moreover, the charge collection efficiency (Pc) was determined by the relation Pc = Jph/Jphsat at short circuit conditions, and is 0.84, 0.88, and 0.93 for the M1, M2 and M3 based OSCs, respectively. The higher value of Pc for the M3 OSC also agrees with the above findings that excitons generated in the M3:PC71BM blend are more effectively transported towards the electrodes as compared to the other devices.

In order to get information about the effect on the photovoltaic response in the OSCs of the different acceptor unit in donors M1–M3, X-ray diffraction measurements were applied to explore the crystallinity and molecular ordering in the optimized active layers. All three active layers showed a strong (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.12°, which corresponds to the lamellar distance of 1.78 nm, see Fig. 9. The (010) diffraction peak at 2θ = 23.18° for M1, 23.62° for M2, and 23.85° for M3, corresponds to the π–π stacking distances of 0.383 nm, 0.376 nm and 0.372 nm, respectively. The XRD patterns (Fig. 9) show that the M3:PC71BM blend film has stronger (100) and (010) diffraction peaks, which indicates a more ordered structure and higher degree of crystallinity of the M3:PC71BM film than those of the other two, which may be beneficial for charge transport and collection. This suggests that the indandione group in M3 enables a denser molecular packing, which may induce a better nanoscale phase separation between donor and acceptor in the blend film and result in the higher Jsc and FF for the M3 device. In addition to these two peaks in the XRD patterns, a weak diffraction peak was also observed in all the blend films, which corresponds to PC71BM.


As touched upon in the Introduction section, several groups have reported that the dipole moment of donor molecules influences the molecular self-assembly and morphology of the blend film. If the molecular dipoles align antiparallel to each other, the resulting net dipole moment can be small or zero. Such an alignment not only lowers the overall energy of the molecular system but also induces self-assembly and thereby increases order and crystallinity in the BHJ films. Dipole moments (μ) were obtained for M1, M2 and M3 by the B3LYP/6-31G(d) geometry optimizations, and are 6.0, 10.2 and 3.7 D, respectively (Table S1, ESI). Additionally, μ values were acquired from PCM calculations with the same DFT method and geometries, and chloroform (ε = 4.81), being used for device fabrication, was chosen as a solvent reaction field. The same trend was observed with a slight increase in the dipole moments; 7.2, 11.7 and 4.5 D for M1, M2 and M3, respectively. In a recent report by Huang et al. on SM:PC71BM OSCs, it was found that increasing SM dipole moments with simultaneous deviation from the dipole moment of PC71BM (5.01 D) resulted in increased phase sizes in the interpenetrated network structures along with decreasing values of short-circuit current density, fill factor, hole mobility and PCE. If the formation of suitably sized self-ordered phases of SMs and PC71BM in the active layer was solely determined by the similarity of the SM and PC71BM dipole moments, both M1 and M3 would be expected to show more favourable phase sizes than M2. However, the XRD results indicate that the quality of the SM:PC71BM layer decreases in the order M3 > M2 > M1, which can be rationalized by a more favourable π–π-stacking for M3 than for M1. Fig. S1 (ESI) illustrates our proposed π–π-stacking with the antiparallel alignment of the individual molecules. The high-performing M3 appears to better align in the anti-parallel fashion with tight π–π stacking over the long range due to the larger planar π-system of its acceptor group, while a similar anti-parallel alignment for M1 may be less favoured because of steric hindrance due to the out-of-plane atoms (CH3) of the N-ethyl group. This hypothesis is in accordance with the observed distinct vibronic shoulder in the absorption spectrum of the film, the strong XRD diffraction peaks, the shorter π–π stacking distance of 3.72 Å and also the better FF values for M3 in comparison with M1. We presume that the close π–π-stacking renders microstructural order and a higher degree of crystallinity to M3, which result in the better charge transporting abilities. In addition to the contributions from local electrostatic forces (dipole–dipole), molecular packing and the resulting aggregation of small molecules seem to be influenced by the structural features of terminal acceptor units.


Three asymmetric small molecules M1, M2, and M3 based on the same triphenylamine–phenothiazine (TPA–PTZ) conjugate backbone end capped acceptors with 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile, and 1,3-indandione were synthesized and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. The optical and electrochemical data demonstrated that the absorption spectra and the band gap of these derivatives can be tuned effectively through the introduction of different acceptor terminal groups and the strength of these acceptors increased in the order 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indandione. These small molecules were successfully employed as electron donors in OSCs and after optimization of the active layer processing, the donor-to-acceptor weight ratio and a two-step annealing, the M1, M2 and M3 based organic solar cells showed power conversion efficiencies of 4.79%, 6.18%, and 7.25%, respectively. Compound M3 exhibits a high PCE due to the broader absorption, shorter π–π stacking distance, balanced charge-carrier mobilities and better FF. The dipole moment of the small molecules was found to increase in the order M3 < M1 < M2 whereas PCEs increased as M1 < M2 < M3. Though there is no obvious correlation with PCE, the dipole moment seems to influence the formation of self-assembled dimers or similar aggregates. The results reveal that the terminal acceptor group has a profound influence on the optoelectronic properties and device performance of D–D′–A type SM donor materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest performance reported for a donor material with phenothiazine as a central unit in an organic solar cell.
