ZnO nanocrystals with a particle size of 20–30 nm have been synthesised for the first time using a template-free method. Chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 nanocrystals (5–10 nm) were directly anchored on ZnO nanocrystals by a vacuum one-pot-nanocasting process without any long ligands. We further investigated Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 quantum dots and dye bilayer-sensitized solar cells, which exhibited power conversion efficiency of 57.4% higher than the single-dye-sensitized solar cells.

With increasing global energy consumption and environmental issues, the fabrication of low-cost and highly efficient photovoltaic cells has attracted intense research interest in recent years. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) configuration has gained considerable attention as a low-cost alternative to conventional thin-film solar cells. TiO2 is generally used as the electron transfer material in DSSCs. However, a major drawback of the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle photoanode in DSSCs is its inefficient electron transport, which imposes an upper limit on the film thickness. ZnO is well known to have energy-band structure and physical properties similar to TiO2. In addition, ZnO has the advantages of low-temperature preparation, controllable structural design, and high carrier transport, especially its good electron mobility (for ZnO, it is 115–155 cm2 V−1 s−1; for TiO2, it is 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). ZnO has the capability of growing with many different types of morphologies including wires, rods, tubes, particles and power shapes at the nanoscale, which can be prepared through different approaches, for example, chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, thermal spraying, and the commonly used wet-chemical routes, while the preparation of porous ZnO nanoparticles by a chemical template-free method has been scarcely reported.

Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are considered to be next-generation alternative sensitizers for costly dyes in DSSCs. Quantum dots (QDs) have many advantages, including solar spectrum matching capability from tunable size-dependent gaps, high extinction coefficients, large intrinsic dipole moments, possible multiple exciton generation (MEG) effect, hot electron effect, low cost, and easy synthesis. Currently, the studies on QDSSCs are mainly focused on highly toxic cadmium and lead chalcogenides, which make their future commercial application doubtful based on health and environmental issues. In this sense, CuInS2, CuInSe2, and CuInSexS2−x (CIS) QDs are an attractive less-toxic alternative to Cd- or Pb-based QDs with a high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and near-optimal bulk band gap energy (1.5 eV). Moreover, CIS QDs have been used in the quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSC) configuration.
The limitations of ZnO in DSSCs are mainly attributed to its large band gap along with the fast recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which hinders its photovoltaic activity and limits its further commercialization and industrial applications. To improve its photocurrent and power conversion efficiency (PCE), we introduced CuInSe2 QDs on the ZnO surface. Regretfully, there are very few reports about ZnO doped ternary CuInSe QDs semiconductors for photovoltaic activities.
Herein, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of ZnO nanocrystals using a template-free method and the synthesis of ZnO@Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 (designated as ZnO@CIS) nanocomposite by a vacuum one-pot-nanocasting process for quantum dot-dye bilayer-sensitized solar cells (QDBSC). Chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 nanocrystals with particle size of 5–10 nm were directly attached on the surface of ZnO nanocrystals without any bi-functional linker molecules. Scheme S1 shows a schematic of the relative band energy levels for charge transfer in the FTO/ZnO/CIS/N719 electrolyte. Due to the quantum confinement effect in the Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs, a higher conduction band edge drives the energetics of the Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs to more favorable levels for electron injection from the photoexcited Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs into ZnO and dye. More importantly, the ZnO@CIS nanocomposites open the path toward high optical density DSSCs, which cover a significant part of the solar spectrum.
ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using the following template-free method. First, ZnCl2 and AOT were dissolved in deionized water at 80 °C with stirring. Then, boiling solutions of oxalic acid dihydrate and phosphoric acid were added to the former solution. Subsequently, the mixed solution was stirred for few minutes and then heated for some time to make the solution layered. The lower turbid liquid was sequentially rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol. Finally, the products were dried and sintered to obtain ZnO nanoparticles. The synthesis procedure for ZnO@CIS nanocomposite is reported in our previous study.
The low magnification TEM image of the synthesized ZnO@CIS (Fig. 1a) nanocomposite clearly shows that the diameter of the prepared ZnO particles is about 20–30 nm (Fig. S1), and some relatively small particles could be found on the edge of the ZnO nanoparticles in the ZnO@CIS sample. A high resolution image, shown in Fig. S2, shows the chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 nanoparticles with a homogeneous size (5–10 nm) and well-defined structure, which are anchored on the ZnO nanocrystals. The HRTEM images of the ZnO@CIS nanoparticles, shown in Fig. S2, display the lattice fringe d = 0.282 nm, which corresponds to the (001) lattice planes of the ZnO nanocrystals and the lattice fringe d = 0.278 nm, which corresponds to the (007) lattice planes of the chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 nanocrystals. Fig. S3 shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a ZnO@CuInSe film with the thickness of around 9 μm on an FTO/glass substrate.
Fig. S4 shows the TEM-EDS spectra of the ZnO@CuInSe nanocrystals. It proves the existence of the Cu, In, and Se elements in the quantum dots, and the ratio of Cu/In/Se is 0.28(±0.1):1.72(±0.1):2.72(±0.1). To further prove this, SEM-EDS elemental mapping was conducted and is shown in Fig. 2(b–f). We can conclude that the quantum dots are off-stoichiometric Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72. Fig. 2 shows that the XRD patterns of the ZnO@CIS nanocomposite matched well with that of zincite ZnO (P63mc, JCPDS 36-1451) and chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 (JCPDS 39-0758). The presence of the (001) peak (Fig. 2 and S5 of ZnO) and the (007) peak (Fig. 2) corresponds to the (001) lattice plane of ZnO nanocrystals and the (007) lattice plane of chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72, which are confirmed by HRTEM analyses (Fig. S2). The XRD diffraction features of the sample ZnO@CIS nanocomposite indicate the presence of the composite materials of zincite ZnO and chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72. XPS analysis further confirmed the elemental composition of the ZnO@CIS nanocrystals and the oxidation states of the elements composed in them (Fig. S9): Cu+ (Cu 2p peak at 932.4 eV), In3+ (In 3d peaks at 444.9 and 452.5 eV, In 3p peak at 666.4 eV), Se2− (Se 3d peak at 59.2 eV, Se 3p peak at 161.1 eV and Se 3s peak at 229.8 eV) and Zn2+ (Zn 2p peak at 1022.6 eV and Zn 3s peak at 1040.2 eV).
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO@CIS are shown in Fig. 3 for comparison. Both the isotherms of the ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO@CIS exhibit a type-H1 hysteresis loop, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials, with clear adsorption and desorption jumps at 0.2 and 0.95. The pore size distribution of ZnO@CIS, which was derived from the desorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, indicates an unaffected large mesopore size of 30 nm aggregated by quantum dots, but the specific BET surface area and the mesopore volume are reduced by 92.6% and 84.5%, respectively (see Fig. 3 and Table S1), after loading of Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs due to the small particle size (5–10 nm) and the large molecular weight of the quantum dots. The BET surface area and the mesopore volume of ZnO@CIS are 3.76 m2 g−1 and 0.084 cm3 g−1, respectively, which are enough for the high capacity enrichment of the N719 dye, and is in agreement with the cross sectional SEM image of the loose ZnO@CIS film, shown in Fig. S3.

Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the naked ZnO film and the ZnO@CIS film. The ZnO film absorbs only UV light (wavelengths of 430 nm). After the sensitization of Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs, the absorption spectra of the ZnO film extend to the visible-light region. The optical absorption spectra of the ZnO@CIS film shows a corresponding red shift of the band edge as the Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs capped ZnO nanocrystals. Obviously, the absorption onset of the ZnO@CIS film is about 750 nm. Fig. S6 shows a plot of (Ahν)2versus hν (A = absorbance, h = Planck's constant, and ν = frequency) for the ZnO@CIS film, from which it is possible to extrapolate the slope near the absorption edge and extract the band gap energy. With the sensitization of QDs, the band gap is reduced and it becomes 2.12 eV due to the density of state (DOS) of ZnO/QDs contributed by the surface states of the QDs. The conduction band level (∼−3.66 eV) of the QDs was investigated using the Mott–Schottky curve, as shown in Fig. S7. A Bohr excitonic radius of 10.6 nm for the Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs was calculated by the Bohr excitonic radius formula and the Brus formula. Due to quantum confinement, reducing the dimensions of QDs smaller than its exciton Bohr radius effectively widens its energy gap.
Co-sensitization with QDs or dyes has also been shown to be an effective strategy for the improvement of power conversion efficiency. The contribution of the two absorbers to the overall cell performance is also evident in the J–V curves presented in Fig. 5. The open circuit potential (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and total energy conversion efficiency (η) of these cells are listed in Table S2. Comparing the bi-sensitizer nanoporous configuration (ZnO@CIS/N719) with a mono-sensitizer cell (ZnO/N719 and ZnO@CIS), the short-circuit current density, JSC, increased from 11.20 (ZnO/N719) to 15.60 mA cm−2 (ZnO@CIS/N719) (+39.3%), and the open-circuit voltage, VOC, increased from 718 to 832 mV (+114 mV); however, the fill factor (FF) decreased from 0.53 to 0.51 due to the increase of series resistance (Rs), which can be validated from the slope of the VOC point (inverse slope of the curve at open circuit (J = 0)) in the J–V curve, and increasing electron recombination. The increase in visible light absorption should be a result of the increased photocurrent in the J–V curve (Fig. 5) and IPCE spectra (Fig. S8). Consequently, under operating conditions (1 sun illumination), the bi-sensitizer configuration improves the conversion efficiency from 4.23% to 6.66% (+57.4%), which is 332.5% higher than 1.54% of only the QDs sensitized solar cell (ZnO@CIS).
The higher energy conversion efficiency of the ZnO@CIS/N719 sensitized solar cell is mainly attributed to its broader light absorption, which leads to the absorption of more photons to generate more photoexcited electrons. To further investigate the role of Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained, as shown in Fig. S8. In general, the trends of the IPCE spectra of the ZnO@CIS/N719 co-sensitized solar cell and the ZnO/N719 dye-sensitized solar cell are consistent with that of the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4). The integrated photocurrent from the IPCE is in accordance with the measured JSC value.
The FRET mechanism involves a donor in an excited electronic state, which may transfer its excitation energy to the nearby acceptor in a nonradiative fashion through long-range dipole–dipole interactions. In principle, if the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor molecule overlaps the absorption spectrum of the acceptor molecule and the two are within a minimal distance from one another (typically 1–10 nm), the donor can directly transfer its excitation energy to the acceptor via the exchange of a virtual photon. Fig. 6 shows the large overlap between the emission spectrum of ZnO and ZnO@CIS (dash line) and absorption spectrum of the QDs and ZnO@dye (solid line). The spectral overlap occurred between 365 nm and 485 nm. The absorption spectrum of the dye is around 538 nm, which overlaps the emission spectrum of Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs. In regular dye-sensitized solar cells, light is directly absorbed by the sensitizer dye, which excites an electron from the HOMO level to the LUMO level. In the new configuration, an indirect injection channel is introduced, by which an electron is promoted from the valence band to the conduction band of ZnO and the QDs, followed by energy transfer from the excited state of ZnO to the conduction band of the QDs, and subsequent energy transfer from the QDs into the LUMO of the dye via FRET. Then, the electron is injected from the excited state of the dye and QDs into the conduction band of the electrode through the ZnO coating, and the FRET from ZnO and QDs increases the energy of the charge injection.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective tool to study the effects of QDs on electron transport and recombination at the photoanode. Fig. 7 shows the representative impedance plots of devices based on ZnO@CIS, ZnO@dye and ZnO@CIS/dye photoanodes. The equivalent circuit to fit the experimental data (reported in Fig. 7) is composed of RC pairs and a distributed element to fully characterize the electrode and its interfaces with the electrolyte. The main semicircle in Fig. 7a is related to the charge transfer process at the anode-electrolyte interface (Rct1 and CPE1). The low frequency large arcs (the semicircles from 35 ohm to 900 ohm shown in Fig. 7a) were attributed to the photoanode/electrolyte interfacial charge transfer (recombination) resistance in parallel with the total capacitance in the ZnO-based photoanodes and the photoanodes/electrolyte interface. The diameter of the semicircle indicates the charge transfer resistance at the interfaces. Notably, the smaller diameter of the semicircles, as observed for the ZnO@CIS/dye based devices, indicates reduced charge recombination resistance compared to the case of ZnO@CIS and ZnO@dye, whereas a portion of the injected electrons were lost by charge transfer from ZnO to I3− in the electrolyte. The ZnO@CIS/dye photoanode with uniform QDs and dye shell reduced the direct contact areas between the naked ZnO surface and the electrolyte, which decreased the charge recombination. The small quarter-arcs (23–45 ohm in Fig. 7b) in the high-frequency region were assigned to the charge transfer process at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface with the resistance (Rct2) and capacitance (CPE2) in parallel. These parameters are critical in analyzing the charge recombination from the Pt counter electrode and electrolyte, which negatively affects the PCE.
It is shown that by the utilization of two sensitizing layers, we are able to increase the optical density of our photoanodes. The energy of photons absorbed by the QDs can be transferred to a dye using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this manner, one can separate the actions of light harvesting and charge separation. The Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs on the ZnO NPs can not only contribute to absorb more photons and more electron injection via FRET to generate more photoexcited electrons, but also form a uniform shell to reduce the direct contact areas between the naked ZnO surface and the electrolyte, consequently decreasing the charge recombination and increasing the charge transfer of the ZnO-based photoanode. As a consequence, improved solar cell performance can be achieved using a combination of a high-extinction-coefficient light-absorbing QD donor with an efficient electron-injecting acceptor dye molecule.
In conclusion, ZnO nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized using a template-free method, and chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs (5–10 nm) have been directly anchored on ZnO nanocrystals (20–30 nm) by a vacuum one-pot-nanocasting process to form a ZnO@Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 nanocomposite. The ZnO@CIS nanoparticles are a composite of zincite ZnO and chalcopyrite Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 nanocrystals. With the addition of Cu0.28In1.72Se2.72 QDs, the absorption spectra show an obvious red shift of the band edge; moreover, the band gap of the ZnO@CIS nanocomposite is 2.12 eV. The best devices, which were fabricated with the ZnO film and ZnO@CIS nanocomposite film, and for comparison the ZnO@CIS photoanode, show a power conversion efficiency η of 6.66%. The synthetic ZnO@CIS nanocomposite is an advanced material that has been rarely reported. Furthermore, the proposed synthesis methods for ZnO nanocrystals and ZnO@CIS nanocomposite are facile, simple and inexpensive compared to other existing methods. The materials obtained by these synthesis methods can be used in other solar cells, such as quantum dot-sensitized solar cells and the latest perovskite solar cells, or even in other fields such as photocatalysis, photodegradation, and photoluminescence.
