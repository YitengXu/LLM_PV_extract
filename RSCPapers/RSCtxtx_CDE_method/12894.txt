Organic solar cells (OSCs) have significant potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. However, commonly used indium tin oxide (ITO)-based electrodes are rigid, bulky and fragile; thus, the bending stability issues of the flexible ITO-free devices should be addressed with more attention. In this study, we introduced a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS [herein PH1000]) flexible electrode and investigated the effect of interface bonding engineering on the performance of the flexible device by a facile solution-processed approach with doping of natural polyhydroxy compounds. Based on the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F photoactive system, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.35% was achieved by D-maltose-doped PH1000/PET composite electrodes, with the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.885 V, the short-circuit current (Jsc) of 19.13 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) of 72.92%. This is one of the highest values reported to date for flexible OSCs. Most importantly, the bending performance of the flexible OSCs was significantly improved by the interface bonding engineering due to the dramatic enhancement of the adhesion capability between the PH1000 electrode and PET flexible substrate; this resulted in an excellent bending performance, and ∼92% of the original PCE value could be maintained after 1000 bending cycles (r = 4 mm) and ∼80% of that could be maintained after 1000 folding cycles (r < 1 mm). The results open a favorable avenue for the realization of highly efficient and flexible ITO-free organic solar cells.

Organic solar cells have received significant attention in the past few decades and have been considered as promising candidates for green, clean and renewable energy sources due to their unique merits of lightweight, low-cost, and easy preparation on a large scale via the wet-process or roll-to-roll printing techniques. The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have been dramatically improved to 10–15% by molecular designing and interface engineering. However, most of the high performance OSC devices reported to date were obtained on rigid glass substrates with indium tin oxide (ITO) or F-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes, which were fabricated by a complex vacuum-deposition technique. On account of this, the glass substrates are rigid, bulky and fragile, which seriously limit their application in wearable and portable optoelectronic devices. Compared to the rigid devices, flexible organic solar cells (Fl-OSCs) have many advantages such as lightweight, foldability and stretchability, thus making them very suitable for application in portable electronic equipment as a clean and sustainable energy output. Spontaneously, the development of related technologies on flexible organic solar cells prepared on plastic underlying substrates (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)) through a wet-process (e.g., spin-coating, knife coating, or roll-to-roll technique) have attracted more and more interest. To date, most of the PCE for flexible organic solar cells are still below 10%, which is much lower than those of the devices on the rigid substrates.

One of the most important roles that determine the flexible device performance is the fabrication of flexible and transparent electrodes (FTEs). In recent years, a series of materials such as ITO, graphene, metal nanowires, and conducting polymers (CPs) have been widely demonstrated as FTEs in flexible OSCs. However, their performance is not robust and they have many drawbacks such as high cost, poor reproducibility, and complex process, which are further needed to be overcome, thus making them very difficult to use in practical applications. Typically, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most commonly used interface material in rigid OSCs due to its good solubility in water or alcohol solution, high optical transmittance over 90% in the visible region, excellent mechanical flexibility, and superior thermal stability. It is also an ideal alternative of ITO where the great advantage of water/alcohol solubility makes it compatible in fabricating large area flexible OSCs with highly cost-effective approach such as roll-to-roll process and blade printing manufacturing. A lot of effort has been made to improve the performance of the PEDOT:PSS film through doping treatments, surface soaking treatments, and so on. These works were mainly focused on improving the conductivity, optimizing the surface roughness, and strengthening the adhesive attraction with underlying substrates. For improving the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layers, one of the strategies involves the addition of a small amount of high boiling point solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethylene glycol (EG) into the PEDOT:PSS solution to increase the crystallinity during film formation, or though solvent post-treatment to enhance the film conductivity and endow the devices with good interface ohm contacts. Lee et al. have shown that the conductivity (σ) of the PEDOT:PSS film can be hugely increased by three orders of magnitude (from 1 to over 3000 S cm−1) though a strong acid (H2SO4) treatment. Our previous work also demonstrated that the conductivity (σ) of the PEDOT:PSS electrode can be dramatically improved to 2860 S cm−1 by the gentle methyl sulfonic acid treatment, thus resulting in an increased PCE of 10.12%. On the other hand, the folding-flexible properties of the FTEs are also an essential requirement for practical applications due to the harsh demands of stability, reliability, and safety in wearable and portable electronics. Some results have revealed that doping a soft material (SM) in the PEDOT:PSS matrix can form a strong intermediate bond between the PEDOT:PSS component and the PET substrates, and further improve the adhesion ability and folding-flexible performance. However, the research work in this aspect is still at its beginning, thus a comprehensive understanding and development of the interface bonding engineering process for the flexible and transparent PEDOT:PSS electrodes is urgent and necessary.
In this work, on the basis of excellent optoelectronic properties (high transmittance and conductivity) and mechanical flexibility of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000, Heraeus, Germany, directly defined as PH1000 from now on) electrodes, we introduced different kinds of polyhydroxy compounds with hydroxylated surfaces into the PH1000 matrix to enhance the adhesion ability between the PH1000 electrode and PET flexible substrate through a strong hydrogen bond and van der Waals bond affinity. The flexible-bending properties of the FTEs were dramatically improved by interface bonding engineering. As a result, based on the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F photoactive system (here, PBDB-T-2Cl: poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-chloro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]; IT-4F: 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene), the highest PCE of 12.35% was achieved by using D-maltose doped PET/PH1000 composite electrodes with a Voc of 0.885 V, a Jsc of 19.13 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.92%. It is worth mentioning that the PCE of 12.35% is one of the highest values reported for flexible organic solar cells up to now, especially for ITO-free OSCs. Furthermore, through the bending and folding test, the investigated flexible devices based on PH1000/PET composite electrodes can still retain ∼92% of the original PCE value after 1000 bending cycles (r = 4 mm), thus presenting excellent physical stability.

The PET/PH1000 FTEs doped with various polyhydroxy compounds were fabricated though a facile solution-process method, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. At first, water/alcohol soluble polyhydroxyl compounds, e.g., D-glucose, D-sucrose, D-glucitol, or D-maltose (their chemical structures are depicted in Fig. 1b), were uniformly dissolved in a PH1000 aqueous solution at the concentration of 5.0 wt%, where the saturation concentration of the compounds, e.g. the D-sucrose, in the aqueous solution could reach up to 67.74 wt% at 25 °C; this indicated excellent water solubility of the polyhydroxyl compound dopants. Then, the mixture was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s on PET plastic substrate and subsequently annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 60 s to form well-distributed composite electrodes. Then, methyl sulfonic acid was applied for the gentle post treatment of the surface of the PH1000 electrodes for ∼10 min and then washed with DI water and ethanol, followed by another hot treatment to provide a dry film. Finally, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083) was spin coated on the PH1000 according to a routine method to form a highly conductive PH1000/PEDOT:PSS composite electrode. The detailed fabrication procedure has also been illustrated in the ESI (Scheme S1). The schematic representations of the hydrogen bond and the van der Waals bond effect that could occur between the PEDOT:PSS and PET interface are shown in the inset figure, where the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxylated surface of D-maltose would have a strong affinity interaction with the carbonyl group of the PET substrate. These types of chemical bonding would provide a somewhat stronger adhesion capacity interface, thus resulting in a highly mechanical folding-flexible electrode.


X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the element states of the as-prepared films. The contrast XPS spectra of C 1s (a) and O 1s (b) for the pristine PH1000 electrode and D-maltose doped PH1000 composite electrode are shown in Fig. 2, the comparison of other polyhydroxy compounds doped PH1000 composite electrode can be found in Fig. S2 (ESI). Notably, from the C 1s spectra, the XPS bands around 288 eV mainly originated from the O–C–O bond, and the peaks at 286.3 eV and 284.8 eV are contributed to by the C–O and C–C bonds, respectively. For the pristine PH1000 electrode, the XPS intensity of the C–C band is higher than that of C–O, while on doping with D-sucrose, a polyhydroxy compound, the relative intensity of the C–C band to the C–O band is more balanced. A similar tendency can also be clearly observed in the O 1s spectra in Fig. 2b, where the peaks at 533.4 eV and 531.8 eV are related to the C–O, SO3H, and O–C–O bands, respectively. The intensity of the C–O band was significantly increased due to the addition of a polyhydroxy compound, suggesting that the polyhydroxy compound was successfully introduced in the PH1000 matrix during the film formation.

Meanwhile, we further tested the energy band alignment by employing ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for pristine PH1000 and PH1000 films doped with D-glucose, D-sucrose, D-glucitol, and D-maltose. The results are depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI), where the work function (WF) values of the energy banding could be derived from the linear extrapolation to zero at the yield of the secondary electrons. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the pure PH1000 film were calculated to be around −5.5 eV. After doping with 5.0 wt% polyhydroxy compounds, the WF values were slightly decreased and possessed a Δ value of 0.05–0.1 eV between the pure PH1000 and polyhydroxy compounds doped PH1000 composite electrodes. Although the WF values show just a little change but as the WF of PEDOT:PSS is −5.2 eV, the better matched WF of the PH1000 composite electrode may be beneficial in reducing the injection barrier and transform the photo-generated charge more effectively.

To evaluate the transmittance performance of the concerned films, first, the UV-Vis spectrum was recorded. Considering that the sunlight should primarily pass through the PH1000/PET anode, soon afterwards to be absorbed by the photoactive layer, hence, the transmittance parameter of the PH1000/PET composite electrode doped w/o the polyhydroxy compounds is attributed to be one of the most important factors that affect the performance of the OSCs. Fig. 3a shows the transmittance results of various PH1000 films w/o polyhydroxy compounds' doping. We can clearly see that the ITO/PET film shows the poorest transmittance properties, which are below 80% and decrease dramatically in the range of λ ≥ 500 nm, such a low transmittance in the main absorption region of photoactive layer is unsuitable to prepare flexible OSCs, not counting for its physical properties of rigid, bulky and fragile. Conversely, the PH1000/PET flexible electrode possessed high transmittance averages approaching 90% in the region of 400–900 nm, and the plots also present an almost negligible decrease after doping with various polyhydroxy compounds compared to that of the pure PH1000/PET electrode, indicating that the composite electrodes are suitable to reserve the incident light for the photoactive layer absorption. Fig. 3b plots the square resistance (Rsq) and conductivity (σ) values of the PH1000/PET flexible substrates w/o polyhydroxy compounds' doping. For the pure PH1000/PET film, a Rsq value of 89 Ω sq−1 and a related σ value of 2809 S cm−1 were obtained; 5.0 wt% polyhydroxy compound doping leads to an overall slight increment in the Rsq and a decrement in the σ values. D-Glucose doping presents the largest increase but D-sucrose, D-glucitol, and D-maltose doping do not show significant enhancements, where the Rsq value is 95.2 Ω sq−1 and σ value is 2626.1 S cm−1 for the D-maltose treated PH1000/PET electrode. Furthermore, the figure of merit (FoM), a commonly used parameter, was applied to estimate the performance of the flexible electrodes, where a higher FoM value always corresponds to better photoelectric properties for a flexible transparent electrode. The FoM was determined by the ratio of the direct current conductivity (σdc) to the optical conductivity (σop) according to the relation:
where
Tλ is the transmittance typically measured at 550 nm and Rsq is the sheet resistance. Derived from Fig. 3a and b, the calculated FoM value of the pure PH1000/PET electrode was calculated to be 40, where the FoM values of D-glucose, D-sucrose, D-glucitol, and D-maltose doped composite electrodes were 32.7, 36.6, 42, and 51, respectively. The D-maltose doping possessed the highest FoM value and the D-glucose doping showed the lowest one. Usually, FoM above 35 is considered to be the minimum benchmark for practical application of a flexible transparent electrode.

To investigate the interface bonding interaction between the PH1000 and flexible PET substrate, we further analyze it by monitoring the adhesive force, as depicted in Fig. 3c. There is an obvious adhesion behavior in the adhesive force curve for the composite films. Pure PH1000 aqueous droplets have a relatively low adhesion force of 0.015 mN. On the other hand, on doping with polyhydroxy compounds, the adhesive force was dramatically increased, especially for D-maltose doping, for which the highest adhesion force value of 0.09 mN was achieved that is almost 6 times compared with that of pure PH1000. Meanwhile, the D-glucose, D-sucrose, and D-glucitol doping showed adhesion force values of 0.038, 0.04, and 0.053 mN, respectively. The adhesive force can simply and directly reflect the degree of interface bonding interaction between the target solution and the underlying substrate, which largely determines the bending and folding performance of the composite films. Some key issues need to be paid more attention while being put to practical use. In this regard, the unavoidable bending or pull-up deformations probably may have caused the PH1000 films to peel off from the underlying substrates and caused the crack propagation, thus leading to a sharply increased resistance of the electrodes and decreased performance of the devices. Hence, we employed the strategy of polyhydroxy compounds' doping to strengthen the interface bonding between the FTEs and PET substrate. Fig. 3d shows the variation of Rsq of the PH1000/PET composite electrode when subjected to a bending (left) and folding (right) test, where the Rsq/Rsq(o) value was estimated as a function of bending and folding cycles of various PET/PH1000 flexible substrate w/o polyhydroxy compounds' doping and Rsq(o) was related to the initial square resistance. First, the samples were subjected to a cylinder (r = 4 mm) with 1000 cycle bending followed by relaxing test. As clearly illustrated, all the samples still retain a low Rsq; the largest value of Rsq/Rsq(o) is ∼1.13 for the pure PH1000 film, giving a Rsq value of 100.5Ω sq−1, which is a little higher than the initial value of 89 Ω sq−1. The PH1000 composite electrode with polyhydroxy compounds' doping even shows a smaller variation tendency within 6%, thus exhibiting excellent bending performance. The Rsq of D-maltose doped PH1000 was increased by ∼3% as compared to the initial value, while the D-glucose, D-sucrose, and D-glucitol doped electrodes showed an increased by ∼5%, ∼6%, and 3.5%, respectively. However, for extremely small folding test (r < 1 mm), the Rsq/Rsq(o) value was dramatically increased over 50% for the pure PH1000 film after 1000 cycle folding tests. Impressively, the polyhydroxy compounds' doping could greatly reduce the damage, suggesting that this interface bonding engineering provides an efficient way to restrain the adverse effect on the PH1000 flexible transparent electrode and enables the films to retain their high conductivity and transmittance.

The photovoltaic performance of the flexible OSCs based on the PH1000/PET electrode w/o various polyhydroxy compounds' doping was investigated with a structure of PET/PH1000/PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F/PDINO/Al, (PDINO: perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide). The device architecture of the flexible OSCs and the molecular structures of PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F are displayed in Fig. 4a, where the inset picture is the physical presentation of the as-prepared flexible OSCs. The energy level alignment of the carrier transition is demonstrated in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c shows the J–V test results of the photovoltaic devices of various PET/PH1000 electrodes based on the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F photoactive layer. The test was performed under standard AM 1.5 G solar irradiation with an incident light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in N2 atmosphere without encapsulation. First, the devices on ITO/Glass and pure PH1000/PET substrates were fabricated to compare, as shown in Fig. 4c and Table 1. The ITO/glass rigid device showed a high PCE of 13.37%, which is comparable to other reports. The pure PH1000/PET substrate based flexible device exhibits an efficiency of 11.85% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.873 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.93 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.58%.

After doping with various polyhydroxy compounds, e.g., D-glucose, D-sucrose, D-glucitol, and D-maltose, the highest PCE of 12.35% was achieved by D-maltose doped PH1000/PET composite electrodes with a Voc of 0.885 V, a Jsc of 19.13 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.92%. To the best to our knowledge, this result should be the highest value reported for the flexible organic solar cells up to now. The performance comparison and progress made in the recent years for flexible OSCs are demonstrated in Fig. 4f and presented in detail in the ESI. On the other hand, the D-glucitol doping exhibits a PCE of 11.82%, D-sucrose doping presents a decreased PCE of 11.58%, and D-glucose doping shows the lowest PCE of 11.12%. Fig. 4d demonstrates the efficiency distribution with various polyhydroxy compounds' doping for the concerned flexible OSCs. The average PCEs of the devices based on the investigated FTEs were plotted in parallel and are shown in Table 1 as well, where D-maltose doping showed the highest average PCE of 12.19%, and D-glucose doping showed the lowest average PCE of 10.95%. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1. We can observe that compared to the rigid ITO based device, the Jsc value of the flexible OSCs was dramatically decreased from 20.46 to ∼19.0 mA cm−2 and the FF mainly was lowered due to the increased square resistance of the transparent electrode. The FoM parameter has an important influence on the performance of the flexible OSCs; the Voc of D-sucrose and D-glucose doped flexible substrate even exhibits a clear decrease owing to the degradation of the film-forming properties. Nevertheless, the highest efficiency of 12.35% achieved by the flexible OSCs is worth our excitement, and although the results were obtained from a small area device of 0.04 cm2, it still opens a favourable avenue for realizing highly efficient organic solar cells.
Furthermore, the bending and folding test was conducted to evaluate the influence on the stability performance of the flexible devices, which was carried out by subjecting the devices to a cylinder (r = 4 mm) or a ruler (r < 1 mm) in a N2 atmosphere without encapsulation. Fig. 4e clearly shows the variation of PCEs compared to the original values as a function of bending (left) and folding (right) cycles based on the PH1000/PET electrode w/o polyhydroxy compounds' doping. The flexible device using pure PH1000/PET substrate presents a point-to-point bending performance, which could maintain ∼83% of the original PCE value after 1000 bending cycles and ∼72% of that after 1000 bending cycles. Compared to the fragile and pliable ITO-based flexible substrate, the PH1000/PET flexible substrate based devices greatly improved the physical flexibility and showed a huge potential in developing highly efficient flexible OSCs. In addition, through the doping of polyhydroxy compounds, which can significantly enhance the adhesion ability between the PH1000 electrode and the PET flexible substrate, the banding properties of the flexible devices were further improved overall. Excluding the unavoidable errors exhibited in the testing process, the plots clearly depicted by the variation tendency that the bending performance was hugely improved. The D-maltose doped PH1000/PET composite electrodes present the most excellent bending test result, which could maintain ∼94% of the original PCE value after 500 bending cycles and retains ∼92% of that after 1000 bending cycles. Then, a more rigorous test by folding the flexible devices along with a ruler (r < 1 mm) was performed. After 1000 bending cycles, the PCE was hugely decreased to nearly 30% of the original value for the pure PH1000/PET flexible substrate due to the significant enhancement of the square resistance. Notably, the test is conducted not directly on the Al top electrode, similar to the device bending (Fig. 4e) and flexible electrode folding (Fig. 3d) test results. In addition, although the improvement by D-glucose, D-sucrose, and D-glucitol doping is not better than D-maltose doping but it still can significantly improve the folding performance of the concerned devices and the loss of PCE was reduced to ∼20% by employing the polyhydroxy compounds doped PH1000/PET composite electrodes, which is much better than that of the pure PH1000/PET. On account of the harsh demands of the performance stability in practical applications for wearable and portable electronics, this promotion of the banding and folding properties of flexible devices is very important and necessary.

In summary, we optimized the photophysical properties of the PH1000/PET flexible transparent electrode by interface bonding engineering. Four kinds of natural polyhydroxy compounds, e.g., D-glucose, D-sucrose, D-glucitol, and D-maltose were employed to investigate the adhesion ability between the PH1000 electrode and the PET flexible substrate through a facile solution-processed approach, where the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxylated surface has a strong affinity interaction with the carbonyl group of the PET substrate. As a result, the D-maltose doped PH1000/PET composite electrodes presented the most excellent flexible-bending performance and have the highest FoM value of 51. Consequently, we systematically studied the photovoltaic performance of the flexible OSCs with the as-prepared composite electrodes. Based on the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F photoactive layer, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.35% was achieved by D-maltose doped PH1000/PET composite electrodes with a Voc of 0.885 V, a Jsc of 19.13 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.92%. Furthermore, we found that the investigated flexible devices exhibit an excellent bending test result, in which they could retain ∼92% of the original PCE value after 1000 bending cycles, which is much better than that of the pure PET/PH1000 electrodes. These results indicate that interface bonding engineering is an effective way towards realizing highly efficient and flexible organic solar cells.
