A conjugated polymer donor material, poly(3,4′′′-di(decylthiophenyl)quaterthiophene) (PDTQT), featuring decylthiophenyl side chains on the polymer backbone, was introduced to reduce the crystallinity of poly(quaterthiophene) (PQT-C12) layers in organic photovoltaic cells. The resulting PDTQT:PC71BM blend active layer formed a well-interpenetrated nanoscale morphology that increased the power conversion efficiency (PCE) relative to devices based on highly crystalline PQT-C12. Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated using the PDTQT:PC71BM blend thin films yielded the best photovoltaic performances with a high short-circuit current density of 9.8 mA cm−2, a high open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V, a fill factor of 0.36, and a high PCE of 3.2% under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Decylthiophenyl side chain substitution appeared to be an effective strategy for obtaining high organic photovoltaic cell device performances.

Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on thiophene derivative donor materials have received widespread attention for their potential to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) blend solar cells yield highly efficient performances (exceeding 5% PCE); poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophene-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes) (PBTTT):PC61BM and poly-dioctyl-fluorene-co-bithiophene (F8T2):PC61BM yield PCEs of 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively. Although poly(quaterthiophenes) (PQT-C12) display high field-effect mobilities of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, photovoltaic devices fabricated using annealed PQT-C12 yield low PCEs of 1% due to the poor oxidative stability of the high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, charge transport imbalances, and a lack of percolating pathways as a result of the high PQT-C12 film crystallinity. PQT-C12:PC61BM blend solar cells yield a low fill factor (FF) and poor PCE because PQT-C12 molecules are arranged parallel to the ITO substrate coated with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) film. This film arrangement results in undesirable phase separation between the donor and acceptor materials. Many studies have attempted to modify the PQT-C12 polymer backbone in an effort to increase the solar cell performance and enhance the field-effect mobility. Park et al. reported a 2.8% PCE for a polyquaterthiophene derivative consisting of alternating p-divinylenephenylene and 3,3-dialkylquaterthiophene units. Chung et al. reported on the introduction of selenophene to the polymer backbone in place of thiophene to lower the crystallinity of the donor materials by increasing the packing disorder. A PCE of 1.4% was obtained using the selenophene approach. Other researchers have examined the effects of modifying the alkyl side chains of conjugated polymers to improve device performance. Hou et al. reported that bi(thienylenevinylene) substituted polythiophenes (biTV-PTs) yielded a PCE of 3.18% with a band gap of 1.82 eV; however, the HOMO energy level of −4.93 eV was too high to display oxidative stability. Holcombe et al. reported that poly(3-(4-n-octyl)-phenylthiophene) (POPT) yielded a low HOMO energy level of −5.5 eV, which conveyed oxidative stability; a low band gap of 1.8 eV, which enhanced the UV-visible light absorption spectrum; and a PCE of 3.1%; however, the PCE was dramatically reduced to 2% upon thermal treatment due to gross phase separation.

In this study, we introduced poly(3,4′′′-di(decylthiophenyl)quaterthiophene) (PDTQT) to enhance the performances of photovoltaic devices based on PQT-C12, as shown in Fig. 1. A PDTQT field effect mobility of 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was previously reported by Park et al. PDTQT contains two unsubstituted thienyl moieties between each decylthiophene-substituted thiophene ring to improve mixing with the fullerene derivatives. Repulsion between the thiophenes on the PDTQT backbone and side chains increases the torsional distortion. Accordingly, PDTQT has a lower HOMO level due to the distorted backbone. By minimizing the phase separation, the fullerene derivatives formed a well-interpenetrated network among the modified polyquaterthiophene domains. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend film was red-shifted relative to the PQT-C12:(6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blend film. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the PDTQT:PC71BM blend film assumed a well-mixed phase, even after annealing. The reference PQT-C12:PC71BM blend film displayed extensive phase-separation between the PQT-C12 and PC71BM domains upon annealing. The PDTQT:PC71BM blend film had a morphology suitable for organic solar cells. The film yielded good charge transport, and the PCE of PDTQT:PC71BM was more than twice the PCE of PQT-C12:PC71BM.

Organic solar cells were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/conjugated polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The glass substrate with a pre-patterned ITO layer (a 0.09 cm2 active layer) was ultrasonicated in detergent, D.I. water, CMOS-grade acetone, and isopropanol, sequentially. The surface of the glass substrate was then modified by UV–ozone treatment for 20 min. A hole injection PEDOT:PSS layer (Bay P VP AI4083, Bayer AG) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s to a thickness of 30–40 nm on the cleaned ITO-patterned glass substrate after filtration using a 0.45 μm PVDF filter. The structure was then baked in an oven at 120 °C for an hour.

The photovoltaic cells included a conjugated polymer as the electron donor and a fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor. The conjugated polymer, PDTQT, was synthesized via a Grignard reaction in good yield, as described previously. The molecular weight of the PDTQT was 12700 with a polydispersity index of 1.68. PDTQT showed good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The conjugated polymer, PQT-C12 (molecular weight: 15000–30000) as the electron donor was obtained from American Dye Source. PC71BM, the fullerene derivative (99.5%) used as the electron acceptor, was obtained from Nano-C. The total concentration, 40 mg mL−1 of 1:4 (by weight) conjugated polymer:PC71BM solution in dichlorobenzene was prepared by stirring in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere overnight. The blended solutions (PDTQT and PC71BM) were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 seconds to a thickness of 100 nm on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and annealed at various temperatures for 20 min on a hot plate in the glove box. The LiF and Al cathodes were thermally deposited to thicknesses of 1 and 100 nm, respectively, onto the surface of the active layer. PQT-C12:PC71BM blend film was fabricated by the same method as for PDTQT:PC71BM film fabrication.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200 source measurement unit in the dark or under AM 1.5 G solar illumination (Oriel 1 kW solar simulator) with respect to a reference cell PVM 132 calibrated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a photomodulation spectroscopic setup (model Merlin, Oriel), a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR570 low noise current amplifier.
UV-visible (Cary: Varian Co.) and photoluminescence (PL) (FR 650, JASCO Co.) measurements were used to analyze the optical properties of the conjugate polymer:PC71BM blend layers. The AFM (Multimode IIIa, Digital Instruments) was operated in tapping mode to acquire images of the surfaces of the conjugated polymer:PC71BM blend layers. TEM measurements were conducted by first separating the conjugated polymer:PC71BM layers from the water-soluble PEDOT:PSS substrate by floating the sample on the surface of D.I. water. The layers were then picked up using 200-mesh copper TEM grids. TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F operated at 100 kV. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were performed for structural and morphological analysis using the 4C2 line (wavelength = 0.138 nm) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. The angle between the film surface and the incident beam was fixed at 0.18°. The measurements were obtained at scanning intervals of 2θ between 3° and 26°.


Fig. 2(a) shows the UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PDTQT and PQT-C12 in the film states. The PDTQT film showed a broad UV-visible absorption spectrum without any shoulders or peaks, unlike the PQT-C12 film. The PDTQT film also exhibited a high energy absorption maximum at 495 nm, which was blue-shifted with respect to the absorption maximum of PQT-C12, 535 nm. Fig. 2(a) also shows the PL spectra of PQT-C12 and PDTQT. The PL maximum of PDTQT at 668 nm was red-shifted by 32 nm relative to the PL maximum of PQT-C12 at 636 nm. Previous results demonstrated that the PQT-C12 polymer film state displayed a large absorption red shift of 100 nm relative to the solution state absorption due to the extensive intermolecular π–π overlap in the film state. The PDTQT polymer, however, yielded a relatively small shift in the absorption edge (35 nm) of the film state relative to the solution state. This observation suggested that intramolecular conjugation in the PDTQT may have been hindered by conformational distortion of the main backbone due to repulsion between the thiophene side chains and the thiophene units in the polymer backbones. Therefore, the absorption band of the PDTQT thin film was blue-shifted by 40 nm relative to the absorption band of the PQT-C12 thin film (see Fig. 2(a)). The high energy absorption maximum of PQT-C12 blended with PC71BM in a 1:4 ratio was blue-shifted by 59 nm compared to the absorption maximum of the PQT-C12 polymer, as shown in Fig. 2(b). On the other hand, the absorption band of the PDTQT:PC71BM (1:4) blend thin film was blue-shifted by 15 nm relative to the absorption band of the PDTQT polymer, as shown in Fig. 2(c). As a result, the PDTQT:PC71BM film absorbed at wavelengths 44 nm longer than the PQT-C12:PC71BM film. The red-shifted absorption profile is beneficial for the performance of organic solar cells. The UV-visible absorption cross-sections of both PQT-C12:PC71BM and PDTQT:PC71BM films remained unchanged after annealing to 150 °C, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). The structural change of PQT-C12 and PDTQT in the UV-vis absorption spectra did not occur with increased annealing temperature, because the PC71BM portion in the conjugated polymer:PC71BM blend layer is highly occupied compared to the contents of each conjugated polymer.

Structural analysis by GIXD, AFM, and TEM revealed the molecular ordering and film morphologies of the polymers. Each polymer layer and polymer:PC71BM blend layer was prepared by spin-casting onto an ITO glass modified by a PEDOT:PSS film. Fig. 3(a)–(e) show the two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) patterns of a series of PDTQT:PC71BM films annealed at several temperatures. The 2D-GIXD patterns of the PDTQT:PC71BM film did not vary significantly, even after annealing at 150 °C. The intensities of the out-of-plane 2D-GIXD patterns of the PDTQT:PC71BM films, shown in Fig. 3(f), revealed a broad amorphous halo.
AFM images were collected to image the surface morphologies of the PQT-C12:PC71BM and PDTQT:PC71BM films, as shown in Fig. 4. The films were prepared by dissolving PQT-C12:PC71BM and PDTQT:PC71BM in dichlorobenzene, followed by spin-coating at 1000 rpm onto the ITO glass coated with PEDOT:PSS. The PQT-C12:PC71BM blend layers, either with or without thermal annealing, displayed a few pinholes with an r.m.s. roughness of 1.449 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The same sample annealed at 120 °C exhibited a flatter surface with an r.m.s. roughness of 0.846 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Likewise, the PDTQT:PC71BM blend layer annealed at 120 °C displayed an r.m.s. roughness of 0.489 nm and was smoother than the as-cast film, with an r.m.s. roughness of 0.985 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). Although we expected the PDTQT:PC71BM films to display better miscibility than the PQT-C12:PC71BM films both before and after thermal annealing, no significant changes in film surface morphology were observed by AFM analysis.
The bulk morphologies of the films were analyzed by TEM imaging. The dark areas were attributed to PCBM-rich regions because the electron scattering density here was higher than that of the polymer.Fig. 5(a) and (b) show that the PQT-C12:PC71BM film included PC71BM clusters that increased in size after annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. On the other hand, the PDTQT:PC71BM blend film exhibited a homogeneous phase, even after annealing at 120 °C, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The TEM images of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend film revealed a well-mixed homogeneous phase, as verified by AFM imaging, because the PDTQT phase mixed well with the PC71BM. On the other hand, the crystalline PQT-C12 phase induced PC71BM cluster formation.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the J–V characteristics of PQT-C12:PC71BM and PDTQT:PC71BM photovoltaic cells as a function of the annealing temperature. The performances of devices fabricated using the PQT-C12:PC71BM and PDTQT:PC71BM blend films annealed at various temperatures are listed in Table 1. The PQT-C12:PC71BM (1:4) blend solar cell yielded a VOC of 0.55 V, a JSC of 7.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.36, and a PCE of 1.5%. After annealing at 120 °C, the efficiency dropped to 0.8% due to PC71BM cluster formation; however, the PCE of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend device improved with annealing. The best photovoltaic properties of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend devices annealed at different temperatures were a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 9.8 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.36, and a PCE of 3.2%. The FFs of PDTQT:PC71BM blend devices are still low, because we modified the side chain of PQT-C12 to reduce its high crystallinity with its distorted backbone. However, the PCE of PDTQT was twice that of PQT-C12. The higher VOC of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend resulted from its lower HOMO level compared to that of the PQT-C12:PC71BM blend, and the enhanced JSC of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend resulted from the superior miscibility of the donor and acceptor materials. Therefore, the decylthiophenyl side chain quaterthiophene derivative improved the corresponding photovoltaic device performance.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PQT-C12:PC71BM (1:4) and PDTQT:PC71BM (1:4) solar cell devices annealed at 120 °C, shown in Fig. 6(c), display the photocurrent response over the absorption range 300–730 nm. The EQE curve shape for both polymers resembled the corresponding absorption spectrum (Fig. 2(c)), indicating that all absorption wavelengths of the polymers contributed to photocurrent generation. The highest EQE value for PDTQT approached 38% over the range 450–500 nm, due to the good miscibility with the PC71BM component. On the other hand, the highest EQE value for PQT-C12 approached 25% at 500–550 nm. Although PQT-C12:PC71BM film absorbs a longer UV-visible range than PDTQT:PC71BM film, its EQE value is much lower than that of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend device. These results clearly showed that the EQE of PDTQT was consistent with the improved PCEs of the devices. In short, the improved JSC, VOC, and FF of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend device led to an enhanced efficiency of 3.2% after annealing. The homogeneous morphology of the PDTQT:PC71BM blend layer was preserved even under annealing at higher temperatures (150 °C), and the photovoltaic parameters, JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE were maintained (Fig. 6(d)).

In conclusion, PDTQT was synthesized by replacing the C12 side chain of the highly crystalline PQT-C12 with a decylthiophenyl group. PDTQT was used as the donor material in an OPV device and displayed red-shifted light absorption properties, a lower HOMO level, and an amorphous structure that yielded greater oxidative stability compared with the PQT-C12 polymer. Interestingly, PDTQT has a much higher VOC than PQT-C12, caused by torsional distortion of polymer backbone. The homogeneous morphologies of the PDTQT:PC71BM photoactive layers, i.e., without PC71BM aggregation, improved the PCE to 3.2%, twice the value obtained from the PQT-C12:PC71BM blends.
