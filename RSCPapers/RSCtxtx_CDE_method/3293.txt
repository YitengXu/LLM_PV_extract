Two truxene-bridged PDI trimers were designed and synthesized as electron transporting materials (ETMs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The truxene moiety was chosen as the core structure, which was end-capped by perylene diimide (PDI) units through the C–C single bond (Tr-PDI3) and the fused ring (Tr-PDI3-C), respectively. It turned out that the perovskite active layer coated with Tr-PDI3 exhibited smoother film morphology, and higher electron transport and extraction ability compared to that covered by Tr-PDI3-C. As a result, a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.45% was achieved in the Tr-PDI3 based device, higher than that with the Tr-PDI3-C electron transporting layer (16.90%). Notably, the performance of inverted PSCs was further enhanced by incorporating Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C as the interfacial layer between the perovskite layer and the C60 electron transporting layer. Champion PCEs of 19.83% and 19.24% were achieved in the devices based on the Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C interlayer, respectively. The control device without an interlayer shows an inferior efficiency of 17.53%. These results demonstrate that Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C are promising electron extraction and electron transporting materials in inverted PSCs.

Perovskite solar cells have attracted widespread attention in the photovoltaic field due to the unique advantages of the perovskite materials, such as low-temperature solution processability, high light absorption coefficient, and long charge carrier diffusion lengths. Today the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has surged to 23.7% since 2009, qualified as a potential candidate in the future photovoltaic market. Generally, a planar-heterojunction PSC can be classified into the conventional (n–i–p) and the inverted (p–i–n) device architectures, according to the charge carrier movement directions. Compared with the conventional PSCs, many researchers focus on the inverted PSCs because of the low temperature processing, diminished hysteresis and potential to fabricate flexible devices. The inverted PSCs employ perovskite as the light-absorbing layer, which is sandwiched between two charge transporting layers, with holes and electrons flowing to the ITO and metal electrode, respectively. Traditionally, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) represents the archetypal electron transporting material (ETM) in inverted PSCs. PC61BM has high electron mobility and relatively deep LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level for electron transport. However, the fullerene derivatives suffer from severe drawbacks, including high cost, monotonous tunability of energy levels and poor stability in air. Therefore, it is highly demanded to develop new and efficient n-type semiconductors as alternatives for PC61BM in inverted PSCs.

The energy levels of non-fullerene organic electron transporting materials can be facilely tuned in order to work efficiently. For example, Marder and other researchers have demonstrated that the HATNA-F6 has an appropriate energy level with a perovskite material, which might be ideal for application in inverted PSCs to replace fullerenes. Later, HATNA-F6 was modified by replacing F atoms with alkylsulfanyl chains. This modification improved their solubility in organic solvents, ensured the matched LUMO level with perovskite, and decreased the parasitic absorption. As a result, PSCs fabricated with inverted architecture using HATNASOC7-CS ETM showed an encouraging PCE of 17.6%. Naphthalene diimide (NDI) is another typical n-type unit and has been successfully applied as an ETM in inverted PSCs. Besides, our group has developed several n-type organic semiconductors in inverted PSCs, exhibiting superior performance compared to PC61BM. Although decent performances have been achieved in these non-fullerene organic semiconductors, the exploration of highly efficient non-fullerene electron transporting materials is still necessary for the development of inverted PSCs.
Perylene diimides (PDI) are widely used as building blocks for ETMs. It is well-recognized that PDIs have good stability, high mobility and conductivity, benefited from the rigid and extended π-skeleton in the molecular structure. Earlier in 2017, Chen's group developed a mono-bromine substituted perylene diimide (Br-PDI) as an electron transporting layer (ETL) in inverted PSCs and achieved a PCE of 11.1%. Meng and co-workers reported a perylene diimide derivative (PDIN)-based ETL, showing an efficiency of 15.28%. However, PDI derivative-based ETLs for high performance inverted PSCs (>15%) are still relatively less reported to date. Herein, we designed and synthesized two truxene-bridged PDI trimers, namely, Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C, respectively. The truxene moiety was chosen as the core unit because of the π-conjugated planar structure and the high electron density. The two molecules are distinguished from the linkage between PDI and truxene. In Tr-PDI3, the truxene moiety and the three peripheral PDI groups were linked through the C–C single bond, while in Tr-PDI3-C, the PDIs were fused to the central truxene group. That is, the C–C single bond between PDI and truxene makes the Tr-PDI3 molecule into a twisted configuration, while the fused connection makes the Tr-PDI3-C in a much planar configuration than the former (Fig. 1). The effect of molecular structure on the photophysical and electrochemical properties, and finally the photovoltaic performances were systematically investigated. It turned out that PSCs employing Tr-PDI3 ETL showed a high PCE of 17.45% with negligible hysteresis, higher than that based on the Tr-PDI3-C ETL (16.90%). The efficiency achieved in the Tr-PDI3-based device is one of the highest among the reported PDI ETL-based inverted PSCs, and superior to the efficiency (16.57%) of a PC61BM-based control device. More excitingly, further improvement in PCE could be obtained by using Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C as the interlayer between the perovskite active layer and the C60 ETL. The device with the Tr-PDI3 interlayer exhibited a champion efficiency of 19.83%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.081 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.22 mA cm−2 and an encouraging fill factor (FF) of 0.83. The Tr-PDI3-C interlayer-based device shows a comparable efficiency of 19.24%. The device containing an interlayer shows a much higher efficiency than the control device without the interlayer (17.53%). These results indicate that Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C are promising n-type organic semiconductors to be applied in inverted PSCs.

The molecular structures of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C are shown in Fig. 1. Synthetic routes for the two compounds were according to the methods reported in the literature. UV-vis absorption spectra of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C were studied in dichloromethane solution, as shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption bands located at short wavelengths (320 nm for Tr-PDI3 and 344 nm for Tr-PDI3-C) could be ascribed to the π–π* transition of the truxene segment. In the range from 400 to 600 nm, both Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C exhibit two absorption peaks, located at 487 and 529 nm for Tr-PDI3, and 489 and 521 nm for Tr-PDI3-C, respectively. Tr-PDI3-C exhibits a slightly blue-shifted and narrower absorption band compared to Tr-PDI3, which could be elucidated by the H-aggregation of the planar Tr-PDI3-C structure. Additionally, the optical bandgaps (Eg) of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C are calculated to be 1.97 and 2.21 eV, respectively, from the absorption onset.

To study the electrochemical proprieties of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in dichloromethane solution, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The LUMO energy levels of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C were determined to be −4.00 and −3.83 eV, respectively, as calculated from the first reduction potentials with the equation of ELUMO = −(5.10 + (Eonset.redvs.Fc+/Fc)). Using the equation of EHOMO = ELUMO − Eg, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy levels of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C were calculated to be −5.97 and −6.04 eV, respectively. Their energy level diagrams are displayed in Fig. 2b. Clearly, the LUMO energy level of Tr-PDI3 is well aligned with the conduction band (CB) of the perovskite layer, suggesting sufficient driving force for electron extraction at the perovskite/Tr-PDI3 interface. Electron mobility of the ETL is a key factor to determine the device performance. The electron mobilities of Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method and the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. S2, ESI). The mobilities were calculated to be 1.21 × 10−4 for Tr-PDI3 and 1.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Tr-PDI3-C, using the electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C/BCP/Ag. Both materials exhibit decent electron mobilities, which are promising to be applied as ETMs in inverted PSCs.
Surface morphologies of the pristine perovskite film and that modified with Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, as shown in Fig. 3. The pristine perovskite film (Fig. 3a) shows a typical polycrystalline structure with multiple grains, with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 17.22 nm. After casting Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C on top of the perovskite layer (Fig. 3d and g), the RMS values decrease to 6.46 and 7.94 nm, respectively. The smoother surface will benefit the charge selective contact between the perovskite and the metal electrode, and is favourable for charge transfer.
To study the electron extraction properties of the newly developed ETMs, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films and that covered with Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C were studied. As depicted in Fig. 4a, perovskite film exhibits strong PL emission at around 775 nm. While, the emission is quenched dramatically after deposition of the Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C film. The PL decay curves are shown in Fig. 4b. The PL lifetime of the pristine perovskite is estimated to be 246.27 ns. Whereas, after modifying the perovskite surface with Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C, a faster PL decay trend is observed, with an average PL lifetime of 3.14 and 3.81 ns, respectively. The results demonstrate that both Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C can induce effective electron extraction from the perovskite layer to the ETL in inverted PSCs. We note that the PL lifetime of Tr-PDI3 is slightly lower than that of Tr-PDI3-C, demonstrating much better electron extraction properties of Tr-PDI3.
As shown in Fig. 5a, the inverted PSCs were fabricated in the following configuration: ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C/BCP/Ag, where Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C functions as the ETL. The cross-sectional image of the device is presented in Fig. S3 (ESI), showing a well-defined sandwiched structure. Initially, the effect of the ETL film thicknesses on the performance of PSCs was studied systemically (Fig. 5b and c), and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI). For a Tr-PDI3-based device, the optimal thickness of the Tr-PDI3 layer is 31 nm, leading to a high power conversion efficiency of 17.45%, with a VOC of 1031 mV, a JSC of 21.47 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.79. However, when further increasing the Tr-PDI3 layer to 48 nm, inferior JSC and FF values are obtained because of the high series resistance. The most appropriate thickness of the Tr-PDI3-C film is about 25 nm, generating an efficiency of 16.90%, with a VOC of 1047 mV, a JSC of 20.92 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.77. Obviously, the performance of the Tr-PDI3 based device is superior to that of the Tr-PDI3-C based device, mainly in JSC and FF, which might come from the more efficient electron extraction and electron transporting ability of Tr-PDI3, as revealed from the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra, and also relate to the smooth surface morphology of the Tr-PDI3 film.
The hysteresis effect is investigated by scanning J–V curves from forward and reverse directions, and the results are shown in Fig. 5d, with the photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1 and Table S3 (ESI). It can be seen that no obvious hysteresis effect is observed in Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C based devices. Recently, Yang's group introduced a PDI dimer in PSCs, and proved that the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups in a PDI moiety can chelate with the uncoordinated Pb2+ to passivate the surface defects of perovskite crystals, thus reducing hysteresis. Herein, Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C are truxene-bridged PDI trimers, comprising three PDI groups in each molecular structure. Thus for both trimers, the coordination between oxygen atoms and the unsaturated Pb2+ might also passivate surface defects of perovskite, which leads to negligible hysteresis effects. The external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE) and the integrated JSC curves of the optimal devices are presented in Fig. 5e. The intensity of the Tr-PDI3-based device is slightly higher than that of the Tr-PDI3-C-based device. The integrated JSC values derived from the EQE spectra are 20.40 and 19.86 mA cm−2 for Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C based devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with that obtained from J–V curves. Moreover, the statistics of PCE distributions were analyzed based on 20 devices. As shown in Fig. 5f, the PCE of the devices with Tr-PDI3 lies in the range from 16.40∼17.45%, while that of Tr-PDI3-C based devices distributes between 15.74 and 16.90%. Furthermore, Fig. S5 (ESI) presents the steady-state JSC and efficiency output under a bias voltage of 0.89 and 0.91 V for the PSCs utilizing Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C ETL, respectively. As a result, a steady state PCE of 17.18% and a JSC of 19.30 mA cm−2 could be clearly observed in 200 s for the Tr-PDI3-based device, whilst the Tr-PDI3-C-based device gives a stabilized PCE of 16.69% and a JSC of 18.34 mA cm−2 within 200 s. The stabilized PCE and JSC obtained under the maximum point output condition suggest good operational stability of devices based on the two ETLs in 200 s. These results demonstrate the decent performance, negligible hysteresis and excellent reproducibility of the PSCs employing Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C ETL.

To further explore the possible applications of the newly developed Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C, inverted PSCs with a structure of ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C/C60/BCP/Ag were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 6a. Here, C60 works as the ETL and hole blocking layer. BCP is the cathode modification layer. Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C functions as the interfacial material to modify the perovskite/ETL interface, as well as to assist electron transport. J–V curves of the device with Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C interfacial material are presented in Fig. 6b, and the results are summarized in Table 2 and Table S4 (ESI). The device with the Tr-PDI3 interlayer delivered a champion efficiency of 19.83%, with a VOC of 1081 mV, a JSC of 22.22 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 0.83, outperforming the device with the Tr-PDI3-C interlayer (PCE = 19.24%, VOC = 1086 mV, JSC = 21.97 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.81). While the control device without the interlayer only achieved a lower efficiency of 17.53%, with a VOC of 1068 mV, a JSC of 21.18 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.78, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). All of the photovoltaic parameters get improved prominently after inserting the PDI-based interfacial layer between the perovskite and C60 ETL, eventually leading to a superior performance in inverted PSCs. In addition, as depicted in Fig. 6c, the PSCs based on Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C exhibit comparable EQE in the range of 300 to 800 nm, and the integrated JSC values are 20.94 and 20.68 mA cm−2, which are in good accordance with the data derived from J–V curves. We also investigated the PCE distribution of the device with a Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C interlayer. As shown in Fig. 6d, the PCEs of the devices with the Tr-PDI3 interlayer mainly distribute in a narrow range between 18.96 and 19.83%, while those with the Tr-PDI3-C interlayer are between 18.59 and 19.24%. Moreover, the maximum power outputs of the PSCs containing Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C interlayers were recorded under a voltage bias of 0.955 and 0.940 V, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). Consequently, a stable PCE of 19.66% and a JSC of 20.59 mA cm−2 were observed in the Tr-PDI3-based device, and a stabilized PCE of 18.99% and a JSC of 20.20 mA cm−2 were obtained in the Tr-PDI3-C modified device. The results reveal that the two compounds are qualified as efficient interfacial materials in inverted PSCs, and Tr-PDI3 is slightly superior to Tr-PDI3-C, which is in accordance with the more efficient electron extraction ability and smoother surface morphology of Tr-PDI3 than Tr-PDI3-C.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the truxene-PDI-based new compounds Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C, can be successfully applied as efficient ETMs as well as interfacial materials in inverted PSCs. Both materials show smooth surface morphology, and decent electron mobility, as well as excellent electron extraction and electron transporting proprieties. A device using Tr-PDI3 as the ETL achieved a high PCE of 17.45%. In addition, further improvement of photovoltaic performance was achieved when Tr-PDI3 or Tr-PDI3-C was employed as the interfacial layer in inverted PSCs. Eventually, the Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C interlayer-based devices achieved an encouraging efficiency of 19.83% and 19.24%, respectively, confirming that Tr-PDI3 and Tr-PDI3-C could work as high-performance n-type organic semiconductors in inverted PSCs.
