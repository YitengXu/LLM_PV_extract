Extending the π-conjugation length of the polymeric backbone is an effective way to enhance the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, the donor–donor–acceptor (D–D–A) molecular strategy has been used to design and synthesize two wide-bandgap conjugated copolymers, in which 2,2-bithiophene (BT) or thieno[3,2-b] thiophene (TT) is introduced to the D–A polymer as a third component to investigate the influence of the conjugation backbone on photovoltaic properties. The structure–property relationship and photovoltaic performance of the polymer have been investigated. Compared to P2 (TT as the third unit), P1 (BT as the third unit) exhibits a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and a more planar backbone structure with slightly higher mobility. Based on a conventional device structure with PC70BM as the acceptor material, P1-based solar cells exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.93%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 11.06 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.9%, which are much better than those of P2-based solar cells (PCE 3.92%). These results demonstrate that extending the effective π-conjugation structure of the polymer backbone could improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs by inserting an additional appropriate donor unit in the D–A polymer.

During the last decade, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received great attention due to their distinguished advantages, such as low cost, light weight, and mechanical flexibility. The past several years have witnessed rapid development of PSCs and now power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% for PSCs have been reported. The enhanced performance is partially attributed to the donor polymer development. The optical and electronic properties of polymeric materials can be fine-tuned through modifying their molecular structures and energy levels to achieve high-efficiency devices.

Generally, PSCs based on low-bandgap (LBG, Eoptg < 1.6 eV) conjugated polymers tend to generate high short-circuit current (JSC) owing to their wide absorption bands. However, the high JSC could not compensate the great loss of open-circuit voltage (VOC) when the absorption edge extended to the near-infrared region, thereby limiting the further improvements in PCEs. Recently, wide-bandgap (WBG) polymers (Eoptg > 1.8 eV) have attracted much attention since they have showed great potential in realizing high VOC and high PCEs. Moreover, they can be used in multi-junction (e.g. tandem) solar cells to break the efficiency limitation of single junction devices through complementing absorption spectra without reducing VOC. The PCE for tandem organic solar cells is theoretically predicated to reach up to 15%, which shows great commercial prospects.
The exploration of high-performance WBG polymers is of crucial importance to make further improvements in the performance of PSCs. However, most of the WBG polymers have exhibited low PCEs mostly due to their low JSC. It is known that the charge carrier mobility is a key parameter that influences the performance of PSCs. High charge carrier dissociation in BHJ can reduce recombination and improve the JSC and the fill factor (FF). It has been reported that extension π-conjugation length of the polymer backbone is an effective way to improve charge transportation by enhancing π–π interaction. For instance, He et al. synthesized a series of polymers based on the extended π-conjugated tetrathienoanthracene system, which can promote charge transport by reinforcing π–π stacking in the solid state. Li and co-workers synthesized a multi-ring indacenodithiophene-biscyclopentadithiophene (IDTCPDT) donor by extending IDT with two CPDT units. The solar cell made from PIDTCPDT-DFBT showed a high power conversion efficiency of 6.46% because of its low band-gap, good planarity and high hole-mobility. Jen and co-workers studied five ringed indacenodithiophene (IDT) and the extended seven ringed indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT). They found that the charge carrier mobility of polymer PIDTT-DFBT is much higher than that of polymer PIDT-DFBT. Son et al. synthesized a PTB7 analog photovoltaic polymer PTDBD by extending benzodithiophene (BDT) with two fused thienyl units, resulting in a high PCE of 7.6%. Our group recently reported a novel WBG polymer PDBT-T1 based on an extended π-conjugation DTBDT unit. The enhanced intermolecular interaction and efficient charge transport endued PDBT-T1 yielded a record PCE of 9.7% for single-junction solar cells. Therefore, the synthesis of fused homo- or heterocyclic aromatic moieties is an efficient method to extend the π-conjugated system of the polymeric backbone to improve the photovoltaic performance. However, extension of the fused ring system is difficult to realize due to the complex structure and the long synthetic route.
An alternate approach has been used to extend the π-conjugated system by inserting the third component (donor or acceptor) to a donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymer to synthesize “terpolymer”, as the D–D–A or D–A–A structure in the polymeric backbone. Terpolymers including three or more different components in the backbone can exhibit a synergetic effect of each unit to improve carrier mobility, tune the energy level and increase the solubility of conjugated polymers. The terpolymer approach provided an opportunity to further vary the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers through the use of two different electron-donor units. Several terpolymer-based PSCs have shown high performance with efficiencies exceeding 8%, which have exhibited great potential for designing new highly efficient conjugated polymer donors.
In this study, we designed and synthesized two novel WBG terpolymers P1 and P2, in which BDT with alkylthiothiophene side chain and T1 were used as the donor and acceptor units, respectively. 2,2-Bithiophene (BT) and thieno[3,2-b] thiophene (TT) were used as the third component to investigate the influence of the conjugation backbone on photovoltaic properties. The molecular structures of P1 and P2 are shown in Scheme 1. The UV-vis absorption, electrochemical properties, theoretical simulations, mobility, photovoltaic performances and morphology of the two terpolymers have been systematically investigated. We noticed that P1 with the BT unit showed a nearly planar structure with a high hole mobility of 1.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, P2 with the TT unit showed a slightly twisted molecular geometry and a relatively low hole mobility of 1.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Based on a conventional device structure with PC70BM as the acceptor, P1-based PSCs showed a promising PCE of 6.9%, with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 11.0 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 72.9%. In contrast, P2-based devices showed a decreased PCE of 3.9% with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 8.55 mA cm−2, and a relatively low FF of 53.1%. The results indicated that the π-conjugated length, rigidity and conformation of the backbone directly influenced the photovoltaic performance of the WBG copolymers.

The synthetic routes of acceptor segments, donor segments and polymers are depicted in Scheme 2. The syntheses of the acceptor segment (benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione, compound 4) and the donor segment (alkylthiothiophene substituted BDT, compound D2) are described in the literature. In this case, 2-butyloctyl was attached on the BDT instead of the 2-ethylhexyl group to increase the solubility. Moreover, two commercial available donor segments BT and TT were introduced into the polymer backbone as the third component in order to extend the conjugation backbone length of the polymer. From the view of reaction activity, the final polymers were prepared in a two-step route via D1–A–D1 intermediates. BT or TT with compound 4 were firstly combined to prepare the D1–A–D1 intermediates as the first monomer M1 or M2 by regular reaction conditions, and compound D2 was used as the second monomer. Finally, two novel polymers (P1 and P2) with three components were synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization with high yields. Both the polymers are readily soluble in organic solvents, such as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two polymers in diluted chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding data of optical properties are listed in Table 1. In diluted CHCl3 solutions, two typical absorption bands are observed for the two polymers. The high-lying absorption band from 320 to 420 nm is assigned to the π–π* transition, and the other low-lying absorption band from 420 to 700 nm is attributed to the strong internal charge transfer interaction. Compared to P1, the low-lying absorption peak of P2 shows a 20 nm red shift, which is related to the stronger electron-donating ability of the TT unit. In comparison with their absorption spectra in CHCl3 solutions, the absorption peaks of the two polymer films are red shifted. Meanwhile, both of them show stronger shoulders, which could be attributed to the stronger aggregation in solid-state films. According to Table 1, the main absorption peak of P2 is only red-shifted by 6 nm, but P1 shows a 25 nm red shift, which indicate that P1 may exhibit stronger aggregation or more ordered π–π stacking in solid films. Therefore, P1 is expected to possess better charge transport properties in the film. The absorption edges of P1 and P2 in the solid films are at 685 and 680 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps of 1.81 eV and 1.82 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of the polymers in thin films were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dry acetonitrile solution. Fig. 2a shows the CV curves of the two polymer films. The observed onset oxidation and reduction potentials of P1 and P2 were 1.06 V/−0.91 V and 0.94 V/−0.93 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to the reported equations. The corresponding calculated HOMO/LUMO levels and band gaps are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, the LUMO levels of two polymers were nearly the same, which were mainly determined by the acceptor segment. It should be noted here that the HOMO level of P1 (−5.86 eV) was deeper than that of P2 (−5.74 eV), which was ascribed to the impact of the stronger electron-donating ability of the TT unit than that of the BT unit. Also, we can see a similar effect in their UV-vis absorption spectra in solution. Due to the stronger electron-donating ability of the TT unit, the absorption spectrum of P2 shows a red-shift compared with that of P1. The deeper HOMO value is one of the encouraging characteristics for higher VOC for a donor material. Thus, the P1-based PSCs should give a higher VOC than the P2-based cells.


To further understand the electronic distribution and geometrical configuration of two polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed. To simplify calculation, the polymer backbones were set three repeating units as oligomer models. The calculated HOMO and LUMO electron density distributions for P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). From Fig. S1 (ESI), it can be seen that the electron density distributions at LUMO levels of the two polymers are mainly localized on the acceptor unit, while the HOMO levels are delocalized along the entire conjugated backbones for both polymers, which is a typical phenomenon for donor–acceptor copolymers. As shown in Fig. 3 (side view parts), the simulation dihedral torsion angles of the C–C single bond between the adjacent aromatic units were 1.0°/16.3°/16.9° and 3.0°/21.7°/16.6° for P1 and P2, respectively.

From the simulation geometries (in Fig. 3) and the map of DFT electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces (in Fig. S2, ESI), one can find that both the polymers show good planarity, but the backbone structure of P1 showed more planarity than that of P2. The differences were ascribed to the effect of molecular configuration by introducing a BT or TT unit. This result indicated that the energy level and the conjugation stereo structure could be tuned by different conjugated segments. The molecular structure would affect the charge mobility of polymers in the film, which will be discussed in the following section.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, PSCs with a conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P1 (or P2):PC70BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The details of the device fabrication process are described in the Experimental section. Different donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios and additives of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were tested to optimize the conditions for high performance solar cells. The data for the optimization process are provided in Fig. S3–S6 and Tables S1, S2 (ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices fabricated with optimal conditions based on P1:PC70BM and P2:PC70BM are shown in Fig. 4a. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the optimal conditions of the D:A ratio and DIO concentration were different for the two polymers. The optimal weight ratio of P1 to PC70BM was found to be 1:1.5. Under these optimal conditions, the P1-based PSCs showed a PCE of 3.11%, with a JSC of 7.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.92 V, and a FF of 47.2%. When 2% DIO was added to the active layer, the PCE showed a pronounced enhancement with a maximum PCE of 6.93%. This great enhancement was mainly due to the increased JSC (11.06 mA cm−2) and FF (72.9%), respectively. A similar tendency was observed for the parameters of optimized P2-based devices. Upon adding 1% DIO, P2-based PSCs showed a maximum PCE of 3.92%, which was nearly two times higher than that of the device without DIO. And, JSC and FF were increased to 8.59 mA cm−2 and 53.1%, respectively. For both the devices, the VOC values are given a slight decrease, which may be due to severe aggregation. And, the increased JSC and FF are mainly ascribed to the improved morphology of the active layer after the addition of DIO.

Compared to the P2-based device, a higher PCE for the P1-based device could be seen on account of higher VOC, JSC and FF values. The average VOC value of P1 (0.87 V) was higher than that of P2 (0.86 V), which was consistent with the deeper HOMO level of P1. And, the higher JSC and FF values were appropriately attributed to the higher carrier mobility and better active layer morphology.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices with or without DIO contents are displayed in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that all devices show broad responses over the range of 310–700 nm. When DIO was added, the EQE values of P1 and P2 were increased obviously. The EQE value for the P1 based device was higher than 55%, observed at 370–640 nm, and the peak value was up to 65% for the champion device, indicating efficient photon harvest and charge collection within the cells. In contrast, the EQE value for the P2 based device was higher than 40%, observed at 400–640 nm, and the peak value was up to 58% for the champion device. Therefore, the P1-based device showed a better photoresponse, which could enhance the current density and explain the higher value of JSC.

The hole mobility of the polymer is measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The J–V curves of hole-only devices under dark conditions are provided in Fig. 5 and Table S3 (ESI). The polymer P1 exhibits the hole mobility of 1.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of P2 with a value of 1.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, we measured the mobilities of these polymers by using organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) at room temperature. We can see that the devices show typical p-type transport properties. P1 shows a mobility of 5.80 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of P2 (1.94 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). These are consistent with the simulated results. P1 presents a rather planar backbone, which is usually more favorable for π–π stacking in the solid state. The hole mobilities of both materials were reduced upon blending with PC70BM (without additives). And, the blend film of P1 and PC70BM also shows a slightly higher mobility of 9.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of the blend film of P2 and PC70BM (6.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, when processed with DIO, the hole mobilities of the two composite films show a big difference. The hole mobility of the composite film of P1 and PC70BM including 2% DIO is 1.22 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than the composite film of P2 and PC70BM with 1% DIO (8.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The charge transport is the key for higher JSC and EQE, which is consistent with the reported results.


The relationship between thin films and the device performance for two conjugated polymers were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. 6 and Fig. S7 (ESI) show the AFM images of the blend films and neat films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 0.82 and 1.25 nm for thin films of P1 and P2, respectively. Without using the additive DIO, all blend films exhibit a much rougher surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.45 nm and 3.64 nm for P1:PC70BM and P2:PC70BM, respectively. After being processed with DIO, the surfaces of blend films become smooth with RMS values of 1.99 nm and 1.18 nm for P1:PC70BM and P2:PC70BM, respectively.

Fig. S8 (ESI) exhibits the in-plane and out-of-plane diffraction patterns of the two polymers and blend films with DIO. In the in-plane direction, P1 and P2 films show diffraction peaks at qxy = 0.25 Å−1 and 0.22 Å−1, which correspond to the lamellar (100) diffraction peak with d spacing values of 2.51 nm and 2.85 nm.
In the out-of-plane direction, there are no obvious lamellar diffraction peaks found in P1 and P2 films, while the diffraction peaks observed at qz ≈ 1.71 Å−1 are attributed to π–π stacking (010) peaks (the π–π stacking distance is 0.37 nm) of P1 and P2 films. These phenomena indicate that the two polymers would adopt a preferential face-on orientation. The better face-on orientation is helpful to the vertical carrier transport. Clearly, a stronger lamellar diffraction peak in the out-of-plane diffraction can be seen for P1 than that of P2, indicating a better crystallinity of P1 and higher charge mobility. The results agree well with the carrier mobilities measured using SCLCs. By incorporating BT unit to extend the polymer backbone, P1 exhibits a better hole mobility as well as a better performance of P1-based solar cells.

In summary, we developed two D–D–A type wide bandgap polymers with benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione as the acceptor, benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene as the first donor unit, in which the second donors (BT or TT) were incorporated into the backbone to extend the π-conjugation of the polymers. When the BT unit was incorporated into the polymer backbone, the resulting P1 polymer-based PSCs achieved a high PCE of 6.93%, a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 11.06 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.9%. The slightly more planar backbone structure and higher hole mobility of P1 were believed to contribute to the better performance of PSCs. The results demonstrate that incorporating an additional conjugated component into the D–A copolymer backbone is an efficient method to tune the molecular stereo structure, and thus improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.


Compounds 3, 5 and 6 were synthesized according to the known procedures. All chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless specified, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dehydrated. The detailed synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers are as follows.


In a 250 mL nitrogen purged flask, n-butyl lithium hexane solution (2.5 M, 17.6 mL) was slowly added to a solution of thiophene (1.7 g, 20 mmol) in 80 mL of THF at 0 °C. Then the solution was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. After refluxing the solution for 2 hours, 5-(bromomethyl)undecane (12.4 g, 50 mmol) was injected at room temperature and then refluxed overnight. After cooling down, the mixture was quenched by H2O. The solution was extracted with ethyl ether, washed with water and dried over MgSO4. The crude product was obtained after removing the solvent and further purification was carried out by distillation to obtain pure compound 2 as a liquid (5.8 g, yield 69%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 6.51 (d, 2H), 2.67 (m, 4H), 1.57 (m, 2H), 1.43–1.27 (br, 32H), 0.89–0.86 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 141.9, 124.3, 40.0, 37.8, 33.3, 33.0, 31.9, 29.7, 28.9, 26.7, 23.0, 22.7, 14.1 and 14.0.


Oxalyl chloride (10 mL) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1 drop) were slowly added to compound 3 (2.0 g, 6 mmol) in toluene (40 mL). Then the mixture was warmed up to 65 °C and stirred for 2 hours. The solvent was removed under vacuum to obtain crude 2,5-dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarbonyl dichloride, which was used for the next step without further purification. To a stirred solution of the dicarbonyl dichloride and compound 2 (2.5 g, 6 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (CH2Cl2, 40 mL), AlCl3 (3.5 g, 26.4 mmol) was added in small portions at 0 °C. After stirring for 1 hour at 0 °C, the mixture was poured into ice and then extracted with CH2Cl2 and washed with water. The organic layer was collected and the volatile solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified using silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (10:1 by volume) to give a pale yellow solid (1.6 g, yield 40%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 3.25 (m, 4H), 1.73 (m, 2H), 1.26–1.18 (br, 32H), 0.83–0.78 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 174.4, 154.2, 133.8, 131.8, 118.3, 38.8, 33.3, 32.5, 32.2, 30.8, 28.6, 27.7, 25.4, 22.0, 21.6, 13.1 and 13.0.


Compound 5 (2.5 g, 5.4 mmol) was added to a solution of compound 4 (1.2 g, 1.8 mmol) in toluene (80 mL) in a 250 mL flask. When the flask was purged with nitrogen for 5 minutes, 210 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added as a catalyst and then the mixture was purged with nitrogen for another 15 minutes. Then the solution was refluxed overnight. After cooling down, toluene solvent was removed and further purification was carried out using silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (20:1 by volume) to give a red solid (1.2 g, yield 75%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 7.62 (d, 2H), 7.22 (t, 2H), 7.19 (d, 2H), 7.10 (d, 2H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 3.24 (m, 4H), 1.71 (m, 2H), 1.28–1.18 (br, 32H), 0.89–0.78 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 176.6, 152.4, 140.9, 140.1, 135.9, 132.0, 131.3, 131.2, 130.4, 127.0, 124.3, 123.5, 122.8, 40.2, 32.7, 31.8, 30.9, 28.7, 27.8, 25.6, 25.1, 22.0, 21.7, 13.2 and 13.1.


Compound 6 (2.3 g, 5.4 mmol) and 4 (1.2 g, 1.8 mmol) were dissolved in toluene (80 mL) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask under a nitrogen atmosphere, 210 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added as the catalyst and then the mixture was purged with nitrogen for 15 minutes. Then the solution was refluxed overnight. After cooling down, the solvent was removed and further purification was carried out using silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (20:1 by volume) to give a red solid (0.99 g, yield 66%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 7.99 (s, 2H), 7.39 (t, 2H), 7.18 (d, 2H), 3.23 (m, 4H), 1.73 (m, 2H), 1.27–1.18 (br, 32H), 0.87–0.77 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 176.5, 152.6, 141.8, 141.2, 138.3, 134.1, 132.2, 132.0, 128.2, 121.8, 118.4, 38.9, 33.1, 32.7, 32.4, 30.9, 28.7, 27.8, 25.6, 22.0, 21.7, 13.1 and 13.1.



N-Bromobutanimide (0.36 g, 2 mmol) was added in small portions to compound 7 (0.88 g, 1.0 mmol) in CHCl3 (20 mL) at room temperature and stirred for 3 hours. After quenching by H2O, the mixture was extracted with CHCl3 and washed with water. The organic layer was collected and the volatile solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified using silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (10:1 by volume) to give the pure compound M1 as a red solid (0.6 g, yield 57%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 7.59 (d, 2H), 7.03 (d, 2H), 6.97 (d, 2H), 6.93 (d, 2H), 3.24 (m, 4H), 1.74 (m, 2H), 1.27–1.18 (br, 32H), 0.83–0.76 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 176.5, 152.6, 140.7, 139.0, 137.4, 131.9, 131.6, 131.4, 130.4, 129.8, 123.5, 122.9, 111.0, 38.8, 33.1, 32.7, 32.4, 30.9, 28.7, 27.8, 25.6, 22.0, 21.7, 13.1 and 13.1.



M2 (0.5 g) was synthesized as an orange solid according to the method used for the preparation of M1. Yield: 65%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 7.85 (s, 2H), 7.19 (s, 2H), 3.21 (m, 4H), 1.72 (m, 2H), 1.27–1.18 (br, 32H), 0.83–0.77 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 176.4, 152.9, 141.2, 140.2, 138.4, 133.4, 132.2, 131.9, 121.2, 121.2, 115.0, 38.8, 33.1, 32.7, 32.4, 30.9, 28.7, 27.8, 25.6, 22.0, 21.7, 13.2 and 13.1.


The monomers of M1 (0.15 mmol) and D2 (0.15 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of toluene in a 50 mL flask. When the flask was purged with nitrogen for 5 minutes, 8 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added as the catalyst, and then the mixture was purged with nitrogen for another 25 minutes. The reactant was refluxed for 48 hours. After being precipitated in 60 mL of methanol, the crude product was collected by filtration and purified by washing, extracted on a Soxhlet extractor with methanol and hexane in succession. The final product was obtained by precipitating the chloroform solution in methanol. After the polymer was dried under vacuum, the yield and molecular weight were obtained as follows:

Polymerization of P1. Yield: 53%, elemental analysis calcd (%) for (C92H116O2S12): C, 61.83; H, 7.33; found: C, 67.46; H, 7.14.
Polymerization of P2. Yield: 61%, elemental analysis calcd (%) for (C88H112O2S12): C, 66.42; H, 7.41; found: C, 66.64; H, 7.12.


1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker arx-400 spectrometer in CDCl3 at 293 K. UV-vis absorption measurements were carried out on a Hitachi (model U-3010) UV-vis spectrophotometer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using a platinum plate as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical workstation in a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. And, the potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was internally calibrated by using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the redox couple. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to the equations:
EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8) (eV)
ELUMO= −e(Ered + 4.8) (eV)
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NanoMan VS microscope in the tapping mode.



Polymer solar cells with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 (or P2):PC70BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The patterned ITO-coated glass was cleaned by a detergent and then subjected to a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water and followed by acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried overnight in an oven. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin cast onto the ITO substrates and then dried by baking on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. The active layer solution of P1 (or P2):PC70BM in CHCl3 with different blend weight ratios and DIO concentrations was spin cast at 1200 rpm for 40 s on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, 2.10 nm Ca and 100 nm Al layers under the vacuum conditions of 5 × 10−5 Pa were deposited using a thermal evaporation method. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. Solar cell performance was measured using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured using a calibrated silicon solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). IPCE spectra were recorded by using a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV measurements, Inc.).
