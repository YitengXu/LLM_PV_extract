A novel n-type two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymer based on bithienyl-benzodithiophene (BDT) and perylene diimide (PDI), P(PDI-BDT-T), was synthesized by Stille coupling for application as an acceptor material in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). P(PDI-BDT-T) exhibits broad absorption in the visible region with an optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.64 eV, and a LUMO level of −3.89 eV, which is similar to and slightly higher than that of PCBM, indicating that the polymer is a suitable acceptor to replace PCBM in PSCs. PSCs with P(PDI-BDT-T) as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.71% with a Jsc of 11.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V, and FF of 51.1%. Meanwhile, the PCE of the PSCs based on the acceptor of a corresponding 1D-conjugated polymer P(PDI-BDT-O) with an alkoxy side chain on the BDT unit was only 2.75% with a Jsc of 10.14 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, and FF of 37.6%. These results indicate that the 2D-conjugated P(PDI-BDT-T) is a promising acceptor material for all-PSCs.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), composed of a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and an n-type conjugated polymer as the acceptor, have attracted much attention recently, due to the potential advantages of n-type conjugated polymer acceptors over the traditional fullerene derivative PCBM, in terms of easy-tuning of absorption spectra and electronic energy levels as well as better flexibility. One of the challenges for all-PSCs is the development of effective n-type conjugated polymers. Perylene diimide (PDI) is a typical n-type organic semiconductor, and an n-type conjugated polymer based on the PDI unit was first reported for all-PSCs in 2007 by Zhan et al., and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.50% was obtained for all-PSCs with the polymer as an acceptor and a two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polythiophene derivative with a conjugated side chain as a donor. Zhou et al. then synthesized a series of n-type conjugated polymers based on PDI and several donor units and a PCE of over 2% was achieved for all-PSCs with n-type polymers as acceptors. In 2014, the PCE of all-PSCs based on PDI-containing polymers reached up to 4.4% as reported by Bao et al., which is the highest performance in published literature for all-PSCs based on the PDI system so far. Nowadays, PDI-based polymers have become representative n-type conjugated polymers for all-PSCs.

In recent years, two-dimension (2D)-conjugated polymers based on the benzodithiophene unit have received much attention for applications as donor materials in PSCs, because of their advantages such as better light absorption, higher thermal stability, deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, higher hole mobility and better photovoltaic performance. Yet, there are no n-type 2D-conjugated polymers reported for applications as acceptors in PSCs to date. In order to extend the concept of 2D conjugated polymers to n-type polymers and study the effect of the conjugated side chains on the photovoltaic performance of the n-type polymer acceptor, we designed and synthesized the n-type 2D-conjugated D–A copolymer P(PDI-BDT-T) based on thienyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) as the donor (D) unit and PDI as the acceptor (A) unit by Stille coupling polymerization. Meanwhile, a corresponding n-type 1D-conjugated polymer P(PDI-BDT-O) with alkoxy substituents on the BDT unit was also synthesized for comparison (Fig. 1). P(PDI-BDT-T) exhibits broad absorption in the visible light range with an optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.64 eV, which will enhance the light harvesting of the active layer when it is used as an acceptor material. Furthermore, P(PDI-BDT-T) shows a LUMO level of −3.89 eV which is similar to and slightly higher than that of PCBM, indicating the potential feasibility of its application as an acceptor to replace PCBM, from an energy level point of view. The photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs based on P(PDI-BDT-T) as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor demonstrated a higher PCE of 4.71% with a Jsc of 11.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V, and FF of 51.1%. Meanwhile, the PCE of the all-PSCs with P(PDI-BDT-O) as the acceptor was only 2.75% with a Jsc of 10.14 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, and FF of 37.6%, indicating that the 2D structure of the n-type conjugated polymer is also superior to the corresponding 1D polymer for applications as an acceptor in all-PSCs.

Monomers 2Br-PDI, BDT-T and BDT-O were prepared by using the experimental procedures reported in the literature. It should be mentioned that monomer 2Br-PDI is a mixture of the 1,7 and 1,6 regioisomers, and their ratio is ca. 5:1 according to the 1H-NMR spectrum of dibromo-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (see Fig. S1 in ESI). The synthesis processes of polymer P(PDI-BDT-T) are as follows:

2Br-PDI (300 mg, 0.27 mmol), BDT-T (245 mg, 0.27 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (18.8 mg, 0.016 mmol) were added into a 50 mL three-neck round-bottom flask with 10 mL of a toluene solution. The flask equipped with a return pipe was then degassed and filled with argon three times. The reaction mixture was treated for 48 h under argon atmosphere. After cooling, the reaction solution was added to 100 mL of methanol. Subsequently, the polymer precipitated as a dark reddish solid, was dried in a vacuum drying oven, and then purified through Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and hexane. P(PDI-BDT-T) (300 mg; 71%), anal. calcd for C98H128N2O4S4 (%): C 77.12, H 8.45, N 1.84, O 4.19, S 8.40; found (%): C 76.43, H 8.40, N 1.77, O 4.31, S 9.09; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.82 (d, 1H), 8.48 (s, 1H), 8.39 (d, 1H), 8.05–7.89 (m, 1H), 7.29 (d, 1H), 6.81 (s, 1H), 4.12 (s, 2H), 2.79 (d, 2H), 2.01 (s, 1H), 1.55–0.71 (m, 66H).
Polymer P(PDI-BDT-O) was synthesized following similar synthetic procedures as those for synthesizing P(PDI-BDT-T): 2Br-PDI (330 mg, 0.30 mmol), BDT-O (230 mg, 0.30 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (21 mg, 0.018 mmol); P(PDI-BDT-O) (157 mg; 37%); 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.92 (s, 1H), 8.36 (t, 2H), 7.79 (d, 1H), 4.24 (s, 4H), 2.02 (s, 1H), 1.76 (s, 1H), 1.40 (d, 42H), 0.80 (d, 14H).

Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary-5000 UV-vis Spectrophotometer in chloroform solutions and in thin films. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was measured on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation with a platinum–carbon working electrode, a Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile electrolyte solution. The AFM measurements of the surface morphology of blend films were carried out on a Nanoscope III (DI, USA) microscope in contact mode with 5 μm scanners. The TEM images of the active layers were taken by using a Tecnai G2F20 (FEI, USA) microscope.


The charge carrier mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/Au (hole-only device) for the hole mobility measurement or with the structure of ITO/Al/Active layer/Al (electron-only device) for the electron mobility measurement. After measurements of the J–V curves of the devices, the hole mobility and the electron mobility were calculated roughly by the following equation:
where
εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, J is the current density, L is the thickness of the blend films, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential from the difference in the work functions of the anode and the cathode (in the hole-only and electron-only devices, the Vbi values are 0.2 V and 0 V respectively).


The ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, each process being approximately 20 min long, and then dried under a stream of dry nitrogen. Subsequently, the ITO-coated glass substrate was treated by UV-ozone for 20 min. A PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, H. C. Starck) solution was then spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrates, and thermally treated at 150 °C for 15 min to get PEDOT:PSS films with a thickness of ∼40 nm.

The blend solutions of PTB7-Th and P(PDI-BDT-T) were prepared by simultaneously dissolving PTB7-Th and P(PDI-BDT-T) with D/A weight ratios of 2:1, 1.5:1 or 1:1, in dichlorobenzene with or without solvent additives (DIO, CN and NMP), and spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The active layers were treated by thermal annealing at 100 °C and 120 °C for 10 min under nitrogen conditions, resulting in active layers with a film thickness of ∼90 nm. Then, 20 nm thick Ca layers covered with a 100 nm Al electrode were thermally deposited under a pressure of 2 × 10−4 Pa through a shadow mask on top of the active layer. The active area of the pixels, as defined by the overlap of the anode and cathode areas, was 0.04 cm2. The thickness was measured using an Ambios Technology D-100 surface profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured in N2 atmosphere using an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an irradiation light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured by the Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technology CO., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

As shown in Scheme 1, P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Stille-coupling reactions with yields of 37% and 71%, respectively. The polymer shows good solubility in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index of polymers P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) are 17.3 K/1.48 and 25.0 K/1.7, respectively, and were estimated by high temperature gel permeation chromatography at 160 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the solvent and polystyrene with narrow molecular weight distribution as the standard.


The thermal stability of P(PDI-BDT-T) was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. 2a. P(PDI-BDT-T) shows a sufficiently high decomposition temperature of ca. 360 °C, indicating that the thermal stability is sufficient for application as a photovoltaic material in PSCs. From the DSC thermograms of P(PDI-BDT-T) (Fig. 2b), no obvious exotherm or endotherm peaks were observed from 50 to 250 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, which means that this polymer is amorphous.



Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of the polymer donor and acceptors in the thin films. The absorption spectrum of the polymer donor PTB7-Th film displays three main absorption peaks with λmax at 483, 638 and 696 nm. The polymer acceptor P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) films show three absorption peaks at 376, 537 and 649 nm and 385, 547 and 656 nm, respectively. The absorption spectrum of the P(PDI-BDT-T) film is red-shifted by ca. 10 nm with respect to that of P(PDI-BDT-O), which could be ascribed to the introduction of the conjugated side chains in the 2D polymer P(PDI-BDT-T). The absorption edges of P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) are at 748 and 757 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eg) of 1.66 and 1.64 eV, respectively. In addition, the absorption peaks of P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) show a similar stronger intensity at 350–450 nm, compared with that of PTB7-Th. Thus, the absorption spectra of PTB7-Th and P(PDI-BDT-O) or P(PDI-BDT-T) are complementary to each other in the entire visible range.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) on the thin film of the working electrode. As shown in the cyclic voltammograms of P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) (see Fig. 3b), the onset reduction and oxidation potentials (Ered and Eox) of P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) were −0.83/0.78 V and −0.82/0.99 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. Thus, in accordance with the equations: HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV) and LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV), the HOMO and LUMO levels of P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) were calculated to be −5.47/−3.88 eV and −5.70/−3.89 eV, respectively. Obviously, the LUMO levels of P(PDI-BDT-O) and P(PDI-BDT-T) with BDT as the donor unit in the polymers are up-shifted by ca. 0.1 eV, in comparison with that of the PDI-based n-type polymer with dithienothiophene as the donor unit, due to the better ionization potential of the functional group BDT segment. The higher LUMO energy level could be beneficial for a high Voc of all-PSCs with the polymer as the acceptor, since the Voc of the PSCs is proportional to the difference of the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.

The photovoltaic properties of the polymer acceptor P(PDI-BDT-T) or P(PDI-BDT-O) were investigated by fabricating all-PSCs with PTB7-Th as the donor and P(PDI-BDT-T) or P(PDI-BDT-O) as acceptor with the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) or P(PDI-BDT-O)/Ca/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide, PEDOT is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and PSS is poly(styrene sulfonate). Initially, we investigated the effect of the D/A weight ratios of PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) on the photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with different D/A ratios (2:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1) under illumination at AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and the PCE, are outlined in Table 1. Obviously, the optimal D/A ratio of the blend active layers is 1.5:1, the optimum efficiency of 4.31% is observed for the device based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) (1.5:1, w/w) with a Jsc of 11.06 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V and FF of 48.6%. In terms of the optimum D/A blend ratio (1.5:1, w/w), the thermal annealing (100 °C and 120 °C) and solvent additive (DIO, CN, NMP) treatment were performed to further improve the photovoltaic performance. A slightly improved PCE of 4.71% was obtained with a Jsc of 11.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V and FF of 51.1% for the all-PSC by using 1 vol% CN (see Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, the PCEs of the devices with the additive of 1 vol% DIO and 1 vol% NMP are 4.37% and 4.39%, respectively. However, the photovoltaic performance of the devices after thermal annealing decreased a little, the PCEs of the PSCs after the thermal annealing at 100 °C or 120 °C for 10 min were 4.15% and 4.17%, respectively (see Fig. S2 and Table S1 in ESI). The good photovoltaic performance (PCE of 4.71%) of the all-PSCs without the need for thermal annealing is an advantage of the polymer acceptor P(PDI-BDT-T). Meanwhile, for the control polymer acceptor P(PDI-BDT-O), the PCE of the all-PSC based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-O) (1.5:1, w/w) is only 2.69% with a Jsc of 9.60 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, and FF of 38.8%. After the 1 vol% CN solvent additive treatment, the PCE of the all-PSC with P(PDI-BDT-O) as the acceptor improved a little to 2.75% with a Jsc of 10.14 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, and FF of 37.6%. Obviously, the 2D-conjugated polymer P(PDI-BDT-T) exhibits better photovoltaic performance than the control 1D polymer P(PDI-BDT-O) when they are used as acceptors in all-PSCs.

Fig. 4b displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) or PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-O) (1.5:1, w/w). The EQE plots show a broad peak covering the wavelength range from 350 nm to ca. 800 nm, which corresponds to the absorptions of both the polymer donor and the polymer acceptor. The enhanced EQE values at ca. 400 nm and in the range of 500–600 nm should result from the absorption of the polymer acceptor. In comparison to the EQE values of the PSCs based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) without and with 1% CN additive, the maximum EQE value in the wavelength range of ca. 640–730 nm is enhanced from 52% to 58%, which is consistent with the increased Jsc of the devices after the 1% CN additive treatment. The higher EQE values and larger Jsc values of the all-PSCs with P(PDI-BDT-T) as the acceptor should result from the stronger absorption in the long-wavelength range of 640–730 nm. The maximum EQE value of the PSC based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-O) is 47% without solvent additive, and 49% after the 1 vol% CN additive treatment. The EQE values are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.

In order to understand the effect of the D/A weight ratios of the active layer on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, the charge carrier mobility was measured for the pure polymer P(PDI-BDT-T) or P(PDI-BDT-O) and the polymer blends of PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) with different D/A ratios (2:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1, w/w), by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 5 and Fig. S4 in ESI show the current–voltage plots for the mobility measurements, and Table 2 lists the hole and electron mobility values obtained from the measurements. It can be seen from Table 2 that the electron mobility of pure P(PDI-BDT-T) and P(PDI-BDT-O) are 3.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the electron mobility of the P(PDI-BDT-T) film is superior to that of the P(PDI-BDT-O) film, which could be ascribed to the introduction of the thiophene conjugated side chain on the BDT unit. The electron mobility of pure P(PDI-BDT-T) is one order higher than that of the polymer blends with D/A weight ratios of 1.5:1 and 1:1, and two orders higher than that of the polymer blend with a weight ratio of 2:1. The results indicate that blending PTB7-Th into P(PDI-BDT-T) disrupted the P(PDI-BDT-T) domains and influenced the electron pathway of the P(PDI-BDT-T) network, and a too high PTB7-Th concentration in the blend film with a D/A weight ratio of 2:1 led to a significant decrease in the electron mobility of the blend film. Interestingly, the hole mobilities of the polymer blend films with weight ratios of 2:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1 are approximately in the same order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, less dependent on the D/A weight ratios. Obviously, it is very important to increase the electron mobility of the polymer blend films to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs.

The morphology control of the active layer plays a very important role in the optimization of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. To understand the effect of the D/A weight ratios and solvent additive on the morphology of the active layers and on the photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs, we measured the morphology of the polymer blend films with different D/A weight ratios and without or with different solvent additives. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of pure P(PDI-BDT-T) and the polymer blend films with different weight ratios, as shown in Fig. S3 in ESI, reveal that the surface roughness of the pure P(PDI-BDT-T) film is 0.48 nm, and that of the blends with weight ratios of 2:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1 increased to 1.16, 1.33 and 1.29 nm, respectively. The results indicate that the surface roughness is less dependent on the D/A weight ratios in the polymer blend films in the all-PSCs. Fig. 6 shows the AFM images of the PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) blend films (1.5:1, w/w) without and with different additives. There is also no big difference in the surface morphology of the polymer blend films with different solvent additive treatment conditions.

We further studied the morphology of the polymer blend films by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images of the PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) blends with different weight ratios (2:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1, w/w) are shown in Fig. S4 in ESI. We found that the TEM image of the blend with a weight ratio of 1.5:1 displays an appropriate interpenetrating network morphology. Thus, a higher PCE for the PSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1.5:1 is in agreement with the results observed from the TEM images. Fig. 7a–d shows the TEM images of the blend films without and with the solvent treatments of 1 vol% DIO, 1 vol% CN and 1 vol% NMP, respectively. The polymer blend films without and with the solvent treatments of 1% DIO and 1% NMP display similar morphologies according to the similar phase-separated sizes of the light and dark domains (Fig. 7a, b and d). The TEM image of the blend film after a 1 vol% CN solvent additive treatment shows a fibrous D/A interpenetrating network morphology with a febrile size of ca. 10 nm (Fig. 7c), which should be beneficial to the increased Jsc and FF of the all-PSCs based on the active layer after the solvent treatment of 1% CN as mentioned above.

In this study, an n-type 2D-conjugated polymer, P(PDI-BDT-T), is synthesized for application as an acceptor in all-PSCs. P(PDI-BDT-T) exhibits broad absorption in the visible light range and its absorption spectrum is complementary with that of the 2D-conjugated polymer donor PTB7-Th. The LUMO level of P(PDI-BDT-T) is −3.89 eV which is slightly higher than that of the traditional acceptor PCBM, which is suitable for applications as an acceptor in PSCs. The all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) demonstrated a higher PCE of 4.71% at the optimized conditions with a D/A weight ratio of 1.5:1 and with a 1% CN additive treatment. The results of the charge carrier mobility measurements and the TEM images confirm the optimized device fabrication conditions of all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:P(PDI-BDT-T) with a D/A weight ratio of 1.5:1 and with a solvent additive treatment of 1% CN. A corresponding 1D-conjugated polymer P(PDI-BDT-O) with an alkoxy substituent on its BDT unit was also synthesized and used as an acceptor in the all-PSCs for comparison with the 2D-conjugated polymer P(PDI-BDT-T). The PCE of the all-PSC with P(PDI-BDT-O) as the acceptor was only 2.75% under the same experimental conditions. The results indicate that 2D-conjugated n-type polymers with conjugated side chains on their donor units could be promising polymer acceptors for all-PSCs.
