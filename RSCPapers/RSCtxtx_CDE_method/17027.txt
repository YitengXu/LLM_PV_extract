A novel crosslinkable acetylacetone chelate, Hf(ACBV)4, was designed and synthesized using 1,3-bis(4-vinylphenyl)propane-1,3-dione (ACBV) and hafnium chloride (HfCl4). The obtained crosslinked chelate film exhibits excellent solvent-resistance property and was successfully applied as the electron transport layer in inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). The crosslinking property was proved by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and the unchanged UV-visible absorption of the crosslinked film after washing with chloroform. The obtained crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 film can effectively ameliorate the contact between ITO and the photoactive layer, facilitating the charge transfer process of the device. Moreover, the devices based on PM6:Y6 achieved an efficiency of 15.17% and exhibited excellent stability with 90% retention efficiency after 20 h of continuous illumination in air. Our work demonstrates a new approach in designing effective crosslinkable chelates as ETLs to improve the stability and efficiency of PSCs.

Studies of solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their potential for flexible and large-scale printing production. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs exceeded 16%, pushing the progress of PSCs to the key stage of laboratory-to-industry transfer. To meet requirements for further production and commercialization, the stability of PSCs should be further improved to make them more competitive. So far, to improve the stability, efforts have been put in such as designing novel active layers or interface materials, device architecture engineering and encapsulation technology. Specifically, inverted-structure PSCs with appropriate interface layers have shown great superiority in promoting the stability of PSCs. For the electron transport layer in inverted PSCs, in addition to reducing the interfacial contact resistance and optimizing the energy barrier, one of the fundamental properties is good solvent resistance to suppress film erosion during the multi-layer fabrication of solution-processed PSC devices. Among the various kinds of ETLs, metal chelates have been successfully applied as ETLs in PSCs due to their simple preparation and good structural tunability and can be regarded as promising alternatives for the future production of PSCs. However, for many metal-chelate ETLs, their application in the inverted devices, as well as the viability to act as the intermediate layer for tandem devices, is severely limited by their poor solvent resistance.

Crosslinking has been proved to be an effective approach to simultaneously improve the stability and solvent resistance of ETLs; many crosslinkable materials have been successfully developed and applied in high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and perovskite solar cells. Generally, the crosslinked materials can be obtained using an in situ crosslinking strategy or by introducing crosslinkable functional units through chemical bonds, among which the latter exhibits an easier preparation process and better producibility. Moreover, many functional groups can be introduced and it is very important to select the most suitable one for a PSC based on their characteristics. Materials grafted with vinyl, acrylate, oxetane, or azide functionalities tend to crosslink under different stimuli, such as light, heat, or (light) initiators, which is a facile and efficient crosslinking method to improve the solvent resistance properties. However, the crosslinking of acrylates requires photoinitiators and the residues of photoinitiator decomposition remain in the interface. In addition, the crosslinking reaction of azides results in the release of nitrogen and the formation of highly reactive nitrene units which could attack the side chains of the polymer and insert into the conjugated backbone. Moreover, for the activation of oxetane, an acid source or prolonged thermal activation are required. The residues of the acid catalyst and the counterions of photoacid generators can negatively influence device properties. Promisingly, the addition of styrene as a highly conjugated functional group theoretically further enhances the transport properties of the molecules. Meanwhile, the activation of styrene requires only annealing, without causing any of the negative influences mentioned above. In summary, the styrene monomer with excellent crosslinking characteristics is one of the most suitable functional groups for the design of crosslinkable ETLs and the preparation of stable and efficient PSCs.
In our previous work, we reported an acetylacetonate chelate (Hf(Acac)4) with the advantages of simple preparation, good stability and amazing adaptability, though its solvent resistance does need to be improved to protect the ETL against erosion by the organic solvent in inverted PSCs. In this contribution, a crosslinkable ligand, 1,3-bis(4-vinylphenyl)propane-1,3-dione (ACBV), was synthesized by introducing styrene groups to the end of the acetylacetone, which subsequently chelated with hafnium to obtain the final material Hf(ACBV)4. After thermal crosslinking, the Hf(ACBV)4 film exhibits excellent solvent resistance and thermal stability, resulting in almost no decrease in absorption intensity after washing with chloroform. Moreover, a photoactive layer with good phase separation and lower contact resistance can be obtained in the PSCs using crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as an ETL. As a result, a high PCE of 15.17% is achieved in the inverted PSCs fabricated using efficient donor material PM6 and acceptor material Y6 blend film as the photoactive layer. Comparing the stability of devices using different ETLs under the same conditions, devices employing the crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as the ETL exhibited the best operational stability with almost no change in open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a 90% retention of PCE after 20 h of continuous illumination.

The synthetic route of the chelate is depicted in Scheme 1 and the detailed synthesis procedures and characterizations are described in the synthesis section. ACBV can be easily synthesized in two steps through a Stille coupling reaction between C3 and trimethyl(vinyl)stannane. It is worth noting that the styrene groups on the obtained chelate facilitate the thermal-induced crosslinking without the use of any initiator. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were applied to investigate the thermal properties of ACBV and Hf(ACBV)4. First, the DSC process was performed under nitrogen atmosphere and the sample was heated from room temperature to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. As seen in Fig. 1a, the first scan for ACBV shows an endothermic peak at 121 °C and an exothermic peak at 130 °C, which correspond to the crystallization and crosslinking processes, respectively. Additionally, ACBV shows a broad glass transition (Tg) near 200 °C; such thermal behavior has also presented in other crosslinkable materials with styrene groups. The second scan process was carried out under the same conditions. However, the endothermic and exothermic processes were absent in the second scan process, indicating the complete crosslinking of ACBV. The DSC plots of Hf(ACBV)4 were obtained under the same conditions and, in comparison with ACBV, exhibited a much higher endothermic peak at 241 °C and also a higher exothermic peak at 252 °C (Fig. 1b). It can be speculated that, due to the increased backbone rigidity of the Hf(ACBV)4 chelate, it becomes more difficult for the styrene groups to encounter each other, resulting in the requirement of a higher temperature for the crosslinking reaction of Hf(ACBV)4. The thermal crosslinking property of Hf(ACBV)4 was also studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-visible absorption spectra. Fig. 1c shows the FTIR spectra of Hf(ACBV)4 before and after the crosslinking reaction. After crosslinking, the characteristic peak of the stretching vibration of the C–H bond of unsaturated hydrocarbons with a wavenumber exceeding 3000 cm−1 was reduced and the characteristic peak of saturated hydrocarbons below 3000 cm−1 appeared. Moreover, the characteristic peak of the CC stretching vibration of the vinyl group at 1630 cm−1 and the characteristic peaks of flexural vibration at 990 cm−1 and 910 cm−1 decreased significantly after crosslinking. This shows that most of the vinyl groups reacted and few remained. The effective reaction of the vinyl groups provides the good crosslinking performance and solvent resistance properties of Hf(ACBV)4. Subsequently, we investigated the solvent resistance of the crosslinked ETLs. As exhibited in Fig. 1d, the absorption strength of the uncrosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 film obviously decreased after chloroform washing, indicating that the Hf(ACBV)4 film does not have solvent resistance property before cross-linking and is easily eroded by organic solvents. However, the almost-overlapping absorption spectra of crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 before and after washing with chloroform indicates its excellent solvent resistance properties.

To explore the surface morphology of the films, we performed tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) tests on the ACBV and Hf(ACBV)4 films and the corresponding crosslinked films. As shown in Fig. 2a, the ACBV film without any post-treatment has a uniform morphology and large phase separation size with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of only 1.06 nm. However, the surface morphology of the ACBV after thermal annealing was even more uniform and the phase separation size became much smaller, while the RMS roughness barely changed. In Fig. 2c, uniform nanoparticles were observed in the surface morphology of the Hf(ACBV)4 film due to the self-assembly of highly conjugated metal chelates. However, as demonstrated in Fig. 2d, significant changes can be seen in the morphology of crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 film, in which the nanoparticles disappeared and the RMS roughness increased to 3.78 nm. The increased roughness of Hf(ACBV)4 film after thermal annealing indicates that the contact area between the crosslinked ETL and the photoactive layer effectively increased, leading to facilitated electron transport. To further understand the role of ETLs on the active layer morphology, the surface topographies of the active layer films spin-coated on the different ETLs are also shown in Fig. 2. All the films show relatively uniform surface topographies present in the active layer films coated on crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 (Fig. 2l). Uniform nanofibrillar texture can also be observed in Fig. 2p, indicating that an interpenetrating network structure with good phase separation can be obtained in the active layer film coated on the crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 film.
For further observation of the photoelectric properties of ETL, uniform films were produced on glass substrates through spin-coating the corresponding solutions of ACBV, crosslinked ACBV, Hf(ACBV)4, crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4, PM6 and Y6, respectively. The crosslinked thin film samples were thermally treated at 240 °C for 30 min before the test. Fig. 3a shows the normalized absorption spectra of the ACBV, crosslinked ACBV, Hf(ACBV)4, and crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 films and the active layer materials PM6 and Y6. It can be seen that ACBV shows an absorption peak at 335 nm and the absorption peak of the crosslinked ACBV is at 329 nm. The absorption peak of Hf(ACBV)4 is at 368 nm and that of crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 is at 364 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra before and after the crosslinking reaction maintained good consistency, indicating that the photophysical properties of the material before and after crosslinking were basically the same. Meanwhile, the two photoactive layer materials of PM6 and Y6 show complementary absorption in the entire visible light range to the near-infrared region without overlapping with the absorption of ETLs. In Fig. 3b and c, in addition to the optical properties, the energy levels of Hf(ACBV)4 and crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 were also examined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. The onsets of the photoemission energies of Hf(ACBV)4 and crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 are 17.41 eV and 17.32 eV, respectively, and the work functions of Hf(ACBV)4 and crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 are calculated to be 3.81 eV and 3.90 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Hf(ACBV)4 are −6.06 eV and −3.27 eV, respectively, while crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 exhibits lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −6.10 eV and −3.29 eV. According to the above tests, the crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4, with its suitable photoelectric and thermodynamic properties, is a good candidate for the ETL of inverted devices.
To further verify the feasibility of ACBV, crosslinked ACBV, Hf(ACBV)4 and crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as ETLs in PSCs, devices with the inverted structure of ITO/ETL/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Al were fabricated and tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The energy level diagram of the active layer and ETL materials is shown in Fig. 3d. As depicted in Fig. 3e and summarized in Table 1, the PSCs without an ETL show a faint PCE of 10%, a VOC of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.49 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 57.1%. When using ACBV as the ETL, the JSC, VOC and FF values of the device rise to 24.57 mA cm−2, 0.80 V and 64.57%, respectively, yielding a final efficiency of 11.70%. For the devices using Hf(ACBV)4 without post-treatment as an ETL, the PCE improved to more than 13%. By replacing the ETL with crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4, the obtained PCE of the device significantly improved to 15.17% with a JSC of 25.69 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.83 V and an FF of 73.1%. Compared with the device without an ETL, the VOC of the PSCs is significantly improved after adding organic ligands or chelates. The addition of an ETL can change the contact between the electrode and the active layer to ohmic contact, effectively align the energy levels of each functional layer, and minimize the energy band barrier. The crosslinked organic ligand and complex film have excellent solvent resistance, making the VOC of the PSC with a crosslinked organic ligand even higher than that of the device with an uncrosslinked chelate. Finally, the PSC with crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as the ETL obtained the highest VOC because of its more suitable energy level and better surface topography. Moreover, the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are depicted in Fig. 3f. Compared with the device without an ETL, the optimized devices using crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as the ETL exhibited higher EQE values throughout the whole photo-response wavelength range and the integrated current was 24.90 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the results obtained from the J–V current.

To evaluate the device stability, we characterized the photovoltaic properties of the inverted PSCs using different ETLs under continuous illumination (20 h in air). This stability test in the air not only tests the photostability of the device, but also the integral stability of the PSCs. Continuous illumination increases the ambient temperature of the device and the presence of moisture and oxygen in the air can be regarded as \ detection conditions very close to the actual environment. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 4a that the VOC of the device using crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as the ETL reaches a maximum after around 3 h and then barely decreases. The JSC, FF and final PCE values of the crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4-based devices retain about 90% after 20 h illumination, exhibiting much better stability than those using pristine Hf(ACBV)4 and other ETLs. In addition, ZnOx, a common metal oxide ETL material, was applied to prepare the inverted PSC devices and was tested under the same conditions for comparison. As we can see, the JSC of the ZnOx-based devices dropped sharply under constant illumination, demonstrating much worse stability than the device based on crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4. The results indicate that Hf(ACBV)4 could be an excellent ETL for enhancing the stability and lifetime of PSCs.

In conclusion, an acetylacetone-based crosslinkable metal chelate (Hf(ACBV)4) was developed and applied as the ETL to improve the stability and efficiency of PSCs. The obtained metal complex exhibits an excellent crosslinkable property and solvent resistance. Meanwhile, the increased surface area achieved in the PSCs using crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 as the ETL can enhance the contact area with the photoactive layer and potentially decrease the contact resistance. Consequently, the PM6:Y6-based PSCs with Hf(ACBV)4 as the ETL achieve a high PCE of 15.17%. More importantly, crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4-based PSCs exhibited much better illumination stability than the pristine ACBV and Hf(ACBV)4 and even the commonly-used ETL ZnOx. The outstanding solvent resistance and stability of crosslinked Hf(ACBV)4 make it a good candidate for the preparation of solution-processed inverted or tandem PSCs prepared via printing, shed a light on the optimization of metal chelate-based ETLs and are beneficial to the future development of highly efficient and stable PSCs.

In this work, we designed and fabricated PSCs with the device structure as follows: ITO/Hf(ACBV)4/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Al. The production process was as follows: The ITO glass substrates were sequentially washed by ultrasonic treatment in a cleanser, water, ultrapure water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and subsequently dried in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min in air. After cooling, the ITO glass substrates were transferred to a glove-box to be spin-coated with a Hf(ACBV)4 ethanol solution (1 mg·ml−1) at 4000 rpm for 30 s and were then baked at 240 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere. The photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating a trichloromethane solution of PM6:Y6 (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration of 8 mg mL−1) with a 0.5% volume ratio of chloronaphthalene additive on the Hf(ACBV)4-coated ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Chloronaphthalene was added to the active layer solution 30 minutes before spin coating. Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm metal electrode Al were thermally deposited in a vacuum chamber.


The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of devices were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove-box using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure unit (SMU) under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (SAN-EI, AAA grade). An AC Mode III (Agilent) atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in the tapping mode under normal atmosphere and room temperature was used to measure the surface morphologies of the active layer.
