Hole transport material (HTM)-assisted halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated excellent performances in photovoltaic technology within a short period of time. Herein, cost-effective hole transport materials (HTMs), namely BTBDT and BTDTP, were successfully synthesized using thiophene, and engineered into perovskite devices, exhibiting a higher photovoltaic performance than that of the commercially available Spiro-OMeTAD. The PSCs with BTBDT and BTDTP HTMs exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.96% and 17.60%, respectively. Under the exact conditions, the test device employing Spiro-OMeTAD demonstrated a PCE of 13.16%. The champion short-circuit density of 25.73 mA cm−2 was achieved in the present study for the BTDTP-assisted PSC. Furthermore, the device stability was examined after 60 days, demonstrating a PCE of 16.08% for BTDTP, which was much more stable than the Spiro-OMeTAD device (5.89%). Besides the unique device performance, the significant features such as simple synthetic process, dopant-free conditions and cost effectiveness of BTBDT and BTDTP make them plausible alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport material in PSCs.

Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite materials have attracted significant attention in solar photovoltaic technology due to their notable characteristics, such as concentrated and wide light collecting capability, modifiable band gap, ambipolar charge transport, low cost, easy processing techniques and maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE). Recently, perovskite solar cells have attracted much academic and industrial interest. Researchers have focused on enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by designing various materials as hole- and electron-transport materials by changing the composition of perovskite materials and altering the device fabrication processes. PSCs are one of the promising technologies in cost-effective photovoltaics. The performance of PSCs is strongly dependent on deposition process, hole transport materials, interfacial microstructure engineering, etc. Generally, the development of new hole-transport materials (HTMs) has become one of the strongly pursued fields in research. Several HTMs such as organic polymers, metal-phthalocyanines, and heterocyclic compounds have been reported for PSCs. Within few years of active research, the two-step processed perovskite solar cell gave a record and certified efficiency of 23.7%. Generally, efficient PSCs are fabricated with CH3NH3PbX3, where X = I, Cl, and Br are commonly used as a light absorbing thin layer in the visible range with improved film stability and good carrier mobility. Recent results witnessed not only a remarkable advancement in the performance of devices, but also a significant reduction in the cost of the fabrication process. The first silicon-based device was prepared in 1954 by Chapin, and its progress towards third generation PV technologies was described by Tang in the year 1986. However, no other solar cell technology has received much attention than the present PSCs. In conventional PSCs, the negative–intrinsic–positive (n–i–p) device structure can be alienated as mesoscopic, in which a solution of perovskites is introduced into the mesoporous scaffold of a semiconductor such as TiO2 (TCO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite layer/HTM film/metal). In contrast, in planar heterojunctions, the device structure is TCO/ETM/perovskite layer/HTM film/metal (in this structure, the perovskite is inserted between the hole and electron selective contacts) structure. Currently, scientists are focused on synthesizing a variety of HTMs with different chemical nature for inverted p–i–n and conventional n–i–p perovskite solar cells.

Organic HTMs have potential due to their simple processing conditions, which are well suited for the fabrication of perovskite films in the development of devices. Nevertheless, the organic nature of HTMs results in relatively low hole mobility, and thus they require suitable chemical dopants such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) for an increase in device efficiency. Furthermore, the hygroscopic nature of some additives promotes device degradation. 2,2′7,7′-Tetrakis[N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) has low conductivity and low hole mobility in its pristine form, leading to a diminished performance. The addition of 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP) to LiTFSI can significantly enhance its film forming capability towards the hole transport layer by reducing the number of pinholes, and avoids the aggregation of lithium salt by favoring its distribution. However, the cost of $174–484 per g for the commercially available Spiro-OMeTAD and $350 per g for polytriarylamine (PTAA) limit the use of these materials in the development of PSCs as efficient HTMs and their large-scale production. Spiro-OMeTAD exhibited the PCE of 21% in PSCs by employing the appropriate fabrication technique. However, the tedious synthetic procedure, high cost and insufficient device stability associated with Spiro-OMeTAD hamper its practical application and signify the need for the development of new HTMs as its replacement. Accordingly, dopant-free HTMs for PSCs have exhibited significant potential in recent years. Dopant-free HTMs overcome the disadvantages of poor device stability, and undesirable ion migration and interactions related with HTMs containing dopant materials.
Generally, HTMs contain strong acceptor or donor groups, and thus a change in their arrangement in their ground state can result in induced doping. Nazeeruddin M. K. et al. described three triazatruxene/dicyanovinylene D–A conjugates, which served as dopant-free HTMs and achieved a PCE of 19.03%. Under the same conditions, perovskite solar cells were fabricated using the commercially available Spiro-OMeTAD, which was further doped with LiTFSI, tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine) cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide) (FK209) and 4-tBP, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 19.01%. Li and coworkers studied a triphenenylamine/tricyanoethylene conjugate, BTPA-TCNE, as a zwitterionic HTM, which achieved a PCE of 16.94%. However, despite their merits, most of the described dopant-free HTMs for PSCs suffer from the disadvantages of tedious and complex synthetic and purification methods, which limit their extensive applications. Hence well-organized dopant-free HTMs with user-friendly and simple synthetic routes are highly desirable.
Furthermore, the design and synthesis of inexpensive, scalable HTMs without sacrificing device performance are highly necessary for the commercialization of PSCs. Accordingly, the present work demonstrates the design and development of cost-effective, efficient HTMs for the fabrication of PSCs using highly abundant and inexpensive precursor materials. Two new multi-chromophoric combinations of small molecular D–π–A conjugate hole transport materials, BTBDT and BTDTP, with a D–A–D–A–D-type structure having benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as the donor, 5-octyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione as the acceptor and benzo[b]thiophenes as donor moieties were synthesized, respectively. Furthermore, the electronic, thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties of BTBDT and BTDTP were systematically evaluated. Both HTMs have a high HOMO energy level, which is related to Spiro-OMeTAD. The hole mobility nature of BTBDT and BTDTP was estimated by fabricating organic thin-film field effect transistor (O-TFET) devices. PSCs were developed using the most common perovskite, MAPbI3, and implementing the simple assembly of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Ag. BTBDT and BTDTP were used as hole transport materials without any dopants, which resulted in PCEs of 16.96% and 17.60%, respectively. Under the same fabrication circumstances, PSCs with Spiro-OMeTAD doped with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide lithium salt and 4-tert-butylpyridine as the HTM showed a PCE of 13.1%. The champion JSC (short-circuit density) of 25.73 mA cm−2 was achieved for the BTDTP-assisted device. Thus, the higher performance, easier synthetic method and lower fabrication cost of the BTBDT- and BTDTP-assisted devices compared to their equivalent Spiro-OMeTAD analogues demonstrate their widespread applicability.

The high purity chemicals and solvents used for the synthesis of the materials and fabrication of devices in the present study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and used without further purification.


The reaction schemes for the synthesis of the new hole transport materials (Schemes S1–S6), their details and NMR spectra are presented in the ESI. The details of the step-by-step calculation of the cost for both HTMs, BTBDT and BTDTP, are presented in the ESI. The details of the final compounds are given below.

Initially, 24 mL methylamine (33% in ethanol) was diluted in 100 mL of absolute ethanol. Then, 10 mL of 57 wt% aqueous hydroiodic acid was added to the above solution under continuous stirring at room temperature. After 1 h, the solvent was removed via rotary evaporation to obtain a while solid, which was thoroughly washed in dry diethyl ether and recrystallized using absolute ethanol.


The organic thin-film field-effect transistor substrates were obtained from Fraunhofer IPMS, with the substrates size of channel width: 10 mm, channel length: 20 μm, and channel height: 40 nm. The capacity of the gate was 15 nF, and a probe station was applied to examine the transistor, which was a home-made structure located in an argon-filled glove-box. The developed thin films were not exposed to normal atmosphere, and positioned over the substrates. The preparation of the sample was carried out in 15 min using substrates cleaned by oxygen plasma treatment. Film formation was done using 10 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution. The spin-coating technique was adopted, where the solution was spread over the substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s, and the resultant films were heated at 80 °C for 60 min before the measurements. Spiro-OMeTAD was obtained from 20 mM chlorobenzene solution.

For device fabrication, FTO-coated glass substrates of 7 Ω sq−1 (Solaronix, Switzerland) were etched in the desired pattern using zinc powder and 0.2 M HCl. The sheets were thoroughly cleaned sequentially with mild solar water, D.I. water, acetone, ethanol, and finally washed in isopropanol and subjected to ozone treatment for 10 min. A dense compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was deposited with 0.15 M acetylacetonate(titanium diisopropoxide bis) (75 wt% in isopropanol) in isopropanol solution in the ratio of 1:25 via the spin-coating method at 1000 rpm for 10 s followed by 4000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 125 °C for 10 min with the dropwise addition of chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent during second step progress. After cooling to room temperature, similar a methodology was adopted twice with 0.3 M acetylacetonate (titanium diisopropoxide bis) (75 wt% in isopropanol) in isopropanol solution, and further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer (m-TiO2) was coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s using 18 NR-T TiO2 paste (Greatcell Solar), which was diluted in absolute ethanol with a weight ratio of 1:15, and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The resultant substrates were treated with Ti-Nanoxide solution (Solaronix, T-L/SC) at 3000 rpm for 30 s and washed gently with deionized water, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 10 min. The following steps were performed for the fabrication of the perovskite solar cell in a dry atmosphere. The mesoporous TiO2 film was immersed in PbI2 solution in anhydrous DMF (462 mg/mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere (glove box) using the spin-coating method, and heated to 70 °C. After 10 min, the substrates were dipped in CH3NH3I solution made with anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (10 mg mL−1) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), stirred and ultrasonicated for 30 min at 120 °C. The perovskite film was formed over the TiO2 and the FTO glass/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite film was finally obtained.

The inexpensive, as-synthesized HTMs (BTBDT and BTDTP) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (1 mL), followed by ultrasonication for 10 min. For comparison, the commercially available Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by doping 29 μL of 4-tBP and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide solution in dry acetonitrile (521 mg mL−1)), and the obtained solutions are shown in Fig. 1. The obtained HTM solutions were spin cast at 4000 rpm over the perovskite film for 20 s.


The silver electrode film was sputtered at ∼5 × 10−5 Torr, at a rate of ∼1 Å s−1. The fabricated PSC with BTDTP is depicted in Fig. 2. A metal mask with an open area of 0.12 cm2 was used during characterization.


Fluorescence and absorption studies were carried out using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence and Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra were recorded with a Bruker Advance spectrometer (500 MHz). ESI-HRMS data were obtained on a Thermofinngan mass spectrometer. TGA (thermogravimetric analysis), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis were performed as mentioned in our previous report. The powder XRD (X-ray diffraction) studies were performed using a Rigaku instrument with the Cu anode wavelength (λ) of 1.5406 Å. The J-V (photocurrent density–voltage) characteristics were examined using simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 generated with a PECCELL solar simulator (AM 1.5 G illumination) together with a source meter (2401N Keithley Instruments Inc). The illuminated light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) performance as a function of wavelength was determined using a custom-made unit consisting of a 150 W xenon lamp, source meter, and monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were conducted with an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.


The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile is presented in Fig. 3 to investigate the perovskite crystalline phase, and the results confirm the existence of the tetragonal phase of the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 film on the FTO glass substrate. It can clearly be seen in Fig. 3 that the crystalline domains are oriented highly in the in-plane direction. Precisely, the present XRD pattern of perovskite is uniformly distributed and highly ordered, which is assigned to the (110) and (002) planes of the CH3NH3PbI3 structure, well consistent with the previous reports. Besides, the distinct XRD planes present in the as-formed high-quality perovskite structure in the present work correspond to the (220) and (310) planes. Remarkably, visible changes were observed during the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin film, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. However, the pristine perovskite structure was remarkably preserved, and additional diffraction peaks were resolved around the original (220) and (004) planes. The broadening of the scattered peaks may be related to the nanocrystallinity.

To deeper understand the surface morphology and microstructure of the developed perovskite films, SEM measurements were conducted. Both the planar and cross-sectional views from the SEM studies are presented in Fig. 4(a)–(c), in which visible changes in film morphology and microstructures can be found. The magnified view analysis demonstrated a homogeneous nanostructure was formed with defined perovskite grains and an average size of 40 nm sized with dense packing. The observed microstructural results are attributed to the better crystallization of the fabricated perovskite film. A schematic illustration of the fabricated perovskite solar cell with a cross-sectional view is depicted in Fig. 4(c). The fabricated device structure is Ag/HTM/perovskite/mesoporous TiO2/compact TiO2/FTO glass. According to the SEM cross-sectional studies, the thickness of each layer was evaluated to be 60 nm for c-TiO2, 530 nm for m-TiO2, 60 nm for HTMs and 80 nm for the silver electrode film.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra for BTBDT and BTDTP were recorded in CHCl3 (ca. 10−5 M), as presented in Fig. S1, and the obtained results are summarized in Table S1. The synthesized compounds showed an absorption in the range of 265–450 nm, and exhibited two main absorption peaks in the ultraviolet and visible region. Both BTBDT and BTDTP showed similar absorption maxima at 438 (13208 M−1 cm−1), 360 (44324 M−1 cm−1), and 267 (42965 M−1 cm−1), and 440 (17611 M−1 cm−1), 342 (60614 M−1 cm−1), and 266 (34515 M−1 cm−1) nm, respectively. The observed high molar extinction coefficients of these small molecules may result in enhanced light harvesting. However, the lower molar extinction coefficient of BTBDT compared to that of BTDTP indicates that it has lower light harvesting capacity. The UV-Vis absorption spectra recorded for both HTMs in different solvents are shown in Fig. S2 and the obtained results are listed in Table S2. A difference in the solvation of the ground and first excited state of a probe molecule results in solvatochromism. The absorption spectra of these compounds in different solvents show positive solvatochromism. BTBDT exhibited a 10 nm red shift with an increase in polarity from hexane to methanol and BTDTP exhibited a 20 nm red shift from hexane to methanol. The emission spectra of BTBDT and BTDTP in chloroform and different solvents are depicted in Fig. S3 and S4, respectively, and achieved results are presented in Table S3.BTBDT has an emission wavelength at 619 nm and BTDTP at 585 nm in chloroform solution. The emission spectra of BTDTP in different solvents also displayed positive solvatochromism, whereas that of BTBDT was uninform in various solvents. The electrochemical properties of BTBDT and BTDTP were measured through cyclic voltammetry studies. The experiments were executed under a nitrogen atmosphere in dry dichloromethane. Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) was used as the electrolyte, and the scan rate was maintained at 100 mV s−1. The resultant CV plots are presented in Fig. S5. Both materials displayed a reversible oxidation and reduction nature. The respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials are presented in Table S4. The as-synthesized BTBDT and BTDTP exhibited identical oxidation and similar reduction potentials. Even though the central donor atom present in both compounds is different, they illustrated the same oxidation potentials. This may be due to the presence of the benzothiophene unit, which is common for both HTMs. Since the acceptor moiety is similar in both compounds, they presented similar reduction potentials. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of BTBDT and BTDTP were evaluated based on their oxidation and reduction potentials, and the results are presented in Table S4. The HOMO energy levels of the as-synthesized BTBDT and BTDTP are close to the work function of the Ag electrode (−5.1 eV) and suitable for the inoculation of holes into HTMs. The calculated electrochemical bandgap for BTBDT is 2.30 eV and BTDTP 2.29 eV. The observed HOMO energy values of BTBDT and BTDTP also indicate that the synthesized materials can act as hole transporting materials (HTMs). The evaluation of the thermal stability of compounds is important and considered as one of the significant requirements for organic semiconductor materials. They should be thermally stable during the fabrication process. In the present study, BTBDT and BTDTP showed excellent thermal stability, as is evidenced in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plots presented in Fig. S6, and the obtained data is summarized in Table S5. The temperature corresponding to 5% weight loss for these compounds is around 345 °C. The TGA experiments were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C per min. This observation specifies the good thermal stability of BTBDT and BTDTP even at higher temperature, which is essential for vacuum deposition.
To determine the charge mobility nature, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) devices were fabricated using Spiro-OMeTAD, BTBDT and BTDTP. The hole drift mobilities of the OFETs were determined for all the HTMs (Spiro-OMeTAD, BTBDT, and BTDTP), as presented in Fig. 5, and the charge-carrier mobility was obtained from the linear fit (Ohm's law). The mobility of BTBDT and BTDTP was determined to be 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (μ = 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher hole mobility for BTBDT and BTDTP than that of Spiro-OMeTAD is reflected due to the good intermolecular contacts among the BTBDT and BTDTP molecules in the thin film state and simplifies their superior charge transport nature. The OC (output characteristics) of BTDTP indicated an improved saturation at Vds (drain–source voltage) of 80 V. The transfer characteristics (TC) were confirmed at an accurate equivalent voltage, demonstrating the characteristics of the transistor. However, the output characteristics of BTBDT were not good, and the obtained transfer characteristics are associated with BTDTP.
The contact angle estimations for water/HTM was measured to determine the atmospheric wetness, which may influence the stable performance of PSCs. The obtained results are depicted in Fig. 6, where the resultant contact angle is lower for the water and Spiro-OMeTAD interface compared to the water and BTBDT or BTDTP interfaces. This is because Spiro-OMeTAD is more hydrophilic than the BTBDT and BTDTP. Hence, the hydrophilic character of Spiro-OMeTAD will undermine the developed perovskite film stability, which results in a decrease in device stability performance.
The results of the optical steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements are presented in Fig. 7. Due to the high absorption coefficient of the perovskites, an absorption onset centered at ∼770 nm was achieved for all the films, demonstrating small dissimilarities in their absorption intensities and exhibiting their similar nature. The results of the photoluminescence spectroscopy give information on the quality of the perovskite layer, where longer carrier recombination lifetimes (τ) indirectly represent a higher charge diffusion length. The conductivity of the hole transport materials was studied as a function of the HTM film thickness, and the resultant plot is depicted in Fig. S7 in the ESI. The conductivity was high for all the HTM films with a thickness of 60 nm.
The typical J–V characteristics for FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/BTBDT/Ag and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/BTDTP/Ag perovskite solar cells were measured under 1 sun irradiance, as presented in Fig. 8. The obtained photovoltaic parameters include the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (η), as tabulated in Table 1. The devices fabricated using the new hole transport materials showed an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD device. The BTDTP-assisted device exhibited a champion PCE of 17.60%, which is higher than that with BTBDT (16.96%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (13.16%). The short circuit current density for BTDTP (25.73 mA cm−2) and BTBDT (24.68 mA cm−2) is higher when compared to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (23.26 mA cm−2). The device performance influenced by BTDTP and BTBDT resulted in an improvement in the fill factor of 70.51% and 72.33% as well as VOC of 0.97 and 0.95, respectively. This influence is more pronounced, leading to impressive values compared to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC of FF of 63.58% and VOC of 0.89. Furthermore, after 60 days, the device made with BTDTP exhibited a greater performance of 16.08% compared to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device (5.89%). The hysteresis behavior of the J–V plots (forward and reverse scans) is presented in Fig. S8 in the ESI. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) performance as a function of HTM films thickness of the fabricated devices studies and the results are illustrated in the ESI in Fig. S9. The highest PCE was observed at the HTM film thickness of 60 nm. The long term stability of the performance of the devices was examined for up to 1440 h, and the resulting plot is depicted in Fig. S10 in the ESI. The results demonstrated a PCE of 16.08% for BTDTP, which was more stable than the Spiro-OMeTAD device (5.89%) after 1440 h. The power conversion efficiency histograms with a Gaussian fit distribution were obtained for the fabricated perovskite solar cells, as presented in the Fig. 9. The homogeneity of the deposited thin layer of HTM over the perovskite layer was confirmed by conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies, as presented in Fig. S11 in the ESI.

IPCE (incident to photon current conversion efficiency) measurements for the devices fabricated using Spiro-OMeTAD, and the cost-effective BTBDT and BTDTP were carried out, and the obtained plots and the corresponding integrated photocurrent densities are presented in Fig. 10. All the devices exhibited broad and similar IPCE spectra with >70% IPCE observed in the range of 400 nm to 780 nm, which decreased and then became relatively stable after 820 nm, as a result of the efficient utilization of the absorbed photons. The devices fabricated using BTDTP and BTBDT exhibited slightly higher IPCE compared to that with Spiro-OMeTAD. The integrated short-circuit current density (Int-JSC) was evaluated from the IPCE spectra to be 24.43 mA cm−2, 23.11 mA cm−2 and 21.76 mA cm−2 for BTDTP, BTBDT and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC obtained from the J–V characteristics. The best performance was achieved for BTDTP compared to BTBDT and Spiro-OMeTAD.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were performed to estimate the charge transport parameters such as recombination resistance, charge conductivity and chemical capacitances of the fabricated perovskite solar cells. These evaluated parameters are essential for the analysis of the performance of the hole transport materials used. The Nyquist plots and Bode-phase curves of the PSCs made with the as-synthesized hole transport materials were characterized under 1 sun irradiance at VOC. Fig. 11(a) presents the EIS spectra with the fitting of the equivalent circuit model. Generally, the EIS spectra are separated by two arcs/regions, corresponding to high and low frequencies. In the present study, the EIS spectra showed one arc, which was comprised of merged arcs. The equivalent circuit consists of charge transfer resistance (RCT), series resistance (RS), chemical capacitance (CCT), recombination resistance (RREC), and chemical capacitance (CCT). The absence of electron recombination in the TiO2 network is ascribed to the thin TiO2 layer and low electron transfer resistance. Nevertheless, the first arc usually represents the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and hole transport material. After exposure to light, the photogenerated charge carriers are separated, which results in the holes moving through the HTM layer and the electrons transferred to the TiO2 film before reaching the electrodes. The BTDTP-assisted PSC gave the highest JSC, indicating the better adhesion between the HTM and perovskite film. Therefore, a decreased RCT was observed due to the superior contact and easy charge transfer in the vicinity of the perovskite film and HTM layer (Table 2).

According to the Bode-phase plots, the electron lifetimes (τe) were evaluated for all the HTM-assisted devices. The resultant Bode plots are depicted in Fig. 11(b), in which the frequency peaks are related to the charge transfer of the BTDTP-, BTBDT- and Spiro-OMeTAD-assisted devices at different interfaces. The characteristic peak frequency shifted towards a lower frequency for BTDTP, implying a longer electron lifetime.

DFT (density functional theory) and TDDFT (time-dependent DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 ab initio quantum chemical software package. To determine the ground-state geometry and estimate the transitions from the ground to the excited state, the DFT and TDDFT methods were used, respectively. The ground state geometries were optimized using the hybrid Becke, three-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr exchange–correlation functional (B3LYP) combined with the 6-31 G (d, p) basis set. The calculated vibrational spectrum of the optimized structures has no imaginary frequencies. This indicates that the optimized structures are situated at the minimum point of the potential surface. During the geometry optimization, no symmetry constraints were applied. To perform the calculations, the methyl groups were substituted in the place of long alkyl chains without altering the results. The absorption maxima of the molecules were predicted by calculating the lowest five excitations with the TDDFT methodology using the long-range CAM-B3LYP function with the 6-311+ G (d, p) basis set.

To gain insight into the observed photophysical properties, DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out for the molecules under study. The geometries of the two molecules in their ground state were fully optimized in the gas phase. For each molecule, four configurations were found to be stable on the potential energy surface based on the connectivity of the thiophene units. The optimized structures and relative energies (RE in kcal) together with the dihedral angles between the molecular planes are represented in Fig. 12 and 13, where it is clear that the molecules are planar in their ground state.
The calculated absorption energies are in good agreement with the experimental values and have absorption maxima in the range of 449 nm to 488 nm. The calculated absorption energies, oscillator strength, major transitions and percentage weight are shown in Table 3. In both molecules, the excitations mainly originate from the HOMO to LUMO transition, and the corresponding molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 14, where it is clear that the charge is delocalizing throughout the backbone of the molecules.
