Two solution-processable two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules based on triphenylamine (TPA) cores, TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, were designed and synthesized. As to TPA-BT-C8, two arms of the TPA core are symmetrically connected with a thiophene donor group and a benzothiadiazole acceptor group, while the third arm consists of a strong acceptor group of 2-(5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCM) connected through a trans double bond with the TPA core. For TPA-3Th, two arms of its TPA core are composed of only donor group, terthiophene, whereas the third arm consists of an acceptor group of cyano-n-octyl acetate connected through a trans double bond with the TPA core. The investigation indicated that TPA-BT-C8 has a lower energy band gap and wider absorption than TPA-3Th due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer effect in TPA-BT-C8. The two molecules have a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using TPA-BT-C8 or TPA-3Th as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor. All the devices have a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of about 0.9 eV. Devices based on TPA-BT-C8 have a much higher short circuit current (Jsc) (8.47 mA cm−2) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) (2.26%) than devices based on TPA-3Th (4.32 mA cm−2, 1.21%), resulting from wider solar light absorption of TPA-BT-C8 and better compatibility and film-formation ability of TPA-BT-C8 with PCBM than TPA-3Th. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra also confirmed that TPA-BT-C8 based devices have a wider and red-shifted response range than TPA-3Th based devices, which leads to a higher performance of the former devices.

Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have been receiving a great deal of attention in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, light weight and capability to be fabricated into flexible devices. In comparison with conjugated polymers, solution-processable organic small molecules possess the advantages of high purity, definite molecular weight, simple purification and better batch-to-batch reproducibility for the application in bulk-heterojunction OSCs. Therefore, solution-processable organic small molecules have drawn considerable interest and achieved great progress in recent years in OSCs.

The TPA unit possesses a three-dimensional propeller structure, which makes the TPA containing molecules exhibit good solution processability. Moreover, TPA is a strong electron-donor unit and has a good charge transport ability, and accordingly the TPA derivatives have high hole mobility and are widely used as hole-transporting materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and photovoltaic cells. The Yongfang Li group synthesized many star-shaped D–π–A structural molecules containing TPA as the core and different acceptor units or a combination of acceptor units and donor units as arms, and they applied these molecules in organic photovoltaic devices as donor materials. The Jean Roncali group developed some star-shaped TPA π-conjugated systems with internal charge-transfer (ICT) and used them as donor materials for heterojunction solar cells. In addition, other research groups also reported some star-shaped molecules based on TPA cores for photovoltaic applications. However, it is worth noting that for all of these reported TPA derivatives, their three arms are constructed by the same molecular structures or at least part of their three arms are the same. This more or less brings about some limitations to tune the photophysical properties, energy level and photovoltaic properties of the molecules.
The Alex K.-Y. Jen group reported two conjugated two-dimensional copolymers PFDCN and PFPDT with donor–π-bridge–acceptor side chains, which take advantage of nonlinear optical chromophores to optimize the absorption spectra and energy levels of the resultant polymers, and the two-dimensional conjugated structure of these polymers may improve their isotropic charge transport. Resultantly, both of the two copolymers exhibit excellent photovoltaic properties.
Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel solution-processable two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules, (E)-2-(3-(4-(bis(4-(7-(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)phenyl)amino)styryl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)malononitrile (TPA-BT-C8) and (E)-octyl-3-(4-(bis(4-([2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen]-5-yl)phenyl)amino)phenyl)-2-cyanoacrylate (TPA-3Th) (Scheme 1) by using a TPA based structure. Different from the common linear or star-shaped TPA derivatives, in TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, two arms of the TPA core are symmetrically connected with the donor and acceptor or just donor groups, while the third arm is connected with different electron-withdrawing groups through a trans double bond. The results indicated that both of the two molecules have a deep HOMO energy level, and TPA-BT-C8 has a lower energy band gap and wider solar light absorption than TPA-3Th. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using TPA-BT-C8 or TPA-3Th as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor. Both of the two devices have a high Voc. The device based on TPA-BT-C8 has a higher Jsc and PCE than the device based on TPA-3Th.

Mixed solutions for the active film and morphology investigation were prepared by dissolving TPA-BT-C8:PCBM and TPA-3Th:PCBM in the solvent of chlorobenzene with blend ratios of 1:1, 1:2.5 and 1:3, respectively, then continuously stirred overnight at 40 °C. The bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were prepared as follows: the ITO-covered glass substrate was used as the anode in the devices. It was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in turn. Then the substrates were treated in an oxygen plasma cleaner for about 5 min. Subsequently, PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated from an aqueous dispersion onto the cleaned ITO substrate to form a thin film with a thickness of about 50 nm. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, and the thickness was around 73 nm. Finally, the cathode of LiF/Al about 100 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The effective photovoltaic area as defined by the geometrical overlap between the bottom ITO electrode and the top cathode was 4 mm2. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Meter Measurement System in the dark or under 100 mW cm−2 illumination from a Sciencetech 500 W solar simulator (AM 1.5G). The class of Sciencetech 500 W solar simulator (AM 1.5G) is A.


The synthesis procedures of the two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules, TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, are depicted in Scheme 1. Compound 3 was synthesized via Stille reaction, and compounds 4 and 6 were synthesized via Suzuki reaction. Compound 5 was synthesized from isopropoxyboronic acid pinacol ester and lithiated 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene at −78 °C. The final molecules TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The chemical structures of the compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. The double peaks of coupling constant J ∼ 16 in 1H NMR spectra indicate that the double bond presents a trans configuration in TPA-BT-C8. The characteristic peak of the aldehyde group at a chemical shift of 10.0 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 6 disappears in that of TPA-3Th, while a single peak at a chemical shift of 8.114 ppm appears, which indicates that the trans double bond forms in TPA-3Th. Both TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene etc. at room temperature.



Fig. 1 shows the TGA curves of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th scanned at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under the protection of nitrogen. The 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) of TPA-BT-C8 is 227 °C, much higher than that of TPA-3Th which is 153 °C. As for low molecular weight materials, the Td of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th is high enough for photovoltaic device application.


The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th in a dilute chloroform solution (10−5 M) and in a solid thin film are shown in Fig. 2. The relevant spectroscopic data of the two small molecules are summarized in Table 1. In a dilute chloroform solution, TPA-BT-C8 exhibits two parts of absorption, a relative narrow absorption band with a peak at 329 nm and a wide absorption band with a maximum at 500 nm, which can be assigned to the intramolecular π–π* transition and the ICT interaction between the electron-donor and acceptor groups, respectively. As to TPA-3Th, it has no electron-acceptor group in the main chain except a weak cyano acrylate group in the third arm, so there is only a weak ICT band resulting from a somewhat smaller charge transfer from TPA to the cyano acrylate group. Moreover, the absorption band with a peak at 420 nm and a weakly discernible shoulder observed for TPA-3Th should correspond to the addition of a π–π* transition and the weak ICT band. Both of the two compounds have a relatively high molar absorption coefficient, which is 6.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for TPA-BT-C8 and 6.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for TPA-3Th calculated using Lambert–Beer's law.

Compared with the absorption spectra in dilute chloroform solutions, the absorption spectra of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th in solid films have a red shift of ∼20 nm. Because the three-dimensional structure of TPA restrains the π–π stacking effect of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, so the red shift in the solid state is not so high as other molecules. The maximum absorption peak of TPA-BT-C8 is at 330 nm, indicating that in thin solid films, the π–π* transition absorption is dominant, not like in dilute solution, the π–π* transition absorption and ICT interaction absorption are comparable. According to the onset of the optical absorption in thin films, the optical band gap (Eoptg) of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th is estimated to be 1.98 eV and 2.21 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile under the protection of nitrogen, using platinum button as the working electrode, Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 mol L−1) as the supporting electrolyte. Ferrocene was used as the internal standard and showed a peak at +0.1 V versus Ag/Ag+. The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3, and the electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th exhibit semi-reversible redox behavior. The onset oxidation potential (Eonsetox) and onset reduction potential (Eonsetred) of TPA-BT-C8 are ca. 0.68 and −1.13 V respectively, and for TPA-3Th, they are 0.65 and −1.20 V. From Eonsetox and Eonsetred of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, their HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels as well as electrochemical energy band gap (Eelg) can be calculated according to the following equations:
HOMO (eV) = −e(Eonsetox + 4.7 V)
LUMO (eV) = −e(Eonsetred + 4.7 V)
Eelg = −(HOMO − LUMO) (eV)
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the electrochemical band gap of TPA-BT-C8 are −5.38, −3.57 and 1.81 eV, and as to TPA-3Th, they are −5.35, −3.50 and 1.85 eV. It can be found that the two molecules have a deep HOMO energy level, far below the air oxidation threshold (ca. −5.2 eV), which ensures a good air stability of the molecules and allows a high Voc of the photovoltaic device based on TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th. Both TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th have a TPA group which mainly determines their HOMO energy level, so they have nearly equal HOMO energy level. In addition, since the electron-donor ability of the trithiophene group in TPA-3Th is stronger than that of the single thiophene group in TPA-BT-C8, and they have some contribution to the HOMO energy level, the HOMO energy level of TPA-3Th is somewhat higher than that of TPA-BT-C8. The electron-acceptor ability of benzothiadiazole and DCM groups in TPA-BT-C8 is a little stronger than that of cyano-n-octyl acetate in TPA-3Th, resulting in that TPA-BT-C8 has a somewhat lower LUMO energy level than TPA-3Th.

The ground-state geometry and electron-state-density distribution of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th have been fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) based on the B3LYP method with a 6-31G* basis in the Gaussian 03 program package. The HOMO and LUMO pictograms and corresponding energy levels for TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th are presented in Fig. 4. The calculation results demonstrate that the HOMO energy level of TPA-BT-C8 distributes mainly on the triphenylamine core with some extending to the symmetrical two arms, and the LUMO energy level distributes on the acceptor groups, DCM and benzothiadiazole groups. However, as to TPA-3Th, the HOMO energy level distributes on the triphenylamine core and the six thiophene groups, and the LUMO energy level distributes only on the cyano-n-octyl acetate group. The DFT calculation indicated that ICT absorption can take place in both TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, but the intensity of TPA-BT-C8 should be stronger than that of TPA-3Th, which accords with their optical properties. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energy levels and the band gap of TPA-BT-C8 are −5.06, −2.73 and 2.33 eV, and as to TPA-3Th, they are −4.99, −2.31 and 2.68 eV, respectively. In general, the theoretical HOMO energy levels of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th are consistent with those obtained from electrochemical measurement, and the trend of theoretical band gaps agrees with that of optical band gaps. The differences between the theoretical and electrochemical and optical values are a well-known consequence of performing calculations that lack medium-related factors.


Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells with a device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TPA-BT-C8 or TPA-3Th:PCBM/LiF/Al were fabricated and their performances were measured under a simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices are illustrated in Fig. 5. The optimized conditions and photovoltaic parameters for the devices are summarized in Table 2. Both of the two devices achieve the best performance at a weight blend ratio of 1:2.5. The device based on TPA-BT-C8 shows an optimal performance with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 8.47 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.30 and a PCE of 2.26%. The device based on TPA-3Th exhibits its best performance with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 4.32 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.34 and a PCE of 1.21%. The much higher PCE of the TPA-BT-C8 based device than that of the TPA-3Th based device is resulted from the higher Jsc, 8.47 vs. 4.32 mA cm−2, and this is mainly attributed to the much wider solar light absorption of TPA-BT-C8 than TPA-3Th (see Fig. 2). The somewhat higher Voc of the device based on TPA-BT-C8 (0.91 V) than that of the device based on TPA-3Th (0.86 V) is consistent with their HOMO energy levels obtained from electrochemical measurement and DFT theoretical calculation, which is −5.38 eV vs. −5.35 eV by electrochemical measurement and −5.06 eV vs. −4.99 eV by DFT theoretical calculation (vide ut supra), since Voc of the bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells is mainly determined by the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.

The charge carrier mobility of materials is another important factor which influences the performance of OSCs. Accordingly, we investigated the hole mobility of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Devices with a structure of ITO/TPA-BT-C8 or TPA-3Th/LiF/Al were fabricated and their J–V curves in the dark are shown in Fig. 6. The hole mobility of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th was estimated according to the following equation:
where
V is the applied voltage, and J is the current density. εr and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant (here we fit it to be 3.) and the permittivity of the vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), respectively. μh is the hole mobility and L is the thickness of the organic layer. Vbi is fitted to be about 0.1 V, which is determined by the difference between the work functions of the cathode and anode. Then the hole mobility of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th is estimated to be 7.1 × 10−5 and 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Both of the two small molecules have a relatively high hole mobility, which is favorable for performance of the photovoltaic cell. On the other hand, the hole mobility of TPA-3Th is higher than that of TPA-BT-C8, but the performance of the photovoltaic cell based on TPA-BT-C8 is better than that of the photovoltaic cell based on TPA-3T. We believe this is because the hole mobility of the donor materials is not the dominant factor influencing the performance of these two devices. Just as we analyzed above, the much wider solar light absorption of TPA-BT-C8 than TPA-3Th is an important factor that cannot be ignored.

To further investigate the reason why the photovoltaic performance of the device based on TPA-BT-C8 is much better than that of the device based on TPA-3Th, the morphology of their active layers was investigated by AFM. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, many large aggregates with several hundreds of nanometers can be found in the TPA-3Th:PCBM blend film, while the surface of the TPA-BT-C8:PCBM blend film appears to be much smooth. In addition, the root mean square (rms) roughness of the TPA-BT-C8:PCBM blend film is much lower than that of the TPA-3Th:PCBM blend film, which is 0.96 and 4.61, respectively. Therefore, TPA-BT-C8 has a better compatibility and film-formation property with PCBM than TPA-3Th, and this partially leads to that the photovoltaic device based on TPA-BT-C8 has a higher Jsc and PCE than the device based on TPA-3Th.

Fig. 8 shows the IPCE curves of photovoltaic devices based on TPA-BT-C8:PCBM (w:w, 1:2.5) and TPA-3Th:PCBM (w:w, 1:2.5). It was found that IPCE spectra of the devices are basically consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th. The device based on TPA-BT-C8:PCBM has a wider response range than the device based on TPA-3Th:PCBM. More importantly, the response range of the TPA-3Th:PCBM based device is mainly between 350 and 530 nm, while that of the TPA-BT-C8:PCBM based device is extended from 350 to 630 nm which is more close to the maximum photon flux of the solar irradiation at ∼700 nm, and so the TPA-BT-C8:PCBM based device has a stronger ability of absorbing photons than the TPA-3Th:PCBM based device. Consequently, it is reasonable that the device based on TPA-BT-C8 has a higher Jsc and PCE than the device based on TPA-3Th.

In summary, two solution-processable two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules, TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, were synthesized successfully by Knoevenagel condensation reaction. For TPA-BT-C8, two arms of the TPA core are symmetrically connected with a thiophene donor group and a benzothiadiazole acceptor group, which brings about ICT and it ensures TPA-BT-C8 has a red-shifted and wider absorption than TPA-3Th whose two arms of the TPA core are composed of only a donor group, terthiophene. Both of the two molecules have a deep HOMO energy level, which ensures that the two molecules have a good air stability and the photovoltaic devices based on TPA-BT-C8 or TPA-3Th have a high Voc of about 0.9 V. The device based on TPA-BT-C8 has a higher Jsc (8.47 mA cm−2) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) (2.26%) than the device based on TPA-3Th (4.32 mA cm−2, 1.21%), resulting from the wider solar light absorption of TPA-BT-C8 and good compatibility and film-formation ability of TPA-BT-C8 with PCBM than TPA-3Th. The IPCE spectra also confirmed that the device based on TPA-BT-C8 has a wider and red-shifted response range than the device based on TPA-3Th. The investigations indicate that the two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules are a type of promising organic photovoltaic materials, and offer a new strategy for designing organic small molecular solar cell materials.
