Four benzodithiophene-triazoloquinoxaline alternating polymers, PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12, have been designed and synthesized to investigate the correlation of alkyl side chains with the opto-electronic properties of the resulting polymers. The introduction of side chains onto the thiophene spacer or quinoxaline unit lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of the polymers, while excessive chains prevent the polymer backbone from π–π stacking and result in a decreased short circuit current and fill factor in a photovoltaic application. The bulk heterojunction cells fabricated by blending PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1 with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester exhibit a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.40%, with a short-circuit current density of 4.12 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.62 V and a fill factor of 55%. The device was further optimized to 2.24% PCE by using PFN (5 nm)/Ca (5 nm) as a co-interfacial layer.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) recently have attracted intense attention due to the easy tunability of their chemical properties and the potential for the mass-production of flexible devices with cost-effective approaches. The most successful PSCs generally adopt a so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, where the photoactive layer is a blend of a light-harvesting conjugated polymer (donor) and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative (acceptor). The most common acceptor materials include (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). In the active layer, sunlight is absorbed to generate excitons that migrate to and dissociate at the donor–acceptor interface, into holes and electrons. A current is generated when separated charges travel to the respective electrodes. In the last decade, the collective efforts of both device physicists and material chemists have pushed the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of PSCs over 8%, with a record 10.6% reported recently. However, PSCs are still not ready for commercial applications, mainly due to their low PCE for large area devices.

The development of low bandgap conjugated polymers with suitable energy levels, good oxidative stability and a high charge carrier mobility is the mainstream of material research for high-performance PSCs. Meanwhile, the polymers should have an excellent solubility tailoring, for solution processing. The dominant design strategy for low bandgap polymers is to alternate electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) units along the conjugated backbone (so-called D–A copolymers). Among them, many D–A copolymer donor materials have been developed and promising photovoltaic performance PCEs over 6% have been achieved for polymers based on D or A units like benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, thiophene-phenylene-thiophene, benzothiadiazole, di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, dialkoxyl-phenyl-quinoxaline, and diketopyrrolopyrrole. Besides bandgap control, the regulation of the molecular energy levels (the highest occupied molecular orbital – HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital – LUMO) of the conjugated polymers is very important for photovoltaic material design.
Triazoloquinoxaline (TzQx) based polymers have been recently attracting attention as active materials in organic electrochromics (OEC) with the structural modification of the triazole and quinoxaline moieties. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the triazoloquinoxaline, it is proposed as a promising A unit for the development of D–A alternating low bandgap polymers for PSCs. There were few literature reports on triazoloquinoxaline-based polymers focusing on their photovoltaic properties when we launched this project. Compared to triazoloquinoxaline, di-2-thienyl-triazoloquinoxaline (BTzQx) can relieve the steric hindrance between the donor and triazoloquinoxaline, thereby increasing the hole mobility.
Alkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTO) and 2-alkylthiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) have been demonstrated to be some of the most excellent building blocks for efficient photovoltaic materials. The BDTs possess symmetric and rigid planar structures with an extended π-conjugation. They facilitate π-electron delocalization in polymer chains and improve the π–π interactions between the polymer chains in the solid state. Therefore, BDT-based polymers usually demonstrate broad absorption properties, high charge carrier mobility and a deep HOMO energy position, compared with other D unit based polymers.
In this study, four benzodithiophene (BDT) and triazoloquinoxaline alternating polymers with an identical conjugated backbone, but different chains at the thiophene (spacer) or triazoloquinoxaline (acceptor) moiety have been designed and synthesized to conduct a structure–property correlation study of the polymers. This is the first report discussing the copolymers based on BDT and triazoloquinoxaline units. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the as-prepared polymers were studied in detail. The best BHJ device, from blending PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1 with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.40%, with a short-circuit current density of 4.12 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.62 V and a fill factor of 55%.

The synthetic route for the BDT monomers is outlined in Scheme 1. Starting from thiophene-3-carboxylic acid, the synthesis of N,N-diethylthiophene-3-carboxamide (2) was achieved via a two-step procedure, i.e., chloroformylation and amination. The lithiation of 2 afforded 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione 3 with a yield of 83%. After reduction of 3 with zinc, further alkylation was performed to afford 4 with a yield of 78% by using a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium bromide. The stannylated BDT monomer 5 was prepared from 4 with a yield of 78%. The thiophene substituted BDT derivative 7 was prepared from 3 and alkylated thiophene 6via a two-step protocol,i.e., lithiation and reduction with SnCl2. The tin reagent 8 was prepared from 7 and trimethyltin chloride in an 82% yield.

The triazoloquinoxaline monomers were synthesized according to the procedure in Scheme 2. Starting from 1,2,3-benzotriazole, 4,7-dibromo-2-dodecyl-5,6-dinitro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole 11 was prepared via a three-step procedure, i.e., alkylation, bromination and nitration. A Stille coupling between 11 and 2-(tributylstannyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene 13 or tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane 14 (ref. 46) afforded the thienyl bridged triazoles 15 and 16. After further reduction, condensation with diketones and bromination, the targeted brominated BTzQx monomers 24, 25 and 26 were obtained in good yields. In this study, BTzQx derivatives with 2-ethylhexyl and dodecyloxy chains were introduced onto the thiophene spacer or the TzQx accepting unit, depending on the positions. Among them, monomer 24 had 2-ethylhexyl chains in the thiophene spacers and methoxy groups in the TzQx unit, while 26 only had dodecyloxy chains in the TzQx unit. Monomer 25 was synthesized with both the solubilising ethylhexyl group in the thiophene spacers and the accepting dodecyloxy chains in the TzQx unit.
The targeted BDT-BTzQx alternating polymers PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12 were prepared via a Pd(0)-mediated Stille coupling reaction between the bis(trimethylstannyl)-substituted BDT monomers (5 or 8) and the brominated BTzQx monomers (24, 25, or 26) with yields ranging from 59–96% (Scheme 3). The crude polymers were Soxhlet-extracted with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform in sequence. The title polymers were obtained by reprecipitation of their concentrated chloroform solutions from methanol. The structures of the obtained copolymers were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The four copolymers possess excellent solubility in common organic solvents, including tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, o-dichlorobenzene and toluene, etc., which is attributed to the incorporation of the solubilising alkyl or alkoxyl side chains along the polymer backbone.
The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent. The GPC results indicated that these copolymers have the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 7–24 kDa with a narrow PDI of 1.29–2.17 (Table 1). PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1 showed a low Mn, probably due to the steric hindrance resulting from the incorporation of a thiophene side chain in the BDT unit. Additionally, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12, and PBDT-BTzQx-C12 harvested much improved Mn values, with side chains in the thiophene spacer or the TzQx acceptor. In particular, PBDT-BTzQx-C12 showed the highest Mn, up to 52 kDa, probably due to less steric hindrance in the polymer main chain. This finding is in good agreement with previous reports. You et al. reported that attaching alkyl chains on the 4-positions of these thienyl groups only introduces a minimal steric hindrance into the related D–A polymer. However, the simultaneous introduction of alkyl and alkoxyl chains in the thiophene spacer and TzQx acceptor is not effective to improve the Mn of polymers. Too densely incorporated alkyl side-chains may increase the steric hindrance and the π–π stacking distance of the polymer backbones.

The thermal stability of the polymers was characterized with TGA (Fig. 1). The decomposition temperatures (Td) (5% weight loss) were 403, 394, 348 and 416 °C for PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12, and PBDT-BTzQx-C12, respectively. Good thermal stability of the photovoltaic polymer is necessary for device fabrication and applications. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments, however, did not show any glass transition and crystallization behaviour within the temperature range (0–280 °C), indicating the amorphous nature of these polymers.

BTzQx oligomers (TaQ) without an alkyl chain on the thiophene spacer were recently reported by Grimsdale. In order to reveal the impact of the alkyl chain on the optical properties of BTzQx, UV-vis spectra of BTzQx oligomers 21–23 were recorded in CHCl3 solutions (results shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2). The spectra of 21–23 feature a broad UV absorption with one maximum peak (λmax) and a shoulder peak. As shown in Fig. 2, a broad UV spectrum ranging from 400 to 650 nm with λmax at 564, 564 and 549 nm was observed for 21, 22 and 23, respectively. Compared with TaQs, the new BTzQx oligomers 21–23 exhibit red-shifted and intensified absorptions in the range 500–650 nm. Oligomers 21 and 22 exhibited the same λmax at 564 nm, which showed that the alkoxyl chain length on the TzQx acceptor contributed a negligible effect to the λmax of the oligomers. Oligomer 23 had a λmax at 549 nm, which was 15 nm blue-shifted in comparison to that of 21 and 22. This indicates the alkyl chain linked to thiophene could increase the absorption of the oligomer. The optical bandgap (Eg) of these oligomers was determined from the UV-vis absorption onset in a CHCl3 solution, according to the empirical equation: Eg = 1240/λonset eV. The Eg of the oligomers 21, 22 and 23 was determined to be 1.89, 1.89, and 1.94 eV, respectively.

The UV-vis spectra of all the copolymers in both CHCl3 solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 3. All the polymer films exhibit a broad absorption band in the range 350–850 nm, which is 50–100 nm red-shifted in comparison to their absorption spectra in solution. PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1 film shows a λmax at 697 nm, which is 28 nm red-shifted compared to its solution. PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 film exhibits a λmax at 704 nm, 33 nm red-shifted compared to its solution. And PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 film has a λmax at 694 nm, 29 nm red-shifted compared to its solution. By introducing more alkoxy chains, the electron-withdrawing characteristics of the acceptor were weakened and thus the bandgap of PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 was increased in comparison to PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1. Comparing the UV-vis spectra of PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 and PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 from the solution to the film, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 exhibits more red-shifted absorption for the thin film. Due to the larger red-shift in absorption observed for PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 (33 nm) than PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 (29 nm) when transferring from solution to solid film, it is reasonable that the π–π stacking of PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 is stronger than that of PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12. This phenomenon indicates the film aggregation is much hindered for PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 due to the introduced dodecyloxy chains. The absorption results for our prepared polymers are consistent with those of other groups' studies, i.e., a blue-shifted absorption can be obtained with the introduction of side-chains to the thiophene spacer. The PBDT-BTzQx-C12 film showed a λmax at 781 nm, 64 nm red-shifted compared to its solution. The red-shifted absorption of the polymer films indicates that a strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation exist in the solid-state of these polymers, which is probably related to the increased extent of the π–π stacking of the backbones and an increased polarizability of the solid-state.
Compared with the absorption spectra of the similarly-structured TzQx polymers, a much broader absorption is observed for the BDT-based polymers in this study. For instance, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 exhibits an ∼90 nm wider absorption band than the fluorene-based PFDTBTzQ-2OC1, while PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 exhibits a stronger absorption in 500–800 nm compared to the thiophenyl-methylene-9H-fluorene based PFTDTBTzQ. This demonstrates that the BDT unit has a stronger electron-donating ability compared to the fluorene, hence it is widely used as a donor unit when constructing low bandgap polymers for high-efficiency PSCs.
The as-prepared polymers exhibited two evident absorption bands, the first absorption band at the shorter wavelength is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated main chain and the second band at the longer wavelength was due to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the benzodithiophene donating unit and the triazoloquinoxaline accepting unit. The most red-shifted λmax of PBDT-BTzQx-C12 can be explained with its longer conjugation length of PBDT-BTzQx-C12, due to its larger Mn and a more stable chain conformation. The Eoptg of PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12 were determined with absorption onset to be 1.48, 1.44, 1.49, and 1.38 eV, respectively. From the Eg data of our polymers, one could conclude that the electron-withdrawing ability of the polymers is dependent upon the conjugation length. Compared with earlier reported TzQx polymers, the BDT-TzQx alternating polymers presented a narrower bandgap than fluorene-based PFDTBTzQ-2OC1 (1.63 eV),PFTDTBTzQ (1.66 eV) and P5 (1.52 eV), indicating the stronger electron-donating capability of the BDT than the fluorene unit, due to its fused ring structure.

To reveal the effect of the side-chains on the energy levels, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to determine the energy levels of both oligomers 21–23 and the as-prepared polymers. Fig. 4 shows the oxidation traces of 21–23 and the polymer films on a Pt electrode in a 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution. The potential of ferrocene 0.40 V vs. SCE is used as an internal standard. On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc/Fc+, the HOMO level of 21–23 and the polymers are calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eonsetox). The LUMO levels of the polymers are calculated from the HOMO levels and optical Eg according to the following equations:
HOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.4) (eV)
LUMO = HOMO − Eoptg (eV)
From the CV measurement, both clear oxidation peaks and reduction peaks were observed for the TzQx based oligomers 21–23. Their HOMO levels were determined to be −5.19, −5.28, and −5.33 eV for 21, 22 and 23, respectively. Their LUMO energy level was determined with onset reduction potentials (Eonsetred) according to the equation: LUMO = −(Eonsetred + 4.4) (eV). The LUMO levels were thus calculated to be −3.44, −3.74 and −3.73 eV for 21, 22 and 23, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap (Eg) of 21, 22 and 23 were thus calculated to be 1.75, 1.54 and 1.60 eV, respectively. The Eonsetox was observed to be 0.86, 0.62, 0.90, and 0.71 eV for PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12, respectively. Accordingly, the HOMO energy level of PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12 were calculated to be −5.26, −5.02, −5.30 and −5.11 eV, respectively (Table 2). For polymers with similar TzQx accepting unit, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 exhibited a HOMO level of 0.38 eV higher than PFDTBTzQ-2OC1 (−5.40 eV) and 0.20 eV higher than P5 (−5.22 eV), while PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 showed slightly higher HOMO level than PFTDTBTzQ (−5.32 eV). The LUMO energy level was thus estimated to be −3.78, −3.56, −3.81 and −3.73 eV for PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12, respectively. Deep HOMO energy levels of copolymers were desired for achieving a higher Voc in the BHJ PSCs and made these copolymers promising candidates for use as polymer donor materials. It should be noted that a HOMO level of −5.02 eV as observed for PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 may make it unstable in air.
The HOMO–LUMO energy diagrams of the polymers and PC61BM are shown in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the LUMO energy levels of the four polymers are strongly dependent upon the accepting unit. In comparison to PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1 exhibits a 0.24 eV lower LUMO level, mainly due to the donor unit BDTT of PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1 having a longer conjugation length compared to BDT. This is consistent with the reported findings in other groups, where the HOMO level is primarily governed by the donor unit in the polymer backbone. The HOMO level of PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 was 0.19 eV lower than that of PBDT-BTzQx-C12. PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12, with 2-ethylhexyl chains, has greater delocalized π-electrons. The HOMO energy level of PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 decreased because of the increased number of the delocalized π-electrons of the alkyl chain. This result agrees well with that reported by You et al. that the spacers with long and branched side chains are beneficial to the Voc of PSCs. The introduction of side-chains to the spacer or acceptor lowered the energy of the HOMO level, but excessive chains prevented the main backbone from π–π stacking, which decreased the short circuit current of the photovoltaic properties. The positioning of the alkyl or alkoxyl side chains on the polymer backbone relative to the TzQx unit can thus be a powerful tool in controlling the electronic properties of polymers.

The photovoltaic properties of the four copolymers in BHJ cells were evaluated by blending polymers with PC61BM acceptor as an active layer. The additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), with a certain volume ratio, was added prior to the spin-coating process. The thickness of the active layers was controlled with the spin-speed during the spin-coating process. The photoactive layers were prepared by the spin-coating of the polymer:PC61BM blend solution in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) on ITO/PEDOT:PSS patterned substrates (40 nm). The thickness of all the blends was around 80 nm. The active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2. All the devices were prepared under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and characterized in air without encapsulation, where the J–V measurements were performed under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic properties of the fabricated PSCs with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/PFN/Al are summarized in Table 3.

The cathode interfacial layer, poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN), was used between the active layer and anode Al layer. PFN was found to increase the Voc of the BHJ cells for earlier reported TzQx polymers. Different PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1/PC61BM weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3) were investigated to optimize the photovoltaic properties. The polymer/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best device performance. At a 1:2 weight ratio of polymer/PC61BM, the device with PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1/PC61BM as the active layer gave a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 1.73 mA cm−2, a FF of 43.3%, and resulted in a PCE of 0.57% (Fig. 6).
Different PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 or PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12/PC61BM weight ratios, such as 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 were investigated to optimize the photovoltaic properties. The polymer/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best device performance. The devices were further explored with thermal annealing at 60, 90 or 120 °C for the active layer. However, the thermal annealing had a negative effect on the device performance by significantly decreasing the Jsc. In order to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of the devices, 3% (v/v) DIO was used as an additive in the solutions of the the active layer materials. We found that for the devices based on PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1 or PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12, by using DIO as an additive, both the Jsc and FF of the devices also decreased intensively. At a 1:2 weight ratio of polymer/PC61BM, the device with PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1/PC61BM as the active layer, without thermal annealing, gave a Voc of 0.62 V, a Jsc of 4.12 mA cm−2, a FF of 55%, and resulted in the highest PCE of 1.40%. Also, the PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C12/PC61BM (1:2) device only delivered a PCE of 0.28%, with a Voc of 0.68 V, a Jsc of 0.79 mA cm−2, and a FF of 52%. The device characterization for PBDT-BTzQx-C12 is underway and will be reported in due course.
For the best performing device of PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C12/PC61BM (1:2), further optimization was explored using PFN (5 nm)/Ca (5 nm) as a co-interfacial layer. A further improvement in both the Voc and Jsc was observed for the resulting device. An optimized PCE of 2.24% was achieved with a Voc of 0.68 V, a Jsc of 5.69 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%. Compared with the PFTDTBTzQ device (0.57% PCE),PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C12/PC61BM (1:2) delivered almost a three-fold higher PCE, which may be attributed to the wider and intensified absorption of the active layer.
The device optimization with both thermal annealing and the addition of a processing additive was not successful, which may be explained by the amorphous nature of the polymers, since the increased tanglement of the polymer chains under these conditions may prevent the polymer backbones from π–π stacking. The poor π–π stacking of polymer main chains will in turn decrease the hole transport properties of the polymers, reflected by the low Jsc in the PSCs. The charge transport properties of the polymers were further characterized with field-effect transistor (FET) devices. A polymer layer was spin-coated onto a highly n-doped Si substrate (gate electrode) with 200 nm of thermally grown SiO2 (insulating layer) in a top contact configuration. Gold electrodes (∼100 nm) were deposited on a SiO2 layer through a shadow mask to offer FET devices with a channel length of 200 mm and channel width of 6 mm. The hole mobility of the un-annealed PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C1, PBDT-BTzQx-EH-C12 and PBDT-BTzQx-C12 device was calculated to be 2.1 × 10−2, 8.5 × 10−2, 1.4 × 10−2, and 9.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s −1, respectively. These hole mobilities of the BDT polymers are one-magnitude higher than that of PFDTBTzQ-2OC1, indicating the advantage of a coplanar fused BDT unit over fluorene. The highest mobility observed for PBDT-BTzQx-C12 indicated the relief of steric hindrance with unsubstituted thiophene in the BTzQx unit.
Comparing the performance of the three studied polymers, it can be concluded that the simultaneous introduction of alkyl chains to the thiophene spacer and TzQx acceptor is good for lowering the HOMO energy level, but harmful for π–π stacking of the polymer backbone. The decreased stacking of the polymer main chains resulted in lower Jsc and FF values for the cell performance.

Four benzodithiophene and triazoloquinoxaline alternating polymers have been successfully developed with a bandgap ranging from 1.38 eV to 1.44 eV. By the introduction of long alkyl chains at the thiophene spacer or triazoloquinoxaline acceptor unit, the absorption and HOMO energy level of the resulting polymers can be tuned. Excessive alkyl chains may prevent the main backbone from π–π stacking, which decreases the short circuit current and fill factor of BHJ cells. The PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C1/PC61BM (1:2, w/w) PFN//Al cell delivered a power conversion efficiency of 1.40%. By using PFN/Ca as a co-interfacial layer, the optimized device harvested an improved PCE of 2.24%. Thermal annealing and processing additives cannot improve the photovoltaic performance of these amorphous polymers. Our results indicate that triazoloquinoxaline-benzodithiophene alternating polymers may become the choice D–A polymers for high-efficient PSCs, after careful structure design.

The 130 nm-thick ITO sheet has a resistance of 15 Ω per square. The substrates were ultrasonicated sequentially in deionized water, acetone, deionized water and isopropanol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were treated by oxygen plasma cleaning for 4 min. Firstly, a thin film (40 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS, H.C. Starck) was spin-coated and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min. Secondly, polymer:PC61BM (at different weight ratio) film with a nominal thickness of ∼80 nm was spin-coated as the active layer on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer from its o-DCB solution (10 mg mL−1). Thirdly, a 5 nm interlayer material PFN was spin-coated on the top of the active layer from its methanol solution in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid. Finally, the Al layer was subsequently evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (∼2 × 8 mm2) and form a top anode to complete the photovoltaic device fabrication. For the device with PFN/Ca as the co-interfacial layer, a Ca layer (5 nm) was deposited on top of the active layer under a high vacuum before the deposition of Al. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and PCE of the cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under a 1 sun, AM 1.5 G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192, 100 mW cm−2) at room temperature in a nitrogen filled glove-box. The solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with a KG-5 visible colour filter), which was calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
