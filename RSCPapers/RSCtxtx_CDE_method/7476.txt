Herein, a liquid crystal material, BTR, was elaborately selected as the third component to complement PTB7-Th for the fabrication of highly efficient ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs). Via incorporating 10 wt% BTR in their donors, the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs increased from 10.08% to 10.83%, resulting from the enhanced short circuit current (JSC) of 19.23 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 72.21%. The small amount of incorporated BTR may prefer to distribute in the PTB7-Th networks and has good miscibility with PC71BM. The excitons on BTR may dissociate into free charge carriers at the BTR/PC71BM interfaces and also transfer their energy to PTB7-Th through Förster resonance energy transfer, resulting in improved exciton utilization. Moreover, the molecular arrangement and morphology of the active layers could be optimized by incorporating appropriate amount of BTR as a nucleating agent, also leading to enhanced stability of the ternary PSCs. The positive effects of BTR on the performance improvement of PSCs were confirmed from the inverted and conventional structures of the cells.

Impressive progress in polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved via the synthesis of novel materials and device engineering. Organic materials have an intrinsically narrow absorption range, which limits photon harvesting from solar light. A detailed investigation on the donor absorption window indicates that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs may exhibit approximately 35% improvement if the width of the absorption window can be increased from 200 nm to 400 nm. Extended absorption spectra of the active layers can be easily realized in tandem PSCs with different bandgap materials as donors in the sub-cells. It is a technical challenge to optimize the sub-active layers and intermediate layers for the potential commercialization of tandem PSCs. With the advantages of bulk heterojunction PSCs, ternary PSCs have attracted significant attention due to their simple fabrication and adjustable photon harvesting ability and range of their active layers via the incorporation of a third component. Ternary systems usually contain one donor/two acceptors or two donors/one acceptor. The bandgap and energy levels of the third component are critical parameters to enhance photon harvesting and charge carrier transport in the ternary active layers. Moreover, miscibility of the used materials has an essential role in influencing the distribution of the third component in the ternary active layers, leading to various working mechanisms (energy transfer, charge transfer, parallel-linkage mode or alloy-mode) of ternary PSCs. Furthermore, the molecular arrangement and morphology of the ternary active layers will be affected by the incorporation of a third component, which may become more complex due to the multi-length scale phase domains. Therefore, the content of the third component should be finely adjusted to obtain an appropriate phase separation, which strongly depends on the miscibility among the used materials.

In this study, the well-known conjugated polymer poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were used as host materials to prepare binary PSCs. The liquid crystal material benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR) was elaborately selected as the third component to prepare the ternary PSCs. In addition to the complementary absorption spectra and appropriate energy level alignment of the two donors, BTR may have good miscibility with PTB7-Th due to the fact that its backbone structure is similar to that of the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit. The liquid crystal material BTR can act as a nucleating agent to adjust the molecular arrangement of PTB7-Th due to its high crystallinity. Wei and coworkers also reported that the PCE of PSCs increased from 9.20% to 10.5% due to the enhanced crystallinity of PTB7-Th via the incorporation of a highly crystalline small molecule (p-DTS-(FBTTH2)2); this indicates that the incorporation of an appropriate highly crystalline small molecule plays a vital role in PCE improvement. In our study, the champion PCE of the inverted PSCs approached 10.83% due to the incorporation of 10 wt% BTR in the donors, with the enhanced short circuit current (JSC) of 19.23 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 72.21%, and a constant open circuit voltage (VOC). The PCE of the binary and ternary PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based PSCs are among the highest values for the same host system. Typical reports on PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based ternary PSCs are summarized in Table S1. The stability of the ternary PSCs was also enhanced due to the optimized molecular arrangement and phase separation as a result of the incorporation of an appropriate amount of BTR, which was further confirmed from the inverted and conventional structures of the PSCs. The molecular structure of the used materials and schematic of the fabricated device are exhibited in Fig. 1.

The inverted PSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th1−x:BTRx:PC71BM1.5/MoO3/Ag, where the only difference is the BTR content (x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 wt%) in the donors. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of all the PSCs were obtained under AM 1.5G irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, as exhibited in Fig. S1. The J–V curves of the typical PSCs are shown in Fig. 2a. Interestingly, the VOCs of the ternary PSCs were dependent on the VOC of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based cells, indicating that all the photogenerated holes may be transported along the channels formed by PTB7-Th. As is known, the VOC is mainly determined by the energy level offsets between the hole and electron transport channels for the cells with the same interfacial buffer layers and electrodes. Energy level cascades are beneficial for hole transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.34 eV for BTR to that of −5.24 eV for PTB7-Th. Obviously, JSC and FF increased with an increase in the BTR content up to 10 wt% in donors and then decreased with the incorporation of more BTR. The champion PCE of the ternary PSCs approached 10.83% due to the incorporation of 10 wt% BTR in the donors with an increased JSC of 19.23 mA cm−2, improved FF of 72.21%, and constant VOC of 0.78 V. The constant VOC indicates that all the photogenerated holes are transported along the channels formed by PTB7-Th in the ternary active layers. The increased JSC of the ternary PSCs should be mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting, which is confirmed from the corresponding EQE and absorption spectra. As seen from Fig. 2b, the EQE values of the optimized ternary PSCs increased, particularly in the short wavelength range, due to the incorporation of an appropriate amount of BTR in the donors. To verify the measured JSC, the calculated JSC was obtained by integrating the EQE spectra. The calculated JSC was slightly lower than the measured value with less than 8% deviation due to the fact that the cells were not encapsulated during the EQE spectra measurement under air conditions. To further clarify the effect of the BTR content on the EQE spectral shape, the absorption spectra of neat and blend films are shown in Fig. 2c and d. There is apparent complementarity between the absorption spectra of the used materials, indicating that photon harvesting of the ternary blend films could be optimized by adjusting the BTR content. The photon harvesting ability of the ternary blend films can be enhanced for light with the wavelengths less than 600 nm, corresponding to the BTR absorption range. Moreover, the absorption peak of PTB7-Th in the blend films was slightly red-shifted with an increase in the BTR content up to 30 wt% in the donors, which should be attributed to the increased intermolecular interactions via the incorporation of BTR. The increased FF can be well explained according to the varied series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH). The RSs of the ternary PSCs show a decreasing and then increasing trend with an increase in the BTR content in the donors, and the RSHs exhibit the opposite trend. The minimum RS of 3.60 Ω cm2 and maximum RSH of 1087 Ω cm2 were simultaneously obtained for the PSCs with 10 wt% BTR in the donors, which are responsible for the highest FF of the optimized ternary PSCs. The photovoltaic parameters of the typical PSCs with different BTR contents in the donors are summarized in Table 1.

To ulteriorly confirm the effect of BTR incorporation on the PCE improvement of PSCs, conventional PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/PFN/Al were fabricated using the same active layers. The J–V curves of the conventional PSCs were also investigated under the standard light source, as shown in Fig. S2. The key photovoltaic parameters of the conventional PSCs are summarized in Table S2. Similar trends of the key parameters dependence on BTR content in the donors were observed when compared with those of the corresponding inverted PSCs. The champion PCE of the conventional ternary PSCs is about 10.11% for the active layers containing 10 wt% BTR in the donors, which is also larger than 9.49% for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based PSCs. To clarify the working mechanism of the ternary PSCs, the dynamic process between BTR and PTB7-Th was investigated via the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of neat PTB7-Th, BTR, and their blend films.

Fig. 3a exhibits the PL spectra of the neat and blend films without PC71BM. The PTB7-Th PL emission intensity can be monotonously enhanced by incorporating a BTR content of up to 30 wt%, suggesting that energy transfer may be efficient from BTR to PTB7-Th. BTR exhibits a widened PL emission with a peak at 680 nm, which locates in the strong absorption range of PTB7-Th (as shown in Fig. 2c). The apparent spectral overlap between the BTR PL emission and PTB7-Th absorption well supports the efficient Förster resonance energy transfer from BTR to PTB7-Th. The TRPL spectra of the neat and blend films were investigated by monitoring 760 nm light emission corresponding to the PTB7-Th emission peak, as shown in Fig. 3b. The emission lifetime is increased from 0.08 to 0.18 ns with an increase in the BTR content, which further demonstrates the occurrence of Förster resonance energy transfer from BTR to PTB7-Th. In addition to energy transfer, intermolecular charge transfer may occur according to the JSC variation of cells with PTB7-Th, BTR, or PTB7-Th:BTR as the active layers (without PC71BM), as shown in Fig. 3c. The JSCs of the PTB7-Th:BTR-based cells are between those of the cells with PTB7-Th or BTR as the active layers, suggesting negligible exciton dissociation at the PTB7-Th/BTR interfaces. Based on the abovementioned analysis, the dynamic process in the ternary active layers is schematically described in Fig. 3d. The small amount of incorporated BTR prefers to distribute in the PTB7-Th networks. The excitons on PTB7-Th and BTR dissociate at their individual interfaces with PC71BM. The photogenerated holes on BTR prefer to transfer to the HOMO level of PTB7-Th and transport along the PTB7-Th-formed channels in the ternary active layers. Moreover, the excitons on BTR also transfer their energy to PTB7-Th through the Förster resonance process and are then dissociated at the PTB7-Th/PC71BM interfaces. Then, the photogenerated electrons transport along the channels formed by PC71BM in the ternary active layers. The fixed hole and electron transport channels result in the constant VOCs of the ternary PSCs.
The 2D-GIXD patterns of the blend films were obtained to investigate the effect of the BTR content on the molecular arrangement of PTB7-Th, as exhibited in Fig. S3. The out-of-plane line cuts can be abstracted from the 2D-GIXD patterns, as shown in Fig. 4a. The obvious (100) diffraction peak at qz = 0.30 Å−1 and qz = 0.35 Å−1 can be observed from the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and BTR:PC71BM blend films, respectively. The intensity of the (100) diffraction peak of PTB7-Th was slightly enhanced for the ternary blend films with the 10 wt% BTR content in the donors, indicating that a more ordered molecular arrangement of PTB7-Th may be obtained by incorporating an appropriate amount of BTR. The correlation length of the PTB7-Th crystallites can be calculated from the Scherrer equation: L = Kλ/(βcosθ), where L is the correlation length, K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the incident beam wavelength, β is full width at half maximum in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle. The correlation length of the PTB7-Th crystallites increased from 11.23 nm (without BTR) to 15.22 nm (with 10 wt% BTR), indicating that the crystallinity of PTB7-Th was enhanced by incorporating BTR. Small molecules containing a thiophene unit have been used as nucleating agents to improve the conformation of polymer chains and enhance the crystallinity of a polymer. Therefore, BTR which contains thiophene units could be used as nucleating agents to improve the crystallinity of PTB7-Th. The (100) diffraction peak of BTR was not observed in the ternary blend film with 10 wt% BTR in donors, indicating that BTR prefers to act as a nucleating agent dispersed in the PTB7-Th networks. The (100) diffraction peaks of PTB7-Th at qz = 0.30 Å−1 and BTR at qz = 0.35 Å−1 were clearly observed when 30 wt% BTR was incorporated in the donors, indicating that an individual phase of BTR was formed in the ternary blend films. The continuous and large phase of BTR may form some hole traps in the ternary blend films due to the HOMO level offset between BTR and PTB7-Th, resulting in a decreased PCE for the ternary PSCs with a higher BTR content in their donors. Therefore, the phase separation degree can be finely optimized by adjusting the BTR content in the donors.
Appropriate phase separation is a prerequisite for obtaining efficient and stable PSCs. To further investigate the effect of BTR content on phase separation, the morphology of the blend films was characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as exhibited in Fig. 4b. As is well-known, bright and dark regions correspond to the donor-rich and PC71BM-rich domains, respectively, due to the different electron densities. Nanofibril networks of PTB7-Th can be observed in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films. The nanofibril networks become more apparent for the ternary blend films with an increase in the BTR content. The variation in the nanofibril structures can also be confirmed from the corresponding GIXD profiles: the crystal size of PTB7-Th is slightly enhanced by the incorporation of an appropriate amount of BTR. An appropriate phase separation can be achieved when the BTR content increases to 10 wt% in the donors. No featured bulk morphology can be observed from the BTR:PC71BM blend films due to good miscibility between the two small molecules. In the ternary blend films, BTR as a nucleating agent can also adjust the PTB7-Th molecular arrangement and optimize the phase separation in addition to enhancing the photon harvesting of the active layers.

Fig. 5 exhibits the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of the PSCs to gain more insight into the effect of BTR content on the dynamic process in the ternary active layers. The Jph is equal to JL − JD, where JD and JL are the current densities in the dark and under a standard solar simulated light source, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. Obviously, Jph reaches a saturation state when Veff is larger than 2 V, indicating that almost all the photogenerated charge carriers are sufficiently transported and collected by the individual electrode. Under this assumption, the saturation photocurrent density Jsat essentially depends on the maximal exciton generation rate (Gmax) as follows: Jsat = eLGmax, where L is the thickness of the active layers and e is the elementary charge. At Veff = 4 V, the Jsat values of the PSCs are 20.43 mA cm−2 (without BTR), 20.67 mA cm−2 (10 wt% BTR), and 18.54 mA cm−2 (30 wt% BTR). This means that the optimized ternary PSCs with 10 wt% BTR in the donors exhibit the highest Gmax of 1.08 × 1028 m−3 s−1, well supported by the absorption spectra. Moreover, the appropriate phase separation degree of the ternary active layers can be further confirmed from the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit or maximal power output conditions. The Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions are 91.1%, 93.0%, and 88.4% for the PSCs with 0 wt%, 10 wt%, and 30 wt% BTR contents in the donors, respectively. The relatively high Jph/Jsat value of 93.0% indicates the efficient exciton dissociation in the optimized ternary PSCs. The Jph/Jsat values under the maximal power output condition are 75.5%, 80.6%, and 75.0% for the corresponding PSCs, indicating that the optimized ternary PSCs have efficient charge carrier collection. The detailed Jph, Jsat, Gmax, and Jph/Jsat values were calculated, as listed in Table 2.

The J–V curves of the PSCs were obtained under different light illumination intensities to evaluate the photogenerated charge carrier recombination loss, as shown in Fig. S4. Based on the J–V curves, the dependence of JSC and VOC on light intensity (L) is described as JSC and VOCversus log(L) in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. Under short circuit conditions, the photogenerated charge carriers can be efficiently removed from the active layers prior to recombination. This recombination could be assessed by the dependence of the power law JSC on light intensity (JSC ∝ Iα). If bimolecular recombination is weak in the active layers, the JSC linearly depends on light intensity with an α value approaching 1. The α fitting values were 0.946, 0.964, and 0.951 for the PSCs with 0 wt%, 10 wt%, and 30 wt% BTR in the donors, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination loss decreased in the optimized ternary active layers due to the α value closest to unity. Under the open circuit conditions where most of the photogenerated charge carriers are recombined in the active layers, the recombination mechanism can be evaluated by the following formula: VOC ∝ nKT/qln(I), where K is the Boltzmann's constant, q is the elementary charge, and T is temperature. If the n value deviates from unity, trap-induced charge carrier recombination should be involved in the active layers. The n fitting values are 1.01, 1.05, and 1.21 for the corresponding PSCs. The relatively large n of 1.21 indicates that serious trap-induced recombination loss occurs in the active layers with 30 wt% BTR in the donors. The trap-induced recombination loss is negligible for the ternary active layers with 10 wt% BTR in the donors due to its n value closest to unity.
The charge carrier transport in the ternary active layers may be optimized by incorporating BTR to optimize phase separation. In fact, the balance of hole and electron transport plays a vital role in determining the PSC performance. The charge mobility can be evaluated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layers (120 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) and ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/active layers (120 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. The J–V curves of the devices with different BTR contents in the donors are plotted as ln(Jd3/V2) versus (V/d)0.5, as shown in Fig. 7. The hole mobility and electron mobility were calculated from the Mott–Gurney equation as follows:
where
ε0 is the dielectric constant of free space, εr is the material dielectric constant, μ is the charge carrier mobility, d is the thickness of the active layers, and V is the applied voltage. The hole mobility (μh), electron mobility (μe), and hole/electron mobility ratios of all the corresponding devices are summarized in Table 3. Both μh and μe exhibit a slightly enhanced trend with an increase in the BTR content. It is apparent that μh increased from 8.93 × 10−4 to 3.48 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the BTR content in the donors increased from 0 wt% to 100 wt%, which should be ascribed to the enhanced molecular crystallinity. Moreover, μe increased from 7.03 × 10−4 (0 wt% BTR) to 2.58 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (100 wt% BTR), due to the optimized phase separation in the active layers. The balance of charge carrier transport evaluated by μh/μe should play a vital role in determining the PSC performance. The μh/μe approached 1.06 for the ternary devices with 10 wt% BTR, which well supported the highest FF, JSC, and PCE for the optimized ternary PSCs.

The morphology of the active layers not only determines the PCE of PSCs, but also influences the device stability. Based on the abovementioned discussions, BTR with an appropriate content acts as a nucleating agent to optimize the morphology of the ternary active layers. The J–V curves of the inverted and conventional PSCs were repeatedly measured for 500 hours in a high-purity nitrogen-filled glovebox. The dependence of the photovoltaic parameters of the inverted and conventional PSCs on storage time is summarized in Table S3 (inverted PSCs) and Table S4 (conventional PSCs). It is apparent that the VOCs of all the PSCs remained almost constant after 500 hours storage. The decay trends of other photovoltaic parameters dependent on the storage time were fitted according to the power function (Y = a(1 + T)b), as shown in Fig. S5, where Y represents the key photovoltaic parameter, T represents the storage time, the coefficient a is the initial value of the corresponding photovoltaic parameter, and the absolute value of index (|b|) reflects the degradation rate. The decay parameters of all the PSCs performances are summarized in Table 4.

The degradation rate of the photovoltaic parameters can be evaluated according to the |b| values. The smaller |b| values of the ternary PSCs indicate that the stability of the PSCs can be improved by employing the ternary strategy. To further clarify the effect of the ternary strategy on the stability improvement, the PCE after 500 hours storage (PCE*) and the preserved percent (PCE*/PCE) are summarized in Table 4. The preserved percent of PCE of the inverted PSCs is 77.0% and 81.8% for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based PSCs and the optimized ternary PSCs, respectively. The preserved percent of PCE of the conventional PSCs is 65.5% and 70.2% for the corresponding cells. Obviously, the stability of the PSCs can be enhanced by employing BTR as a nucleating agent to form a more stable morphology. The more ordered molecular arrangement should be beneficial to improve the stability of the PSCs. The |b| and PCE*/PCE values of the corresponding parameters of the inverted PSCs are better than those of conventional PSCs, which confirms that the inverted PSCs exhibit better stability as compared to the corresponding conventional PSCs.

The liquid crystal material BTR was elaborately selected as a third component to mix with PTB7-Th:PC71BM for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable ternary PSCs. The champion PCE of the ternary PSCs approached 10.83% for the active layers with 10 wt% BTR in the donors, resulting from the simultaneously enhanced JSC and FF and the constant VOC. The enhanced FF is mainly attributed to the optimized molecular arrangement and phase separation due to the incorporation of 10 wt% BTR as a nucleating agent. The enhanced JSC is mainly ascribed to the enhanced photon harvesting and the more balanced charge carrier transport in the optimized ternary active layers. An appropriate amount of BTR plays two functions for the improvement of ternary PSC performances: (i) enhances photon harvesting and exciton utilization and (ii) optimizes molecular arrangement and phase separation. The optimized morphology is beneficial to improve the stability of the PSCs, which was further confirmed from the inverted and conventional structures of the cells. Therefore, the ternary strategy is an efficient and simple method to simultaneously improve the PCE and stability of the PSCs.
