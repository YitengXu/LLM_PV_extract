A novel monomer alkoxybiphenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTBP) was synthesized and used as the donor to construct a donor–acceptor copolymer PBDTBP–DTffBT with 4,7-di(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) as the acceptor unit. Compared with the corresponding polymer PBDTP–DTffBT based on alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT, PBDTBP–DTffBT exhibits a red-shifted UV-vis absorption spectra due to its extended π-conjugation structure. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PBDTBP–DTffBT based polymer solar cells (PSCs) is 6.70% with Voc = 0.85 V, Jsc = 12.72 mA cm−2 and FF = 62.14%, and the hole mobility is 3.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the maximum PCE of PSCs based on PBDTP–DTffBT is only 4.91% and the hole mobility is 1.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These findings demonstrate that BDTBP unit is a promising building block for constructing a copolymer with high hole mobility, and extending the π-conjugation length on the alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT is helpful to improve the photovoltaic properties.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have developed into a research hotspot because of their low cost and flexibility, and great progress have been made in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs in recent years. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single and tandem junction PSCs based on polymer and fullerene derivatives has reached over 10%. The PCE of PSCs is determined by the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), therefore, many strategies have been used to tune the Voc, Jsc and FF for achieving higher PCE. One of the most efficient strategies is to use a D (donor)–A (acceptor) copolymer with an electron-rich unit as the donor and electron-deficient unit as the acceptor. Thus, choosing appropriate donor and acceptor units for D–A copolymers is an efficient route to achieve high PCE of PSCs devices.

In conjugated polymers, electrons are transported along the conjugated backbone via inter-molecular π–π interactions, therefore, enhancing the inter-molecular π–π interaction is an efficient method to improve charge transport properties. Using a two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated structure is an efficient strategy to achieve improved photovoltaic properties by enhancing absorption in visible region and increasing hole mobility, which is widely used in the structure design of the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit. The 2-D BDT is constructed by introducing thiophene (BDTT), benzene (BDTP) or other conjugated units as side groups to the BDT core. The BDTT is the most widely used 2D conjugated structure based on BDT. The photovoltaic performances can be improved by extending the π-conjugation length, thus improving the inter-molecular π–π interaction further. Several extended π-conjugation structures based on BDTT were synthesized by joining a conjugated unit onto the conjugated side chain (for example, introducing bithienyl or phenylthiophene units as the side chains to the BDT core instead of the thiophene group).
An alkylphenyl group instead of an alkylthienyl group attached to the BDT core was first synthesized by Yang’s group in 2012. The polymer based on alkylphenyl-substituted BDT exhibited a deeper HOMO than the alkylthienyl-substituted BDT based polymer with the same acceptor. So a polymer based on extending the conjugated side chains on BDTP may be expected to improve the photovoltaic performances and keep the deep HOMO. It is a pity that there is almost no relevant work to investigate the extended π-conjugation on the BDTP unit. What’s more, the monomer based on extending conjugated side chain on BDTP exhibits more symmetric side chains than does this approach on BDTT due to the structure differences between benzene and thiophene unit. So adjusting the side chain based on BDTP for optimizing the optoelectronic properties of PSCs may be easier than that for BDTT.
Our group synthesized the polymer PBDTP–DTffBT with alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT and 4,7-di((4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT). The maximum PCE of PBDTP–DTffBT was 4.91% with a Voc = 0.84 V, a Jsc = 11.81 mA cm−2 and FF = 49.43%. Inspired by the extended π-conjugation strategy, a new monomer BDTBP was synthesized by introducing an alkoxybiphenyl group instead of an alkoxyphenyl group onto the BDT core (Chart 1). We synthesized a polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT with BDTBP and DTffBT by a Stille coupling reaction with Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as catalysts. The maximum PCE of PBDTBP–DTffBT was 6.70% with Voc = 0.85 V, Jsc = 12.72 mA cm−2 and FF = 62.14% after thermal annealing, and the band gap of PBDTBP–DTffBT was 1.71 eV calculated by the absorption onset. In comparison with PBDTP–DTffBT, the PSCs devices based on the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT exhibited higher PCE and Jsc, which may be attributed to its red-shifted absorption spectrum and higher hole mobility. This work demonstrated that extending the π-conjugation length can work well on BDTP to improve its photovoltaic performance.

The synthetic routes for the new monomer BDTBPSn and polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthetic procedures are given in the experimental section. The biphenyl unit was introduced to the BDT backbone as a conjugated side chain to construct an extended two-dimensional BDT polymer. In the synthesis processes, the chemical structures of the intermediate product and the monomer were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The compound 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione, DTffBT and 5-(bromomethyl)pentadecane were synthesized according to the reported methods, while 4′-bromo biphenyl-4-ol was purchased from J & K company. The polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT was synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction with BDTBPSn and DTffBT in anhydrous toluene using tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) as a catalyst. The polymer exhibited poor solubility and could be slowly dissolved in hot o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTBP–DTffBT determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C was 22 kDa, and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.97. The thermal property of the polymer was recorded by thermogravimetric analysis with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. The onset decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT was 381.6 °C, which was enough for the fabrication of PSCs devices (Fig. S1, ESI).


The normalized optical ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT in a dilute DCB solution and in a thin film are shown in Fig. 1, and detailed absorption data are exhibited in Table 1. The absorption spectra in solution and film showed similar optical properties from 400 nm to 720 nm. In dilute DCB solution, the main absorption peaks were located at 603 nm and 431 nm, which were attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of the donor–acceptor system and localized π–π* transitions, respectively. In addition, the shoulder peak of polymer in solution was located in 647 nm due to aggregations of the polymer chains. The polymer in thin film exhibited red-shifted absorption spectra compared with the spectra in solution, which was the result of solid state packing in the film. In comparison with the polymer PBDTP–DTffBT, the feature absorption peak in dilute solution was red-shifted by about 43 nm from 560 nm to 603 nm, therefore, a larger Jsc could be expected for PSCs based on PBDTBP–DTffBT. The absorption onset (λonset) of the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT was 724 nm, so its optical band gap (Eoptg) 1.71 eV was calculated by the equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of PBDTBP–DTffBT and the CV curve is shown in Fig. 2. The onset oxidation potential (Eox) of the polymer was 1.05 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). As shown in Table 1, its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level was −5.46 eV calculated by the empirical equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)). The empirical equation was based on ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as a reference electrode, and the potential of the Fc/Fc+ was calculated to be 0.39 V vs. SCE. PBDTBP–DTffBT showed a deep HOMO energy level, so a high Voc may be expected when it is blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the polymer was −3.75 eV, which was calculated from the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg.


In order to further research the optoelectronic properties of the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by a Gaussian 09 program in the gas phase. These calculations with a model of B3LYP/6-31G were simplified by some strategies, such as replacing the long alkyl chains with methyl units and choosing one repeating unit as the object of calculation. When calculating vibrational frequencies at the same level, the minimum energy conformation was defined as the optimized molecular geometry. The optimized molecular geometries and energy levels are shown in Fig. 3, and detailed HOMO, LUMO energy levels and bandgap are displayed in Table 1. The LUMO was mainly delocalized in the DTffBT unit, while the HOMO was located both in the donor and acceptor unit. The simulated energy levels from the DFT calculations could coincide well with the experimental data measured by cyclic voltammograms.

As shown in Fig. 4, the dihedral angles of PBDTBP–DTffBT between the side chain and the backbone is 57.67° and the dihedral angle between the two benzene units is 36.47°, which are larger than the dihedral angles of bithophene attached to the BDT. The increased dihedral angles between side chains and backbone may induce the decreased π-orbital overlap between neighboring aromatic units and the DTffBT unit, while the HOMO was located both in the donor unit and the acceptor unit, which may lead to changes in the HOMO energy levels. Moreover, the thiophene unit exhibits stronger electron-donating than does the benzene ring. So the HOMO of the BDTBP based polymer may be lower than that of BDTTT, which is consistent with reported works (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI).

Conventional BHJ polymer solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTBP–DTffBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al under the illumination of AM 1.5G were made to investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBDTBP–DTffBT. The layers of PEDOT:PSS and polymer:PC71BM were spin-coated onto the substrate through the solution processing method. The polymer blended with PC71BM could be slowly dissolved in DCB at 90 °C. As shown in Fig. 5a and Table 2, the optimized D:A weight ratio (selected from 1.5:1, 1:1 and 1:1.5) for the PSCs based on the polymer PBDTPh–DTffBT was 1:1, and the PCE of 6.47% was achieved with Voc = 0.83 V, Jsc = 13.04 mA cm−2 and FF = 59.76%. At the same conditions, the PCE of PBDTP–DTffBT based PSCs was 4.33% with Voc = 0.89 V, Jsc = 9.10 mA cm−2 and FF = 53.44%.

It is well known that thermal annealing may be helpful for nano-scaled phase separation of the polymer and PC71BM blends. The PCE of PSCs based on PBDTBP–DTffBT could be further improved after thermal annealing. The photovoltaic performances of PSCs for different annealing temperatures are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5b. When the device is annealed at 110 °C, the maximum PCE of 6.70% was got with Voc = 0.85 V, Jsc = 12.72 mA cm−2 and FF = 62.14%. While the maximum PCE of PBDTP–DTffBT based PSCs was 4.91% with Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 11.81 mA cm−2 and FF = 49.43%. Thus, introducing biphenyl unit to the BDT backbone could increase the photovoltaic properties by improving Jsc compared with the corresponding polymer. It is a pity that, the photovoltaic performances of PSCs decrease when processing with DIO additives (Fig. S4, ESI).
To further investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymer based devices, the hole mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTBP–DTffBT:PC71BM/Au. The hole mobility is an important factor that influences the Jsc and FF. As shown in Fig. 6, the hole mobility of the PBDTBP–DTffBT based PSCs device was measured to be 3.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the hole mobility for PBDTP–DTffBT was only 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT exhibited higher hole mobility than that of PBDTP–DTffBT, which may be as PBDTBP–DTffBT based PSCs showed a larger Jsc. The carrier recombination rate is an important factor influencing the FF and balanced hole and electron mobility can be useful for preventing carrier recombination, which can be helpful for increasing the FF. The electron mobility (μe) was performed with the structure ITO/ZnO/PBDTBP–DTffBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al by SCLC. The μe of PBDTBP–DTffBT was measured to be 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the hole mobility (μh) was 3.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Hence, the μe/μh was 1.09, and this almost balanced hole and electron mobility could be an important reason for the high FF in the devices.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSC devices based on PBDTBP–DTffBT:PC71BM (1:1) with and without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 7. The polymer exhibited a broad absorption region from 350 to 750 nm which matched well with its absorption spectra. Before and after thermal annealing, the PSCs devices showed almost same EQE curves shape. The EQE value of PBDTBP–DTffBT based PSCs after thermal annealing was higher than that of PSCs without thermal annealing at the absorption peak, which indicated that the PSCs device after thermal annealing exhibited better photoresponse at the absorption peaks. The calculated current density of PSCs from the EQE curves was consistent with the Jsc measured by J–V curves. Compared with the EQE of the corresponding polymer PBDTP–DTffBT, the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT exhibited higher EQE values especially in the UV region. With the increase of conjugated side chains, the absorption intensity was increased accordingly. The maximum EQE value of PBDTBP–DTffBT is about 78% at the UV region, while the corresponding EQE value of PBDTP–DTffBT in the UV region is only 56%. So the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT showed better light-harvesting properties at the UV region.

Thermal annealing plays an important role in morphology control in PSCs devices. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to investigate the influence of thermal annealing on the morphology of the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT:PC71BM blend film. The AFM images and phase images of the blends before and after annealing are shown in Fig. 8. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the blend film without thermal annealing was 3.23 nm, and the surface of the blend film became smooth with the RMS of 2.92 nm after the thermal annealing. Processed with the thermal annealing, the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT exhibited better miscibility with PC71BM in the active layer. The smooth surface of the blend films could ensure better contact with the Ca/Al electrode, which was helpful to increase the photovoltaic performances.

As shown in Fig. 9, the TEM image presented fibrillar structures for the blend films, which may be helpful to form bicontinuous interpenetrating abilities, allowing better exciton dissociation and charge transport, while the counterpart polymer showed large polymer and PC71BM aggregation domains. These differences of TEM images between these two polymers may be another reason for the difference of the FF.

To summarize, we have synthesized a novel extended-conjugation BDT structure (BDTBP) by introducing the biphenyl unit to the BDT core. It was as the electron-rich donor for constructing the D–A copolymer PBDTBP–DTffBT with DTffBT as the acceptor. Compared with the corresponding polymer PBDTP–DTffBT, the polymer PBDTBP–DTffBT exhibited an extended conjugated length, red-shifted absorption spectra and higher hole mobility. As a result, the photovoltaic properties of PBDTBP–DTffBT were improved and the maximum PCE of then PSCs was 6.70%.


All of the starting chemicals were purchased from J & K and other commercial companies and were used without any further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were used for water sensitive reactions after distilled by sodium under an argon atmosphere. The synthetic routes for the new monomer and polymer are shown in Scheme 1 and synthesis details are described below. Compound DTffBT and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione were synthesized according the reported literatures.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance DRX-600 (600 MHZ) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The molecular weight and polydispersity were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with an ELEOS system using trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C. Elemental analysis was measured by a Vario El Cube elementar analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded by a SDT-Q600 analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were obtained using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system. The three-electrode system comprised of a glassy carbon electrode coated with polymer as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and the SCE as the reference electrode. The CV curves of PBDTBP–DTffBT were measured in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under an argon atmosphere. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by a Gaussian 09 program with a model of B3LYP/6-31G in the gas phase. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images were obtained by an Agilent-5400 scanning probe microscope with a Nanodrive controller with resonant frequencies of 300 kHz.


Photovoltaic devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTBP–DTffBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al were spin-coated on ITO coated glass substrates. The glasses (15 mm × 15 mm) coated by ITO were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes with ITO detergent, ultrapure water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially, and then were treated by oxygen plasma for 10 minutes. The ITO-coated substrates were then spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm and were dried at 160 °C for 30 minutes. The following steps were carried out in the glove box. The polymer and PC71BM were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 with the weight ratios of 1.5:1, 1:1 and 1:1.5, respectively. After stirring overnight, the blends of the copolymer and PC71BM were then spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS substrates as the active layer. Finally, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated onto the active layer in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 2 × 10−4 Pa. The PSCs based on PBDTBB–DTffBT were characterized under AM 1.5G illumination with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the current–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon photodiode. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of photovoltaic devices were recorded by the Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
