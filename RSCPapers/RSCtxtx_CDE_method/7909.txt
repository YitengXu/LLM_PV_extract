This review summarizes the current designs and development of new types of organic small molecules as a hole-transporting material (HTM) in a meso-structured perovskite solar cell (PSC). The roles of each layer in the meso-structured perovskite device architecture are elaborated and the employment of new types of organic HTMs in the device is compared with the commercially available HTM spiro-OMeTAD in terms of the properties, device performance and stability. The studies found that nearly half of the new synthesized and pristine HTMs have comparable or better photovoltaic properties than those of doped spiro-OMeTAD. These HTMs have the characteristics of a fused planar core structure with extended π-conjugated lengths and electron-donating functional groups, which are believed to contribute to their high intrinsic conductivity and help make them an alternative to spiro-OMeTAD as a better HTM in meso-structured PSCs. Some of the devices based on the new synthesized HTMs even have longer device lifetimes than their spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC counterparts. Moreover, studies found that the cost per gram (Cg) and cost-per-peak Watt (Cw) of synthesized HTMs can be reduced via minimizing the number of synthesis steps and by optimization of the starting materials in order to yield low-cost HTMs for meso-structured PSC applications.

After he received his PhD, he was appointed as Research Fellow/Senior Lecturer in 2013 at the same university. His recent research activity has focused on the development and scale up of perovskite solar cells, polymer solar cells, and dye-sensitized solar cells, and at the same time he has also developed a nanostructured electrode for solar cells and photocatalysis.

Since the finding that organometal halide perovskite could serve as a light sensitizer in solar cells by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009, the development of solar cell technology has moved to another era with great success in performance that is bringing this photovoltaic technology one step closer to realizing the commercialization of green energy products. Miyasaka and co-workers reported that devices with an active area of 0.24 cm2 made of CH3NH3PbBr3 or CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals as a photodetector and titanium dioxide (TiO2) as an electron-transporting layer (ETL) and electrode in a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) architecture could achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Within several years of further comprehensive studies being carried out, the PCE of devices based on perovskite photosensitizers has been able to break through 20.0%, with the latest achievement reaching 21.1% by Saliba and teams from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).

The rapid development of organometal halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, where X = Cl−, Br−, I−) in these past few years is due to their remarkable opto-electronic properties, such as long charge carrier lifetime (longer than 100 ns) and long diffusion lengths (more than 1 μm), intense photoenergy harvesting, high charge carrier mobility, and small exciton binding energies (about 25–50 meV). These unique properties of organometal halide perovskites make them good candidates as photodetectors in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which absorb sunlight and then take advantage of the photogenerated charge carriers to generate electricity. PSCs have evolved from dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology, where the former device structure consisted of a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold as an electron-transporting layer (ETL), sensitized with active dyes to harvest light into electricity, and a liquid electrolyte containing a redox couple as a hole-transporting material (HTM). However, there is an engineering issue with traditional DSSCs regarding the integrity of the liquid electrolyte, whereby deterioration of the device efficiency over time leads to a subsequent shortening of the device lifespan if there is contamination from the external atmosphere or from electrolyte leaking from microcracks within the sealant. Consequently, researchers are still looking for alternatives and a reliable sealant for DSSCs.
Thus, research into the replacement of active dyes with perovskite nanocrystals and liquid HTMs with a solid-state small molecule, spiro-OMeTAD, or semiconducting polymer, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has been conducted and this has further developed PSC technology to another stage of advancement from the first PSC developed by Miyasaka and co-workers, which achieved a PCE of up to 3.8% without the incorporation of a HTM. Current HTM-free PSCs, both in planar and mesoscopic heterojunction device architectures, display a large improvement on these initial PCEs of from 5.5% (ref. 12) to 12.8%, which has been achieved following advancements in conducting interfacial engineering, the thickness optimization of the ETL and perovskite layers, and by variation of the deposition techniques, etc. The light-to-electricity conversion of HTM-free PSCs can be further improved by capping with the well-established HTM spiro-OMeTAD. Spiro-OMeTAD works effectively on transferring holes to the counter electrode, besides minimizing the series resistance and interfacial recombination losses in PSCs, leading to an enhancement in the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC). Nowadays, PSCs coupled with spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM have achieved a PCE of more than 15%.
However, the costs of producing spiro-OMeTAD has remained expensive due to its lengthy synthesis procedure and low yielding synthesis. Spiro-OMeTAD as an HTM also suffers from several drawbacks, such as low conductivity and low hole mobility, which necessitates the addition of ionic additives, such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), to enhance its conductivity and hole mobility. Sometimes, a co-dopant-based cobalt is used to boost the conductivity through oxidizing the spiro-OMeTAD. The subsequent oxidized spiro-OMeTAD displays superior conductivity and induced photoenergy absorption in the visible and near IR ranges, but unfortunately it also has weaknesses that can cause instability in the perovskite layer owing to its degradation over time, which consequently affects the durability of the PSCs. Moreover, there are limitations in the range of current HTM options that can be employed in PSCs, with only limited options such as spiro-OMeTAD, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA).
Thus, researchers are currently working on alternative HTM materials, with a view to finding HTM materials that are cheaper, simpler, and more easily processable than spiro-OMeTAD. This review summarizes the recent research on new synthesized HTMs for use in a standardized device structure of meso-structured titania-based PSCs. The relationships of the opto-electronic properties of these new synthesized small organic-based HTMs on device performance were also investigated. Correlation studies were also conducted of the opto-electronic properties with device performance to assist building knowledge to aid in the design of low-cost, easily processable, and much better organic HTMs than the current spiro-OMeTAD option.

In this review, the device performances of the meso-structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilizing different types of organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) were studied. The device architecture based on an FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/organic HTM/metal electrode (Au or Ag) cell was selected for comparison of the HTMs. In this n–i–p junction device structure, a thin and compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) is applied as an electron selective contact to facilitate the collection of photogenerated electrons from a metal halide perovskite. The c-TiO2 layer also works as a blocking layer to prevent charge recombination through reducing the contact between the FTO substrate with the HTM or the FTO with the metal halide perovskite, which otherwise tends to cause shunting and a leakage of current in the PSCs. The application of a dense TiO2 layer will subsequently lead the PSCs to have a high open-circuit voltage (VOC). However, the preferred optimized thickness of the c-TiO2 ranges from 20–100 nm (ref. 17 and 18) due to the optical limitation. High temperature annealing is required to yield a compact and dense structure of the TiO2 blocking layer. As a consequence, PSCs with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be achieved by utilizing a high temperature crystalline TiO2 blocking layer, which should be pinhole-free and deposited homogenously.

Although TiO2 has its appropriate energy levels for transporting electrons while at the same time acting as an efficient hole blocking layer, its conductivity is about one-tenth of the conductivity of the well-established HTM spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, a TiO2 mesoporous scaffold (mp-TiO2) is introduced to improve the efficiency of carrier collection. The infiltration of a metal halide perovskite into the mp-TiO2 layer facilitates better contact for a longer exciton lifetime and higher quantum yield for photo-excited charge separation. Recent work from Aldibaja et al. observed that a device with a TiO2 scaffold had a lower recombination rate compared to flat TiO2 samples after the authors tested the devices with different lead precursors to form metal halide perovskites. Careful design of the TiO2 scaffold also managed to reduce the effects of hysteresis, which can severely affect the performance of planar heterojunction PSCs. However, a fine grained morphology of TiO2 scaffold with a high TiO2 surface area resulted in a poor fill factor in the device as the electron-transport pathways were disrupted by the poorly connected TiO2 networks. The presented report also noted that the infiltration of the subsequent HTM into the TiO2 scaffold after deposition of the metal halide perovskite was very low and non-uniform over the device area.
In this device structure, a MAPbI3 perovskite absorber, where MA refers to the methyl ammonium cation (CH3NH3+), was employed as a light harvester to absorb sunlight and consequently photogenerated charge carriers (holes and electrons). It was found that the MAPbI3 perovskite layer had long-range balanced electron- and hole-transport lengths (100–1000 nm) with a high absorption coefficient of 5.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 600 nm (ref. 3 and 4), a direct band gap of 1.51 eV, and a carrier mobility of 67.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The MAPbI3 perovskite also had low exciton binding energy (∼20 meV), which implies that the excitons split at the ETL and HTM interfaces efficiently at room temperature. The characteristic of having a long photo-excited carrier lifetime (∼100 ns) in the MAPbI3 perovskite layer is beneficial for a high photo-conversion efficiency of holes and electrons.
The deposition of the metal halide perovskite can be prepared via a single step or via sequential-steps solution-deposition, where lead iodide (PbI2) is deposited on the substrate first followed by methyl ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) solution through spin-coating techniques. The sequential deposition of the metal halide perovskite offers a better control of the crystallization in the perovskite absorber, which is crucial for achieving a high PCE for the devices. Gao and co-workers explained that sequential deposition allowed a better confinement of PbI2 into the mp-TiO2 layer, which later greatly improved the reproducibility of the device performance. In general, a humidity-controlled environment is required to facilitate crystallization of the perovskite absorber, whereby the morphology of the perovskite film can be optimized through controlling the crystallization process in an inert gas-filled chamber. The presence of a moist atmosphere may degrade the structure of the MAPbI3 perovskite absorber rapidly due to the hygroscopic nature of the methyl ammonium cation, which later affects the stability and efficiency of the PSCs. The present studies also found that a well-defined morphology and highly crystalline perovskite film can be obtained through varying the annealing temperatures, by vapor and solvent engineering, by the insertion of inorganic and organic additives, by utilizing a pressure-mediated crystallization technique,etc.
According to previous literature, the optimum thermal annealing temperature is between 80 °C and 100 °C, and this is helpful in prolonging the carrier lifetime by reducing recombination in the MAPbI3 perovskite layer and by promoting better interdiffusion among the PbI2 precursors, thus yielding a higher VOC for the devices. However, the MAPbI3 perovskite layer starts to decompose upon heating to more than 120 °C, where formation of a PbI2 phase begins from the leached out CH3NH3I cations within the perovskite crystallite region. This later limits the charge injection from and to the mp-TiO2 layer, where a charge sinking phenomenon occurs in the PbI2 phase.
In addition, the adoption of multi-step slow annealing was observed to be better than one-step annealing in preparing a highly uniform and crystalline perovskite film. The drawback of one-step annealing is its inability to produce a perovskite film with good coverage on the substrate due to the presence of irregular sized grains and pinholes, which later minimize the photoenergy harvesting of the perovskite absorber. Meanwhile, the initial step in the multi-step annealing process promotes better a migration and interdiffusion among the solvent-assisted precursor ions to grow large sized grains, followed by subsequent thermal annealing to further improve the crystallinity and morphology quality of the perovskite film. A better surface coverage can be obtained via this method, where shunting and leakage current routes between the mp-TiO2 layer and electrode are suppressed for higher FF and VOC values in PSCs. Besides, the post treatment of perovskite layer with pressurized hot-pressing is also helpful in achieving a smoother film morphology and curing the pinhole defects for better device performance.
The crystallinity of the perovskite film can also be enhanced by using solution and solvent vapor treatments, such as utilizing toluene, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), γ-butylactone (GBL), N′N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Recent work from Jeon and co-workers realized that an extremely uniform and dense perovskite film can be achieved by using a mixture solution of GBL and DMSO, followed by toluene dipping, which yielded an improved device performance with no hysteresis phenomena. As explained in the solvent-assisted crystallization mechanism, the presence of the DMSO solvent retards the rapid formation of MAI cations with PbI2 precursors into the perovskite structure while waiting for evaporation of the GBL initially to form a highly dense structure. Subsequent toluene drips replace the DMSO droplets in the PbI2–MAI–DMSO complex and this thus quenches the perovskite layer into forming a more uniform and highly crystalline morphology. A similar observation was reported by Hao and co-workers when they obtained a high quality and pinhole-free perovskite film by using DMSO and NMP.
The hole-transporting material (HTM) can be introduced on top of the metal halide perovskite after deposition on a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold. This HTM works as a hole-selective contact to extract the photogenerated holes and delivers the carriers to the metal contacts by hindering direct contact between the counter electrode with the electron-transporting layer (ETL). According to Tress et al., utilizing HTM is beneficial for reducing recombination in the device, which consequently contributes to a higher VOC for the PSCs. At the same time, HTM enhances the JSC property by minimizing the losses of charge due to diffusion to the counter electrode through improving the efficiency of the charge carrier collection. This also increased the reflectivity of the counter electrode by facilitating better absorptivity in the perovskite layer as a result of the smoother surface of the HTM layer, which directly increases the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in the PSCs. Meanwhile, the hole collection efficiency by HTM can be further improved with the assistance of ionic additives and p-type dopants. The device fabrication is completed when electrical contacts, such as silver (Ag) or gold (Au) counter electrodes, are deposited on top of the HTM through a thermal evaporation process at a vacuum level of 10−6 torr. The device architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The working mechanism for the meso-structured PSC is simplified in Fig. 1. Charge carrier (holes and electrons) are photogenerated in the lead (Pb)-based perovskite light harvester when the device is irradiated with light. Electrons are separated from the holes and then injected into the TiO2 layer, which functions as an electron-transporting layer (ETL) before the migrating electrons end up at the anode. This is followed by electrons moving to the cathode by passing through the external circuit. Meanwhile, the holes are transferred to the HTM layer, where they usually encounter recombination before successfully migrating to the cathode. Engineering interfaces for the perovskite absorber with ETL and HTM are crucial for achieving high performance PSCs and affect the efficiency of charge carrier extraction and injection in the system. A mismatch of energy level alignment at the interfaces may cause a delay in the collection of photogenerated charge carriers to their respective electrodes, which can contribute to poor device performance. Thus, most researchers are working on designing and modifying new ETLs and HTMs for compatible energy alignment with perovskite photodetectors in order to achieve remarkable device performance, besides improving the morphology and enhancing the crystallinity of the perovskite film.

A great number of organic HTMs comprised of small molecules or conducting polymers have been incorporated in meso-structured PSCs for achieving superior photovoltaic properties. A good HTM should be able to match the energy alignment of its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite photodetector, besides having sufficient hole mobility and high conductivity, which contribute to a high fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) as well as good thermal stability toward photo-degradation. Moreover, the HTMs must have good solubility and good film-forming properties. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly(triarylamine) (PTAA), and spiro-OMeTAD are the most commonly used and commercially available organic HTMs in meso-structured PSC devices. To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as an HTM has exhibited the best performance for meso-structured-based PSCs due to its good solubility in organic solvents, good film-forming properties, and high thermal stability in its amorphous state, such as demonstrated by its high glass transition temperature, Tg, of 125 °C.

Meanwhile, PTAA and P3HT are reported to have better hole mobilities than that of spiro-OMETAD and good filming properties, as reported by Heo et al. The hole mobility achieved by both pristine PTAA and P3HT are in the range of 1 × 10−2 to 4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 52) and about 6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These polymeric HTMs exhibit at least an order of magnitude of hole mobility higher than spiro-OMETAD (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of these HTMs (PTAA = −5.20 eV, P3HT = −5.10 eV, and spiro-OMETAD = −5.12 eV (ref. 52)) are relatively higher than that of the HOMO level of the MAPbI3 perovskite (EHOMO = −5.43 eV), where this favorable energy alignment facilitates a smooth transition for hole transport from the perovskite absorber to the counter electrode and assists in gaining a higher open potential for the devices. Therefore, meso-structured-based PSCs with PTAA as the HTM have demonstrated the highest efficiency, of up to 12.0%, as compared to the devices using P3HT (PCE = 6.7%) and spiro-OMETAD (PCE = 8.4%) as HTMs. It has also been shown that PTAA and spiro-OMETAD, which include a similar triphenylamine terminal as an HTM in meso-structured-based PSCs, have larger JSC and VOC values than the devices employing P3HT as an HTM. Heo and co-workers believed that the interactions between the perovskite absorber with the triphenylamine moieties are far stronger than with the thiophene derivatives. Therefore, triphenylamine moieties are mainly functionalized in synthesized or modified HTM nowadays, in order to achieve interfaces with the perovskite photodetector. The new synthesized organic HTMs will be discussed in the following sections and compared with the most common commercially available HTM, spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp01), in terms of the opto-electronic properties and device performances.

Spiro-OMeTAD, also known as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene, is a well-established and extensively studied organic transparent hole-transporting material (HTM) that has been utilized in establishing a good p-contact between the gold (Au) or silver (Ag) counter electrode with a perovskite absorber in meso-structured-based PSCs. This molecular structure consists of two arylamine moieties formed in a 90° angle, with a spiro center in order to enhance its glass transition temperature (Tg) without sacrificing the charge transport properties. The oxidation potential of spiro-OMeTAD is controlled via the incorporation of methoxy substituents (–OCH3) at its diphenylamine moieties. These methoxy substituents initially function as an electron withdrawing group under an inductive effect, but owing to the resonance stabilization influence, this group in turn displays an electron-donating characteristic. Spiro-OMeTAD works efficiently as an HTM in PSCs but it is expensive in term of processing costs, due to the number of complicated synthesis steps and high purification methods. In addition, it limits the long-term stability of the device, due to the hygroscopic nature of ionic additive, the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine lithium salt (Li-TFSI), which induces degradation of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer when exposed in air.

In meso-structured-based PSCs, spiro-OMeTAD extracts photogenerated carriers from the perovskite photodetector efficiently without increasing the interface recombination or inhibiting the quasi Fermi level splitting within the metal halide perovskite. This is a result of the favorable energy alignment of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of spiro-OMeTAD with the conduction band maximum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the metal halide perovskite and the CBM of the electron-transporting layer (ETL), such as TiO2 or Al2O3. Marinova and co-workers reported that a thickness of about 200 nm spiro-OMeTAD was sufficient to increase the efficiency of light harvesting, where the reflection surface of the HTM and perovskite photodetector interfaces were improved. As for the rough surface of the perovskite absorber, a thickness of more than 400 nm spiro-OMeTAD is required to overcome surface recombination prior to obtaining a high VOC.
Besides, there are some reports that pristine spiro-OMETAD possesses low conductivity (ca. 4.4 × 10−5 S cm−1) as well as low hole mobility (4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which subsequently affects the photocurrent and fill factor of the PSCs. The high transport resistance in spiro-OMeTAD can result in a low fill factor device, as a consequence of the limited diffusion length and recombination time with TiO2. Thus, the weakness of low conductivity spiro-OMeTAD has subsequently been addressed through doping with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), where these ionic additives reduce the charge transport resistance in spiro-OMeTAD by increasing the conductance by more than 100-fold and promote the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD under an oxygen atmosphere. Sometimes, a co-dopant-based cobalt, such as tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) cobalt(III) tris(hexafluorophosphate) (FK102), tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidine]cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide] (MY11), or tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]-cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide] (FK209), is utilized to enhance the photovoltaic properties by inducing more charge carriers within the spiro-OMETAD in PSCs (Fig. 2). The role of the Co-based co-dopant is to promote a high driving force for the spiro-OMeTAD one-electron oxidation reaction.
In the presence of a co-dopant-based cobalt, the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD is enhanced by about two orders of magnitude, due to the higher spiro-to-spiro+ conversion. The driving force for the spiro-OMeTAD one-electron oxidation reaction as a result of doping with the Co-based co-dopant is to shift the Fermi level toward the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) of spiro-OMeTAD from 5.12 eV to a deeper redox potential, i.e., 5.48 eV (FK102), 5.46 eV (FK209), and 5.77 eV (MY11), respectively, which this implies an increase in the hole concentration in PSCs. Due to the lowered Fermi level of spiro-OMeTAD and the reduction of the carrier recombination by the assistance of the Co-complex in the HTM, meso-structured-based PSCs obtained an increment of VOC and a decrease in the series resistance, which both contributed to a better fill factor. The energy levels and Fermi level shifting of the spiro-OMeTAD derivatives upon the addition of ionic additives and co-dopants are represented in Fig. 3.
The efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD as an HTM in PSCs can be further improved by using an iridium-based co-dopant, IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)[TFSI], nowadays. This Ir-complex has a deep redox potential up to 6.31 eV, which is far lower than the Co additive MY11. The Ir additive possesses a similar efficiency to the Co additive, where it decreases the recombination rate. PSCs with Ir-doped spiro-OMeTAD in addition were found to have a better stability than Co-doped spiro-OMeTAD, where the efficiency of the PSCs after 3 months only decreased 4% for Ir-doped spiro-OMeTAD compared to a 70% decrease for Co-doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices.
Other than the insertion of ionic additives into spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp01) to enhance its conductivity, modification of the spiro-OMeTAD molecular structure has also been investigated. Recent work from Jeon and co-workers found that the substitution position of the two para-methoxy (OCH2) moieties in each quadrant of spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 3) have effects on the device performance, where the arrangement of these para-methoxy substituents can be used to control the oxidation potential of the spiro-OMeTAD. The best device with an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.7%, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.02 V, and a fill factor of 77.6% was achieved by using ortho-methoxy-substituted spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp03) (Fig. 3). The obtained PCE was higher than the corresponding commercial and as-synthesized para-methoxy-substituted spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (HTM Sp01, PCE = 15.2%) and (HTM Sp01a, PCE = 14.9%), owing to the low series resistance (RS) and high cell shunt resistance (RSh) obtained by using HTM Sp03 and that contribute to an increased FF value. A device with a low RSh value will cause power losses in solar cells, where this indicates that the amount of current flowing through the cell junction and the voltage from the solar cell is reduced due to the diversion of the light-generated current. Meanwhile, meta-methoxy-substituted spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp02) yielded the lowest PCE, which was about 13.9%, as compared to the other spiro-OMeTAD derivatives (Table 1). The molecular structure of the spiro-OMeTAD derivatives are illustrated in Fig. 4.

In addition, the conductivity of the spiro-OMeTAD can be increased up to 10−3 S cm−1 by using a dicationic salt of spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp04) (Fig. 4). This pre-oxidized HTM, i.e., Sp04, was synthesized through the oxidation of HTM Sp01 with silver bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Ag-TFSI). PSCs with HTM Sp04 are reported to have a similar PCE value but better operating stability when illuminated continuously under an inert atmosphere as compared to the conventional Li-TFSI-doped HTM Sp01. Some of the photovoltaic performances based on spiro-OMeTAD derivatives are listed in Table 1.
Besides the enhancement of the conductivity properties, modification of the HTM Sp01 molecular structure for improved thermal stability has also been performed. It was found that PSC fabricated with symmetrical HTM Sp01 caused degradation in the devices, as the tendency of crystal growth in HTM Sp01 affected the contact between the perovskite photodetector and the HTM layer, either inside the pores or on the interfaces. The lifetime of the PSCs, however, can be improved if the crystal growth in spiro-OMeTAD can be suppressed. Thus, the design of asymmetric spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp05–Sp07) managed to increase the cell resistance toward thermal stress and thus prolonging the device lifetime.

In current trends of organic HTMs in meso-structured-based PSCs, designing new types of HTM with a tailored HOMO energy level and sufficient hole mobility to replace spiro-OMeTAD through functioning with different types of electron donors and acceptors are in progress. An early work from Edri and co-workers utilizing a commercially available hole-transporting organic small molecule, namely N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine (HTM 1) and electron-acceptor organic small molecules, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (HTM 2) and N,N′-dialkyl perylenediimide (HTM 3), as HTMs (Fig. 5) in combination with an Al2O3 mesoporous layer as the ETL and MAPbBr3 perovskite as a photodetector managed to yield a PCE of nearly 0.8%. In this device architecture, the non-electron accepting Al2O3 with a large energy band gap of about 5.75 eV (ref. 74) confined the photogenerated electrons within the perovskite region, while allowing holes to be injected into the HTM and to be subsequently transported to the back contact. These devices, however, suffered from large photocurrent JSC losses, possibly affected by the LUMO offsets between the TiO2–Al2O3 electron conductors and the MAPbBr3 perovskite. However, these devices also exhibited a high open-circuit voltage VOC up to 1.30 V, where this achievement relies on the selection of a suitable HTM with a compatible low lying HOMO energy level, with the mixed perovskite absorber and electron conductors employed.

The PCE of devices based on commercially available pristine HTMs 1–3 were far lower than that of devices with spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp01) in combination with TiO2 mesoporous as the ETL and MAPbI3 as the photodetector. Through the single deposition of MAPbI3 solution on top of a mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate, followed by the subsequent addition of HTM Sp01 with Li-TFSI and TBP as additives, the device was able to achieve a PCE of 7.6%. The PCE of a similar device architecture was improved by a sequential deposition of MAPbI3 solutions, where an early solution of PbI2 in dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin-coated on the substrate, followed by a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol. This enhanced the crystalline morphology of the perovskite absorber by creating a more homogenized and crystallized perovskite region, leading to a device performance with a PCE of 11.7% by using pristine HTM Sp01, while a PCE of 12.3% was achieved with HTM Sp01 and added Li-TFSI and TBP.Table 2 compares the photovoltaic performances of meso-structured PSCs based on commercial HTMs with spiro-OMeTAD.

Recently, Qin and co-workers designed a new organic HTM based on a quinolizino acridine core and compared its properties with the commercially available HTM Sp01. HTM 4 is a formation of three 4-[bromo-3,3′-dihexylsilane-2,2′-bithiophene]-7-[5′′-n-hexyl-(2,2′;5′,2′′-terthiophene)-5-yl]-benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole moieties linked to a quinolizino acridine core, and it possesses a strong intensive charge-transfer absorption at 421 and 580 nm. This flattened star-shaped HTM 4 has a HOMO level relatively lower but comparable to the hole mobility of HTM Sp01. Devices with pristine HTM 4 displayed distinctive performance (JSC = 17.9 mA cm−2; VOC = 1.04 V; FF = 68.0%; PCE = 12.8%) compared to devices employing pristine HTM Sp01 (JSC = 17.2 mA cm−2; VOC = 1.02 V; FF = 66.0%; PCE = 11.7%), owing to enhancement of the intermolecular π–π packing interactions, which favors efficient hole transport, improves light harvesting, and induces a charge-separated state.

Moreover, the quinolizino acridine core has also been adopted to produce HTM 5 with diphenylethenyl as side units, and its effectiveness compared with HTM Sp01 and HTM 6, which have a triphenylamine core linked to a terminal diphenylethenyl (Fig. 6). Both symmetrical star-shaped HTMs 5 and 6 were reported to be easily processable, cheaper, and have a narrower optical bandgap, Eg, of 2.70 eV compared to HTM Sp01 (Eg = 2.94 eV). HTMs 5 and 6 also exhibited UV absorption near the UV-visible range at 414 nm (molar absorptivity, ε = 9.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 396 nm (molar absorptivity, ε = 7.15 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively. Devices with pristine HTM 5 possessed a PCE of nearly 9.5%, while free-dopant HTM 6 exhibited a PCE of about 7.5%. This indicates that HTM 5, which benefits from a planar configuration of a quinolizino acridine core with high molar absorptivity at low energy levels, performed much better than that of HTM 6, which has a twisting angle of 48.9% between the nitrogen core and the phenyl units in the triphenylamine moiety. Upon the addition of TBP and Li-TFSI into HTMs 5 and 6, the devices were certified to have corresponding PCE values of 11.9% and 10.8%, which are slightly lower as compared to the device with doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 12.8%) under similar device fabrication conditions.
In a similar work by Choi and co-workers, a quinolizino acridine core and triphenylamine core were selected to couple with star-shaped tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenyl)amine as a terminal into HTMs 7 and 8, respectively (Fig. 6). The selection of a quinolizino acridine core was due to its ability to prolong the lifetime of the charge-separated state through delocalization of the generated cations over the planar tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenyl)amine moiety. Both HTMs 7 (Eg = 2.93 eV) and 8 (Eg = 2.97 eV) have almost similar optical bandgaps, Eg, as HTM Sp01 (Eg = 2.94 eV). Nevertheless, the hole mobilities of HTMs 7 (μ = 3.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 8 (μ = 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as calculated from the Mott–Gurney law, are lower than HTM Sp01 (μ = 4.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Here, a high hole mobility and low series resistance are required to achieve a high fill factor in the meso-structured PSCs. The fill factor of the PSCs increases in the order: HTM 8 < HTM 7 < HTM Sp01. With the assistance of TBP, Li-TFSI, and a cobalt dopant (FK209), devices with HTMs 7 and 8 yielded corresponding PCEs of 13.6% and 12.3%, which are slightly lower than HTM Sp01 (PCE = 14.7%).
Due to the advantages of the planar configuration of the quinolizino acridine core, this central core is further synthesized to form a larger molecule, HTM 9, with terminal bis-dimethylfluorenylamino. Meanwhile, HTM 10 is made of a triphenylamine core linked to bis-dimethylfluorenylamino as side units (Fig. 6). The introduction of bis-dimethylfluorenylamino side units are believed to prevent aggregation from the molecular stacking of bulky nonplanar structure, besides ensuring greater resistance to degradation. The hole mobilities of HTMs 9 and 10, as calculated from Mott–Gurney equation, are 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which implies that HTM 10 with a triphenylamine core has a larger series resistance than HTM 9. Therefore, devices doped with HTM 9 have a higher fill factor (68.7%) and PCE (14.2%) than devices doped with HTM 10 (FF = 63.4%, PCE = 11.8%).
As summarized from the works of Qin et al. and Choi et al. on the comparison of quinolizino acridine (fused triphenylamine) and triphenylamine as respective central cores with side substituents such as 4-[bromo-3,3′-dihexylsilane-2,2′-bithiophene]-7-[5′′-n-hexyl-(2,2′;5′,2′′-terthiophene)-5-yl]-benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole, diphenylethenyl, tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenyl)amine, and bis-dimethylfluorenylamino, we found that devices utilizing quinolizino-acridine-core-based HTMs have superior photovoltaic properties than triphenylamine-core-based HTMs. Employing quinolizino-acridine-core-based HTMs allows higher hole mobility, low series resistance, and high molar absorptivity at longer wavelength than that of triphenylamine-core-based HTMs, and where their electronic properties are affected by the planarity deviation of the nitrogen core and its phenyl side units.
In addition, variations of the side units on the triphenylamine core have also been studied by Choi and co-workers. HTMs 11 and 12 remained in a star-shaped form by utilizing electron-rich 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl (EDOT) and electron-poor benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl (BTD) as side units, respectively, with triphenylamine as the central core (Fig. 6). The report showed that HTM 11 facilitated better charge transfer than HTM 12, although this HTM displayed a smaller band gap (Eg: 2.18 eV), medium UV absorption at longer wavelength (λmax: 488 nm, ε: 3.02 × 104 M−1 cm−1), and smaller HOMO offset with the MAPbl3 absorber (EHOMO = −5.43 eV) as compared to HTM 11 (Fig. 7).
However, devices utilizing doped HTM 11 displayed an overall better device performance (JSC = 21.0 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.92 V; FF = 67.0%; PCE = 12.9%) compared to HTM 12 with the added additives (JSC = 20.6 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.88 V; FF = 63.0%; PCE = 11.5%). This can be explained by the incorporation of electron-rich EDOT moieties into HTM 11 contributing to the high hole mobility (μ = 9.19 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and allowing it to exhibit strong molar absorptivity, ε of 1.32 × 105 M−1 cm−1, at 388 nm, which subsequently enhances the device performances. Meanwhile, devices based on HTM 12 have lower photovoltaic properties than HTM 11, where charge recombination occurs at a faster rate at the MAPbI3 perovskite/HTM 12 interfaces. The photovoltaic performances of meso-structured PSCs based on quinolizino acridine and triphenylamine cores are summarized in Table 3.

Truxene core, also known as 10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a;1′,2′-c]fluorine, exists in a planar form of a heptacyclic polyarene structure. The planar, rigid, and fully π-conjugated characteristics of the truxene core form a C3h symmetry structure, which is advantageous for high hole mobility (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a tailored surface energy for the perovskite light harvester. The truxene-core-based HTMs, besides having a larger band gap than HTM Sp01 (Eg = 3.07 eV), also display a high thermal stability and thermal transition temperature (Tg), excellent electrochemical stability, and good solubility in organic solvents. For example, HTM 13, which represents truxene core coupled with N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino substituents, exhibited a high thermal decomposition at 432 °C, with a Tg of 134 °C. 1,3,5-Tris(di-p-anisylamino)benzene (HTM 14) consists of a benzene core and it mimics the structure of HTM 13 and is adopted as a reference HTM for comparison purposes. Both HTMs 13 and 14 appear in a starburst structure, with an angle close to 120° (Fig. 8). HTM 13, with an extended π-conjugation system at the truxene core, absorbs at longer wavelength with a stronger molar absorptivity (λmax = 356 nm, ε = 1.04 × 103 M−1 cm−1) than HTM 14 with a benzene core (λmax = 291 nm, ε = 7.71 × 102 M−1 cm−1).

In terms of device performance, devices with single-coated HTM 13 and added Li-TFSI and TBP yielded a JSC of 8.0 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V, and a fill factor of 45.0%, which led to a PCE of 3.2%. This is due to the high molecular weight and insertion of multi alkyl chains at the truxene core, which prevent aggregation among the intermolecules. Meanwhile, devices with single deposition of HTM 14 suffer from poor performance, with a JSC of 2.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.91 V, and a fill factor of 48.0%, leading to a low PCE of 0.9%. This poor performance is due to HTM 14 tending to form aggregation during spin-coating and undergoing crystallization in the solid-state thin film, which later affects the efficiency of hole-transport in the device. In addition, an energy mismatch, where the HOMO level of HTM 14 (EHOMO = −5.08 eV) is too near to the HOMO level of the carbon counter electrode (EHOMO = ∼5.00 eV) but far from that of the MAPbI3 (EHOMO = −5.30 eV) perovskite layer, also contributes to the reduced JSC, causing devices with HTM 14 to have a low PCE compared to HTM-free devices (PCE = 1.0%). Moreover, the best PCE for the device with doped HTM 13 was about half of the photoelectric conversion (PCE = 6.4%) generated by devices with doped HTM Sp01 under similar fabrication conditions.
Further work from Rakstys and co-workers on coupling a triazatruzene core with electron-rich methoxy engineered side arms into HTMs 15–18 displayed promising device performances. Triazatruzene is a combination of three indole units with a benzene ring forming a two dimensional (2D) π-system. It offers large chemical versatility to tune electronic and morphological properties besides providing a large aromatic surface for efficient intermolecular charge transfer. Through tuning the ratio of (FAPbI3)0.85/(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite layer, an average device with a simple 3,8,13-trimethoxy substituted-triazatruzene core (HTM 15) with added Li-TFSI, TBP, and FK209 yielded a PCE of 8.9%, also achieving a high VOC of 0.97 V and a photocurrent JSC of 16.0 mA cm−2. The attached n-hexyl chains on the planar triazatruzene core provided a solubility characteristic for HTMs 15–18. Extension of the π-conjugated system on the triazatruzene core with respective p-methoxybenzene boronic acid, 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline and 4,4′-dimethoxy diphenylamine produced high molecular weight HTMs 16–18 (Fig. 8) with absorption maxima at 340, 368, and 378 nm, respectively. HTM 15 (μ = 5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and HTM 18 (μ = 6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) have a hole mobility an order of magnitude higher than HTM Sp01 (μ = 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), while HTM 16 (μ = 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and HTM 17 (μ = 2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) have comparable hole mobility to HTM Sp01.
In meso-structured PSCs, the photovoltaic performance is seen to decrease simultaneously from HTM 16 > HTM 17 > HTM 18 > HTM 15. This indicates that additional aromatic substitution on the triazatruxene core did not improve the device performance. In fact, the utilization of large molecular sized HTMs 17 and 18 yielded only a moderate device efficiency. According to Rakstys et al., devices with HTM 16 and 17 achieved a high VOC of 1.15 V and 1.13 V, respectively, owing to having a more stabilized and deeper HOMO level than HTM Sp01 (VOC = 1.07 V). Meanwhile, measurement of the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) showed that HTM 15 and 18 had corresponding short charge carrier lifetimes of 7 ns and 4 ns, respectively, indicating that a fast recombination occurs at the perovskite–HTM interfaces, which subsequently affects the collection of the short-circuit current JSC in the device. Therefore, devices based on doped HTM 15 and 18 achieved PCEs of not more than 12.0%. The best device efficiency of 17.7% was achieved by applying HTM 16 with added Li-TFSI, TBP, and FK209, which performed better than devices based on doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 17.1%). The device performances for meso-structured PSCs utilizing truxene-core-based HTMs are summarized in Table 4.

Cheng and co-workers adopted an electron-rich phenoxazine core to form acceptor–donor–acceptor small molecules. Their utilized phenoxazine core was a nonplanar fused ring system with a dihedral angle of ∼169°. HTMs based on this central core display suitable energy levels and possess strong absorption in the visible range, high hole mobility, and conductivity. HTM 19 used electron-deficient benzothiazole as the linker with a terminal [(4-hexylthiophene-2-yl)methylidene]propeanedinitrile and a phenoxazine core. Meanwhile, HTM 20 consisted of thiophene linked in between a phenoxazine core with a terminal [(4-hexylthiophene-2-yl)methylidene]propeanedinitrile (Fig. 9). HTM 20 displayed broad and strong absorption at 519 nm with ε of 3.69 × 104 M−1 cm−1, while the absorption of HTM 19 was red-shifted to 564 nm with ε of 3.59 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The wavelength difference is due to the incorporation of the electron-deficient benzothiazole linker in HTM 20. Moreover, the infusion of the benzothiazole linker in HTM 19 contributed to a slightly higher hole mobility (μ = 5.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity (σ = 2.01 × 10−4 S cm−1) as compared to HTM 20 with a thiophene linker (μ = 4.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; σ = 9.36 × 10−5 S cm−1). Both HTM 19 and 20 had a higher HOMO level than the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, which favored efficient hole-transport. Thus, a high VOC of 0.97 V and 0.95 V were achieved through devices employing pristine HTM 19 and 20, respectively.

The dopant-free HTM 19 had a certified PCE of 12.8%, which was comparable to that of devices with doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 12.8%). Meanwhile, dopant-free HTM 20 based devices have a lower PCE of 11.5%. Devices employing pristine HTMs 19 and 20 have lower JSC values than devices based on HTM Sp01, possibly due to competition between HTMs and the perovskite photodetector in harvesting light at the visible range, which subsequently affects the photocurrent, JSC. Other than that, devices with pristine HTM 19 exhibited the highest FF value of 74.2%, indicating that HTM 19 film possessed the lowest series resistance compared to HTMs 20 and Sp01. As a result, devices using HTM 19, with better hole mobility and conductivity, display superior device performance compared to devices based on pristine HTM 20.
In other work progressed by Cheng et al., the side units of HTM 20 were modified and replaced with a terminal [5,5-dimethyl-3-[(1E)-prop-1-en-1-yl]cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene]propanedinitrile to form HTM 21 with a phenoxazine core and thiophene as a linker (Fig. 9). HTM 21 had good solubility in organic solvents and exhibited strong absorption at 413 nm (ε = 2.71 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 560 nm (ε = 3.12 × 104 M−1 cm−1). HTM 21 possessed a hole mobility μ of 4.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a conductivity σ of 1.38 × 10−4 S cm−1 in the same magnitude as HTM 19. The dopant-free HTM 21 based devices achieved a PCE of 10.3%, which is higher than devices using pristine HTM Sp01 (PCE = 7.8%). It is believed that the device efficiency for devices based on free-dopant HTMs are limited by the fill factor, which relies on the conductivity of the pristine HTM itself.
The addition of Li-TFSI and TBP into HTM 21 improved the device efficiency from 10.3% to 12.3%, with the conductivity of the pristine HTM 21 boosted six-fold from 1.38 × 10−4 to 8.57 × 10−4 S cm−1. Nevertheless, the improvement in device efficiency by using doped HTM 21 is merely half of the PCE increment of devices based on doped HTM Sp01 from 7.8% to 12.8%. Overall, the photovoltaic performances of devices with HTM 21 are still similar to the analog devices containing HTM 19 and 20. Devices with doped HTM 21 possessed a high VOC of 0.99 V and a high FF (71.4%), but a lower photocurrent JSC (17.3 mA cm−2) as compared to devices employing doped HTM Sp01, owing to the similar phenomena that contribute to there being no photocurrent in between HTM 19 or 20 with the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The integrated current densities recorded from the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurement for devices with doped HTM 21 and doped HTM Sp01 were 16.8 and 19.3 mA cm−2, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the measured JSC values from the I–V measurements, showing that devices with doped HTM 21 work less efficiently in terms of photoelectric conversion in the range from 400 to 700 nm if compared with doped HTM Sp01.
Under a stability test at a humidity of about 30% and a temperature of 25 °C for seven days, the PCE for unencapsulated devices based on pristine HTM Sp01 decayed from 7.8% to 3.5%, while unsealed devices based on pristine HTM-21 managed to retain 86% of the initial PCE, whereby device stability relied on the hydrophobicity of the HTMs. Less hydrophobic HTM will simply allow water to penetrate into the device and subsequently cause degradation of the perovskite film through the formation of PbI2 after MAI cations leach out from the MAPbI3 layer. Besides, HTM Sp01, with a smaller contact angle of 99.5° compared to HTM 21 (107.4°), is reported to be more hydrophilic than HTM 21. The addition of ionic additives into HTM will degrade the perovskite layer faster, and these ionic additives reduce the hydrophobic characteristic of the HTM and thus allow an easier oxidation on the HTM under the presence of oxygen. This is observed from the contact angle of HTM Sp01, which decreases from 99.5° to 78.1° after the addition of Li-TFSI and TBP. The device performances of PSCs utilizing a phenoxazine-core-based HTMs are listed in Table 5.

Qin and co-workers developed thiophene-pyrrole-based S,N-heteropentacene as a core with a terminal dicyanovinylene as HTMs in meso-structured PSCs. These HTMs exhibited low bandgap energy, tunable HOMO–LUMO energy levels, good charge transport properties, and high photo-absorptivity in the visible and near-infrared region, which contribute to the light harvesting ability. HTMs 22 and 23 were formed by using dicyanovinylene-terminated S,N-heteropentacene with 3-hexylthiophene and 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene as spacers, respectively (Fig. 10). HTM 22 displays a strong intramolecular charge-transfer, with absorption maximum at 655 nm (ε = 1.18 × 105 M−1 cm−1), while the absorption of HTM 23 is blue-shifted to 630 nm, with a molar absorptivity of 8.63 × 104 M−1 cm−1, although it has a prolonged π-conjugation length compared to in HTM 22. Both HTMs 22 and 23 have narrow optical bandgaps, ranging from 1.68–1.70 eV, with a HOMO level higher than for the MAPbI3 perovskite (EHOMO = −5.43 eV). The small offset of the HOMO level between acene-derivatives-based HTMs and the perovskite photodetector facilitates better hole-transporting properties in the PSCs. The measured hole mobilities of HTM 22 and 23 are 7.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, correspondingly, which are of the same magnitude as HTM Sp01 (4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).

The HTM-free devices as fabricated by Qin and co-workers yielded a PCE of 7.6%. Furthermore, the device efficiency was improved to 10.5% upon applying pristine HTM 22 in the PSCs. Meanwhile, devices based on pristine HTM 23 achieved a lower PCE of 9.5%, owing to the lower efficiency of the charge transport process, as observed from the lower JSC value that of pristine HTM 22-based devices. The IPCE spectra showed that HTM-free devices displayed a peak IPCE value around 68% at 510 nm. The presence of acene-derivatives-based HTMs in PSCs improves the photocurrent from 400–800 nm, with a peak IPCE value at 510 nm, achieving nearly 80%, owing to the effective charge extraction between HTMs and MAPbI3 perovskite film. In addition, the utilization of pristine HTM 22 also contributes to the photocurrent, with a new peak IPCE value of 48% at 720 nm.
In Steck and co-workers work, the thiophene-pyrrole-based S,N-heteropentacene core was coupled with the corresponding dicyanovinylene-terminated 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and dicyanovinylene-terminated thiophene ring to form HTMs 24 and 25 (ref. 88) (Fig. 10). These HTMs have similar characteristic as the previous acene-derivatives-based HTMs from Qin et al.'s work. HTM 24 absorbed strongly at 683 nm (ε of 1.37 × 105 M−1 cm−1), while HTM 25 exhibited a strong absorption at 655 nm (ε of 1.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1). The blue-shift absorption of about 28 nm of HTM 25 compared to HTM 24 and the lower ε value can be ascribed to the larger deviation from planarity between the dicyanovinylene-terminated thiophene ring and the thiophene-pyrrole-based S,N-heteropentacene central core. Utilization of these HTMs may enhance the PSCs, with stronger absorption in the low energy region up to 815 nm, where they may assist in the absorption of excess light beyond the perovskite absorption range. The extracted hole mobilities from Mott–Gurney's law for HTMs 24 and 25 are 4.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are in the same magnitude as the other acene-derivatives-based HTMs 22 and 23 as well as HTM Sp01.
The photovoltaic performances of free-HTM devices in Steck et al.'s work were similar to previous reports, and the device efficiencies were improved from 7.1% to 11.4% and 10.3%, respectively, through capping with pristine HTMs 24 and 25. Pristine HTM 24- and 25-based devices have better photovoltaic properties than that of devices using pristine HTM 23, possibly due to the better arrangement of molecules in the solid state that provides a better film quality, as shown by the high FF obtained. All the acene-derivatives-based HTMs 22–25 have similar characteristic, where they offer improved charge collection and extraction in the device, leading to an enhanced photocurrent over the whole spectral range from 400–800 nm.
As a summary for S,N-heteropentacene-core-based HTMs terminated by the electron-acceptor dicyanovinylene and flanked by 3-hexylthiophene (HTMs 22–23), EDOT (HTM 24), and thiophene (HTM 25), these HTMs have shown strong absorption maxima in the low energy region from 630–683 nm, with a high molar absorptivity up to 105 M−1 cm−1 and possess high hole mobilities in the magnitude of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Their HOMO levels ranged from −5.10 to 5.80 eV, allowing for efficient charge transportation from the perovskite layer to the counter electrode and, thus, a resulting VOC in the range of 0.90–0.99 V. These HTMs improve the photocurrent in the visible region from 400–800 nm by possessing a moderate JSC in between 15.2 and 16.6 mA cm−2 and a moderate FF value in the range of 65–72%, leading to a device efficiency of 9.5–11.4%. The energy level diagrams of acene-derivatives-based HTMs as compared to other types of HTMs are shown in Fig. 11.
Another type of acene-derivative-based HTM is a linear pentacene core substituted with a 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) (TIPS) moiety. This HTM 26 has an optical bandgap (Eg = 1.87 eV) larger than the S,N-heteropentacene-core-based HTMs with its LUMO and HOMO levels corresponding to −3.53 eV and −5.40 eV, respectively. The HOMO offset between HTM 26 and the MAPbI3 perovskite is about 40 mV, which assists in gaining a high open-circuit voltage, VOC, for the PSCs. HTM 26 displayed three absorption peaks centered at 549, 590, and 643 nm, owing to π–π* intermolecular interactions. However, pristine HTM 26 suffers from a low conductivity of 3.5 × 10−7 S cm−1, but it has a relatively high mobility greater than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 as reported.
The devices based on pristine HTM 26 yielded a high photocurrent of 20.9 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.92 V, and an FF of 61.0%, achieving a PCE of 11.8%. Upon the addition of Li-TFSI and TBP into HTM 26, the conductivity improved by a factor of two magnitude up to 10−5 S cm−1, resulting in a small enhancement in the VOC value from 0.918 to 0.924 V. In fact, devices with doped HTM 26 endured performance losses where the JSC value decreased to 17.0 mA cm−2 and FF reduced to 55.0%, causing the PCE to be reduced to 8.4%. The introduction of Li-TFSI and TBP in HTM 26 was found to increase the series resistance, RS, to about 85% higher than devices with pristine HTM 26, which led to the fill factor shrinking as a result of unfavorable packing of the structure hindering the mobility of HTM 26. Devices based on doped HTM 26 and doped HTM Sp01 have smaller shunt resistances (RSh) than devices with pristine HTM 26 as doped HTMs have a higher leakage current. Therefore, devices based on pristine HTM 26 has a PCE of 11.8%, which was more efficient than devices with doped HTM SP01 (PCE = 10.1%). The photovoltaic performances of meso-structured PSCs employing acene-derivatives-based HTMs are summarized in Table 6.

The simplest carbazole-derivatives-based HTMs is the carbazole-terminated 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) core (HTM 27) (Fig. 12). This HTM has similar optical and electronic properties as HTM Sp01. HTM 27 exhibited single absorption at 360 nm, which was blue-shifted about 27 nm compared to that of HTM Sp01 (λmax = 387 nm). HTM 27 had a corresponding conductivity and hole mobility of 9.36 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Devices using pristine HTM 27 achieved a PCE of 7.5%, and this result is comparable to the devices based on pristine HTM Sp01, with a PCE of 7.7%.

The addition of 12 mol% MY11 into HTM 27 results in an improvement of the conductivity by a factor of two orders of magnitude and two-fold for the hole mobility of that of pristine HTM 27, where doping with MY11 subsequently increases the JSC and FF values. MY11, with its relatively high oxidation potential ability, induced more oxidized HTM 27 species, which later shifted the HOMO level of HTM 27 to a deeper redox potential after doping, besides allowing a greater depth penetration of HTM into the mesoporous TiO2 to facilitate better hole extraction, thus improving the device performance. Therefore, devices based on MY11 doped HTM 27 yielded a PCE of 12.0% after improving in a broad working range from 350–800 nm, as seen from the IPCE spectrum. Meanwhile, the PCE for devices with pristine HTM Sp01 is enhanced from 7.7% to 12.2% after doping with 12 mol% MY11.
In order to gain a greater understanding of the effects of large macromolecules as terminal groups on the EDOT core, in Li et al.'s work, other forms of HTMs were adopted for comparison with HTM 27, such as HTM 28, which was made of a p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine endcapped EDOT core, where the terminal moieties were similar to the HTM Sp01 (Fig. 12). HTM 28 had a lower glass transition temperature (Tg = 73 °C) than the carbazole-terminated EDOT core, HTM 27 (Tg = 104 °C), and HTM Sp01 (Tg = 125 °C). The absorption of HTM 28 was blue-shifted about 25 nm as compared to HTM 27, due to the presence of bulky p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine at the terminal.
A device utilizing pristine HTM 28 achieved a PCE of 10.6%, and the device efficiency was improved by the addition of 15% FK102, which resulted in a PCE of 13.2%. According to Li et al., the addition of FK102 lowers the Fermi level of the EHOMO of HTM 28 to generate a higher voltage in the device through the oxidation of HTM 28 to a higher oxidation potential and due to increased hole conductivity, which subsequently improves the fill factor by reducing the series resistance, RS, in the system. Devices with doped HTM 28 had comparable PCEs to devices utilizing doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 13.7%). For the stability test, carried out in an oven at 70 °C for 7 days, the PCE value for unsealed devices based on doped HTM 28 and HTM Sp01 displayed similar behaviors, where both devices suffered from a 15% decrease in the initial PCE value, owing to moisture-induced degradation of the hygroscopic perovskite layer, and HTM 28 had a low Tg that reduced the durability of the PSCs.
Meanwhile, Xu and co-workers developed HTMs 29 and 30 based on carbazole as a versatile reactive site, together with other functional groups to tune its optical and electrical properties (Fig. 12). HTMs 29 and 30 exhibited absorption peaks centered at 310 nm and 307 nm, respectively. HTM 30 possessed a higher conductivity of 1.05 × 10−4 S cm−1 and hole mobility of 1.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, greater than HTM 29 (σ = 2.88 × 10−5 S cm−1; μ = 1.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), possibly due to the larger π-conjugation system of HTM 30, which is useful for efficient π–π stacking in the solid-state film. Thus, HTM 30, with its better hole transfer properties owing to its lower reorganization energy, as determined from theoretical studies, demonstrated superior photovoltaic properties compared to devices employing HTM 29. Devices based on HTM 30 with Li-TFSI and TBP added achieved a comparable PCE of 9.8% as devices utilizing doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 10.2%), while doped HTM 29-based devices managed to achieve a PCE of only 7.6%, in which the MAPbI3−xClx mixed perovskite worked as a light harvester in this device architecture. HTM 29 has a faster recombination process than HTM 30, which is the reason for the lower PCE achieved.
HTM 31 from Gratia and co-workers work is an analog of HTM 30 with two units of N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H carbazole-3,6-diamine moiety linked to a central 1,2-phenyl instead of the central 4,4′-biphenyl as employed in HTM 30 (Fig. 12). HTM 31 absorbed at the UV-vis region below 450 nm, while doping with 10 mol% FK209 produced an oxidized species of HTM 31, which displayed two new absorption peaks at 628 nm and 814 nm. Moreover, HTM 31 (EHOMO = 5.04 eV, σ = 4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1; μ = 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) had a higher HOMO level than HTM Sp01, but its hole mobility, as measured from the xerographic time-of-flight method (XTOF), was about half of its counterpart. HTM 31 was also reported to be thermally stable, with a high Tg at 141 °C, which is relatively higher than that of HTM Sp01 with a Tg of 125 °C. Devices based on HTM 31 doped with Li-TFSI, TBP, and 10 mol% FK209 achieved a high photocurrent of 21.4 mA cm−2, a high open-circuit exceeding 1.00 V (VOC = 1.09 V), and a moderate fill factor of 73.4%, leading to a PCE of 16.9%. However, standard devices with doped HTM Sp01 have a higher PCE offset of nearly 1.4% than devices based on doped HTM 31.
The N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H carbazole-3,6-diamine moiety was further adopted as a terminal in the work by Sung and co-workers, together with a respective central core of 2,2′-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenoxy)methyl-6,6′-dimethylbiphenyl (HTM 32), 1,3,5-phenyl (HTM 33), or 1,3,5-trisphenylamine (HTM 34) to form new HTMs (Fig. 12). These HTMs, 32–34, had optical bandgaps of about 3.00 eV that were comparable to HTM Sp01. Furthermore, the HTMs 32–34 displayed strong absorption in the 386–391 nm range with a molar absorptivity of 0.86 × 105 to 1.18 × 105 M−1 cm−1, but exhibited poor conductivity in the order of 10−8 to 10−9 S cm−1. Devices based on doped HTMs 32–34 displayed a light-to-electricity efficiency of 13.3–14.8% due to the high photocurrent of nearly 20.0 mA cm−2, high VOC of about 1.00 V, and average FF of 70.0%. These values indicate that the structure with three carbazole arms has better photovoltaic properties than that of the structure with two carbazole arms. In comparison to standard devices with doped HTM Sp01, the PCE of the best device based on doped HTM 33 was lower, with a PCE difference of about 0.44%.
A modified N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H carbazole-3,6-diamine moiety was used in Kang and co-workers work as an extended π-conjugation system with a central core 4,4′-biphenyl (HTM 35), 1,4-phenyl (HTM 36), or 1,3,5-trisphenylbenzene (HTM 37) to form effective π–π stacking molecules with their solubility assisted by the presence of hexyloxy and methoxy side chains (Fig. 13). HTMs 35–37 exhibited strong absorption in the 387–393 nm range but poor conductivities in the order of 10−8 to 10−9 S cm−1, which showed their similar properties to the previous HTMs 32–34. The conductivities of HTMs 35–37 could be improved by the number of modified N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H carbazole-3,6-diamine moieties on the core, which also contributed to enhancing the fill factor owing to the extended π-conjugation system.
HTMs 33 and 36, which have identical molecular structures but different alkyloxy chain lengths on the diphenylamine moiety of the N3,N3,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H carbazole-3,6-diamine terminal, presented different photovoltaic performances. It was noticed that devices with longer alkyloxy chains in HTM 36 had lower photovoltaic properties than devices with methoxy chains terminated on HTM 33; albeit, devices based on doped HTM 36 still achieved a moderate photocurrent of 18.6 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.98 V, and an FF of 67.2%, leading to a PCE of 12.6%. This shows that the hexyloxy-chains-terminated diphenylamine moieties in HTMs 35–37 affect the device performance by lowering their PCE values to 11.0–13.0% compared to the equivalent devices based on their methoxy-terminated diphenylamine counterparts, HTM 32–34. The low efficiency of devices with HTM 35–37 is possibly due to the introduction of long hexyloxy chains on the diphenylamine hindering the intermolecular π–π stacking, subsequently leading to a faster recombination. The PCE offset of the best device with doped HTM 37 as compared to devices utilizing doped HTM Sp01 differs by about 0.76%. The device performances of meso-structured PSCs employing carbazole-derivatives-based HTMs are summarized in Table 7.

Terminal p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine moieties are mainly used in the thiophene-derivatives-based HTMs in order to design new HTMs mimicking the structure of HTM Sp01. Various thiophene derivatives were employed and incorporated with a terminal p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine moiety to form large macromolecules, which were then applied as HTMs in meso-structured PSCs, including 2,3,4,5-tetra[4,4′-bis(methoxyphenyl)aminophen-4′′-yl]-thiophene (HTM 38), and 4,4′-5,5′-tetra[4,4′-bis(methoxyphenyl)aminophen-4′′-yl]-2,2′-bithiophene (HTM 39), as synthesized in Li et al.'s work, which consist of the corresponding thiophene and 2,2′-bithiophene core with p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine side units (Fig. 14).

Both HTMs 38 and 39 had good solubility in organic solvents and displayed respective Tg values of 100 °C and 120 °C. Their Tg values are higher than HTM 28 (Tg = 73 °C) with an EDOT core but lower than HTM Sp01 (Tg = 125 °C). HTM 38 absorbed at 446 nm, while the absorption of HTM 39 was red-shifted about 31 nm to 477 nm due to extension of the thiophene ring at its core. HTMs 38 and 39 have comparable HOMO levels as the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, which provides a good platform for charge carrier transport and results in the devices having a high VOC of more than 1.00 V. Devices based on doped HTMs 38 and 39 displayed superior photovoltaic properties than devices utilizing doped HTM Sp01, achieving respective PCEs of 15.4% and 15.2%, respectively, although with a limitation in the photocurrent of around 20.0 mA cm−2. For the device stability tests in an oven at 70 °C for 2 weeks, devices based on HTMs 38 and 39 had better stability, with a moderately decreased PCE value after the test of about 16% as compared to 20% losses in initial performance exhibited by devices based on HTM Sp01.
In other research work, Ganesan and co-workers developed 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spiro-bi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]-6,6′,8,8′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (HTM 40) as a new HTM for meso-structured PSCs. Pristine HTM 40 consisted of spiro-bipropylenedioxythiophene as its core with a dihedral angle between the two thiophene rings of about 7°, which is beneficial for stronger intermolecular interaction compared with the dihedral angle of 89.94° shown by the spiro-bifluorene core in HTM Sp01. HTM 40 in dichloromethane solution displayed two absorption peaks at 300 and 396 nm. It was electrochemically stable and had a higher Tg value (Tg = 175 °C) than that of HTM Sp01 (Tg = 125 °C).
Pristine HTM 40 had an offset of its HOMO level about 80 mV lower than HTM Sp01, which favors obtaining a higher VOC, resulting in the devices doped with Li-TFSI and TBP reaching a VOC of 1.02 V. Meanwhile, devices with doped HTM Sp01 obtained a VOC of 0.80 V, with this value boosted to 0.91 V upon the addition of FK209. Both HTMs 40 and Sp01 underwent improved film quality upon the introduction of FK209, which also led to a higher fill factor but some losses on its photocurrent, JSC. Devices based on FK209-doped HTM 40 achieved a PCE of 13.4%, which was higher than that for devices utilizing FK209-doped HTM Sp01, which had a PCE of 12.2%. The results of the stability test carried out under ambient conditions for 4 days showed that both sets of devices underwent degradation, where devices with doped HTM Sp01 degraded more than devices with doped HTM 40. This implies that the adoption of effective molecular stacking is essential to introduce a more compact crystalline film able to protect the perovskite layer from degradation.
In Franckevicius et al.'s work, a simple thiophene ring was expanded to 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] as a central core and utilized p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine as the terminal to form HTM 41 (Fig. 14). This new spiro-cyclopentadithiophene-based HTM 41 exhibited strong absorption at 447 nm, with a molar absorptivity of 1 × 105 mol−1 cm−1 and a Tg of 150 °C, which was about 25 °C higher than the Tg of HTM Sp01. Based on the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method, pristine HTM 41 had a hole mobility of 6.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, but this value increased an order of magnitude to 3.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 under light illumination for 5 minutes where the phenomenon of light soaking induced mobility occurred, but this effect is negligible for HTM Sp01.
The best photovoltaic results achieved by devices with pristine HTM 41 were a JSC of 19.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, and a fill factor of 72.0%, which yielded a PCE of 13.4%. The PCEs of devices employing pristine HTM 41 were far greater than the PCEs of devices based on HTM Sp01 (PCE = 7.2%), owing to their better photovoltaic performances. The PCE of devices using HTM Sp01 could be increased more than two-fold from 7.2% to 15.0% after adding Li-TFSI, TBP, and FK209. Meanwhile, devices employing HTM 41 exhibited different performances, whereby the addition of Li-TFSI and TBP caused a reduction in the photocurrent in the devices from 19.3 to 13.8 mA cm−2, which further declined to 10.0 mA cm−2 after the incorporation of FK209 into HTM 41. This results in an obvious PCE decrease in devices with HTM 41 from 13.4% (pristine) to 10.3% (Li-TFSI- and TBP doping) to a low of 6.0% (Li-TFSI-, TBP-. and FK209 doping), possibly due to the opposite effect of ionic doping with the light soaking characteristic of HTM 41 affecting the JSC value. The advantages of a light soaking effect in pristine HTM 41 allows the undoped devices to have comparable PCEs as the devices doped with HTM Sp01.
In other research work conducted by Abate and co-workers, a silolothiophene core was adopted to form HTMs 42 and 43 with p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine as the terminal group, as shown in Fig. 14. These HTMs had superior thermal stability than HTM Sp01 and displayed similar strong absorption in the visible region at about 450 nm, as well as HOMO levels with an EHOMO offset of 140 mV higher than that of the MAPbI3 perovskite energy level. Therefore, devices based on doped HTM 42 and 43 have identical VOC values of nearly 0.97 V and fill factors of 72.0%. However, these devices are varied in terms of JSC, where devices utilizing doped HTM 43 had a better photocurrent (JSC) than devices with doped HTM 42. However, devices with doped HTM 43 achieved a PCE of 13.5%, which was lower than devices with doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 15.2%). The reason that devices with doped HTM Sp01 performed better is due to them having a much higher quality film possessing a low series resistance, RS, of 44 Ω cm−2 as compared to doped HTM 43 (RS = 87 Ω cm−2) and doped HTM 42 (RS = 103 Ω cm−2).
A new test was conducted by Abate and co-workers to determine the lifetime of the meso-structure PSCs-based doped HTMs 42, 43, and Sp01 through monitoring the steady-state maximum power output (MPO) over several days under UV-filtered simulated sunlight and a continuous forward bias voltage in an argon atmosphere. The devices based on HTM Sp01 had a half-life of 1000 hours, while devices based on HTM 43 had a six-fold half-life longer than that of HTM Sp01, owing to the superior thermal stability offered by HTM 43. This indicates that the stability of the PSCs can be improved by employing a silolothiophene core type HTM that has a higher Tg.
Krishnamoorthy et al. used a swivel-cruciform thiophene core to form HTM 44 with a terminal p-methoxy-substituted triphenylamine (Fig. 14). Pristine HTM 44 displayed two absorptions at 302 nm and 397 nm. It had a low Tg (65 °C), which was about the half of the Tg of HTM Sp01 (125 °C), and a lower HOMO level of about 90 mV compared to HTM Sp01. Upon doping with respective FK102 and FK269, the EHOMO of HTM 44 shifted from −5.13 eV to the much lower redox potentials of −5.37 eV and −5.65 eV, respectively. As for the device performance, devices based on Li-TFSI- and TBP-doped HTM 44 yielded a JSC of 10.3 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.99 V, and an FF of 70.9%, which contributed to a PCE of 7.3%. The addition of 15 mol% of FK102 into HTM 44 further improved the PCE from 7.3% to 8.7%.
Meanwhile, FK269, which has a deeper HOMO level than FK102, showed a significant efficiency improvement through boosting the PCE of devices with doped HTM 44 from 7.3% to 11.0% after adding 12 mol% of FK269. Transient photovoltage decay (TPV) analysis showed that devices utilizing FK269-doped HTM 44 exhibited an obvious slower decay, which implies a decrease in recombination, which then improves the FF values of the devices. The addition of FK269 is believed to cause torsion relaxation in HTM 44 and thus promotes better interaction with the MAPbI3 perovskite, besides providing an extended delocalization length for the radical cations to reduce recombination in the device. As a result, devices with FK269-doped HTM 44 displayed a comparable PCE result (PCE = 11.0%) to devices with FK269-doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 11.4%).
A recent work by Molina-Ontoria and co-workers introduced benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene as the central core, terminated with three units of p-methoxydiphenylamine, p-methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole, or p-methoxytriphenylamine to synthesize HTMs 45, 46, and 47, respectively. These HTMs 45–47 have a comparable HOMO level to HTM Sp01, and a HOMO offset relatively 200 mV higher than the perovskite energy level. The variation of the terminal groups on the benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene core was found to affect the lateral conductivity of the HTMs, where the conductivity increased in the order: HTM 45 (6.0 × 10−6 S cm−1) < HTM 46 (1.3 × 10−5 S cm−1) < HTM 47 (2.79 × 10−5 S cm−1) upon doping with 3 mol% of FK209. The conductivities of the doped HTMs 45–47 were comparable to the pristine HTM Sp01, but an order of magnitude lower than that of doped HTM Sp01.
The utilization of doped HTMs 45–47 with either MAPbI3 or (FAPbI3)0.85/(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite absorbers in PSCs led to remarkable PCE achievements exceeding 16.0%, owing to the effective π–π intermolecular interaction of the benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene core, which displays a C3h symmetry whereby three thiophene rings are fused to benzene central ring. Here, 3 mol% FK209-doped HTM 47 had the highest conductivity among the other benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene-core-based HTMs with a certified best PCE of 18.2% and with almost no hysteresis when incorporated into the MAPbI3 perovskite absorber, and a device performances comparable to those devices with the doped HTM Sp01 counterpart. The PCE of the devices with doped HTM 47 were reported to reproducible, with an average PCE of 17.7% ± 0.4%. Moreover, the incorporation of doped HTMs 45–47 on a (FAPbI3)0.85/(MAPbBr3)0.15 mixed perovskite in PSCs assisted the devices to achieve a high photocurrent JSC of at least 21.6 mA cm−2. Table 8 compares the photovoltaic performances of meso-structured PSCs employing thiophene derivatives as HTMs with the commercially available HTM, spiro-OMeTAD. The energy levels diagram of the HTMs based on the thiophene and carbazole derivatives are shown in Fig. 15.

The simplest vinyl-linked-based HTMs introduced by Lv and co-workers in meso-structured PSCs are 3,6-di(2-(4-(N,N-di(p-tolyl)amino)phenyl)vinyl)-2-thiophene (HTM 48) and 3,6-di(2-(4-(N,N-di(p-tolyl)amino)phenyl)vinyl)-9-ethyl-carbazole (HTM 49), as illustrated in Fig. 16. The introduction of a π-conjugated vinyl spacer into the triphenylamine moiety helps to modify the optical and charge transport properties besides forming a non-coplanarity structure that limits the aggregation of HTMs and provides a good film-forming property. Both HTMs 48 and 49 exhibited a single and broad absorption near the UV region at 384.5 nm and 376 nm, respectively, therefore in a region where these HTMs will not interrupt the solar harvesting activity of MAPbI3 perovskite in the visible region. Their HOMO levels, as determined from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), were in range of −5.28 eV to −5.31 eV, thus higher than the maximum valence band of the MAPbI3 perovskite absorber, which allows for efficient charge transport. The Tg of HTM 49 (75.3 °C) is nearly three-fold higher than the Tg of HTM 48 (28.5 °C), but both their Tg are far lower than the Tg of HTM Sp01. Both HTMs 48 and 49 displayed hole mobilities of 5.66 × 10−4 and 7.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are both relatively higher than that of HTM Sp01 (2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), owing to the stronger π–π stacking between adjacent molecules, which contributes to efficient hole conductivity.

The higher hole mobility of HTM 49 resulted in devices with higher JSC (18.4 mA cm−2) and FF (70.0%) values than their counterpart devices based on pristine HTM 48 (JSC = 15.4 mA cm−2; FF = 63.0%). This shows that HTM 48 film has a high series resistance, which is responsible for the lower FF value, while the low charge generation affects the JSC value. Thus, devices utilizing pristine HTM 49 had a PCE of 12.0%, which means an additional 3% of PCE over devices on based pristine HTM 48 (PCE = 9.0%). However, the addition of Li-TFSI and TBP into HTM 49 did not improve the device performance but rather reduced the PCE to 7.0% as compared to devices with pristine HTM 49, where the performance in terms of the JSC and FF values dropped in devices based on doped HTM 49, and yet this phenomenon still cannot be resolved. In comparison to devices with pristine HTM Sp01, devices based on pristine HTM 48 and 49 had offset PCE values of 4.1% and 1.1%, respectively.
In other research work done by Lv and co-workers, a butadiene spacer was employed to bridge the triphenylamine moiety with a 4-phenyl-4-α-naphthyl core. HTM 50 represents 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-tolyl)-phenylamine, while HTM 51 refers to 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-phenylamine (Fig. 16). The HTMs differ in the form of the methyl or methoxy units terminated on the triphenylamine moiety. These HTMs displayed absorption in the visible region, where HTM 50 absorbed at 451 nm, while the absorption of HTM 51 was red-shifted about 20 nm to 471 nm. The hole mobilities of HTM 50 and 51, as evaluated from time-of-flight (TOF) transient hole-current measurements, were 2.98 × 10−3 and 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereby their mobilities are about two orders of magnitude higher than the hole mobility of HTM Sp01 (4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Lv et al. reported that the effect of different p-positions of the methyl or methoxy substituents on the triphenylamine moiety is negligible toward tuning the energy levels as compared to the large π-conjugated backbone made of triphenylamine and butadiene derivatives.
Devices based on pristine HTM 51 had a certified PCE of 11.6%, which is higher than that of devices based on pristine HTM 50, with a PCE of 11.3%. However, devices based on pristine HTM 50 possessed a larger JSC of 18.1 mA cm−2 compared with devices based on pristine HTM 51 (JSC of 17.9 mA cm−2), owing to the different p-position of the methyl or methoxy substituents on the triphenylamine moiety, which also has a small effect on π–π stacking of the HTMs. The devices based on pristine HTMs 50 and 51 are reproducible, as claimed by Lv et al., where most of the devices achieved an average PCE of 11.3%. For the stability test at room temperature for 7 days with the devices kept in the dark, the unsealed devices based on pristine HTMs 50 and 51 suffered only 0.2% and 0.9% drops in their initial PCEs, respectively, which showed that these devices were quite stable.
In other work conducted by Choi and co-workers, a vinyl chain was adopted as a central unit to form HTM 52, with two units of N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenyl, while forming HTM 53 with four units of N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenyl moiety (Fig. 16). The dihedral angle between the vinyl and phenyl unit in HTM 52 and 53 are 4.3° and 22.3°, respectively, which explains why HTM 53 is more twisted than HTM 52, and is due to the steric hindrance of the peripheral substituents. Thus, the absorption of HTM 53 was blue-shifted about 33 nm relative to HTM 52, which has an absorption centered at 403 nm, with moderate molar absorptivity of 4.96 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Both HTMs 52 and 53 have an identical optical bandgap of 2.80 eV and their respective hole mobilities are 2.24 × 10−5 and 4.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, as calculated from the Mott–Gurney equation.
Observation from the device performances, as represented in Table 9, showed that devices employing Li-TFSI- and TBP-doped HTM 53 achieved remarkable improvements over the best device based on doped HTM 52. Nevertheless, devices with doped HTM 52 displayed high VOC exceeding 1.00 V, which is 80 mV higher than devices with doped HTM 53 (VOC = 0.93 V), due to HTM 52 having a HOMO level about 170 mV lower than HTM 53, which facilitates good pathways for efficient hole transport from the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. Devices with doped HTM 53 exhibited lower series resistance, RS, of 19.3 Ω cm−2 as compared to devices with doped HTM 50, which showed larger RS of 31.8 Ω cm−2 and hence a reduced device photocurrent, JSC. Under a long-term aging test for 200 hours, devices based on HTM 53 showed a 43.1% reduction from their initial PCE value, while devices based on HTM 52 suffered about a 36.4% decrease in their initial PCE value. This shows how HTM 52, with an interfacial tight packing arrangement, benefits from the small deviation it its structural planarity, which protects the perovskite layer from degradation much better than HTM 53, which consists of bulky side substitution moieties.
In Zhu et al.'s and Wang et al.'s research works, similar vinyl spacers were used to synthesis HTMs 54–57, with 4,4′-biphenyl as the core and N,N-di(4-methylphenyl)aminophenyl as the terminal, through elongation of the linear π-conjugation length via adding vinyl spacers. Wang et al. suggested that these small-molecule-sized HTMs could work as good pore fillers into the TiO2 layer. Besides, the propeller-like triphenylamine terminals of the linear conjugated HTMs could be used to prevent close contact between the MAPbI3 perovskite with HTMs, in order to reduce charge recombination and electronic coupling. The extension of the π-conjugation system caused HTMs 54–57 to undergo a red-shifted absorption from 412, 423, and 436 nm to 451 nm following the addition of vinyl spacers in the macromolecule backbones. Moreover, Tg also increased gradually from HTM 54 (98 °C), to 55 (102 °C), and 56 (164 °C), and subsequently reduces to 158 °C for HTM 57. These HTMs have good thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature in the range of 367–447 °C, which it is believed protects the MAPbI3 perovskite from degradation.
HTMs 54–57 also showed suitable EHOMO levels in the range of −4.90 to −5.00 eV, which is relatively higher than the case for the MAPbI3 perovskite (EHOMO = −5.43 eV) energy levels but lower than Au's work function of −5.10 eV. This creates an environment for effective hole transition from dissociation of the photogenerated carriers at the perovskite layer to the counter electrode via smooth charge transfer facilitated by HTMs 54–57. According to the TOF transient hole-current measurements, the calculated hole mobility decrease in the order: HTM 54 (2.73 × 10−4) > 55 (1.09 × 10−4) > 56 (8.39 × 10−5) > 57 (6.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that extension of the π-conjugation length through the addition of vinyl spacers could retard the charge carrier transportation.
Among HTMs 54–57, devices with pristine HTM 55 yielded the highest PCE of 13.0%, together with superior VOC and FF values, compared to the other vinyl-linked HTMs. Meanwhile, devices using pristine HTM 57 achieved the lowest PCE of 11.2% as a result of the poor solubility and low volume ratio of HTM 57, which causes incomplete coverage on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface and thus leads to rapid charge recombination. The HTM-free devices achieved a PCE of 9.0%, and the device efficiency was further improved by about 3–4% through the incorporation of HTMs 54–57. The device efficiency of devices based on undoped HTMs 54–57 were reported to be reproducible, with PCE values in the range of 11.0–11.5%. However, the addition of ionic additives into HTMs 54–57 did not yield any significant results and these devices function differently to devices with doped HTM Sp01, which underwent a PCE enhancement from 11.5% to 13.2%. For the stability test, the unsealed devices were kept in a desiccator at ambient temperature for 900 hours and tested for 5 days continuously. All the devices based on pristine HTMs 54–57 managed to retain over 90% of their initial photovoltaic parameters, implying that these devices have promising long-term stability at room temperature.

Work on designing and modifying new types of HTMs for meso-structured PSCs is still in progress. Current research has focused on utilizing a planar core to form new HTMs by employing N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine as the terminal in order to synthesize new materials that mimic the structure as HTM Sp01. Jeon and co-workers substituted the pyrene core with mono-, tri-, and tetra-N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine moieties into HTMs 58, 59, and 60, respectively (Fig. 17). The addition of N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine moieties into the pyrene core results in the HTMs possessing a trend of a red-shifted absorption from 420, to 470, and 492 nm, due to the donating effect of the substituents, which increases the electron density in the pyrene core. The HOMO level of HTMs 58–60 shifted higher from −5.41 to −5.25 up to −5.11 eV, as more N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine units substitute the pyrene core. Their energy level diagrams are given in Fig. 18.

The free-HTM devices in Jeon et al.'s work achieved a JSC of 17.7 mA cm−1, a VOC of 0.80 V, and an FF of 56.5%, driving the PCE to 8.0%. Devices with doped HTMs 59 and 60 managed to improve their photovoltaic parameters but devices with doped HTM 58 exhibited contrary results. Devices based on doped HTM 58 with a mono di-p-methoxyphenylamine substituent yielded poor performance, with a PCE gain of 3.30%, where it suffered from an insufficient driving force for hole injection due to the small offset of EHOMO between HTM 58 and the MAPbI3 perovskite layer. Devices based on HTM 60 with three units of di-p-methoxyphenylamine substituents possessed a larger fill factor (FF = 69.0%) and achieved a higher PCE (12.4%) than that of HTMs 58 and 59, owing to the low series resistance possessed by the HTM 60 film in the device. Jeon et al. also realized that devices employing doped HTM Sp01 with a thickness of about 180 nm performed much better than devices based on HTM Sp01 with a thinner thickness of about 70 nm, whereby the device efficiency increased about 20% from 10.3% to 12.7%. Increasing the thickness of HTM Sp01 results in a significant improvement of VOC, which could be attributed to the effective movement of carriers from the HOMO level of HTM Sp01 to the cobalt-based dopant, which subsequently lowers the Fermi level to the HOMO level of HTM Sp01 (ref. 65) for efficient hole transport from the perovskite light harvester to the counter electrodes.
Nishimura and co-workers incorporated partially oxygen-bridged triphenylamine as a terminal with a planar azulene core to synthesize HTMs 61–63 and with a biphenyl core to form HTM 64 (Fig. 19), respectively. The partially oxygen-bridged triphenylamine terminal worked as a quasiplanar scaffold to facilitate delocalized π-conjugation and ensured a high carrier mobility in the π-stacking direction, while the azulene core exhibited unique electron-donating and -accepting behavior. HTM 61, which represents the 1,3,5,7-tetrasubstituted azulene compound, displayed three weak and broad absorptions at 392, 446, and 705 nm. 1,3-Substitution at the five member ring of azulene (HTM 62) exhibited two absorption maxima at 386 and 613 nm while the 5,7-substituted seven member ring of azulene (HTM 63) absorbed at 392, 644, and 717 nm, owing to the intramolecular charge-transfer transition of the azulene core. Meanwhile, the tetrasubstituted biphenyl core (HTM 64) displayed two UV-range absorptions at 383 and 316 nm. The hole mobilities decreased in the order: HTMs 61 (2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 62 (7.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 64 (2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) > 63 (6.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). This also shows that only HTM 61 had a comparable hole mobility as HTM Sp01 (2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).
In comparing the performance of the devices, devices utilizing doped HTM 61 had photovoltaic properties far better than devices with doped HTM 64, owing to the unique properties of the azulene core. Devices with doped HTM 61 yielded a JSC exceeding 20.0 mA cm−2, a VOC larger than 1.00 V, and a fill factor of 73.0%, contributing to a PCE of 15.7%. Meanwhile, devices employing doped HTM 64 suffered from a poor PCE of nearly 0.5% due to the weak photovoltaic properties (JSC = 2.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.70 V, FF = 28.0%) and high series resistance, RS, of 180 Ω cm2. Di-substitution of the partially oxygen-bridged triphenylamine units, either on five member rings or seven member rings, in the azulene-core-based HTMs 62 and 63, respectively, lead to a device efficiency of at least 8.5% and showed a moderate shunt resistance, RSh, of two orders of magnitude higher. Their RSh values were, however, an order of magnitude lower than their superior azulene derivatives (HTM 61 and HTM Sp01), indicating that there were greater power losses in the devices with HTMs 62 and 63, where the poor quality film affected the fill factor.
Nishimura and co-workers also noticed that changing the deposition method of the perovskite layer from sequential spin-coating to a modified one-step solution with toluene dropping during the coating was beneficial to increase the photovoltaic properties, where devices with doped HTM 61 achieved an improvement of PCE from 15.7% to 16.5%, together with enhanced JSC and VOC values. The devices based on doped HTM 61 performed much better than devices utilizing doped HTM Sp01, with a PCE of 13.6%.
In other research work reported by Lim et al., two star-shaped HTMs were introduced by using a triazine core and terminal N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine, with fluorenes and indeno[1,2-b] thiophenes as the linkers, to form HTMs 65 and 66, respectively (Fig. 20). Both HTMs 65 and 66 in chlorobenzene solution displayed moderate absorption maxima in the visible region corresponding to 546 nm (7.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and 574 nm (9.40 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The absorption of HTM 66 was red-shifted about 28 nm more than HTM 65, due to the insertion of the electron-rich thiophene in the indeno[1,2-b] thiophene moiety. These HTMs had identical HOMO level, which were relatively higher than the HOMO level of the MAPbI3 perovskite absorber (EHOMO = −5.43 eV), which provides compatible energy levels for efficient hole transport from the perovskite layer to the counter electrode. HTMs 65 and 66 showed high thermal stability up to 402 °C and 431 °C, respectively. Their calculated conductivities were 3.40 × 10−4 and 4.35 × 10−4 S cm−1 for the corresponding HTMs 65 and 66, which were higher than the conductivity of HTM Sp01 (σ = 3.03 × 10−4 S cm−1).
For more than 20 tested devices employing doped HTMs 65 and 66, the average device of doped HTM 65 achieved a JSC of 20.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of about 0.95 V, and an FF of 64.1%, leading to a device efficiency of 12.3%. Meanwhile, the average device with doped HTM 66 had better photovoltaic properties than that of the average device with doped HTM 65, with a better PCE offset of 0.6%, as a result of the incorporation of highly conductive indeno[1,2-b] thiophene spacers in HTM 66, which provided better efficiency for hole transport. The best device with doped HTM 66 had a certified PCE of 13.2%, which was comparable to that of the standard device with doped HTM Sp01 (PCE = 13.8%).
In addition, Krishna and co-workers synthesized a triptycene core with terminal N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine (HTM 67), N,N-dimethoxytriphenylamine (HTM 68), and 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-[4-(thiophene-2-yl)phenyl]aniline (HTM 70) as new HTMs for meso-structured PSCs (Fig. 21). The simple triptycene-core-based HTM 67 absorbed at 305 nm and had an extended π-conjugation system on the triptycene core with N,N-dimethoxytriphenylamine, which caused HTM 68 to shift to a longer wavelength of 340 nm. Meanwhile, extension of the π-conjugation via the addition of a thiophene ring in between the triptycene core and terminal N,N-dimethoxytriphenylamine of HTM 69 caused a further red-shift of the absorption to 390 nm. These HTMs possessed excellent electrochemical stability and good thermal stability, with Tg for the respective HTMs 67–69 of 120 °C, 140 °C, and 108 °C. These variations of the Tg value are attributed to the subtle interplay between the twisted bulky side groups and the rigid triptycene core.
In Krishna et al.'s work, the HTM-free devices suffered from poor performance, achieving a PCE of about 4.7%, with a JSC of 10.6 mA cm−1, a VOC of 0.84 V, and an FF of 52.5%. This shows that the integration of an HTM into a device fabrication is necessary to obtain a high PCE. Upon the addition of FK102-doped HTM 67, the PCE of the devices improved from 4.7% to 8.4%. The device efficiency can be further improved to more than 12.0% through the extended π-conjugation on the triptycene-core-based HTMs 68 and 69. Due to the presence of an electron-rich thiophene as the spacer in HTM 69, a higher conductivity and short-circuit current (JSC) can be achieved, whereby devices based on doped HTM 69 had a PCE offset about 0.2% better than devices with doped HTM 68. Moreover, devices with doped HTMs 67–69 displayed a similar pattern of IPCE curves, suggesting that the HTMs absorption has a negligible effect on the photovoltaic properties. The integrated JSC obtained from the IPCE spectra are well matched with the JSC from the I–V measurement. Comparing the fill factors, the low resistance of doped HTM 68 resulted in a higher FF value than for the devices based on its doped HTM 69 and Sp01 counterparts.
In the recent work of Bi et al. and Xu et al., the spiro[fluoro-9,9′-xanthene] core was combined with a terminal N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine to yield HTMs 70 and 71 (Fig. 22). Due to the smaller steric hindrance possessed by the unsubstituted xanthene, the torsion angle between the fluorene and xanthene in the spiro[fluoro-9,9′-xanthene] core was slightly smaller (87.51°) than in the HTM Sp01 (89.94°). A perpendicular arrangement of the ‘spiro’ conformation is beneficial for the solubility enhancement of the HTMs. Both HTMs 70 and 71 displayed similar absorptions at about 308 and 388 nm as well as an identical HOMO level at −5.15 eV, showing that the numbers of N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine substitution on spiro[fluoro-9,9′-xanthene] core did not much tailor the optical and electrochemical properties of the HTMs. However, HTM 71 (1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) with four N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine moieties exhibited a hole mobility of an order of magnitude higher than that of HTM 70 (5.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) substituted with two N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine and HTM Sp01 (8.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).
According to Maciejczyk et al., the energy levels of the spiro[fluoro-9,9′-xanthene]-core-based HTMs can be tuned through variation of the terminal moieties on the core. The spiro[fluoro-9,9′-xanthene]-core terminated with diphenylamine, carbazole, and phenothiazine groups have poor solubility characteristics due to their strong intermolecular interaction, and this also highlights that the presence of a methoxy group in the N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine moiety is essential for solution processability of the HTM. The device architecture of mesoporous alumina, such as ETL, the MAPb3−xClx perovskite absorber, and doped HTM 71, yielded a moderate PCE of 12.4%, with a JSC of 21.4 mA cm−1, a VOC of 0.98 V, and an FF of 59.0%.
Remarkable device efficiencies reaching up to 20.0% were reported by Bi et al. and Xu et al. when they incorporated 3 mol% FK209-doped HTM 70 and HTM 71 into a modulated ratio of perovskite complexes consisting of PbI2:PbBr2(85:15), PbI2:FAI(1.05), and PbBr2:MABr(1:1). Both devices based on doped HTMs 70 and 71 displayed a high JSC of at least 23.0 mA cm−1, a VOC exceeding 1.1 V, and an FF gain of no lower than 70.0%. Their PCE achievements are comparable to the standard devices based on doped HTM Sp01 under the same conditions (PCE = 20.8%). Moreover, devices adopting HTM 70 and 71 exhibited minimized hysteresis and good reproducible PCE values.
There are some interesting findings in the research work conducted by Cao and co-workers regarding the employment of thiolated nanographene as an HTM in the meso-structured PSCs. They functionalized a nanographene core with 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzenethiol, 4-tert-butylbenzenethiol, and benzenethiol moieties to form HTMs 72, 73, and 74, respectively (Fig. 23). The nanographene core with a benzenethiol moiety, HTM 74, had a comparable HOMO level as the MAPbI3 perovskite light harvester, with a hole mobility of 4.03 × 10−15 cm2 V−1 s−1. Functionalized thiolated nanographene with an electronegative trifluoromethyl moiety (HTM 72) had a lower HOMO level by about 0.27 eV relative to the perovskite absorber but with improved hole mobility of 6.57 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, the incorporation of a bulky substituent, the tert-butyl, on the benzenethiol moiety of HTM 73 gave a relatively higher HOMO level of about 0.16 eV higher than that of the perovskite absorber and exhibited a hole mobility of 1.76 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. The calculated hole mobilities of the thiolated nanographenes (HTMs 72–74), however, are several orders of magnitudes far behind those of pristine HTM Sp01.
As reported by Cao et al., the free-HTM devices achieved a PCE of 8.1% but devices based on pristine HTM 72 obtained poor device performances, with PCEs of 6.1% as hole transport was hindered from the perovskite absorber to HTM 72, due to the HOMO level of HTM 72 being lower than that of the VBM level of the perovskite layer. The devices based on a higher HOMO level of HTM 73 and 74 relative to the perovskite absorber were reported to have a certified PCE of more than 12.0%. The PCEs of the devices with pristine HTM 74 were further improved from 12.8% to 14.0% after graphene was added into the HTM. This shows that graphene can be used as an alternative to replace the ionic additives like TBP and Li-TFSI to enhance the photovoltaic properties of the meso-structured PSCs. The photovoltaic performances of the devices based on miscellaneous core type HTMs are summarized in Table 10.

The materials cost model of the synthesized hole-transporting materials (HTMs) were calculated based on the work conducted by Osedach et al. The quantitative analysis of the synthesized HTMs is adopted from published small-scale synthetic methods to estimate the materials cost of the HTMs when produced on a large scale. The materials cost are determined in US dollars-per-gram, where the amounts of reactants, catalysts, solvents, and reagents employed in each synthesis step are calculated to yield 1 g of the final product. The starting materials, reagents, and solvents required are quoted in bulk quantities (up to a kilogram if possible) from commercial chemical suppliers, such as Sigma Aldrich, TCI Chemicals, and Alfa Aesar. Descriptions of the materials cost model calculations for the synthesized HTMs are well documented in the papers reported by Osedach et al. and Petrus et al. The flowchart describing the synthesis of 1 g of HTMs, together with their quantities of input reagents, solvents, and work-up materials, are represented in the ESI (Fig. S1–S36).

Among 36 synthesized HTMs where their materials cost have been calculated, including the work-up materials cost, about one-third (15 HTMs) of the calculated HTMs were cheaper than the materials cost for spiro-OMeTAD (HTM Sp01), although it involved multiple synthesis steps (Fig. 24). The increment of materials cost for the synthesized HTMs were mainly driven by the work-up materials cost, which involved purification through column chromatography, which consumed a lot of solvents and silica gel 60 in order to obtain high purity HTMs. Meanwhile, some of the synthesized HTMs required more input materials due to a low percentage of yields, which subsequently increased the materials cost, such as for example HTM 44, where two of its synthesis steps yielded targeted compounds with less than 32% yields. Thus, optimization of the starting materials synthesis is essential to reduce materials cost and so as to obtain an economic HTM.
Based on Table 11, a single-step synthesis of HTM Sp01 requires input reagents about four times more expensive than the work-up materials cost, where the 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] core and terminal 4,4-dimethoxydiphenylamine account for nearly 78% of the total materials cost. Meanwhile, other types of HTMs required cheaper input reagents to synthesize planar and π-extended core systems, but the increasing synthetic complexity directly raised the cost per gram (Cg) via work-up materials costs. The estimation cost-per-peak Watt (Cw) as a function of PSC efficiency was calculated based on the following equation:
where
η and I represent the corresponding efficiency of the solar cell and solar insolation under peak conditions, which was assumed to be 1000 W m−2. Meanwhile, Cg is the cost per gram for HTMs with a density (p) of 1 g cm−3, applied as a thick film of thickness (t) about 100 nm on a PSC cell, with assumption that there is no loss of HTM materials during the fabrication.

For a meso-structured PSC with a PCE of 15.2%, a single-step synthesis of HTM Sp01 accounts for a cost of 0.18 $ per Wp. The modification of HTM Sp03 with ortho-substituents accounts for an additional 0.005 $ per Wp than HTM Sp01 and yielded the devices with a PCE of 16.7%. HTM 41, which required 11 synthesis steps, was found to involve a cost of 0.473 $ per Wp while the low synthesis yields of HTM 44 (4 synthesis steps) on the contrary involved a cost of nearly 1.00 $ per Wp. These results suggest that careful selection of the efficient synthetic routes, optimization of the starting materials, and minimizing the synthesis procedures have to be put into consideration for producing economic and scalable PSC devices. Our findings also found that more than one-sixth of the synthesized HTMs (HTMs 26, 31, 43, 52, 53, 60, 70, and 71) involved a cost cheaper than 0.180 $ per Wp, which represents the Cw benchmark of HTM Sp01. Thus, these HTMs can be considered as easily processable and low-cost HTMs with comparable device performance to HTM Sp01.

From the reviews of the abundant research papers done by researchers and academicians regarding the synthesis and development of new types of HTMs based on small organic molecules in meso-structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs), HTM-free PSCs on average yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of no more than 14.5%, and where the PCE achievements varied depending on the methods adopted to deposit the perovskite film, as well as the thickness optimization of the electron-transporting layer (ETL) and the perovskite photodetector interlayer, the crystallization morphology of the perovskite film, etc. Moreover, the infusion of hole-transporting materials (HTM) is essential to complete the meso-structured PSCs by assisting the perovskite absorber in gaining more photocurrent, to subsequently enhance the efficiency of the light-to-electricity conversion of PSCs.

The incorporation of ionic additives, such as Li-TFSI and TBP, may help to induce the conductivity of the HTMs, which can subsequently improve the photovoltaic parameters of the meso-structured PSCs. The addition of 1 mol% to 15 mol% of p-type dopants, such as Co-complexes, after the ionic additives into HTMs will further improve the photoelectric efficiency to some extent, before the photovoltaic performances gradually drop after an infusion of more than 15 mol% of the p-type dopants. However, the insertion of ionic additives and p-type dopants for improving the photovoltaic properties of PSCs are not beneficial to some of the new synthesized HTMs, where some devices gave contrary results, and this phenomenon is still unclear and needs further investigation. As most of the PSCs employed spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, they had superior performances due to the conductivity enhancement from the ionic additives and p-dopants assistance, but this indirectly causes erosion of the device stability and a shorter lifetime, owing to the porous layer of doped HTM accelerating degradation of the perovskite light harvester layer.
Moreover, some of new synthesized and pristine HTMs have comparable or better performance and longer device lifetimes as compared to that of doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. These new HTMs achieving superior device performances relative to the standard HTM spiro-OMeTAD are molecular structure that consist of electron-rich or electron-donating functional groups, such as thiophenes, a fused planar core structure, and extended π-conjugation lengths, which permit the HTMs high intrinsic conductivity as well as high hole mobility without much relying on the outsourced dopants. The advantages of π–π stacking during the film formation of HTMs may be beneficial for providing a much smoother and high quality film to improve the fill factor and device performance besides prolonging the device lifetime.
For future outlooks, new designs on asymmetric organic small molecules, such as HTMs for PSCs, may be beneficial for prolonging the device lifetime. The asymmetric HTM is expected to have a higher thermal stability and this will subsequently increase the cell resistance toward the thermal stress that occurs during light irradiation. The asymmetrical structure of HTM also works to suppress the crystal growth behavior that is usually encountered in symmetric HTMs, which has been found to be responsible for degradation of the perovskite absorber due to the poor contact being inhibited by the crystallized-HTM with the perovskite photodetector. We hope that this review may contribute some insights on the design and development of new HTMs based on small organic molecules for the better performance and stability of PSCs.
