Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are a promising technology for indoor low-energy-consumption portable electronic equipment. However, the relatively large voltage loss (Vloss) of OPVs, typically exceeding 0.6 V, limits their application. Here, we develop a wide bandgap (WBG) two-dimensional (2D) linear polymer PE6 with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) backbone structure, where 4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-tripropylsilyl-thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T-SiCl), thienothiophene (TT) and benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) are used as the D, π and A units, respectively. PE6 achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.09% when blended with a narrow-bandgap acceptor Y6 (Eg = 1.33 eV), which is one of the highest values in BTA-based photovoltaic polymers. In addition, using classic IT-M (a medium-bandgap acceptor, Eg = 1.60 eV) and BTA3 (a wide-bandgap acceptor, Eg = 1.82 eV) as acceptors, PE6-based OPVs exhibit a high VOC of 1.032 V and 1.292 V, respectively. Notably, the Vloss in the three combinations is in the range of 0.54∼0.57 V, and the non-radiative voltage loss in the PE6:BTA3 blend is as low as 0.158 V. Therefore, our results indicate that introducing both silicon and chlorine atoms simultaneously on the 2D conjugated side chain is effective to design photovoltaic polymers with decreasing Vloss. In addition, PE6 has the potential as a standard polymer to pair with different types of newly developed non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are constructed with the device structure of an active layer sandwiched between two electrodes, where p-type and n-type semiconductors are used as the electron donor and acceptor respectively. OPVs have numerous advantages, such as the absorption range that can be finetuned to match different light sources, and the possibility to fabricate large-area, flexible and semi-transparent devices. These features make OPVs particularly suitable for incorporation into indoor low-energy-consumption portable electronic equipment. With the continuous development of new photovoltaic materials and device engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction OPVs based on polymer:non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has exceeded 18%. In terms of the three important parameters of OPVs, the short-circuit current density (JSC) has reached 28 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) exceeds 80%, but the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is usually limited to below 0.9 V. Compared with perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the VOC of OPVs is the least among the three parameters mainly because of the larger voltage loss (Vloss) of organic materials, typically exceeding 0.6 V.

To meet the needs of different application scenarios and the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), NFAs with different optoelectronic properties have been synthesized. Narrow-bandgap materials such as Y6, BTP-eC9, Y6-1O, etc. are widely used in high-efficiency devices, and medium/wide-bandgap NFAs represented by BTA3, F-BTA3, ITCC, IOC-Cl, etc. are commonly used in high-voltage systems. Thus, it is challenging to design universal donors that can realize a low Vloss in both high PCE and high VOC systems, which will help to understand the structure–property–Vloss relationship. In principle, this kind of polymer needs to possess suitable energy levels, an efficient driving force for charge separation, a high quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) for suppressed Vloss and suitable miscibility with a variety of acceptors.
Compared with homopolymer donors such as MEH-PPV and P3HT, the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type copolymers attracted more attention because of the strong intramolecular charge transfer, tunable absorption spectra and energy levels. Among numerous electron-accepting (A) units, benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) is an important one and has been widely used to construct high performance p-type polymers, especially for J-series polymers containing benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the D unit and thiophene as the π bridge respectively. Furthermore, with the introduction of heteroatoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, silicon and sulfur, on the thiophene conjugated side chain of the BDT unit, the energy levels can be effectively downshifted and the non-radiative recombination can be inhibited. Regarding the linker between D and A units, we found that by changing thiophene to thienothiophene (TT), the polymer backbone could be tuned from a curved to a linear structure. The change of π bridge type can increase the crystallinity and hole mobility of D–π–A polymer, and thus largely improve the PCEs. As a result of these polymer modifications, BTA-based polymers have realized the highest PCEs beyond 14%.
In this manuscript, we adopt a linear backbone, where 4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-tripropylsilyl-thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T-SiCl), hexylthienothiophene and BTA are used as the D, π and A units respectively. By simultaneously introducing silicon and chlorine atoms on the side chain, we finally got a wide-bandgap (1.98 eV) polymer PE6 with a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.53 eV. To verify the generalizability of decreasing the Vloss, PE6 is utilized to combine with three classic NFAs, narrow-bandgap Y6 (Eg = 1.33 eV), medium-bandgap IT-M (Eg = 1.60 eV) and wide-bandgap BTA3 (Eg = 1.82 eV) respectively. We obtained a stepwise increase in VOC in the order of 0.863, 1.032 and 1.292 V, with low voltage losses of 0.543, 0.570 and 0.540 V, respectively. Notably, the PE6:Y6 and PE6:BTA3 combinations achieved the highest PCE (15.09%) and the highest VOC (1.292 V) respectively of the reported BTA-based photovoltaic polymers (summarized in Fig. 1 and Table S1). Our results prove that the WBG polymer PE6 can be used as a standard polymer in a variety of NFA systems.

The detailed polymerization and extraction processes of PE6 are described in the ESI and the synthesis route is shown in Scheme S1.PE6 has an ability for the subsequent solution-process fabrication because of its high solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of PE6 measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) are 42.3 and 122.5 kDa respectively with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.90, as shown in Fig. S1.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption of PE6 and three acceptors in neat and blend films is tested to show the range of response to light (Fig. 2 and S2). PE6 exhibits a defined absorption profile with a (0–1) transition peak at about 544 nm and a (0–0) transition peak at about 582 nm in the film, indicating that ordered and strong π–π stacking interaction formed in the solid state, which will improve hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of blend devices. The optical bandgap Eg of PE6 is 1.98 eV calculated by using the absorption edge of a neat film at 630 nm. The detailed optical data of PE6 are shown in Table S3, together with PE4 for comparison. The blend film absorption profile demonstrates that PE6 is well complementary with three acceptors Y6, IT-M and BTA3 in the wavelength range of 400–930, 400–780 and 400–700 nm, respectively, which is beneficial for light harvesting in various wavelength ranges based on the non-fullerene OPVs.
The HOMO energy level (EHOMO) was calculated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) according to the equations of EHOMO = −e(φox + 4.8 − φFc/Fc+). The onset oxidation potential (φox) of PE6 is 1.18 V, so the EHOMO equals −5.53 eV. The lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy ELUMO equals −3.55 eV calculated by EHOMO plusing Eoptg (Fig. 2c and S2b). Compared to its analogue polymer PE4 (ref. 53) without a silicon atom, the EHOMO/ELUMO level of PE6 is 0.11/0.06 eV deeper than that of PE4 with an alkyl substituent (EHOMO/LUMO = −5.42/−3.49 eV) and benefits from the σ*(Si)–π*(C) bond interaction of the alkylsilyl substitution. Therefore, it is possible for PE6 to match with a variety of classical acceptor materials, and show good performance in each system.
The density functional theory (DFT) results of PE6 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level is shown in Fig. 3, and the top and side views show that PE6 with TT as the π-bridge adopts a linear backbone conformation and the alkylsilyl substitution has tiny effects on the conformation. A slight twist in the backbone of PE6 is mainly due to a dihedral angle of 26.6 and 31.9° between the π spacer and the adjacent BTA unit caused by the hindrance of the alkyl chain on the TT π bridge. Overall, TT π bridges promote the linear-planar backbone structure of PE6, facilitating the formation of ordered molecular packing and improvement of crystallinity, which are basic prerequisites for excellent charge transfer and restricted recombination. The calculated EHOMO/LUMO level by using ideal DFT calculation is −4.91 and −2.50 eV, which is slightly different from the CV results.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the three material combinations, we fabricated OPV devices with the traditional device structure. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices. The optimal photovoltaic data are shown in Table 1. Excitingly, the PE6:Y6 combination realizes the highest PCE of 15.09%, with a low VOC of 0.863 V, the highest JSC of 25.07 mA cm2 and an FF of 69.16%. The best result is partially attributed to the strong and broad absorption spectrum, sufficient energy offset and excellent electron mobility of Y6, while the deep reasons will be explained later. Owing to the medium bandgap of IT-M and less ordered stacking of the blend film, PE6:IT-M exhibited a slightly improved VOC of 1.032 V, a reduced JSC of 13.75 mA cm−2, an FF of 60.67% and a PCE of 8.61%. The VOC is further increased to 1.292 V with a wide bandgap of BTA3 with slightly decreased JSC, FF, PCE to 10.44 mA cm−2, 58.43% and 7.88%. In addition, we also tested other non-fullerenes according to their bandgaps, including BTP-eC9, Y6-1O, IT-4F and F-BTA3. The photovoltaic data are provided in Table S3. Obviously, these materials show a similar tendency to Y6, IT-M and BTA3.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integral current curves of the three devices are shown in Fig. 4b. The device based on PE6:Y6 achieves the highest JSC owing to the broad and high photon response in the range of 300–930 nm. Compared to the high and broad photocurrent response of Y6-based OPVs, the maximum EQE values of IT-M and BTA3-based device reduced to 65% and 58%, leading to lower JSC. This narrow EQE of IT-M and BTA3-based devices can be mainly attributed to the narrow absorption in the active layer because Y6 (1.07 × 105 cm−1 at 821 nm), IT-M (1.3 × 105 cm−1 at 700 nm) and BTA3 (1.14 × 105 cm−1 at 613 nm) have similar extinction coefficients. The decreased EQE in the range of 350–750 nm for the BTA3-based device and 350–800 nm for the IT-M-based device partially originates from the decreased absorption of the blend layer induced by the thickness. The influence of charge-carrier mobility and recombination loss on EQE will be explained later. The integrated current calculated from the EQE is in good agreement with the JSC obtained from the J–V curve. The hole and electron mobilities are estimated in the dark by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method to be 2.08 × 10−4/1.04 × 10−4, 8.36 × 10−5/4.67 × 10−6 and 9.86 × 10−5/7.40 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PE6:Y6, PE6:IT-M and PE6:BTA3 blends, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). The higher and balanced carrier mobility can effectively reduce the non-geminate recombination, also resulting in higher FF in the PE6:Y6 device. The reason for different photovoltaic performance parameters among the three devices will be further discussed in the following sections.
To investigate the effects of recombination behaviors on FF in the three devices, we measured the dependence of JSC and VOC on various illumination intensities (Plight). In Fig. 5a, the exponential factor of α is 0.967, 0.956 and 0.924 for Y6, IT-M and BTA3, respectively, indicating that the more severe bimolecular recombination occurred sequentially because the value of α gradually deviates from 1 in the order of PE6:Y6/IT-M/BTA3. Moreover, slopes (βs) of dependence of VOC on log(Plight) are 1.08 kT/q, 1.03 kT/q and 1.27 kT/q for PE6:Y6, PE6:IT-M and PE6:BTA3 (Fig. 5b), illustrating that the coexistence of bimolecular recombination and monomolecular recombination resulted in lower FF values in IT-M and BTA3 devices. This result is consistent with the test result of carrier mobility, which together explain the difference in FF values.
The maximum exciton generation rate Gmax and charge dissociation probability P(E,T) were also calculated to study the exciton behaviors by measuring Jph (photocurrent density) ∼Veff (effective voltage) (Fig. 5c and d). The Gmax values of Y6, IT-M and BTA3-based devices are 1.29 × 1027, 7.46 × 1026 and 4.87 × 1026 m−3 s−1, which is related to the broader photon absorbance range and high EQE response. Furthermore, the P(E,T) values calculated by Jph/Jsat are 96.6%, 83.1%, and 99.0% for the three blends, in which Jph is the current density under the short-circuit condition and Jsat is the saturated photo-generated current density which can directly reflect the number of absorbed photons. The highest Gmax and relatively high P(E,T) reveal an efficient exciton dissociation and collection process, and thus increased JSC in PE6:Y6. And the high P(E,T) value of 99% may be related to the high charge-transfer state (CT) in PE6:BTA3 to enhance the formation of exciton dissociated states and reduce geminate recombination. Compared with PE6:IT-M, the highest P(E,T) value of PE6:BTA3 also elucidated that PE6 could maintain JSC while further boosting VOC in PE6:BTA3 system. Indeed, the lowest exciton generation rate still inhibited the enhancement of JSC and the FF value in PE6:BTA3.
Apart from the reasons that the three acceptors have different LUMO energy levels, the various part voltage loss of the three systems is also worth studying, especially for PE6:BTA3. Therefore, electroluminescence (EL) spectroscopy was carried out to determine ΔV1, ΔV2 and ΔV3 on the basis of the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit theory. The three parts of voltage loss could be expressed as:
The related data are shown in Table 2. The three devices exhibited different Eg values of 1.419, 1.658 and 1.832 eV, and ECT values of 1.36, 1.60 and 1.72 eV for the PE6:Y6, PE6:IT-M and PE6:BTA3 devices because of the different bandgaps (Fig. 6a–c). Due to the limitation of the law of thermodynamics, ∼0.25 V or higher of ΔV1 is unavoidable for any type of solar cell. ΔV2 is the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap, and the smallest ΔV2 of PE6:IT-M revealed the restriction on the CT emission due to the smallest ΔECT, which is the difference between Eg–ECT. The last term ΔV3 is related to the non-radiative voltage loss, which can be calculated by using the formula: ΔV3 = KT/qln(EQEEL). As shown in Fig. 6d, PE6:Y6 and PE6:IT-M present the low EQEEL values of 2.21 × 10−4 and 4.97 × 10−5, which contributes to a relatively high ΔV3 of 0.218 and 0.256 V, respectively. PE6:BTA3 gives an increase in EQEEL up to 2.07 × 10−3, corresponding to the largely reduced ΔV3 of 0.158 V. PE6:IT-M exhibits the highest ΔV3 possibly related to the formation of non-emissive triplet excitons from IT-M, suppressing the efficiency of electroluminescence. Notably, the total voltage losses of PE6 in the three systems are in the range of 0.54–0.57 V, indicating that PE6 can achieve a relatively low voltage loss blended with different NFAs, which may be beneficial to the hybridization of the S1 state and CT state to reduce ΔV3.

It is noteworthy that PE6:BTA3 exhibited a larger energy level offset ΔECT (roughly defined as the difference between the Eg and ECT associated with the charge generation) (112 meV) than PE6:Y6 (59 meV) and PE6:IT-M (58 meV) with the PE6 donor polymer. A large number of NFA-based devices have already demonstrated that minimizing ΔECT is a universal potential way to reduce non-radiative loss. Here, PE6:Y6, PE6:IT-M and PE6:BTA3 with negligible ΔECT obtained a relatively low non-radiative loss, which is consistent with the observation by Nelson et al.PE6:BTA3 exhibited a larger ΔECT than the other two systems, but still showed larger EQEEL value. We attributed such a contrasting tendency to the too small ΔECT (<100 meV) in the PE6:Y6 and PE6:IT-M systems. Two possible reasons for the lowest non-radiative loss of PE6:BTA3 systems are presented as follows: one possibility is that the electronic coupling between the CT state and the first excited singlet state in PE6:BTA3 is larger than that of PE6:Y6 and PE6:IT-M as demonstrated by Nelson et al.; the other one is that there are long-lived species between the D/A interface in PE6:BTA3, which largely reduced the recombination loss. To explain the similar ΔECT with different ΔV3 in the PE6:Y6/IT-M blends, the Urbach energy (EU) has been obtained by exponential fitting of the sensitive EQE spectra in the sub-gap region. As shown in Fig. S3,PE6:Y6 exhibited lower energetic disorder with a EU value of 24.8 meV than that of PE6:IT-M (EU = 27.9 meV). Hence, the low energetic disorder dominated the reduced Vloss in a small ΔECT system, as well as efficient charge generation.
The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to study the effects of molecular aggregation and orientation on charge transport properties in the three devices. As shown in Fig. 7, PE6:Y6/IT-M/BTA3 show obvious π–π stacking peaks (010) located at 1.74, 1.70 and 1.73 Å−1 along the out-of-plane direction (qz) and lamellar peaks (100) located at 0.299, 0.315 and 0.327 Å−1 along the in-plane direction (qxy). We can speculate that PE6:Y6 and PE6:BTA3 blends dominated face-on orientation while PE6:IT-M exhibited face-on mixed with a small ratio of edge-on orientation because of arc-like scatterings (010). The sharp lamellar peak in PE6:BTA3 implies a relatively pure phase formed compared to PE6:Y6 and PE6:IT-M. Moreover, the smaller average π–π stacking distances of 3.61 and 3.62 Å indicated the shorter charge transfer distance in PE6:Y6 and PE6:BTA3 compared to 3.70 Å of PE6:IT-M. Generally, the crystallinity is related to the value of the π–π coherence lengths (LC), calculated by using the formula LC = 2πK/Δq (K = 1) and Δq is the fullwidth at half-maximum of a diffraction peak.LC of Y6, IT-M and BTA3-based blend films were 21.03, 10.19 and 12.65 Å, respectively. All the detailed data are shown in Table S4 . The results indicated that the ordered orientation and high-crystallinity morphology of PE6:Y6 were beneficial to get high JSC, and the other two blends got unpleasant JSCs due to weak molecular aggregation and undesirable orientation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are shown in Fig. S4; all the three systems show a well-mixed bulk structure and small difference in root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of the active layer.

In summary, a linear wide-bandgap polymer PE6 was synthesized and used to study the charge transfer, exciton generation and dissociation, and molecular ordering when blended with three NFAs Y6, IT-M and BTA3 with different bandgaps. The highest PCE of 15.09% was achieved for narrow-bandgap Y6 due to the widest absorption range, highest charge mobilities, inhibited recombination and more ordered molecular stacking. When using medium-bandgap IT-M and wide-bandgap BTA3 as acceptors, PE6-based OPVs can realize a high VOC of 1.032 V and 1.292 V respectively, but relatively low PCEs of 8.61% and 7.88%. The Vloss in the three acceptors are 0.54, 0.57 and 0.54 V, respectively, and the ΔV3 in the PE6:BTA3 blend is as low as 0.158 V due to the strongest EQEEL. Compared to most PM6-based single-junction devices with ΔV3 in the range of 200–350 mV, our results indicated that the linear wide bandgap BTA-based polymer PE6 with trialkylsilyl and chlorine substitution on the conjugated side chain is a versatile material that can be blended with various acceptors for low voltage loss OPV devices. To achieve a higher PCE, Vloss must be reduced with ΔV3 being the key focus to decrease. How to design donor and acceptor systems to simultaneously enhance the VOC and PCE needs to be considered in the future.
