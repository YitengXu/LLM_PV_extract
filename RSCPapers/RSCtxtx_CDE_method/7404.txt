We synthesized three soluble perinone isomers as electron transport materials in p–i–n perovskite solar cells. The cis-isomer BBIN-2 possesses higher LUMO level and electron mobility than the trans-isomers. The BBIN-2 devices showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 19.36%, demonstrating the potential of perinone dyes in perovskite solar cells.

In the past few decades, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great potential in the field of photovoltaics, with a simple device fabrication process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE), quickly rising from the original 3.8% in 2009 to 25.7% in 2022. Among them, the p–i–n PSCs (inverted PSCs) have received wide attention because of their various advantages, such as low-temperature solution processing capacity and low hysteresis effect. Meanwhile, the p–i–n PSCs also cater to the flexible devices and tandem devices.

Electron transport materials (ETMs) play a vital role in the electron extraction and transport. Fullerenes and their derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and C60, are the most commonly used ETMs in highly efficient p–i–n PSCs. Nevertheless, the shortcomings of fullerene derivatives, like high synthesis and purification costs, and inferior film morphology stability under heating conditions, arouse a powerful spur to the development of other non-fullerene ETMs. Naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, and hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA) derivatives have demonstrated great potential to achieve efficient and stable p–i–n PSCs. They are simple to synthesize, low cost, and have high thermal stability. However, there are still few highly efficient inverted PSCs based on non-fullerene ETMs.
Naphthalene tetracarboxylic acid bisbenzimidazoles, known as perinone dyes, are a typical n-type semiconductor. Perinone dyes and their derivatives have close LUMO levels to the NDI derivatives and have been successfully applied in the early bilayer heterojunction solar cells as acceptors. Because of their poor solubility in common organic solvents, perinone dyes are seldom used in the bulk heterojunction solar cells and have never been used in PSCs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel soluble perinone dye BBIN by introducing two long alkyl chains into the naphthalene core. Surprisingly, BBIN has three isomers and they have different optical and electrical properties. What's more, utilizing the cis-isomer (BBIN-2) as the ETM in p–i–n PSCs, a champion PCE of 19.36% is obtained, which is higher than that of PSCs with the trans-isomers and PC61BM.
The chemical structures and synthetic routes of BBIN series are shown in Fig. 1(a). The bisanhydride intermediate was converted into perinone dyes by condensation with 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diamine. Typically, the perinone dyes have two isomers (trans and cis) because of the different relative position of the two benzimidazole groups. Here, the introduction of alkyls in the naphthalene core divides the trans-isomer into two isomers, the isomer in which the alkyls are close to the carbonyls and the isomer in which the alkyls are close to the imidazole. Fortunately, the three isomers can be easily separated by silica gel column chromatography (Fig. S1, ESI). According to the collection order, we named the three isomers BBIN-1, BBIN-2, and BBIN-3, respectively. They were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS). As shown in Fig. 1(b), BBIN-2 can be easily identified to be the cis-isomer. The cis-isomer is asymmetric with six kinds of aromatic protons (chemical shift between 7.7 to 9.3) and two kinds of methylene protons (chemical shift between 3.7 to 3.9) connected to the aromatic ring. To confirm the exact structure of the two trans-isomers, the heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectrum of BBIN-1 was acquired (Fig. S2, ESI). The singlet peak signal at 9.19 ppm can be ascribed to the proton on naphthalene and the peak signal at 140.7 ppm can be ascribed to the carbon atom attached to the nitrogen atom by a double bond resonance. The carbon atom exhibits a strong coupling signal with the proton, so BBIN-1 is identified as the isomer in which the alkyls are close to the carbonyls. The remaining isomer is BBIN-3.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was first performed to examine the thermal stability of the three isomers. As shown in the TGA curves (Fig. S3, ESI), the three isomers all exhibit excellent thermal stability with a degradation temperature (Td, mass loss of 5%) over 390 °C. This shows that the introduction of alkyls has no influence on the thermal stability of perinone dyes and the BBIN series would have good thermal stability during device operation.
The optical properties of the three isomers were then examined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2(a), in chlorobenzene solution, the two trans-isomers BBIN-1 and BBIN-3 have similar absorption spectra with two peaks located at 455 nm and 480 nm. The absorption spectrum of the cis-isomer BBIN-2 exhibits two peaks located at 473 nm and 496 nm with a shoulder located at 550 nm. Obviously, BBIN-2 exhibits a larger red shift of absorption than BBIN-1 and BBIN-3. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Fig. S4, ESI) was used to explain the different absorption spectra. The less delocalized highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the cis-isomer BBIN-2 is responsible for the red-shifted absorption. Compared to the absorption spectra in solution, all the absorption spectra of the three isomers in a film exhibit a large red shift. According to the literature, the molecular arrangement and the direction of the transition dipoles are responsible for the different film absorption spectra of the trans-isomers and cis-isomer. The bathochromic shift indicates a strong π–π stacking in the film, which is propitious to charge transport. The absorption edge onset (λonset) of the BBIN-1, BBIN-2 and BBIN-3 films is 548 nm, 589 nm and 544 nm, respectively, corresponding to the optical bandgap of 2.26 eV, 2.11 eV, and 2.28 eV, respectively.
To study the effect of isomerization on molecular energy levels, we measured the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the three isomers by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using ferrocene as an internal standard (shown in Fig. 2(c)). Through the calculation of the CV curves and optical bandgap, it is not difficult to get the corresponding LUMO/HOMO energy levels, which were estimated to be −3.84/−6.10 eV for BBIN-1, −3.83/−5.94 eV for BBIN-2 and −3.85/−6.13 eV for BBIN-3, respectively. The CV curves of PC61BM were also tested and the LUMO level was estimated to be −3.89 eV (Fig. S5, ESI). It is obvious that the three isomers have a similar LUMO level to PC61BM, which means that they all have the potential of good electronic transport materials. Among them, the LUMO level of BBIN-2 is slightly higher, which helps the electron transfer process and effectively reduces energy loss, so as to increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and achieve the high performance of p–i–n PSCs (Fig. S6, ESI).
In addition, the charge mobility of the BBIN series was studied, and electron-only devices based on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/Al/ETM/Al structure were prepared. The electron mobility was estimated by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the electron mobility (μe) of BBIN-1, BBIN-2 and BBIN-3 was calculated to be 5.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, 1.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 1.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. The μe of all three isomers is high enough for the ETMs of the PSCs. It is also noteworthy that the cis-isomer BBIN-2 possesses a higher μe than that of the trans-isomers BBIN-1 and BBIN-3, which could be ascribed to the moderate crystallinity with uniform morphology of the BBIN-2 film (Fig. S7, ESI).
Thanks to the introduction of long alkyl chains, the BBIN series can be dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene (Table S1, ESI), which allows us to spin-coat the ETM without destroying the perovskite layer below. Then, we prepared the device with an inverted planar structure of glass/ITO/poly[3-(4-carboxylatebutyl)thiophene (P3CT)/perovskite/ETM/C60/BCP/Ag. Here, P3CT is used as the hole transport material, the perovskite layer material used CsFAPbI3, and the ETM is BBIN-1, BBIN-2 or BBIN-3. We also made a reference device with PC61BM as the ETM for comparison. Through concentration optimization (Table S2, ESI), the optimal thickness of the BBIN series is about 5 nm, which has little influence on the device absorption (Fig. S8, ESI).
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal PSCs with different ETMs are shown in Fig. 3(a). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Obviously, PSCs with various isomers exhibited slightly different performance. The BBIN-2 devices exhibited the highest PCEs with the highest VOC and fill factor (FF) values. The champion PCE of the BBIN-2 devices is 19.36%, with a VOC of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.10%. The BBIN-3 devices exhibited the lowest PCE of 17.94%, with a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 23.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.59%. Moreover, the BBIN-1 and BBIN-2 devices exhibited better photovoltaic performance than the PC61BM devices, which exhibited a champion PCE of 18.78%. The higher PCEs of the BBIN-1 and BBIN-2 devices are mainly ascribed to the higher VOC. The highest VOC value of the BBIN-2 device is consistent with the highest LUMO level. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements have been carried out (Fig. 3(b)) to verify the JSC obtained from the J–V curves. The integrated JSC of the BBIN-1, BBIN-2, BBIN-3 and PC61BM devices is 22.72 mA cm−2, 22.70 mA cm−2, 22.65 mA cm−2 and 22.73 mA cm−2, respectively, which is close to the value obtained from the J–V curves, with a deviation less than 5%. The hysteresis effect of the optimal device was studied by scanning the J–V curves from the forward and reverse directions. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI), the J–V curves overlap roughly in two different scanning directions. The forward and reverse scanning PCEs of the devices based on BBIN-2 and PC61BM are 19.36% and 18.94%, and 18.78% and 18.00%, respectively. This result shows that their hysteresis is negligible. The statistical distribution of the parameters for the devices with various ETMs is also presented in Fig. 3(c–f). It can also be seen that the BBIN-2 device showed higher PCE values than the BBIN-1 and BBIN-3 devices. The higher VOC and FF values are responsible for the higher PCE values. The BBIN-1 and BBIN-3 devices showed close PCE values to the PC61BM devices with higher VOC values but lower JSC values.

The morphology of the ETM covering the perovskite layer has an important impact on PSC performance. Therefore, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study the surface morphology of the BBIN series and PC61BM on top of the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI). From the SEM images, we can clearly see that the perovskite crystals are dense and pinhole-free. The BBIN films are uniformly covered on the perovskite, which is similar to the PC61BM film. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of PC61BM, BBIN-1, BBIN-2 and BBIN-3 is 10.5 nm, 19.5 nm, 17.8 nm and 26.4 nm, respectively. Except for BBIN-3, the other ETMs have a significant decrease in RMS compared to the pure perovskites. For the PSCs, the relatively smooth surface is more conducive to the transfer of electrons between the active layer and interfacial layer.
To further investigate the electron extraction/collection behavior between the ETMs and the perovskite layer, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was recorded. The measurements were conducted on the glass/perovskite and glass/perovskite/ETM substrate. As shown in Fig. 4(a), when the BBIN series covers the perovskite film, PL quenching phenomena can be obviously seen, due to the effective transfer of electrons from the perovskite layer to the ETM. This indicated that all the BBIN series can favorably extract electrons from the perovskite. It is worth noting that compared to BBIN-1 and BBIN-3, BBIN-2 quenched the PL of the perovskite more effectively, which indicated that the electron transfer from perovskite to BBIN-2 is better. Transient photoelectric current (TPC) measurements were also carried out to research the charge transfer processes in the device. As shown in Fig. 4(b), compared to the BBIN-1 device and BBIN-2 device, a relatively smaller photocurrent decay time is observed in the BBIN-2 device. The smaller photocurrent decay time confirms the superior electron extraction process, which is consistent with the better fluorescence quenching effect in the PL measurements above. The better electron extraction of BBIN-2 could be attributed to the higher μe and smoother film morphology than the isomers BBIN-1 and BBIN-3. The better electron extraction in the BBIN-2 device thus induced a higher FF. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also conducted to investigate the defect passivation of the BBIN series on perovskite (Fig. S12, ESI). The larger shifts of Pb 4f binding energy with the BBIN-1 and BBIN-2 film indicated better defect passivation of BBIN-1 and BBIN-2 to the perovskite, which could induce the higher FF value of the BBIN-1 and BBIN-2 devices.
Long-term stability is considered to be one of the most important parameters in the practical application of PSC devices. The hydrophobic ETM could preserve the perovskite from the erosion of humidity, and therefore we tested the water contact angle of the BBIN series. As seen from Fig. S13(a–e) (ESI), the BBIN series all have a larger water contact angle than PC61BM, and their hydrophobicity should be conducive to the stability of its devices. As shown in Fig. S13(f) (ESI), the PSCs with the BBIN series maintained over 80% of their initial efficiency after 168 hours of exposure to environmental conditions of 25 °C and 40% relative humidity, while the PC61BM device only maintained about 75% of its initial performance. The storage stability of the PSCs with various ETMs under a N2 atmosphere was also examined, as shown in Fig. S14 (ESI). The PSCs with the BBIN series also exhibited a slower PCE decay than the PC61BM device. After 1000 hours of storage in a glove box, the BBIN device can still maintain 92% of its initial value.
In summary, we designed and synthesized novel soluble perinone derivatives named BBIN, containing three isomers as an efficient ETM to replace PC61BM in p–i–n PSCs. The cis-isomer BBIN-2 and trans-isomers BBIN-1 and BBIN-3 are quite different in photophysical and electrochemical properties. BBIN-2 possesses a bathochromic absorption and smaller bandgap than BBIN-1 and BBIN-3. Meanwhile, the BBIN-2 film exhibits a slightly higher LUMO level and electron mobility than the trans-isomers. Thus, the BBIN-2 device exhibits the highest PCE of 19.36%, which is also higher than that of the PC61BM device. The PSCs with the BBIN series also show better storage stability than the PC61BM device both in air and a N2 atmosphere due to their stronger hydrophobicity. The successful application of BBIN isomers in p–i–n PSCs broadens the applied field of perinone dyes.
