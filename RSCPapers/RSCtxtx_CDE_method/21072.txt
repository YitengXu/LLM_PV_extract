A novel 3D TiO2 nanomesh with a high specific surface area was successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method using NaOH and P25 as the reactive agents. The as-prepared and calcined 3D TiO2 nanomesh samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The performance of DSSCs employing TiO2 as the photoelectrode shows an extreme dependence on the microstructure of the photoanode. Specifically, the double-layer photoanode with a hybrid top-layer composed of TiO2 nanomesh and Degussa P25 gives a high power conversion efficiency of 8.82% and a short circuit photocurrent density of 17.86 mA cm−2, indicating a 47% increase in the conversion efficiency compared to the DSSC with a P25 photoanode (5.98%, 13.33 mA cm−2).

A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a photochemical cell composed of a photoanode, a dye, an electrolyte and a counter-electrode. Among these components, the photoanode plays an important role, not only in the absorption of the dye but also in the separation and transmission of electrical charge, so the quality of the photoanode directly influences the performance of the overall solar cell. Because of its unique photoelectrical properties, titania (TiO2) has become one of the most investigated inorganic oxide semiconductor photoanode materials for use in DSSCs. For various types of DSSC, including solid state, liquid, rigid and flexible types, TiO2 has shown the best performance as a photoanode.

By adjusting the thickness and the microstructure of the photoanode as well as the morphology of the TiO2, the efficiency of a DSSC can be greatly enhanced. The highest power conversion efficiency of over 12% has been achieved by using a porphyrin-based dye as a light-harvester and a volatile organic solvent electrolyte with cobalt(II/III), in conjunction with a double layer TiO2 photoelectrode consisting of a dye adsorption layer (20 nm sized TiO2 nanoparticle) and a top particle light scattering layer (large particle size, 400 nm). This structure with a double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode is a promising alternative approach to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. The morphology of the large TiO2 particles in the top layer has an extremely pronounced effect on the performance of the double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode, thereby affecting the overall device performance. Recently, significant enhancement of DSSC performance has been achieved by using TiO2 photoelectrodes with various morphologies such as sub-microspheres, mesoporous TiO2 beads and nanorods/wires. 3D hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures exhibit three important beneficial attributes for this application, including a considerable surface area, a high light scattering ability and fast rates of electron transport. However, the dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles were connected via physical and not chemical contact, so an interface barrier evidently exists between the individual nanoparticles which will hinder the transmission of electric charge through the TiO2 photoanode to the FTO. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the use of a 3D TiO2 nanomesh would be advantageous for enhancing the transmission of electric charge.
In this work, we developed a one-step hydrothermal method to directly convert commercial P25 powders into 3D nanomesh structures. This unique structure is assembled from different sized holes connected by a venation system. Moreover, nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis demonstrated that the obtained TiO2 nanomesh structure has an extraordinary specific surface area. Therefore, we employed this novel structure TiO2 material as a photoanode in a DSSC for the absorption of dye molecules, scattering of the incident light and transmission of the electrical charge, demonstrating its excellent photoelectrical properties.

0.1 g P25 (Degussa) was added to 60 mL of 10 M NaOH solution. After ultrasonic treatment and stirring for 5 min each, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Then the autoclave was sealed and heated at 150 °C for 0–90 min. The system was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The as-obtained white product was collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 0.2 M hydrochloric acid solution, and then centrifuged and washed three times with deionized water to remove any possible ionic remains. Finally, the products were dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 5 h, calcined at 450 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air, and collected for further characterization.


The crystal structure of the as-prepared product was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku TTRIII, with Cu Kα1 radiation). The morphology and microstructure were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7500F, operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operated at 200 kV). The specific surface area was measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation based on the nitrogen adsorption isotherm obtained with a Micromeritics Gemini VII apparatus (Surface Area and Porosity System).


To prepare the DSSC working electrodes, 0.3 g of TiO2 nanomesh was added into a mixture of 5 mL ethylalcohol and 1 g terpinol and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 60 min to form a paste. First, a P25 nanocrystalline film (∼25 nm, BET 56 m2 g−1, Degussa) was formed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (resistivity 14 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) using the doctor blade technique. After drying at 125 °C for 6 min, the nanomesh layer was deposited on the P25 films using the same process, and the thick film with a double-layer structure was then allowed to dry at 125 °C before sintering at various temperatures between 325–500 °C in air. Then, the thick film with a double-layer structure was loaded with dye by immersing it into a 0.5 mM Ru-dye solution (cis-dithiocyanate-N,N′-bis(4-carboxylate-4 tetrabutyl ammoniumcarboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) (known as N719, Solaronix)) for 24 h at room temperature. The resulting photoanode with a double-layer structure was then combined with a Pt-sputtered FTO counter electrode and an acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85/15 v/v) electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich), in order to make a DSSC via a vacuum filling method. The area of the working electrode film for solar cell performance testing was 0.25 cm2.


The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Newport, Model: 94023A). A 450 W xenon arc lamp (Newport, Model: 6280NS) served as a light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with an optical filter to approximate AM 1.5 G one sun light intensity before each measurement. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm with a spectral resolution of 5 nm using a Spectral Product Zolix DSC300PA. Diffuse-reflectance spectra were measured on the same film samples using a Perkin-Elmer UV-Vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU 2550).


The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method is shown in Fig. 1a. The well-defined and sharp Bragg peaks with high intensities indicate the good crystallinity of the sample. As can be seen from the XRD pattern, the 2θ values at 25.36, 37.86, 47.96, 54.14, 55.08, 62.73, 68.66, 70.37 and 75.06 correspond to anatase TiO2, and the 2θ values at 27.44, 36.04, 41.36, 53.1 and 56.52 correspond to rutile TiO2. Meanwhile, the average crystallite sizes of the TiO2 samples were calculated using the Scherrer formula: D = Kλ/βcosθ, where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm), K is the Scherrer constant (K = 0.89), θ is the position of the X-ray diffraction peak, and β is the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the (101) plane for anatase TiO2. The calculated crystal grain size was about 9 nm, indicating that the thickness of each layer venation is thin and that their distribution is sparse. The morphology and internal structure of the TiO2 samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1b and c display the SEM and TEM images of the as-prepared sample, which indicate that the TiO2 has a 3D nanomesh porous structure with different sizes of holes, and the holes are connected together by venations. The inset in Fig. 1b shows a higher magnification SEM image, in which each hole and venation can be more clearly seen, with the surface structure of the material having a spider web-like structure with good porosity and connectivity. Meanwhile, it can be found that the bulk region of these products is very thin and sparsely distributed (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the HRTEM image of an individual venation indicates the good crystallinity of the as-prepared TiO2 nanomesh. The inter-plane spacings of 0.351 nm and 0.219 nm imply that the TiO2 nanomesh grows along the enclosed with the {101} facets of anatase and {111} facets of rutile, respectively, which is consistent with the XRD information discussed above.
Fig. 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution (inset) of the as prepared samples. The adsorption–desorption isotherms are typical type IV isotherms with a sharp capillary condensation step at high relative pressures (P/P0 = 0.85), and an H1 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, indicating that the materials contain disordered mesopores (Fig. 2). Pore size distribution curves were calculated from the desorption branch of a nitrogen isotherm by the BJH method using the Halsey equation. The pore size distribution curve revealed a correspondingly narrow pore size distribution (5–40 nm) with a peak size of about 12 nm (the inset of Fig. 2). Moreover, The BET surface area of the products was calculated to be 424 m2 g−1 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and this rare high BET surface area is beneficial for dye absorption.

To reveal the formation process and the possible growth mechanism of the 3D TiO2 nanomesh, a study of the morphology evolution of the nanomesh structure with different reaction times was carried out. Fig. 3 shows a series of SEM images of the products at different reaction times. When P25 nanoparticles were added to NaOH solutions, the particles remained dispersed in the initial stage (Fig. 3a). After 15 min, it can be observed that the TiO2 particles start to agglomerate, which can be attributed to corrosion of the surface of individual particles by NaOH, leading to the combination of those particles (Fig. 3b). When the hydrothermal process was prolonged to 45 min, the NaOH continued reacting with the TiOx on the surface of the P25 particles. This reaction can be described as follows: TiOx + NaOH → Na2TiO3 + H2O. With the continuous corrosion of titanium oxide by the sodium hydroxide, the above reaction leads to the formation of a porous structure on the surface of the titanium oxide (Fig. 3c). Because the corrosion rates of the various crystal faces are different, and extension of the reaction time leads to further corrosion of the titanium dioxide by sodium hydroxide, a nanofibre structure was formed through an oriented attachment process. In this stage, the concentration of TiO32− was low and there were a few TiOx holes deposited on the surface. With further prolongation of the reaction time, the porous hierarchical TiO2 3D nanomesh will be obtained through the assembly of the nanofibres (Fig. 3d). During the washing process, the as-prepared products were washed with dilute HCl solutions and distilled water. The Na–O–Ti links on the surface of the products are believed to react with acid and water to form new H–O–Ti and Ti–O–Ti links. After annealing at 450 °C for 2 h, the pure TiO2 with no other components was obtained (as shown by XRD). On the basis of the above observations, we are apt to describe the crystal growth mechanism of the nanomesh structures as involving a sequence of agglomeration, melting/dissolution, and renucleation/recrystallization, leading to the evolution of a nanomesh morphology. The schematic diagram of the nanomesh crystal growth is displayed in Fig. 3e.

For comparison, four types of film ((I) P25, (II) 3D TiO2, (III) P25 + 3D TiO2, (IV) P25 + 3D TiO2:P25) with similar thicknesses of 12 μm were deposited onto the FTO glass using the doctor blade technique. Both Film-I and Film-II were single layer photoanode films. Meanwhile, Film-III and Film-IV were double-layer photoanodes, but with different top layers. The as-prepared 3D TiO2 nanomesh was used as the sole component of the upper layer material for Film-III, while Film-IV had a hybrid upper layer composed of a 1:1 weight ratio of 3D TiO2 nanomesh and P25. After dye loading, the photocurrent density voltage (J–V) curves for the DSSCs based on the four films (Cell-I: Film-I, Cell-II: Film-II, Cell-III: Film-III and Cell-IV: Film-IV) were measured and are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of Cell-I and Cell-II are almost the same. The difference between their energy conversion efficiencies (η) mainly arises from the difference in their fill factors (FF). The single 3D TiO2 layer gave rise to a higher FF than the single P25 layer, due to its higher adsorption ability with respect to the dye. It is noteworthy that the Jsc of Cell-II is not enhanced by the presence of the 3D TiO2, even though it has a higher dye adsorption ability. This observation can be explained by the fact that the excess dye loading in Cell-II results in the recombination of photoelectrons by other dye molecules.

Cell-III exhibited a much higher photocurrent than Cell-I or Cell-II, mainly due to its special cell structure in which the bottom and top layers were P25 and the as-prepared nanomesh, respectively. The P25 has a high transparency for incident light due to its small size. On the other hand, the mesh assembled from the nanosheets can not only absorb more dye molecules but also promotes light scattering. Therefore, such a combination exhibited a higher photocurrent (Jsc = 17.42 mA cm−2) compared with those of Cell-I and Cell-II. In addition, Cell-III exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.745 V, a fill factor (FF) of 62.2%, and a PCE of 8.07%. Cell-IV exhibited the highest short-circuit current density (17.86 mA cm−2) and PCE (8.82%) among the four cells tested. In contrast to Cell-III, Cell-IV has the same bottom layer, but the top layer is composed of a 1:1 weight ratio of 3D TiO2 nanomesh and P25. For Cell-IV, the novel structure of the top layer plays an important role in its high performance. Cell-IV displayed a higher adsorbance to the incident light in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm, as shown in Fig. 5, indicating that the higher adsorbance can exert a positive effect on the Jsc, contributing to its enhanced value. Moreover, the combination of P25 and nanomesh can improve the transport properties and reduce the recombination of photoelectrons. In addition, the increase of the energy conversion efficiency (η) observed for Cell-IV, is mainly due to the increase of the fill factor (FF) rather than the improvement of the short-circuit current density. In general, the fill factor (FF) is related to the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) in the typical equivalent diode circuit model of solar cells, which can be estimated from the derivative of the J–V curves using the equation: R = −(dJ/dV)−1.
Fig. 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the four films loaded with N719 dye. Compared with Film-I which consists of only nanocrystalline P25, Film-III and Film-IV which possess the special film structures using the TiO2 nanomesh, have a better adsorption capacity over the whole spectral range. Film-II, using a single layer of the nanomesh, exhibited the best absorbance performance in the wavelength range of 325 to 575 nm among the four types of film, due to its excellent dye absorption, but conversely it exhibited the lowest light absorption above 650 nm due to its porous microstructure. For all of the photoanodes, the absorption peaks appear at about 525 nm, which matches the absorption peak of N719 dye (shown in Fig. 5 inset), indicating that the main peaks can be ascribed to light absorption by the dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 nanomaterials. However, the differences between the absorption capacities of these four films may not be proportional to the differences observed in the PCE and the IPCE, since PCE and IPCE can be affected by a number of other parameters.
Fig. 6 shows the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the four kinds of DSSCs. It can be observed that for all of the DSSCs, the maxima of the IPCE spectra appear at 525 nm (the peak of the N719 adsorption spectrum). Of the tested cells, Cell-IV reveals the highest IPCE values over the whole spectral region, which can be ascribed to the relatively superior specific surface area, enabling the uniform distribution of dye molecules on the surface of the nanomaterial. Compared with Cell-I, using only a single layer of P25, Cell-II using a single layer of nanomesh showed a significantly improved IPCE at 525 nm. This result also proves that the large specific surface area is very important for determination of the IPCE. However, while exhibiting a higher IPCE at 525 nm, Cell-II gave lower IPCEs in the other spectral regions than Cell-III and Cell-IV.
We further investigated the origin and evidence for the increased Jsc and η by measuring the correlation between the dark current and the potential for Cell-I and Cell-IV, as shown in Fig. 7a. The dark current arises from the reduction of the I3− ion by the electrons in the FTO substrate, which causes electron recombination and results in the loss of photo-current. Although the dark current cannot be related directly to the back electron transfer process, since the electrolyte concentration in the films and the potential distribution across the nanoporous electrode in the dark are different to those under illumination, it has been considered as a qualitative technique to describe the extent of the back electron transfer. In order to compare with the general case of a DSSC, Cell-I and Cell-IV will be discussed. Compared with Cell-I, the dark current onset of Cell-IV was shifted to a higher potential and produced a smaller dark current at the same potential of above 0.55 V. This observation is indicative of a lower recombination rate between transferred electrons and I3− ions for the double layers (P25 + hybrid nanomesh and P25), and as a result of this lower recombination, the Jsc and η are greatly increased.
The recombination property is also characterized by using open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements (Fig. 7b). The measurement was conducted when a steady-state open-circuit voltage (Voc) was obtained from the DSSC under the solar light illumination, and the decay of Voc was monitored after switching off the illumination. It is well-established that Voc is highly dependent on the quasi-Fermi level and the electron density at the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. Therefore, the decay of Voc can be used to reflect the regression of electron density at the CB of TiO2.Fig. 7b shows that the decay rate of Voc with the double layer film (P25 + hybrid nanomesh and P25) was much slower than that with the single P25 layer film. This indicates a restrained regression of electron density at the CB of the hybrid layer, and suggests that the combination rate in Cell-IV was considerably reduced, leading to more photo electrons surviving the electron transport process and a correspondingly stronger photo-current. In addition, the alleviated electron recombination could increase the electron density at the conduction band, which in turn would raise the Fermi level and the Voc.

We have reported the development of a novel hybrid top-layer photoanode film structure incorporating nanomesh TiO2, for application in DSSCs. UV-Vis diffused reflectance and absorption spectra, I–V curves and IPCE spectra etc. revealed that the photoanode film structure with a nanomesh morphology played a key role in enhancing the performance of the photoanode and the energy conversion efficiency of the corresponding DSSC. The top-layer is a hybrid of nanomesh TiO2 and standard P25 with a weight ratio of 1:1, and it exhibited a much higher energy conversion efficiency of 8.82% and a short-circuit photocurrent density of 17.86 mA cm−2, indicating a 47% increase in the conversion efficiency compared to that of the P25 photoanode (5.98%, 13.33 mA cm−2).
