Side-chain engineering of polymer backbones can induce subtle variations in polymer properties, resulting in a significant impact on their photovoltaic performance. In this work, four ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene containing copolymers with different alkyl side chains (P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6) were designed and synthesized. These copolymers have large bandgaps (∼2.0 eV) and deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (from −5.44 eV to −5.53 eV). The substitution of two hexyl groups with two methyl groups on the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene unit afforded polymer P3FTBT1 which exhibits an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.39%. Incorporation of fluorine into the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) unit gave polymer P3FTBT1F which exhibits a PCE of 4.50% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V. By introducing two alkoxy groups to the BT unit, P3FTBT1O6 was synthesized, and it exhibits a PCE of 5.73% with a Voc of 1.02 V. The results suggest that the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene is an excellent building block to construct donor–acceptor copolymers with high PCEs and large Vocs.

As a new kind of energy conversion devices, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have some advantages such as good flexibility, large area processability, lightweight, low-cost, etc. Through the joint efforts of many researchers in the organic photovoltaic field, significant breakthroughs have been made over the past decade. At present, both single-junction and tandem PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved. It is known that in order to get a high PCE PSC, both a large short-circuit current density (Jsc) value and a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) are required. So far, an effective strategy to increase the Jsc values of PSCs, has been to develop low-bandgap conjugated copolymers which can capture more long-wavelength solar light. However, photovoltaic devices based on low-bandgap polymers with a large Jsc value often leads to a decreased Voc. As an alternative strategy, researchers have developed tandem devices that stack two or more subcells with complementary absorption spectra. In this way, the Voc of a tandem PSC is close to the sum of the Vocs of the individual cells. Though there have been a large number of low-bandgap polymers for tandem devices, the number of large bandgap (short-wavelength absorbing) copolymers with high PCEs is relatively limited. To date, nearly all tandem solar cells used poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, 1.90 eV bandgap, and HOMO = −5.10 eV) as the short-wavelength absorbing material, which exhibited a low Voc of ∼0.70 V (when blended with PC71BM). Therefore, in order to enhance the Vocs of tandem solar cells, a replacement of P3HT with spectrally optimized large band-gap polymers is urgently needed.

Recently, large or medium band-gap polymers with Vocs exceeding 1.0 V have been developed by a number of research groups. For example, Lam et al. developed a donor–acceptor copolymer using pyrrolo[3,4-f]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,7-dione as the electron acceptor. Although the resulting PSC exhibited an exceptionally large Voc of 1.10 V, only a low PCE of 1.61% was achieved due to the low Jsc of 4.0 mA cm−2 and the low FF of 0.33. Casey et al. reported a donor–acceptor copolymer (P2) using thioalkyl-substituted benzothiadiazole as the electron acceptor. The resulting PSC device exhibited a PCE of 1.92% with a high Voc of 1.07 V. Beaujuge et al. developed a medium band-gap (1.79 eV) copolymer based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione. And the resulting polymer exhibited a high PCE of 6.7% and an outstanding Voc of 1.05 V. In order to have a good current balance for the two individual subcells in tandem devices, the ideal short-wavelength absorbing material should have a large Voc, a high Jsc value, and a band-gap as large as possible. Therefore, large band-gap (>2.0 eV) copolymers with high PCEs and large Vocs will be good candidates as short-wavelength absorbing materials in tandem solar cells.

V
ocs of PSCs can be enhanced by tuning the HOMO positions of p-type polymers (donor) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) positions of n-type fullerene derivatives (acceptor) to increase the interfacial energy gaps. As fullerene derivatives have been the most ubiquitous acceptor molecules employed in PSCs so far, one feasible strategy to enhance the Vocs involves the tuning of HOMO energy positions of p-type conjugated polymers. It has been shown that the combination of a weak donor and a strong acceptor can lead to copolymers with deep-lying HOMO positions as well as the resulting high Vocs for the devices. Due to the weak electron donating ability of the fluorene group, many fluorene-based copolymers exhibit deep-lying HOMO energy levels and the resulting high Vocs for the corresponding solar cells. The structure of ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene consists of three “linearly overlapping” fluorenes. Compared to fluorene, ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene has similar electron donating ability but an extended π-conjugation which may lead to a broader, more intense absorption band of the resulting copolymers. Previously, Zheng et al. reported a ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene-based D–A copolymer (P3FTBT6 in Scheme 1) with a PCE of 4.5% and a Voc of 1.04 V. However, only a low fill factor of 44% was achieved due to the unoptimized side chains. As it has been disclosed, proper side-chain engineering has an important impact on polymer properties besides the backbone modification. The side chains of a polymer can affect the molecular weight, solubility, self-assembly, optoelectronic properties and film morphology, which in turn, will affect the performance of the resulting polymer solar cells.BT is an excellent acceptor unit for D–A copolymers, and therefore it is used to construct the target ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene-based copolymers. As usual, two thiophene groups are introduced on both sides of the BT group to reduce the steric hindrance between the donor unit and the acceptor unit, which may also affect the properties such as carrier mobilities, UV-vis absorption, etc. of the resulting polymer. For the side-chain engineering of the acceptor unit, three different substituents, i.e., hydrogen, a hexyloxy group (electron-donating), and fluorine atom (electron-withdrawing), were introduced. And for the donor unit, we varied the size of the central two alkyl chains on the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene core, from the shortest alkyl group (methyl) to the branched alkyl group (ethylhexyl).
In this context, we designed and synthesized four D–A copolymers using BT as the acceptor unit and ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene as the donor unit. The target copolymers (P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6) with different side chains either in the donor unit or in the acceptor unit are shown in Scheme 1. The optical, electrochemical and electrical properties of these polymers are investigated together with their photovoltaic performance. Conventional solar cells are fabricated by using the conjugated polymers as donor materials and the PC71BM as the acceptor material. Compared to P3FTBT6-based solar cells which showed a maximum PCE of 4.5% and a low FF of 0.42, the best performance device based on P3FTBT1 exhibits an increased PCE of 5.39% and an improved FF of 51.65%, respectively. The P3FTBT1F-based solar cell also exhibits a high Voc of 1.09 V with a PCE of 4.50%. Among all the four copolymers, the best performance device based on P3FTBT1O6 exhibits the highest PCE of 5.73% with a Voc of 1.02 V.

All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received without further purification unless otherwise specified. Compounds 1, 4, 7, 8 and 9 were prepared according to the literature procedures. The interlayer poly[6,6,12,12-tetra(2-ethylhexyl)-6,12-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]-fluorene-2,8-diyl-alt-2,5-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propoxy)benzene-1,4-diyl] (PIFB) was prepared by the copolymerization reaction between 1,4-dibromo-2,5-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propoxy)benzene and 2,2-(6,6,12,12-tetraethylhexyl-6,12-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]fluorene-2,8-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane). Column chromatography was conducted with silica gel (300–400 mesh).



1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) measurements were performed on an IonSpec 4.7 T spectrometer. Absorption spectra were obtained on a spectrophotometer (Lambda 35 UV/vis). Molecular weights and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of the polymers were measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 150 °C (polystyrene as the internal standard). The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI 700E electrochemical workstation. PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) which had been precisely calibrated with a NREL-certified silicon reference cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained on a Newport EQE measuring system. The current–voltage curves of organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and hole-only devices were measured with an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The thicknesses of polymer films and polymer:PC71BM blended films were measured using the Bruker Dektak XT surface profilometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed with Bruker’s Dimension FastScan at a tapping mode.


The PSCs were fabricated in the traditional single-junction devices with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT : PSS)/polymer : PC71BM/PIFB/Al. ITO glass was cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each and then dried in an oven at 90 °C overnight. After the ITO glass substrates were subjected to ultraviolet/ozone treatment for 15 min, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVPAI 4083) which had been filtered through a 0.45 μm filter was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s. Then the film-loaded substrates were dried at 140 °C in air for 15 min. Polymers were blended with PC71BM at different weight ratios. The mixtures were dissolved in mixed solvents of chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene (4/1, v/v) at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 and stirred overnight. Then the active layer was prepared by spin-coating the polymer:PC71BM solution at 1500 rpm for 1 min. To facilitate efficient electron injection, a methanol solution of PIFB (0.3 mg ml−1 containing 30 eq. of acetic acid) was spin-coated to form an electron injection interlayer. Eventually, the negative electrode was prepared by thermally depositing about 100 nm aluminum through a shadow mask under a high vacuum of about 5 × 10−5 Torr. The active areas of the devices were fixed at 4 or 6 mm2.


The heavily doped Si (100) substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 3:1 by volume), water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each and then dried in an oven at 90 °C overnight. After the substrates were pretreated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) for 5 hours, the chlorobenzene solution of the polymer which had been filtered through a 0.45 μm filter was spin-coated on the substrates at 1500 rpm for 60 s. At last, the Au electrode (60 nm) was thermally deposited through a shadow mask to obtain top-contact bottom-gate FETs.

In order to further estimate the hole mobilities of these polymers and polymers:PC71BM blends, we also prepared hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Au). The hole-only devices were fabricated following the same procedures as those for the PSCs except that the PIFB layer and Al electrode were replaced by MoO3 (10 nm) and gold (60 nm), respectively.

Compounds 1 and 4 were synthesized according to the literature procedures. As depicted in Scheme 2, compound 1 was treated with n-hexyllithium, ammonium chloride aqueous solution and boron trifluoride etherate successively to get compound 2 in 39% overall yield via an intramolecular Friedel–Crafts alkylation. Then, compound 2 was selectively brominated with copper(II) bromide on an alumina matrix in carbon tetrachloride to afford compound 3 in 88% yield. Monomer 6 was synthesized using the same procedures as described above for compound 3. Monomers 7, 8 and 9 were prepared according to the procedures reported in the literature.

The synthetic route for the copolymers is depicted in Scheme 3. The Stille cross-coupling reaction between the ladder-type dibromotetra-p-phenylene (compound 3 or 6) and the monomer (compound 7, 8, or 9) using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalytic system afforded D–A copolymers P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6. With the help of alkyl chains on the backbone of the polymers, these polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc. GPC results show that the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 are 22.0, 14.6, 11.6 and 16.6 kDa, respectively, with the corresponding polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 2.10, 1.75, 1.76 and 2.06, in that order. It should be noted that the incorporation of two F atoms to the BT unit leads to bad solubility of the resulting copolymer (P3FTBT1F) which in turn leads to its low molecular weight. However, the low molecular weight of P3FTBT8O6 may be attributed to the more bulky groups in the polymer backbone which prevents the further reaction towards polymers with a larger molecular weight. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 are thermally stable with the 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) values of 430, 430, 336 and 345 °C, respectively (Fig. S1).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers measured in chlorobenzene solutions (1 × 10−5 M) or in thin films are shown in Fig. 1. Normalized absorption spectra of the copolymers blended with PC71BM are shown in Fig. S2. The absorption peaks and optical band-gaps of these polymers both in solution and in solid state are also listed in Table 1. All these copolymers have two similar characteristic D–A copolymer absorption bands. The shorter wavelength absorption band originates from the localized π–π* transition and the longer wavelength absorption peak is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-rich ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene part to the electron-deficient BT segment. All absorption spectra have similar absorption bandwidths and shapes, due to the same main backbone they have. P3FTBT1 exhibits a low energy absorption maximum at 544 nm in chlorobenzene solution. However, the absorption bands of P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 shift to 527 nm, 516 nm and 522 nm, respectively. The blue shift absorption bands induced by the incorporation of fluorine or the alkoxy group are in agreement with the results obtained for other copolymers. Compared to their corresponding absorption spectra in solutions, all polymers in thin films show a slight bathochromic shift to the longer wavelength. P3FTBT8O6 with 2-ethylhexyl side chains exhibits blue-shifted absorption in relation to the polymer with methyl side chains (P3FTBT1O6) no matter in chlorobenzene or in the solid state. This may be due to the branched substituents in the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene skeleton disrupting the planar conformation of the resulting copolymers to some extent. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) deduced from the onset absorption edges of the polymer films are 1.94, 2.00, 2.05 and 2.04 eV for P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6, respectively.

HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are crucial for the selection of the appropriate acceptor and device structure in BHJ PSCs. The CV measurements were performed by using a three electrode cell system (a Pt disk working electrode coated with polymer chloroform solution to form a thin film, an Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M AgNO3 in MeCN) reference electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode) in a 0.1 mol l−1 anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Under this condition, the onset oxidation potential (Eox1/2) of ferrocene was −0.02 V versus Ag/Ag+. It was assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV to vacuum. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated according to the following equations and are summarized in Table 1.

All the copolymers exhibit oxidation behaviors, indicating that these polymers have good stability in the charged state. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P3FTBT1 are located at −5.44 eV and −3.54 eV, respectively. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing property of the F atom, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P3FTBT1F decrease to −5.51 and −3.58 eV, respectively. After the incorporation of two alkoxy groups, the HOMO energy levels of P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 change to −5.53 and −5.49 eV, respectively. All polymers have deep-lying HOMO energy levels and thus they can be used for the fabrication of PSCs with large Vocs. Larger LUMO offset energy between the polymer and PC71BM benefits the geminate pair dissociation and a higher PCE. The electrochemical band-gaps of P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6, and P3FTBT1O6 are determined to be 1.90, 1.93, 1.97 and 1.92 eV, respectively. The small differences (<0.13 eV) between the electrochemical band-gaps and the optical band-gaps for the copolymer are similar to those of some other amorphous polymers.

Mobilities are important parameters to fabricate high performance PSCs. Because PC71BM has enough high electron transporting ability to afford sufficient electron mobility, the hole mobilities of copolymers are crucial for the PSCs. In this work, we measured hole mobilities of these copolymers by fabricating OFETs and hole-only devices.

Transfer curves of OFETs based on the polymers are shown in Fig. S3, where Id represents the source-drain current and Vg represents the source-drain voltage. The mobilities were calculated from the transfer characteristics of the OFETs using the slope derived from the square root of the absolute value of the current as a function of the gate voltage. The hole mobilities of P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 are (1.43 ± 0.07) × 10−3, (2.68 ± 0.15) × 10−3, (5.48 ± 0.17) × 10−5 and (2.15 ± 0.05) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobilities of P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F and P3FTBT1O6 are higher than those of P3FTBT8O6. There was a pronounced mobility difference between P3FTBT1O6 and P3FTBT8O6, and the mobility of the former is about 40 times higher than that of the latter, demonstrating the strong effect of the alkyl chain on the hole transporting property of copolymers. It should be mentioned that the structure difference in P3FTBT1O6 and P3FTBT8O6 is the length of central side chains on the donor unit.
The OFETs show hole migration ability in the horizontal direction. As polymers are anisotropic, hole mobilities in horizontal and vertical directions may be different. Therefore, the hole mobilities of the polymers were also estimated with the space charge limited current (SCLC) method and hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer (or polymer:PC71BM)/MoO3/Au). The SCLC hole mobilities were calculated according to the following equation:
(4)
where
J is the current, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (assumed to be 3), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device (V = Vappl − Va − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Va is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in the work function of the two electrodes), and L is the film thickness of the polymer or polymer:PC71BM blend. The J0.5–V curves are shown in Fig. S4. The hole mobilities of P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 are estimated to be (8.00 ± 0.62) × 10−6, (6.92 ± 0.61) × 10−6, (2.46 ± 0.24) × 10−6 and (1.24 ± 0.12) × 10−5 cm2·V−1·s−1, respectively. The hole mobilities measured by OFETs are hundreds of times higher than those estimated by the SCLC method similar to the reported findings.P3FTBT1O6 has the highest μSCLC value to assure enough charge transport and may lead to PSCs with the highest PCE among these polymers. However, P3FTBT8O6 has the lowest μSCLC value due to the bulky 2-ethylhexyl groups in its polymer backbone which may be against a good π–π packing in the solid state.


A conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PIFB/Al was used to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymers. In order to get well balanced electron/hole mobilities, the donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of the active layers are optimized toward better device performance. The photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) are summarized in Tables 2 and S1–S4. As shown in Tables 2 and S1–S3, the optimized weight ratio of the polymer to PC71BM is 1:4.5 for all the four copolymers. Here, P3FTBT1O6 was used as an example to demonstrate the effect of the blend ratio on the performance of solar cells. The J–V curves and the EQE spectra of PSCs based on P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM with different blend ratios (D:A = 1:3.0, 1:4.0, 1:4.5 and 1:5.0) are plotted in Fig. 3. And the photovoltaic performance enhancements of P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM-based devices are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the Voc remains almost unchanged with the change in PC71BM content. However, with the increasing PC71BM content, increased FF, Jsc, and PCE are observed in the weight ratios between 3.0:1 and 4.5:1. When the blend ratio of PC71BM:P3FTBT1O6 further increases to 5.0:1, decreased FF, Jsc, and PCE are observed. This performance dependence trend is also reflected from the corresponding Rs values of the devices as shown in Table 2. It is attributed to the fact that the Voc is mainly dependent on the energy levels of the polymer, PC71BM, PIFB and PEDOT:PSS. Whereas, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the PSCs are closely related with the hole and electron mobilities of the active layers which are strongly influenced by the polymer:PC71BM blend ratio.

To explain the impacts of blend ratios on the polymer photovoltaic performance, hole mobilities of P3FTBT1O6 : PC71BM blend films with various blend ratios were investigated by the SCLC method. The dark current density–voltage (Jdark–V) characteristics of these hole-only devices are plotted in Fig. S5. The hole mobilities of the P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM blend films with various blend ratios (D:A = 1:3.0, 1:4.0, 1:4.5 and 1:5.0) are (1.17 ± 0.08) × 10−4, (3.73 ± 0.68) × 10−4, (4.73 ± 0.57) × 10−4 and (1.25 ± 0.23) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When the blend ratio of P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM decreases from 1:3, to 1:4, and to 1:4.5, the hole mobilities of the blends increase monotonously. A further decreased blend ratio of 1:5.0 leads to decreased hole mobilities. These results are in agreement with the Jsc and PCE changes for the PSCs based on P3FTBT1O6. When the P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM blend ratio is 1:4.5, the active layer may have more balanced hole and electron mobilities which contributes to the high Jsc, FF and PCE. As a result, solar cells fabricated from P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM (1:4.5) achieved the best performance with a PCE of 5.73%, together with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 10.75 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 52.22%.
The J–V curves and the EQE spectra of P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, and P3FTBT8O6 are plotted in Fig. 5. The photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) are summarized in Table 2. P3FTBT1 was designed and obtained by replacing the two central hexyl chains on P3FTBT6 (Scheme 1) with the smallest alkyl groups (methyl). Compared to the P3FTBT6-based solar cell, the FF of the P3FTBT1-based device increases significantly from 44% to 51.65%, leading to an enhanced PCE of 5.39%. P3FTBT1F and P3FTBT1O6 were designed by incorporating F atoms or hexyloxy groups into the BT unit, respectively. A PCE of 5.73% with a Voc above 1.0 V was achieved for P3FTBT1O6-based solar cells. And the PSC fabricated from P3FTBT1F exhibits a PCE of 4.50% with a Voc up to 1.09 V (Table S4), which agrees with its deep-lying HOMO energy level. Whereas, the best performance device based on P3FTBT1F exhibits a PCE of 4.60% with a Voc of 1.08 V (Table S4). However, when the two hexyl chains were changed to the bulky 2-ethylhexyl chains, P3FTBT8O6 exhibits a low average PCE of 2.60% with a Voc of 1.03 V, an FF of 34.99% and a low Jsc of 7.24 mA cm−2. In comparison to P3FTBT1O6, the performance of PSCs based on P3FTBT8O6 declined sharply, due to bulky side chains which are not favourable for a good π–π packing. It is also supported by the lower hole mobilities obtained from both OFET and hole-only devices. It is worth noting that too many short alkyl chains may lead to poor solubility of the resulting copolymers. Therefore the other four hexyl chains are not changed to ensure that these polymers can be easily dissolved in common organic solvents. It is noted that the molecular weight of P3FTBT8O6 is relatively smaller compared to that of the other three copolymers which may be an additional factor responsible for its inferior device performance besides the side-chain difference.

The EQE curves of PSCs based on P3FTBT1O6 blended with PC71BM with various blend ratios and the other three polymers blended with PC71BM with a blend ratio of 1:4.5 are plotted in Fig. 3b and 5b, respectively. All PSCs show a photon response in the wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm which is in agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer:PC71BM blend films. As shown in Fig. 3b, in the whole photon response range, the EQE values of the devices fabricated from P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM (1:4.5, w/w) are higher than those of others. The EQE values of the P3FTBT8O6-based devices decrease sharply compared to those of other three polymer-based devices which agree with their low Jsc values. Integrating the EQE data with the AM 1.5 G spectrum gave calculated Jsc values of ∼9.47, 10.40, 10.60 and 9.83 mA cm−2 for the PSCs based on the P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM with various blend ratios (D:A = 1:3.0, 1:4.0, 1:4.5 and 1:5.0), respectively (Fig. 3b). These values are in good agreement with the measured Jsc values in Fig. 3a. The calculated Jsc values of PSCs based on P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, and P3FTBT8O6 are ∼10.01, 8.90, and 7.29 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5b), and they also match well with the measured Jsc values in Fig. 5a.


Nanoscale phase separation is required for the active layer in high performance PSCs, and it will provide a large interface area for exciton dissociation and, at the same time, a continuous percolating path for electron and hole transport to the corresponding electrodes. Therefore, tapping mode AFM was performed to investigate the surface morphology of the BHJ blend films and the results are shown in Fig. 6 and 7. Although the images of all the polymer blends show relatively flat surfaces and clear phase separation features, the domain size and phase separation feature of these blend films are affected by the fullerene:polymer blend ratio as well as the side chains of the polymers. Fig. 6 shows the topography and phase AFM images of P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM films cast with increasing amounts of PC71BM. The results demonstrate that the phase separation and domain size are sensitive to the blend ratio of P3FTBT1O6 to PC71BM. As the ratio of PC71BM to P3FTBT1O6 progressively increases from 3.0:1, to 4.0:1, and to 4.5:1, the nanoscale phase separation can be seen more clearly. However, when the ratio further increases to 5.0:1, the phase separation becomes less clear compared to that for the film with the 4.5:1 ratio. The most pronounced phase separation with an optimal domain size of ∼10–20 nm for the P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM film (1:4.5) is responsible for the highest PCE for the corresponding device as discussed in the previous section. Further, the morphology of the P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM (1:4.5) blend film was also studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the result is shown in Fig. S6. The higher electron density of PC71BM compared to that of P3FTBT1O6 causes electrons to be scattered more efficiently by the PC71BM from the TEM beam. Thus, the dark regions in Fig. S6 are attributed to PC71BM clusters, whereas the bright regions are assigned to P3FTBT1O6. The morphology of the blend film is generally uniform and there is no large phase separation. These TEM results reconfirm the nanoscale phase separation (∼10–20 nm) for the P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM layer. From Fig. 6 and 7, it is found that the domain size of the BHJ film is also dependent on the structure of the polymers. For example, strong nanoscale phase separation with domain sizes of around 10–20 nm can be found for the polymer blends based on P3FTBT1 and P3FTBT1O6, which is in favor of the high Jsc values of their corresponding solar cells. However, the phase separation for polymer blends based on P3FTBT1F and P3FTBT8O6 is less pronounced compared to that for the other two polymer blends, which contributes to the reduced PCEs for the corresponding devices.

It is found that P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM blend films with different blend ratios (D:A = 1:3.0, 1:4.0, 1:4.5 and 1:5.0) have root-mean-square (r.m.s.) surface roughness of 0.369, 0.426, 0.546 and 0.543 nm, respectively. The AFM measurements indicate the influence of blend ratios on the surface morphology of the active layers. The roughnesses of P3FTBT1:PC71BM (1:4.5), P3FTBT1F:PC71BM (1:4.5), P3FTBT8O6:PC71BM (1:4.5) and P3FTBT1O6:PC71BM (1:4.5) are 0.233, 0.509, 0.419 and 0.546 nm, respectively. The polymer blend film based on P3FTBT1 has the smoothest surface which is reasonable considering the least bulky side chains in the polymer backbone. And the polymer blend film based on P3FTBT8O6 has the roughest surface due to the most bulky alkyl chains. The results demonstrate that the morphology of polymer blends is closely related to the side chains used for the copolymers.

A series of ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene containing copolymers P3FTBT1, P3FTBT1F, P3FTBT8O6 and P3FTBT1O6 were designed and synthesized by side-chain tailoring. P3FTBT1O6 exhibits the highest PCE of 5.73% while combining a FF of 52.2% and a Voc of 1.02 V. However, the PCE of the P3FTBT8O6-based device declines sharply to 2.86%. The P3FTBT1F-based device shows a PCE of 4.50% with a high Voc of 1.09 V. These results indicate that the shortest methyl groups of the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene unit may contribute to a better morphology, a higher mobility as well as a higher PCE than the hexyl or 2-ethylhexyl substituted counterparts. The incorporation of F atoms into the BT unit afforded P3FTBT1F with a deeper-lying HOMO energy level and a high Voc of 1.09 V for the resulting PSC. The introduction of hexyloxy groups to the BT unit leads to P3FTBT1O6 with the best device performance. The results demonstrate that the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene containing copolymers are promising candidates for high efficiency PSCs with high Vocs. At the same time, these large band-gap (∼2.0 eV) copolymers can be used as short-wavelength absorbing materials for tandem solar cells with high Vocs.
