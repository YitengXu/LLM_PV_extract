The effect mechanism of triphenyl phosphate (TPP) is studied as an effective and inexpensive additive in the electrolyte of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) performance. The N719- and TPA-sensitized devices with a modified electrolyte show high efficiencies of 7.04% and 2.73% under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, respectively. The enhancement in Voc arises from increasing electron density in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 that leads to a shift in the Fermi level (EF) and thereby a suppression in electron recombination occurs. Electrochemical and spectroscopic data exhibit slower electron recombination and indicates that TPP forms a charge transfer complex with iodine in the electrolyte. This complexation decreases the concentration of free triiodide and limits the electron recombination so that it improves Jsc. Furthermore, the results reveal that TPP is a suitable inexpensive alternative for 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) additive in the DSSCs. We replaced TBP with TPP in DSSC based on TPA dye and observed an 73% increase in η compared to the blank electrolyte (without additive). Also, we investigate the effects of substituents in the phosphate additive structure on the photovoltaic properties by comparing our findings with previous work and found that the aliphatic phosphate additives exhibit a better performance compared to aromatic phosphate additives in the DSSCs.

During the previous decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received worldwide attention in many investigations. The common choices of photosensitizers for DSSCs based on a liquid electrolyte are ruthenium polypyridine complexes such as cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719), cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) (N3) and tri(thiocyanato) (4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) ruthenium(II) (black dye) because of their broad absorption spectra and favorable photovoltaic performance. In the DSSCs based on a ruthenium sensitizer, the dye is one of the most expensive components because ruthenium is a rare metal. If Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes are replaced with organic sensitizers, then the cost of the device will be drastically low. So, in the past, N719 dye was the traditional choice as the photosensitizer for DSSC, but today, in numerous studies for optimizing electrolyte systems and electrodes, organic dyes are applied as sensitizer because of their simple synthesis methods, low cost and high molar extinction coefficients. Among the metal free organic sensitizers, triarylamine dyes have excellent electronic properties for applying as photosensitizer in DSSCs. In 2004, Yanagida et al. introduced the triarylamine unit as electron donor in organic dyes and attained an improvement in DSSC performance. The triarylamine unit in the dye structure acts as a good electron donor and has a non-planar structure. Also, the TPA unit prevents unfavorable dye aggregation at the TiO2 surface. So, a large number of triarylamine dyes have been served as efficient light harvesters for DSSCs that have an electron-accepting group (carboxylic group) to bounding to the titania surface. In comparison with the great studies that are focused on the design and application of different dyes with high performance in DSSCs, extensive research have not been devoted to modified redox mediators. Since Gratzel and O'Regan reported a conversion efficiency of 11% for dye-sensitized solar cell by using iodide/triiodide electrolyte in 1991, in many investigations, this redox couple is used as mediator with multitude of solvents and various additives. It is important to note that the unique properties of the iodine electron mediator rely on sluggish electron recombination reaction and fast dye regeneration.

In DSSCs, electron recombination is one of the great challenges, because it diminishes the electron transfer which leads to decrease in the photovoltaic performance. The main electron recombination path is the back reaction of electron from conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to the oxidized species in the electrolyte solution. Adding additives into the standard electrolyte is a simple approach to suppress the electron recombination process. Additives can play a momentous role to enhance short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs. Additives can change the position of the Fermi level (EF) of semiconductor or redox couple potential, interfacial charge transfer and recombination kinetic. Also, it is believed that these compounds act as Lewis base and increase the Voc when they adsorb onto the surface of the TiO2 by shifting the CB in TiO2 semiconductor. Thus, the negative shift of the CB arises from accumulation of electrons in the CB of TiO2. Also, it is confirmed that some additives can form a charge transfer complex with iodine molecule and shifts the redox couple potential. Since 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was used as additive for iodide/triiodide electrolyte, during the last years, various efforts have been intensively paid to apply some functional organic compounds as additives into the electrolyte systems. Recently, tributyl phosphate (TBPP) has been introduced as efficient additive for iodide/triiodide system to modify the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface. In this paper, we have focused on the study of the effects of triphenyl phosphate (TPP) in the iodide/triiodide electrolyte, as another phosphate additive, using two different dyes (2-cyano-3-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)acrylic acid (TPA) and N719) on the DSSC performance. Based on this modified electrolyte, the efficiencies of the N719-sensitized and organic dye TPA-sensitized DSSCs under standard illumination condition (100 mW cm−2) are 7.04% and 2.73%, respectively. Also, when TBP is replaced with TPP in the DSSCs based on TPA dye, a significant increase in η (18%) is observed compared to the cell with electrolyte containing only TBP additive. Our results reveal that TPP is a suitable inexpensive alternative for TBP in the DSSCs.
We carefully investigated details and discussed on the influence of TPP additive on the electron recombination process in the electrode/dye/electrolyte interface. The origin of the increase in Voc and Jsc is explained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Based on UV-vis and FT-IR results, it guessed TPP can form a charge transfer complex with iodine molecule in the electrolyte.
On the other hand, in this study, in order to introduce another phosphate additive in the iodide/triiodide redox couple for DSSCs, we investigate the effects of substituents in phosphate additive structure on the photovoltaic properties. The findings for TPP additive are compared to our data in previous work for TBPP. It is found that the phosphate additives with substituent of aliphatic group may exhibit a better effect on the cell performance compared to aromatic phosphate additives. This study is an effort to get a deeper understanding of the phosphate additives performance and can be useful for the manufacturing of low cost and high efficiency DSSCs.

All the reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Merck company. Acetonitrile was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves for 24 h prior to use. The FTO glass substrates (transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 8 Ω per square, 2.3 mm thickness), N719 dye and surlyn spacer (30 μm) were obtained from Dyesol (Australia).


UV-vis spectra of the solutions were measured on a GBC cintra 6 UV-visible spectrophotometer. FT-IR spectra were recorded using the KBr pellets on a Magna 550 Nicolet spectrometer. 1H NMR spectrum of the dye was obtained using Bruker DPX-400 MHz NMR spectrometer with DMSO-d6 as solvent.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out with a Sama 500 potentiostat (Isfahan, Iran) using a three electrode system consist of a glass carbon working electrode (2 mm diameter), a Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat.) reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode. A solution of 0.1 M of lithium perchlorate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in dry acetonitrile was used as supporting electrolyte. The EIS spectra were measured using potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 100, Autolab, Eco-Chemie) under AM 1.5 G simulated light (Luzchem). The EIS spectra were scanned in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 500 kHz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV at room temperature. Photovoltaic measurements using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). The impedance spectra were fitted by Z-view software (v2.9c, Scribner Associates Inc) using equivalent circuit diagram. The samples were analyzed by PhilipsXL-30ESEM scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).

(4-Diphenylamino)benzaldehyde was purchased Sigma-Aldrich company. A solution of (4-diphenylamino)benzaldehyde (0.74 mmol, 205 mg), cyanoacetic acid (1.49 mmol, 127 mg) and a few drops of piperidine (1.12 mmol, 95 mg) in acetonitrile (15 mL) was heated at reflux temperature for 12 h at argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting precipitate was extracted with dichloromethane and 0.1 M HCl solution. Organic phase was collected and purified by silica gel column chromatography with dichloromethane/methanol (6:1, v/v) as eluent to give TPA dye (146 mg, yield 71%) as a yellow powder (Fig. 1).

To prepare TiO2 paste, 1 g of TiO2 (P25, Degussa, Germany) was added into a mixture of acetic acid (0.2 mL), deionized water (2 mL), ethanol (10 mL), terpineol (2 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 mL, 10 wt% solution in ethanol) to form a slurry solution and then followed by sonication for 15 min. To concentrate the paste, it was vigorously stirred at room temperature for two days to form a viscous white TiO2 paste. After cleaning the FTO glass, it was treated with a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Then a TiO2 paste was coated onto the FTO surface using the doctor blade technique. In this study, two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto FTO glass and used as photoelectrode. The TiO2 films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the TiO2 films were immersed into an aqueous solution of 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution in an oven at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water and then calcining at 500 °C for 30 min. The prepared thin film electrodes were immersed in the respective dye solutions (0.3 mM of TPA dye in THF for 2 h and 0.4 mM for N719 in a mixture of tert-butanol (t-BuOH) and acetonitrile (AN) (1:1 v/v) for 24 h) at room temperature in the dark. After dye loading, the TiO2 films were rinsed with THF and assembled with Pt counter electrodes that were prepared by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg in 1 mL of ethanol) and heating at 400 °C for 15 min. To fabricate the DSSCs, the dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a cell of sandwich type and sealed with a 30 μm Surlyn spacer. The electrolytes employed were a solution of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 0.6 M 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (BDMII) and different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 M) of TPP additive in dry acetonitrile. The TiO2/TPP film for EDS was prepared in the following way. The TiO2 film was immersed in a 1 M TPP acetonitrile solution for 2 h and then rinsed with acetonitrile two times and dried at room temperature.


For designing an efficient organic sensitizer in DSSCs, dye aggregation on the semiconductor surface is essential basic characteristic that should be attention. We can prevent unfavorable dye aggregation on the TiO2 semiconductor surface through optimization of dye structure by anchoring special groups in their structure or addition of co-adsorber to the dye solution. Cyanoacrylic acid group acts as a suitable acceptor anchoring group to constitute the D–π–A structure in the photosensitizer that has a strong bind onto the TiO2 surface. Also, the electronic and steric properties of triphenylamine unit in the dye structure prevent dye aggregation on the semiconductor surface.

In our study, we sensitized a triphenylamine dye as a low cost dye with a short synthesis route and simple structure for using in DSSCs. To gain further insight into the electronic properties of the TPA dye, DFT (density functional theory) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The optimized geometry of TPA (Fig. 2) indicates that the three phenyl rings in the TPA cores are non-planar, which is beneficial for restraint from the dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface and the electron recombination from CB to triiodide ions in the electrolyte solution. Also, Fig. 2 show the frontier orbital plots of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the TPA dye. At the ground state of the dye (HOMO), the electron density homogeneously distributes on electron-donor moiety (triphenylamine unit), whereas at the LUMO, electron density locates at the electron-acceptor moiety (cyanoacrylic acid). EHOMO and ELUMO values of TPA dye are well-matched with the EF of the TiO2 semiconductor and electrolyte potential. All spectral and electrochemical properties of TPA dye are summarized in Table 1 from ref. 21.

All devices were fabricated using the TPA and N719 sensitizers, a thin transparent double-layer TiO2 (P25) (about 14 μm) as the photoanode, the iodide/triiodide redox shuttle consist of TPP additive and Pt-coated FTO glass as cathode. The effect of TPP concentration on the photovoltaic performance of the devices made from the TPA dye was studied (at seven concentrations of TPP within a broad range (0–2 M)). Fig. 3 shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves for all concentrations of TPP in the electrolyte solution. The detailed output photovoltaic parameters of open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, fill factor (FF) and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 2. From the results for DSSCs based on TPA dye, it is clear that the increase of TPP concentration in the electrolyte solution improves Voc and Jsc under simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. The Jsc, Voc and FF of the DSSC based on electrolyte with 0.05 M of TPP are 5.57 mA cm−2, 0.68 V and 0.670, respectively, affording a η of 2.54%.

Among the above tested concentrations for TPA dye, the DSSC performance reaches the optimal value (2.73%) when the TPP in 1 M concentration is used as additive. In this concentration of TPP, an 21% increase in Jsc along with an 11% increase in Voc are observed. These increases are responsible for obtained improvement which is about 24% increase in efficiency (2.73%) compared to standard electrolyte (2.21%). Although the further addition of TPP in liquid electrolyte from 1 to 2 M causes a decrease in the energy conversion efficiency of DSSC from 2.73% to 2.36%. The cell based on electrolyte with 2 M of TPP additive shows a Voc of 0.72 V, a FF of 0.621 and a lower efficiency (2.36%), which this decrease in η is attributed to lower Jsc of 5.28 mA cm−2. High concentration of TPP (2 M) leads to a decrease in the concentration of the other components. This decrease diminishes the electron transfer and reduces Jsc, as well. Dependence of DSSC photovoltaic parameters on the TPP concentration present in the electrolyte are shown in Fig. 4. Interestingly, an increase in both Jsc and Voc is observed for electrolytes containing TPP less than 2 M (Fig. 4a and b) compared to standard electrolyte.
For comparison, the DSSCs based on N719 dye with 0 and 1 M of TPP in the electrolyte are fabricated and their I–V curves are shown in Fig. 5. We applied the best concentration of TPP additive (1 M) for DSSC based on N719. As listed in Table 2, DSSC based on N719 with modified electrolyte shows a high improvement in power conversion efficiency that not only is due to the increase in Jsc but also in Voc. For N719, 1 M TPP increases the photovoltaic performance significantly: Jsc augments from 13.85 to 18.70 mA cm−2, Voc increases from 0.69 to 0.71 V and the power conversion efficiency enhances from 6.03% to 7.04%.
In the recent years, many researchers focus on the replacement pyridine derivatives with inexpensive efficient additives. Thus, in this manuscript, we study the effect mechanisms of TPP and TBP additives on the cell performance. The electrolyte are composed of TBP (0, 0.5 M) and TPP (0, 1 M). The I–V curves for the DSSCs with electrolyte A (without additive), electrolyte B or standard electrolyte (with 0.5 M TBP), electrolyte C (with 1 M TPP) and electrolyte D (with 0.5 M TBP and 1 M TPP) measured at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are presented in Fig. 6 and their photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 3. The addition of TBP into the electrolyte leads to an 36% increase in Voc and an 14% improvement in Jsc, that are responsible for the obtained efficiency enhancement (from 1.51% (electrolyte A) to 2.21% (with electrolyte B)).

Addition of TBP leads to an 46% increase in η compared to blank cell. When TBP is replaced with TPP, a significant improvement in both Jsc and Voc is observed compared to the cell with electrolyte A. The Jsc, Voc and FF of the DSSC based on electrolyte C are 7.14 mA cm−2, 0.71 V and 0.515, respectively, affording a η of 2.61%. We observe an 54% increase in Jsc along with an 34% enhancement in Voc, thereby, a 73% increase in η compared to the cell with electrolyte A (without additive).
These results show that TPP has dramatically effect on Jsc and Voc. As a comparison, from Table 3, it can be noted that the electrolyte containing only TBP presents a η value (2.21%) lower than that of device based on the electrolyte containing only TPP additive (2.61%) and we observe a significant increase in η (18%). Our results show that TPP is effective and inexpensive alternative additive for TBP in the DSSCs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was studied to further understand the effect of TPP additive content in the electrolyte solution on the electron recombination and interfacial charge transport processes in the DSSCs. The EIS spectra were measured at a forward bias of ∼0.70 V near the open circuit voltage. Fig. 7 shows Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit diagram (inset) of the DSSCs based on TPA dye with standard electrolyte and modified electrolytes in different concentrations of TPP. For N719 dye, the EIS spectra of the device with the best concentration of additive and standard electrolyte were studied (Fig. 8). Each of the Nyquist plots contains two semicircles. The smaller semicircle at the higher frequency (left) region reflects the resistance at the interface between the counter electrode and electrolyte (RCE) and the larger semicircle in the lower frequency (right) region is attributed to the charge transfer resistance at the dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface resistance (RCT). RCT is related to charge recombination process from the CB of TiO2 to the oxidized ions in the electrolyte solution. The RCT value is estimated by the real component radius of the fitted larger semicircle. These estimated and calculated EIS parameters have been listed in Table 4. In the equivalent circuit for EIS, CPE1 is attributed to the dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface.

Also, we can determine some important parameters for the devices by using EIS measurements. For example, the electron lifetime in the CB of TiO2 (τ) that is expressing the electron recombination between the TiO2 and electrolyte can be extracted from the angular frequency (ωmax) at the second semicircles in the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs (eqn (1)):

τ = 1/ωmax

(1)
The keff is the reaction rate constant for the electron recombination process with triiodide ion in the electrolyte that can be expressed by eqn (2):

keff = 1/τ

(2)
Also Deff and ns are effective diffusion coefficient of electrons and electron density in the CB of TiO2, respectively, that obtain from EIS parameters. As shown in Table 4, for TPA and N719 dyes, the values of RCT for DSSCs in presence of TPP additive in the electrolyte are more than standard cell. In the DSSC based on TPA dye, the RCT value increases from ∼9.8 Ω cm2 to ∼16.6 Ω cm2 when standard electrolyte is replaced by modified electrolyte with TPP in concentration of 1 M. It means that the electron recombination process is further suppressed by adding more TPP. Also, for N719 dye, the fitted value of RCT for device with modified electrolyte is found ∼7.1 Ω cm2, while the corresponding value for cell with standard electrolyte is ∼5.4 Ω cm2.
When TPP is added to the electrolyte, the τ and ns values are larger compared to the standard electrolyte (Fig. 9a and b). These results indicate that the electron recombination is effectively suppressed by the adsorption of TPP on the TiO2 surface. As can be seen, the presence of TPP additive in the electrolyte solution in the DSSCs induces slow recombination. For DSSCs, it shows similar recombination lifetimes, at light bias equal to Voc, the recombination is much slower in presence of TPP additive.
To investigate the chemical interactions between TiO2 and TPP, we study EDS of TiO2/TPP (Fig. 10). This spectrum reveals the presence C and P elements and confirms the TPP layer on the surface of the TiO2 film. EDS spectrum is a evidence that confirms TPP can have an interaction with the TiO2 surface.
So, the higher CPE1 at interfacial of TiO2 and electrolyte is originated from the interaction between the phosphate group and titanium(IV) of TiO2 that leads to an arrangement of positive charge (on phosphorous atom in TPP) and negative charge (on titanium center in TiO2) (Fig. 11).
The results in Table 4 clearly show that one of the major reasons for the increase in η for TPA and N719 based DSSCs is the slower recombination dynamics that is due to the presence of TPP additive. In our previous work, a similar result for the devices based on iodide/triiodide electrolyte with tributyl phosphate additive was obtained.

The influence of TPP additive on the kinetics between the triiodide and iodide ions in the electrolyte was studied by CV measurement. Fig. 12 represents the CV curves of the standard and modified electrolytes that are referred to the equilibrium potential of the iodide/triiodide couple. The CV curves were scanned from 0 to 1.6 V. The redox peaks at more positive potentials are attributed to the reaction of eqn (3) which is assigned to oxidation of iodide, and the redox peaks at less positive potentials are related to eqn (4) which is correlated to reduction of triiodide:


3I− ⇄ I3− + 2e−

(3)

2I3− ⇄ 3I2 + 2e−

(4)
It is seen when the concentration of TPP in the electrolyte increases, the anodic peak currents decrease while the anodic and cathodic peak potentials shift positively. It shows that the interaction existing between the TPP and redox couple can effect on the redox reaction so that, in the modified electrolyte, the oxidation of iodide ions and reduction of triiodide ions become difficult. These interactions may thus be a reason for decrease in concentration of free redox ions in the electrolyte solution.
We guess phenyl ring in the TPP additive has an interaction with redox couple to formation a charge transfer complex, because, in the previous study, we used tributyl phosphate as additive and observed an enhancement in efficiency, but the CV results indicated that TBPP molecule has any interaction with redox couple.
In order to further indication for interaction between the TPP and redox ions, we study the UV-vis spectra of solutions with different species of the electrolyte. Fig. 13 shows the absorption spectra of various compounds in acetonitrile at room temperature. The solution of iodide ion (shown as yellow line) shows no absorption band in the UV-visible region (275–700 nm) whereas for the iodine solution, three absorption bands are observed at 297, 367 and 460 nm. In the UV-vis spectra of iodide/iodine mixture solution, absorption bands are observed at 288 and 361 nm (two peaks). The triiodide ion is characterized by these absorption bands in UV-vis region that are related to electron transitions in this ion. The disappearance of the peak at 463 nm shows that the triiodide ion and iodide produce.
Among the mixture solutions containing TPP additive in Fig. 13, in the mixture of iodine and TPP in acetonitrile, the disappearance of the peak at 455 nm is due to the formation of [TPP·I2] complex. We suggest that the following reactions occur in the modified electrolyte according to eqn (5) and (6):

I3− ⇄ I− + I2

(5)

TPP + I2 → [TPP·I2]

(6)
The formation of charge transfer complex decreases the free concentration of triiodide and thereby a decrease in concentration of iodine occurs. Therefore, the presence of TPP not only shifts the EF position but also interacts with the redox couple that leads to a decrease in electron recombination and an increase in RCT, which can have positive effect on the Jsc value. It is seen there is an interaction between the π-system (phenyl ring) or oxygen atom in the PO group of TPP as electron donor and σ* of iodine as electron acceptor that leads to formation a charge transfer complex (Fig. 14).
The formation of this charge transfer complex can be proved by comparing the UV-vis spectra of solution containing iodine molecule and TPP additive. It shows that the phenyl ring in additive structure has a main effect on the formation of charge transfer complex. So, we found that the structure of phosphate additive is effective on the properties of the electrolyte and the DSSC performance.
The UV-vis results agree with the CV data. In the following section, we study the FT-IR spectra to determine the structure of charge transfer complex.

To further investigate the interaction between TPP additive and iodine molecule, we study the FT-IR spectra of the TPP (Fig. 15a) and the mixture consist of TPP and iodine (Fig. 15b). The FT-IR spectrum of TPP shows the typical two bands of aromatic CC stretching vibration (1300 to 1660 cm−1) and C–H stretching modes (3000 to 3100 cm−1). A band at 1293 cm−1 can be contributed to the stretching band of PO and a strong band at 1178 cm−1 reflects P–O–C stretch. For the mixture of TPP and iodine, the stretching bands of PO and P–O–C shift to 1300 and 1188 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 15b). Based on the results of FT-IR, we can consider two possible interactions between the TPP and iodine molecule; oxygen of PO or phenyl groups of TPP can act as electron donors to the iodine molecules as electron acceptor (Fig. 14). Since a shift towards higher wavenumber is found, a phenyl–halogen interaction between the TPP and the halogen molecule is guessed (Fig. 14b).

As shown in Fig. 16, there are two resonance structures for TPP molecule. With interaction of the π-system as electron donor and σ* orbital of iodine as electron acceptor, structure (I) in Fig. 14 is further forming. Thus, the PO and P–O–C bonds become stronger and the ν (PO) and ν (P–C–O) increase. Also we observe a shoulder at the 1178 cm−1, next to the main peak at the 1188 cm−1, that it proves presence of the free phenyl rings in TPP molecule that have not any interaction with iodine molecule.
Noncovalent interactions of aryl or phenyl donors with halogens (X2 = Br2, I2) and structures of these molecular complexes have been investigated in many experimental and theoretical studies.
Based on the FT-IR result, it is deduced that a π-complex in the modified electrolyte with TPP additive forms. These results are according to the CV and UV-vis findings.

The most common additives used for iodide/triiodide electrolyte are pyridine and its derivatives. Most studies on DSSCs show adding these additives to the electrolytes enhances open circuit voltage of the DSSCs, while the short circuit current is much less affected. This fact is due to a position change in the EF of semiconductor or redox couple potential. It is well known that Voc is essentially determined by the difference between redox couple potential in the electrolyte and the EF level of TiO2 semiconductor. Therefore, the possible explanation for the enhancement of Voc is related to the shifting the EF and redox potential. In general, pyridine derivatives form stable molecular complexes with the iodide/triiodide ions in the electrolyte that is due to the electron donating properties of the nitrogen lone pair in these compounds. Recently, many organic nitrogenous compounds such as pyrimidine, aminopyridine, pyrrolidinopyridine and phenothiazine dendrimers have been used as additives to enhance the Voc and further results in an increased τ which eventually increases the efficiency of the DSSC. When we use the TPP additive, an improvement in both Jsc and Voc is observed for modified electrolytes (Tables 2 and 3). Therefore, we can consider an interaction of TPP with titanium(IV) in the TiO2 and iodine molecules in the electrolyte solution (Scheme 1). The binding TPP to the TiO2 surface and iodine can explain the photovoltaic and electrochemical results. The possible resonance structures for TPP molecule show the π bond of the phosphoryl group can break and its electron pair moves into the oxygen where it acts as electron donor to titanium(IV) in the TiO2 which is a Lewis acid. So, the positive charge places on phosphorus atom in the phosphate group. The interaction between the lone electron pair of oxygen atom in phosphate group and titanium(IV) forms P–O–Ti bond. This interaction leads to an arrangement of positive charge (on phosphorous atom in TPP) and negative charge (on titanium center in TiO2) that increases the CPE1 at interfacial of TiO2 and electrolyte (Fig. 11). The combined effects of electron donation of phosphoryl group and slower charge recombination lead to accumulation of electrons in the CB of TiO2. Electron recombination process has main role in reducing the ns in the CB of TiO2. According to EIS analysis, adding TPP to the electrolyte can enhance the τ and ns in the CB of TiO2 for DSSCs, which is due to a reduction in the rate of electron recombination from the EF of TiO2 to triodide ions. Increasing the ns for DSSCs can shift the EF in TiO2 and as a result improves Voc. The higher τ and ns reflect lower the electron recombination. Thus, the RCT increases in presence of TPP that shows a decrease in electron recombination in DSSCs that improves Jsc.

On the other hand, CV and UV-vis data show the TPP forms a charge transfer complex with iodine in the electrolyte solution. This complexation leads to a decrease in concentration and activity of redox ions. So, it reduces the electron recombination rate in the CB of TiO2 with triiodide ions in the electrolyte (Scheme 1). We can consider two structures for charge transfer complex (Fig. 14). For the [TPP·I2] complex, according to the FT-IR data, we guess formation of a π-complex in the modified electrolyte (Fig. 14b).
Our findings show TPP can improve DSSC performance through several ways: (1) the TPP can adsorb onto the TiO2 surface and acts as Lewis base that it increases the Voc by shifting the EF of TiO2 semiconductor, (2) by adsorbing of TPP onto the TiO2 surface, the electron recombination from the TiO2 to triiodide in the electrolyte decreases by preventing triiodide access to the semiconductor surface that can improve Voc and Jsc, (3) TPP forms a complex with redox couple in the electrolyte solution and a decrease in electron recombination is observed (Scheme 1) that increases Jsc.
Also, if we compare our results for TPP additive to the influence of TBPP in previously work, we will find that there is a correlation between the phosphate additive structure and the DSSC performance. When the phenyl group is applied in phosphate structure, a charge transfer complex with iodine molecule can form that decreases the activity of redox ions. Thus, phosphate additives with substituent of aliphatic group show a better effect on the cell performance compared to aromatic phosphate additives.

To summarize, we investigate the effects of the triphenyl phosphate additive on the performance of DSSCs. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements indicate that applying of TPP additive to the redox electrolyte of DSSCs leads to an increase in the Jsc and Voc. After optimization of the TPP concentration in the electrolyte, the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs based on TPA dye increases from 2.21% to 2.73% under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination. Using of TPP additive in DSSC sensitized with N719 results in slower recombination dynamics and an important increase in power conversion efficiency from 6.03% to 7.04%. This is attributed to an upward shift of the EF and an enhancement of the ns in the CB of TiO2, which increase the Voc value. The increase in the ns arises from electron donor property of phosphoryl group in TPP and lower electron recombination from the CB of TiO2 to the triiodide ions. On the other hand, the charge transfer complex formation between TPP and iodine decreases the concentration of free triiodide and thereby an increase in RCT and a decrease in electron recombination are observed, which can have positive effect on the Jsc. By comparing the DSSCs, the higher Jsc and Voc of devices with modified electrolyte are attributed to the slow electron recombination. It is confirmed that the TPP additive is effective on the dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface and the electrolyte solution. This impact in dyed-TiO2/electrolyte is on the surface charge and in the electrolyte solution is arose in charge transfer complex formation with iodine molecule. TPP decreases the recombination of electrons in the CB of TiO2 with triiodide in the electrolyte by complexation with iodine in the electrolyte and by preventing triiodide access to the TiO2 surface.

As we demonstrate herein, the results indicate that phosphate compounds are a promising generation of additives, which deserve further studies. This kind of simple electrolyte modifications allows us to tune the redox potential of the electrolyte and are very instructive in the future studies to design a variety of inexpensive additives with electron donor groups to obtain more efficient DSSCs.
