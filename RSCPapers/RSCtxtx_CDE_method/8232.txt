The ternary blending strategy of introducing a third component into binary organic solar cells (BOSCs) is a feasible and efficient strategy to optimize the performance of BOSCs. Ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs) have an adjustable absorption band for matching the solar light characteristics, easily adjustable photoelectric performance and tunable micro-morphology; therefore, they have become a hotspot in the field of OSC research. Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TOSCs has been boosted over 17%. Herein, we give a review on the four possible working mechanisms of TOSCs, roles of the third component in TOSCs, recent progress made in different kinds of active layer materials of TOSCs based on solution-processed non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), and recent advances in large-area TOSCs and their long-term stability. This review can provide some guidance for the further development of TOSCs. Finally, to help researchers understand the future of TOSCs, the challenges and prospects of TOSCs based on solution-processible NFAs have been provided.

Solar cells are a significant form of the utilization of solar energy that has emerged from the last century. They can be primarily classified into two categories: inorganic solar cells (IOSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). At present, IOSCs have achieved large-scale commercial applications due to the maturity of technical research in this field. Nevertheless, due to their high cost, high energy consumption, complicated processing technology, easily caused environmental pollution, and other disadvantages, its further promotion and application have been dramatically limited. Compared with IOSCs, OSCs have gained considerable attention in recent years due to their superiorities such as lightweight, low price, flexibility, transparency, and large-area production ability. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs has been increased to over 18%, and a PCE of 18.6% has been achieved for tandem OSCs. However, there is still a long distance to go from the viewpoint of realizing commercialization. The PCE of an OSC mainly depends on the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and incident optical power (Pin) of the device. The formula for calculating the PCE is as follows:
From the above formula, we can clearly see that enhancing the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the device are crucial strategies to boost the PCE of the OSCs. Nowadays, by mixing p-type organic donors (D) and n-type organic acceptors (A) to obtain an ordered bicontinuous interpenetrating network bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure has been the most popular method adopted in OSCs. Consequently, more excitons can reach the interface to achieve efficient charge separation and transport due to the shortened exciton diffusion distance. Because of its inherent light absorption characteristics, a single organic donor and acceptor of binary heterojunction OSCs have a narrow solar absorption spectrum, and they cannot fully absorb sunlight, which restricts further improvements in the PCE of OSCs.
In order to resolve this problem, ternary OSCs (TOSCs) have attracted increasing attention because they can achieve a wider solar absorption spectrum and higher absorption intensity by incorporating a small amount of a third component (usually a semiconductor material with a narrow bandgap) into the light-absorbing semiconductor material than binary OSCs (BOSCs). Moreover, the efficiency of exciton separation and charge collection in TOSCs can be dramatically increased by regulating the arrangement of molecules in the active layer. The structures of the active layers in the TOSCs are usually “D/A/A” or “D/D/A”. Typically, donor materials can be mainly divided into polymers and small organic molecules, while acceptor materials principally comprise fullerenes and non-fullerenes. Apart from the required complementary light absorption range of each component material in the active layer, the energy levels of the active layers should also be well matched with each other. Moreover, charge transport between the donor and acceptor should be in a balanced state as far as possible to ensure that the TOSCs yield the best performance. Fullerene and its derivatives have a unique three-dimensional conjugated structure. Hence, they have good electron-accepting characteristics and electron-transport properties, as well as form excellent electron acceptor materials. However, they also have some fatal defects, such as weak absorption of photons in the solar spectral range, difficulty in controlling the bandgap, and poor thermal stability. Therefore, non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials with matched energy levels, bandgap adjustability, and good thermal stability have been explored, and the PCEs of NFA-based devices have significantly exceeded those of the fullerene derivative counterparts. At present, the PCE of BHJ OSCs based on NFAs has reached 17%, and the highest value achieved has exceeded 18%.
Because of the unmatched absorption bands of the donor and NFA with regard to the solar spectrum, the solar absorption spectra of OSCs based on NFA can be considerably widened. TOSCs can not only expand the absorption spectra in tandem OSCs but also retain the characteristics of the simple processing of single-junction devices. Therefore, TOSCs can combine the advantages of both BOSCs and tandem OSCs. In recent years, because many novel NFAs have been successfully designed, NFA-based TOSCs have been widely investigated by appropriately selecting the three ingredients of the active layer via a ternary blending strategy. TOSCs can result in the enhanced absorption of complementary light regions by adjusting the ratio of the compositions, which has attracted increasing attention of researchers and has become a hotspot in the field of OSCs. The recent progress achieved with regard to the PCEs in some representative TOSCs based on NFAs is shown in Fig. 1. This review briefly introduces the working mechanism of TOSCs and the roles of the third component in TOSCs and then summarizes the different types of TOSCs based on NFAs and their latest progress. Finally, we conclude on the prospects and challenges in the development of TOSCs based on NFAs.

Compared with BOSCs, the charge transport mechanism in TOSCs is more complicated because of the presence of the third component. The process of charge transfer is related to many factors, and the distribution position of the third component in the active layer is the most critical one. If the third component is in between the donor and acceptor materials, the holes and electrons produced by the third component can be transported through the transmission channel of the host system, finally reaching the corresponding electrodes. Taylor et al. added the third component SQ to the P3HT:PCBM binary system and characterized the surface energies of SQ, P3HT, and PCBM. They found that the value of the surface energy of SQ was between those of P3HT and PCBM. At the same time, the TEM energy-dispersive X-ray element spectrum of the ternary blend film revealed that the SQ molecules were near the interpenetrating network structure of P3HT and tended to accumulate at the interface of the P3HT and PCBM molecules.

Meanwhile, the energy-level structure of the three components is also a determinant element affecting the mechanism of charge transfer. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the added third component should be situated between the corresponding donor and acceptor in the host system such that the system can form a cascade-energy-level alignment structure. As shown in Fig. 2, considering the example of TOSCs with the D1/D2/A structure, excitons generated by the donor (D1/D2) can form electrons and holes at the interface between D1 and A and that between D2 and A. The electrons are principally transported to D2 through D1 and then transported to A. Through the transmission channel of A, the electrons can be effectively collected by the cathode; further, the holes are first transferred to D1 through D2 and then transported to the anode from the transmission channel of D1 and are efficiently gathered by the anode. In general, the Voc of the TOSC device under the charge transfer mechanism is closer to the smaller one of the corresponding BOSC device, which should be attributed to the fact that almost all the holes can reach the anode through the transmission channel of the donor with a higher HOMO level. Usually, choosing complementary light absorption of the third component with the host binary system is a classic strategy to construct a TOSC. However, appropriately utilizing charge transfer is a new consideration to develop high-performance TOSCs. By incorporating ITIC-4F into the binary system of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC, Wang et al. explored a cascade-energy-level alignment structure among the PTB7-Th, COi8DFIC, and ITIC-4F molecules. Despite the fact that adding ITIC-4F did not obviously widen the absorption band of the active layer, pump–probe photoconductivity (PC) spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed that efficient charge transfer could be achieved due to the formation of a cascade-energy-level alignment. Because of this enhanced charge transfer, the PCE of the TOSC increased to 13.23% in contrast to the related BOSC with a PCE of 11.40%.

The process in which the energy donor molecules in the excited states transfer their energy to the energy acceptor molecules is called energy transfer. In TOSCs, a competitive relationship exists between the charge transfer and energy transfer processes. The emission spectrum of the energy donor should overlap with the absorption spectrum of the energy acceptor for realizing effective energy transfer. The energy transfer mechanism mainly includes two forms: Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET; long range and based on resonance) of electro-fluorescence and Dexter energy transfer (short range and based on electron exchange) of electro-phosphorescence. FRET primarily occurs through the long-range dipole–dipole-induced Coulomb interaction between the energy donor and energy acceptor materials. However, Dexter energy transfer mainly occurs through the electron-exchange interaction between the energy donor and energy acceptor materials. Since the radius of the energy transfer is limited, the distribution location of the energy donor and energy acceptor should be very close (<10 nm), which is analogous to the distribution requirements of the third component in the mechanism of charge transfer. The third component can not only act as the energy donor but can also serve as the energy acceptor.

The essential difference between the energy transfer mechanism and charge transfer mechanism is that the additional capturer of sunlight in the former does not immediately create photogenerated carriers. For example, if the third component serves as the energy donor, it does not directly generate excitons. Instead, the energy donor can absorb solar photons and transfer the photogenerated excited states to the “energy acceptor” (the host donor) and then the host donor generates more excitons resulting in a higher Jsc. The dominant function of the third component is to increase the capture efficiency of photons by the active layer, increase light absorption, and transfer these additional photogenerated excited states to the energy acceptor. If the third component acts as an energy acceptor, its position needs to not only be close to that of the energy donor but also be in contact with the donor or acceptor of the host system to dissociate the excitons produced in the energy acceptor. As shown in Fig. 3, for example, in the TOSCs with the D1/D2/A structure, the energy of the photogenerated exciton in D1 is first transferred to D2 through FRET or Dexter energy transfer. Then, the exciton generated in D2 dissociates at the interface between D2 and A, which can form electrons and holes. The electrons are transferred to the cathode by the transfer channel of A, and the holes in D2 can be directly transported to the anode, or they can be transferred to D1 and then transferred to the anode via the transport channel of D1. Chen et al. explored a moderate-bandgap small-molecule IT-4F as the third component and introduced it into the PBDB-T-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl binary blend. The host acceptor of IXIC-4Cl has a wide absorption region from 600 to 1000 nm, while IT-4F has a strong PL peak at 800 nm. The PL emission band of IT-4F is effectively overlapped with the absorption band of IXIC-4Cl. Furthermore, the emission spectrum of IT-4F in the acceptor blend film was effectively quenched, while there was an obvious improvement in that of IXIC-4Cl, illustrating a dominant energy transfer mechanism from IT-4F to IXIC-4Cl. Apart from the complementary absorption with the primary binary blend, IT-4F can also contribute toward inhibiting the excessive aggregation/crystallization of IXIC-4Cl molecules, which is beneficial for improving the morphology of the active layer. The multiple roles of IT-4F ensured that the TOSC could achieve a PCE as high as 14.96%.

Different from the charge transfer mechanism and energy transfer mechanism, the parallel linkage mechanism in TOSCs does not require complicated conditions. The energy levels, absorption spectra, and emission spectra between the third component and the host system do not require to be accurately matched. For the TOSCs based on the parallel linkage mechanism, by considering the example of TOSCs with the D1/D2/A structure (Fig. 4), there is no energy transfer and charge transfer between D1 and D2. Therefore, they resemble a parallel device. After being generated by their respective donors, the excitons diffuse to the corresponding donor–acceptor interface and then dissociate into free electrons and holes. The Jsc of these TOSCs can significantly increase and be equivalent to the sum of the Jsc values of the two subcells. The holes are transported through the hole transport channels of the corresponding donors, finally arriving at the anode to be effectively collected. The electrons are transported through the transmission channel of the acceptor and then they reach the cathode to be effectively collected. Therefore, the Voc of the device is between those of the two individual subcells. You et al. were the first to propose and verify the parallel linkage mechanism based on the two ternary systems of TAZ:DTBT:PCBM and DTffBT:DTPyT:PCBM. When the thickness (50 nm) of the active layer in the two subcells is half the thickness (100 nm) of the corresponding parallel-like bulk heterojunction (PBHJ) ternary solar cell and the two subcells with 50 nm-thick active layers contain approximately the same quantity of individual components as that in the corresponding PBHJ cells with 100 nm-thick active layers, it is revealed that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the TOSCs is close to that of the sum of each subcell, indicating that the free electrons and holes generated in each subcell are transported via their respective transfer channels and gathered by the electrodes. The Jsc of the TOSCs is almost equivalent to the sum of the two subcells with half the thickness of the active layer.


The alloy model mechanism was first presented by Thompson et al. This mechanism usually requires the third component to have excellent compatibility with the donor or acceptor of the host system. Unlike the parallel linkage mechanism, the two components based on the alloy model with similar electrical properties in the active layer can form an alloy state, thereby having a new mutual HOMO energy level and a new LUMO energy level. As shown in Fig. 5, considering the example of the TOSCs with the D1/D2/A structure, the energy level changes with a change in the mixing ratio of the two donors. Therefore, the Voc of the TOSCs also varies with the variation in the mixing proportion of the two donors, and the Jsc of the TOSCs can be enhanced because of the supplementary absorption band between the third component and the host system. By constructing an alloy-like model, Chen et al. explored a composite formed between Y6 and the novel derivative of BTP-M, and they added it as the third component to a PM6:Y6 binary system to construct a TOSC. Different from Y6, BTP-M replaced the electron-pulling F atom of Y6 with the electron-pushing methyl group to afford higher energy levels and lower crystallinity. Because of the similar chemical structure, BTP-M showed excellent compatibility with Y6 and had higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels in contrast to Y6. The compatible and similar electrical characteristics resulted in the formation of alloy-like models. Owing to the appropriate energy levels of the alloy, the energy loss was effectively reduced from 0.49 to 0.45 eV. Besides, the morphology of the TOSC was considerably optimized by the alloy model formed by Y6 and BTP-M and the slightly lower crystallinity of BTP-M resulted in achieving an excellent PCE of 17.03% with a Jsc of 26.56 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.875 V. The significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance could be chiefly attributed to the enhancement in the EQE and the reduction in energy loss.


In traditional BOSCs, it is difficult for a donor and an acceptor to cover a wide absorption range to make the full use of sunlight. Although the absorption boundary can be widened to the near-infrared (NIR) region, its absorption intensity cannot always be maintained at a high level. Consequently, the concept of TOSCs with the addition of the third component was proposed and turned into a research focus. One of the primary purposes of preparing TOSCs is to enhance the light-capturing ability of the BOSC by adding a third component, and the construction of a TOSC by searching or designing materials that are supplementary to the light absorption band of the BOSC has become a fundamental strategy. Dye molecules, small molecules, and polymer materials have been used as the third component to enhance the utilization of solar light. Although a fullerene acceptor has an excellent electron transport ability, its weak light absorption is in urgent need of resolution. The narrow light absorption range of the BOSCs with fullerene and its derivatives as acceptors has become a stumbling block to hamper any further improvements in the PCE. The currently studied NFAs not only have a strong light absorption coefficient but also possess a wide absorption range, and their absorption band can be broadened to the NIR region. Recently, Zhang et al. reported the preparation of a TOSC with PM6 as the donor and non-fullerene small-molecule IT-4F and Y6 as the acceptors, where the Jsc reached 25.40 mA cm−2 and their light absorption region could be extended to the NIR region of 300–1000 nm, which is in sharp contrast to the 300–900 nm region obtainable from a PM6:IT-4F device. The absorption range was effectively widened by about 100 nm, revealing that the excellent performances of NFAs could improve the light-capturing ability of binary systems.


The separation of excitons primarily occurs at the interface of the donor–acceptor material in the OSCs. To enhance the charge transfer efficiency, the donor and acceptor should have an appropriate energy level alignment and offset between the HOMO and LUMO. If this offset is too small, it cannot offer an adequate driving force for effective charge transfer. On the contrary, if the offset is too large, it can cause unnecessary energy loss, leading to a low Voc. Accordingly, to achieve high charge transfer efficiency, inserting an additional component into the BOSC of most TOSCs can be employed to form a cascade-energy-level alignment. For instance, Kim et al. introduced the fullerene tris-adduct compound of OXCTA into a BOSC with P3HT as the donor; the fullerene monoadduct compound of OXCMA served as the acceptor. Because the LUMO of OXCTA was located between those of P3HT and OXCMA, the synergistic bridging effect through the cascade-energy-level alignment of the three components was formed, as shown in Fig. 6. This effect promoted charge transfer, thereby contributing to the improvement in Jsc. Park et al. added a small amount of conjugated small molecules of BantHBT into the PBTADN:PC71BM binary system as the donor, forming a cascade-energy-level alignment, as shown in Fig. 6. The obtained appropriately aligned energy level could facilitate charge transfer. Therefore, the TOSC achieved a largely enhanced Jsc of 11.0 mA cm−2, which is significantly superior to the BOSC of PBTADN:PC71BM with a Jsc of 6.9 mA cm−2.

After the excitons dissociate from the donor–acceptor interface of the active layer, the charge carriers are formed. They can be transported through the electron transfer channel and hole transfer channel to the corresponding cathode and anode, respectively. Therefore, the process of balanced charge transfer exerts a crucial effect on the photovoltaic performance of the devices. At the same time, the low hole mobility of the polymer donors has become a fatal shortcomings that has restricted the development of OSCs. For resolving this, the addition of a high mobility material as an additive into the binary active layer has been proposed. Tai et al. prepared a high-mobility conjugated polymer of poly(N-(4-(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-2-yl)phenyl)-N,N′,N′-triphenyl-l,4-phenylenediamine) (PFLAM) and added it as an additive into the binary system of P3HT:PCBM; the hole mobility of PFLAM is as high as 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the electron mobility of PCBM. Moreover, the increase in the hole mobility of the device resulted in more balanced charge transfer, thereby enhancing the charge transfer efficiency of the system. As a consequence, the TOSC afforded a PEC of 3.31%, which is much higher than the counterpart BOSC with a PCE of 2.47%. Li et al. introduced the high-hole-mobility narrow-bandgap polymer of DPPT-TT based on pyrrolopyrroledione into the binary system of P3HT:PC71BM as an additive. When the amount of the added DPPT-TT was 0.5 wt%, the hole mobility (μh) of the device was enhanced from 3.67 × 10−4 to 5.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the electron mobility (μe) was adjusted from 7.38 × 10−4 to 5.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 relative to those of the BOSC. Hence, more balanced μe/μh of 0.95 was achieved than that of 0.50 for the corresponding BOSC. The more balanced electron and hole mobility of the device is favorable for charge transfer and collection and the utilization of excitons, thereby contributing to the improvement in the PCE of the TOSC.

It is well known that the photoelectric property of the OSCs is largely affected by the microstructure morphology of the active layer. In BOSCs, addition agents such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1,8-octanedithiol (OT), and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) are often used to optimize the morphology of the OSC and improve the crystallinity of the system. Although certain types of additives can be removed by some methods, some types of additives may remain in the blend film and become traps. These traps can prominently hinder charge separation and transfer. Accordingly, adjusting the morphology of the blend film by adding a donor or acceptor as the third component instead of a traditional additive has been proposed. Furthermore, the synergy among the different molecules (such as blending polymers and small organic molecules) can be utilized to control the location and alignment of the different component molecules within the active layer of the TOSC. An appropriate design and selection of the material of the third component can effectively adjust the phase separation scale, phase purity, and molecular packing arrangement of the different components inside the active layer. Meanwhile, the active layer with multiple subphase separations is more beneficial to the efficient separation of excitons, charge transfer, and charge collection. By fine-tuning the aggregation of molecules, the charge transfer of the TOSCs can be strongly improved, thereby enhancing the PCE of the device.

As an example, the classic electron acceptor of PCBM tends to aggregate in the traditional BHJ binary blended active layer, which can not only destroy the morphology of the active layer but also decrease the PCE of the device. Kästner et al. designed an amorphous and semicrystalline copolymer, AnE-PVba, and employed it as the additional donor to prepare a TOSC device based on the AnE-PVab:AnE-PVba:PCBM blend. Intriguingly, the appropriate introduction of AnE-PVba could result in the improved morphology of the active layer. In contrast to the larger domain size originating from the aggregation of PCBM in the binary system, the addition of 10 wt% amorphous AnE-PVba could effectively decrease the RMS surface roughness of the film due to the intense intermixing of AnE-PVba and PCBM and could impede the aggregation of PCBM. However, coarse-grained morphology was obtained as the AnE-PVba ratio was further increased because of the formation of a single phase. Interestingly, when the weight ratio of AnE-PVba exceeded 70%, the surface of the blend film became smooth again. Consequently, the combination of highly ordered semicrystalline AnE-PVba with 10 wt% amorphous AnE-PVba formed the beneficial BHJ morphology, which could increase the PCE from 3.85% to 4.03%. To further understand the complicated relationships between the blend morphologies with the photovoltaic performance, Ma et al. added the small-molecule BDT-3TCNCOO into the PBDTTPD-HT/PC71BM system and fabricated a TOSC. From the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) results, the existence of BDT-3TCNCOO could be facilitated to form the purer PBDTTPD-HT-rich:PC71BM domains. Simultaneously, the presence of PBDTTPD-HT could also contribute toward the formation of the purer BDT-3TCNCOO-rich PC71BM domains. Appropriate size and the purest phase were obtained for both PBDTTPD-HT-rich and BDT-3TCNCOO-rich domains with the addition of 40% BDT-3TCNCOO. Meanwhile, the optimal face-on orientation and π–π stacking of the active layer could be achieved with 40% BDT-3TCNCOO. The better π–π stacking of the blends was beneficial for hole transport, and the purer PBDTTPD-HT-rich and BDT-3TCNCOO-rich domains were favorable for increasing the charge transfer efficiency and decrease the number of bimolecular recombinations. As a result, with the introduction of 40% BDT-3TCNCOO, the PCE value of the device was considerably enhanced from 6.85% to 8.40% along with a dramatic enhancement in the FF from 58.14% to 71.25%. The largely enhanced FF can be attributed to the efficient charge transport and decreased bimolecular recombination, which are benefited by improvements in the blend morphologies.
Besides, the compatibility of the third component with the host system is also very crucial for optimizing the morphology of TOSCs. Lu et al. introduced poly(5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole-alt-quaterthiophene) (PPor-2) with porphyrin side groups and utilized it as the additional component in the BOSC of PTB7-Th:PC71BM to prepare the TOSC. Because good compatibility, strong layer interaction, and similar fullerene packing density between PPor-2 and PTB7-Th could be obtained, the morphology of the TOSC was considerably optimized. Therefore, an FF of 69% and high PCE of 9.0% could be achieved. To gain a deeper understanding into the effect of the compatibility of the third component on the morphologies of the TOSC blends and the performances of TOSCs, Hao et al. employed PBDB-T as an additional donor to improve the PCE of the DRCN5T:PC71BM binary system. The GIWAXS results revealed that the (010) π–π-stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction became much stronger and in the in-plane direction became much weaker with an increase in the doping ratio of PBDB-T (from 10 to 40 wt%), suggesting that more molecules with the face-on packing orientation of the active layer were present. The face-on arrangement of the blend was favorable for charge transfer along the perpendicular direction. Moreover, the coherence length was also broadened from 4.30 to 4.53 nm with the addition of PBDB-T from 0 to 40 wt%, revealing that the insertion of PBDB-T could efficiently promote the π–π-stacking interaction of the blend films. To learn more about the addition of PBDB-T on the RMS roughness and compatibility of the active layer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the blend films with varying PBDB-T ratios (from 0 to 100 wt%) was performed. The DRCN5T:PC71BM host blend film showed homogeneous and smooth morphology with an RMS roughness value of 0.63 nm, and the value of the RMS roughness values of the blend film were slightly enhanced to 0.97, 1.07, 1.10, 1.16, and 1.70 nm with the addition of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 100 wt% PBDBT, respectively. These results demonstrated that the outstanding compatibility and miscibility was achieved between PBDB-T and the PBDB-T polymer, which could be used to modulate and optimize the crystallinity and molecular orientation of DRCN5T and the phase separation of the blend films to form a bicontinuous interpenetrating network nanostructure. Accordingly, with the addition of 20 wt% PBDBT, the PCE of the device was enhanced from 7.74% to 9.45% along with an obvious enhancement in the FF from 58.56% to 65.72%.

Recently, various kinds of NFAs have been gradually designed and prepared. In 2014, McCulloch's group explored the new NFA of 5,5′-[(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-7,4-diylmethyl-idyne)]bis[3-ethyl-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone] (FBR, as shown in Fig. 7). When it was blended with the P3HT donor, the BOSC yielded a PCE of 4.1%. Subsequently, an acceptor (O-IDTBR) having a narrower bandgap and complementary UV-visible absorption was synthesized by this group, and the PCE of the device based on P3HT:O-IDTBR was increased to 6.4%. In 2015, Zhan et al. prepared the new electron acceptor of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetra-kis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']-dithiophene (ITIC), which exhibited good absorption in the visible and NIR ranges. The energy levels of ITIC match well with the narrow-bandgap PTB7-Th donor. The PCE of the device with PTB7-Th:ITIC is 6.80%, which is slightly higher than that of the OSC with a PTB7-Th:PC61BM active layer (i.e., 6.05%). In 2016, Hou et al. reported the new acceptor of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5-methylinda-none))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno [2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (IT-M); the PBDB-T:IT-M device afforded the maximum PCE of 12.05%. Soon after, Hou et al. optimized the structure and explored a new non-fullerene small-molecule 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F) and a novel PBDB-T-SF polymer donor. The PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F device afforded an inspiring PCE of 13.1%. In 2019, Zou's group developed a promising acceptor Y6 with dithiothiophene[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole as the core. The binary BHJ OSC based on the PM6:Y6 system afforded a remarkable PCE of 15.7%, with a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.8%. Such a notable photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the broadened absorption and high charge carrier mobility. The compound structures of the NFAs in this part are shown in Fig. 7. The rapid development of NFAs has laid the foundation for the prompt rise of TOSCs based on the NFAs. The introduction of highly efficient NFAs into BOSCs via the ternary blending strategy has attracted increasing attention. Next, we will briefly summarize three kinds of TOSCs: TOSCs based on polymer donor/fullerene acceptor/NFA, TOSCs based on two polymer donors/NFA, and TOSCs based on polymer donor/two NFAs.


Fullerene has the characteristics of low reorganization energy and high reduction potential, which can accelerate the transfer of photoinduced charge and simultaneously avoid the return of electrons. Therefore, it can be used as an acceptor material for OSCs. However, the fullerene acceptor has poor absorption ability and limited ability to control the energy level. Compared with the fullerene acceptor, NFA has stronger absorption, easily adjustable energy level, and better solution solubility. However, its low electron mobility, inevitable recombination energy loss, and poor film morphology caused by the aggregation among organic molecules are its shortcomings. As a result, by taking advantage of their merits, it is very meaningful to use both fullerene derivatives and NFAs as acceptors for constructing a TOSC. Cho et al. prepared a ternary photovoltaic device by introducing the small-molecule acceptor (SMA) of IDT2BR with the core of indacenodithiophene (IDT) into the binary system of PPDT2FBT:PC71BM as an additional acceptor (the corresponding chemical structures are shown in Fig. 8). IDT2BR has superior compatibility with PC71BM and can form an acceptor alloy. The energy state of the active layer can be easily adjusted by changing its addition ratio. The PL and EQE data revealed that the cascade-energy-level alignment structure of the three components could efficiently transfer the photogenerated charge from the PPDT2FBT polymer to IDT2BR and then from IDT2BR to PC71BM, ensuring the high efficiency of the photogenerated charge transfer in the device and therefore affording a PCE of 9.02% (the specific device performances are listed in Table 1).

Utilizing the fullerene acceptor of PC71BM as an additional acceptor, Lu et al. fabricated a TOSC based on PBDB-T:PC71BM:ITIC. The vertical phase distribution of PBDB-T and ITIC could be effectively tuned after the addition of PC71BM in the TOSC, and the crystallinity of PBDB-T in the vertical direction could be improved. The phase morphologies of PBDB-T and ITIC on the top and bottom of the ternary blend film were also optimized, which could dramatically facilitate the transport of charge carriers to the corresponding electrodes. Moreover, the π–π-stacking coherence lengths of both PBDB-T and ITIC could be increased with the addition of PC71BM. Consequently, in sharp contrast to the corresponding BOSC, the Jsc, FF, and PCE of the TOSC increased from 15.9 mA cm−2, 65.6%, and 9.6% to 17.7 mA cm−2, 68.3%, and 11.0%, respectively. Li et al. adopted PC71BM as the additional acceptor into the BOSC consisting of the D/A copolymer of PTBTz-2 (ref. 75) as the donor and small-molecule IT-M as the acceptor. Although IT-M and PC71BM have completely different chemical structures, the synergistic effect between them can widen the absorption band of the system and improve the crystallinity. Furthermore, a FRET process exists between IT-M and PC71BM. Two acceptors with huge structural differences can optimize the process of charge generation, separation, and collection by combining their respective advantages, thereby increasing the PCE of the device from 10.39% to 12.28%. Xiao et al. introduced N2200-F to improve the performance of the BOSC and fabricated a TOSC based on PM6:PC71BM:N2200-F. In contrast to the BOSC, the complementary absorption of PC71BM and N2200-F enhanced the Jsc from 12.26 to 13.01 mA cm−2. The rise in hole mobility and morphology optimization in TOSC contributed to the increase in the FF from 67% to 69%. When the ratio of N2200-F in the acceptor was 30 wt%, the TOSC afforded a PCE of 8.11%.
After the hard work of many research groups, the PCE of BOSCs with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system was boosted to 10%. However, it still cannot meet the requirements of commercialization. In recent years, TOSCs with PTB7-Th and PC71BM as the main system, incorporating NFA as the third component, have been widely reported. It is well known that a trade-off relationship usually exists between the Jsc and Voc of TOSCs. However, the simultaneous enhancement in the Jsc, Voc, and FF can only be achieved with the proper introduction of the third donor/acceptor component due to the coexistence of several working mechanisms of TOSCs. To realize the simultaneous increase in the main parameters, namely, Jsc, Voc, and FF, Yang et al. added IT-M NFA into the binary host system of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The dramatic enhancement in the PCE could be partially attributed to the widened light absorption range owing to the complementary absorption band between the IT-M and PTB7-Th:PC71BM and the improved morphology. Meanwhile, the successful selection of the third component, namely, IT-M, which has a slightly higher LUMO energy level of −3.91 eV compared with the −4.30 eV of PC71BM and a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.51 eV in contrast to −5.10 eV of PTB7-Th, resulted in cascade-energy-level alignment and higher Voc, which effectively promoted charge transfer among the active layers. In consequence, the Jsc, Voc, and FF of the device were simultaneously increased with the addition of 15 wt% IT-M as the acceptor, and the TOSC afforded an enhanced PCE of 9.87%; interestingly, the PCE of the BOSC counterpart is only 8.50%.
Perylene diimide (PDI) is a traditional n-type organic semiconductor material with excellent photoelectric properties, whose derivatives have excellent thermal and photochemical stability as well as achieve strong absorption of light from the visible to the infrared region. To combine the advantages of the PDI material and the fullerene acceptor, Huang et al. synthesized the small-molecule NFA of TPE-4PDI (as shown in Fig. 8) from PDI. They added it to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BOSC to fabricate TOSCs. The GIWAXS and RSoXS data demonstrated that TPE-4PDI and the host system acceptor of PC71BM formed an alloy model. Besides, owing to the addition of TPE-4PDI, the binary system formed a preferable micro–nanomorphology, which promoted the generation, separation, and effective collection of free charges. Accordingly, the device efficiency increased from 9.22% to 10.09%.
The additive can also play the role of the third component introduced into the BOSCs, and only a small amount is needed to achieve a significant enhancement in efficiency. Kim et al. adopted the n-type conjugated polymer additive of THBT-ht (shown in Fig. 8) as the third component to optimize the photovoltaic properties of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The energy levels of THBT-ht were between those of PTB7-Th and PC71BM; here, cascade charge and energy processes could be obtained. With the addition of 0.5 wt% THBT-ht, the roughness of the blend films could be reduced, and the film was less hydrophobic. Further, the GIWAXS data revealed that the addition of 0.5 wt% THBT-ht could decrease the lamellar size of the PTB7-Th domains. The synergistic effect of the balanced charge transport, improved morphology, and cascade energy transfer resulted in PCE enhancement from 8.77% to 9.81%.
In 2018, Yu et al. fabricated the PTB7-Th:TPB:PC71BM TOSC by using the TPB NFA as the third component. With a special cross-shaped molecular configuration, TPB was observed to be situated between the PTB7-Th and PC71BM phases, which was confirmed by the TPB's wetting coefficient in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend. Furthermore, the contact points created by the four branches (PDI units) of the TPB molecule were beneficial to improve the charge extraction. TPB played the role of an electronic relay bridge in the charge transport process, resulting in improved electron mobility and connectivity. Therefore, a higher Jsc of 19.4 mA cm−2, relative to 17.2 mA cm−2 of the BOSC, was achieved. Moreover, when 10% TPB was added into the binary blend, the TOSC exhibited a PCE of 10.2%. A small-molecule NFA of IEICO-4F was employed by Hao et al. as the third component to optimize the performance of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The crystallinity of IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th could be synergistically improved due to the addition of IEICO-4F in PTB7-Th:PC71BM; therefore, charge transfer became more efficient and charge recombination in the blend was reduced. Meanwhile, the introduction of IEICO-4F could widen the absorption band of the TOSC into the infrared region. Therefore, there was a remarkable improvement in the Jsc in the TOSC with an increase from 17.39 to 23.68 mA cm−2, and the PCE of the device was enhanced from 9.07% to 11.06%.
Small-molecule NFAs with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) (IC) chromophoric groups usually have a relatively narrow bandgap, which is helpful to move the absorption wavelength to the NIR region. To enhance the utilization of sunlight and ensure that the OSC can fully absorb the NIR solar energy, Zhan et al. explored a small-molecule F8IC with an ultra-narrow bandgap, which has an excellent extinction coefficient of 2.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In contrast to PC71BM, F8IC has lower LUMO and higher HOMO energy levels with a strong absorption band within 600–1000 nm, which can compensate for the drawback of PC71BM that only shows photoresponse within 300–550 nm. To incorporate the merits of PC71BM and F8IC, PC71BM was added as the third component into the PTB7-Th:F8IC BOSC. Intriguingly, because of the broadened absorption band with the strong NIR absorption of F8IC, the photoresponse edge could be extended into >1000 nm, and a worthwhile Jsc of 26.00 mA cm−2 could be achieved. Because PC71BM has a relatively higher LUMO level in contrast to F8IC, the Voc of TOSC was increased from 0.640 to 0.789 V as the weight ratio of PC71BM increased from 0 to 100 wt%. When the addition ratio of PC71BM was 30 wt% in the acceptors, the TOSC afforded a champion PCE of 12.3%, which is the highest PCE reported at that time with regard to PTB7-Th single-junction OSCs.
To pursue a deeper investigation into PTB7-Th-based TOSCs, Ding et al. were the first to design and synthesize a highly efficient narrow-bandgap COi8DFIC NFA with fluorine-substituted IC as the end group. The BOSC composed of PTB7-Th as the donor and COi8DFIC as the acceptor afforded a Jsc of 26.12 mA cm−2 and PCE of 12.16%. Subsequently, Ding et al. introduced PC71BM into the binary system based on PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC to prepare a TOSC. The complementary fullerene derivative PC71BM improved the absorption range of the system, promoted the transfer of free charge, and improved the morphology of the active layer. Therefore, the Jsc and PCE of the device increased from 23.84 mA cm−2 and 10.48% to 28.20 mA cm−2 and 14.08%, respectively. In 2018, Chen et al. explored a new narrow-bandgap NFA 3TT-FIC, which also used fluorine-substituted IC as the end group. Because 3TT-FIC has a strong and wide absorption spectrum, its optical bandgap is only 1.25 eV. The BOSC based on PTB7-Th:3TT-FIC has a Jsc of 25.89 mA cm−2 and PCE of 12.21%. When PC71BM was added as the supplementary acceptor into the BOSC of PTB7-Th:3TT-FIC, a dramatic enhancement in the EQE in the visible range was obviously detected. Simultaneously, the addition of PC71BM could improve the morphology of the TOSC, yielding an increase in the FF. Consequently, the TOSC based on PTB7-Th:3TT-FIC:PC71BM with a ratio of 1:1.2:0.30 realized a superior PCE of 13.54% and higher Jsc of 27.73 mA cm−2.
Apart from PTB7-Th-based TOSCs, PM6-based TOSCs have also attracted considerable attention. In 2019, Hou et al. fabricated a TOSC by incorporating the fullerene derivative PC61BM as the third component into the BOSC based on PM6:Y6. The importing of PC61BM enhanced the electron mobility of the PBDB-TF:Y6 system. Meanwhile, since PC61BM can play the role of dispersing Y6 and suppressing the aggregation of Y6, the TOSC blend exhibited enhanced electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) and realized a reduced nonradiative energy loss. Accordingly, all the photovoltaic parameters of the TOSC were improved. As a result, the PCE of the TOSC was 16.5% compared with the corresponding value for the BOSC of 15.3%. Large-area printing is an inevitable issue that must be resolved for future commercialization. Controlling the morphology of large-area BHJ OSCs is still a tricky problem. To resolve this issue, Chen et al. adopted a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) method to fabricate a large-area TOSC with an indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) to enhance the PCE of a PM6:IT-4F BOSC. On one hand, the incorporation of ICBA could effectively promote the vertical phase separation and contribute to the formation of an evident PPHJ structure. On the other hand, the introduction of ICBA could induce IT-4F to gather together on the upward side of the active layer. Additionally, PM6 was enriched on the bottom of the blend films, and the ordered vertical arrangement of the blends was extraordinarily favorable to the separation and transfer of electrons and holes. Furthermore, the addition of ICBA could also improve the crystallinity of PM6, thereby accelerating exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Consequently, 1.05 cm2 PPHJ TOSC based on PM6:ICBA:IT-4F with the ratio of 1:0.1:0.9 fabricated by blade coating achieved a notable PCE of 14.25%, which was superior to both the corresponding BHJ devices (13.73%) and BOSC (13.19%).
To further enhance the PCE of the BOSC based on PBDB-T-2Cl:Y6 and take full advantage of the high electron mobility and hollow spherical structure of the classic fullerene derivative PC71BM, Zhang et al. used PC71BM as the third component to add into the host system. The Raman mapping images demonstrated that good compatibility was observed between PC71BM and Y6, which is favorable for the formation of efficient electron transport channels. Meanwhile, by incorporating an appropriate content of PC71BM, the degree of phase separation, size of domains, and molecular arrangement of the TOSC could be finely adjusted, which can be evidenced by the characterization of 2D grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. Accordingly, the TOSC of PBDB-T-2Cl:Y6:PC71BM (1:1.2:0.2, wt/wt) achieved a remarkable PCE of 16.71% with a Jsc of 25.44 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.66%, which is considerably superior to the binary counterpart with a PCE of 15.49%, Jsc of 24.98 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.43%. The enhanced PCE can be attributed to the synchronously improved Jsc and FF.

At present, even optimal NFA-based BOSCs having high response to the sunlight wavelength (400–500 nm) is grossly insufficient. A wide-bandgap polymer donor can be well matched with a high-performance NFA having good absorption. Constructing a two donors/NFA TOSC is an effective method to further improve the photon collection ability of the active layer. Current research has primarily focused on using polymer donors as the guest donors in TOSCs based on NFAs to improve the performance of binary blending systems.

In 2017, Hao et al. prepared a TOSC by utilizing the PCDTBT polymer (as shown in Fig. 9) as an additional donor to optimize the performance of the binary PTB7-Th:ITIC OSCs. The GIWAXS characterization revealed that PCDTBT was distributed between the PTB7-Th and ITIC phases and could fully contact with PTB7-Th and ITIC. Since the PL spectrum of PCDTBT overlapped with the absorption spectra of both PTB7-Th and ITIC, there was a dual FRET effect in this ternary system, which is beneficial to enhance the energy transfer efficiencies among PCDTBT, PTB7-Th, and ITIC. Meanwhile, the molecular coherence lengths of PTB7-Th and ITIC could be effectively reduced with the appropriate doping of PCDTBT. Furthermore, the addition of PCDTBT could also increase the efficiency of charge hopping by reducing the interval of π–π stacking. Consequently, a notable enhancement could be achieved in the Jsc and PCE of the TOSC, which increased from 13.89 mA cm−2 and 6.51% to 16.71 mA cm−2 and 7.51%, respectively (relevant photovoltaic properties of the devices are listed in Table 2). Considering the fact that PTB7-Th and J51 have similar HOMO energy levels and complementary absorption of solar light, Zhang et al. adopted PTB7-Th as the extra polymer donor to add into the J51:ITIC system. From the UV-vis absorption spectra, because of the contribution of PTB7-Th, the absorption of the blend films was largely enhanced, particularly in the wavelength from 600 to 750 nm. Intriguingly, on account of the synergistic effect of the better light absorption, more balanced hole/electron mobility, efficient energy transfer between J51 and PTB7-Th, and improved morphology of the blend film, the Jsc and PCE of the TOSC were increased to 17.75 mA cm−2 and 9.70% compared with those of the BOSC counterpart, namely, 16.19 mA cm−2 and 8.89%, respectively.

In 2018, Cui et al. reported a new conjugated polymer and employed it as the supplementary donor to be added to the PBDB-TS:ITIC BOSC. Compared with PBDB-TS, PBDB-BT has a similar and extended π-conjugated polymeric backbone with additional fluorine-substituted thiophene. Simultaneously, the light absorption range of PBDB-BT is complementary to that of PBDB-TS, particularly in the region of 400–600 nm. When the addition ratio of PBDB-BT is 10 wt%, the TOSC based on PBDB-TS:PBDB-BT:ITIC achieved a high PCE of 10.26% with FF of 68.3%, showing a significant increase compared with the corresponding binary system of PBDB-TS:ITIC with a PCE of 9.81% and FF of 65.1%. Such an improvement can be attributed to the reduction in the bimolecular recombination loss, balanced charge carrier mobility, and enhanced charge dissociation and collection in the ternary blend. By combining similar HOMO and complementary absorption bands between PBDB-T and PTB7-Th, Zhang et al. selected PTB7-Th as the third component to fabricate a PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F TOSC. Because of the efficient energy transfer from PBDB-T to PTB7-Th, the photon collection and exciton utilization of the host PBDB-T donor could be effectively increased. Additionally, PTB7-Th could also be used as an adjustor to regulate the alignment of PBDB-T molecules to optimize the charge transport, thereby increasing the FF of the TOSC. Therefore, relative to the BOSC, the PCE of the TOSC was successfully increased from 10.25% to 11.62%.
By choosing the medium-bandgap PBDB-T polymer as the doped donor, Peng et al. fabricated a TOSC based on PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:SFBRCN. PBDB-T has good compatibility with PTB7-Th and possesses good phase separation morphology with SFBRCN. Meanwhile, the SFBRCN acceptor has worthwhile complementary absorption in 300–800 nm with the two polymer donors of PBDBT and PTB7-Th. Except for the electron transfer of the cascade-energy-level alignment between the three components, due to the small shift in the HOMO between PBDB-T and PTB7-Th, the hole-back transfer from PTB7-Th to PBDB-T also existed in the system. Further, the FRET among PBDBT, PTB7-Th, and SFBRCN was another contributor for enhancing the TOSC performance. These energy and charge transfer mechanisms exerted a vital influence on enhancing the energy conversion, charge transfer and dissociation, and collection efficiency of the device, thereby decreasing the loss due to charge recombination. Accordingly, the device based on PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:SFBRCN with a ratio of 30 wt% PBDB-T achieved a champion PCE of 12.27% and Voc of 0.93 V, which is the best value of PCE reported at that time.
Nian et al. introduced the PDTfBO-TT polymer into the PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:IT-M binary systems to prepare two TOSCs; the structure of the PDTfBO-TT device is shown in Fig. 9. After adding PDTfBO-TT, the crystallinities of the PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:IT-M blends were dramatically increased, and more ordered morphologies could be achieved. Compared with the corresponding BOSC, the charge mobilities and charge collection efficiencies of the TOSCs were considerably enhanced. Therefore, due to the contribution of PDTfBO-TT, the PCE of the TOSC based on PBDB-T:ITIC BOSC was substantially increased from 10.82% to 12.70% and the FF was enhanced from 71.85% to 78.07%. Similarly, the PCE of the TOSC based on PBDB-T:IT-M was also dramatically increased from 11.71% to 13.52%, and the FF was enhanced from 72.07% to 77.83%. The stability of the non-fullerene OSC is a remarkable challenge to the development and commercialization of large-scale production in the future. To fabricate a device with high thermal and storage stability as well as excellent PCE, Ade et al. selected a medium-bandgap PBDB-T polymer donor to add into the non-fullerene BOSC of FATZ:IT-M. The addition of the rigid PBDB-T polymer could appropriately suppress the crystallization of non-fullerene SMA of IT-M due to the low miscibility between PBDB-T and IT-M, consequently enhancing the stability of the device. Furthermore, by virtue of the slightly higher HOMO of PBDB-T than the host FATZ donor and the immiscibility between PBDB-T and IT-M, the highly pure minority donor phase of PBDB-T was obtained, which could efficiently trap the holes into its network to enhance the hole transport abilities of the TOSC. As a result, charge recombination was significantly decreased, and therefore, the FF was efficiently enhanced from 69.4% to 74.1% and a PCEbest of 13.2% could be achieved for this device. This study provides valuable guidance for fabricating an OSC with high stability and superior efficiency via a facile synergistic method.
The basic principle for designing the third component donor is complementary light absorption and good compatibility with the binary blends and having slightly higher HOMO energy level with the host donor as well as possessing well-matched energy levels with the acceptor. Based on this, Zhang et al. employed J71 as the additional donor to optimize the photovoltaic parameters of the PM6:Br-ITIC BOSC. Owing to the good compatibility with the host system donor of PM6, J71 tended to form an alloy model with PM6, which is beneficial for improving the photon collection and phase separation morphology of the ternary active layer. Because of the enhanced efficiencies of charge transport and collection, the TOSC realized a champion FF of 78.4%, which is in dramatic contrast to that of the binary system (72.7%). Meanwhile, the Jsc was considerably enhanced (19.39 vs. 18.53 mA cm−2). Although the slightly higher HOMO of J71 resulted in a small decrease in Voc, the simultaneously increased Jsc and FF could effectively compensate for it. When the ratio of J71 in the donor was 20 wt%, the PCE of the TOSC was 14.13%, which is an enhancement of over 11% in contrast to the counterpart BOSC.
Subsequently, since the absorption band of Br-ITIC is around 500–800 nm, it cannot absorb light from the NIR region. To resolve this problem and ensure maximum utilization of the solar energy and enhance the Jsc of the OSCs, Zhang's group replaced Br-ITIC with the widened absorption acceptor of Y6 and constructed a TOSC by incorporating J71 as the complementary donor into the binary system of PM6:Y6. The light absorption range of J71 is 400–620 nm, which is perfectly supplementary to that of Y6 with a light-harvesting band of 600–950 nm. Meanwhile, the host PM6 donor strongly absorbs in 350–700 nm. Hence, the combination of J71 with the binary system of PM6:Y6 can effectively capture solar energy from the ultraviolet to NIR region, which is favorable for enhancing Jsc. Moreover, J71 can act as a regulator to improve the morphology of ternary system blends, facilitating charge separation and transport. Based on this, the PM6:J71:Y6 TOSC with 10 wt% J71 achieved an amazing Jsc of 25.55 mA cm−2 and worthwhile FF of 76.0%, which are slightly superior to the counterpart BOSC with a Jsc of 25.24 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.9%. Since the HOMO energy levels of the two donors are close, the loss of energy transfer between them was reduced. Therefore, the Voc of the TOSC was gradually enhanced with an increase in the weight ratio of J71. When the weight ratio of J71 was 10 wt%, a champion PCE of 16.5% was achieved in the TOSC owing to the simultaneous increment in Jsc, Voc, and FF.
To improve the coplanarity of the conjugated backbone, obtain better overlap between the intermolecular orbitals, and enhance the efficiency of charge transport, Peng et al. replaced benzodithiophene (BDT) with a more extended π-conjugation group of naphthodithiophene (NDT), and they designed a new wide-bandgap donor polymer of PNDT-ST. Meanwhile, with minor modification of Y6 by the substitution of difluorobenzene with weaker electron-withdrawing thiophene afforded the NIR absorption acceptor of Y6-T. The compatible PBDT-ST and PNDT-ST were employed as two donors and Y6-T as the acceptor to fabricate TOSCs. Due to the slightly less electron-withdrawing ability, Y6-T showed an upshifted LUMO energy level compared with Y6, contributing to a remarkable Voc of 0.909 V and lower energy loss (Eloss) of 0.521 eV. The two polymer donors of PNDT-ST and PBDT-ST possessed good compatibility, and they could be used to optimize the morphology of the blended ternary system by forming an alloy model with a proper ratio between PNDT-ST and PBDT-ST. When the weight ratio of PBDT-ST, PNDT-ST, and Y6-T was 0.6:0.4:1.2, the TOSC afforded a PCEbest of 16.57% and FF of 75.8%. The above results can provide valuable guidance for resolving the problems of low Voc and large Eloss of OSCs.

Compared with the system based on polymer donor/fullerene acceptor/NFA, two non-fullerene systems have better flexibility, and the components can be easily modified. Recently, with an increase in the research on NFAs, many encouraging results have emerged. For improving the light collection in the active layer, the most common strategy is to use a narrow-bandgap IC-based NFA and PDI molecules or medium-bandgap naphthalimide molecules to construct a ternary blend film. Such a blend showed obvious superiority with regard to the extended light absorption range.

In 2017, two BHJ TOSCs with an inverted device structure based on P3HT, PCE10 (PBDTTT-EFT), and two NFAs (IDTBR and IDFBR) were reported by McCulloch et al. The corresponding chemical structures are shown in Fig. 10. The phase morphology of the TOSC was optimized by optimizing the ratio of IDFBR in the active layer. The vitrification of IDTBR originating from the IDFBR crystal afforded a favorable three-phase microstructure, which is beneficial to the generation of the photocurrent. The optimized phase morphology resulted in higher-lying electron transport level, contributing to the enhancement in Voc. Additionally, the decreased bimolecular recombination and good collection efficiency were obtained, which should be assigned to the optimized nano–microphase structure. Consequently, the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the TOSC based on P3HT:IDTBR:IDFBR were simultaneously improved, and an acceptable PCE of 7.7% was obtained. Replacing the P3HT donor with PCE10, when the addition ratio of PCE10:IDTBR:IDFBR was 1:0.5:0.5, the Voc of the device was as high as 1.03 V, and the efficiency was 11.0% (the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs are listed in Table 3).

Two BOSCs based on J71:IT-M and J71:ITIC with J71 as the donor and IT-M or ITIC as the acceptor were prepared by Zhang's team in 2018. After solvent annealing, the efficiencies of the devices based on J71:IT-M and J71:ITIC were 10.68% and 10.65%, respectively. Compared with the OSC based on J71:ITIC with a relatively high FF of 68.2%, the OSC based on J71:IT-M showed a slightly superior Jsc of 17.71 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.981 V. To combine the advantages of these two devices, a TOSC based on J71:ITIC:IT-M was prepared. Although ITIC and IT-M have almost the same bandgap, the performance of the TOSC was strongly enhanced via the supplementary photovoltaic performances of the two BOSCs instead of the supplementary absorption spectra, achieving a Voc of 0.978 V, Jsc of 18.08 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.6%. Therefore, the PCE value of the TOSC was increased to 11.60%. The basic principles of choosing the additional acceptor materials for highly efficient TOSC are as follows: (1) the added acceptors should have a complementary solar light absorption band with the BOSC; (2) it is necessary to avoid deep charge traps in TOSCs, and the third component acceptor should have similar LUMO energy level with the host acceptor and lower HOMO energy level compared with the donor material; and (3) the two corresponding binary systems should have supplementary photovoltaic properties. Based on this, in the same year, Zhang's group replaced IT-M with the more extended absorption acceptor MeIC2 and employed it as the third component to add into the BOSC based on J71:ITIC. When 20 wt% MeIC2 was added into the binary system, the TOSC reached a high PCE of 11.6%, with a Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2 and FF 70.5%, which is in sharp contrast to those of the counterpart binary system with a PCE of 10.7%, Jsc of 16.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.0%. The increase in Jsc and FF of the TOSC should be ascribed to the more balanced charge transport, improved photon-harvesting ability and morphology, and microphase separation of the TOSCs.
To widen the absorption region of the active layer into the NIR region, Yang et al. reported two new narrow-bandgap NFAs of ITIC-Th-S and ITIC-Th-O. They utilized them as the third component to the binary system of FTAZ:IDIC. After proper chemical modification, the HOMO energy levels of ITIC-Th-S and the ITIC-Th-O were moved up to −5.41 and −5.36 eV compared with that of ITIC-Th (−5.61 eV). In comparison, the LUMO energy levels were moved down to −3.86 and −3.91 eV compared with that of ITIC-Th (−3.81 eV). The absorption band of the ternary active layer was widened to the NIR region due to the contribution of the narrowed bandgaps of ITIC-Th-S and ITIC-Th-O. Meanwhile, the optimized energy level alignment could achieve efficient charge transfer. Additionally, since the chemical structures of ITIC-Th-S and ITIC-Th-O were analogical to the host IDIC acceptor, worthwhile compatibility was found among them, and good morphologies with nanometer microphase separation layers were obtained. Consequently, compared with the binary system of FTAZ:IDIC with a PCE of 10.0%, the TOSCs of FTAZ:ITIC-Th-S:IDIC and FTAZ:ITIC-Th-O:IDIC delivered increased PCEs of 10.8% and 11.3%, respectively.
How to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic parameters of TOSCs, especially for enhancing the FF, is still a great challenge. Two BOSCs of PBDB-T:ITCPTC and PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M were prepared and afforded PCEs of 10.51% and 11.02%, respectively. Compared with the counterpart of PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M, the PBDB-T:ITCPTC device has a higher Jsc of 17.44 mA cm−2 due to the narrower bandgap and slightly higher absorption coefficient of ITCPTC. On the other hand, the BOSC based on PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M has a higher FF of 75.3% and better Voc of 0.915 V, revealing the complementary properties of the two acceptors of ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M. Inspired by this, Zhang et al. fabricated a TOSC based on PBDB-T:ITCPTC:IDT6CN-M by combining the merits of the two BOSCs. By carefully tuning the ratio of ITCPTC, the device achieved a remarkable PCE of 11.92% with 60 wt% ITCPTC, which should be ascribed to the simultaneously increased Jsc of 17.81 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.5%. It is worth mentioning that the excellent FF of 76.5% demonstrated the good compatibility of the ternary active layer materials. Consequently, the long-term stability of the device is as significant as the outstanding PCE for the potential large-area application of OSCs. Therefore, Zhang et al. constructed a TOSC with high PCE and good air stability by adding the N2200 polymer (shown in Fig. 10) as the supplementary acceptor into the BOSC of PBDB-T:ITIC. When the addition ratio of N2200 was 10 wt% in the acceptors, the PBDB-T:ITIC:N2200-based TOSC achieved a PCE of 11.41% relative to 10.03% of the binary PBDB-T:ITIC counterpart. The highly improved PCE of the TOSC should be ascribed to the enhanced photon collection capability, optimized morphology, and more balanced charge transport, as well as the compatibility of the active layer materials. Moreover, when the ITIC was replaced with ITIC-Th and IT-M, the PCE of the TOSCs reached 11.40% and 12.10%, respectively. These research results can provide some valuable guidance for developing high-performance OSCs with good stability by taking advantage of a polymer acceptor and SMA.
Introducing an acceptor with a relatively high LUMO energy level that has a complementary absorption band with the binary host system is an efficient strategy to enhance the Voc of the TOSCs. Based on this, Ge and co-workers explored a new ITCN NFA and incorporated it as the extra acceptor to add into the binary system of PBDBT:IT-M. By adding ITCN into the binary system, the energy levels and absorption of the system could be adjusted, complementary light absorption and effective exciton diffusion between ITCN and PBDBT:IT-M were achieved, and the photovoltaic performance of the TOSC was intensely enhanced. When the weight ratio of PBDBT:ITCN:IT-M was 1:0.2:0.8, the device realized a better PCE of 11.72% and excellent Voc of 0.954 V. The enhanced Voc was mainly owing to the higher LUMO energy level of ITCN than that of IT-M. Generally, two acceptors with a similar chemical structure tended to form an alloy model. Zhang's group fabricated a TOSC with two compatible NFAs, namely, MeIC and MeIC2, with similar LUMO energy levels as the two acceptors and PBT1-C as the polymer donor. Since MeIC and MeIC2 had exactly similar chemical structures, the interfacial energy between them was extremely low. Therefore, an alloy-like model was formed. Furthermore, the close LUMO energy levels of MeIC and MeIC2 were conducive to the formation of effective electron transfer channels in the TOSCs. The PCEs of the BOSC based on MeIC and MeIC2 were 11.47% and 11.41%, respectively. When the weight ratio of PBT1-C, MeIC, and MeIC2 was 1:0.7:0.3, the TOSC achieved the best PCE of 12.55%. The dramatically enhanced PCE of the TOSC can be primarily ascribed to the higher photon-capturing abilities, more efficient charge transfer, and optimized morphologies of the TOSCs.
A narrow-bandgap NNBDT (with the A/D/A structure) with NINCN as the end substituent was designed and utilized as the acceptor by Chen et al. The BOSC based on PBDB-T:NNBDT afforded a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 18.63 mA cm−2, FF of 71.7%, and PCE of 11.7%. It is noteworthy that a low energy loss of 0.55 eV was achieved. To further improve the PCE of the OSC, FDNCTF with a slightly wider bandgap and high LUMO energy level compared with the analogous chemical structure of NNBDT was selected as the additional acceptor to enhance the light-capturing ability. Intriguingly, a favorable nonradiative energy transfer process from FDNCTF to NNBDT can be found in the device, which favors enhancing the Jsc. The TOSC obtained a Voc of 0.887 V, FF of 72.2%, PCE of 12.8%, and Jsc of 19.89 mA cm−2. Bazan et al. reported two new NFAs of ITIC-2F and IOTIC-2F. The BOSC constructed by blending IOTIC-2F and polymer donor of PTB7-Th achieved a high Jsc of 22 mA cm−2 and a very small energy loss of around 0.49 eV. The effective light response in the NIR position made the device afford a high PCE of 12.1% with superior transparency (52%) in the visible region between 370 and 740 nm. Besides, when 12 wt% ITIC-2F was incorporated into the PTB7-Th:IOTIC-2F system, the generation of photocurrent in the TOSC was dramatically promoted by forming a cascade-energy-level alignment and a nanoscale phase separation morphology, thereby affording an excellent PCE of 12.9% and Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2.
Replacing the methyl of BDTThIT-M with a fluorine atom, Zhang et al. reported a medium-bandgap non-fullerene material of BDTThIT-4F (shown in Fig. 10). They added it into the BOSC of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC to improve the photovoltaic properties of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC. The BOSC based on PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC showed an acceptable PCE of 11.47%, Jsc of 23.45 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.710 V, and FF of 68.9%. Although BDTThIT-4F has a wider bandgap than COi8DFIC, the absorption band edge of the ternary blend film could also be extended to the long-wavelength region. This can be mainly attributed to the introduction of BDTThIT-4F that can adjust the molecular arrangement of COi8DFIC, thereby improving the photon-capturing capability in the long-wavelength range and the morphology of the TOSC, which help in achieving higher Jsc and FF. The transient and steady-state absorption spectra showed that the red-shift in the absorption edge of the active layer should be primarily attributed to the optimization of the molecular alignment of COi8DFIC. Delightfully, all the key parameters of the TOSC were simultaneously improved with the addition of 20 wt% BDTThIT-4F into the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC system; a superior PCE of 13.08%, Jsc of 24.88 mA cm−2, Voc 0.721 V, and high FF of 72.9% were obtained. In sharp comparison to the PCE of the corresponding BOSC, the highly enhanced PCE of the TOSC can be responsibly assigned to the dramatic enhancement in the Jsc and FF and a slight improvement in the Voc. The Voc does not drop but slightly rise, which could be well explained by the formation of the alloy model.
Notably, most of the reported works on TOSCs have principally concentrated on the third component that exhibits a supplementary absorption band with the BOSC. On the contrary, only a few studies have investigated third components that show analogical absorption spectra with the host binary system, which may provide newer insights into understanding the role and mechanism of the third component. Based on this, Yan et al. chose two similar structures and absorption band materials, namely, MeIC and ITCPTC, as the acceptors and PM6 as the donor to fabricate TOSCs. Although ITCPTC and MeIC have a similar absorption spectrum, they play a synergistic role in adjusting the domain size and crystallinity of the ternary blend. MeIC is an SMA with strong crystallinity. When MeIC is blended with PM6, an excess of microphase segregation and oversize domains are formed, which are unfavorable for charge separation and transport. Encouragingly, the addition of low-crystalline ITCPTC into the binary blend can appropriately decrease the domain size and optimize the morphology of the blend without decreasing its electron mobility. When the addition ratio of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC was 1:0.4:0.6, the TOSC obtained a high FF of 78.2% and PCE of 14.13%. In consideration of the big dipole moment of the C–Cl bond that can facilitate intermolecular charge transfer for the acceptor with the D/A structure, Hou et al. explored two small-molecule NFAs, namely, IT-2Cl and IT-4Cl, by the chlorine substitution of the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene of ITIC. The large dipole moment of the C–Cl bond is found to be beneficial for increasing the absorption of light and reducing the energy levels of the molecules. Moreover, the presence of C–Cl bonds was favorable to the stacking of molecules, which could further broaden the absorption spectrum and enhance the light-harvesting ability. Furthermore, good compatibility between IT-2Cl and IT-4Cl was observed. Consequently, when the addition ratio of PM6:IT-2Cl:IT-4Cl was 1.0:0.2:0.8, the TOSC achieved a Voc of 0.842 V, Jsc of 22.03 mA cm−2, FF of 76.4%, and good PCE of 14.18%.
Zhang et al. selected IPTBO-4Cl and MF1 as the acceptors and adjusted the morphology of the active layers by altering the MF1 content in the acceptors due to the good compatibility between IPTBO-4Cl and MF1. The FF of the TOSC based on PM6:IPTBO-4Cl:MF1 increased with the increased addition of MF1, which indicated that MF1 was an outstanding regulator in improving the morphology of the TOSC. When the content of MF1 was 30 wt%, a delightful PCE of 15.74% was achieved with simultaneously increased FF, Jsc, and Voc. To fully understand the selection principles of the third components, Sun et al. synthesized the two similar-structured small-molecule NFAs of 3TP3T-4F and 3TP3T-IC. They employed them as the third component in a PM6:Y6 BOSC. Despite the almost similar structures, distinct effects of modification were detected in the TOSCs with the two guest NFAs of 3TP3T-4F and 3TP3T-IC. Encouragingly, wonderful compatibility between 3TP3T-4F and Y6 was also found, which was beneficial to the transport of charge carriers and electron mobility. On the contrary, poor compatibility was observed in the 3TP3T-IC-based TOSCs. The PCE of the binary PM6:Y6 device exhibited the maximum PCE of 16.0%. Delightfully, the TOSC based on 3TP3T-4F showed a dominant PCE of 16.7% with a syngeneic enhancement in the Voc, Jsc, and FF. These inspired results should be ascribed to the more balanced carrier transport and complementary absorption. Unfortunately, the 3TP3T-IC-based TOSC achieved a slightly reduced PCE of 15.6% due to the poor morphology originated from the bad compatibility. This work can offer some useful guidance on choosing the third component for high-performance TOSCs.
The performances of the TOSCs based on polymer donor/two NFAs can be effectively improved by building an alloy model. Zhang et al. utilized a medium-bandgap small-molecule NFA of MF1 as the second acceptor, and a novel TOSC was fabricated when MF1 was added into the BOSC based on PM6 and Y6. Raman mapping, contact angle, and cyclic voltammetry characterizations and blend film morphology demonstrated that an alloy model was formed owing to the superior compatibility between MF1 and Y6. By adjusting the addition ratio of MF1 in the acceptors, the electron mobility in the TOSC was considerably improved owing to the optimized photon collection and phase separation morphology, achieving simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc, and FF of the TOSC. If the weight ratio of PM6:Y6:MF1 was 1:0.9:0.1, a notable PCE of 17.22% was achieved, which is highly enhanced in contrast to the corresponding BOSC with a PCE of 15.93%.

The PCE of BHJ OSCs has exceeded 18%. However, most high-performance OSCs are currently prepared by spin-coating films with a small active area in the laboratory. To further adapt to the requirements of commercial applications, it is urgent to study how to realize a balance between high-performance and large-area devices. Meanwhile, it is crucial that the high PCE of small-area TOSCs can be successfully realized in large-area devices without much loss. To understand more about large-area TOSCs, Zan et al. constructed a TOSC with the PBDB-T:ITIC:PC71BM structure. By carefully controlling the blade-coating conditions on the glass substrate, a worthwhile PCE of 7.69% was achieved for a large-scale device with an area of 216 cm2, which could effectively maintain about 80% PCE of the corresponding small-area device of 0.04 cm2. Moreover, when the large-scale device was annealed at 85 °C for 30 days, it could retain 75% of the initial PCE. A new narrow-bandgap NFA of DTCFOIC (as shown in Fig. 11) was designed and employed as an additional acceptor into the binary system of PBDB-T:PC71BM by Shen et al. to investigate the performance of large-scale TOSCs. When the weight ratio of PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC is 1:1.5:0.2, the TOSC achieved a PCE of 10.13% with a 160 nm active layer and a normal small area of 0.04 cm2. Moreover, when the area and thickness of the TOSC increased to 0.1 cm2 and 190 nm, respectively, an enhanced PCE of 10.41% was achieved. Meanwhile, as the area of the device continued to increase to 1 cm2, an acceptable PCE of 9.21% could be achieved; the detailed device parameters are listed in Table 4. A novel asymmetric T2-OEHRH was designed and utilized as the third component by Shin et al. to fabricate a TOSC. The insertion of asymmetric alkyl side chains into the rhodamine groups can effectively inhibit the high self-aggregation or crystallization of the molecule and dramatically enhance the solubility without reducing the optoelectrical properties. Hence, the TOSC based on PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH could realize nonhalogenated solvent processing and afforded an outstanding PCE of 9.32% for large-area device with an aperture area of 55.5 cm2 and a substrate area of 100 cm2 fabricated via D-bar coating in air. In general, it is very difficult to guarantee both adequate NIR light absorption and low charge recombination of the active layer in all-polymer solar cells. To resolve this problem, Li et al. adopted a nonhalogenated dibenzyl ether (DBE) as the solvent additive to modulate the morphology and performance of the TOSCs based on PBTA-Si:PTzBI-Si:N2200 (weight ratio: 1.3:0.7:1). Owing to the excellent morphological control capability of DBE, the PBTA-Si:PTzBI-Si:N2200 TOSC with an area of 0.04 cm2 and a 380 nm-thick active layer exhibited a PCE of 10.4%. Delightfully, when the area of the TOSC was enhanced to 1 cm2, the TOSC with a 350 nm-thick active layer achieved an outstanding PCE of 10.0%. Ying et al. designed a series of donors based on imide-functionalized benzotriazole molecules to match with the NFA (Y6) for the active layer of OSCs. The copolymer molecule of P2F-EHp was demonstrated to possess the best performance when it was blended with Y6, and the BOSC composed of P2F-EHp:Y6 exhibited a high PCE of 15.65% with a device area of 0.04 cm2. Delightfully, when PCBM was chosen as the third component and introduced into the host system to improve the microstructure morphology of the active layer, electronic engineering was also utilized to enhance the device performance by using ITO with a metallic frame as the substrate. The TOSC based on P2F-EHp:PCBM:Y6 achieved an outstanding PCE of 16.18% with a device area of 0.04 cm2. Even though when the aperture area was enhanced to 1 cm2, the TOSC could achieve a PCE as high as 15.13%. Peng et al. developed D/A1/D/A2-type random terpolymers and chose the optimal molar ratio of DPP/BT (0.3/0.7) to construct a TOSC based on PT3:ITCPTC:meta-TrBRCN. The TOSC with a large area of 1.0 cm2 achieved a favorable PCE of 11.43%, which can provide valuable guidance for developing high-performance large-area TOSCs by introducing a random terpolymer donor into the TOSCs.

Flexible large-area OSCs have attracted increasing attention due to their unique flexibility. Chen et al. reported an advanced technology of ink engineering to fabricate an ITO-free flexible TOSC with the active layer of PTB7-TH:IEICO-4F:PC71BM in air. The TOSC achieved a considerably impressive PCE of 10.21% with a large area of 0.88 cm2 and a PCE of 86% could be retained compared with the optimized small-area devices mentioned in the related literature. Fukuda et al. utilized PC71BM as the third component and mixed it into the binary system of PBDTTT-OFT:IEICO-4F to prepare a 3 μm-thick ultraflexible TOSC. Surprisingly, they found that the crystallization of IEICO-4F could be effectively weakened with the proper addition of PC71BM, and the PC71BM molecules were scattered in the amorphous region without distinct aggregation, which facilitates exciton separation and charge transfer. Therefore, the TOSC achieved a high PCE of 13% for a 0.04 cm2 small-area device and obtained an impressive PCE of 11.6% for a 1 cm2 large-area device.
By fine-tuning the chemical structures of the active layer materials and interfacial materials, OSCs can become a promising candidate for the utilization of renewable, green solar energy in the future. However, the relatively poor stability of OSCs is an obstacle to their further commercialization. Under the influence of unstable factors such as light, heat, and moisture, most OSCs face severe degradation in performance. Achieving similar long-term stability as silicon-based solar cells is still a formidable challenge for OSCs. Hao et al. employed the fullerene derivative ICBA as the morphology modulator to add into the binary blend of PM6:BTP-4Cl to enhance the PCE and ultraviolet photostability; the BTP-4Cl structure is shown in Fig. 12. Due to the excellent miscibility of ICBA with BTP-4Cl, it can homogeneously regulate BTP-4Cl to form well-ordered domain phases and nanometer-microphase-separated stable morphology of the active layer could be obtained. Accordingly, the TOSC based on PM6:BTP-4Cl:ICBA (weight ratio: 1:1:0.2) realized an excellent PCE of 16.76%. Moreover, under 100 h of continuous illumination at 365 nm in ambient air, the value of the PCE could be maintained at around 60%. Detailed information on the stability of the device is shown in Table 5. The comparable good tolerance to the UV radiation can be attributed to the stable BHJ morphology and enhanced harvesting ability of ultraviolet photons of the active layer. Cui et al. designed a new small-molecule IBC-F and utilized it as a third component to improve the PCE and stability of the device based on PBDB-T:IE4F-S. The reference binary device of PBDB-T:IE4F-S afforded a PCE of 13.70%, while the corresponding TOSC based on PBDB-T:IE4F-S:IBC-F with a weight ratio of 1:1:0.2 yielded a significantly higher PCE of 15.06%. Moreover, when the devices based on PBDB-T:IE4F-S and PBDB-T:IE4F-S:IBC-F were thermally treated in an uninterrupted manner at 60 °C for 8.5 h, the former BOSC could only retain 70% of its original PCE, while the latter TOSC maintained 82% of its initial PCE. Similarly, when the PBDB-T:IE4F-S and PBDB-T:IE4F-S:IBC-F devices were subjected to continuous illumination for 1000 h, the former could retain only 73.6% of its initial PCE, while the latter could retain 85.5% of its original PCE. Li et al. investigated pyrene-fused perylene diimide (O-PYPDI) and used it to fabricate a TOSC to improve the photovoltaic performance and thermal stability of the device. The TOSC based on J71:ITIC:O-PYPDI (1:0.9:0.1) exhibited a PCE of 10.96%, and it could retain 82% of its initial PCE under annealing at 80 °C for 72 h. The SMA of IDT-OT was added into the PBDB-T:PC71BM system by Shen et al. to optimize the PCE and improve the thermal stability of the device. When the weight ratio of PBDB-T:PC71BM:IDT-OT was 1:1.5:0.2, a PCE of 9.09% was obtained, and 82% of the original PCE could be retained under annealing at 120 °C for 60 h. Ko et al. prepared a TOSC of PTB7-Th:PC70BM:ITIC-Th and investigated the morphological stability of the TOSC. They demonstrated that the TOSC could maintain 61.5% of its original PCE after aging for 720 h at 60 °C.

By adopting the PTB7-Th polymer as the third component, Liu et al. constructed an all-polymer TOSC based on PBDT-TAZ:PTB7-Th:NOE10. Compared with the BOSC, an increase of 18% in PCE was achieved, which was chiefly owing to the synergy among the enhanced absorption, coexistence of charge and energy transfer, and more balanced charge transport. Furthermore, the TOSC exhibited outstanding thermal stability, and it retained 98% of its initial PCE under aging for 300 h at 65 °C. A BOSC based on PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC with an inverted structure showed a PCE of 9.93%, although its PCE could be optimized to around 12% after using DIO as the additive. However, it faced severe loss of PCE when exposed to a continuous thermal environment. To improve the stability of the BOSC, Zhu et al. introduced a new BPTCN NFA to fabricate a PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:BPTCN TOSC. Through the morphological characterizations of grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and RSoXS, the addition of a proper amount of BPTCN molecules was found to promote the crystallinity of the PTB7-Th polymer donor and enhance the phase purity of the blend film; therefore, the bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the active layer were suppressed. Therefore, a PCE of 11.62% was achieved. Besides, even after 450 h of continuous thermal aging at 80 °C, the TOSC retained 84.39% of the initial PCE, exhibiting the well-improved stability of the TOSC.
Most of the reported OSCs are sensitive to the ambient temperature. To resolve this dilemma, a small quantity of semicrystalline PZ1 NFA was added into the PM6:BTTT-2Cl host binary blend by Min et al. to enhance the PCE and improve the thermal stability of the OSCs. It is noteworthy that a very small voltage shift (ΔVoc = 0.008 V) was achieved because of the decreased charge carrier recombination loss and higher LUMO energy level of PZ1. Meanwhile, the existence of PZ1 could optimize the crystalline morphology of the active blend layer, thereby facilitating charge transport. In sharp contrast to the device of PM6:BTTT-2Cl with a PCE of 13.80%, the PCE of PM6:PZ1:BTTT-2Cl was boosted to 15.10% with a simultaneous increase in the Voc, Jsc, and FF values. Under the atmosphere in the glovebox, the PZ1-based device could maintain outstanding thermal stability under treatment at 150 °C for 800 h. The double roles of PZ1 as the third component for improving both photovoltaic properties and thermal stability are promising for practical applications of OSCs.
Except for photostability and thermal stability, the stability of OSCs in long-term storage is also an inevitable factor that deserves more focus for its large-scale application in the future. Zhang et al. employed the wide-bandgap PCDTBT polymer as the third component and incorporated it into the binary system of PBDTTT-EF-T:ITIC to prepare a TOSC. In contrast to the binary system, the PBDTTT-EF-T:PCDTBT:ITIC TOSC showed an obvious increase in Jsc from 15.33 to 17.77 mA cm−2, which was basically attributable to the more efficient FRET enabling the collection of photons in the active layer. By precisely regulating the addition amount of PCDTBT, a delightful PCE of 9.53% could be obtained. Meanwhile, the TOSC exhibited improved device stability as it could retain about 90% of the initial PCE compared with 80% of the BOSC based on PBDTTT-EF-T:ITIC after storage in air conditions for 50 days. Inspired by the energy transfer and delayed fluorescence (DF), Tao et al. explored introducing APDC-TPDA as the DF emitter into the binary system of PM6:Y6 to construct a TOSC. Impressively, this TOSC exhibited a PCE as high as 16.96%, which originated from the simultaneous enhancement in Jsc and FF from 25.41 mA cm−2 and 71.87% to 25.98 mA cm−2 and 77.50%, respectively. The increase in Jsc could be mainly attributed to the longer lifetime of the excitons enabling their smooth dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface, and the rise in FF principally resulted from the improved film morphology. In addition, the TOSC demonstrated excellent storage stability with storage for 55 days under the conditions of 25 °C, RH of 25%, and room light; 95.51% of its original PCE of 16.20% was maintained, and the PCE of the corresponding BOSC retained only 81.69% of its original value. Evidently, the introduction of a DF material into the TOSCs is an effective strategy to improve the stability of the device.

This review briefly introduces the fundamental working mechanisms of TOSCs and the roles played by the third components; it also provides a summary of the latest progress made in TOSCs based on NFAs and the recent advances in large-area TOSCs with long-term stability. The NFAs in the TOSC can provide supplementary light absorption for other components, thereby improving the light collection efficiency. Combining fullerene-based acceptors with NFAs, the advantages of both fullerene derivatives and NFAs can be combined, and their disadvantages can be compensated. So far, the literature has demonstrated that an appropriate design of the third component can yield numerous unexpected results, including optimized film morphology and crystallinity, increased and balanced charge carrier mobility, promoted exciton dissociation at the interface, decreased energy loss, and so on, thereby dramatically improving the performance of the BOSC. Although different research groups have reported many successful TOSCs based on different NFAs, there are still some challenges and limitations that hinder their further development. (1) The lack of specific principles for selecting the third component that matches the host system and an in-depth investigation should be focused on the working mechanism of TOSCs. (2) The Voc is a very crucial parameter in OSCs. A thorough understanding of the mechanism for Voc variations in TOSCs is indispensable. The Voc of the TOSC is usually close to the smaller one of the two corresponding BOSCs or determined by the ratio of the three components. However, this rule cannot explain the Voc variation in some exceptional TOSCs. For instance, sometimes, the Voc of the TOSCs is greater than either of the two corresponding BOSCs. Accordingly, more research should be concentrated on the real mechanism of Voc variation in the TOSCs. (3) The thickness sensitivity and insufficient PCE of the large-area device are also dramatic obstacles for future large-scale commercialization. Since the TOSC is still limited to the same thickness of the related BOSC, novel materials with high electron mobility, thickness insensitivity and broadened absorption band, and well-matched solar light parameters should be developed to meet the requirements of commercialization. (4) High mechanical properties and excellent stability are also compulsory for improving the competitiveness of OSCs. The coexistence of opportunities and challenges promotes the rapid progress and development of TOSCs. Once these problems are resolved, TOSCs based on NFAs can become considerably promising and can have brighter prospects.
