The abundance and low toxicity of manganese have led us to explore the application of manganese complexes as redox mediators for dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), a promising solar energy conversion technology which mimics some of the key processes in photosynthesis during its operation. In this paper, we report the development of a DSC electrolyte based on the tris(acetylacetonato)manganese(III)/(IV), [Mn(acac)3]0/1+, redox couple. PEDOT-coated FTO glass was used as a counter electrode instead of the conventionally used platinum. The influence of a number of device parameters on the DSC performance was studied, including the concentration of the reduced and oxidized mediator species, the concentration of specific additives (4-tert-butylpyridine, lithium tetrafluoroborate, and chenodeoxycholic acid) and the thickness of the TiO2 working electrode. These studies were carried out with a new donor–π–acceptor sensitizer K4. Maximum energy conversion efficiencies of 3.8% at simulated one Sun irradiation (AM 1.5 G; 1000 W m−2) with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 765 mV, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 7.8 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72 were obtained. Application of the commercially available MK2 and N719 sensitizers resulted in an energy conversion efficiency of 4.4% with a VOC of 733 mV and a JSC of 8.6 mA cm−2 for MK2 and a VOC of 771 mV and a JSC of 7.9 mA cm−2 for N719. Both dyes exhibit higher incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) than K4.

With the possibility of the earth's oil reserves potentially depleting before the end of this century, it is essential to develop sustainable and renewable energy sources that can fulfil the world's ever increasing energy demand while at the same time minimizing the detrimental effects of the present day energy utilization on climate, the environment and health. Among the energy sources available, solar energy is expected to play a crucial role as a future sustainable energy source.

The dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) is one promising technology that mimics the natural photosynthetic process where sunlight is directly converted to usable energy. The sensitizer in the DSC absorbs the incident sunlight and induces the electron transfer within the cell, imitating the role of chlorophyll in a green leaf. DSCs can also harvest solar energy at low cost, low payback times and with energy conversion efficiencies of >12%. As shown in Fig. 1, DSCs are typically composed of a dye-sensitized mesoporous semiconductor electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte containing a redox couple. The electrolyte facilitates charge transfer between the two electrodes and dye regeneration. The latter is accomplished through electron transfer from the reduced redox species to the photo-oxidized dye.
The redox mediator should possess the following key properties in order to be suitable for DSC applications: (i) low absorption in the visible region (400–800 nm) so that it does not compete with the dye for the incident photons; (ii) fast and selective electron transfer to the oxidized dye (dye regeneration) and from the counter electrode to the oxidized form of the mediator; and (iii) a high diffusion coefficient to ensure quick ionic charge transport across a cell gap of typically ≥10 μm.
Iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) has been the most widely investigated redox mediator in DSCs. However, in recent years the corrosiveness and complex two-electron redox chemistry have fuelled the search for alternative electrolytes. Excellent device performances have been achieved with substitutes such as ferrocene (Fc/Fc+), a variety of cobalt complexes and organic compounds. A large number of cobalt compounds, such as [Co(phen)3]2+/3+, [Co(dtb)3]3+/2+, [Co(dmb)3]3+/2+, [Co(terpy)2]2+/3+, [Co(Cl-terpy)2]2+/3+, have been investigated with a variety of sensitizers (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, dtb = 4,4′-ditertiary-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine, dtm = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine and terpy = 2,2′,6′,2′′-terpyridine). In a recent remarkable achievement, the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox couple was applied in DSCs in combination with an organic donor–acceptor dye and a porphyrin dye to achieve a photo-voltage of almost 1.0 V and a power conversion efficiency of 12.3%.
Our group has very recently investigated the application of the cobalt complexes of higher denticity (pentadentate and hexadentate) polypyridyl ligands as redox shuttles in DSCs and has found that the stability of the devices is substantially improved. In addition, the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was shown to be a suitable replacement for the traditional I−/I3− redox couple with a light to electricity conversion efficiency of 7.5%, arising from the more favourable redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ electrolyte compared to that of the I−/I3− electrolyte. Other examples of redox mediators recently used in DSCs include copper complexes, nickel complexes, Br−/Br2, SCN−/SCN2, SeCN−/SeCN2 and organic redox couples, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, TEMPO. Due to their instability, energy incompatibility with sensitizer dyes or their intrinsic low diffusion coefficients in the electrolytes, these redox couples have shown lower efficiencies than the I−/I3− redox couple.
In searching for less toxic metal complexes to apply in DSCs, we have investigated a new electrolyte based on the tris(acetylacetonato) manganese(III)/(IV), [Mn(acac)3]0/1+, complexes (Fig. 2(a)). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the application of a manganese compound as a DSC redox mediator has been reported. It is noteworthy that due to the natural abundance, low toxicity and appropriate redox chemistry of manganese, a Mn cluster has evolved in nature to play the crucial role of regenerating the dye following light induced oxidation during the process of photosynthesis. The acac ligand offers the possibility of fine-tuning the redox potential of these complexes through the modification of the acac ligand at either the central methylene or the terminal methyl groups.
In this paper, we have optimized the performance of [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based DSCs in conjunction with a new organic sensitizer, K4 (Fig. 2(c)). The influence of the composition of the electrolyte, the titanium dioxide working electrode (WE) thickness and the counter electrode (CE) was studied. Four different types of CE were tested, viz. thermally decomposed platinum/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), sputter-coated Pt/FTO, sputter-coated gold/FTO, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/FTO. The concentrations of the redox couple, 4-tertiary-butylpyridine (tBP), lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) and chenodeoxycholic acid (cheno), were all considered in the optimization of the electrolyte composition. Testing of the optimized [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ redox couple with a commercial organic sensitizer, MK2, and a ruthenium sensitizer, N719 (Fig. 2(b)), led to an efficiency of 4.4%.

Reagents and chemicals were, unless otherwise specified, purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Merck Specialty Chemicals (Sydney, Australia) and were used as received. The TiO2 paste was purchased from JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd (Kanagawa, Japan). MK2, 2-cyano-3-[5′′′-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-3′,3′′,3′′′,4-tetra-n-hexyl-[2,2′,5′,2′′,5′′,2′′′]-quater thiophen-5-yl] acrylic acid and N719, di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.


The dye, 3-6-(4-(bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyl))-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (K4), was synthesized by reacting the corresponding aldehyde precursor, 6-(4-(bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyl))-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde, under reflux with cyanoacetic acid in a 1:1 chloroform/acetonitrile mixture in the presence of piperidine as base (Fig. S1). 4-(2-Ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole was synthesized via literature procedures. All synthetic and characterization details are provided in the ESI.


A typical [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ electrolyte was prepared by the addition of 0.30 M [Mn(acac)3], 0.10 M nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4), 0.50 M tBP, 0.10 M LiBF4 and 0.010 M chenodeoxycholic acid in acetonitrile. The concentrations of these components were changed in some experiments as described in the particular sections. For comparison, DSCs were also constructed with a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte, containing 0.165 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2, 0.045 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3, 0.80 M tBP and 0.10 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile, and an I−/I3− electrolyte, containing 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M tBP, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) and 0.10 M guanidium thiocyanate (GuSCN) in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15 vol%).


The mesoporous TiO2 working electrode was fabricated with a 2 μm transparent TiO2 (anatase) layer (30 nm particle size) and a 2 μm scattering TiO2 (anatase) layer (400 nm particle size) by screen-printing. The film was then sintered at 500 °C and treated with a 20 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution. Prior to device assembly, the TiO2 films were re-sintered at 500 °C for 30 minutes and immersed hot (ca. 60 °C) in a dye solution of either MK2 (0.30 mM MK2) in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and toluene, K4 (0.30 mM K4 and 5.0 mM cheno) in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethanol and chlorobenzene or N719 (0.30 mM N719) in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of tertiary-butanol and acetonitrile for 16 hours at room temperature.


Pre-drilled FTO films were used to prepare the Pt/FTO counter electrodes. One drop of 10 mM of hexachloroplatinic acid in isopropanol was added to the conductive side of each film, smeared with a Pasteur pipette, and allowed to dry. The film was then heated at ca. 400 °C for 15 minutes using a heat gun. For the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/FTO counter electrodes, a solution consisting of 0.10 M of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 0.10 M of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile was used to deposit PEDOT using a three-electrode system. A pre-drilled FTO film was used as the working electrode, with a platinum wire mesh as the counter electrode and a platinum wire as the reference electrode. A constant potential (1.1 V) was applied for 30 seconds to electro-polymerize EDOT into PEDOT on the glass surface. Sputter-coated metal/FTO counter electrodes were also used and were prepared by direct current sputtering the metal (gold or platinum were used) on cleaned FTO glass under argon at 4 × 10−12 Torr for 10 minutes.


The CE and the WE were sealed using a 25 μm thick 6 × 6 mm Surlyn gasket (Solaronix). Vacuum back filling was used to insert the electrolyte into the cell. The back filling hole was then sealed with a piece of aluminium-backed Surlyn prepared by melting 25 μm Surlyn onto aluminium foil at 120 °C.


Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of DSCs under dark and illuminated conditions were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A sun simulator by Oriel (1000 W Xe lamp) was used to produce simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2). The output of the light source was calibrated using a silicon photodiode covered with a KG3 filter (Peccell Technologies, Japan). Light intensities were adjusted by using a filter wheel equipped to place an appropriate mesh filter in the light path.

A Xe lamp (Oriel, 150 W) and a monochromator (Cornerstone 260) were used to generate monochromatic light to characterize the spectral response, or IPCE (Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency), of the DSCs. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used to measure the photo-currents under short-circuit conditions and monochromatic illumination. The output of the light source was calibrated by a silicon photodiode (Peccell Technologies, Japan). An area slightly smaller than the active area of the test cell was used as the illumination spot.

IMVS/IMPS experiments were performed in an earthed Faraday dark-box where the noise was eliminated at low light intensities. A circular LED array (Luxeonstar), which consists of seven red (610 nm) LEDs (LXML-PM01-010) with a concentrating cluster lens, Polymer 263 – a Fibre Optic Concentrator, was used. The centre LED was modulated to a depth of ca. 2% using a purpose built LED driver with an adjustable DC offset and a Stanford lock-in-amplifier (SR810). The illumination intensity was varied by a set of neutral density filters and further light intensities were accessed by switching the outer ring LEDs off and on. A purpose built battery powered high impedance voltage follower (input impedance 1012 Ω) was used to measure the photo-voltage and a battery powered current pre-amplifier (Stanford SR570) was used to measure the photo-current. The phase and amplitude of the resultant alternating photo-current (or photo-voltage) were captured using the lock-in amplifier (SR810) under computer control (Labview).


The setup for the charge extraction measurements was identical to that in previous literature and the same light source was used as described in the IMVS/IMPS measurements. A Ni USB 6251 BNC data acquisition board was used to record the data. The results were reported after correction for the porosity of the TiO2 film (0.64, EC/TiO2 0.8).


The redox potential of the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ redox couple in the electrolyte was measured using the rest potential method. A two-electrode setup with Ag/AgNO3 (0.59 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode, NHE) as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the working electrode was employed. The electrolyte consisted of 0.50 M [Mn(acac)3], 0.10 M NOBF4, 1.20 M tBP, 0.050 M LiBF4 and 0.010 M cheno in acetonitrile. The potential at the Pt working electrode was recorded as the redox potential of the electrolyte.


In this study, manganese complexes have been introduced as DSC redox mediators. Our interest was drawn towards manganese due to number of potential advantages. Unlike conventional I−/I3−, the manganese redox couple is a one-electron, outer-sphere redox mediator, which could promote fast dye regeneration. The low toxicity of manganese is a further advantage that could lead to more environmentally friendly devices. We have selected the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ redox couple specifically as its redox potential is appropriately positioned to be applied in conjunction with organic sensitizers with good visible light absorption properties.

The UV-Visible spectra of [Mn(acac)3] and [Mn(acac)3]BF4 show absorption maxima at 550 nm and 543 nm (Fig. S2) with molar extinction coefficients of 74.9 M−1 cm−1 and 143 M−1 cm−1, respectively. A comparison of the UV-visible spectra of the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ electrolyte and a typical [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte (Fig. S3) shows that the former has a much lower absorption of visible light. Thus, [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based electrolytes have the potential to improve DSC performance by reducing the competitive light absorption with the sensitizer.
The performance of [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ as a DSC redox mediator was tested with two donor–π–acceptor dyes with compatible energy levels and high molar extinction coefficients. This ensured excellent light harvesting, even when adsorbed onto relatively thin (∼4 μm) TiO2 films. Use of this thickness is reported to minimize charge recombination at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The first sensitizer was a new pyrrole dye, K4, which has a half-wave potential of 0.82 V vs. NHE and a molar extinction coefficient of 50700 M−1 cm−1 at 516 nm in acetonitrile. Secondly, an optimized redox mediator was tested with a commercially available carbazole dye (MK2) which has a redox potential of 0.92 V vs. NHE and a molar extinction coefficient of 38400 M−1 cm−1 at 441 nm in acetonitrile. Adsorption of K4 onto TiO2 was routinely performed in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid as a co-adsorbent, as this was reported to improve DSC performance by reducing dye aggregation and improving surface passivation. The compatibility of [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ with metal based sensitizers was also tested using N719, a dye with a redox potential of 0.95 V vs. NHE and molar extinction coefficient of 14700 M−1 cm−1 at 535 nm in ethanol.
A comparison of the redox potential of a [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based electrolyte and the HOMO and LUMO levels of K4, MK2 and N719 is shown in Fig. 3. The redox potential of the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based electrolyte is +0.49 V vs. NHE which is 140 mV higher than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (+0.35 V vs. NHE), indicating the suitability of this redox couple for use in DSCs. The dye regeneration driving force was about 0.50 V for all three, K4, MK2 and N719. Optimization of device performance was initially carried out using K4 as a sensitizer.
In the first instance, four different counter electrodes – thermally decomposed Pt/FTO, sputter-coated Pt/FTO, sputter-coated Au/FTO and PEDOT/FTO – were tested to determine which one would lead to the best performing devices. A common electrolyte composition was used (0.20 M [Mn(acac)3], 0.10 M [Mn(acac)3]BF4, 0.10 M LiBF4 and 0.50 M tBP in acetonitrile) and the working electrode consisted of a 4 μm transparent TiO2 layer and a 6 μm scattering TiO2 layer sensitized with K4. PEDOT was found to be the most suitable catalyst for the manganese electrolyte; yielding a higher JSC (6.6 mA cm−2) and FF (0.75) than the others (Table S6). To further confirm the data observed for the characteristic I–V measurements, symmetric cells (counter electrode–electrolyte–counter electrode) were constructed. As shown in Fig. 4, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on symmetric cells comprising identical counter-electrodes filled with the electrolyte. The PEDOT-based cells showed the lowest charge transport resistance (Table S7) towards the manganese based electrolyte at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface which contributes to an improved performance of devices assembled with PEDOT over other counter electrodes.
In the subsequent device optimization, the concentrations of the redox mediators and additives were varied to determine the optimal electrolyte composition. K4 sensitized TiO2 films (4 μm transparent layer and 6 μm scattering layer) were used as the working electrode throughout this optimization process. To optimize the [Mn(acac)3]/[Mn(acac)3]+ ratio, a series of cells were constructed with electrolytes having different ratios of reduced to oxidized complexes, generated by the addition of NOBF4 to [Mn(acac)3], as well as constant tBP (0.50 M) and LiBF4 (0.10 M). As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1, there was a slight increase in efficiency of up to 2.9% upon increasing [Mn(acac)3] from 0.20 M to 0.50 M which was followed by a decrease from 2.9% to 1.9% upon a further increase to 1.0 M. At 1.0 M [Mn(acac)3], a significant drop in JSC was observed, from ∼5.5 mA cm−2 to 3.1 mA cm−2. For the intermediate 4:1 ratio with 0.40 M [Mn(acac)3] and 0.10 M [Mn(acac)3]BF4 (again formed using NOBF4), the DSC performance parameters were η = 2.8%, VOC = 712 mV, JSC = 5.6 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.74.
Lithium salts are commonly used in DSCs as additives to improve the charge diffusion inside the titania film and to control the conduction band edge of TiO2. Moreover, this shifts the conduction band of the TiO2 to a more positive potential (vs. NHE) and thus improves the injection of electrons from the sensitizer into the titania film. Optimization of the lithium salt concentration at fixed levels of [Mn(acac)3] (0.50 M), NOBF4 (0.10 M) and tBP (0.50 M) improved the efficiency to 3.1% when using 0.050 M LiBF4 (Fig. S5, Table S2), which arose from minor increases in VOC (723 mV) and JSC (5.8 mA cm−2). Improved charge diffusion inside the titanium dioxide film may have led to the higher JSC observed at this concentration. Further increases in the LiBF4 concentration resulted in a slight decrease in efficiency due to a decrease in JSC (4.6 mA cm−2).
The addition of tBP shifts the position of the conduction band edge of the titanium dioxide negatively to yield a higher VOC, and also passivates the surface of TiO2. Therefore, the effect of varying the tBP concentration was studied at fixed levels of [Mn(acac)3] (0.50 M), NOBF4 (0.10 M) and LiBF4 (0.050 M). A DSC efficiency of 3.6% was observed upon increasing the tBP concentration to 1.20 M, which was accompanied by significant increases in VOC to 772 mV and JSC to 6.9 mA cm−2 (Fig. S6 and Table S3). One origin of the improved performance could be a reduction in charge recombination arising from passivation of TiO2 surface states through interaction with tBP.
An examination of the effect of the thickness of the transparent and scattering TiO2 layers on device performance (Fig. S7 and Table S4) indicated that the device efficiencies decrease when the thickness of the transparent layer was increased from 2 to 4 μm. In addition, devices made with a 4 μm scattering layer showed higher efficiencies than those made with 2 and 6 μm scattering layers. Consequently, TiO2 films with a 2 μm transparent layer and a 4 μm scattering layer were used in subsequent studies. Thinner films have been found to result in devices with higher electron lifetime due to a reduction of interfacial recombination enhancing the charge collection efficiency.
Chenodeoxycholic acid (cheno) is commonly used as a co-adsorbent in dye solutions to minimize dye aggregation onto TiO2 surfaces. Recent reports show that the addition of cheno in the electrolyte improves the device performance as it can block the access of the oxidized species in the electrolyte to the TiO2 surface and thereby reducing the degree of recombination. Furthermore, the presence of cheno in the electrolyte has been reported to provide a ‘repair mechanism’ for any part of the TiO2 that becomes exposed over time. The addition of cheno beyond 5 mM improved JSC (>7.5 mA cm−2) compared to the devices without cheno (JSC < 6.9 mA cm−2). There was no variation in device efficiency (3.8% to 3.9%) when 5.0 mM to 10.0 mM cheno was added, indicating that the dye layer absorbed onto the TiO2 is dense and benefits only slightly from cheno as an additive (Fig. S8 and Table S5). At higher concentrations a decrease in efficiency arising from a decrease in VOC and JSC was observed. A maximum VOC of 765 mV and a JSC of 7.8 mA cm−2 were observed at 10.0 mM cheno.
The results of these studies led to an optimized [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based electrolyte composition which was used in assembling DSCs with MK2 and N719 as sensitizers. Characteristic I–V curves of the optimized K4, MK2 and N719 devices are presented in Fig. 5 and JSC, VOC, FF and efficiency are summarized in Table 1.

A slightly higher VOC (765 mV vs. 733 mV) and a fill factor (0.72 vs. 0.69) was observed for the K4 and N719 in comparison to the MK2 devices. In contrast, the current density generated by the MK2 devices (8.6 mA cm−2) was higher than that of the devices with K4 (7.8 mA cm−2) and N719 (7.9 mA cm−2). These results are further supported by the IPCE curves (Fig. 5). Overall, the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ electrolyte shows a maximum conversion efficiency of 3.9% with K4, 4.4% with MK2 and N719 at simulated one Sun (1000 W m−2) irradiation. The results of the TiO2 layer thickness optimization for N719 are provided in Table S9 (ESI). The compatibility of [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ with both metal-free (K4, MK2) and metal based (N719) sensitizers highlighted another advantage of this DSC redox mediator.
The IPCE values reflect the ratio of photo-current density produced in the external circuit under monochromatic illumination to the photon flux that strikes the cell. With K4 sensitized DSCs, a maximum IPCE of 48% was obtained at 495 nm with an average integrated current density of 5.7 mA cm−2 and N719 based devices achieved an IPCE of 50% at 525 nm with an average integrated current density of 6.93 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5). In contrast, the MK2 sensitized cells showed better photon to current conversion efficiencies over the 400–600 nm wavelength range (54% at 475 nm) than other two dyes, which yielded a higher integrated current density (7.5 mA cm−2). The observed current densities for K4 and MK2 devices reflect the narrow IPCE curves, which indicate the low light harvesting efficiency below ∼400 nm and above ∼600 nm. The IPCE curve for N719 is broader than for the other dyes but the maximum IPCE is still lower than that of MK2. The lower IPCE observed for the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based devices is explained by the IMVS/IMPS data (Fig. 6(b)) for [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based DSCs where the lifetime of the electrons injected into TiO2 is an order of magnitude shorter than for the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− based devices. A lower current density results from higher charge recombination within [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based devices.
Finally, the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based electrolyte was compared with conventional I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ based electrolytes in conjunction with MK2 under identical conditions. The I–V, IPCE and IMVS/IMPS studies were carried out for comparison. The I–V data (Fig. S9, Table S8) showed that the devices based on the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ couple perform better than devices with I−/I3− and [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ with an energy conversion efficiency of 6.1% (VOC = 820 mV, JSC = 10.6 mA cm2, FF = 0.70). The lower efficiencies of both I−/I3− and [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based devices are due to the lower current density and the open circuit voltage generated. The IPCE data (Fig. S10) are in good agreement with I–V data, where [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ based devices reached the highest IPCE (ca. 70%) followed by I−/I3− (ca. 60%) and [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ (ca. 54%) based devices.
IMVS/IMPS along with charge extraction measurements were carried out to further analyse the electron lifetime within these devices. The mean charge transport time (τd) of electrons within the TiO2 film was determined by the IMPS measurements (Fig. S11) which was found to be similar in all three devices based on [Mn(acac)3]0/1+, I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ in conjunction with MK2. The electron lifetime within the TiO2 film was determined using IMVS (Fig. 6). According to these results, the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based devices have a shorter electron lifetime compared to [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− based devices which results in the lower current density (Table S8), as explained above. As anticipated, the more positive redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (0.56 V vs. NHE) compared with that of [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ (0.49 V vs. NHE), and the longer electron lifetime lead to a higher VOC for the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ based devices. A favourable shift in the conduction band of TiO2 in I−/I3− based devices did not result in a higher VOC due to the lower redox potential of the electrolyte (ca. 0.36 V vs. NHE). Overall, recombination losses are limiting the device performance of the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based DSCs.
The application of more strongly absorbing dyes could be one way to improve device performance. An alternative approach could include strategies to limit recombination losses by adding insulating coatings to the TiO2 film, modifying the dye and/or adding bulky alkyl chains to the acetylacetonato ligand.

In this study, we have applied a low toxicity metal-based redox couple, [Mn(acac)3]0/1+, and a novel donor–π–acceptor dye, K4 in the dye sensitized solar cell, a promising technology that mimics key natural photosynthetic processes. The optimization of the composition of the electrolyte, the counter electrode and the working electrode led to a 3.8% conversion efficiency for devices sensitized with K4 under a simulated one Sun (1000 W m−2) irradiation. Use of the optimized electrolyte in conjunction with the MK2 and N719 dyes resulted in a higher energy conversion efficiency (4.4%) than for K4. This highlights the compatibility of the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based redox mediator with both metal-free and metal based sensitizers. The electron lifetime of [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ based DSCs is shorter than that of reported I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ based DSCs, which indicates faster electron recombination at the photoelectrode and results in lower efficiencies of the [Mn(acac)3]0/1+ DSCs. Modification of the dye and the acetylacetonate ligand with the bulky alkyl chain could reduce charge recombination reactions and lead to a longer electron lifetime within the TiO2 film. Substitution of electron withdrawing groups, such as halogens in the acetylacetonate ligand, would pave the way to developing manganese redox couples with more positive redox potentials that may lead to DSCs with higher open circuit voltages.
