Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites as new emerging functional materials stand out from numerous photovoltaic materials thanks to the unprecedentedly rapid improvement of their power conversion efficiency within a short period. To explore potentially more efficient photovoltaic candidates, the structural and electronic properties of FAxMA1−xPbI3 based on prototype MAPbI3 are investigated for superior performance. Specifically, structural relaxation is performed at the PBE+D2 level and the electronic and optical properties are investigated at the HSE + SOC level. Optical simulations show that significantly improved performance can be successfully achieved by means of the injection of FA cations. Moreover, the calculations of defect formation energies imply that MA-poor ambient conditions are energetically favorable to synthesize a variety of FA-doped pervoskite compounds FAxMA1−xPbI3 of different ratios. It is interesting to find that compared with the prototype MAPbI3, the optical performance of the perovskite series FAxMA1−xPbI3 is effectively improved with an increase in FA content; meanwhile the relative stability of the perovskite series is also efficiently enhanced. Our study not only sheds new light on further understanding perovskite absorbers but also provides the basic rationale for designing new functional materials used for photovoltaics.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have been attracting increasing attention since methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium, CH3NH3+) was first used as a visible-light sensitizer for photovoltaic applications with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% in 2009. However, at that time, the new finding received little attention due to low efficiency and fast degradation of the liquid electrolyte. Two years later, a quantum-dot-sensitized perovskite solar cell (PSC) was fabricated by Park's group with a PCE of 6.5%, the highest efficiency cell based on inorganic quantum dots reported at that moment, but the work was still not widely focused on because of similar dissolution issues. A key breakthrough in 2012 was the successful manufacture of a solid state PSC with a PCE of 9.7% and a stable performance over a timescale exceeding 500 hours under ambient conditions. From then on, the development of PSCs entered a whole new era. In the same year, Snaith et al. confirmed a non-sensitized PSC with a PCE of 10.9%, characteristic for mixed halide ions in the formula MAPbI3−xClx and coated Al2O3 thin films. In the following year, PSCs with PCEs of 12.3%, 14.1%, and 15.4% were then reported successively based on organic lead iodide perovskite MAPbI3. It is notable that the PCE of PSCs rapidly reached up to the recently verified 22.1% within eight years, and OIHPs can hence stand out among a variety of photovoltaic materials. In addition to their relatively high PCE, both facile fabrication technology and low cost are also quite important for that. Naturally, an enormous amount of research effort has been devoted to pursuing superior photovoltaic performance such as facile solution processability, high absorption coefficient, wide spectral range, large carrier diffusion length, long lifetime, high mobility and small effective masses, low trap-state density and benign grain boundaries. In this regard, the great potential of PSCs is provided by these superior performances, mainly including the replacement of inorganic quantum dots and conventional organic absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Therefore, further understanding the structural and optical properties of OIHPs is imperative to design high performance photovoltaic devices with desired characteristics.

To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis and characterization of prototype perovksite MAPbI3 was first carried out by Weber in 1978. Within the inorganic framework, metal ion Pb2+ with six neighbor halide ions I− constitutes so-called [PbI6]4− octahedrons, and apparently, iodide ions can be divided into two kinds, equatorial and apical. Moreover, [PbI6]4− octahedrons are corner-connected by iodide ions. Organic molecule MA is located at the center of four [PbI6]4− octahedrons, in other words, each organic cation is coordinated with twelve iodide anions. Additionally, the structure and symmetry of perovskites is closely related to ambient temperature, which has been confirmed by previous experiments. Generally, an ideal cubic perovskite (Pm3m space group) exists when the temperature is higher than 330.4 K. And then, a tetragonal phase is found under the conditions of 161.4 K < t < 330.4 K. At low temperatures of below 161.4 K, the perovskite would be distorted into the orthorhombic phase. In addition to the common three phases, the cubic phase may convert to a hexagonal phase named as the δ-phase, which is not a typical perovskite structure, at temperatures of below 360 K, usually existing at a liquid interface. Accordingly, the enhancement of symmetry means a higher ambient temperature, which has been proposed to mostly depend on the octahedron distortion and the rotation of the MA cation within a Pb–I inorganic framework. Among perovskite structures reported to date, the site of the MA cation in the orthorhombic phase is only experimentally fixed at a temperature of below 161.4 K. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that the lattice constants in the orthorhombic phase almost remain invariant at low temperature. Consequently, the orthorhombic perosvkite MAPbI3 is chosen as a prototype model for the present study.
The prototype perovskite MAPb3 has a resulting symmetry arising out of the lattice distortion and the rotation of organic cations within lead–halide inorganic matrices. It has been demonstrated that the edges of the band gap are mainly occupied by inorganic matrices rather than organic cations, and organic cations act to maintain charge neutrality and the band gap closely depends on the length of inorganic metal–halide bonds. However, the size of organic cations plays an important role in the expansion or contraction of the whole lattice arising from the substitution doping of larger or smaller organic cations. Then formamidinium (FA = formamidinium, NH2CHNH2+) lead halide perovskites FAPbX3 (X = halide) have been demonstrated with a tunable band gap range of 1.48–2.23 eV. We emphasize here that the band gap of 1.48 eV has been demonstrated to be the most suitable for single junction solar cells. Moreover, large electron and hole diffusion lengths are observed in the perovskite, which is favorable for the fabrication of planar heterojunction solar cells. In addition, to efficiently enhance light harvesting ability, different mixing proportions of MA and FA in the A site of perovskite APbI3 are used for extending the optical absorption onset into the red, which has been experimentally confirmed. So far, numerous theoretical studies on metal ion doping and halide ion doping based on OIHPs have been widely reported, however, with respect to the organic cation mixing based on prototype pervoskite MAPbI3, for the time being the systematic rationale is still uncertain, which is the main motivation for this work.

All the theoretical calculations have been conducted without any symmetry constraint, applying the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code based on density functional theory (DFT). The valence electron configurations involved in the calculations are shown as H (1s1), C (2s22p2), N (2s22p3), Pb (5d106s26p2), and I (5s25p5), respectively, and the ion–electron interaction is described by means of the projected augmented wave (PAW) method. Under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the exchange correlation functional developed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted for the structural and electronic properties calculations. For the present work, periodic boundary conditions are included in all three dimensions. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a Γ-centered k-point mesh of 4 × 4 × 4 in the Monkhorst–Park scheme, and the plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV. In the meantime, all the structures in this work were fully relaxed with a conjugate gradient algorithm, and the convergence criteria were set so that the total energy variation per atom is less than 1 × 10−5 eV and the Hellmann–Feynman forces per atom are smaller than 20 meV Å−1. In addition, for OIHPs, van der Waals interaction has been demonstrated to play an important role in their stable phases,i.e., the lattice parameters delivered by inclusion of van der Waals interactions agree well with the experimental values. In all calculations the PBE+D2 method was hence employed to account for dispersion forces by applying semi-empirical pairwise interaction corrections. Note that further tests on greater cutoff energy and denser k-points showed negligible difference in the resulting configuration, so the results in the paper are reliable. Besides, according to previous reports, the band gap determined by first-principles calculations without the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was in good agreement with experimental results. And the accuracy is an accidental coincidence, moreover, it is attributed to the cancelation of correlation and relativistic (SOC) effects, both of which have opposite values.

Besides, to exactly characterize the electronic properties, a screened hybrid functional HSE06 developed by Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof is applied to obtain a correction. In light of the definition of HSE06, the exchange–correlation energy is in the following form:
EHSEXC = χESRX (μ) + (1 − χ)EPBE,SRX (μ) + EPBE,LRX (μ) + EPBEC,
(1)
where the electronic correlation part is also referenced to the PBE density functional, while the exchange interaction part is divided into two terms of the short-range and the long-range, SR and LR for short. In the present work, a screening parameter of 0.2 and mixing coefficient of 0.38 are set to gain the exact band gap. In the meanwhile, considering the speed and accuracy of the calculations at the HSE + SOC level,
Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 3 k-point grids are chosen for k-point sampling in the Brillouin zone and the cutoff energy of 400 eV is used for the plane-wave basis. The lower convergence criterion of 1 × 10−4 eV is used for the total energy change per atom, then as for the Hellmann-Feynman forces per atom the threshold was still set to be 0.02 eV Å−1. Note that optical properties are here simulated with a dense Γ-centered k-point mesh of 8 × 8 × 8 in the PBE+D2 level. For all the investigated perovskite series, the density of states (DOS) and partial DOS are at the level of HSE06 + SOC, while lattice relaxations and static state calculations are at the level of PBE+D2.


A classical OIHP exists with the formula ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation such as Cs+, MA, or FA, B is a divalent metal cation such as Pb2+, Sn2+, or Ge2+, and X is a halide anion of Cl−, Br−, or I−. To get more insight into the structures of halide perovskites, we here introduce the tolerance factor t initially presented by Goldschmidt in 1926, given by

(2)
And another important parameter is the octahedral factor
μ proposed by Li et al. in 2008, defined as

(3)
where
Ri (i = A, B, X) denotes the ionic radius of the corresponding element. With regard to halide perovskites, they are usually in the ranges of 0.813 < t < 1.107 and 0.377 < μ < 0.895. As a matter of fact, the lowest limitation of the octahedral factor should be 0.442 for a stable perovksite structure, otherwise, perovskite structures cannot be expected even though ones have favorable tolerance factors. Moreover, it is notable that the limitation of RA > RB must be satisfied to preserve the basic perovksite structures. In other words, crystallographic stability and possible structures can be deduced according to the above definitions. In particular, the tolerance factor quantifies the structure mismatch by applying packed rigid spheres instead of the ions. Moreover, in accordance with the empirical conditions, the tolerance factor should be limited within the range of 0.97–1.03, necessary for the achievement of an ideal cubic perovskite. Once the tolerance factor is lower than 0.97, cooperative octahedron rotations will result in the tendency of loosening, with movement toward lower symmetry such as tetragonal, orthorhombic, and even rhombohedral structures. In addition, considering that the size of the metal lead ion is already large in archetype MAPbI3, a larger FA cation is a good choice to substitute the MA cation for the sake of the enhancement of stability. In the present case, nevertheless, the picture becomes complicated due to two additional ingredients: (a) the chemical mixing of MA and FA, and (b) the non-sphericity of the organic molecules; detailed discussion can be found in ref. 60. For the present study, both MA and FA cations are considered as ordinary atoms with the radii of rMA = 1.8 Å,rFA = 1.9–2.2 Å, respectively, and the radii of other constituents are shown as lead ion rPb2+ = 1.19 Å and iodide ion rI− = 2.2 Å. Naturally, with respect to the investigated perovskite, the tolerance factors are 0.834 for MAPbI3, and 0.855–0.918 for FAPbI3 and the octahedral factors are all 0.541 neglecting the effect of organic cations, in good agreement with the restricted range proposed in ref. 59.

The investigated unit cell is composed of four MAPbI3 units, as shown in Fig. 1, the orthorhombic phase structure reported by Baikie et al. The corresponding lattice parameters are taken from the experimental values of a = 8.8706, b = 13.1255, c = 8.6364. Given that four MAPbI3 units are contained in the lattice, we here simulate FAxMA1−xPbI3 with five values of x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, where the values of x = 0 and 1 correspond to the pure phases of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. In particular, for the cases of x = 0.25 and 0.75 all the possible substitution sites are approximately equivalent by testing, and for the case of x = 0.5 the three possible substitutions are considered respectively, shown as x = 0.5a, 0.5b, and 0.5c in the lower panel of Fig. 1. Specifically, with respect to doping sites along the [001] view, x = 0.5a refers to the substitution in the [100] direction, as seen from Fig. 1, x = 0.5c indicates the one in the [010] direction, and x = 0.5b roughly corresponds to the case in the diagonal direction. Note that the structural models in all the cases and the following charge distributions are rendered using the VESTA package. Optimized lattice parameters of perovksite compounds are indicated in Table 1. It is notable that Expansion, ΔV% refers to the volume change compared to the prototype perovskite MAPbI3, which arises out of large-size cation doping. In other words, the volumes of the perovksite series based on archetype MAPbI3 increase apparently with the FA-doped concentration up to the formation of pure trigonal phase FAPbI3, which is directly associated with the fact that rFA > rMA. Moreover, the formation enthalpy for the investigated system can be calculated by

E(X) denotes the total energy of the investigated system, μi is the chemical potential of constituent elements in the bulk and n refers to the number of the same kinds of atoms. niμi(bulk) hence indicates the total energy of the ith component element in the equlibrium bulk phase. As shown in Table 1, all the formation enthalpies are negative, which means that it is favorable to fabricate perovskite compounds.

To get insight into intrinsic characteristics, we here discuss the electronic properties of the perovskite series. As is known to us, the electron band gap is primarily determined by the sites of both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM). For the present work, in all cases the energy at the top of the valence band is set to zero. For prototype MAPbI3 labeled as FA-0.0 in Fig. 2, the bottom of the conduction band is mainly composed of a Pb-6p electron state with weak coupling with I ions, indicating the ionicity of MAPbI3. By contrast, the top of the valence band is chiefly composed of Pb-6s and I-5p electron states involving strong anti-bonding coupling. The electronic states in the edge of the band gap are in good agreement with previous investigations, and hardly involve organic cations as mentioned before. Specifically, the cases of FA-0.5a, FA-0.5b and FA-0.5c are referenced to the right panel in Fig. 2(e)–(g). The three cases indicate that two FA cations replace two MA cations in three different ways based on prototype MAPbI3. It is noteworthy that no impurity states exist in all cases, which means that the optimum electronic band gap delivers satisfactory photovoltaic ability. The band gaps of the cases of FA-0.25, 0.5a, 0.5b, 0.5c and 0.75 are 1.64 eV, 1.59 eV, 1.68 eV, 1.63 eV and 1.57 eV, respectively. Based on the analysis, the case of FA-0.75 corresponds to the optimum optical performance among all the FA-doped series with the exception of pure FAPbI3, which is attributed to the suitable band gap of 1.57 eV.

To gain more insight into the electronic properties, we next examine the Bader charge analysis of the FA-doped series. As shown in Table 2, the signs of plus and minus are referenced to positive charge and negative charge carried by each element, respectively. Note that all Bader charge analyses are statistically averaged in light of each element, including Pb, Ia (apical iodide ions), Ie (equatorial iodide ions), C, H, and N. The impact of organic cations in the case of FA-0.25 is apparently weaker than that of the other FA-doped series, which was implied by obviously reduced charge transfer. In other words, the behavior is in good agreement with few improvements of optical performance in the case of FA-0.25. By comparing the cases of FA-0.5a, FA-0.5b with FA-0.5c, we find that the cases of FA-0.5a and FA-0.5b are relatively close to each other while the case of FA-0.5c is quite different in terms of Bader charge analysis of organic cations. Among all of the FA-doped series, the effect of organic cations in the case of FA-0.75 is the most notable according to the Bader charge analysis, which means that the biggest lattice distortion arising from the injection of FA cations to prototype MAPbI3.

To probe more intrinsic characteristics of the electronic properties, we further discuss the charge distributions for the represented cases of FA-0.0, FA-0.25, FA-0.75 and FA-1.0. Fig. 3 shows the isosurface plot of charge distributions of the CBM (the upper panel) and VBM (the lower panel) in the four cases with the order of (a)–(d). Similar to the DOS discussed earlier in Fig. 2, organic cations also have little contribution to the electronic states of the CBM or VBM near the band gap edge. Moreover, the charge distributions at the bottom of the conduction band are mainly centered around the metal lead, while the ones at the top of the valence band are heavily focused on metal lead ions and halide iodide ions. And it is obvious that the iodide ions can be divided into two kinds: one is located in the equatorial site, the other lies in the apical site indicated as Fig. 3(a). Combining Bader charge analysis in Table 2, it is implied that the Pb–I bonds for the equatorial iodide ions are stronger than ones in the apical position, because of more charge transfer in the former as compared to the latter. In addition to that, the equatorial iodide ions are located at the center of the charge distributions in terms of the top of the valence band, which is in good agreement with the above analysis of the DOS in Fig. 2. In other words, based on the charge distributions of the band gap edges, it is revealed that the charge distributions are specifically concentrated on the equatorial iodide ions instead of all iodide ions. Nevertheless, the situation is apparently changed because of the injection of FA cations shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). In particular, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the apical iodide ions also become the center of charge distributions for the top of the valence band, which implies that the electrons here are more easily excited to the bottom of the conduction band. Naturally, it is unveiled that superior performance can be successfully achieved by the substitution of MA cations with FA cations.

To probe the optical properties of the perovskite series with different doping concentrations, we here employ the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function

(5)
where the parameters of
Ω, ω, μ, r and ψ respectively denote the unit cell volume, photon frequency, the external field vector, the momentum operator and wave functions. The indices of ν and c denote the occupied and unoccupied states at the point of κ in the reciprocal space, respectively. In addition, the real part ε1 and imaginary ε2 parts of the complex dielectric tensor are related to each other through the famous Kramer–Krong relationship:

(6)
where
P refers to the principle value. Then the frequency-dependent optical absorption coefficient can be expressed as

(7)
As shown in
Fig. 4, light harvesting capability is obviously improved due to the injection of FA dopant, particularly in the visible-light range of 416–565 nm, where the inset is an enlarged version for that. It is noteworthy that the absorption coefficients for all the perovskite compounds are significantly enhanced in the whole visible-light range with the exception of FA-0.5b. All of these agree well with the following anaysis of PCE in Table 3 where the cases of FA-0.5b correspond to the minimum PCE. Moreover, the optical capability for FA-0.75 is more apparently improved than the one in the case of FA-0.25. Consequently, the case of FA-0.75 is undoubtedly superior as compared to the other doping proportion.

In addition, to further assess the PSC performance of the FA-doped compounds in different proportions, we herein estimate the corresponding short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltages (VOC) and PCE (η) based on the following equations:
(8)
where the parameters of
e, E, S(E), Eg, Eloss, FF, and Psun respectively denote electronic charge, an incident photon energy, the incident spectral power per unit area, the band gap of the FA-doped perovskite, loss in potential (variable), the fill factor and the total incident power. For one thing, it is assumed that the incidental photons all generate electron–hole pairs after absorption because their energies are larger than the optical band gap, which means that the maximum short-circuit current density is achieved. For another, the open-circuit voltage is also predicted based on the optical band gap of the absorber and Eloss, a variable parameter. Note that we herein adopt the solar spectrum data provided by NREL for the calculations of short-circuit current density and two Eloss values of 0.7 eV and 0.5 eV are used for the calculations of open-circuit voltages. As for the fill factor, the ratio of the area covered by the J(V) curve and the product of JSCVOC, the value of 0.9 is here utilized to match the reported PCE of 17.7% based on single crystals with an Eloss of 0.7 eV. Hence, the simulation is well founded because the same parameters are adapted for the related properties of hypothetical perovskties. As seen from Table 3, the PCE for the FA-doped series reaches up to 18% for the Eloss of 0.7 eV. Notably, the FA-0.75 case exhibits superior performance, which agrees well with the above absorption spectrum analyses. Moreover, in light of Table 3 it is suggested that the optimal PCE of 22% can be realized by means of organic cation mixing. Therefore, it has been theoretically confirmed that optical performance is effectively improved by doping larger size FA cations, which is in accordance with the experiment results reported to date. In this perspective, optical performance is closely associated with lattice distortion arising from the injection of large-size FA cations, though the band gap is not directly related to the electron states of organic cations. In other words, it can be deduced that charge distributions are certain to be apparently changed due to the injection of FA cations. Hence, it is revealed that the improved absorption ability is closely related to the charge distribution change arising from FA cation doping.

As a matter of fact, it is really feasible that optical performance is remarkably improved by substituting MA cations with FA cations, which has been demonstrated experimentally. Particularly the case of MA0.4FA0.6PbI3 reported by Pellet et al. delivered superior photovoltaic performance involving a greater harvesting capability, a longer exciton lifetime and higher short-circuit photocurrents. Based on these predominant properties, PSC devices with PCEs of 14.9% were successfully fabricated under the AM 1.5G simulated solar spectrum. Additionally, the optimal PCE of 13.03% was achieved when the FA content in the perovskite series FAxMA1−xPbI3 was fixed at x = 0.25. With respect to this fact, we deduce that it should be related to the orthorhombic model investigated. Therefore, it is undeniable that the photovoltaic capability of FAxMA1−xPbI3 based on prototype MAPbI3 is significantly improved with the benefits of the injection of FA cations. Although the toxicity of heavy metal lead is not directly alleviated, another perspective suggests that the use level of metal lead will certainly decline, due to mass production of other PSCs, such as those based on FAxMA1−xPbI3.

To further evaluate the availability of mixed perovskite structures, we here examine the defect formation energy defined as

(9)
where
EFAxMA1−xPbI3 and EMAPbI3 denote the total energies of doped and pure perovskite systems, respectively. Then the sum term denotes energy change attributed to composition variation, where μi refers to chemical potential for the atom indexed by i and ni indicates the number of added ni > 0 and reduced ni < 0 atoms based on a chemical reservoir. The last term q is set to be zero because the investigated perovskite compounds here are in the neutral state, where the Fermi energy EF is referenced to the valence band maximum EV in the bulk, and ΔV indicates energy correction due to aligning the reference potential of the system containing defects or impurities with the pure system. The most important two points are as follows: one is that there is no absolute reference standard in terms of the electrostatic potential of distinct periodic systems, the other is that the shift of potential reference resulted by defects or impurities cannot be separately evaluated using the super cell calculations. A preferred method was hence proposed that the correction term ΔV was achieved by re-alignment of electrostatic potential with respect to the doped systems and the pure system, referenced to a site far from the defects or impurities in real space. Accordingly, the correction term ΔV is not considered in the calculations of the defect formation energy, while it is imperative to analyze DOS and partial DOS containing the correction ΔV with reference to the un-doped system. The formation of defects is closely related to growth and annealing conditions in an actual fabrication; with this in mind, the defect formation energy naturally depends on the chemical potentials of the host atoms, reflected by an ambient environment.

To preserve a basic perovskite structure, pure perovksite MAPbI3 is in equilibrium with reservoirs of constituent elements of MA, Pb, and I. In other words, based on thermodynamics equilibrium, the chemical potentials of these component elements must satisfy the following restriction conditions,
μMA + μPb + 3μI = μMAPbI3,
(10)
where
μMAPbI3 refers to the chemical potential of bulk MAPbI3, equal to the total energy of a primitive unit cell of 48 atoms in bulk. μMA, μPb, and μI indicate the chemical potentials of constituent elements, respectively, up to MA(bulk), Pb(metal), and I2(bulk). Note that the bulk MA (the bulk I2) is treated as a single molecule in the cubic unit cell with a lattice parameter of 10 Å. In addition, to spontaneously form bulk MAPbI3, the minimum of μMA should be limited by

μminMA = E(MAnPbnI3n) − E(MAn−1PbnI3n),
(11)
where
EMAnPbnI3n and EMAn−1PbnI3n refer to the total energies of the MAPbI3 perovksite containing n primitive unit cells without and with MA vacancies, respectively. For the dopant of FA cations, similar to the case of MA cations, we also suppose bulk FA (single molecule) as the FA reservoir. To gain straightforward insight, the energy of the bulk MA (single molecule) is set to be zero as the reference point, with the definitions shown as

ΔμMA = μMA − μMA(bulk).
(12)
Following the above definitions, we naturally draw the corresponding specific range denoted as

ΔμminMA ≤ ΔμMA ≤ 0.

The calculated defect formation energies indicate that it is energetically favorable to fabricate the FA-doped perovksite series because all the minima of these are negative as indicated in Fig. 5. In addition, it is suggested that all of the three in-equivalent cases of FA-0.5a, FA-0.5b and FA-0.5c are possible under the same conditions of doping ratios. Moreover, the evaluated defect formation energies in all three cases are expressed in almost the same straight line, i.e. all of three simulated curves coincide with each other. Notably, a perovskite compound of FA-0.75 is more favorable as compared with other doping concentrations, and it exactly corresponds with superior photovoltaic performance shown in Fig. 4. Additionally, it is interesting that the stability of the perovskite series is obviously enhanced by substituting MA cations with FA cations.

First-principles calculations based on DFT have been performed for lattice relaxation and electronic properties of perovskite compounds FAxMA1−xPbI3 based on prototype MAPbI3 in an orthorhombic phase. Our studies have demonstrated that significant red shift and enhancement of the absorption coefficient can be successfully achieved with the benefits of mixing organic cations of MA and FA.

Based on the definition of tolerance factor, it is deduced that the stability of the perovksite series FAxMA1−xPbI3 is apparently enhanced thanks to the large-size FA cations instead of MA cations. Moreover, the absorption spectrum simulations indicate that the superior performance exactly corresponds to the case of FA-0.75 within the range of the visible light spectrum; by contrast, the perovskite series of the other doping proportions show improved ones to a relatively small extent. Additionally, it is energetically favorable to synthesize perovskite series FAxMA1−xPbI3 of different doping concentrations, which has been confirmed by the calculations of defect formation energy. The DOS analyses show that the bottom of the conduction band is mainly occupied by the metal lead of Pb-6p electron states while the top of the valence band is composed of metal lead of Pb-6s and iodide of I-5p orbits, which is similar to previous reports. It is noteworthy that the iodide ions are divided into two kinds: apical and equatorial. As for the prototype one, the top of the valence band is only occupied by the equatorial ions, while the situations vary with the injection of FA cations. Significantly, for the FA-doped series, the electronic states at the top of the valence band involve not only the equatorial iodide ions but also the apical ones, which is quite different from the prototype one. Therefore, it is implied that superior performance should be attributed to charge transfer arising from the injection of FA cations. With respect to the Bader charge analysis, lattice distortion of the perovsktie series is closely related to charge transfer of organic cations. In combination with the charge distributions of the VBM and CBM, it is not difficult to find that not only the lattice distortion but also superior optical capability is directly related to charge transfer for the cases of FA-0.25 and FA-0.75 in particular. Besides, the results are consistent with the experimentally reported cation-mixing PSCs with a PCE of 14.9%, so we expect that our simulations can provide a further insight for designing more efficient photovoltaic materials.
