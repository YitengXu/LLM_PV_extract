Low cost N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) was applied as an effective p-type dopant in 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), an important hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). At the optimum doping concentration, the hole mobility, conductivity, stability, and various performances of the devices were significantly improved, particularly the hole mobility increased by more than 3.5 times from 1.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 4.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This dopant prompted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC device from 16.12% to 19.24% (0.1 cm2, AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with high stability.

Organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells, one of the most promising photovoltaic devices of third generation solar cells, have developed rapidly. In just ten years, the certification efficiency has increased to 25.5% from premier 3.83% in 2009 (ref. 4–7) owing to the high absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, broad absorption range, and tunable bandgap, surpassing the traditional silicon solar cells.

Hole-transporting materials play a critical role in the extraction and collection of the photo-generated holes from the perovskites to the metal electrodes and thus minimize the energy losses as much as possible at the interfaces. Therefore, it is of great concern to seek sort of efficient HTMs, which may be the small organic molecules, polymers, and inorganic materials. As a small organic molecule, Spiro-OMeTAD has an outstanding photoelectric property. However, the pristine Spiro-OMeTAD has a double helix structure, which prevents the molecules from effectively packing on its surface, affecting the photovoltaic efficiency of the PSCs (Fig. 1a). The above-mentioned problems can be alleviated by doping. The doping process is an oxidation or reduction process essentially. The oxidant or reductant used in there is called dopant, and the dopant with oxidation ability is called the p-type dopant, which is an electron acceptor, but the dopants have problems such as tedious preparation and high cost. The most important thing is that they have water absorption ability, which affects the stability of perovskite solar cells. The most common additives are 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide salt (Li-TFSI) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209 Co(III)TFSI salt), which are complicated to operate, expensive, and affect the stability of the device because of the strong absorption in water. In this regard, numerous new p-type dopants have been developed to replace the traditional ones. Wang et al. reported vanadium oxide (V2O5) as a dopant for spiro-OMeTAD to oxidize it rapidly and have accomplished a PCE of 20.5%. Yang et al. reported doping with KMnO4 to adjust the energy level of HTL and enhance the conductivity, which achieved a PCE of 20.03%.
NBS is a type of chemical reagent commonly used in laboratories, and is often used in bromination and addition reactions in organic reactions. It has two carbonyl groups, which have good electron-withdrawing properties and tend to split into succinimide radical and Br radical (Fig. 1b). Spiro-OMeTAD gets oxidized to purple-black rapidly by the succinimide radical, which has the same effect as the traditional additive, FK209 Co(III)TFSI, and the color will be deepened when the powders of the two chemicals are ground together (Fig. 2a and b).

All the chemicals and solvents were used as received, including PbI2 (>98%), PbBr2 (>98%), MABr (>98%), FAI (>98%), CsI (>98%), (Xi'an Pol, China), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) 75% in isopropanol (TiAcAc, Sigma-Aldrich), Spiro-OMeTAD (Dalian HeptaChroma, China), TBP (TCI), Li-TFSI (TCI), NBS (J&K), and all solvents (Innochem). An etched fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass was purchased from Beijing Huamin, China.


The PSC devices were fabricated as formerly reported. The etched FTO glass was cleaned by a detergent, deionized water (two times), acetone, and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. First, the substrates were plasma-cleaned to increase the hydrophilicity. The compact TiO2 layer was deposited onto the substrates by the spray pyrolysis of dilute titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (9:1, v/v) and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. The perovskite solution Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 was prepared in a glove box. FAI (1 M), PbBr2 (0.2 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), and CsI (0.06 M) were mixed in a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) (1:4, v/v) and stirred for more than 2 h. A 0.22 μm filter was used to filter the perovskite solution before spin-coating. The films were prepared via a one-step method at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 5000 rpm for 30 s, dropping 130 μL chlorobenzene at 15 s from the start of 5000 rpm, and the film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The HTM film was deposited above the perovskite layer when it was cooled to room temperature. The Spiro-OMeTAD mixed solution comprised Spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg), t-BP (28.8 μL), Li-TFSI (17.5 μL) (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) and NBS (0, 1 mol%, 2 mol%, 3 mol%, and 4 mol%) dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, an 80 nm Au electrode was accumulated above the HTM via vacuum evaporation.


In order to obtain the redox potential properties of the materials, cyclic voltammetry curves of NBS and Spiro-OMeTAD were measured in a chlorobenzene solution, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, NBS had a higher first redox potential (242.8 mV) than Spiro-OMeTAD (−73.2 mV), and the potential difference between them can provide the driving force for electron transfer from the Spiro-OMeTAD to NBS. The cyclic voltammetry curves show that the first redox potential of the mixed solution after doping with NBS at the concentration of 0, 1%, 2%, and 3% (mole ratio relative to Spiro-OMeTAD) shifts negatively (Fig. 3b). This also proves that the charge transfer happens with the addition of the NBS.

The FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy of NBS, Spiro-OMeTAD, and Spiro-OMeTAD doped NBS were performed and shown in ESI (Fig. S5). No peaks of NBS can be observed, and all peaks of Spiro-OMeTAD almost remained unchanged for the NBS doped in Spiro-OMeTAD both in FT-IR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. This indicated that the basic frame of Spiro-OMeTAD did not change. Fig. 3c and d shows the UV-vis absorption spectra with different addition concentrations of NBS in Spiro-OMeTAD in the chlorobenzene solution. It can be seen that the peak at about 390 nm decreases and a new peak appears at 520 nm and strengthens gradually with the increase in the NBS concentration, which can be attributed to the peak corresponding to the oxidation of Spiro-OMeTAD into cation in the mixed solution. To verify the above hypothesis, Spiro-OMeTAD un-doped and doped with NBS were dissolved in dichloromethane, for which the mass spectrometry (MS) results were obtained (shown in Fig. S1). It can be observed that two new peaks appear at 1321.6 and 1418.6 (m/z), which are 97.1 and 194.1 higher than the peaks of Spiro-OMeTAD (1224.5, m/z). The difference in the molecular weight can be attributed to the NBS with a bromine radical removed, and the mechanism of NBS doping of Spiro-OMeTAD was proposed as follows:
In order to verify the influence of NBS on the charge-conducting properties of Spiro-OMeTAD thin films, the electrical conductivity of Spiro-OMeTAD thin films doped with different proportions of NBS was measured via the double probe conductivity test method. The device configuration is a glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/HTM/Ag (Fig. 4a), in which W is the electrode length (1 cm), L is the distance between the electrodes (0.45 cm), H is the total thickness of TiO2 and HTM (1.8 × 10−5 cm). The electrical conductivity δ can be calculated by the formula δ = kL/HW, where k is the ratio of the current to the applied voltage. The result is shown in Fig. 4c. The electrical conductivity of the un-doped film is 4.18 × 10−5 S cm−1, which is similar to that reported in the references (4.4 × 10−5 S cm−1), and the trifling difference is caused by the different contents of Li-TFSI in the film. The electrical conductivity of Spiro-OMeTAD thin films prepared with 1% NBS increased to 5.26 × 10−5 S cm−1, which is due to NBS doped Spiro-OMeTAD introducing more Spiro-OMeTAD˙+, which can produce the free charge in the thin films. The space charge limited current method (SCLC) is used to study the hole mobility properties of the hole transport materials (Fig. 4d). The device structure is FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. It can be calculated by the formula J = (9/8)με0εr(V2/d3). According to the calculation, the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD doped with various NBS concentrations is shown in Table 1. Compared with the un-doped Spiro-OMeTAD thin film (1.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the hole mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD with 1% NBS is increased to 4.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Experiments show that NBS can not only increase the conductivity of Spiro-OMeTAD thin films, but also increase its hole mobility, which is due to the fact that NBS increases the hole concentration in Sprio-OMeTAD thin films. However, when the concentration of NBS is further increased, NBS ion will be equivalent to a sort of impurity to form a new recombination center on the surface of Spiro-OMeTAD, which will affect the transport of photo-generated holes and thus affect the performance of the devices. This is why the mobility and conductivity achieved the best performance in 1% NBS concentration and the value decreased at higher concentrations. Therefore, it is expected that the power conversion efficiency of PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD will be improved by doping with optimum concentration of NBS.

For the sake of appraising the influence of NBS on the photovoltaic performances of solar cell devices, the J–V curves of solar cells with different doping contents (0–4 mol%) were tested under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and the results are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1. With the optimized concentration (1 mol%), the devices achieve a superior PCE of 19.24% with short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.63 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.16 V, and fill factor (FF) of 73.01% (the un-doped condition is 16.12%, Fig. 5a). This is consistent with the conclusion of conductivity and hole mobility, so the following tests are all tested under optimal conditions. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was carried out to test the devices doped and un-doped NBS, respectively. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5c that the IPCE value of the former device is higher than that of the latter, and the highest value can reach 91%. According to the integral calculation, the JSC of the device with NBS can reach 22 mA cm−2, which is similar to the test result of the J–V curve.

The steady-state photocurrent output properties proceeded under continuous illumination for 300 s, and the results are shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen from the figure that both JSC and PCE are improved after doping. Under the above testing conditions, 20 devices with and without NBS were tested respectively. As shown in Fig. 5d, the PCE after doping greatly improved, and the results are summarized in Table 2.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were measured by ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), and the HOMO values of Spiro-OMeTAD un-doped or doped with NBS were calculated to be −5.16 and −5.03 eV, respectively, using the formula EHOMO = 21.22 − (Ecutoff – Eonoff) (Fig. 6a–d). After adding NBS, the difference between the HOMO energy level of the Spiro-OMeTAD and valence band (VB) of the perovskite increased, and photo-generated holes can be extracted better from the perovskite (PVK) layer, although the charge extraction ability is slightly weakened. The energy level diagram of the devices is shown in Fig. 6e. A steady-state photoluminescence test (PL) was performed to verify the influence of NBS on the photo-generated hole extraction ability of the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer. It can be seen from Fig. 6f that the existence of HTM inhibited the strength of PL, and the addition of NBS increased its PL quenching ability and improved the hole extraction ability.
To further evaluate the electrical characteristics of devices, transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were measured. As shown in Fig. S3a and b, the current attenuation of the device with NBS is faster than that of the device without NBS, but the voltage attenuation result is just the opposite. The former result shows that NBS-doping accelerates the extraction ability of electrons and holes, while the latter result shows that the defects between each interface of the device are reduced, and the recombination between electrons and defects is weakened. Similarly, the electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) test is consistent with it (Fig. S4). In addition, the dots presented the measured data, and the lines presented the equivalent circuit fittings. We conducted the EIS under the dark condition at a bias voltage of 1 V, under which conditions the charge recombination processes were simulated. From the equivalent circuit, the series resistance (Rs) of the devices with NBS (0.41 Ω) is slightly lower than the one without NBS (0.67 Ω), and the recombination resistance (Rrec) of the devices with NBS (598.7 Ω) is distinctly higher than the ones without NBS (285.4 Ω), implying the effective inhibition of charge recombination. This also proves why the doped devices have a higher VOC in the energy level diagram.
Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) was used to observe the effects of HTM on the surface roughness of PVK films. Fig. 7 shows the surface morphology of the 3D PVK films under different conditions. Without HTM, the roughness of the PVK film is 33 nm. When a layer of HTM is spin-coated on its surface, the roughness decreases obviously, and the value of the films with and without NBS is 8.3 and 13 nm, respectively. The reason for the lower roughness maybe that NBS increases the solubility of Li-TFSI and makes the film formation better. This also helps to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of the devices.
In the end, Fig. 8a shows the stability test results of the devices. Ten devices with NBS were stored in the external state for about 700 h (30% RH, 20 °C). By contrast, the same number of devices without NBS under the same conditions and their photovoltaic characteristics were tested every two days. After 700 h, the device doped with NBS can still maintain 82.97% of its original PCE, which is improved compared with the device without doping (71.21%). This conclusion can also be explained by the test of the water contact angle. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 8b that after adding NBS, the degree of the water contact angle of the film increased from 91.5° to 99.3°. This shows that doping NBS enlarges the hydrophobicity of the devices.

In conclusion, we have found a new dopant (NBS) for Spiro-OMeTAD to replace the traditional FK209 Co(III)TFSI as HTM in planar structure PSCs. The over-all PCE characteristics are obviously improved after introducing NBS with the optimal additive concentration (0.01 eq. in molar ratio). The devices with 1% NBS have a champion PCE (19.24%), which is higher than the devices without additives (16.12%) measured under one sun illumination (100 mW cm2, AM 1.5G). This is due to the fact that the former has better charge extraction and hole transport capabilities, fewer defects between interfaces, and better film morphology. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices can still keep the efficiency of 82.97% after being placed for 700 h under ambient conditions. The study supplies a new p-type dopant applied to Spiro-OMeTAD for the PSC applications.
