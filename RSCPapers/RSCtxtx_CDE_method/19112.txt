Two simple carbazole-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) substituted with fused aromatic rings (Cz-N and Cz-Pyr) were synthesized in high yield and tested in perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cz-Pyr appears as a very promising HTM owing to its easy synthesis, relatively high Tg and high efficiency, outperforming the reference HTM Spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs.

Hybrid organometal halide perovskites have been widely studied following the report of a 9.7% efficient solid state perovskite solar cell (PSC) in 2012. Their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has dramatically increased to over 24%. However, successful commercialization of PSCs still requires overcoming several drawbacks such as device instability and cost. The conventional PSC configuration is typically made of a perovskite layer clamped between an electron transporting material (ETM) and a hole transporting material (HTM). Although the HTM layer plays a key role in charge extraction and also impacts the stability of the PSC, the commonly used HTM 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is not a viable option due to prohibitive cost and stability issues. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to design new HTMs with the aim of achieving low-cost and efficient PSCs, but only a few of them outperform Spiro-OMeTAD so far.

In order to reduce the cost, simple molecules readily synthesized from cheap precursors are highly desirable. Carbazole derivatives containing 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine (DMPA) units have been introduced as promising HTMs for PSCs. Indeed, the inexpensive starting material 9H-carbazole can be easily functionalized with a wide variety of functional groups in positions 3, 6 and 9, allowing fine-tuning of its optical and electronic properties at low cost. While hole-accepting nitrogen atoms contribute to hole mobility enhancement, the electron-rich methoxy groups can improve charge extraction by passivating defect sites at the perovskite/HTM interface. To date, the best performing HTMs containing carbazole units substituted with DMPA in positions 3 and 6 (3,6CzDMPA) are either twin molecules or multi-armed star-shaped HTMs of complex design. On the other hand, the potential of simple HTMs based on a single 3,6CzDMPA unit was recently demonstrated, with power conversion efficiencies in PSCs close to that obtained with Spiro-OMeTAD. Interestingly, N-phenyl substituted carbazole-based HTMs exhibited significantly improved photovoltaic behavior compared with previously reported N-alkylated ones, highlighting the interest of aryl substituents. Similar CzDMPA-based HTMs were initially developed in ssDSSCs. However, the glass transition temperature of these HTMs was still relatively low, not exceeding 97 °C. Thus, substituting carbazole-based HTMs with an extended fused aromatic unit can be envisioned as a promising strategy in order to design simple and efficient HTMs with increased thermal and electronic properties. Moreover, HTMs based on a pyrene core deserve attention as alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD, owing to the low cost of pyrene and the fast charge-transport ability due to the strong electron delocalization character of the four fused benzene rings. Pyrene-based HTMs combined with DMPA or 3,6CzDMPA exhibited conversion efficiencies comparable to that obtained with Spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs.
Here, two new carbazole-based HTMs functionalized with respectively two and four fused benzene rings are synthesized in a one-step reaction. The influence of the number of arene rings on the thermal and opto-electronic properties is investigated, and the photovoltaic behavior of the new HTMs is studied in mixed-anion perovskite solar cells.

Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of the new molecules based on 3,6CzDMPA carbazole functionalized with a naphthalene (Cz-N) or pyrene (Cz-Pyr) unit, as well as that of the reference HTM Spiro-OMeTAD. The investigated molecules were prepared in one step from the commercially available 3,6CzDMPA precursor, using a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction. The experimental details for the synthesis and characterization of the new HTMs are given in the ESI.
The thermal properties of the new HTMs were investigated by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. TGA analysis shows that both HTMs exhibit high thermal stability (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI). The degradation temperature (425 °C and 432 °C for Cz-N and Cz-Pyr, respectively, at 5% weight loss) is suitable for application in PSCs. The DSC results (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI) show that both investigated molecules demonstrate a molecular glass behavior. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is 107 and 109 °C for Cz-N and Cz-Pyr, respectively, i.e. close to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (125 °C). The amorphous nature of the obtained materials indicates that there is no risk of detrimental crystallization in the film upon device operation, as previously reported for Spiro-OMeTAD. The thermal properties of both investigated molecules are almost similar and therefore only slightly affected by the size of the arene group. It is however noteworthy that the incorporation of fused benzene rings leads to significantly higher Tg values compared with those of the N-ethyl (68 °C) or even N-phenyl (97 °C) analogues, making the new HTMs more attractive for photovoltaic applications.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to determine the ionization potential (IP) of each HTM. Two reversible oxidation waves are observed (Fig. 1a), as previously described in the case of 3,6CzDMPA derivatives. The half-wave oxidation potential of the first redox system (E1/2) of Cz-N and Cz-Pyr is very close to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, the calculated IP is similar for all the investigated HTMs (−5.19, −5.18 and −5.20 eV vs. vacuum for Cz-N, Cz-Pyr and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively), indicating that the IP of the new molecules makes them suitable for use as a HTM in perovskite solar cells (Table S1, ESI).
The optical properties of the HTMs were studied using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1b). The carbazole-based HTMs mainly absorb light in the UV region (below 400 nm). The Cz-N and Cz-Pyr absorption spectra both exhibit the characteristic features of the Cz-DMPA unit. The peak at 305–310 nm is assigned to the π–π* transition of the carbazole and diphenylamine moieties, and the shoulder at 370–380 nm can be attributed to internal charge transfer from the diphenylamine to the carbazole. In addition, Cz-Pyr also displays typical absorption peaks of pyrene at 324 and 341 nm. The optical band gaps, determined from the absorption onset, are 3.05, 2.86 and 2.99 eV for Cz-N, Cz-Pyr and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively (Table S1, ESI). Thus, as could be expected, the more extended pyrene unit leads to a slightly lower band gap compared with the naphthalene unit.
The hole mobility of the HTMs has been extracted from thin-film field-effect transistor measurements in the saturation regime as described in the ESI. Since the HTMs are amorphous molecular glasses, the charge transport is expected to be isotropic, and hence the mobility values obtained from OFET measurements, although measured in-plane, can be considered as a relevant estimation of the hole mobility in the vertical direction in PSC devices. As listed in Table S1 (ESI), Cz-N and Cz-Pyr exhibit good hole mobilities (1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively), comparable with that of Spiro-OMeTAD measured under similar conditions (2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).
The photovoltaic performance of the investigated HTMs, in both the doped (using Li-TFSI and tBP additives) and pristine states, was tested in mesoporous PSCs with an FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/HTM/Au electrode configuration without encapsulation. All devices were fabricated using a one-step solution method for perovskite deposition, as described in the ESI. The typical PSC device structure and the cross-sectional image of a representative device are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI).
The J–V characteristics of PSCs fabricated with Cz-N, Cz-Pyr and Spiro-OMeTAD measured under standard illumination are shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. At first glance, the average parameters of the solar cells made with doped Cz-N, Cz-Pyr and Spiro-OMeTAD are higher than those of the devices made with pristine HTMs. In particular, Cz-Pyr leads to high short-circuit current density (JSC) values. The origin of the lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) recorded with Cz-N remains unclear and could be related to a less optimized doping mechanism and/or less favorable energy levels in the presence of Li-TFSI. Indeed, Li-TFSI is known to induce energy level shifts in HTM films. As Li+/π interactions can occur with aromatic systems, and given that Li+/naphthalene complexes are thought to be entropically more favored than Li+/pyrene ones, different interactions could take place with Cz-N and Cz-Pyr. It is noticeable that devices based on Cz-Pyr exhibit on average much better photovoltaic performance than those based on Spiro-OMeTAD, which is mainly related to a higher JSC. This is consistent with incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements showing that the replacement of Spiro-OMeTAD by Cz-Pyr enhances the photocurrent in the whole spectral region under study (300–800 nm), in both the doped and pristine states (Fig. S11, ESI). Such behavior is clearly not due to a better hole mobility in this case, but could be the consequence of a better interfacial configuration (either the local morphology or the electronic interaction with the perovskite layer), which could reduce charge recombination in accordance with the improved VOC. As a consequence, Cz-Pyr demonstrates on average almost a 16% PCE (max. 17.24% for the champion cell), to be compared with only 11.5% (max. 13.71%) for Spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, Cz-Pyr leads to a reduced hysteresis effect, with a hysteresis index (HI, as defined in ref. 34) of 0.06 instead of 0.19 using Spiro-OMeTAD. Also, in view of the statistical results, a larger dispersion of performance is evidenced for Spiro-OMeTAD compared to the Cz-Pyr HTM (Table 1 and Fig. S9, S10, ESI). These results, though based on non-optimized cells, show the impact of the fused benzene ring number on the photovoltaic performance of PSC devices using functionalized carbazole-based HTMs, and demonstrate the strong potential of the Cz-Pyr HTM.

Two simple carbazole-based organic HTMs have been synthesized in high yield in a one-step reaction. On the basis of the CV measurements and UV-vis spectra, the IP/EA of the molecules makes them suitable for use as HTMs in perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, Cz-Pyr and Cz-N exhibit a relatively high Tg of 109 and 107 °C, respectively. The devices built with Cz-Pyr achieved high PCE up to 17.2% without further optimization, compared with 13.7% using Spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, the present study highlights the interest of extended fused benzene rings as substituents on carbazole-based HTMs. Owing to the easy, high-yield synthesis and high efficiency in PSCs, Cz-Pyr appears as particularly promising to achieve efficient and low-cost HTMs. Further investigations and optimization studies are on-going.
