For solution processability of polymer solar cells (PSCs), polymer electron donors are almost always composed of conjugated main chains and flexible alkyl side chains. In this paper, we report a polymer electron donor based on isoindigo units bearing branched oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains, P-OEG. Compared with the control polymer bearing alkyl side chains (P-Alkyl), P-OEG exhibits not only a smaller π–π stacking distance and redshifted absorption spectra, but also larger surface energy for better compatibility with the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) electron acceptor. The PSC device of P-OEG exhibits an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.73 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.92 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.50, corresponding to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.10%. This performance is higher than that of P-Alkyl (PCE = 3.0%), which is attributed to the finer phase separation morphology of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of the P-Alkyl:PC71BM blend. These results suggest that the branched OEG side chain is an effective approach to improve the PSC device performance of some polymer electron donors.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received great attention due to their advantages of lightweight, flexibility, low cost and solution processing. Using conjugated polymers as electron donors and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction PSCs have exceeded 10%. For solution processability, polymer electron donors are almost always composed of conjugated main chains and flexible alkyl side chains. It is widely accepted that optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers are predominantly determined by the conjugated main chains. Although alkyl side chains are inert in opto-electronics, they can affect solubility, solid-state packing behaviours and blend morphology of polymer donors. Great efforts have been devoted to optimizing the type, length, and branching point of alkyl side chains for excellent PSC device performance. However, polymer electron donors bearing alternative kinds of side chains are rarely reported.

The oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chain is well-known for its hydrophilicity and is widely used in bio-related applications and self-assembly applications. Conjugated polymers bearing straight OEG side chains have already been reported and used in efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and PSCs. We have discovered that OEG chains are more flexible than alkyl chains and that OEG chains can promote π–π stacking of conjugated polymer main chains. We have also developed branched OEG side chains for conjugated polymers. Isoindigo is a widely used electron-deficient unit to design donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers for high-performance PSC and OFET applications. A large family of polymer electron donors based on isoindigo units bearing alkyl side chains have been reported and used in PSCs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on isoindigo-based conjugated polymers bearing OEG side chains. This motivates us to develop isoindigo-based polymer electron donors using branched OEG side chains.
Wang et al. have reported an isoindigo-based polymer electron donor, poly[N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)isoindigo-6,6′-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P-Alkyl, see Scheme 1). The PSC device with the blend of P-Alkyl and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active layer shows a PCE of 3.0%. The moderate PSC device performance is due to the poor phase separation morphology of the active layer and the insufficient driving force for charge separation. In this manuscript, we report a new polymer electron donor based on isoindigo units bearing branched OEG side chains, P-OEG. As shown in Scheme 1, P-OEG has the same main chain but different side chains compared to that of P-Alkyl. Compared with P-Alkyl, P-OEG exhibits not only a smaller π–π stacking distance, but also larger surface energy and consequently better compatibility with PC71BM. The PSC device of P-OEG also exhibits higher PCE than P-Alkyl. These results suggest that branched OEG side chains are an effective approach to improve the PSC device performance of some polymer electron donors.

The synthetic route of P-OEG is shown in Scheme 2. 3-(2-Methoxyethoxy)-2-((2-methoxyethoxy)methyl)propyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate (1) and 6,6′-dibromoisoindigo (2) were synthesized following literature methods. Alkylation of 2 with 1 gave the key monomer bearing branched OEG chains (3). Stille polymerization of 3 with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene afforded P-OEG. For comparison, we have also synthesized the control polymer P-Alkyl bearing conventional branched alkyl side chains. The chemical structure of P-OEG is confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) indicates that the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (PDI) of P-OEG are 42, 000 Da and 3.0, respectively (Table 1). P-OEG exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CHCl3) and chlorobenzene (CB). According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1), P-OEG shows good thermal stability with thermal degradation temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss of 379 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Fig. 1 shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) patterns of the drop-cast films of P-OEG and P-Alkyl. P-OEG exhibits a strong diffraction peak at 24.4°, corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of the polymer backbone (dπ–π) of 0.364 nm (Table 2). In comparison, the dπ–π of P-Alkyl is estimated to be 0.376 nm. The dπ–π of P-OEG is smaller than that of P-Alkyl. As discussed in our previous paper, this is due to the more flexibility of OEG chains compared to alkyl chains.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of P-OEG and P-Alkyl in chloroform solution and in thin films. The characteristics are listed in Table 2. P-OEG and P-Alkyl exhibit similar absorption spectra in solution because of their identical conjugated main chain. In thin films, the absorption spectrum of P-OEG redshifts by 14 nm compared to that of P-Alkyl. This is attributed to the decreased dπ–π of P-OEG, which leads to improved interaction of polymer main chains. As listed in Table 2, the optical band gap (Eg) of P-OEG is 1.54 eV, which is smaller than that of P-Alkyl (Eg = 1.62 eV).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of thin films was performed to estimate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (ELUMO/EHOMO) of the two polymers. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammograms and Table 2 lists the onset reduction/oxidation potentials (Eredonset/Eoxonset). The Eredonset/Eoxonset of P-OEG and P-Alkyl are −1.19 eV/0.46 eV and −1.26 eV/0.75 eV, respectively. According to the empirical formula: ELUMO/EHOMO = −(4.80 + Eredonset/Eoxonset) eV, ELUMO/EHOMO of P-OEG and P-Alkyl are estimated to be −3.61 eV/−5.26 eV and −3.54 eV/−5.55 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that cyclic voltammograms of polymer films are affected by the compatibility of the polymers with the polar solvent and compensating ions in the CV measurement. Compared with alkyl chains, OEG chains should have better compatibility with the solvent/compensating ions. This may affect the electrochemical oxidation/reduction process of the conjugated polymer backbone. So we need to be cautious about the ELUMO/EHOMO of the two polymers estimated by CV.

The hole mobility (μh) of the two polymers was measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only devices (device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Ag). The current density–voltage curves of the devices are shown in Fig. S2 and the hole mobility values are listed in Table 2. The hole mobility of P-OEG is 4.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of P-Alkyl (μh = 4.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hole mobilities of both P-OEG and P-Alkyl are adequate for PSC device application.


Surface energies (γ) affect the miscibility of the two components and play an important role in phase separation morphology of the active layer in PSCs. To estimate the surface energies of P-OEG and P-Alkyl, we measured the contact angles of water and glycerol probe liquids on the two polymer films. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The surface energies were calculated with the Owens and Wendt equation (ESI). As listed in Table 2, the surface energy of P-OEG is 30.8 mJ m−2, which is higher than that of P-Alkyl (γ = 26.5 mJ m−2). This is due to the larger polarity of the OEG chain than that of the alkyl chain. The surface energy of the typical electron acceptor, PC71BM, is 34.2 mJ m−2. Therefore, compared with P-Alkyl, P-OEG has the surface energy closer to that of PC71BM, suggesting that P-OEG should have better miscibility with PC71BM.


As reported previously, P-Alkyl exhibits moderate PSC device performance due to the poor phase separation morphology of the P-Alkyl:PC71BM blend. Replacement of branched alkyl side chains by branched OEG side chains makes P-OEG more compatible with PC71BM, which is expected to give improved blend morphology and results in enhanced PSC device performance. To test this hypothesis, PSC devices were fabricated with the conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The active layers were spin-coated from the solutions of the polymers and PC71BM in chlorobenzene with or without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive. The DIO contents were optimized to be 1 vol% and 3 vol% for P-OEG and P-Alkyl, respectively. The weight ratio of the polymers to PC71BM was fixed to be 1:1 (w/w).


Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination calibrated at 100 mW cm−2. The device characteristics are listed in Table 3. When processed with chlorobenzene without DIO, both the P-OEG-based device and the P-Alkyl-based device exhibit low PCE. Processing with the DIO solvent additive leads to great enhancement of the PSC device performance. The device of P-Alkyl processed with DIO shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 4.11 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.63, corresponding to the PCE of 2.30%. This performance is fairly comparable to that of the PSCs based on the same polymer electron donor reported in the literature. In comparison, the device of P-OEG processed with the DIO additive shows a VOC of 0.73 V, JSC of 13.92 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.50, leading to the PCE of 5.10%. The slightly decreased VOC of P-OEG based devices is attributed to the upshifted EHOMO of the polymer electron donor with branched OEG side chains. The greatly enhanced JSC with branched OEG side chains is in accordance with the EQE curves. The maximum EQE value of the P-OEG-based devices is nearly three times higher than that of P-Alkyl. The P-OEG-based devices show a lower FF than the P-Alkyl-based devices. The enhanced JSC and decreased FF may be attributed to the intimate mixing of P-OEG and PC71BM in the active layer (vide infra). These results indicate that the OEG side chains lead to PSC device performance enhancement for isoindigo-based polymer electron donors. In addition, we have also fabricated photovoltaic devices of the polymers of different active layer thicknesses. The device characteristics are dependent on the active layer thickness (see ESI).

The hole and electron mobilities of the blends are measured using the SCLC method with the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag) and the electron-only devices (ITO/PEIE/active layer/Ca/Al), respectively (ESI). The results are listed in Table S1. For the P-OEG:PC71BM film spin-coated from CB solution without the DIO solvent additive, the μh and electron mobility (μe) are 1.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.20 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. With the addition of 1 vol% DIO solvent additive, the μh and μe are increased to 3.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.87 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In comparison, the hole and electron mobilities of the P-Alkyl:PC71BM film spin-coated from CB solution with and without the DIO solvent additive are also measured (see ESI). Compared with the P-Alkyl:PC71BM film, the P-OEG:PC71BM film shows imbalanced hole and electron mobilities, which may lead to decreased FF values.


To further elucidate the different photovoltaic performances of the two polymers, we investigate the active layer morphology of the four devices using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode and bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of the active layers of the four devices. Without the DIO solvent additive, both the films of P-OEG:PC71BM and P-Alkyl:PC71BM exhibit large-size phase separation with isolated PC71BM domains (dark regions in TEM images) of about 300 nm. The domain size is much larger than that (10 nm–20 nm) required for bulk heterojunction PSCs and leads to ineffective exciton dissociation and low JSC. Application of the DIO solvent additive leads to a significantly decreased phase separation size, which is in accordance with the much increased JSC of the devices processed with DIO. In comparison, the P-OEG:PC71BM blend processed with the DIO solvent additive exhibits much finer phase separation than P-Alkyl:PC71BM. This is consistent with the better PSC device performance of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM. The intimate mixing of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend may be attributed to the increased surface energy of P-OEG, which leads to good miscibility with PC71BM. Fig. 7 shows the AFM height images of the four active layers. AFM results also support the well mixed phase separation morphology of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend compared to that of P-Alkyl:PC71BM when processed with the DIO solvent additive. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness obtained from the AFM height images is 9.03 nm and 12.50 nm for the P-OEG:PC71BM blend and P-Alkyl:PC71BM blend processed with pure chlorobenzene, respectively. When the DIO solvent additive is used, the RMS roughness of the P-OEG:PC71BM film and P-Alkyl:PC71BM film decreases to 1.07 nm and 4.52 nm, respectively.


In conclusion, we have developed a polymer electron donor based on isoindigo units bearing branched OEG side chains. Compared with the control polymer bearing alkyl side chains, P-OEG exhibits not only a smaller π–π stacking distance and redshifted absorption spectra, but also larger surface energy for better compatibility with the PC71BM acceptor. The PSC device of P-OEG exhibits a PCE of 5.10%, which is higher than that of the control polymer bearing alkyl side chains. The improved PSC device performance is attributed to the finer phase separation morphology of the P-OEG:PC71BM blend than that of the P-Alkyl:PC71BM blend. These results indicate that branched OEG side chains may be used to improve the PSC device performance of some polymer electron donors.

PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source and used as received. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were cleaned successively with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes each, followed by dried at 120 °C for 30 minutes and treated with UV-ozone for 25 minutes. Then PEDOT:PSS (Clevios VP Al 4083 from H. C. Starck Inc.) was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s to give a thickness of 40 nm, followed by baking at 120 °C for 30 min. Then the substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box. The active layers were spin-coated on the substrates. The weight ratio of the polymer:PC71BM is 1:1 (w/w). The processing solvents were optimized for P-OEG (CB/DIO, 99/1 v/v) and P-Alkyl (CB/DIO, 97/3 v/v), respectively. The thicknesses of the active layers were controlled by adjusting the concentration and the spin-coating speeds. Finally, Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were sequentially deposited on the active layer in a vacuum chamber at a pressure lower than 2 × 10−4 Pa. The area of each device was 8 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSC devices were obtained using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light illumination provided by a XES-40S2-CE Class Solar Simulator (Japan, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd). The EQE spectra were recorded using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a calibrated monosilicon diode.
