The development of single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) using only one photoactive component with a chemically bonded D/A structure has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. At represent, most relevant studies focus on comparing the performance difference between a donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated block copolymer (CBC) and the commensurate blending systems based on the same donor and acceptor segments, and still there are no reports on the impact of the segment ratio for a certain D–A CBC on the resultant photovoltaic performance. In this study, we synthesized a D–A all-conjugated polymers based on an n-type PNDI2T block and a p-type PBDB-T donor block but with three different segment ratios (P1–P3) and demonstrate the significance of the D/A segment ratio on photovoltaic performance. Our results reveal that the n-type PNDI2T block plays a more critical role in the inter/intra-chain charge transfer. P1 with a higher content of PNDI2T delivers superior exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior than P2 and P3, benefitting from its more balanced hole/electron mobility. In addition, a higher packing regularity associated with a more dominant face-on orientation is also observed for P1. As a result, SCOSC based on P1 exhibits the highest PCE among the synthesized CBCs. It also possesses a minimal energy loss due to the better suppressed non-radiative recombination loss. This work provides the first discussion of the impact of the segment ratio for a D–A all-conjugated block copolymer and signifies the critical role of the n-type segment in designing high-performance single-component CBCs.

In the past few decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted worldwide research attention due to the advantages of sustainable energy, good mechanical stability, and low-cost solution-processable manufacturing process. At present, the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) for OSCs have exceeded 18%, driven by the successful development of small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (SM-NFAs). Moreover, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting a polymer donor and a polymerized SM-NFA have also demonstrated high PCEs of 14%. These achievements reveal the promising future of OSCs. Also, it gives rise to the possibility of developing efficient single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) through rational molecular designs.

As is known, most of the high-efficiency OSCs reported to date adopt the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) design, for which the polymer donor (D) and acceptor (A), including fullerenes, SM-NFAs, or polymer acceptors, form an interpenetrating network to create nanoscale D/A phase separation. Hence, the BHJ morphology plays a decisive role in governing the resultant performance and stability of the derived devices and is generally dominated by the miscibility between the constituent photoactive components. To exempt the trouble arising from the miscibility issue, the development of SCOSCs using only one photoactive component with a chemically bonded D/A structure has become a viable alternative, and it has attracted increasing research attention in recent years.
Thus far, the design strategies for the single-component photoactive components can be mainly divided into three categories: molecular dyads, double-cable conjugated polymers, and conjugated block copolymers (CBCs). Lately, many research groups are focussing on the latter two types of molecular designs because myriads of donor and acceptor moieties have been developed that can be used for synthesizing diverse conjugated polymers and CBCs. At the earlier stage, the CBCs designed for SCOSCs were based on polythiophene derivatives as the donor segment. For example, Verduzco et al. synthesized P3HT-b-PTBTF consisting of poly-3-hexylthiophene and poly-fluorene-bis-thiophene, and its derived SCOSC delivered a PCE of ∼2%. Such a low PCE is due to the low short-circuit current density (Jsc), attributed to the poor light absorption property of the P3HT segment.
Until recently, Choi's group utilized more advanced donor and acceptor segments to synthesize several promising CBCs through a facile one-pot polymerization. For instance, a wide-bandgap donor block of PBDT2T and a narrow-bandgap acceptor block of N2200 were copolymerized to obtain PBDT2T-b-N2200, and its derived SCOSC exhibited a much-improved PCE of 6.43%. More recently, Li et al. selected two SM-NFAs, IDIC and Y6, to, respectively, copolymerize with the PBDB-T polymer donor to prepare PBDB-T-b-PIDIC2T and PBDB-T-b-PTY6, and the SCOSC based on the latter CBC could deliver a maximum PCE of 8.64%. Meanwhile, Wu et al. reported an 11% SCOSC based on PBDB-T-b-PYT (a similar structure to PBDB-T-b-PTY6), representing the highest PCE for SCOSCs reported to date. Despite the demonstrated high PCEs for SCOSCs, we notice that most of these works merely focus on comparing the photovoltaic performance between the synthesized CBCs and the commensurate BHJ systems using the same donor segments and acceptor segments. To the best of our knowledge, still, there is no work investigating the influence of segment ratio for a certain CBC with identical donor/acceptor segments on resultant photovoltaic performance, and its impact on morphology and charge recombination behavior.
Based on this reason, in this work, we selected the NDI-based PNDI2T as the acceptor segment to copolymerize with a widely used PBDB-T as the donor segment through a simple one-pot polymerization to prepare a series of CBCs with different segment ratios. The PNDI2T block was first synthesized because of its strong π–π intermolecular interaction and excellent electron-transport property. Three PNDI2T-b-PBDB-T with different A–D ratios of 65:35 (referred to as P1), 52:48 (P2), and 32:68 (P3) were synthesized. Among these CBCs, P1 with a higher proportion of PNDI2T provides superior inter-and intra-molecular charge transfer compared to the other two. A longer exciton lifetime was observed for P1, suggesting its longer exciton diffusion distance that is beneficial for decreasing the non-geminated loss and facilitating the exciton dissociation. In addition, the higher proportion of PNDI2T in P1 enables a higher packing regularity with a more dominant face-on orientation. Therefore, the SCOSC based on P1 exhibited the best PCE of 4.53% among the synthesized CBCs. Our results clearly highlight the importance of the high content n-type segment for the design of single-component CBCs.

A series of D–A, all-conjugated polymers based on PBDB-T and PNDI2T segments but with different segment ratios were synthesized through a one-pot successive Stille coupling polycondensation by modifying the methods reported in the literature. Notably, owing to the lower solubility of PBDB-T than that of PNDI2T, the PNDI2T segment was used as the 1st block and the PBDB-T segment was the 2nd block to ensure a homogeneous crossover reaction from the 1st to 2nd monomers. Fig. 1 presents the overall synthetic routes of PNDI2T-b-PBDB-T and the synthetic details are described in the Experimental section. To change the segment ratio, the polymerization time of the 1st block and the monomer-feeding ratio were fine-tuned and optimized (see Experimental section). As a result, the target PNDI2T-b-PBDB-T samples with similar number-average molecular weight (Mn) values of 18.0–24.0 kDa were obtained, as determined by the SEC (Fig. S1). The weight compositions of PNDI2T:PBDB-T in PNDI2T-b-PBDB-T were determined to be 65:35 (P1), 52:48 (P2), and 32:68 (P3) by 1H NMR (Fig. S2–S4 and Table S1), whereas the calculated values were 48:52 (P1), 46:54 (P2), and 30:70 (P3) based on the monomer feed ratio. Somewhat higher than expected observed compositions for PNDI2T (1st block) can be explained from the limited solubility of PNDI2T-b-PBDB-T in toluene at 110 °C compared to that of PNDI2T (1st block).

The thermal properties of P1–P3 were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fig. S5 presents their TGA curves and all of them exhibited high 5 wt% weight loss temperatures (Td,5%) of >415 °C, indicating excellent thermal stability. Their DSC curves are displayed in Fig. S6. As shown, P1 exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) at 286 °C and a crystalline temperature (Tc) at 243 °C in the 2nd heating and cooling scan while the other two polymers show negligible transition temperatures below 300 °C (Table S2). Such a difference is due to the higher PNDI2T content of P1 than P2 and P3. The much longer side chain (2-decyltetradecyl) of PNDI2T than PBDB-T (2-ethylhexyl side chain) affords higher plasticity.

Fig. 2a shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the films of P1–P3, PNDI2T, and PBDB-T and the relevant optical properties are summarized in Table 1. As seen, the parent PBDB-T possessed an absorption band across 500 to 700 nm, whereas the absorption bands of PNDI2T were located at 350–450 nm and 500–900 nm, being consistent with the characteristics reported in the literature. For P1–P3, all of them exhibited obvious absorption bands at 350–450 nm and 500–700 nm along with a shoulder appearing at 700 nm. This result indicates that the original characteristics of the parent constituent segments can exist individually after the complete conjugation. It should be noted that the shoulder's intensity (at 700 nm) gradually increases from P3 to P1 due to the increasing weight ratio of the PNDI2T segment in the composition. For comparison, UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films with the same D:A ratios to P1–P3 are shown in Fig. S7a. As can be seen, the absorption profiles of the blend films changed in the same way as P1–P3. Moreover, it is important to note that the absorption coefficient gradually increases from P3 to P1, showing that P1 possesses the best light-harvesting capability (Fig. S7b). The energy levels of these polymers were characterized next. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated using the equation of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, where the bandgap (Eg) values were determined from their corresponding Tauc plots (Fig. S8). As summarized in Fig. 2b, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels for P1, P2, and P3 are −5.32/−3.48, −5.01/−3.16, and −4.83/−2.96 eV, respectively, falling between the values of the constituent segments (PBDB-T and PNDI2T). Although P1–P3 possessed a similar Eg value, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels from P3 to P1 were gradually down-shifted as a result of the increasing weight ratio of the n-type PNDI2T segment in the composition.

To understand the influence of different segment ratios on the charge transfer (CT) properties, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films of P1–P3 and PNDI2T were measured. As shown in Fig. 2c, under the excitation of 560 nm, the P1 film exhibited the highest PL quenching efficiency of 74.1%, surpassing the values of P2 (56.7%) and P3 (56.3%). This result suggests the superior exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior for P1 than the other two polymers. It also shows that the increasing content of the p-type PDBD-T segment does not necessarily facilitate the charge transfer between itself and the n-type PNDI2T segment. The PNDI2T segment seems to play a more critical role in the inter/intra-chain charge transfer. The exciton lifetimes of these polymers were next measured by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) as shown in Fig. 2d, where triexponential reconvolution fitting curves with the instrumental response function (IRF) were used to obtain the relevant parameters (Table S3). As can be seen, P1 exhibited the longest average TRPL decay lifetime (677 ps) as compared to P2 (649 ps) and P3 (619 ps). This result suggests that the exciton of P1 might possess a longer exciton diffusion length that is beneficial to decrease the non-geminated recombination, affirming its more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer behaviors compared to P2 and P3.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance difference between P1–P3, SCOSC was fabricated based on an inverted device configuration of ITO glass/ZnO/P1–P3/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 3a. Details for the device fabrication are described in the Experimental section. Note that two conditions for the photoactive layer were herein investigated, including as-cast and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Fig. S9a and Fig. 3b, respectively, show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the fabricated SCOSCs based on the as-cast and annealed P1–P3 films, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S4 and Table 2. As shown, annealing imposes a clear enhancement on device performance. The PCEs were enhanced from 3.81 to 4.53% for P1, from 1.38 to 1.39% for P2, and from 0.87 to 0.99% for P3, mainly due to the increased fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc). This obviously suggests that proper thermal annealing promotes the self-assembly of the PBDB-T and PNDIT2 segments to a more optimized interpenetrating network, which has been similarly observed in the literature and will be discussed later.

The devices based on the blend films with the same D:A ratios to P1–P3 were also fabricated and measured for comparison. The relevant J–V curves and EQE spectra are shown in Fig. S10 and the resultant photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table S5. As shown, the device with a higher donor content delivered a higher PCE, which is discordant to the result for the SCOSC devices. Such a discrepancy highlights the distinctly different molecular packing patterns and changes in transport/dissociation properties between the blend system and the single-component system. However, it should be noted that the P1-based SCOSC still exhibits superior photovoltaic performance than the devices based on the blend films.
The inferior photovoltaic performance of P2 and P3 devices compared to the P1 device is mainly attributed to their low Jsc and FF values. The different light responses of these devices were clearly illustrated in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. S9b and Fig. 3c). The integrated Jsc obtained from the EQE spectra also confirmed the highest Jsc value for the P1 device. Fig. S11 compares the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the fabricated SCOSCs. As shown, the P1 device possessed the lowest Rs value and the highest Rsh value as compared to P2 and P3 devices. Such a different internal resistance among these three devices clarifies their different FF values. Considering their similar light absorption profiles, their optical properties might only play a minor role in such a discrepancy, and their composition and morphology difference should be the main reason responsible for this. This echoes the PL results as discussed earlier, in which, different exciton dissociation and charge transfer behaviors among them were indicated.
The charge generation, dissociation and extraction properties of the optimized P1–P3 devices were next analyzed by the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 3d), where Jph is the current density difference measured under AM1.5G illumination (JL) and measured under a dark condition (JD), denoted as Jph = JL − JD; Veff is the difference between the voltage measured at Jph = 0 and measured at an applied voltage bias, defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias. As can be seen, under high values of Veff, the Jph value of the P1 device reached a saturation regime (Jsat), indicating that the photogenerated charge carriers were efficiently extracted by electrodes. Whereas, the Jph values for both P2 and P3 devices showed no evident saturated tendency, suggesting that the internal electric field of the device is deficient for collecting free carriers by electrodes as a result of the inferior exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior. The maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) of these devices were calculated according to the equation Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness (∼100 nm) of the photoactive layer. The Gmax values for P1, P2, and P3 devices were 5.96 × 1027, 3.46 × 1027, and 3.33 × 1027 m−3 s−1, respectively. Clearly, P1 gave the highest charge generation rate among these three polymers, affirming the highest Jsc value of its derived device. The exciton dissociation (Pd) and charge collection (Pc) probabilities for these devices were evaluated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit condition and the maximum power condition, respectively. The Pd and Pc values (90.7 and 67.8%) for the P1 device were both higher than those values for P2 (71.8 and 42.9%) and P3 (64.1 and 35.8%) devices. This again indicates the superior exciton dissociation and charge collection capability of P1 compared to P2 and P3, highlighting the significance of the D/A segment ratio for designing high-performance single-component D–A all-conjugated polymers.
To more directly probe the influence of the D/A segment ratio, we evaluated the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of P1–P3 using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method by measuring the hole-only and electron-only devices under dark conditions. Details for the SCLC measurement are described in the Experimental section and the SCLC curves are displayed in Fig. S12.Fig. 3e summarizes the μh and μe values for P1–P3. We notice that these polymers gave relatively low μe values compared to the values reported in the literature. This might be due to the inferior electron transport property of the PNDI2T block than that of PIDIC2T and PTY6 blocks. This is also the main reason for our lower photovoltaic performance than these state-of-the-art CBCs for SCOSCs. Despite such a shortage, it can be clearly observed that P1 possessed the most balanced μh/μe mobility, validating its superior exciton dissociation and charge transfer behaviors than P2 and P3. This result verifies the more predominant role of the n-type segment in designing single-component CBCs, whose ratio should be as high as possible until reaching a reasonably balanced μh/μe mobility.

To obtain a deeper understanding of the charge recombination behaviors of P1–P3 devices, the relationship of device's Voc on light intensities was investigated by fitting the linear equation, Voc ∝ n(kT/q) × ln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. It has been known that if the slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) is close to 1.0 kT/q, the bimolecular recombination is the primary process in the device; whereas the trap-assisted recombination (or monomolecular recombination) is the dominant process if the slope is close to 2.0 kT/q. As shown in Fig. 4a, the slope (1.57 kT/q) for the P1 device is much lower than the value (1.97 kT/q) for the P2 device. This unveils that the P1 device possesses suppressed trap-assisted recombination losses compared to P2 and P3 devices, supporting higher Jsc and FF values, as observed. This could benefit from its more balanced μh/μe mobility than that in P2 and P3. Notably, the slope (2.17 kT/q) for the P3 device is much higher than that of the other two devices (Fig. S13), revealing a severe trap-assisted recombination loss. Hence, next, we only select P1 and P2 devices for the energy loss analyses.


Fig. 4b and c, respectively, present the Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy EQE (FTPS EQE) and electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) spectra of P1 and P2 devices, and the detailed parameters for energy loss estimation are summarized in Table S6. Based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, the total energy loss (Eloss) can be generally divided into three parts, expressed by the following equation:
where
q is the elementary charge, VSQoc is the maximum voltage based on the SQ limit, and Vradoc is the open-circuit voltage when there is only radiative recombination. As summarized in Fig. 4d, P1 and P2 devices gave a similar ΔE1 value, which represents the radiative recombination loss above the bandgap. The second term, ΔE2 (also noted as qΔVrad, below gapoc), is due to additional radiative recombination loss from the absorption below bandgap. As shown, the ΔE2 value (0.171 eV) for the P1 device is lower than that (0.188 eV) for the P2 device. This suggests that P1 with higher content of the PNDI2T block is much easier to overcome the binding energy of the CT state. The third term, ΔE3 (also noted as qΔVnon-radoc), represents the non-radiative recombination loss in the device, which is determined by EQEEL using the equation qΔVnon-radoc = −kTln(EQEEL), where k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The P2 device delivered an EQEEL value of 1.87 × 10−5, leading to a ΔE3 value of 0.280 eV. Whereas, the P1 device gave a slightly higher EQEEL value of 3.08 × 10−5, resulting in a smaller ΔE3 value of 0.269 eV. This result clearly reveals the reduced non-radiative recombination loss for P1 device, which conforms to the TRPL result. Consequently, the P1 device possesses a lower total energy loss (Eloss) than the P2 device, thereby resulting in a higher Voc value as observed. This might be attributed to the more balanced μh/μe mobility of P1 than P2. However, it needs to be noted that the morphology difference between them should also play a certain role and this will be discussed next.


Because the composition difference will lead to distinct self-assembly behavior for the PBDB-T and PNDIT2 segments, we next scrutinize the molecular packing behavior for P1–P3 by the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. 5a presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the annealed P1–P3 films, and their corresponding 1D GIWAXS profiles in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions are compared in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. Detailed information on the 1D GIWAXS parameters is summarized in Tables S7 and S8. For a fair comparison, GIWAXS of pure PBDB-T and PNDI2T were also measured. As shown in Fig. 5b, both PBDB-T (qz = 1.65 Å−1) and PNDI2T (qz = 1.60 Å−1) exhibited a similar (010) peak signal with a d-spacing of 3.8–3.9 Å, representing their π–π stacking feature in the OOP direction. P1–P3 also showed a (010) peak signal at qz = ∼1.6 Å−1 with a d-spacing of ∼3.85 Å in the OOP direction. This suggests that all of them possessed an obvious π–π stacking characteristic with a face-on orientation. Note that, owing to the higher content of the PBDB-T block, a (100) peak at qz = ∼0.27 Å−1 in the OOP direction originating from the PBDB-T block was observed for P2 and P3. This result indicates that in addition to the π–π stacking characteristic with a face-on orientation, lamella stacking was also formed along this direction for P2 and P3 due to the higher content of the PBDB-T block. This, to a certain degree, reduces the packing regularity and uniformity.

For the lamella stacking properties in the IP direction, P1–P3 displayed evident (100) diffraction signals at qxy = 0.26–0.27 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 23.26–24.15 Å. It is worth noting that two different (200) peaks were observed. The first (200) peak at qxy = 0.47 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 13.36–14.27 Å originated from the PNDI2T block, while the peak at qxy = 0.65 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 9.66 Å was contributed by the PBDB-T block. Such a feature was similarly reported in the literature, and the respective peak intensity changes as the corresponding block ratio in the composition. As seen, the intensity of the first (200) peak (qxy = ∼0.46 Å−1) was higher for P1 than for P2 and P3 due to the higher content of the PNDI2T block; however, the intensity of the second (200) peak (qxy = 0.65 Å−1) was lower for P1 than for P2 and P3 due to the lower content of the PBDB-T block. We further calculated the crystal coherence length (CCL) of P1–P3 using the Scherrer equation, CCL = 2π/Δq, where Δq is the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks with a Gauss fitting. As shown in Table S8, the CCL values of (100), the first (200), and the second (200) diffraction peaks for P1 were 89.76, 104.72, and 104.72 Å, respectively, all these CCL values are higher than the corresponding values for P2 and P3, suggesting that the lamella stacking of P1 is more ordered than in P2 and P3 along the IP direction. On the other hand, for P2 and P3, a more apparent (010) diffraction peak at qxy = 1.36 Å−1 with a small d-spacing of 4.6 Å was observed, representing the presence of π–π stacking in the IP direction. Combing with the previous results in the OOP direction, it suggests that P2 and P3 possess a higher fraction of edge-on orientation than P1. The higher packing regularity and more dominant face-on orientation observed for P1 (Fig. 5d) are thus responsible for its superior exciton dissociation and charge transport properties from the morphological point of view. We also obtained the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the annealed P1 and P2 films, as shown in Fig. S14. As shown, the P1 film seems to possess a larger crystalline domain size, leading to a higher roughness value than P2. In addition, a larger aggregation (bright region) was observed for the P2 film, which might adversely impact the performance of the derived device. On the contrary, the aggregation region for P1 was dispersed more uniformly, which is favorable to facilitating the charge transfer property of the film.

In summary, we demonstrated the significance of the D/A segment ratio for designing high-performance single-component D–A all-conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications. We synthesized three PNDI2T-b-PBDB-T polymers with different A–D ratios of 65:35 (P1), 52:48 (P2), and 32:68 (P3) and compared their optoelectronic properties. Our results reveal that increasing the content of the p-type PDBD-T segment does not necessarily facilitate the charge transfer between itself and the n-type PNDI2T segment and the PNDI2T segment plays a more critical role in the inter/intra-chain charge transfer. As a result, P1 with higher content of PNDI2T delivers superior exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior than P2 and P3. It benefits from the facilitated inter-and intramolecular charge transfer exerted by the PNDI2T segment, as evidenced by its more balanced μh/μe mobility relative to P2 and P3. In addition, we found that the different A–D ratios impose a great effect on their molecular stacking behavior. A higher packing regularity associated with a more dominant face-on orientation was observed for P1. Combining all these results, the SCOSC based on P1 exhibited the highest PCE of 4.53% among the synthesized CBCs and possessed a minimal energy loss due to the better suppressed non-radiative recombination loss. This work provides the first discussion of the impact of the segment ratio for a D–A all-conjugated block copolymer and we reveal the more predominant role of the n-type segment in designing high-performance single-component CBCs from the aspects of mobility and packing pattern.


4,9-Dibromo-2,7-bis(2-decyl-1-tetradecyl)benzo[lmn][3,8] phenanthroline-1,3,6,8 (2H,7H)-tetraone (A1-Br2) was synthesized according to the method reported in the literature. 5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (D1-Sn2), 4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]-2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl) benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (D2-Sn2), 1,3-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′] dithiophene-4,8-dione (A2-Br2), and all the other regents were purchased from Aldrich, Japan, Tokyo Chemical Industry, FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals or 1-material (Canada), and used without further purification. The polymer donor (PBDB-T) and polymer acceptor (PNDI2T) were purchased from 1-material (Canada) and used without further purification.



A1-Br2 (0.139 mmol, 1.1 eq.) and D1-Sn2 (0.126 mmol, 1.0 eq.) were placed in a 50 mL two-necked flask purged with N2 gas. After dissolving them in deoxidized toluene (35 mL), N2 bubbling was conducted for 30 min. Pd2(dba)3 (13.7 mg, 0.0150 mmol) and P(o-tolyl)3 (38.0 mg, 0.125 mmol) were added to this solution and allowed to stand at 110 °C for 1 h to obtain the PNDI2T (1st block) solution. A2-Br2 (0.126 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and D2-Sn2 (0.126 mmol, 1.0 eq.) were placed in another two-necked flask purged with N2 gas. After dissolving them in deoxidized toluene (10 mL), N2 bubbling was conducted for 30 min. The latter solution was added to the former PNDI2T (1st block) solution and the mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h. Finally, 2-bromothiophene (0.006 ml) and 2-trinbutylstannylthiophene (0.012 ml) were sequentially added to the solution for the end-capping treatment (2 h for each step). The reaction was finally quenched with a 5 M HCl solution (2 mL). The solution was extracted with chloroform and washed with KF (aq.). It was then passed through a short column (silica gel:K2CO3 = 9:1, w:w and the obtained solution was poured into methanol (300 mL) to precipitate the polymers. The polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, and hexane to remove the possible residual monomers and oligomeric PNDI2T and PBDB-T, followed by extraction with chloroform. After the removal of chloroform using a rotary evaporator, followed by freeze-drying from the benzene solution, P1 (PNDI2T:PBDB-T = 65:35, w:w) was obtained as a dark purple powder (0.263 g, 91%).

An inverted device structure of ITO glass/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag was fabricated in this work. The ITO glass substrates were sequentially washed with DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each step, followed by the plasma treatment for 10 min. The electron-transport ZnO layer was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 30s and then annealed at 180 °C for 30 min in air. The precursor solutions for the single-component materials with different concentrations were prepared in chlorobenzene (18 mg ml−1 for P1 and 12 mg ml−1 for P2 and P3) and vigorously stirred at 50 °C for a few hours in an N2-filled glove box. The active layers based on P1–P3 were spin-coated onto the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 1 min (with a thickness of ∼100 nm), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min or without any post-treatment (referred to as the as-cast film). The precursor solutions for the blend films with the same D:A ratios to P1–P3 were prepared in chlorobenzene with the same concentrations, and then were spin-coated on the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 1 min, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, 10 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Ag were sequentially thermally deposited onto the active layer to complete the device fabrication. The active area of the device was 8.5 mm2.


Number average and weight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) and molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) were measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Jasco CO-1565, Jasco PU-4580 and a UV detector Jasco UV-4575 at 40 °C with chloroform as an eluent and calibrated with polystyrene standards. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL NM-ECZ600R/M1 instrument in deuterated 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (C2D2Cl4) at 100 °C. Thermal analysis was performed on a Seiko EXSTAR6000TG/DTA6300 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 for thermogravimetry (TGA) and on a Seiko Instruments Inc. SII EXSTAR 6000/DSC6200 connected to a cooling system at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer was used for recording UV-vis spectra. The thin film for the UV-vis spectrum measurement was prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution (18 mg mL−1 for P1 and 12 mg ml−1 for P2/P3 in chlorobenzene) onto a glass substrate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min under nitrogen atmosphere. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using an SS-F5-3A simulator from Enlitech Co., Ltd, which was connected to a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU). The illumination intensity was calibrated using an a-Si photodiode detector with a KG-5 filter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a monochromatic light from a xenon lamp during the illumination (QE-R, Enlitech Co., Ltd) and a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell was used to calibrate the light intensity under the wavelength from 300 to 1000 nm. The FTPS-EQE was performed on FTPS PECT-600 from Enlitech Co., Ltd and the EQEEL was measured using REPS from Enlitech Co., Ltd for calculating the energy loss. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured under the excitation of a 405 nm pulse with a frequency of 8 MHz, and the power on the sample was 98.6 μW. The spectrometer used an MR-SPEC-Red 300 line, and the detection was using the monochromator with Red PMT and a 3.00 mm slit (>20 nm FWHM bandwidth). The detection fiber was 200 μm (Thorlab & Ocean). All the testing samples were coated on glass substrates. The GIWAXS measurements were conducted at beamline BL46XU of SPring-8, Japan. The sample was irradiated at a fixed incident angle αi on the order of 0.12° through a Huber diffractometer with an X-ray energy of 12.4 keV (λ = 0.10 nm), and the GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D image detector (Pilatus 300 K) with sample-to-detector distances of 175.7 mm.


The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated to measure the hole and electron mobility using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The structure for the hole-only device is ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and the structure for the electron-only device is ITO glass/ZnO/active layer/TPBI/LiF/Ag. The measurement was conducted under dark conditions, and the mobility was determined according to a modified Mott-Gurney equation:
where
J is current density, V is voltage, μ is mobility, and L is the thickness of the active layer, ε0 is vacuum permittivity and εr is relative permittivity (usually 3 for organic semiconductors).
