The surface treatment of the active layer with binary solvents composed of methanol (MeOH) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), was demonstrated to effectively improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 2.4% to 6.5% for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM based small molecular solar cells. The optical properties and morphology of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM films were carefully investigated. The results indicate that treatment with MeOH:CN binary solvents could significantly enhance the absorption of the active layer, due to the formation of more p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 nanofibrils associated with higher crystallinity as revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results further demonstrate that the molecular packing of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules could be strongly enhanced after treatment with the binary solvents. In contrast, pristine methanol shows no significant influence on the crystalline structure, phase separation or the photovoltaic properties of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system, showing that the CN solvent plays the main role in inducing the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) show great potential as a competitive green energy technology, due to the advantages of low cost, light weights and high mechanical flexibility. Due to the significant improvements in the active layer, device structure, and fabrication techniques, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% have been achieved for polymer solar cells. Recently, a prominent efficiency of 10.08% has also been achieved for small molecular solar cells. Small molecular solar cells demonstrate many prominent advantages compared with polymer solar cells, in terms of their ease of purification, discrete molecular weight, small batch-to-batch variation, and high open-circuit voltage (Voc).

The most studied small molecular donors include the oligothiophene derivatives with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure reported by Chen's group and the dithienosilole (DTS) based molecules reported by Bazan's group. Although the corresponding solar cells exhibited relatively high PCEs, the major challenge for them is to simultaneously enhance the molecular order for better charge carrier mobility, and to restrict the domain size due to limited exciton diffusion length (10–20 nm). Strategies to simultaneously enhance the molecular order and restrict the domain size have been reported, including thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing solvent additives and polymer additives,etc.
All the above mentioned methods aim to reconstruct the nanomorphology for enhanced photovoltaic properties. Recently, a top-down approach applied to reconstruct the nanophase of the active layer, via a simple rinsing treatment using a solvent mixture comprising a trace of solvent additive such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and most non-polar buffer solvents was reported. Additionally, the treatment of the active layer with polar solvents such as alcohols could considerably enhance the PCE of polymer solar cells before the deposition of the metal electrodes, due to the optimization of the morphology of the active layers and/or change in the interface between the active layer and the buffer layer. Park et al. found that the optimal phase separation in poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) films could be obtained after treating with ethanol, arising from the formation of PCBM aggregates rather than from changes in the crystalline ordering of P3HT. Similarly, Yang et al. found that the lateral and vertical nanoscale phase separation of P3HT:PCBM films could be optimized via soaking in solvents composed of methanol (MeOH) and carbon disulfide (CS2), leading to an enhanced PCE. CS2 may activate the chain motion of P3HT and the diffusion of PCBM molecules laterally and vertically. It is concluded that the surface treatment of the active layer by alcohols such as MeOH or binary solvents is demonstrated to be effective in optimizing the morphology of the active layer and in improving the performance of polymer solar cells. Therefore, the method of surface treatment by MeOH and its binary solvent containing CN additive might also be useful for a small molecular system, via optimizing the nanomorphology for enhanced device performance.
Concerning the 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM) system, the methanol is supposed to be able to induce the aggregation of PC71BM molecules into larger clusters. Moreover, the crystallization of donor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules into interconnected nanofibrils should be vital to enhance the charge carrier transportation and device efficiency. The solvent treatment by methanol may be unable to induce the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules, and the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) solvent might be facilitating the molecular packing of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules. Therefore, the binary solvent composed of MeOH and CN is supposed to be able to reconstruct the nanophase of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system via optimizing the ratio of CN to MeOH.
In this study, a binary solvent of CN and MeOH was used to soak the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM films via wetting and quick spinning, leading to a significant improvement of PCE from 2.4% to 6.5%. The influence of the composition of the binary solvent on the phase separation of the active layer and the crystalline structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was carefully investigated. The MeOH solvent is found to have no significant influence on the crystalline structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the morphology of the films. The binary solvent is demonstrated to induce the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 into nanofibrils, optimizing the nanomorphology of the active layer for enhanced photovoltaic properties.


p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech Inc. PC71BM was purchased from Nano-C Inc. 1-Chloronaphthalene (CN) and methanol (MeOH) were supplied by Sigma Aldrich.


Solution-processed small molecular solar cells with conventional device architecture of ITO/ZnO/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated according to the following procedure. The ITO-coated glass substrates were firstly cleaned via ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 30 minutes each. After treating with UV/ozone for 20 min, a ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm and the ZnO layer was generated at 220 °C under an ambient atmosphere. The active layers were spun at 1750 rpm from a solution of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM at a weight ratio of 3:2 and an overall concentration of 35 mg mL−1. The solution was heated for 15 min at 90 °C prior to casting. The obtained films were allowed to dry for 30 min and were then heated to 70 °C for 10 min under an inert atmosphere to drive off residual solvent. Then, a specific binary solvent containing mostly MeOH with a trace of CN was dropped onto the active layer surface for a 15 second wetting treatment and spinning at 3600 rpm. 7 nm of MoO3 was deposited using sequential thermal evaporation, followed by 90 nm of Ag.


Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were characterized using a Keithley 2400. The current was measured in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000). All the measurements were performed under a ambient atmosphere and at room temperature. The scan range was from 0 V to 1 V, and 6.7 mV for each step. The hole-only diodes were fabricated with a device geometry similar to solar cell devices, except that ZnO was replaced by PEDOT:PSS. The J–V characteristics of the diodes show an excellent fit to the Mott–Gurney relation for space charge limited current (SCLC). The ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectra of the specimens were recorded by a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a Digital Instrumental Nanoscope 31 was operated in the tapping mode. Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation were prepared by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS on ITO glass at 2000 rpm and drying under an ambient atmosphere. Then, the active layers were spun at 1750 rpm, followed by drying for 30 min and thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 min. After surface treatment with MeOH or MeOH:CN solvents, the specimen was dried for 30 min. The films were then floated off the substrate in deionized water and collected on a copper mesh grid. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was performed at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley, USA. Samples were prepared on Si substrates with a thin ZnO layer by using identical blend solutions as those used in devices. The incident angle was 0.14°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected by using a Dectris Pilatus 2M photon counting detector.


The chemical structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is shown in Fig. 1a. Bazan's group have extensively studied the crystalline structure, as well as the morphology evolution of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM films upon thermal annealing, incorporation of a DIO additive and polystyrene and so on. Inducing the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 into ordered nanofibrils may enhance the domain purity, leading to the improvement of photovoltaic properties. In order to explore the effect of surface treatment using solvents, the corresponding absorption behaviors, morphology and photovoltaic properties of the films were studied.

The inverted structure of organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) devices is known for its better stability as compared with traditional OPV devices. In this article, a device with the structure of ITO/ZnO/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag was fabricated, and the corresponding current–density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under one sun (simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 1b. The corresponding device parameters are shown in Table 1. It is observed that the shape of the J–V curves is strongly dependent on the volume ratio of MeOH with CN. For the pristine specimen without solvent treatment, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 8.53 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V, fill factor (FF) of 36.4% and PCE of 2.4% are measured. After treatment with the MeOH solvent, the above parameters stay almost constant, without significant change. It is believed that MeOH has no influence on the device performance. However, the Jsc and FF values significantly increase to 10.34 mA cm−2 and 56.9% respectively, after treatment with a binary solvent (MeOH:CN = 99.5:0.5, v/v), resulting in an improved PCE of 4.5%. A further increase in the CN volume ratio (MeOH:CN = 98:2, v/v) eventually leads to the highest PCE of 6.50% with a Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.79 V and FF of 69.0%. At a higher CN volume ratio (MeOH:CN = 95:5, v/v), the parameters including Jsc and FF of the devices obviously reduce to 10.20 mA cm−2 and 49.6%, showing a much lower PCE of 3.87%.

In order to explore and understand the effect of the MeOH:CN binary solvent on the optical properties of the films, the corresponding UV-visible absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1c. The pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film shows an obvious absorption between 400 nm and 750 nm, with two prominent absorption peaks at 620 nm and 670 nm. Using the MeOH solvent treatment, the absorption coefficient of the specimen shows no serious change. However, after treating with the binary solvents, the absorption coefficient of the absorption peaks significantly increases. As reported, the absorption peak at 670 nm is attributed to the vibronic structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, suggesting that the molecular ordering is enhanced. It indicates that the surface treatment with the binary solvents might facilitate the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, enhancing the π–π stacking. It is noted that the specimen treated with MeOH:CN solvent (98:2) exhibits the maximal absorption coefficient compared with the other specimens.
The dark current is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The bias ranges from −2 V to 2 V, and the negative bias represents the leakage current. There is obvious leakage current at the negative bias in the pristine device, whereas the leakage current of the device decreases after treating with the binary solvents. Notably, the leakage current reduces about 30-fold at −2 V for the specimen after treating with the MeOH:CN (98:2) solvent. A rectification factor of approximately 50 (from −2 V to 2 V) is observed for the pristine device, whereas a rectification factor of over 1000 (from −2 V to 2 V) is measured for the specimen after treating with the MeOH:CN (98:2) solvent.
Charge carrier mobilities in the films have a crucial effect on the performance of solar cells. To gain insight into how the performance of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM based device is influenced by the surface solvent treatments, the hole mobilities of the specimens were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 1d). The hole mobility of the pristine specimen is 6.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the results reported previously. After treating with MeOH, the hole mobility drops to 4.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, due to the isolated island structure as shown in the AFM images. After surface treatment with MeOH:CN solvent (98:2), the hole mobility is greatly improved to 5.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost one order of magnitude greater compared with the pristine specimen. The enhancement of hole mobility is mainly attributed to the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, as revealed by UV analysis.
The photovoltaic performance of the device is believed to be partly determined by the morphology of the active layer. It is well-known that a nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the active layer is necessary to efficiently separate the exciton and form percolating channels for the transport of both holes and electrons. The surface morphology of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM with and without MeOH:CN treatment was characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface topography and phase images were taken for different films as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 (ESI). The pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film is smooth and uniform, with a root-means-square (RMS) roughness of 0.504 nm. After treating with MeOH solvent, an abundant island structure is observed, with a RMS value of 1.24 nm. The island structure might be attributed to the formation of PCBM clusters induced by MeOH as reported in the P3HT:PCBM system. Following treatment with the MeOH:CN binary solvents, the surface morphology of the films experiences significant change, accompanied by increase of the RMS values. The phase-separated morphology for the specimen treated with MeOH:CN (99.5:0.5) becomes more obviously contrasted to the pristine specimen without solvent treatment. As the CN volume ratio increases, the bright regions become more dominant, and the domain size also increases. Upon treatment of specimen with MeOH:CN (98:2), the bright domains grow to a bigger size. Additionally, the RMS value is 12.71 nm, which is the highest among all the specimens. A further increase of the CN volume ratio eventually leads to the decrease of bright domain sizes, as well as the reduction of the RMS value to 9.57 nm. It is suggested that too much CN is not beneficial for the active layer to form an optimized morphology.
Due to the fact that AFM only provides information about the film surface morphology, the bulk morphology of the films was further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to understand the origin of the enhanced performance (Fig. 3). For the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film without solvent treatment, a homogeneous morphology without significant phase separation could be observed, indicating that the donor and acceptor molecules are well mixed. Through the treatment with MeOH, the homogeneous morphology of the film shows no obvious change except for a small amount of black aggregates attributed to PC71BM aggregates. In contrast, the film treated with MeOH:CN (99.5:0.5) presents a mass of fibril structures of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites with characteristic widths of about 5–10 nm and lengths of hundreds of nanometers, which ultimately leads to the formation of necessary pathways for charge transport to the electrodes. Further increasing the CN volume ratio in the binary solvent eventually leads to the appearance of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites of larger sizes. By increasing the CN content, the number of fibrils decreases, but their widths become larger. For the specimen treated with MeOH:CN solvent (98:2), the fibrils with widths up to 30 nm could be discerned, which is consistent with the result observed using AFM. A further increase in the volume fraction of CN in the binary solvent leads to the disappearance of evident p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fibrils. For the specimen treated with MeOH:CN solvent (95:5), the less obvious fibrils could be discerned in the TEM image, implying that an excess of CN solvent may dissolve the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fibrils.
Cross-sectional TEM analysis was further carried out on the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film (Fig. 4a) and the film after MeOH:CN (98:2) solvent treatment (Fig. 4b). It is observed that the thickness of the active layer decreases from 83 nm to 72 nm after the binary solvent treatment, indicating that some of the components in the active layer might be washed. According to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4c and d), the appearance of more diffraction spots in the image illustrates that the sample after solvent treatment is more crystalline than the pristine specimen.
In order to understand how the solvent treatments influence the corresponding crystalline structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, the two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique was used to obtain high-resolution scattering profiles, and the corresponding parameters of the diffraction signals are listed in Table S1 (ESI). As shown in Fig. 5, the diffraction patterns of the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM specimen and the specimen after treating with methanol seem to be similar, implying that the methanol has no influence on the crystalline structure of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Concerning the pristine specimen, a series of weak peaks at lower q values appear in the out-of-plane direction. The relatively obvious peak at q ≈ 0.31 Å−1 corresponds to a distance of 2.02 nm in real space, which is typically associated with alkyl stacking (100). The weaker reflections at q ≈ 0.52 Å−1 and 0.82 Å−1 could also be observed, which are preferentially oriented out-of-plane and are assigned to the second (200) and third (300) order reflections from the alkyl stacking. A weak out-of-plane reflection at q ≈ 1.72 Å−1 corresponds to a real-space distance of 3.65 Å and is attributed to intermolecular π-stacking (010) of the conjugated backbones. Additionally, the in-plane reflection at q ≈ 1.72 Å−1 could also be observed, indicating that most of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules tend to adopt both edge-on and face-on structures. After treatment with the MeOH:CN solvent (98:2), the scattering profiles become stronger and more obvious. An intense out-of-plane reflection at q ≈ 0.28 Å−1 corresponds to a distance of 2.24 nm in real space, associated with alkyl stacking (100). The position of the reflection shifts to lower q values compared with the pristine specimen. Moreover, the second and third order reflections are also stronger than those of the pristine specimen, with the position of reflection shifting to higher q values of 0.58 Å−1 and 0.85 Å−1. It is indicated that treatment with the binary solvent obviously affects the crystalline structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. The out-of-plane and in-plane reflection at q = 1.72 Å−1 could be observed, illustrating that the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 adopts both the edge-on and face-on structures. The isotropy of the reflection shows that there are some p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals oriented in all directions within the film.
As a more quantitative measure, we can calculate the crystal correlation length (CCL) which reflects the extent of order in crystalline lattice and increases with the crystallite size. The Scherrer equation was therefore used to estimate the CCL values from the peak breadths, and the corresponding data is illustrated in Table 2. The CCL value of the (100) reflection for the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM specimen is calculated to be about 17.1 nm. The values for the specimens after methanol and MeOH:CN (98:2) treatment are 17.6 nm and 25.0 nm, respectively. Moreover, the CCL values of the (010) reflection are calculated to be 8.5 nm, 8.5 nm and 15.5 nm for the pristine specimen, and the specimens after methanol or MeOH:CN (98:2) treatment, respectively. The above results indicate that the treatment with binary solvent obviously induces the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules. The enhancement of the absorption and photovoltaic properties of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM specimen after treating with MeOH:CN solvent (98:2) mainly originates from the formation of more perfect p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites.

The surface treatment with binary solvents composed of MeOH and CN was demonstrated to significantly enhance the PCE of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PCBM system from 2.4% to 6.5%, associated with the significant improvement of hole mobility. However, the MeOH solvent treatment was found to have no obvious influence on the photovoltaic property of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PCBM system. The UV-vis result indicated that the treatment with MeOH:CN (98:2) may enhance the absorption of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PCBM films, due to the improved molecular ordering for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules. The binary solvent treatment could increase the RMS value of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PCBM films from 0.504 nm to 12.71 nm, accompanied by the formation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals with larger sizes as revealed by AFM observation. The TEM results further indicates that the treatment with MeOH had no obvious influence on the film morphology, while the treatment with the binary solvent could induce the formation of a better nanofibril network, leading to higher crystallinity of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites as demonstrated by SAED analysis. The GIWAXS results revealed that the treatment with the MeOH:CN binary solvent could significantly induce the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules, showing larger CCL values as compared with the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PCBM specimen. The method could be applicable for the other small molecular systems for the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance.
