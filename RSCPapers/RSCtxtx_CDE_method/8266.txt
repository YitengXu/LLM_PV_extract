Electrospun carbon nanofiber (ECN)/TiO2 nanoparticle composite counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were successfully prepared by spray-coating an ECN/TiO2 (1:1 by weight) mixture on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass substrate. TiO2 particles (Degussa P25) were used to bind carbon nanofibers and adhere them to the FTO-glass substrate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements revealed that the spray-coated ECN/TiO2 composite CEs have lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and higher interfacial capacitance (Q) than those of Pt CEs. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) further indicated that ECN/TiO2 composite CEs have a faster tri-iodide reduction rate than those of Pt CEs. DSSCs fabricated using ECN/TiO2 CEs showed a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.25% under 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, which is comparable to that of thermally deposited Pt based DSSCs (η = 7.57%). Moreover, ECN/TiO2 composite CE based DSSCs demonstrated almost equal power conversion efficiency to that of Pt based cells by adding only 8 wt% Pt, which unveiled a cost-effective alternative of costly Pt CEs in DSSCs.

A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) converts solar energy into electrical energy. It is a promising cost effective third-generation solar cell technology. During the past two decades, a lot of research has been conducted on DSSCs as an alternative to the conventional silicon based solar cells. The DSSC technology has attracted interest among researchers because of its low cost and ease of production. A DSSC typically consists of a photoanode and a counter electrode (CE) with I−/I3− electrolyte filled in between. The photoanode usually consists of sintered TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO)-glass substrate and the CE is generally a TCO-glass substrate coated with platinum (Pt). A TiO2 film acts as an electron transport layer and the electrons produced by the excitation of dye molecules under light illumination are transported by it to the TCO-glass substrate. These electrons travel to the CE through an external circuit. The oxidized dye regains the lost electrons from I− ions in the electrolyte and the electrolyte gets electrons from the CE.

The major research focuses in DSSC technology are efficiency improvement, stability improvement and cost reduction of the cells. Among these, the search for abundantly available materials for use in CEs instead of Pt has been ongoing because such materials are required for the production of high power electricity (terawatts). As platinum is costly, the replacement of Pt with carbonaceous materials like carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphite, electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNs) can be a promising approach. A great deal of work is also going on to replace Pt with materials such as metal sulphides, metal nitrides, conducting polymers and metal phosphides. Among these, carbon materials are being more researched because apart from the large abundance of carbonaceous materials, carbon materials have high electro-catalytic abilities as well as greater stability against the corrosive I−/I3− redox couple than Pt. Carbon materials have high surface area due to their rough or porous morphology. This leads to a larger number of sites for tri-iodide reduction than Pt, which only provides a limited planar contact area for the electrolyte. Previous studies showed that ECN based CEs had been fabricated by grinding and doctor blading techniques. Polyoxyethylene (12) tridecyl ether (POETE) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) sodium salt has been used as a binder and a power conversion efficiency of 6.3% was achieved with a fill factor of 0.54.
In this paper, we present ECN–TiO2 composite CEs prepared by the spray coating technique. TiO2 (Degussa P25) was used as a binder for interconnection among the carbon nanofibers as well as for adhesion of fibers with an FTO-glass substrate. The new CE exhibited good electro-catalytic performance with lower charge transfer resistance (Rct), higher interfacial capacitance (Q) and a faster reduction rate of tri-iodide ions than the conventional Pt. The fill factor (FF) increased significantly by the spray coating technique compared to previously reported grinding and doctor blading techniques. Moreover, it was found that after adding only 8% Pt to the CE based DSSCs, the FF increased causing the efficiency to be comparable to Pt CE based DSSCs. EIS indicated further decrease in Rct and increase in interfacial capacitance (Q) after addition of Pt to ECN/TiO2 (1:1) composite CEs.

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to make a solution, which was then filled into a plastic syringe having a stainless-steel needle. 25 kV was applied to the needle by a high voltage power supply and a flow rate of 1.0 ml h−1 was maintained. Al foil on a roller with a diameter of 10 in. was grounded and it was rolled at a speed of 10 rpm to collect the PAN nanofibers as an overlaid mat. The PAN nanofiber mat was then removed from Al foil and placed between two graphite plates for thermal treatments of stabilization in air and carbonization in argon in a tube furnace. The stabilization was performed by annealing the mat at 280 °C for 6 h under a constant air flow. Such a stabilized nanofiber mat was then heated to 1200 °C at the 5 °C min−1 ramp rate in argon and treated at 1200 °C for 1 h. The final ECN mats had a width and length of ∼10 cm, a thickness of ∼40 μm, and a mass per unit area of ∼15 g m−2.


An anode was prepared by spin coating a TiO2 compact layer on an FTO-glass substrate. Then, a 12 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer (Solaronix Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) was doctor bladed, followed by deposition of a 4 μm thick layer of a light scattering layer (Solaronix Ti-Nanooxide R/SP). After that, it was immersed in 40 mM of TiCl4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 30 min. After each step, the anode was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, it was immersed in dye solution containing 0.3 mM Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA dye (N-719) in acetonitrile–t-butanol (volume ratio: 1/1) for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the anode was rinsed in acetonitrile to remove the excess dye.


A Pt counter electrode (CE) was prepared by depositing 40 nm Pt on an FTO-glass substrate using Pt precursor solution (0.02 M H2PtCl6·6H20 in anhydrous ethanol), and heating it at 400 °C for 15 min in air.


First, the ECN mat was crushed into powder. 0.01 g ECN was mixed with TiO2 (Degussa P25) in the weight ratio of 1:1. After that, 4 ml of ethanol was added to the mixture and sonicated for 40 min. This solution was then coated onto an FTO-glass substrate using a spray coater, followed by thermal treatment at 60 °C for 1 h, and 450 °C for 30 min, both in air. Also, counter electrodes using the Pt added ECN–TiO2 (1:1) composite were prepared, in which 25 volume% of the Pt precursor that is used to make Pt CE based DSSCs was added to the ECN–TiO2 (1:1) composite, and heated at 450 °C for 30 min in air. The reason for annealing the ECN:TiO2 counter electrode in air in a closed oven at 450 °C is that TiO2 as a binder is typically annealed at 450–500 °C to increase the interconnection between TiO2 nanoparticles and the adhesion of the ECN–TiO2 counter electrode with the FTO substrate. Usually carbon reacts with O2 in air at 300 °C but with a slow rate. With temperature goes up to 450 °C, the reaction rate may increase. However, from the SEM images shown in Fig. 1 and 2, we can still see a lot of carbon nanofibers in the ECN–TiO2 composite counter electrode after 30 min at 450 °C. Therefore, it was believed that the reaction between carbon and O2 is not fast enough to burn out all carbon nanofibers during the 30 minute annealing in air. The same annealing temperature in air has been reported by Murakami et al. using the carbon black counter electrode.


A photoanode and a counter electrode were sealed and assembled using a thermoplastic sealant. An electrolyte containing 0.03 M I2, 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidaz-olium (BMII), 0.10 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 by volume) was then injected into the cells through the reserved channel.


Two FTO-glass substrates coated with an identical material, Pt or ECN–TiO2 or Pt added ECN–TiO2 were assembled in the same way as for other DSSCs.


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using a computer-controlled Ametek VERSASTAT3-200 potentiostat with a frequency analysis module (FDA). The AC signal of amplitude 10 mV in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz at 0.8 V (∼Voc) DC bias voltage under dark conditions was used. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were performed using a Pt wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and our CE as the working electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI and 0.5 mM I2 using 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate as the supporting electrolyte at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s−1. J–V characteristics of the cells were tested under AM 1.5 illumination at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. For this measurement, a xenon lamp (Newport 67005) with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the light source.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed using a Hitachi S-4300N SEM.


Fig. 1 shows (a) top view SEM images of the pure ECN mat, (b) crushed ECN:TiO2 composite counter electrodes with a 1:1 wt% mixing ratio; and EDS mapping images of (c) C and (d) Ti in the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) composite counter electrode. The CEs were prepared by ultra-sonication, followed by spray coating their solutions on an FTO-glass substrate. The nanofibers which were originally tens of micrometers long were broken into sub-microns to microns by crushing and sonicating the fibers. The spaces between carbon nanofibers were filled with TiO2 particles as indicated in Fig. 1b.


Table 1 shows the percentage concentrations by weight of C, Ti and O in the CE. The percentage concentrations by weight of C, Ti and O were found to be about 48.7%, 36% and 15%, respectively. The EDS images showed that C is in nanofiber structures, while Ti is distributed homogenously across the image. The lower percentage concentration of oxygen (15%) than expected 24% might be due to the reason below. For low-Z elements such as O, in addition to the X-ray generation, Auger electron emission can also take place. The Auger electron emission can decrease the intensity of X-ray emission, leading to a lower concentration of O element in the composite. This is why O percentage is less than what is seen in Tables 1 and 2. Since the observed EDX for O is less than what it supposed to be, the relative concentration of Ti may be higher than the real data, which could lead to a total percentage higher than 100% considering O wt% as 24%. In addition, when we prepared the sample of the ECN–TiO2 composite, the weight ratio is 1:1, however we found that the C concentration is 48% in Table 1, which is slightly lower than the expected 50%, which can be explained by the same reason discussed above.

Fig. 2 shows (a) the top view SEM image of Pt added ECN:TiO2 composite counter electrodes, in which ECN and TiO2 were mixed at 1:1 weight ratios; EDS mapping images of (b) C, (c) Ti and (d) Pt. Similarly as above, the EDS images showed that C is in nanofiber structures, while Ti is distributed homogenously across the image. The distribution of Pt in the composite film is indicated by blue regions in the mapping image acquired from EDS of the composite CE. Table 2 shows that Pt was about 8% by weight in the Pt added ECN:TiO2 composite CE. This signifies that the 25 volume% of the Pt precursor that was used to make Pt CE based DSSCs is equivalent to about 8 wt% in the composite film.

Fig. 3 shows CVs of (a) different weight ratios of ECN:TiO2 (10:1, 5:1, 1:1 and 1:5) each of 24 μm thick, and (b) Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1). The thicknesses of Pt, ECN:TiO2 and Pt added ECN:TiO2 were 40 nm, 24 μm and 24 μm, respectively. The CV plots are from the first scan, but they do not change significantly and are quite stable even after 5 scans. The pair of oxidation and reduction peaks on the right side results from the redox reaction of 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−, which has almost no effect on the cell performance, and the pair of oxidation and reduction peaks on the left comes from the redox reaction I3− + 2e− → 3I−, which directly affects the device performance of DSSCs.Fig. 3a shows that ECN:TiO2 (1:1) had both larger oxidation and reduction current density. Similarly, in Fig. 3b, the larger oxidation–reduction current density for the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) device compared to Pt indicates a faster reduction of tri-iodide ions. Moreover, after addition of Pt to the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) composite CE, the reduction rate of tri-iodide increased, indicating further decrease of charge transfer resistance.

Fig. 4a shows the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) electrochemical cells deposited on an FTO-glass substrate. Fig. 4b shows the equivalent circuit diagram used to fit the impedance spectra. The circuit consists of charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, series resistance (Rs) at the counter electrode, constant phase element (CPE), and Warburg/Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw) of the I−/I3− redox couple in a thin layer of the electrolyte. The CPE represents the interfacial capacitance between the electrodes and electrolytes. The impedance of CPE is given by ZCPE = (jω)−α/Q, where Q is the CPE parameter, α is the CPE exponent (0 < α < 1), and ω represents the angular frequency. Q and α are frequency independent parameters of the CPE. The depression of a semicircle signifies the reduction of the value of α from 1. A simple capacitor has α = 1, indicated by a perfect semicircle and the deviation of α signifies the roughness of the electrodes causing depression of the semicircle to an ellipse in the Nyquist plot. The semicircles which represent the charge transfer resistance (Rct) are only shown in Fig. 3a. The fitted Nyquist plots are summarized in Table 3. The Rcts of Pt and ECN:TiO2 (1:1) were 1.36 Ω cm2 and 0.64 Ω cm2, respectively. This indicates the stronger electrolytic capability of the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CE than the Pt CE. This result matches with the cyclic voltammograms (CV) observed. However, the series resistance (Rs) of the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CE was higher than that of the Pt CE. The Rss of ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt were 4.48 Ω cm2 and 3.1 Ω cm2, respectively. The higher Rs of the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CE can be attributed to its thicker layer (24 μm). Moreover, after adding Pt to the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CEs, the Rct and Rs were found to be 0.16 Ω cm2 and 3.31 Ω cm2, respectively. These reduced values might be due to higher conductivity of the composite after addition of Pt. Also, the interfacial capacitance (Q) of Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) were found to be in the increasing order, suggesting a larger surface area. The smaller α indicated the higher porosity of ECN:TiO2 (1:1) than Pt.

Fig. 5a shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves for Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1), and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) based cells under AM 1.5 illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Table 4 summarizes the DSSC performance. The power conversion efficiencies (η %) of Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) based cells were 7.57%, 7.25% and 7.46%, respectively. Short circuit current densities (Jsc) for Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) based cells were 13.62 mA cm−2, 13.69 mA cm−2 and 13.47 mA cm−2, respectively, which were comparable. The similar values of Jsc were verified by evaluating incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectral action responses of these cells in Fig. 5b. The open circuit voltages (Voc) observed for Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) were 0.83 V, 0.84 V and 0.84 V, respectively. The FFs of Pt, ECN:TiO2 (1:1) and Pt added ECN:TiO2 (1:1) were 0.67, 0.63 and 0.66, respectively. The FF of ECN:TiO2 (1:1) based cells was less than the Pt based cells and this can be attributed to the high series resistance due to the bulk of thicker ECNs. This was the reason for slightly lower efficiency of ECN:TiO2 (1:1) based cells compared to Pt based cells. However, this value of FF, 0.63, is higher than the FF of 0.54 or 0.57 reported previously using pure ECNs as counter electrodes. The increase of FF as compared to the results reported before can be attributed to reduction of total series resistance by using TiO2 instead of polyoxyethylene (12) tridecyl ether (POETE) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) sodium salt as a binder, which can increase the resistances of the CE. In addition, the total series resistance of a complete cell (Rs) was calculated using the fitted J–V curve near Voc. It was found that the Rss for Pt and ECN:TiO2 (1:1) were 8.99 Ω cm2 and 14.05 Ω cm2, respectively. Moreover, after adding 8 wt% of Pt to the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CEs, the Rs decreased from 14.05 Ω cm2 to 12.82 Ω cm2, which caused improvement of the FF from 0.63 to 0.66. This can be attributed to the decrease in series resistance of the cathode (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) after addition of Pt to the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CE, as discussed before in EIS analysis.

In summary, a spray coated carbon nanofiber and titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite counter electrode (CE) on an FTO glass substrate has been demonstrated as an efficient electro-catalyst for triiodide reduction in DSSCs. The use of TiO2 as a binder instead of POETE and CMC sodium salt as well as the implementation of the spray coating technique instead of grinding and doctor-blading techniques, reported previously, led to an increase in the fill factor of these DSSCs. The efficiency achieved using the spray coating technique and TiO2 as a binder to ECN was 7.25%, which was comparable to the efficiency (7.57%) of the conventional solution-processed Pt based cells. Moreover, after adding only 8 wt% Pt to the ECN:TiO2 (1:1) CEs, the efficiency of ECN:TiO2 (1:1) increased to be comparable with that of conventional Pt based DSSCs.
