In this work, a hexylthiophene substituted thiophene-bridge is used to connect benzodithiophene (BDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) segments to build a new photovoltaic polymer (PBDT-DTTBT). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the polymer is decreased by 0.2 eV to −5.47 eV compared to the reference polymer without a hexylthiophene side chain, which may be ascribed to the conformational torsion caused by the steric hindrance from the bulky hexylthiophene side group. The band gap of the polymer shows no obvious change compared to a polymer with a same backbone without a hexylthiophene side chain (around 1.7 eV). Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PBDT-DTTBT and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.19% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.72 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 60.97%. The work provides a new method to design new conjugated polymers with a deep HOMO level and a low band gap for high Voc PSCs.

Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention over the past decade, owing to their distinctive potential for fabricating light-weight, large-area and flexible devices by the low-cost roll-to-roll processing technique. Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% has been achieved for both single and tandem solar cells. However, ideal polymer materials are still needed for their further commercialization. To obtain high PCE, photovoltaic polymers should be designed with consideration of various factors, such as high hole mobility, suitable molecular energy levels, broad absorption and decent solubility. To harvest more solar energy, low band-gap (LBG) conjugated polymers should be designed and synthesized. Using alternative donor–acceptor (D–A) structures to design the backbones of LBG polymers has become the most popular and successful strategy. By the rational selection and optimization of D–A building blocks to hybridize the frontier orbital of the electron-rich units (donors) and the electron-deficient units (acceptors), the band gaps of the polymers can be effectively tuned, as well as the molecular energy levels and optical properties.

As is well-known, PCE is a product of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Voc is proportional to the energy level difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the conjugated polymer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene, and thus a deeper HOMO level polymer is crucial to obtain higher Voc. Yang et al. did a systematic study on PBDTBzT-DTffBT with a PCE of 7.3% containing benzothienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT), which has a deep HOMO level at −5.47 eV, corresponding to a Voc of 0.9 V. Huang et al. synthesized three polymers with a new acceptor unit of naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(2-octyl[1,2,3]triazole) (TZNT), and realized a PCE of 7.1% with a high Voc of 0.9 V. Beaujuge et al. constructed the conjugated polymers PBDT(T)TPD(CO) polymerized from two-dimensional BDT with thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD), and the device showed a high PCE of 6.7% with a high Voc of 1.05 V. In terms of these materials’ structures, the design strategy of “weak donor” and “strong acceptor” was used, which led to deep HOMO energy levels, thereby increasing Voc. But in some cases, by using strong acceptors to build high Voc OPV materials, the researchers have to accept the increased bandgap (Eg) and the resulting decreased Jsc.
Besides the approach of using strong acceptors, there are also some other ways to increase Voc of OPV materials, such as the bulky side chain engineering. For classical polythiophene (PT) systems, the bulky groups as side chains were reported to show a strong steric hindrance effect between bulky side groups and adjacent thiophene repeating units. The steric hindrance caused a large dihedral angle and thus the conjugated degree of the main chains decreased, consequently leading to a deep HOMO level while the bulky side groups led to large band gaps resulting in low Jsc as the “weak donor” and “strong acceptor” strategy did. Hsu et al. constructed an indacenodithiophene based polymer (PIDTHT-BT) with pendent n-hexylthiophene units. When the conjugated side chains induced conformational twisting of PIDTHT-BT, a deep HOMO level was obtained. Compared with the PSC device performance based on PIDTDT-BT (an indacenodithiophene polymer without an n-hexylthiophene chain), the Voc of a PIDTHT-BT based PSC device increased by 0.2 V approximately and a high Jsc remained.
In this paper, to further explore the steric hindrance effect on the energy levels and Eg, we selected benzodithiophene (BDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) as donor and acceptor building blocks, and introduced a hexylthiophene substituent to the thiophene bridges between BDT and BT to construct the target polymer PBDT-DTTBT. Compared to other donor units, such as indacenodithiophene, carbazole and fluorene, a BDT unit has an asymmetric and planar conjugated structure, which can easily realize an ordered π–π stacking with a large domain size. As a rigid ring, thiophene has a larger volume than the alkyl chains. When attached to the main chains, the thiophene side chain can twist the polymer backbone for a deeper HOMO level. Moreover, a strong electrostatic repulsion effect between electronegative sulfur atoms in the thiophene side chains and the adjacent BDT units, may further promote the torsion effect. The synthesized polymer exhibited a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.47 eV, and an unchanged band gap of 1.7 eV, compared to other reported polymers with the same backbone. By this method, the Voc was increased by ∼0.1 V, compared to the reference polymer PBDT-DTBT, and a maximum PCE of 6.19% was obtained.

The synthetic routes of the monomers and the target polymer are shown in Scheme 1. The experimental section provides the detailed experimental procedures for the synthesis of the monomers and the polymer, where DTTBT and BDT-Sn were synthesized according to the previously reported methods. 5-Hexyl-2,3′-bithiophene was introduced into a BT core by the Stille coupling reaction using bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2(PPh3)2) as the catalyst to construct compound 4. DTTBT was prepared with bromine in a mixed solvent of chloroform and acetic acid. The polymer PBDT-DTTBT was synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization between DTTBT and BDT-Sn in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3. The polymer can be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene. The structure of the synthesized polymer was characterized by 1H NMR. The PBDT-DTTBT polymer shows a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 54.93 kDa, a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 210.3 kDa, and a polydispersity index of 3.8, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).


The thermal stability of the polymer was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer has good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature at 340.7 °C (5% weight loss) as shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, the thermal stability of conjugated polymers is high enough for their application in PSCs. This high decomposition temperature can depress the deformation of the polymer/PCBM blend film morphology and the degradation of the blended active layer under applied electric fields in PSC devices.


The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PBDT-DTTBT in dilute chloroform solution and in a thin film on a quartz substrate are shown in Fig. 2. PBDT-DTTBT displays a broad absorption from ∼400 nm to ∼700 nm in solution, and two feature absorption bands are observed with the absorption peak located at 422 and 588 nm, corresponding to the localized π–π* transitions of the polymer backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating BDT unit and the thiophene bridge to the electron-accepting benzothiadiazole unit, respectively. As to the film, PBDT-DTTBT shows broader absorption and a distinct red-shift compared to that in solution. The red-shift should be attributed to better planarity of the polymer with the extension of the conjugated structures and a stronger electronic interaction between the polymer chains in the film state. In addition, a shoulder peak located at 610 nm indicates a strong intermolecular π–π* stacking as a result of the aggregations of the polymer chains. The absorption onset of the PBDT-DTTBT film is at 718 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.73 eV. In addition, the polymer exhibits an absorption coefficient of 5.1 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 in the CHCl3 solution and an absorption coefficient 6.1 × 104 cm−1 in the thin solid film at the absorption peak (Fig. S1), which is similar to the previously reported polymers.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure the electronic energy levels of the conjugated polymer. The HOMO level can be readily estimated from the onset oxidation potential in the cyclic voltammogram. The cyclic voltammogram of a PBDT-DTTBT film is shown in Fig. 3. To obtain the oxidation potential of the polymer, the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), which had a redox potential with an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV in a vacuum; the potential of this external standard under the same conditions was 0.39 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). As shown in Fig. 3, the onset oxidation potential (Eox) is 1.06 V vs. SCE. According to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)), the HOMO level of PBDT-DTTBT is −5.47 eV, which is a relative deep HOMO level among the alkyl substituted BDT-DTBT polymers. Here, the polymers with the 2D-BDT structure were excluded from this comparison, because it has been suggested that the 2D structure can affect the HOMO levels and Voc of PSC devices. The deep HOMO should be attributed to the decreased degree of the π-orbital overlap along the main chains caused by a strong steric interaction between the rigid thiophene side group and the adjacent BDT units. The interaction between the electronegative sulfur atoms in the conjugated side chains and the adjacent BDT units may further increase the distortion. The LUMO level is −3.74 eV, calculated from the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg, which is significantly higher than that of PC71BM (ca. −3.91 eV); thus, efficient exciton dissociation can be expected in the solar cell devices.

The band gap, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDT-DTTBT are listed in Table 3 in comparison with other five polymers with the same backbones. It can be found that PBDT-DTTBT has a relatively deep HOMO level compared to others, but the band gap is very similar to the other polymers (around 1.7 eV). The result shows that introducing a hexylthiophene substituent to the thiophene bridges can simultaneously down-shift the HOMO and LUMO energy levels without changing the band gap of the polymer.

To evaluate the impact of conformation torsion on molecular architecture and consequently on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. The optimized molecular geometries were confirmed to be minimum-energy conformations by computing vibrational frequencies at the same level. The dihedral angles, HOMO and LUMO energy levels, band gaps and corresponding electron distributions were calculated, where the counterpart polymer PBDTT-DTBT (without a hexylthiophene substituent) was also calculated for comparison. To minimize the computation demand, the alkyl chains attached to BDT units and thiophene side groups were replaced by methyl groups in the calculation process. The molecular structure sketch used for computation is shown in Fig. 4, where θ1 is the dihedral angle between BDT units and thiophene bridges, θ2 is the dihedral angle between thiophene bridges and BT units, θ3 is the dihedral angle between thiophene bridges and methylthiophene side groups drawn in red (Fig. 4 and 5).

As shown in Table 1, the dihedral angle θ1 between BDT units and thiophene bridges and θ2 between thiophene bridges and BT units of PBDT-DTBT are 5.6° and 0.2° respectively, implying relatively planar conformation of PBDT-DTBT. In contrast, PBDT-DTTBT has obviously larger θ1 and θ2 compared to that of PBDT-DTBT, which should be attributed to the strong steric hindrance of the thiophene side groups causing conformation torsion. In this case, the π-orbital overlap between neighboring aromatic units is decreased, which may lead to changes in the frontier orbital energy levels. There is also a large dihedral angle θ3 between methylthiophene side groups and thiophene bridges, which implies large torsion between thiophene side groups and thiophene bridges, and the large torsion leads to a negligible π-orbital overlap between thiophene side groups and the backbone, which is consistent with the calculated energy distribution shown in Fig. 5. The distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of the two polymers are similar, where the HOMO is delocalized over the whole backbone while the LUMO is mainly located in the BT units and thiophene bridges.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBDT-DTTBT, BHJ PSC devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-DTTBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated and characterized under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 with different active layer thicknesses and donor–acceptor weight ratios, where the polymer was used as the electron donor and PC71BM was used as the electron acceptor (Table S1 and Fig. S2). It was found that the optimized performance was achieved with the weight ratio of PBDT-DTTBT:PC71BM at 1:1 (w/w) and the thickness of the active layer at about 130 nm. According to many previously reported studies, a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) can drastically enhance the interpenetrating nanoscale morphology, thus improving the PCE of PSCs for polymer/fullerene systems. So different ratios of DIO were added to the PBDT-DTTBT:PC71BM system to further improve the PCE of the devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices with different contents of DIO are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of devices based on PBDT-DTTBT/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blend films with or without DIO. Without any additives or post-treatments, a moderate average PCE of 3.76% was achieved with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 9.48 mA cm−2 and a FF of 47.96%. After processing with 2% v/v DIO, the optimal average PCE of 6.05% was obtained. Compared to the device without an additive, the Jsc and FF values of the device with 2% DIO increased to 12.56 mA cm−2 and 60.38%, respectively. The EQE with 2% DIO exhibits a maximum value of 69%, which is higher than that without DIO (47%), and therefore, DIO treated devices show higher Jsc.

The donor photon energy loss is defined as Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the optical band gap of the donor polymer and Voc is obtained from the corresponding solar cell device with either PC61BM or PC71BM. Here, the Eg − eVoc values of PBDT-DTTBT and the other analogs are calculated and shown in Table 3. The Eg − eVoc value of PBDT-DTTBT is 0.93 eV, which is close to other efficient PSC materials PBDTHDO-DTHBTff (0.92 eV) and PBDTDTBT (0.93 eV). It implies hexylthiophene side chains can help the polymer to show good photovoltaic performance in polymer analogs with a same backbone.

To further investigate the effect of a DIO additive on the photovoltaic properties, the hole mobility was characterized via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The calculated mobility values of the devices with or without 2% DIO are 1.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 7.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7. The higher hole mobility after adding DIO can well explain the improvement of Jsc and PCE in solar cells.
The influence of DIO on the morphology of the blend films of PBDT-DTTBT/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) was investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the images are shown in Fig. 8. The surface of the blend films without DIO is relatively smooth (Fig. 8A), corresponding to root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 0.98 nm. The surface topography became rougher after adding 2% DIO (v/v) with a RMS value of 3.82 nm (Fig. 8B). Moreover, the scale of the dark and light domains became obvious (Fig. 8C and 8D), implying appropriately enhanced aggregations and suitable interpenetrating networks formed in the active layer after DIO treatment, which are beneficial for the exciton dissociation and charge carriers transport. This led to a distinct photocurrent improvement of the solar cell devices after DIO treatment (from 9.48 to 12.56 mA cm−2). The low crystallinity of the polymer was proved by XRD (Fig. S4).

A novel conjugated BDT polymer (PBDT-DTTBT) is prepared by introducing a hexylthiophene substituent to the thiophene bridges between BDT units and BT units. The steric hindrance effect from the flanking hexylthiophene groups can make the main chain twist strongly compared with the non-substituted reference polymer PBDT-DTBT. The twist effect can decrease the conjugation degree of the backbone, and a deep HOMO level can be obtained. More interestingly, the torsion does not make the band gap change which ensures good light harvesting. The DIO optimized PSC devices show a maximum PCE of 6.19% with a Voc of 0.80 V, which is a high Voc for a polymer with the same backbone. The work provides an effective method to design polymers with a deep HOMO level and a low band gap for high Voc PSCs.


All of the chemicals were purchased from J&K Scientific and other commercial sources. The reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification, except for tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. 2-Bromo-5-hexylthiophene (compound 1), 5-hexyl-2,3′-bithiophene (compound 2), tributyl(5-hexyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-5′-yl)stannane (compound 3) and BDT-Sn were synthesized according to the previously reported literature (Scheme 1). 4,7-Bis(5-hexyl[2,3′-bithiophen]5′yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (compound 4), 4,7-bis(2′-bromo-5-hexyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-5′-yl)benzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTTBT) and PBDT-DTTBT were synthesized according to Scheme 1. Synthesis details are described below.



1H and 13C NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance III 600 (600 MHz) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC using THF as the solvent and polystyrene as the standard under 40 °C. TGA was performed on a SDT Q600 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded by using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. CV measurements were performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation under an argon atmosphere in a solution of Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at ambient temperature with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and an SCE reference electrode. DFT calculations were carried out by the Gaussian 09 program suite at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. The optimized molecular geometries were confirmed to be minimum-energy conformations by computing vibrational frequencies at the same level. Surface morphological characterization of the films was characterized by using a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400). The XRD spectrum was recorded on a Hitachi S-4800.


The solar cell devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-DTTBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al on 15 mm × 15 mm patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. The ITO glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, toluene, methanol and isopropyl alcohol sequentially and then with an oxygen plasma treatment for 20 min, the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) and then dried at 160 °C for 20 min. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of PBDT-DTTBT and PC71BM (30 mg mL−1) with different weight ratios in DIO/DCB (0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, or 4% v/v) solution on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Then, the Ca/Al cathode was deposited on the active layer by vacuum evaporation under 3 × 10−4 Pa. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The thickness of the active layer was determined using a Dektak 150 profilometer. The EQE of solar cells was analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.


Under an argon atmosphere, compound 3 (6 mmol, 3.24 g), 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (2 mmol, 588 mg) and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (0.1 mmol, 78 mg) were placed into a 100 mL two-necked round-bottom flask in 10 mL of anhydrous toluene. The reactant was refluxed at 80 °C for 24 hours. Then the reaction was quenched with 50 mL of cool water and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with water and dried over magnesium sulfate, and then the crude product was obtained by vacuum evaporation and purified by silica gel column chromatography using petroleum ether:dichloromethane (5:1) as an eluent to obtain the target compound 4 (0.82 g, yield 65%) as a red solid. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.33 (d, 2H, J = 1.33 Hz, ArH), 7.93 (s, 2H, ArH), 7.44 (d, 2H, J = 1.31 Hz, ArH), 7.15 (d, 2H, ArH), 6.77 (d, 2H, ArH), 2.86 (t, 4H, CH2), 1.77–1.72 (m, 4H, CH2), 1.46–1.41 (m, 4H, CH2), 1.37–1.35 (m, 8H, CH2), 0.94 (t, 6H, CH3) (Fig. S5).


Compound 4 (1.27 g, 2 mmol) was dissolved in 60 mL of chloroform and ethyl acetate (v/v, 4:1), and NBS (392 mg, 2.2 mmol) was added in small portions. The reactant was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, and then 50 mL water was poured into the reaction mixture. After extraction with chloroform, the organic layer was washed with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. The crude product was obtained by vacuum evaporation and purified by silica gel column chromatography using petroleum ether:dichloromethane (5:1) as an eluent, and then recrystallized from isopropanol. The DTTBT monomer (1.42 g, yield 90%) was obtained after drying under vacuum at 50 °C overnight. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.04 (s, 2H, ArH), 7.77 (s, 2H, ArH), 7.39 (d, 2H, ArH), 6.82 (d, 2H, ArH), 2.87 (t, 4H, CH2), 1.78–1.73 (m, 4H, CH2), 1.47–1.42 (m, 4H, CH2) 1.38–1.36 (m, 8H, CH2), 0.94 (t, 6H, CH3). 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 152.10, 146.42, 138.80, 135.30, 133.79, 127.57, 126.11, 125.06, 124.96, 124.33, 109.42, 31.63, 31.62, 30.18, 28.88, 22.62, 14.12 (Fig. S6 and S7).


In a 50 mL two-necked flask, the DTTBT monomer (158 mg, 0.2 mmol), BDT-Sn (222 mg, 0.2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (1.86 mg, 0.002 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of anhydrous toluene. Then, the mixture was stirred and purged with argon for 30 min and vigorously stirred at 80 °C for 48 h under argon. After cooling down to room temperature, the solution was added dropwise to methanol and filtered. The crude product was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexane for 24 hours, respectively. Finally, the polymer was purified by silica gel column chromatography (80–100 mesh), and dried under vacuum.
