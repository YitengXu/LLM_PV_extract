Novel HT-poly[3-(6′-N,N,N-trimethylammonium)-hexyl thiophene] (P3HTN) is developed and the use of the water-soluble thiophene as an interfacial layer for low-cost poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) organic photovoltaic cells with high stability in air is investigated. When P3HTN is simply inserted between the active layer and the cathode as an interfacial dipole layer by spin-coating, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of photovoltaic cells with high work function Al metal cathodes dramatically increase. Resulting from a reduction of the metal work function and improved electron extraction efficiency, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices annealed in air is enhanced from 1.8% to 3.28%. In particular, the analogue of the active layer as a buffer layer could improve interchain interactions between the P3HT and the P3HTN to modify the interfacial contact, consequently obtaining an unattainable enhancement Jsc, with respect to the interlayer polymer replaced with an unanalogous conjugated polymer. The results would supply useful information to understand the contribution of an interfacial layer on the photovoltaic performance.

Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), comprising a phase separated mixture with interpenetrating networks of the conjugated polymers (electron donor) and fullerene derivatives (electron acceptor), are a focus of research directed toward low cost conversion of sunlight to electricity. Several methods for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ solar cells are known to be effective and control of charge carrier transport at heterointerfaces in multilayer structures is one of the most important issues in the improvement of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). It has been reported that insertion of buffer layers between the organic layer and the electrodes improves the device performance.

A preferred and simple method to enhance the contact between the electrode and the active layer is modification of the electrode by insertion of a buffer layer. For example, the insertion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) between the ITO anode and the active layer is commonly used in OPVs to enhance hole collection and increase Voc. In the case of cathode modification, it is suggested that a thin LiF layer improves cell efficiency through the formation of an interfacial dipole that reduces the work function of Al for better electron collection. However, LiF is not an ideal interfacial layer in polymer based cells for the following reasons: the LiF layer must be very thin (<1.2 nm), which is difficult to achieve, and vapor deposition of LiF in a vacuum is not well-suited for the use in high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing, which is the most significant advantage of polymer-based cells. In particular, Zhang et al. have demonstrated that a solution-processed poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) layer can form internal dipoles at the active layer/Al interface, resulting in enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and Voc. These water-soluble polymers are also advantageous because they do not damage the underlying organic soluble polymer film.
This organic-based interfacial layer that can be created using a simple solution-based process may be desirable for the realization of low-cost and high-efficiency OPVs. Until very recently, a few approaches for an organic-based interfacial layer in OPVs have been reported and Bazan et al. have reported that the PCE of the polycarbazole bulk heterojunction solar cells can be increased from 5% to 6.5% by incorporating an ultrathin cationic polythiophene layer, which provides better understanding of the functional polythiophene buffer layers for managing solar cell performance. However, to date, insertion of an organic-based cathode interfacial layer into P3HT/PCBM-based OPVs has not been obviously achieved. And the limited thermal stability of polymer-based devices continues to hinder the path toward commercialization. The aim of the present study is to realize a low-cost and high-efficiency organic solar cell with high air-stable property by insertion of a thiophene-based cathode interfacial layer into the cell using a simple solution-based process.
The synthesis of water-soluble HT-poly[3-(6′-N,N,N-trimethylammonium)-hexyl thiophene] (P3HTN) is shown in Scheme 1. The compound 3-bromohexylthiophene was prepared according to a previously published process. The neutral regioregular polymer P3HTBr was synthesized from the corresponding monomer via the GRIM polymerization reaction. Formation of the ionic water-soluble polymers P3HTN was achieved in high yields via quaternization of polymer P3HTBr with trimethylamine in a THF/water mixture, see the Experimental part in the ESI. 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1) was used to assess the extent of quaternization and the degree of quaternization was above 99% based on the disappearance of the signal of CH2–Br proton in P3HTN.
In contrast to P3HT, the UV-vis absorption spectra of P3HTN in dilute solution and thin solid film exhibit absorption maxima (λmax) at 418 nm and 480 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). Thermal and electronic characterization of P3HTN is also conducted. The high decomposition temperature (Td > 250 °C) (Fig. S2) of P3HTN confirms that its thermal stability is appropriate for integration into OPVs. Lastly, to arrive at the reduction and oxidation potential values of the water-soluble polymer, cyclic voltammograms (CV) (Fig. S3) are recorded. We have found that the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) levels of the ionic polythiophene are 5.36 and 2.98 eV, significantly different from the pristine P3HT. Therefore, the promising physical properties of the ionic polymer P3HTN render it suitable for interfacial layer applications.

Fig. 2 displays the electronic energy level diagram of the device components, as well as the device structure of the P3HT/PCBM-based solar cell in which the blend film of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) is the active layer of the device. First, we investigate the effect of the P3HTN layer and its thickness on the performance of OPVs without thermal annealing of the active layers. A reference cell containing only Al and cells with a P3HTN buffer layer spin-coated at either 8000, 6000, or 4000 rpm are fabricated. The thicknesses of P3HTN layers spin-coated at various speeds are as follows: 3 nm at 8000 rpm, 5 nm at 6000 rpm, and 8 nm at 4000 rpm. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells with a P3HTN layer are shown in Fig. 3, and detailed information on Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), FF, and PCE is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3, Voc values in all cells with a P3HTN layer are increased by about 150 mV. Devices with Al cathodes show a low Voc owing to the mismatch between the work function of these metals and the LUMO of PCBM. The transport of electrons from the active layer to the metal cathode is not efficient in these devices because of the Schottky-barrier effect caused by the high contact resistance between the high work function cathode and the LUMO of PCBM.

The insertion of the thin P3HTN layer can lower the work function of the cathodes because of an interfacial dipole between the interfacial layers and the cathodes, which is induced between the amine ionic salts. Therefore, at cathodes with an interfacial layer attached, the ohmic contact to the electron being transported from the active layer to the cathode is more favorable. However, using a cathode interlayer with similar electrochemical property, poly[(9,9-bis{3′-[(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium]propyl}-2,7-fluorine)-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-co-(4,7-dithien-2-y)-2,1,3-benzotiadiazole] (PFNBr-DBT15) is not sufficient to change the original Jsc of traditional OPVs based on the same condition that varied only in their respective cathode (Fig. S4). In such case, we tentatively attribute the dependent elevations of short-circuit current to the same main chain interactions between the P3HT donors and the P3HTN buffer layer. The effect of the intermolecular interactions may enhance the contact between the active layer and the Al electrode, and enhance the electron extraction efficiency at the electrode interface.
The effect of the P3HTN interface layer on the interface between the bulk heterojunction active layer and the Al electrode can be directly imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In order to investigate this interface, we remove the Al electrode of the devices without treatments according to ref. 18AFM measurements are then carried out to investigate the underlying surface morphology. The AFM height images are shown the device without the cathode buffer layer Fig. 4A whereas for Fig. 4B the P3HTN is inserted as the interface layer. The surface of P3HT:PCBM is relatively smooth, with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 2.35 nm, while the P3HT:PCBM layer features raised islands connected by a thin network of terraces. And connected features with roughness increase to 4.89 nm, which is beyond the pale of the buffer layer thickness. Therefore, the significant change of the surface roughness suggests sufficiently more strong interaction between the active layer and the Al metal because of the interaction effect induced by the P3HTN layer. These differences can be seen more clearly in the phase images reproduced in Fig. 4C and D. Again, for both samples the surface of the contact area is investigated without annealing to avoid the influence of the heat treatment.
Moreover, we have studied the photoluminescence (PL) of active layer/P3HTN bilayer thin films and compared the results with corresponding data from the pristine active layer and P3HTN. The PL spectrum (Fig. S5) of P3HTN comprises a peak at 590 nm. Addition of a thin P3HTN layer under the P3HT:PCBM layer quenches the PL emission at 640 nm by a factor of approximately 2, and thus the peak maximum of P3HT:PCBM/P3HTN is attributed to the emission of P3HTN film. As established in the early studies in this field, the enhanced quenching of the PL results from the decreasing hole–electron recombination in the BHJ layer, which is in good agreement with the results of the increasing Jsc of the devices. The polythiophene main chain interactions between the P3HT and P3HTN can modify the interfacial contact, resulting in enhancement of the electron extraction from the acceptor phase to the cathode and decreasing hole-electron recombination in the active layer. Besides, in the bilayer the photoluminescence emission of the P3HTN shows almost quenching, which implies the existence of the PCBM/P3HTN heterojunction. When the thickness of the buffer layer increases, FF is obviously reduced. This is because there is a negative effect produced by the inverse heterojunction of PCBM/P3HTN in the device which may deteriorate the PV performance. In principle, exciton dissociation may occur at both P3HT/PCBM and PCBM/P3HTN interface. When the P3HTN layer is thin, the negative effect is limited. But with the increasing thickness of the buffer layer, the negative effect is enhanced and the performance of the PV device is reduced.
The overall cell performance is relatively poor due to the absence of thermal annealing of the active layer. Although annealing-free systems would be more suitable for the realization of flexible and large-area OPVs, at the present time, the annealing procedure seems to be needed for high-efficiency. Because stability in air is critical to the commercialization of polymer electronic devices, discussions concerning the annealing treatment are exposure in air to high temperatures (120 °C). To obtain detailed information about the function of the P3HTN buffer layer in cells after annealing, cells with and without 5 nm P3HTN are compared as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, to consider the replacement of low-work function and highly reactive alkali metal compound LiF, identical devices with LiF/Al as cathodes are fabricated. As demonstrated in Fig. 5A, the cell performances with the heat treatment are all enhanced except for the unchanged Voc. However, the difference in Voc between the reference cell and the cell with the P3HTN is still maintained, irrespective of the heat treatment. Therefore, improved Voc resulting from introduction of the P3HTN interfacial layer can be tightly linked to the reduction of the metal work function. For better studies, we directly investigate the change of the Al work function by using a Kelvin probe, work functions of Al with the P3HTN layer were reduced by 0.146 eV compared with the metal cathodes of Al.
The improvement of the performance (summarized in Table 2), especially the Jsc, is more significant with P3HTN than with LiF. Along with the easy preparation in the single solution process, the P3HTN layer has a great advantage compared to the other buffer layers deposited by dry processes. For the annealing devices, we also test the systems using the ionic polymer PFNBr-DBT15 as the buffer layer, however, no enhancement is observed in device performance although the Voc is found improved. The reason responsible for such significant ionic interfacial layer dependence in Jsc enhancement can support the main chain-dependent interactions between the thiophene polymer donors and the polyelectrolyte at the top of the film. However, the whole device performance is still relatively poor. Particularly, the I–V curves of devices with P3HTN do not show a simple rectifying shape, hence making the FF less good. Given that the limiting issue may be induced by the inverse heterojunction of PCBM/P3HTN in the device, the optimized device performance can be achieved by suppressing the disadvantage of the buffer layer. To reduce the negative effect of the buffer layer, the active layer with a low P3HT/PCBM (1:0.8 w/w) blend ratio is prepared to decrease the chance of the PCBM/P3HTN heterojunction forming. Although the P3HT/PCBM blend ratio, changing from 1:1 to 1:0.8, possess little effect to the devices using the LiF/Al cathode, the increasing FF and photocurrent for the devices with the ionic buffer layer confirm the importance to shield the influence. Disentangling these contributions is important for understanding the functional behavior of the interfacial layer in OPVs and for their future development. To confirm the enhancement of the electron extraction efficiency, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of P3HTN-inserted and LiF/Al cathode cells after thermal treatment are displayed in Fig. 4B. Both spectra have similar shapes but the device with an interfacial dipole layer exhibited an EQE of between 50% and 60% at incident wavelengths of between 350 and 600 nm, which are about 15% higher than those with LiF, and consistent with the improvement in photocurrent in Fig. 5B.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the novel developed ionic polythiophene derivative (P3HTN) can be used as an efficient cathode interfacial layer for low-cost and high-efficiency OPVs based on P3HT and PCBM. For the device without annealing, introduction of the P3HTN layer increases the Voc from 0.44 to 0.60 eV, resulting from a reduction in the metal work function for better electron transport at the active layer/Al interface, whereas it enhances the Jsc from 3.44 to 7.57 mA cm−2, attributed to the intermolecular interactions at active layer/P3HTN interface. The polythiophene dependent interactions between the P3HT and P3HTN can modify the interfacial contact, resulting in enhancement of the electron extraction and decreasing hole–electron recombination. Furthermore, the overall photovoltaic characteristics of the cell with P3HTN even after annealing in air are comparable to those of cells with LiF. The remarkable stability in air indicates that the P3HTN shows the potential as a practical replacement for LiF. The organic-based interfacial layer fabricated using a simple solution process will advance the realization of low-cost and high-efficiency OPVs.
