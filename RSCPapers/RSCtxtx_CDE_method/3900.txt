We report a comparative study on the thermal- and microwave-assisted Stille-coupling polymerization of a benzodithiophene-based donor–acceptor polymer (PTB7). For this study, we synthesized PTB7 polymers through Stille-coupling polymerization under microwave conditions (M-PTB7, Mn = 75 kg mol−1, and D = 2.2) as well as thermal conditions (T-PTB7, Mn = 31 kg mol−1, D = 2.1). Although the microwave-assisted method increases the molecular weight of PTB7 in a short time, the power conversion efficiency of M-PTB7 (2.8%) is lower than that of T-PTB7 (7.8%). The microwave-assisted method was found to generate more structural defects from homo-coupling side reactions, resulting in a decrease in JSC and FF values for M-PTB7. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling the generation of homocoupled units during the synthesis of PTB7 polymers for high-performance PSCs.

The design and synthesis of donor–acceptor (D–A) type alternating conducting polymers have received much attention because of their use as photoactive and hole-transporting materials in polymer solar cells (PSCs), polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs), and perovskite solar cells resulting from the easy manipulation of their electronic properties. Most of these D–A polymers were synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Stille or Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization under thermal conditions. In general, in order to improve the performances of PSCs and PFETs, polymers with higher molecular weight are demanded to enhance the hole mobility by improving the interconnectivity among polymer chains.

One way to obtain such high molecular weight polymers is the microwave-assisted Stille cross-coupling polymerization pioneered by Scherf et al., who found that the microwave-assisted method could increase the molecular weight without changing the polydispersity (D). In addition, this method requires a much shorter reaction time and gives a higher conversion yield than the conventional thermal method. Furthermore, it has been shown that the microwave-assisted method could successfully be used for Suzuki, Stille, Heck, or Yamamoto polymerization. Therefore, a variety of D–A polymers have been recently synthesized using microwave-assisted Stille cross-coupling polymerization. For instance, Bazan, Heeney, McCulloch, and Takimiya independently synthesized D–A polymers containing various building blocks. We have also reported the synthesis of various D–A conducting polymers involving 3,6-carbazole, 2,7-carbazole, diketopyrrolopyrrole, benzodithiophene (BDT), and thienopyrrolodione moieties using microwave-assisted cross-coupling polymerization.
A recent study on PTB7, a well-known and photoactive BDT-based donor–acceptor polymer, showed that photovoltaic performance varies depending on the number-average molecular weight (Mn) or D. Cao et al. reported that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was increased from 5.4% to 8.5% when increasing the Mn from 21 kg mol−1 (D = 1.85) to 128 kg mol−1 (D = 1.12). Lu et al. demonstrated that the PCE drops from 7.5% to 2.5% because of homo-coupled side reactions that cause structural defects in PTB7 (ref. 30) when D increases from 2.1 (Mn = 47.6 kg mol−1) to 4.3 (Mn = 24 kg mol−1). We suggest that a microwave-assisted polymerization method could be used to synthesize PTB7 with a high Mn and narrow D. To date, the difference between thermal- and microwave-assisted Stille polymerization methods on PTB7 has not been investigated.
Here, we report a comparative study on thermal- and microwave-assisted Stille cross-coupling polymerization of BDT and fluorinated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (FTT) for the synthesis of PTB7 polymers (Scheme 1). The microwave-assisted method accelerates unexpected homocoupled structural units (BDT–BDT and FTT–FTT) via aryl-for-aryl exchange between [PdRXL2] complexes during palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling polymerization (Scheme S1), which act as charge-trapping sites (CTSs) in PSCs comprising a blend of M-PTB7 and PC70BM.

Polymerization under microwave conditions: ditin monomer (BDT, 200 mg, 0.259 mmol) and dibromo monomer (FTT, 122.0 mg, 0.259 mmol) are weighed into a microwave reactor vessel together with the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst (9 mg, 0.008 mmol, 0.03 eq.) under an inert atmosphere and toluene/DMF (4 mL/1 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C and stirred under microwave conditions for 5 min. Again, the reaction mixture was heated to 120 °C for 5 min, 140 °C for 5 min and 160 °C for 30 min (M-PTB7(32k)) as well as for 60 min (M-PTB7(75k)). End-capping reagents such as 2-bromothiophene and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene were (0.1 mL of each) added to the reaction mixture and further stirred at 170 °C for 30 min to complete the end-capping reaction. After being cooled to room temperature, the polymer solution was precipitated in methanol. The crude polymer was collected by filtration and purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane, and chloroform in succession. The chloroform portion was concentrated and precipitated in methanol, collected, and dried in a vacuum. 1H-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis of M-PTB7(32k) and M-PTB7(75k) are listed as:

Four batches of PTB7 were polymerized using microwave reactors at different reaction times (30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h) at 110 °C, and their number-average molecular weights (Mn) were 3.6, 13.1, 28.5, and 22.1 kg mol−1, respectively. We could not obtain PTB7 with an Mn over 30 kg mol−1 at 110 °C by increasing the reaction time. When the reaction temperature was increased to 160 °C for 30 min or 1 h, higher-MnPTB7 polymers were obtained (Mn = 32 kg mol−1 and 75 kg mol−1, respectively, denoted as M-PTB7(32k) and M-PTB7(75k) in Fig. S1 and Table 1). This polymerization result indicated that the reaction temperature in the microwave-assisted method is an important factor in increasing the Mn of PTB7 in a short time. In addition, we prepared PTB7 (T-PTB7(31k), Mn = 31 kg mol−1 in Fig. S1 and Table 1) under conventional thermal conditions at 110 °C for 16 h. Furthermore, we regulated the D of the resulting three polymers by column chromatography to minimize the effects of D on the photovoltaic performance. The physical and chemical properties of T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7 polymers (M-PTB7(32k) and M-PTB7(75k)) are summarized in Table 1. Thermo-gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed, respectively, that all resulting PTB7 polymers showed good thermal stability (Fig. S2) and were amorphous in nature as they did not show any distinct phase transition peaks over the range of 350 °C (Fig. S3 and Table 1).

To identify the molecular structures of all the PTB7 polymers, nuclear molecular resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed (refer to the Experimental section in the ESI). The optical properties of all the PTB7 polymers are shown in (Fig. 1a) and the overall results are summarized in Table 1. The absorption behavior of M-PTB7(32k) and T-PTB7(31k) was almost identical; however, the maximum absorption peak intensity of M-PTB7(32k) was slightly decreased in the region of 600–700 nm and the low-energy shoulder peak was also slightly red-shifted in the region of 740–840 nm. This tendency was most pronounced in M-PTB7(75k), and the absorption behavior was broadened compared with those of T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7(32k). This behavior could be ascribed to the increased content of homo-coupled units such as BDT–BDT and FTT–FTT, and their absorption behavior coincided with the previous results. Although T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7(32k) showed a nearly similar shape in their absorption spectra, they exhibited obvious differences in their emission spectra, and M-PTB7(75k) showed a remarkable difference in its emission spectrum (Fig. 1b). This result indicates that the homo-coupled units induced self-quenching among M-PTB7 polymer chains.
We applied both PTB7 polymers as donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC70BM (1:1.5 w/w)/MoO3/Ag to investigate the device performance of the resulting PTB7 polymers. The area of the device was 0.04 mm2. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 1c and S6, respectively. The overall device parameters are summarized in Table 2. For instance, T-PTB7(31k) showed the highest PCE of 7.8% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.20 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.5%. In contrast, M-PTB7 polymers delivered reduced PCEs of 6.1% (M-PTB7(32k)) and 2.8% (M-PTB7(75k)) along with decreased VOC values of 0.73 and 0.65 V, reduced JSC values of 13.0 and 8.70 mA cm−2, and lowered FF values of 63.5% and 49.2%, respectively. The significant decrease in the JSC and FF values of M-PTB7 polymers occurred due to unexpected CTSs (Fig. 1b). In addition, the decreased VOC values of M-PTB7 polymers were in good agreement with the apparent trend in high-lying HOMO energy levels of M-PTB7 polymers (Fig. S4 and Table 1). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7 polymer solar cells was measured to distinguish between the dramatic changes in the solar cell parameters. Fig. 1d shows the EQE spectra of T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7 polymers. M-PTB7 polymers exhibited a significantly decreased EQE value from 63.7% to 43.0% at the maximum wavelength of 620 nm compared with T-PTB7(31k) (EQE: 75.4% at 670 nm). This tendency was similar to the apparent trend in the optical properties of pristine M-PTB7 polymers and T-PTB7(31k) (Fig. 1b).

We used Raman spectroscopy to identify the existence of homo-coupled units in Raman vibrational modes of T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7 polymers. Fig. 2a shows the molecular structure of PTB7. T-PTB7(31k) (Fig. 2d) possessed a distinct Raman spectrum with four main peaks, which were similar to the Raman vibrational modes of PTB7 already demonstrated by Kim et al. Although T-PTB7(31k) and M-PTB7(32k) exhibited nearly similar shapes in their CC and CO stretching vibrational modes, they showed a small difference in their Raman vibrational modes (Fig. S5). However, M-PTB7(75k) exhibited a remarkable difference in the Raman vibrational modes in terms of a decreased intensity of Peak 1 with vibrational modes shifted ∼4 cm−1 (Fig. 2d), and an increased intensity of Peak 2 with vibrational modes shifted ∼5 cm−1 to higher wavenumbers in M-PTB7(75k) (refer to the ESI for a detailed description).
From these results, we speculated that the existence of homo-coupled units (Fig. 2b and c) in the main chain of M-PTB7(75k) resulted in a remarkable change in the Raman peak intensities and induced polymer aggregation that shifted them to higher wavenumbers compared with M-PTB7(32k) and T-PTB7(31k). These effects originated from decreased intra- and intermolecular interactions and decreased conjugation lengths in M-PTB7(75k) thin films.
To investigate the crystalline nature and molecular orientation of all neat PTB7 polymers and their blend films, one-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (1D-GIXRD) measurements were performed (Fig. 3), and the crystallographic parameters are provided in Table S2. All resulting PTB7 polymers exhibited two distinctive diffraction patterns with a “face-on” orientation. However, M-PTB7(32k) and M-PTB7(75k) films exhibited a lower intensity of the lamellar (100) peak with an increased d-spacing of 2.01 and 2.11 nm, respectively, in the qxy-axis compared with those of the T-PTB7(31k) film (d-spacing of 1.95 nm) (Fig. 3a). In the qz-axis, the intensity of the (010) diffraction peaks decreased with an identical π–π stacking distance of ∼0.39 nm as the molecular weight of M-PTB7 polymers increased (Fig. 3a). This result indicates that homo-coupled units in M-PTB7 polymers induced a lower crystallinity. The diffraction pattern of the M-PTB7(75k):PC70BM film showed a higher lamellar (100) peak with an increased d-spacing of 1.98 nm (Fig. 3c) compared with those of M-PTB7(32k):PC70BM (d = 1.92 nm) and T-PTB7(31k):PC70BM films (d = 1.72 nm).
This result suggested that homo-coupled units in the M-PTB7(75k) polymer induced the aggregation of polymers resulting in phase separation, as strongly supported by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the M-PTB7(75k):PC70BM film (Fig. S6c and f). Although the resulting polymer blend films have similar π–π stacking distances of 0.39 nm at the high-q region, the intensity of the (010) diffraction peaks of M-PTB7 polymer blend films was decreased compared with that of the T-PTB7(31k) blend film on the qz-axis (Fig. 3d), indicating that homo-coupled units disturbed the π–π stacking of M-PTB7 polymer backbones. The morphology analysis using AFM revealed that M-PTB7(32k):PC70BM and M-PTB7(75k):PC70BM film images showed a coarser phase separation than that of the T-PTB7(31k) blend film (Fig. S6), suggesting that the homo-coupled units in M-PTB7 polymers induced immiscibility with PC70BM and thus formed phase separation.
To provide additional evidence for our findings, we performed two model reactions under microwave-assisted and thermal conditions, similar to those previously reported by Yu et al. As shown in Scheme 2, a BDT compound (TIPS–BDT–SnMe3) was synthesized and selected to react with the FTT monomer under both conditions. In addition to the usual Stille cross-coupled product TIPS–BDT–FTT–BDT–TIPS (model compound A), we identified fewer by-products under both conditions, formed via homo-coupling of the two reactants, such as TIPS–BDT–FTT–FTT–BDT–TIPS (model compound B) and TIPS–BDT–BDT–TIPS (model compound C). The molecular structures of all model compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR analysis (refer to the ESI) and mass spectroscopy analysis (MALDI-TOF, Fig. S7 and S8). In addition, the UV-vis absorption properties of the model compounds (B and C, Fig. S9) were strongly supported by the absorption behavior of the signature of homo-coupled units in the M-PTB7 polymers (Fig. 1a).
The overall results of both model reactions, as depicted in Scheme 2, strongly supported by our findings, showed the existence of homo-coupled units such as BDT–BDT and FTT–FTT units in the main chain of M-PTB7 polymers. In our case, the microwave-assisted conditions generated a total amount of homo-coupled units of approximately 21.5%, which was relatively high compared with that of the thermal-assisted conditions (11.2%) as well as that previously reported by Yu et al. (13%).

In summary, we synthesized three PTB7 polymers through Stille-coupling polymerization under microwave conditions (M-PTB7(32k) and M-PTB7(75k)) as well as thermal conditions (T-PTB7(31k)) for a comparative study. The microwave-assisted polymerization is a powerful method to increase the Mn of PTB7 without broadening D in a short time. However, M-PTB7(32k) exhibited a lower PCE of 6.1% compared with that of T-PTB7(31k) (7.8%). Interestingly, the higher molecular weight of M-PTB7(75k) under microwave-assisted conditions resulted in a significant reduction in the device performance (PCE of 2.8%). The microwave-assisted polymerization method accelerated the formation of homo-coupled units (BDT–FTT–FTT and BDT–BDT) that act as CTSs in PSCs comprising a blend of M-PTB7 and fullerenes (PC70BM), which in turn resulted in a decrease in JSC and FF values for M-PTB7. The increased abundance of these homo-coupled units under the microwave-assisted conditions was demonstrated by various optical spectroscopy methods and the model reaction study.
