A new donor–acceptor-type all-conjugated block copolymer (BCP), P(NDI-DBDT)-block-P(NDI-2T), is synthesized through the coupling of a naphthalene diimide (NDI)-bithiophene (2T) segment-based polymer (P1) and an NDI-dithienylbenzodithiophene (DBDT) segment-based polymer (P2). P1 has a prevailing backbone for NDI-based polymer acceptors, while P2 is modified to contain a p-type DBDT moiety to facilitate miscibility with the DBDT-based polymer donors. When adding 1 wt% BCP (the optimized blending amount) into the PBDB-T:N2200 blend that possesses similar constituent units to the BCP, the derived device can deliver an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.07%, outperforming the control device (with a PCE of 5.71%). This improvement is found to arise from the more optimized bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology as a result of facilitated intermixing between the photoactive components. This leads to reduced charge recombination and potential loss for the device. Moreover, the more optimized BHJ morphology endows the device with improved thermal robustness. It demonstrates longer T80 lifetimes when stored under constant thermal conditions at high temperatures. Consequently, the device lifetime can be extended to ∼2 years when stored under inert conditions at 50 °C. These results demonstrate that the rationally designed all-conjugated BCP can effectively modulate the BHJ morphology of an all-polymer blend to simultaneously enhance its photovoltaic performance and stability.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been of great interest as a clean and sustainable energy source due to their high compatibility with low-cost printing technology for the manufacture of flexible devices. In recent years, through the successful exploitation of efficient small-molecule acceptors (SMAs), the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs has reached 18%. Such a great enhancement is attributed to the complementary light absorption of the small-bandgap SMAs and their good electron-transport capabilities.

Driven by the success of SMA-based OPVs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of polymer donors and polymer acceptors have drawn increasing research attention in recent years because of their better thermal stability, stretchability, and mechanical durability. However, owing to the lack of prominent polymer acceptors, current PCEs of all-PSCs still lag behind those of SMA-based PSCs. So far, the exploited polymer acceptors have mainly been built using electron-withdrawing groups based on naphthalene diimide (NDI), perylene diimide (PDI), or B ← N-bridged bipyridine units, and their derived devices have realized high PCEs of >11%. Among them, the NDI derivatives have received the most attention due to their ease of synthesis and lower production costs. Nonetheless, this class of material suffers from several intrinsic drawbacks, such as an intense aggregation tendency and a low light-harvesting capability. Very recently, a new class of polymer acceptors was developed and was prepared mainly via the polymerization of state-of-the-art π-conjugated SMAs (referred to as PSMAs). The PSMAs generally show intense light absorption in the near-infrared region and have enabled the derived all-PSCs to reach PCEs of 15%. However, despite the demonstrated high PCEs, the synthesis of these PSMAs is quite sophisticated and the limited chemical and photochemical stability of the monomeric SMAs limits their further applications.
Besides designing new polymer acceptors, adding a third component is another common way to optimize the PCEs of all-PSCs (see Table S1, ESI). Among the diverse designs for ternary BHJ blends reported so far, we are particularly interested in harnessing a compatibilizer as the third component. Different from the general ternary strategy that focuses on the complementary light absorption of a third photoactive component, the compatibilizer approach focuses on optimization of the BHJ morphology of the photoactive blend. It has been proven to effectively enhance the intermixing between the constituent photoactive components to optimize the BHJ morphology. For example, Chen et al. demonstrated the compatibilizer effect for all-PSCs using a conjugated polymer that can improve the PCE of the device to >9%. We recently synthesized a series of donor–acceptor (D–A)-type P3HT-based block copolymers (BCPs) and demonstrated their compatibilizer functions for SMA-based OPVs. On this basis, we are interested in exploring the compatibilizer effect of BCPs for all-PSCs. On the one hand, this has rarely been investigated and the relevant studies reported only inferior PCEs; on the other hand, the use of BCP as the third component preserves the all-polymer feature of the all-PSCs.
In this work, we synthesized a new D–A-type all-conjugated BCP, P(NDI-DBDT)-block-P(NDI-2T), where the constituent polymer segments are P(NDI-DBDT) (named P2) and P(NDI-2T) (named P1) (Fig. 1). P1, consisting of an NDI-bithiophene (2T) unit, was herein selected due to its practicality in benchmark studies. P2 is designed to comprise an NDI-dithienylbenzodithiophene (DBDT) unit, where the incorporated DBDT unit is intended to enhance the miscibility with the DBDT-based polymer donors. To test its compatibilizer function, we added 1 wt% BCP (the optimized blending amount) into an all-polymer blend of PBDB-T:N2200 that possesses similar constituent units to the synthesized BCP. The ternary device demonstrated an improved PCE of 7.07%, surpassing the performance (5.71%) of the control device. This is the first example of an all-PSC using a BCP-based compatibilizer to achieve a PCE of >7%. We show that our designed all-conjugated D-–A BCP indeed promotes the BHJ morphology through facilitating intermixing between PBDB-T and N2200. The 1% BCP-based device also exhibited a prolonged thermal T80 lifetime under constant thermal conditions at high temperatures compared with the control device, and the estimated lifetime at 50 °C can be extended to ∼2 years when stored under inert conditions.

So far, most of the BCPs used as compatibilizers have been built using a donor unit that consists of a P3HT segment because of its easily controlled synthetic method based on the chain-growth catalyst-transfer polymerization. It will be more ideal to develop new D–A BCPs by replacing the P3HT segment with more advanced 2D conjugated segments because of their superior semiconducting properties. For instance, DBDT derivatives have recently been used to synthesize all-conjugated D–A BCPs, which demonstrated great potential for OPV applications. In this regard, we herein synthesized an all-conjugated D–A BCP consisting of NDI-DBDT and NDI-2T units via one-pot synthesis by exploiting the Pd catalyst-transfer non-stoichiometric Stille coupling polycondensation (Fig. 1a). The advantage of this methodology may be in providing guaranteed efficient activation of the chain-end group (–Ar–PdII–Br) of the first block (P1) with complete consumption of the first donor monomer (D1-Sn2) due to the presence of a 2-fold excess of NDI-based dibromo monomer (A-Br2) after the first shot of the starting materials. Moreover, only the BDBT donor monomer (D2-Sn2) will need to be added at the second shot for the crossover/propagation reactions, which should minimize contamination of the polymerization medium. As a result, well-defined all-conjugated block copolymers with fewer monomer sequential defects will be obtained. Based on this method, a 2-fold excess of the acceptor NDI-based dibromo-monomer (A-Br2) can be added to the distannylated bithiophene-based donor monomer (D1-Sn2) to synthesize the first block. This endows the synthesized first block with an adequate number-average molecular weight (Mn = 14100, Đ = Mw/Mn = 1.52) to coexist with one equivalent of unreacted A-Br2. Meanwhile, the chain end of the first block remains active enough for the in situ extension of the polymer chains after adding one equivalent of distannylated DBD-T-based monomer (D2-Sn2) as the second donor monomer in the same batch. This results in the consumption of residual A-Br2, as evidenced from the peak shift to a higher molecular weight region in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) UV traces after the chain extension (Fig. 1b). As a result, the target poly(D1-A)-block-poly(D2-A) BCP, P(NDI-DBDT)-block-P(NDI-2T), can be obtained (abbreviated as BCP hereafter) (Fig. 1a). For comparison, two homopolymers, P(NDI-2T) and P(NDI-DBDT), were also prepared based on conventional Stille coupling polycondensation and named P1 and P2, respectively.

Characterizations of the SEC and 1H NMR spectra of P1, P2, and BCP are presented in Fig. S1–S3 (ESI). All the results clearly verified the successful syntheses of these targeted polymers. The Mn and Mw/Mn values of BCP were estimated to be 27200 and 2.53 (Fig. 1b), and the composition of P1 and P2 in BCP were 59 and 41 wt%, respectively, as determined via the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S3, ESI). Their thermal properties were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI). All of these polymers exhibited a high 5 wt% weight loss temperature (Td) of >440 °C along with phase-transition behavior at >240 °C. Relevant information for each polymer is summarized in Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI).

Fig. 1c shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of P1, P2, and BCP. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) for P1, BCP, and P2 were 544, 602, and 620 nm and their corresponding optical band gaps (Eoptg) calculated from the absorption onset were 2.28, 2.06, and 2.00 eV, respectively. Their redox behavior and energy levels were characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S6, ESI). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were estimated from the onset oxidation potential of the polymer films using the equation EHOMO = −(Eoxonset + 4.36) eV, and the values for P1, BCP, and P2 were −6.08, −5.87, and −5.84 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, inferred from their corresponding Eoptgvalues, for P1, BCP, and P2 were −3.80, −3.81, and −3.84 eV, respectively. Fig. 1d illustrates the energy-level diagram for all of these polymers.

The morphology of the films of P1, P2, and BCP probed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is presented in Fig. 2a. All of these polymer films exhibited a regular nano-grain morphology and the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values for P1, P2, and BCP were 6.95, 2.90, and 2.23 nm, respectively. P1 possessed the most intense chain aggregation compared with the other two polymers. This could be attributed to the order structure of the NDI-2T backbone. On the contrary, P2 possessed a homogeneous morphology. This could be due to the alternating NDI-DBDT backbone that imposes a certain steric hindrance to retard chain aggregation. As shown, BCP presented a smooth, less phase-segregating surface. This could result from the irregular packing of the conjugated block backbones of NDI-2T and NDI-DBDT.

To gain more insight into the crystallinity, molecular packing, and orientation of the films, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of these polymer films are presented in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) 1D-line-cutting profiles are displayed in Fig. S7 (ESI). As shown, BCP and P2 displayed order (n00) diffraction peaks along the qz-axis in the OOP direction, while P1 exhibited diffraction peaks in the IP direction. This result indicates that both BCP and P2, which comprise an NDI-DBDT backbone, have a preferred edge-on orientation, whereas P1, which has an NDI-2T backbone, has a preferred face-on orientation. Such disparate chain orientation can be attributed to the semi-2D conjugated DBDT unit that is conducive to a weak order but edge-on stacking.
The crystallographic parameters of each film calculated using the Bragg diffraction equation are summarized in Table S3 (ESI). The lamellar spacing (dlam) values for the P1, P2, and BCP films were 26.7, 24.0 and 22.5 Å, and the in-plane FWHM values for P1, P2, BCP are 0.013, 0.017, and 0.023 Å−1, respectively. The long alkyl side chains apparently contribute to a higher dlam value for P1 than P2 and BCP. In addition, the narrow in-plane FWHM value for P1 represents intermittent interdigitating between the lamellar stacks and high crystallinity. Notably, BCP had a lower dlam value associated with a lower crystallinity. Again, this is attributed to the irregular stacking of the conjugated block backbones of NDI-2T and NDI-DBDT.
Bottom-gate/top-contact (BG/TC) field-effect transistors (FETs) based on these polymers were then fabricated to investigate their structure–mobility relationship. Details of the device fabrication are described in the Experimental section. Fig. 2c and Fig. S8 (ESI), respectively, display the transfer and output characteristics of the fabricated devices. Relevant performance parameters, including the electron mobility (μe), threshold voltage (Vth), and on–off current ratio (Ion/Ioff), are summarized in Table S3 (ESI). These polymers exhibited typical n-type electron-transporting characteristics, and the estimated maximum μe values for P1, P2, and BCP were 2.9 × 10−1, 8.8 × 10−4, and 1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Owing to the more intense chain stacking and higher crystallinity, P1 outperformed the other two polymers. The inferior μe values of P2 and BCP are clearly correlated with the segregated backbone and the irregular chain stacking induced by the NDI-DBDT unit. Note that BCP gave rise to phase-segregating behavior but preserved sufficient charge transport in the NDI-2T-rich domain. Consequently, the μe value of BCP exceeded the value of P2.

So far, the compatibilizer effect has mostly been reported for SMA-based BHJ OPVs, and relevant investigations for all-PSCs are still rare. Based on the above results and considering its unique all-conjugated feature comprising D and A units, we then explored its compatibilizer effect in an all-polymer BHJ system. Herein, a binary all-polymer PBDB-T:N2200 blend was selected as the reference system because it possessed similar constituent units to our BCP, which can better reflect the compatibilizer effect. The OPV devices adopted an inverted structure, and details of the device fabrication are described in the Experimental section.


Fig. 3a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the fabricated devices measured under AM 1.5G illumination. The relevant photovoltaic parameters, including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), are summarized in Table 2. The control binary BHJ device exhibited the worst PCE (PCE, 5.71%; Voc, 0.866 V; Jsc, 10.29 mA cm−2; FF, 64.1), while the 1% BCP-based device (with 1 wt% addition of BCP relative to N2200) delivered the highest PCE (PCE, 7.07%; Voc, 0.884 V; Jsc, 11.88 mA cm−2; FF, 67.3) among the fabricated devices. The tolerance of BCP in the ternary all-polymer BHJ blend is more than 1 wt% (relative to N2200). Although the 3% BCP-based device yielded an inferior PCE (PCE, 6.20%; Voc, 0.882 V; Jsc, 10.44 mA cm−2; FF, 67.3) compared with that of the 1% BCP device, its performance is superior to the performance of the 0.5% BCP-based device (PCE, 5.94%; Voc, 0.871 V; Jsc, 10.40 mA cm−2; FF, 65.6). Notably, all of the BCP-incorporated devices delivered a larger Voc (0.871–0.884 V) than that (0.866 V) of the control device. These results clearly reveal the compatibilizer function of the BCP. For comparison, we also evaluated the compatibilizer effect of P1 and P2. The resultant J–V curves are presented in Fig. S9 (ESI), and the relevant results are summarized in Table S4 (ESI). As shown, the 1% P1-based device displayed an inferior PCE (PCE, 5.97%; Voc, 0.870 V; Jsc, 10.56 mA cm−2; FF, 65.0) compared with the 1% BCP-based device. Nevertheless, the device performance was increased by increasing the blending amount of P1. The 10% P1-based device showed a champion PCE of 6.84% (Voc, 0.883 V; Jsc, 11.65 mA cm−2, FF: 66.5). A similar trend was observed for P2. However, compared with the 10% P1-based device, the 10% P2-based device delivered a lower PCE of 6.60% (Voc, 0.881 V; Jsc, 11.20 mA cm−2; FF, 66.9). These results indicate that both P1 and P2 also show compatibilizer effects but require a higher blending ratio to reach the optimum condition. Such a difference should be related to the different compatibility between them (P1, P2, and BCP) and the binary BHJ blend that will be discussed later.

Fig. 3b presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for these devices. All of the BCP-incorporated devices exhibited a decreased photoresponse in the wavelength region of 300 nm to 450 nm. This can be attributed to the decreased crystallinity of N2200 in the BHJ blends. In addition, all of the BCP-incorporated devices exhibited an enhanced photoresponse in the region of 450–650 nm. Owing to the similar light-absorption profile between BCP and N2200 and the small blending amount of BCP, the increased photocurrent contributed from the complementary absorption between them should be of less significance. We speculate that the main function of the BCP compatibilizer still lies in optimizing the BHJ morphology, and this will be discussed later.

Fig. 3c displays the dark currents of these devices. The BCP-incorporated devices exhibited a reduced leak current compared with the control device, especially for the 1% BCP device. This result indicates that the nanoscale phase separation of the BHJ layer is fine-tuned to better reduce charge recombination in the device. The charge-recombination behavior of these devices was subsequently explored. Fig. 3d depicts the plot of the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) of the device. Jph was calculated from Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD, respectively, represent the current densities measured under AM 1.5G illumination and in the dark. Veff was defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage, while Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied bias. Generally, at a high internal electric field, excitons will be fully dissociated and the charges will be totally swept out, and this means that Jph will approach a saturation value (Jsat) at the high-bias region. Hence, the Jph,max/Jph,sat ratio can represent the charge-collection probability under maximum power output conditions, while the Jph,sc/Jph,sat ratio can signify the exciton-dissociation probability under short-circuit conditions. Hence, the charge-dissociation and -collection probability can be evaluated from the Jph/Jsat ratio under a certain external bias between the short-circuit condition and the maximum power output condition. We then estimated this probability at 0.1 V, and the values for the control, 0.5%-, 1%-, and 3%-BCP devices were 0.42, 0.47, 0.53, and 0.51, respectively. The highest value observed for the 1% BCP-based device indicated its superior charge-dissociation and -collection probability over the control device.
As noted earlier, the addition of BCP effectively increased the Voc of the derived device, which was speculated to result from a more optimized BHJ morphology. To confirm this, the device's response as a function of the illumination intensity (Plight) in the range of 20–100 mW cm−2 was measured and the relationship between Voc and the light intensity was plotted (Fig. 3e). As shown, slopes of 1.62, 1.58, 1.54, and 1.56kBT/q were recorded for the control, 0.5%-, 1%-, and 3%-BCP devices, respectively, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. This result unveils the dominant bimolecular recombination during device operation. The lower slopes observed for the BCP-incorporated devices indicate their lower tendency toward trap-assisted charge recombination. The trap density (Ntrap) of these devices was further analyzed by measuring the I–V response in the SCLC regime. According to the equation VTFL = eNtrapL2/(2εε0), where VTFL is the trap-filled limited voltage, e is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the active layer, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the BHJ layer, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, the VTFL values for the control, 0.5%-, 1%-, and 3%-BCP devices were estimated to be 0.63, 0.59, 0.56, and 0.57 V, respectively, associated with respective Ntrap values of 1.72 × 1016, 1.62 × 1016, 1.53 × 1016, and 1.56 × 1016 cm−3 (Fig. 3f). These results corroborate the decreased trap density in the BCP-incorporated devices. This is an important indication for the improved BHJ morphology.

We have speculated that the all-conjugated D–A BCP promotes the morphology of the binary (PBDB-T:N2200) BHJ blend. To probe this, we first measured the miscibility between the binary blend and the compatibilizers (P1, BCP, and P2) by calculating the surface tension (γ) and the interaction parameter (χ). The γ value of the polymer film was determined using contact angle goniometry coupled with the Wu model, and distilled H2O and glycerol were herein used as the polar and non-polar probing liquids. Relevant data are summarized in Table S5 (ESI). As seen, the γ values for the neat P1, BCP, P2, and binary BHJ films were calculated to be 36.41, 27.92, 38.26, and 40.92 mN m−1, respectively. We further estimate the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) between the binary blend and the compatibilizers based upon the surface tension data using the following equation:
where
K is a constant, γbinary BHJ is the surface tension of the binary BHJ blend, and γcompatibilizer is the surface tension of P1, BCP, and P2. As can be observed, the χ value for BCP is the smallest (χ = 0.045 K) among the studied compatibilizers. This indicates the superior miscibility between the binary blend and BCP. P2 possessed the highest χ value of 1.239 K, suggesting its lowest miscibility with the binary blend. Delightfully, the all-conjugated D–A BCP facilitates the morphology of the binary blend, which means enhanced intermixing between the photoactive components. Thus, we next focus on studying the BHJ morphology of the ternary blend and examining its impact on the thermal stability of the device.

The thermal stability of the control and top-performing 1% BCP devices was examined by tracking the time when the device's performance dropped to 80% of its initial value (defined as the T80 lifetime). To exclude the humidity influence, testing of the device's thermal stability was conducted in a glove box and the thermal stress was fixed at 85 °C. As depicted in Fig. 4a, 1% BCP-based device exhibited a superior thermal robustness over the control device. It displayed a high T80 lifetime of 940 h, surpassing the value (240 h) of the control device. Fig. 4b illustrates the detailed variations of the photovoltaic parameters of each device as a function of the thermal stress time. All of the parameters, including Voc, Jsc, and FF, for both devices showed a clear drop but with different decline rates. Notably, FF exhibited the most significant drop after thermal stress, being a major indicator for the performance degradation.
To further examine the charge-recombination behavior of the device after thermal aging, Voc and Jsc values of the thermally aged devices under different Plight conditions were recorded and compared with the values of the corresponding pristine devices. As portrayed in Fig. 4c, the slope (in the Voc–Plight plot) for the control device was largely changed from 1.62 to 1.78kBT/q after thermal aging, whereas, the 1% BCP-based devices showed comparable slopes (1.54–1.56kBT/q) before and after thermal aging. Similar trends were also observed in the Jsc–Plight plots. The 1% BCP-based devices exhibited comparable α values (0.9983–0.9996) before and after thermal aging, different from the control device that showed a clearly decreased α value after thermal aging. Note that the α value approaching 1 suggests suppressed bimolecular recombination in the device. This result partly confirms the preservation of a high FF for the thermally aged 1% BCP-based device.
Such a discrepancy in the device's thermal stability should correlate with the different thermal stabilities of these two BHJ layers, where different degrees of thermally induced micro-phase separation occurred after thermal aging. We first characterized the surface morphology of these two BHJ films using AFM. As presented in Fig. 5a, the surface RMS roughness values for the fresh binary film and the 1% BCP ternary film were 1.86 and 1.59 nm, respectively. The smaller surface roughness of the 1% BCP ternary film over the binary film plausibly suggested that the incorporated BCP promoted miscibility between the constituent components. After thermal aging, the RMS value for the control binary film was increased to 2.10 nm, associated with a change of phase aggregation. However, the value for the 1% BCP ternary film remained almost the same and its surface texture displayed only a slight change, revealing a superior thermodynamic nature.
We further characterized the morphological changes of these BHJ films before and after thermal aging using GIWAXS. Fig. 5b depicts the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the fresh and thermally aged BHJ films, and their extracted 1D profile in the OOP direction is illustrated in Fig. 5c. The relevant crystallographic parameters of these BHJ films determined from their full width at half-maximum (FWHM) are portrayed in Fig. 5d and are summarized in Table S6 (ESI). As presented, the dlam values for the fresh control binary blend and the 1% BCP ternary blend were 20.40, and 19.94 Å. Their respective out-of-plane FWHM values were 0.064 and 0.075 Å−1, representing crystalline sizes of 8.83 and 7.54 nm, respectively. This result again shows that BCP improves the intermixing between PBDB-T and N2200 in the derived ternary BHJ blend. Although both films exhibited a negligible change in d-spacing after thermal aging, their crystalline sizes exhibited a large change and difference. The crystalline size for the 1% BCP ternary blend displayed a subtle change, whereas the crystalline size for the control binary blend was increased to 11.3 nm, indicating the occurrence of phase aggregation. Such a discrepancy should result from the facilitated intermixing between the constituent components induced by the BCP, and this endows the derived blend with a more thermally stable morphology.
Finally, we measured the lifetime of the 1% BCP device under various aging temperatures (65, 85, and 95 °C) in a glove box and estimated its long-term stability at room temperature based on the Arrhenius relationship. It is one of the most popular methods to predict the lifespan of materials. In brief, the lifetime prediction is extrapolated from accelerated aging data at promoted temperatures. Arrhenius extrapolation presumes that the degradation process is controlled by a degradation rate kd that is proportional to exp(−Ea/kBT), where Ea is the activation energy of a failure condition, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. When the lifetime at a certain temperature of T to reach a certain degree of degradation (T%,T) is theoretically proportional to the reciprocal of degradation rate, the Arrhenius relationship can be written in the form of . As illustrated in Fig. 4d, the lifetime of the 1% BCP device at 25 °C (298 K) and 50 °C (323 K) was estimated at ∼15 and 2 years, respectively, revealing an impressive long-term stability. This result demonstrates the effective compatibilizer function of our designed all-conjugated BCP, which modulates the intermixing between the active components to simultaneously result in enhanced performance and long-term stability.

We synthesized a distinct D–A all-conjugated BCP, P(NDI-DBDT)-block-P(NDI-2T), through the coupling of an NDI-2T segment-based polymer [P1, P(NDI-2T)] with an NDI-DBDT segment-based polymer [P2, P(NDI-DBDT)], and examined its compatibilizer function in an all-polymer BHJ system. P1 was herein selected due to its practicality in benchmark studies, and P2 is a modified version of P1 that incorporates a p-type DBDT moiety to facilitate its miscibility with the DBDT-based polymer donors. When adding 1 wt% BCP into an all-polymer blend of PBDB-T:N2200 that possesses similar constituent units to the BCP, the derived device demonstrated an improved PCE of 7.07%, outperforming the control device with a PCE of 5.71%. This enhancement is attributed to the more optimized BHJ morphology due to improved intermixing between the photoactive components. It leads to reduced charge recombination and potential loss for the device. The more ideal BHJ morphology also enhanced its overall thermal robustness. The top-performing 1% BCP device exhibited a prolonged T80 lifetime under constant thermal conditions at high temperatures compared with the control device, and the estimated lifetime at 50 °C can be extended to ∼2 years when stored under inert conditions. Our results clearly reveal the compatibilizer effect of our rationally designed all-conjugated BCP.


4,9-Dibromo-2,7-bis(2-decyl-1-tetradecyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8 (2H,7H)-tetraone (A-Br2) was synthesized as described elsewhere. Distannylated monomer 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (D1-Sn2), 4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]-2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (D2-Sn2), and all other regents were purchased from Aldrich, Japan, Tokyo Chemical Industry, FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals or 1-Material (Canada), and were used without further purification. Polymer donor (PBDB-T) and polymer acceptor (N2200) were purchased from 1-Material (Canada) and used without further purification.


A-Br2 (0.251 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and D1-Sn2 (0.126 mmol, 1.0 eq.) were placed in a 50 mL two-necked flask purged with N2 gas. After dissolving them in deoxidized toluene (35 mL), N2 bubbling was conducted for 30 min. Pd2(dba)3 (13.7 mg, 0.0150 mmol) and P(o-tolyl)3 (38.0 mg, 0.125 mmol) were added to start the polymerization and the solution was stirred at 110 °C for 1 h. The reaction solution was then sampled for SEC measurement of the first block (Mn = 14100, Mw/Mn = 1.52). From the results of the SEC measurement, the progress of the polymerization and the consumption of D1-Sn2 were confirmed. Next, D2-Sn2 (0.126 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was placed in another two-necked flask purged with N2 gas. After dissolving it in deoxidized toluene (10 mL), N2 bubbling was conducted for 30 min. This solution was added to the reaction solution cooled to room temperature, and then stirred at 110 °C for 18 h. Finally, 2-bromothiophene (0.0630 mmol, 0.50 eq.) and 2-trimethylstannylthiophene (0.0315 mmol, 0.25 eq.) were sequentially added to the solution and allowed to stand for 2 h for each step for the end-capping treatment. The polymerization was then quenched with a 5 M HCl solution (2 mL). The solution was extracted with chloroform and washed with water and KF (aq.), and it was purified via flash column chromatography (silica gel:K2CO3 = 9:1, w:w). The polymer solution was poured into MeOH (300 mL) to precipitate the polymer. The polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction using hexane to remove the residual monomer and then extracted with chloroform. After distilling off the chloroform solution using an evaporator, a dark blue polymer was obtained, followed by freeze-drying from its absolute benzene solution (0.250 g, 76%). SEC: Mn = 27200, Mw/Mn = 2.53. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C2D2Cl4, 80 °C). δ (ppm): 8.91 (s, 2H), 8.86 (s, 4H), 7.88 (s, 2H), 7.47 (s, 2H), 7.29–7.39 (m, 6H), 6.91 (s, 2H), 4.15–4.39 (m, 8H), 2.87–2.88 (m, 8H), 2.04–2.10 (m, 6H), 1.71 (d, 4H), 1.24–1.51 (m, 474H), 0.73–1.01 (m, 84H).


Inverted OPVs were fabricated with a device configuration of ITO glass/ZnO/BHJ/MoO3/Ag. ITO glass substrates were first washed with detergent, and then by sequential cleaning with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min for each step. Afterwards, the substrates were dried using a N2 flow, followed by 10 min of plasma treatment. The ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g of zinc acetate in 1 mL of 2-methoxyethanol with 28 μL of ethanolamine. The ZnO layer was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates and annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air. The binary precursor solution of the PBDB-T:N2200 blend (2:1 weight ratio) with a concentration of 16 mg mL−1 was prepared in CB. The ternary precursor solutions were prepared by blending a weight ratio of 0.5–3% of BCP or 1–10% of P1/P2 into the binary BHJ precursor solution. All the precursor solutions were vigorously stirred at 60 °C for 8 h in a N2 glove box. The BHJ layers were spin-coated onto the ZnO layer and the thickness was ∼80–90 nm. Finally, an 8 nm layer of MoO3 and a 100 nm layer of Ag were sequentially thermally deposited under a high vacuum (<10−6 torr) to complete the top electrode. The device's active area was 7 mm2.


The number average and weight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) and the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) were measured via size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Shodex KF-804L, a Shodex KF-805L and a UV detector HITACHI L-2400 at 40 °C using chloroform as the eluent and calibration with polystyrene standards. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a JEOL JNM-ECX400 instrument in deuterated 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (C2D2Cl4) at 80 °C. Thermal analysis was performed using a Seiko EXSTAR 6000 TG/DTA 6300 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 for thermogravimetry (TG) and using a TA Instruments Q-100 connected to a cooling system at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A JASCO V-560 spectrophotometer was used for recording the UV-vis spectra. The treatment conditions for preparing the thin-film samples for measurement of the UV-vis spectra are as follows: (a) dissolution of the polymer in chloroform (∼0.1 mg mL−1), (b) drop casting onto the quartz substrates, and (c) air drying. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a MultiMode AFM system with a Nanoscope 3D controller (Digital Instruments) in tapping mode. The spring constant of the silicon cantilevers (Nanosensor PPP-SEIHR) was 15 N m−1 and the resonant frequency was 130 kHz. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPVs were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport LCS-100 simulator, and were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU). The illumination intensity was calibrated using a Si photo-diode detector with a KG-5 filter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded using monochromatic light from a xenon lamp during illumination (QE-R, Enlitech Co., Ltd) and using a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell from 300 to 800 nm to calibrate the light intensity of each wavelength. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data were obtained using the beamline BL17A1 with a wavelength of 1.32164 Å at the NSRRC, Taiwan.
