The optimization of the polymer solar cells based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the bisadduct of phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (bisPCBM) is studied thoroughly as a role of solvent-annealing effect as well as different concentration of bisPCBM. In the case of P3HT:bisPCBM of 1:0.8 w/w, more balanced electron and hole mobilities are observed, resulting in better performance of the solar cells. Under the best balance conditions such as P3HT:bisPCBM of 1:0.8 w/w, the solvent annealing is employed to further clarify the optimization of the devices. Such a treatment leads to the formation of crystalline P3HT domains in the blend films, which is determined by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. From our experiment, one can conclude that the best power conversion efficiency of 3.75% is achieved in a layered structure of P3HT:bisPCBM of 1:0.8 w/w for a solvent-annealing time of 24 h.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices based on blends of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives are considered to be promising candidates for renewable energy sources since they offer the prospects of lower manufacturing costs (printing and coating technologies using solution-processable materials), lightweight solar modules and flexible large-area applications. Through the last decade, tremendous progress has been made towards the goal of successful commercialization of organic photovoltaic cells. Thereby, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 6–7% have been realized in both single-junction and tandem configurations.

To achieve high efficiencies in the polymer solar cells, two main factors: short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc), should be increased. There are many ways to develop enhanced Jsc in BHJ solar cells by altering the donor–acceptor morphology by means of thermal or solvent annealing of the active layers in the devices and incorporating additives in the solutions as well as by introducing an optical spacer to optimize the light intensity inside the devices. Recently, many p-type materials with suitable low bandgap have been synthesized to cover more the fraction of the solar spectrum, resulting in the increase of Jsc.
The Voc is determined by the difference between the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the electron-donating polymers and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electron-accepting materials in typical BHJ solar cells. One should not only engineer the energy levels both of the donor and accepter components to increase the Voc but also the HOMO of the donor needs to be 0.3–0.5eV higher than the LUMO of the acceptor for efficient charge separation. Recently, Hummelen et al. have reported that an increase in Voc of BHJ solar cells based on a series of bisadduct analogues of the fullerene derivatives occurred through raising the LUMO of the acceptor due to the changed fullerene's π-system when compared to phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). However, in the case of the P3HT:bisPCBM architecture, ineffective charge transport, inefficient charge dissociation, or undesirable morphology had a negative effect on the device, leading to a reduced Jsc. Although this observation can give rise to arguments against the use of bisPCBM, it is still a substantial candidate for electron acceptor in the polymer solar cells industry because it allows significant improvement of the Voc.
Herein, we have entirely investigated the optimal conditions of P3HT:bisPCBM devices to help us better understand as well as clarify its performance. In the course of our study to access a profile of the optimal ratio between P3HT and bisPCBM, electron and hole mobilities are measured from the thin films fabricated at various weight ratios (1:0.8, 1:1.2, 1:1.6, and 1:2.0 w/w). The best result is observed at 1:0.8 weight ratio of P3HT:bisPCBM. Thus, upon this composite, to further improve efficiency of P3HT:bisPCBM system via the controlled morphology, the solvent annealing effect of the cells is also scrutinized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Regio-regular P3HT(Medium MW 55000 g/mol) was purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. and bisPCBM was synthesized in our laboratory.


Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated according to the following procedure. First, the ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned with detergent, then ultrasonicated in distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron PH), was spin-cast at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The substrate was then dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air. Subsequently, it is moved into a glove box for spin-coating the active layer. A mixed solution of P3HT:bisPCBM in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was then spin coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer to obtain a BHJ film. Those samples were brought into a vacuum system (about 10−7 Torr), and an Al electrode (100 nm) was deposited on top of the BHJ layer. In addition, the device structures of the hole and electron only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Au and Al/P3HT:PCBM/Al, respectively. Typical devices were solvent-annealed in a petri dish. The solvent annealing was conducted by adding small amounts of DCB into a petri dish containing the devices, to keep the films wet in an N2 filled glove box. The petri dish was covered to keep uniform conditions. When the solvent-annealing time was prolonged small amounts of solvent were added into the petri dish. The samples were not exposed to ambient air after being loaded into the glove box.


Measurements were carried out with the solar cells inside the glove box by using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. The solar cell devices were illuminated at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. For a more accurate comparison of relative surfaces, AFM images were obtained of 5 μm × 5 μm area (veecoAFM) in tapping mode. XRD (Rigaku Cu Kα 3 kW) spectra of the different samples spin coated on glass were obtained out-of plane and UV-vis (Varian Cary 5000) spectra were measured for films of bisPCBM, P3HT and composites on fused silica.


Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells based on blends of P3HT and bisPCBM at different ratios (1:0.8, 1:1.2, 1:1.6 and 1:2.0 w/w) are evaluated as a function of the solvent annealing (Fig. 1). The solvent annealing is carried out within a covered glass petri dish for 2 h and the detailed conditions are described in the experimental section. The data of Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF), and PCE for various BHJ composites are shown in Table 1. Additional data for other solvent annealing times are presented in ESI. The P3HT:bisPCBM cell weight ratio of 1:0.8 w/w achieves the highest FF, which indicates the sensitivity to bisPCBM concentration in the performance of solar cells.

To precisely assess the correlation between the ratio and device performance, we have carefully examined the electron and hole mobilities of the fabricated devices with different ratios of P3HT:bisPCBM. For higher efficiency polymer BHJ solar cells, the mobility of electrons and holes in the polymer blends is an important parameter that must be well controlled because a balanced charge-carrier transport is an essential prerequisite for increasing FF. The electron and hole mobilities can be calculated from the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) by eqn (1).

r is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, L is the distance between the cathode and anode, which is equivalent to the film thickness, and V is the applied voltage. Fig. 2 displays the SCLC curves of P3HT:bisPCBM cells blended at 1:0.8, 1:1.2, 1:1.6, and 1:2.0 w/w under the solvent annealing and the data are summarized in Table 2. The trend of electron and hole mobilities in P3HT:bisPCBM films has an obvious similarity to those in P3HT:PCBM, however, both mobilities show relatively low values, compared to the reported P3HT:PCBM films with 1:0.8 w/w (μelectron or μhole = ∼10−8m2V−1s−1, respectively). Such deterioration of the mobilities in P3HT:bisPCBM can be largely attributed to a large number of bisPCBM isomers that can suppress the desirable bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the BHJ composite.

As the relative amount of bisPCBM weight increased in the blend, a more pronounced difference between electron and hole mobilities is noticeably observed. From mechanistic considerations of the balanced transport of holes and electrons in solar cells, we conclude that the P3HT:bisPCBM of 1:0.8 w/w is an optimized ratio configuration.
To ascertain the solvent-annealing effect, the J–V characteristics of the optimal P3HT:bisPCBM system in 1:0.8 w/w ratio are studied systematically as a function of the controlled annealing times (0, 2, 24, and 48 h) (Fig. 3). We have calculated series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) using J–V curves, the optimal results are obtained at 24 h solvent annealing time as shown in Table 3. Note that in our experiment (Table 3), the best solar cell yield obtained is for P3HT:bisPCBM with the annealing time for 24 h.

The inspection of the XRD of pure bisPCBM fails to reveal distinct diffraction peaks typically caused by PCBM crystallites. The failure to observe those characteristic patterns in the bisPCBM is not unexpected due to the presence of a multitude of different bisadduct isomers. The resulting patterns of the pure P3HT film displays a primary diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.4°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 1.61 ± 0.20 nm by applying Bragg's law: 2dsinθ = nλ. Notably, the crystallites with b- or c-axis orientations of P3HT are clearly detected upon prolonged annealing times (Fig. 4b). In the case of the P3HT:bisPCBM blend film (weight ratio, 1:0.8 w/w), the a-axis orientation is clearly revealed while relatively ambiguous XRD patterns along the b- and c-axes are observed when compared to those of pure P3HT (Fig. 4c). A likely rationale for this difference of XRD features between pure P3HT and the P3HT:bisPCBM blend is that the crystallization of P3HT is slightly suppressed by the presence of bisPCBM, leading to a disturbance along the (010 and 001) directions of P3HT segment crystallites.
We observe changes in the relative intensity at 2θ = 5.4° of the P3HT:bisPCBM film (Fig. 4d), the height of the peak is increased with the solvent-annealing time up to 24 h, but gradually decreased under further extended annealing time. This suggests that the solvent annealing of P3HT:bisPCBM film, up to 24 h, supports the increased formation of crystalline P3HT domains but, over 24 h, has a negative effect on P3HT:bisPCBM morphology.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of pure P3HT and P3HT:bisPCBM of 1:0.8 w/w in thin film are similar in shape with vibronic features, exhibiting a shoulder at 600 nm and a broad peak at around 530 nm (Fig. 5). The absorption coefficient of the composite film is increased with increasing solvent-annealing times, but times exceeding 24 h lead to decreased absorption. This indicates that the controlled solvent-annealing process results in the ordering of P3HT blocks in the P3HT:bisPCBM film. The increase in optical absorption of P3HT:bisPCBM upon increasing solvent-annealing time follows similar trends to that observed for P3HT:PCBM, but much less pronounced. This is suggestive that bisPCBM has a relatively more appreciable detrimental effect on the P3HT crystallinity when compared to P3HT blend film with PCBM, due to the isomeric species in bisPCBM.
The physical topographies of the P3HT:bisPCBM (weight ratio, 1:0.8 w/w) composite films with various solvent-annealing times (0, 2, 24, and 48 h), observed by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), are shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the surface in the scan area of 5 μm × 5 μm is gradually rougher as the solvent annealing time is increased to 24 h, but become smooth with annealing treatment of 48 h. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness at 0, 2, 24, and 48 h is 2.17 nm, 4.03 nm, 7.69 nm, and 3.11 nm, respectively. One possible conclusion is that the solvent-annealing times up to 24 h can allow optimization of the device performance in P3HT:bisPCBM since the rough surface may effectively reduce the charge transport distance and increase the Jsc as well as the formation of nanoscale texture. There is another possibility that the rough surface induces more light absorption due to the light scattering at the interface between the active layer and the electrode. This notion is in agreement with XRD as well as UV-vis data described before.

We have achieved the optimization of the fabrication of solar cells based on P3HT as the donor and bisPCBM as the new acceptor with its LUMO level 100 meV higher than PCBM, for high-efficiency devices. The best efficiency is obtained from a P3HT:bisPCBM device with a weight ratio of 1:0.8 that possesses an optimum balance between hole and electron mobilities. Moreover, through morphological manipulation of the active layer as a function of the solvent annealing time, further improved efficiency of P3HT:bisPCBM composite films (PCE = 3.75%) has been achieved. This result is mainly attributed to the enhanced crystallization of P3HT that is confirmed by conventional methods such as XRD, UV-vis spectroscopy, and AFM, resulting in a well-ordered interpenetrating network in the polymer blend system. Although the efficiency of P3HT:bisPCBM still needs to be further improved with respect to high-end applications, this study offers an important guideline for the optimal morphology for bulk heterojunction solar cells which consists of an electron-donating material and bisPCBM as an electron-accepting component.
