To address the challenges of reliability and facile processability of a benchmark polymer PTB7-Th, one of the most prevailing donor materials utilized in organic solar cells, we have systematically investigated the correlations among chemical structure, processing, morphology and device performance. Our study reveals that the regioregularity of PTB7-Th plays a crucial role in polymer properties as well as the fabrication process of devices. The regioregular polymer entirely consisting of favourable repeat units is capable of realizing high power conversion efficiency (>10%) in organic solar cells without using any solvent additive and tedious processing treatments. More importantly, the device efficiency based on this regioregular polymer is insensitive over a broad range of film thickness (from 100 nm to >400 nm). This will be very advantageous for manufacturing highly efficient and stable polymer solar cells by high throughput fabrication processes.

To meet different requirements and applications in various optoelectronic devices, one of the commonly used strategies for designing conjugated polymers is to incorporate two or more types of monomers in a single backbone, so that the optoelectronic properties of the relevant copolymers can be tuned individually by changing each monomer or integrally by changing their combinations. For example, in donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers with alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient units along the backbone, the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be individually adjusted by varying the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively, whereas changing the combination of the donor and acceptor can tune the intensity of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and afford desirable bandgaps. With these inherent advantages, D–A polymers have been demonstrated as promising donor materials and the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved based on this kind of copolymer in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, along with the introduction of multi-type of monomers, the complexity of D–A polymer structures is simultaneously raised due to different reactivities of monomers and intermediates during polymerization. This has led to the variability of polymers, including characteristics such as molecular weight, polydispersity index (PDI), regioregularity and purity. Compared to the remarkable progress made in revealing the relationship between the molecular weight and polymer properties, it is much more difficult to uncover the intrinsic effect of polymer regioregularity, which is a crucial factor in determining the properties and device performance of the corresponding polymers.

When D–A copolymers are applied as active components in OPVs, the most efficient device configuration to date is to form a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) by blending p-type polymers with n-type materials. To enable the generation and collection of dissociated free carriers in BHJs, it is essential that p- and n-type materials are finely mixed to create numerous interfaces for achieving efficient charge separation while appropriate micro-phase separation in blend films will allow forming of suitable channels for exciton diffusion and charge transport. Creating a bicontinuous network can solve this paradoxical situation of miscibility and phase separation. However, the ideal morphology is rarely realized by simply blending a conjugated polymer and an n-type material together due to their distinctly different natures in film formation kinetics. Therefore, it is a common practice in the field to use solvent additives or post-processing treatments to realize favorable morphologies in OPV devices. However, these methodologies not only create device complexity and manufacturing challenges, but also raise risks for device stability and lifetime. Furthermore, the thickness of the BHJ films is limited in practice by low charge mobility even with the assistance of an additive and processing treatments. The required super-thin films are very difficult to be manufactured by high throughput roll-to-roll printing. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop high-performance conjugated polymers with robust processability while solvent additives and post-treatments are not necessary for the device fabrication.
Among the D–A polymers applied in OPVs so far, poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b] dithiophene] [3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b] thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) is one of the most investigated polymers due to its extraordinary capability for achieving high efficiency with the help of solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). However, its accurate structure is not well defined and the properties of PTB7-Th obtained from different labs (and vendors) show great variations, with PCE values ranging from ∼7% to >10%. In our previous work, we discovered that PTB7-Th is essentially a random polymer, consisting of two different repeat units P1 and P2 (Scheme 1). These two moieties exhibit different molecular configurations while the P2 unit could lock the molecular skeleton by an intramolecular hydrogen bond, and eventually enhance the J-aggregation. Consequently, the regioregularity, i.e. the ratio of P1 and P2 units, is speculated to be the reason behind the inconstancy of PTB7-Th. To demonstrate the hypothesis, we herein systematically investigate varied PTB7-Th, including regioregular polymers P1 and P2 as well as the random polymer P3 from one-pot polymerization. The results show that the polymer properties and device performance significantly rely on the regioregularity of the relevant polymers. The P2 moiety as the favorable repeat unit is capable of enhancing the intermolecular interaction, leading to highly packing order and pure domain in the blend film, consequently improving the morphology of BHJs, and then exceeding 10% efficiency was realized in P2 devices without utilizing any processing additives. More importantly, these devices show great tolerance to film thickness, where a high PCE can be maintained ∼10% throughout the BHJ thickness range from less than 100 nm to over 400 nm. To the best of our knowledge, the device based upon P2 is one of the most efficient thick-film (>400 nm) devices fabricated from an additive-free solvent.

Three polymers were synthesized following a similar methodology in our previous report (Scheme 1).P1 and P2 were polymerized from relevant pre-designated monomers to ensure that all repeat units along the backbone possess the same regioregularity, while random PTB7-Th (named as P3 in this work) was prepared through one-pot polymerization with commonly used conditions. These polymers afford comparable molecular weight and PDI as listed in Table S1. Although these polymers could be dissolved in common organic solvents like chloroform and chlorobenzene, their solubility decreased gradually with the increase of molecular weight and the content of P2 structure. These results can be rationalized by the fact that the P2 unit is beneficial for aggregation of the polymer, which is also demonstrated by the UV-vis absorption spectra. As displayed in Fig. 1a and Table S1, the solution of P1 (5 × 10−6 M in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB)) exhibits an ICT peak at around 625 nm accompanied by a shoulder peak at 687 nm, which is assigned to the intermolecular aggregation. Compared to P1, the absorption of P2 shows much stronger intensity with a slight red-shift, however, the relative intensities of ICT and aggregation peaks change, with the peak at 698 nm becoming the maximum absorption and the ICT peak declining to be a shoulder peak. The absorption spectrum of P3 has more features of P2, indicating that the predominant unit in random PTB7-Th is the P2 unit. Similarly, polymers with more P2 moieties also exhibit obviously enhanced aggregation peaks in thin films (Fig. S1). Based on the onset of their UV-vis absorption in the solid state, the optical bandgaps of these polymers are estimated to be ∼1.62 eV. To further evaluate the energy levels of these polymers, the redox behaviors of these polymers were studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The curves and data are listed in Table S1 and Fig. S2. Compared to P1, both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P2 are slightly raised attributed to its larger effective conjugation, which has been demonstrated by the fact the molecular conformation of P2 tends to be more planar.


To investigate the photovoltaic performance of polymers with various regioregularities, BHJ solar cells were fabricated with an inverted architecture: ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag. According to the optimal conditions in the literature, the active layers are deposited from DCB/DIO (v/v, 97/3) solution to afford films with 70–90 nm thickness. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 1b and the device parameters are listed in Table 1. The photovoltaic properties of P1 and P2 are first studied to evaluate the pros and cons of these regioregular polymers. As predicted before, poor performance was observed in the devices based on P1, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.70 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.61 to yield a PCE of 7.01%. Compared to P1, P2 shows a much higher PCE of 9.78% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 16.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.70, which corroborates well with its higher extinction coefficient and stronger intermolecular packing observed in its absorption spectra. With respect to the random polymers, the device from P3 shows a PCE of 9.14% with a Voc of 0.82 eV, a Jsc of 16.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68, which is consistent with the fact that most of the repeat units in P3 are based on the P2 structure. The significant difference of photovoltaic performance among varied devices clearly demonstrates that the P2 structure is the favorable moiety within PTB7-Th. Therefore, the following investigation will focus on the comparison of P2 and P3 which have a slight difference in regioregularity.

It is well known that a solvent additive like DIO is essential in optimizing the morphology of the PTB7-Th/PC71BM BHJ to realize high efficiency. However, the additive effect is less applicable to P2/PC71BM devices. The data are summarized in Fig. 1b and Table 1. Without using DIO, the efficiency of P3 decreases to 7.88% with a FF changing from 0.68 to 0.58, which is consistent with the reported literature. However, the devices fabricated from P2 without using any additive show a PCE of 9.97% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 17.99 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.66. In comparison with the devices fabricated from DCB/DIO solution, the Voc is enhanced from 0.83 V to 0.85 V, resulting from reduced energy loss, potentially indicating that improved film morphology may be achieved for better exciton diffusion and charge transport. To verify the hypothesis of improved charge transport, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) was measured to evaluate both the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities (Table 1 and Fig. S3). The addition of DIO deteriorates both μh and μe from 1.60 × 10−2 and 9.76 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (without DIO) to 4.15 × 10−3 and 2.33 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (with DIO). This suggests that DIO has a negative effect in the case of the P2/PC71BM system limiting its charge mobility. With respect to the P3/PC71BM blend film, however, DIO is able to improve the μe from 7.27 × 10−3 to 2.74 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the μh is comparable. These results corroborate well with the trend of device efficiencies when DIO is utilized. Notably, P2/PC71BM exhibits much higher hole-mobility relative to P3/PC71BM under the same conditions although there is a slight difference between their regioregularities.

To better understand the influence of the slight difference in regioregularity between P2 and P3 on the device performance, the microstructures of the blend films fabricated from the same conditions are investigated by GIWAXS and R-SoXS, the latter of which is a useful technique to quantify the length scales of phase separation and average composition variations (ACV), i.e., average purity, in BHJs. The GIWAXS 2D patterns and the corresponding 1D linecut profiles are depicted in Fig. 2a and b. At q = 0.29 Å−1 a polymer lamellar peak was observed in both out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions of all blend films, as well as an OOP π–π stacking peak at q ∼ 1.58 Å−1. The scattering features at 0.65, 1.31, and 1.89 Å−1 are consistent with known spacings in PC71BM aggregates/crystallites. Differences in peak intensity for samples with DIO vs. those without DIO indicate that in P2/PC71BM, DIO increases molecular packing, both for the polymer and PC71BM, while in P3/PC71BM, DIO shows a less impact on molecular packing.

In order to understand the impact of DIO on the nanomorphology, the domain characteristics were analyzed using R-SoXS. Lorentz-corrected 1D R-SoXS profiles of blend films with and without DIO acquired at 283.2 eV and normalized by absorption and thickness are shown in Fig. 2c. Plots of 1D circularly averaged scattering intensities (I) as a function of q are also shown in Fig. S4. Under the assumption of a globally isotropic 3-dimensional morphology, Lorentz correction is able to provide quantitative center-to-center domain characteristics. We note that all of the profiles can be fitted well with a single lognormal distribution (Fig. S5). Observing similar domain features allows us to make reliable comparisons regarding long periods and ACVs of the systems studied here. The integrated scattering intensities (ISIs) of the profiles are proportional to the square of the ACV over the length scales included in the integration. We found for both P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM that blends with DIO have larger relative ACV than those without DIO. We also found that relative ACV shows a monotonic correlation with device FF. It is notable that in a few cases, highly pure domains (composition below the fullerene percolation threshold) may result in more trapped charges and slightly lower the Jsc and FF if there is lack of a sufficient number of percolating pathways in the mixed regions. While in a large number of OPV systems, large domain spacings generally lead to lower Jsc and a higher ACV results in a higher device FF. Interestingly, while DIO has the same effect on relative ACV for the two polymer blends, it does not have the same effect on domain spacings (as quantified by the R-SoXS long periods). In P2/PC71BM, DIO shifts the long period, i.e. center-to-center domain spacing, from 36.7 nm to 49.4 nm, while in P3/PC71BM the long period remains effectively constant (∼50 nm) for films processed without and with DIO. We observe similar behavior in Jsc, where P2/PC71BM with DIO has lower Jsc than without DIO, while P3/PC71BM has close to the same Jsc. A strong correlation between BHJ long period and Jsc has been observed previously and is due to improved charge generation as domain length scales approach the exciton diffusion length (10–20 nm).
Taken together, the morphology data help to explain how the blend films are affected by DIO and how the differences in regioregularity ultimately affect the device performance. DIO in P3/PC71BM increases the relative ACV without changing the long period, which coincides with an increase in FF, little change in Jsc and a corresponding increase in device performance from ∼7.88% to ∼9.14%. For P2/PC71BM, however, the BHJ processed without DIO has the smallest long period, coinciding with the highest Jsc of the four blends (∼17 mA cm−2), and a still moderately large relative ACV and FF (0.65), leading to the highest performance device (9.97%). When DIO is used with P2/PC71BM, the average composition variation (and FF) improves to the largest of the four blends, however Jsc drops as the long period increases significantly and the resulting device performance (9.78%) is slightly worse than that of the blend without DIO. The lowest FF of the P3 device without DIO can be well explained by the lowest ACV (average purity). These results reinforce that the addition of DIO can influence the morphology and performance of BHJs in different ways, even in the case of two polymer/fullerene blends processed under the same conditions, the only difference being the polymer regioregularity, where the lower regioregularity of P3 may strongly alter the polymer ordering and thus the solvent–polymer interaction between DIO and the polymer. Notably, these results demonstrate that optimizing the regioregularity of polymers is an effective strategy for attaining morphologies favorable for high performance (∼10%) without the need for solvent additives. The potential to cast films without solvent additives simplifies the fabrication process and allows for significantly improved morphological stability, which are both highly desirable characteristics for large-scale manufacturing.

It is well known that a thick active layer in a BHJ is not only able to harvest sunlight more efficiently but also easier to be fabricated by high throughput technology, like roll-to-roll printing. However, previous studies have shown that the device efficiency of PTB7-Th will start to deteriorate if the thickness of the active layer is beyond 100 nm due to the inhomogeneous distribution of blend compositions and their low charge mobility in thick films. In this work, P2 is able to form a favorable microstructure in a thin film even without the help of processing additives. To investigate the performance of P2 in thicker BHJ films, solar cell devices with varied thickness were fabricated, while devices based on P3 were also made as reference. Due to the difference of intermolecular interactions, the active layers from P2 or P3/PC71BM solution with the same concentration show different thicknesses even if they are fabricated under identical conditions. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The P2 based devices with 138 nm and 280 nm thicknesses exhibit similar performances with a Jsc ∼ 18 mA cm−2 which is similar to the one obtained in thin films (92 nm). Interestingly, the Jsc is significantly enhanced to 19.6 mA cm−2 when the thickness reaches 425 nm. These results clearly illustrate that the blend films of P2/PC71BM could maintain good morphology even in thick films over 400 nm. When the thickness of the P3/PC71BM film is optimized at 139 nm, the device shows the best PCE of 10.09% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 17.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.73. By further increasing the thickness to 220 nm and 287 nm, the PCE gradually decreases to 9.36% and 8.44% respectively, attributed to the decreased Jsc and FF.

We have also studied the effect of DIO as processing additive on the performance of thick-film devices. The P3 devices without DIO show much inferior performance with a PCE of 7.84% (125 nm), 6.24% (210 nm) and 5.60% (290 nm) respectively. It is notable that the FF values of these devices are much lower than the ones with DIO, indicating the importance of DIO in tuning the BHJ microstructure including the phase separation and distribution of composition in P3/PC71BM. However, like the thin-film device, DIO is less critical for regioregular polymer P2. For the devices of 152 nm and 280 nm, all the parameters including Voc, Jsc and FF remain quite steady, affording a PCE of 9.35% and 9.23%, respectively. When the thickness of the P2/PC71BM blend film reaches 420 nm, much higher Jsc (19.0 mA cm−2) accompanied excellent Voc (0.81 V) and FF (0.68) afford a champion efficiency of 10.42%. This high Jsc is further verified by the EQE results as shown in Fig. 3.
To understand the enhanced Jsc in thick-film devices, an optical simulation was conducted to elucidate the contribution of solar spectra. Due to the optical interferences in the nanoscale multilayered structure, the absorption profile (Fig. 4a) and the corresponding photocurrent (Fig. 4b) show characteristic fluctuations and saturation behavior as the photoactive layer thickness increases. Higher absorption coefficients of P2/PC71BM blend films than that of P3/PC71BM (Fig. 4a) promote more abrupt increment of optical absorption with thickness, which led to a higher theoretical maximum of the photocurrent up to 100 nm in thickness. As the thickness increases above 100 nm, most of the photons are absorbed regardless of the photoactive layer so that similar maximum photocurrents were estimated. In actual measurements, P2 based devices in general follow the theoretical estimations with incrementally increased photocurrent without significant loss of FF or Voc up to 400 nm thickness. A slight discrepancy around 300 nm is attributed to the differences in the charge carrier generation profile as shown in Fig. 4c.
Since the electron mobility is lower than the hole mobility in P2 based devices, the charge extraction efficiency is supposed to be more severely affected by the proximity of the generation profile to the cathode. Considering that the overall optical electric field distribution within the photoactive layer is determined by thickness-dependent interference, the appearance of prominent energy dissipation near the anode in the maximum absorption range (∼600 nm wavelength) could have increased the average distance of the generation profile from the cathode so that it prohibits the actual contribution of enhanced photon absorption to the photocurrent. Moreover, for thicker films (>200 nm), surface-induced vertical spinodal decomposition could also induce inhomogeneous distribution of optical dielectric function of active layers, which could lead to different optical interference and therefore different overall optical absorption within the photoactive layers. In contrast, obvious deviations between theoretical and actual photocurrents of the P3/PC71BM devices at higher thicknesses (>200 nm) clearly showed that the most prevalent limiting factor of the photocurrent generation was charge transport and collection efficiencies. Gradually reduced FF accompanied by photocurrent loss with the increase of photoactive layer thickness was consistent with those assignments, strongly supporting that the regioregularity of the polymer determines their transport properties in both neat and blend films and therefore the capability of photon harvesting of BHJ solar cells.

As a highly efficient donor polymer for OPVs, PTB7-Th has many unsolved challenges including reliability, instability induced by residual solvent additive, and limitations on film thickness. In this work, we found that the regioregularity of PTB7-Th is crucial on determining the polymer properties and device performance. Compared to the P1 unit, the P2 structure as the favorable unit shows the capability to enhance the extinction coefficient and intermolecular packing. Consequently, the performances of relevant devices are improved with the increasing ratio of P2 units in the polymer backbone. Moreover, devices based upon regioregular polymer P2 can realize over 10% PCE without using any additive or processing treatment, attributing to the formation of a favorable morphology in the blend film with PC71BM. More importantly, the high efficiency is able to tolerate a wide range of thicknesses from less than 100 nm to over 400 nm. This result is one of the most efficient thick-film devices fabricated from an additive-free solvent. The potential to cast thick films without solvent additives will significantly simplify the fabrication process and improve the device stability, which are both highly desirable characteristics for large-scale manufacturing of organic electronic devices. In addition, considering PTB7-Th is also an important p-type material in the field of the tremendously developing non-fullerene solar cell, regioregular polymer P2, collaborating with matchable non-fullerene acceptors, affords infinite opportunities to access stable, high-performance and facile fabricated organic photovoltaic devices.


The molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined using a Waters 1515 series GPC running in dichlorobenzene at 130 °C and calibrated against narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. 1H NMR spectra of polymers were measured on a Bruker and AV-500 spectrometer with d2-tetrachloroethane as solvent at 70 °C. UV-vis spectra were taken using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer.


M1 and M2 were synthesized following a similar procedure reported in previous literature. All other reagents and starting materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. All solvents were dehydrated and purged with argon prior to use.

Under an argon atmosphere, two monomers with identical equivalences were dissolved in toluene/DMF (∼40 mg ml−1) in a three-neck flask, followed by the addition of 2 mol% catalyst Pd(PPh3)4. The flask was frozen by liquid nitrogen and opened to the vacuum pump, and then refilled with argon. The degas procedure was repeated three times. Then the solution was heated to the corresponding temperature by an oil bath and kept stirring for 72 h. The actual reaction temperature has been calibrated by simultaneously monitoring the temperatures of the reactant mixture and oil bath. During the reaction, the temperature was controlled by a thermal sensor. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the crude polymer was precipitated in methanol and then purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, THF and chloroform. Finally, the polymer was recovered by precipitating in methanol.



M1 (200 mg, 0.176 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (2.0 mg, 0.0018 mmol) were dissolved in 2.5 ml toluene and 2.5 ml DMF, and the polymerization was conducted at 100 °C following the general procedure, finally affording P1 in the yield of 71%.

ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned ultrasonically with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in sequence for 10 min each. After UV–ozone cleaning for 15 min, ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated onto pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air to complete the formation of a thin layer of ZnO (ca. 30 nm). The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate C4H6O4Zn·2(H2O) (99.5%, Merck 1 g) and ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 98% Acros, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 98%, 10 ml) under stirring for 8 h for hydrolysis reaction and aging. The polymer:PC71BM blends with 1:1.5 ratio were dissolved in DCB with or without 3 vol% DIO and stirred overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The active layers with different thicknesses were obtained by spin-coating the blend solution with varied concentrations from 20 to 45 mg ml−1 that was filtered with a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) filter (0.45 μm) atop the thin layer of ZnO. The anode of each device, MoO3/Ag (8 nm/150 nm), was thermally evaporated at a pressure of about 10−7 torr. The area of each device was 3.14 mm2 defined by a shadow mask. Electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (150 nm) and hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (150 nm) were used to evaluate charge mobilities by the SCLC model.


Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted at beamline 7.3.3 (ref. 48) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, CA. The 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of ∼0.13°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the active layers. A 2M Pilatus 2D detector was used to collect the scattering patterns. All measurements were conducted under a helium atmosphere to reduce air scattering. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was performed in transmission with linearly polarized photons under high vacuum (1 × 10−7 torr) at beamline 11.0.1.2, ALS and the scattering patterns were recorded using a Princeton PI-MTE CCD detector (2048 pixels × 2048 pixels). The soft X-ray energy was tuned between 270 and 300 eV in the R-SoXS experiments. Samples were prepared on top of PSS-coated Si(100) substrates and floated by deionized water and transferred onto Si3N4 windows for R-SoXS measurements. All X-ray analysis was done using a modified version of the NIKA software package in Igor Pro.


The optical simulation was based on the transfer matrix formalism. The energy dissipation (Q) was calculated along with the light propagation direction from the ITO side illumination. The calculation of the photocurrent was carried out by evaluating the Q factor over both the photoactive layer and the entire layer from the obtained E2, which is the time averaged energy dissipation at a certain position (w/m2 nm). The Q in the layer j can be expressed as follows:
where
ε0 is the permittivity of the medium, n is the refractive index and k is the extinction coefficient of the layer j. In the simple system with sufficient charge extraction from the active layers, the photocurrent (Jsc) can be calculated as:
where
Pin is the spectral irradiance at a normal incidence angle and the jdj is the proportional Q factor in the layer j with respect to the Q factor integrated over the entire system. In our calculation, the range of the excitation wavelength (λI, λII) was from 380 nm to 780 nm, and the ASTM G173-03 reference spectrum of AM1.5G was used as the Pin.
