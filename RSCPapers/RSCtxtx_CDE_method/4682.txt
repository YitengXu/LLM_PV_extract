Following the previous report on the fabrication of three-dimensional hierarchical SnO2 octahedra consisting of nanoparticles via a rapid sonochemical process (Wang et al., Chem.–Eur. J., 2010, 16, 8620–8625), the influences of ultrasonic time, amplitude, ratio of H2O–diethylene glycol (DEG), and different Sn salts on the morphology and size of SnO2 have been further investigated in the present article. The hierarchical SnO2 octahedra with average edge lengths of 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 1.8 μm composed of 30–40 nm SnO2 nanoparticles have been successfully obtained. The power conversion efficiencies of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the hierarchical SnO2 octahedra photoanodes varied from 5.57%, 5.82%, 6.40%, 6.45% to 6.80% with the corresponding octahedron sizes of 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 1.8 μm, respectively. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and UV-vis diffuse spectroscopy were used to investigate the influences of the SnO2 octahedron size on the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted tremendous interest since the great breakthrough made in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel. They are regarded as promising candidates for the low-cost photovoltaic solar cells. The photoelectrode, which is a mesoporous wide-band-gap metal oxide semiconductor film with an enormous internal surface area for dye adsorption, is one of key features in DSSCs. Typically, TiO2 nanoparticles have been used as the photoelectrode due to higher surface area, which has shown more than 12% power conversion efficiency. However, the ultra-fast electron injection rates from the excited dye into the TiO2 nanoparticles come into conflict with the high electron recombination rates due to low electron mobility and transport properties. Except TiO2, other metal oxide semiconductors such as ZnO, SnO2 and Zn2SnO4 have been recently investigated as promising photoelectrodes of DSSCs.

SnO2 with a band gap (Eg) of 3.8 eV (at 300 K) has received increasing interesting as the photoelectrode of DSSCs due to its much higher electron mobility than TiO2 and low sensitivity to UV degradation because of its larger band gap resulting in better long term stability. However, the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC based on a SnO2 photoelectrode is still poor compared with TiO2, which can be possibly ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the positive shift (300 mV) of the conduction band edge of SnO2 compared with nanocrystalline TiO2 results in faster interfacial electron recombination, (2) the lower isoelectric point (pI: 4–5) of SnO2 compared with anatase TiO2 (pI: 6–7) leads to less adsorption of the dye. Both of these can result in lower photocurrent density and photovoltage, hence for lower photovoltaic performance for SnO2.
Although SnO2 photoelectrodes with various nanostructures including nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanorods have been reported, the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC based on a SnO2 photoelectrode is normally ∼5%. Recently, hierarchical microspheres of TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 composed of nanoparticles have demonstrated superior photovoltaic performance due to the improved light scattering ability and/or better electron transport. Especially, a highly efficient DSSC with a power conversion efficiency of 6.40% based on hierarchical SnO2 octahedra (1.0 μm) has been reported. The hierarchical SnO2 octahedra photoelectrode exhibited two advantages including higher amounts of dye loading (30–40 nm particles) and superior light scattering (submicron-sized octahedra) for the enhancement of light absorption.
Herein, a series of different sizes of hierarchical SnO2 octahedra have been successfully synthesized via the optimization of experimental conditions, and size-dependent photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs have been investigated in detail by using UV-vis diffuse spectroscopy, intensity module photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity module photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) techniques. Finally, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.80% has been achieved by using a hierarchical SnO2 octahedra (1.8 μm in size) film consisting of ∼30 nm particles.

SnCl2·2H2O (0.0025–0.02 mol) was dissolved in diethylene glycol (DEG, 10–40 mL), after 10 min of stirring, deionized water (40–10 mL) was added to this solution, and it was continuously stirred for 10 min. Afterwards, diethanolamine was added to this solution dropwise and this resulted in a white suspension. Subsequently, the suspension was subjected to an intense ultrasonic irradiation (Sonics: VCX-500) for different time periods. The resulting precipitates (Sn6O4(OH)4) were collected by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed 5 times using absolute ethanol and distilled water, respectively, and finally dried at 60 °C for further characterization. In order to obtain hierarchical SnO2 octahedra, the as-prepared Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra were calcined at 800 °C for 3 h in air.


The method for the preparation of SnO2 photoelectrodes was described in our previous paper. The SnO2 films were immersed into a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol, then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 70–80 °C, the fabricated SnO2 electrodes were immersed into acetonitrile–tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1) containing N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, 5.0 × 10−4 M, Solaronix Co.), and were kept for 20 h at room temperature.


The Pt-coated FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) glass used as a counter electrode was prepared by dropping H2PtCl6 (5.0 × 10−4 M) solution on the FTO glass followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 min in air. The electrolyte consisted of 1-propyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide (PMII, 0.6 M), I2 (0.03 M), LiI (0.05 M), Guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS) (GSCN, 0.1 M, Aldrich), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, 0.5 M, Aldrich) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). The active area of the dye-coated SnO2 film was 0.160 cm2.


The phase purity of the products was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F) was applied to investigate the size and morphology, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL-2010 HR transmission electron microscope to further determine the intrinsic structure. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the hierarchical SnO2 octahedra were measured by using an ASAP 2010 Surface Area Analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). The thickness of the SnO2 film was measured by using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1). Shimadzu UV-3150 UV-vis-NIR Spectrophotometer was used to measure UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. The current–voltage characteristics were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by solar simulator (91192, 1 kW Xe lamp, Oriel). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) signal was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochrometer. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were characterized on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated blue light emitting diode (457 nm) driven by a Zahner (PP211) source supply. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) at a bias potential of −0.75 V in dark with the frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 M Hz.


Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra were formed via the nuclei and oriented attachment of Sn6O4(OH)4 nanoparticles followed by surface flattening, supported by the FE-SEM observations of as-prepared products under various sonication duration times (0–10 min). Further study shows the sonication time influences the size of the Sn6O4(OH)4 intermediates, and the FE-SEM images of the as-prepared Sn6O4(OH)4 intermediates after sonication for 5 and 20 min are shown in Fig. 1a and c, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the morphology of the Sn6O4(OH)4 intermediates are octahedra, similar to the previous report. However, the average edge length of the octahedra varied from 1.5 μm, to 1.0 μm (ref. 1), to 0.8 μm with the prolonged sonication duration, from 5, to 10, to 20 min, respectively, which can be possibly ascribed to the mechanical removal by shockwave and continuous surface flattening. After heat treatment of the as-prepared Sn6O4(OH)4 intermediates at 800 °C for 3 h, SnO2 octahedra were obtained because of the decomposition and oxidation of Sn6O4(OH)4 (Fig. 1b and d). Close observation of the higher magnification FE-SEM images (insets of Fig. 1b and d) reveal that the SnO2 octahedra are composed of numerous nanoparticles.

The effects of amplitude (or sonication intensity) during the present sonochemical process on the Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra morphology were further investigated. Fig. S1 (ESI) displays a series of morphological evolutions of products synthesized at different amplitude conditions (from 30% to 85%), keeping other experimental conditions constant, namely, 1.128 g of SnCl2·2H2O, 10 mL of H2O and 40 mL of DEG, sonication 10 min. When the amplitude is 30%, Sn6O4(OH)4 nanoparticles and incomplete octahedra are observed (Fig. S1a), irregular SnO2 octahedra and nanoparticles (Fig. S1b) are further formed after heat treatment at 800 °C for 3 h. With the amplitude increased to 50%, 70% or 85%, the Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra with the average edge lengths of 1.0 μm (ref. 1), 0.8 μm and 0.75 μm were observed (Fig. S1c and S1e), respectively, and the corresponding hierarchical SnO2 octahedra consisting of nanoparticles were observed after calcination in air at 800 °C for 3 h (Fig. S1d and S1f). These FE-SEM results reveal that the average edge length of the Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra decreased with the increasing amplitude, which can be possibly attributed to the enhanced mechanical removal by shockwave and continuous surface flattening under higher amplitude. This trend is similar to the above result of different sonication duration. Both the prolonged sonication duration and higher sonication amplitude may enhance the mechanical removal and hence lead to the smaller sizes of the octahedra.
The influences of the concentration of SnCl2·2H2O on the sizes of Sn6O4(OH)4 were also carried out and the FE-SEM images are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). As the concentration of SnCl2·2H2O was varied from 0.05, to 0.2, to 0.4 M, the morphology of the Sn6O4(OH)4 is still octahedron, however, the average length of the Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra increased from 0.8, to 1.2, to 1.6 μm (Fig. S2a, S2c and S2e). This rise of the octahedra size with the increasing concentration of SnCl2·2H2O could be ascribed to the faster nuclei and growth rate. The corresponding hierarchical SnO2 octahedra consisting of nanoparticles were also obtained (ESI, Fig. S2b, S2d and S2f) after calcination in air at 800 °C for 3 h.
Preliminary results proved the diethylene glycol (DEG) plays a crucial role in the formation of Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra. In the absence of DEG (just in pure water), the as-prepared Sn6O4(OH)4 has formed as nanoparticles. Furthermore, no product was obtained in the pure DEG (namely, without H2O), since the hydrolysis reaction doesn't happen. Hence, the ratio of DEG and H2O may have an important influence on the morphology of the as-prepared products, which is further investigated in detail. Fig. 2 shows the FE-SEM images of the as-prepared Sn6O4(OH)4 under different volume ratios of DEG and H2O, e.g. 3:2, 1:1 and 2:3, and the corresponding annealed SnO2. Higher DEG:H2O ratios of 4:1 and 3:2 leads to the formation of octahedra morphology with average edge lengths of 1.0 and 1.8 μm, respectively, as shown in our previous publication and Fig. 2a, which may be ascribed to the different coordination and reaction activity. At higher DEG–H2O ratio (4:1), DEG may have a strong coordination effect with Sn resulting in slow reaction rate, which is responsible for the smaller size (1.0 μm) compared with the 1.8 μm sized product prepared at a DEG:H2O ratio of 3:2. Increasing the amount of H2O (e.g. DEG:H2O = 3:2) could accelerate the hydrolysis of the Sn-complexes, thus leading to the larger size of the Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra. However, with a further increase of H2O, namely with a smaller ratio of DEG:H2O, e.g. 1:1, 2:3, the as-synthesized products are nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 2c and e (Fig. 2d and f are the corresponding calcined SnO2), respectively. These results indicate that the DEG is very important for the formation of octahedra and the volume ratio of DEG:H2O strongly influences the morphology and size of Sn6O4(OH)4 and the following hierarchical SnO2. The morphology evolution of the sonochemically synthesized Sn6O4(OH)4 and calcined hierarchical SnO2 with different volume ratios of DEG:H2O are further shown in Scheme 1.
The preparation of Sn6O4(OH)4 intermediates was probably affected by the kinetic control. It is well known that the growth rates vary along the different crystallographic directions and the fast growth plane determines the final morphology. The influences of DEG on the morphology of Sn6O4(OH)4 may be attributed to its coordination property with Sn2+ and the reactivity, which will change the nuclei and growth rates of different crystal directions and lead to different morphologies and sizes of the products. However, the way that DEG exactly works still needs to be further studied.
Alternatively, selenium precursors other than SnCl2·2H2O such as SnC2O4 and SnSO4 could be also used in the synthesis of Sn6O4(OH)4 intermediates. When the SnC2O4 and SnSO4 were used as the selenium sources, the average lengths of the Sn6O4(OH)4 octahedra were 0.46 and 0.5 μm (Fig. 3a and c), respectively, which is smaller than that of SnCl2·2H2O (1.0 μm), possibly due to the lower chemical reactivity of SnC2O4 and SnSO4 compared with SnCl2·2H2O. Fig. 3b and d are the corresponding calcined hierarchical SnO2 octahedra.
The size and morphology of the hierarchical TiO2 or ZnO spheres have been found to influence the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. However, no systematic investigations on the SnO2 photoanode for DSSCs can be found in the literature. Herein, several typical SnO2 products with sizes of 0.5 μm (Fig. 3d, sample I), 0.8 μm (Fig. 1d, sample II), 1.0 μm (sample III, from the previous paper), 1.5 μm (Fig. 1b, sample IV) and 1.8 μm (Fig. 2b, sample V) prepared under different experiment conditions are selected as photoelectrode materials in order to investigate the effect of the SnO2 size on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
All the well-defined diffraction peaks of the X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the selected five samples (Fig. 4) can be indexed to the pure tetragonal phase of SnO2 (JCPDS #41-1445) with a = b = 4.738 Å and c = 3.187 Å. The average sizes of the SnO2 nanoparticles are calculated according to the Scherrer equation from the full-width at half (110) peak of SnO2. The size of the secondary building units (SnO2 nanoparticles) of the hierarchical SnO2 octahedra are 42, 31, 30, 32 and 32 nm, respectively, which implies that the different sizes of SnO2 octahedra are composed of similar SnO2 nanoparticles (30–40 nm).
The intrinsic structural information on the secondary structure of the selected five hierarchical SnO2 octahedra was further characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Clearly, the TEM and HRTEM images show that sample I (Fig. 5a), II (Fig. 5b), III (Fig. 5c) and V (Fig. 5d) are hierarchical SnO2 octahedra, which are composed of nanoparticles. The sizes of the SnO2 nanoparticles (build units) of the samples I, II, III and V are ∼40, ∼30, ∼30 and ∼30 nm, respectively, which are consistent with the particle sizes calculated by the XRD results. The HRTEM image of an individual SnO2 nanoparticle shows the single crystal nature.
In order to investigate the influence of hierarchical octahedral SnO2 size on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs, solar cells consisting of the films made with the selected five hierarchical SnO2 octahedra (Fig. 6, Scheme 2) were tested under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 7. The detailed photovoltaic parameters obtained from each J–V curve (Fig. 7) were summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the short-circuit current densities (Jsc) and the overall light conversion efficiencies (η) of the SnO2 films with a hierarchical structure were 11.58, 12.50, 14.39, 14.20 and 14.59 mA cm−2 and 5.57, 5.82, 6.40, 6.45 and 6.80%, respectively, increasing as the average length of the SnO2 octahedra increased from 0.5, to 0.8, to 1.0, to 1.5 to 1.8 μm. The open-circuit voltages (Voc) of the hierarchical SnO2 films from 0.8 μm (sample II) to 1.8 μm (sample V) are similar with 760 ± 7 mV because of similar SnO2 nanoparticle size (∼30 nm). However, the Voc of 790 mV for sample I is higher than the other four samples (760 ± 7 mV), which is probably due to the larger size (∼40 nm) of nanoparticles for sample I, possessing lower interparticle boundaries and surface defects, leading to longer electron life time (see Fig. 9b). Furthermore, the fill factor (FF) of the five kinds of hierarchical SnO2 octahedra photoelectrodes does not show any obvious changes. Finally, the DSSC based on sample V displays the highest photovoltaic performance of 6.80%. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) is defined as the number of incident photons, and the IPCE of cells based on different hierarchical octahedral SnO2 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 7b. The quantum efficiencies of all cells with the N719 dye are maximized at 525 nm, which corresponds to the N719 absorption peak. This clearly shows that the IPCE results are in good agreement with the observed Jsc, which are shown in Table 1. However, the dye amounts on the SnO2 photoelectrodes (Table 1) are 5.32, 6.62, 6.30, 5.29 and 5.04 × 10−8 mol cm−2 with the increasing size of the SnO2 octahedra, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 1.8 μm, respectively. The specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas are 25.3, 27.5, 26.3, 25.1 and 23.5 m2 g−1 for the samples I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively, obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. Obviously, the highest photocurrent for the 1.8 μm sized SnO2 octahedra (sample V) is not because of the dye loading. As is well known, the photocurrent density (Jsc) is dependent on the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), the electron injection efficiency (ηinj) and the efficiency of collecting the injected charge at the back contact (ηcc), which can be calculated by the following expression.
Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0
(1)
where
q is the elementary charge, and I0 is the light flux. In the present case, all the photoelectrodes are based on the hierarchical SnO2 octahedra and the N719 dye, hence ηinj is suggested to be the same. Obviously, both the ηlh and ηcc can influence the photocurrent density. It is well known that the ηlh is determined by the dye loading (see Table 1) and the light scattering ability. The light scattering ability can be evaluated by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra.

Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of various hierarchical SnO2 films of the five samples without and with dye. Clearly, the reflectance of the SnO2 photoelectrodes increases with the increasing size of SnO2 octahedra from 0.5 to 1.8 μm (Fig. 8a), demonstrating the light scattering ability increases with the larger size of SnO2 octahedra. Furthermore, in the long wavelength region (550–700 nm), the dye adsorbed hierarchical SnO2 octahedra film (Fig. 8b) also shows an increasing reflectance with the larger size of SnO2 octahedra. This can reasonably explain the above J−V results. The least dye amount (larger nanoparticle size: ∼40 nm) and smallest light scattering ability (smaller size of octahedron: 0.5 μm) of sample I lead to the lowest Jsc. Although the dye amounts decrease slightly with the increasing octahedra size, the Jsc increases from sample II (0.8 μm) to V (1.8 μm), which should be ascribed to the increasing light scattering ability. As shown in Fig. 8, the reflectance of the hierarchical SnO2 octahedral films increases following the order of sample I, II, III, IV and V.
Furthermore, the intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were measured in order to investigate the electron transport and recombination of the DSSCs based on different hierarchical SnO2 octahedra films. The electron transport time (τd) and the recombination time (τr) of the five samples can be estimated from the IMPS plots and the IMVS plots, respectively, which decrease with the increasing light intensity (Fig. 9a and b). The electron transport is faster at higher light intensity because the deep traps are filled and electron trapping–detrapping involves shallower levels (Fig. 9a). Moreover, Fig. 9a and b reveal that the electron transport becomes faster and electron recombination decreases with the increase in the size of SnO2 octahedra from 0.8 to 1.8 μm. The electron collection efficiency (ηcc = 1 − τd/τr) and the effective electron diffusion length (Ln) are shown in Fig. 9c and d, respectively, revealing the ηcc and Ln increase with the larger octahedra size. Sample I, composed of 40 nm SnO2 nanoparticles, has lower interparticle boundaries and surface defects comparing to the other four samples, showing faster electron transport, slower recombination, higher charge collection efficiency and superior effective electron diffusion length. The detailed IMPS and IMVS parameters (τd, τr, ηcc and Ln) of DSSCs measured under a light intensity of 150 W m−2 were summarized in Table 2. It can be found that τd varied from 1.91 to 1.25 to 0.86 to 0.53 ms as the average length of SnO2 octahedra increased from 0.8 to 1.0 to 1.5 to 1.8 μm, and τd is 0.25 ms for 0.5 μm octahedra. On the other hand, the τr decreases with the SnO2 octahedra increase from 0.8 to 1.0 to 1.5 to 1.8 μm. The ηcc of the samples I, II, III, IV and V are 99.3 92.9, 95.3, 97.8 and 99.0%, respectively. Based on all these results above, the ηlh, ηinj, ηcc, IMPS and IMVS interpreted the short-circuit current density and the overall light conversion efficiency of the SnO2 film with hierarchical structure varied with the different samples, and the sample with SnO2 octahedra of 1.8 μm presents a much better performance.

In summary, well-defined size tunable (0.5–1.8 μm) hierarchical SnO2 octahedra consisting of nanoparticles (30–40 nm) were successfully prepared through optimization of the sonochemical duration, amplitude, Sn source and ratio of DEG:H2O. The effects of the size of the hierarchical SnO2 octahedra on the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs were investigated systematically. The power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs based on the hierarchical SnO2 octahedra films composed of 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 1.8 μm sized octahedra are 5.57%, 5.82%, 6.40%, 6.45% and 6.80%, respectively. The increase of the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with the larger SnO2 octahedra size is ascribed to the higher light scattering ability, faster electron transport and slower recombination.
