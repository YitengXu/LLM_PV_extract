Highly efficient and thermally stable inverted CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and HC(NH2)2PbI3−xBrx (FAPbI3−xBrx) perovskite planar solar cells are demonstrated by using a N,N′-bis(phenylmethyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI-PM)-based electron transporting material (ETM) instead of a conventional fullerene-based phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETM. The MAPbI3 and FAPbI3−xBrx devices with the NDI-PM-based ETM exhibit 18.4% and 19.6% power conversion efficiency under an illumination of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2), respectively, which are comparable to the efficiency of PCBM ETM-based ones (18.9% and 20.0%). The improved thermal stability of NDI-based perovskite solar cells is attributed to much stronger hydrogen bonds in the NDI-PM molecular crystals than the PCBM crystals.

Since Kojima et al. reported liquid junction CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3: X = Br and I) perovskite-sensitized solar cells, intensive studies have been done to develop highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells until now because perovskite materials exhibit unique properties such as high absorptivity, long charge carrier diffusion length, small exciton binding energy, convenient bandgap controllability, and solution processability.

The device structure of perovskite solar cells can be classified into mesoscopic, bi-layer, planar, and meso-super structure types and currently bi-layer and planar type device architectures are mostly being used to obtain high efficiency.
The device architecture is also classified into normal (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structured perovskite solar cells according to which type (n- or p-type) of material is deposited on the transparent conducting electrode. In normal structured bi-layer and planar type perovskite solar cells, n-type electron transporting materials (ETMs) such as TiO2, ZnO, ZnSnO3, and PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) are deposited on FTO (F-doped tin oxide) or ITO (indium tin oxide) transparent electrodes, whereas p-type hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) and NiOx are coated on FTO or ITO transparent electrodes in the inverted structure. Although normal structured perovskite solar cells exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 22% under 1 Sun conditions, they often use PTAA (poly triarylamine) or spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) HTMs with corrosive/hygroscopic additives such as t-BP (tert-butylpyridine) and Li-TFSI (lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), which causes deterioration of the device stability.
On the other hand, inverted structured perovskite solar cells have been known to have better stability, smaller current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and rate, and comparable PCE with normal structured ones. So far, PCBM has been used as the ETM for inverted structured perovskite solar cells.
Docampo et al. reported 6.5% inverted structured perovskite solar cells composed of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/TiOx/Al. You et al. reported 11.5% ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/Al solar cells. We (Im et al.) also reported 18.1% ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/Au inverted structured perovskite solar cells. However, the fullerene-based PCBM ETM has poorer solubility in toluene and dichlorobenzene than PTAA or spiro-OMeTAD HTMs so it is relatively difficult to form a uniform and thick PCBM layer without pin-holes on the perovskite layer by a conventional spin-coating process. In addition, the morphology and crystallinity of the PCBM ETM change with aging time. Therefore, it is challenging to replace the conventional PCBM ETM with a more stable and robust ETM.
Among the organic n-type semiconductors, here we chose the naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based n-type ETM, because NDI-based small molecules are easily synthesized by a low-cost one-step reaction; exhibit high electron mobility over 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, good solution processability with high solubility in various organic solvents, and high thermal and temporal stabilities; and their physical properties and molecular ordering in the crystalline state are controllable by N-substituted side-chains.
Here, we used the non-fullerene NDI-PM (N,N′-bis(phenylmethyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic diimide) ETM instead of the PCBM ETM in inverted structured perovskite planar solar cells and systematically compared their material and device properties.
We choose n-type NDI-PM small molecules with high crystallinity as a model ETM based on semiconducting NDI cores, because N-substituted NDI-based compounds are more cheaply synthesized by a simple reaction and have comparable solubility and electron mobility compared to the conventional PCBM ETM. Their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1(a). For the synthesis of PCBM and its derivatives, a complicated synthetic route (often over three steps) and separation processes for the isolation of various isomers and additional expensive purification processes (e.g., sublimation) are required. On the other hand, NDI-PM is simply synthesized by a condensation reaction of naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride with benzylamine even in the absence of a catalyst. By a recrystallization process in DMF solution, the NDI-PM compound exhibits a high isolated overall yield of about 50% with high-purity, and in this work it is directly used for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells without additional purification processes.
Since the perovskite layer is highly soluble in highly polar solvents such as DMF and DMSO, in inverted type perovskite solar cells, the ETMs should be dissolved in anti-solvents of the perovskite layer such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) or toluene for orthogonal processes. The solubility of NDI-PM in DCB at room temperature is 3 mg mL−1, so it is suitable for deposition by a spin-coating process on the perovskite layer.
Apart from simple synthesis with low cost and suitable solution processability, NDI-PM exhibits a better electron mobility (μ) of 1.7 and 0.72 cm2 V−1 s−1 in thin film transistors based on single crystals and vacuum-deposited films, respectively, than PCBM (∼1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, we expect that NDI-PM exhibits higher temporal stability of electron transport layers compared to PCBM, considering the thermal transition behaviors and strength of intermolecular secondary bonds with molecular packing features in the crystalline state. Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of NDI-PM and PCBM, respectively. The NDI-PM exhibits no phase transition before the melting temperature Tm (269 °C), while a phase transition of PCBM (typically recrystallization by migration) is started at 240 °C, which is remarkably below the melting temperature Tm (279 °C). Moreover, compared to PCBM in the solvent-free crystalline state, the NDI-PM molecules form stronger intermolecular secondary bonds in crystalline states and exhibit a better void shape, which might be better to prevent the migration of constituting molecules in the crystalline layers. Here we fabricate inverted structured perovskite solar cells with the NDI-PM ETM, typically glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite (MAPbI3 or FAPbI3−xBrx)/ETM (NDI-PM or PCBM)/Al.
To compare the DC (direct current) conductivity (σ0) of PCBM, NDI-PM, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3−xBrx (HC(NH2)2PbI3−xBrx), we measured I–V (current–voltage) characteristics as shown in Fig. 1(d). From the equation (I = σ0Ad−1V, where A and d are the sample area (0.16 cm2) and thickness), we obtained the σ0 of PCBM, NDI-PM, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3−xBrx to be 0.0164 mS cm−1, 0.0150 mS cm−1, 0.0148 mS cm−1, and 0.0161 mS cm−1, respectively, because their thickness was 200 nm, 200 nm, 300 nm, and 300 nm, respectively. Therefore, the NDI-PM has a similar conductivity to the PCBM ETM.

Fig. 1(e) and (f) are the transient PL (photoluminescent) decay curves of MAPbI3, MAPbI3/PCBM, and MAPbI3/NDI-PM and FAPbI3−xBrx, FAPbI3−xBrx/PCBM, and FAPbI3−xBrx/NDI-PM, respectively. From the fitting of the transient PL decays with a biexponential function, the average of PL life time (τavg) of MAPbI3, MAPbI3/PCBM, and MAPbI3/NDI-PM is 9.03 ns, 2.42 ns and 4.18 ns, respectively, and FAPbI3−xBrx, FAPbI3−xBrx/PCBM, and FAPbI3−xBrx/NDI-PM is 9.65 ns, 2.96 ns and 3.64 ns, respectively. The PL life time of all samples is summarized in Table S1. Although the charge injection from the perovskite to the NDI-PM ETM is slightly inferior to that of the PCBM ETM, the charge separation/injection is still very effective in both ETMs.

Fig. 2(a) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional image of the representative perovskite solar cell comprised of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite (MAPbI3 or FAPbI3−xBrx)/ETM (NDI-PM or PCBM)/Al. The thickness of the ITO, PEDOT:PSS, perovskite, ETM, and Al was ∼150 nm, ∼50 nm, ∼300 nm, ∼40 nm, and ∼40 nm, respectively. Fig. 2(b) is the corresponding energy band diagram indicating that the generated charge carriers in the perovskite layer are favorably transferred/transported to the ETM and HTM, respectively. Eventually, an ∼40 nm-thick ETM showed the best efficiency under the current experimental conditions as shown in Fig. S1.

Fig. 2(c) and (d) are the J–V (current density–voltage) curves of inverted structured MAPbI3 planar perovskite solar cells with NDI-PM and PCBM ETMs, respectively. The photovoltaic properties of the perovskite solar cells are summarized in Table 1. The NDI-PM-based device has 1.10 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), 21.2 mA cm−2 short-circuit current-density (Jsc), 77.2% fill factor (FF), and 18.0% power conversion efficiency (η) under forward scan conditions and 1.10 V Voc, 21.2 mA cm−2Jsc, 79.1% FF, and 18.4% η under reverse scan conditions, whereas the PCBM-based device exhibits 1.11 V Voc, 21.4 mA cm−2Jsc, 78.8% FF, and 18.7% η under forward scan conditions and 1.11 V Voc, 21.4 mA cm−2Jsc, 79.6% FF, and 18.9% η under reverse scan conditions. The average power conversion efficiency of 40 samples was 16.23 ± 1.24% for NDI-PM and 16.81 ± 1.14% for PCBM-based samples. The relatively high Voc of these devices might be attributed to the formation of quasi-single crystalline perovskite films under the current experimental conditions  because the polycrystalline perovskite film-based n–i–p solar cells exhibited 0.945–0.976 V Voc in our previous report possibly due to the correlation with interface trap densities and Voc. When we applied them to the inverted structured FAPbI3−xBrx planar perovskite solar cells, the NDI-PM-based device exhibited 19.1% and 19.6% η under forward and reverse scan conditions (average η = 17.15 ± 1.22%), respectively, whereas the PCBM-based device had 19.5% and 20.0% η under forward and reverse scan conditions (average η = 17.67 ± 1.10%), respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f). The device statistics of 40 inverted MAPbI3 and FAPbI3−xBrx perovskite solar cells with NDI-PM or PCBM ETMs are shown in Fig. S2.

Fig. 2(g)–(j) are the corresponding EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (Fig. 2(g) and (h)) and FAPbI3−xBrx perovskite solar cells (Fig. 2(i) and (j)). Therefore, the NDI-PM ETM exhibiting good solution processability and high power conversion efficiency (comparable to those of widely used PCBM) is a promising material for fullerene-free perovskite solar cells.
In addition, NDI-PM-based devices exhibited excellent temporal stability, which is superior to that of PCBM-based devices. To check the temporal stability of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with NDI-PM and PCBM ETMs, we stored the unencapsulated devices on a hot plate at 90 °C for 100 min in air under room light with a controlled relative humidity of 40% and compared their efficiency as shown in Fig. 3(a). The NDI-PM-based solar cell exhibited ∼2.5% efficiency degradation compared to its initial efficiency after 100 min heat-treatment, whereas the PCBM-based one showed ∼7.2% efficiency degradation (I–V curves of NDI-PM and PCBM-based devices before and after heat-treatment are shown in Fig. S3). Fig. 3(b) is the AFM (atomic force microscopy) topology images of NDI-PM and PCBM ETMs before (0 min) and after heat-treatment (100 min) indicating that the morphology of the PCBM ETM is changed by the re-crystallization due to the heat-treatment but the morphology of the NDI-PM ETM is not due to its better thermal stability than the PCBM.
The origin of the high temporal stability of perovskite solar cells with the NDI-PM ETM might be related to the strength of intermolecular secondary bonds with molecular packing features in the solid state and additionally higher thermal stability as discussed above. The temporal stability of perovskite solar cells with different ETMs may be attributed to the migration tendency of constituting molecules (NDI-PM and PCBM) in the crystalline layers. The secondary bonds of both crystals are analyzed by Hirshfeld surface analysis with their fingerprints. The crystal structures of NDI-PM and PCBM are obtained from ref. 10 and 13a, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, NDI-PM crystals exhibit much stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds compared to those of PCBM crystals; strongest hydrogen bonds of 2.31 Å for NDI-PM and 2.76 Å for PCBM. In Fig. 4, stronger hydrogen bonds present a more dark red color in the Hirshfeld surface. The relative contribution of O⋯H atom contacts (i.e., hydrogen bonds between O⋯H atoms) in NDI-PM crystals is higher (10.4 and 10.5% for the two conformers) than that in PCBM crystals (2.6%). Therefore, the migration of NDI-PM molecules in the crystalline state with stronger secondary bonds might be more suppressed compared to that of PCBM crystals.
Moreover, the void shape of NDI-PM crystals is more suitable for suppressing the migration of NDI-PM molecules compared to that of PCBM. The characteristics of the void in crystals are analyzed by using the MERCURY program in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).  Although NDI-PM and PCBM crystals exhibit a similar content of void (27 and 25%, respectively), the void shape is remarkably different. As shown in Fig. 5, NDI-PM crystals form a 2-dimensional void structure and the void does not exist on planar NDI cores along the π–π stacking direction (see dotted circles in Fig. 5). In contrast, PCBM crystals form a 3-dimensional void structure; the void exists in all directions of the surrounding of PCBM molecules. The existing void of PCBM in all directions may be accompanying to higher migration tendency compared to NDI-PM crystals. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1(c), no phase transition of NDI-PM crystals before the melting temperature Tm may also suppress the migration of NDI-PM molecules in the crystalline state.

In summary, we demonstrated efficient and thermally stable inverted MAPbI3 and FAPbI3−xBrx perovskite planar solar cells employing a non-fullerene-based ETM, NDI-PM instead of PCBM. The best inverted MAPbI3 and FAPbI3−xBrx perovskite planar solar cells with the NDI-PM ETM exhibited 18.4% and 19.6% under 1 Sun conditions, which are comparable to those of devices with the PCBM ETM (18.9% and 20.0%, respectively). The conductivity of PCBM, NDI-PM, MAPbI3, and FAPbI3−xBrx was 0.0164 mS cm−1, 0.0150 mS cm−1, 0.0148 mS cm−1, and 0.0161 mS cm−1, respectively. The average PL life time (τavg) of MAPbI3, MAPbI3/PCBM, and MAPbI3/NDI-PM is 9.03 ns, 2.42 ns, and 4.18 ns, respectively, and FAPbI3−xBrx, FAPbI3−xBrx/PCBM, and FAPbI3−xBrx/NDI-PM is 9.65 ns, 2.96 ns, and 3.64 ns, respectively. Due to the comparable conductivity and charge separation/injection of the NDI-PM ETM with the PCBM ETM, the NDI-PM-based solar cells exhibited comparable performance to the PCBM-based devices. Furthermore, the NDI-PM ETM exhibited better thermal stability than the PCBM ETM due to its much stronger hydrogen bonds, which is confirmed by the Hirshfeld surface analysis and void structure characterization in the crystals. Accordingly, the NDI-PM-based solar cell exhibited ∼2.5% efficiency degradation compared to its initial efficiency during the thermal stability test which is conducted by putting the unencapsulated devices on a hot plate at 90 °C for 100 min under air atmosphere, whereas the PCBM-based device showed ∼7.2% efficiency degradation. Therefore, we believe that the non-fullerene-based NDI-PM ETM is a very promising ETM to achieve highly efficient and thermally stable inverted perovskite solar cells.
