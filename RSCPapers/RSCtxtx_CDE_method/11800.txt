Bright red CsPbIBr2 films possess intrinsic semitransparent features, which make them promising materials for smart photovoltaic windows, power plants, curtain walls, top cells for tandem solar cells, and bifacial photovoltaics. In this work, bifacial CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been fabricated by adopting an ultrathin silver (Ag) film transparent anode and a tellurium oxide (TeO2) optical modifying layer. The results showed that the transmittance of the TeO2 (40 nm)/Ag (11 nm) transparent top anode matched well with the light absorption range of the CsPbIBr2 film, and the resulting bifacial PSCs exhibited PCEs of 8.04% and 5.32% when illuminated from the FTO and Ag sides, respectively. By introducing cesium iodide-treated CsPbIBr2 layers, the PSCs achieved superior PCEs of 8.46% (FTO side) and 6.40% (Ag side) with a bifacial factor of 75.65%, which is the best performance of bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs reported to date. Interestingly, an identical cell showed a significantly higher fill factor, more efficient carrier transport, and better efficiency and stability when illuminated from the Ag side than from the FTO side, a phenomenon strongly related to the parasitic absorption of the spiro-OMeTAD layer below 420 nm. Consequently, we have found a route similar to “shooting fish in a barrel” to enhance the carrier transport, suppress the carrier recombination, and improve the stability of bifacial semitransparent CsPbIBr2 PSCs: turning the Ag side towards the sun.

Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as the most promising third-generation photovoltaics owing to their rapidly increasing efficiency from 3.8% to 25.2%, low cost, solution processability, and flexibility. Many potential applications are taking these cells from research laboratories to the commercialization stage, such as power plants, photovoltaic windows, curtain walls, and wearable equipment. However, these cost-effective PSCs contain volatile and hygroscopic formamidinium or methylammonium cations, which results in intrinsic instability under photo, heat, and moisture environments and further limits the operation lifetime. One approach to address this instability involves the development of inorganic perovskites by substituting organic ions with inorganic metal cations. Nowadays, many inorganic perovskite materials such as CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2, and CsPbBr3 have been reported to realize efficient inorganic PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 18%.

Among them, CsPbBr3 shows superior stability under complicated environments even for un-encapsulated devices. However, its wide bandgap of about 2.3 eV (ref. 23–26) has limited the absorption edge below 540 nm. Although CsPbI2Br and CsPbI3 possess narrower bandgaps of about 1.92 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively, their stability decreases significantly under high temperature or humidity stresses. In contrast, the inorganic CsPbIBr2 has the most balanced band gap (≈2.05 eV), excellent thermal stability (>460 °C), and steadily improved efficiency and thus, it has attracted more interest from researchers. The main advancements in solution-processed CsPbIBr2 PSCs come from the intermolecular exchange method (9.16%), NH4Cl-modified ZnO interface engineering (10.16%), gradient interface energy band (10.88%), flux-mediated crystal growth (10.82%), and Sn doping strategy (11.33%, 11.53%); also, there is much room for efficiency improvement to the Shockley–Queisser limit of 22.1%.
It is interesting that CsPbIBr2 is always bright red, and its color can be tuned by thickness and components. On the other hand, due to its semitransparency, it has found potential applications, such as smart photovoltaic windows, power plants, curtain walls, top cells for tandem solar cells, and bifacial PSCs. For example, Yang et al. demonstrated semitransparent bright-red CsPbIBr2 films and opaque PSCs with an efficiency of 5.59%. Lin et al. utilized the structural phase transitions in CsPbI3−xBrx and fabricated semitransparent PSCs with an efficiency of 7% to realize thermochromic smart PV windows. Chen et al. reported semitransparent inorganic CsPbBr3/organic four-terminal tandem cells with a record efficiency of 14.03% and superior UV light stability. Li et al. presented bifacial CsPbBr3 PSCs with a bifacial factor of 98.5% (ratio of 7.44% to 7.55%) and superior storage stability in 60% RH over 1000 h by adhering two cells back-to-back with a carbon slurry. In fact, semitransparent or bifacial organic–inorganic halide PSCs have been widely investigated and fabricated by a typical deposition process or novel laminating method. We reported bifacial PSCs with the Ag/TeO2 (or MoO3 or V2O5) transparent top electrodes and achieved an efficiency of 20.96% with a bifacial factor of over 80%. Wang et al. demonstrated bifacial, color-tunable PSCs with a bifacial factor of 93.7% and an equivalent efficiency of 22.1%. Wanget al. and Jaysankaret al. employed semitransparent PSCs to fabricate four-terminal (4T) perovskite/silicon tandem cells with an efficiency of 27%; also, 4T perovskite/gallium arsenide tandem cells with an efficiency of 25.19% and flexible devices were fabricated. Furthermore, bifacial tandem solar cells have been designed to further improve the power output. For example, Asadpour et al. proposed a bifacial Si heterojunction-perovskite tandem solar cell with an efficiency of 33%, while Imran et al. designed a three-terminal, four-junction bifacial cell with a theoretical efficiency of 36%. Lehr et al. further developed bifacial textured tandem modules with a potential efficiency of 38%. All of these devices show the great potential of bifacial PSCs; however, the highly efficient bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs have been rarely reported.
In this work, we fabricated efficient planar bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs by adopting an ultrathin Ag film transparent electrode and an optical modifying layer. Compared with sputtered ITO, the Ag film (about 10 nm) possessed higher conductivity, better mechanical ductility, simpler evaporation process, more moderate deposition conditions, and relatively higher transmittance at the short wavelength region (desired for wide bandgap absorbers). The results showed that by employing a transparent top composite electrode of an Ag film at its percolation-threshold thickness and an outer tellurium dioxide (TeO2) modifying layer and combining with the cesium iodide (CsI) treatment in the one-step formation method of CsPbIBr2, the obtained PSC presented a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.46% when illuminated from the FTO bottom electrode and a PCE of 6.40% when illuminated from the Ag top electrode with a bifacial factor of 75.65%; this is comparable to that of reference PSCs with opaque Ag (or carbon) anodes and is also the best value for bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs reported to date. This indicated that the identical cell showed a significantly higher fill factor, more efficient carrier transport, and better efficiency and stability when illuminated from the Ag side than from the FTO side.


Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic of the fabricated planar bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs, where the typical FTO and an ultrathin Ag film act as the bottom and top transparent electrodes, respectively, and compact TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD act as the electron and hole transport layers, respectively; the TeO2 optical modifying layer located on the outer side of the PSC is used to manage the transmittance of the Ag film and especially, the one-step solution-processed CsPbIBr2 layer can absorb light from both the top and bottom electrodes. Also, the traditional FTO/TiO2/CsPbIBr2/carbon (or spiro-OMeTAD/opaque Ag) PSCs were chosen as the reference devices. The images of the CsPbIBr2 film and bifacial PSCs can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1–S3). Here, we have first analysed the physical characteristics of the samples, and the results are discussed in the following sections.

As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), the CsPbIBr2 film exhibits a full coverage and pinhole-free surface, large grain size (mainly from 300 nm to 500 nm) and few grain boundaries, demonstrating the good crystallinity of the CsPbIBr2 film and excellent repeatability of our intermolecular exchange method.Fig. 1(c) displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbIBr2 film, where the diffraction peaks located at 15.04°, 21.27°, 26.52°, 30.30°, 33.66°, and 37.72° correspond to the perovskite phase with the (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), and (211) crystal planes. This result further proved the good crystal quality of the CsPbIBr2 film. The steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 1(d)) of the CsPbIBr2 film demonstrate a single PL peak at ≈607 nm and no obvious phase separation can be observed. According to the absorption spectra in Fig. 1(e), the fabricated glass/FTO/TiO2/CsPbIBr2/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag sample exhibited good light absorption capacity ranging from 300 nm to 600 nm; its relatively higher absorption below 400 nm and above 600 nm could be attributed to the parasitic absorption in the spiro-OMeTAD and Ag films, respectively. Also, from Fig. 1(f), the extracted optical bandgap is found to be about 2.05 eV, which is in good agreement with the reported values of CsPbIBr2 films processed by the one-step method. In short, all of these optical and physical properties of the CsPbIBr2 film guaranteed good photovoltaic performance of CsPbIBr2 PSCs.
Ag is known as the most commonly used electrode material for polymer and perovskite thin-film solar cells owing to its high conductivity, facile evaporation process, mechanical flexibility, and good adhesion. Furthermore, when the thickness of Ag is reduced to the nanoscale (lower than 20 nm), the metal Ag can transform into a semitransparent film, which can be employed as a transparent electrode. It should be noted that this thickness-dependent transmittance is contradictory to the conductivity of an Ag film. Considering the 3D Volmer–Weber growth, the Ag atoms first aggregate into numerous isolated small islands on the substrate; with the increase in Ag atoms during evaporation, these Ag islands will gradually become larger and eventually interconnect with each other to form a continuous film, and the critical thickness is called as the percolation threshold. Only after reaching this thickness threshold, the Ag film can possess high conductivity. In our laboratory, the thickness threshold of Ag has been proved as 11 nm with a sheet resistance lower than 10 Ω sq−1, and the sheet resistance measured here is 7.875 Ω sq−1 (by a four-point probe setup). Thus, we selected four Ag films with thicknesses of 9 nm, 11 nm, 13 nm, and 15 nm to determine their transmittance. From Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that the 11 nm Ag film exhibits remarkably higher transmittance compared to the thicker 13 nm and 15 nm Ag films. However, for the 9 nm Ag sample, the isolated Ag islands may cause strong surface plasmon resonance in the visible light range and result in an increase in light absorption and decrease in transmittance. Although the 11 nm Ag film shows high transmittance from 300 nm to 400 nm, which is even higher than that for the FTO samples, the relatively poor transmittance at longer wavelengths should be further enhanced. Here, we evaporated a 40 nm TeO2 optical modifying layer on the 11 nm Ag film and the transmittance improved, especially in the range from 500 nm to 600 nm; thus, the transmittance of the TeO2/Ag composite electrode matched well with the absorption range of the CsPbIBr2 layer. The transmittance-modifying mechanism has been confirmed in our previous theoretical calculations and experimental results.
To further verify the effect of Ag thickness on the cell performance, bifacial semitransparent CsPbIBr2 PSCs with various Ag thicknesses have been fabricated and their photovoltaic performance when illuminated from the Ag side can be seen in Fig. 2(b). Obviously, the poorest performance (PCE = 1.47%) of the device with TeO2/Ag (9 nm) mainly originates from poor conductivity as the Ag thickness is lower than its threshold; the lower PCE values (4.22% and 4.86%) of the devices with the TeO2/Ag (13 nm) and TeO2/Ag (15 nm) electrodes can be attributed to their low optical transmittance. At the same time, the cell with the TeO2/Ag (11 nm) electrode obtained a PCE of 5.73%, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.24 V, short circuit current density (JSC) of 6.83 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 66.70%; in contrast, the cell with the pure 11 nm Ag electrode (without TeO2) only achieved a PCE of 3.8% with VOC = 1.18 V, JSC = 5.02 mA cm−2 and FF = 64%. Combined with the discussions based on the 3D growth pattern and optical transmittance, the TeO2/Ag (11 nm) composite film can meet the requirements of the top transparent electrode for bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the JV curves and statistical PCEs of PSCs; their photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1 and their photos can be found in the ESI (Fig. S3). The cell with the TeO2/Ag (11 nm) electrode obtained a PCE of 5.73% when illuminated from the Ag side, with an average PCE of 4.58% (VOC = 1.20 V, JSC = 6.64 mA cm−2, and FF = 64.8%; Fig. S4); in contrast, when illuminated from the FTO side, the best PCE = 8.04% with VOC = 1.28 V, JSC = 11.07 mA cm−2, and FF = 56.80% could be obtained, and the ratio of bifacial PCE, namely, the bifacial factor reached 71.14%. At the same time, the average PCE, VOC, FF, and JSC were 7.32%, 1.25 V, 55.7% and 10.84 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S5). Obviously, the larger JSC value after being illuminated from the FTO side resulted from the higher overall transmittance of the FTO electrode and the parasitic absorption of spiro-OMeTAD at the low wavelength region. Although the illumination directions have no significant influence on VOC, it is worth noting that the cell illuminated from the Ag side presents an obviously larger average FF (64.8% vs. 55.7%), which implies more efficient charge transport and collection processes. Moreover, the larger FF could compensate for the JSC loss and contribute to PCE improvement. This unsymmetrical FF or charge transport behavior will be discussed later. When CsI treatment was introduced during the CsPbIBr2 film formation, the PCEs of bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs were further enhanced to 8.46% (FTO side) and 6.40% (Ag side) with an increased bifacial factor from 71.14% to 75.65%. Here, VOC and FF were nearly unchanged and the increase in PCE mainly stemmed from the improved JSC. The average PCE, VOC, FF, and JSC when illuminated from the FTO (Ag) side were 7.69% (5.42%), 1.18 V (1.16 V), 56.3% (64.2%), and 11.86 mA cm−2 (8.06 mA cm−2), respectively (Fig. S5). This improvement could be understood by the better CsPbIBr2 film quality produced by the CsI treatment; this involves spin-coating a CsI solution onto the surface of the CsPbIBr2 precursor (CsI-PbBr2-DMSO complex) films, during which intermolecular exchange of DMSO with CsI occurs simultaneously due to the higher affinity of CsI species to PbBr2 than to DMSO, and the details can be found in our previous work. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best PCEs of bifacial semitransparent CsPbIBr2 PSCs to date; they are also comparable to that of opaque Ag (PCE = 8.81%) or carbon (PCE = 9.22%)-based CsPbIBr2 PSCs (Fig. S6). However, due to the probable phase segregation in the CsPbIBr2 films induced by light illumination,JV hysteresis occurred (Fig. S7). Additionally, the statistical PCE distributions (Fig. 3a and b) and the steady current density outputs (Fig. 3e and f) at the voltage bias of the maximum power point during 30 min illumination further demonstrated the good repeatability and operational stability of the CsPbIBr2 PSCs.

Furthermore, Fig. 3(c) and (d) provide the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and integrated current densities of the corresponding PSCs. The photocurrent generation of all samples starting at ≈600 nm agreed well with the absorption onset of the CsPbIBr2 film, and the integrated JSC values were very close to the extracted JSC from the JV curves, which confirmed the accuracy of the PV measurements. Then, higher EQEs across the photoactive region of the CsPbIBr2 film with a maximum of 87% (75%) can be observed for the CsI-treated cells illuminated from the FTO side (Ag side); therefore, the corresponding cells achieved larger JSC and higher PCE values. Particularly, when the cell was illuminated from the Ag side, the low EQE values could be attributed to the parasitic light absorption of the spiro-OMeTAD layer below 420 nm. This absorption property has been shown in our previous work and other reports, and a similar EQE loss at a low wavelength has also been reported in tandem PSCs. In other words, this spiro-OMeTAD layer could partly filter the UV light spectra, which may be beneficial to improve the charge transport in the cells. As is well known for the traditional TiO2-based PSCs, the UV light always induces the loss of FF and degradation of PCE. Consequently, it is essential to further investigate the carrier behavior in a bifacial single cell with opposite light illumination directions.
To understand the carrier transport and recombination processes in the PSCs, transient photocurrent and photovoltage (TPC and TPV) tests were carried out. As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), the control cell illuminated from the Ag side delivers significantly faster photocurrent decay (1.52 μs) compared to the cell illuminated from the FTO side (2.26 μs), suggesting the more preferable charge extraction and transport process. Even for the optimized cell, a shorter time of 1.33 μs (1.47 μs) was obtained from the illumination direction of the Ag side (FTO side). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the shorter photovoltage decay time of 408 μs (Ag side) than 336 μs (FTO side) conveyed that the carrier recombination was suppressed more efficiently in a single cell. The same trend can be easily found for the CsI-treated cells. Furthermore from Fig. 3(c), the better performance of the CsI-treated PSCs could be verified by the higher built-in voltage (Vbi) of 1.57 V compared to that of the control device (1.24 V), indicating larger electric-field intensity for boosting the carrier transport and a wider depletion region for suppressing the carrier recombination. This is also in line with the larger Rrec extracted from the Nyquist plots in Fig. 3(d). It is surprising that the much larger Rrec has been acquired when the cell is illuminated from the Ag side, thus supporting the decrease in carrier recombination in the cell. All of them contributed to the higher FF for an identical cell when illuminated from the Ag side. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, for the cell illuminated from the Ag side, its PCE can maintain more than 90% of the initial value for 30 days and only drops by 15% after 40 days, thus indicating better stability than that of the identical cell illuminated from the FTO side. We suggested that the partial absorption of UV spectra by the spiro-OMeTAD layer induced the unsymmetrical FF and PCE degradation rate. Consequently, we found a route like “shooting fish in a barrel” to enhance the carrier transport, suppress the carrier recombination, and improve the stability of bifacial semitransparent CsPbIBr2 PSCs: turning the Ag side towards the sun.

In summary, we fabricated efficient semitransparent bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs with a superior PCE of 8.46% when illuminated from the FTO bottom electrode, a PCE of 6.40% when illuminated from the Ag top electrode, and a bifacial factor of 75.65%. This is the best performance for bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs to date. Here, an ultrathin Ag film at its percolation-threshold thickness has been adopted as the transparent top electrode and the outer TeO2 modifying layer has been used to improve the transmittance of the Ag film to match the absorption of the CsPbIBr2 film; cesium iodide treatment has been utilized to improve the CsPbIBr2 film quality. Particularly, owing to the parasitic absorption (UV filter) of the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the identical cell showed a significantly higher fill factor, more efficient carrier transport, and better efficiency and stability when illuminated from the Ag side than from the FTO side. Therefore, this work provides new insights into bifacial CsPbIBr2 PSCs with an Ag transparent electrode and paves the way for the possible applications of CsPbIBr2 PSCs in smart photovoltaic windows, power plants, curtain walls, tandem solar cells, and bifacial photovoltaics.
