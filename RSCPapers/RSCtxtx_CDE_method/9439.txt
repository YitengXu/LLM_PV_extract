Currently, copper sulfide (CuS) is the most commonly used counter electrode (CE) in high-efficiency quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) because of its superior electrocatalytic activity in the presence of polysulfide electrolyte. For the first time, CuS thin films were prepared by a facile chemical bath deposition method with different concentrations of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and directly used as CEs in QDSSCs without any further post treatment. The quantum dot photoanode with the optimized 0.25 mM PVP-based CuS CE exhibits higher short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.57 mA cm−2, 0.578 V, 0.514, and 5.22%, respectively, which are much higher values than those of a bare CuS CE (Jsc: 12.36 mA cm−2; Voc: 0.591 V; FF: 0.436; PCE: 3.18%) and Pt CE (Jsc: 11.25 mA cm−2; Voc: 0.464 V; FF: 0.296; PCE: 1.54%) under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). Moreover, the 0.25 mM PVP-based CuS CE produces a charge-transfer resistance of only 4.39 Ω with the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte commonly applied in QDSSCs. This value is several orders of magnitude lower than that of a typical Pt electrode (69.75 Ω) and bare CuS electrode (9.27 Ω). This enhancement is mainly attributed to the improved morphology of the 0.25 mM CuS CE with high catalytic activity, which plays a main role in the reduction processes of the oxidized polysulfide electrolyte, as well as the increased sulfur atomic percentage with Cu vacancies. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel polarization were performed to study the underlying reasons behind the efficient CE performance.

Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have received great attention recently for developing next-generation solar cells due to the intriguing properties of the quantum dots (QDs). These properties include hot electron injection, tunable band gaps, large intrinsic dipole moments, high molar extinction coefficients, low cost, and facile fabrication processes. The basic working principle of QDSSCs is similar to that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), in that photo-excited electrons are injected from sensitizers (QDs or dye molecules) into TiO2 nanocrystallites. The electrons flow through an external circuit to a counter electrode (CE), where oxidized redox species generated during the hole-scavenging process are reduced by the electrons. So far, various semiconductor QD sensitizers have been widely studied for QDSSCs, such as CdS, CdSe, InP, InAs, and CIS. However, the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs is still poorer than that of DSSCs due to electrons as a result of charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte and QD/electrolyte interfaces. To date, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.04% has been achieved.

Enormous effort has been devoted to improving the performance of QDSSCs in the past few years, much of which has focused on the optimization and design of CEs and electrolytes. The CE is an important part of solar cells and is responsible for catalysis and reduction of the oxidized redox species. The CE transports electrons from the external circuit to the electrolyte and keeps the cell working. The iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte used in DSSCs is not a suitable candidate for QDSSCs, because it causes photocorrosion to the QDs. Polysulfide solutions can be used to stabilize photoanodes in QDSSCs against photocorrosion and thereby improve the photovoltaic performance.
The widely used platinum (Pt) CE in DSSCs is not suitable for QDSSCs due to its strong chemisorption with sulfur ions, which results in a poisoning effect and poor photovoltaic performance. A cost-effective alternative to Pt with higher electrocatalytic activity and lower charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface is needed. CE materials investigated for the polysulfide electrolyte include CoS, PbS, NiS, and CuS. These materials are used to facilitate the hole capture at the CE and to boost the performance of QDSSCs, since they have a large-area deposition capability. Among them, CuS is the most preferred, since it yields high efficiency, is cost-effective, and has superior electrocatalytic activity and conductivity.
To date, no study has been reported on metal sulfide CEs based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a reagent. We systematically studied metal sulfide CEs using different molar concentrations of PVP to assess their feasibility as electrocatalysts and to elucidate their electrochemical behavior and influence on solar cell performance. We found that the surface morphology and Cu:S ratio are affected by the concentration of PVP. To the best of our knowledge, PVP-dependent electrocatalytic activity for QDSSC applications has not been reported previously. CuS thin films were deposited in a chemical bath with various amounts of PVP. The thin films were used as the CE for QDSSCs, and the photovoltaic performance was found to surpass that achieved in previous work with Pt/CuS, CuS/CoS, and knit-coir-mat-structured CuS, showing an efficiency of 5.22%. The QDSSCs based on the 0.25 mM PVP CuS CE show outstanding stability in working conditions under continuous illumination for over 15 h with a slight decrease in PCE.

TiO2 with a thickness of 7.5 μm, CdS/CdSe QDs, and a ZnS passivation layer were synthesized according to literature methods. The detailed procedure is presented in the ESI. Other experimental details are described below.


All chemicals used to prepare the PVP-based CuS thin films were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification. CE thin films were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using the facile CBD method. Prior to deposition, FTO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 10 min each. Copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) and thioacetamide (C2H5NS) were used as sources of Cu2+ and S2−, respectively, and PVP was used as a reagent.

In 25 mL of DI water, 0.1 M CuSO4·5H2O and 0.125 mM PVP were dissolved and vigorously stirred for 30 min to obtain a transparent solution. Under constant stirring, 0.4 M C2H5NS was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 1 h. The cleaned FTO glass substrates were immersed into the growth solution horizontally and placed in a hot air oven. The deposition was carried out at a constant temperature of 80 °C for 120 min. The PVP concentration was varied to 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, and 0.5 mM, and the experimental procedure was repeated. After 120 min of deposition, the electrodes were cleaned with DI water and ethanol. The CuS films obtained at PVP concentrations of 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, and 0.5 mM were labeled as P-CuS1, P-CuS2, and P-CuS3, respectively.
The bare CuS CE was prepared without PVP concentration at 80 °C for 1 h and is labeled as CuS. When the deposition time for bare CuS was increased beyond 1 h, the CuS started to peel off from the FTO substrate. To fabricate the Pt electrode, the cleaned FTO glass substrate was coated with a Pt paste (Pt-catalyst T/SP, Solaronix) using the doctor blade method and sintered at 450 °C under air for 10 min.

The prepared CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and CEs (CuS and Pt) were sealed using a 25 μm sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The internal space between the electrodes was filled with the polysulfide electrolyte consisting of sodium sulfide (1 M), sulfur (2 M), and sodium hydroxide (0.2 M) in a solution with a 7:3 ratio of methanol to water. Symmetric electrodes of CuS and Pt films were sandwiched between a 25 μm sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C and filled with a redox liquid electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M NaOH in a mixture containing 3 mL of DI water and 7 mL of methanol.


The surface morphology, thickness, and elemental compositions of the electrodes were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) operated at 15 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D8 ADVANCE with a DAVINCI (Bruker AXS) diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. UV-vis spectroscopic analysis was carried out using an OPTIZEN 3220 UV spectrophotometer. The surface roughness of the CuS substrates was characterized by atomic force microscopy (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode. The current–voltage characteristics of QDSSCs were examined under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 were conducted under dark conditions with a symmetrical dummy cell of CuS/CuS and Pt/Pt using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France), with frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 500 kHz. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in a water-based solution containing sodium sulfide (0.1 M), sulfur (0.1 M), and sodium hydroxide (0.01 M) as the support electrolytes. The stability of the CuS electrode was examined under continuous irradiation with an AM 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 in working conditions, and the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were tested every 1 h.


Fig. 1 shows the surface morphology of the different CuS thin-film samples. The degree of adhesion of the electrocatalytic active materials on FTO is a crucial factor in the efficiency of QDSSCs. If the active materials do not stick to the FTO substrate, they may be peeled off and released into the liquid electrolyte, thereby reducing the power conversion efficiency. The CuS thin films were prepared with PVP as the reagent. The surface morphology of the CuS films was greatly influenced by the PVP concentration. The reaction follows the following mechanism:

CuSO4 → Cu2+ + SO42−
(1)
Thioacetamide reacts with H2O and dissociates to give H2S:
CH3 − CS − NH2 + H2O → CH3 − CO − NH2 + H2S
(2)
H2S + H2O → SH− + H3O+
(3)
SH− + H2O → S2− + H3O+
(4)
Cu2+ + S2− → CuS
(5)
Thioacetamide (TAA) firstly coordinates with CuSO4 to produce TAA–copper(II) complexes, which can be observed via a simple color change of the solution. After introducing PVP to the reaction mixture, the Cu2+ ions are also attracted by PVP to form a copper(II)–PVP complex. Under the solvothermal treatment in the presence of DI water, TAA in the solution is decomposed at a certain temperature. So S2− ions are then released through decomposition of TAA and then the dissolved Cu2+ ions react with S2− to form CuS nuclei. In the present study, the effect of PVP was explored by adjusting different amounts of PVP.
The SEM images in Fig. 1(a and a1) show the surface morphology of the bare CuS CE without PVP, indicating nanoflake surface structure. When the PVP amount was added to the bare CuS (0.125 mM), a very thin layer of CuS nanoflakes was successfully grown on the surface of the FTO substrate with a thickness of ∼610 nm (Fig. 1(b and b1)). When the PVP concentration was increased from 0.125 mM to 0.25 mM for P-CuS2, the surface became denser, and the voids in between the nanoflakes were reduced with uniform deposition. The film grew an array of nanoparticles on the surface nanoflakes, and the thickness was ∼621 nm. Increasing the PVP amount from 0.25 to 0.5 mM increased the CuS nanoparticles with nanoflake pores on the surface, and the thickness was measured as ∼639 nm. The nanoflake array films in Fig. 1 exhibit good adhesion to the FTO substrate. The uniformly distributed array of nanoparticles on the surface nanoflakes in P-CuS2 (0.25 mM) can increase the interfacial area between the film and the electrolyte and provide a direct pathway for electron transfer to the back-contact FTO substrate. Interestingly, the chain length of PVP (corresponding to the amount used) plays an important role in forming CuS and controlling the process of the reaction. Also, PVP with a polyvinyl chain that is too long or too short is unfavorable for the formation of CuS nanoflakes.
The crystalline phase of the CuS electrode was characterized by XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 2. The peaks centered around 27.6, 29.2, 31.7, 38.8, 44.3, 47.9, and 52.7 degrees were attributed to the (101), (102), (103), (105), (008), (110), and (108) planes corresponding to the hexagonal CuS (covellite) and match well with JCPDS 06-464. The strong diffraction of FTO is mainly due to the low thickness of the as-synthesized sample without any heat treatment. The XRD result demonstrates that the CuS films on the FTO substrate were successfully prepared.
EDX analysis was employed to semi-quantitatively test the chemical composition of the CuS film on FTO glass, as shown in Fig. 3. The data show that the atomic percentages of Cu and S are 61.48:38.52, 57.09:42.91, 53.61:46.39, and 54.87:45.13 in the bare CuS, P-CuS1, P-CuS2 and P-CuS3 electrodes, respectively. The atomic percentage of S was improved with the addition of PVP in the preparation of CuS. The sulfur content in bare CuS was observed to be 38.52%, and it increased to 46.39% when the PVP amount increased from 0 to 0.25 mM, because PVP acts as a reducing agent to Cu(II) ions resulting in more sulfur ions. However, on increasing the PVP amount from 0.25 mM to 0.5 mM, the PVP does not affect the formation of sulfur more; but, sulfur is depleted in the solution and hence, formation of Ni is much faster than the sulfur, resulting in the less content of sulfur (45.13%). The P-CuS2 film shows a higher atomic percentage of S, which plays a crucial role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE. P-CuS2 is rich in S and has well-arranged CuS nanoflakes with nanoparticle array structures with uniform pores, which allows the electrolyte to diffuse more freely. Upon the addition of 0.5 mM PVP to P-CuS3, the formation of Cu ions is faster than the formation of S ions, which contributes a higher Cu percentage. The EDX results confirmed the formation of CuS on the FTO substrate in the presence of PVP without any other impurities.
To study the surface roughness of PVP varied 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM and 0.5 mM CuS films, high-resolution tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied, and the corresponding 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images are shown in Fig. 4. It was observed that PVP varied 0.125 mM film is smooth and the root mean square roughness (Rrms) was estimated to be 129.7 nm. The values of Rrms of the 0.25 mM and 0.5 mM films are expected to be significantly higher than that of 0.125 mM film and the values are 154.8 and 133.6 nm, respectively. The attractive performances of the 0.25 mM and 0.5 mM films as catalysts on the CE in a QDSSC were also confirmed from the results. Firstly, the CE with the high superficial roughness would enhance its electrocatalytic activity for a polysulfide/sulfide (Sx2−/S2−) or triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) electrolyte system; secondly, the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface would be lower in the cases of 0.25 mM and 0.5 mM film based CEs, because they offer more electrocatalytic active sites for the reaction of polysulfide redox couple in the electrolyte.

Fig. 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra obtained for the electrode thin films over the range of 300–900 nm. The thin films of bare CuS, P-CuS1, P-CuS2, and P-CuS3 electrodes have absorptions at 596, 576, 585, and 657 nm, respectively. The P-CuS3 thin film shows the highest absorption intensity due to its higher thickness. The absorbance increases with increasing concentration of PVP. The absorption in the longer wavelength region was obtained due to the free carrier intraband absorption.
To investigate the catalytic activities of the prepared counter electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a three-electrode system consisting of a working electrode, Pt wire counter electrode, and SCE (saturated calomel electrode) reference electrode with the polysulfide electrolyte (0.1 M Na2S, 0.1 M S, and 0.01 M NaOH) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The resulting CV curves are presented in Fig. 6. The negative and positive peaks of the CV correspond to the reduction of Sn2− and the oxidation of nS2−, respectively. The high current of the peak in the CV indicates an active highly catalytic reaction of the electrode for the S2−/Sn2− redox couples in the polysulfide electrolyte.
The PVP-based CuS electrodes show higher cathodic and anodic peaks compared to the bare CuS and Pt electrodes, indicating that the PVP based CuS electrodes are effective for catalyzing the reduction of the polysulfide redox couple. The lower electrocatalytic activity of the Pt CE in the presence of the polysulfide electrolyte is a result of its irreversibility and overpotential due to physisorption. P-CuS2 shows a higher current peak than electrodes 1 and 3 which indicates that the P-CuS2 has high catalytic activity. P-CuS2 showed a lower overpotential and better invertibility. This indicates the smoothness of the redox reaction of the polysulfide electrolyte on P-CuS2, which produces favorable conditions for the regeneration of the sensitizer. This results from its rough surface morphology caused by the optimized concentration of PVP, as well as the improved carrier concentration enriched by the presence of sulfur ions.
EIS analysis was carried out on the symmetrical dummy cells composed of two identical CEs with the polysulfide redox couple. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 7. The measurement was carried out at an open circuit potential in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–500 kHz with an equivalent circuit used to fit the Nyquist plots. The high-frequency region of the plot shows information about the series resistance (Rs) denoted by the non-zero intercept of the real axis. Rct is the electron transfer resistance at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface, Cμ is the corresponding capacitance, and Zw is the Warburg impedance of the redox electrolyte. These values were obtained by fitting with an equivalent circuit using Z-VIEW software. The obtained values are shown in Table 1.

The Rs values of bare CuS, P-CuS1, P-CuS2, P-CuS3, and Pt were obtained as 8.57, 6.22, 6.08, 6.10, and 8.25 Ω, respectively. The results indicate that the metal sulfide material adheres strongly to the FTO substrate (P-CuS2 > P-CuS3 > P-CuS1 > Pt > CuS). A smaller Rs value means that the catalytic material is more firmly attached to the FTO substrate. Rct is responsible for the charge exchange between the CE and the polysulfide electrolyte. The Rct values of bare CuS, P-CuS1, P-CuS2, P-CuS3, and Pt were calculated as 9.27, 6.74, 4.39, 4.65, and 69.75 Ω, respectively. The low Rct value of P-CuS2 suggests an increased electron transfer rate at the interface of the electrolyte and CuS CE. Pt has the highest Rct value, indicating lower electrocatalytic activity compared to CuS. In addition, the Zw values of the CuS CEs decreased with increased PVP from 0 to 0.25 mM. Increasing the PVP concentration further from 0.25 to 0.5 mM did not show significant improvement in the electrolyte diffusion at the CE/electrolyte interface. The Zw value of P-CuS2 (1.74 Ω) is much lower than those of P-CuS1 (9.73 Ω), P-CuS3 (7.26 Ω), and Pt (27.83 Ω). This is due to the outstanding morphology of the P-CuS2, as shown in the SEM image in Fig. 1. This morphology facilitates fast mass transport. The higher Zw of the Pt CE is due to the poor reduction of the polysulfide redox couple at the CE/electrolyte interface. The low catalytic activity of the Pt is due to the physisorption of S ions onto the Pt surface, which leads to catalytic poisoning.
Tafel polarization measurement was used to investigate the electrochemical activity and the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the polysulfide electrolyte redox couple on the CuS counter electrode surface.Fig. 8 shows the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells with the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of the voltage (V) for the oxidation/reduction of the S2−/Sn2− couple. The catalytic activities of the CEs can be obtained from the exchange current density (J0), which could be obtained by extrapolating the cathodic branch of each curve to the zero overpotential. Thus, the steep gradient of the cathodic and anodic branches was related to J0.
The limiting current density (Jlim) can be derived from the curve in the high potential region. In the Tafel curve, the anodic and cathodic branches of the bare CuS and Pt CE show a lower slope than the CuS CEs prepared at different concentrations of PVP, which results in lower J0 and Jlim values. P-CuS1 and P-CuS3 show decent J0 and Jlim values. The anodic and cathodic slopes of P-CuS2 show larger values than bare CuS, P-CuS1, P-CuS3, and Pt. The elevated slopes of P-CuS2 show a superior J0, which is in good agreement with the EIS values according to eqn (6). The J0 value is inversely proportional to the Rct value obtained in EIS analysis:
(6)
where
Rct is the charge-transfer resistance calculated from the EIS measurement, R is the gas constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte, and F is Faraday's constant.

The Jlim values of the PVP-based CuS electrodes are higher than that of the Pt electrode, which induces a higher diffusion coefficient. A large Zw can be attributed to a low diffusion coefficient (D) value, which induces a low Jlim according to eqn (7):
(7)
where
D is the diffusion coefficient of the polysulfide, l is the electrolyte thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of disulphide at the counter electrode, F is Faraday's constant, and C is the polysulfide concentration. From the Tafel analysis, it is concluded that the appropriate amount of PVP used in the preparation of P-CuS2 can effectively catalyze the polysulfide electrolyte.

To evaluate the catalytic activity of the PVP-based CuS CE on the polysulfide electrolyte, we assembled the obtained CuS CE in a standard cell device with a TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS-photoanode configuration. The J–V characteristics of the QDSSCs with the PVP-based CuS CE under simulated one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 9 and the extracted photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The photovoltaic performance of the PVP-based CuS CEs is much better than that of the device based on the bare CuS and Pt CE. The Pt CE exhibited Voc, Jsc, FF, and η values of 0.464 V, 11.25 mA cm−2, 0.296, and 1.54%, respectively. The low values of the Pt CE are due to poisoning by the polysulfide electrolyte, which leads to lower electrocatalytic activity. Jsc increases from 12.36 to 13.89 to 17.57 mA cm−2 as the amount of PVP increases from 0 to 0.125 mM to 0.25 mM (bare CuS to P-CuS1 to P-CuS2), which can be ascribed to the increasing catalytic active surface area of the CE. Interestingly, upon the addition of more PVP to deposit CuS (P-CuS3), Jsc decreased from 17.57 to 17.00 mA cm−2.

The η values of QDSSCs with bare CuS, P-CuS1 and P-CuS3 were found to be 3.18%, 4.10% and 5.13%, respectively. The photovoltaic performance of the QDSSC based on P-CuS2 shows superior photovoltaic performance than bare CuS, P-CuS1 and P-CuS3 with higher Jsc, and FF values of 17.57 mA cm−2, and 0.514, respectively, and it has the highest η of 5.22%. The higher Voc value (CuS ≫ Pt) could be due to the higher electron density in the conduction band of the TiO2, which raises the Fermi level. The FF values of the cells based on bare CuS (0.435), P-CuS1 (0.506) and P-CuS3 (0.507) are slightly inferior to that of the cell based on P-CuS2 (0.514). The relatively high FF of the cell with P-CuS2 is mainly attributed to the lower series resistance (Rs = 6.08 Ω) than that of the CuS, P-CuS1 and P-CuS3 cells. The improvement in the photovoltaic parameters for P-CuS2 is due to the decreased charge-transfer resistance (4.39 Ω) at the CE/electrolyte interface, internal resistance, reduced recombination, and electrolyte concentration gradient. The increased atomic percentage of S in P-CuS2 plays a major role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE.
EIS plots were employed to investigate the charge transport and recombination in QDSSCs based on the CuS CEs. Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plots obtained for the frequency range of 100 mHz–500 kHz and the Bode phase plots of QDSSCs with the different PVP-based CuS CEs. The equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 10(A) was used to fit the Nyquist plots with Z-View software. In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the non-zero intercept on the real axis of the impedance plot, which denotes the sheet resistance of TCO and the contact resistance of FTO/TiO2. RCE is the electron transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, which is parallel to the corresponding capacitance (CCE) in the high frequency region. Rct is the charge-transfer resistance, which is parallel to the chemical capacitance (Cμ) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface in the middle frequency region. The diffusion resistance Zw in the low frequency region was obtained directly from the fit. The parameters obtained from the EIS analysis are summarized in Table 2.
The QDSSCs fabricated using P-CuS2 exhibit the lowest RCE value of 1.43 Ω, which is lower than the values for bare CuS (1.76 Ω), P-CuS1 (1.56 Ω), P-CuS3 (1.52 Ω), and Pt CE (27.13 Ω), suggesting that P-CuS2 greatly enhances the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface. The low RCE and Zw of the PVP-based CuS CEs indicate faster electron transport at the CE/electrolyte interface. The high chemical capacitance of the QDSSC based on P-CuS2 (Cμ = 2452 μF) is mainly related to the collection of more photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode due to low recombination. In contrast, the QDSSC based on the Pt CE exhibits a very high RCE (27.13 Ω), which results in lower efficiency (1.54%). The high Zw value (18.6 Ω) is due to the catalytic poisoning of the CE with the polysulfide redox couple, making it unstable and reducing the FF of the QDSSC.

Fig. 10(B) shows the Bode phase plots of QDSSCs based on CuS CEs with different concentrations of PVP. The lifetime (τ) of electrons in the device based on CuS CEs can be estimated from the maximum frequency of the peak:
(8)
The larger values of τ suggest that electrons have a longer lifetime and diffusion rate in the device, enabling the QDSSCs to achieve a higher overall photoconversion efficiency. As shown in Table 2, the lifetime of the electrons (τ) firstly increased from 10.34 ms to 23.06 ms (bare CuS to P-CuS2) with the increase of PVP concentration from 0 to 0.25 mM, and then it decreased to 17.64 ms for the 0.5 mM PVP (P-CuS3). This can be explained by the fact that the nanoflakes with nanoparticle arrays gained a well-crystallized and high-quantity single-crystal structure with greater PVP concentration (P-CuS2). These features are helpful for increasing the electron diffusion rate, resulting in improved efficiency of the QDSSCs. The lower electron lifetime of the Pt CE is due to the better recombination of the injected electrons with the polysulfide redox couple, which tends to reduce the electron lifetime of electrons. Among the investigated samples, P-CuS2 exhibits a lower charge-transport resistance and higher electron lifetime, which contribute to the superior photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs.
The recombination mechanism of QDSSCs based on CuS and Pt CEs was further investigated by open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. OCVD analysis can reveal the electron recombination kinetics of QDSSCs. Fig. 11 shows OCVD characteristics of the QDSSCs with different PVP-based CEs, where the rate of the voltage reduction indicates electron lifetime in the cell. The Voc decay of the QDSSC with P-CuS2 decays more slowly than that of the devices with CuS, P-CuS1, P-CuS3, and Pt, which suggests that P-CuS2 has superior electron lifetime in the QDSSC. The slower electron recombination kinetics indicates that many electrons survive from the reverse reaction, which is conducive to enhancement of Voc and Jsc. With 0.25 mM PVP, the electron lifetime increased and then decreased, which is in agreement with the J–V analysis.
After J–V measurement the P-CuS2 based QDSSC was stored for 24 hours and the stability of the QDSSC based on P-CuS2 was investigated under continuous light illumination for 15 h, and Fig. 12 shows the extracted photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and η). It is clear that the improvement of photovoltaic parameters in the first 4 h is due to a capillary effect involving slow polysulfide redox solution permeation into the TiO2 pores and enhanced ionic transport due to heating of the electrolyte. During the measurements, the Voc values remain constant at 0.587 V. There is a slight decline in Jsc from 14.75 to 13.20 mA cm−2, along with little fluctuations in Voc (0.587 V) and improved FF (0.52 to 0.533) in the course of 15 h of illumination. The gains in Voc and FF compensate for the loss of Jsc, resulting in almost constant efficiency during illumination (4.57 to 4.14%). The superior photovoltaic performance of P-CuS2 is attributed to the improved electrocatalytic activity due to the increase in atomic percentage of S. The increased percentage increased the Cu vacancies with improved conductivity, enabling better reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte, better surface morphology with well-aligned uniform array nanoparticles with nanoflakes, and improved charge-transfer processes at the CE/electrolyte interface.
The photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs with the different CEs were compared and discussed based on the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, as shown in Fig. 13. The QDSSCs were prepared with the same configuration and polysulfide electrolyte. Fig. 13(a) shows that the P-CuS2 provides a lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, which is very close to that of P-CuS3, slightly lower than that of P-CuS1 and bare CuS and several orders of magnitude lower than that of the Pt CE. The lower Rct in P-CuS2 suggests much enhancement of the charge transfer, which would improve the electron flow from the external circuit to the CuS/electrolyte interface. Hence, the reduction processes of the oxidized polysulfide would be improved. Rct has a significant impact on the performance of the QDSSCs based on CuS CEs. As shown in Fig. 13(b–d), the Jsc, FF, and PCE values of the Pt are the lowest, and those of the device based on P-CuS2 are the highest. These values increase as Rct decreases. Higher photovoltaic performance and low internal resistance were observed for the PVP-based CuS CEs, which is in accordance with the solar cell performance results.

A novel solution-process method for fabricating CuS on the FTO substrate was demonstrated using various concentrations of PVP. The surface morphology of the CuS thin film is greatly influenced by the concentration of PVP. The CuS CEs were fabricated by a fast, reproducible CBD method and were superior to the Pt CE. The S atomic percentage in CuS and the morphology varied drastically with the different concentrations of PVP, which affected the solar cell efficiency. The Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE values of bare CuS to P-CuS2 shifted from 12.36 mA cm−2 to 17.57 mA cm−2, 0.591 V to 0.578 V, 0.435 to 0.514, and 3.18% to 5.22%, respectively. The CuS CE obtained with 0.125 mM PVP did not effectively catalyze the polysulfide reduction at the CE/electrolyte interface, which resulted in lower Jsc (13.89 mA cm−2), Voc (0.583 V), FF (0.506), and PCE (4.10%). The elevated performance of the QDSSCs can be attributed to the reduction of Rct with P-CuS2 in comparison to P-CuS1 and P-CuS3. Moreover, P-CuS2 showed good stability for over 15 h of operation, which is a serious challenge for CuS CEs. The presented preparation method and characterization of PVP-based CuS CEs in QDSSCs will help us to design and fabricate highly effective QDSSCs in the near future.
