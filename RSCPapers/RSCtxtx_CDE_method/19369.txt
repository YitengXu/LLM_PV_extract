One of the significant factors that limit efficiencies of organic solar cells (OSCs) is their large energy loss (Eloss), especially the high nonradiative recombination energy loss (ΔEnr). Herein, an acceptor named NQF with an asymmetric and extended conjugation central core has been designed and synthesized. Compared with Y6, NQF exhibits upshifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels and a higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The OSC based on PM6:NQF demonstrates a ΔEnr as low as 0.177 eV and thus a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.57%. In contrast, the control device PM6:Y6 gives a PCE of 16.45% with a ΔEnr value of 0.231 eV. This work achieves molecular design with low ΔEnr and demonstrates that the Eloss of OSCs can be effectively reduced through rational and delicate molecular design.

With the innovation of active layer materials, device optimization, and understanding of the mechanism, organic solar cells (OSCs) have witnessed great progress in the past decade and achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 19%. However, there is still a large gap between the PCEs of OSCs and other photovoltaic cells such as crystalline silicon and perovskite cells. One of the most significant factors that limit the PCEs of OSCs is the large energy loss (Eloss), which originates from radiative loss and nonradiative loss. Since the radiative loss above the bandgap is unavoidable and the radiative loss below the bandgap can be smaller than 0.10 eV for current nonfullerene acceptor based OSCs, to reduce the nonradiative loss thus has become the main strategy and focus for minimizing Eloss in organic photovoltaic devices. To date, most OSCs show nonradiative loss over 0.30 eV with few examples in the range 0.20–0.30 eV, which is remarkably larger than that of silicon or perovskite solar cells. In recent years, the study of nonradiative loss has become an important topic in the OSC community. Although the detailed mechanism behind it is still not clear, some valuable results have been reported based on experimental and theoretical studies. For example, Bredas and Gao et al. reported that the nonradiative loss can be decreased by reducing the energy offset between the donor and acceptor and/or enhancing the luminescence efficiency of the low band gap component in the active layers. Clearly, to minimize the nonradiative loss, the design of active layer materials always plays a crucial role.

In fact, in the past decade, the progress of OSCs was significantly driven by the invention of new active layer materials. Among them, molecules including donors and acceptors with the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture have demonstrated great success. Presently, the rapid development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with A–D–A structures such as ITIC, Y6 and their analogues and derivatives has boosted the efficiencies of OSCs to a remarkable level. However, it is still a challenge to design active layer materials to address the concerns of energy loss, especially the nonradiative loss in the OSC community. As one of the most successful acceptors, Y6 has a unique banana-like configuration, which enables it to form an intense three-dimensional (3D) framework with efficient charge transport channels and achieves a PCE of around 16% for binary devices with Eloss ∼ 0.55 eV and nonradiative loss ∼0.22 eV. To further improve device efficiencies, many studies have been conducted on the structural modification of Y6 on the side chains, end groups, and molecular backbones. With the structural modifications, the molecular absorptions, energy levels and packing modes can be finely tuned, and corresponding devices with improved efficiencies over 19% have been achieved. However, to the best of our knowledge, Eloss values for the vast majority of the reported devices of Y6 derivatives are still higher than 0.5 eV, as they mainly suffer from the large nonradiative energy loss over 0.2 eV. Thus, it is still a challenging work to minimize the nonradiative loss via careful molecular design.
Herein, we design and synthesize an acceptor NQF, 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((16,17-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-10-oxo-3,13-diundecyl-16,17-di-hydro-10H-indeno[1,2-b]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′-,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-f]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-h]quinoxaline-2,14-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile, which has an asymmetric and extended conjugation central core compared with Y6 (Fig. 1a). The asymmetric and extended conjugation central core can increase the dipole moment of the acceptor and strengthen the rigidity of the molecule, which is expected to exhibit high luminescence efficiency and thus low nonradiative energy loss. The binary device based on PM6:NQF shows a PCE of 17.57% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.921 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 25.79 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.96%. In contrast, the control device PM6:Y6 gives a PCE of 16.45% with a Voc of 0.849 V, a Jsc of 25.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.56%. It is worthy of note that the higher efficiency of the NQF based device comes from its low energy loss of 0.504 eV with a remarkably low nonradiative loss of 0.177 eV, both of which are smaller than those of PM6:Y6 with the values 0.551 and 0.231 eV, respectively. These results highlight that it is a molecular design with low nonradiative recombination loss and demonstrate that the Eloss of OSCs can be effectively reduced through a rational and delicate molecular design.

The synthetic route of NQF is shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI. The key intermediate compound 3 with the asymmetric backbone was synthesized via two steps. First the reduction of compound 1 by LiAlH4 yielded compound 2. Then compound 2 without further purification reacted with the commercially available 4,5-difluoro-1,2-phenylenediamine directly by a condensation process to offer compound 3. The subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reaction afforded the corresponding dialdehyde compound 4 in high yield (75%). Finally, the targeted molecule NQF was synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation between compound 4 and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2F-IC). The detailed synthesis procedures and characterization including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra are provided in the ESI.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of NQF and Y6 are displayed in Fig. 1b and S1 (ESI), respectively. NQF and Y6 exhibit maximum absorption peaks at 728 nm and 733 nm in chloroform solution, and 801 and 820 nm in the film state, respectively. In contrast to their solution absorptions, the solid film absorptions of NQF and Y6 are red-shifted by 73 nm and 87 nm, respectively. Compared with Y6, NQF exhibits blue shifted absorption in solid film owing to their different packing modes. As shown in Fig. 1e, NQF shows two-dimensional (2D) arrangement via π–π stacking, however, Y6 shows a 3D network in a single crystal structure. The UV-vis spectra of the two blend films PM6:NQF and PM6:Y6 are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI). It can be found that the two blend films show two peaks corresponding to PM6 and the acceptors. Clearly, in the acceptor absorption range, a slight blue shift is observed for NQF compared with Y6, which is consistent with their neat films. The solubilities of Y6 and NQF in chloroform were measured by the UV-vis method and the results are listed in Table S1 (ESI). The solubility of NQF in chloroform is about 389.26 mg mL−1, which is significantly higher than that of Y6 in chloroform (47.68 mg mL−1). The energy levels of NQF were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). From the onset reduction and oxidation potentials of the CV curves (Fig. S3, ESI), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of NQF were estimated to be −3.87 and −5.62 eV, respectively, which are all upshifted compared with those of Y6 after introducing the asymmetric central unit (Fig. 1c). The upshifted energy levels of NQF should decrease the energy offset with PM6 and thus a higher Voc with suppressed radiative loss is expected according to the results reported by Gao et al.
The single crystal of NQF was obtained by diffusing methanol into the chloroform solution of NQF. The related parameters of NQF X-ray data are listed in Table S2. As shown in Fig. 1d, NQF exhibits a banana-like configuration with the non-covalent S–O interaction to form conformational locks. The twist angles between the end groups and core of NQF are 1.56° and 2.99°, indicating the good planarity of the acceptor. Unlike the single crystal structure of Y6 with the 3D network, NQF shows two-dimensional (2D) arrangement via π–π stacking in the crystal and forms square-shaped voids with a side length of ∼18.3 × 19.5 Å (Fig. 1e). The crystal structure of the NQF molecule exhibits three types of intermolecular packing modes with intense π–π stacking (Fig. 1f–i), i.e. the end group to end group mode (“E/E” mode), dual end group to the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit mode (“dual E/b” mode) and dual central unit to the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit mode (“dual C/b” mode). NQF demonstrates end group to end group π–π stacking (J-aggregation) with a distance of 3.35 Å (Fig. 1g), which is compared with that of the single-crystal of Y6.

The OSC devices with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:NQF/PDINO/Ag (Fig. 2a) were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of NQF. The wide-bandgap polymer PM6 was selected as the donor owing to its matching energy levels and complementary absorption with NQF. Detailed device fabrication and optimization conditions are provided in Table S3 (ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices together with PM6:Y6 for comparison are illustrated in Fig. 2b, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The optimized device based on NQF gave a high PCE of 17.57% with a notably high Voc of 0.921 V, a Jsc of 25.79 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.96%. In contrast, the control device PM6:Y6 showed a PCE of 16.45% with a Voc of 0.849 V, a Jsc of 25.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.56%. Clearly, these two types of devices have rather comparable Jsc and FF but significantly different Voc. The enhanced efficiency of the device based on NQF is thus ascribed to its remarkably larger Voc mainly owing to the small energy loss as will be discussed below. As shown in Fig. 2c, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two devices featured high photon responses covering the range of 300 to 900 nm. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE curves of the devices based on NQF and Y6 are 24.86 mA cm−2 and 24.99 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves.

The OSC based on NQF shows a notably high Voc of 0.921 V compared with that of the device based on Y6 with a value of 0.849 V. To investigate the reason behind it, the detailed Eloss analysis was conducted. The Eloss values of the two devices were calculated using the equation Eloss = Egap − qVoc, where the Egap values were estimated by the intersections between the absorption and emission spectra of the low bandgap component NQF and Y6 (Fig. S6, ESI). As summarized in Table 2, the OSC based on NQF exhibited a Eloss of 0.504 eV, which is remarkably lower than that of PM6:Y6 with the value of 0.551 eV and among the lowest Eloss values for high efficiency OSCs. Next, the detailed Eloss components were investigated following the reported methods. In OSCs, the Eloss can be divided into three parts: Eloss = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3, where ΔE1 is the radiative recombination loss above the bandgap, ΔE2 is the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap and ΔE3 is the nonradiative energy loss. According to the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory, ΔE1 is unavoidable for any type of solar cells and is generally 0.25–0.3 eV. Here, the device PM6:NQF shows the ΔE1 value of 0.264 eV, comparable with that of the Y6 based device (0.262 eV). ΔE2 can be calculated according to the following equation: ΔE2 = q(Voc,sq − Voc,rad), where Voc,sq is the maximum Voc according to the SQ theory.Voc,rad is the Voc when there is only radiative recombination in the OSC, which can be determined by highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) and EL measurements (Fig. 3a and b, the details for the determination of Voc,rad are presented in the ESI). The third part ΔE3, also named nonradiative recombination energy loss (ΔEnr), is the determined factor of energy loss for OSCs, which originates from the nonradiative decay of the charge transfer states and recombination of free charges. ΔE3 can be calculated from the EQE of EL (EQEEL) following the equation ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL). As illustrated in Fig. 3c and summarized in Table 2, the device based on NQF exhibits about one order higher EQEEL (8.4 × 10−4) than the Y6 based device (9.60 × 10−5), corresponding to a notably smaller ΔE3 value of 0.177 eV. To our knowledge, it is the lowest nonradiative energy loss for binary OSCs with PCE over 17% (Fig. 3d, detailed published statistics as shown in Table S4 in the ESI).

According to the research results reported by Bredas and Gao et al., the photoluminescence efficiencies of the pristine material components define the limit of ΔVnr in organic solar cells, and the higher photoluminescence efficiency of the low band gap component in the active layer favors a lower ΔVnr. In our case, NQF shows a higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (5.92%) than Y6 (4.77%) (Fig. 3e and S7, ESI). In addition, the EQEEL values of corresponding pure-phase devices were also measured (Fig. S8, ESI). The NQF based device exhibits a much higher EQEEL (6.7 × 10−4) than the Y6 based device (1.2 × 10−4), which is consistent with the higher photoluminescence efficiency of NQF. The higher PLQY of NQF should originate from its asymmetric and extended conjugation structure. According to the theoretical calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, the asymmetrical structure of NQF possesses a stronger electrostatic charge distribution difference in the asymmetrical central core, leading to a higher dipole moment, 3.13 debye for NQF vs. 1.06 debye for Y6 (Fig. 3f). The higher dipole moment for NQF can enhance J-aggregation in the solid film. This is consistent with the results in the single crystal and GIWAXS. The enhanced J-aggregation favors high luminescence efficiencies according to the established results in the organic optoelectronics. In addition, the EL values of the pure NQF and Y6 film were also measured. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI), the EL spectra of pure NQF and Y6 nearly overlapped with their corresponding blending films with PM6, especially for the NQF system.

The properties of the charge transport, exciton dissociation and charge generation of the two devices based on NQF and Y6 were studied side by side for comparison. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the charge mobilities of the blend films of PM6:Y6 and PM6:NQF. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI), the electron/hole mobilities were calculated to be 5.00 × 10−4/3.31 × 10−4 and 4.39 × 10−4/1.52 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for the PM6:Y6 and PM6:NQF based devices, respectively. The comparable values of electron mobilities for the two devices indicate that the PM6:NQF based device has similar charge transport ability to that of the Y6 based device. Furthermore, in order to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge generation properties, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured for the two devices (Fig. S11, ESI). The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), calculated from Jph under the short-circuit conditions divided by the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat), were 96.21% and 96.47% for NQF and Y6 based devices, respectively, demonstrating the highly efficient exciton dissociation for the two devices. To study the behavior of charge recombination of the two devices, the plots of light-intensity dependence (P) of Jsc (Jsc ∝ Pα), where the exponent α being close to 1 reflects a weak bimolecular recombination, were measured and are displayed in Fig. S12 (ESI). The Jsc values of NQF and Y6 based devices were highly linearly correlated with P, with the α values of 0.982 and 0.989, respectively, illustrating that the two devices based on NQF and Y6 all showed efficient charge dissociation and less bimolecular recombination.


The morphologies of PM6:NQF together with PM:Y6 for comparison were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As illustrated in Fig. S13 (ESI), the two blend films showed smooth surface morphologies with fibrillar networks. The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values are 1.22 and 1.05 nm for NQF and Y6 based blend films, respectively. The interpenetrating network with nanoscale phase separation could also be seen in the TEM images (Fig. S14, ESI). The results indicate that the structural modulation of Y6 via introducing the asymmetric core could yield favorable morphology like the Y6 based blend film.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the molecular stacking and orientation of NQF and its blend film with PM6. As shown in Fig. 4, the neat film of NQF shows a clear lamellar stacking peak at 0.46 Å−1 with a d spacing of 13.78 Å and a strong π–π stacking diffraction peak (010) at 1.73 Å−1 with a d spacing of 3.63 Å in the out of plane (OOP) direction, indicating a face-on orientation. Compared with the pattern parameters of Y6 measured under the same conditions (Table S5, ESI), NQF has a relatively smaller CCL both in the (010) OOP and (100) IP directions, which indicates a slightly weak crystallinity and is consistent with the crystal packing modes of Y6 and NQF. The blend films of PM6:NQF and PM6:Y6 all exhibit a face-on orientation with strong π–π stacking diffraction peaks (010) in the OOP direction and lamellar diffraction peaks (100) in the IP direction. The π–π stacking d spacing in PM6:NQF is 3.65 Å, comparable with that in the blend film of Y6 (3.61 Å). As shown in Table S5, compared with that of PM6:Y6, the blend film of NQF shows a relatively smaller CCL with a value of 21.01 Å in the (010) OOP and slightly larger CCL with a value of 92.70 Å in the (100) IP direction.

In summary, we designed an acceptor NQF with an asymmetric and extended backbone. Compared with Y6, NQF exhibits upshifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which reduces the energy offset with the PM6 donor. Meanwhile, NQF shows a higher PLQY owing to its asymmetric, extended and rigid conjugation structure. Thus, PM6:NQF based OSC demonstrates a high EQEEL of 8.39 × 10−4, corresponding to a nonradiative energy loss as low as 0.177 eV. With this, the OSCs based on PM6:NQF achieved a PCE of 17.57% with a significantly higher Voc of 0.921 V and almost the same Jsc and FF compared with the control Y6 based device. Our results show the very promising role of acceptors with an asymmetric and extended conjugation core and its impacts on the molecular packing, luminescence properties and nonradiative energy loss. This might offer some new opportunities to design high-efficiency materials with low nonradiative loss. It is also believed that the nonradiative energy loss in OSCs can be further reduced via chemical structure modification of the active layer materials, and OSCs with efficiencies comparable to those of inorganic solar cells can be realized in the near future.
