Liquid electrolyte DSSCs using 100% water as the solvent and I−/I3− as the redox couple were fabricated. The effect of ionic surfactants on water based DSSCs was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and contact angle measurements. Addition of surfactant to the aqueous electrolyte improved the interfacial contact between the aqueous electrolyte and the TiO2 films while decreased the interface recombination resistance. With the addition of 0.2 wt% of N,N,N-trimethyl-3-(perfluorooctylsulfonamido)propan-1-aminium iodide (FC-134) in the aqueous electrolyte, average overall power conversion efficiencies of 3.96% and 4.66% were obtained under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively. These results show a feasible scheme towards the fabrication of greener and more efficient aqueous DSSCs.

As a renewable energy technology, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with high energy conversion efficiency have been intensively studied due to their high efficiency, potential low cost and easy fabrication. Recently, a power conversion efficiency of up to 11% has been achieved using the traditional iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple as a redox mediator. However, most of the DSSCs reported are usually fabricated with organic solvent electrolytes, which are generally hazardous and more or less flammable. Compared with organic solvents, water is earth abundant, inexpensive and non-toxic which could be a good candidate to replace organic solvents for liquid electrolyte DSSCs.

Recently, 100% water based DSSCs have been studied by several groups. For example, water based liquid electrolyte DSSCs with an efficiency of 2.4% were achieved under 1 sun light illumination using the I−/I3− redox couple. The efficiency of the device was further increased to 4.06% by the same group. In addition to the “traditional” I−/I3− redox couple, water soluble redox couples, such as thiolate/disulfide, ferricyanide/ferrocyanide and cobaltII/III tris(2,2′-bipyridine), have also been studied in water based DSSCs. However, the efficiencies of 100% water based DSSCs are still lower compared with those of organic solvent electrolyte DSSCs, probably due to incomplete wetting of the aqueous electrolyte/dye-coated TiO2 film interface which therefore reduces the cross-sectional area for ion diffusion. To circumvent the drawbacks, non-ionic surfactants, such as Triton-X100 (ref. 12) and Tween-20 (ref. 13), and polyethylene glycol have been utilized to improve the electrolyte/dye-coated TiO2 film interface. In general, addition of a surfactant could increase the electrolyte wettability, and minimize the phase separation between the aqueous electrolyte and the dye-coated TiO2 film. However, other studies conflicted with the above and suggested that the introduction of an anionic surfactant, sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT), increased the hydrophobicity of the dye-coated TiO2 film by preventing water from approaching the dye and reducing the recombination rate. So what is the effect of surfactants on water based DSSCs? The reported findings pushed us to analyze the interface properties of TiO2 films and surfactant doped water electrolytes.
Here, a variety of ionic surfactants were applied to 100% water electrolytes. The interface properties of the aqueous electrolyte/dye-coated TiO2 film were examined by density-voltage (J–V) measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and contact angle measurements. The presence of ionic surfactants dramatically reduced the contact angle of aqueous electrolytes on the dye-coated TiO2 film, and therefore decreased the interface recombination resistance. With the addition of 0.2 wt% of N,N,N-trimethyl-3-(perfluorooctylsulfonamido)propan-1-aminium iodide (FC-134) in an aqueous electrolyte, the fabricated device exhibited an average overall power conversion efficiency of 3.96% and 4.66% under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively. In addition, the optimized thickness of the TiO2 film is also studied to improve the efficiency of the devices.

Iodine (I2) and guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. H2PtCl6 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium iodide (NaI), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB), and sodium 1,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) were purchased from Aladdin. N,N,N-trimethyl-3-(perfluorooctylsulfonamido)propan-1-aminium iodide (FC-134) and perfluorooctane sulfonate triethylammonium (FK-1) were purchased from Wuhan Yangtze river fluorine technology Co. LTD (China). cis-Bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium (II) (N719) was purchased from Solaronix SA (Switzerland). All the reagents were used as received without further purification. Water was deionized using a MILLIPORE MILLIPAK 40 (resistivity: 18.2 MΩ cm @19 °C). Fluorine doped tin oxide overlayer (FTO) glass electrodes (7 Ω per sq) and slurries with 20 nm sized mesoporous TiO2 colloids were purchased from Yingkou Opvtech New Energy Co., Ltd (China).


Fabrication of DSSCs was as documented in the previous literature. The cleaned FTO glass was covered with perforated 3M® adhesive tape to control the thickness and area of the mesoporous TiO2 film (∼0.283 cm2). Then a film (∼5.1 μm) with 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto cleaned FTO glass and used as a photoelectrode by the doctor-blade technique. The thicker TiO2 film (∼13.3 μm) was obtained by covering two layers of tape and thinner one (∼3.1 μm) by diluting the commercial TiO2 paste with the equal mass of terpinol. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in an acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, volume ratio) solution containing dye-N719–CDCA (1:100, molar ratio) for 20 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the dye-coated TiO2 films were washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. For the preparation of the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min. Sandwich type cells were fabricated by assembling the dye-coated TiO2 photoanode and Pt-counter electrode, which were sealed with a 25 μm Surlyn sealant (DuPont). The aqueous electrolytes were injected via 0.8 mm holes drilled through the counter electrode using a vacuum backfilling system. Finally, holes were sealed with Surlyn sheets and thin glasses by heat pressure treatment.


The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were tested using a CHI660c electrochemical workstation using the AC impedance method, the frequency ranged from 0.01–105 Hz under dark conditions and the amplitude was 5 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The Mott–Schottky plots were tested using a CHI660c electrochemical workstation. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminum foil mask with an aperture area of 0.1 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 15, 50, and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The contact angle measurements were performed on a video-based optical goniometer (OCA15 plus, DataPhysics Instruments, Filderstadt, Germany) using the sessile drop method. All sample devices were measured three times and the data were averaged.



Table 1 shows the compositions of aqueous electrolytes applied in this work. Here, both anionic (such as AOT and FK-1) and cationic (such as CTAB and FC-134) surfactants were introduced into the aqueous electrolyte. The effect of surfactants on the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs was investigated. Fig. 1 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated with aqueous electrolytes. The photovoltaic parameters including the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the fill factor (FF), and the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs with aqueous electrolytes are summarized in Table 2. The control electrolyte (E-1, without a surfactant in the electrolyte) showed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.50 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.51 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.66 and a PCE value of 2.51%. Addition of surfactants to the aqueous electrolytes dramatically improves the photovoltaic parameters of the devices. For example, the aqueous electrolyte E-4 with the fluorinated anionic surfactant (FK-1) renders a Jsc of 10.01 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.51, a FF of 0.70, and a PCE value of 3.55%. However, it should be noted that no significant differences between anionic and cationic surfactants (such as E-2 and E-3, E-4 and E-5) on the device performance were observed, indicating that both anionic and cationic surfactants could effectively improve the interface properties of the aqueous electrolyte/dye-coated TiO2 films and therefore improve the photovoltaic parameters of the devices.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then applied to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes of the devices, especially for understanding the recombination dynamics at the dye-coated TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte.Fig. 2 shows the capacitance (C2), charge-transfer resistances at the photoelectrode/electrolyte (Rct2), the effective lifetime of electrons (τe) before the recombination in the TiO2 photoelectrode with respect to the applied potential. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the surfactant added electrolytes have higher charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface than that of the pure aqueous electrolyte, indicating the higher charge-transfer resistance (Rct2) at the dye-coated TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface of the surfactant added electrolytes. The reduced charge recombination is due to the enhanced interface connection by addition of the surfactants. The higher the value of Rct2, the slighter the charge recombination at the dye-coated TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface.

Fig. 2b shows the capacitance (C2) of the devices. The surfactant doped aqueous devices exhibited the approximate same values as that of the pure aqueous electrolyte, suggesting that the addition of the surfactant did not shift the TiO2 conducting band (CB) edge. The data of the electron lifetime (τe = Rct2C2) are calculated and shown in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that the electron lifetime of the aqueous devices added with surfactants was increased compared with the device based on the pure aqueous electrolyte. These results indicate that the surfactants added to the aqueous electrolyte suppress the charge recombination rate of the aqueous DSSCs, which favours the electron transport through a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance and leading to enhanced photoconversion efficiency as the result. These results are consistent with the results of device characterization above.
The obtained results were further supported by the Mott–Schottky plots as shown in Fig. 3. The conducting band edge for devices with surfactant added electrolytes is similar to that with pure aqueous electrolytes. It is known that recombination occurs predominantly at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, which will influence the electron lifetime (τe) up to the device performance.
Modification of interfacial contact can also be studied by contact angle measurements, as depicted in Fig. 4. Compared with the contact angle of the pure aqueous electrolyte (33.5°), relatively smaller contact angles of 27.5°, 28.0°, 26.5° and 26.5° were observed for aqueous electrolytes with 0.1 wt% CTAB, AOT, FK-1 and FC-134, respectively. However, an increase in the concentration of FC-134 from 0.1 wt% to 0.2 wt% and 1 wt% could not further lower the contact angle, indicating that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the FC-134 surfactant is about 0.2 wt%. Therefore, Device 6 containing 0.2 wt% FC-134 was further studied in this work. The J–V values of Device 6 are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 2. It can be clearly seen that the PCE value increased from 3.56% to 3.96% with increasing FC-134 from 0.1 wt% (Device 5) to 0.2 wt% (Device 6). The enhancement of photovoltaic properties might be due to the further improved aqueous electrolyte/TiO2 interfacial contact, which is consistent with the results of contact angle measurements (Fig. 4).
The thickness of the TiO2 films was recognized as an important parameter which influences the electron diffusion and transport of the devices. It has been demonstrated that the recombination of electrons in aqueous electrolytes is much faster than in organic electrolytes. Therefore, the TiO2 films with various thicknesses become more pronounced to the aqueous electrolyte based devices. Here, the thickness of TiO2 films was optimized and the photovoltaic properties of devices were evaluated. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curve for DSSCs with different thicknesses of TiO2 films. All the photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc and PCE values of the devices, were increased with increasing film thickness from 3.2 μm (Device 7) to 5.1 μm (Device 6), probably due to the augmented TiO2 surface area for dye adsorption which provides more photoelectrons and higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency. The photovoltaic performance of the device with a thicker TiO2 film of 13.3 μm (Device 8), however, is depressed because of the strengthened recombination of the electrons, indicating that the photoelectron diffusion and transport become unfavorable with the increment of the TiO2 thickness. Here, it can be concluded that a 5.1 μm thick TiO2 film could achieve the best performance in 100% water DSSCs in this work, although enough experiments have not yet been performed to map out whether 5.1 μm is the accurate TiO2 thickness for the best photovoltaic performance.
Photovoltaic performances of the devices under different light intensity illumination were also investigated. Photovoltaic parameters of Device 1 and Device 6 were studied for comparison, and the results are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the highest PCE values of both devices are obtained under 0.5 sun illumination, which are much higher than that received at full sun and 0.15 sun. The observed diminishing of the PCE value under 0.15 sun is probably due to the limitations of light intensities. However, the less competitive PCE value yielded under full sun could be the result of the inefficient charge screening of electron transport in the mesoporous TiO2. Therefore, the fabricated aqueous DSSCs would better be used in a relatively low-light environment.

The selected devices (Device 1–3 and Device 6) were subjected to investigate the long-term stability test under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination with a UV light filter at room temperature. The measurement time covered a period of 50 days and the devices were tested periodically. Fig. 6 shows that all the photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values of all the devices, decreased after one day testing. It should be noted that Device 1 (without the surfactant in the electrolyte) only maintained about 17% of the original efficiency after 50 days testing, probably due to the detachment of dye, or the formation of iodate in the electrolytes. It should be noted that addition of surfactants could dramatically improve the stability of the devices. For example, Devices 2, 3, and 6 retained about 48%, 47%, and 37% of the original efficiency after 50 –days respectively, indicating that addition of a surfactant could effectively improve the long-term stability of 100% water DSSCs. The effect of surfactants on the device stability is still not clearly understood. It is supposed that the surfactant was absorbed on the surface of the dyed-coated TiO2 film, which hindered the approaching of I3− to the surface of the dyed-coated TiO2 film, reduced the recombination rate, and therefore enhanced the dye-regeneration rate.
In addition, the formation of iodate in the aqueous electrolytes and the dye molecules (N719 in this paper) desorbing part from the TiO2 surface in the aqueous electrolytes may be the main reasons for the device decay. Although the mechanism behind our observation is still being explored, we believe that the selection of dye still remains one of the effective strategies to improve the long-term stability of aqueous DSSCs.

In conclusion, the influence of ionic surfactants on 100% water electrolyte based DSSCs was studied. Addition of surfactant to the electrolyte improved the interfacial contact between the aqueous electrolyte and the dye-coated TiO2 film, which consequently improved the photovoltaic performance of the devices. With the introduction of 0.2 wt% of FC-134 in the aqueous electrolyte and the optimized TiO2 photoanode thickness of 5.1 μm, overall power conversion efficiencies of 3.96% and 4.66% were achieved under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively.

Moreover, surfactant doped aqueous electrolytes improved the long-time stability of water electrolyte based DSSCs. The promising results presented here show a feasible scheme towards the fabrication of greener and more efficient aqueous DSSCs.
