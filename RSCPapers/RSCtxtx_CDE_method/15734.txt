A series of 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and 4,7-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole alternating copolymers, PNB-Cn, with different alkyl chains, varying from 8-carbon (C8, 2-ethylhexyl) to 16-carbon (C16, hexadecyl) chains attached onto thienyl moieties were designed and synthesized. The effect of the conjugated copolymer side chain on the photovoltaic and charge mobility properties of organic solar cells (OSCs) and polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs) was investigated. It is found that the short alkyl side chains on PNB-Cn copolymers are favourable for the efficient operation of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, while the long alkyl side chains enhance the charge mobility of PFETs. As a result, the BHJ OSCs fabricated from the blend of PNB-C2,6 and PC71BM, using diiodooctane as a solvent additive, yielded a power conversion efficiency of 4.8% and the solution-processed bottom gate bottom contact type PFETs fabricated from PNB-C16 exhibited a hole mobility of 3.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio of 106. Our results suggest that copolymers constructed from 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and 4,7-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole are very stable, and solution-processable organic semiconductors for application in organic electronics.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are currently attracting a great deal of attention due to the promise of low cost, solution-processability, lightweight, flexibility as well as potential as an alternative renewable energy technology. Using BHJ OSCs based on a donor–acceptor type molecular–polymer system is one of the most extensively explored approaches for high performance devices as the molecular and functional properties of the organic semiconducting materials such as the optical energy gap, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels as well as the charge mobility can be easily modulated and tuned through chemical structure modification. With the development of new low bandgap donor materials, the effective fabrication processes such as solvent annealing, thermal annealing and solvent additives to properly control the interpenetrating network morphology of a material blend, as well as the optimized device structure, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of the BHJ OSCs based on solution-processable p-type conjugated polymers and n-type fullerene derivatives have recently reached a PCE of 8–9% for single junction and 10–11% for tandem OSCs. In general, factors limiting the PCE of the BHJ OSCs are the poor sunlight harvesting efficiency and the low charge carrier transport efficiency of organic semiconductors. Hence, the development of high-performance donor materials is of crucial for further performance improvement of OSCs, which still remains a challenge to the scientific community.

In addition to the choice of the electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties, the lateral substituent(s) that attached onto the donor–acceptor polymer backbone, dependent on the nature, location, length, bulkiness of substituent(s), would exert a significant effect on the optical, electronic properties and morphology of the polymer thin-film. Thus, this can provide an alternative tool or means to tune the functional properties of polymer in the solid state. Furthermore, the proper solubilizing lateral substituent(s) can improve the solubility and processability of the highly π-conjugated and high molecular-weight donor–acceptor polymers.
Recently, much effort has been devoted to understanding the influence of side chains on the functional and optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. You and coworkers have demonstrated that the length and shape of the alkyl side chain attached onto the main chain of the naphtha[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzothiadiazole (PNDT-DTB) copolymer could strongly influence not only the optical absorption and the morphology of the thin films, but also the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) of the resulting BHJ OSCs. Studies of poly(3-alkylthiophene) (P3AT) showed that the nature, size, and length of the alkyl side chains could be used to enhance the molecular properties and photovoltaic device performance of the corresponding BHJ OSCs. It was recently shown that long alkyl side chains in P3AT could assist the self-assembly of the ordered film via alkyl chain interactions; on the other hand, a sufficiently long alkyl chain could act as an insulating barrier hindering the charge transport. The influence of side chains was also found in other donor–acceptor polymeric systems in which the material properties, the charge mobility and the photovoltaic device performances varied strongly with variable side chains.
We have previously shown that the 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and 4,7-bis(3-decylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole alternating low bandgap copolymer exhibited a broad absorption range and promising device performance in BHJ OSCs. To further investigate and optimize the alkyl side chains on various functional, charge mobility and photovoltaic properties of this copolymer system, a series of 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithioph-ene and 4,7-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo[c][1,2,5]thia-diazole alternating copolymers, PNB-Cn, with different alkyl side chains varying from 8-carbon (C8, 2-ethylhexyl) to 16-carbon (C16, hexadecyl) chains attached onto 3-position of thienyl moieties were designed and synthesized. Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures of the copolymers, PNB-Cn, where n = 2,6; 10; 12; 14 and 16.
The synthetic routes for the key electron-rich intermediate, 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,9-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphthodithiophene, 5, and electron-deficient moieties, 4,7-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, 11a–e, are outlined in Scheme 1.
Compounds 1–7,8a–11a,8b–11b, and 8c,d,e–11c,d,e were synthesized according to the reported procedures with optimized conditions. The detailed procedures are given in the ESI. The alternating copolymers, PNB-Cn, were synthesized by the Stille polycondensation reaction of 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,9-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphthodithiophene, 5, with 4,7-bis(5-bromo-3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazole, 11a–e, using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in DMF at 120 °C for 48 h under N2 (Scheme 1). All the copolymers showed good solubility in chloroform, THF and chlorobenzene.

All the reagents were used as purchased unless otherwise mentioned.


To a 50 mL round-bottom flask containing 3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene (69 mg, 0.10 mmol) and 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphtha[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene (108 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mg). After three successive deoxygenation-refilling with N2 cycles, DMF (30 mL) was added via a syringe. The polymerization was carried out at 120 °C for 48 h under N2. The polymer was precipitated in MeOH and collected by filtration. Low-molecular-weight oligomers were removed by Soxhlet extraction with MeOH, hexane and DCM, respectively. The remaining high molecular-weight solid was extracted with chloroform. The desired polymer was precipitated from methanol, collected and dried in a vacuum for 12 h affording the product as a black solid (60 mg, 59%), Mn = 72 kDa, PDI = 2.1.


The number average molecular weights (Mns) of copolymers, determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as standard and THF as eluent, were in the range of 44–47 kDa for PNB-Cn, where n = 10, 12, 14, and 16 and 72 kDa for PNB-C2,6 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.6–2.1. All the copolymers showed high thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) in the range of 353–389 °C as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Table 1). There was no glass transition state observed for all the copolymers as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The physical and thermal stability data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 1.

The absorption spectra of copolymers measured in THF and thin film are shown in Fig. 2. Both spectra of copolymers exhibit two major absorption bands, in which the weak absorption is at around 430 nm corresponding to π–π* transitions, while the strong and broad absorption is around 610 nm corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor moieties. Increasing the size of the alkyl substituent attached on the two thienyl rings, from 2-ethylhexyl to hexadecyl groups, does not alter the absorption characteristics in THF because of the good solubility of all copolymers with an identical π-conjugated backbone. There is a slight red shift in the absorption spectra in thin films (Fig. 2b) as compared to those in solution which is attributed to the improved π–π stacking in solid state films. In addition, there is a small variation of absorption cut-off in thin films within the series. As revealed from the optimized geometries of these polymers obtained by the DFT calculations at the B3LYP 6-31G(d) level, the dihedral angles between the naphthodithiophene and thienyl units of polymers PNB-C10 and PNB-C2,6 are very similar (Fig. 3). Thus, such a small variation is not likely due to the difference in conformation of the polymer backbone. The absorption edges of these copolymer films reach ∼750 nm which corresponds to an optical bandgap of ∼1.68 eV.

To investigate the redox potentials of these copolymers, cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in dry CH3CN (with 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NPF6) using Ag/AgNO3 as a reference electrode. The PNB-Cn copolymers show very similar redox behaviour with one irreversible oxidation couple with onset oxidation potentials (Eoxonset) in the range of 0.41–0.51 V and one irreversible reduction wave with onset reduction potentials (Eredonset) in the range of −1.23 to 1.33 V. The HOMO energy levels of copolymers were determined by calculating from the onset oxidation potentials with ferrocene as an external standard.
The LUMO energy level was determined from the measured HOMO energy level and the optical bandgap energy (see Table 2). The HOMO energy levels of these copolymers are estimated to be around −5.20 eV and the LUMO energy levels are estimated to be around −3.51 eV. The results indicate that these copolymers are fairly stable in air, an important characteristic of organic semiconductors, which is a prerequisite for the application in PFETs and OSCs.

BHJ OSCs were fabricated using PNB-Cn copolymers as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (100 nm) (1:2)/Al (100 nm) and an active cell area of 9 mm2. The device performance measured under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 is greatly affected by the fabrication parameters such as the use of solvent additives and with or without the thermal annealing process. The performance of BHJ OSCs fabricated under different process conditions including the weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM in the blend layer, the volume ratio of the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive in the solvent, the effect of post-annealing was investigated (see ESI). It is interesting to find that increasing the ratio of DIO from 0%, 1% to 3% v/v, the fill factor (FF) and Jsc of devices fabricated from the copolymer:PC71BM blends progressively increase. Meanwhile, the post-deposition thermal annealing shows a dramatic effect on the device performance with which the FF, Jsc and Voc of the devices can be further enhanced (ESI). The optimum device performance was obtained using 6 mg mL−1 of polymer in chlorobenzene containing 3 vol% DIO for spin-coating with a copolymer:PC71BM ratio of 1:2 (w/w) with a film thickness of 100 nm after post-annealing at 80 °C for 10 min. The J–V characteristics and the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the optimized OSCs are shown in Fig. 4.

A summary of the photovoltaic properties of PNB-Cn-based OSCs fabricated using a 3% DIO solvent additive with post-annealing at 80 °C is shown in Table 3. It is clearly shown that OSCs fabricated from PNB-Cn copolymers have a high FF of 0.58–0.63, suggesting that π-conjugated backbones of PNB-Cn with different alkyl side chains have good charge-transport properties. They also exhibit a similar Voc in the range of 0.67–0.73 V, which is in good agreement with the measured HOMO energy levels. Nevertheless, there is a dramatic difference in the Jsc among these BHJ OSCs leading to a variation in PCE. There is an increasing tendency of Jsc and PCE of the OSCs as the alkyl side chain gets smaller in size. As a result, PNB-C2,6 with the shortest branched side chains afforded the best device performance with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 11.13 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.61, giving rising to a PCE of 4.8%. Although these co-polymers exhibit almost identical absorption behaviour, the IPCE curves consistently show that the PNB-C2,6 based device exhibits a broad and strong photoresponse with the highest efficient photoconversion efficiency than the other homologous in the spectral range between 300 and 750 nm.

The film morphologies of PNB-Cn:PC71BM blends with and without DIO additive of PNB-C2,6 and PNB-C16 were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 5. The isolated and large domains seen in the AFM height images are formed from both of the blend films fabricated from chlorobenzene without using a solvent additive. These domains are far larger than typical exciton diffusions lengths (∼10 nm), and thus hinder efficient exciton dissociation resulting in low current density. In contrast to blend films without using solvent additive, blend films with different DIO solvent additive ratios from 1% to 3%, the films afforded significantly more homogeneous morphologies in which the nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks provide more efficient charge separation and transport. Thus, the favourable phase separation results in an enhancement in Jsc for PNB-C2,6 and PNB-C16 based OSCs from 6.45 mA cm−2 to 10.5 mA cm−2 and 2.37 mA cm−2 to 6.64 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent to the recently reported efficient OSCs.

To investigate the charge transport properties of PNB-Cn thin films, bottom-gate bottom-contact configuration (BGBC) PFETs with Au drain and source contacts were fabricated. The active layer was spin-cast onto the octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified SiO2/Si substrates at 1500 rpm for 60 s from a chlorobenzene solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 using a constant channel width of 1400 μm. The performance of PFETs was optimized with the channel length and the thermal annealing process. A summary of the characteristics of PNB-Cn-based PFETs is shown in Table 4. All the transistors based on these copolymers exhibit typical p-type PFET characteristics. Fig. 6 shows typical output and transfer characteristics of the PFETs prepared using PNB-C16. For as fabricated PFETs with a channel length of 8 μm, these copolymers exhibit a hole mobility in the range of 1.8 × 10−3 to 5.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Upon increasing the annealing temperature of these polymeric thin films, there is an obvious enhancement in the hole mobility reaching up to 1.5 × 10−2 to 3.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio up to 106 at the annealing temperature of 200 °C to 240 °C. The increase in the hole mobility of the PFETs upon thermal annealing suggests that the crystallinity of the polymer films and the ordered lamellar structure of π–π close packing for the polymer backbone are significantly improved at higher annealing temperatures. The results reveal that there is a noticeable increase in the hole mobility for those co-polymers with a similar molecular weight when the linear length of alkyl side chains increases from decyl (C10) to hexadecyl (C16) groups (Table 4 and fig. 7). The high molecular weight of PNB-C2,6 can also afford the high hole mobility of 2.9 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio of 105.

AFM images of polymer thin films were investigated at various annealing temperatures (see ESI). Pristine films showed a discontinued surface structure; on the other hand, with film annealing treatment, a fibril-like, well-ordered and bi-continuous morphology was formed, which favours the charge carrier transport and leads to an increase in the hole mobility.

A series of 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithio-phene and 4,7-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole alternating copolymers, PNB-Cn, with different alkyl side chains attached onto thienyl groups were designed, synthesized and characterized. These copolymers exhibit strong and broad absorption spectra, high thermal stability and appropriate energy levels as p-type materials for organic electronics. The resulting BHJ OSCs fabricated from these copolymers with different alkyl side chains exhibited similar Voc (0.67–0.73 V) and FF (0.58–0.63) but dramatic difference in Jsc values giving rise to the significant variation of device performance. Our results reveal that the shorter the alkyl side chains of the thienyl groups, the higher the Jsc, leading to a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 11.13 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.61 and a PCE of 4.8% measured for OSCs fabricated using a blend of PNB-C2,6 and PC71BM. In contrast, the hole mobility is enhanced with an increase in length of the linear alkyl side chains. The solution-processed PFETs fabricated from these copolymers exhibited a high hole mobility up to 0.034 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio of 106. Our results demonstrated that PNB based-polymers are promising candidates for further exploration in various high-performance organic electronic devices.
