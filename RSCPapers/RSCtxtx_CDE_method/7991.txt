Transition metal chalcogenide nanocrystals have increasingly been used in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) as a counter electrode (CE) to improve their power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to their high catalytic activity. Herein, we report a Cu3Se2 nanostructured CE composed of nanorods and nanosheets for high efficiency QDSCs. Cu3Se2 nanocrystals were directly grown on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to form a double-layer morphology via the chemical bath deposition (CBD) process. Nanorod arrays with the height of 100 nm were covered by nanosheets with the size of approximately 500 nm. When the CBD time is 3 h, the QDSC shows the highest efficiency due to the excellent catalytic ability and conductivity of the Cu3Se2 CE. As a result, the PCE of the QDSCs using Cu3Se2 CE has the highest value of 5.05% and average value 4.96%, which are much higher than that of the solar cell using the conventional CE of compact CuxS (4.10% for the highest value and 4.06% for the average value). This is attributed to the large surface area, high conductivity and good electrocatalytic ability of the nanostructured Cu3Se2 CE.

The development of low-cost and high-performance solar devices to resolve the global warming and energy crisis is an urgent issue imposed on scientists around the world. As a type of third generation solar cell, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted considerable attention recently. QDSCs have a similar structure with dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), however they use semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as the photo-sensitizer instead of dye molecules. QDSC is comprised of a mesoporous metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) film, QDs, electrolyte and counter electrode (CE). Photons harvested by QDs can cause the excitation of electrons and separate electron–hole pairs into electrons and holes at the interface between the MOS and QDs. The electrons transferred by the MOS will move to the CE through the electric circuit. Meanwhile, the holes are released by redox couples in the polysulfide electrolyte. In view of this process, CEs play an extremely important role to conduct electrons and catalyze the reduction reaction of oxidized polysulfide. Since researchers have realized the importance of CEs, besides photoanodes and electrolytes, many semiconducting sulfides CEs have been reported and applied such as PbS, PbSe, NiCo2S4, Co9S8, FeS, CuInS2 and CuxS. Among the CEs, CuxS based CEs show the highest electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction reaction of oxidized polysulfide electrolyte.

The poor electrical conductivity of copper sulfide based CEs still limits their further development. Therefore, research on alternative catalytic materials is imperative. Recently, researchers have reported that copper selenide (CuxSe) shows the potential to be the CEs of QDSCs due to its excellent catalytic activity and lower transfer resistance than that of copper sulfide. CuxSe CEs can be prepared via various methods such as vacuum evaporation, electro-deposition, chemical bath deposition (CBD) and the successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR) method. Among the methods mentioned above, SILAR should be more appealing due to its simplicity and versatility. However it is difficult to make CEs with stable conductivity and catalytic activity. Hence, the studies on the preparation of metal selenide CEs still need to be improved.
Herein, a novel route to fabricate Cu3Se2 nanostructured CEs has been developed, as shown in Scheme 1. Pure Cu3Se2 nanocrystals grow directly on FTO glass though a two-step aqueous solution method to form Cu3Se2 nanostructured CEs for QDSCs. We used the SILAR method to assemble CuS-seeds on FTO glass and then grow the CuxSe nanostructure via the CBD method. The excellent performance of QDSCs compared to the cells assembled with traditional CuxS CEs is attributed to the good conductivity and high electrochemical catalytic activity of Cu3Se2 nanocrystals, which have been verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization. Thus, the PCE of the solar cell is more than 5% for the Cu3Se2 CE, which is much higher than that of the device assembled using CuxS CE (∼4%).

The chemicals used in this study were cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Alfa Aesar, 98.5%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, Aladdin, ≥98.0%), cadmium acetate dihydrate ((CH3COO)2Cd·2H2O, Aladdin, 99.99%), cupric acetate anhydrous ((CH3COO)2Cu, Aladdin, ≥98%), sodium bisulfite (Na2SO3, Alfa, 99.99%), nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt monohydrate (N(CH2CO2Na)3·H2O, Alfa Aesar, 98+%), selenium powder (Alfa Aesar, 99+%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin, 99%), sublimed sulfur (S, Guoyao China, ≥99.5%), and TiO2 (Degussa P25). All chemicals were used without further treatment.


TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO glass via the doctor blade method. TiO2 pastes were prepared by mixing TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25), EC and α-terpineol following a previously reported procedure, and then coated on FTO glass substrates to get approximately 10 μm-thick films. The as-received TiO2 films underwent a programmed sinter in air at 120 °C for 30 min and then at 500 °C for 30 min at a heating speed of 5 °C min−1. The as-prepared TiO2 electrodes were used for further sensitization with CdS/CdSe QDs.


The SILAR method was used to assemble CdS and ZnS QDs onto the TiO2 films. Briefly, the TiO2 films were firstly immersed in a 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution for 1 min, rinsed with methanol and dried, and then dipped for 1 min in a 0.1 M Na2S methanol (DI-water/methanol volume ratio 1:1) solution. This procedure corresponded to a single SILAR cycle. In total, five cycles were employed to obtain a suitable amount of CdS on the TiO2 films. In the subsequent chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdSe QDs, the TiO2/CdS electrodes were vertically immersed into a mixed solution of 0.1 M Na2SeSO3, 0.1 M (CH3COO)2Cu, and 0.15 M nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NAT) at a volume ratio of 1:1:1 under dark conditions at 25 °C for 3 h. After the deposition of CdSe, a ZnS passivation layer was deposited by alternately dipping the TiO2/CdS/CdSe samples in 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions for 1 min. A total of 2 cycles of the SILAR process was done.


The Cu3Se2 nanostructures were directly deposited on the FTO glass though a two-step method. The first step is the successive immersion of pre-cleaned FTO in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M (CH3COO)2Cu, DI-water, 0.1 M Na2S and DI-water to deposit the CuS seeds. For the deposition of the copper selenide thin films, an Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was used as the Se source, which was prepared by stirring an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2SO3 and 0.2 M Se at 90 °C for 3 h. Cu3Se2 was grown on the pretreated FTO glass through the CBD method in a subsequent step. In brief, a 0.1 M as-prepared Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution, 0.1 M (CH3COO)2Cu, and 0.2 M nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NAT) solution were mixed together with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. Next, the CuS seeds-coated FTO glass was vertically immersed into this solution at 25 °C for different hours.


CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanodes were assembled with Cu3Se2/FTO as the counter electrode. The polysulfide electrolyte consisting of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S dissolved in 7:3 methanol–water solution was injected into the internal spaces of the cells by capillary action.


The crystal structures were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) on an X'Pert PROS (Philips Co.) with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54060 Å) radiation. The morphology of the samples was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7000) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also performed on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER CIMPS) at the forward bias of −0.6 V in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz under dark conditions. Tafel polarization plots were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660d). The active area of the QDSCs was 0.1256 cm2. The photovoltaic performance of the QDSCs was measured under 3A grade simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained in the range of 300–800 nm using a Keithley 2400 multi-meter with the illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator.



Fig. 1 shows SEM images of the CuS seeds-coated FTO with different CBD durations. It can be seen that CuS seeds are distributed uniformly on the FTO with a size of around ∼40 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(A). It is hard to grow CuxSe nanocrystals directly on the surface of FTO glass without the assistance of CuS seeds. After the coating with CuS seeds, CuxSe nanocrystals can grow on the seeds during the CBD process, as shown in Fig. 1(B–D). These two morphologies correspond to the growth process of CuxSe. In the process of the nucleation-growth of CuxSe, CuS seeds provide the location for the growth of CuxSe nanocrystals. Besides, using the narrow band gap semiconductor—CuS—as seeds will not decrease the performance of the CE due to its good conductivity and facile preparation. CuxSe nanocrystals accumulate around the CuS seeds and grow rapidly to form CuxSe nanorods which provide sites for the immersion of the electrolyte. At the second stage, the nucleation and growth of CuxSe nanocrystals take place on the surface of the CuxSe nanorods directly to form CuxSe nanosheets. The cross sectional SEM images in Fig. 2 show that the duration of the CBD process has no influence on the thickness of the Cu3Se2 film when the duration is more than 1 h. The thickness of CuxSe is about 400 nm.

Characterization of the crystal composition and structures of CuxSe was carried out with the help of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, and the spectrum is shown in Fig. 3(A). The XRD spectrum of CuxSe provides well-defined peaks, which is in good agreement with the standard pattern of tetragonal Cu3Se2 (PDF#72-1421). The lattice parameters of the tetragonal Cu3Se2 structure were calculated to be a = 6.410 Å, c = 4.282 Å and density = 6.578, which are in good accordance with the standard values of a = 6.406 Å, c = 4.279 Å and density = 6.592. The peaks centered at 26.46° and 46.13° could be attributed to the diffraction from the (111) planes of Cu2Se (PDF#75-0889) and (220) planes of Cu1.8Se (PDF#88-2045), respectively. TEM images of the sample are shown in Fig. 3(B–D). It can be seen that the sample is mainly composed of nanorods and nanosheets. HRTEM images recorded from a small sheet are shown in Fig. 3(C and D), in which the lattice distances of 0.320 nm, 0.353 nm and 0.238 nm could be clearly observed, which correspond to the (200), (101) and (211) crystal facets of tetragonal Cu3Se2. In view of the results above, we deduce that the Cu3Se2 nanorods and nanosheets grow preferentially along the (101) crystal facet.
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves for QDSCs based on the Cu3Se2 counter electrode with different CBD times were obtained under simulated sunlight. As shown in Fig. 4(A) and Table 1, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the short circuit current density (Jsc) of the QDSCs were not notably affected by the duration of the CBD process. However, the fill factor (FF) of the QDSCs assembled with Cu3Se2-3 h CEs was much higher than that based on the other CEs, and consequently the efficiency of the QDSCs with Cu3Se2-3 h CEs (4.75%) was higher than those with 2 and 4 CBD hours. Fig. 4(B) shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of QDSCs with different CEs. The IPCE spectra display the same trend as the J–V curves. The high efficiency of the solar cells is ascribed to the excellent electrocatalytic ability of the CE in the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes. Thus the EIS and Tafel polarization measurements were carried out to study the electrochemical properties of the Cu3Se2 nanostructured CEs.

Fig. 5(A) displays the impedance spectra of the QDSCs measured under dark conditions with a forward bias of −0.6 V, and the fitting results of the impedance spectra are listed in Table 2. The two semicircles in Fig. 5(A) correspond to electron injection at the CE/electrolyte interface and transport in the electrolyte at high frequencies (R1) and the electron transfer at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface and transport in the TiO2 film (Rct). The QDSC with Cu3Se2-3 h shows the lowest R1 value (12.39 Ω), which indicates the excellent conductivity of this CE material. The Rct is considered to be the charge transfer resistance. The results in Table 2 show that the Rct value of the solar cell assembled with Cu3Se2-3 h CE (159.2 Ω) is much higher than that of the cells installed with Cu3Se2-1 h CE (56.87 Ω) and Cu3Se2-2 h CE (93.55 Ω). The increase in Rct can be attributed to the optimization of the counter electrode, and the enhancement of its electrochemical ability can efficiently accelerate the reduction of Sx2− and the oxidation of S2− instantly and eventually speed up the rate of the oxidation–reduction reaction in the electrolyte. Thus, the electrons are less easily recombined with the holes in the electrolyte, which results in a decrease in charge recombination. The electron lifetime represents the period of time elapsed between the generated photoexcited electrons to their final combination with the oxidized polysulfide in the electrolyte. EIS measurement cannot provide an accurate value of the electron lifetime. The values of electron lifetime here are statistic. However, a parallel comparison of the electron lifetime of devices with different CEs can be used as a supplementary means to evaluate the performance of the CEs. Electron transfer is affected by impedance due to the crystal defect, phonon scattering and impurity scattering in both the photoanode and CE, each of which causes the loss of electron lifetime. Effective separation of electron–hole pairs will reduce the recombination, achieve longer electron lifetime and make better electron transmission pathways due to the excellent conductivity and electrocatalytic ability of CE materials. Therefore, Bode plots of QDSCs with different CEs were obtained to study the electrocatalytic activity of the CE, as shown in Fig. 5(B). The curve peak of the spectrum can be applied to calculate the electron lifetime (τn) according to eqn (1).

The corresponding results are also listed in
Table 2, which reveals that the electron lifetime of the QDSCs with Cu3Se2-3 h CEs is 13.18 ms, which is about twice that of the QDSCs with the Cu3Se2-1 h (6.32 ms) and Cu3Se2-2 h (12.15 ms) CEs due to the better electron transmission pathway and higher conductivity of the Cu3Se2-3 h CEs.

To further elucidate the mechanism and catalytic behavior of the Cu3Se2 CEs with different CBD times, we studied the Tafel spectra of symmetrical dummy cells. In Tafel polarization curves, the exchange current density (Jo) is directly related to the catalytic abilities of the electrodes, which can be estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches of the corresponding Tafel polarization curves. As shown in Fig. 5(C), the Tafel polarization curve of the CEs with 3 CBD hours is higher than that of 1 and 4 CBD hours, thus implying that the Jo value of the Cu3Se2-3 h CEs is the highest among them, and the electrocatalytic ability for the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes of the Cu3Se2-3 h CEs is best. This is ascribed to the high crystallinity, proper crystal defects and large surface area and thus outstanding electron transfer pathway in these counter electrodes.
For QDSCs, the CE is usually prepared using brass foil to form a CuxS film, according to previous reports. The preparation of the CuxS electrode can be described as follows: brass foil was immersed into 37% HCl at 70 °C for 5 min, then rinsed with water and dried in air. After that, the etched brass foil was dipped into a 1 M S and 1 M Na2S aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of a black CuxS layer on the foil, as shown in Fig. 6(A1). It can be seen that CuxS film on the brass foil is a compact layer. In comparison with the CuxS film on the brass foil, the Cu3Se2 nanostructured CE has a much larger surface area to accelerate the redox reaction and charge transport in the electrolyte. Fig. 6(B) shows that the Tafel polarization curve of Cu3Se2 CEs with 3 CBD treatment times is higher than the conventional CuxS CE, thus implying that the Jo value of the Cu3Se2 CEs is higher, and the electrocatalytic ability for the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes is better. As depicted in Fig. 6(C), the solar cells matched with the Cu3Se2 nanostructured CEs reveal better catalytic ability and photoelectric property than that assembled with CuxS based CEs. To further evaluate their properties, the stability of QDSCs assembled with different CEs was determined, as shown in Fig. 6(D). The devices were tested at room temperature and under dark conditions. The PCE of devices assembled with the Cu3Se2 CE change from 4.95% to 4.81% with a negligible decline of about 2.8%. However, the QDSCs with the CuS CE show relatively low stability and their PCE changes from the initial 4.03% to the final 2.24% with an obvious decline of about 44.4%. It is evident that Cu3Se2/FTO CE shows a higher PCE and remarkable stability. Table 3 reveals that the device assembled with the Cu3Se2 CEs has a higher fill factor, larger short circuit current and open circuit voltage in comparison with the solar cell assembled the CuxS CEs. The possible reasons for this are ascribed to the large surface area, proper crystal defects, high conductivity and good electrocatalytic ability of the Cu3Se2 nanostructure, which accelerate the electron transfer and reaction of redox in polysulfide electrolyte, and result in low charge recombination and high conversion efficiency. We obtained an improved photovoltaic efficiency with maximum values of 5.05% and average value of 4.96% for QDSCs with the use of a TiO2 light-scattering layer on the TiO2 mesoporous photoanode.

We have developed a CBD process to prepare a nanostructured Cu3Se2 CE composed of nanorod arrays with a height of 100 nm and nanosheets with a size of about 500 nm. CuS seeds were deposited on FTO substrates by SILAR for the nucleation and growth of Cu3Se2 nanocrystals during the CBD process. This double layer nanostructured CE shows better catalytic activity and charge transfer, larger specific surface area and higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than that of the traditional compact CuxS CE prepared by brass foil. The QDSCs assembled with the Cu3Se2 CE displayed an improved PCE with maximum values of 5.05% and average value of 4.96%, which are much higher than that of the solar cell using the CuxS CE (4.10% for the highest value and 4.06% for the average value).
