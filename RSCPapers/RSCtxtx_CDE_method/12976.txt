Push–pull zinc phthalocyanine dyes bearing hexylsulfanyl moieties as electron donors and carboxyethynyl as mono- or di-anchoring groups have been designed, synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The effects of the anchoring groups on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated. The incorporation of a carboxyethynyl group in GT23 has a considerable effect on preventing dye aggregation due to its relatively non-planar structure. The mono-anchoring dye bearing a phenyl carboxyethynyl group, GT5, has a higher molar extinction coefficient and sufficient charge injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Therefore, GT5 achieved at least 90% higher power conversion efficiency than the di-anchoring dyes (GT31 and GT32). Time-dependent density functional theory (PBE0/6-31G(d,p)) was also used to calculate the electronic absorption spectra, which predicted very well the measured UV-Vis with an error of up to 0.11 eV for the Q bands and 0.3 eV for the B bands. The longest charge transfer bands are obtained in the visible light region and they correspond to a transfer phthalocyanine core → substituent with a carboxyethynyl group where the absorptions of GT32 (465 nm) and GT31 (461 nm) are red-shifted compared to GT23 (429 nm) and GT5 (441 nm). The interaction energy between the phthalocyanine and a cluster of anatase-TiO2 (H4Ti40O82) was calculated using density functional theory. For all phthalocyanines, the interaction favored is monodentate and corresponds to –O(OH)⋯Ti(TiO2), where the stronger interaction occurs for GT32 (−2.11 eV) and GT31 (−2.25 eV). This study presents the molecular combination of the anchoring groups in zinc phthalocyanine sensitizers, which is one of the effective strategies for improving the performance of DSSCs.

The use of renewable energy sources such as hydroelectricity, wind, geothermal, wave, biomass, and photovoltaic is indispensable compared to fossil fuels that are expected to run out soon. In this respect, photovoltaic technologies using solar energy are considered to be an important alternative to fossil fuels. Studies on photovoltaic technologies as an alternative source to traditional fuels are continuing in order to benefit from the huge amount of sunlight that comes to the Earth's surface every day to meet the current and future energy needs. Today, silicon-based solar cells are widely used in the photovoltaic industry in terms of both durable and stable energy conversion efficiency. In recent years, as an alternative to these silicon-based cells, there has been intense interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which are relatively easy to fabricate at a low cost. Currently, the focus is on optimizing the device structure and increasing its power conversion efficiency (PCE). To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) greater than 11% have been achieved using ruthenium (Ru)-based photosensitizers. However, their relatively high cost, negative environmental impact, and lack of strong absorption in the red or near-infrared region have led researchers to develop novel efficient dyes that are extremely economical, chemically functionalizable, and easy to fabricate. In this manner, potential photosensitizers such as phthalocyanine (Pc) complexes offer better perspectives in terms of the architectural integration of DSSCs, especially against the negative effects of Ru dyes. Pcs are photochemically, electrochemically and thermally stable compounds that possess effective light-gathering ability in the far-red and near-IR spectral regions where significant solar flux occurs. Furthermore, the properties of phthalocyanines such as the optimization of substitution patterns, the modification of the anchoring groups, and the central metal and axial substitution effect make them indispensable for photovoltaic applications. These superior features can be tuned by relatively facile synthetic modifications to make them more suitable for DSSC applications. Specifically, ZnPcs have been confirmed to be remarkably beneficial in DSSCs due to their long-lived singlet excited states. The anchoring groups in DSSCs, such as carboxylic acid, cyanoacrylic acid or rodanin-3-acetic acid which generally serve as electron acceptors, are used to ensure that the dye attaches to the TiO2 surface. The carboxylic acid groups form a strong ester linkage with the TiO2 surface, providing a strong electronic communication between the dye and the TiO2 surface.

So far, the most efficient zinc phthalocyanines studied carry three electron-donating bulky groups (referred to as A) that can enhance the charge-transfer characteristics of the dye and one electron-accepting anchoring group (referred to as B) that can interact with the metal oxide semiconductor. By means of this A3B type molecular design, hampering dye aggregation with bulky groups, promotion of higher solubility, appropriate electronic “push–pull effect” and optimal bonding of the dye to the surface of the semiconductor layer can be achieved. The introduction of three hexylsulfanyl groups with a strong electron-donating structure was aimed at enhancing the charge-transfer characteristics of the dye and extending the absorption profile of the dye through π-extended conjugation. The anchoring ability of sensitizers is one of the important requirements for this application; thus, the aim of our study is to investigate also the effect of the anchoring strength on the photovoltaic performances of the synthesized ZnPcs (GT23,GT31, GT32 and GT5) (see their chemical structures in Fig. 1) in comparison with GT4 and TT1.

In this paper, we report three newly designed A3B-type ZnPcs (GT31, GT32 and GT5) as sensitizers for DSSCs that consist of different carboxyethynyl groups (propiolic acid or 4-ethynylbenzoic acid) as electron withdrawing groups and three hexylsulfanyl groups as electron donating groups (Fig. 1).

Asymmetrical phthalocyanines (Pcs) GT31, GT32, and GT5 were obtained following previously described procedures but with slight modifications. The synthetic route to A3B type Pcs are shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, bis-(hydroxypropargyl) (1), bis-(phenylethynyl) (2), and mono-(phenylethynyl) (3) substituted phthalonitrile precursors were prepared by employing the Sonogashira catalytic cross-coupling reaction, with 4- and 4,5-iodophthalonitriles, using Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 as a catalyst, in the presence of CuI/Et3N (Scheme 2). The various asymmetrical Pcs were then obtained by the reaction of compound 4 and the other phthalonitriles in the ratio 9:1 according to Scheme 1. The purification of Pcs from the reaction mixture was carried out via column chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane and ethanol (100/1, 50/1, 10/1, and 5/1, at increased polarities) mixtures or by size exclusion chromatography with Bio-Beads S-X1 using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent.
All final compounds and their relevant intermediates were fully characterized by spectroscopic techniques, including elemental analysis, NMR, FT-IR, mass spectrometry (MS), and fluorescence and electronic absorption spectroscopy. The results of analyses were found to agree with the predicted structures (Fig. S1–S29). In the FT-IR spectra of GT31, GT32 and GT5, the presence of the characteristic broad stretching vibration of carboxylic acid –OH at about 3300 cm−1 and the CO peak at about 1710 cm−1 demonstrates the successful formation of the Pcs. The 1H NMR spectra of the asymmetrical Pcs GT31, GT32 and GT5 showed broad chemical shifts, demonstrating self-aggregation which results from the positional isomerism of the substituent groups. Nevertheless, the integrated intensities of the signals correspond to the number of hydrogen atoms in the compounds (see the Experimental section). Despite several attempts (use of different deuterated solvents, including the mixtures of two solvents), 13C NMR spectra could not be obtained due to the aggregation behavior of Pcs. The purified Pcs were also characterized by mass spectra. MALDI-ToF MS spectra showed the molecular ion peaks at m/z 1035.4 [M + H]+, 1030.4 [M]+, and 1064.1 [M + 2H]+ for 5, 6 and GT32, and at 1214.6 [M]+ and 1060.9 [M]+ for GT31 and GT5, respectively (Fig. S10, S13, S16, S21 and S26).

The electrochemical and optical properties of Pcs were evaluated by UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The ground state electronic spectrum in solution is one method to prove the formation of phthalocyanines. The UV-vis spectra of the synthesized phthalocyanine dyes in tetrahydrofuran (THF) are composed of a B-band near 350 nm and a single Q-band between 650 and 750 nm due to π–π* transition. The red shifted and more intense Q band is favorable for enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency. Compared with the mono-anchoring complexes (GT5 and GT23), the Q-bands of the di-anchoring complexes (GT31 and GT32) are slightly red-shifted (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). This spectral change can be attributed to the extension of electron delocalization over the whole molecule. On the other hand, the mono-anchoring complexes have a quite high molar extinction coefficient with respect to the di-anchoring complexes. Fig. 2b shows the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the four dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film. All the Q-bands of the dyes on the TiO2 surface are significantly broadened compared with their THF solutions, which is ascribed to the adsorption and aggregation of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. However, the Q-band of GT23 is narrower than those of the other three dyes, indicating that the aggregation degree of GT23 is relatively lower than that of the others. These results may be explained based on the reduced coplanar structure of GT23 which emanated from the absence of a phenyl moiety or a second anchoring group, unlike the structures of GT31, GT32 and GT5. The fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of the molecules in THF:pyridine and THF are shown in Fig. S19, S24, and S29 and the related data are listed with Stokes shifts in Table S1.

The newly synthesized Pc GT5 exhibits high solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, DMSO, CHCl3 and THF, but both GT31 and GT32 containing the bis-carboxyethynyl groups are soluble only in a mixture of organic solvents, such as THF:pyridine (20:1), due to excessive aggregation. In this study, the aggregation behavior of GT5 was investigated in THF while those of GT31 and GT32 were investigated in the THF:pyridine mixture at different concentrations, respectively. The investigated Pcs at concentrations ranging from 1.2 × 10−5 to 2.0 × 10−6 M obeyed the Beer–Lambert law (Fig. S18, S23 and S28).
The cyclic voltammetry of the four dyes in DMSO solution was performed (Fig. S30 and Table 1) to investigate the possibilities of electron injection and dye regeneration. The first oxidation potentials (O1) related to the HOMO energy levels of all dyes are almost at 0.47 V owing to the presence of the same electron-donating moiety in their molecular structures. These values are more negative than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (−4.85 eV), assuring sufficient dye regeneration. The LUMO energies of the four dyes are −3.51, −3.60, −3.58, and −3.49 eV for GT23, GT31, GT32, and GT5 respectively. The LUMO values of the di-anchoring dyes are approximately 0.09 eV more negative than those of the mono-anchoring dyes due to the extension of electron delocalization caused by the additional anchoring moiety. The LUMO values of the di-anchoring dyes are also slightly more positive than the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.05 eV), resulting in a diminished driving force for charge injection into TiO2.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on the four dyes and their photovoltaic parameters, such as short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 2. Among them, the DSSC based on GT5, which contains a phenyl carboxyethynyl anchoring group, demonstrated a better photovoltaic performance (PCE = 0.67%, Jsc = 2.13 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.501 V) than GT23 (PCE = 0.59%, Jsc = 1.96 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.478 V), GT31 (PCE = 0.37%, Jsc = 1.30 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.458 V) and GT32 (PCE = 0.29%, Jsc = 1.04 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.452 V) based devices. In comparison with the mono-anchoring dye with a carboxyethynyl unit (GT23), the higher PCE of GT5 may be ascribed to its higher molar extinction coefficient. Among all dyes, the strongest interaction with TiO2 is expected for GT31 and GT32 due to their di-anchoring feature, which is consistent with the theoretical calculations (vide infra). However, the DSSCs based on GT31 and GT32 exhibited lower photovoltaic performances with respect to the others. This can be mainly attributed to lower molar extinction coefficients of the di-anchoring dyes. Moreover, the reduced photovoltaic performance observed for the di-anchoring dyes is also related with the lower LUMO energy levels. On the other hand, the LUMO level of our previous asymmetric zinc phthalocyanine (GT4) bearing a carboxylic acid anchoring group and the same donors is estimated to be −3.20 eV (Table 1). Therefore, compared with GT4 (Jsc = 6.42 mA cm−2), the presence of a phenyl carboxyethynyl anchoring group in GT5 decreased the Jsc value, resulting from the lower LUMO energy level. As shown in Table 2, the dye loading amounts increased in the order GT32 (4.12 × 10−8 mol cm−2) < GT31 (4.29 × 10−8 mol cm−2) < GT23 (4.58 × 10−8 mol cm−2) < GT5 (4.90 × 10−8 mol cm−2), which is compatible with the Voc order of the DSSCs and the degree of solubility of the employed dyes as revealed by the electronic absorption spectra. The dye loading amounts for the di-anchoring dyes are lower than those of the mono-anchoring dyes. This can be explained by the fact that two anchoring groups occupying two adsorption sites, which leads to lower dye loading amounts.

To evaluate the effect of the anchoring groups on the inhibition of dye aggregation, 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was cosensitized with the four dyes and the relevant J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 3b and Table 2. The Jsc, Voc and FF values of the DSSCs based on these dyes with CDCA are in the range of 1.33–2.90 mA cm−2, 0.467–0.520 V and 0.66–0.69, respectively. The corresponding PCE values are in the order GT5 (1.04%) > GT23 (0.70%) > GT31 (0.53%) > GT32 (0.41%), showing the same trend as dyes without CDCA. For a fair comparison, the DSSC based on a zinc phthalocyanine dye (TT1) that was synthesized according to the literature was also tested under the same conditions and it exhibited a PCE of 3.27% (Fig. S31). The PCE values of DSSCs based on GT5, GT31 and GT32 in the presence of CDCA represent over 40% of enhancement compared with the device without CDCA, which indicates that the co-adsorbent efficiently retards dye aggregation. However, the DSSC with GT23 only obtains 19% enhancement with respect to the device without CDCA. This can be attributed to the limited degree of dye aggregation due to its relatively non-planar structure because of having only the carboxyethynyl anchoring group which is compatible with the absorption spectrum of the TiO2 surface.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined to confirm the trend of Jsc variation in the DSSCs. Without CDCA, the order of IPCE values is GT32 (7.7%) < GT31 (9.6%) < GT23 (15.8%) < GT5 (16.0%) (Fig. 4a), which is parallel to the Jsc order of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, the addition of CDCA enhances the IPCE values due to the suppressed dye aggregation. On the other hand, the increment in IPCE value of GT23 was less than those of the others, which may be due to its low aggregation tendency. It is also noticeable that the integrated IPCE (JIPCEsc) values of these dyes are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves (Table 2). As a result, the highest IPCE value was still found for the GT5-based cell, owing to its relatively higher molar extinction coefficient.
To evaluate the charge recombination process in the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under dark conditions. The radius of the bigger semicircle in the Nyquist plots represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface of photoanode/dye/electrolyte (Fig. 5a). The Rrec value increased in the order of GT32 (68 Ω) < GT31 (72 Ω) < GT23 (93 Ω) < GT5 (108 Ω), suggesting the recombination would be most hindered in GT5. The electron lifetimes (τe), which can be estimated by the equation τe = 1/2πf (f: the peak frequency of the low-frequency region in Bode plots), are 2.48, 3.81, 9.03 and 13.89 ms for GT32, GT31, GT23, and GT5, respectively (Fig. 5b). Therefore, both Rrec and τe are well in line with the Voc values.

The molecular structures of the compounds GT23, GT31, GT32, and GT5 in the ground state was fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory and their minimal energy structures were achieved. The vibrational frequencies were calculated to confirm that all of the calculated structures were states of minimal energy, and all of them were found to have positive values. All of the optimized structures present a planar conformation in the region of the phthalocyanine core. Because the carboxyl moiety can adopt different positions in the substituent moiety (GTX-Y), we optimized several conformations and a partial view of the position of the carboxyl moiety is presented in Fig. 6. In this figure, we present the absolute energy values obtained from theoretical calculations and also the relative energy, which was calculated as the difference between the conformation and the stable structure. Compounds GT23 and GT5 present two positions for carboxyl that are coplanar with the phthalocyanine. In both cases, the conformation OCOH (GT23-1) is more stable by 0.07 kcal mol−1 for GT23 and by 0.02 kcal mol−1 for GT5 (GT5-1) than the conformation OHCO. For the compounds with two carboxyl moieties, three conformations were calculated for GT32 and two conformations for GT31. In the case of GT32, each carboxyl could be in the same position (GT32-1), or have a similar structure but the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group could have a rotation of 180° (GT32-2), forming a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl of the other substituent. The third option would be having the OH groups in the inner region (GT32-3). The conformation GT32-2 is the most stable, due to the formation of the hydrogen bond (1.89 Å), thus preventing the rotation of the –COOH group. The other conformations are less stable by 3.27 (GT32-1) and 2.99 (GT32-3) kcal mol−1 than GT32-2. Similarly, the conformations for GT31 include the position OHCO (GT31-1) and that having the inner OH groups (GT31-2). The energy difference between these conformations is insignificant (0.02 kcal mol−1), with GT31-2 being the most stable. For GT31, hydrogen bonding is not possible between the carboxyl moieties because the rotation of H(OH) at 180° produces a repulsion with the nearest H of the benzene ring. It is important to note that the planarity of the macrocycle is not affected by the different positions of the carboxyl moiety. In the case of compounds with two carboxyl groups, GT32 shows that the substituents are coplanar with one another and also with the macrocycle. The acetylene moieties favor the coplanarity because they avoid the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms of the carboxyl and those of the benzene ring of the macrocycle. In contrast, in GT31, a deviation of 3° between the benzene rings of the substituents may be due to the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms of the rings. In addition, these rings show a deviation of 16° to the phthalocyanine, and could affect the charge transfer from the macrocycle to the carboxyl moieties. The fully optimized structures of minimal energy are shown in Fig. 7, in front and side views, where they can be seen in their planar form.

The aliphatic chain in all compounds is located in the same plane of the phthalocyanine. These results can be explained in terms of the bond critical points (BCP) and the ring critical points (RCPs) calculated using the Atoms in Molecules Theory (AIM) of Bader. With this aim, we carried out calculations to obtain the BCPs and RCPs for the more stable conformations mentioned above. A BCP appears as a consequence of an interaction between one β hydrogen atom of the benzene ring of the phthalocyanine and the carbon atom of the aliphatic chain bonded to the sulfur atom with a density ρ(r) = 0.01. Because of that, a five-membered ring is formed and one RCP appears with ρ(r) = 0.01. The same occurs with the other chains in all compounds. As an illustration, we show the results for GT32-2 in Fig. 8 and for all compounds in Fig. S32. The formation of these critical points and the five-membered ring could lead to a rigid chain with fewer degrees of freedom, and thus avoid the aggregation of the phthalocyanines at the experimental level. The stretching of the chains could favor the charge transfer from these to the macrocyclic core and the carboxyl moieties.
On the other hand, in the region of the substituent, we note for GT32-2 and GT31-2 the presence of a ring critical point that leads to an eleven-membered ring for the former (ρ(r) = 0.0024) and a twelve-membered ring for the latter (ρ(r) = 0.0007). These results indicate a stronger interaction in the region for GT32-2, which is a consequence of the formation of the hydrogen bond. This suggests a more rigid site and less mobility of the –OH groups that have the capacity to impact the interaction with the semiconductor TiO2. The lower electron density values at the RCP for GT31-2 could be explained by the deviation in the planarity between the benzene rings of 3° that prevents the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms (Fig. S32).
Finally, it can be seen that the ρ(r) values at the ring critical points are very similar for the four molecules, which suggests that the substituent moiety does not affect the electron density in the molecular plane. However, the π electron density will be different, and this can be observed in the substituent effect, as discussed in the next section.

The electronic absorption spectra calculated using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) are very much dependent on the functionals. Based on our experience in the study of the optical properties of porphyrins and phthalocyanines in which we have used different density functionals, we have chosen the M06 and PBE0 functionals to perform our study in this work. We calculated the electronic spectra for the systems GT23-2, GT31-2, GT32-2, and GT5-2 in the solution phase using the same solvent as that employed in the experiment. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used for all the systems except GT31-2 for which a mixture of THF and pyridine was employed. The more relevant parameters obtained from the calculations for PBE0 are presented in Table 3 and they correspond to the excitation energy and wavelength of each absorption band, the oscillator strength that gives information about the intensity of the band, the assignment of the band, and the main molecular orbitals that participate in the electronic transition. The results for M06 are shown in Table S2. To find which density functional best describe the optical properties of the investigated systems, the deviation of the computed data from the experimental data was determined (Table S2). Table 3 shows all the Pc structures calculated at the PBE0 level and their typical optical bands, Q- and B-bands. Two strong Q bands in the near-IR region (600–700 nm) and one B band with a similar or less intensity in the UV region at around 330 nm were obtained using the PBE0 level of theory (Table 3). Similar results were obtained for M06 (Table S2). The deviations from experiments computed for Q bands obtained via PBE0 are in the range of 0.01–0.11 eV and are smaller than those obtained for M06 (0.06–0.19 eV). The computed deviations are minimal and they are within the acceptable range for this type of calculation.

In all cases, except for GT32-2 (M06, PBE0), the B bands have a higher deviation (≈0.3 eV) and the Q bands have a smaller deviation (0.1 eV or less), suggesting that the computed Q bands are in good agreement with the experimental data. This criterion was employed in choosing the most suitable functional for the investigated systems. The adopted functional was used for the other calculations.
The analysis of the substituent effect with PBE0 indicates that the longest wavelength corresponding to the Q band is in the following order: GT32-2 > GT31-2 > GT23-2 > GT5-2. This result is similar to that obtained from the experimental level GT31 > GT32 > GT23 > GT5 except for the absorption of GT31 and GT32. The nearest absorption to NIR of the latter compounds indicates that the substitution in the two β positions of the phthalocyanine favors absorption due to an additional number of π electrons. With this in mind, it would be expected that GT31 would absorb at the longest wavelength due to the additional phenyl group in each substituent together with the acetylene moiety. To clear this difference with the experiment, we investigated under the same conditions as those used for the previous calculations (basis set, type, and model of solvent) the absorption of the longest Q band for GT31-2 and GT32-2 using other functionals; TPSSh (meta GGA, 10% HF), CAM-B3LYP (range-separated GGA), and M06-2X (meta GGA, 54% HF). It was found that such absorptions for GT32-2 using the functionals in the above listed order were 755, 698, and 679 nm, while for GT31-2 the absorptions were 737, 695, and 675 nm accordingly, following the order of the listed functionals. These three functionals give results that followed the same trend as those obtained for PBE0 and M06. GT32-2 presents the longest λ for the Q band compared to GT31-2, with a difference of 18, 3, and 4 nm between both compounds for TPSSh, CAM-B3LYP, and M06-2X, respectively.
A possible explanation to the theoretical results could be that the acetylene moieties in GT32-2 are coplanar with the macrocycle, and the phenyl rings in GT31-2 show a deviation out of the plane of 16° with the macrocycle, which prevents a better delocalization of π electrons along the molecule leading to a shorter wavelength.
The substituent effect provokes a red-shift in the more relevant bands (Table 3, PBE0) when the pair of compounds were compared individually, e.g., GT23-2–GT32-2 (37 nm) and GT5-2–GT31-2 (27 nm). Fig. 9 shows the spectra calculated using TD-DFT in the range of 270–730 nm. Besides the Q and B bands, the calculations predict a band of lesser intensity at around 423–457 nm (Fig. 9) and is red-shifted in the di-anchoring Pcs relative to the mono-anchoring Pcs.

As shown in Table 1, all Q bands calculated with PBE0 correspond to transitions H → L and H → L+1 for the first band and second band, respectively, with a characteristic of the type π → π*. These molecular orbitals are located mainly in the macrocycle, as shown in Fig. 10. It is important to note that the LUMO in all phthalocyanines has a contribution from the acetylene moieties. It means that these excited states suggest a charge transfer toward the region of the anchoring moiety (carboxyl) that could favor the interaction with the semiconductor TiO2.

For B bands, the excited states are represented by several electronic transitions that are difficult to analyze. For this reason, the natural transition orbitals (NTO) that provide complete information about the excited states were computed (Fig. 10). Both occupied and virtual NTOs show an important contribution from the macrocyclic core with a character of the type π → π*, and particularly the contribution of the acetylene moiety was noted in the virtual NTO, which was similar to that observed in the LUMO.
The band predicted in the range of 423–457 nm corresponds to the transition H−3 → L for all compounds except GT31-2 for which the band corresponds to the H−3 → L+1 transition. In the four compounds except for GT31-2, the occupied orbital is located on the hexyl chains and the electronic transition shows a charge transfer from these chains to the core of the macrocycle that corresponds to the LUMO orbital. It means that the hexyl chains also participate in the formation of the excited states that are relevant for dye-sensitized solar cells.
We also investigate the charge transfer (CT) transitions, and the longest, strongly intense CT bands correspond in all cases to the H → L+2 transition as shown in Table 4. These bands appear in the visible region between 429 and 465 nm. The compounds with two carboxyl moieties present a red-shifted absorption compared to those having one moiety, with a difference of 36 nm between GT23-2 and GT32-2 and 20 nm between GT5-2 and GT31-2. Other CT bands of less intensity appear in the visible region that involve LUMO+2 and LUMO+3, where the latter has a strong contribution of the anchoring group and substituents, mainly in GT32-2 and GT31-2 (see Fig. 10). Other occupied molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S33.

In summary, besides Q and B bands, these compounds present other electronic absorptions in the visible region that include the participation of the anchoring group and substituents, which suggests that these compounds could be good photosensitizers to interact with the semiconductor TiO2.
The HOMO–LUMO gaps (ΔEH–L) for the Pcs were also calculated and they are presented in Table 5. The trend of the computed ΔEH–L is in the order of GT32-2 < GT31-2 < GT23-2 < GT5-2. It means that compounds with two carboxyl moieties have a lower ΔEH–L value, favoring absorption in the longer wavelength region relative to the other Pcs. The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) at the longest Q band was obtained using the equation, LHE = 1–10−f, where f is the oscillator strength. The photocurrent response has been found to depend on the LHE values. It should be noted that this parameter (LHE) cannot provide adequate information on the efficiency of a DSSC, and other parameters including the electron injection efficiency (Φinj) and charge collection efficiency are required as shown by Sanusi et al. The LHE data are in the order of GT31-2 > GT32-2 > GT5-2 > GT23-2, confirming that compounds with two carboxyl moieties are better compounds for light-harvesting.

The electron injection from the phthalocyanine (dye) to TiO2 was calculated using the conduction band edge of TiO2 of −4.05 eV in the vacuum using the equation ΔEinj = ELUMO,dye − ECB,TiO2, as shown in Table 5. In all cases, the ΔEinj value is positive and the LUMO energy level is higher than the TiO2 conduction band edge, which indicates that the electron injection process could occur. The decreasing order of ΔEinj is GT5-2 > GT23-2 > GT31-2 > GT32-2, which is in good agreement with the trend obtained for PCE in this work. In Fig. 11, the scheme of the five HOMOs and five LUMOs calculated for the systems and both the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) for TiO2 anatase are shown. It can be seen that for all phthalocyanines, the LUMO orbitals are above the conduction band, indicating that the injection process from the dye to TiO2 is favorable.

The complex formed by the interaction of the metal phthalocyanine with a cluster of TiO2 by the anchoring group was optimized using the Quantum ATK package.

The TiO2 cluster was obtained from the crystallographic structure of anatase. More details about the cluster are presented in the Computational details section. To avoid the deformation of TiO2, we optimized the complex with constraints for the semiconductor that implied the use of frozen TiO2. For the interaction –O(OH)⋯Ti to occur, the carboxyl moieties are located in regions where such interaction is feasible. Hence in this section, we will use the generic nomenclature for the compounds (GT23, GT31, GT32, and GT5). The optimized structures of the complexes are shown in Fig. 12. In all cases, the anchoring group (–COOH) is made to approach one titanium atom of TiO2 anatase with a separating distance of 2.23 and 2.18 Å for GT23 and GT5, respectively. GT32 and GT31 present two anchoring groups that can interact with two titanium atoms. For all complexes, the interaction is monodentate, i.e. one oxygen atom interacts with one titanium atom. The calculations show the following distances for –O(OH) interacting with Ti atom: (2.33 and 2.26 Å) and (2.17 and 2.30 Å) for GT32, and GT31, respectively. The values are similar and indicate that in all complexes a van der Waals interaction –O(OH)⋯Ti occurs. Similar distances have been reported for other acids adsorbed onto the anatase TiO2 (101) surface. The covalent distances O–Ti in anatase TiO2 are 1.93 and 1.98 Å.
We also found the formation of one hydrogen bonding H(OH)⋯O(TiO2) at distances 1.99 and 2.01 Å for GT23 and GT5, respectively, and two hydrogen bonding with distances of (2.19 and 2.04 Å) and (1.91 and 2.00 Å) for GT32 and GT31, respectively. The carbonyl oxygen atom does not have interaction with the Ti atom. In summary, these results show, as expected, an affinity between the phthalocyanine and the TiO2 cluster by the oxygen of the hydroxyl moiety.
For the optimized complexes, we calculated the interaction energy between the TiO2 cluster and the Pcs using the equation ΔEint = EGTX–TiO2 − (ETiO2 + EGTX), where GTX represents the compounds (e.g. GT23). The energy of the fragment (TiO2, GTX) was calculated with the optimized geometry of the complex in the gas phase. Because of the size of the complexes, we could not calculate the interaction energy corrected by the basis set superposition error (BSSE). All the values of ΔEint are negative showing that the interaction between the fragments is exergonic and thus the interacting system is energetically stable. The interaction trend in the descending order is GT31 > GT32 > GT5 > GT23 with values of −2.76, −2.25, −2.11 and −1.01 eV, respectively. These results indicate that GT31 and GT32 have the most enhanced interaction with TiO2 semiconductor compared to the rest of the compounds, and could be due to the presence of two anchoring groups.

Fig. 12 shows the frontier molecular orbitals, HOMO, and LUMO, calculated for the complexes. It can be seen that for all of them, the HOMO is located on the phthalocyanine core and the sulfur atom, which is the donor species, and the LUMO is located on a small region of TiO2, which is the acceptor species. Specifically, we found that the LUMO is mainly on two titanium atoms and has a composition of d atomic orbitals, and a less amount is on the oxygen atoms. The LUMO also is located on the edges of the cluster, which can be explained in terms of the fewer number of the surrounding oxygen atoms, and corresponds to sites of low electron density. According to the model used for GTX–TiO2, it is suggested that the charge transfer between the fragments is localized rather than delocalized on TiO2.

In summary, four push–pull zinc phthalocyanine dyes containing one or two carboxyethynyl anchoring groups have been developed as sensitizers for DSSCs. Among the synthesized dyes, the presence of a carboxyethynyl group in GT23 can suppress dye aggregation onto TiO2 due to its non-planar structure. However, in the presence of CDCA as a coadsorbent, the phenyl carboxyethynyl group containing dye GT5 exhibited the highest photovoltaic performance. The lower performances of GT31 and GT32 than GT5 are attributed to the poor charge injection into TiO2 and lower molar extinction coefficients. Using DFT and AIM, ring critical points (RCPs) in the aliphatic chains of all compounds and in between the two substituents of GT32 and GT31 were calculated. These results suggest that the torsion of the chains would be less probable and these chains could avoid the aggregation between the compounds in the solution phase. Similar behavior would have the substituents where the anchoring groups are located and that would allow for both carboxyl moieties to interact with TiO2. On the other hand, the time-dependent DFT approach (PBE0/6-31G(d,p)) predicts very well the experimental UV-Vis spectra with an error of up to 0.11 eV for the Q bands and 0.3 eV for the B bands. Compounds with two carboxyl moieties favor red-shifted absorption, as obtained in the experiment. These calculations also show charge transfer bands in the visible light region of the type phthalocyanine core → substituent with carboxyl moiety. We also computed the interaction energy between the compound and the anatase TiO2 cluster and found that the monodentate van der Waals interaction –O(OH)⋯Ti(TiO2) occurred, with GT31 and GT32 having the major interaction. The calculations of electron injection from the phthalocyanine to TiO2 predicted the same experimental trend of PCE where GT5 gave the best photovoltaic response. Consequently, this work demonstrates that the number and nature of anchoring groups are critical in the design and synthesis of phthalocyanine sensitizers for DSSCs.

Full molecular geometry optimization was performed for the ground state of the GT23, GT32, GT5, and GT31 phthalocyanines using density functional theory (DFT) in the gas phase. We used the hybrid functional B3LYP and the Pople basis set 6-31G(d,p). The B3LYP functional was chosen for the geometry optimization based on previous works for porphyrins and phthalocyanines, where a good agreement was obtained with the experimental data. Calculation of vibrational frequencies was carried out to confirm that the optimized structures are states of minimal energy and therefore are stable structures. All vibrational frequencies have positive values that confirm the minimal energy for all of the phthalocyanines. The UV-Vis electronic absorption spectra were calculated using the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approach in a solvent medium. The solvents chosen for these calculations are those used in the experiment in this work: tetrahydrofuran (THF) for GT23, GT32, and GT5, and a mixture of THF and pyridine (9.5 mL THF + 0.5 mL Pyridine) for GT31. To simulate the solvent, we perform self-consistent reaction field calculations (SCRF) using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) and the atomic radii and non-electrostatic terms for Truhlar and coworkers’ SMD solvation model. Dielectric constants of 7.6 for THF and 7.84 for the mixture THF + pyridine were used in the TD-DFT calculations. The dielectric constant for the mixture of solvents (εm) was obtained using the formula εm = xTHFεTHF + xpyrεpyr, where xTHF and xpyr are the mole fractions of THF and pyridine in the mixture, respectively, and εTHF and εpyr are the dielectric constants of THF (7.6) and pyridine (12.3), respectively.

To calculate the excited states, singlet–singlet vertical transitions of the Franck–Condon type and 40 excited states for each system are computed. The hybrid functionals M06 and PBE0 were used for the four phthalocyanines, and specifically for GT31 and GT32, we added the functionals TPSSh, CAM-B3LYP and M06-2X. The molecular orbitals (MOs) were computed to understand the theoretical absorption bands obtained in terms of the electronic transitions between MOs, the typical characteristic of phthalocyanines, B and Q bands, and the charge transfer bands. All calculations for geometry optimization and electronic absorption spectra were performed using the Gaussian 09 package. To get information about the topology of the electron density, we calculated the bond and ring critical points in the optimized geometry using the AIMALL package.
To know about the interaction between the dye (phthalocyanine) and the semiconductor (TiO2), we computed a complex formed for these fragments, for which a cluster model of TiO2 extracted from the anatase-phase (101) crystallographic structure was used. It corresponds to a surface cluster model that consists of 40 titanium atoms and 82 oxygen atoms [Ti40,O82] and four hydrogen atoms saturating the oxygen dangling bonds. The molecular structure of the dye–TiO2 complex is partially optimized, where TiO2 is frozen to retain the anatase-phase structure, and the dye with the anchoring group (–COOH) that approaches a titanium atom is fully optimized. The interaction is monodentate and one –O(OH) interacts with one titanium atom. This type of constraint has been successfully used in studies of the interaction between TiO2 and other dyes. The complexes were optimized at the DFT level of theory with Grimme's D3 dispersion correction using the Quantum ATK package. All of the atoms were represented by the double-ζ-polarized (DZP) basis set, along with the PseudoDojo norm-conserving pseudopotential, employing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) exchange–correlation functional.
