Since their discovery over a decade ago, fluorescent carbon nanodots, or C-dots, have seen a drastic rise in various synthetic approaches as well as widespread applicability across diverse research fields. More recently, carbon nanodots have shown particular promise in a wide range of photovoltaic devices as inexpensive sensitizer candidates and as functional dopants within photoactive materials, electrolytes, and counter electrodes. While still in their infancy, carbon nanodot-incorporated devices already show encouraging enhancements in device performance, although due to current limiting factors such as poor charge collection and photocurrent generation, there is still much room for further discovery and improvement. Herein, we provide a detailed overview of the current state-of-the-art carbon nanodot-incorporated devices (and their limitations) and suggest some paths forward in the hopes of sparking new ideas on how to better synthesize and purify these materials, which will ultimately lead to a more thorough understanding of their properties so that further performance enhancements within carbon nanodot-incorporated solar-energy harvesting systems may be realized.

Advances in solar energy conversion and storage are vital to a much needed paradigm shift away from our current (unsustainable and environment-polluting) fossil fuels-based energy economy. Harnessing solar energy via photovoltaic processes is currently hindered by high cost-to-energy output ratios, demanding the development of devices of lower cost and greater efficiency. In addition, state-of-the-art devices are largely based on materials which are scarce, toxic, and/or expensive to source or manipulate. One class of materials which is making rapid inroads in photovoltaics is carbon nanodots, a category of functional nanocarbon which includes graphene quantum dots. Due to outstanding optical properties, low intrinsic (cyto)toxicity, ease of synthesis, and inherent conductivity, nanoscale carbon dots are extremely promising contenders as inexpensive, sustainable alternatives to conventional materials for fabricating competitive photovoltaic devices.


Depositing over 86 PW of energy onto the Earth's surface every year, the sun is a key player in the paradigm shift from our unsustainable and environment-polluting, petroleum-based economy. Unfortunately, harnessing this solar energy via photovoltaic (PV) processes is currently hindered by high cost-to-energy output ratios, necessitating the development of low-cost, higher efficiency devices. In addition, many state-of-the-art devices are based on unsustainable and environmentally hazardous materials that will require greener replacements for a solar energy based economy to be realized. Fluorescent carbon nanodots (CNDs)—emerging carbonaceous nanomaterials distinct from fullerenes, graphenes, carbon nanotubes, and other carbon allotropes—are increasingly popular, versatile materials within these devices owing to their unique optical properties (e.g., size-dependent and excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence) which are akin to those of well-known semiconductor quantum dots (sQDs). In addition to their intriguing fluorescence properties, CNDs sport more eco-friendly properties over sQDs such as biocompatibility, inertness, and low toxicity making them extremely promising contenders as cheap, green alternatives for a plethora of applications that include (bio)sensing, bioimaging, and for fabricating competitive PV devices, with some even displaying enhanced performance over the state-of-the-art.

Since their unintentional discovery in 2004, CNDs have seen an exponential rise in synthetic development and widespread utilization, with over 3500 publications emerging within the last 10 years. The synthetic approaches employed for their formation are generally separated into two camps: top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down approaches, which consist of arc-discharge, laser ablation, and electrochemical routes, involve the cleavage of large macroscale carbon sources into smaller and smaller particles, eventually resulting in CNDs. On the contrary, bottom-up approaches, which include thermal, hydrothermal, and microwave-assisted routes, consist of assembling the CNDs from molecular precursors, essentially in brick-by-brick (e.g., atom, molecule, monomer) fashion. Since the advent of CNDs, there has been a vast amount of literature published that comprehensively reviews the synthetic tactics employed; therefore, the synthetic approaches will not be covered in detail within this review and readers are directed elsewhere.
In general, CNDs (or C-dots) are nano-sized (<10 nm) particles containing a carbon core and a diverse array of (primarily oxygenated) functional groups, with carbonyl and hydroxyl moieties being among the most common functionalities found. Due to the vast, and poorly understood, nature of the mechanistic growth and resulting core structure of these materials, a handful of sub-classes of CNDs have arisen, with these materials all-too-often arbitrarily and haphazardly classified with new names or acronyms to give the false impression that a new material has been generated. Currently, there are over ten commonly reported sub-classifications that fall within the realm of CNDs, including graphene quantum dots (GQDs), carbon quantum dots (CQDs), carbon dots (CDs), carbogenic dots, carbon nanoclusters, polymer dots (P-dots), nitrogen-rich quantum dots (N-dots; which are essentially N-doped GQDs or CQDs), graphene oxide (quantum) dots, and graphitic carbon nitride (quantum) dots, which has resulted in many inconsistencies and confusion within the field. As pointed out by Baker et al., many years before the genesis of some of these new sub-classes, one should take care in the classification of the resultant product. This was echoed in a recent, and much needed, feature article by Cayuela and co-workers which highlighted the dire need for consistency within the field. These authors proposed that only three names (GQDs, CQDs, and CNDs) be used to classify these materials with the names originating from the chemical, physical, and photophysical properties inherent to each sub-class. To reiterate their proposition, the crystallinity of the carbon core in these particles and the presence (or absence) of quantum confinement, which is an absolute necessity to be considered a QD, should dictate how they are classified. Therefore, a nano-sized carbonaceous particle that contains an amorphous core and does not display quantum confinement is simply a CND. On the other hand, when a particle does display quantum confinement and possesses a crystalline, graphitic-like carbon core then (and only then) may it be classified as a CQD or GQD. The distinction between these two then comes down to the three-dimensionality of the nanoparticle: CQDs are quasi-spherical nanoparticles consisting of multiple layers of graphitic sheets, whereas GQDs consist of only a single layer of nano-sized graphene. These structures are schematically represented in Scheme 1A. For the purposes of this review, the generic use of the term CNDs will encompass both CQDs and GQDs while the results from individual journal references discussed herein will refer to specific examples in the manner the authors originally designated. It should also be pointed out that these author designations have not always been correct and, in some instances, too few data are presented to equivocally claim one carbon dot sub-class or another. To be clear, CQDs and GQDs are distinct entities and we urge others to adhere to the standardized nomenclature proposed by Cayuela and co-workers.
Due to their alluring properties and greener nature, CNDs have recently shown promise in a wide variety of photovoltaic devices, playing the role of inexpensive sensitizer replacement in sensitized (mesoscopic) metal-oxide based devices—typically referred to as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)—or functioning as a dopant in the photoactive material, electrolyte, or counter electrode of other device architectures (e.g., polymer, solid-state, and perovskite solar cells). While still in their infancy, CND-incorporated devices exhibit similar efficiencies and performances to those initially seen with sQD-based devices at a similar stage in their evolution, suggesting wide scope for improvement. However, to achieve the full potential of CNDs, inconsistencies in their preparation and purification, which have obscured the true origin of their (photophysical) properties, need to be fully addressed. Historically, the origin of the (excitation wavelength-dependent) fluorescence properties (Scheme 1B), which remains a subject of debate, has been attributed to the optical selection of differently sized nanoparticles (quantum effect) and/or different emissive traps on the CND surface. In short, the fluorescence is dictated by the size of the carbon core, the dots' surface functionality, and/or heteroatom doping. However, recent evidence suggests that the fluorescence properties arise from an ensemble of discrete fluorophores and these fluorophores may not actually be carbonaceous nanoparticles but are in fact molecular/polymeric in nature. In the following review, we will cover CND applications in various photovoltaic devices (solid-state, quasi-solid-state, mesoscopic, polymer) in which the carbon nanomaterials were used as light harvesters, electron donors/acceptors, and electrode/electrolyte dopants, for example. It should be noted that this review mainly covers the application of carbon nanodots within complete photovoltaic devices; it does not fully encompass their application within photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical systems, which have already been extensively reviewed elsewhere, or as metal-free photocatalysts. However, the application of CNDs within these systems provides further evidence for their promising potential within PV devices, especially as a sensitizer within metal oxide based devices due to their efficient light harvesting and charge injection/separation properties. While the aforementioned reviews on CNDs cover many of the potential applications of this nascent nanomaterial, including the newly implemented application of CNDs in photovoltaics, the incorporation of these materials into photovoltaic devices has only been briefly mentioned. To the best of our knowledge, only a single review has appeared which emphasizes PV applications, and even that contribution largely focuses on synthetic approaches. Therefore, this review strictly covers the application of CNDs within PV devices, how the devices are influenced by the inclusion of CNDs, and the directions the field needs to take to truly exploit these nascent carbon nanomaterials within light-harvesting systems.

On top of the intriguing photoluminescent phenomena that mirror sQDs and the greener nature of these materials, CNDs display other properties that make them attractive and promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. Depending on the precursors and synthetic approach employed, and therefore the resultant composition, CNDs can often display high optical absorptivity across much of the visible light range, making them a possible alternate sensitizer in DSSCs. Also, due to the large π-electron network (sp2 core) within crystalline CQDs/GQDs, they can also function as electron acceptors/donors, a conducting medium for electron transfer, or heterojunction forming charge dissociation sites, which allows them to serve as charge carrier sources, funnels, bridges, etc.

The current state-of-the-art DSSCs typically employ Ru-based sensitizers which offer great performance but these sensitizers are often time consuming to synthesize and rely on the Ru-metal center, which is scarce and expensive, necessitating an immediate replacement for sustainable, environmentally conscience implementation. Owing to their fascinating optical properties, CNDs are one such exciting substitute. Yan et al., through a tailored step-wise organic synthesis, showed that GQDs can display large molar extinction coefficients across much of the visible range as well as in the near-UV and near-IR ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. Their GQDs displayed similar absorption features to those found in the most commonly employed Ru-sensitizer (N719) within DSSCs. N719 shows two absorption peaks centered at 389 and 534 nm with respective molar extinction coefficients (εm) of 1.40 × 104 and 1.42 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The striking difference between the GQDs and N719 is that the GQDs display a large absorbance below 450 nm and exhibit a large band centered at 591 nm with a εm of 1.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1 which is almost an order of magnitude larger than that of N719. To further enhance the spectral response of these materials, heteroatoms (other than oxygen) can be incorporated into the core or functional periphery to introduce new energy levels not present within undoped CNDs. Davy et al. reported that the band gap and, therefore, the spectral response of contorted hexabenzocoronenes, which are structurally related to GQDs, can be decreased and increased, respectively, through the functionalization of heteroatom containing cyclic moieties, providing evidence that the same may hold true within CNDs. Indeed, it is well documented that heteroatom doping (i.e., B, N, P, S, Si, Cl, Cu) or selectively tailoring the functional groups of these carbon nanomaterials can enhance their optical properties (i.e., bathochromic shifts in the absorbance and/or fluorescence emission), which, in theory, could afford enhanced collection of more of the solar spectrum.
While high molar absorbtivities and wider spectral windows are undoubtedly beneficial, it is absolutely necessary that these materials present appropriate band alignments to ensure the desired directional flow of charge carriers within the device architecture in which the CNDs are implanted. Toward this, Yan et al., using a tight binding model, calculated the band gap energy and band edges of the GQDs mentioned above; the HOMO and LUMO were found to be 5.3 and 3.8 eV, respectively, below the vacuum level. Based on these values, they show, in principle, that CNDs can be utilized as the sensitizer in dye-sensitized devise owing to the fact that the CND should be capable of injecting an electron across the “dye”/semiconductor interface into the TiO2 and then in turn should be able to be reduced through an electron donation from the electrolyte (I3−/I−). Since then, many other experimental reports have emerged confirming an appropriate band alignment and efficient charge separation/electron injection capabilities for CNDs, CQDs, and GQDs, not only within sensitized metal oxide-based devices but also within other device architectures, such as solid-state and BHJ devices. The appropriate band alignments are schematically depicted in Scheme 2. While many as-synthesized CNDs have been shown to have appropriate band alignments within the devices they are implemented in, the tunability of these band edges would be highly advantageous so as to tailor the CNDs for specific applications (e.g., sensitizers, charge shuttles) within various PV architectures. Sun and co-workers reported in 2010 that the optical properties of laser-ablated, acid-oxidized CDs functionalized with PEG1500N closely resembled band gap like transitions typically found in sQDs. Since then, many reports have surfaced confirming these band gap like transitions and further showing that the band gap can be tuned by either the carbon core size and/or the surface functionality of the CNDs.
In addition to the aforementioned experimental results, theoretical studies into various components and processes within these devices have further reinforced their feasibility within PV applications. Studies into the electronic structure (e.g., photophysics) and band gap tunability of GQDs confirm that these properties can indeed be modulated by the GQD size/surface functionality and even by applying opposite electrostatic potentials across the dot. Additional studies into their roles as light absorbers/sensitizers have also been reported. Long investigated the difference between GQDs that were physisorbed or chemisorbed and found that in both instances the positive work function difference between the GQDs and TiO2 would drive electron transfer and charge separation across the interface. However, due to the covalent bond in the chemisorbed case, much more efficient charge separation would be obtained. Mandal et al. studied the electronic structure and demonstrated the potential of porphyrin functionalized GQDs in PV applications. Their results show that the HOMO is controlled by the porphyrin molecules while the LUMO is controlled by the GQD and either type-I or type-II band alignment can be obtained depending upon the size of the GQD within the nanocomposite; larger dots (>500 carbon atoms) show type-I alignment, while smaller dots (<500 carbon atoms) show type-II, which is preferred since there is charge separation within the system resulting in lower charge carrier recombination. Attaching electron donating groups to the larger nanocomposites resulted in type-II alignment and showed that the energy gap would increase with larger sized GQDs which should promote the rate of electron transfer. Their results indicate that these nanocomposites are an enticing prospect as a sensitizer within mesoscopic devices. A related study was also conducted using GQD-fullerene hybrids. All of the aforementioned properties of CNDs within this section make them very appealing as cheap, green alternatives within various components and architectures of photovoltaic devices, which are discussed in the following section and summarized in Tables 1–5 in section 4 and S1–S5 in the ESI. Tables S1–S5 mirror Tables 1–5 but contain additional information such as the CND precursors, functional groups, resultant size, and purification mode. All acronyms used within the tables are defined in Table S6.

PANI-GQD CE electropolymerized at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1
Inclusion of GQDs led to mace-like morphology compared to spherical NPs when electropolymerizing neat PANI, which enhanced surface area and conductivity. Performance depends on scan rate used for electropolymerization; scan rates of 30, 50, 80, and 100 mV s−1 led to lower JSC and FF producing a lower PCE

Pivotal work in the area of GQDs, especially regarding their application to opto-electronic devices such as solar cells, has been conducted by the Li research group. Driven by work conducted by Müllen and co-workers, in which large aromatic compounds containing up to 222 conjugated carbon atoms were synthesized but showed a tendency to aggregate essentially forming graphite, Li and co-workers have shown that these large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be stabilized and made soluble through steric stabilization by surface moieties. They've also recently shown that the colloidal GQDs can be aligned on polar surfaces through selective surface functionality (Fig. 1), the band gap and redox potentials can be tuned by size and surface groups, respectively (Fig. 2), they relax into triplet states which have longer lifetimes and diffusion lengths, and they possess slow-hot carrier relaxation which can lead to hot electron injection into a semiconductor such as TiO2. As mentioned in the previous section, Yan et al. synthesized these large colloidal GQDs through solution chemistry, starting with a benzene based precursor and building the molecule from the bottom-up to yield molecules with >100 conjugated carbon atoms (>40 fused benzene rings). Then by affixing multiple 2′,4′,6′-trialkyl-substituted phenyl moieties (labelled as R in Fig. 1C) to the edges of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, to shield the GQDs from one another, curbing the aggregation tendency of these particles, they were able to generate these large soluble nanocarbons. Fig. 1A and B display a schematic of this shielding strategy employed, where 1B is an energy-minimized configuration highlighting the enclosure of the graphene core (blue) by alkyl chains (black).

Due to the similar optical properties of these graphenes to the commonly employed dyes in DSSCs, Yan et al. incorporated the GQDs into mesoscopic TiO2 solar devices as the light absorbing medium, of which the generic architecture is shown in Fig. 3A. For the sensitization, the TiO2 photoanode was soaked in a solution of 1 (Fig. 1C) for 96 hours. Even though an extended staining period was used, the TiO2 films were only slightly coloured, displaying an optical density of 0.2 at 591 nm. Despite the low optical density, which the authors attribute to a low affinity of 1 for the oxide surfaces of TiO2, the devices still exhibited some photovoltaic action as evidenced in Fig. 1D (cyan curve). Under illumination of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2), the device produced a short-circuit current of 200 μA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.48 V with a fill factor of 0.58. The authors did not report a device power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) but it can easily be calculated from the following equation:
η(%) = Pmax/Pin × 100
where
Pmax = FF × JSC × VOC and Pin is the incident light power which in this case is 100 mW cm−2. Inputting their reported values into the above equation gives an overall device PCE of 0.06%. The open circuit voltage and fill factor are on the lower end but are comparable to the values for state-of-the-art ruthenium-sensitized devices. However, the device was severely limited by the photocurrent, which the authors attributed to the fact that only a small amount of GQDs were sensitized to the TiO2 during the extended soaking and those that were sensitized were only physisorbed due to a low GQD affinity for the TiO2 surface i.e., there was no covalent linkage between the GQDs and the TiO2 leading to poor electron injection.

It is well known that compounds containing carboxyl end groups will chemisorb onto oxide-containing semiconductor (TiO2) surfaces forming a covalent (ester) linkage between the two. Therefore, by varying the surface functionality of the GQDs, Li and co-workers were able to show that the nanomaterials could be aligned on polar surfaces through a covalent linkage between the GQDs and the substrate, which would essentially create a “slide” for the electrons to careen down into the TiO2, which is consistent with the theoretical studies by Long. Following their recently developed controlled organic synthesis, three differently functionalized GQDs were synthesized as depicted in Fig. 1C; GQD 1, which contains only the R group functionality, and GQDs 2 and 3, which are both additionally functionalized with carboxylic groups but vary in size. Using water and mica surfaces, which could serve as models for polar semiconducting oxide surfaces such as TiO2, they showed that compounds 1 and 2 orient themselves in a face-on geometry in which the GQD “disks” lay flat against the substrate and compound 3 adopts an edge-on geometry, in which the “disks” align themselves perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. 1C and D). The interplay between two crucial parameters determines the GQD's orientation: 1) cofacial intermolecular attractions and 2) cofacial molecule–substrate interactions. Typically with these disk-like molecules, if the cofacial molecule–substrate interactions are strong while the cofacial intermolecular attractions are weaker then the disk will align in the face-on geometry. If the intensity of the interactions is reversed than the disks will tend to align in the edge-on geometry. As the authors expected, compound 1, which does not contain any polar end groups to directly interact with the polar substrates, adopted the face-on geometry, maximizing the contact area and attraction, since the interactions are primarily of van der Waals forces. Through the attachment of polar carboxyl groups on the periphery of compounds 2 and 3, it was anticipated that this would cause a polar–polar interaction between the GQD and the substrate, thereby making the cofacial intermolecular attraction predominate, forcing the GQDs to stand on-edge. Compound 3 did in fact adopt the edge-on geometry while contrary to the expected results, compound 2 adopted the face-on geometry. The authors attributed this result to the positioning of the carboxyl groups in relation to the trialkyl moieties; the functional groups pre-installed to shield the GQDs from aggregation, also sterically shielded the acid groups, reducing their accessibility and preventing them from interacting with the polar substrate.
Based off these results, Li and co-workers again incorporated their colloidal GQDs as sensitizers in TiO2 based dye-sensitized devices. When using the smaller GQDs containing a carboxyl group (compound 3), despite them having a larger bandgap (which will be discussed shortly), a much larger JSC and, therefore, a larger PCE was observed as evidenced in Fig. 1D. The authors attributed the device performance increase to two factors: 1) the presence of the carboxyl groups leads to the edge-on alignment of the GQDs, generating a higher sensitizer packing density and 2) the covalent linkage between the TiO2 and GQDs leads to an increased electron transfer over the face-on geometry in which charge transfer must occur through space.
Yan et al. also recently demonstrated that the bandgap and redox potentials of their colloidal GQDs can be selectively tuned through varying the particle size and surface functionality, respectively (Fig. 2). The selective tuning of these properties is of great importance to solar energy conversion devices since the band gap determines the lowest energy wavelength that can be absorbed and redox potentials govern the charge transfer processes. Recently, it has been demonstrated that for conjugated polymer systems, the HOMO and LUMO levels can be raised or lowered by the incorporation of electron-donating groups or electron-withdrawing groups, respectively. Given that their GQDs are extensions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the authors speculated that, just as in the conjugated polymer systems, the covalent attachment of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups should alter the redox potentials of the GQDs. Through UV-vis absorption spectra and ultraviolet photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS), the band gaps and the redox potentials of their GQDs were calculated, respectively. The band gaps were determined from the red edge of the absorption spectra and using the ionization threshold energy probed from PYS the HOMO levels of the GQDs were found. The LUMO levels were then subsequently determined from the HOMO levels and band gap values. The authors employed two different sizes of GQDs, varying the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups covalently attached to the periphery of the GQDs as visualized in Fig. 2. In that particular study, compounds 1, 3, and 4 each contain a conjugated core comprising 168 carbon atoms whilst compounds 2, 5, and 6 all share the same 132-atom conjugated core. As expected, changing the size of the carbon core altered the resultant band gap; decreasing the GQD core increased the band gap from 1.4 eV (∼886 nm) to 1.6 eV (∼775 nm). It was also determined that by changing the surface functionality through covalent attachments of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating moieties, the redox potentials could be altered in respect to the non-functionalized GQD. The most significant change was observed for compound 5 (containing an electron-withdrawing carboxyl group), in which the HOMO level was lowered by 0.2 eV with respect to the non-functionalized compound 2. No difference was observed between compounds 3 and 4, despite the variation in functionality (3 – electron-withdrawing, 4 – electron-donating). The authors attribute this to the intermediate phenyl group in between the functional group and GQD acting like an electron sink, reducing the effects of the electron-withdrawing and -donating groups, which is also consistent with the results obtained for compound 6 (electron-donating group).
The authors noted that the change in size had no appreciable effect on the redox potentials while the variation in functionality had no appreciable effect on the bang gap. The experimental results were also compared to those obtained using a tight-binding model (values in parentheses in Fig. 2) and were shown to be in good agreement with one another as well as previously reported results. The ability to independently tune the band gaps and the redox potentials of the GQDs is of critical importance in photovoltaic applications since it enables the tailoring of the GQDs to absorb a larger range of the solar spectrum (varying sizes of GQDs can be sensitized to the photoanode to capture most of the solar irradiation) and enables the reduction of parasitic device resistances and charge recombination, i.e., ideal band edge alignments for efficient charge transfer, through the attachment of electron-donating or -withdrawing groups for customized redox potentials.
Another area of great interest relative to quantum dot based solar devices, and therefore CQD/GQD devices, is the extraction of hot carriers before they lose enough energy to cool to the band edges in an effort to exceed the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit. These hot carriers arise when incident radiation in excess of the band gap is absorbed which leads to highly excited states within the quantum dot. If the electrons in these high-energy states are not extracted quickly and efficiently, due to the fast hot carrier cooling common to quantum dot based devices, the absorbed energy will be lost in the form of heat leading to a lower observed device performance compared to its theoretical potential. It was anticipated that sQDs would display much slower hot carrier cooling than the bulk material due to the low probability of multiphonon processes, but in reality this is not observed due to multiple complex competing relaxation pathways. However, as pointed out by Mueller et al., GQDs have features that could naturally suppress these hot carrier relaxation pathways that plague sQDs. On the contrary, Trinastic et al. reported long excited carrier lifetimes in GQDs that depended on the functional ligand and the termination (zigzag vs. armchair configuration) of the GQDs, indicating the possibility of a phonon bottleneck.
Recently, Yu et al. reported on CND–GO nanocomposites the displayed efficient electron transfer from the CNDs to GO at a rate of 400 ps, weak phonon scattering, and slow cooling, all of which implicate the nanocomposites as potential candidates in hot carrier solar cells. Even further, Mueller et al. studied hot-carrier relaxation in the smaller (132 conjugated carbon atoms) colloidal GQDs discussed previously. Their results show that GQDs can possess slower hot carrier cooling than the bulk counterpart (up to 2 orders of magnitude slower), indicating that with the proper device engineering these hot carriers could be extracted to boost photovoltaic device performance. In a follow-up study to the aforementioned research, Williams et al. probed hot electron injection and the charge recombination dynamics for the same GQD tethered to a TiO2 surface via a carboxyl linker. They demonstrated ultrafast electron injection with a time constant <15 fs that consisted of a fast 80–130 fs channel (prompt recombination across the interface) and a slow 0.5–2 ps channel (hot electron injection, electron–phonon scatter cooling, followed by interfacial recombination). However, they concluded that, due to the size of the GQDs, under normal solar flux, multiple molecular excitations are not feasible, therefore the size of the nanostructures must be increased if they are to serve as an ideal sensitizer in hot carrier devices.
While much effort has been put forth by Li and colleagues in studying their bottom-up organically synthesized colloidal GQDs for photovoltaic applications, more specifically as a sensitizer in DSSCs, other research groups have employed other synthetic strategies for the production GQDs/CQDs and using different photoanode platforms, have shown their applicability as sensitizers (architecture of this device is schematically depicted in Fig. 3A). One of the, if not the very first, applications of CQDs as a sensitizer in a TiO2 based solar cell was shown by Mirtchev et al. Here the authors used a solution phase synthesis to generate water soluble CQDs through a dehydration of γ-butyrolactone by concentrated sulphuric acid. Since CQDs synthesized in aqueous media generally have a surface functionality consisting of –COOH, –COOR, –OH, etc. rendering them water soluble, it follows that these CQDs should be easily functionalized to a TiO2 photoanode through the carboxyl groups (identical functionalization chemistry as the Ru-based dye complexes) as shown with the GQDs synthesized by Li and co-workers discussed above. The CQD sensitized solar cell prepared by Mirtchev et al. displayed the following properties: JSC of 0.53 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.38 V, FF of 0.64, and η of 0.13% (Fig. 3D; orange curve). While the open-circuit voltage is slightly lower than that typically exhibited by Ru-based DSSCs, as in previous reports the short-circuit current density appears to be the limiting factor in these devices. The authors provide a few postulations as to why this may be the case: 1) the electrolyte employed, I3−/I−, is known to be corrosive towards other QDs decreasing the photocurrent but this seems unlikely since the CQDs are already heavily oxidized during their synthesis, 2) CQDs contain a distribution of different emissive trap states which could likely act as surface recombination centers for the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, 3) the charge injection properties of the CQDs are likely inferior to ultrafast metal-to-ligand charge transfers present in the Ru-based systems.
Fang et al. employed acid oxidized, PEG passivated GQDs as a co-sensitizer in tandem with N719. Their results showed that not only did the GQDs function as a sensitizer, injecting hot electrons into TiO2 and enhancing device performance, but they also notably affected the N719 uptake by the TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The concentration of GQDs used during device preparation, which was tuned by the quantity of GO used during the synthesis, determined the quantity of N719 sensitized to the TiO2 surface; a low concentration of GO (GQDs) had no discernible affect (whether it be beneficial or detrimental) on the dye uptake or performance whereas a high concentration of GO (GQDs) resulted in GQD aggregation, which decreased the dye uptake and, therefore, the PV performance. Balancing the GQD concentration and N719 uptake led to an enhancement of all parameters (except FF) over a device without any GQDs, which equated to a 20% increase in PCE (from 5.10% to 6.10%). To date, this is the best performance reported for a mesoscopic TiO2 based device that employs CNDs as a co-sensitizer.
On the other hand, a recent report by Wang et al. boasts the highest PCE (0.79%) for mesoscopic devices sensitized solely with CNDs. Through a simple pyrolysis of citric acid and ammonia, they arrived at 7–15 nm N-doped CDs. The extent of N-doping, which was easily tuned by varying the mass ratio of the precursors, strongly affected the optical properties, with an optimized ratio resulting in much improved absorptivity out to 550 nm. The extended absorbance, which arose from the introduction of new energy levels and trap states due to the N-doping (schematically shown in Fig. 3B), resulted in increased absorption of lower-energy photons and the subsequent injection of the photoexcited electrons into TiO2, evidenced by the enhanced device photocurrent, PCE (Fig. 3D; green curve), and IPCE (Fig. 3E; green curve).
One other interesting property of CNDs that has come to light and is currently being explored is their ability to up-convert incident infrared radiation to wavelengths in the visible region. However, recent evidence suggests that CNDs may not possess the ability to up-convert photons and the observed ‘up-converted’ fluorescence emission is simply normal fluorescence that is excited by the second order grating diffraction of the monochromator, therefore researchers need to carefully characterize the CNDs' photophysics as pointed out by Wen et al. so as to not attribute enhanced performance to a non-existent phenomenon. Nonetheless, this dubious property has been exploited in PV-related applications with performance enhancements attributed to ‘up-converted’ photons. Recently, Wang et al. generated nitrogen-doped CNDs through a one-pot reaction of melamine and glycerol to study the effects of heteroatom doping on the optical properties of the dots themselves as well in a photovoltaic device. The N-doped CNDs were shown to have a much larger two-photon cross section over their undoped counterparts. Inspired by this, the authors incorporated the doped CNDs into a TiO2 nanoparticle based solar device which displayed properties similar to other reported CND-integrated devices; JSC of 0.8 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.56 V, FF of 0.293, and η of 0.13% (Fig. 3E; blue curve). While the short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage are comparable to similar devices, the fill factor was quite low leading to the lower PCE. The authors attributed the low fill factor to a likely high charge recombination rate within the CND but since JV curves were not provided in the publication, it is difficult to validate this conclusion as other parasitic resistances can also lead to low fill factors. A high charge recombination rate should also lead to a lower short-circuit current density which is true in this case but it is still among the highest reported for C-dot sensitized devices. It is possible the fill factor could be limited by a high series resistance (RS) within the TiO2 photoanode or Pt counter electrode or a low shunt resistance (Rsh) caused by alternate current flow paths (charge recombination within the C-dot or with the electrolyte) but without the presentation of an JV curve it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion.
As mentioned above, the N-doped CNDs presented here displayed a large two photon cross-section, which is also apparent in the IPCE spectra (Fig. 3E). Without the CND sensitization the IPCE is essentially zero over the wavelength range tested (Fig. 3E; magenta curve) but upon sensitization two peaks arise; one at 340 nm and another at 700 nm. The authors attributed the first and main peak (340 nm), which displayed an IPCE of ∼25%, to single photon absorption by the CNDs (left panel Fig. 3C), while the 2nd peak (700 nm), which displayed an IPCE of ∼3%, arises from the large two photon cross-sections of the CNDs. Two energy conversion mechanisms are proposed (right panel Fig. 3C); one involving up-conversion by the CNDs (pathway 1) and the other relating to the re-absorption of up-converted fluorescence emission (pathway 2). Other reported works not discussed in this section that employed CNDs as a (co)sensitizer, (co)-sensitizer/photoanode dopant, electron donor/acceptor, or an electrolyte dopant within similar device architectures, as well as a sensitizer or photoanode dopant within non-metal oxide based photoanodes, are summarized in Tables 1 and S1.

While one of the most obvious uses of CNDs in a DSSC is a photoanode sensitizer due to their intriguing photophysical properties, CNDs also possess interesting electronic properties (charge transfer, electron acceptor, electron donator, etc.) which make them promising candidates as additives within other components of the solar cell, such as the counter electrode (CE). The most common CE utilized in DSSCs is a thin Pt film deposited onto a transparent conductive oxide coated glass substrate, due to Pt's high catalytic activity toward reducing I3−. While Pt as a CE produces some of the best photovoltaic performances, it is one of the more costly components of the DSSC. Recently conductive polymers, such as polypyrrole (PPy), have been employed to replace the Pt thin film due to their ease of production and low costs. Despite the benefits, conductive polymers suffer from relatively high charge transfer resistance limiting their practical applications. This poor conductivity can be overcome by doping the conductive polymer with a more conductive material as recently shown by Chen et al. in which PPy CEs were doped with various amounts of GQDs and their performances in a DSSC were compared to a typical Pt CE. The GQDs were synthesized from carbon black via a chemical oxidation using refluxing nitric acid and then added to a pyrrole solution (Py) in various weight ratios (GQDs:Py = 0.3, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30%). The GQDs/Py solution was electrochemically deposited onto a FTO coated glass substrate to generate a GQD doped PPy film.

The resultant GQD/PPy films were quite porous compared to the dense structure of a plain PPy film (Fig. 4A and B) which the authors attributed to the interactions between the negatively charged GQDs (from abundant oxygen groups; –COOH and –OH) and the positively charged N group on the pyrrole. The GQDs could act as nucleation sites, electrostatically adsorbing the Py and promoting the PPy growth, resulting in the porous structure (described by the authors as “nano-islands”). The authors reasoned that the more porous CE should increase the amount of electrocatalytically active centers and enhance reactant diffusion for better electrode kinetics and thermodynamics. This reasoning was confirmed through CV, EIS, and JV curves. The CV reduction peaks of the GQD-doped PPy electrodes were more positive and the peak current densities were higher than a plain PPy electrode verifying the higher amount of reactive centers and higher electrocatalytic activity. The redox current density of the doped electrodes increased with increasing GQD doping (attributed to an increase in active sites) up to 10% and then began to decrease with additional doping likely due to the GQD incorporation affecting the polymerization reducing the reactive sites. The EIS results showed that the semicircle diameter decreased with increasing GQD doping up to 20% suggesting that the GQDs improve the charge transfer rate throughout the polymer film (Fig. 5B).
The JV curve results (Fig. 4C and 5A) show that the PV device performance increases with increasing GQD concentration up to 10% but then decreases as the GQD concentration increases further. The highest performance at 10% produced the following parameters: VOC of 0.723 V, JSC of 14.36 mA cm−2, and a FF of 50.8% giving a PCE of 5.27%, which was better than a plain PPy CE and was comparable to a Pt CE. The slight GQD doping, up to 10%, decreases the internal resistance of the polymer film (increases JSC) and increases the charge transfer rate (increases FF) while a further increase in GQD doping would increase the charge recombination at the photoelectrode due to the slowed reduction rate at the CE.
Lee et al. employed graphene dots (GDs) as a CE dopant within a PEDOT:PSS CE. Incorporating GDs into the PEDOT:PSS CE led to a rougher surface morphology that enhanced electrocatalytic activity and reduced charge transfer resistance as evidenced by the improved PV performances over undoped devices (Fig. 4C and 5A). The lower charge transfer resistance is also evident in the EIS spectra (Nyquist plot in Fig. 5B insets) in which a device with 30 vol% GDs resulted in substantially lower impedance. Additionally, their devices showed similar efficiencies (Fig. 5C) to those devices with a Pt CE across a wide range of angles of incidence (AOI) and also showed improved efficiencies over a Si SC at large AOI (x < −60° or x > 60°). A head to head comparison of the photovoltaic parameters vs. the dot ratio from the previously discussed studies is provided in Fig. 5A (circles – Chen et al.; squares – Lee et al.). Additional recent reports employed CND–polyaniline composites, GQD–polyaniline composites, and a GQD-doped carbon aerogel, as Pt free CEs within DSSCs (see Tables 1 and S1).

Recently, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs), typically separated into polymer solar cells (PSCs) and small molecule photovoltaics (SMPVs), have received a significant amount of attention due to their attractive properties such as device flexibility, low-cost, and large-scale mass production of large-area devices through roll-to-roll processing, making these devices promising candidates as next-generation PVs. These types of devices are based on the formation of a BHJ film through the layering of an electron-donating material (typically p-type conjugated polymers) and an electron-accepting material (typically n-type fullerene derivatives), with the most commonly employed PSC materials being a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and the fullerene derivative (6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), respectively, which is schematically shown in Fig. 6A. The phase separation of the polymer and the fullerene derivative makes these devices naturally nanostructured, however, due to the poor carrier mobility of the organic semiconductors which leads to undesirable charge recombination, the thickness of these devices is limited resulting in insufficient light harvesting capabilities and low power conversion efficiencies. Steps have been taken to circumvent these issues such as the incorporation of semiconductor quantum dots as electron acceptor materials but due to their toxicity and scarce precursors, other avenues need explored. As promising, greener alternatives, various carbon nanomaterials such as nanotubes, graphenes, and fullerenes have been employed as electron acceptor materials in OPVs due to their high stability and conductivity, however, because of their complex production, propensity to aggregate, and heterogeneous sizes, which give rise to inhomogeneous interfacial contact and, therefore, poorly performing devices, these materials have seen limited implementation.

CNDs, on the other hand, possess similar physical and electronic properties while also sporting narrow size distributions and functional groups that aid in dispersibility, making them a promising, sustainable alternative for implementation within these devices. The Lau group recently demonstrated that functionalizing GQDs with polyaniline (PANI) induced a strong red-shift in the fluorescence (depending on the PANI content) due to the π-conjugated interactions between the GQDs and PANI and the island-like polymer matrices around the GQDs in a composite film led to enhanced interconnectivity and carrier transport, producing improved photocurrents within a PANI-GQD photodetector, which has promising implications in optoelectronics, especially devices relying on polymer-CND interactions such as BHJ-OPVs. Performance improvements have already been reported in which the CNDs have been incorporated into the photoactive layer (typically behaving as electron acceptors) and into the hole extracting layer, as well as being employed as a buffer layer within the device. In addition to these applications, CNDs have also been exploited as a luminescent down-shifting (LDS) layer on the outer side of the photoanode and as a dual reducing agent/template to generate CD/AgNP composites for plasmon enhancement. In the former, Huang et al. reported a mild thermal approach for the synthesis of silane functionalized CNDs, which were then spin cast onto the outer side of the photoanode of a ZnO-P3HT:PCBM-MoO3 layered device. In this instance, the photoluminescent properties of the CNDs were exploited as a LDS layer to absorb wavelengths outside the harvestable regime of BHJ devices (380–480 nm) and re-emit within the working range (480–650 nm). The authors reported a slight increase in the JSC (∼10%) which translated to an approximate 12% increase in the overall device PCE with the IPCE plot providing more convincing evidence of the improvement in which the light harvesting PCE between 350–450 nm is improved substantially after adding the LDS layer.
In the latter report mentioned above, the authors incorporated CD-supported silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting layer of devices with P3HT:PCBM or poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] and [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) active layers. Both types of devices displayed similar VOC and FF values to their respective device without any CD-AgNPs incorporated but showed improvements in the JSC which translated to approximately a 20% and 10% increase, respectively, in the overall device PCE. The increase in the JSC and η arise from an enhancement in the IPCE (also known as the external quantum efficiency (EQE)) across the visible region due to a plasmonic coupling from a clustering effect of the CD-AgNPs, which is further evidenced by a decreased performance when employing free AgNPs. In addition, the authors report internal quantum efficiencies (IQE, which is a ratio of the number of charge carriers collected to the number of incident photons actually absorbed by the active layer) over 90% between 450–700 nm for the PTB7:PC71BM-based device with the IQE cresting 99% at 460 nm, which is one of, if not, the highest reported IQE for these types of devices. A tabulated summary of all of the devices discussed herein can be found in Tables 2 and S2.

GQDs also extended light scattering and light confinement; however higher wt% likely decrease light penetration negatively affecting devices. Inclusion of rGQDs in active layer decreased resistance owing to conductivity of rGQDs. Taking advantage of both improvements leads to synergistic effect, resulting in highest performance

At optimized concentration CNDs uniformly disperse in interfacial layer to give better phase separation and interfacial contact increasing conductivity.

Depends on device architecture and cathode selection: PCDTBT gives higher VOC while PTB7-Th gives higher JSC (and PCE); cathode performance – Al > Ag > Au. All GQD included devices show improvement over controls and conventional buffer layers (CILs) in part from conductivity of GQDs which reduced series resistance. GQDs form interfacial dipole at metal cathode interface lowering the work function creating an ohmic contact and increasing the built-in potential across the active layer which improves charge carrier selection/extraction and suppresses charge recombination. Increasing the alkyl chain length on the functional groups from methyl to ethyl to n-butyl gradually decreases performance possibly due to decreased conductivity from more insulating functionality

The application of CNDs as electron acceptors can be split into two sub-categories; one in which the carbon nanodots are co-mingled into the device's active layer and another in which the CNDs replace the fullerene derivative all together. While a handful of reports already exist on the feasibility of various types of CNDs functioning as electron acceptors (or donors) within BHJ photovoltaic applications, a recent report by Feng et al. provided experimental and theoretical results clearly highlighting the applicability of CQDs (synthesized via a low temperature hydrothermal treatment of L-ascorbic acid and ethylenediamine) as an acceptor material within these devices. Their results show that the P3HT highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies are above the binding energy of an exciton (0.3 eV) which is a requirement for the generation of an electron/hole pair at the donor/acceptor interface and that the band gap energies of the CQDs align well with those of the P3HT as to allow for adequate charge-transfer to take place. Physical evidence of a charge-transfer event taking place was provided through photoluminescence (PL) measurements in which the PL intensity of the P3HT film drastically decreased (i.e., PL quenching) upon the introduction of CQDs, indicating that the CQDs accept electrons from the photoexcited P3HT hindering radiative electron–hole recombination.

Given this, CNDs may function well as electron donors or co-electron acceptors coupled with the PCBM fullerene derivatives. Most reports revolve around the electron accepting nature of CNDs while fewer studies exist that focus on CNDs as suitable electron donors outside the context of injecting electrons into metal oxides. Privitera et al. recently demonstrated that organosoluble, N-doped, thiophene functionalized CQDs served as efficient electron donors to PCBM in both solution and solid blends. Depending upon the thiophene moiety employed, longer lived charge pair states were detected, which led to increased charge recombination, reducing the yield of photoinduced free charge carriers. Conversely, Kim et al. reported on GQDs electron accepting capabilities within devices having an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM:GQDs/Al. Employing three different types of GQDs (acid-oxidized and two subsequently reduced; 5 and 10 h reductions), they showed that highly oxygenated GQDs displayed stronger absorptivity while fully reduced (10 h) GQDs presented increased conductivity, with a 0.5 wt% inclusion of 5 h reduced GQDs within the devices providing the optimum balance between light absorptivity and electrical conductivity, resulting in enhanced performance over devices without GQD inclusion (Fig. 7A–C).
Utilizing a slightly different device architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM:GQDs/Ca/Al), Wang et al. demonstrated that the inclusion of acid-oxidized GQDs within the active layer had several positive effects on the device performance. The strong light scattering properties of the GQDs led to increased optical path lengths (Fig. 6G) and the nanoscale nature of the GQDs led to a favourable morphology and phase separation of the films (Fig. 6C–F) which enhanced current density (Fig. 7A–C) and reduced charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6H).
Even more recently, Moon et al. reported a facile one-step pyrolysis approach to N-doped graphitic carbon dots (N-GCDs) using fumanitrile as both the carbon and nitrogen source. A 2 wt% addition of the N-GCDs into the PTB7:PC71BM layer produced a nearly 20% increase in the PCE which was a direct result of an enhanced JSC and FF, mainly from Förster resonance energy transfer from the fluorescent GCDs to the active photolayer but was also attributed to improved electron transport.
Due to their alluring, graphene-like properties and behavior, GQDs have recently shown promise as a full replacement to the fullerene derivative (i.e., PCBM) typically employed within these types of devices. Huang et al. demonstrated that microwave-assisted pyrolysis synthesized, organo-soluble GQDs could be deposited as a thin film beneath the P3HT layer to function as the electron acceptor material due to the intrinsic sp2 hybridized structure that is typical to this class of CNDs. Their conceptual device showed that GQDs can indeed function as an electron acceptor replacement for the fullerene derivatives, albeit with slightly lower photovoltaic performance (∼3-fold lower photocurrent), which is of great significance since these materials are cheaper and easier to fabricate than the fullerene derivatives. Of note is that this proof-of-concept device was not optimized and the photocurrent is on the same order as the control devices, indicating that with the proper adjustments, the performance could be further enhanced resulting in devices that out-perform their controls.
In a similar work, to Gupta et al. incorporated aniline (ANI) functionalized graphene sheets (GSs) and GQDs (synthesized through a previously reported hydrothermal treatment of naked GSs) at different graphene loading ratios (wt%) into the P3HT active layer of a P3HT/PEDOT:PSS type of device. Saturation of the PL quenching (when referenced to neat P3HT) occurred for ANI-GQD doping levels greater than 1 wt% indicating that at a doping level of 1 wt% charge transfer is optimal (Fig. 8A). The nonfuntionalized GQDs at the same doping level only displayed marginal quenching. The optimal charge transfer occurring at 1% ANI-GQD doping is reflected in the PV device performances. Devices having the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ANI-GQDS were fabricated with 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt% graphene/P3HT where 0.5% and 1% ANI-GQDs resulted in the highest values for the JSC and FF giving efficiencies of 0.77 and 1.14%, respectively (Fig. 8B; open circles).
Akin to the work conducted by Gupta et al., Qu and co-workers demonstrated that doping electrochemically synthesized GQDs (3–5 nm in size) into the P3HT layer as electron acceptors (at 10 wt%) resulted in a substantial increase in the current density (∼12-fold), which in turn led to nearly a 24-fold increase in PCE from 0.008% for the P3HT only device up to 0.19% for the GQD incorporated cell (Fig. 8B; open squares). This marked enhancement was attributed to the formation of numerous exciton separation (p–n) interfaces and charge carrier transport pathways due to the large surface area and high carrier mobility of the GQDs, respectively. Furthermore, the current and PCE were additionally enhanced by ∼6-fold through an annealing step (Fig. 8B; solid squares) which is likely attributed to an improved sintering of the GQD/P3HT interfaces, resulting in more efficient charge carrier separation and transport. Additionally, the incorporation of GQDs also increased the VOC and FF. Other works using CNDs as (co)electron acceptors or active layer dopants have also been reported, the results of which are summarized in Tables 2 and S2.

To facilitate more efficient charge separation and prevent interfacial recombination within these devices, hole extraction layers (HELs) are commonly employed to arrive at high-performing devices. The most widely used HEL is PEDOT:PSS, however its strong acidity and hygroscopicity results in an undesirable device instability. Employing inorganic semiconducting HELs can enhance stability but this concurrently increases manufacturing costs. Due to the aforementioned properties, carbon nanomaterials may offer a solution to both these issues but materials such as GO introduce their own set of problems (e.g., poor conductivity and non-uniform sizes). However, since CNDs can sport narrow size-distributions, high carrier mobilities, and tunable band gaps, they present themselves as a viable alternative. Toward this, Lim et al. incorporated 8–10 nm GQDs (prepared from the oxidation of carbon nanofibers) into the PEDOT:PSS film as a HEL additive since the neat PEDOT:PSS films display poor electrical properties that arise from the insulating nature of the PSS counterion chains. The addition of isopropyl alcohol during the organogel preparation disrupted the electrostatic interactions between the PEDOT:PSS ions which resulted in layers of the PEDOT cation surrounding the negatively charged GQDs to give GQD@PEDOT nanostructures (Fig. 9A). Upon gelation, the core–shell nanostructures aggregated in such a manner (due to the synergistic interactions between the GQDs and the PEDOT which caused the PEDOT chains to reorient) to give rise to improved film morphologies (Fig. 9B–G); the GQD organogels (ogGx) had relatively homogeneous and interconnected PEDOT-rich domains, which led to better charge hopping pathways and, therefore, enhanced film conductivity. These improved electrical properties are directly reflected in the photovoltaic performance of these devices (Fig. 9H; open circles). A 20 vol% addition of GQDs produced a 26% increase in the PCE (compared to a neat PEDOT:PSS layer) which was attributed to an elevated JSC that originated in the enhanced conductivity and lowered series resistance from the aggregation-induced improvement of the charge hopping properties. However, when the GQD quantity was increased to 50 vol% a negative effect on the photovoltaic performance (JSC and PCE) compared to the 20 vol% device was observed, which was ascribed to the genesis of adverse charge transport characteristics at such a high GQD loading. While both GQD incorporated devices showed improvements in JSC and PCE, both were also plagued by lower FFs arising from lowered shunt resistances that result in current leakages between the electrodes.

A handful of groups have taken this one step further in which the PEDOT:PSS HEL was fully replaced by GQDs. Wan, Chen, and co-workers substituted acid oxidized, carbon nanofiber synthesized 20–30 nm GQDs for the HEL in both polymer solar cells (P3HT:PC61BM) and small-molecule solar cells (DR3TBDT:PC71M). Photovoltaic parameter comparisons are provided in Fig. 9H, where the PSCs and the SMSCs are represented by the open and filled squares, respectively. This excellent contribution of an in-depth HEL thickness optimization showed that, in both cases, the GQD substituted devices displayed comparable performances to the PEDOT:PSS-based devices and could out-perform GO HELs (of similar thicknesses), showing excellent reproducibility and improved stability over both control devices. Their results indicate that too thin of a layer of GQDs (or GO) results in poor performance due to a lack of sufficient ohmic contact between the interfaces, however, too thick of a layer also hinders the performance from increased series resistance. The optimized GQD devices displayed similar photovoltaic parameters (i.e., VOC, JSC, FF, PCE, Rs, Rsh) to the PEDOT:PSS HELs and improved parameters over the GO-based HELs, which were attributed to the nanoscale dimensions and, therefore, the more homogeneous morphology (over GO), good conductivity, and smoother, more uniform films that the GQDs provide. While the devices with GQD HELs did not show any overall PCE improvements compared to the currently employed PEDOT:PSS HEL, these results highlight the wide applicability of GQDs as HELs and show great promise for further device tuning and optimization that will surely surpass the current state-of-the-art. One such example is that introduced by Dai and co-workers, in which they also employed GQDs as a substitute for PEDOT:PSS in devices with PTB7:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM active layers. Their devices, using acid oxidized, carbon black-derived few-layered (2 nm thick i.e., 2–3 layers) 4 nm diameter GQDs as the HEL did slightly out-perform PEDOT:PSS (η = 7.91% vs. 7.46%) and showed a drastic improvement over GO (η = 6.33%). The improved PCE originated from the higher JSC and VOC which were direct results of the better transmittance of the GQD film affording increased light absorption by the active layer and the higher work function of the few-layered GQDs from predominately carboxylated functionality, respectively. In combination with the higher work function, the small dimensions of the GQDs resulted in good film-forming properties that produced an efficient ohmic contact between the interfaces evidenced by the comparable Rs and Rsh (not mentioned), giving similar FFs to the PEDOT:PSS devices. These results are among the highest reported for graphene materials-based OPV/PSCs and highlight the promising, practical application of CNDs within these devices. Additional reports using CNDs and GQDs as a hole extraction layer have also been reported and the results are summarized in Tables 2 and S2.

A different BHJ architecture that has been receiving a lot of attention as of late due to the superior device stability and manufacturing capability are inverted polymer solar cells. These devices differ from the conventional architecture in that the bias across the device is reversed such that the charges are extracted in the opposite direction (Fig. 6B). Due to the nature of the device, buffer layers, sometimes referred to as electron transport layers (ETL), between the cathode (e.g., ITO-coated glass) and the polymer film are required to reduce the cathode work function and enhance the sustained separation and subsequent extraction of charge carriers. The most commonly employed buffer layers are metal oxides such as ZnO or TiO2, but due to the good electron injection and ease of fabrication, Cs2CO3 has moved into the limelight. However, it has poor hole blocking ability leading to increased charge recombination and inadequate device stability from Cs+ ion diffusion into the polymer layer, which causes irreparable damage. These issues can be circumvented by incorporating additives such as GQDs. Yang et al. reported the conceptual use of hydrothermally synthesized GQDs (0.5–3.5 nm) as an excellent cathode buffer additive that could simultaneously enhance exciton dissociation and suppress parasitic recombination. The addition of GQDs to the Cs2CO3 buffer layer led to good hole blocking and electron transfer capabilities (due to appropriately aligned band energies) and decreased series and increased shunt resistances which were reflected through an increase in all the photovoltaic parameters. In a more extensive follow-up study, Yang et al. optimized the ratio of GQDs within the buffer layer and studied the effects of buffer layer annealing using this optimized (50%) ratio (Fig. 10A). In devices using a neat Cs2CO3 buffer layer (Fig. 10B; solid lines), an elevated annealing temperature was required to achieve improved performance with 120 °C resulting in the highest JSC and PCE. However, when employing the GQD-doped buffer layer, similarly to their previous report, the device parameters were all enhanced, but additionally, the performance was nominally the same regardless of the annealing temperature, whether it was 150 °C or no annealing at all (Fig. 10B; dashed lines), which can be attributed to the better hole blocking ability. Concurrently, the addition of GQDs produced a higher stability film (Fig. 10C and D) due to the negatively charged carboxyl groups electrostatically screening the leeched Cs+, preventing it from parasitically contaminating the polymer layer.

Similar work was conducted by Qin et al. in which GQDs were incorporated into a conventional TiO2 buffer layer. The introduction of 3–6 nm GQDs, due to the favourable band energy alignments, provided better channels for charge carrier mobility and suppressed undesirable recombination, which led to an enhanced VOC and JSC and, therefore, a notable increase in PCE (from 2.04 to 3.16%). Other works using CNDs as a buffer layer (dopant) have also been reported, the results of which are summarized in Tables 2 and S2.

While, historically, solid-state solar cells have offered unprecedented photovoltaic performance due to the materials employed and device fabrication, they are still plagued with high cost-to-power output ratios and the use of toxic, environmentally hazardous elements, which gave rise to the device architectures previously discussed (e.g., chromophore-sensitized and BHJ style devices). Despite the higher costs however, solid-state devices offer unrivalled reliability and sustainability with respect to device stability and longevity, resulting in a surge of exploration for adequate cheap and non-toxic replacements, such as CNDs, for the current state-of-the-art. Due to the aforementioned, tuneable properties that CNDs possess, they have seen applications in solid-state devices as light absorbers (e.g., sensitizers), charge transfer media, and energy down-shifting layers. A tabulated summary of all of the devices discussed herein can be found in Tables 3 and S3.

Depends on GQD size (determined by length of sonication during oxidation of GSs) and layer thickness (8, 20, 50 nm; determined by volume of GQDs deposited). Due to appropriate band alignment, (1) photogenerated charge carriers diffuse to interface and are separated by built-in electric field of the heterojunction and (2) electrons prevented from transferring from Si to graphene, minimizing recombination (evidenced by increased minority carrier lifetimes). Hole transport possibly occurs via tunneling or the existence of intermediate energy levels in GQDs. Change in GQD size affects band alignment while films thinner or thicker than 20 nm result in a nonuniform GQD layer or light-blocking effects and poor conductivity, respectively. Devices showed good stability for over 6 months (in air). Doping of graphene film using HNO3 vapor improved performance of all devices

GQD wt% higher than 0.5 decreases minority carrier lifetime and increases recombination likely due to GQD aggregation that forms trap sites. Higher amounts can also inhibit Si light absorption. Back surface field treatment by heavily doping the Si via a thermal diffusion of POCl3 enhanced all device parameters for all GQD wt% (0–1%)

All GQD concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0 wt%) improve performance over bare device although 0.7 wt% and higher begin to show decreased JSC, FF, and PCE. Authors attribute this to poorer conductivity typically associated with thicker GQD layers; however, based on the understood device architecture this should not play a role here and would more likely result from decreased transmittance due to a thicker GQD film

In a similar fashion to the sensitized mesoscopic metal oxide devices, CNDs have also shown promise as sensitizers within solid-state devices. Dutta et al. applied hydrazine-reduced, GO-derived GQDs (4–15 nm diameter, 1–3 layers thick) as the sensitizer in a ZnO nanowire-based device that employed N-N′-diphenyl-N-N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (TPD) as the hole-transporting layer. Photoluminescent quenching measurements confirmed adequate interfacial charge separation between the numerous newly established GQD-ZnO pathways. Subsequent JV characterization confirmed enhanced photovoltaic performance from the GQD-sensitized ZnO device in comparison to a ZnO control, however, due to the nature of the device architecture, the PCE was still quite low (0.2%). Since the gaps between the ZnO nanowires were fully infiltrated by GQDs resulting in a thin GQD layer above the nanowire array, the TPD HEL only forms interfacial contact with the top layer of GQDs, which led to inefficient hole collection and, therefore, a poorer performance. A more ideal device architecture would consist of a thin film of GQDs sensitized across each individual wire with a conformal coating of a HEL across the entire GQD-nanowire array, filling the gaps with the HEL layer as opposed to the GQDs. However, the HEL employed here, as well as other similar organic-based hole conductors, prove ineffective in full penetration of the nanowire arrays.

This issue can be circumvented by utilizing HELs such as copper thiocyanide (CuSCN), as presented by Briscoe et al. Their device architecture is schematically shown in Fig. 11A. Within their work, they solvothermally synthesized three different biomass-derived (glucose (G), chitin (CT), and chitosan (CS)) CQDs and demonstrated that the photovoltaic performance was highly dependent upon the CQD surface functionality. Due to the varying functional groups within the precursors, the resultant CQDs also varied in size (2–16 nm), light absorption, and surface features, however, the dots retained predominate functionalities akin to that of their precursor (glucose: alcohols/carboxyls; chitin: amides; chitosan: amines). Despite the differences though, all three types of CQD produced enhanced photovoltaic performances within a ZnO nanorod-based device when compared to an uncoated device (Fig. 11B), although a strong correlation was not apparent between the CQD light absorption characteristics and the resulting photocurrent which indicated that the performance was dictated more by the structural nature of the CQD layer instead of their individual light-harvesting abilities. More specifically, the thicker layer that arises with the G-CQDs enabled higher light absorption but due to internal recombination, limited photocarrier collection (η = 0.017%). Conversely, the lower coating density of CT-CQDs was not sufficient enough to reduce interfacial recombination leading to a low shunt resistance (η = 0.032%). The CS-CQDs produced the highest performing device of the three types of CQDs with a PCE of 0.061%. The results indicated that the CQD functionality determines the extent of surface interactions between the CQD and ZnO nanorod array and the nature of charge transport within the sensitizer layer both of which influence the device performance. Combining the CS-CQDs with both the G-CQDs and then those derived from chitin though a layer-by-layer deposition (4 alternating layers of each), further elucidated the high levels of recombination that the G-CQDs produce (η = 0.006%) but uncovered a synergistic effect between the functional groups of the amine-containing CQDs that resulted in a further enhancement in PCE (0.077%), as observed in Fig. 11B.

Due to the unique electronic properties that CNDs display, especially those classified as CQDs and GQDs, these materials have also been applied as efficient charge carrier separation and/or blocking layers within various solid-state device architectures such as semiconductor QD, crystalline Si, and silicon nanowire-based cells. Deepa and co-workers employed hydrothermally synthesized, glucose-derived CNDs (∼16 nm) as a charge transfer/propagation layer within a (quasi) solid-state device based on ZnS monolayer encapsulated CdS QDs as donors and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules dissolved in a sulfide ion gel electrolyte as the acceptors. The confinement of the CdS QDs within the ZnS layers ensured that there was not any charge injection from the conduction band of the CdS QDs into the CNDs, which was confirmed through photoluminescent quenching measurements. The inclusion of CNDs within the devices produced increased photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, and η), IPCE values across 350–650 nm, and charge recombination times (from EIS), which were all indicative of the CNDs improving current collection and suppressing parasitic recombination. The enhanced device performance was attributed to the highly conductive nature of the CNDs, the nanoscale proximity of the CNDs and the CuPC acceptor, and the favorable energy levels alignments of these two species.

Employing the market-dominant solid-state Si solar cell, Gao et al. deposited a GQD (alkali-assisted, hydrothermally synthesized from pre-oxidized graphene sheets) layer in between the Si and the Au electrode to serve as an efficient charge separation layer that aided in the suppression of anodic carrier recombination (Fig. 12A). Since non-passivated Si has a large number of dangling surface bonds that lead to larger carrier recombination, the Si surface functionality was first optimized by testing H-, SiOx-, and CH3-terminations. The methylated Si resulted in the highest photovoltaic performance (Fig. 12C) owing to decreased interfacial recombination, therefore, all remaining studies employed the CH3-surface functionality. Control studies utilizing only the Au electrode or GO substituted for GQDs showed that GQD incorporated devices boasted drastically higher photovoltaic parameters and PCE. Additionally, the thickness of the GQD film and the size of the individual GQDs were optimized, the results of which demonstrated that an 80 nm layer of 2–6 nm GQDs produced the highest photovoltaic performance (Fig. 12D) with enhanced stability for over a half year. Lastly, the reduction of the dark current within a GQD incorporated device highlighted the diminished electron leakage, which led to suppressed anodic charge recombination. The improved characteristics of these devices were attributed to the strong built-in electric field at the Si/GQD heterojunction, which led to efficient charge carrier separation and the appropriate GQD LUMO/Si CB alignment which ensured low interfacial recombination, both of which highlight the ability of GQDs to function as an effective hole transport and electron blocking layer.
Xie et al. arrived at similar conclusions when employing electrochemically synthesized CQDs within a device based on a hierarchical Si nanowire array (Fig. 12B and C). The photovoltaic parameters were all influenced by the Si functionality (CH3-termination produced best performance), the extent of CQD coating (Fig. 12E; open squares), and the size of the individual CQDs (Fig. 12E; filled squares). Devices with too thin of a layer of CQDs (<5 layers) resulted in pinhole formations within the CQD coating allowing the Au electrode to make direct contact with the nanowire array, which formed metal/Si Schottky junctions that reduced the performance, while devices with too thick of a CQD layer (>5 layers) blocked the incident light from reaching the nanowires and, due to the inferior conductivity of thick CQD films, increased the series resistance. When the size of the CQDs was doubled (4–8 nm), the devices showed inferior performance which was attributed to a reduced barrier height of the heterojunction (e.g., inappropriate band alignment leading to decreased VOC) and a misfortunate change in the charge propagation (lowered JSC). Intuitively, the GQD-SiNW devices out performed all planar Si devices with or without G/CQDs. However, akin to the work by Gao et al. the results all demonstrated that CND films functioned as an efficient charge separation layer, not only facilitating hole transportation but also reducing electron recombination at the Au electrode. Additional reports using GQDs as a hole transport/electron blocking layer have also been reported, the results of which are summarized in Tables 3 and S3.

An intriguing application within band-gap based solid-state devices is the recent implementation of energy down-shifting layers (EDSL) to down convert higher energy photons (i.e., UV) to energies more closely associated with the bandgap (i.e., visible region) since these photons have a higher probability of absorption and it aids in the negation of ineffective energy losses via electron thermalization. Due to CNDs highly (reported) fluorescent nature, excitation wavelength-dependent emission, size-tunable bandgaps, and ease of synthesis, they make ideal candidates for EDSLs. Lee et al. reported the synthesis of GQDs through the acidic, ultrasonic treatment of GO and employed their GQDs as EDSLs that were deposited onto silicon solar cells using an in-house kinetic spraying application. Their results indicated that the performance enhancement was dependent upon the scan speed; that is to say, the thickness of the GQD layer. A slow deposition rate (10 mm s−1), which resulted in a thicker GQD layer, actually hindered the device performance, slightly lowering the JSC and, therefore, the PCE, indicating too thick of a layer absorbed too many of the incident visible photons. All of the other rastering speeds (20, 30, and 40 mm s−1) resulted in a slight enhancement of the photocurrent and PCE with a nozzle scan speed of 30 mm s−1 resulting in the most improved parameters. These enhancements can be attributed to the strong UV absorption and subsequent visible fluorescence that the GQDs provide which results in additional photons closer to the bandgap of Si that can be more efficiently harvested into photocurrent. A similar work conducted by Shen and co-workers drew analogous conclusions, however, they employed hydrothermally synthesized CNDs that were spin-cast as a CND-entrapped PVA film onto a Si nanowire array that had been etched into one side of a p-type Si wafer. Even further, a recent report by Pelayo et al. applied electrochemically synthesized CQDs in the same fashion on commercially available Si solar cells. Depending upon the current employed to synthesize the CQDs, the down-shifting effect led to 2–5% enhancements in the PCE over devices without an EDSL. These results highlight the promising applicability of CNDs as more environmentally friendly EDSLs, especially since they show comparable enhancements to sQD EDSLs. An additional report employing GQDs as an EDSL within an n-type Si heterojunction solar cell was also recently reported, the results of which are summarized in Tables 3 and S3.


Plants' ability to convert visible electromagnetic energy (specifically red wavelengths of 680–700 nm) into electrochemical energy through photosynthesis has inspired many researchers to generate bio-inspired energy conversion systems that mimic the charge transfer processes that occur between the plants' various photosystems. For a more detailed discussion of the photosynthetic processes and recent advances in bio-inspired photochemical conversion, the reader is directed elsewhere but, briefly, chromophores, such as chlorophyll, within the plant leaves absorb incident photo-energy that is transferred to photosystems I and II for the production of chemical energy (via electron transfer processes) in the form of ADP/ATP and NADP/NADPH. Toward bio-inspired devices, two different avenues can be employed: (1) introduce appropriate materials into a bio-based system to enhance photosynthesis or (2) assemble a non-biologically based hierarchical system that mimics the photosynthetic process. We note that DSSCs fall into this latter category and were one of the very first examples of a photosynthesis-mimicking PV system, however, due to the enormity of that field, DSSCs received their own section.

Since CNDs are already well-known to be non-toxic, the key requirement for avenue (1) to be feasible is that CNDs must possess the ability to be interfaced with biomolecules. Our group recently demonstrated that cytochrome c can electrostatically dock onto CNDs, causing the protein to unfold to various extents (depending on the CND surface functionality), exposing the heme group and, therefore, modulating the peroxidase-like activity. Even more recently, Hutton et al. showed that CDs functioned efficiently as photosensitizers within two photobiocatalysis systems: 1) photoconversion of fumarate to succinate using fumarate reductase and 2) solar hydrogen generation using a [NiFeSe]-H2ase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum. Additional reports have been published highlighting CNDs ability to modulate enzyme based catalysts, therefore, due to these promising interactions with biomolecules and due to CNDs' donor/acceptor properties, they may function well within bio-based devices. Toward this, Chandra et al. demonstrated that amine-terminated CQDs functioned as effective electron donors, transferring electrons to chloroplasts (extracted from mung bean leaves) thereby promoting the photosynthetic efficiency. The CQD emission (excited at 390 nm) overlapped well with the absorbance profile of the chloroplasts indicating that charge transfer from the CQDs to the chloroplasts was feasible. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements of the CQDs in the presence of chloroplasts showed decreased fluorescence intensities and shortened lifetimes indicating that CQD electron donation did occur. Similar work was conducted by Rasmussen et al. in which electrochemically synthesized CQDs were co-mingled with spinach leave-derived thylakoid membranes, which contain all the necessary components for photosynthesis. The devices showed enhanced photocurrent in comparison to a thylakoid only device, which was attributed to the nanoscale dimensions of the CQDs, resulting in increased surface area and, therefore, more interfacial contacts between the thylakoid membranes and the CQDs, and also due to a minute contribution from the fluorescent nature of the CQDs, converting higher energy photons into photons more suited for absorption by the thylakoid membranes.
Inspired by these photosynthetic processes, Ma et al. incorporated electrochemically synthesized CQDs of two different size regimes (<10 nm, >10 nm) into a dye-sensitized (Rhodamine B, RhB) TiO2 nanotube device as an electron transfer intermediary in an effort to mimic the charge transfer events that occur in photosynthesis (Fig. 13A). An electron transfer event from RhB to CQDs was confirmed using time-correlated single photon counting (Fig. 13B), which showed that in the presence of CQDs less than 10 nm, the photoluminescence lifetime was drastically shortened from 1.53 ns (RhB) to 0.52 ns. Upon introduction of the CQDs into a solution of RhB, a drastic hyperchromic effect arose, which was attributed to the electron-donating/-accepting properties of the CQDs (Fig. 13B inset). This enhanced absorption translated to a remarkable increase in the generated photocurrent (9.5 times for CQDs >10 nm, 21.1 times for CQDs <10 nm) in comparison to a control device with only RhB, which resulted in a seven-fold increase in the PCE (Fig. 13C). These results indicated that the CQDs functioned as an excellent electron transfer intermediary through effective charge separation and recombination suppression, which was further corroborated with photoluminescence quenching and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements. Any parameters for the devices discussed herein are summarized in Tables 4 and S4.

The fairly new perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3) sensitizers have attracted a substantial amount of attention within mesoscopic and BHJ devices owing to devices with power efficiencies >15%. However, the charge carrier injection times within these devices are substantially longer than the hot carrier cooling time, meaning that a vast amount of the converted photo-energy is lost to thermalization. To circumvent this, electron/hole extraction layers, such as CNDs, can be incorporated into the device facilitating more efficient charge transport. Zhu et al. deposited an ultrathin layer of electrochemically synthesized, 5–10 nm GQDs in between the perovskite sensitizer and the TiO2 nanoparticle network as a charge transfer bridge to help facilitate more efficient electron injection from the perovskite to the TiO2 film (Fig. 14A). Incorporation of the GQDs resulted in significant enhancements of the JSC and, therefore, the PCE, while the VOC and FF remained virtually unchanged. An optimization of the GQD loading concentration revealed that 0.5 mg mL−1 resulted in the best photocurrent and PCE enhancements (Fig. 14C). The increase in photocurrent was corroborated with IPCE measurements in which the efficiency was enhanced across much of the visible region (500–750 nm). The improvement resulting from GQD incorporation could arise from two possible reasons: 1) the GQDs could be acting as a charge carrier extractor, behaving as an electron acceptor or 2) they are functioning as a bridge, enhancing the charge injection between the perovskite and TiO2 but not actually capturing any electrons. The authors concluded that it was likely the latter reason due to GQDs lower electron affinity. This reasoning was further reinforced by PL quenching measurements that showed dramatic quenching of the perovskite PL upon contact with the GQDs and higher internal quantum efficiencies, both of which are indicative of an efficient charge transfer event. Even more noteworthy is that femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 14B) confirmed that in the presence of GQDs the electron extraction time decreased from 260–307 ps to 90–106 ps, highlighting the GQDs ability to function as a superfast electron funnel (due to the widely distributed π orbitals) and thereby increasing the electronic coupling between the perovskite and TiO2.

Conversely, Paulo et al. demonstrated that CQDs could function as a decent HEL within a perovskite-sensitized device. The incorporation of CQDs resulted in a marginal increase in the JSC but drastically improved the VOC and FF which translated to an increase in the PCE from 0.71% to 3% in comparison to a device without a HEL. Unfortunately, the device with CQDs as the HEL did not perform nearly as well as a reference device employing the common spiro-OMeTAD HEL. The authors attributed this to a non-homogenous CQD layer since the dots have a propensity to aggregate upon drying generating nano-island domains and/or due to the choice of ligand (p-phenylenediamine) employed in the synthesis which could lead to decreased charge mobility. However, their results do indicate that CQDs are a promising HEL within these types of devices and upon a detailed study of the ligand choice vs. PV performance followed by a proper CQD loading optimization, these nanoscale carbons may perform equally as well or better than the current state-of-the-art HELs. The parameters for the devices discussed herein are summarized in Tables 5 and S5.

Currently, devices in which CNDs function as a co-role (co-sensitizer, co-electron acceptor, or dopant) show promising synergistic enhancements in performance over CND-free PVs whether it be within a mesoscopic, solid-state, or BHJ type device. The incorporation of CNDs into these devices leads to enhanced optical absorption and/or charge carrier generation, separation, and transport/mobility due to the (bathochromically-shifted) UV-vis absorption and donor/acceptor properties of the CNDs, which ultimately leads to relevant improvements in PV parameters. However, while CNDs have shown promise functioning as a primary role (sensitizer, electron donor/acceptor, buffer layer), these devices are still plagued with much lower performances over the state-of-the-art. More specifically, when employed as a sensitizer, the limiting factor is clearly the photocurrent, which could arise from inferior chemisorption of the CNDs to the metal oxide surface, limited light harvesting capabilities within the visible region, and/or inefficient electron injection due to a lack of chemisorption or parasitic recombination within trap states. Many reports exist though that indicate efficient electron transfer from the CND to the TiO2, therefore, the poorer photocurrents likely arise from insufficient photoanode sensitization and weak visible to near-IR absorption by the CNDs. Additionally, when employed as electron donors/acceptors or charge carrier conduits, devices are also typically hindered by lower photocurrents, which would arise from inferior charge transport and collection, likely due to recombinative losses, begging the question, are CNDs as truly conductive as the field has been lead to believe? This will be further elaborated on within the following section. Tabulated comparisons of all devices, in which the devices are separated into different tables by the parent device architecture and further organized by the CND role within the device, are provided in Tables 1–5 and S1–S5.


While still in their infancy, CNDs have shown much promise as individual or co-dependent components within various PV architectures, with roles ranging from sensitizers in mesoscopic metal oxide or solid-state based devices to charge carrier layers/films (i.e., electron donors/acceptors) in BHJ, bio-inspired, or perovskite based PVs. As briefly discussed in the last section, the limiting factor within many of these devices is the photocurrent which might be due to inferior broadband absorption and/or charge conductivity. It is well-established that the inclusion of heteroatoms, whether they are doped within the CND core or functionalized around the periphery, can lead to bathochromically shifted optical properties (both absorbance and fluorescence) which in theory would be beneficial for enhancing the light harvesting capabilities of these devices. However, the red-edge of the absorbance bands/spectra rarely surpass wavelengths >500 nm and even then the absorbance past >550 nm is generally tailing off to zero. While reports exist on CNDs with measureable absorbance reaching out to near-IR wavelengths, this tailing absorbance arises from surface defect/trap states, which are unstable and dissipative in energy, and, therefore, do not contribute to any photocurrent due to inefficient electron injection. Additionally, many of the functional moieties employed to introduce surface heteroatoms consist of insulating long chain molecules that act as tunnelling barriers hindering efficient electron injection. Indeed, Kwon et al. reported on the ligand length-dependent carrier mobility within CQD-based field-effect transistors, in which both the electron and hole mobilities exponentially decreased with increasing ligand length (hexylamine to hexadecylamine). Therefore, in order for CNDs to function as efficient sensitizers, materials need to be generated in which the heteroatom doping imparts a strong bathochromic shift but does not result in an insulating barrier surrounding the CND. Even further, as pointed out by Margraf et al., it is imperative that the bathochromically shifted excitonic absorptions do not originate from trap-related transitions.

One of the major factors that is hindering the progression of developing CNDs with stronger red-edge effects and the CND field as a whole, is the large degree of inconsistency within the literature, not only regarding the materials' classification as addressed by Cayuela et al. but also the synthetic approach, purification, and subsequent characterization of CND properties. Undoubtedly, the most critical of these is the purification step since the proper characterization of CND properties is completely dependent upon the purification process involved. One might argue that, in theory, the synthetic approach employed is less consequential so long as CNDs possessing particular features are indeed achieved (isolated) following purification. However, a vast majority of practitioners in the field deem it acceptable to “purify” (to use the term loosely) using inadequate means, including dialysis with an inappropriately-small molecular weight cutoff (e.g., 1000 Da), simple filtration, and/or centrifugation. Some researchers have even completely forgone purification, some going so far as to boast a “purification-free” approach to CNDs. While it is feasible that by employing certain top-down approaches GQDs may be the primary product (although this has yet to be definitively demonstrated), this does not translate to bottom-up approaches using small, molecular precursors for CQD or CND generation. One must be chemically naïve to believe that simple thermal degradation by microwave, hydrothermal, or pyrolytic treatment of arbitrary molecular precursors will spontaneously generate pristine CQDs/CNDs devoid of substantial molecular, oligomeric, or polymeric reaction by-products. Indeed, Shi et al. recently demonstrated, using a model pyrolysis reaction between citric acid and L-cysteine, that the strong fluorescence (and high quantum yield in the blue regime) typically associated with CNDs does not actually originate from the CNDs but instead finds its genesis in discrete, identifiable molecular by-products. Even further, Wang et al. showed that a mild thermal treatment of the same precursors (as well as others) resulted in a highly (blue) fluorescent soft gel-like material, providing further evidence that molecular/polymeric materials are generated in route to CQDs/CNDs.
Given these recent reports, it is not surprising that the true origin of the fluorescence remains elusive nor why it remains so widely debated in the literature. The conflicting reports that state that CND fluorescence originates from (quantum) size effects versus different surface emissive traps may be incorrectly attributing optical phenomena to molecular reaction by-products. In all likelihood, folks are unwittingly characterizing a complex ensemble of nanocarbons plus molecular debris. The ratio of nanoscale emitters to fluorescent by-product molecules will undoubtedly dictate the observed photophysics, further underscoring the importance of performing suitable purification. Major discrepancies regarding the conductive nature of CNDs also surely originates in the diverse degrees of purification for the materials involved. Although CNDs may indeed behave as electron donors/acceptors and charge conduits, the presence of insulating molecular by-products will assuredly lead to improper characterization and misinterpretation of the nanoscale behavior. Due to these inconsistencies, a significant number of past results remain highly questionable since it is unclear from these reports whether the demonstrated improvements in device performance derive from the CNDs themselves or arise from the presence of unidentified by-products. Indeed, in future work, it will be very important to discern how carefully-fractionated CND samples influence device performance.
A final factor plaguing the field, that is not only relevant to CND-incorporated PVs but also the entire PV field, is the lack of adequate device characterization. That is to say that one cannot simply make and characterize a single device of each architecture and confidently say that the incorporation of the new material resulted in a marked improvement. Many of these device architectures (especially mesoscopic and BHJ devices) have a large person-to-person, lab-to-lab, and device-to-device variability in comparison to some of the improvements reported. Consequently, without multiple trials (e.g., device statistics), one cannot confidently conclude that the miniscule improvements in performance originate from the CND additive. This begs the question: will device performance still show statistically-meaningful improvement after variations in reproducibility are fully taken into account? Indeed, if many of the researchers who did not report device statistics repeated their studies, due to the intrinsic variability in performance, they might find that the supposed improvements do not fall significantly outside of statistical deviations within the control devices, if they do at all.
Therefore, in order for the field to progress, all purification approaches need to be reassessed and the synthesized materials need to be carefully fractionated to separate out reaction by-products, followed by a rigorous characterization of every component. To truly understand the nature of these materials, the field really needs a unified purification protocol (such as chromatographic separations) that allows us to confidently arrive at fully-defined benchmark CNDs utterly free of all undesirable molecular by-products. Once the purification conundrum is resolved and the true nature of CND properties is revealed, the field will be able to fully exploit these properties within PV devices (as well as other areas) and, after careful statistical comparisons, begin to drive the performances of CND-incorporated PVs to higher and higher PCEs. Despite the many issues plaguing the field (e.g., purification, standardization, nomenclature, meager characterization), CNDs represent exciting new players within PV devices and hold significant (and perhaps yet-undiscovered) potential as cheap and sustainable alternatives in the pursuit of low-cost, high-performance solar energy harvesting systems.
