Herein, two new Ni(dppf)dithiolates in which dithiolate ligands comprise 2,2-diacetyl (D-1) and 2-nitro (D-2) anchors have been synthesized and characterized using microanalyses, FTIR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that in both compounds, the geometry around the Ni(II) center can be described as distorted square planar, which is defined by the two sulfur centers of the dinegative dithiolate ligands and two phosphorus centers of the neutral dppf ligand. The electronic absorption spectra for both sensitizers display a blue shift when compared with the characteristic electronic absorption spectrum of the dppf ligand in a similar wavelength region. The photovoltaic performances and charge transport properties (EIS spectra) were studied to evaluate the performance of the synthesized dye in DSSCs. Upon comparing both dyes, it was found that the dye with the nitro anchor (D-2) showed better photovoltaic performance than the dye with the ketonic anchor (D-1). The superior performance of D-2 suggests better anchorage and superior dye loading capability on the TiO2 surface, which suppresses charge recombination, prolongs electron lifetime, and decreases the total resistance of DSSCs. The assembly fabricated using D-2 showed best performance with an overall conversion efficiency, η, of 3.21%, Jsc of 7.96 mA cm−2, and Voc of −0.654 V. The obtained efficiency is ∼46% that of today's state-of-the-art N719 dye under similar conditions. The probable reasons for the poor performance of both dyes have been addressed with the help of theoretical calculations.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), an inventive research reported by Grätzel, emerged as a thin-film photovoltaic technology offering promising low-cost solar devices with decent power conversion efficiency (PCE). A typical DSSC device comprises a photoactive semiconductor anode (usually TiO2), a photosensitizer (a dye), an electrolyte (I−/I3−), and a passive cathode (a platinum electrode). Among all these components, the dye, which acts as a photosensitizer, plays a crucial role in light harvesting and thereby initiating electrochemical processes for electricity generation. Since the inception of DSSCs, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has steadily increased from 7% in 1991 to 14.3% in 2015 under the standard air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) conditions. During this period, DSSC devices comprising zinc-porphyrin sensitizers achieved an efficiency of ca. 12% using the Co2+/Co3+ redox mediator under standard conditions. Moreover, under artificial indoor lights, they displayed outstanding PCE over 20%.

To achieve optimal cell performance, many research groups focussed on broadening the electronic absorption spectra of dyes by incorporating a variety of chromophores. Hence, many coordination complexes with a range of anchoring groups have been utilised as possible sensitizers in DSSCs. In addition to coordination complexes, a wide variety of metal-free organic dyes have been designed and developed as potential sensitizers in DSSCs, and their structure-device performance relationships have been established.
Ferrocene and its derivatives possess a well-defined reversible one-electron redox process and electron-donating properties. Since the formal reduction potential of the ferrocenyl group is dependent on the nature of substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring, the redox potential can be tuned to obtain the desired potential for a specific application. Inspired by these properties of ferrocene and its absorbance at ∼430 nm, which can obviously be tuned by introducing suitable functional moieties, we have investigated the light harvesting properties of ferrocene-based sensitizers, which include both the organic derivatives of ferrocene and its transition and main-group metal complexes in which ferrocene as a cornerstone has been proposed to act as an antenna in DSSCs. A few studies are available in which ferrocene derivatives have been deployed as a sensitizer in DSSCs. Mishra et al. have reported ferrocenyl-substituted triphenylamine-based donor–acceptor dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells, whereas Sirbu et al. have reported DSSCs fabricated using a trisubstituted ferrocene-based porphyrin derivative with a Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte that exhibits modest conversion efficiency. Moreover, Cariello and co-workers have designed some ferrocenyl-based dyes and investigated the role of π-conjugation in the conversion efficiency.
Among the components of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), the ancillary ligand possesses outstanding multifunctional photophysical and photochemical abilities and is therefore crucial in determining the overall power conversion efficiency. Several approaches have been reported to enhance the light harnessing capability of the ancillary ligand. A recent literature survey has indicated that 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) as an ancillary ligand in distorted square planar d8 complexes can be utilized for DSSC applications in which dppf has been proposed to behave as a light harvester.
In the same vein and in search of new dyes for DSSC applications, we herein report the synthesis, characterization, and DSSC applications of two new Ni(dppf)dithiolates comprising 2,2-diacetyl (D-1) and 2-nitro (D-2) anchors. Our investigation reveals that these compounds offer relatively poor photovoltaic performances; thus, an attempt has been made to shed light on the poor performances of dyes using theoretical calculations. The results of these investigations are presented herein.

The 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf)-appended nickel(II) dithiolates were prepared by reacting the precursor [Ni(dppf)Cl2] with dithallium 2,2-diacetyl-1,1-ethylenedithiolate (Tl2ACACED) (for D-1) and dipotassium 2-nitro-1,1-ethylenedithiolato (K2NED) (for D-2) in appropriate stoichiometric ratios in dichloromethane and methanol (Scheme 1). Both compounds are air stable and have been characterized by IR, 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses, and their structures have been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.


The purity and composition of both sensitizers was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy performed in CDCl3. Both compounds display well-resolved 1H NMR resonances, which match well to the corresponding hydrogens. IR spectra of the compounds display bands at around 3000 cm−1, which correspond to C–H vibrations. In D-1, the bands at 1692, 1611, and 1188 cm−1 can be ascribed to νCO, νCC, and νCS2, respectively. For the sensitizer D-2, the band at 1510 cm−1 can be assigned to νCC. The two bands at 1433 and 1249 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the –NO2 group, respectively, whereas the band at 1159 cm−1 arises because of νCS2.


Single crystals of D-1 and D-2 were obtained by slow evaporation of a dichloromethane–methanol mixture (50:50 v/v). The X-ray structural analyses of D-1 and D-2 indicate that the immediate geometries around the NiS2P2 core in both sensitizers can be described as distorted square planar. The Ni–S1 and Ni–S2 bond lengths are 2.1928(10) and 2.1841(10) Å for D-1 and 2.2182(7) and 2.1932(7) Å for D-2, respectively. The Ni–P1 and Ni–P2 bond distances in D-1 are 2.2206(10) and 2.1971(10) Å, whereas in D-2, they are 2.2275(7) and 2.1947(6) Å, respectively. The bite angles S1–Ni–S2 in 1 and 2 are 78.03(4)° and 77.51(3)°, which are significantly acute in comparison with the bite angles ∠P1–Ni–P2 of 99.89(4)° and 98.75(3)° for 1 and 2, respectively. Additionally, the C35–C36 bond length in both compounds is close to that of a double bond at 1.355(5) and 1.378(4) Å. The perspective views of D-1 and D-2 are presented in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively.


Electronic absorption spectra of the dyes were obtained in a dichloromethane solution and are presented in Fig. 3. The electronic absorption spectra for both sensitizers display a prominent band located at ∼410–420 nm, which is due to the d → d (assigned to 1E1g ← 1A1g) transition corresponding to the ferrocenyl fragment of the dppf ligand as well as charge transfer from the Ni(II) center to the NiS2P2 fragment of the sensitizers (Table 1). When compared with the characteristic electronic absorption spectrum of the dppf ligand in a similar wavelength region, the characteristic electronic absorption spectrum of the sensitizers displays a blue shift. However, intensities of the bands for D-1 and D-2 are much stronger as compared to those for the dppf ligand. This enhancement in intensity confirms the occurrence of both the d → d transition corresponding to the ferrocenyl fragment as well as the metal → dithio ligand charge transfer. The observed electronic absorption spectra for both dyes have been corroborated using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, which indicate that the first lower energy transition at 430 nm for D-1 and 440 nm for D-2 can be assigned to be operating from the ferrocenyl moiety of the dppf ligand with an admixture of the Ni(II) orbitals towards the NiS2P2 fragment. The higher-energy transitions calculated at 378 and 388 nm for D-1 and D-2, respectively, arise from NiS2 to C{C(O)Me}2 in the case of D-1 and from CC(H)NO2 for D-2 (Table 1).

The electronic absorption spectra of dyes obtained on a TiO2 film (Fig. 4) indicate slight broadening as well as a minor bathochromic shift, which may occur because of aggregation or electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed to discover the reversibility of the dyes and ascertain the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels for the dyes. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the dyes help to assess the probability of electron transfer from the photo-excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 as well as regeneration of dyes by a redox mediator (I−/I3−). Both dyes exhibit redox property in the solution phase due to presence of ferrocene entity in the dppf fragment. The apparent variation in the values of redox potential in both dyes may be because ferrocene is present in the ancillary part of the system (Fig. 5). Both dyes exhibited quasi-reversible redox waves, and the values of the electrochemical parameters are presented in Table 2.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TiO2 and dyes as well as the redox potential value of the redox couple play a key role in evaluating the efficiency of electron transfer from photo-excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 and dye regeneration processes in DSSCs. The HOMO energy level of the dye should be sufficiently positive or lower than the redox potential value of the redox couple I−/I3− (−0.15 V), and the LUMO should be sufficiently negative or above the conduction band of TiO2 for efficient electron injection. To construct an energy level diagram, the HOMO–LUMO values of dyes were calculated by the oxidation and reduction values obtained from the respective cyclic voltammograms. The HOMO and LUMO of a dye are calculated by the equations E° = (Ep,a + Ep,c)/2 and E° + hν, respectively, and the values are summarized in Table 1. From the energy level diagram (Fig. 6), it is evident that the HOMO and LUMO levels are in a favorable position with respect to the energy levels of the dye and redox couple for better electron transfer and dye regeneration. Overall, the cyclic processes in DSSCs with the D-1 and D-2 dyes are anticipated to be thermodynamically feasible.

The probable electron injection mechanisms have been assessed by performing density of states (DOS) calculations of (TiO2)30, the dyes D-1 and D-2, and dye + (TiO2)30 systems. The DOS for all the investigated systems are presented in Fig. 7. Compared to the DOS of the (TiO2)30 cluster (Fig. 7), the DOS of both dyes exhibit clearly localized states, which are all occupied (Fig. 7). In the case of dye + (TiO2)30, the DOS plot clearly indicates core states, valence band (VB), and conduction band (CB). The fundamental TiO2 valence band is located at the energy levels roughly between −10.0 eV and −8.2 eV, and the conduction band is located starting from −4.2 eV. From the DOS plot for a bare (TiO2)30 cluster, a clear separation between the VB and CB without any gap states is observed. The adsorption of dyes onto the (TiO2)30 nanoparticle surface introduces occupied states at the lower part of the nanoparticle band gap and extends the valence states from around −8.2 eV to −5.4 eV for D-1 + (TiO2)30 and from −8.2 eV to −5.3 eV for D-2 + (TiO2)30. Based on the DOS plots (Fig. 7), it can be concluded that lower energy electrons are excited from the VB energy levels approximately between −8.2 and −5.4 to −5.3 eV for dye + (TiO2)30 and then transferred to the CB states above −4.2 eV. Based on the DOS plot, the minimum inter-band excitation energy lies in the range of 1.2 eV for D-1 + (TiO2)30 and 1.1 eV for D-2 + (TiO2)30. Therefore, on the basis of the inter-band excitation energy, it can be concluded that electron coupling in D-2 + (TiO2)30 is slightly better than that in D-1 + (TiO2)30; this may lead to slightly better photovoltaic performance of D-2 than that of D-1 in DSSCs.


The current–potential (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on D-1 and D-2 are presented in Fig. 8, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters viz. short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and overall conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 3. The dye D-2 containing the nitro anchor shows a maximum overall conversion efficiency of 3.21% with a 100 mW cm−2 light intensity under 1.5 AM. Under similar measurement conditions, D-1 shows a cell efficiency of about 2.32%. The high cell efficiency (η) for the cell fabricated using D-2 is due to its comparatively higher Jsc value, which can be attributed to its relatively better light harvesting efficiency than that of D-1 in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DSSCs based on D-1 and D-2 dyes is shown in Fig. 9. The IPCE curves of DSSCs based on D-1 and D-2 show broad absorption in the range from 350 to 550 nm, with maxima at 43% and 48%, respectively. The resemblance of the IPCE spectra with the absorption spectra confirms sensitization by the dye molecules. The dye D-2 shows a higher IPCE value than D-1; this conforms to the higher photocurrent of D-2 as compared to that of D-1. The lower and higher IPCE value of the dyes D-1 and D-2, respectively, may be because of the variation in their respective molar extinction coefficients, and these results are consistent with the absorption spectra of dyes in solutions as well as on the TiO2 films.
The reported efficiencies of D-1 and D-2 are comparable to those of the previously reported analogues Ni(dppf)dithiolate dyes. However, the highest efficiency (η = 3.21) we found herein for the dye D-2 is slightly lower than that of the previously reported dye with an EtOC(O)C(CN) anchor. Possible reasons for the modest efficiencies of these Ni(dppf)dithiolate dyes have not been explained in previous studies. Theoretical calculations on dyes D-1 and D-2 indicate an unfavourable charge transfer from the dithiolate fragment to the dppf moiety (Fig. 10a). This charge transfer under normal circumstances cannot sensitize the TiO2 nanoparticles as we expect that the dyes may be anchored to the TiO2 nanoparticles through the 2,2-diacetyl (D-1) and 2-nitro (D-2) group of dithiolate. However, the nature of the charge transfer in these dyes after their adsorption on TiO2 nanoparticles was reversed (Fig. 10b), i.e. from dithiolate to the TiO2 nanoparticle. As a consequence, both dyes were producing a photosensitization effect on TiO2. However, non-involvement of the ferrocenyl entity of the dppf ligand in this charge transfer might lead to moderate efficiencies of these dyes.

The electron transport properties at the DSSC cell interfaces have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), performed over a frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz under AM 1.5 at the open circuit potential (OCP). In the Nyquist plots of EIS (Fig. 11a), the semicircle of the middle frequency region is associated with the charge transfer operating at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In our EIS study, the charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface in light is alleviated with the decreasing diameter of the semicircle. From this study, it was observed that the charge transport resistance was low for the DSSC based on D-2 as compared to that for the DSSC based on the dye D-1. Further, Bode phase plots (Fig. 11b) were plotted to determine the effective lifetime (τeff) of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band using the following equation:
τeff = 1/2πf
where the frequency (
f) corresponds to the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak. Derived from the Bode phase plot (Fig. 11b), the frequencies for the dye D-1 and D-2 are 54.36 Hz and 32.41 Hz and their electron lifetimes (τeff) calculated from the abovementioned equation are 2.93 ms and 4.91 ms, respectively. The lifetime calculation suggested that the recombination at the semiconductor/dye/electrolyte interface has been suppressed in the dye D-2-fabricated cell assembly.


The OCVD method is an important parameter to measure the recombination lifetime of the injected electron to the oxidized dye molecules. Voc decay reflects the decrease in electron concentration, which is generally caused by the charge recombination of injected electrons to oxidized dyes or oxidized I3− of the redox couple. The OCVD behaviors of the dyes D-1 and D-2 are shown in Fig. 12. The OCVD decay rates decrease in the order D-1 > D-2, which indicates that the cell fabricated with dye D-2 has a much slower decay rate than that fabricated with the dye D-1. From this observation, it can be inferred that there is slower interfacial electron recombination in the cell fabricated with dye D-2 as the dye quickly injects the photogenerated electrons into TiO2 before exciton recombination tends to produce high photo voltage, which decreases slowly due to recombination losses.



Fig. 13 shows the transient current–time (J–t) curve profile for the cell fabricated using the dyes D-1 and D-2. Importantly, this investigation is focused on the sustainability of the photocurrent and response time of the photoanode during the ON/OFF mode of light. From the transient current–time (J–t) profiles, it is evident that upon illumination, the photo anodes with dye D-2 show photocurrent at its highest value, which remains constant without any significant decay. It can be concluded that the dye regeneration process is fast enough to cope with the rate of electron injection from the photo-excited dye molecules. The photo anode with dye D-1 shows a 5–8% photocurrent loss, which is probably due to recombination loss. Upon switching to the ‘OFF’ condition, the photocurrent falls quickly and sharply; this indicates less surface electrons, resulting in a slower photocurrent response.


Based on the findings of the present investigation, it can be concluded that the synthesized Ni(dppf)dithiolates comprising 2,2-diacetyl and -nitro groups are suitable as donor-type sensitizers. Their sensitization effects were evinced by their photo-action spectra. However, the obtained photovoltaic parameters for these dyes were modest, and the direction of charge transfer was not as expected. However, after adsorption over TiO2 nanoparticles, the reversal of charge transfer leads to the sensitization of TiO2 to a moderate extent. From these investigations, it can be concluded that dppf-appended Ni(II)dithiolates with varied anchoring groups will provide moderate photovoltaic qualities; however, an increase in the electron-withdrawing properties of the anchor attached with the dithiolate ligands, as observed in the case of EtOC(O)C(CN) anchor, may lead to enhancement in the photovoltaic parameters.


All chemicals and reagents were commercially available and used without further purification. Solvents were distilled in accordance with the standard procedure. The ligands Tl2ACACED46a and K2NED46b as well as the precursor NidppfCl246c were prepared in accordance with previous studies.


Elemental analyses were performed using a Perkin-Elmer 240 C, H, N analyzer. Infrared spectra were obtained via Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S using KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using the BRUKER Avance III FTNMR spectrophotometer. The chemical shifts have been reported in parts per million using TMS as an internal standard. The electronic absorption spectra in a dichloromethane solution were obtained using the SPECORD 210 PLUS BU UV-vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemistry measurements were carried out using a Pt working electrode, a Pt rod counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl working electrode. All electrochemical experiments were carried out in dichloromethane. In all the cases, TBAP (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. After each experiment, the reference electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple, which was found to be at 0.55 V. The photoelectrochemical performance, including the short-circuit current (Jsc, mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (Voc, V), fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η), was determined from the J–V curve obtained using digital Keithley 236 SMU under irradiation of white light from a 1000 W/HS xenon arc lamp with a 100 mW cm−2 light intensity with 1.5 AM. The active cell area was 0.25 cm2. The transient current–time profile curve was obtained by the same electrochemical workstation.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 300 W Xe lamp light source joined to a monochromator (Oriel). A reference Si photodiode calibrated for spectral response was used for the monochromatic power-density calibration. Photocurrents were measured under short-circuit conditions.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a CH 660C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a two-electrode configuration. The TiO2 photoanode was used as a working electrode, and Pt electrode was used as a counter electrode. The electron transport properties were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) performed over a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm2) or in the dark by applying a forward bias of 0.75 V. The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were performed using a CH 660C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a two-electrode configuration. The OCVD experiment was conducted by monitoring the subsequent decay of Voc after stopping the illumination on DSSCs under open circuit condition.
To avoid spurious light reflections and refractions, a black mask is used for the cell on the illuminated side and also the covered side area of the cell that largely contributes to the cell response and leads to erroneous interpretation. The reproducibility and reliability of all results were confirmed by testing three cells of each D-1 and D-2-sensitized photoanode and keeping all structural and photovoltaic characterizations identical.

The conductive glass plates (FTO glass, sheet resistance ∼15 Ω cm−2), PT1 platinum paste, thermoplastic sealant, N719 dye, and transparent titania paste were purchased from Dyesol, Australia. Solvents and chemicals were of electrochemical grade and used as received. The TiO2 photoanodes were prepared by the doctor blade method and annealed in air at 450 °C for 1 hour at a rate of 4 °C min−1. After annealing the TiO2 thin film, it was dipped in the ethanolic solution of dye (N719, 3 × 10−4 M) for 12 hours and then washed with ethanol to wash off the unabsorbed dye molecules. The platinum electrodes were prepared by screen printing the commercial platinum paste on FTO and annealing in air at 400 °C for 1 hour at a rate of 4 °C min−1. The substrates with thin nanoporous TiO2 layers (∼6 μm) were dipped in a dichloromethane solution of dyes D-1 and D-2 (1 × 10−5 M) and kept overnight. The unabsorbed dye was washed out with anhydrous ethanol. Pt-layered counter-electrodes were prepared by a Pt catalyst (Solaronix), screen printed on FTO, and then sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and platinum-coated counter electrodes were sandwiched in a face-to-face manner leaving space for connecting them with the external load. This sandwich-type assembly was sealed from all sides using a hot melt sealant/spacer, and the electrolytic solution (an electrolyte composed of 0.6 dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile) was injected through a predrilled hole in the counter electrode. Copper wires were fixed on both electrodes using silver paste and araldite for electrical contact.


Intensity data for D-1 and D-2 were obtained at 150(2) K via a Rigaku Xcalibur, EosS2 single-crystal diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Unit cell determination, data collection, and data reduction were performed using the CrysAlisPro software. For all structures, an empirical absorption correction using spherical harmonics was employed. The structures were solved with SHELXT and refined by a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 (SHELXL-2014-16). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed at the calculated positions and refined using a riding model.

To ascertain the nature of electronic transitions in the D-1 and D-2 compounds, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. Optimized molecular geometries were calculated using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional. The MDF10 basis set for Fe and 6-31G** basis set for other atoms were used for geometry optimization. The optimized structures of the compounds were used for molecular orbital analyses as well as for the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations using a polarised continuum model (PCM). The solvent parameters of dichloromethane were employed. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programme. The TiO2 cluster(TiO2)30 + D-1/D-2 systems were optimized using a 3-21G* basis set, and the initial geometry was taken from the relaxed geometry of the (TiO2)30 cluster and D-1/D-2.
