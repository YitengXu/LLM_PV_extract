A multilayered semiconductor sensitizer structure composed of three differently sized CdSe quantum rods (QRs), labeled as Q530, Q575, Q590, were prepared and deposited on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) for photovoltaic applications. By varying the arrangement of layers as well as the time of EPD, the photoconversion efficiency was improved from 2.0% with the single layer of CdSe QRs (TiO2/Q590/ZnS) to 2.9% for multilayers (TiO2/Q590Q575/ZnS). The optimal EPD time was shorter for the multilayered structures. The effect of CdS quantum dots (QDs) deposited by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) was also investigated. The addition of CdS QDs resulted in the enhancement of efficiency to 4.1% for the configuration (TiO2/CdS/Q590Q575/ZnS), due to increased photocurrent and photovoltage. Based on detailed structural, optical, and photoelectrical studies, the increased photocurrent is attributed to broadened light absorption while the increased voltage is due to a shift in the relevant energy levels.

Increased environmental pollution and fast depletion of fossil fuels have demanded the development of clean renewable energy. Solar energy is an attractive candidate for alternative energy. Photovoltaic cells have attracted significant attention due to their enormous potential, since incident solar energy on earth is 104 times more powerful than any other energy source currently used and is environmentally friendly. Silicon solar cells have dominated the photovoltaic market for years, as they have high power conversion efficiencies up to 25% due to excellent charge transport properties and environmental stability of silicon. However, manufacturing methods of silicon solar cells are costly and complex. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as alternatives, have reached an efficiency of 13% using a ruthenium complex as a sensitizer but have issues of instability and sealing the liquid electrolytes used.

A possible replacement of dye molecules are semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) that have strong visible light absorption. Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are attracting growing interest as candidates for the development of next generation photovoltaic devices. The QD sensitizers are of particular interest due to their advantages of a tunable bandgap in the visible light region, a high extinction coefficient, a large intrinsic dipole moment, and relatively simple and cheap production. The metal chalcogenide QDs widely used as sensitizers for photovoltaic cells include CdS, CdSe, CdTe, PbS, PbSe and Sb2S3. These semiconductors have a high enough conduction band edge to allow the transfer of photogenerated electrons to large bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO and SnO2. Among these QDs, CdSe has emerged as one of the most promising materials given its tunable bandgap across the visible region, a large molar extinction coefficient (105–106 M−1 cm−1), fast electron injection time from CdSe on TiO2 (16 ps), and long excited electron lifetime (100 ps). CdSe QDs can be synthesized with various morphologies by varying the precursors of Cd and Se, reaction temperature and reaction time. In the meantime, quantum rods (QRs) of CdSe have been used as sensitizers in solar cells and have shown improved photovoltaic properties due to the large absorbance cross sections for enhanced light harvesting. In addition, the photogenerated electron lifetime in QRs is longer than in QDs due to better charge separation and transport as well as larger surface area for interacting with electrolytes. Moreover, an improved photovoltaic efficiency in QRs over QDs as sensitizers was founded and attributed to their elongated shape.
Multilayered sensitizers, including CdSe, CdS and ZnS QDs, have shown promising results when tested in QDSCs. The construction of multilayered solar cells was previously studied using different techniques, mainly electrophoretic deposition (EPD), successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD). EPD is a useful method for making films from colloidal QDs, especially CdSe QDs, because this method presents several advantages over other deposition techniques, either as linker-assisted or directly adsorbed, for its simplicity and short deposition time. Compared to several hours or even days with other techniques, EPD takes 2 h for effective deposition. In a study using ternary metal chalcogenide CdSe QDs as a sensitizer and electrophoresis as the deposition method, an efficiency of 3.2% was achieved for a QDSC with two layers of CdSe QDs. SILAR is a simple and reproducible method for growing target materials with good controllability even on porous surfaces. CBD can form good heterojunctions between the QDs and the semiconductor electrode, however the control of particle size and crystallinity is limited and the process can take several hours or even longer. To date, no deposition method could be regarded as a general and unified procedure for preparing photoanodes, and different techniques can lead to different performances of the resulting solar cells.
In this study, EPD was used to deposit three CdSe QRs of different sizes, with absorption peaks centered at 530 nm (Q530), 575 nm (Q575) and 590 nm (Q590) as single layer or multilayers by optimizing the deposition time. The configuration of TiO2/CdSeQ590/ZnS exhibits a maximum efficiency of 2.08%. The combination of differently sized CdSe QRs in the TiO2/CdSeQ590Q575/ZnS configuration enhances the photovoltaic efficiency to 2.89%. The ZnS QDs were deposited by the SILAR method to act as a blocking layer at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface to suppress charge recombination. CdS was deposited with the purpose of broadening light absorption in the region at around 400–500 nm, resulting in an increase of the efficiency to 4.13% with the arrangement of TiO2/CdS/CdSeQ590Q575/ZnS. In this configuration, the overall enhanced conversion efficiency was attributed to broadened light absorption by CdS and suppressed electron–hole recombination by ZnS.

A WER2-0 Reflector and DSL 18NR-T TiO2 Paste were obtained from DYESOL. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%), acetylacetone (>99%), trioctylphosphine (TOP 90%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO 99%), cadmium oxide (CdO 99%), selenium powder (Se 99%) cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and toluene anhydrous (99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA 99%) was purchased from PCI synthesis. Sulphur (S), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O), acetone, absolute ethanol, and methanol were obtained from KARAL. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC-15) was obtained from MTI.


CdSe QRs were synthesized based on the protocol of Peng et al., with minor changes, where CdO is utilized as a Cd precursor, TDPA and TOPO are the ligands and coordinating solvents, respectively. The synthesis was performed under air-free conditions, wherein 0.05 g (∼0.39 mmol) of CdO, 0.3 g (∼1.1 mmol) of TDPA, and 4 g of TOPO were heated to 320 °C under a nitrogen flow. A SeTOP (0.7% by weight) solution was obtained by adding 0.026 g of Se powder with 4.25 mL of TOP inside a glovebox and stirred for 1 h. Once reaching 320 °C, the Cd–TDPA–TOPO solution was cooled to 275 °C prior to the injection of SeTOP. Under a nitrogen flow, 3 mL of SeTOP was injected, which resulted in temperature decrease to 260 °C. Temperature was then increased again for several minutes to allow particle growth of different sizes. Three reaction times were tested, t1 = 1, t2 = 3 and t3 = 5 min, obtaining three CdSe QRs sizes: Q530, Q575 and Q590. The CdSe solutions were cooled and were removed from the reaction flask at around 80 °C and dissolved into ∼10 mL of toluene. The QRs in toluene were then cleaned twice through a precipitation and decantation regime using methanol and centrifugation at 3000 rpm, while the QRs were dissolved in toluene prior to their use as sensitizers.


Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (MTI, TEC-15) glasses were cleaned with water, acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min each before use. The photoelectrodes were made up of three different TiO2 stacked layers. (1) Compact layer (C): a solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (0.2 M) using acetylacetone/ethanol (1:1, v:v) was deposited by spray pyrolysis over FTO and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, obtaining a thicker layer of 150 nm. (2) Transparent layer (T): TiO2 paste (DSL 18-NRT, 20 nm average particle size) was deposited on FTO glass by the Doctor Blade method obtaining a 6.5 μm thick layer, and (3) scattering layer (opaque) (S): a Wer2-O Reflector paste (200 nm particle size) was deposited by the Doctor Blade method obtaining a 7.5 μm layer. The films were sintered for 30 min at 450 °C to obtain a good electrical contact between nanoparticles.


CdSe QRs and CdS QDs were deposited under different configurations: (a) TiO2/CdSeQ530/ZnS, TiO2/CdSeQ575/ZnS and TiO2/CdSeQ590/ZnS, (b) TiO2/CdSeQ530–Q590/ZnS, TiO2/CdSeQ530–Q575/ZnS, TiO2/CdSeQ575–Q590/ZnS and TiO2/CdSeQ590–Q575/ZnS, (c) TiO2/CdSeQ590–Q575–Q530/ZnS, and (d) TiO2/CdS/CdSeQ590–Q575/ZnS.


TiO2 electrodes with and without CdS films were inserted face to face with a FTO in a colloidal QR cuvette (2.5 mL of solution) and kept at a distance of 0.2 cm. A constant voltage of 200 V was applied at varying times from 30 to 120 min to allow the deposition of QRs onto the photoelectrode, which was connected to the positive terminal of the power supply. For multiple layers of QRs, the step was repeated by changing the solution with the QRs of the desired size.


CdS and ZnS QDs were grown on TiO2 electrodes by the SILAR method. For this purpose, solutions of 0.05 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O dissolved in ethanol as a Cd2+ source and Na2S 0.05 M in methanol:water (v:v = 1:1) as a S2− source were used. A single SILAR cycle consisted of 1 min dip-coating of the TiO2 electrode into the cadmium solution (Cd2+) and subsequently into the sulfide solutions, also during 1 min. Between each dipping step in a precursor solution the electrodes were thoroughly rinsed by immersion in ethanol and methanol:water solvents, respectively, during 1 min in order to remove the excess precursors. Seven SILAR cycles were performed to obtain a uniform coverage of the TiO2 NPs with CdS QDs. Besides, all the samples were deposited with ZnS QDs by SILAR, using Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O 0.1 M and Na2S 0.1 M as Zn2+ and S2− sources. The solvent was deionized water. The films were dipped for 1 min in the solutions of each ion precursor, and rinsed 1 min with solvent, making 2 SILAR cycles.


Cu2S counter electrodes were fabricated by immersing brass foil in an HCl solution (38% in volume) at 90 °C for 1 hour, then they were sulfated by adding a drop (20 mL) of the polysulfide electrolyte. The composition of the polysulfide electrolyte was 1.0 M Na2S, 1.0 M S and 0.1 M NaOH using distilled water. The solar cells were constructed by assembling the Cu2S counter electrode and sensitized TiO2 film electrode with a binder clip separated by a Scotch spacer. Then, the polysulfide electrolyte was filled inside the cell.


Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw Raman System (inVia Raman Microscope) with a 20× objective lens with the excitation laser operating at 785 nm. The integration time for each Raman measurement was 20 s. For the Raman signal detection, the laser excitation light was directly focused onto the TiO2 films with a laser power of ∼5 mW and the aforementioned integration time. TEM images were collected on a FEI Titan 80–300 with an accelerating voltage set to 300 kV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the photoelectrodes was performed using a JEOL microscope (JSM-7800F) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). UV-Vis absorption measurements were carried out using an Agilent Technologies Spectrophotometer (Cary 5000). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of colloidal CdSe QRs were measured by transmittance and TiO2 substrate absorption spectra were measured via diffuse reflectance scanning between 300 and 800 nm using an integrating sphere of 60 mm. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a Gamry (reference 600) potentiostat/galvanostat, lighting with an Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator. Light intensity was adjusted using the NREL-calibrated Si solar cell having a KG-2 filter for one sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra measurements were done using a 450 W Xenon Lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a monochromator (Newport model 74125). The energy levels of the QRs were calculated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, performed with a conventional three-electrode system using an Ag/AgCl and Pt wire as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The working electrode was a CdSe film deposited on FTO by pipetting and a solution of 1 M Na2S was used as an electrolyte. Impedance spectroscopy was carried out applying a small voltage perturbation (10 mV rms) at frequencies from 105 Hz to 10−1 Hz for different forward bias voltages.


The structural characterization of the TiO2 films was performed using Raman spectroscopy, with the results shown in Fig. 1. A very intense peak at 144 cm−1 and three weaker peaks at 396, 517 and 638 cm−1 are characteristic of the anatase phase of TiO2. The morphologies of the CdSe QRs and the CdS, ZnS and CdSe sensitized TiO2 films determined using TEM and SEM, and some representative images are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. TEM images show the morphology of CdSe QRs prepared at different reaction times. At 1 min, nanorods with an average size of 4.8 nm (Q530) in length were obtained, as shown in Fig. 2a. At reaction times of 3 and 5 min, the QRs grew up to 7 nm (Q575) and 10 nm (Q590), respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 2b and c. Likewise, a change in average width was observed at different reaction times, 3.2, 3.8 and 5 nm for 1, 3, and 5 min, respectively, resulting in an overall increased aspect ratio between the length and width of 1.5, 1.8 and 2, respectively.


Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of TiO2 films sensitized with differently sized QRs and QDs: TiO2 (C + T), TiO2 (C + T)/CdS, TiO2 (C + T)/CdSeQ590, TiO2 (C + T)/CdS/CdSeQ590–Q575, TiO2 (C + T + S) and TiO2 (C + T + S)/ZnS. Fig. 3a shows the TiO2 film deposited by spray pyrolysis and blading (compact and transparent layers), respectively, as a homogenous, highly porous film with an average size of 20 nm for TiO2 nanoparticles. When the TiO2 film (C + T) was sensitized with CdS QDs by the SILAR method, the QDs are about 3 nm in average size, as seen in Fig. 3b. An image for uniform CdSeQ590 QRs sensitized TiO2 film (C + T) using the EPD method is shown in Fig. 3c. A micrograph of TiO2 film (C + T) sensitized with CdS QDs and CdSeQ590–Q575 QRs with both the SILAR and EPD methods, respectively, is shown in Fig. 3d, revealing uniform QDs/QRs filling partially the TiO2 pores. The TiO2 scattering layer is presented in Fig. 3e. It is observed that the nanocrystals have an irregular morphology, formed principally of cubes, triangles and rods. Fig. 3f shows the TiO2 film with ZnS deposited by SILAR, where the ZnS QDs deposited on the TiO2 nanoparticles are observed.
A SEM image and an EDS map of a cross sectional view of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS film are shown in Fig. 4. This configuration consists of TiO2 (compact, transparent and opaque layers) over the FTO substrate, a layer of CdS QDs deposited by SILAR, and CdSeQ590–Q575 deposited by EPD. Different layers are observed in the SEM image. The FTO film is observed to the right; adjacent is the TiO2 compact layer deposited by spray pyrolysis, with a layer thickness of 190 nm. The two TiO2 layers deposited subsequently can be seen as the transparent and opaque layer with a thickness of 6.5 μm and 7.5 μm, with an average particle size of 20 nm and 200 nm, respectively. The Ti, Cd, S, Se and Zn atoms show good distribution in three kinds of TiO2 films, as can be seen in the EDS map. However, it is observed a higher amount of Cd and S in the transparent layer, while the amount of Se is higher in the scattering layer.

Optical absorption of different colloidal CdSe QRs was characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, with emphasis on comparing the effect of size, as shown in Fig. 5A. All samples show two absorption peaks. Sample Q530 has absorption peaks at 530 nm and 430 nm, while Q575 has peaks at 575 nm and 470 nm, and Q590 at 590 nm and 490 nm. A red-shift is observed as the QR size increases, as expected based on the quantum confinement effect. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of different colloidal QRs with excitation at 390 nm are shown in Fig. 5B. The PL spectrum of Q530 shows an emission peak at 552 nm, which red shifts as the QR size is increased, at 593 nm for Q575 and 638 nm for Q590.

The UV-Vis spectra of different sensitized TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 6. The absorption spectra of CdSe QRs, CdS and ZnS QDs on TiO2 are presented in Fig. 6A. The TiO2 film alone has an absorption peak at 345 nm, as shown in Fig. 6A(a). With the deposition of differently sized CdSe QRs, the two absorption peaks present in colloidal CdSe QRs are observed, as expected (Fig. 6A(b–d)). The absorption peaks corresponding to CdSe Q530 are at 510 nm and 415 nm. For CdSeQ575, there is one absorption peak at 560 nm and a second peak is not clearly observed. Lastly, for CdSeQ590, two peaks are observed at 580 nm and 420 nm. The absorption peaks are shifted by about 20 nm when CdSe QRs were deposited over TiO2 films by EPD when compared to that of the original colloidal QRs. The CdS QDs showed broad absorption from 375 nm to 550 nm, as shown in Fig. 6A(e), while ZnS exhibits a peak at 315 nm (Fig. 6A(f)).
The multilayered configuration of differently sized CdSe QRs on TiO2 films is illustrated in Fig. 6B. When a double layer of CdSeQ530–Q590 QRs is deposited, two strong absorption peaks are observed at 515 and 595 nm (Fig. 6B(a)), which correspond to individual absorptions peaks of QRs Q530 and Q590 (Fig. 6A). The combination of CdSeQ575–Q530 shows peaks centered at 450 nm and 550 nm that are similar to the individual QR absorption (Fig. 6B(b)). For CdSeQ590–Q575, broad and strong absorption peaks are observed at 460 nm, 570 nm, and 640 nm (Fig. 6B(c)). With the deposition of three layers, CdSeQ590–Q575–Q530 shows three absorption peaks at 400 nm, 525 nm and 570 nm plus a new peak at 640 nm (Fig. 6B(d)). Finally, CdS QDs deposited by the SILAR method together with CdSeQ590–Q575 QRs deposited by EPD on TiO2 show two broad absorption bands, one from 400 nm to 550 nm and the second absorption band from 550 nm to 655 nm, increasing in intensity in the red region compared with individual CdSeQ590, as can be seen in Fig. 6B(e).

The current density–voltage J–V and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) characteristic curves of the QR-sensitized solar cells with an optimal single layer deposited and differently sized QRs are shown in Fig. 7. Table 1 shows the values of the FF, photoconversion efficiency, Jsc and Voc of different QR sizes and with respect to the electrophoretic deposition time. The fill factor (FF) and photoconversion efficiency (η) were calculated using eqn (1) and (2). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the open circuit–voltage (Voc) were obtained from the J–V curves.

In Fig. 7A three curves are shown, the curve for CdSeQ530 QRs obtained by EPD with an optimal time of 105 min shows a current of 4.81 mA cm−2 and a voltage of 499 mV (Fig. 7A(a)). The curve in Fig. 7A(b) shows the CdSeQ575 with an increment of the current to 6.8 mA cm−2, and a further current increase for CdSeQ590 QRs to 7.5 mA cm−2. The voltage decreased with CdSeQ575 to 473 mV but increased with CdSeQ590 to 504 mV. It is then noted that Jsc increased considerably from 4.8 mA cm−2 to 7.5 mA cm−2 when the particle size of CdSe QRs increased, while the change in Voc was smaller (30 mV), from 473 mV to 504 mV. Table 1 shows the results for three times of EPD tested: 90 min, 105 min and 120 min, with 105 min found as the optimal EPD time, with a reproducibility of 73%. The difference in efficiency between 105 min and 120 min for CdSeQ530 was not significant, while the Jsc is improved from 4.13 mA cm−2 to 5.04 mA cm−2, the FF decreased slightly from 59% to 58%. The cell with CdSeQ575 exhibited an efficiency of 1.6%, which is higher than the QR solar cell with CdSeQ530 (1.4%). When the EPD time was increased above the optimal time to 120 min, the electrochemical parameters decreased in the following way. The current density decreased from 6.9 mA cm−2 to 3.9 mA cm−2, the voltage fell from 473 mV to 354 mV and the FF decreased from 48% to 47%. In addition, the largest QRs (CdSeQ590) had the highest power conversion efficiency, 2.1%, with Jsc = 7.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 504 mV, and FF = 55%. In this case, the higher efficiency was obtained not with the highest Jsc, since the current density was higher for 120 min, 9.5 mA cm−2, and the voltage was basically the same, 501 mV, but the FF dropped considerably from 55% for 105 min to 41% for 120 min of EPD time.
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) provides a measure of how many electrons are photogenerated for each incident photon at a given wavelength (λ) and can be determined from the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), using the expression:
(3)
where
Iinc stand for the incident light power. The IPCE curve of TiO2/CdSe/ZnS presented in Fig. 7B shows that the external quantum efficiency decreased considerably from 55% for CdSeQ530 to 40% for CdSeQ590, although the change was not significant for CdSeQ575, 53%. A shift in the wavelength was also observed, beginning with 615 nm for CdSeQ530, 650 nm for CdSeQ575 and 690 nm for CdSeQ590.


Fig. 8A shows the J–V curve for the optimal combinations of CdSe QRs and time of EPD, where CdSeQ530–Q590 has a Jsc = 6.23 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 8A(a). The current increased with other combinations of double layers, CdSeQ575–Q530 (Jsc = 8.35 mA cm−2) and CdSeQ590–Q575 (Jsc = 9.32 mA cm−2), Fig. 8A(b and c). An increase in voltage was also observed, from Voc = 479 mV for CdSeQ530–Q590, Voc = 496 mV to CdSeQ575–Q530 and Voc = 537 mV to CdSeQ590–Q575. According with the results obtained using two layers of CdSe QRs, we decided to test three layers using the optimal EPD time of each combination. The configuration was CdSeQ590–Q575–Q530, shown in Fig. 8A(d), where the voltage was reduced near 100 mV. The addition of CdS to the optimal combination of CdSe, with the arrangement of sensitizers CdS/CdSeQ590–Q575, resulted in the voltage having an improvement and the current increasing almost by 30% from 9.3 mA cm−2 to 12.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8A(e)).

Table 2 summarizes the multilayered cell parameters with varying EPD times. The multilayered arrangement of CdSe QRs was optimized with regard to time of EPD and sequences of multilayers. First, two layers were deposited: CdSeQ530–Q590, CdSeQ575–Q590 and CdSeQ530–Q575, with this order and their respective inverses, varying the time of EPD from 30 min to 120 min. The combination of a double layer cell deposited with CdSeQ530–Q590 QRs showed an efficiency of 1.5%, with an optimal time of 60 min for CdSeQ530 and 30 min for CdSeQ590. With that combination of CdSe QR sensitizers, the only improvement observed is current density at the optimal EPD time. The voltage decreased while the FF is improved when the EPD time increased. The arrangement of CdSeQ530–Q575 had an efficiency of 1.9% with an EPD time of 60 min and 90 min, respectively. This exhibits a current of 6.62 mA cm−2, a voltage of 480 mV and a FF of 58%, with enhanced Jsc and FF when the time of CdSeQ575 deposition was increased. For the case of CdSeQ575–Q590 QRs deposited for 120 min and 30 min, the power conversion efficiency is 2.8%, with a current of 9.38 mA cm−2, a voltage of 516 mV, and a FF of 57%. An increase in the current and voltage was observed when the deposition time for CdSeQ575 was increased. For the reverse order, CdSeQ590–Q575, an efficiency of 2.9% was obtained, but less EPD time was necessary for CdSeQ575, and the other parameters were very similar. When we deposited three layers of CdSe, CdSeQ590–Q575–Q530, with the optimal times obtained previously, the voltage dropped to 388 mV, with a current of 6.82 mA cm−2 and the FF of 51%, resulting in a decrease of efficiency to 1.4%. Moreover, Table 2 presents the electrochemical parameters of CdS QDs as sensitizers of the QDSC. The major difference of this material was a higher Voc (578 mV) than that obtained with CdSe QRs, attaining an efficiency of 2.6%. By adding CdS QDs to the best combination of CdSe QRs, the configuration of TiO2/CdS/CdSeQ590–Q575/ZnS shows a substantial improvement in current and voltage, reaching 12.22 mA cm−2 and 580 mV, respectively, with a FF of 58% and an efficiency of 4.1%, with 95% of reproducibility. Fig. 9 presents the image of the complete cell showing the best configuration of the multilayered cell in a polysulfide electrolyte using the Cu2S counter electrode, and TiO2/CdS/CdSeQ590–Q575/ZnS photoelectrode.

Fig. 8B presents the IPCE curves. The external quantum efficiency increased for a double layer of CdSe QRs deposited from 36% of CdSeQ530–Q590 and 55% of CdSeQ575–Q530 to 60% of CdSeQ590–Q575 (Fig. 8B(a–c)). In comparison with a single layer cell, the photogeneration region was 50 nm wider. We observed that when three QRs with different sizes were deposited, no increase in quantum efficiency was observed (Fig. 8B(d)). CdS QDs deposited by SILAR (7 cycles) were used as co-sensitizers in the configuration of TiO2/CdS/CdSeQ590–Q575/ZnS to achieve an increased solar window spectrum of broader absorption by the multilayered solar cell. We observed an improved external quantum efficiency of 85%. The higher Voc and IPCE are attributed mainly to the inclusion of CdS QDs.
In order to confirm the quality of the experiments the Jsc obtained from current–voltage (J–V) measurement is compared with the Jsc(IPCE) value estimated from IPCE spectra. The Jsc(IPCE) average for all the samples is lower (∼20%) than the measured Jsc average. Jsc(IPCE) was obtained by integrating the product of the incident photon flux density F(λ) of AM 1.5 standard spectroscopy and IPCE(λ) of the cell over the wavelength (λ) of the incident light, expressed as
Jsc = ∫qF(λ)IPCE(λ)dλ

where
q is the electron charge.

The energy levels of TiO2, CdS, ZnS QDs and CdSe QRs were estimated with a linear fit of the Mott–Schottky curve obtained from EIS measurements. With this curve, the position of the conduction band was calculated. The bandgap corresponding to each material was calculated from the derivatives of the absorption spectra. The bandgaps were 2.4 eV, 2.2 eV and 2.13 eV for CdSe QRs Q530, Q575 and Q590, 2.45 eV and 3.54 eV for CdS and ZnS QDs, and 3.2 eV for TiO2, respectively. A diagram for the energy levels corresponding to each material used in the photoelectrode is shown in Fig. 10. The difference in the conduction bands among differently sized CdSe QRs was almost negligible. The position of the conduction band of CdS QDs also helps with the path of the charge carriers. The energy levels of ZnS QDs are also presented for comparison even though they are not acting as sensitizers due to a large bandgap.

The anatase phase of TiO2 is better for QDSC applications due to its higher electric conductivity, larger sensitizer loading capability, and higher electron diffusion coefficient compared with the rutile phase. The TiO2 film consists of three different layers: a compact layer, a transparent layer, and a scattering layer. The compact layer on the FTO is used to achieve higher photovoltage as it blocks the contact of the FTO surface with the redox electrolyte, the transparent layer with small nanoparticles ensures high quantum dot/rod loading, while the scattering layer with bigger nanoparticles increases the light scattering and consequently the light harvesting. The CdSe QRs used as sensitizers for TiO2 possess a series of advantages, including a higher surface area, easier electron–hole charge separation and efficient electron transfer, allowing improvement of QDSC characteristics. SEM images confirm good distribution of CdSe QRs and CdS QDs in TiO2 porous films using relatively simple deposition techniques. The high concentration of Cd and S ions on the TiO2 transparent layer could be attributed to the higher surface area of the transparent TiO2 layer in comparison to the scattering layer. However, the low concentration of Se into the TiO2 transparent layer is probably due to the hard penetration for the big CdSe QR size related to the TiO2 pore size.


CdS QDs show absorption in the visible region. However, inclusion of CdSe in the TiO2/CdS film helps to broaden the range of absorption. Furthermore, ZnS QDs act as blocking layers to suppress charge recombination at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, and do not contribute significantly to light absorption.


The cell deposited with a single layer of CdSe QRs shows high photocurrent density with increasing QR size. A lower current density with smaller particle size could be attributed to a wider bandgap, which has a high conduction band edge with respect to the energy levels of TiO2, resulting in less effective charge transfer and more recombination. The bandgap of different semiconductors used in this study are shown in Fig. 10. The optimal time for EPD was approximately 105 min obtaining the higher photovoltaic efficiency. At shorter time the efficiency decreases, this could be due to a low concentration of quantum dots coating the TiO2 film and therefore is obtaining a low efficiency in the cell. Also with a higher EPD time than 105 min the efficiency decreases. Since EPD offers the control of the thickness of a deposited QR layer through adjustment of the deposition time, as also has been shown by Besra and Liu and the CdSe thickness layer must be enough to give good coverage, but to keep the electron/hole recombination low, it is expected that prolonged EPD time may cause increase in the recombination of a charge carrier.

A multilayered cell configuration allows faster electron injection from small particles and broader absorption of larger particles. The best combination of the multilayered QRs was CdSeQ590–Q575, where the photocurrent was improved considerably due to the broaden visible absorption caused by two differently sized CdSe QRs and by a better band alignment between the conduction bands and the cascade position of the valence bands, as shown in Fig. 10. It is important to note that the combination of CdSeQ530–Q590 QRs (i.e. the smallest QRs with the largest QRs) did not result in any improvement. In addition, three layers of CdSe QRs show that the parameters Jsc, Voc and FF decrease. The energy levels of CdSe QRs demonstrated that the introduction of CdSeQ530 in the configuration of the photoelectrode is not suitable for the path of electrons, see Fig. 10.
On the other hand, it is known that the codeposition of CdS QDs and CdSe QRs improve the photoelectrochemical performance by allowing more absorption of CdSe QRs, resulting in a complementary effect in light harvesting due to the expansion of light absorption increasing the Jsc, and forming a cascading band structure increasing the Voc, see Fig. 10, confirming great improvement in the QDSC performance which reached a power conversion efficiency of 4.1%. The FF was higher with the multilayered arrangement than with the single layer of CdSe QRs, which indicates good capability for inhibiting the charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface as a result of the good CdSe coverage of the TiO2 film using two sizes of CdSe QRs. The comparison of these devices shows that the extended light absorption by the multilayered arrangement is not the primary reason for the improvement in the solar cell; instead the ordered layers seem to play an important role in achieving higher photoconversion efficiency.
The difference between the measured Jsc and the Jsc(IPCE) calculated (∼20%) is not significant, therefore the experimental quality is good. This difference can be attributed to a high light reflecting surface for J–V measurements and the thermal effects due to the illumination intensity that could be higher for measurement of the J–V curves.

We have studied the photoconversion efficiency of multilayered solar cells with differently sized CdSe QRs deposited by electrophoresis and optimizing the time of deposition. With a single layer of sensitizers, the cell performance was the best with the largest QRs (CdSeQ590), reaching a power conversion efficiency of 2.0% with an EPD time of 105 min. With a double layer (CdSeQ590–Q575), the efficiency was improved to 2.9%, and the optimal time of EPD was shorter, 30 min for CdSeQ590 and 60 min to CdSeQ575. When CdS QDs were added, a greater enhancement in the efficiency was achieved, 4.1%, with increased short-circuit current density and open circuit voltage, which are probably due to the increased light absorption and better alignment of the relevant energy levels. This study demonstrates that solar cell performance can be improved using rationally designed, multilayered structures of QRs and QDs for optimal light absorption as well as charge transfer and transport.
