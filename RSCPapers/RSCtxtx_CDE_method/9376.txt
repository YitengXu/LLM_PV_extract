Solution-processable organic photodiodes compensate well for the shortages of the traditional inorganic photodetectors in terms of their unique features, such as rich in varieties, low-cost manufacturing, light weight, high flexibility, and large-area scalability. Owing to the tunable optoelectronic properties of organic materials, both panchromatic and narrowband organic photodiodes have been achieved. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of organic near-infrared (NIR) photodiodes, mainly focusing on diverse device architectures toward superior performance. The key to achieving a high specific detectivity is a high responsivity while keeping dark current low. Interfacial engineering plays a critical role in suppressing the dark current, and has been identified as an essential approach for maximizing detectivity of organic photodiodes. Besides, optimization of photoactive layer thickness and morphology is also highly desirable. As to narrowband organic NIR photodiodes, we highlight three primary strategies: (i) the use of truly narrowband absorbers; (ii) the manipulation of internal quantum efficiency via charge collection narrowing; and (iii) the incorporation of a resonant optical microcavity structure to exploit charge-transfer absorption. The latter two creative approaches allow for response tuning by simply adjusting the thickness of photoactive layer and cavity, respectively.

Photodetectors (PDs) that convert incident photons into an electrical signal have plenty of important applications, such as image sensing, optical communication, environmental monitoring, night surveillance, and chemical/biological detection. To date, most mainstream PDs adopt crystalline inorganic semiconductors such as Si, GaN, InGaAs, etc., due to their excellent charge-carrier mobility, small exciton binding energy and high stability. However, these commercial inorganic PDs have a number of drawbacks including complicated and expensive manufacturing processes, mechanical inflexibility, high driving voltage, and low operating temperature, which limit their practical applications in large-area, flexible, low-cost and portable devices. Recently, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), often referred to as inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals, have emerged as a promising class of materials for photodetector applications. They possess several advantages, such as solution processability, size-tunable spectral sensitivity and flexible substrate compatibility. Broadband single-layer lead sulfide (PbS) nanocrystal-based photodiodes with a vertically stacked p-i-n type device architecture have been reported, displaying satisfactory detectivity >1011 Jones from 350 to 2000 nm. Besides CQD PDs, solution-processable organic PDs (OPDs) also compensate well for the shortages of traditional PDs in terms of their unique features: rich in varieties, low-cost manufacturing, light weight, high flexibility and large-area scalability. Therefore, they have attracted enormous attention in recent years, and present bright prospects for flexible electronic applications. Nevertheless, the charge-carrier mobility of organic semiconductors is significantly lower than their inorganic counterparts, which will negatively affect the responsivity (R) and response time of OPDs. Another disadvantage of organic materials is their low dielectric constant, resulting in the generation of highly localized, tightly bound Frenkel excitons (electron–hole pairs) upon photoexcitation. The exciton binding energy is in the range of 0.3–1 eV, much higher than the thermal energy at room temperature (kBT ≈ 0.026 eV). Hence, an organic bulk/flat heterojunction is needed to achieve efficient exciton dissociation.

In general, PDs can be classified as broadband (panchromatic) or narrowband (wavelength selective), depending on the width of their spectral response window. Broadband PDs are expected to have a spectrally flat, high detectivity across a broad wavelength range, e.g., from the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) to near-infrared (NIR) region, while narrowband PDs require spectral (color) discrimination and detect only a narrow range of light, e.g., red, green, blue, or a selective portion of NIR. Considering that the optical and electronic properties, such as absorption and energy levels, of organic semiconductors can be readily tuned via rational molecular design, both the broadband and narrowband OPDs have been realized. In contrast, tuning the spectral response range of inorganic PDs is a challenging task, and therefore separate sensors or materials are required to achieve panchromatic detection. In general, GaN-, Si-, and InGaAs-based PDs are used for the three important sub-bands, 250–400 nm (UV), 450–800 nm (visible) and 900–1700 nm (NIR), respectively. Narrowband photodetection in the state-of-the-art inorganic PDs is currently realized using broadband inorganic photodiodes in combination with a dichroic prism or set of optical filters. However, this approach increases the PD architectural complexity and cost, and also negatively impacts the picture quality and color constancy. From this point of view, OPDs could outperform their inorganic counterparts because of their enormous potential for realizing panchromatic and narrowband photodetection in an easy and cost-effective way.
NIR light spanning from 780 to 2500 nm carries important information for multiple applications such as telecommunications (1300–1600 nm), biological imaging (tissue-transparent window, 700–1000 nm) and solar cells (800–2000 nm). Currently, epitaxially grown inorganic semiconductor materials like InGaAs are used for commercial NIR PDs. Nevertheless, the high cost, complicated production process and lack of physical flexibility limit their widespread applications. Thus, NIR OPDs have been considered as a potential candidate for replacing traditional inorganic counterparts. Low-bandgap organic semiconductors that absorb NIR light have attracted increasing attention for PD applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no comprehensive overview of recent progress in NIR OPDs so far.
In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in organic NIR photodiodes, which have similar device architecture and working mechanism to organic solar cells (OSCs). We first summarize the key figure-of-merit parameters used to evaluate the performance of PDs (Section 2.2). Following this, we introduce the device configuration and operation mechanism of organic photodiodes and then provide a synopsis of major advances in panchromatic NIR OPDs (Section 3.1), mainly focusing on the interfacial engineering that plays a vital role in suppressing the dark current, molecular engineering and novel device structure. The survey is divided on the basis of the adopted organic donor material in the photoactive layer, it being a polymer (Section 3.1.1) or a small molecule (Section 3.1.2). Next in Section 3.2, we summarize three primary strategies that have been devised to achieve narrowband NIR photodetection. Finally, we present the challenges and prospects for future development of organic NIR photodiodes.

In comparison with inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors have many unique advantages, such as low-cost synthesis, versatility of functionalization, tunable optical and electronic properties, thin film flexibility, ease of processing, etc. However, it is still a great challenge for designing organic molecules to absorb light in the NIR region. Currently, the main design strategies for NIR dyes have included increasing the conjugation length of the organic materials and introducing the donor–acceptor (D–A) chromophore. Since this review mainly focuses on the OPD device, relatively little attention has been paid to the molecular design. For approaches of designing NIR-absorbing polymers/small molecules, the interested reader is referred to the recent review by Dou et al.


PD performance is conventionally characterized by the figure-of-merit parameters that are associated with efficiency, noise and speed. Herein, various terminology and figures of merit are summarized as follows:

(1) Responsivity (R(λ)): it is defined as the ratio of photocurrent generated to the incident optical power falling on the PD at a given wavelength λ. It is given by the expression
where
I(λ)ph is the photocurrent in amperes and P(λ)in is the incident optical power in watts.

(2) External quantum efficiency (EQE(λ)): it evaluates the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected to the number of incident photons. It can be expressed as
where
h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light and q is the elementary charge. When using the last approximation expression, values of λ in micrometers (μm) should be used.

(3) Noise equivalent power (NEP(λ)): it is defined as the signal optical power at which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is unity, giving the minimum detectable power per square root of bandwidth. It can be written as
where
In is the noise current spectral density, Δf is the electrical bandwidth of the noise measurement, and NEP(λ) is in units of W Hz−1/2. Total noise current in a PD is the sum of all the noise sources, including low-frequency flicker noise (1/f), thermal noise (also known as Johnson noise) and shot noise from dark current. The root-mean-square (rms) value of the shot noise current (Ish) is given by , where Id is the dark current. Assuming that the shot noise from the dark current is the dominant noise source, the NEP(λ) can be expressed as
(4) Specific detectivity (D*(λ)): it is the overall figure-of-merit for PDs, which normalizes the NEP(λ) to the device area (A). It can be written as
where
Jd is the dark current density. D*(λ) is expressed in units of cm Hz1/2 W−1; this unit was named after R. C. Jones, whereby 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1 = 1 Jones, in recognition of his contribution to radiation sensors. The second expression is obtained assuming that the shot noise is the main component of the overall PD noise. Although this assumption was adopted by many researchers, it is more accurate to measure the noise current instead of calculating it from dark current because in many instances, the measured noise current is much larger than the theoretical shot noise limit.

(5) Linear dynamic range (LDR(λ)): it describes the range of incident optical powers within which the photocurrent versus power is a linear function. Ideally, the R(λ) of the device should remain constant within the LDR. It can be expressed (in decibels) as
where
P(λ)max is the maximum impinging power above which the response of the device deviates from linearity and P(λ)min is the minimum detectable optical power or the NEP.I(λ)max and I(λ)min are the corresponding maximum and minimum photocurrent limits, respectively.

(6) Temporal response time (τ): it provides the response speed of a PD toward an incident optical signal and is expressed as the rise (τr) and decay (τd) times. τr and τd are defined as the rising time from 10% to 90% and the falling time from 90% to 10% of the maximum photocurrent, respectively, in response to a light pulse input. It is strongly related to the charge transport and collection, and charge recombination processes since recombination lifetimes of the charge carriers limit the efficient extraction of these carriers to an external circuit.
(7) −3 dB bandwidth (f−3dB): it is defined as the modulation frequency of input light at which the R(λ) of the device is 1/√2 (∼0.707) times that obtained under continuous illumination.
(8) On/off ratio: it is calculated as the I(λ)ph to Id ratio at fixed incident optical power and bias voltage conditions, which reflects the photosensitivity of a PD.

The organic photodiode configuration is very similar to the device configuration of OSCs, which are commonly composed of a bulk-heterojunction photoactive layer sandwiched between a transparent indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode and an opaque metal electrode. In order to promote the charge transport and collection, charge-transporting layers (CTLs) are introduced between electrodes and the photoactive layer. The other important role that CTLs play is their fine tuning effect of electrode work-function, which allows high work function metals (such as Au and Ag) to act as efficient cathodes. Depending on whether the ITO electrode serves as anode or cathode, the device structure of organic photodiodes (as with OSCs) can be classified as the conventional and inverted architectures shown in Fig. 1. The operating mechanism of organic photodiodes is also analogous to that of OSCs. Briefly speaking, the organic photoactive material absorbs the incident photons and creates singlet Frenkel excitons upon photo-excitation. The excitons subsequently diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface and are dissociated into free charge carriers, assisted by the built-in or applied electric field. The mobile carriers are transported by means of percolated pathways to the respective electrodes, and finally collected as photocurrent.

Although organic photodiodes share many common features with OSCs, there are a number of key differences between them. First, solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the most important parameter that determines the performance of an OSC. Since PCE is proportional to the product of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), all three parameters should be taken into account. For organic photodiodes, current is the only concern, and thus Voc and FF are not relevant. According to the expression of D*(λ), increasing the responsivity and suppressing the dark current are two main strategies to improve the D*(λ). Second, unlike OSCs, a reverse bias is externally applied to organic photodiodes to assist free charge carrier extraction. Therefore, organic photodiodes operate in the third quadrant of the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, while OSCs operate at the maximum power point in the fourth quadrant. Finally, OSCs need broadband absorption over the entire solar spectrum to achieve a high PCE, whereas spectral discrimination is particularly important for full-color imaging applications of organic photodiodes.
Because organic semiconductors possess easily tunable optical/electronic properties, both broadband (panchromatic) and narrowband (color-selective) OPDs have been realized. In the following section, we will review these two types of organic NIR photodiodes, mainly focusing on the approaches for panchromatic and selective photodetection.

Panchromatic photodetection is critically important for a variety of applications, including remote control, environmental monitoring and laboratory instrumentation for optical spectroscopy. Strongly pushed by research on OSCs, in which broadband light harvesting of the full solar spectrum is a prerequisite for achieving a high PCE, organic photodiodes, with their unique properties, are being explored as promising candidates for panchromatic detection. The panchromatic photoactive layer typically consists of an electron-donor and an electron-acceptor material with complementary absorption. According to whether their constituent molecules are small or large, organic semiconductors can be broadly classified as either small molecules or polymers. These two classes of materials are rather different in terms of their synthesis, purification, and chemical/physical properties (e.g., crystallinity, mobility and solution processability), and will be reviewed separately here. The chemical structures of some representative low-bandgap NIR polymers/small molecules are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes some of the major figure-of-merit parameters for broadband organic NIR photodiodes based on different materials and architectures.

Polymeric semiconductors possess an inherent advantage of solution processability, which make them compatible with printing technologies. In 2007, Yao et al. reported the first efficient polymer-based NIR photodiode with a novel low-bandgap (1.3 eV) polymer PTT (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. 2) as the electron donor and a classic fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor. The conventional device architecture was used to fabricate OPDs with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and Ca as HTL and ETL, respectively. A pure PTT thin film has a broad absorption band with a peak at 750 nm and a shoulder at 850 nm (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the EQE spectra of the photodiode are similar in shape to the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the PTT:PCBM blend film, indicating that both components contribute to the generation of photocurrent. At an incident wavelength of 850 nm, the EQE and R of the OPD reach 38% and 0.26 A W−1 at −5 V, respectively. Besides, this polymer NIR photodiode simultaneously exhibits fast response speed (f−3dB = 4 MHz for the device with active area of 1 mm2, as shown in Fig. 3c) and low dark current (NEP = 1.35 × 10−11 W Hz−1/2 at 850 nm under −5 V bias). In the same year, Perzon et al. presented a novel conjugated polymer, LBPP-1, with an extremely low bandgap of ∼1.0 eV. The LBPP-1:PCBM based photodiodes with the conventional device structure show a spectral response up to 1200 nm. These two pioneering works demonstrated that low-bandgap polymers have an enormous potential for application in NIR photodetectors.

In 2009, Gong et al. reported broadband polymer NIR photodiodes with a specific detectivity >1012 Jones from 300 to 1450 nm by using a small-bandgap (∼0.8 eV) conjugated polymer PDDTT blended with PCBM, which is a milestone for polymer-based panchromatic PDs to compete with conventional inorganic PDs. To achieve high detectivity, both PS-TPD-PFCB HTL and C60 ETL were employed to enhance the photocurrent and suppress the dark current of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4a, the EQE and calculated D* of the polymer PD with the simple conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDDTT:PCBM/Al are 26% and 2.1 × 1010 Jones, respectively, at 800 nm under −0.5 V bias. After introducing efficient CTLs (i.e., PS-TPD-PFCB HTL and C60 ETL) between the photoactive layer and electrodes, the D* sharply improved to 2.3 × 1013 Jones at 800 nm under −0.1 V bias (Fig. 4b). In comparison with Si and InGaAs PDs, the polymer photodiodes exhibit comparable or even larger detectivity, and broader response range. Furthermore, the LDR of the polymer PD with the efficient CTLs is more than 100 dB upon illumination at 800 nm, which is close to that (120 dB) of Si PDs and significantly higher than that (66 dB) of InGaAs PDs (Fig. 4c).

As shown by Gong et al., interfacial engineering plays a vital role in boosting the performance of organic photodiodes. An efficient HTL generally has appropriate energy levels for facilitating hole extraction while blocking electron injection, and vice versa for ETL. In 2011, Chen et al. reported a low-bandgap (optical bandgap, ∼1.15 eV) conjugated polymer PDTTP with intense absorption in the NIR region. The polymer PD with the simple conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDTTP:PCBM/Ca/Al possesses the EQE of 28.9% and 6.2% at 1000 and 1100 nm, respectively, under −5 V bias. The rectification ratio (forward-biased current/reverse-biased current) at ±5 V in the dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic was only 11 for the corresponding device, which can be attributed to the large reverse current resulting from the carrier injection. To further improve the detectivity of the OPD, it is highly desirable to incorporate carrier blocking layers into the device architecture to reduce the dark current. In another example, Qian et al. synthesized a diazapentalene (DAP)-containing polymer (named in the paper as P4) with a broad absorption (i.e., 600–1000 nm) and fabricated the NIR photodiodes with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P4:PCBM/Al. The D* of the PD is only 2.3 × 1010 Jones at 800 nm under −0.1 V bias, mainly due to the lack of efficient hole/electron blocking layers.

Hu et al. improved the performance of the NIR polymer photodiodes by incorporating an alcohol/water soluble polymer named PFN as the ETL and a transition metal oxide, MoO3 as the HTL. As shown in Fig. 5a, the reverse dark leakage current for the polymer PDs was considerably suppressed after incorporating the PFN ETL, which implies that the PFN layer is efficient in blocking holes. As a result of the reduced dark current, the polymer PD with the PFN layer exhibited a detectivity of 1.75 × 1013 Jones at 800 nm, which is two times higher than that (8.22 × 1012 Jones) of the PD without any ETL (Fig. 5b). Additionally, the air-stability of the polymer PDs was remarkably enhanced by adopting MoO3 as the HTL to replace acidic and hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS HTL. Liu et al. employed water-soluble cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QDs) as the HTL and electron-blocking layer (EBL) in polymer NIR PDs based on a PCPDTBT:PCBM photoactive layer. The PDs with CdTe QDs as the HTL exhibited ten-fold suppressed dark current density and analogous photocurrent density relative to the PDs with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, which resulted in the enhanced detectivity over 1011 Jones in the spectral range from 350 to 900 nm. Besides, the half-shelf-lives of unencapsulated polymer NIR PDs (defined as the time period for the detectivity to decay to half of its initial value) was improved from 120 to 480 hours after using CdTe QDs instead of PEDOT:PSS as the HTL.

One strategy to solve the stability issue of organic photodiodes is to use an inverted device architecture where the charge-collecting nature of the electrodes is reversed. In this structure, air-stable high-work-function metals (e.g., Au, Ag) are used as the top electrode to replace the air-sensitive, low-work-function Al, and the corrosive and hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS HTL is eliminated. Liu et al. fabricated polymer NIR PDs with the inverted architecture of ITO/ZnOx/PCPDTBT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag, where ZnOx and MoO3 serve as the ETL and HTL, respectively. By optimizing the morphology and thickness of the PCPDTBT:PCBM photoactive layer, the PD detectivity exceeds 1012 Jones over the wavelength range from 400 to 850 nm. Hu et al. employed an alcohol/water soluble and cross-linkable conjugated polymer named PFN-OX as the ETL to construct polymer NIR PDs with an inverted device structure. Operating at room temperature, the inverted polymer PDs with PFN-OX ETL exhibited a detectivity of 1.02 × 1013 Jones at 800 nm, which is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that (1.71 × 1012 Jones) of the PDs with ZnO ETL. Yang et al. adopted a vertically aligned ZnO nanowire (NW) array as the ETL and hole-blocking layer to fabricate inverted structure polymer PDs based on a PDDTT:PCBM bulk heterojunction (BHJ). A high-quality vertical ZnO NW array with the properties of wide bandgap and enhanced surface area is effective for extracting electrons and blocking holes from the active layer to the underneath electrode. As a result, the inverted PDs exhibit spectral response from UV to NIR (400–1500 nm), with detectivity greater than 1010 Jones at wavelengths from 400 to 1300 nm and greater than 109 Jones from 1300 to 1450 nm.

Wu et al. compared the device performance of the conventional and inverted structure polymer PDs based on a PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM BHJ. The PD with the inverted architecture (ITO/PFN/PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) exhibits a superior overall device performance as compared to the PD with the conventional architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM/PFN/Ag) because the Schottky barrier height (1.6 eV) for electron injection in the inverted device is substantially higher than that (1.0 eV) in the conventional device. Inspired by this finding, they improved the D* of the conventional structure NIR polymer photodiodes based on a PDPP3T:PC71BM BHJ to 2.2 × 1012 Jones at 800 nm, by using PVK to replace PEDOT:PSS as the HTL which results in a noticeable increase in the Schottky barrier height for electron injection under a reverse bias. Xiong et al. also demonstrated that inserting charge-blocking layers is an effective approach to suppress the reverse-biased dark current, and improve the detectivity of OPDs. They introduced a transfer-printed P3HT as the EBL between the photoactive layer and the top anode (MoO3/Ag) in the inverted structure polymer PDs. The insertion of the P3HT EBL substantially and universally reduced the reverse-biased dark current by about three orders of magnitude compared to the PDs without any EBL in a series of OPDs based on different active layers (i.e., P3HT:ICBA, PBDTTT-EFT:PCBM and PDPP3T:PCBM), which can be attributed to the efficient blocking of the electron injection from the anode when the reverse bias is applied.

Zhou et al. reported double-side responsive polymer NIR photodiodes employing transfer-printed conduction polymer (tp-CP) PEDOT:PSS as the top electrode to replace the vacuum-deposited metal electrode. The inverted structure polymer PDs with the tp-CP anode showed over two orders of magnitude decrease in reverse dark current at −0.2 V whereas the responsivity under illumination remained almost unchanged, when compared to the PDs with the MoO3/Ag anode. The higher reverse dark current of the OPDs using the metal electrode is ascribed to the diffusion of MoO3 into the active layer during the thermal deposition. In contrast, the transfer-printing is a non-invasive method for the active layer and provides a defect-free contact. Because the tp-CP electrode had similar transmittance (∼80%) in the spectral region of 400–1100 nm to that of the ITO electrode, the tp-CP based PDs can detect the light irradiated from both the ITO and the tp-CP sides. When light is incident from the side of the ITO bottom electrode, the D* of the PDs with the tp-CP anode reached 1.23 × 1013 Jones at 850 nm under −0.2 V bias, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that (2.96 × 1011 Jones) of the PDs with the MoO3/Ag anode.


To overcome the dark current problem, three main approaches have been explored: interfacial modification, morphology control and thickening the active layer. Liang et al. presented a novel molecular engineering method to prepare semiconducting polymers for PDs with suppressed dark current and enhanced detectivity. Modified 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was employed as a conjugated side chain to functionalize the backbone of the semiconducting polymers, which can significantly depress the dark current of the PDs but has little effect on the photocurrent under illumination. Thus, the detectivity could increase by more than one order of magnitude compared to the PDs with thiophene-modified polymer. The authors found that the introduction of the EDOT unit increases the interaction between the polymer and the PEDOT:PSS layer, affording favorable vertical phase separation with formation of a polymer-rich layer near the PEDOT:PSS surface and a PCBM-rich layer adjacent to the free (air) surface, which could account for the reduction of the dark current at reverse bias. Qi et al. developed a series of weak donor–strong acceptor polymers containing two different electron-deficient units (diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thienoisoindigo (TIIG)) and applied them in broadband NIR OPDs. By adjusting the composition ratio of the two acceptors of DPP and TIIG in copolymers, the ideal properties such as absorption profile, energy levels, and molecular stacking can be obtained, which lead to the broad spectral responsivity and low dark current of the PD. With increasing the percent of the TIIG component in the polymer, the highest D* of the PD decreased, while the response range increased. As a result, the PD based on P1 (i.e., without TIIG acceptor) exhibited the highest D* of 1.4 × 1013 Jones at 800 nm under −0.1 V bias, while the PD based on P5 (i.e., without DPP acceptor) showed the most broad response of 300–1200 nm. Han et al. reported broadband polymer NIR photodiodes with a D* in the order of 1012 Jones and photoresponsivity at the wavelengths from 300 to 1600 nm by using low-bandgap D–A polymers containing a novel donor unit dithienobenzotrithiophene (DTBTT). In comparison with their counterparts containing an analogous benzotrithiophene (BTT) unit, the DTBTT-containing polymers had higher hole mobility and better phase separation when blended with PCBM, which resulted in the higher EQE and lower dark current of the PDs.


Small molecules offer several advantages over polymeric materials in terms of their well-defined structures, definite molecular weights, easy synthesis and purification, good batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high charge carrier mobilities. These wonderful features make small molecules a promising class of donor materials for OSC and OPD applications.


Porphyrin-based small molecules are representative of an attractive class of materials as light harvesters in OPDs due to their tunable optical and electrical properties by incorporating different metals into the center of the ring or by grafting various substituents at their peripheral positions. In 2010, Forrest et al. demonstrated broadband small-molecule NIR PDs with a peak EQE of 6.5% and a D* of 2.3 × 1010 Jones at 1350 nm using Zn-metallated porphyrin-tape dimers with various terminal/lateral functional groups as the electron donor materials and thermally-evaporated C60 as the electron acceptor material. The PD performance was influenced by the functionalizing substituent molecule that, in turn, affects the film crystallinity and morphology. To further improve the detectivity of the small molecule PDs, PCBM and 4,4′-bipyridyl (Bipy) were added to the Zn–porphyrin-dimer solution as binary additives. The PCBM additive suppressed the dark current and the Bipy additive enhanced the EQE of the devices. As a result, the PDs with binary additives possessed a peak EQE of 10.5% and a D* of 8.2 × 1010 Jones at 1400 nm. Li et al. synthesized another porphyrin-based small molecule named DHTBTEZP and fabricated NIR OPDs with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DHTBTEZP:PCBM/PFN/Al. By optimizing the thickness of the photoactive layer, the small molecule PDs showed high detectivities over 1012 Jones in the spectral range from 380 to 930 nm.


PbPc is a shuttlecock-shaped molecule with a high absorption coefficient in the NIR region. Wang et al. reported small molecule NIR PDs based on a PbPc/C60 planar heterojunction (PHJ). The OPDs exhibited a D* of 2.34 × 1011 Jones at 900 nm under 0 V bias after employing CuI and Bphen as the HTL and ETL, respectively. Su et al. compared the device performance of the small-molecule NIR PDs using either a PbPc/C70 PHJ or a PbPc/PbPc:C70/C70 hybrid planar-mixed molecular heterojunction (PM-HJ) structure. The PHJ PDs showed high D* over 1012 Jones in the spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm. By comparison, the PM-HJ PDs possessed lower D* in the wavelength region of 400–700 nm due to the increased dark current, and higher D* in the NIR region of 800–950 nm owing to the improved absorption and exciton dissociation efficiency. The D* of the optimized PM-HJ device reached 4.2 × 1012 Jones at 890 nm under 0 V bias.


Compared to other organic systems, heptamethine salts have readily tunable properties via counterion or ligand exchange. In 2016, Young et al. synthesized a new series of heptamethine salts with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels that can be tuned by varying the anion electronegativity. FHJ small molecule NIR PDs were fabricated with the device architecture of ITO/MoO3/salt/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag, where the donor layers of each organic salt were prepared by the spin-coating technique. By exchanging the anion from tetrafluoroborate (BF4−) to tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TPFB−), the D* of the PD based on the salt cation 1 was improved by an order of magnitude from 3.7 × 109 to 5.3 × 1010 Jones, largely due to the lower noise current for devices with the TPFB anion. Lin et al. extended the photoresponse bandwidth of perovskite PDs by blending organic salts into hybrid perovskites to create a composite active layer. Such mixed salt-perovskite composites combined the best of both ingredients, with the small bandgap of the salts enabling collection of NIR photons and the perovskite crystals enhancing the charge transport in the active sensing layer. As a result, the 1BF4-perovskite based PDs (1BF4 represents the heptamethine salt with cation 1 and anion BF4−) possessed a substantial photoresponse from 500 to 1600 nm that exceeded the responsivity of the 1BF4-only device by an order of magnitude.


Visibly transparent PDs can have far-reaching impact in a number of areas including smart displays, window-integrated electronic circuits and sensors. Qi et al. synthesized two donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type low-bandgap (∼1.26 eV) small molecules, named as M1 and M2. These two compounds are visibly semitransparent, i.e., they have strong absorption in the UV and NIR regions, but weak absorption in the visible region. The small molecule NIR PDs based on M1:PCBM BHJ showed a broad response from 300 to 1000 nm and a high D* of 5.0 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm under −0.1 V bias after incorporating BCP as the hole-blocking layer. By reducing the thickness of the Ag electrode, the PDs became visibly semitransparent with an average 45% transmission in the visible range from 400 to 700 nm, and still performed well with the D* value being fairly constant between 1011 and 1012 Jones over the spectra range of 300–900 nm. Zhang et al. demonstrated a NIR sensitive, visibly transparent small molecule PD with a very high average visible transmittance of 68.9%. As shown in Fig. 6a, the transparent PD with an inverted architecture consists of a TiO2 ETL on ITO, a Cy7-T/poly-C60 FHJ, a MeO-TPD EBL and a semitransparent MoO3/Au top anode. Light absorption in the visible is small for all materials and the transmittance of the multilayer stack, excluding the top electrode, is above 90% between 530 and 640 nm (Fig. 6b). The additional 40 nm MoO3 deposited on the Au electrode was used to increase the device transmittance. As shown in Fig. 6c, the completed PD exhibited a very high and uniform measured transmittance over a large range of the visible spectrum, resulting in a greyish and color neutral appearance (Fig. 6d). The maximum EQE (at λ = 850 nm) of the transparent PD increased from 13% at 0 V bias to 23% at −2 V (Fig. 6e), while the D* monotonically decreased with increasing reverse bias from 3.0 × 1012 Jones at −0.1 V to 1.0 × 1012 Jones at −2 V (Fig. 6f), which indicates that the key to obtaining a high D* is a high EQE while keeping the dark current low.


Wavelength-selective light detection (i.e., accurately capturing the color of images) is crucial for many applications, including digital still cameras, industrial colorimetric measurements and machine vision. Unlike inorganic narrowband PDs in which a color separation system, such as a dichroic prism or set of optical filters, is typically required in front of the PDs, organic photodiodes can be designed with relatively narrow spectral responses of <200 nm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) due to the easily tunable absorption of organic semiconductors. In addition, the high extinction coefficient and low charge carrier mobility of organic materials benefit the suppression of optical and electrical crosstalk between neighboring pixels.

A number of creative strategies are emerging for organic semiconductor-based narrowband photodetection, including: (1) using truly narrowband absorbers in the photodiode active layer, coupled with a carefully designed optical cavity structure to tune optical field distribution within the device; (2) manipulating the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of organic photodiodes via charge collection narrowing (CCN); and (3) exploiting sub-gap intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) absorption. In the following sections, we will describe each of these strategies in detail.

The EQE(λ) of organic photodiodes, defined as the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected at an electrode to the number of incident photons, is the product of four efficiencies (η): absorption (ηA), exciton diffusion (ηED), charge separation (ηCS) and charge collection efficiencies (ηCC), viz.,
EQE(λ) = η(λ)Aη(λ)EDη(λ)CSη(λ)CC = η(λ)AIQE(λ)
where IQE(
λ) is the internal quantum efficiency defined as the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected to the number of photons absorbed in the photoactive layer. In a typical thin (∼100 nm) junction OPD, IQE(λ) is almost independent of excitation wavelength, and thus the EQE spectrum closely follows the spectral shape of the light absorption within the active layer. Therefore, the use of narrowband absorbing organic semiconductors is a straightforward and effective method to achieve a narrowband spectral response. Arca et al. reported a NIR-sensitive small molecule PD by employing a narrowband-absorbing squaraine derivative (DaSQ) as the electron donor and PCBM as the electron acceptor. The pure DaSQ film exhibited a narrowband NIR-selective absorption peak at ∼770 nm with a low FWHM value of <100 nm. However, the EQE spectra of DaSQ:PCBM based PDs were broadened with FWHM values greater than 200 nm under various reverse biases. Because almost all photoactive materials having NIR absorption inevitably absorb visible light, it is difficult to achieve visible-blind NIR OPDs only through the use of narrowband absorbs.


From the aforementioned EQE expression, it can be clearly understood that the EQE spectrum can be shaped by manipulating the IQE. In 2015, Armin et al. proposed a new concept, called charge collection narrowing (CCN), for achieving narrowband spectral responses in red and NIR photodiodes by using broadband-absorbing organic semiconductors. The working principle of the CCN concept is schematically described in Fig. 7a. The inset shows the device architecture of the CCN photodiodes, in which the photoactive layer is much thicker (e.g., 2 μm) than the inverse of its absorption coefficient (α, typically on the order of 105 cm−1 for organic semiconductor combinations), that is, it has a large optical density (αd ≫ 1). The principle is demonstrated for a hypothetical active layer with α (Fig. 7a) that has two distinctly different regimes: high α, where the incident light intensity falls off exponentially within the active layer (the Beer–Lambert regime), and low α, where the incident light penetrates through the active layer and the optical interference occurs between the incident light and the light reflected from the metal electrode (the cavity regime). In the Beer–Lambert regime, photogenerated carriers are produced in the vicinity of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS anode, which is termed ‘surface generation’. In the cavity regime, photogenerated carriers are produced through the active layer, including in the vicinity of the metal electrode, which is termed ‘volume generation’. Comparing these two cases, the surface-generated carriers will be subject to significant recombination losses due to the negative space charge accumulation near the anode originating from strongly imbalanced transit times for the electrons and holes. Thus, the ηCC is suppressed, resulting in a low (if not zero) EQE in the Beer–Lambert region. Recombination losses will be much lower for volume-generated carriers due to more balanced transport of the electrons and holes, and the EQE is maintained in the cavity regime. For wavelengths longer (photons lower in energy) than the optical gap of the active layer, α decreases to zero sharply and the photoresponse vanishes. Finally, the EQE spectrum is narrowed by imposing a strong wavelength dependence on the ηCC.

Based on the rationale outlined above, the authors demonstrated the first visible-blind sub-100 nm FWHM red and NIR PDs without the use of input filtering. As shown in Fig. 7b, PCDTBT:PC70BM and DPP-DTT:PC70BM broadband absorbers (2 μm thick), having absorption onsets at ∼650 and ∼950 nm, respectively, were used to construct the CCN OPDs. Both red and NIR CCN OPDs have FWHM < 90 nm. Because the use of a thick active layer deceased the defect density and thereby significantly suppressed the dark current, these CCN OPDs exhibited high D* of ∼1012 Jones under −1 V bias, as shown in Fig. 7c.

CT complexes are interfacial charge pairs residing at the donor/acceptor hetero-interface. CT states play an important role in OSCs and OPDs, as they mediate between photogenerated excitons in neat absorbers and fully dissociated (free) charges. The use of direct intermolecular CT absorption provides an elegant solution to achieve a NIR response without involving any low-bandgap material, because its absorption onset is determined by the energetic difference between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. However, owing to its intermolecular nature, CT absorption is typically two orders of magnitude weaker than singlet absorption of the neat absorbers, leaving it often undetected. To increase the CT absorption, Yang et al. used an ultrathick P3HT:PCBM blend of 14 μm thickness as the photoactive layer, and applied an extremely high reverse voltage of −200 V to promote charge extraction. The NIR PD covered a spectral range of 650–1000 nm and exhibited a high EQE of 60% at 750 nm. Nevertheless, the low on/off ratios and the high operating voltage of the PDs prevent them being used in practical applications.

Siegmund et al. introduced a resonant optical microcavity device which exploited the weak, but spectrally broadband CT absorption to achieve narrowband PD and tunable resonance wavelengths. The resonant cavity device architecture and a simplified energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 8a and b. A fully reflecting and a partially transmissive Ag mirror were utilized to form microcavities and simultaneously collect charges as electrodes. The thickness of both the ETL and HTL can be adjusted to achieve constructive interference in the CT absorption band and to situate the photoactive layer in the maximum of the optical field. Following this strategy, the authors achieved narrowband NIR PDs based on a ZnPc:C60 active layer, with a maximum EQE of 23% at a resonance wavelength of 875 nm and spectral widths down to 36 nm. By increasing the thickness of both transport layers from 60 to 105 nm, the resonance wavelength shifts from 875 to 1085 nm. To detect photons with lower energies, TPDP with an elevated HOMO level was employed as the electron donor to replace ZnPc. As a result, a remarkably broad resonance tunability from 810 to 1550 nm was demonstrated by simple thickness adjustments of both transport layers and the TPDP:C60 photoactive layer (Fig. 8c). To further enhance CT absorption and narrow the spectral width of the PD, the authors replaced the opaque Ag mirror by a highly reflective distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) combined with a thin (<25 nm) Ag electrode. The fabricated NIR single-resonance PDs based on the ZnPc:C60 system exhibited remarkable spectral line widths below 22 nm and an EQE of 17% at 880 nm. Tang et al. demonstrated wavelength-tunable NIR OPDs based on a PBTTT:PCBM system with CT absorption enhanced by the similar metal–metal resonant optical cavity (glass/Au (30 nm)/PEIE (1 nm)/PBTTT:PCBM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm)). By varying the thickness of the active layer from 115 to 190 nm, the first-order resonance wavelength was continuously tuned in the range between 700 to 1000 nm. The EQE of the PDs are indeed over 10% in this range, with FWHM < 50 nm. Considering that the use of noble metal thin films introduces a considerable amount of parasitic absorption, high-conductivity PEDOT:PSS coated DBRs were employed as the back reflecting electrode to replace Au. The DBR cavity devices with an architecture of glass/DBR/PEDOT:PSS (20 nm)/PEIE (1 nm)/PBTTT:PCBM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (30 nm) possessed a spectral line FWHM value as low as 14 nm and a D* close to 1013 Jones, which suggests that the performance of the cavity PDs approaches that of commercial broadband Si detectors.

Organic semiconductors have many intrinsic advantages, such as chemical tunability of optical and electronic properties by molecular design, thin film flexibility and ease of processing, which make them competitive alternatives to inorganic semiconductors for PD applications. Among various types of OPDs, organic photodiodes are one of the most promising types due to their low driving voltage and short response time. Benefiting from the rapid development of efficient low bandgap photovoltaic materials for OSCs, both panchromatic and narrowband organic NIR photodiodes have been realized. Currently, state-of-the-art broadband organic photodiodes can detect the spectra range from 300 to 1600 nm with specific detectivity greater than 1013 Jones and LDR larger than 100 dB. Achieving higher detectivity requires simultaneously enhancing the responsivity and suppressing the dark current, which relies on further optimizing the thickness and morphology of the photoactive layer as well as introducing efficient CTLs. With regard to realizing filterless, narrowband NIR photodetection with organic photodiodes, a number of creative strategies have been highlighted in this review: the use of narrowband absorbers, the manipulation of IQE via charge collection narrowing, and the introduction of a resonant optical microcavity structure to exploit intermolecular CT absorption. So far, a broad resonance tunability from 810 to 1550 nm, a remarkable spectral line FWHM below 20 nm and a high detectivity close to 1013 Jones have been demonstrated.

Although much effort has been put into the development of efficient low bandgap donor materials, fullerenes and their derivatives remain as the exclusive electron acceptor in almost all organic photodiodes. Given that fullerenes have some intrinsic disadvantages, such as high cost, weak absorption in the visible and NIR region, and difficulty in tuning the energy levels, it is necessary to develop novel non-fullerene acceptors with the properties of strong and broad absorption and fine-tuned energy levels. Besides, the use of ternary blend organic photodiodes with two donor materials and one fullerene acceptor is another effective strategy for extending the absorption range and thus achieving broadband photodetection. Recently, a growing number of non-fullerene and ternary OSCs have been reported, which can provide guidance for organic photodiodes. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that unlike OSCs, the dark current is a critical parameter for characterizing OPDs because it determines the noise current level and detectivity of an OPD. From a molecular design perspective, developing non-fullerene acceptors with a negligibly low intrinsic free carrier density is a potentially promising approach to lower the dark current, considering that the dimerization process of fullerenes may yield radicals and thereby produce free carriers. With respect to narrowband NIR PDs, parasitic absorption in metal electrodes causes a significant portion of optical losses even when combined with a DBR. To further improve device detectivity, it is desirable to adopt a highly conductive non-metal material as the electrode (e.g., highly conductive PEDOT:PSS, graphene). For the optical microcavity approach, a neat donor material filter sequence outside the cavity is always required to filter out the photoresponse in the visible range, which is detrimental to the device stability because organic materials are susceptible to chemical degradation from oxygen and water. Therefore, the protection of the filter layer is required for long-term devices. The stability of OPDs is an important and often overlooked aspect that needs to be addressed to make it a competitive PD technology.
