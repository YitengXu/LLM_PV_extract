Polymer donors with wide bandgaps and low energetic disorders are critical for fabricating high-performance indoor organic photovoltaic cells (IOPVs). Herein, a series of polymers (PB3, PB4 and PB5) based on thiadiazole (TDZ), 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) and fluorinated BDT-T (BDT-T-2F) units are designed and synthesized based on a random polymerization strategy. The terpolymers demonstrate wide optical bandgaps larger than 2.0 eV. Compared to the host polymer PB2, the terpolymers exhibit downshifted energy levels and enhanced crystallinities, which show much lower energetic disorders. After blending with a wide bandgap non-fullerene acceptor FTCC-Br, the optimized terpolymer shows a much faster charge transfer rate than PB2. Importantly, the OPV cell based on PB3:FTCC-Br achieves a high power conversion efficiency of over 15% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.06 V under one sun illumination. The PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell demonstrates a PCE of 14.79% with a high VOC of 1.09 V. It also should be noted that the PB3:BTP-eC9-based cell exhibits a PCE of 18.28%. Besides, the PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell with an effective area of 1.0 cm2 exhibits a PCE of over 31% under 2700 K illumination of 1000 lux. The results indicate that the ternary copolymerization strategy is an effective way to fine-tune the opto-electronic properties of highly efficient polymer donors for versatile photovoltaic applications.

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoTs), a large number of electronic devices with off-grid energy sources are required, which usually need to be driven at low electric power (1–100 µW) under indoor conditions. Under the illumination of indoor lights, such as fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have been proved to be able to output sufficient electric power to drive IOT electronic devices due to their highly tunable optical bandgaps (Egs) and molecular energy levels. Besides, an OPV cell has great advantages of light weight, low cost and flexibility. Therefore, an OPV cell is an ideal energy supply technology for IoT wireless electronic devices. Limited by photovoltaic material innovation, the power conversion efficiency of an indoor OPV (IOPV) cell has just reached ∼30%, which is still significantly lower than the theoretical efficiency (over 40%). Therefore, the development of well-matched active layer materials is still the primary task to improve the PCE of IOPV cells to date. Currently, high-performance medium bandgap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been designed and synthesized, such as FCC-Cl, GS-ISO, BTA3, ITCC, by reducing the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the central skeleton and electron-withdrawing end-group. However, the donor materials matching with these NFAs are very scarce. Therefore, more efforts are essential to develop wide bandgap polymer donors to fabricate high-performance IOPV cells.

Some requirements should be considered in designing high-performance polymer donors. (I) They should have wide bandgaps and appropriate molecular energy levels. To achieve high-performance IOPV cells, a fundamental feature is that the absorption spectra of the BHJ layers cover the emission spectra (450–730 nm) of the indoor artificial light sources. Currently, state-of-the-art NFAs usually have the maximum absorption wavelengths at 680–700 nm and absorption edges at 730–760 nm with the Egs at 1.70–1.65 eV, considering that the peak widths at half-height (FWHMs) of organic semiconductors are generally 80–120 nm. Therefore, in order to realize the coverage of the absorption spectrum of the BHJ material at 450–730 nm, it is necessary to develop polymer donors with an Egs over 2.0 eV. In addition, they should have appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels matching the wide bandgap NFAs, so as to reduce the VOC losses on the premise of efficient charge separation. (II) The polymer donors used for IOPVs should have low energetic disorders. Under dim light, the density of the photogenerated charge carrier is very low. However, as a direct consequence of van der Waals intermolecular interactions inherent in organic materials, charge carrier trapping is ubiquitous in OPV cells. Therefore, the relative quantity of charge carriers annihilated by the trap states will increase with the decrease of illumination intensity. It has been shown that the trap state is closely related to molecular energetic disorder. Thus, molecular energetic disorder should be minimized when exploring high-performance polymer donors, so as to meet the applications of OPV cells under dim lights. (III) The high-performance polymer donors should possess strong pre-aggregation effects in solution states and appropriate phase separation effects with acceptors in solid states. The excellent pre-aggregation properties of polymer donors in solution are important to obtain favorable BHJ morphology with an electron acceptor, which is the key to achieve highly efficient charge transport and reduce charge recombination. Besides, weakly aggregated polymers are prone to produce indistinguishable phase separation morphology with an electron acceptor, resulting in extremely low short-circuit current densities (JSCs) and fill factors (FFs) of the resulting OPV cells, while strongly aggregated polymers could form large domain sizes, leading to low JSCs in the given OPV cells. Therefore, appropriate molecular design methods should be used to fine-tune the molecular aggregation behaviors.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of random terpolymers (named PB3, PB4 and PB5) by copolymerizing 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T), fluorinated BDT-T (BDT-T-2F) and 1,3,4-thiadizole (TDZ) units randomly with thiophene units. By systematically varying the composition of the BDT-T and BDT-T-2F units in the polymer backbones, it is possible to fine-tune the molecular packing and electrical properties. The obtained polymers demonstrate large Egs over 2.0 eV and obvious solution aggregation effects. The experimental results demonstrate that the BDT-T-2F unit can reduce the energetic disorder without changing the absorption spectrum and molecular configuration. Finally, based on PB3:FTCC-Br, a high-performance OPV cell with a PCE of over 15% is obtained. The PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell demonstrates a PCE of 14.79% with a high VOC of 1.09 V. Importantly, the IOPV cell based on PB4:FTCC-Br demonstrates an outstanding PCE of 31.09% (1000 lux).

The chemical structures of the polymers are shown in Fig. 1a. The detailed synthetic procedures of the terpolymers are exhibited in Fig. S1. The terpolymers are synthesized by copolymerizing the monomers of BDT-T, BDT-T-2F and TDZ with two flanked alkylated thiophene units. The different molar feed ratios of BDT-T/BDT-T-2F for PB3, PB4 and PB5 are 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is performed to determine the number-average molecular weights and polydispersity indices (PDI) of the polymer donors. The detailed results are shown in the ESI. These polymers have similar values of n and PDI. Besides, density functional theory (DFT) at the B3YLP/6-31G (d, p) level is used to calculate the stable molecular geometries, energy levels and electrostatic potential (ESP) distributions of the representative polymers of PB2, PB4 and PB2F. The long side-chains are replaced by methyl groups to reduce computational costs. As shown in Fig. S2a, the molecules of PB2, PB4 and PB2F have very good planarity, which is beneficial to the formation of ordered molecular packing. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of PB2, PB4 and PB2F are shown in Fig. S2b, which are −2.47/−4.89 (LUMO/HOMO), −2.54/−4.94 and −2.60/−5.03 eV, respectively. The introduction of a BDT-T-2F unit can effectively lower the energy levels, which is conducive to preparing OPV cells with high VOCs. The ESP distributions on the conjugated backbones of PB2, PB4 and PB2F are shown in Fig. 1b. The averaged ESP values of the atoms on the conjugated backbones and the surface area distributions with different ESP values of PB2, PB4 and PB2F are shown in Fig. S3. The ESP values of the three molecules are relatively negative, indicating that they have strong electron donating properties. Specifically, the overall average ESP values of PB2, PB4 and PB2F are −66.22, −49.88, and −16.34 meV, respectively. From the perspective of ESP, PB2 may have the strongest molecular interaction with the acceptor. Compared with PB2, the molecular interaction between PB2F and the acceptor should be obviously reduced, which may result in strong self-aggregations. Therefore, introducing an appropriate amount of BDT-T-2F into PB2 can balance the molecular interactions between the donor and acceptor molecules, which is beneficial to the formation of phase separation with proper domain sizes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is further used to measure the energy levels of the polymers. The CV curves and the corresponding calculated LUMO and HOMO levels are shown in Fig. S4 and 1c. The LUMO/HOMO levels of PB2, PB4 and PB2F are −3.44/−5.50, −3.48/−5.55 and −3.53/−5.65 eV, respectively. The experimental results are consistent with those of the DFT calculations. The solution aggregation effect is widely employed to evaluate the aggregation properties of polymers. Here, temperature-dependent absorption measurement is further used to investigate the solution aggregation effects of these polymers. As shown in Fig. 1d and S5, these polymers show strong aggregation effects in solution states, which can be attributed to the stable conjugated molecular backbones. Besides, at room temperature, the absorption spectra of these polymers in solution states are mainly at 350 to 600 nm, with two main absorption peaks centered at 520 and 550 nm, while in the solid states, the absorption spectra of the polymers show red shifts of about 10 nm (Fig. 1e and S5f), which is attributed to the molecular aggregations in the solid states. In addition, these polymers exhibit Egs larger than 2.0 eV, which have very matching absorption spectra with the widely used NFAs with medium-wide or narrow bandgaps. According to the above discussions, the introduction of BDT-T-2F obviously influences the molecular packing properties. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement is further used to investigate the molecular packing behaviors. The 2D GIWAXS diffraction patterns and line-cut profiles of the neat films are shown in Fig. S6. The polymers exhibit obviously face-on predominant molecular packing orientations relative to the substrates with obvious (010) diffraction peaks at ≈1.73 Å−1 with a π–π distance of about 3.63 Å in the out of plane (OOP) directions. Furthermore, the coherence length (CL) of PB2 is 20.26 Å, which is smaller than that of PB-2F (24.15 Å). Compared to PB2, PB3 and PB4 show larger CLs of 22.43 and 23.26 Å, respectively. The improvements of CLs are owing to the enhanced intermolecular interactions. However, the quality of the PB5-based film processed by the used solvent is very poor, thus showing a relatively weak crystallinity (CL = 18.47 Å). Energetic disorder, which is closely related to the molecular packing properties, has been recognized as one of the critical issues that determines the performance of OPV materials. Herein, the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) (eqn (1)) is used to evaluate the energetic disorders of PB2, PB4 and PB2F.w

µ∞ is the charge mobility at infinite temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and σ is the energetic disorder. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the hole-only devices based on the neat films at different temperatures are shown in Fig. S7. The curves of zero-field mobilities of an electron as a function of 1/T2 are shown in Fig. 1f and S7f. The values of energetic disorders of these polymers are listed in Table 1. PB2F shows much lower energetic disorder with a value of 45 meV compared to PB2 (63 meV), and the main reason is that the introduction of fluorine atoms onto conjugated polymers could enhance intermolecular interaction and improve their crystallinity. Interestingly, the energetic disorders of terpolymers can be reduced to 58 meV for PB3 and 53 meV for PB4 by properly increasing the amount of BDT-T-2F in the terpolymer, while the ratio of BDT-2F of terpolymer reaches one half, PB5 shows an increased energetic disorder (69 meV). These results show that the crystallinity of these polymers decreases in the order of PB2F, PB4, PB3, PB2 and PB5, which is consistent with the results observed in GIWAXS measurements.

OPV cells with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/PDINN/Ag are fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of these polymers (Fig. S8a). A wide bandgap small molecule named FTCC-Br is used as the acceptor. The chemical structure and normalized absorption spectrum of FTCC-Br are shown in Fig. S8b and c. The absorption spectra of the blend films based on polymers:FTCC-Br are shown in Fig. 2a. The J–V curves and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 2b, S8d and Table 1, respectively. Under standard 1-sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the PB2-based cell exhibits a PCE of 14.46% with a VOC of 1.05 V, a JSC of 17.66 mA cm−2 and an FF of 77.91%, respectively. The PB2F-based cell demonstrates a high VOC of 1.19 V. However, due to insufficient charge separation driving force, the JSC and FF of the PB2F-based cell are relatively low, and are 14.55 mA cm−2 and 65.17%, respectively. As we expected to obtain the low-lying energy levels of BDT-T-2F containing polymers, terpolymer-based cells obtained higher VOCs than the PB2-based cell. Both PB3- and PB4- based OPV cells demonstrate high device performance. Among them, PB3-based cell shows a PCE over 15% (VOC = 1.06 V, JSC = 17.95 mA cm−2, and FF = 79.07%), which is the highest value of OPV cells with an g larger than 1.67 eV. These high-performance cells with large Egs can be used to prepare efficient IOPV cells, which will be discussed in detail below. However, the JSC and FF values are simultaneously reduced in the PB5-based cell, which is attributed to the poor morphology of the PB5-based blend film. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OPV cells are shown in Fig. 2c and S8e. All the EQE spectra cover spectral response ranges from 300 to 750 nm. The EQE values of the PB2-, PB3- and PB4-based cells exceed 80% in the range of 500–700 nm. Meanwhile, the JSC values obtained by integrating the EQE spectra are well consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurements. It should be noted that there is a slight difference between the band edges of the absorption spectra and the EQE curves, which may be due to the different substrates, film thicknesses or the reflected light of electrodes. Furthermore, we also select BTP-eC9 as the acceptor to prepare OPV cells with narrow Egs to show the universality of ternary polymers. The J–V curves and corresponding EQE spectra of the polymers:BTP-eC9-based OPV cells are shown in Fig. S9. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1. The PB2:BTP-eC9-based cell exhibits a PCE of 17.61%, with a VOC of 0.861 V, a JSC of 26.15 mA cm−2, and an FF of 78.21%, which is similar to the results of our previous report. The PB3:BTP-eC9-based cell offers a maximum PCE of 18.28% with a VOC of 0.867 V, a JSC of 26.26 mA cm−2 and an FF of 80.32%. The PB4:BTP-eC9- and PB2F:BTP-eC9-based cells show relatively lower PCEs of 16.97 and 4.79%, respectively, which is also due to the insufficient exciton separation driving force. The JSC values calculated by integrating the EQE spectra agree well with the values obtained from the J–V measurements. PB2:FTCC-Br-, PB4:FTCC-Br- and PB2F:FTCC-Br-based cells are selected to further study the differences of charge generation, transport and the charge recombination properties between the terpolymer-based cells and host polymer-based cells. First, photoinduced charge-carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurement is conducted to get the mobilities of the faster charge carrier in the real working OPV cells. As shown in Fig. 2d, the calculated charge mobilities of the PB2-, PB4-, and PB2F-based cells are 3.08 × 10−4, 3.51 × 10−4 and 5.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher charge mobilities in the PB4-based cell than that of the PB2-based cell may be attributed to the smaller energetic disorder. The energy loss (Eloss) of the OPV cells is investigated by using the highly sensitive EQE (HEQE) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements. The spectra and corresponding Eloss parameters are shown in Fig. 2e, S10 and Table S2. The Egs of PB2-, PB4-, and PB2F-based cells are 1.76, 1.76 and 1.75 eV, respectively. Besides, the energy of the charge transfer state can be obtained fitting the reduced spectra of both HEQE and EL, which are 1.72, 1.73, and 1.74 eV for PB2-, PB4-, and PB2F-based systems. The results suggest that the voltage losses in these systems caused by charge separation are negligible. Besides, as shown in Fig. 2f, the PB2:FTCC-Br-based cell exhibits a EQEEL of ≈1.1 × 10−5, which corresponded to a non-radiative voltage loss  of as low as 0.30 eV. The PB2F:FTCC-Br-based cell shows a relatively high EQEEL of ≈4.2 × 10−3 and the  is 0.14 eV. In comparison, the PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell exhibits a moderate EQEEL and  of ≈1.5 × 10−4 and 0.23 eV, respectively. The results indicate that the decreased  is a key factor that explains the higher VOC of the PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell. Here, compared with the PB2-based cell, the reduction of  of terpolymers PB3- and PB4-based cells can reasonably be attributed to the reduction of energetic disorders.


Transient absorption spectroscopy is employed to investigate the charge and recombination processes. An excitation wavelength of 430 nm is used to excite both the polymers and acceptors. The 2D TA images of the neat films and the corresponding TA spectra at various decay times are shown in Fig. S11. The ground state bleaching (GSB) signals of the donors and acceptor are mainly in the range of 450–600 and 550–750 nm, respectively. The 2D TA images of the blend films and the corresponding TA spectra are shown in Fig. 3a, b and S12. According to the TA images of neat films, the two obvious absorption peaks between 500 and 600 nm can be attributed to the GSB signals of the donors. Here, the GSB signals at 520 nm are probed to investigate the electron transfer processes. The corresponding decay profiles are shown in Fig. 3c. The short exciton lifetimes of the blend films of PB2:FTCC-Br, PB4:FTCC-Br and PB2F:FTCC-Br are 108.0, 12.1 and 0.7 ps, respectively. The results indicate that the introduction of a BDT-T-2F unit greatly promotes the electron transfer rate. Besides, the main absorption peaks for the polymers and FTCC-Br are well separated. Therefore, a 750 nm excitation wavelength is used to only excite the acceptor to study the hole transfer process. The 2D TA images of the neat films and the corresponding TA spectra at various delay times are shown in Fig. 3d, e and S12. Obvious GSB signals of the acceptors are exhibited in the range from 600 to 700 nm. With the decay of the GSB signal of FTCC-Br at 620 nm, obvious signals at 520 nm are exhibited (Fig. 3g). These peaks around 520 nm match well with the GSB signals of polymers. Therefore, the GSB signals at 520 nm are attributed to the hole transfer from FTCC-Br to polymers. By extracting the decay profiles at 520 nm (Fig. 3f), we can see that a PB2F-based system has the fastest hole transfer with a lifetime of 0.37 ps. The hole transfer rate of the PB4-based system is 0.68 ps, which is much faster than that of the PB2-based system (1.31 ps), which means the introduction of BDT-T-2F can also accelerate the hole transfer rate. The results show that the introduction of BDT-T-2F can significantly enhance the charge transfer rates, which is beneficial in reducing charge recombination.


Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and GIWAXS are further used to investigate the morphological properties of the blend films to understand the high performance achieved in the terpolymer-based OPV cells. The AFM height images of the PB2-, PB4- and PB2F-based films are shown in Fig. 4a–c. The PB2:FTCC-Br-based film exhibits a slightly rough surface with a root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 2.17 nm, while the PB4:FTCC-Br- and PB2F:FTCC-Br-based films show relatively smoother surfaces with Rq values of 1.91 and 1.27 nm, respectively. The corresponding AFM phase images are shown in Fig. 4d–f. The PB2:FTCC-Br-based film shows obvious different AFM phase images with PB4:FTCC-Br- and PB2F:FTCC-Br-based films. Irregular aggregates can be seen on the PB2:FTCC-Br-based film. However, aggregates with uniform shapes and sizes are exhibited on the PB4:FTCC-Br- and PB2F:FTCC-Br-based films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and line cut profiles in the OOP and in plane (IP) directions of the blend films and FTCC neat film are shown in Fig. 4g–j and S13. For the PB2:FTCC-Br-based blend film, the (010) peak is located at 1.75 Å−1 and the corresponding d-spacing and CL values are 3.59 and 18.47 Å, respectively. For the blend films based on PB4:FTCC-Br and PB2F:FTCC-Br, the (010) peaks are located at 1.76 and 1.77 Å−1, corresponding to the d-spacing/CL values of 3.57/19.63 and 3.55/20.93 Å, respectively. Compared with the PB2-based blend system, the optimized nanomorphology in terpolymer-based blend systems are beneficial for charge transport and collection.


Based on the above discussions, the PB3:FTCC-Br- and PB4:FTCC-Br-based systems possess relatively high PCE and VOC values, which demonstrate great potentials in the preparation of high-performance IOPV cells. Herein, PB3:FTCC-Br- and PB4:FTCC-Br-based cells with an effective area of 1.0 cm2 for indoor applications are fabricated. A 2700 K LED is used as the light source. The emission spectra and the corresponding emission power densities are shown in Fig. 5a. The J–V curves of the PB3:FTCC-Br- and PB4:FTCC-Br-based indoor OPV cells are shown in Fig. 5b and S14a, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Tables 2 and S3, respectively. Under indoor illumination, the PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell shows higher performance than the PB3:FTCC-Br-based cell, which is because the PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell not only has a higher VOC, but also has an EQE spectrum that is more matched with the emission spectrum of the 2700 K LED. For the PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell, the maximum output power densities (MPDs) of the indoor OPV cell under 200 and 500 lux are 17.00 and 46.15 µW cm−2, respectively. The corresponding PCEs are 28.24% and 29.56%, respectively. Under 1000 lux illumination, a high MPD of 95.05 µW cm−2 is obtained. The corresponding PCE is 31.09%, with a VOC of 0.967 V, a JSC of 119.87 µA cm−2 and an FF of 82.00%. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest among that of IOPV cells under illuminations below 1000 lux (Table S4). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 5c, the current densities integrated from the EQE spectra are consistent with the results achieved from the J–V measurements, which also confirms the reliability of the indoor photovoltaic measurements. In addition, the PB4:FTCC-Br-based IOPV with an area of 10.0 cm2 is also fabricated spin-coating. The J–V curves and corresponding device parameters are exhibited in Fig. 5d and Table S5. Under 1000 lux illumination, the 10.0 cm2 cell shows an MPD of 87.59 µW cm−2 and a PCE of 28.65%, with a VOC of 0.953 V, a JSC of 115.21 µA cm−2 and an FF of 79.78%. The corresponding EQE mapping with 500 nm excitation and photograph of the 10.0 cm2 cell are shown in Fig. 5e and f, respectively. Clearly, the cell shows evenly distributed high EQE values in the whole active area. The results suggest that the PB4-based cell can meet the requirement for large area IOPV cells. Additionally, these polymers exhibit wide bandgaps and variable molecular energy levels, and could be interesting as dopant-free hole transport materials for high-performance perovskite solar cells.

In conclusion, high-performance terpolymers PB3 and PB4 with wide bandgaps and low HOMO energy levels are synthesized introducing a BDT-T-2F unit into the polymer PB2. These terpolymers have planar molecular conformations. Compared to PB2, the terpolymers of PB3 and PB4 exhibit superior optoelectronic and molecular packing properties. Therefore, the optimized terpolymers demonstrate relatively low energetic disorders and high charge mobilities. The OPV cell based on PB3:FTCC-Br shows a relatively high PCE over 15%, which is the highest value among that of the OPV cells with an g over 1.67 eV. The binary cell based on PB3:BTP-eC9 exhibits a PCE of 18.28%. The PB4:FTCC-Br-based cell also shows a high PCE of 14.79% with a high VOC of 1.09 V. Furthermore, the 1.0 cm2 IOPV cell based on PB4:FTCC-Br demonstrates an outstanding PCE of 31.09% under 1000 lux. Overall, the results provide guidance for further improving the state-of-the-art high-performance wide bandgap polymers for IOPV applications.
