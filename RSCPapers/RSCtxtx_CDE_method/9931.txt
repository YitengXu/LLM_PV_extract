Hydrothermal deposition is an ideal method to fabricate high-efficiency antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells due to its simple, eco-friendly and low-cost processing characteristics. This deposition approach has enabled efficiency breakthrough in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, while the chemical mechanisms in the deposition and annealing processes remain undiscovered. Here, we reveal that the deposition and annealing of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 are essentially driven by antimony polysulfoselenide (Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 (x + y > 1)) and antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) amorphous nanocrystals. On the grounds of elemental, thermogravimetric and defect analyses, we identify a new intermediate phase composed of Sb2(Sx,Sey)3. The formation of Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 and the consequent mass loss during the post-annealing process are found to produce poor microstructural performance in the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer (i.e., pinholes), which leads to the disruption of internal orderliness. Encouragingly, we found that the introduction of a zeolite can effectively improve the compactness of the Sb2(S0.55,Se0.45)3 film by altering the pH of the hydrothermal solution, which in turn leads to a power conversion efficiency of 8.87%, which shows a promising improvement of more than 21.8% compared with the traditional preparation method. This study offers fundamental insights into the hydrothermal deposition-derived Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, and provides a simple and effective method for improving the device performance.

Antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells are promising low-cost and eco-friendly alternatives to Si, Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CdTe and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells due to their quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure (i.e., (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons), simple chemical components, single phase and excellent stability properties. Inspired by the preparation of solution-processed Cu(In,Ga)Se2, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (ref. 25–29) and other metal sulfoselenide solar cells, metal sulfoselenide precursor solution (MSPS) approaches have been adopted to prepare Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. However, these methods can only achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of less than 7%. MSPS approaches, especially those containing organic sulfoselenide groups, such as –SH, –NH–CS2H and –NH–SeH, often inevitably undergo a fast S/Se loss in the annealing process, raising a critical challenge to improve the device performance of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

Recently, we have shown that the hydrothermal deposition approach is able to improve the PCE of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Subsequently, it was found that the introduction of either organic or inorganic additives such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and CdCl2 (ref. 38) in the deposition solution is capable of regulating the nucleation and deposition process, resulting in enhanced grain size, favorable [hkl] crystal orientation and improved electrical conductivity of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layers. In addition, post-treatment with alkali metal fluorides was able to improve the quality of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layers and manipulate the composition gradient. However, all of these studies are based on the atomic ratio of Se/(S + Se) being at about 29%. When the ratio of Se/(S + Se) increases (i.e., 48%), the device performance decreases sharply. Under extreme conditions, the hydrothermal deposition derived pure selenide Sb2Se3 generated a PCE of only 7.9%. The poor morphology and appearance of pinholes at high Se/(S + Se) atomic ratios are believed to degrade the device performance, by seriously disrupting the orderly arrangement of (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons and inducing carrier recombination. These characteristics limited the fabrication of high-efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells with high Se/(S + Se) ratios.
In the hydrothermal synthesis method, deposition and post-annealing processes are critical steps to fabricate a high-quality Sb2(S,Se)3 film. Typically, K2Sb2(C4H2O6)2, Na2S2O3, (H2N)2CSe and H2O are used as the raw materials for the synthesis of Sb2(S,Se)3. Amorphous Sb2S3, Sb2Se3 and Sb2(Sa,Seb)3 (a + b = 1) with different S/Se ratios can be produced by using the following reactions:
K2Sb2(C4H2O6)2 + 3Na2S2O3 + 3H2O = 3Na2SO4 + K2C4H4O6 + C4H6O6 + Sb2S3↓
(1)
K2Sb2(C4H2O6)2 + 3(H2N)2CSe + 3H2O = K2C4H4O6 + C4H6O6 + 3(H2N)2CO + Sb2Se3↓
(2)
aSb2S3 + bSb2Se3 = Sb2(Sa,Seb)3
(3)
Although these chemical reaction equations seem reasonable, they ignore possible side reactions in hydrothermal deposition. We find that when Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 are produced, tartaric acid (C4H6O6) is produced in the same amount. The improved H+ concentration and the by-products of selenourea decomposition will complicate the composition of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film, thereby affecting the annealing process. Thus, a profound understanding about the deposition and annealing mechanisms of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 is required, and a simple and cost-effective optimizing strategy is expected.
In this study, we explore the deposition and annealing mechanisms of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 for obtaining a benign-microstructure-performance Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer with an ordered crystal structure, uniform morphology, and low trap density. We find that the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film is composed of amorphous Sb2(S,Se)3 and antimony polysulfoselenide (Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 (x + y > 1)), and the annealing is a desired in situ sulfuration/selenization process. These new discoveries can successfully explain why hydrothermal deposition is superior to other preparation methods, and also provide a reasonable explanation for the formation of pinholes in the Sb2(S,Se)3 grains. Based on these new findings, we rationally chose a zeolite as an additive that can successfully improve the compactness and slightly increase the Se content of the as-prepared film, thereby significantly suppressing the formation of pinholes and enhancing the device performance. Our findings reveal the deposition and annealing mechanisms of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3, explain how the zeolite avoids the formation of pinholes traditionally observed in the absorber layer, and provide hope that hydrothermal deposition might have beneficial effects on other metal sulfoselenide thin film technologies, too.

In the hydrothermal deposition, we applied K2Sb2(C4H2O6)2, Na2S2O3 and (H2N)2CSe as the Sb, S and Se precursors, and H2O was employed as the solvent. The precursor materials are well-dissolved in H2O to form an orange homogeneous solution. The pH value of the mixed solution (Fig. 1a) was measured as 4.6. Afterwards, we conducted the hydrothermal deposition at 135 °C for 80 min, and then obtained a smooth as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film. Besides, we found that the pH value of the remaining solution changed to 3.6 (Fig. 1b). The increased acidity should be due to the formation of tartaric acid (C4H6O6) via the reaction between K2Sb2(C4H2O6)2 and Na2S2O3, (H2N)2CSe as shown in eqn (1) and (2).

At room temperature, the colorless and transparent C4H6O6 solution with a pH value of 3.6 becomes turbid after adding solid Na2S2O3 (Fig. 1c), demonstrating the formation of elemental S. Besides, according to eqn (1), the reaction between 0.2 mmol of C4H6O6, 0.2 mmol of Na2S2O3 and 40 mL of H2O was carried out under the same conditions as for hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3. We found that the product presents the typical peaks of elemental S as characterized by Raman scattering (Fig. S1). In addition, we conducted a control experiment by dissolving selenourea in H2O, and the same hydrothermal conditions lead to the decomposition of selenourea to form elemental Se (Fig. S1 and S2a). Besides, S2O32− will decompose into S2− and SO4. We characterized the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film, and there were no element S and Se identified according to the Raman results (Fig. S1). Therefore, we propose that there exists a reaction between S, Se, Se2− and S2− to form polysulfoselenide anions (SxSey2−) during the hydrothermal process. Further, S2−, Se2− and SxSey2− react with Sb3+ to form antimony sulfoselenide (Sb2(S,Se)3) and antimony polysulfoselenide (Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 (x + y > 1)). Therefore, the as-prepared precursor film contains not only amorphous Sb2(S,Se)3, but also decomposable Sb2(Sx,Sey)3. The related reaction processes about Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 can be expressed by eqn (4):
2Sb3+ + 3SxSey2− = Sb2(Sx,Sey)3↓
(4)
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 powder shows that the sample has an obvious weight loss of 8.05% between 200 and 450 °C (Fig. 1d). Because the Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 mixture has almost no weight loss in the same temperature range (Fig. S3), the weight loss should be attributed to the decomposition of the Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 in the products. To identify the components of weight loss, we placed 150 mg of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 powder on a hot plate at 350 °C for 10 min, and used an inverted funnel to collect the volatile products (Fig. 1e). A large amount of yellow and orange-red powder slowly and consistently deposited on the funnel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping characterization demonstrate that the volatile products are elemental sulfur and selenium (Fig. 1f). Note that the SEM samples are glass fragments randomly picked from the broken funnel. It is only applied to confirm that S and Se escape from the sample, and not to accurately describe the quality or ratio of S and Se. This indicates that the annealing process is not only a simple heating process to promote grain growth, but also brings a desired in situ sulfuration/selenization that was previously unidentified.
We then analyzed the chemical compositions of the as-prepared and annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 films using EDS (Table S1). The atomic ratio of (S + Se):Sb in the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film is calculated to be 1.59:1, indicating that the composition of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film is anion-rich. After annealing at 350 °C for 10 min, however, the (S + Se):Sb becomes 1.39:1, which can be attributed to the loss of S and Se during the annealing process. This is consistent with the TGA analysis and the annealing experiment phenomenon (Fig. 1d and e). The related decomposition reaction of Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 (x + y > 1) can be expressed by eqn (5):
Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 = Sb2(Sa,Seb)3 + (3x − 3a)S + (3y − 3b)Se
(5)
where the sum of
a and b is 1, and Sb2(Sa,Seb)3 represents Sb2(S,Se)3 with different S/Se ratios.

Furthermore, we performed deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) analysis on the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 device. The Arrhenius plot of the device is shown in Fig. 1g. The defect state, energy level (ET), cross-section (σ), and defect density (NT) of the detected defects in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells were calculated and are summarized in Table S2. There are two types of electronic traps (denoted as E1 and E2). This demonstrates that the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film has a large number of SbS/Se defects. These results show that antimony sulfoselenide and antimony polysulfoselenide, instead of antimony sulfoselenide, are the main components of the as-prepared hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 film.
These experimental results provide important support for explaining the deposition and annealing mechanisms of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3. In the hydrothermal reaction, Na2S2O3, (H2N)2CSe, K2Sb2(C4H2O6)2 and H2O react to form Sb2(S,Se)3 (eqn (1)–(3)). Subsequently, the pH value of the solution decreases. The elemental S formed by the reaction of Na2S2O3 with H+, the elemental Se obtained by the decomposition of (H2N)2CSe, and the S2− generated by the decomposition of Na2S2O3, (H2N)2CSe and Sb3+ will react to yield Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 (Fig. 2a and eqn (4)). When the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film is annealed at 350 °C, which is commonly used in high-efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, the Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 will be slowly decomposed into S, Se and Sb2(S,Se)3 (Fig. 2b). Because the melting points of S and Se are lower than 250 °C, they will become volatile liquids at 350 °C, giving rise to a desired in situ sulfuration/selenization process due to the slow decomposition rate of Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 at 350 °C. The traditionally explored sulfuration and selenization processes, using S, H2S, Se or H2Se as the S/Se source, exhibit a S/Se gradient diffusion process, that is, the concentration of S/Se vapor in the absorber layer is much lower than that of the environment. We hypothesized that sulfuration/selenization possessing an in situ reaction, such as the annealing of metal polysulfoselenide at an appropriate temperature, could offer a locally high concentration of the S/Se steam atmosphere in the absorber layer. In the hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3, for example, antimony polysulfoselenide (Sb2(Sx,Sey)3) is present in the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film, whereas in the annealing process at 350 °C, the slow Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 decomposition process can produce an ideal in situ sulfuration/selenization. Rarely have these materials been explored for photovoltaics because of the difficulties in the fabrication of the as-prepared metal polysulfoselenide films using MSPS approaches. Furthermore, S and Se leave the as-prepared film, resulting in volume shrinkage. Such a volume shrinkage may create a large number of pinholes in the absorber layer (Fig. 2c). Because the crystal structure of Sb2(S,Se)3 is composed of one-dimensional (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons, pinholes will severely damage charge transfer, thereby decreasing the device performance of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Hence, a simple and effective method to reduce these pinholes is highly expected.
Motivated by the above analysis, if we can increase the pH value of the hydrothermal reaction solution, the formation of pinholes caused by the rapid volatilization of S and Se can be significantly suppressed. The addition of conventionally applied bases, such as NaOH, KOH and NH3·H2O, would introduce additional impurities and make the hydrothermal deposition reaction more complicated due to the sensitivity of Na2S2O3 to pH value. In this case, we applied a porous zeolite to tune the pH value of the solution since it can selectively adsorb cations such as H+. After introducing three zeolite particles (about 5 mm in diameter), the pH value of the hydrothermal precursor solution is measured to be 4.9 (Fig. 3a), while the pH of the solution in the absence of the zeolite is 4.6 (Fig. 1a). After the hydrothermal reaction, the pH value becomes 3.9 (Fig. 3b), compared to the pH value of 3.6 without the zeolite (Fig. 1b). This change in pH generates an obvious effect on the reaction of the decomposition of Na2S2O3 to form elemental S (Fig. 3c). It is noted that the C4H4O6 solution with Na2S2O3 at a pH of 3.9 (Fig. 3c) is much clearer than that at a pH of 3.6 (Fig. 1c). This observation indicates that the zeolite additive can effectively inhibit the formation of elemental S.
The TGA result demonstrates that the weight loss is 10.1% between 200 and 450 °C (Fig. 3d), which is slightly higher than that of the sample prepared in the absence of the zeolite (8.05%). After adding the zeolite, the amount of elemental S decreased, but the weight loss increased. In order to explore the reasons for the increase in weight loss, we used only elemental S, selenourea and water in the hydrothermal reaction, and found that almost no elemental Se was formed (Fig. S2b). This shows that the presence of elemental S can inhibit the decomposition of selenourea to form elemental Se. When the zeolite is added into the hydrothermal reaction system, the elemental S becomes less, and the elemental Se produced by the decomposition of selenourea becomes more, so the weight loss in the TGA analysis is increased. Similarly, the annealing of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 powder (Fig. 3e), SEM image and EDS-mapping results (Fig. 3f) reveal that annealing is essentially an in situ sulfuration/selenization process. Table S3 shows the chemical compositions of the as-prepared and annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 films with the zeolite additive. The composition of Sb2(S,Se)3 changes from being anion-rich ((S + Se):Sb = 1.64:1) before annealing to a nearly stoichiometric ratio ((S + Se):Sb = 1.49:1) after annealing. Moreover, the Se content in Sb2(S,Se)3 is slightly increased after adding the zeolite, and the Se/S changed from 0.75 to 0.83. In addition, the DLTS data show that the SbS/Se defects of the zeolite-modified as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 are significantly reduced (Fig. 3g and Table S4). This is consistent with the EDS results.
In comparison, two types of Sb2(S,Se)3 samples were fabricated in the presence/absence of zeolite introduction, and are labelled Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ and Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O, respectively. The typical surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ (Fig. S4c and 4e) are smoother and denser than those of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O (Fig. S4a and 4a). This demonstrates that the introduction of the zeolite is also able to modify the hydrothermal deposition process to improve the smoothness and compactness of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films. It is also clearly observed that there are a large number of pinholes in the annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O (Fig. 4b), which is similar to previously reported studies. We then analysed the cross-sectional morphologies of Sb2(S,Se)3/CdS heterojunctions using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. S4a shows clearly that the Sb2(S,Se)3 grains are composed of a large number of pinholes. With the addition of the zeolite into the hydrothermal reactor, the Sb2(S,Se)3(W/)/CdS heterojunctions became much clearer than those of the control sample (Fig. S5b). This observation is further confirmed by large area TEM characterization (Fig. S6).
We then made further inspection into whether the (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons were ordered in the Sb2(S,Se)3 grains, and the respective lattice fringes are shown in Fig. 4c and g. It turns out that large disordered areas of (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons are distributed in Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O (Fig. 4c, green circles). Meanwhile, the crystal arrangement appears chaotic at the center of the disordered area, and these characteristics are most likely generated by the pinholes. In the ordered area, the distances between the lattice lines were measured as 0.367 nm, which corresponds to the spacing between (101) planes in the orthorhombic Sb2(S,Se)3 crystal. The crystal planes extend discontinuously in the Sb2(S,Se)3 crystal, at the center of the disordered area, and these characteristics are most likely generated by the pinholes, confirming that this grain is internally disordered. In contrast, the Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ sample exhibits enhanced orderliness for (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons (Fig. 4g). Moreover, the distances between lattice lines were measured as 0.403 nm, which is consistent with the spacing of (220) planes. Therefore, this detailed analysis suggests that the zeolite additive can significantly improve the internal orderliness of the Sb2(S,Se)3 crystals in the hydrothermal deposition derived film.
To analyze how the zeolite changes the crystallization for the film formation, we compared the changes in peak intensities of (020), (120), (211), (221) and (301) in the XRD patterns (Fig. 5a and S7). Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ presents a slightly preferred [hkl] orientation, which is consistent with the results of HRTEM. Meanwhile, the enlarged (221) and (301) peaks with a shift toward lower angles may be due to the slightly higher Se content in Sb2(S,Se)3 W/. The ion radius of Se2− is larger than that of S2−, leading to a longer Sb–Se bond length than that of Sb–S, thus shifting the Bragg diffraction to lower 2θ values. The band gap values of Sb2(S,Se)3 are obtained from the absorption spectra (Fig. 5b). The Eg values of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layers can thus be extracted from the light absorbance, which are 1.45 eV for Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O and 1.43 eV for Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ (Fig. 5b, inset), respectively. These values are quite close to the optimal band gap value estimated using the Shockley–Queisser limit. Preferably, at the same thickness, the Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ sample shows obvious absorption enhancement in the 450–875 nm region. The improved compactness and a slightly high selenium composition in Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ should be attributed to this enhancement.
Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) results of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O and W/ are shown in Fig. S8a and b. Combining the UPS results with the estimated band gaps from the transmittance measurements (Fig. 5b), the Fermi level, valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films (W/O and W/) are obtained, as shown in Table S5. The Fermi level of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ is further close to the CBM, which indicates that the carrier concentration of this film has been increased. Subsequently, it can be calculated that the CBM position of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ relative to the vacuum level is 0.08 eV, higher than that of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O. Meanwhile, the VBM position of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ relative to the vacuum level is 0.10 eV, higher than that of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O. The Sb2(S,Se)3 W/ shows more efficient electron and hole injection into the CdS and spiro-OMeTAD films due to the better band offsets than those of Sb2(S,Se)3 W/O.
In order to examine the influence of the internal orderliness on the device performance of solar cells, we assembled solar cells with a glass/FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure. Fig. 5c and Table 1 show the typical photovoltaic parameters measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Device W/O delivered a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.61 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.573 V and fill factor (FF) of 61.66%, corresponding to a PCE of 7.28%. The PCE of device W/ remarkably improved to 8.87%, with a JSC of 23.58 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.570 V, and FF of 66.1%. The performance statistics of devices W/O and W/ are shown in Fig. S9. Obviously, the efficiency of device W/ is enhanced, which is mainly attributed to the increase of the JSC and FF. The internal orderliness of the Sb2(S,Se)3 grains improved carrier transport properties (Fig. 4d and h) and this should contribute to the enhancement in JSC and FF of the device. Note that the improved device performance is attributed to the addition of three zeolite particles in the hydrothermal process. In addition, we investigated the effect of different numbers of zeolite particles on device performance. We found that the device performance is almost the same when the number of zeolite is 1. However, when the number of zeolite particles increased to 5, the device performance decreased significantly to 6.66% (Fig. S10).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 5d. There is an obvious enhancement in the W/ device from 630 to 900 nm, and the improvement in the internal orderliness of the (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons plays a dominant role in the increased photocurrent generation. Computational study has confirmed that the oriented (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons can minimize the recombination loss of electrons and holes. The breakage of covalent bonds at the internal grain boundaries introduces additional defect states and recombination centers, and the disordered ribbons will reduce the charge transfer performance.
DLTS characterization was employed to study the deep-level defect properties of the two kinds of Sb2(S,Se)3 devices (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b shows the Arrhenius plots of devices W/O and W/, and the defect state, ET, σ, and NT of the detected defects in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells were calculated and are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 6c and d show the corresponding energy level alignment diagrams. As shown in Fig. 6a, three types of hole traps (denoted as H1, H2 and H3) are identified for both devices W/O and W/. The defects in the two types of devices show similar activation energy (Ea, Ea = ET − EV) values, where ET and EV are the defect energy level and valence band edge, respectively, indicating similar origins for each kind of defect. H1, H2, and H3 located above the valence band can be assigned to antisite defects in which antimony substitutes for sulfur or selenium (SbS/Se). Particularly, SbS/Se defects act as efficient recombination centers of the photogenerated electron–hole carriers. It is noted that four types of devices (as-prepared device W/O and W/; device W/O and W/) show different defect performances. Although the (S + Se) content in the as-prepared device W/ is higher, the defect type is hole defect, indicating that the excess anions mainly form SxSey2−. After annealing, the defect types of the two devices are transformed into hole defects (SbS/Se), which indicated that although the annealing is an in situ sulfuration/selenization process, the loss of anions could not be completely suppressed. Table 2 shows that the capture cross-sections of H1, H2 and H3 of device W/ are smaller than those of device W/O. The DLTS results demonstrate that the improved internal orderliness in Sb2(S,Se)3 is able to reduce the formation of deep level defects.

Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, AR), thiourea (CH4N2S, AR), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O, 25–28%), cadmium chloride hemi(pentahydrate) (CdCl2·2.5H2O, AR), antimony potassium tartrate hemihydrate (C4H4KO7Sb·0.5H2O, AR) and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm, China. Selenourea (CH4N2Se, 98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, America. Zeolite ((SiO2)x(Al2O3)y) was purchased from Macklin, China. Spiro-OMeTAD (99.8%) was purchased from Yingkou Youxuan Trade Co. Ltd., China. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 98%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%) were purchased from J&K, China. These chemicals and reagents were not purified before use.


The FTO substrates were ultrasonically washed with cleanser essence, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol, respectively. The ∼70 nm CdS layers were prepared on the cleaned FTO substrates by chemical bath deposition. After deposition, the CdS layers were treated with CdCl2·2.5H2O (20 mg mL−1 CdCl2·2.5H2O in absolute methanol) and annealed in air at 400 °C for 10 min. The deposition of Sb2(S,Se)3 layers was carried out by hydrothermal deposition on the CdS buffer layer. First, 40 mL aqueous solution with C4H4KO7Sb·0.5H2O (0.2671 g) was stirred in the inner Teflon tank of an autoclave (50 mL) for more than 5 min. Subsequently, Na2S2O3·5H2O (0.7942 g) and CH4N2Se (0.100 g) were successively added to the former solution stirring until the solution turned pale yellow. Then the FTO substrates with CdS were immersed in the solution. When preparing sample W/, three spherical zeolite particles about 5 mm in diameter were pasted on the back of the substrate. The autoclave was sealed and kept at 135 °C for 80 min to allow the growth of Sb2(S,Se)3 films with a thickness of 290 nm on the substrates. And then a thermal annealing at 350 °C for 10 min followed. Subsequently, the p-type contact layer of spiro-OMeTAD was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 60 nm Au electrodes were evaporated on the top of the device. We applied a mask with a 0.04 cm2 aperture area to define the effective device area.


The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on an SDT Q600 (TA Instruments). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with an SU8220 (Hitachi). Focused ion beam (FIB) coupled with a microsampling system (FEI Helios G4Nanolab 600i) was used to fabricate the cross-section samples. And the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired with a FEG TEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.5406Å). The UV-Vis spectra were obtained from a SOLID3700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The UPS measurement was conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher), and a He(I) discharge lamp (21.22 eV) was used as the UV light source. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve characterization studies were conducted using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm2) with a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3 A, Japan). Prior to the test, the solar simulator illumination intensity was calibrated using a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150 V, with a KG-5 visible color filter) which is also calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the devices were measured using an illumination system with a single source (halogen lamp) in connection with a monochromator (Model SPIEQ. 200). Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurement was performed to detect the defects of the devices using a Phystech FT-1230 HERA DLTS system equipped with a 10 mW laser with a 635 nm wavelength. The capacitance was measured using a Boonton 7200 capacitance meter with an upper limit frequency of 1 MHz. The samples were placed in a helium cryostat with a temperature scan ranging from 120 to 425 K at 2 K intervals. The reverse bias, optical pulse width, and period width were −0.4 V, 100 ms, and 200 ms, respectively.


In summary, we have identified a new intermediate phase antimony polysulfoselenide (Sb2(Sx,Sey)3) in the hydrothermal deposition of Sb2(S,Se)3. The slow decomposition of Sb2(Sx,Sey)3 during annealing produces a desired in situ sulfuration/selenization process. The escape of sulfur and selenium would cause value change and formation of pinholes in the final Sb2(S,Se)3 film. We disclose that the change in the pH value in the solution dictated the reaction process, and find that the introduction of a zeolite can increase the pH value of the solution, which inhibits the decomposition of Na2S2O3 to generate elemental S. This acidity change in turn increases the Se content and the compactness of the as-prepared Sb2(S,Se)3 film, thereby reducing the pinholes in the light-absorbing layer. Finally, the improved film quality, enhanced internal orderliness of the (Sb4(S,Se)6)n ribbons and reduced defects can promote charge transport, increase carrier lifetime, and suppress carrier recombination. This work provides chemical insights into the deposition and annealing mechanisms of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3, and the zeolite additive paves the way for improving the device performance of hydrothermally deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells in future. Besides, the desired in situ sulfuration/selenization process throws light on other hydrothermally deposited high-quality metal sulfoselenide thin films, such as Bi2(S,Se)3, Cd(S,Se), Zn(S,Se), Sn(S,Se), Cu2(S,Se), CuSb(S,Se)2, AgBi(S,Se)2, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4etc..
