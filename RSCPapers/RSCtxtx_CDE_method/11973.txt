Earth abundant Cu–Zn–Sn–S–Se (CZTSSe) is considered as a promising material for large area and cost effective solar energy harvesting. The current efficiency of CZTSSe champion solar cell, ∼12.7%, is much lower than that of its counterpart Cu–In–Ga–Se (CIGS) solar cell, ∼22.6%, and its theoretically predicted Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, ∼32%. This performance disparity is because of a large voltage deficit, ∼0.62 V, in comparison to the optical band gap that primarily results from high carrier recombination at the charge extraction interfaces. The different physical and chemical properties of interfacial layers often cause unfavorable band alignment and interfacial states that lead to high carrier recombination and eventually result in lower device efficiency. To obtain new insights about interfaces and to overcome the interface-related pitfalls, research on interface engineering of solar cells is rapidly accelerating and proven beneficial to achieve better device efficiency. This work provides a detailed strategic review on carrier transport and carrier recombination mechanisms by probing different interfaces of Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al–ZnO/Al through every possible aspect. This review proposes eccentric approaches of carrier management.

Renewable energy sources are clean, free and have no adverse impact on the environment in comparison to conventional energy sources. Sunlight is the most abundant and easily available clean energy source, so solar cells are the best technology to meet the large energy requirements globally. Cost-effective production of solar cells is paramount in emerging solar cell technologies. Nearly 85% share of the total photovoltaic market is taken by silicon-based solar cells because of their eco-rich material resources, non-toxic nature and durability. However, processing of Si solar cells is energy consuming because of high-temperature processes which make the manufacturing costly. Therefore, solar energy production using earth abundant and non-toxic materials is of high priority for clean environment and large-scale manufacturing. The main forerunners of existing thin film technologies are Cu–In–Ga–Se and CdTe solar cells, which are being fabricated commercially to meet energy consumption worldwide. But the material disadvantages like toxic behavior of cadmium and scarcity of indium and tellurium limit their market impact, as both these issues lead to higher cost and raise environmental concerns.

Cu–Zn–Sn–S (CZTS) based material is a good potential candidate to replace existing thin film solar cell technologies like CIGS and CdTe. Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), and mixed chalcogenide Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) are copper (Cu)-based I2–II–IV–VI4 quaternary kesterite compounds. Their properties, like tunable direct band gap of 1.0–1.5 eV, which matches well with incident solar radiation, and large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) make CZTSSe an attractive choice for thin film solar cells. Most importantly, the elements of CZTS(Se) are earth-abundant, inexpensive and environmentally benign. Furthermore, zinc and tin are earth-abundant and cost-effective in comparison to indium and gallium, which satisfies the need to fabricate low cost and large area solar cells. Furthermore, the theoretically predicted Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit of photoconversion efficiency for a single-junction CZTS(Se) solar cell is as high as 32.2%.Fig. 1 showcases the salient features of CZTS materials discussed above, which make them valuable for next generation thin film solar cell technology.
However, the current efficiency of CZTSSe champion solar cell, ∼12.7%, is much lower than that of its counterpart Cu–In–Ga–Se (CIGS) solar cell, ∼22.6%, even with a similar device structure, and its theoretically predicted SQ limit, ∼32%.
A plot of photocurrent ratio J (JSC/JSQ), a ratio of maximum current obtained from a solar cell when no load is connected to SQ limit of photocurrent, versus product of relative voltage and fill factor (FF × VOC/FFSQ × VSQ) with respect to corresponding SQ limit for different solar cell technologies is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 compares different parameters of record solar cells against ideal solar cells based on the SQ model. It can be observed that a solar cell with lower short-circuit current (JSC) than SQ limit suffers from inadequate absorption of the solar spectrum or partial collection of photogenerated carriers at the end electrodes. On the other hand, a reduced open-circuit voltage or fill factor reflects unsolicited bulk or interfacial photogenerated carrier recombination, parasitic resistance, or other electrical non-idealities.
Carrier management, i.e. ability of a device to convert light into electrical charge carriers and collect them efficiently at the end electrodes, is poor in the case of CZTS. The main cause of poor carrier management in CZTS solar cells is the recombination of photogenerated carriers at defects and at charge extraction interfaces. Device structure of CZTS solar cells consists of different interfacial layers and the carriers generated in the absorber layer have to transport from each interface before they finally get collected at the end electrodes. It has been reported by Ling Yin et al. that the density of defect states is very high at the CdS/CZTS interface in CZTS solar cells that leads to high recombination of carriers and results in VOC reduction. Another cause for VOC reduction is an unfavourable band alignment at the CdS/CZTS interface.Fig. 3 schematically demonstrates the recombination of photogenerated carriers when the band alignment is not optimized between absorber (CZTS) and buffer layer (CdS).
Trap state-assisted recombination is dominant when the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the buffer layer lies below the CBM of absorber layer. On the other hand, if the CBM of the absorber layer lies well below the CBM of the buffer layer then it offers a large barrier to photogenerated electrons and leads to high carrier losses. Both these situations hinder the performance of the device if the band offsets are not optimized. Therefore, interface engineering is the key area to minimize photogenerated carrier recombination and push device efficiency beyond that of the champion solar cell, 12.7%.
Other issues include secondary phases, defects and defect-complexes in Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 absorbing layer owing to of its narrow phase stability which are deleterious for solar cell performance. Fig. 4 represents a schematic phase diagram of the ternary phase system which shows a narrow region for stoichiometric Cu2ZnSnS4. The off-stoichiometric CZTS favors defects, defect-complexes and secondary phases that lead to structural inhomogeneity, local fluctuations of VOC and high recombination of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, it is difficult to elude the secondary phases, as most of the high-efficiency solar cells that have been reported are off-stoichiometric. Solar cells with efficiencies of more than 5% are reported to have Cu-poor phase (off-stoichiometric), as summarized in Table 1; even the champion cell with a reported efficiency of 12.7% possesses Cu-poor phase. The out-diffusion of S and volatile nature of Zn and Sn at growth temperature further support the formation of secondary phases and defects in CZTS. Analyzing IQE measurements, Gokmen et al. reported that the band gap fluctuations and electrostatic potential fluctuations were very high in CZTS(Se) solar cells causing band gap tailing and having adverse effects on the performance of the device. It is suggested that the electrostatic potential fluctuations are due to charged defects.

The shortcomings discussed for CZTSSe solar cells need to be resolved to realize high conversion efficiencies for wide use in clean energy generation. There has been extensive research done for secondary phases and defects present in CZTSSe solar cells and their roles in device performance. However, the interface properties and their influence on device characteristics demand extensive research to improve the efficiencies of earth-abundant CZTSSe.
In this review, the individual interface and its role in the photoconversion efficiency of CZTSSe material are discussed in detail. The importance of interface studies is discussed by comparing champion cell efficiencies of CIGS and CZTS solar cells along with reviewing recent developments of interface studies for different solar cells. The issues related to different interfaces in CZTS solar cell structures are discussed followed by a detailed discussion on individual interfaces. Finally, the article concludes with future prospects and proposals for photogenerated carrier management in CZTS solar cells. The idea encapsulating this study is to have a better prospect of getting highly efficient CZTSSe solar cells in the near future.

The lower CZTS solar cell performance is mainly attributed to phase impurities and poor interface quality. Interface recombination is one of the major causes of lower VOC. To understand this, a comparison of device characteristics for champion CZTSSe and CIGSSe solar cells is presented in Table 2. After comparing the characteristics of CZTSSe and CIGSSe, it can be seen that both the materials (in bold type) with record efficiency have the same band gap, but differ in Eg − qVOC values, where Eg is the optical band gap, q is the electron charge and VOC is the open circuit voltage.

It can be interpreted that the VOC deficit plays a vital role in device performance. In 2012, Barkhouse et al. compared their champion CZTS cell efficiency, 10.1%, with reference CIGS cell efficiency, 19.5%, and observed that the deficit in VOC is apparent in terms of VOC relative to the bandgap value. To elucidate the deficiency in VOC and dominant mechanics for carrier recombination, temperature dependence of VOC is analyzed by plotting VOCversus T, as in eqn (1), where EA, A, q, k, J00 and JL are activation energy for recombination, ideality factor, electron charge, Boltzmann constant, reverse saturation and photocurrent current, respectively.
(1)
According to the relation, VOCversus T data should be a straight line, extrapolation of which will give the activation energy EA/q at T = 0 K. It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that for both CZTSSe solar cells the intercept has a value less than their band gap, indicating the dominating interface carrier recombination. The most probable reasons for this problem are the electrical defects present at the CdS/CZTSSe interface or a ‘cliff-like’ band alignment, a negative band offset at the CdS/CZTSSe interface, as shown in Fig. 3. In contrast, the VOCversus T data of the CIGS cell show an intercept that agrees very well with its band gap value, i.e. 1.14 eV. Therefore, interface defects and band alignment at the CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction interface affect the carrier collection efficiency and adversely impact solar cell efficiency.Fig. 5(b) shows the low carrier lifetimes in the case of CZTSSe solar cells as compared to CIGS solar cell.
In order to reduce the VOC deficit and increase CZTSSe solar cell efficiency beyond 12%, it is important to comprehend different interfaces and recombination mechanisms. Interface engineering is crucial not only in CZTSSe but in other solar cells as well. Recently, 22.5% efficiency was achieved in silicon heterojunction solar cells by replacing p-type amorphous silicon with MoOx as a hole collecting layer. It is reported that the fill factor improves from 75.4% to 77.1% and optical absorbance of the device was also improved in comparison to reference solar cell. Increased light absorption is attributed to the increase in oxygen vacancy density within the MoOx film. Furthermore, in planar perovskite solar cells the screening of photogenerated carriers by the accumulated ions at the interface was observed to reduce device efficiency. Recently, use of low-temperature NiO as a hole transport layer for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells was reported. It proves to be an almost loss-free interface as it effectively passivates the surface recombination. NiO may also prove to be beneficial for hole transport in the CZTSSe case, as it meets the requirement of being a high work function material and with suitable valence band maxima at higher energy with respect to CZTS valence band maxima. Interfaces in perovskite solar cells have been engineered by careful choice of the interface materials and have suppressed the carrier recombination in the absorber layer and achieved 19.3% efficiency without any light management. A recent study by Kumar et al. on P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells reveals the importance of the P3HT:Al interface to reduce the carrier recombination and increase the solar cell efficiency.
TiO2 has recently been used as an electron transport layer (buffer layer) for non-vacuum processed CIGS solar cells. The elemental inter-diffusion at the TiO2/CIGS interface forms an inverted surface, reducing interface recombination which leads to VOC enhancement. High absorption in the UV part of the spectrum due to the large band gap (3.4 eV), compared to CdS (2.4 eV), results in significant photocurrent gain.
The performance of cuprous oxide photovoltaics has also been limited by the conduction band offset between cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and n-type material. This limits the open circuit voltage due to negative conduction band offsets with respect to Cu2O. One dimensional simulation was used to see the effect of a wide range of n-type materials on open circuit voltage. Among ZnO, ZnS, Zn(O,S), (Mg,Zn)O, TiO2, CdS and Ga2O3, only Zn(O,S) and Ga2O3 showed slightly positive conduction band offsets, as depicted in Fig. 6, and high open circuit voltage.
Understanding and controlling the energetics of the charge-separating interface have contributed to improving the efficiency of various solar cell devices. As discussed above, lots of research is being done on the interface engineering of different solar cell devices. The fruitfulness of controlling the quality of interfaces in different solar cells is the real motivation to have a detailed discussion of different interfaces and their role in device performance of CZTSSe solar cells.

The device structure, band alignment and carrier transport across different interfaces of CZTS solar cells are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). The differences in crystal structure, lattice constant, electron affinity, work function and mechanical stress at the interfaces promote defects, interface states and recombination of photogenerated carriers. Besides, the inter-diffusion of material between the interfaces also creates secondary phases. Secondary compounds segregate at the interface and hinder carrier extraction across the interface. Cd diffuses into the absorber layer and Zn and S/Se out-diffuse towards the CdS buffer layer during the annealing process which may alter the band alignment at the CdS/CZTS interface and may hinder carrier transport.

Similarly, formation of secondary phases like Cu2S at the CdS/CZTS interface, ZnS and SnS2 at the CZTS/Mo interface and their segregation reduce the device performance. The formation of MoS2 or MoSe2 layer due to sulfurization or selenization at the CZTSSe/Mo interface is another factor which is crucial to solar cell efficiency. MoS2 or MoSe2 layer at the interface affects VOC and alters the band alignment between CZTS(Se) and Mo back contact. Individual interfaces are reviewed in detail to discuss and highlight these issues in order to get a useful approach that can help in the engineering of interfaces for desired outcomes.

CdS is commonly deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) on a p-type CZTS absorber layer to form a p–n junction. The band alignment at the CdS/CZTS interface is an important area of research because of its critical role in charge transfer. It can help in understanding the remarkable impact of band offset on transportation and recombination of carriers across and around the interface. The main question that needs to be answered is: what type of interface is formed between CdS and CZTS layer, Type I or Type II? To answer this question, different device modelling and first principles calculations were conducted. Type I and Type II interfaces are identified based on their conduction band offset as shown in Fig. 8.

In Type I, the conduction band (CB) of absorber layer lies lower than the window layer, as shown in Fig. 8(a), resulting in a potential barrier that could prevent the flow of electrons from absorber to window layer. While in Type II, the CB of the absorber layer lies higher than the window layer, as shown in Fig. 8(b), so a cliff is formed and electron transport gets easier from absorber to window layer. Type I and Type II are assumed to be better for high open circuit voltage and high short circuit current, respectively. The absolute magnitude of mismatch of the conduction band (valence band) of the two materials is called the conduction band offset (valence band offset). Theoretical studies have shown that these band offsets might depend on the type of connecting anion present in the supercell interface, the lattice constraint condition and the interface electric dipole contribution. Experimentally these band offsets are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical band gap measurement.

There are ‘cliff-like’ and ‘spike-like’ conduction band offset reports for CZTS-CdS interface. Bar et al. experimentally found cliff-like CBO of 0.33 eV and VBO of 1.20 (±0.15) eV, using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES). Measurement of CBM for CZTS and CdS confirmed the ‘cliff-like’ CBO. Theoretical calculations show negative band offsets or ‘cliff-like’ offsets limit VOC by increasing recombination at the interface and significantly reducing the fill factor of the solar cell. It is reported that for negative band offset, recombination current flowing through the interface states is dominating and mainly depending on the density of electrons and holes at the interface, thereby reducing VOC and fill factor. In another study, VBO was measured by an indirect method involving core levels together with XPS bulk valence band (VB) spectra and a direct method by analyzing XPS VB spectra at the interface. From the measured values of VBO by indirect and direct methods, CBO has been calculated as (−0.30 ± 0.14) eV and (−0.34 ± 0.06) eV, respectively. The results indicated CBO to be ‘cliff-like’. In another study, a positive band offset or ‘spike-like’ band offset for CZTSSe has been reported. The band alignment was studied between Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 and CdS as a function of S/(S + Se) ratio. Increasing S content shows an increase in the band gap of CZTSSe by shifting the VB edge towards higher binding energy, thus reducing VBO, and little dependence of CB edge on S content. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that a spike-like offset is present in all cases with a value slightly greater than the optimal reported value of 0.4 eV.

The effect of Se composition on the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells was studied. It was found that an increase in Se content in CZTS reduces the band gap by shifting the CB edge downwards. Doping rules suggest difficulties to make a semiconductor n-type and p-type if the conduction band level is too high in energy and if the valence band is too low in energy, respectively. For CuInSe2, the Fermi energy level is pinned at about 0.06 eV above the CBM so it is difficult to dope n-type when the CBM level is much higher than the pinning level. As both Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 have a similar electronic structure to CuInSe2, the same analogy can be applied to Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4.Fig. 10 shows band alignment between different materials, where the red line indicates the pinning level. It can be seen that the red line falls below the CBM of Cu2ZnSnS4, whereas it is above that of Cu2ZnSnSe4, indicating Cu2ZnSnSe4 can be easily doped n-type relative to Cu2ZnSnS4. CZTSe is relatively easier to be doped n-type than CZTS; therefore solar cells with high Se content have high efficiency, even though the band gap is not optimal. The studies revealed that the CBO at CdS/CZTSSe can be converted from Type II to Type I with Se in CZTSSe. The band alignment between Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 is Type I and CBM of CdS lies between those of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 as shown in Fig. 10. It can be concluded that the S, Se content or S/Se ratio in CZTS absorber affect the band alignment at the interface and optimization of their concentrations can result in favorable alignment.
Tajima and co-workers have used hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) to measure VBO at the interface between CdS and CZTS and estimated CBO at the CdS/CZTS interface by VBO and Eg of both CZTS and CdS. It is reported that the offset measurement is more accurate using HAXPES than the core level method used in XPS, as the core level often changes because of chemical shift due to impurities. They have estimated almost a flat band CBM at the CdS/CZTS interface as shown in Fig. 11, with a CBO of 0.0 ± 0.1 eV calculated from VBO and Eg of both CdS and CZTS layers.
Regardless of the flat band at the interface, the efficiency is quite low for devices. Low device efficiency is attributed to the defects present at the interface and the difference between the measured VBO and that estimated from ionization potential.
First principles study was also used to calculate the local density of states and valence band offset (ΔEV) for each atom in supercell for CdS/CZTS and ZnO/CZTS interfaces. In the CdS/CZTS interface, two different inequivalent interfaces were found between CdS and CZTS. The valence band offset value (ΔEV) was ΔEV1 = 1.1 eV and ΔEV2 = 1.6 eV (ΔEC1 = 0.2 eV and ΔEC2 = 0.7 eV) while the conduction band minimum of CZTS is higher than that of CdS which leads to a Type II heterostructure. In the ZnO/CZTS interface, the valence band offset was found to be 0.8–1.3 eV (ΔEC = 0.5–1.0 eV) depending on the type of anions at the interface and the lattice constraint conditions with a Type I interface heterostructure.
Nagoya and his group also performed first principles calculations on the XS/CZTS (X = Cd, Zn) interface using hybrid functional for different interface orientations. For CdS/CZTS and ZnS/CZTS, the (111) interface is most stable with an interface energy of 0.073 J m−2 and 0.07 J m−2, respectively, while the conduction band offset (ΔEC) calculated for CdS/CZTS and ZnS/CZTS interfaces was 0.20 eV and 1.32 eV, respectively. The conduction band offset for CdS/CZTS was found to vary from 0.3 to 0.57 eV for different interfaces and showed a Type I heterointerface structure which is contradictory to Wujisiguleng Bao's work. In another study, Bao et al. also reported the effect of crystal structure and its orientation on conduction band offset at the CdS/CZTS interface. CZTS can crystallize in kesterite as well as in stannite phase. Fig. 12(a)–(c) shows the supercells of the CdS/CZTS interface with stannite and kesterite structures along with CdS/kesterite CZTS supercell. The valence band offset (ΔEV) for the CdS/CZTS interface in (001) and (010) heterointerface was 1.2 eV and 1.0 eV and 1.1 eV and 1.3 eV if CZTS crystallizes in kesterite structure and stannite structure, respectively. In both cases it was observed that CdS/CZTS showed a Type II heterointerface regardless of the orientation of the heterostructure interface.
Experimental and theoretical studies were conducted to measure the conduction band offsets of the CdS/CZTS and CdS/ZnO interfaces in a CZTS/CdS/ZnO stack of layers. XPS and optical absorption spectroscopy along with first principles calculations were performed. Although CBO calculated by first principles at these interfaces was found to be 0.05 eV and 0.29 eV, respectively, which are smaller than experimentally found CBO at both interfaces (ΔECdS/CZTSC = 0.13 eV and ΔECdS/ZnOC = 1.0 eV), it confirmed the Type II interface structure at both the interfaces.
Solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) study of the CdS/CIGS interface was carried out by varying the CBO from −0.6 eV to 0.6 eV. A maximum efficiency of 18% was obtained without considering the interfacial recombination with a band gap of 1.35 eV. Whereas, taking charge-free interface recombination center into consideration at the CdS/CIGS interface, the highest efficiency was found to be slightly reduced to 17% with a band gap of 1.25 eV. Efficiencies reported of 17–18% were calculated with band gaps of 1.15 eV to 1.55 eV, corresponding to CBO of +0.3 eV to −0.1 eV.
The effect of KCN etching of the CZTS layer before CdS deposition was also studied along with a detailed interface investigation. This study was extended to find CBO and VBO at the CdS/CZTS interface and at the KCN-etched CZTS and CdS (CdS/KCN-CZTS) interface using UPS and IPES.Fig. 13 shows the linear extrapolation of UPS and IPES spectra to determine the CBM and VBM positions and computed electronic surface band gaps. For the CZTS sample, Esurfaceg was 1.53 eV whereas for KCN-CZTS it was found to be 1.92 eV. Most importantly, a large band gap for KCN-CZTS was attributed to modification in the surface composition caused by KCN etching. It was reported that the band gap at CdS/KCN-CZTS is significantly larger (1.58 ± 0.15 eV) and the barrier for recombination is enhanced. Although the band alignment is ‘cliff-like’, the enhanced interface barrier for recombination proves beneficial for improvement in VOC. The efficiency increased by 40% in the case of KCN etching with KCN CZTS solar cells. No significant change in CBO with KCN was observed, as shown in Fig. 14.

To overcome the parasitic absorption in the CdS layer due its low band gap and its toxicity, an alternative buffer layer has been reported for CZTS and CIGS solar cells. Bjorkman et al. have replaced CdS with atomic layer deposition (ALD) Zn(O,S) buffer layer in a CIGS solar cell and achieved an efficiency up to 16.4%. A ‘cliff-like’ offset of 0.2 eV at the CIGS/ZnO interface was observed and the ZnS buffer layer has a large positive ‘spike-like’ offset of 1.2 eV at the CIGS/ZnS interface. The better results were observed with Zn(O,S) of low sulfur content. Later on, a sputtered Zn(O,S) buffer layer using a mixed ZnO/ZnS target on CIGSe absorber was investigated and 18.3% efficiency was achieved. The ALD Zn(O,S) buffer layer was also tried for CZTS. The best device efficiency was found to be 4.6% and the performance was found to be limited due to recombination at the interface.

In another study ALD-grown Zn1−xSnxOy (ZTO) was proposed as a buffer layer for the CIGS absorber layer. Fig. 15 shows the band alignment between CIGS and ZTO with different Sn content. The band gap was observed to increase with Sn concentration. Most favorable conduction band alignment was estimated for x = 0.2.
Recently, a ZTO buffer layer was deposited on a CZTS absorber layer by ALD. It was reported that a change in ALD deposition temperature alters the conduction band energy level for the buffer layer due to quantum confinement effects. An ALD deposition temperature of 90 °C was reported to widen the ZTO band gap leading to a blocking behavior in CIGS solar cells. An optimal CBO was estimated for ZTO/CZTS at 95 °C from ZTO/CIGS studies and the influence of deposition temperature on device performance was determined. The device performance of ALD-grown ZTO along with reference CdS is shown in Fig. 16.
The effect of ALD-grown ZTO buffer layer was further investigated to measure the activation energy for carrier recombination. The measured VOC to 0 K is shown in Fig. 17. The activation energy for recombination in the case of ZTO was found to be 1.36 eV, which is still lower than the band gap but higher than that of the CdS reference cell. Also, the recombination energy of 1.36 eV is close to room temperature photoluminescence peak of the CZTS absorber which means that the barrier for recombination is increased. It is concluded that ZTO proves to be a superior alternative to the CdS buffer layer.
ZnS is also considered as a potential alternative buffer layer for CZTS solar cells. ZnS has a similar structure (zinc blende) as CZTS and only leads to a small lattice mismatch of 1%, unlike 7% in the case of CdS. The ‘spike-like’ CBO of 0.86 eV is estimated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the CZTS/ZnS interface. High content of ZnS limits the grain size of CZTS which leads to high series resistance and acts as a current blocking layer (lower JSC), similar to what is observed for ZnSe in CZTSe solar cells. Highly resistive ZnS segregates in the depletion region reducing the recombination which enhances VOC and leads to an increase in shunt resistance. Optimization of ZnS content in the depletion region can lead to better device efficiencies. A (Zn,Mg)O/CdS multilayer has also been investigated for the CZTSSe absorber and showed an efficiency of 9.28% compared to the reference cell with a CdS buffer layer.
Different buffer layers with their measured CBO and VBO are summarized in Table 3. Zn(O,S) and In2S3 were used as alternative buffer layers for a CZTS solar cell and compared with the CdS buffer layer. A positive CBO for In2S3 and Zn(O,S) in comparison to negative CBO for CdS was observed. The smaller efficiency of In2S3 in comparison to the CdS layer is due to its slightly higher CBO, 0.41 eV, than optimal value (0.4 eV), whereas in Zn(O,S) the CBO is very large, 0.98 eV, hence offering a large barrier to carriers and resulting in almost zero efficiency. It was proposed to use a hybrid In/Cd buffer layer to have a positive offset in the optimal range. In another study, In2S3, ZnS and ZnO were investigated as alternative buffer layers and positive CBO was found for In2S3. Although ZnO has a positive CBO within the optimal range, its high series resistance and reduced band bending result in lower efficiency. Recently, Chang Yan and his group have used In/Cd-based hybrid buffer layers for CZTS and reported efficiency improvement from 5.5% to 6.6% compared to the CdS buffer layer. The increase in the efficiency was attributed to the ‘spike-like’ CBO and increase in carrier concentration due to indium doping in CZTS. Similarly, In doping was reported to effectively increase carrier concentration for CIGS solar cells. Mitzi and his group also tried a In2S3/CdS hybrid buffer layer for CZTSSe in 2014 and reported a maximum efficiency of 12.7%, more than that of the champion CZTSSe with CdS buffer layer, which is remarkable in the case of an alternative buffer layer. The studies on In/Cd hybrid buffer layer showed its potential to be used as a buffer layer; also it was estimated that carrier density can be optimized for the In/Cd buffer layer to achieve lower VOC deficit which can further improve the performance. Recently, CdS was replaced with In2S3 for an electrodeposited CZTS absorber layer and observed to have a positive CBO of 0.11 eV which leads to an efficiency of 6.9%. Also, the diffusion of In shifted the band gap towards longer wavelength resulting in large short circuit current density. In a very recent study, Zn1−xCdxS has been used as a buffer instead of CdS which showed remarkable improvement in open circuit voltage with a power conversion efficiency of 9.2%. It is observed that the position of VBM and CBM is dependent on Cd/Zn ratio (value of x) and the CBO changes from cliff to spike as the ratio changes. The optimal CBO (spike) is found for the Zn0.35Cd0.65S/CZTS interface. It can be inferred from the data compiled in Table 3 that the buffer layers like In2S3 and Zn1−xCdxS have positive (spike) CBO which makes Zn1−xCdxS and In2S3 in conjunction with CdS for CZTSSe-based solar cells. However, using Zn1−xCdxS as a buffer layer does not resolve the issue of toxicity that remains with CdS.

In a very recent study, Siol et al. reported high-throughput combinatorial growth of In2S3 as an alternative buffer layer with temperature and thickness gradient.Fig. 18(a) and (b) is a schematic illustration of deposition technique and device layout used in that study, respectively. Using reactive sputtering with H2S, pure phase In2S3 was grown over a wide range of temperature. It was found that the transport properties strongly depend on the substrate temperature and thickness of the buffer layer. For optimal thickness, In2S3 deposited at 290 °C showed results better than the CdS reference device.
This study opens up the prospect of optimization of In2S3 and other buffer layers using a combinatorial growth approach.

Apart from high conductivity, a wide optical band gap is required to have high transparency in the desired spectrum for the front contact in solar cells. Therefore, a window layer consisting of intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) is used in CIGS and CZTS solar cells. The moderate optoelectronic properties, low cost and wide band gap make ZnO a suitable window layer for solar cell applications. The role of AZO is understood, as it has high conductivity and provides a sufficiently wide band gap for transparency; however, the exact role of i-ZnO is not understood completely. It has been observed that the i-ZnO window layer is suitable for solar cells with the beneficial effects of i-ZnO in terms of reducing electronic inhomogeneities at the absorber surface. It removes surface oxides and inhomogeneties formed on CdS during fabrication, and thereby helps in improving open circuit voltage. An important parameter in understanding the role of i-ZnO is the band alignment of ZnO towards CdS. If the band arrangement among the window layer and the buffer layer is not suitable for charge transport, the EQE of the device decreases even though the absorber has high IQE. The ZnO/CdS interface was studied using XPS and UPS in the early 1990s for CIGS solar cells. Core level binding energies and Auger structures were carefully examined to investigate any interface reaction. Band offset at the ZnO/CdS interface was measured from XPS and UPS analysis, where CBO and VBO were estimated to be 0.3 eV and 1.2 eV, respectively. A schematic illustration of the band offset between ZnO and CdS is shown in Fig. 19. It is reported that for solar cell applications, electron transport through the ZnO/CdS interface with this CBO is not affected and resulting in high performance of the CIGS solar cell. Furthermore, the microscopic interface properties, like local charge distribution resulting from the formation of interface chemical bonds, do not play a dominant role for the band offset.

In another study, the band offset at the ZnO/CdS interface was investigated with XPS and UPS. Fig. 20 represents a schematic of the band offset. Almost a flat CBO of 0.10 ± 0.15 eV and VBO of −0.96 ± 0.15 eV were observed. Both the reports have shown different CBO for the ZnO/CdS interface, but neither of the two reports discussed the effect of band offset on the device efficiency. Although it is reported that the ZnO/CdS interface does not resist charge transport.

Considering its beneficial effects for CIGS solar cells, Mo is used as an end electrode in CZTS solar cells as well. Mo back contact is found to have advantageous effects on CIGS device performance in terms of ohmic contact, good adhesion properties and the formation of MoSe2 which acts as a diffusion barrier. But its effect on CZTS is yet to be determined completely and even Mo layer is reported to have a detrimental effect on CZTS solar cell, if not optimized. Formation of MoS2 (MoSe2) during sulfurization (selenization) affects the open circuit voltage and band alignment at the CZTS/Mo interface which may have deleterious effects on the device performance. Scragg and his co-workers reported that the thickness of MoS2 formed at the back contact increases with annealing time of the solar cell.


Fig. 21 shows the thickness variation of the MoS2 layer with annealing time. It has been reported that MoS2 assists in ohmic contact at the back if its thickness is below a few hundred nanometers, otherwise it may have adverse effects on device performance. Another challenge associated with the back contact is the formation of secondary compounds such as Cu, Zn and Sn sulfides which are not good for carrier transport at the end electrode. Adopting the low-temperature formation path for CZTS growth may solve this issue to some extent. Recently, there has been a report on optimizing CZTS growth at low temperature that effectively fabricates more controllable CZTS films; moreover low temperature reduces the SnS2 decomposition in volatile SnS. Low-temperature treatment reduces the thickness of detrimental MoS2 layer which significantly contributes to the series resistance of the device.

One of the main challenges faced in development of CZTS-based solar cells is the non-optimization of the back contact. In order to improve the back contact, different intermediate layers like TiN, Ag, TiB2, Bi, carbon, and ZnO have been used on top of the Mo electrode as listed in Table 4. Efficiency of 8.9% is reported with TiN as a barrier layer which suppresses the formation of MoSe2 at the CZTSe/Mo interface. Thickness of MoSe2 decreases with a decrease in annealing temperature and grain size also reduces therefore resulting in lower efficiency. In order to get large grain size, selenium partial pressure (PSe) was varied while temperature remained constant at 540 °C. However, it was found that the electronic structure is very sensitive to PSe if it is different from its equilibrium value. Increase in PSe is reported to have decreased the carrier lifetime and low PSe results in formation of defects due to Se deficiency within the band gap. Fig. 22(a) shows a dark field cross-sectional TEM image of a sample with a 20 nm thick TiN layer. An EDS line scan shown in Fig. 22(b) reveals the decreased concentration of Se at the CZTSe and TiN contact. However, some of the Se atoms diffuse through TiN forming MoSe2. Although the use of TiN as a barrier layer manages to reduce the thickness of MoSe2 to 220 nm at a temperature of 570 °C, the thickness was 1300 nm at the same temperature without TiN. Efficiency of 8.9% is achieved for vacuum-evaporated CZTSe films with a TiN barrier layer.

The effect of a TiN barrier layer in CZTS solar cells was also investigated by Scragg and his group. It was shown that there must be a strong correlation between the chemical picture and the device performance by modifying the back contact with annealing conditions. It was revealed that the instability of the back contact reduces JSC with no associated VOC losses. TiN as a barrier layer effectively passivates the reactions between CZTS and Mo. However, the TiN/CZTS contact was reported to offer high series resistance which is detrimental. The maximum efficiency achieved with the TiN barrier layer in CZTS solar cells is 5.5% (ref. 44) and 8.9% (ref. 43) in CZTSe solar cells.
Incorporation of a ZnO layer of 10 nm is found to restrain the reaction between CZTSe and Mo. Fig. 23(a) and (b) shows cross-sectional SEM images without and with a ZnO intermediate layer, respectively. Fig. 23(c) and (d) shows SEM images obtained on lamella without and with a ZnO intermediate layer. Lots of voids can be observed from Fig. 23(c) whereas a smooth surface can be observed from Fig. 23(d). With a ZnO intermediate layer, the smoother surface at the back contact reduces series resistance and efficiency was enhanced from 2.5% to 6%. Liu et al. also used ZnO as a barrier layer for CZTS solar cells and reported that MoS2 can cause a severe effect on the series resistance compared to MoSe2. This is because MoSe2 has a resistivity of 0.9096 Ω cm and MoS2 has a resistivity of 829.54 Ω cm, which is almost 1000 times greater than that of MoSe2. They have also reported similar results where ZnO reduces the voids at the back surface and provides a smoother surface.
Apart from this, XRD results shown in Fig. 24 reveal that a sample with a ZnO intermediate layer has much smaller peaks of SnS2 than a sample without ZnO. Formation of a secondary phase such as SnS2 is reported to have detrimental effects as it leads to a high series resistance, therefore resulting in lower short circuit current density.
So, the ZnO layer is reported to improve the performance and enhance efficiency from 1.13% to 4.3% by reducing voids, by reducing MoS2 thickness and by suppressing SnS2 formation. Almost the same results were obtained with an Ag intermediate layer for a CZTS solar cell and an efficiency of 4.42% was achieved. Ag was found to reduce voids, reduce MoS2 thickness and suppress the formation of SnS2. TiB2 is reported to reduce the thickness of MoS2 and no peaks of secondary phases were observed in XRD and Raman spectra. TiB2 is not considered to be good in terms of grain boundary chemistry because it reduces the crystallinity of the CZTS absorber layer which is harmful for device performance. Highest efficiency achieved is 4.4% for a 30 nm thick TiB2 layer.
Another study reported the use of a thin carbon layer which is an inert material for sulfur and possesses high conductivity. Carbon was reported to be deposited uniformly over the Mo without changing the microstructure and no peaks were observed for secondary phases. From the cross-sectional TEM image of a sample with carbon, shown in Fig. 25(a), voids and formation of a MoS2 layer are evident. EDS line scans were obtained on the regions marked in Fig. 25(a), yellow (right arrow) on void area and blue (left arrow) on grains.
The EDS scan obtained on the voids, Fig. 25(b), shows a peak of carbon, whereas no peaks were observed for carbon in EDS scans on grains, shown in Fig. 25(c). Fig. 25(d)–(f) show a TEM cross-section image and EDS line scans on voids and grains without a carbon layer, respectively. These results show that carbon does not inhibit the formation of a MoS2 layer at the CZTS/Mo interface. The main advantage of using carbon over other materials is not to suppress void formation but that it sticks on the inner walls of the voids, evident from the EDS line scan in Fig. 25(b) showing a carbon peak, and helps reconnect CZTS and MoS2 thereby reducing series resistance.
With a carbon layer, efficiency enhances from 4.10% to 5.20%, JSC increases from 17.0 to 20.5 mA cm−2 (increase of 17%), VOC increases from 560 mV to 580 mV and FF increases by 2% for the sputter-based method. For the sol–gel method, JSC increases by 25% and no significant reduction is observed in VOC and FF. Carbon can be used as an intermediate layer for both vacuum and non-vacuum based methods, it having no detrimental effects on JSC and FF. All these advantages make carbon a suitable barrier layer for CZTS-based solar cells.
Recently Bi has also been used as an intermediate layer to modify the back contact in CZTS solar cells. It has been reported that Bi improves the crystallinity of the CZTS absorber layer. This may be due to the low melting point of Bi which acts as a fluxing agent to fast-track the crystal growth, which is the explanation given for CIGS solar cells. Because of improved crystallinity, grain boundaries are decreased which reduces the grain boundary recombination, and it reduces the thickness of MoS2 hence reducing series resistance. Highest efficiency of 5.67% was obtained for a 20 nm thick Bi intermediate layer.

Unlike the buffer absorber interface, the band offset at the back contact is not studied deeply. Biccari et al. have investigated the issues related to the back contact in CZTS solar cells. They found that MoS2 grown along the c-axis parallel to the substrate is the same orientation which is reported to give the best results in the case of the CIGS solar cell. It was suggested to have p-type MoS2 in order to achieve better results. According to their calculations and analysis it was found that n-type MoS2 forms a barrier at the CZTS/MoS2 interface, which is detrimental to device performance.

MoS2 layer formation between CZTS and Mo is inherent, so it is very important to study the band offset at the Mo/MoS2 and the MoS2/CZTS interfaces. Dhakal and his group have reported band offset at the back contact, specifically at the Mo/MoS2 interface. Binding energies and VBM values were obtained from XPS/UPS spectra to estimate the band alignment.Fig. 26 shows a schematic band diagram and band alignment at the Mo/MoS2 interface.
It can be noticed from the band diagram that MoS2 is an n-type semiconductor having its VBM lying at 0.84 eV from the Fermi level with an upward band bending of 0.11 eV. It was reported that MoS2 is not a barrier for hole transport at the Mo/MoS2 interface. Preliminary measurements (details not reported yet) done for the CZTS/MoS2 interface by the same group may be an indication that MoS2 may act as barrier for hole transport at the CZTS/MoS2 interface.
A lot more studies are required to investigate the CZTS/MoS2 interface in depth and to propose an effective solution for this problem. Some alternative materials can be searched offering low resistance contact and providing suitable band alignment to have efficient hole transport across the interface.

There are many approaches to improve the interface quality in Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al–ZnO/Al solar cells to avoid carrier losses that include the passivation of interfacial defects and alternative or modified back Mo contact. The approach helps to reduce photogenerated carrier losses and improve open circuit voltage deficit.


Alkali metal doping like that with Na has been reported to give beneficial effects on CZTSSe and CIGS solar cells. Recent studies on the effect of alkali metal doping, like Li and K doping, have reported it to significantly improve the efficiency of CZTS solar cells. It is reported that Li and K alter the defect chemistry in CZTSSe solar cells improving the hole carrier density, hence improving device performance. In a very recent study, the effect of lithium doping on the CdS/CZTS interface was also reported. A LixCu2−xZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cell device was fabricated, by adding LiOH to a CZTS precursor solution. A blue shift was observed in the EQE spectra revealing that the Li incorporation enlarges the band gap of the material, shown in Fig. 27(a). The band gap values of LixCu2−xZnSn(S,Se)4 were obtained by plotting [Eln(1 − EQE)]2vs. E, as shown in Fig. 27(b). Fig. 27(c) indicates the increase in band gap with increase in the Li/Cu ratio. UPS was used to measure the VBM and CBM of LixCu2−xZnSn(S,Se)4 for different Li/Cu ratios, shown in Fig. 27(d).

It is evident from Fig. 27(d) that the positions of VBM and CBM shift towards lower energy with the Li/Cu ratio; the shift in CBM is small which results in enlargement of the band gap, hence improving the open circuit voltage. Positive (spike) band offset is observed at the CdS/LixCu2−xZnSn(S,Se)4 interface. Tunable band gap and change in CBO with Li incorporation make it possible to improve VOC and efficiency in the CZTSSe solar cell.

It has been reported for materials like CIGS and silicon that ALD-coated dielectric films help in reducing defect densities at the surface and increasing carrier lifetime. Not only for passivation, the literature reports the use of ALD-coated films to reduce the interdiffusion across the interface. A study has been done where ALD TiO2 was used to passivate the CdS/CZTSe interface and the impact of the passivation layer was investigated via current voltage measurements, capacitance profiling and admittance spectroscopy. The TiO2 layer deposited was thin (1–5 nm thick) enough to support tunneling of charge carriers through the layer. Compared to the standard device without a passivation layer, a device with an ALD TiO2 layer showed better VOC, fill factor and efficiency, but lower JSC, as shown in Fig. 28.

Lower short circuit current is attributed to the insulating behavior of the passivation layer. Defect densities from deep level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurements are similar for standard and passivated devices, whereas CV profiling, Fig. 29, reveals lower defect densities for the ALD-coated TiO2 layer in comparison to the standard device. Also, activation energy for recombination is reported to have a higher value (892 meV) than the 850 meV for the standard device.
ALD-processed Al2O3 was also reported to be used as a passivation layer at the CdS/CZTSSe interface. To prevent unwanted modification of the surface, ALD was carried out at low temperature. Passivated devices have been reported to show lower defect densities and higher VOC in comparison to their unpassivated counterparts. Device analysis indicated a reduction in the interface trapped charge including a much wider depletion region width.

The role of Mo back contact is still debatable in CZTS-based solar cells. The MoS2 formed does not have the same effects as it does for CIGS solar cells. MoS2 acts as a barrier for hole transport at the CZTS/MoS2 interface. The instability of the CZTS/Mo interface was experimentally explained. A reaction scheme is presented as eqn (2) showing the formation of MoS2 and the secondary phases during the annealing process.

2Cu2ZnSnS(e)4 + Mo → 2Cu2S(e) + 2ZnS(e) + 2SnS(e) + MoS(e)2
(2)
To check the validity of the above reaction, all the possible sources of S were eliminated and, to remove any residual S in the background, the annealing system was heated at 600 °C under vacuum for 12 hours. Raman spectra of the Mo surface after the removal of the CZTS layer exhibit the same results as that of the fresh Mo layer, which shows that no MoS2 forms during reactive sputtering. The samples were annealed with a glass cover, without adding any external S source, to have a stoichiometric phase and to avoid formation of secondary phases as expected to occur in the non-stoichiometric case. Fig. 30 shows a scanning transmission electron microscopy image along with energy dispersive X-ray maps with Cu, Zn, Sn and S elements. The right-hand side of Fig. 30 shows electron diffraction patterns observed for Cu–S and Zn–S regions.
Energy dispersive X-ray maps clearly show the formation and segregation of cubic ZnS and a Cu2−xS phase at the back contact during annealing. These results confirm the phase segregation from single phase into other secondary phases during the annealing process, as per the chemical reaction represented in eqn (2). Focus has to be put on the search for a more inert material as a replacement of Mo for the back contact in CZTS(Se)-based solar cells.

The low photon conversion efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells is the main challenge facing the scientific community that even reduces their merit and potential to produce low-cost clean energy for large-scale production. The efficiency of CZTSSe has reached 12.7% in comparison to 21.7% for identical device structure in CIGS champion solar cells. The close comparison between the two solar cell technologies revealed similar short circuit current, 35.2 mA cm−2 for CZTSSe and 36.6 mA cm−2 for CIGS, while different open circuit voltage and fill factors, 513.4 mV of VOC and 69.8% of FF for CZTSSe and 746 mV of VOC and 79.3% of FF for CIGS solar cells, respectively. Many factors influence VOC, but carrier recombination near the interfaces plays a vital role. Improving VOC can improve FF directly and hence improves the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells. The CZTSSe solar cell has maximum open circuit voltage deficit, difference in VOC and optical band gap of 613 mV in comparison to 384 mV for CIGS solar cells. This implies that there is enough room to improve open circuit voltage and fill factor for CZTSSe solar cells, and to meet this goal more focus should be given to three aspects: (1) CZTSSe specific interfacial layer materials development, (2) novel growth techniques for interface layer materials and (3) multi-domain interface probing facilities on a device scale.

The interfacial materials like buffer layer, window layer and back metal contact in CZTSSe solar cells are imitated from CIGS solar cells with a belief in their identical performance as in CIGS solar cells. In terms of results, CdS buffer layer reflects more interfacial states in CZTSSe solar cells and results in high carrier recombination. Moreover, the solar cell structures in CZTSSe and CIGS are quite different from each other in terms of forming junction. Lattice mismatch of the CZTS and CdS interface is ∼7% (ref. 58) which is larger than the CIGS and CdS lattice mismatch of 1%. This leads to different band offset for the CdS/CZTS interface and defect density states at the interface. ‘Spike-like’ band offset (0–0.4 eV) is considered to be an ideal case for the CdS/CIGS interface but, owing to different lattice mismatches, it cannot be considered to be an ideal case for the CdS/CZTS interface. Therefore, interface engineering is the key area of investigation to improve device efficiency. Different materials forming interfaces have different physical and chemical properties that result in stress at the interface, which eventually is a big challenge in this area. Since the buffer absorber interface plays a very critical role in efficient charge transport, it is important to look for suitable alternative buffer layers than the conventional CdS buffer layer. There are attempts reported in this direction but the efficiency achieved with alternative buffer layers is still far from the theoretical efficiency. Focus needs to be put on searching for a wide band gap material which is amorphous to neutralize the impact of lattice mismatch at the interface. The TiO2 buffer layer grown with amorphous phase has already shown efficiency improvements in the case of CIGS solar cells. Back contact instability with MoS2(Se)2 formation, leading to high series resistance, is another big hurdle in improving device efficiency. For efficient hole transport at the back contact, it is required to look for a high work function material that remains stable at high temperature. Materials like Ni with work function (5.2 eV) more than that of Mo (4.6–5 eV) can be used as a back contact, which will form ohmic contact with CZTS leading to efficient hole collection at the electrode. However, the diffusion of Ni into the absorber layer has been observed during high-temperature treatment of solar cells. Therefore, following a low-temperature formation path for CZTS may solve this issue. In situ oxidation of nickel alters the work function of NiO even more than 5.2 eV, which easily meets the demand of high work function material for the back contact.
Following the trends in CIGS, CdS has become an important component of CZTSSe solar cell structure; it is even fabricated with the same conventional CBD method. Although CBD is a simple chemical technique for thin film deposition, there is no control over the growth of the film. It is a requirement to have a thin and highly doped buffer layer for efficient separation and charge transport across the interface. Focus should be put on adopting some novel growth techniques with better control on film growth and quality. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be competitive tools in this area.
In the current scenario, another constraint is added by the lack of multi-domain interface probing facilities. There are efforts made in this direction using Raman scattering analysis of CZTSSe solar cell devices by varying laser excitations (442 nm, 532 nm, 785 nm) that gives structural information at different depths. This facility is still limited to the buffer/absorber interface and cannot probe all the interfaces due to lack of penetration depth of the laser. There is no characterization facility that can detect types of defects and defect density in working solar cells at the nanoscale across the interfaces. Also, the correlation of defects, defect density and band offset with induced stress at the interface is another big challenge. Ignoring the effect of interface stress leads to only an estimation of the band offsets by using the current state-of-the-art characterization techniques, not the exact or accurate values. Band offset measurements using XPS, where the core level is considered as reference, are not that accurate because the position of the core level changes due to the chemical shift caused by the impurities present. There is no one particular technique which can measure band offsets accurately, and only estimated values are reported in the literature. So, to improve CZTS solar cell efficiency it is required to comprehend the origin of defect states at the buffer/CZTS interface. Therefore, a combination of characterization techniques is needed that can give a 3D distribution of elements along the surface and across the interfaces at the same time with greater accuracy and can accommodate the information about the strain at the interface. Such a multi-domain facility can actually be revealed as the genesis for interface issues.

In the present study, the voltage deficit of ∼0.62 V in CZTSSe solar cells, which is considered as one of the main reasons for lower device efficiency than CIGS solar cells, is reviewed in detail. The carrier losses at different interfaces due to band offset, segregation of secondary phases, lattice mismatch and inefficient charge extraction have been extensively reviewed. CdS buffer layer offers higher lattice mismatch with CZTSSe absorber material and unfavorable band offset that finally cause lower device efficiency. Likewise, secondary phase segregation at absorber and back contact interface and formation of highly resistive MoS2(Se)2 layer hinder the charge collection efficiency. Therefore, different approaches to modify the buffer/absorber interface, replacement of CdS and the effectiveness of different intermediate layers to suppress the formation of MoS2(Se)2 and secondary phases were discussed in detail. Finally, the article concluded with future prospects and challenges, where different potential approaches were discussed to improve interfaces for significant enhancement in device performance. Carrier management through interface engineering via emerging materials will help to achieve ultra-high efficiency in CZTSSe material.
