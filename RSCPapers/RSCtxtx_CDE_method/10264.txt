Donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) systems typically used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been studied for assessing the donating strength of six donors (D1–D6) under the influence of substituents such as CH3, C5H11, isopropyl, t-butyl, OH, OCH3, OC2H5, NH2, N(CH3)2, PhCH3, and PhNH2 along with π-spacer butadiene and acceptor moiety cyanoacrylic acid. The substituent effect enhances electron donation from D to A through the π-spacer. The enhancement in electron density at A has been quantified in terms of the difference in the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) minimum at the cyano nitrogen (ΔVmA) between π–A and D–π–A. For unsubstituted D–π–A systems, ΔVmA is in the range −0.1 to −5.7 kcal mol−1, whereas the substitution enhances the negative character of ΔVmA in the range −0.8 to −8.0 kcal mol−1. In alkyls and Ph–CH3 substituted D–π–A systems, ΔVmA lies in the range −0.8 to −6.7 kcal mol−1, whereas the N(CH3)2 substituted systems exhibit more negative ΔVmA (more enhanced donating strength) in the range −5.1 to −8.0 kcal mol−1. The more negative value of ΔVmA implies the greater electron-donating ability of the D−π−A system. Optical and photovoltaic parameters (ΔGreg, ΔGinject, eVOC) are analyzed at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/SMD/cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of DFT. An excellent linear correlation is observed in all six sets between ΔVmA and the absorption maximum (λmax) showing that λmax increases with enhanced donating strength. The higher absorption maximum obtained by N(CH3)2 substituted D–π–A systems lies in the range 430 nm to 490 nm, explaining the outstanding donating ability of N(CH3)2 compared to other substituents. The reduced highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap (from 3.14 to 2.17 eV) with enhanced donating strength confirms the influence of substituent effects in broadening the absorption maximum. Furthermore, in photovoltaic parameters, a strong influence of the substituent effect is observed. The N(CH3)2 substituted D1–π–A (D1–N(CH3)2) exhibits the highest eVOC (1.38 eV). The strong linear correlation observed for the ground state property ΔVmA and open-circuit voltage eVOC provides guidelines for developing an effective strategy for designing dye sensitizers for desirable photovoltaic applications.

Over the past 30 years, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and their structural modification have become an emerging research area in the field of photovoltaics. DSSCs are considered as the most inventive candidate for the next generation of clean renewable sources due to their easier structure modification, simple synthetic strategy, large absorption coefficient, and low production cost. Nonetheless, the performance of DSSC is still in a bottleneck due to their lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the conventional silicon-based solar cells due to the inherent voltage loss during the dye regeneration and poor long term stability. In order to improve the PCE over conventional silicon-based solar cells, extensive research efforts like modification on electrolytes, semiconductors, and sensitizers have been executed and result in the development of new and efficient dye sensitizers. Among the DSSCs, the Ru based sensitizers achieved the best PCE of 11%, which attains a comparable PCE to a silicon-based solar cell. But due to the scarce resources and highly expensive nature of Ru metal, its practical application is limited, and more research efforts have resulted in the development of Ru-free organic sensitizers. However, the major challenge of organic solar cells is the enhancement of PCE, durability, and stability to compete with silicon-based solar cells. One of the key strategies for the synthesis of Ru free sensitizers is the designing of the D–π–A architecture, which enables efficient electron transfer from a donor (D) to the acceptor (A) through a spacer (π).

From the literature, it is understood that for the design of highly efficient photosensitizers, different kinds of building blocks such as donors, spacers, and anchoring units are required in the D–π–A architecture to tune the electronic structure of the synthesized product. The fine-tuning of the HOMO–LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of a photosensitizer is often achieved by adjusting the substituent effect on the donor by the incorporation of electron-donating/withdrawing groups. In most of the cases, the electron-donating groups on the donor moiety act as substituents and they have a profound impact on the electronic structure and efficiency of the desired dye sensitizer.A priori knowledge on the donating strength of the donor can become helpful for the prediction of the PCE of the designed/synthesized system. A quantitative/mathematical comparison of donating strength of the typically used donors is lacking in the literature.
Here we have selected six different donor systems (D1–D6), substituted with electron-donating groups such as CH3, C5H11, isopropyl, t-butyl, OH, OCH3, O-C2H5, NH2, N(CH3)2, N(C2H5)2, Ph-CH3, and Ph-NH2 to evaluate the donating strength on a π–A system made up of a butadiene π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid (Fig. 1). According to our previous study, the butadiene spacer is rated as having the highest substituent effect transmitting power compared to triple bonded, aromatic, and heteroaromatic conjugated systems. Hence this moiety is employed in the study as a π-spacer for effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and cyanoacrylic acid is used as an acceptor (A). The molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) topographical analysis is used as a tool to measure the electronic effect of the substituted D on the acceptor A. MESP is a well-established tool for deriving many structure–property relationships for chemical and biological systems. According to Scrocco, Tomasi, and coworkers, the MESP describes the charge distribution around a molecule and the regions with more negative MESP indicate the more electron-dense region of that system. Suresh and coworkers widely used MESP for the quantification of the substituent effect, inductive effect, resonance effect, trans influence, cation π-interaction,etc. In a recent study, we have shown that MESP analysis is very useful for assessing the donating strength of D in the D–π–A system. MESP becomes a new theoretical tool for predicting the feasibility of organic electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries, explained by Shang, Chen, and co-workers. The wide range of applications in various fields supports the validity of MESP based studies for analyzing the photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells. The present study focuses on the substituent effect in tuning various ground state electronic and photovoltaic properties of D–π–A systems for solar cell applications.

The three key parameters involved in the calculations of power conversion efficiency (η) of a solar cell include open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and the fill factor (FF). Thus, as compared to incident solar power on the cell (Pinc), the η can be calculated as

(1)
In the above equation, JSC is related to the interaction between a sensitizer and semiconductor. In DSSCs, JSC is calculated as
(2)
From the above equation, it is clear that JSC is related to the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) and electron injection efficiency ϕinject.

i.e., LHE = 1–10−f, where f represents the oscillator strength of the adsorbed dye molecule.
Furthermore, the electron injection efficiency ϕinject is related to electron injection-free energy change (ΔGinject), and the enhancement in the JSC can be carried out by the improvement of ΔGinject. Since electron injection takes place from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2, ΔGinject can be calculated as follows.
ΔGinject = Edye* − |ECB|
(3)
where
Edye* is the excited state oxidation potential and ECB is the energy of the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor. The negative ΔGinject values indicate that free energy change is spontaneous. It is well known that the conduction band (CB) of semiconductors is sensitive to conditions (e.g. pH of the solution) and it is very difficult to determine experimentally. Hence in this study, we used a widely accepted value of −4.00 eV (an experimental value where the semiconductor is in contact with aqueous redox electrolytes of fixed pH 7.0) for doing the calculations. For calculating Edye*, it is assumed that electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state and Edye* can be written as

Edye* = Edye − λmax
(4)
where
Edye is the ground state oxidation potential of the dye and λmax is the vertical transition energy. According to Koopman's theorem, the ground state oxidation potential can be calculated as negative HOMO energy, and this approximation has been giving good agreement with experimental results.

The excited state dye regeneration can be predicted from the ground state oxidation potential as follows.
ΔGreg = Edye − 4.8 eV
(5)
Thus from eqn (2)–(4), it is clear that JSC will increase with the enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency and ΔGinject.
Theoretically, the open-circuit voltage can be approximated as the difference between the energy of the LUMO of the dye and the energy of the conduction band edge of TiO2.
eVOC = ELUMO − ECB
(6)
Thus, the overall efficiency η of a solar cell can be enhanced by the improvement in JSC, eVOC and FF values. (Since FF can be calculated from current–voltage characteristics, it is beyond the scope of this study).
For the ground state geometry optimization of the D–π–A systems, the widely utilized B3LYP density functional theory (DFT) method with the cc-pVDZ basis set has been considered. Vibrational frequency calculation was also carried out at the same level of theory and basis set, and confirms that there are no imaginary frequencies. Absorption maxima and vertical excitation energies for the first seven states are calculated using time-dependent DFT at the CAM-B3LYP/SMD/cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. Here SMD stands for the incorporation of the solvation effect of dichloromethane in the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) approach as implemented in the Gaussian16 suite of programmes. The dependency of bond localization of single and double bonds in the ground state on the excited state properties has been analyzed using bond length alteration index (BLA). The BLA index for the unsubstituted D1 to D6–π–A systems are calculated with B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP geometries (Table S1 and Fig. S2, ESI). For all a positive BLA index has been observed and larger BLA index has been observed with CAM-B3LYP. This indicates that carbon–carbon single and double bonds are more localized with CAM-B3LYP than B3LYP. Also, the BLA index for the S1 state of a representative set of TPA systems has been calculated with CAM-B3LYP (Table S2, ESI). The reduced BLA index for S1 than the S0 state indicates the delocalized nature of the system and also supports the ICT transfer involved in D–π–A systems. Previously, Gonzáles et al. noted that B3LYP fails to predict the excitation energies due to its intrinsic problems in describing charge transfer (CT) states whereas the long-range correction on them using CAM delivers good agreement with the experimental UV/vis absorption. They also observed that excited state properties are highly dependent on the localization of single and double bonds in the ground state structure which can be quantified in terms of the BLA index. Our previous study also showed that the calculated absorption maximum of known D–π–A systems at the CAM-B3LYP/SMD/cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of theory agrees well with the experimental absorption maximum. The MESP, V(r) as defined in eqn (1) has been evaluated using the electron density ρ(r′) computed at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level.
The N in eqn (1) is the total number of nuclei present in the molecular system, ZA is the charge on the nucleus A at a distance RA and r′ is a dummy integration variable. All calculations have been carried out using the Gaussian 16 program package.

The MESP plot of two representative donors (D1 and D4) and their corresponding D–π–A systems (unsubstituted) are shown in Fig. 2 along with the respective MESP minimum (Vm) at various sites.

In donor systems, VmD′ represents Vm of the donor. For example, VmD′ of benzene (D1) and carbazole (D4) are −16.6 and −19.5 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2). In D–π–A systems, VmD and VmS represent the MESP minimum at the donor and spacer (nearer to D), respectively while Vm(OH), Vm(CO), and VmA represent the MESP minimum at the lone pair regions of OH, CO and CN of the acceptor moiety, respectively. Previous studies by Suresh and Gadre et al. have shown that lone pair regions in molecules can be characterized using MESP topographical analysis. The MESP minimum observed at the CN unit of π–A is considered as a reference value, VmA′ (Fig. 2a) (−50.3 kcal mol−1) to monitor the changes observed at this minimum due to the incorporation of D to π–A. One could also consider the MESP minimum Vm(OH)′ or Vm(CO)′ of π–A as a reference point similar to VmA′ because in general the trends observed for these quantities show a parallel behavior. Here VmA′ is selected as the reference point on the basis of its most negative character compared to all other minima.
In Table 1a and b, Vm of D–π–A systems at various sites viz. donor (VmD), spacer (VmS) and acceptor (Vm(OH), Vm(CO) and VmA) are reported along with VmD'. The unsubstituted D–π–A systems are denoted as D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and D6, and the substituents attached at D1–D6 are represented as D1–CH3, D1–C5H11, D2–CH3, D2–C5H11, etc. The quantities ΔVmD, ΔVmS, ΔVm(OH), ΔVm(CO), and ΔVmA represent the change in Vm at the respective sites with the attachment of π–A to D. ΔVmD has been calculated by subtracting the Vm observed at the donor (VmD') from the respective Vm observed at the D site of D–π–A (VmD). Likewise ΔVmS, ΔVm(OH), ΔVm(CO), and ΔVmA are estimated by subtracting the respective Vm at π–A viz. VmS′,Vm(OH′), Vm(CO′) and VmA′ (Fig. 2) from the corresponding values at D–π–A (VmS, Vm(OH), Vm(CO) and VmA) (Table 1a and b).

The data in Table 1a and b show that the VmD of the D–π–A system is always less negative than the VmD′ of the donor D. For various donor systems, ΔVmD lies in the range 5.6 to 14.9 kcal mol−1 which clearly suggests that the D site of the D–π–A system becomes electron deficient compared to a normal D. The electron deficiency at D can be attributed to ICT of electrons from D to the π–A region which implies that Vm at the acceptor sites of D–π–A becomes more negative compared to π–A and as a result always negative values are observed for ΔVm(OH), ΔVm(CO), and ΔVmA. For example, when π–A changes to D1–π–A, Vm at the cyano region turns out to be more negative (VmA = −52.8 kcal mol−1) than the respective Vm on the reference system (π–A), VmA' (−50.3 kcal mol−1). A similar trend in VmA is observed for all the remaining systems. Also compared to π–A, the π-spacer region of D–π–A shows more negative character for VmS in all cases except some of the coumarin-based systems. Among the donors, the VmD value is the least negative for coumarin systems, which can be attributed to the presence of an electron withdrawing carbonyl group in it. The quantities ΔVmS, ΔVm(OH), ΔVm(CO) and ΔVmA show a parallel trend as shown in the correlation plots given in Fig. 3a–c. This suggests that any of these quantities can be used as a parameter to measure the donating strength of donor moieties to a common acceptor. Here ΔVmA (for the CN group) is selected for this purpose. It may be noted that variation in ΔVmD is not similar to ΔVmA (Fig. S3, ESI) because it accounts for the property of various donors whereas ΔVmA accounts for the accepting ability of a CN unit from various donors.
In Table 1a and b, the lower ΔVmA in the range −0.2 to −5.1 kcal mol−1 have been attained by coumarin-based D–π–A systems which can be attributed to the presence of an electron-withdrawing CO group in the donor site. In benzene and pyrene based systems, the strong conjugation feature in donors increases the negative character of the ΔVmA values (−2.5 to −8.0 kcal mol−1) leading to better-donating strength than coumarin systems.
In carbazole and phenothiazine systems, the charge transfer to the acceptor is enhanced (ΔVmA −4.5 to −7.2 kcal mol−1) due to donation from hetero atoms viz. nitrogen and sulphur. Among all, the TPA based systems have the highest electron-donating strength (−5.7 to −8.0 kcal mol−1).
Substituents at the donor region can be utilized for tuning the electron-donating strength of the donor. For instance, alkyl substituents viz. CH3, C5H11, isopropyl, and t-butyl at the donor unit enhance the electron-donating strength of all the corresponding substituted D–π–A systems by a +I inductive effect. The substituents bearing lone pairs such as OH, OCH3, NH2, and N(CH3)2 improve the electron density of the donor unit, resulting in better electron-donating power than alkyl substituents (ΔVmA in the range −3.4 to −8.0 kcal mol−1) +R resonance effect. Among all, N(CH3)2 substituted benzene and TPA based D–π–A systems show the highest donation from donor to acceptor. The donating strength of various substituents attached on the D–π–A system follows the order PhCH3 ∼ alkyls < –OH, –OR, PhNH2 < NH2 < N(CH3)2.

In Table 2, the HOMO and LUMO energies, HOMO–LUMO energy gap (HLG), absorption maximum (λmax), and oscillator strength (f) of six different D–π–A systems with various substituents are reported. In all kinds of D–π–A systems, a systematic increase in λmax with respect to various substituents has been observed (388 to 490 nm), which can be correlated with the electron donating strength of the donors in the D–π–A system. This is evident in the excellent linear correlations between ΔVmA and λmax obtained for all six kinds of D–π–A systems (Fig. 4). Also with an improved electron-donating strength of a D–π–A system, lowering of HLG is noted in every system, which lies in the range 3.14 to 2.17 eV. Among all, the highest λmax 490 nm has been shown by (NH3)2 substituted phenothiazine system D5-N(CH3)2. For the six D–π–A systems and the selected eleven substituents, 102 nm width is available for tuning λmax to a preferred region. For individual donors, the substituent effect alone can account for a tuning width of 69 nm for benzene, 29 nm for pyrene, 19 nm for TPA, 42 nm for carbazole, 31 nm for phenothiazine and 57 nm for coumarin, respectively.

The ΔVmAversus λmax correlations given in Fig. 4 suggest that the substituent effects tune the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (HLG). The HLG plot of a representative system D5–π–A (phenothiazine-based) is given in Fig. 5 which shows that the introduction of substituents on the core D unit lowers the HLG from 2.41 to 2.17 eV. Poor electron-donating ability is observed in alkyls and PhCH3 substituted systems display higher HLG (2.40 to 2.41 eV), while the lowest HLG has been attained with N(CH3)2 substituted D5–π–A. A similar trend in HLG is observed for the remaining systems which confirms the significance of the substituent effect in tuning λmax (Table 3a and b). The HOMO and LUMO plots of the representative systems are shown in Fig. 6. The HOMO has a more delocalized distribution than the LUMO with more orbital contributions from the donor site while the LUMO is largely delocalized along the π-spacer and acceptor moiety.

In Table 3a and b, electronic excitation energy, ground state oxidation potential Edye, excited state oxidation potential Edye*, free energy change of electron injection ΔGinject, free energy change of dye regeneration ΔGreg, and open-circuit voltage eVOC of D–π–A systems are described. The negative ΔGinject observed in the range −0.73 to −1.65 eV lies above the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV) and indicates the possibility of a spontaneous electron injection process from CB to TiO2. Also a more electron-donating substituent enhances the electron injection process as ΔGinject becomes more negative with such substituents. Alkyls, and PhCH3 substituted D–π–A systems are less efficient for electron injection than the OH, OCH3, OC2H5, NH2 and N(CH3)2 substituted systems. Among all, the most negative ΔGinject −1.65 eV is observed for phenothiazine system D5–N(CH3)2. The smaller electron injection efficiency (−0.79 to −0.81 eV) observed for alkyls and PhCH3 substituted coumarin systems can be attributed to their lower electron-donating strength than others.

From the previous studies, it is understood that the PCE of DSSCs depends on the free energy change for dye regeneration. The lower the ΔGreg, the faster the dye regeneration will be, leading to higher efficiency for the electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 semiconductor. In the studied systems, the fastest dye regeneration force 0.08 eV has been attained by the N(CH3)2 substituted phenothiazine system (D5–N(CH3)2), whereas the least dye regeneration (1.27–1.29 eV) has been possessed by alkyls, and PhCH3 substituted coumarin systems. The unsubstituted systems always possess higher ΔGreg values (0.48–1.39 eV) than substituted ones (0.08–1.29 eV) and this suggests that the introduction of electron-donating substituents on the donor moiety gives better ΔGreg values and improves electron regeneration efficiency. Similarly, a positive effect of substituents on eVOC is always observed confirming that by tuning the donating strength of the substituents, significant improvement in the performance of DSSCs can be achieved. In all the six sets, N(CH3)2 substituted systems possess the best eVOC and among them, the highest is observed for D1–N(CH3)2 (1.38 eV) whereas the lowest eVOC (0.72 eV) is observed for D4-PhCH3.
By considering the above-mentioned results, we analyzed the relation between electron donating strength ΔVmA and open-circuit voltage eVOC (Fig. 7 and Fig. S1, ESI). The excellent linear correlation observed in all six series of different D–π–A systems shows that eVOC increases with enhancement in the donating strength of the substituents. Overall the study suggests that by selecting the appropriate donor and substituent, precise tuning of the optical and photovoltaic properties of the D–π–A systems can be achieved. Also these results point out that the theoretical examination of the donating strength of the substituents using MESP analysis is promising for dye designing and efficiency prediction of D–π–A systems.

The electron-donating strength of the donors in the D–π–A system affects the optical and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, leading to better PCE in the solar cell. In the study using MESP analysis, we have characterized the donating strength (ΔVmA) of six different sets of D–π–A systems, wherein the π and A systems are butadiene and cyanoacrylic acid, respectively. The significance of eleven electron releasing groups at the donors is also examined for a total of seventy-two D–π–A systems and achieved the fine-tuning of the electron donation from the donor to the acceptor. In all the six different sets of D–π–A systems, the N(CH3)2 substituted D–π–A systems show the highest donating strength which can be attributed to the highest electron releasing nature of the N(CH3)2 group. Also, the electron releasing groups at the donors tune the HOMO and LUMO energies of all the corresponding D–π–A systems for better optical properties than unsubstituted systems. The optical and photovoltaic performance of the D–π–A system is described at the CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ/SMD//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. The enhanced performance of these properties achieved with enhanced donating strength conveys the role of tuning the donating strength for better PCE. Among all, the N(CH3)2 substituted D1 system (benzene) possesses the highest eVOC which can be attributed to its highest donating strength. These findings suggest that we can improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs by tuning the ground state property, ΔVmA at the acceptor site. All the findings imply that incorporation of more electron-releasing substituents on an electron-rich donor moiety improves/tunes the photovoltaic performance by facilitating efficient intramolecular charge transfer in the D–π–A system. The correlation plot of ΔVmA with eVOC will provide an efficient guideline for developing an effective dye designing strategy for desirable photovoltaic properties.
