Three new small molecules, FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, were designed and synthesized by using a rigid dithienosilole trimer (tDTS) as the novel donor unit and 5-fluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT), 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) and 3-ethylrhodanine (RHO) as acceptor units, respectively. According to the density functional theory calculations, RHO–tDTS has a more rigid structure due to the linkage between the donor and acceptor units. As a result, RHO–tDTS exhibits a red-shifted absorption spectrum and a higher hole mobility in comparison with FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS. Small molecule solar cells based on RHO–tDTS show a power conversion efficiency of 7.56%, significantly performing better than the other two analogues. The mechanism of the good photovoltaic performance of RHO–tDTS was discussed. We also demonstrated that the end-capped groups on small molecules play an important role in tuning the performance of the organic photovoltaic devices.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted a great deal of attention because of their potential as low-cost and renewable energy sources. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 9% have been achieved for polymer-based OPVs (P-OPVs) in the past few years, showing their promise in commercial applications. Recently, considerable studies have focused on developing small-molecule-based OPVs (SM-OPVs) due to their advantages including defined structures, reproducibility, and ease of purification. Although the undesirable processability limited the performances of devices in most cases, several significant breakthroughs have been achieved, with PCEs of over 9% for single junction SM-OPVs in the last two years. Usually, small molecules for OPVs are designed as donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated structures to simultaneously obtain reduced bandgaps and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. Popular donor units include oligothiophene, benzodithiophene (BDT), dithienosilole (DTS),etc. In the aspect of the acceptor units, benzodiathiazole (BT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo (IID),etc., which are widely used in polymers, are also suitable for constructing small molecules used in OPVs. Different from the polymers, some end-capped units such as alkyl cyanoacetate, dicyanovinyl, rhodanine and its derivatives were introduced to construct A–D–A type molecules. Especially for the rhodanine-based small molecules, high PCEs comparable to the polymer materials have been achieved.

Compared with P-OPVs, SM-OPVs generally exhibit higher open-circuit voltages (Voc). As PCE = Voc × Jsc × FF/Pin, where Pin is the incident light intensity, improving the short-circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) while maintaining the Voc is a reasonable strategy to achieve high PCEs. In this work, we designed and synthesized the trimer of dithieno[3,2-b;2′3′-d]silole (DTS), namly tDTS, and then constructed a series of tDTS-based donor materials. The highly rigid and planar backbone of tDTS is supposed to facilitate the intramolecular π-delocalization and reduce the bandgap, resulting in the improvement of light harvesting. It is also supposed that the intermolecular π–π stacking is promoted, leading to high charge-carrier mobilities. Taking advantage of these properties, a high Jsc can be expected for the device using the tDTS-based small molecules. In addition, the 2-ethylhexyl side chains at Si atoms ensure the solubility in common processing solvents, which would be good for improving the FF. Because of the strong electron-donating properties of the DTS unit, the HOMO levels of tDTS-based molecules could be relatively high, which may result in low Voc values in the resultant devices. To compensate this undesired shift in HOMO levels, acceptor units with high electronic affinity, such as 5-fluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT) and 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT), are employed to construct A–D–A type compounds for high performance photovoltaics in this study. Moreover, the F atoms can simultaneously deepen the HOMO levels and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, ensuring suppressed charge recombination in the resultant devices. To the best of our knowledge, neither of them has been reported as the end-capped unit to date. On the other hand, considering that some dye units with strong electron-withdrawing ability, such as 3-ethylrhodanine, are very beneficial to obtain high Voc values and high absorption coefficients, we also chose it as the acceptor unit in this study. In this context, three A–D–A type small molecules, FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, were designed and synthesized. The chemical structures of FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS are shown in Scheme 1. It is worth noting that the three molecules are quite different in the D–A linkages. Both DFBT and FBT are connected to tDTS with C–C single bonds, while 3-ethylrhodanine is connected with an additional double bond. The two kinds of linkages, as well as the end-capped group effect will be systematically investigated.

The synthetic routes of tDTS, FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS are shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 2 and 3 were synthesized by the bromination and tributylstannylation of 1, respectively. tDTS was obtained via the Stille coupling reaction of compound 2 with 3. The tributylstannylation of tDTS gave compound 4. FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS were obtained via the Stille coupling reaction of compound 4 with 6 and 7, respectively. The formylation of tDTS via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction yielded compound 5. The Knoevenagel condensation of 5 and 3-ethylrhodanine afforded RHO–tDTS. The three final compounds, FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, are all soluble in the common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene.

The thermal stability of the three small molecules was investigated by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The decomposition temperatures (Td, corresponding to the onset point of 5% weight loss) are 418, 423 and 404 °C for FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, respectively, indicating that these small molecules are stable enough for the application in solar cells.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to examine the geometries and the electronic structures of FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS. In order to simplify the calculation, each alkyl is replaced with methyl. As shown in Fig. 1, the optimized geometries of the three molecules show nearly planar backbones, which are helpful to the charge-carrier transport. Their electronic structures are almost similar. Both the LUMO and the HOMO distribute in the whole molecules, indicating strong electronic delocalization.

The twisting potentials of the three molecules were also calculated to evaluate their rigidity. As shown in Fig. 2, there is only a slight difference in the twisting potentials between FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS. However, much more energy is required to twist RHO–tDTS, the 3-ethylrhodanine end-capped molecule. The much higher twisting potential of RHO–tDTS indicates it has a more rigid backbone. For the three molecules with the same core of tDTS, the difference in rigidity can be attributed to the different end-capped groups. FBT or DFBT is connected to tDTS with only a C–C single bond, while 3-ethylrhodanine with a single and a double bond in tandem that increases the rigidity of RHO–tDTS.


Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the compounds. All of them display a strong single peak in dilute CHCl3 solutions. RHO–tDTS shows a red-shifted band compared with the other two, which indicates a stronger intramolecular charge transfer. The spectra in the films all show obvious broadening and red-shift compared with their corresponding solutions. Different from FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS, RHO–tDTS in the film displays an absorption spectrum with two distinct peaks. The additional peak at 671 nm implies a more ordered molecular packing and stronger intermolecular π–π interactions, which can be attributed to the higher rigidity of RHO–tDTS. This is in accordance with the calculated results of the twisting potentials. The optical bandgaps calculated from the absorption onset are 1.75, 1.76 and 1.67 eV for FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, respectively. The detailed data are summarized in Table 1.

To estimate the frontier energy levels of these small molecules, their oxidation potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S2, see the ESI). The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from the equations of EHOMO = −(Eonset(ox) + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = (Eoptg + EHOMO) eV, respectively. The detailed data are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO levels of FBT–tDTS and DTBT–tDTS are −4.84 and −4.86 eV, respectively. Since RHO–tDTS has a slightly lower HOMO level of −4.92 eV, 3-ethylrhodanine may be a stronger electron-acceptor than fluorobenzothiadiazoles. In addition, RHO–tDTS based devices can be expected to obtain higher Voc due to its lower HOMO level.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the small molecules, the devices were initially fabricated with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al, where the active layer was spin-cast from the chloroform solution of small molecules and PC71BM with an optimized weight ratio of 1:1. The device using RHO–tDTS as a donor shows the highest PCE of 1.57%, while the other devices based on FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS exhibit PCEs of 0.92% and 1.03%, respectively. Although the devices exhibit moderate Vocs, the low Jscs and FFs lead to the poor efficiencies (shown in Table 2).

To further improve the performance of the devices, the solvent annealing was applied to the active layers. After exposing the active layers to dichloromethane (DCM) vapor for 30 s, the improved PCEs were achieved for all the devices with the three donor materials. For FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS, the PCEs were increased to 1.16% and 1.87%, respectively. Remarkably, the PCE of the devices with RHO–tDTS was significantly increased to 7.43%, which was almost five times as high as the PCE without solvent annealing. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices without and with solvent annealing are displayed in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the detailed results are summarized in Table 2. To further investigate the device performance, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured (Fig. 5). The device with RHO–tDTS exhibits the broadest response ranging from 300 to 800 nm, which agrees well with the optical bandgap. After the solvent annealing, the IPCE is boosting above 40% from 400 to 700 nm, which leads to the highest Jsc. The calculated Jsc values obtained by the integration of the IPCE data for these devices showed a minor mismatch (2–5%) compared with the Jsc value from the J–V curve, indicating a high accuracy of the J–V measurements.

The effect of solvent annealing is investigated via both atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (shown in Fig. 6) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The blend films of PC71BM and donors without any treatment exhibit a very smooth surface with root-mean-square (RMS) values of 0.540, 0.578 and 0.562 nm for FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, respectively. Such a uniform morphology and a smooth surface may limit the exciton dissociation, leading to low photocurrent. In contrast, after solvent annealing, DCM vapor can penetrate into the donor/PC71BM blend, causing the reorganization of the films and modification in the nanomorphology with increased RMS values of 5.679, 1.470 and 1.026 nm for FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, respectively. These changes may improve the exciton dissociation. The XRD patterns of the films are shown in Fig. S3–S5 (ESI). The films of all pure donors showed good crystallinity, indicated by strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 6.1°, 5.7° and 5.4° for FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, respectively. When blended with PC71BM, all of these pristine blend films showed a much weaker diffraction feature, suggesting the existence of disordered packing. After dichloromethane solvent vapour treatment for 30 seconds, the blend film based on RHO–tDTS shows a noticeable diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.3°, implying an increasing crystallinity, while the other two films only show featureless diffraction patterns. The XRD results are in good agreement with the device performance upon considering that a drastic improvement was only observed in the RHO–tDTS based devices after solvent annealing.


Given the important role of charge transport properties in ruling the performance of the photovoltaic devices, the effective hole and electron mobilities of the three devices were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al. The detailed data of SCLC are summarised in Table S1 (ESI). Derived from Fig. 4c and d, after solvent annealing, for the devices based on FBT–tDTS, DFBT–tDTS and RHO–tDTS, the hole mobilities are 8.71 × 10−5, 3.46 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobilities are 2.86 × 10−4, 1.98 × 10−4 and 2.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher value of both hole and electron mobilities for RHO–tDTS should result from its higher rigidity and preferable molecular packing. These results also agree well with the DFT calculations, absorption spectra and XRD patterns. To investigate the origin of the observed significant improvement in the RHO–tDTS based device upon solvent annealing, the charge-carriers of the pristine blend film were also measured. The hole and electron mobilities are 1.03 × 10−5 and 7.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is worth noting that the ratios of electron and hole mobilities (μe:μh) are 7.15 and 2.73 for pristine and annealing blend films. Obviously, the blend films show much higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities after solvent annealing, thus responsible for the increase of Jsc and FF.


In conclusion, we reported the rigid dithienosilole trimer (tDTS) as a new donor unit for the construction of small-molecule donor materials in organic photovoltaics. Both the calculated and the experimental results demonstrate that different linkages between the donor and acceptor units affect the photophysical properties and the photovoltaic performances of the materials significantly. Compared with FBT–tDTS and DFBT–tDTS, RHO–tDTS with a vinyl linkage has a more rigid backbone which makes it exhibit a broader absorption as well as higher crystallinity and charge-carrier mobility. As a result, the RHO–tDTS based device achieved the highest PCE of 7.56% after solvent annealing. These encouraging results indicate that tDTS is a promising donor unit for designing new OPV materials.
