A new family of linear structure Pt(II) (triphenylamine alkynyl) 2(triethyl-phosphine) (2-carboxy-2-cyanovinyl-X-alkynyl) (where X = thiophene (PT1), [2, 2′]-bi-thiophene (PT2) or 1,2-di(2-thienyl)ethylene) (PT3)) complexes have been synthesized and characterized. The introduction of thiophene π-bridges enhanced the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecules, so their maximum absorption peaks were red shifted. These complexes have been tested as dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) sensitizers. PT2 showed the best photovoltaic performance, yielding 4.21% power conversion efficiency using a volatile electrolyte. As shown in an electrochemical impedance experiment, the different charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the three sensitizers influences their injection lifetime of electrons and then their photoelectrical properties.


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) provide an economically credible alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices. Owing to their high energy conversion efficiency and low production cost, they have received considerable attention over the past two decades. The mesoscopic texture of the TiO2 film in these cells significantly increases the cross-section of light harvesting by surface-anchored charge-transfer sensitizers, while maintaining a good contact with electrolytes. In DSSCs, dye molecules anchored to the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 absorb visible light and then inject electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 in their excited states. The photo-sensitizers based on Ru-complexes such as the Black Dye show a recorded solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 11.18%. Other metal complexes-based dyes have also been investigated, including the complexes of Fe, Os,Cu and Re. Recently, the synthesis of transition-metal dye molecules as DSSC sensitizers has received much attention. For example, platinum compounds have been investigated for their use in solar cells as they possess a number of key features possible as sensitizers. These include an absorption band in the visible region with a relatively large molar extinction coefficient and in some cases, luminescent properties in fluid solution. Further optimization of the molecular structure for platinum complex sensitizers is inevitable because of the current relatively lower conversion efficiency.

In our previous work, a platinum acetylide sensitizer was designed and an overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 3.28% was achieved. However, the narrow UV-Vis absorption spectrum limited the improvement of its photoelectric conversion efficiency. It is well established that thiophene,thienothiophene and alkoxybenzene derived units would be good candidates for increasing the conjugation length of the ancillary ligand to enhance the light-harvesting and red-shifting of the MLCT band of a ruthenium complex. Accordingly, it is interesting to extend the conjugated system of the ligand using such units to enhance the molar extinction coefficient as well as broaden the absorption region. Here we report the synthesis of three new linear structure platinum sensitizers (PT1, PT2 and PT3) incorporating different thiophene groups and their photovoltaic performance in DSSCs. The molecular structures of the three platinum complexes are shown in Scheme 1. The introduction of thiophene serial groups effectively broadens the sensitizer absorption spectra in the range of longer wavelength, namely band gap narrowing.

The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported relative to residual solvent signals, and 31P NMR resonances are referenced to an internal standard sample of 85% H3PO4 (δ 0.0). The absorption spectra of sensitizer dyes in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using a three-electrode cell in acetonitrile solvent with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as supporting electrolyte, TiO2 films stained with sensitizer as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The SCE reference electrode was calibrated using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as an external standard.


The FTO conducting glass (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide over-layer, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 15 Ω square−1) was obtained from the Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. of China. Titania pastes of DSL 90T were purchased from Dyesol. Lithium iodide was from Fluka and iodine, 99.999%, was from Alfa Aesar. 1-Butyl-3-methyleimidazolium iodide (BMII) was prepared according to published procedures.


A screen-printed layer of TiO2 particles was used as the photoelectrode. A 15 μm thick film of DSL 90T was printed on the FTO conducting glass. The electrodes coated with TiO2 pastes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min. Before immersion in the dye solution, these films were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Then the films were heated again at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye in acetonitrile for 12 h at room temperature. To prepare the counter electrode, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by spin coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. A hole (0.8 mm diameter) was drilled on the counter electrode by a drill-press. The perforated sheet was cleaned by ultrasound in an ethanol bath for 10 min. As for the assembly of DSSCs, the dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (DuPont). The size of the TiO2 electrodes used was 0.25 cm2 (i.e., 5 mm × 5 mm). A drop of the electrolyte was put on the hole in the back of the counter electrode, which was introduced into the cellvia vacuum backfilling. The hole in the counter electrode was sealed by a film of Surlyn 1702 and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness) using a hot iron bar.


The electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.5 M MPII (1-methyl-3-propyl- imidazolium iodide), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M GuSCN (guanidinium thiocyanate) and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine in acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (v:v = 7:3). For the quasi-solid-state electrolyte, the molar ratio of the components is BMII (1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide):I2:BI (benzimidazole):GuSCN = 24:1:2:0.4).


The current–density voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured by recording J–V curves using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM 1.5 G simulated solar light (Newport-91160 equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp and an AM 1.5 G filter). The incident light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard silicon solar cell (Newport 91150V). Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Newport-71640). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The frequency range is 0.10 Hz–100 kHz. The applied voltage bias is −0.70 V with a magnitude of the alternative signal of 10 mV.


All reactions were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen unless stated otherwise. Precursors 1 and 3a–c were prepared according to the literature procedures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled from sodium/benzophenone. Diethylamine (Et2NH) was dried from potassium hydroxide. Both THF and Et2NH were degassed by nitrogen (N2) for 30 min before use. All other reagents were purchased and used without further purification.

Synthesis of Compound 2: A 200 ml Schlenk flask, charged with 1 (500 mg, 1.86 mmol), trans-diiodobis (triethylphosphine) platinum (2.54 g, 3.71 mmol), and cuprous iodide (35.3 mg, 10 mol%), was degassed and back-filled with N2 three times. Then diethylamine (50 mL) and dried THF (50 mL) were introduced into the reaction flask by syringe. The reaction mixture was stirred under an inert atmosphere at room temperature for 2.5 h. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give 2 as a yellow solid. Yield: 1.13 g, 73.6%.

The chemical structures and the synthetic pathways of the desired platinum acetylide complexes are shown in Scheme 2. The starting materials, (4-ethynylphenyl) diphenylamine (1),5-ethynylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3a),5′-ethynyl-[2,2′] bithiophene-5-carbaldehyde (3b), and 5-[2-(5-ethynylthiophen-2-yl)vinyl] thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3c), were synthesized according to previous literature, respectively. The precursor 2 was prepared by the reaction of 1 with trans-[Pt(PEt3)2I2] in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper(I) iodide. Subsequent coupling reaction with the corresponding aldehydes under a conventional cross-coupling condition resulted in the compounds 4a–c in good yield, respectively. The target products were then obtained by the reaction of the corresponding precursors with cyanoaceticacid by the Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of piperidine in high yields (90%–94%). The molecular structures of the new compounds were characterized by using multiple nuclear NMR (1H, 31P, and 13C) and high resolution mass spectroscopy (HR MALDI-MS). The 31P{1H}NMR spectra of PT1, PT2, and PT3 displayed a sharp singlet (ca. 12.22 ppm for PT1, 11.96 ppm for PT2, and 11.87 ppm for PT3), respectively, shifted down field from the starting platinum compound 2 by approximately 3.0 ppm due to the electron withdrawing by the large π-conjugated bridges.



Fig. 1a shows the UV-Vis spectra of PT1, PT2, and PT3 in dichloromethane (DCM) solution (3 × 10−5 M). The data are collected in Table 1. In the UV-Vis spectra, PT1–PT3 exhibit two major prominent bands, appearing at 300–400 nm and at 400–600 nm, respectively. The former is ascribed to a localized aromatic π–π* transition and the latter is of intramolecular charge-transfer character. The absorption maxima for PT1–PT3 in CH2Cl2 are at λ = 462 nm, 510 nm and 528 nm in the visible region, respectively. Compared with PT1, PT2 and PT3 have [2,2′]-bithiophene and 1,2-di(2-thienyl)ethylene groups in conjugated chains, which enhance the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecules, so their maximum absorption peaks were red shifted. In comparison with conventional ruthenium complexes (for example, 1.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm for N3) the present dye molecules show about twice as high absorption coefficients. The greater maximum absorption coefficients of the sensitizers allow a correspondingly thinner nanocrystalline film so as to avoid the decrease of the film mechanical strength. This also benefits the electrolyte diffusion in the film and reduces the recombination possibility of the light-induced charges during transportation. The threshold wavelengths of the absorption spectra for PT1, PT2 and PT3 are 594, 630 and 671 nm, respectively, indicating that the introduction of a thiophene, [2,2′]-bithiophene or 1,2-di(2-thienyl)ethylene unit into the molecular structure of the sensitizers expanded the conjugation resulting in a wide absorption in the longer wavelength region.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra for the dye-loaded TiO2 film (∼5 μm) with a bare TiO2 film as the reference are shown in Fig. 1b. Upon dye adsorption onto the TiO2 surface, the maximum absorption blue-shifted by 7, 50 and 59 nm for PT1, PT2, and PT3 as compared to the spectra in solution (Fig. 1a), respectively. Such blue shifts would result from the solvent effect, deprotonation of the carboxylic acid upon dye attachment to the TiO2 surface, and/or H-aggregation of dye molecules.

Suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the sensitizer are required to match the conduction band (CB) edge level of the TiO2 electrode. To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band (Ecb) of TiO2, cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 2) for three dyes absorbed on the TiO2 films were measured. The E1/2 of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was found to be 0.39 V versus the SCE reference electrode. It can be speculated from Fig. 2 that the first half-wave potentials of PT1–PT3 are 0.80, 0.82 and 0.76 V (vs.Fc/Fc+). Therefore, the ground state oxidation potentials corresponding to the HOMO levels are 0.81, 0.83 and 0.77 V (vs.NHE), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the absorption thresholds for dyes PT1–PT3 are 594, 630 and 671 nm on TiO2 film, which correspond to the band gap energy (E0-0) of 2.08, 1.96 and 1.84 eV, respectively. The estimated excited state potentials corresponding to the LUMO levels, calculated from EHOMO − E0-0, are −1.27, −1.13 and −1.07 V, respectively. The examined HOMO levels and the LUMO levels are listed in Table 1. From these data, we found the HOMO levels of PT1–PT3 to be sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V), indicating that the oxidized dyes formed after electron injection into the CB of TiO2 could thermo-dynamically accept electrons from I− ions. The LUMO levels of these dyes (see Table 1) were sufficiently more negative than the conduction-band-edge energy level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs.NHE), which implies that electron injection from the excited dye into the CB of TiO2 is feasible.



Fig. 3 shows incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for DSSCs based on the dyes using liquid electrolyte. In good agreement with the UV-Vis absorption result (Fig. 1), the IPCE action spectra for DSSCs based on PT2 and PT3 are broader than that for the DSSC based on PT1. From Fig. 3 we can see that all three dyes can efficiently convert visible light to photocurrent in the region from 400 nm to 700 nm. The IPCE of PT1 reached a maximum (66.2%) at 440 nm. The IPCE exceeds 60% in the spectral range 350–550 nm for PT2 with a higher IPCE value plateau from 430–520 nm. And the maximum IPCE of PT3 is very similar to PT1 but its spectrum is widest among three dyes. The maximum IPCEs for the three DSSCs increased in the order of PT1 < PT3 < PT2. The difference of maximum IPCE arises from three factors (i.e., the difference between the LUMO and the conduction band edge (Table 1), the absorption capacity (Fig. 1 and Table 1), and the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film (Table 2)).

Fig. 4 showed the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of three DSSCs based on PT1, PT2 and PT3. Analysis of the J–V curves indicates that PT2 yields the highest photocurrent and Voc among the three dyes. The photovoltaic characteristic parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, we obtained a solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 2.17% (Jsc = 5.29 mA cm−2, Voc = 589 mV, ff = 0.70), 4.21% (Jsc = 9.32 mA cm−2, Voc = 659 mV, ff = 0.69) and 3.12% (Jsc = 7.99 mA cm−2, Voc = 587 mV, ff = 0.67) with DSSCs based on PT1–PT3, respectively. The Jsc enhancement for PT2 can be correlated with the higher molar extinction coefficient, IPCE value and the the amount adsorbed on the TiO2 films (see in Table 2). The amount of the adsorbed dye on TiO2 was determined by a spectroscopic method by measuring the concentration of dye desorbed on the titania surface into a mixed solution of 0.1 M NaOH and ethanol (1:1 in volume fraction). For further studying the correlation between charge-transfer processes and photovoltaic properties in the DSSC devices with different sensitizers from PT1 to PT3, electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) were measured in the dark at a forward bias of −0.70 V.

EIS is a steady-state method measuring the current response to the application of an AC voltage as a function of the frequency. An important advantage of EIS is the possibility of using tiny AC voltage amplitudes exerting a very small perturbation on the system. The Nyquist diagram features typically three semicircles that in the order of increasing frequency are attributed to the Nernst diffusion within the electrolyte, the electron transfer at the oxide/electrolyte interface, and the redox reaction at the platinum counter electrode. Parameters to illustrate the electron transport and recombination process are usually used, the Ohmic serial resistance (Rs), the electron transport resistance through the semiconductor is defined as Rt and the interfacial charge recombination reaction of electrons with the I3− ions can be described by a charge transfer resistance (Rct), respectively. The ZSimpWin software was used to fit the experimental data of DSSCs with various sensitizers.
The Nyquist plots (Fig. 5a) show the radius of the middle semicircle as increasing in the order PT1 < PT3 < PT2 (corresponding Rct data were 11.55 Ω, 26.61 Ω and 13.72 Ω with different sensitizers in Table 3), indicating that the electron recombination resistance augments in the order of PT1, PT3 and PT2. The electron lifetime values derived from curve fitting are 9, 54 and 19 ms from PT1 to PT3, respectively. The longer electron lifetime observed with PT2 relative to PT1 or PT3-sensitized cells indicates more effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electron with the I3− in the electrolyte and is reflected in the improvements seen in the photocurrent or photovoltage, yielding substantially enhanced device efficiency. The Bode phase plots shown in Fig. 5b likewise support the differences in the electron lifetime for TiO2 films derived with the three dyes. The middle-frequency peak of the DSSCs based on PT2 shifts to lower frequency relative to PT1 and PT3, indicating a shorter lifetime for the latter species.

To replace the low boiling point solvent in an electrolyte with an ionic liquid is an inevitable trend of research in DSSCs for improving its stability. In this paper, we characterized the DSSC devices of three sensitizers with ionic liquid electrolyte.

As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 4, these cells have a solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 1.85% (Jsc = 4.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 579 mV, ff = 0.67), 3.12% (Jsc = 7.43 mA cm−2, Voc = 636 mV, ff = 0.66) and 2.12% (Jsc = 6.02 mA cm−2, Voc = 565 mV, ff = 0.62) with DSSCs based on PT1–PT3, respectively. The photocurrent action spectrum of DSSCs with PT1, PT2 and PT3 is shown in Fig. 7. For PT2 with the highest conversion efficiency, IPCEs exceed 50% from 420 to 560 nm and have efficient photoelectric response between 350 and 700 nm. All action spectra are similar with to the UV-Vis spectrum for PT1–PT3 sensitizers indicating that the photoelectric effect is caused by the absorption of photons.

In summary, a new series of platinum acetylide complexes containing thiophene groups were designed and synthesized as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. As a result, platinum complex PT2 with [2,2′]-bithiophene obtained the highest solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 4.21% with a volatile electrolyte. The superior optical performance for PT2 can be explained from the two aspects of photocurrent and open circuit voltage. The improvement of photocurrent can be due to its wider absorption spectrum, higher molar extinction coefficient and adsorption amount compared with PT1 and mainly to its adsorption capacity compared with PT3 because the ratio of the adsorption amount of PT3 with PT2 is almost equal to their photocurrent density (Jsc). The increase of open circuit voltage is attributed to its high electron recombination resistance (Rct) which reduces the excited state electron recombination probability, improving the electronic lifetime and leading to upper shift of the conduction band energy level of TiO2. The results clearly demonstrate that the introduction of bithiophene π-bridges into platinum acetylide sensitizers can obviously extend the conjugated system and enhance the molar extinction coefficient as well as broaden the absorption region, and then improve their photovoltaic performance in DSSCs. These findings will enrich the research field of platinum complex dyes for DSSCs and gain more information on the structure-property relationships.
