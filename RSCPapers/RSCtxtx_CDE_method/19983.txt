Developing novel building blocks is essentially important to construct high-performance non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFEAs). Benzotrithiophene (BTT) as an electron-donating block has been widely applied in active materials to obtain high-performance organic field-effect transistors. However, its application in NFEAs for organic solar cells (OSCs) has rarely been reported so far. In this work, two NFEAs, BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN, were synthesized by combining BTT as a central unit with two terminal groups. Compared with BTTBo-4F, BTTBo-4FN exhibited stronger absorption, a narrower optical bandgap, and more ordered face-to-face π-stacking. As a consequence, the BTTBo-4FN-based OSCs achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.60%, whereas the BTTBo-4F-based OSCs achieved a moderate PCE of 8.27%. Further investigation revealed that the BTTBo-4FN-based OSCs exhibited a more efficient charge transfer, lower charge recombination, higher charge mobility, and better phase morphology than the latter. Our findings indicate that combining BTT as a central unit with π-extension terminal groups is a promising strategy to construct high-performance NFEAs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have tremendous potential for applications in the development of flexible solar panels and building-integrated photovoltaics due to their unique properties, such as flexibility, low weight, and semitransparency. The mainstream of an active layer with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro-structure used for OSCs contains a polymer donor and a small-molecular acceptor. The innovation of non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFEAs) is an alternative strategy and has boosted the development of OSCs to a new stage. The core engineering and terminal-group engineering of NFEAs enable diversiform chemical structures, tunable energy levels, and strong absorption, contributing to further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs over 18%. Therefore, developing novel building blocks is essentially important to construct high-performance NFEAs.

Benzotrithiophene (BTT) is a strong electron-donating block, which is formed by three thiophene units fused to a central benzene core. BTT has been widely applied in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and can achieve a hole mobility of up to 0.24 cm2 V−1 s−1. When used as the central core of NFEAs, BTT can exert its versatile advantages, since the molecule backbone of BTT is rigid and exhibits little steric hindrance, providing an ideal coplanar skeleton for application as the central unit of NFEAs. On the one hand, to attain suitable energy levels, solubility, and enable the formation of strong intramolecular push–pull interactions to broaden absorption in the near-infrared region, an acyl electron-withdrawing group can be incorporated into BTT. On the other hand, an asymmetrical electron cloud distribution of BTT promotes the dipole moment and improves the exciton dissociation efficiency. Given the excellent physical properties, BTT has emerged as a promising unit to construct high-performance NFEAs.

An alternative effective strategy to modulate the photoelectrical properties and packing behaviours of NFEAs is the modification of their terminal groups, such as by the introduction of halogen atoms and incorporation of π-extension terminal groups. Marks and co-workers systematically investigated the influence of π-extension terminal groups on the molecular packing and photovoltaic performance. Recently, Huang and co-workers introduced π-extension terminal groups into NFEAs and recorded an excellent photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 14.53%. These studies highlight the potential of terminal engineering for the construction of highly efficient NFEAs.
Based on the above considerations, a novel central core with BTT as the central unit was designed and synthesized. Two NFEAs, denoted BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN, were obtained by grafting 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (IC-2F) and its corresponding π-extension terminal group, (2-(6,7-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta-[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene) malononitrile (NC-2F)), onto the central core, respectively. In contrast, BTTBo-4FN exhibited stronger absorption, a narrower optical bandgap, and more ordered face-to-face π-packing than BTTBo-4F. As a result, the BTTBo-4FN-based OSCs achieved a high PCE of 11.60% while a PCE of 8.27% was obtained for the BTTBo-4F-based device. Further investigation revealed that the BTTBo-4FN-based device exhibited more efficient charge transfer, lower charge recombination, higher charge mobility, and better phase morphology. Our findings indicate that combining BTT as a central unit with π-extension terminal groups is a promising strategy to construct high-performance NFEAs.

The synthetic routes for BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN are depicted in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 to 5 were synthesized according to previously reported procedure. Compounds 6 and 7 were successively prepared via conventional Stille coupling and Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with high yields of 76% and 80%, respectively. Finally, the target products, BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were separately obtained via Knoevenagel condensation between compound 7 and two terminal groups, IC-2F and NC-2F. The chemical structures of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S6, ESI). Both synthetic molecules showed high solubility at room temperature in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, which is conducive to fabrication of high-quality films by solution processing method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere to determine the thermodynamic properties of both synthetic products. The decomposition temperatures of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were 361 °C and 364 °C with 5% weight loss, respectively (Fig. S7a, ESI). Distinct crystallization peaks were observed at 219 °C in the DSC curves for both BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN (Fig. S7b, ESI) during the cooling stage at a cooling rate of 20 °C min−1. However, during the heating stage, BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN exhibited different glass transition temperatures of 136 °C and 170 °C, respectively, and the same melting temperature of ∼235 °C. These observations indicate that BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN in the solid state possessed different aggregation behaviors.

Optimized structural conformations and energy levels of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were evaluated by B3LYP/6-31G(d) density functional theory calculations. All alkyl chains in the two molecules were replaced with methyl groups to reduce the calculation time. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI), both molecules had perfect planar backbone configurations. From the atomic charge distribution visualization, the asymmetry of the BTT central unit was clear in both molecules. Dipole moments of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were calculated to be 2.18 and 2.72 Debye, respectively, which is beneficial to exciton dissociation. Moreover, the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) were calculated to be −3.81/−5.74 eV for BTTBo-4F and −3.80/−5.70 eV for BTTBo-4FN, indicating that different terminal groups have a more significant effect on the HOMO energy levels than the LUMO levels in this system regardless of more delocalized electrons along the core of the former molecule.

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded to investigate the optical properties of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN. As shown in Fig. 1a, in chloroform solution, BTTBo-4F absorbed strongly in the range of 550–770 nm with the maximum absorption (λmax) at 705 nm and a maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.88 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Relative to BTTBo-4F, the absorption band and λmax of BTTBo-4FN were red-shifted by ∼22 nm, and εmax increased sharply to 2.15 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (Table 1). In the form of thin films, the absorption bands of BTTBo-4F (530–853 nm) and BTTBo-4FN (550–886 nm) were remarkably red-shifted and broadened compared with the absorption bands recorded for their solution forms, indicating a strong π–π stacking of both NFEAs in the solid state. Specifically, λmax for BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were located at 738 and 763 nm, respectively. The optical bandgaps (Eg) of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were separately estimated to be 1.45 and 1.40 eV via the thin-film absorption onsets. These observations confirmed the effectiveness of π-extension of the terminal groups for red-shifting of the absorption wavelengths and for better photon capture. The PBDB-T film exhibits an absorption band ranging from 450 nm to 680 nm, which complements the absorption ranges of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN (Fig. 1a), making it an ideal candidate as an electron donor in the fabrication of OSCs.

The energy levels of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry are shown in Fig. 1b. Ferrocene/ferrocenium was used as a reference with an oxidation potential of 0.39 V. The oxidation/reduction potentials of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were 1.15/−0.56 V and 1.07/−0.55 V, respectively. The corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.56/−3.85 eV for BTTBo-4F and −5.48/−3.86 eV for BTTBo-4FN. A similar LUMO energy level and higher HOMO level of BTTBo-4FN in comparison to that of BTTBo-4F endowed BTTBo-4FN with a narrower bandgap. These observations corroborate the DFT calculations. In addition, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PBDB-T were −5.33/−3.53 eV, which matched well with those of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN (Fig. 1c).

The photovoltaic properties of BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN were investigated by fabricating OSCs with the conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T:NFEA/poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Ag (Fig. 1d). Detailed fabrication processes and optimization conditions are summarized in the Supporting Information (Tables S1 and S2, ESI). The active layers of the two optimal devices were processed in chlorobenzene solution with a donor/acceptor ratio of 1:1.5 and 0.5% (vol%) 1-chloronaphthalene as the solvent additive and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimal devices are presented in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The BTTBo-4F-based device had a moderate PCE of 8.27% at an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.85 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.04 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 64.61%. In contrast, the BTTBo-4FN-based device achieved a higher PCE of 11.60%, which was mainly attributable to the increased JSC (19.56 mA cm−2) and FF (70.47%).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the corresponding JSC curves are presented in Fig. 2b. The photoresponse range of the BTTBo-4F-based device was 300–830 nm, whereas that of the BTTBo-4FN-based device was remarkably extended by approximately 40 nm into the near-infrared region, which was in line with the absorption spectra recorded for the films of both compounds. In addition, higher EQE values were obtained for the BTTBo-4FN-based device across the entire photoresponse range than for the BTTBo-4F-based device, indicating the more efficient photon-to-electron conversion of the former one. The integrated JSC values from the EQE plots for the BTTBo-4F- and BTTBo-4FN-based devices were calculated to be 14.36 and 18.91 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the results obtained from the J–V curve (within a 5% error).

The influence of terminal groups on the exciton dissociation and charge collection behaviors was explored by plotting the measured photocurrent density (Jph) vs. the effective applied voltage (Veff). Normally, in the saturated photocurrent (Jsat) region, all excitons dissociate into free charge carriers and are collected by electrodes. The maximum photoinduced carrier generation rates (Gmax) thus could be determined in terms of the number of absorbed photons, and Gmax was calculated using the equation: Gmax = Jsat/(qL), where q is the elementary charge and L is the film thickness. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Jsat for the BTTBo-4F-based device was obtained with the value of 16.01 mA cm−2 at Veff = 2 V and the corresponding Gmax was calculated to be 1.00 × 1028 m−3 s−1. Compared with BTTBo-4F, the Jsat of the BTTBo-4FN-based device was dramatically improved to 19.88 mA cm−2, and its Gmax reached 1.24 × 1028 m−3 s−1. These improvements in the BTTBo-4FN-based device may originate from the stronger and broader absorption of sunlight. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) were calculated according to the equations ηdiss = Jph/Jsat and ηcoll = Jmax power/Jsat, respectively, where Jph is the current density under short-circuit conditions, and Jmax power is the current density under the maximum power output conditions. The ηdiss and ηcoll for the BTTBo-4FN-based device were separately 96.4% and 85.8%, both of which were higher than those for the BTTBo-4F-based device (91.5% and 76.0%), verifying the better exciton dissociation and charge collection of the BTTBo-4FN-based device.

To further investigate the electron and hole transfer efficiency between donors and acceptors, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of neat and blend films were recorded. The electron transfer efficiency from PBDB-T to NFEAs was firstly measured by exciting PBDB-T, PBDB-T:BTTBo–4F, and PBDB-T:BTTBo–4FN films using a 500 nm laser. As shown in Fig. 3b, a distinct PL emission peak was observed at 675 nm in the neat PBDB-T film. In both blend films, the PL-quenching efficiencies were up to 90.6% for the PBDB-T:BTTBo–4F blend film and 94.1% for the PBDB-T:BTTBo–4FN blend film. In addition, new emission peaks at 830 nm were observed in two blend films, which may be due to Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between PBDB-T and NFEAs (BTTBo-4F or BTTBo-4FN). These results indicated efficient electron transfer and energy transfer from PBDB-T to NFEAs in OSCs. Furthermore, neat FREAs and blend films were excited using a 700 nm laser to explore the hole transfer efficiency from FREAs to PBDB-T (Fig. 3c). Despite the larger offset in HOMO energy levels between PBDB-T and BTTBo-4F, the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4FN blend film showed a slightly higher PL-quenching efficiency of 95.4% than the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4F blend film (95.1%), which may be ascribed to the larger dipole moment of BTTBo-4FN.
The charge recombination properties of the devices were explored by measuring the dependence of VOC and JSC on light intensity (P) under optimal conditions. As shown in Fig. 3d, the fitted slopes of S (JSC ∝ PSlight) for the BTTBo-4F-based and BTTBo-4FN-based devices were 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. Less bimolecular recombination normally could be achieved when S value is close to 1. Therefore, compared with the BTTBo-4F-based device, the BTTBo-4FN-based device had a more effectively suppressed bimolecular recombination. According to the formula VOC ∝ Plight, a slope value approximating kT/q indicates predominant biomolecular recombination in the recombination pathway while the slope value close to 2 kT/q demonstrates the dominant trap-assisted monomolecular recombination in the recombination pathway. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 3e, the smaller slope of the BTTBo-4FN-based device (1.30 kT/q) in comparison to that of the BTTBo-4F-based device (1.45 kT/q) demonstrated that a lower degree of trap-assisted recombination occurred in the former device under open-circuit conditions.
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blend films were measured by the space charge limited current method. An electron-only device with an ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag structure and a hole-only device with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag structure were fabricated and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. S9 (ESI). For the BTTBo-4F-based device, the μh was 7.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe was 3.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a resultant μh/μe ratio of 20. In contrast, the BTTBo-4FN-based device showed higher μh (1.07 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (8.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) with a μh/μe ratio of 13, which may contribute to a lower biomolecular recombination rate in the BTTBo-4FN-based device. Moreover, the charge extraction behavior of the devices was investigated by transient photocurrent measurement (TPC) under short-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 3f, the extraction time of the BTTBo-4F-based device was calculated to be 1.60 μs, whereas the BTTBo-4FN-based device showed a shorter charge extraction time of 0.89 μs, which may be caused by the higher electron mobility of the latter device. The more efficient the charge transfer, the lower the charge recombination, and the higher the charge mobility of the BTTBo-4FN-based device thus resulting in higher JSC and FF.

Molecular packing in the synthetic compounds was investigated by two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurements. The results of neat NFEA films are shown in Fig. 4a and b, where a (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a similar-intensity (010) diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction can be observed for the BTTBo-4F film, suggesting the coexistence of face-on and edge-on orientation in the BTTBo-4F film. In contrast, the BTTBo-4FN film had a distinct (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction, indicating the predominant face-on orientation relative to the substrate. Moreover, a shorter π–π stacking distance of 3.57 Å was achieved for BTTBo-4FN in comparison to that for BTTBo-4F (3.69 Å), which were obtained from their (010) diffraction peak (q) according to the equation d = 2π/q, where q was 1.76 Å−1 for BTTBo-4FN and 1.70 Å−1 for BTTBo-4F. In addition, the crystallite coherence length (CCLs) was calculated to be 8.4 Å for BTTBo-4F and 17.4 Å for BTTBo-4FN. These results indicate that π-extension terminal groups can induce face-on stacking in molecules, reduce the π–π stacking distances, and enlarge crystallite size, which could promote charge transport. Molecular packing in the blend films was also explored by 2D-GIWAXS. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the blend films of PBDB-T:BTTBo-4F and PBDB-T:BTTBo-4FN had strong (100) diffraction peaks at 0.31 Å−1 in the OOP direction, which was consistent with the diffraction patterns of the neat PBDB-T film. Similarly, the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4F blend film had a weak (010) diffraction peak at 1.70 Å−1 in the OOP direction, whereas PBDB-T:BTTBo-4FN had a strong (010) diffraction peak at 1.76 Å−1, which was also similar to that of the neat BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN films. These results confirm the retention of original molecular packing for the donor and acceptor moieties in the blend films. Furthermore, the CCL for the (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction was 13.02 Å in the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4F blend film and 16.10 Å in the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4FN blend film, indicating a larger crystal size in the latter film, which is beneficial to the higher charge mobility and FF of the BTTBo-4FN-based device.

The aggregation behaviors of the donor and acceptor in blend films are crucial factors for effective photovoltaic performance. When the phase separation is very large, the donor/acceptor interface decreases and the efficiency of exciton dissociation reduces, leading to small JSC and FF values. Conversely, when the phase separation is very small, excessive bimolecular recombination occurs in the charge transport process, which also causes a negative effect on JSC and FF. Consequently, appropriate phase separation size is important to maintain a trade-off between exciton dissociation and bimolecular recombination. To this end, we explored the surface morphology of the blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and characterized the phase separation pattern by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI), the root-mean-square surface roughness (RMS) of the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4F blend film (1.71 nm) was smaller than that recorded for the PBDB-T:BTTBo-4FN blend film (2.54 nm), which was agreement with the 2D-GIWAXS analysis, verifying the larger size of crystallite existing in the latter blend film. TEM images of PBDB-T:BTTBo-4FN blend film exhibited more distinct fibril network structures, which may account for the higher JSC and FF values in the BTTBo-4FN-based device from the other hand.

In this work, two NFEAs, named BTTBo-4F and BTTBo-4FN with the same central core but different terminal groups, were designed and synthesized. Compared with BTTBo-4F, BTTBo-4FN, which had π-extension terminal groups, exhibited stronger absorption, a narrower optical bandgap, larger dipole moment, and more ordered face-to-face π-stacking. As a consequence, OSCs based on BTTBo-4FN achieved a higher PCE of 11.60% than that of the BTTBo-4F-based devices (8.27%). Further investigation found that the BTTBo-4FN-based device presented a more efficient charge transfer, lower charge recombination, higher charge mobility, and better phase morphology. These results indicate that BTT is a promising unit to construct high-performance NFEAs.
