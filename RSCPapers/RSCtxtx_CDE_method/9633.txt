In recent years, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have been widely used in optoelectronic devices due to their advantages including low cost, solution processability, substrate compatibility, and easily tuned photoelectric characteristics via the quantum size effect. However, there are several factors still limiting the further improvement of performances for CQD optoelectronic devices: (1) the incomplete surface passivation of CQDs; (2) a trade-off between absorption and photogenerated carrier collection; and (3) the poor air stability. This review focuses on the methods for performance improvement of CQD-based photoelectric conversion devices including photovoltaic solar cells and photodetectors. Taking CQD solar cells as an example, different surface passivation methods are summarized. To increase the separation and collection of photogenerated carriers, the device architecture is optimized by aligning the energy band and broadening the depletion width. Additionally, device performance can be further enhanced through interface modification which could decrease recombination. In the next section, recent progress in the development of CQD near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) photodetectors is reviewed. To overcome the traditional photodetection limitations posed by the dark current/sensitivity/bandwidth trade-off, innovative device architectures are developed. Finally, this review discusses the application of CQD photodetectors in infrared imaging.

Yongzhe Zhang is currently a full professor at the Beijing University of Technology. He obtained the “National Excellent Young Scientists Fund” in 2019, the “Program for Overseas Talents Aggregation” in 2014, and is also a “specially-invited expert” of Beijing. He obtained his PhD degree in 2009 from Lanzhou University majoring in Condensed Matter Physics. From 2010 to 2013, he was research scientist at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. His present research interests are optoelectronic materials and devices such as photodetectors and solar cells. Until now, he has published more than 80 research papers.

Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with typical diameters of 2 to 20 nm are zero-dimensional nano-quantum structures and a subset of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). These CQDs show the quantum-confinement effect and each CQD includes hundreds and thousands of atoms. In the last twenty years, CQDs have exhibited a huge potential in optoelectronic devices due to their particular characteristics such as a size-tunable bandgap, solution processability, high absorption coefficient, and multiple exciton generation (MEG). In particular, the photovoltaic (PV) solar cells that convert solar irradiation into electrical energy and photodetectors that convert incident photons into an electrical signal are drawing more attention. With the continuous optimization of the CQD synthesis technologies, surface ligand engineering, device architectures, and charge transport, the CQD-based solar cells have become one of the most promising candidates for the third-generation PV technologies. Meanwhile, the CQD-based photodetectors also fill the gaps in the area of infrared (IR) detection.

As one of the extensively studied solution-processed materials, CQDs can easily realize the broadband spectrum absorption from ultraviolet to infrared by tuning their sizes compared with perovskite and organic materials that mainly absorb visible photons. Also, CQD solids are particularly suitable for harvesting and detecting infrared photons in NIR (0.7–1.4 μm), SWIR (1.4–3 μm), and MWIR (3–8 μm). Compared with other kinds of CQDs, sulfide CQDs are easier to synthesize, have better defined excitonic features, brighter photoluminescence (PL), and a wider size tuning range. They are most widely utilized in optoelectronic devices. The infrared sulfide CQDs are composites with the chemical formula AxBy, with A = Pb, Ag, Hg, Cd, etc., and B = S, Se, Te. IR CQDs further extend the response range of PV technology into the wavelengths larger than 1100 nm. They serve as the back cell in the tandem structures, such as perovskite (Eg = 1.58–1.68 eV)/CQD or Si (Eg = 1.1 eV)/CQD. Additionally, CQDs are semiconductor NCs that are solution synthesized and solution processed, in which the synthesis and film deposition are separately carried out. This differs from perovskites that need to be operated in a strictly inert environment. Benefiting from the above advantages, Bawendi's group, Konstantatos's group, and Sargent's group successively developed air-processed and ambient-stable CQD solar cells. Moreover, the doping types and densities of CQD films can be tuned by CQD surface ligand engineering, with the energy levels modified. As a result, devices based on the all-quantum dot homojunction structure and the energy level cascade structure with gradient doping are developed. With the rapid development of CQD PV technologies, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the PbS CQD based solar cells exceeded 13.8% in 2020. The huge development of PbS CQD based PV enables the potential commercialization of third-generation PV technologies.
Photodetection is the underlying principle of many optoelectronic systems, most of which need photodetectors to realize light detection. Photodetectors are assembled using a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) to achieve various applications. SWIR detection is of great importance in fields such as security monitoring, assisted driving, remote sensing, spectroscopy, and night vision imaging. Thermal infrared technology can be used to detect photons with longer wavelengths without illumination sources for passive imaging. Additionally, it can also be used to see through airborne obscurants such as smoke, mist, and fog. These make thermal infrared detectors highly suited for first-responder and search-and-rescue, night driving, machine vision, and poor weather surveillance applications that require capabilities that visible, NIR, or SWIR detectors do not possess. In the past decades, PbS and HgTe CQDs have become the most promising materials to fabricate this kind of photodetector among all the candidates. The figures of merit for CQD-based photodetectors have outperformed that of their traditional counterparts. Furthermore, they show several advantages in many aspects. Firstly, CQD-based photodetectors can be facilely fabricated in a low-temperature solution process technology such as spin-, dip-, and spray-coating, and doctor-blade coating. Secondly, they can be easily fabricated into any type of photodetector architecture such as photoconductors, phototransistors, and photodiodes without involving complicated processes including chemical vapor deposition, mechanical exploitation, and stacking compared with 2D materials. In addition, flexible substrate compatibility and high broadband sensitivity promote the development of CQD-based photodetectors. The IR photodetectors based on CQDs for light absorption and light-induced charge generation entered the mobile camera market in 2016. The up-conversion device combines a PbS CQD photodetector and visible LED enabling the observation of “infrared light” by the linear conversion process of “photon–electron–photon”. Recently, Guyot-Sionnest's group successfully achieved the dual-band IR imaging photodiode by the stacking of HgTe CQDs.
Currently, the widely used infrared CQDs with high monodispersity and uniform size distribution, such as PbS and HgTe CQDs, are being synthesized mostly using the hot injection method with slight modifications. The various physical, optical and electrical characteristics of semiconducting materials are mainly determined by their intrinsic carrier mobility (μ) and exciton binding energy (Eb). The values of μ and Eb of CQDs are between those of organics and perovskites, which are 10−3–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.1–0.3 eV, respectively. It is known that the quantum size effect occurs when the their size is smaller than the exciton Bohr radius (PbS: 18 nm, PbSe: 47 nm). As a result, the size-dependent tunable bandgap is generated, exhibiting the broad absorption range of CQDs (Fig. 1a). Additionally, the absorption coefficient of lead chalcogenide is about 104 cm−1 at the excitonic peak in the IR range. In practical applications for CQD-based optoelectronic devices, the main challenge is still air stability. For instance, poor air stability of PbS CQDs is attributed to their shallow work functions, incomplete coverage of surface ligands, and the trap energy levels originated from oxidation products. For small dots with a diameter smaller than 4 nm, the oxidation product in the air is mainly lead sulfite (PbSO3), which introduces shallow trap states lying 0.1 eV below the conduction band and prolongs the effective carrier lifetime. However, large-size dots (diameter >4 nm) primarily form lead sulfate (PbSO4) under air exposure. This oxidized product introduces deep trap states with a depth of 0.3 eV, which act mainly as catastrophic recombination centers, resulting in worse stability. Commonly, CQD-based optoelectronic devices under continuous external photostress in air exhibit a quick performance degradation. This is due to CQD film oxidation, leading to the degradation of the junction's quality and the increase of the device's resistance. For example, Schottky-junction CQD solar cells tend to exhibit linear current–voltage characteristics after several minutes of air-exposure. Therefore, to obtain air-stable CQD devices under operation, we will introduce some effective solutions involving surface ligand engineering, device architecture, and interface engineering in the following sections.
In this review, the sulfide CQD-based infrared photoelectric conversion devices and their recent developments will be discussed. Firstly, the role of CQD surface ligands and the origin of defect states, and their effects on different devices are analyzed. Secondly, IR CQD PV solar cells are used as an example to summarize the methods for improving device efficiency, including ligand exchange to conduct complete passivation, device structure optimization to enhance charge collection, and interface engineering to reduce recombination and leakage current. Finally, the different architectures of IR CQD photodetectors and their applications in imaging are reviewed, from the points of view of improving detection sensitivity including dark current reduction, improvement of air-stability, gain, and response speed.

The long alkyl chains such as oleic acid (OA) or oleylamine are often used as a surfactant during the CQD synthesis while using the method of hot injection and also to avoid the CQD aggregation. The carrier transport is often dependent on the CQD-to-CQD tunneling (hopping) assisted by ligands, as shown in Fig. 1b. Therefore, the distance between CQDs will have a significant influence on charge transport, in which the distance is determined by the length of the capping ligands. These insulated and long ligands (carbon chain length of oleic acid: ∼2.5 nm, oleylamine: ∼2.1 nm) used in the synthesis will impede the carrier transport. Thus, it's necessary to replace them with short ligands, such as 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) of ∼0.5 nm, and halide atomic ligands of ∼0.1 nm. Excitons can also be transferred between neighboring CQDs (Fig. 1c). When the inter-CQD spacing is between 0.5 and 10 nm, the non-radiative transfer of excitons via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) would occur for the electromagnetic field coupling formed by the transition dipoles of excited donor CQDs and ground-state acceptor CQDs.

Due to the colloidal stability provided by the lead oleate shell, all colloidal lead chalcogenide samples exhibit a typical off-stoichiometry characteristic. This leads to an imperfectly coordinated surface and finally undesirable dangling bonds caused by unpaired electrons on the surface (under-coordinated surface atoms cause dangling bonds). In the traditional view, the dangling bond is responsible for trap states. A large number of in-gap states would be caused by the un-passivated surface sites and off-stoichiometries of CQDs. Therefore, the surface containing under-coordinated atoms needs to be completely passivated (under-coordinated surface atoms are included in un-passivated surface sites). Under-coordinated surface atoms often lead to electronic states with energies lying within the bandgap of the CQD core (Fig. 1d). These surface states will change the electronic and optical properties of CQDs. It is because the low-energy states may act as dopants, whereas deeper band-tail and mid-gap states may capture charge carriers and provide a path for rapid electron–hole recombination. To eliminate dangling bonds, surface atoms should be engaged in strong chemical bonding with ligands. This pushes the energy of the unoccupied surface states above and the occupied surface states below that of the corresponding states of the CQD core (Fig. 1e). It's well known that the common features of solution-processed materials include the high possibility of defect formation. The disordered materials with high surface area and porosity are prone to be infiltrated by environmental oxidizing molecules (such as oxygen and water). This creates additional electron traps and often changes the doping levels of the material. Therefore, the shallow traps are generated due to surface disorder and reconstructions. For the mid-gap states, their formation was ascribed to off-stoichiometry (rich Pb(111) facet) or the imbalance between the excess Pb atoms and ligands. If these moderately delocalized trap states are partially filled, they may form a weakly conductive mid-gap band (MGB) (Fig. 1f). The existence of a high density of trap states in PbS CQDs must cause an obvious overlap of trap wavefunctions, which leads to the formation of a hopping pathway for charge carriers. For deep trap states, they are formed due to significantly under-coordinated atoms on the surface.
A deepened understanding of CQD surface composition and its significance makes it possible to control the physical properties of the films. A rectifying p–n junction plays a crucial role in high-performance optoelectronic devices due to its photovoltaic effect arising from the built-in electric field. Thus, the realization of controllable doping types and doping densities in CQD films is urgently needed. Luckily, the required progress was achieved in 2012 in the doping level control of CQD solids. Considering the contributions of inorganic and organic ligands, a CQD doping model called the charge-orbit balance model is used to predict the doping type and level based on the overall stoichiometry of CQD solids. The number of valence electrons available in the CQD thin film is firstly determined, which is then compared with the number of orbitals filled with valence electrons in the valence shell. Complete filling of the valence orbitals leads to a closed electronic shell configuration and intrinsic materials. If electrons residing in the conduction band are in excess, n-type doping is achieved. Otherwise, the incomplete filling of the valence band will cause p-type doping. Additionally, the doping types and doping densities of the films are related to the surface composition according to computational studies: for example, it has been observed that ligands with a negative-one charge would produce n-type films, while ligands with negative-two charges (such as oxygen) would lead to p-type films. It's well known that the bulk metal–chalcogen binary compound semiconductor exhibited n-type characteristics when it was off-stoichiometric due to excessive metal cations. For instance, excessive Pb and Se in PbSe CQDs showed n-type and p-type transport, respectively. It has been observed that the extensively studied PbS CQDs showed excessive amounts of lead due to the results of the synthesis scheme. In this scheme, the coordination ligands bound only cations, not anions. This fact prompted researchers to find better ways to passivate the surface of CQDs, thereby maintaining their inherent n-type behaviour. As shown in Fig. 1g, n-type PbS CQD films can be achieved using halide passivation in inert conditions, where inorganic halide anions (such as Cl−, Br−, I−) increased the overall passivation of dangling bonds on the surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that a large number of halides were incorporated in the form of a Pb–halide bond, indicating the presence of substitutional doping. As a result, n-type doping was generated according to the charge-orbit balance model. The reduction of halide ligands could cause CQD oxidation and reduce the n-type doping density (Fig. 1g). Furthermore, the doping density of the CQD film can be tuned by exposing them to a suitably designed redox couple. Recently, using ground-state electron transfer from the reducing agent cobaltocene obtained heavily doped and persistent n-type PbS and PbSe CQDs.
As a CQD PV solar cell, it needs to increase surface passivation and to reduce trap states as much as possible. Meanwhile, to enhance light absorption, the density of the CQD film should be increased. Similarly, CQD photodiode detectors also need a clean bandgap (fewer trap states), thereby guaranteeing a low dark current and high bandwidth. However, intentionally introducing mid-gap trap states that act as sensitizing centers into photoconductor and phototransistor detectors will prolong the carrier lifetime, which can increase photoconductive gain (G). Interestingly, using heavy electron doping in PbS, HgSe, Ag2Se CQDs can realize intraband transition, which largely broadens the absorption range in MWIR or even long-wave infrared (LWIR). Hence, aiming at optoelectronic devices with different structures and various application requirements, the CQD surface should be treated differently. Anyway, the CQD surface passivation can decrease the spacing between CQDs, reduce trap density, and increase charge carrier mobility. Generally, passivation methods can be divided according to the treatment process: solid-state ligand exchange (SSE), solution-phase ligand exchange (SPLE), and hybrid ligand exchange, shown in Fig. 2. In the next section, we will introduce these three methods, respectively.

The solar cells are an energy device made based on the PV effect. In recent years, the efficiencies of PbX (X = S, Se) based PV devices have rapidly increased, benefiting from surface ligand engineering, optimized device architectures, and modified charge transport. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is an index to compare the efficiencies of different PV cells. It is the characterization of the capability of a solar cell to convert incident solar radiation to electrical power and be defined relative to a given standard incident spectrum, in which AM (air mass coefficient) 1.5 standard solar spectrum is often used. In this part, we discuss successively from three perspectives of CQD surface ligand engineering, device architecture, and interface engineering to summarize the progress of CQD PV solar cells in recent years.


CQD solar cells have undergone rapid development since the report about prospective quantum size effect-tunable devices in 2005, which is largely attributed to the improvement of the electronic properties of CQD solids. The interaction between CQDs and organic, inorganic, or hybrid ligands plays a key role in enhancing device performances. Meanwhile, it's clear now to recognize the limiting effects of any states lying within the bandgap of the CQDs on the device performances. CQD solar cells require a clean bandgap, sufficient film density, and good air stability, which motivate the development of new strategies to improve surface passivation.



Fig. 2a displays the procedure of solid-state ligand exchange (SSE). The long-chain ligand capped CQD solution is firstly spin-coated over the substrate. Then the CQD film is treated (spin-coating or dip-coating) with a short-chain ligand solution (such as mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or EDT) for a few seconds, followed by drying. To wash off the exchanged ligands and extra short-chain ligands, the as-deposited film subsequently undergoes rinse–spin steps using a protic solvent. The desired film thickness is finally obtained by repeating the above steps several times, called the layer-by-layer (LBL) method. During the short-ligand solution exchange step, the removal of the bulky long-chain oleic ligands will induce considerable volume contraction, which results in the small cracks existing between all sub-layers that compose the total multilayer film. Luckily, these small cracks can be filled by the top layers during the LBL coating process, and thereby the necessary pinhole-free and compact films for PV devices are achieved.

The most effective and widely used ligands included pure atomic, halide salts, organic short carbon chain until now. In terms of the function of the capped ligands, the iodides and EDT were investigated most deeply and successfully. In 2014, Bawendi's group pointed out that TBAI treated PbS CQD film (TBAI–PbS) had a deeper work function of 4.77 eV compared with EDT–PbS (Fig. 3a). The difference between the Pb–thiol–carbon and the Pb–halide anion interactions caused the different surface dipole moments, thereby leading to the variation of their work functions. A p–n junction could be obtained by using different ligand treated CQD layers. The solar cell with TBAI–PbS as the main absorbing layer and EDT–PbS as an electron blocking/hole extraction layer had a certified efficiency of 8.55%. The improved efficiency was attributed to the band offset between the TBAI–PbS layer and the EDT–PbS layer, in which the insertion of the EDT–PbS layer could not only prevent the electron flow to the anode electrode but also promote the hole extraction and decrease the surface recombination (Fig. 3b). The band bending at the TBAI–PbS/EDT–PbS interface implied the formation of a depletion region near this junction, which effectively broadened the total depletion region width within the TBAI–PbS absorbing layer. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained its performance unchanged for air storage over 150 days because of the insensitive to oxygen and moisture for the TBAI–PbS layer. In 2016, Konstantatos's group found that 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide can be (EMII, inset of Fig. 3c) an alternative salt for SSE based on halides. Compared with TBAI, the EMII salt exhibited a less steric planar structure. Additionally, it also had a cation with a delocalized positive charge. These features may be beneficial for better halide binding and worse hydroxide binding on the CQD surface, in which the hydroxides would prevent complete passivation and thereby limit the performance improvement. The CQD solar cells treated with EMII followed by 80 °C annealing that desorbed hydroxyl ions, and could reduce mid-gap trap states and charge recombination, which improved the device PV performance and photostability (Fig. 3d and e). The resulting devices exhibited a certified PCE of 8.7% and the efficiency still maintained its initial value of 80% after 1000 h of continuous AM1.5G illumination.
Although the improvements given above were made, the PCE values of PbS CQD based solar cells were still lower than the expected value. One of the major limiting factors was the large deficit in the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Even state-of-art PbS CQD-PVs exhibited Voc deficits in the range of 400–550 mV. Although the values are slightly smaller than that (>600 mV) of organic PV cells, they are still much larger than that (100–200 mV) of high-efficiency PV cells based on c-Si, GaAs, and hybrid perovskites. The main reason for the Voc deficit was the abundance of in-gap states. The simultaneous use of organic and inorganic hybrid ligands may reduce the number of in-gap traps and thereby improve charge collection. In 2017, Konstantatos's group proposed a synergistic hybrid ligand treatment: mixing inorganic halide (zinc iodide, ZnI2) with MPA followed by applying them for LBL ligand exchange. The PCE value of ZnI2_MPA treated PbS CQD solar cells was increased from 6.62% to 9.92% compared with the cells treated with ZnI2. Additionally, the Voc was also increased from 0.58 V to 0.66 V apparently. The reason for selecting MPA was that it could protect the CQD surface from oxidation and facilitate the reduction of the mid-gap states. On the other hand, ZnI2 as the metal halide can realize better charge transport. Meanwhile, the solid complexes would not be formed when the two were mixed in solution. Further, this SSE method can be applied to the surface treatment for CQDs with a large size. In the following year, a SWIR solar cell with a short-circuit current of 34 mA cm−2 and a PCE of up to 7.9% was obtained. The cross-section image of the device structure is shown in Fig. 3f. It exhibited an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 80% at the wavelength of 1.35 μm (the first exciton absorption peak). These PbS CQD cells could harness photons larger than 750 nm and thereby offer an additional PCE of 3.3% when it was placed at the back of a MAPbI3 perovskite film (Fig. 3g). Moreover, the performances of the PbS CQD cells treated with ZnI2_MPA remained unchanged after 90 days inspite of being stored without encapsulation in an ambient environment. Meanwhile they maintained 5 hours of stable performance under continuous AM 1.5 solar illumination.

In most reports about CQD cells with high efficiency, the deposition of CQD films was achieved by the combination of SSE and LBL. Although this combined method enhanced electronic coupling among CQDs within sufficient layer thicknesses and achieved good performance, there still were some limitations. Firstly, during the process of SSE, the CQD films were re-exposed to the exchanging ligand solution, which may cause significant surface defects that can subsequently act as charge traps. Secondly, ligand loss may occur during this stage, especially when a protic solvent has been used. Thirdly, the exchanging ligand solution in the SSE process had finite penetration depth. Therefore, the film thickness made by one-step deposition would be limited to a few tens of nanometers. Additionally, the complicated iteration of SSE steps (>10 times) and multiple LBL deposition for obtaining CQD layers exhibited a big obstacle in commercial high-throughput deposition processes. In order to separate ligand exchange and film deposition, preparing high performance pre-exchanged CQD inks via solution-phase ligand exchange (SPLE) was a more intuitive strategy (Fig. 2b). This procedure starts from mixing the CQDs capped with long alkyl chains dispersed in a nonpolar solvent (such as octane) with halide ligands or short hydrophilic organic ligands dissolved in a polar solvent (such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylformamide (DMF)), followed by thoroughly stirring. Then, the CQDs are capped with the short ligands and transferred into the polar solvent. The resulting exchanged CQDs in the solution can act as inks, which facilitate one-step film deposition via a spin- or spray-coating procedure for achieving a CQD layer of sufficient thickness, and omit further exchange steps. Table 1 summarizes the recent progress of CQD ink-based solar cells.

In 2014, Ning et al. reported the first CQD ink solar cells based on solution exchanged halide ligands with a PCE of 6%. In the following year, Sargent's group utilized a two-phase exchange, in which long and bulky ligand (OA)-capped CQDs in a non-polar solvent were replaced by a short linker-capped system (MPA) in a polar solvent, to achieve efficient solar cells. Finally the complete transfer of CQDs from the non-polar (octane) to the polar solvent (DMSO) is observed (Fig. 4a). They successfully demonstrated the single-step fabrication for the CQD films using stable CQD inks again (Fig. 4b). In the same year, perovskite-passivated CQD solids were prepared by mixing CQD octane and DMF solution containing MAPbI3 perovskite precursors (MAI and PbI2), shown in Fig. 4c. When the colloids formed a solid film, annealing was carried out to promote the crystallization of the matrix, causing the formation of a thin perovskite shell on the surface of the CQDs. The addition of a perovskite matrix with a larger bandgap produced a more intrinsic CQD film, which showed a deeper depletion region of 120 nm under operating conditions. This value was much thicker than those found in the previous SSE reports. Thanks to the improved collection efficiency of charge carriers via drift motion, the PCE was increased up to 8.95%. However, the counter-ions necessary for colloidal stabilization in polar solvents cannot be completely removed from the films, which suppressed carrier transport. Therefore, it's necessary to remove counter-ions by post-annealing. However, the surface-bound halides were inevitably removed to maintain charge balance, which caused the degeneration of surface passivation and a non-uniform aggregation of CQDs. Thus, it's urgently demanded to remove the unnecessary cations before the deposition of CQD films.
In 2017, Jang's group developed iodide-capped n-type CQD inks via phase-transfer exchange (PTE) using PbI2 as an exchanging ligand. The trap densities of n-CQD inks were largely decreased due to the high surface passivation. Furthermore, the desired thickness (a few hundreds of nanometers) of the n-type CQD layer can be directly fabricated via a single-step spin-coating. A large number of hydroxyl groups (OH−) were introduced onto their surfaces during the PbS CQD synthesis. The related research studies proved that the groups could introduce trap levels into the bandgap of PbS CQDs and form carrier recombination centers, which limited the device performances. Therefore, removing or suppressing the intrinsic defect groups in PbS CQDs was of great importance. Recently, the chemical process of introducing hydroiodic acid as an additive into the PbS CQD ink fabrication method showed that the hydrogen ion (H+) in hydroiodic acid can neutralize the hydroxyl group (OH−) on its surface. Meanwhile, iodine ions (I−) in iodic acid combined with unbonded lead atoms on the surface of CQDs to form coordination bonds. This passivation strategy achieved the dual effects of inhibiting hydroxyl groups on the surface of CQDs and enhancing the passivation of iodine ligands. The PbSe CQD inks can also be fabricated in the solution-phase ligand exchange method. By constructing a solar cell with ITO/electron transport layer/light absorption layer/hole collection layer/gold electrode, a PCE of 10.68% was successfully obtained, which was a relative increase of 16% compared with the previous highest efficiency (9.2%).
In 2017, Sargent's group developed another method to fabricate CQD inks. They used the triple ligands of PbI2, PbBr2, and ammonium acetate (for colloid stabilization) to prepare organic–inorganic n-type PbS-CQD mixed inks (n-CQD inks) (Fig. 4d). The mixed CQD inks enabled the maximum number of halides bound on the CQD surface. Additionally, this method removed organic residues by nanocrystal precipitation, which can deposit clean CQD films without any post-treatment. Therefore, it allowed the deposition of active layers without disrupting the surface. As a result, the decreased CQD aggregation and bandtail states reduced the energy funneling, improved carrier transport, and assisted carriers to inject into the electrodes. Benefiting from these, the resulting solar cells achieved a thicker active layer (350 nm), which could absorb much more incident solar irradiation, and obtained a certified PCE of 11.28%. Furthermore, they showed good stability after being stored in unsealed air for more than 1000 hours. However, the above-mentioned passivation strategy had not been successfully applied to solution-phase ligand exchange for larger diameter CQDs (i.e. diameter >3.5 nm). It's because as the size of the CQDs increased, the portion of non-polar (100) facets with low surface energy increased, but at the cost of a decrease in the cation-rich polar (111) facets. Additionally, the oleic acid ligands on the (100) facets were easily removed in polar solvents such as DMF. Such CQDs were not colloidally stabilized, and thus aggregated, or even fused during ligand exchange. In 2019, Sargent's group exploited a strategy based on narrow bandgap CQDs to maintain colloidal stability and quantum confinement in solution-phase ligand exchange. They sought the non-polar (100) facet passivation in large-diameter CQDs by replacing the NH4+ cations used in conventional ligand exchange with alkali metal cations (Na+). This strategy made the narrow bandgap CQDs more soluble in polar solvents during ligand exchange. The presence of lead halide ligands on the (111) facets increased due to the significant decrease in the degree of aggregation during colloid processing (Fig. 4e). The solar cells made from the CQDs passivated by the lead halide in the polar (111) facets and Na+ in the non-polar (100) facets exhibited improved performances compared with NH4+Ac− passivated CQD solar cells. The PCE increases were 33% and 48% under the illumination of complete AM1.5 solar spectrum and wavelength larger than 1100 nm, respectively. Additionally, the EQE values were also improved up to ≈70% at the excitonic peak (Fig. 4f). Further, they discovered that short-chain carboxylates (such as formate, acetate, and propionate) used as steric hindrance controllers can facilitate the ligand exchange process on narrow bandgap CQDs. It's because when short-chain carboxylates were used, the net energy barrier of replacing the original capping ligands with lead halide anions was reduced. The method produced a more complete ligand exchange, thereby increasing packing density and monodispersity. Moreover, the smallest Stokes shift (9 nm) was observed in formate exchanged samples, which indicated that the effects of aggregation and energy transfer were minimized due to more ligand coverage on the CQD surface (Fig. 4g). Recently, Sargent's group realized more complete surface passivation without affecting carrier transport by mixed lead halides (MPbX, PbI2, PbBr2, and PbCl2) ligand exchange. As a result, the performances of MPbX-capped PbS CQDs surpassed the single lead halide capped CQDs: they exhibited higher passivation degree (Stokes shift: 43 ± 5 meV vs. 44 ± 4 meV) and better charge transport (mobility: 4 × 10−2 ± 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3 × 10−2 ± 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).
In these reported high-efficiency p–n quantum junction cells, the n-type layer was prepared by directly coating n-CQD inks, but the p-type CQD layer was still prepared through the SSE step using EDT as the exchange ligand. In 2018, Jang's group developed aqueous p-CQD inks (MPA-capped PbS CQDs) using the PTE method. The mixed aqueous solvents included a high dielectric constant solvent (water) and a high donor number chemical (butylamine, BA). The BA was used to disperse MPA-capped CQDs in the aqueous solvents. It can efficiently capture the carboxyl hydrogens in the MPA, leading to the formation of the electric double layers between the carboxylate anion and butyl ammonium cation at the CQD/solvent interface. The water stabilized the electrical double layers. The mixed solvents enabled the dispersion of the MPA-capped CQDs at relatively high concentrations. It's a prerequisite for the deposition of sufficiently thick films. Then they developed the high-efficiency n–p quantum junction solar cells using n-CQD and p-CQD inks simultaneously by single-step deposition without SSE for the first time. A PCE of 10.9% was reached, which is comparable with the highest performance in the same year. Besides, the CQD solar cells with relatively high PCE of up to 10.01% were successfully manufactured using the advanced technique of continuous and large-area thin-film deposition (doctor-blade coating). It's an unprecedented and significant result for processes other than spin-coating. More recently, Sargent's group developed another method to produce p-CQD inks based on cascade surface modification. It needed a second treatment of the n-type COD inks, in which lead halide anions were re-exchanged with the functional ligands (such as cysteamine) to obtain a p-type character. With the successful preparation of CQD inks, the scalable preparation of CQD cells became possible. In 2019, Sargent's group found that the redistribution kinetics of CQD droplets were highly dependent on the movement of the solid–liquid vapor contact line and the evaporation kinetics of the solvent. Therefore, they achieved uniform and large-area (100 cm2) deposition of CQD inks (Fig. 4h) by depositing MAI-capped CQD inks on a 50 °C hot plate via a single-step spraying method, which was due to the reduction of the contact line friction constant and the increase of droplet evaporation rate.
For practical applications, the main challenge was the device air-stability. The newly explored method by growing heteroepitaxial perovskite on CQDs has been evidenced as an effective way to passivate surface defects and improve device stability. The perovskite-CQD solids were grown in the ink-process by incorporating perovskite precursors into the CQD solution. In 2019, Sargent's group reported a “lattice anchored” hybrid material, which combined cesium lead halide perovskites with lead chalcogenide CQDs. The lattice matching between the two materials helped the stability exceed the stability of the components. However, the resultant thick perovskite matrix inhibited the interdot charge-carrier transport. Therefore, they further developed a self-programmed growth (SPG) strategy to nucleate monolayer perovskite bridges among the CQDs (Fig. 4i): the CQD film made from single-step spin-coating of inks was soaked in a solution of formamidinium (FA) halide (FAX, X = Br, I) in acetonitrile followed by annealing. This monolayer perovskite enhanced interdot coupling and reduced the distance over which carriers must tunnel. As a result, the diffusion length was increased by two times compared to reference CQD solids. The resulting solar cells achieved a stabilized PCE of 13.8% (Fig. 4j), which was a record among Pb chalcogenide CQD solar cells.
The previous efforts of improving CQD device stability mainly relied on the measurements under long-term air storage or light illumination without electric load. However, XPS measurements in ref. 30 showed that PbI2 surface passivation degraded to PbO, and PbS CQDs were oxidized to PbSO3 and PbSO4 under continuous illumination in air. Therefore, it has remained a challenge for the CQD solar cells to improve device stability under operation conditions (maximum power point, MPP). To overcome this challenge, both the CQDs and the surface passivation should be protected from oxidation. Potassium (K) is an element with low electron affinity, large size, and strong interaction with iodide. Also, it shows a more stable formation with iodide than oxygen, effectively making it protect the surface. In 2020, Sargent's group introduced additional potassium iodide (KI) on the CQD surface during the ink fabrication process, in which KI formed an additional buffer layer. The shielding layer KI protected the subsurface S sites from O2 physisorption, which prevented further O2 splitting and the formation of SOx. Meanwhile, the introduction of KI enabled denser iodide passivation, leading to decreased O2 molecules on the surface. The two factors together contributed to improved device performance and air-stability. As a result, the unencapsulated devices with KI retained >80% of their initial PCE under the conditions of 300 h continuous operation in air, which was much more stabilized than that of devices without KI (21 hours under the same amount of performance loss).

Considering that the diversity of atomic sites present on the CQD surface is a function of stoichiometry, faceting, and initial ligand coverage, a multiple-ligand strategy may be more effective than a single-ligand strategy. Hybrid ligands that combine organic crosslinkers and inorganic passivants have induced great focus in recent years. This method (Fig. 2c) includes two steps: firstly the solution-phase halide ligand exchange and then the solid-state ligand exchange. Note that halide anions are introduced in situ or at the end stages of the CQD synthesis process (cooling process after the injection of sulfur source), which can passivate some sites inaccessible to bulky organic ligands. After that, SSE is used to replace long organic ligands with short ligands (such as MPA or EDT).

Sargent's group successfully passivated surface defects in PbS CQD films and enhanced electron transport by using monovalent halide anions. The exposed S2− anions were firstly passivated by treating PbS CQDs with the mixtures of CdCl2, tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA), and oleylamine (OLA), followed by SSE using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) dissolved in anhydrous methanol. As a result, completely inorganic and halide anion passivated PbS CQD films were formed (Fig. 5a). Overall, this atom-ligand passivation strategy improved the size distribution and reduced surface defects in the air at room temperature without hydrazine and annealing. Additionally, the minority carrier electron mobility was 4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was the best among the previous reports. Solution-phase metal halide salt (CdCl2) treatment could enhance the control of the charge balance on the surface of CQDs, which was essential to eliminate the mid-gap trap states. Consequently, Sargent's group continued to develop a reliable hybrid passivation scheme aiming at significantly improving surface passivation and increasing film density. This scheme introduced halide anions at the end stage of the synthesis process (cooling process after sulfur source injection), which made it possible to passivate trap sites inaccessible to larger organic ligands (Fig. 5b). The organic cross-linking strategy (MPA for SSE) was then used. Finally, solar cells based on the hybrid passivation CQD solids achieved a certification efficiency of 7.0%, which was the highest record of CQD PV cells at that time. It's well accepted that n-type semiconductors made from soft matter were easily oxidized within minutes of air exposure. In order to synthesize air-stable n-type PbS CQD solids, Sargent's group designed a hybrid ligand exchange strategy. The oleic acid-capped CQDs were firstly treated with the halide solution (TBAI oleylamine precursor solution) under an inert atmosphere. Because halides have n-type doping characteristics in CQD solids, and small steric hindrance, they can completely cover the surface of nanoparticles (Fig. 5c) and thereby protect the CQD surface from oxygen. As a result, the efficiency of the solar cells prepared by the above CQDs was stable after four days of air storage because CQD films had benefited from the exchange of iodide ligands before washing with any protic solvent, their trap state density was reduced, and the stability was significantly improved.
As discussed above, improved light absorption and charge collection were the two main requirements for increasing the PCE of the solar cells. In order to produce high mobility-lifetime products and thereby increase carrier diffusion length, it should remove dangling bonds and chemical impurities on the surface, avoid the formation of deep electron trap states, minimize nanocrystal spacing, and enhance charge carrier mobility. The as-prepared thicker absorption layer in such a condition can not only enhance the light absorption but also effectively collect photogenerated carriers. Driven by such a goal, Sargent's group injected the mixtures of chlorothiol and cadmium precursors sequentially at different temperatures during the final cooling process of CQD synthesis. This hybrid passivation method (Fig. 5d) had tightly bound chlorothiol and allowed it to retain passivation from the solution to the thin film, thus avoiding transient unprotected CQD agglomeration. The prepared TiO2/PbS heterojunction solar cells achieved a PCE of 8.5%. The SSE method was unlikely to repair any trap states already present in the as-synthesized CQDs, whereas hybrid ligand passivation strategies of solution treatment applied before SSE could potentially further improve CQD performances. Sargent's group reported a solution-based passivation scheme, in which the post-synthesis cleaning of PbS CQDs occurred via oxidation–reduction reaction in the presence of iodine molecules (I2) dissolved in nonpolar solvents (PbS + I2 = PbI2 + S). After solution treatment, the control of halogen reactivity could be enhanced, which helped to avoid overtreatment and improved the overall passivation of CQDs in the solution. The CQDs with better passivation benefiting from the optimized reactivity showed longer film carrier diffusion length (Fig. 5e). Therefore, the photovoltaic devices with thicker active layers without affecting charge collection can be achieved. This optimization ultimately resulted in a certified PCE of 9.9%. Furthermore, Konstantatos's group proposed a non-invasive iodide substitutional doping passivation strategy, in which iodide precursors were introduced at the end of the CQD synthesis. It was found that when the optimal precursor I/Pb ratio was in the range of 1.5–3%, the substitution of iodide for S would not excessively change the surface chemical properties of the CQDs and reduce the density of the deep trap states of CQDs (Fig. 5f). This method can be used to construct a double-layer device structure of iodide passivated CQDs and EDT passivated CQDs, in which each layer had alternative iodide dopants. Meanwhile, it resisted the negative effects that environmental oxidation and hydroxylation of the dots on their ion balance and doping characteristics. When the I/Pb precursor ratio was optimized to be 1.5%, the highest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 10.5% could be achieved.

In order to develop efficient solution-processed photovoltaic devices, it is important to increase the carrier diffusion length, which is limited by high defect density or high radiation loss. In CQDs, excitons are easily dissociated into free carriers, and they will recombine when they meet at the defect sites. Therefore, one strategy to improve the PCE of solar cells is the surface ligand engineering discussed above. Another method is to separate electrons and holes into different carrier transport pathways employing heterostructures, that is, stacking two materials with staggered energy bands. To further improve exciton dissociation efficiency, a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure made by the one-step solution process of donor:acceptor blend is developed. The BHJ strategy has been extended to other systems with short diffusion lengths, including inorganic nanocrystals and hybrid polymer–nanocrystal devices. The quantum junction devices can not only adjust the absorption spectrum but also provide inherently matched energy bands at the interface between the p-type material and the n-type material. Additionally, this structure enables effective charge separation. Overall, the optimization of device structures is an important guarantee for further improving efficiency.


In the early research on CQD solar cells, a Schottky structure was used, in which a p-type CQD layer was sandwiched between a transparent conductive oxide (ITO) and a shallow work function metal (Al or Mg) (Fig. 6a). Due to the huge difference in the work function of the materials, a Schottky barrier was formed at the CQD/metal interface. The built-in electric field generated by the Schottky junction drove the separation of photogenerated carriers. Although Schottky devices with the advantages of easy fabrication and highly sensitive performances led to the early development of CQD PV technology, they still suffered from many limitations. For instance, charge separation was insufficient since high-density photogenerated carrier pairs were generated on the ohmic contact side away from the Schottky interface. In addition, the Fermi level pinning at the CQD/metal interface could reduce the open-circuit voltage Voc. Meanwhile, undesirable reverse recombination may occur due to the presence of a small hole injection barrier on the electron extraction electrode. These two problems limited the PCE of Schottky junction CQD solar cells to <5%.


To address these limitations, a depleted heterojunction architecture was developed in 2010. Generally, n-type wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO formed rectifying junctions with p-type CQD films (Fig. 6b). In addition, n-type inorganic Bi2S3 nanocrystals and organic materials PCBM can also be used as electron acceptors in planar heterojunctions. Due to the energy differences of the conduction band generated from the junction and type II heterointerface, the built-in electric field promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs. The depleted heterojunction CQD devices had many advantages over Schottky junction devices. Firstly, the separation of charges on the light-absorbing side of the device reduced the dependence on long-distance transport within the CQD films. Secondly, the n-type TiO2/p-type CQD heterojunction eliminated the open-circuit voltage limitation due to the Fermi level pinning in Schottky devices. Thirdly, the potential barrier for hole extraction caused by the deep valence band of TiO2 can prevent reverse recombination. Despite rapid progress in depleted heterojunction structures, the photovoltaic performances of CQD solar cells are still limited by the trade-off between light absorption and charge extraction. The absorption coefficient of lead chalcogenide semiconductor CQDs was approximately 104 cm−1 at the exciton peak in the IR range. Therefore, about 1 μm of an active layer film was needed to absorb IR photons from 1100 to 1800 nm in a conventional planar heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 6b, only photogenerated carriers produced within a diffusion length at the edge of the depletion region can be effectively collected. It has been reported that the diffusion length in CQD solids was 150–250 nm. To maintain effective charge extraction, the thickness of the active CQD film should not exceed the sum of minority carrier diffusion length and depletion region width. This limited the actual thickness of the CQD light-absorbing layer to ∼300 nm.


The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure successfully used in organic PVs provided a pathway to improve the performance of CQD solar cells. The BHJ structure can improve charge extraction in thick films (of over 1 μm) required for deep infrared or X-ray detection.Fig. 7a and b show the recently exploited device structures, in which ordered and random porous structured electrodes were permeated by CQDs. The interpenetrating donor–acceptor structure enabled effective charge separation even if in a thick CQD film. The depleted bulk heterojunction (DBH) devices with better performance used a porous TiO2 electrode, which consisted of a dense TiO2 layer (small nanocrystals) plus a paste of larger TiO2 particles. As shown in Fig. 7a, most of the PbS CQDs diffused into the TiO2 mesoporous film along the pore channels after annealing. The particle necking between the CQDs formed a bridge for hole transport. As a result, a large number of excitons were generated near the junction interface in the three-dimensional DBH with a highly folded structure. Besides, this device structure increased the contact area between TiO2 nanoparticles and PbS CQDs exponentially, thereby increasing the concentration of photogenerated carriers. The resulting devices exhibited improved light collection efficiency and charge injection efficiency compared with the traditional TiO2/PbS planar heterojunction devices (PCE increment: 39%).

The interface morphology of conventional CQD DBH solar cells prepared based on disordered ZnO nanowires (NWs) and the laboratory-scale spin-coating process was very poor, which severely inhibited the extraction of charge carriers and limited device performance. To improve the interface morphology, the vertically aligned ZnO NW arrays and convective assembly technology were introduced together in the manufacture of CQD DBH solar cells. During the assembly process, the capillary attractive interaction between the CQDs and the well-arranged ZnO NW substrate resulted in dense packing of the CQDs and more effective penetration (Fig. 7b). As a result, an efficient DBH solar cell with a PCE of 8.41% was obtained. These studies pointed out the importance of further minimization of recombination as the increased junction surface area.
Uniformly mixed CQDs of different sizes and compositions were also implemented in the BHJ architecture. The advantage of CQDs over the organic was that they did not require a continuous phase of the same material. Therefore, even if multiple types of CQDs were uniformly mixed, they could still maintain a sufficient concentration of nearest neighbors with the same characteristics, and retain high carrier mobility (Fig. 7c). In 2015, Sargent's group mixed MPA capped PbS CQDs with three different sizes (exciton peaks of 950, 1250, and 1520 nm, respectively) into a solution, which was then used to form films by centrifugal coating. Assembly of CQDs under an applied centrifugal force would stratify the films by nano-particle size. The resulting films caused the formation of an additional internal electric field induced by the graded topology, which was beneficial for carrier transport. The PCE of the resulting device was increased to 5.2% from 4.8% for the traditional planar structure. In 2017, Sargent's group conducted solution-phase ligand exchange for OA–PbS CQDs to obtain electron acceptor CQDs capped with MAPbI3 and electron donor CQDs capped with thioglycerol (TG), respectively. When these two types of CQDs were mixed in the solution phase and the final film was formed, each CQD maintained its unique chemical properties and produced distinguishable donor and acceptor domains for bulk heterojunctions (Fig. 7d). These ligands were tightly bound to the CQD surface. Therefore, the two types of CQDs could retain an intimate mixture even in the solid state, which resulted in the separation of electrons and holes into different regions and inhibited their subsequent recombination. When the D:A stoichiometry was suitably optimized, photogenerated carriers could efficiently migrate through their respective donor/acceptor transport media. This was the first demonstration of a hybrid CQD ink solar cell with a PCE of up to 10.4%, which was twice as high as that of the previously reported BHJ CQD devices. The charge mobility of PbS CQD solid films still limited their performance in many optoelectronic applications. In order to further improve device performance, a small volume of PbSe CQDs was introduced into PbS CQDs by doping to form a mixed CQD solution for manufacturing solar cells. Since the exciton radius of PbSe CQD was large and its mobility was higher than that of PbS CQD, the charge mobility of the mixed film was improved. The PCE of 5% PbSe:PbS hybrid CQD solar cells was increased to 9.4%, while the PCE of pure PbS CQD solar cells was 8.8%.
In a similar but different strategy, an inorganic bulk nano-heterojunction structure with full solution treatment was reported (Fig. 7e). Note that this strategy used a solution-phase mixture of Bi2S3 and PbS CQDs to form the mixed layer. Photogenerated holes were introduced into the PbS phase and photogenerated electrons were introduced into the Bi2S3 phase at the interface between Bi2S3 nanocrystals and PbS CQDs. Surprisingly, its performance was improved by more than three times compared with the planar heterojunction structure, which was due to the nano-scale phase separation prolonging the carrier lifetime. In this structure, both the donor and acceptor materials acted as active light-absorbing media. Hybrid PV technology that mixed semiconductor polymers with CQDs has also been receiving attention. In the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PCBM:PbS CQDs ternary BHJ solar cells, the photogenerated holes generated in the CQDs moved to P3HT, and the photogenerated electrons moved to the PCBM due to the energy level offset between the mixed materials. However, the devices fabricated based on this strategy exhibited limited efficiency, which was most likely the result of blocked carrier transport in mixed solids. Thus, it's urgently required to use a well-designed type II bulk heterojunction that is beneficial for charge separation combined with the excellent electron and hole transport capabilities required by each phase. Meanwhile, controlling the phase separation on the required length scale can further promote the performances of BHJ solar cells. By using the quantum size effect, the CQDs with a diameter of 3.4 nm and PSBTBT were mixed to form BHJ solar cells. Benefiting from the optimized type II heterojunction, effective chemical ligand exchange, and broad absorption to the solar spectrum, a PCE of 3.48% was achieved under AM 1.5G illumination.
Organic materials absorb visible light photons, which can form an effective spectral complement with PbX CQDs that absorbed NIR photons. This organic/inorganic hybrid structure has been extensively studied in the past years, which includes PbSxSe1−x:PDTPBT bulk heterojunctions, PbS/(PSBTBT:PCBM), and PbS/(PTB7:PCBM) hybrid stack solar cells. However, their PCEs were still lower than 9%. There were two main reasons leading to low efficiencies. On the one hand, the chemical mismatch between the organic materials and the inorganic materials (dielectric constant, organic: 3–4; PbS CQD: 15–20) resulted in insufficient exciton dissociation at the interface. On the other hand, poor CQD/polymer network interpenetration structures were formed due to the large surface energy difference between the two materials, and the serious CQD surface defect recombination as well as rapid geminate recombination. To overcome the above limitations, recently, Sargent's group introduced the non-fullerene acceptor small molecule IEICO into the CQD/organic stack structure (Fig. 7f). This small molecule not only supplemented CQD absorption in the visible region but also formed a cascade structure with the energy levels of the host polymer and CQD, thereby achieving effective energy transfer and promoting exciton dissociation at the organic/inorganic heterojunction interface (Fig. 7g). Benefiting from this carefully designed device structure, the PCE was exceeded 13.1%. Also, high-energy photons were absorbed by the CQD film before reaching the organic layer (to prevent photooxidation of organic materials), and the organic layer above the CQD layer could effectively resist the erosion of oxygen and water. As a result, the PCE retained more than 80% of its original value after 150 hours of continuous operation without sealing.

For bulk materials, there were great limitations in forming rectifying junctions with CQD solids. When the size of the CQDs was changed, the device structure must be re-optimized to meet the energy level match. Therefore, it was very necessary to use two inherent materials with energy band alignment to make the all-quantum-tuned junction structure for efficient charge separation.

It became possible to manufacture solar cells with absorption ranges that can be adjusted on each side of the rectifying junction using size effects with the assistance of the newly discovered advantages of doping control in CQD films. These quantum junction solar cells started with a p-type CQD layer on ITO glass, followed by a doped n layer to form a p–n junction and finally completed by an Al–Ag bilayer electrode (Fig. 8a). This structure allowed a built-in electric field to be formed at the p–n junction and enabled a significant extension of the depletion region to each side of the light-absorbing film. In such a structure, the inherent matching of the bandgaps can achieve wide tuning, while automatically retaining the optimal band alignment between the n- and the p-type layers. Early quantum junction solar cells quickly obtained a certified PCE of 5.4% under AM 1.5 solar illumination.
The quantum junction concept has undergone many improvements since these early studies. The first was the optimization of electrical contact with the n-type layer. The previously used Al formed an ohmic contact with the n-type CQD film whereas Al tended to react with the halides necessary for the passivation and doping of the CQD film. Replacement of Al with a metal oxide electrode doped with a shallow work function overcame these interface problems and provided a hole blocking layer at the cathode interface. The second optimization was to broaden the depletion region depth, which could then improve the efficiency of charge collection. Synthesis of heavily doped p-type CQDs by replacing Pb with Ag resulted in an increase in the doping density by several orders of magnitude compared to the previous levels (Fig. 8b), which improved charge collection in the visible region, especially in the IR region. Finally, the optimization of control over doping density has made it possible for the rational design of stacked device structures with cascaded energy band alignment. In 2013, Sargent's group designed a cascade-graded CQD structure, in which a heavily doped n+ layer was introduced on the back of the devices (Fig. 8c). They achieved control over the n-type doping level across the range 1016–1017 cm−3 by finely tuning the halide treatment. The thin and heavily doped n+ layer contributed to an increased electric field at the back of the device, which was beneficial for the extraction of photogenerated carriers in the most required position. Additionally, quasi-Fermi-level splitting at the MPP was also enhanced, increasing open-circuit voltage. In the following year, this group also successfully prepared an inverted quantum cascade structure solar cell: it began the deposition of air-stabilized n-CQDs atop TiO2 fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass followed by a lightly doped p-type film using bromide for SSE in the air; after that, MPA was used to obtain a more heavily doped p-type layer; finally, the counter electrode MoO3/Au/Ag was fabricated to complete the device (Fig. 8d). The transmission length was extended thanks to the broadening of the depletion region (330 nm), which enabled the increased thickness of the CQD light absorption layer (up to 450 nm). Therefore, the double-pass absorption and charge collection efficiency were both improved, leading to a high PCE of 8%.

Apart from improving passivation strategies to reduce trap density and increase CQD density within the film, and designing new structures to enhance carrier collection, there is another very promising method that can be used to improve device performance: interface engineering. The interface usually brings the bottleneck of charge transport, and may also act as a recombination center, thereby shortening the carrier lifetime and reducing the device performance. Enhancing carrier collection and minimization of carrier trapping at the interface between the photosensitive layer and the electrodes (top and bottom contacts) are critical to improving efficiency.


Transition metal oxides such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and EDT passivated CQDs (EDT–CQDs) were the most widely used hole transport layer (HTL) materials in the field of CQD solar cells. MoO3 and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) were used as ohmic contacts for hole extraction to CQD films. However, although these materials with deep work function were well suited for hole extraction, considering the work function alone was not sufficient to explain the significantly improved low resistance material interface produced using them. As observed in organic optoelectronics, the presence of interface dipoles can enhance the energy band bending at the MoO3/CQD interface and facilitate the hole extraction from the MoO3 side. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies implied that the gap states arose from oxygen vacancies that were present in the bandgap of MoO3. Moreover, these states may align well with the valence band of the CQD films, thereby providing an additional pathway for removing holes. Finally, the high work function MoO3 pinned the Fermi level of the top electrode and achieved the required ohmic contact (Fig. 9a).

Recently, a new kind of HTL based on EDT–PbS films was developed. It began with the solution-phase treatment for PbS CQDs (OA and O-((9H-fluoren-9-yl)methyl) S-(2-mercaptoethyl) carbonothioate (FMT) ligand exchange), followed by the removal of the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group of FMT ligands by mild alkaline treatment. The films produced by the FMT cleavage method exhibited denser CQD packing, fewer carboxylate-impurities, greater thiol ligand coverage, and shallower band position compared with that made from the traditional EDT ligand exchange method. Research studies have shown that the high reactivity of EDT can cause severe chemical corrosion of the active layer, resulting in the degradation of charge extraction ability. In 2020, Sargent's group developed a chemical orthogonal HTL consisting of malonate cross-linked CQDs. The new cross-linking strategy preserved the surface chemistry of the active layer while providing the required effective charge extraction. The resulting HTL can increase the charge carrier diffusion length in the active layer by 1.4 times.
Doping in HTL can also be an effective method to improve charge transport. By immersing EDT–PbS CQD HTL briefly in a solution of metal–organic p-type dopant (Mo(tfd-COCF3)3), it became heavily p-type doped, which effectively deepened its Fermi level and enhanced the energy band bending at the HTL:absorber interface (built-in electric field enhancement). As a result, charge separation and collection were effectively improved (Fig. 9b). Additionally, the reflow of photo-generated electrons was prevented, thereby improving the photocurrent and fill factor compared with those of the undoped devices, which ultimately led to a PCE of 9%.
However, these materials cannot provide a sufficiently large barrier (0.2–0.4 eV) for electrons (Fig. 3b) and cannot block electron leakage. Organics or conjugated polymer materials with large band gaps usually had shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Therefore, they were very suitable for HTLs to prevent electron leakage. Recently, a new type of organic HTL PBDTTT-ET has been successfully applied to PbS CQD solar cells (Fig. 9c). Its hole mobility was 6 × 10−4 V cm−1 s−1, which was twice as high as that of the traditional EDT–PbS HTL. Jeon's group developed a new HTL based on organic π-conjugated polymers (πCP), with its photoelectric properties changed via molecular engineering, which greatly improved the charge generation and collection in CQD solar cells. The resulting solar cells using PBTDTPD-HT achieved a PCE of 11.53% that was higher than the previous reports using the p-type CQD HTL. Moreover, these devices exhibited good stability under air storage.
Nonetheless, strong dipole moments were normally formed at the interfaces between these materials and the metal electrodes, which inhibited the control of optimal band alignments. To overcome this challenge, Sargent's group recently developed a new type of bilayer HTL. This bilayer HTL consisted of semiconductor alpha-sexithiophene (α-6T) and metallic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The introduction of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer between α-6T and Au electrode can suppress the formation of undesired interfacial dipoles and a Schottky barrier for holes. Meanwhile, the bilayer HTL provided a high electron barrier of 1.35 eV (Fig. 9d–f). The Voc of the devices using bilayer HTLs was enhanced by 74 mV while maintaining the Jsc compared to conventional MoO3 control devices. As a result, a high PCE of 9.2% was obtained. Besides, the bilayer HTL greatly improved the air stability of devices, with a lifetime exceeding 400 hours. The bilayer HTL strategy can also be extended to other combinations, such as P3HT/PEDOT:PSS, PCPDTBT/PEDOT:PSS.

From the discussion of the hole transport layer/electron blocking layer, we can know that the transport layers collecting electrons should have energy bands aligned with the CQD layers while having a deep valence band to prevent hole leakage. In order to produce more effective charge separation, controlling the band offsets at the heterointerface and the carrier density in the bulk electrode via doping provided a reliable pathway. The sol–gel material processing system has made the latest progress, in which various dopants were incorporated into the TiO2 matrix materials. Using Zr and Sb as dopants can control the conduction band edge to gradually move from −3.9 to −4.2 eV, compared with −3.8 eV for intrinsic TiO2. The conduction band of TiO2 should be deeper than that of CQDs, thereby contributing to electron injection from CQDs to the conduction band of TiO2. It was unfavorable for electron injection if the conduction level of TiO2 was shallower than that of CQDs (left of Fig. 9g). The Zr-doped TiO2 had a deep electron affinity, and the most optimal band alignment with PbS CQDs (middle of Fig. 9g), which improved charge injection and increased photocurrent. However, further deepening of the conduction band would provide no further benefit to carrier injection and damage the open voltage Voc.

The thickness of the depletion region was dominated by the density of free carriers in bulk electron acceptor materials. ZnO usually exhibited intrinsic characteristics since gas molecules trapped mobile electrons. But it can be changed to n-type by UV irradiation. Only when ZnO was photodoped into a free carrier density close to or larger than that of a PbS CQD film did a significant portion of the depletion region reside within the CQD layer. Although UV activation was not a problem in stand-alone CQD solar cells, it limited the application of IR CQDs in tandem solar cell structures. Another limitation of ZnO in IR CQD solar cell was its unfavorable energy band alignment with a narrow bandgap (large size) CQD layer, which led to poor electron collection. Photon absorption beyond 1100 nm required a larger CQD size, and the conduction band (CB) energy level of the iodide-passivated CQDs became deeper as the increased size (below 4.4 eV). Given that the CB energy level of ZnO was about 4.1 eV, this led to unfavorable charge injection and a significant interface charge recombination. Therefore, it's urgently required to develop an electron transport layer (ETL) with an energy band suitably aligned and without UV activation. Al was a widely used n-type dopant for metal oxides, which could increase the free carrier density and enhance conductivity. These made it possible to solve UV activation problems in ZnO. However, previously used Al-doped ZnO (AZO) electrodes were usually fabricated by vacuum processing which may limit their scalable fabrication. Additionally, the CB energy level of AZO was only 4.1 eV, which limited electron collection from the narrow bandgap CQD layer. In order to solve these problems, Sargent's group developed a solution-treated Al/Cl hybrid doped ZnO (CAZO) electrode. It was found that the well-defined CAZO electrode showed high conductivity regardless of UV activation. This CAZO electrode also exhibited a very deep CB level of ∼4.5 eV, which was beneficial for electron extraction. The resulting IR CQD solar cells using CAZO exhibited an IR EQE of 73% without UV activation. Additionally, the PCE was 0.92% under AM 1.5 illumination with 1100 nm long-wave-pass silicon filter, whereas the conventional ZnO devices only exhibited negligible PCEs (<0.01%) at the same conditions.
Solution-processed In2O3/ZnO heterojunction ETL has been used in the manufacture of efficient PbS CQD solar cells. The insertion of In2O3 between ITO and ZnO allowed for the growth of extremely smooth ETLs with enhanced electron mobility (10 times higher than that of single-layer ZnO). Additionally, the work function of the ITO/bilayer ETL cathode was noticeably reduced, which enlarged the built-in device potential and enhanced electron transfer from the PbX2-capped PbS CQDs (n-type). Konstantatos's group embedded a mixed nanocrystal (MNC) layer containing ZnO nanocrystals (NCs) and PbS CQDs between EMII–PbS/ZnO heterojunctions, i.e., the individual components of the heterojunction as a buffer layer (Fig. 9h). Remote trap passivation of PbS CQDs occurring in this MNC layer can reduce interface recombination and electron reverse transfer, thereby improving charge collection efficiency. The n-type PCBM was an effective alternative to the ZnO layer because it matched the energy level between the n-type and p-type layers of the heterojunction. Treating PCBM with TBAI (n-type doping) and introducing it between TiO2 and PbS layer not only reduced the interface recombination but also enhanced the collection of electrons from PbS to the electrode.

CQD photodetectors can be divided into three types: photoconductors, phototransistors, and photodiodes. Among them, the photoconductor detectors have the simplest device structure with two terminals, in which two ohmic contacts, source electrode and drain electrode are separated by a photosensitive layer (i.e. CQD film Fig. 10a). Its working principle is measuring the instantaneous change in semiconductor resistivity (or conductivity) under light. In the presence of sensitizing centers, photogenerated electron–hole pairs are separated, followed by trapping of one carrier (such as the electron). To maintain the charge neutrality, another charge carrier (hole) is recirculated through a symmetrical electrode before recombining with the opposite charge. An external voltage is applied to read out the change in conductivity caused by photons, and the gain (G) can be obtained by multi-carrier recirculation (Fig. 10d).

Phototransistor detector is a three-terminal device unlike a photoconductor detector (Fig. 10b). It is an optoelectronic amplifying switch, in which a gate-programmable semiconductor channel (CQD) can be photoelectrically modulated to promote or prevent charge transport (Fig. 10e) while providing gain. For example, the conductivity of a p-type chalcogenide CQD based device is increased by introducing holes via a negative bias. The function of the phototransistor is similar to the field-effect transistor (FET), and sometimes it's even called the optical FET (OFET).
Photodiodes are similar in structure to PV solar cells (Fig. 10c). Generally, they can be divided into the Schottky type, planar p–n type, p–i–n type, depleted bulk heterojunction type, and quantum junction type. However, their operating principles are the same: separation and collection of photogenerated electrons and holes by creating a built-in electric field (Fig. 10f). The device thickness should be critically determined because photogenerated charge carriers usually need to be collected across multiple areas within the device. Additionally, for charge carriers, the lifetime must be longer than the transit time. Thus, the increased diffusion length of carriers in the CQD film is beneficial, and the quantum efficiency of the device can be significantly improved. In ligand-exchanged CQD devices, the diffusion length of charge carriers is dominated by the mobility and the average spacing between recombination centers. Although CQD photodiodes operated at zero bias in photovoltaic mode have low noise current, they are usually worked under reverse bias in photoconductor mode to obtain high responsivity and bandwidth as well as a wide linear dynamic range.
In photodiodes, a reverse bias is applied to supplement the built-in potential. This can maintain a high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) even on a thick active layer. The requirement of applied voltage implies the weak carrier diffusion in a quasi-neutral material, which may be due to a high density of recombination-producing electronic trap states. For photodiodes, there exist some disadvantages resulting from the trap states in the bandgap. They will cause dark current generation, effective bandgap shrinking, and an increase in the thermal current generation. To produce highly sensitivity photodiode type detectors, it is required to meet the strict conditions required for photovoltaic devices. In fact, no matter what the structure of the detector is, it is necessary to increase the photocurrent while ensuring a low dark current, which is due to a strong dependence between the specific detectivity D* and the dark current density Jdark−1/2. Improving detector performance mainly starts from suppressing dark current, increasing sensitivity and gain, boosting bandwidth (response speed), and improving air stability.
In this part, the latest developments of CQD detectors are introduced from NIR (0.7–1.4 μm), SWIR (1.4–3 μm), and MWIR (3–8 μm), respectively. In the NIR and SWIR band, the PbX (X = S, Se) CQD photodetectors are dominant in discussing objects. Then, since it is a challenge to synthesize high-quality monodisperse PbS CQDs with a larger size, the HgY (Y = S, Se) CQD photodetectors are mainly discussed in the MWIR band. Finally, the progress in their application to infrared imaging is summarized.

In the preparation of photoconductive devices, the solid-state ligand exchange (SSE) method was often used to passivate the deposited CQD films. As discussed in the solar cell section above, this passivation strategy produced mid-gap trap states in the CQD films. These trap states could act as sensitizing centers and thereby prolonged the carrier lifetime, which would generate gain when enough electric field was applied. Since the gain was mainly achieved by extending the carrier lifetime, the response speed of the devices was limited. Therefore, it established a basic trade-off between photoconductive gain and bandwidth. An effective way to resolve this limitation was to prepare type-II planar bi-layer heterojunction photoconductor devices. For example, Bulović's group reported this type of photodetector with PCBM deposited on PbS CQDs. When the device was illuminated, photo-excited electrons were transferred from PbS CQDs to PCBM, and then the transferred electrons recombined with holes in PbS CQDs at the interface. It shortened the free-carrier lifetime in PbS CQD films and avoided trap-assisted recombination. The resulting device exhibited a bandwidth of >300 kHz under the illumination of light intensity of ∼57 mW cm−2. The similar type-II heterojunction devices included EDT–PbS/TBAI–PbS, TBAI–PbS/polymer PBDB-T, and SCN–PbS/perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 11a). Benefiting from effective charge transfer, both the responsivities and response times of these bi-layer devices have been improved compared to single-layer devices.

Recently, a hybrid ligand exchange method combining the firstly solution-phase pretreatment using methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) to the CQDs with the following SSE has also been applied to photoconductive detectors to improve device performance. The responsivity and specific detectivity were increased by 94% and 57% thanks to the shortened spacing between CQDs and increased ligand exchange ratio (Fig. 11b). Nevertheless, the CQD based photoconductor devices still exhibited a large dark current and a slow response speed (tens of millisecond, ms) limited by the intrinsic carrier concentration and defects.

Phototransistors have become the preferred structure for hybrid CQD-(two-dimensional) 2D detectors (Fig. 11c). This is because of the greater versatile ability to adjust the carrier dynamics and concentration in the devices than photoconductors. Hybrid phototransistors made by integrating CQDs with 2D materials showed gains that were several orders of magnitude larger than those devices with only CQDs. In such a hybrid device, both mechanisms (extended carrier lifetime and reduced transit time) can simultaneously contribute to a high gain. However, the gain was more dependent on the short transit time of the charge carriers in the 2D materials, rather than the long lifetime of the majority charge carriers of CQDs.

In 2012, Konstantatos's group made progress by introducing a hybrid combination of solution-processed PbS CQDs and high-conductivity 2D material graphene. In this type of device, light absorption and charge transport were performed in separately optimized stages: one stage for effective light absorption, and the other stage for fast charge transport. The EDT-capped CQD film was assembled into the graphene transport layer, which helped charge injection into the graphene and provided electron trap states. As a result, greater photoconductive gain (G ≈ 108 electrons per photon) was achieved. The measured R ∼ 107 A W−1 and D* ≈ 7 × 1013 Jones promoted the great progress of visible and SWIR imaging, but the time response of ∼10 ms constituted a serious limitation. Capping the CQDs with a shorter chain ligand can further improve the responsivity to 109 A W−1.
However, since the transport channel cannot be completely closed, zero-band-gap graphene would impede the full utilization of this hybrid architecture, which eventually led to a large dark current. Luckily, the emergence of 2D materials with high mobility, wide bandgap, and visible light absorption (such as MoS2) has promoted further development in this field. A TiO2 buffer layer was introduced at the interface between MoS2 and PbS CQDs. Fermi level pinning suppressed high-density local sub-bandgap states to maintain gate regulation, thereby reducing the dark current. The D* of this device was 5 × 1012 Jones, which was one order of magnitude higher than that of MoS2/PbS devices without buffer layers. The range of TMD materials used in the hybrid PbX CQD photodetectors has also been expanded to including tungsten disulfide (WS2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), which showed higher carrier mobility than MoS2. Highly sensitive phototransistor detectors based on monolayer p-type WSe2/n-type TBAI–PbS, n-type WS2/p-type EDT–PbS were therefore developed. Other 2D materials, such as SnS2 nanosheets, and black phosphorus can also form such hybrid devices with CQDs. When the cascade structure formed by the p–n homojunction EDT–PbS/TBAI–PbS was applied to the hybrid devices, the responsivity can be further improved due to the increase in the exciton dissociation rate. PbSe CQDs have also been integrated with 2D Bi2O2Se with a narrow bandgap of about 0.8 eV. The resulting devices exhibited a responsivity of about 103 A W−1 when operated at 2000 nm excitation and 100 V bias.
The separation of carrier transport and light absorption can also be realized in simpler structures, such as photo-junction field effect transistor (photo-JFET). A rectifying junction formed by iodine-treated n-type PbS CQDs and transparent conductive MoO3 was introduced into the device (Fig. 11d). Photo-JFET relied on a high resistance depletion region between the source and drain non-ohmic electrodes. In the darkness, the noise level was minimized due to the fully depleted channel. Once the device was illuminated, the photogenerated charges were separated due to the junction gate effect, and the two carriers accumulated on the opposite sides of the material. The accumulated photogenerated carriers between the source and the drain electrode would cause a shift of the Fermi level. When the Fermi level was aligned with the work function of the electrodes, charge collection could be more effective with applied voltage. This structure not only provided gain but also overcame the responsivity/speed/dark current trade-off, which was normally found in photoconductor devices. The resulting device showed a gain of 10 at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, while PbS CQD-based photoconductor devices usually only had a gain below 100 Hz. In 2017, Sargent's group prepared a photovoltage field-effect transistor using silicon for charge transport (Fig. 11e). This transistor can achieve IR light response due to the addition of CQD light absorbers. When the device was operating, the photovoltaic effect generated at the interface between silicon and CQDs. Thanks to the high transconductance characteristics of silicon, the device enabled high gain (>104, at 1500 nm wavelength), fast time response (<10 microsecond, μs, Fig. 11f), and adjustable wide spectral response. The sensitivity of this photovoltaic FET at 1500 nm 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the previously reported silicon-based infrared detectors. In short, it may be possible for detectors based on this hybrid phototransistor structure to overcome the traditional photodetection limitations posed by the dark current/gain/time response tradeoff.

Schottky-type photodiodes fabricated by selecting a suitable metal/semiconductor interface generated a built-in electric field, which could be used to extract photogenerated holes and electrons. The use of low work function metals with PbS CQDs usually formed a Schottky barrier. It's reported that PbS CQD photodiode detectors based on a Schottky barrier at the interface between PbS CQDs and an Al electrode, with the opposing ohmic contact formed by indium tin oxide (ITO), exhibited a 3 dB bandwidth of >1 MHz. In 2015, a meniscus-guided direct-writing technology was used to fabricate a hybrid, flexible P3HT single-nanowire:OA-capped PbS CQD photodetector based on Schottky contacts. This device showed the high detectivity of >1012 Jones.

Semiconductor–semiconductor heterojunction photodiodes were manufactured by combining PbS CQDs with organic or inorganic n-type semiconductors (charge extraction) and, in some cases, including π-conjugated polymers. The aligned energy levels of the used materials were beneficial for the collection of electrons and holes at opposite contacts. The heterojunction photodiodes were further divided into planar and bulk heterojunction photodiodes. Compared with Schottky photodiodes, p–n planar photodiode devices using p-type PbS CQDs and wide-bandgap n-type metal oxide (ZnO or TiO2) as the electron transport layer have shown a dark current reduction of up to two orders of magnitude. Recently, an inverted silicon–CQD heterojunction infrared photodetector prepared by combining n-type silicon and p-type CQDs was developed, which exhibited a detectivity of 1.47 × 1011 Jones at 1540 nm without bias.
To further improve the performance of IR PbS CQD photodiode detectors, Georgitzikis et al. optimized the thickness of the PbS layer in the TiO2:Nb/PbS planar heterojunction to a maximum of 150 nm (similar to the depletion region width). This fully depleted junction minimized recombination, thereby enhancing carrier collection via drift motion. Another advantage of the fully depleted junction devices was that they enabled ultrafast photoresponse with rise/fall times as short as 0.33 μs at zero voltage. This was due to the elimination of the neutral region that often caused a slower movement of the minority carriers (Fig. 12a). The interface modification can effectively reduce the dark current. For instance, electron injection current from ITO under reverse bias was suppressed by potential barrier layers such as NiO, CuOx, due to their higher conduction band energy level (Fig. 12b). Recently, ultra-large size PbS CQDs (average diameter of 16 nm) with monodispersity <10% and an absorption peak of up to 2530 nm were successfully obtained through multiple injections of sulfur sources. Furthermore, Dong et al. manufactured broadband photodetectors from visible light to SWIR, in which the absorption peak of PbS CQDs was 2100 nm. The EQE value of the resulting device in the visible region was benefited about 60% from these monodisperse CQDs. Additionally, the EQE at the SWIR peak wavelength was 25% (IQE > 50%) and the spectral detectivity was larger than 1 × 1011 Jones beyond 2 μm. This high detectivity was even comparable to those of some commercial detectors (Fig. 12c).
Some means of improving CQD solar cells can also be applied to photodiode detectors. Recently, there were reports of photodiode detectors made using n-type CQD inks. The trap states in the CQD films were reduced due to the improved surface passivation, and the detector exhibited a lower dark current and a response time in the order of microseconds. CQD inks were also used in combination with the energy level gradient structure, aiming at funneling photogenerated carriers with the aid of a gradient electric field. Hence, a quantum funnel photodiode was prepared under centrifugal colloidal casting. The resulting devices produced a 3 dB bandwidth of 1.2 MHz and a high near-infrared detectivity even at zero bias thanks to the enhanced drift-assisted carrier extraction. Moreover, the successful preparation of stable CQD inks dissolved in 1 wt% BTA: NMP solvent allowed the deposition of high uniformity film through inkjet-printing. It's a prerequisite for obtaining highly sensitive IR photodiode devices. The resulting p–i–n inkjet-printed photodetectors (spiro/PbS CQDs/ZnO) achieved very high specific detectivities of larger than 1012 Jones across the IR region (Fig. 12d). With the continuous development of device structures, various photodetectors were emerging. Recently, quantum junction detectors such as PbI2–PbS/EDT–PbS, TBAI–PbS/EDT–PbS and TBAI–PbS/BDT–PbS have been reported. Additionally, a bulk heterojunction organic–inorganic hybrid photodiode mixing OA-capped PbS CQDs and P3HT:PCBM was developed. The introduction of P3HT and PCBM promoted the efficient transport of holes and electrons in CQDs, respectively, resulting in an EQE of 51% and a D*(λ) of 2.3 × 109 Jones.
The use of trap-assisted external circuit carrier tunneling injection to achieve photomultiplication (i.e. EQE > 100%) in the CQD photodiode type detectors has become a research hotspot in recent years.Table 2 lists the recent progress of CQD-based photodiode devices with gain. Dong et al. introduced zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles into the PbS CQDs:P3HT:PCBM hybrid film and the resulting device exhibited an EQE of 1624% (Fig. 12e), and a D*(λ) of 2.2 × 1011 Jones. The doped ZnO nanoparticles can capture photo-generated electrons due to the lowest LUMO and trap state energy levels, thereby triggering hole injection from the Al electrode (Fig. 12f). In 2015, a p–i–n photodiode made up of a p-type layer ((1,1-bis[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane, TAPC)), an intrinsic layer (1,3-benzenedithiol treated PbS CQDs), and a n-type layer (ZnO) was successfully developed. This type of photodiode exhibited extremely high G values (maximum EQE (λ) ≈ 18700%) and a high detectivity of 7 × 1013 Jones. It can be noted that the EQE (λ) was larger than 100%. It's mainly attributed to the significant secondary photocurrent. The photoconductive process originated from the carrier injection caused by light and bias, which contributed to the high D*(λ). However, the temporal response of the p–i–n structure photodiode was slow, often in ms (close to that of the photoconductor devices). Recently, Gong's group reported a flexible photodetector prepared via an all-solution-processed technique at room temperature, with a detectivity of larger than 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and a responsivity of 230 mA W−1 in the wavelength region from 300 to 2600 nm. The traps on the surface of the PbSe CQDs can capture a small number of electrons. Then the trapped electrons would shift the energy level of the PbSe CQDs downward dramatically, which induced the re-alignment of its Fermi level with the work function of the Al cathode. Therefore, a large number of holes can be easily injected from the cathode Al through the ohmic contact to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PbSe CQDs (Fig. 12g) under a small negative bias. As a result, the photoelectric response was largely improved. Similarly, Ag nanoparticles were embedded in the ZnO ETL layer to promote the accumulation of photogenerated electrons under illumination, resulting in the bending of the ZnO valence band. It facilitated the hole tunneling injection current from the ITO electrode (Fig. 12h).

Schottky and p–n devices often exhibit low noise current compared to photoconductor and phototransistor devices. Additionally, they can be operated effectively under zero bias, thereby limiting the noise current to a level close to thermal noise. To improve the EQE, enhance response speed, and reduce the dark current, the active layer thickness should be optimized to achieve fully depleted devices. Meanwhile, potential barriers were introduced to block carrier injection from the device electrodes for further device performance improvement. This in turn improved the NEP and subsequently increased linear dynamic range by lowering the dark current.
The emergence of PbX CQDs has led to great success being achieved in CQD based photodetectors. In order to help them further develop and provide references for future commercial design rules, there are still some challenges to be overcome. Further control of CQD synthesis and subsequent CQD stability should be developed. It's also important to understand the dependence of optoelectronic device performances (such as air stability) on CQD sizes and passivation strategies. Moreover, it's necessary to deepen the understanding between charge transport and traps in PbX CQD films.

HgTe CQDs were widely used as the absorbing materials because they have been demonstrated the highest spectral tunability achieved so far by colloidal materials for the MWIR and LWIR. In 2011, Guyot-Sionnest's group reported the first MWIR photoconductor devices via directly drop-casting HgTe CQDs on interdigitated electrodes. Although the as-deposited CQD film omitted ligand exchange, it exhibited high electrical conductivity due to CQD aggregation (Fig. 13a). Further characterizations evidenced the high carrier mobility of ∼0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CQD films. Additionally, the CQD films showed efficient charge separation under illumination. The resulting devices based on HgTe CQDs with 6 μm absorption cut off exhibited a high responsivity of up to 100 mA W−1 (10 V bias) at room temperature (Fig. 13b). Meanwhile, they had a relatively high specific detectivity of 2 × 109 Jones at 130 K (1 kHz). The response time was below 100 ns, meeting the requirement of imaging.

In order to improve the size dispersion and colloidal stability of CQDs, the same group optimized the synthesis method, which reduced CQD aggregation (Fig. 13c). It implied the necessity of ligand exchange for efficient carrier transport in the deposited CQD films. Unluckily, the films treated with traditional organic ligands were proved to have low carrier mobility (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and to be easily oxidized in air, which led to a high dark current and slow response speed. However, As2S3-treated HgTe CQD film (3.5 μm absorption peak) possessed higher mobility and greater air stability than the one treated with organic ligands (Fig. 13d). As a result, the detectivity of such photodetectors was up to 1010 Jones at 1 kHz frequency and 230 K temperature, which was improved 30 times compared to the aggregated CQD based devices (Fig. 13e). The other advantage of selecting As2S3 was its high transparency in the MWIR, whereas typical organic ligands had strong vibrational modes in the MWIR.
In 2016, Tang et al. successfully achieved large arrays of three-pixel photodetectors (12 × 12 on a 0.5 inch × 0.5 inch chip) using the poly(methyl methacrylate)-assisted transfer technique (Fig. 13f). Such detectors can respond to different spectral ranges of IR due to the broad spectral tunability of HgTe CQDs. The absorption cutoff of HgTe CQDs with three different sizes were 4.8, 6, and 9.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 13g). As a result, all three-pixel photodetectors showed room-temperature responsivities of tens of mA W−1 across each targeted IR spectral region (Fig. 13h). In the same year, Guyot-Sionnest's group first demonstrated MWIR imaging via HgTe CQD-based focal plane arrays (FPAs), in which CQDs were directly solution-processed on commodity ROIC. Although the CQD layer thickness was not optimized and the device structure lacked anti-reflection coating, the mean detectivity was up to 109 Jones at 95 K, while the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) was 2.3 K. In 2018, Halpert et al. reported the first room-temperature and four-color MWIR (2–5 μm) detectors with a “color” sensitivity down to 300 nm (Fig. 13i). Such high-performance photodetectors paved the way for video imaging.
Similar to the development of ligand-exchange of PbX CQDs, HgTe CQD-based inks were successfully prepared. Recently, Guyot-Sionnest's group used a hybrid ligand exchange and polar phase transfer to control the n- and p-type doping in HgTe CQD films by adjusting the HgCl2 concentration in this process. This method brought an ∼100-fold increase of the carrier mobility, and an ∼100-fold increase in responsivity compared with solid-state ligand exchange with EDT.
The photoconductor devices provided very limited control over the distribution and transport of charge carriers in the semiconductor layer. This limitation can be overcome by adding the “gate voltage” through the FET structure. Recently, Dayen et al. took advantage of a high capacitance ion glass gate electrode, a large-area graphene electrode, and a high carrier mobility HgTe CQD layer to construct a 2D/0D hybrid infrared photodetector (Fig. 13j). The introduction of a graphene electrode combined with ionic glass enabled the selective reconstruction of HgTe CQDs and graphene electrode between the electron (n) and hole (p) doping states. Therefore, this 2D/0D p–n junction can be expanded throughout the device and had a built-in electric field that facilitated charge separation. In this particular structure, the signal-to-noise ratio of infrared photoelectric detection can be increased by two orders of magnitude. Further, a photovoltaic operation can be achieved. The detectivity reached was 109 Jones while the device absorbed only 8% of the incident light. Also, the device had a fast response (<10 μs), which was strikingly in contrast to the slow response normally observed in 2D/0D hybrid heterojunctions.

Photoconductor devices usually showed low specific detectivity due to the high 1/f noise, which can be minimized in zero-bias operated photodiode detectors. A Schottky diode detector based on EDT ligand-exchanged HgTe CQD film as the absorption layer was reported (Fig. 14a). Its structure was CaF2 substrate/5 nm NiCr layer/HgTe CQD film/Ag top contact. Benefiting from the shorter carrier transport distance compared to that of the previous photoconductor devices, the resulting devices exhibited a high responsivity of ∼80 mA W−1 (Fig. 14b and c). Besides, a higher detectivity of 1010 Jones at 140 K was obtained due to the absence of 1/f noise. It should be noted that the rectifying junctions inside these reported devices were formed by intrinsic HgTe CQD layers and Ag-diffused p-type HgTe layers. To further improve device performance, the Ag2Te CQD layer was added in between the intrinsic HgTe CQD layer and the Ag electrode. As a result, the devices showed a detectivity of 4 × 1010 Jones with photoresponse cut-off at 5.25 μm (90 K). This work further disclosed that the photocurrent fluctuation from ambient background radiation exceeded the intrinsic noise of the device at this low temperature. Therefore, the detector has reached a background limited infrared performance (BLIP) regime.

Further, p–n heterojunction photodiode detectors were developed based on this Schottky diode study.Fig. 14d depicts the structure of this bottom illuminated device: ITO/EDT ligand-exchanged thick HgTe CQD layer/HgCl2 treated Ag2Te CQD layer/Au top electrode (back reflector). Compared to previous Schottky devices, a significant performance improvement was achieved for the resulting devices (Fig. 14e and f). They exhibited a detectivity larger than 1011 Jones (<100 K) and reached BLIP at 140 K. Additionally, when the temperature was at 230 K (accessible temperature of compact thermoelectric coolers), the detectivity was up to 109 Jones with a cutoff wavelength between 4 and 5 μm, which was higher than that of a microbolometer. Note that the HgCl2 treatment of the Ag2Te CQD layer (solid-state cation exchange method) played a key role in obtaining a stable and reproducible rectifying junction. Enhanced optical absorption by incorporating an interference structure to the above device can further improve device performance. Scanning thermal imaging test showed the device having a NETD of 56 mK at 90 K. This interference structure used a 5 nm Au layer as a top semitransparent electrode, which introduced a large series resistance. As a result, device performance was degraded at increased temperatures.
Another method to enhance absorption was by employing plasmonic nanostructures. In order to improve the plasmon resonance in the MWIR region and induce the optical resonant cavity effect, three key parameters should be optimized. They included the diameter of the plasmonic discs, the thickness of the HgTe CQD layer and the Au layer, respectively. This method contributed to a high responsivity of 1.46 A W−1 at 4.5 μm resonance wavelength and had a minimal effect on the noise level of the detectors. When plasmonic and interference structures were both applied to the same detector (Fig. 14g), a higher device performance can be achieved (Fig. 14h). The resulting devices exhibited a detectivity of 1010 Jones at 220 K. Moreover, the NETD had been measured to be as low as 14 mK in the thermal imaging test of the device. This low NETD value was a typically representative of the MWIR FPA photodetectors. Recently, Guyot-Sionnest's group reported a two-terminal HgTe CQD dual-band detector (Fig. 14i) that can switch responses in two different spectra (SWIR and MWIR) by changing the polarity of bias voltage (Fig. 14j), in which the modulation frequency was up to 100 kHz. A vertical stack of two rectifying junctions in a back-to-back diode configuration was created through a reliable and spatially stable doping process (Fig. 14k), contributing to a high D* above 1010 Jones at cryogenic temperatures.

The above discussed MWIR CQD detectors followed the interband optical transition, in which light-induced electrons and holes were created at the first conduction (1Se) and first valence energy (1Sh) levels, respectively (1Se–1Sh) whereas for intraband CQDs, the light-induced carriers were generated inside the valence (or conduction) states. It has been discussed that the critical role of precise doping for high performance in the photoconductors based on intraband CQDs. If the intraband CQDs were ideally doped, the resulting films would possess the strongest absorption. It's attributed to the most electrons available for photoexcitation to the second conduction energy level (1Pe), as is shown in Fig. 15a. Meanwhile, the least number of holes were available in 1Se to recombine with light-induced electrons, leading to the longest carrier lifetime. Moreover, the lowest dark current was obtained in this scene because of the lack of empty energy levels for electron hopping. Therefore, photoconductor devices made from this ideally doped CQD film would have the largest resistivity change under illumination (Fig. 15b). In fact, precise control of doping in CQD films using common ligands was difficult, which usually resulted in under-doped of CQDs. The carrier distribution and transport in the under-doped intraband CQDs in the darkness and under illumination are shown in Fig. 15c and d, respectively. The resistivity changed only when the difference of carrier mobility between 1Se and 1Pe was large enough if the intraband CQDs were not ideally doped.

HgSe CQDs that absorbed MWIR photons were successfully synthesized in recent years. The doped HgSe CQDs often exhibited narrowband absorption due to the specific intraband transition between the 1Se and 1Pe levels. The main feature of intraband transitions was the Lorentzian line shape of optical absorption: when the incident infrared photon energy (Ephoton) matched with the intraband energy gap (Eintra), the strongest optical absorption can be obtained; otherwise, the absorption is quickly decreased if Ephoton is larger or smaller than Eintra. Therefore, the photodetectors made using HgSe CQDs can detect a specific wavelength of infrared light. In 2014, Guyot-Sionnest's group first realized photoconductor devices based on HgSe CQDs using intraband transition (intraband absorption peak: ∼4.4 μm) (Fig. 15e). The resulting devices with CQDs passivated by EDT using SSE exhibited a responsivity of 0.38 mA W−1 and a detectivity of 2 × 109 Jones (500 Hz) at 80 K. Further, it has been reported that the HgSe CQD film passivated with As2S3 could maintain n-type doping. Meanwhile, it showed a field-effect mobility of ∼100 cm2 V−1 s−1, contributing to the high responsivity of 0.8 A W−1 (Fig. 15f). The room temperature specific detectivity was 108 Jones, which was comparable to that of commercial deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detectors. Similar to the development of HgTe CQD based photodetectors, the plasmonic structure was also applied to the devices with HgSe intraband CQDs for increasing absorption. Based on the near-field resonance created by the gold nanodisk structure (Fig. 15g), the responsivity at the center wavelength of the HgSe CQD-based narrowband photodetectors can be increased. Additionally, the full-width at half-maxima of spectral responsivity was less than 2 μm (Fig. 15h), which indicated a very sharp spectral responsivity.
Ag2Se CQDs with a tetragonal crystal structure were an alternative non-toxic material with intraband absorption in MWIR. They had an excess of silver, which induced an excess of electrons in CQDs. By adjusting CQD sizes, their intraband absorption in MWIR could be tuned due to the stable presence of excess electrons. Previous photoluminescence measurements obviously demonstrated the observed intraband optical transitions (Fig. 15i). In 2018, Qu et al. first reported the MWIR photoconductor devices based on EDT-passivated Ag2Se CQDs. However, only a responsivity of 8 μA W−1 was obtained at 25 K measured using a 4.4 μm, 10 mW quantum cascade laser (Fig. 15j). Another work of Ag2Se CQD based photoconductor devices reported a responsivity of 350 μA W−1 around 4.5 μm at 90 K under 4 V bias (Fig. 15k), in which CQDs were synthesized based on oleylamine. These limited responsivities were orders of magnitude lower than that of HgSe CQD based devices, which required further efforts in synthesis, ligand exchange, and device structure to examine the full potential of this new type of CQDs.
Interestingly, although the bandgap of the PbS bulk material was 0.41 eV (interband transition absorption <3 μm), Konstantatos's group successfully prepared MWIR photoconductors by replacing the sulfur atoms in PbS with iodine atoms through a simple ligand exchange process. This heavy doping suggested that the 1Se levels in CQDs can be filled with charge carriers at a rate of more than one electron per dot. When the material was illuminated with low energy photons, these electrons were excited from 1Se to 1Pe in the conduction band. Using this method to adjust the conductivity of the material, the CQDs were very sensitive to MWIR and LWIR radiation (Fig. 15l). The resulting devices had a responsivity of 10−4 A W−1 at 80 K, which needed further optimization.

Stability and operating lifetime are the main concerns for photodetectors when used in practical applications such as imaging. Commonly, devices can maintain ∼80% of their initial performance after storage under ambient conditions over a few weeks, but this time it was extended to a few months while storing under inert conditions. NIR imaging based on PbS CQD photodiode devices, which were fabricated on the top of amorphous silicon active matrix (a-Si AM) thin-film transistor panels has been demonstrated (Fig. 16a and b). These image sensors exhibited at least one year of a lifetime in a climatic chamber. Additionally, passivating PbS CQD films with an Al2O3 barrier layer also led to the achievement of air-stable SWIR photodetectors.

In 2015, PbS CQD based FPAs and camera prototype devices was demonstrated, in which PbS CQD:C60 heterojunction photodiodes were monolithically integrated with Si ROIC (Fig. 16c and d). These arrays exhibited a broadband spectral response from 0.4 μm to 2 μm. Moreover, they showed a fast response time of ∼2 μs, a linear dynamic range of ∼60 dB, and a high detectivity of ∼1012 Jones. The high detectivity over broad spectra can compete with the currently dominant commercial photodetectors such as InGaAs devices (Fig. 16e). The IR performance of these arrays also exceeded the capability of Si-based photodetectors. Recently, Georgitzikis et al. used photolithography technology to integrate the CQD infrared photodetector (CQDIP) with the Si ROIC (Fig. 16f). The results showed the feasibility of pixel pitches down to 40 μm, opening the way towards high resolution monolithic infrared images and the incorporation of infrared and visible sensitive pixels side by side. In 2020, an optical up-conversion flexible device that integrated a PbS CQD IR photodetector and a CdSe/ZnS shell/core CQD LED (Fig. 16g) was successfully applied to biological imaging (Fig. 16h). Recently, Guyot-Sionnest's group demonstrated the dual-band infrared imaging based on the HgTe CQD photodetector for the first time (Fig. 16i).

In the past ten years, the deepening understanding of the electronic structure of CQDs and the interaction between CQDs and capping ligands has laid a significant foundation for the development of CQD-based optoelectronic devices. Not only are various ligands emerging, but also the methods of ligand exchange are constantly being improved. It is difficult for a single inorganic or organic ligand to meet the requirements of complete passivation and good air stability simultaneously, but the synergy of organic/inorganic hybrid ligands can effectively solve this problem. CQD inks enable the complete ligand exchange in the solution phase and this allows single-step deposition, which eliminates the fabrication complexity and raw material waste in solid-state ligand exchange. Furthermore, the required film thickness can be obtained more easily. Nowadays, CQD inks achieved via solution-phase ligand exchange have become the first choice for the scalable fabrication of CQD films via doctor-blade coating and spray-coating. However, most studies focus on the passivation of small-sized dots (diameter <3.5 nm), whereas large-sized dots need new strategies to conduct complete passivation such as the dually passivated scheme. Advances in the device structure also effectively promote device efficiency. For example, the depleted bulk heterojunction allows a thicker CQD layer to obtain better IR absorption; the inherent energy band matching of the quantum junction with precise doping control provides a widened depletion region to improve the carrier collection efficiency. Interface engineering plays a crucial role in further improving the performance, in which the bilayer transport layers not only improve the carrier collection but also effectively reduce the leakage current. Moreover, the mixed intermediate layer can reduce the interface recombination and enhance the carrier collection from CQDs to the acceptor material.

For CQD detectors, the compromise of dark current/sensitivity/bandwidth must be resolved. It needs the development of novel device structures. For instance, 0D–2D hybrid phototransistors and photojunction FETs separate light absorption and carrier transport to achieve a high gain; photomultiplication photodiodes use external circuit carrier tunneling injection to improve responsivity. Now, it is not difficult to simultaneously achieve high responsivity and detectivity. The challenge of CQD-based photodetectors is the slow response speed (often at the ms or μs level), which is much slower than that (nanosecond or faster level) of traditional semiconductor-based photodetectors. The slow response speed of CQD devices originates from the low mobility and large trap state of CQDs, which limits their potential for high-speed applications. Therefore, it pushes us to pursue CQD films with high carrier mobility and lower defect density, which can be resolved using solution-phase ligand exchange to fabricate inks. The films made from CQD inks often exhibit higher carrier mobility compared to those fabricated by solid-state ligand exchange, thereby contributing to a faster response. Another strategy to achieve ultrafast response in the photodiode is to eliminate the neutral region, in which diffusion motion determined by a slower movement of the minority carriers is undesirable. Meanwhile, photogenerated carriers in the space charge region will drift to electrodes directly under bias voltage in this fully depleted device, which ultimately leads to ultrafast photoresponse. The detection performance of SWIR CQD detectors can compete with those of some commercial detectors, but the corresponding MWIR performance still needs intense research to be improved. The detection of MWIR often requires the use of optical management such as plasmas to enhance absorption, or the use of precise doping to achieve a heterojunction (increasing carrier collection) or a structure where two p–n junctions are stacked (widening absorption range). In a word, more and more studies of IR photodetectors should be done to achieve the goal of large-area, high-performance, multi-band detection, and high-temperature operation.
In practical applications, the most important challenge of CQD optoelectronic devices air stability, especially under continuous photostress and operation mode. One of the reliable solutions is to introduce an additional buffer layer such as KI to the CQD surface to prevent oxidation of CQDs. Then we should consider the nanotoxicity and biocompatibility of these IR CQDs. Unluckily, most of them are synthesised by hazardous metal precursors. Non-toxic and environment-friendly CQDs should be largely developed such as Ag2Se CQDs. The final concern is the cost of CQD production and device fabrication, which should be minimised as much as possible. It involves the optimization of synthetic routes, the choice of cheap and safe solvents, and the development of economical processing technologies and facilities.
In summary, both photovoltaic solar cells and photodetectors need to advance in the same direction of the uniform size distribution of CQDs, free traps in the bandgap, high optoelectronic performance, good air stability, and scalable fabrication. Meanwhile, further improvement of the IR light absorption and the carrier collection with the aid of carefully designed device structure and interface optimization will ultimately promote the industrial development of CQDs in the IR field.
