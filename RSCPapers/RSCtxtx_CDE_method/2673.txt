High efficiency inverted organic solar cells are fabricated using the PTB7:PC71BM polymer by incorporating Zn-doped TiO2 (ZTO) and 0.05 wt% PEO:ZTO as interfacial electron transport layers. The 0.05 wt% PEO-modified ZTO device shows a significantly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.10%, compared to that of the ZTO (7.67%) device.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a promising alternative for producing clean and renewable energy because of their potential for the large area fabrication process, lightweight, flexibility, and inexpensiveness. Polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have recently reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9% in single junction devices. Significant efforts have been made to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs through modifications in interlayer and device architectures. One of the disadvantages of OSCs is their low chemical stability, which is due to the oxidation of their interfaces by oxygen and water and the photodegradation of the active layers. In order to improve their stability, various methods have been employed. Recently, an OSC with an inverted structure was developed, which was shown to be more stable than conventional solar cells. In most conventional OSCs, a PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and a low-work-function metal electrode (Ca or Ba) are generally used. However, the strong acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS leads to degradation of the ITO electrode, which imposes a large problem with respect to device stability and reproducibility of solar cells. In particular, the low-work-function metal is susceptible to degradation by oxygen and water vapor. In addition, optical loss due to absorption of the PEDOT:PSS film is significant, approaching 10% in the visible range and even higher in the near infrared region. Some reports have shown that PEDOT:PSS is also an inefficient electron-blocking layer, reducing the efficiency of electronic devices through electron leakage to the anode electrode. For these reasons, alternative high work function electrodes have been explored and demonstrated by replacing PEDOT:PSS with transition metal-oxides such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3),vanadium oxide (V2O5), tungsten oxide (WO3), and nickel oxide (NiO). One key challenge in making efficient inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs) lies in the electron transport layer (ETL). This layer should satisfy several criteria, such as high transparency, high electron affinity energy, and efficiency to collect the electrons. A number of studies have been carried out in IOSCs using the TiO2 film as an ETL, owing to its superior air stability when compared to other semiconductor oxides.

In order to increase the device performance of inverted solar cells, several groups have studied the use of the metal doped n-type buffer layer. The metal doping is an effective procedure to modify the grain size, orientation, conductivity and could greatly influence the optical and electrical properties of the n-type buffer layer. In recent years, some researchers have suggested that doping the TiO2 film with metal ions could be a promising approach to improve the electron transfer in the TiO2 electrode. Zn-doped TiO2 (ZTO) has some merits due to its high transparency, low material cost, more stability and small lattice mismatch upon doping compared with those of other doped TiO2 films. Zn has been investigated as a n-type dopant for TiO2 because it can occupy some of the Ti sites in the TiO2 crystal. To enhance the electron transport properties in the TiO2 films, Zn was used in this work as a doping impurity. The efficiency of solar cells has been found to be improved on using a ZTO interfacial layer. Herein, we prepared the TiO2 and ZTO ETL on an ITO electrode by solution processing using titanium (IV) butoxide, 2-methoxyethanol, acetylacetone, and zinc acetate dihydrate, and then the films were subjected to thermal annealing at 500 °C for 1 hour in air. The solution processed TiO2 and ZTO layers are highly transparent in the visible range and show effective electron transport properties. In this communication, we report about the development of a generally applicable ETL by polyethylene oxide (PEO) modification of the TiO2 and ZTO surface. The IOSCs composed of thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blend show considerably improved device performance when PEO:TiO2 and PEO:ZTO electron transport layers (ETLs) formed by the spin coating technique are used. Especially, we have achieved an efficiency of 7.51% and 8.10% for IOSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM by using PEO:TiO2 and PEO:ZTO films as the ETLs, respectively.
The inverted device structure, molecular structures of PTB7, PC71BM, and the energy levels of the component materials are shown in Fig. 1. The energy levels of PTB7, PC71BM, and MoO3 (ref. 25) were taken from the literature. The work function of TiO2, PEO:TiO2, ZTO and PEO:ZTO films was measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and the band gap (Eg) obtained from the UV absorption spectra is shown in Fig. S1 and S2 and Table S1. When light irradiates the photoactive layer of the solar cells through an ITO electrode, the active layer will absorb photons to produce excitons and the excitons will diffuse towards and dissociate at the PTB7:PC71BM interface into electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor PC71BM and holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor PTB7. Since the LUMO level of TiO2 (−4.46 eV) is the same as that of PC71BM, electrons can easily transport to the ITO electrode through TiO2. As the HOMO level (−7.66 eV) of TiO2 is much lower than that (−5.15 eV) of PTB7, it blocks the hole transport from PTB7 to the ITO electrode. The HOMO level (−5.3 eV) of MoO3 is very close to the HOMO level (−5.15 eV) of PTB7, and this facilitates the hole transfer to the Al electrode through MoO3. The relatively high-lying LUMO (−2.3 eV) of MoO3 prevents the electron transfer from PC71BM to the Al electrode.
In order to study the composition of TiO2 and ZTO films, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. The XPS spectra of TiO2 and ZTO films are shown in Fig. S3. The binding energies of ZTO are 457.02 eV, 462.77 eV and 528.21 eV for Ti2p3/2, Ti2p1/2 and O1s respectively. These binding energies are found to be shifted towards the higher energy side compared to those of TiO2 (456.6, 462.42 and 527.85 eV for Ti2p3/2, Ti2p1/2 and O1s, respectively). This result suggests that zinc is incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. Fig. S3c shows the peaks at 1019.89 eV and 1042.86 eV corresponding to the Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2 binding energy levels of zinc. The chemical constituents present in the sample according to the XPS results are Ti = 24.32 at.%, and O = 75.68 at.% for TiO2, Ti = 23.50 at.%, O = 74.82 at.%, Zn = 1.68 at.% for ZTO.

Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of PTB7:PC71BM, TiO2/PTB7:PC71BM and ZTO/PTB7:PC71BM films. The PTB7:PC71BM blend film exhibits a strong absorption covering a range from 300 to about 800 nm. It is observed that TiO2/PTB7:PC71BM and ZTO/PTB7:PC71BM show strong absorption from 450 to 650 nm when compared to the PTB7:PC71BM film. Moreover, it could also be seen that the Zn dopant improved the optical absorption performance of the TiO2 film. Absorption spectra of TiO2 and ZTO films are shown in Fig. S4. Absorption spectra of ZTO show that the absorption edge is slightly shifted towards the shorter wavelength (blue shift) when compared to that of TiO2. This shift towards shorter wavelengths indicates the increase of band gap on Zn doping. It is mainly attributed to the Burstein–Moss effect, since the absorption edge of a degenerate semiconductor is shifted to shorter wavelengths with increasing carrier concentration.
It is well known that the electrical properties of the interfacial layers are very important for the performance of the devices because they will affect charge transport at the interface. The resistivity of TiO2 and ZTO thin films is 0.401 × 10−3 Ω cm and 0.352 × 10−3 Ω cm, respectively. The resistivity value of ZTO is small when compared to that of TiO2. The lower resistivity of the film after doping with the optimum Zn content can be explained by the fact that the Zn atom substitutes the Ti atom in the crystal lattice and behaves as a donor and induces native n-type conductivity in the TiO2 film. The mobility has been measured by the bottom-gate top-contact thin film transistor (TFT) method. The mobility is found to be 3.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TiO2 and ZTO (Fig. S5) thin films respectively.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs fabricated using various PEO:TiO2 ETLs are shown in Fig. 2b and S6a and these have been measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. The solar cell parameters, short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rshunt), are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, the reference device using TiO2 shows a Jsc of 14.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, a FF of 62.22% and a PCE of 6.98%. The device performance was considerably improved when PEO-modified TiO2 was used as the ETL. The highest efficiency was achieved when 0.05 wt% PEO-modified TiO2 was used as the ETL, which exhibited a Jsc of 15.51 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, a FF of 63.34% and a PCE of 7.51%. However, as the PEO concentration was further increased, the device performance decreased. When the PEO concentration was increased to 0.3 wt%, the device showed a reduced Jsc of 15.40 mA cm−2 and a reduced FF of 61.14%, giving a PCE of 7.06%. We calculated the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rshunt) from the J–V curve. The reference TiO2 device shows a Rs of 10.28 Ω cm2 and a Rshunt of 451.61 Ω cm2. The 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2 device exhibited the smallest Rs of 9.22 Ω cm2 and the highest Rshunt of 1198.16 Ω cm2. The reduced Rs is favorable for charge collection and the increased Rshunt indicates reduced leakage current as well as restrained recombination loss of carriers, which explains the improved FF and Jsc. When the PEO concentration is increased to 0.3 wt%, the Rs of the device increases to 9.46 Ω cm2, which renders a large energy barrier for charge collection. In this case, many carriers recombine before they are collected at the electrodes. Therefore, small FF and Jsc can be expected when charge collection is inefficient due to the presence of large Rs. The dark J–V characteristics shown in Fig. 2c and S6b show that the 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2 device exhibited excellent diode characteristics and lower leakage current under reverse bias than the device based on TiO2. The incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs are shown in Fig. 2d and S6b. It is observed that the 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2 based device showed a maximum IPCE of 78%, which is higher than 72% of the TiO2 device. The Jsc values have been calculated using IPCE data with an AM1.5G reference spectrum. Jsc is found to be 14.51 and 15.20 mA cm−2 for TiO2 and 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2 respectively. These values match well with those obtained from J–V measurement.

The J–V characteristics of the PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs fabricated using ETLs of ZTO and PEO-modified ZTO are shown in Fig. 3a and S7a and Table 1. A similar variation in the performance of the PEO:ZTO based device was observed as previous PEO:TiO2 based devices. The 0.05 wt% PEO-modified ZTO device shows a considerably improved Jsc of 16.14 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.83% as compared to the reference device, which shows a Jsc of 15.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.78%. Consequently, the device using a 0.05 wt% PEO-modified ZTO layer shows a considerably improved PCE of 8.10% as compared to 7.67% of the device with the ZTO layer. The IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 3b and S7c confirm the improved Jsc of the device based on the PEO-modified ZTO layer. The device-performance stability data of TiO2, 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2, ZTO and 0.05 wt% PEO:ZTO based devices are shown in Fig. S8. We observed that TiO2 and 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2 based devices almost retain their original efficiency even after 30 days under ambient conditions with reduction of PCE from 6.98 to 6.72% and 7.51 to 7.30%, while for the device fabricated using ZTO and 0.05 wt% PEO:ZTO ETL the PCE decreased from 7.67 to 7.32% and 8.10 to 7.82% under the same conditions. This clearly shows that TiO2, PEO:TiO2, ZTO and PEO:ZTO based devices exhibit good stability.
To investigate the effect of PEO modification on surface defects of TiO2 films, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded for various PEO modified TiO2 films and are shown in Fig. S9. As can be seen, two emission peaks were observed. The narrow emission band at 372 nm is attributed to radiative annihilation of excitons, while the intense broad emission around 440 nm is assigned to the trap emission. It shows clearly that the defect emission is considerably restrained by surface modification of TiO2 by PEO, indicating reduced surface traps in TiO2 after PEO surface modification. It is proposed that PEO species coordinate with TiO2 by sharing a lone electron pair of oxygen in the PEO backbone, which effectively passivates the surface traps of TiO2. The fill-up of surface electron traps of TiO2 favors the improvement in the conductivity of the TiO2 interlayer, leading to the reduced Rs of the devices. Moreover, the reduction of traps can decrease the possibility of trap-assisted interfacial recombination of carriers and consequently increase the Rshunt of devices. Both reasons contribute to the improved Jsc and FF for the PEO-modified TiO2 based devices when the PEO concentration is less than 0.3 wt%. Fig. S10 shows the PL spectra of PEO:ZTO films. A similar variation in the PL spectra of PEO:ZTO films was observed as previous PEO:TiO2 films.
Another factor influencing the performance of these devices is the interfacial morphology properties. The surface roughness of TiO2, PEO:TiO2, ZTO and PEO:ZTO films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness is found to be 0.34 nm and 2.80 nm for TiO2 and 0.05 wt% PEO:TiO2 respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 4c and d, uniform ZTO and 0.05 wt% PEO:ZTO films composed of small grains are observed. The surface roughness is found to be 0.22 nm and 0.41 nm for ZTO and 0.05 wt% PEO:ZTO respectively. However, when the PEO concentration is further increased to 0.3 wt%, a rough surface is observed in the TiO2 and ZTO films (Fig. S11 and S12). The variation in the surface morphology may be due to the change in the surface properties of TiO2 and ZTO films after PEO modification.
In conclusion, high efficiency IOSCs fabricated with solution-processed PEO:TiO2 and PEO:ZTO films as ETLs have been demonstrated. It is found that PEO-modification of TiO2 or the ZTO film surface can effectively passivate the surface traps present in TiO2 or ZTO, and suppress the recombination loss of carriers, reduce the series resistance and improve the electrical coupling of the TiO2/active layer or the ZTO/active layer. For PEO:TiO2 and PEO:ZTO based IOSCs, the PCEs are significantly improved from the reference 6.98% and 7.51% to 7.67% and 8.10%.
