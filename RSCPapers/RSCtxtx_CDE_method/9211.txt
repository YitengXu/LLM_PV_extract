While energy shortage is always an issue, the impending exhaustion of fossil fuel sources makes it an ever increasingly pressing one. Photovoltaic technology brings hope in the struggle to alleviate this problem, but no solar cell has yet fulfilled the requirements of the viability of large scale production together with high efficiency and low cost. Fortunately, recently reported organic–inorganic halide perovskites, possessing the desirable properties of a high absorption coefficient, a long charge diffusion length, an appropriate band gap, and solution processability, show great potential for photovoltaic applications. Within a few years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 19.3%. Reports on new preparation methods and materials continue to emerge. While reviews have focused on mechanisms, cell structures, preparation methods and materials applied, it is important to give a combined overview of all these aspects. Furthermore, this review considers the newly reported preparation methods and mechanisms and summarizes the applied materials for each function of these solar cells.

Evolving from dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells are regarded as “the Next Big Thing” in photovoltaics. 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was predicted in the early stages of research, and 19.3% PCE has already been achieved. Although intensive studies have been focusing on hybrid perovskites recently, these materials were first discovered by Weber almost 36 years ago. Their structure and properties were further elucidated by Mitzi and co-workers for transistor and light-emitting diode applications. The general formula of organic–inorganic halide perovskites is ABX3, where A is aliphatic or aromatic ammonium, B is a divalent metal cation (such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Cr2+, Pd2+, Cd2+, Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Eu2+ or Yb2+) and X is I−, Br− or Cl−. Recently investigated halide perovskites mostly involved Cs+, CH3NH3+ or NH2CHNH2+ as A, and Pb2+ or Sn2+ as B, with their structures shown in Fig. 1. The [BX6]4− octahedron is connected with six neighbors of X.

The first perovskite-sensitized solar cells (CH3NH3PbBr3 with I−/I3− electrolyte, PCE 2.19%) were reported by Miyaska and co-workers in 2006. Later CH3NH3PbI3 with I−/I3− electrolyte, and CH3NH3PbBr3 or CH3NH3PbI3 with carbon black–polypyrrole composite were reported by this group with a PCE of 1.73% and 0.21% or 0.37%, respectively. However, in the first peer-reviewed report, CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 (accompanied by Br−/Br3− or I−/I3− electrolyte) achieved a PCE of 3.13% and 3.81%, respectively. A high photovoltage of 1.0 V was realized using a CH3NH3PbBr3 sensitizer. Due to the solvation of perovskites in acetonitrile, the photocurrent decayed under continuous irradiation. To alleviate this, a nonpolar solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) was adopted. Perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 quantum dots with ca. 2.5 nm diameter were applied. The better PCE performance of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (6.2%) than N719 dye (3.89%) was attributed to the high absorption coefficient of perovskite. It was also noted that there was nearly 80% degradation of PCE within 10 minutes under continuous irradiation.
The solvation problem in liquid electrolytes was solved by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid hole transporting materials (HTM) using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Sufficient hole transfer was achieved as evidenced by a strong emission quenching of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 at 700 nm. Also, a broad absorption peak at 1340 nm confirmed that the holes were extracted to spiro-OMeTAD in the photon-induced absorption (PIA) spectra. For comparison with TiO2, the Al2O3 substrate was applied for the transient absorption study of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. A remarkable 9.7% PCE was achieved with photocurrents (JSC) exceeding 17 mA cm−2 with an open circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 0.888 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.62 and a long-term stability of over 500 h. Unexpectedly, the improved PCE involved mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) which functions only as a scaffold. The higher PCE (10.9%) than that of mesoporous titanium TiO2 (7.8%) was explained by faster electron diffusion through perovskite. Furthermore, the VOC was higher than 1.1 V in the perovskite CH3NH3PbI2Cl case. Meanwhile, an interesting discovery is that perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 can also act as a hole conductor raising the question of whether a HTM-free mesoscopic cell is a sensitized or a heterojunction solar cell. The PCE of this cell reached 5.5% under standard AM 1.5 1000W m−2 solar light and increased to 7.3% at 100W m−2 light intensity. The structural progress of hybrid perovskite solar cells is summarized in Fig. 2.
This subsequently triggered intensive research on hybrid perovskite solar cells. Among them, milestone PCEs were achieved via a sequential deposition method (15.0%) and a dual-source evaporation deposition method (15.4%). In the sequential deposition method, PbI2 crystals were formed at the surface of TiO2 and then they were converted to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite after dipping in CH3NH3I solution while in the dual-source evaporation method CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx perovskite was formed immediately. Chlorine doping and uniform film formation helped to enhance PCE in the dual-source evaporation case. The PCEs of 15.6% and 15.9% were then achieved by adding graphene and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) to a compact TiO2 layer to reduce its series resistance. Higher PCEs of 16.2% (ref. 23 and 24) and 16.7% (ref. 25) were realized by adjusting the energy level position of HTMs (poly-triarylamine (PTAA) and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively). The highest PCE of 19.3% was achieved by optimizing both series resistance and band positions.

For CH3NH3I synthesis, hydroiodic acid and equimolar methylamine were reacted at 0 °C (in an ice bath) for 2 h. Then, the solution was evaporated at 50 °C for 1 h to precipitate CH3NH3I. The white colored powder product (CH3NH3I) was then washed with diethyl ether with stirring for 30 min three times, and finally dried at 60 °C for 24 hours. Then CH3NH3I and PbI2 or PbCl2, in a molar ratio of 1:1 or 3:1, were dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (GBL) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a perovskite precursor, and then spin coated onto the substrates by a one-step method. Then the substrate was heated at 100 °C for 15 or 45 min for crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite. The effects of perovskite thermal stability, pore filling fraction, coverage and annealing temperature were investigated based on the one-step method and the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx on compact TiO2 (c-TiO2), mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) and mesoporous Al2O3 (m-Al2O3) achieved PCEs of 11.4%, 11.66% and 12.3%, respectively. Interestingly, when a rapid thermal annealing at 130 °C was applied, the PCE of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite cell on compact TiO2 reached 13.5%, due to the formation of micron-sized perovskite grains. Moreover, annealing at 90 °C for 30 min and then at 100 °C for 2 min instead of just at 100 °C for 5 min allowed the formation of a thicker perovskite film along with more coverage on substrates based on PEDOT:PSS. Dispersing Al2O3 nanoparticles in isopropanol reduced the processing temperature to 150 °C, and then further to 110 °C by depositing perovskite precursor solution together with Al2O3 nanoparticles. It should be noted that although Al2O3 nanoparticles do not transfer the electrons to the anode, they affected the crystallization procedure and in turn optoelectronic properties of perovskite. To improve the solubility of chlorine and the uniformity of the perovskite crystal layer, CH3NH3Cl (ref. 35) or 1,8-diiodooctane (ref. 36) or NH4Cl (ref. 37) can be added, achieving a PCE of 12%, 11.8%, and 9.93%, respectively. Moreover, a higher PCE was obtained when a mixture of DMF and GBL (97:3 in volume) was applied, compared with using GBL and DMF alone. Owing to the better perovskite solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 60 wt% precursor solution and a high spin rate were applied to obtain a reproducible, high PCE of c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI2Cl cells. As an intermediate phase (CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO) was found when a mixture solvent of GBL and DMSO (7:3 in volume) was applied, the DMSO competed with CH3NH3I to retard the crystallization of perovskite. After adding toluene to the solution dropwise to remove the excess DMSO, a uniform intermediate layer on m-TiO2 was formed and at last a certified PCE of 16.2% without hysteresis was achieved. Similarly, immediately after spin-coating a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor DMF solution, chlorobenzene was deposited to induce crystallization. A uniform CH3NH3PbI3 layer was formed and this fast deposition–crystallization yielded an average PCE of 13.9 ± 0.7% on the c-TiO2 substrate. Using benzene, xylene and toluene instead of chlorobenzene might also achieve similar results.

To better control the uniformity of perovskite precipitation, a sequential deposition method was developed. The PbI2 solution was spin coated on the substrates and kept at 70 °C. After drying, the substrates were dipped in 2-propanol with dissolved CH3NH3I to form CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals. The optimized PbI2 spin velocity, dipping time, perovskite annealing temperature and CH3NH3I concentration were determined to be 2000 rpm, 20 s, 170 °C and 0.09 M, respectively. Using a mixture solvent of CH3NH3Cl and CH3NH3I in the second step resulted in the formation of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite and a best PCE of 14.8% was achieved for planar TiO2 structure cells, while using a mixture of PbI2 and PbCl2 as a precursor resulted in a PCE of 11.7%. Increasing the temperature to 50 °C during the dipping process with controlled pre-wetting time led to a much rougher perovskite overlayer. This rough structure scattered light and improved the PCE of devices. The dipping temperature for the substrate based on NiO was set as 70 °C to speed up CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization. The better performance that resulted from higher dipping temperature might be due to a preferential orientation of perovskite at the c axis parallel to the substrate. When PbI2 was dissolved in DMSO instead of DMF, PbI2 formed an amorphous feature instead of a crystal structure after deposition. This resulted in a maximal PCE of 13.5% and a reproducible average PCE of 12.5% on the c-TiO2 substrate. Similarly, in the interdiffusion method, a solvent of PbI2 in DMF was first spun to the substrate followed by spinning a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol. Because PbI2 has low solubility in 2-propanol, the spin coating procedure of CH3NH3I would not wash off PbI2, allowing an interdiffusion process. The spinning deposition of the PbI2 step in the sequential deposition method could be repeated to obtain a relatively thick and smooth film and this approach was named the modified two-step deposition method. In addition, hot air flow during spin coating could also be applied to form a perovskite overlayer. Rapid cooling after heat treatment of perovskite achieved a 99.55 ± 0.24% surface coverage.
Large scale production and high reproducibility are the key factors for industrialization, for which the vapour deposition method paves the way. In the dual-source evaporation method, CH3NH3I and PbCl2 are heated to about 120 °C and 325 °C, respectively, and then deposited simultaneously onto the c-TiO2 coated FTO glasses under high vacuum. This method resulted in improved uniformity of the perovskite film compared with solution-processed ones. Moreover, the PbI2 and CH3NH3I could be sequentially vapour deposited directly on ITO glass, followed by a layer of C60. This simple cell structure even showed a PCE of 5.4%. The vacuum deposition for all the layers of the perovskite cells was also performed. In the vapour-assisted solution process method, the c-TiO2/FTO substrates were first spin coated with PbI2 in DMF, followed by annealing in CH3NH3I vapour in a N2 atmosphere. This method avoided the need for high temperature and vacuum and achieved a PCE of 12.1% for CH3NH3PbI3/c-TiO2 planar cells. Then the aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition method was proved for the CH3NH3PbBr3 film on glass substrates. In addition to different morphologies of perovskite, free standing CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles were synthesized, while the crystal formation stages of CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles were revealed. Nano-platelet perovskites were synthesized, among which CH3NH3PbI3 platelets showed ∼200 nm diffusion length (compared with 100 nm of bulk CH3NH3PbI3) under photoluminescence decay measurements. The semitransparent perovskite solar cell with a grey color, which took advantage of the interval space of microstructure perovskite, exhibited a PCE of 3.5% at ∼30% average visible transparency (AVT) and proved to be promising for application in windows and vehicles. Furthermore, 6.4% PCE at 29% AVT was achieved with a structure of FTO/PETDOT:PSS/polyTPD/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Au/LiF, each in a continuous but thin layer, while a fiber-shaped perovskite cell based on stainless steel fiber around which were woven carbon nanotube sheets exhibited a PCE of 3.3% and could be further woven for electronic textiles.

To build models for calculation, the crystal structures should be clarified. There are three perovskite phases (α, β and γ phase) and a non-perovskite δ phase for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and the perovskite phase transits at the solid state while an α–δ phase transition occurs in solvents. The high temperature α phase CH3NH3PbI3 is a cubic phase with space group Pm3m and changes to the β phase which is a tetragonal phase with space group I4/mcm at 327.4 K, then to the γ phase (orthorhombic, Pna21) at 162.2 K. In fact, the tetragonal phase can be treated as a pseudocubic phase by converting a* = a/√2, c* = c/2, ESI in ref. 14. The three structures were shown in the ESI of ref. 67. Detailed parameters were provided by millimeter-wave spectroscopy for CH3NH3PbX3, (X = Cl, Br, I) and a single crystal study for ABI3 (A = CH3NH3 or NH2CHNH2, B = Pb or Sn). One thing that should be noted here is that the CH3NH3 or NH2CHNH2 cation cannot satisfy cubic symmetry, so as a result these cations tend to be disordered by rotational motion in the cubic and tetragonal phases, while fixed in the orthorhombic phase.

The initially calculated energy gaps of CH3NH3PbI3 showed good agreement with experimental results, but this accordance is due to the error cancellation of unaccounted spin–orbit coupling effects with the underestimation of these calculation methods. Because spin–orbit coupling does not significantly affect the lattice parameters, other results such as orientations of organic cations and apical substitution preference of Cl in CH3NH3PbI2Cl are still useful. The preferred substitution of I in the c axis direction with Cl hardly affected the electron structure in the a–b plane, while Br showed no such preference. This result helps to explain the insignificant energy gap change of CH3NH3PbI3 after Cl doping. Generally, the conduction band minimum comes mainly from non-bonding 6p-orbitals of lead, while the valence band maximum is from anti-bonding hybridized lead 6s and iodine 5p orbitals, as shown in Fig. 3A. The σ/σ* orbitals of the organic cation are located at least 5 eV below the VBM and 2.5 eV above the CBM, thus CH3NH3+ just functioned as an electrostatic charge compensator. However, the long term bond of the ammonium hydrogen atom with the halide may partially modify the VBM. The size of organic cations affects the structure of inorganic parts, while the enhanced hydrogen bonding between NH2CH3NH2+ cations (compared to CH3NH3+) and inorganic parts further induced the crystal phase transition. The motion of organic cations can also screen excitons, which affects the carrier transportation. The cubic-tetragonal transition moved the CBM and VBM from the R point to the Γ point and the spin–orbit coupling effect split the degenerated conduction band as shown in Fig. 3A. Furthermore, the dispersed CBM and VBM resulted in a reduction of effective electron and hole mass, from 0.32m0 and 0.36m0 to 0.23m0 and 0.29m0 (where m0 is the electron mass), respectively. Such small effective mass of carriers is consistent with the reported effective ambipolar electrical conductivity. The spatial separation of CBMs and VBMs, as shown in Fig. 3B, also favored the ambipolar transfer. Then the effective mass of electrons and holes was further given in different directions. For CH3NH3PbI3, the effective electron mass at the CBM along c axis (0.14m0) is much smaller than in the a–b plane (2.19m0) while for CH3NH3PbI2Cl the mass (2.71m0) is larger than that in plane (0.21 and 0.59m0). The hole mass of CH3NH3PbI2Cl at the VBM, however, is 0.51m0 in the a–b plane while 0.67m0 along the c axis. At this stage, the high optical absorption could be deduced from the above electronic structure: the p state of the CBM introduced a higher density of states and the realized direct band gap transition was a p–p transition. The dielectric functions were calculated for CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I and Br) and CH3NH3PbI2X (X = I and Cl), and the level position of lead 5-d orbitals can be used to determine the VBM position of CH3NH3PbI3. In addition, the large static dielectric constant (>18) strongly screens the charged defects and impurities to increase the diffusion length. The electric dipole of CH3NH3+ also induced the photoferroic effect for this hybrid perovskite, where the carriers diffuse to domain boundaries and then along “ferroelectric highways” to electrodes. CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx tend to grow in the (110)-oriented TiO2 film due to the better lattice match, while a stronger interaction of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with TiO2 was found.
As the ratio of CH3NH3I to Pb sources during the synthesis procedure is tunable, a large number of point defects were created, and their properties directly determined the electron–hole diffusion length of CH3NH3PbI3. Luckily, the formation energies of deep levels were relatively high compared with those of shallow levels, as shown in Fig. 4. Only deep energy levels trapped the free carriers, and this result explained the long diffusion length in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Furthermore, the Schottky defects, such as PbI2 and CH3NH3I vacancies, and the grain boundaries were examined and were found not to form gap states within the band gap. These two results were consistent with the report in which grain boundaries did not act as charge recombination centers. Besides, Cl doping of CH3NH3PbI3 increased the formation energy of deep level defects (iodine interstitial at β-CH3NH3PbI3) and stabilized the perovskite phase, thus helping to improve the performance of ingredients and the whole devices. The electronic band structures were also calculated for CH3NH3PbBr3, CH3NH3SnI3, CH3NH3SnBr3, CH3NH3SnCl3 and NH2CHN2SnI3. The energy gaps of ABX3 (A = Cs and CH3NH3 or; B = Sn and Pb) were summarized with and without considering the effect of spin-coupling and CH3NH3SnBr3 was predicted to have a more suitable energy gap for solar cells. GW many-body or even quasiparticle self-consistent GW corrections were performed for the calculations. Compared with CH3NH3PbX3, less spin-coupling effect was observed for CH3NH3SnX3 and similarly, the CBMs were mainly from Sn p states while the VBMs were dominated by X (I, Br, Cl) p states. The metallic property (high conductivity) of CH3NH3SnI3 was attributed to Sn4+ p-type doping during crystal growth. In addition to electronic properties, mechanic properties of perovskite were also determined by first principles calculations. The elastic constants of perovskite showed a strong anisotropy, but were suitable for flexible substrates.

The band gap and valence band position of hybrid perovskite were determined by the extrapolation of the linear part of Kubelka–Munk transformed diffuse reflectance spectra and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra, respectively. Then the photoluminescence (PL) decay was applied to determine the life time of carriers after excitation. First, the emissions of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (as shown in Fig. 5A) and CH3NH3PbI3 peaked at 770 nm (1.61 eV) and 780 nm (1.59 eV) which were far above their band gap energies of 1.55 eV (ref. 16) and 1.5 eV (ref. 15), respectively. However, the energy gap estimated from the transient absorption spectrum was 1.61 eV for CH3NH3PbI3. This discrepancy between the transient absorption spectra and diffuse reflectance spectra was explained by the band tail state i.e. Urbach tail. The exponential Urbach tail suggested the absence of deep states and well-ordered microstructure, which results in the high VOC. Furthermore, the emission spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx were found to be independent of excitation energy and exhibited homogeneous spectral broadening over different delay times after excitation due to coupling of the photon to the emission. The phonon modes were elucidated by the Raman spectrum study. The photobleaching at 480 nm (PB1) and 760 nm (PB2), as shown in Fig. 5B, also occurred for CH3NH3PbI3, while the decay rate of PB1 did not change when a hole quencher layer was added. This was explained by the fact that the PB1 resulted from the transitions of the lower valence band to the conduction band when pumped by 600 nm light. This two valence band model with an additional hole transfer process was further applied to CH3NH3PbI3 on NiO films. In Fig. 5C, a much longer carrier life time of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (272.7 ns) than the 9.6 ns of CH3NH3PbI3 was presented, which in turn explained the over 1 μm electron–hole diffusion length in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite and 100 nm in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. However, the exciton binding energies were reported to be 20 meV (ref. 103), 37 meV (ref. 104) and 45 meV (ref. 105) for CH3NH3PbI3 (the thermal energy at 297 K was 25.6 meV), which meant that free carriers and excitons coexisted. The overall charge carrier diffusion length was determined to be over 5 μm for CH3NH3PbI3. The exciton binding energy was estimated to be 55 ± 20 meV for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and free charges dominated the excitation state when the state density was smaller than 1015 cm−3. Indeed, transient PL and TA spectra showed that free charge carriers were formed within 1 ps after excitation then underwent bi-molecular (two-order) recombination. This was in accordance with ultrafast THz spectroscopy results, which decomposed the recombination order number and it was found that the bi-molecular recombination rate of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was one order of magnitude lower than CH3NH3PbI3. The recombination order was also determined via open circuit voltage decay. The carrier mobilities of vapour-deposited CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3 (ref. 111) were determined to be higher than 33 cm2 V−1 S−1, 11.6 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 8 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. As the electrons transferred within perovskite itself, one question that arose is whether electrons transferred through TiO2 in devices. As shown in Fig. 5D, both perovskite carriers' life time and luminescence intensity were quenched in the presence of the TiO2 layer. Thus, the electrons were injected into TiO2 within 1 ps as determined by THz photoconductivity, and within 3 ps by transient 1.4 μm absorption and transient microwave photoconductance. Two components (fast and slow) of the transient photovoltage decay rate suggested complementary paths i.e. via TiO2 or perovskite for electron transport. The increased decay rate of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx on Al2O3 as shown in Fig. 5D was attributed to the interfacial reaction. Since the ordered perovskite layer might be formed close to the oxide surface, the oriented dipoles introduced the Stark effect during electroabsorption spectroscopy experiments.

Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) provided a more direct way to reveal the carrier diffusion length of perovskite, as depicted in Fig. 6. The EBIC line shown in Fig. 6B is indicative of the p–i–n characteristics of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite solar cell and the higher peak on the p-type side indicated a longer electron diffusion length (∼1.9 μm) than the hole diffusion length (∼1.2 μm). The left shoulder of the EBIC profile in Fig. 6C also shows that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite device is of p–i–n type and the diffusion length for holes is longer than the diffusion length for electrons with the former being at least 1 μm. The relatively short electron diffusion length may result from the smaller grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. However, the mobility of electrons is about 2 times higher than the mobility of holes for perovskite without HTM, as revealed by THz photoconductivity spectra. In addition, the photovoltage was mainly generated from the electronic transfer material (ETM)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface and this was in accordance with the longer electron diffusion length than the hole diffusion length, as determined by EBIC. With regard to morphology, analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the HTM infiltrated only 100 nm of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. High-resolution TEM images of perovskite were also presented.
The best annealing temperature for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, on compact TiO2 was 100 °C, while solid crystalline precursor phase transformation at 80 °C was revealed by X-ray diffusion (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Further results showed that all ions were dissociated during the reaction of PbX2 with CH3NH3I, thus Pb(NO3)2 also worked for the sequential deposition method. Pair distribution function analysis of X-ray scattering revealed that 70 atom% of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in mesoporous TiO2 was in local structure with only about 1.4 nm range. Over 5 weeks evolution, the XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3 were presented, showing the enhanced crystallinity and different main peaks. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy found that the CH3NH3 molecules exhibit a long-range alignment for the one step deposition method while no alignment for the sequential deposition method. The valence band position and element composition (C:N:Pb:I:Cl = 1:1:1:2:1, element Pb(0) was present) were also determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) provided a direct view of the valence band position (2.1 eV lower for TiO2) at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. HAXPS results also showed bandgap states of the perovskite and that the Fermi level of the perovskite increased on the m-Al2O3 scaffold. This n-type doping might result from the high fixed negative charge density of Al2O3, under-coordinated iodine ions, or Pb(0). The increase of the Fermi level filled the bandgap states, which resulted in higher conductivity and superior performance of meso-perovskite, even the carrier mobility was lower, compared with planar perovskite. In addition, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed charge separation via holes being trapped by organic and Pb2+ cations, and electrons by several Pb2+ ions and then formation of a Pb(0) cluster. Derived from conductivity measurements, the dielectric constants of perovskite were found to increase greatly and this might be due to the structural fluctuations. The interaction between phonons and the rotational degree of freedom of CH3NH3+ also showed a temperature dependence and had an effect on charge carrier mobilities and the ultra-low thermal conductivity of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.

Since studies on working cells provided more device parameters, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were conducted. Interestingly, charge accumulation in perovskite was observed, as evidenced by the capacitance increase, which made the hybrid perovskite a new type of sensitizer. The CH3NH2PbI3−xClx thin film and CH3NH2PbI3 nanostructured cells were compared by IS characterization, and the carrier diffusion length was determined to be 1.4 and 1 μm at low voltage, respectively. As the 100 nm diffusion length of the CH3NH2PbI3 film was proved by the PL study, this much longer diffusion length result (1 μm) suggested a beneficial effect of the TiO2 nanostructure. It should be also noted that IS can only provide a symmetrical response for either electrons or holes. Thus, IS studies were performed on incomplete cells without one or both selective contacts, in which the presence of spiro-OMeTAD was found to reduce the series resistance while both selective contacts decreased the recombination rate.Fig. 7 shows an equivalent circuit model of a perovskite solar cell which evolved from liquid and solid-state DSSC models. Factors of the built model were explained in detail and the observation of chemical capacitance of mesoporous TiO2 (mTiO2) provided evidence for charge transport within the mTiO2.

To alleviate the performance degradation of liquid state cells, low iodide concentration electrolytes were employed. However, depletion of I− within TiO2 resulted in the increased electron recombination as revealed by intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies. Applying the same method, solid perovskite cells were compared with DSSCs and coefficient properties of DSSCs and the independence of electron recombination lifetime on TiO2 thickness were found, which suggests that electrons travel mainly through TiO2 and recombination was homogenous across the TiO2 film. Moreover, transient photocurrent/photovoltage decay indicated that the electron diffusion rate in the Al2O3 based perovskite cell was one order of magnitude higher than that of the TiO2 based cell, while the limited electron conduction of TiO2 resulted in similar charge transport times of the cells with different HTMs. The numerical simulation results (from program AMPS-1D) showed that a PCE of 22.7% could be obtained by perovskite cells. The thickness and the defect density of perovskite, the back contact work function, interface trap density and hole mobilities of HTMs were also investigated.
Sensitivity to moisture is another issue affecting both the stability and toxicity of perovskite-based solar cells. Although over 80% of initial efficiency remained after 500 h using the sequential deposition method, the results were very different after encapsulation and exposure to ultra-visible (UV) light. The efficiency dropped rapidly with encapsulation and without a UV filter. This was explained by deep electron-donating sites of TiO2. These states absorb molecular oxygen under normal conditions but release oxygen under UV light illumination. Because of insulation with external oxygen after encapsulation, the injected electrons were trapped by these states. This problem was alleviated in Al2O3-based perovskite solar cells whose PCE remained at 6% throughout 1000 h illumination. Another way to suppress the UV degradation is down-converting UV radiation to visible (i.e. tuning the incident spectra), for example by deposition of a layer of YVO4:Eu3+ nano-phosphor on the front side of the perovskite. Both the stability and PCE of the cells were then improved.

Current–voltage (J–V) curves were conventionally employed for PCE tests, however, when a scan was performed along the curve from short circuit to open circuit, a smaller PCE was found compared with scanning in the opposite direction (i.e. strong hysteresis existed, as shown in Fig. 8). It is therefore important to check the power output with time in future research. High capacitance at a low frequency of perovskite was induced by microscopic polarization and played the main role in this hysteresis. This was in accordance with the calculation results revealing ferroelectric properties of perovskites. Experimental evidence for the proposed ferroelectric theory for perovskites is lacking. Although there is a recent report claimed to demonstrate ferroelectricity, the evidence is lacklustre and may be a result of over-interpretation. The extremely slow photoconductivity response of perovskite indicated that the re-alignments of organic ion may result in a slower response of inorganic parts. The photo-induced halide ion migration may also play a role in device hysteresis. Fortunately, increasing the crystal size of perovskite and applying m-TiO2 structure can alleviate the hysteresis.

The effects of chlorine doping and mesoporous structure on carrier diffusion are still not clear. Nevertheless, little chlorine concentration (below 3–4%) or even no chlorine was found in some CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite. Under dry air conditions, no CH3NH3PbCl3 phase was observed during the one step method of preparing CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite, while the CH3NH3PbCl3 phase was present under 30 ± 5% humidity. Furthermore the presence of humidity improved the performance of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite. However, it was argued that the XRD peaks at 15.7° and 31.5° should not be assigned to the CH3NH3PbCl3 phase, but an intermediate phase. Furthermore, two distinct intermediate phases were observed at high and low iodine content during CH3NH3PbI3−xClx formation. Angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the chloride is preferentially located closely to the perovskite/TiO2 interface. As TEM images indicated the presence of PbCl2 nanoparticles in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution, heterogeneous nucleation may be induced by PbCl2. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy showed that the CH3NH3+ cations were more ordered in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx than CH3NH3PbI3 in the mesoporous substrate. Overall, although long diffusion lengths have been measured in the chlorine perovskite sample, XPS measurements have revealed that there is no Cl in the film suggesting that the role of chlorine is rather in good film formation and not an electronic effect.

If m-Al2O3 worked only as a scaffold in the hybrid perovskite solar cell, other mesoporous insulating materials would also be suitable. Mesoporous ZrO2 is such an example. Detailed information of the devices in Section 4, Section 5 and Section 6 are listed in Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. Although the perovskite solar cell exhibited a higher PCE when it had a thinner m-TiO2 layer with higher perovskite pore filling, the TiO2 nanorod may be more suitable than nanoparticles due to its higher electron mobility in the one-dimensional structure. Rutile TiO2 nanorods of different lengths (0.56, 0.92 and 1.58 μm) were assembled with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, showing PCEs of 9.4%, 7.3% and 5.9%, respectively. The decrease of PCE with nanorod length was attributed to the tilt of long nanorods, which results in a low pore filling fraction. The TiO2 nanowire arrays with 1.5 μm length were also assembled with CH3NH3PbI2Br and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, exhibiting PCEs of 4.87% and 4.29%, respectively. Then, TiO2 nanofiber (120–200 nm in diameter) CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite also showed decreasing PCE (9.82%, 3.32% and 2.49%) with increasing nanofiber film thickness (413 nm, 844 nm and 1.215 μm, respectively) and this decrease was explained by increasing closure of pores with film thickness. The best PCE (6.52%) for TiO2 nanotubes was also achieved for the shortest length studied (2.3 μm). For other morphologies, a TiO2 nanosheet was applied for the first HTM free mesoscopic solar cell, while m-TiO2 with controlled pore size (15 nm) was also applied for the CH3NH3Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 solar cell with a PCE of 12.8%. Further optimization of the thickness of the TiO2 nanosheet and perovskite enhanced the PCE to 12.3% with the presence of spiro-OMeTAD. The influence of different sizes of TiO2 nanoparticle on the crystallization of perovskite based on one step and two step deposition methods was directly compared.

Facilitating the electron transfer process paved alternative ways for material modification. Synthesis of a highly compact TiO2 layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD) reduced the pinholes and in turn decreased the charge recombination, while a compact TiO2 layer which was made of TiO2 nanoparticles (diameter < 5 nm) in alcoholic solvent with the addition of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TiAcAc) facilitated electron transfer by reducing contact resistance. Mixing TiO2 nanoparticles (diameter ∼ 25 nm) with graphene, instead of c-TiO2, not only reduced the synthesis temperature, but also improved the PCE. The graphene quantum dots were also added between TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and found to enhance the electron injection from perovskite to TiO2. Atomic layer deposition of TiO2 (ALD-TiO2) was used to passivate the surface defects of mesoporous TiO2 and the optimal thickness of ALD-TiO2 was found to be 2 nm. When monolayer HOCO–R–NH3+I− (R: (CH2)n, n = 1, 2, 3) was applied as anchors for perovskite, not only the surface trap state of m-TiO2 was passivated, but also the growth of perovskite on the mesoporous structure was more uniform and electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 was promoted. Promotion of electron injection was also observed after m-TiO2 was passivated with Y2O3, while Al2O3 passivation did not show considerable improvement. The surface blocking layer might not only functioned as a passivator, but also as an electron–hole generator, as in the case of Sb2S3 with a HTM of CuSCN. Moreover, the stability of the perovskite was also improved and this might be due to the prohibition of TiO2 photocatalysis.
Tuning the crystal and electronic structure of TiO2 is another strategy for modification. Rutile TiO2 with 5–10 nm diameter was grown on FTO-glass as a hole blocking layer via hydrolysis of TiCl4 at 70 °C and performed even better than the anatase film via a high temperature process. (For a low temperature process, anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (∼5 nm) were used for the planar device.) However, for rutile mesoporous TiO2, though more electrons were injected from perovskite, a lower electron transfer rate resulted in no improvement in the PCE. Y3+ substitution in TiO2 (Y-TiO2) did not influence the conduction band position of TiO2 significantly, while Mg doping increased the TiO2 band gap from 3.29 eV to 3.38 eV. Thus the PCE improvement compared to pure TiO2 samples was due to the increased photocurrent or photovoltage, for Y3+ substitution or Mg doping, respectively. Al doping of TiO2 not only passivated the electronic trap sites, which is beneficial for the stability of encapsulated cells, but the enhanced conductivity also resulted in a higher PCE. With humidity control, Y3+ substitution of TiO2 and optimization of the ITO work function (by spin-coating poly ethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) on ITO), all together a PCE of 19.3% was achieved.

Compared with TiO2 nanorods, ZnO nanorods (50 nm diameter) have an optimal length (800 nm) for perovskite solar cells i.e. the best PCE achieved here needs to strike a balance between light absorption and charge recombination. Then both planar and nanorod (400–500 nm length, 100–150 nm diameter) ZnO structures were applied on rigid (FTO-glass) and flexible substrates (ITO-PET). Compared with flexible cells, the superior PCEs of rigid cells were due to the lower inherent sheet resistance of the substrate. Compared to planar cells, cells with nanorod ZnO structure can absorb more light and the PCE of the devices was superior despite the lower recombination resistance. m-Al2O3 perovskite cells with compact ZnO were also fabricated and compared with the ones on the TiO2 compact layer. Though higher short circuit current was achieved, the lower recombination resistance i.e., a higher recombination rate induced a lower fill factor which in the end resulted in a lower PCE.

However, the charge recombination rate of the ZnO nanorod cell was found to be lower than that of the TiO2 cell with similar nanorod length (1 μm) and diameter (80 nm). The higher electron collection rate of ZnO nanorod cells compared with TiO2 was examined and a PCE of 11.13% was achieved. Better organized nanocolumnar ZnO (nc-ZnO) structure CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells were also fabricated, however, no significant PCE was achieved. A ZnO nanoparticle (5 nm diameter) layer of 25 nm thickness on ITO glass resulted in a PCE as high as 15.7% for perovskite cells and 10.2% on a flexible substrate. The large perovskite crystal size (75 nm) when grown on the ZnO nanoparticle layer might contribute to better PCE via light scattering and better carrier mobility. CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells based on ZnO or Al-doped ZnO, which were synthesized via electrostatic spraying and parameter optimization, resulted in PCEs of 10.8% and 12%, respectively.

First, a fullerene self-assembled monolayer (C60SAM) was applied to functionalize m-TiO2. Interestingly, though electrons could not be injected from C60SAM to TiO2, the PCE was improved after functionalization. C60SAM exhibited better electron extraction and served as an electron reservoir, then facilitated the electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. Next, planar cells were produced, with fullerene (C60) or [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) (among which PCBM performed the best) as the ETM. The structure and mechanism are shown in Fig. 11, in which bathocuproine (BCP) functioned as a hole blocking, while poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) functioned as a surface smoother and leakage current reducer. Applying DMF as solvent, a PCE of 3.9% was achieved for the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM cell. Modification with a DMF:GBL (97:3 vol.%) mixed solvent thereafter resulted in a PCE of 6.16%. A thicker CH3NH3PbI3 layer (110 nm) produced via the sequential deposition method further improved the PCE to 7.41%. With CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite, the PCE of the inverted architecture reached 9.8%, while the PCE reached 11.5% in the absence of TiO2, respectively. The PCE of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx cells increased from 7.5% to 9.1% after storage in a pure N2 atmosphere for 1368 h. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution containing 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) showed enhanced PCE compared to solutions without DIO.Via dual-source vapour deposition, a CH3NH3PbI3 layer of thickness 285 nm was formed between PCBM and the PEDOT:PSS layer and a PCE of 12% was thus obtained. Similarly, poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)–N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine) (polyTPD) acted as an electron blocking layer. With slightly oxidized polyTPD, cells with even a 900 nm thick perovskite layer showed a similar PCE (12%) to 300 nm cells (12.7%), proving the long diffusion length of perovskite. With a PCBM/C60 double layer co-covering perovskite, a PCE of 12.2% was also achieved, even if the perovskite was formed via the solution process. With a mixed solvent (GBL and DMSO) and optimized PCBM thickness (55 nm), the PCE reached 14.1% for the CH3NH3PbI3 cell and 8.7% for a 10 × 10 cm2 module. As mentioned in the Methods section, interdiffusion deposition made the perovskite pin-hole free and in turn a PCE of 15.4% was obtained. Apart from fullerenes, tris(2,4,6-trimethyl-3-(pyridine-3-yl)phenyl)borane (3TPYMB) can also be applied as an organic ETM layer, however it shows inferior performance. And apart from PEDOT:PSS, electrochemically polymerized polythiophene was also applied as the organic HTM substrate.

For flexible substrates, a PCE of 4.54% was achieved when the work functions (equivalent to the energy level positions in Fig. 9B) of ITO were optimized, while applying CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite, PCEs achieved were 6.4% and 9.2% with or without the c-TiO2 layer. Also, a flexible substrate with aluminum doped ZnO (AZO), silver and AZO on PET was used.

As mentioned in the Introduction section, CH3NH3PbI3 was found to conduct holes and cells containing no HTM (HTM free) could thus be produced. The first HTM free cell was fabricated via spin coating CH3NH3PbI3 and thermal evaporation of gold. By spin coating a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution on the TiO2 film twice, a perovskite film was obtained on the top of the TiO2 film. The depletion width of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction was calculated and it was found that half of the TiO2 film and a fifth of the CH3NH3PbI3 film were depleted. By tuning the thickness of the TiO2 layer, the highest PCE was also obtained when the depletion fraction of the TiO2 layer was 0.49, the maximal value studied. The discontinuities of interface valence and conduction bands were calculated to be 1.87 eV and 0.08 eV, respectively. The large valance band discontinuity hinders the holes flowing from the perovskite layer to TiO2 layer.

An ideal model for a single heterojunction solar cell was fitted to the results and this provided further confirmation that the perovskite cells behave more as heterojunction solar cells than as sensitized solar cells. With perovskite deposited via the modified two-step deposition method, all of the cells displayed PCEs of over 9.0% and the average PCE was 9.4%, i.e. high repeatability was obtained. To reduce recombination at the back electrode, an insulating layer of the ultrathin Al2O3 film or N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenyl-benzidine (TPB) was deposited between Au and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite via an atomic layer deposition or spin coating method, respectively, cells with both additional materials showing improved PCEs. Similar Al2O3 deposition also appeared in HTM cells, in which both liquid and solid state perovskite solar cells were post-modified by aluminium triethyl hexane solution. The presence of post-modification Al2O3 reduced the electron recombination at the TiO2/HTM interfaces in both cases and alleviated the degradation of perovskite in liquid electrolytes and moisture, respectively.

With a suitable valence band position, inorganic HTMs can also be used to create hybrid perovskite solar cells. Although CuI exhibited two orders of magnitude higher conductivity than spiro-OMeTAD, a higher recombination rate led to a lower VOC and in turn inferior PCEs. The perovskite solar cell with the HTM of CuSCN performed better when an overlap perovskite was formed. The one step precursor deposition method of CH3NH3PbI3 and Sb2S3 modification of m-TiO2 resulted in a PCE of 5.24% for a CuSCN HTM based cell, while when applying the modified two step deposition method, the PCE reached 12.4%. A planar heterojunction cell based on c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/CuSCN exhibited a PCE of 6.4%. Cells with invert planar structure FTO/CuSCN/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM made via dual source vapour deposition of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx achieved a PCE of 3.8%, while replacing CuSCN with NiO resulted in a PCE of 7.26%.

The first reported PCE of p-type NiO/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with mesoporous structure was 1.5%, while the PCEs were further improved to 7.6% and 7.8% for planar and 9.51% for the mesoporous NiO structure. Applying sol–gel-processed NiO nanocrystals as a compact layer, the PCE was enhanced to 9.11% for planar cells, while applying magnetron sputtered NiOx as a compact layer, a PCE of 11.6% was achieved for mesoporous structure cells. However, liquid state NiO perovskite showed a PCE of only 0.71%. In addition, when an ultra-thin graphene oxide (GO) was applied as the HTM, higher perovskite coverage, compared to the PEDOT:PSS substrate, was obtained with larger crystals along the (110) plane and resulted in a maximal PCE of 12.4%.

The PCEs of perovskite solar cells based on mesoporous TiO2 were measured when assembled with different polymeric hole conductors: poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), poly-[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]] (PCPDTBT), (poly-[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2, 1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl]) (PCDTBT) and poly-triarylamine (PTAA). The resulting PCEs with P3HT, PCPDTBT, PCDTBT, and PTAA were 6.7%, 5.3%, 4.2%, and 9.0%, respectively. Under optimum conditions, a higher PCE (12.0%) with PTAA was achieved, compared to the reference PCE of 8.4% with spiro-OMeTAD. These were due to the higher hole mobility and better energy level alignment of PTAA. 4-(Diethylamino)-benzaldehyde diphenylhydrazone (DEH) was also introduced as the HTM and resulted in a PCE of 1.6%, which was lower compared with 4.5% of P3HT and 8.5% of spiro-OMeTAD. The inferior PCEs with P3HT and DEH resulted from one and two orders of magnitude higher recombination rate compared with spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. However, when poly[2,5-bis(2-decyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,20-bithiophen-5-yl)ethene] (PDPPDBTE) was applied as the HTM, the PCE (9.2%) exceeded those of the spiro-OMeTAD (7.6%) and P3HT (6.3%) cases. This arose from the high hole mobility and conductivity of PDPPDBTE. Furthermore the hydrophobic properties of PDPPDBTE and P3HT enabled better stability under humid conditions, compared with spiro-OMeTAD. For the case of poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis-(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di-hydropyrrolo[3,4]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP) as the HTM, the PCE (5.5%) for the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite cell was between those of spiro-OMeTAD (6.48%) and P3HT (3.0%), while the open circuit voltage achieved was 1.16 V for the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite cell. For polymer PTB-BO, which is composed of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, dichlorobenzene-functionalization was adopted (denoted as PTB-DCB21). Compact contact with perovskite was made via intermolecular interactions, which in turn resulted in faster electron transfer and slower charge recombination, improving the PCE from 7.4% to 8.7%. For polyaniline (PANI), as synthesized on FTO glass, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was formed between the PANI electrode and the TiO2 photoanode by injecting perovskite precursor solution. It was interesting that PANI not only acted as a hole conductor but also as a sensitizer. As the PTAA performed better than spiro-OMeTAD, the PCE of the PTAA/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite cell was improved to 16.2% (with GBL:DMF in a ratio of 7:3 volume as the perovskite solvent), compared with 14.9% PCE of spiro-OMeTAD. A certified PCE of 16.2% was also obtained, using a mixture solvent of GBL and DMSO, as mentioned above.

For cells with a C60SAM modified TiO2 anode, P3HT and PCPDTBT were also applied resulting in PCEs of 6.7% and 6.84%, respectively. Adding multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into P3HT increased the conductivity and the PCE was improved from 4.12% to 6.45%. The PCE of a P3HT based CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite cell was reported to be 9.3%. Applying highly concentrated perovskite precursor solution with DMSO as the solvent further improved the PCE to 10.8%. The PCE of the P3HT cell further reached 12.6% with 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (D-TBP) as an additive instead of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). The PCE of the P3HT device further reached 13.6% with a low temperature processed TiO2 anode. In addition, up-scaling from cell area 0.1 cm2 to 3.36 cm2 to module area 16.8 cm2 was realized for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite cells using P3HT or spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, resulting in the decrease of PCEs from 9.3% to 6.3% to 5.1% for P3HT, and from 8.4% to 5.9% to 5.1% for spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Stability tests showed a significant decrease in the PCE within 72 hours for both modules, explained by photo-chemical degradation of P3HT and partial de-doping of the spiro-OMeTAD.
A combination of ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and inverse photoemission spectroscopy allowed determination of the interfacial energy level between spiro-OMeTAD and lead organic–inorganic perovskite, as summarized in Fig. 10. It was noted that optimizing the energy level match of spiro-OMeTAD would improve the VOC and PCE. Then tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide)] (FK209) was used as a hole dopant and to improve the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. The PCE was improved from 5.0% (pristine spiro-OMeTAD) to 8.1% (spiro-OMeTAD:FK209) to 9.7% (spiro-OMeTAD:FK209+Li,TBP) and the best PCE, 10.4%, was reached after FK209 concentration optimization. The tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidine]cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide] (MY11), which possesses a deeper redox potential compared to tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(II) bis(hexafluorophosphate) (FK102), was also applied as a hole dopant. A PCE of 11.9% was obtained with MY11, compared to 11.0% with FK102. Compared to the cobalt additive, the iridium complex IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)[TFSI] showed comparable performance (10.8%) but better stability.N-Butyl-N′-(4-pyridylheptyl)imidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (BuPyIm-TFSI) increased both hole concentration and conductivity of HTM since it can release free protons and thus improved the PCE of perovskite cells. Spiro-OMeTAD can also be per-oxidized to 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro bifluorene di[bis-(trifluoro methanesulfonyl)imide] (spiro(TFSI)2), so it can function without oxidization of ambient air. The spiro-OMeTAD was modified via substituting two methoxy groups at the ortho (o) and meta (m) position instead of the para (p) position, (po- and pm-, instead of pp-spiro-OMeTAD). The lower resistance of po-spiro-OMeTAD improved the FF of the cell while the higher LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) blocked more electrons from flowing into the metal electrode and a PCE of 16.7% was obtained. Without special notes, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were added into spiro-OMeTAD in all perovskite cells.
For a small molecular HTM, based on a diphenyl (DP) unit and a triphenylamine (TPA) unit linked with olefinic bonds, 2TPA–2-DP was synthesized and applied as a HTM and a PCE of 9.1% was obtained (10.2% with spiro-OMeTAD). The PCEs achieved with HTMs (compared with spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions) of oligothiophenes containing a backbone structure of benzodithiophene (DR3TBDTT), 2,2′,5,5′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-3,30-bithiophene (KTM3), the tetrathiafulvalene derivative (TTF-1), 4-(4-phenyl-4-αnaphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-bis(4-benzyl)-aniline (PNBA), 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-tolyl)-phenylamine (denoted as HTM1) and 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl)-N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-phenylamine (denoted as HTM2), 1,3,6,8-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)pyrene (Py-C), 2,4,6-tris[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino-N-phenylthiophen-2-yl]-1,3,5-triazine(triazine-Th-OMeTPA), tris[[4-[3,3′-dihexylsiylene-2,2′-bithiophene]-7-[5′′-n-hexyl-(2,2′;5′,2′′-terthiophene)-5-yl]-benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole]-2,6,10-trimethylstannyl]-4,4,8,8,12,12-hexamethyl-4H,8H,12H-benzo[1,9]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine (Fused-F) and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (H101) were 8.8% (8.9%), 11.0% (11.4%), 11.03% (11.4%), 11.4%(13.0%), 11.34% and 11.63% (12.08%), 12.4% (12.7%), 12.51% (13.45%), 12.8% (11.7%) and 13.2% (13.7%), respectively. Among these small molecular HTMs, DR3TBDTT, TTF-1, PNBA and Fused-F were employed without any additives, while Fused-F was found to contribute to photocurrents.

Lastly, the under-coordinated halide ions of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx can be passivated by iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) and an improved fill factor (FF) resulted from the inhibition of recombination. The decrease of charge concentration under short circuit after passivation explains the unexpected charge accumulation in perovskite solar cells. TBP was found to corrode the perovskite, so montmorillonite (MMT) was applied between the perovskite and the HTM layers to alleviate TBP corrosion and reduce recombination at the interface. As a result the PCE was improved from 9.0% to 11.9% after adding MMT. Replacing the top contact of Ag with MoOx/Al, the PCE of the planar perovskite cell reached 11.42%, compared to 12.36% PCE with Ag. As showing better performance compared with flaky graphite, spheroidal graphite (via the full printable method) was applied as a counter electrode in a monolithic perovskite cell (6.64% PCE). Mixing highly ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with flaky graphite as a counter electrode resulted in a PCE of 7.02%. With the sequential deposition method, the PCEs reached 10.64% based on a substrate coated with TiO2 nanosheets and 12.9% by mixing formamidimium and methylammonium cations for perovskite synthesis. Furthermore, in the same graphite cell structure, 5-ammoniumvaleric acid (5-AVA) iodide functioned as a temperate for perovskite crystal nucleation and growth and resulted in a PCE of 12.84% for the (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 cell. Applying a semitransparent carbon nanotube (CNT) laminating layer as a counter electrode, a cell presented a PCE of 6.29% illuminated from the FTO side and 3.88% from the CNT side. The best CNT cells presented PCEs of 9.90% and 6.87% with or without spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Devices with different HTMs and detailed parameters are summarized in Table S2.


Before introducing the modification to perovskite, CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite was added into the liquid state Ru complex [Z907] or an alkoxysilylcoumarin [SFD-5] sensitized solar cell as a co-sensitizer and some improvement in PCE was achieved. A solar cell co-sensitized with CH3NH3PbI3 and PbS quantum dots (QDs) also presented an improved PCE (3.6%) compared to the CH3NH3PbI3 cell (3.04%). When core–shell Au@SiO2 nanoparticles were inserted into the perovskite layer, the exciton binding energy of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was reduced from 100 meV to 35 meV with resulting PCE enhancement from 10.7% to 11.4%. In addition, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solution was used as an electrolyte in N719 DSSCs and more octahedral [PbX6]4− ions were observed to connect with each other when the perovskite concentration was increased. The perovskites can be also applied as the capping ligands for PbS QDs and other colloidal nanocrystals.

Replacing I ions with Br blue shifted the band gap of the perovskite solar cell and a high open circuit voltage was achieved, which has special applications for driving electrochemical reactions or systems with spectral splitting such as tandem cells. The VOC of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite solar cells increased from 1.16 to 1.3 V, when PCBTDPP was replaced with N,N′-dialkyl perylenediimide (PDI) as the HTM. For CH3NH3PbBr3 cells with HTMs of P3HT, PCBM and N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine (TPD), the achieved VOCs were 0.84 V, 1.06 V and 1.20 V, respectively, while the corresponding PCEs were 0.52%, 0.72% and 0.67%, respectively. By optimizing HOMO levels of the triarylamine polymer with indenofluorene (denoted as PIF8-TAA) as the HTM, the CH3NH3PbBr3 cell exhibited a VOC of 1.4 V and a PCE of 6.7%. A cell of CH3NH3PbI2Br grown on the TiO2 nanowire anode exhibited a PCE of 4.87%. Without HTM or with a HTM of PTAA, CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx cells achieved PCEs of 8.54% and 12.3%, respectively, both showing better stability than CH3NH3PbI3.
The VOC was further enhanced to 1.5 V for the CH3NH3PbBr3−xClx cell with the HTM of 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP). For a systematic study of halogen doping, CH3NH3Pb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly cells were also synthesized. It was found that introducing Cl notably increased the cell performance while the recombination rates were lower for m-Al2O3 devices than m-TiO2 devices. Such improvements were also confirmed by PL decay spectra. The research on fluoride hybrid perovskite cells is still underway and there has been a report on CH3NH3PbI(3−x) (BF4)x perovskite, which shows an improved photoresponse compared with CH3NH3PbI3.

The band gaps of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx perovskite were reported to be 1.5 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. However, the optimal band gap for solar cells with single band adsorption lines is between 1.1 and 1.4 eV. Though organic cations did not contribute to the energy gap, their size was able to tune the electronic properties of the inorganic components. However, the size of ethylammonium (CH3CH2NH3+) overwhelmed the tolerance factor of the perovskite ABX3 tetragonal lattice as the (PbI6) octahedra formed infinite chains along the b axis while the chains were separated along the c axis. Instead of red shifting the band gap, a 2.2 V band gap resulted. For cesium (Cs) doped methylammonium lead iodide (CsxMA1−xPbI3) perovskite, the band gap increased from 1.52 eV to 2.05 eV with Cs content (x) increasing from 0 to 1 and the PCE was improved after doping 10% Cs. Moreover, solution processed CsSnI3 solar cells were achieved using DMSO as solvent.

Then, the slightly larger formamidinium (NH2CHNH2+) cation was introduced as a substitute for the CH3NH3+ cation. The band gap of the formed NH2CHNH2PbI3 perovskite was measured to be 1.43 eV (ref. 259), 1.47 eV (ref. 260) or 1.48 eV (ref. 14), this deviation being due to the smaller size of in situ dipping method produced NH2CHNH2PbI3. The two polymorphs, i.e. black type with trigonal symmetry and the yellow type with the hexagonal nonperovskite counterpart, were examined.In situ dipping of PbI2 in HC(NH2)2I solution to avoid reaction temperature decrease improved the PCE via the one step method from 3.7% to 7.5%. By adding hydroiodic acid (HI) into the precursor solution, uniform pinhole-free perovskite films were formed on the compact TiO2 layer and in turn resulted in a PCE of 14.2%. Mixed-organic-cation perovskite (CH3NH3)0.6(NH2CHNH2)0.4PbI3 cells (14.9%PCE) performed better than both unmixed cells. Using higher purity HC(NH2)2I and adding a thin layer of CH3NH3PbI3, the PCE of the (NH2CHNH2)PbI3 perovskite cell reached 16.01%. In addition, it is interesting that the (NH2CHNH2)PbBr3 perovskite possessed a PL lifetime as high as 200 ns and the PCE achieved was 6.5% based on the planar structure.

To replace Pb with a less toxic metal and also to narrow the band gap, the Sn element of the same group (14) was adopted. The energy level positions of CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite are presented in Fig. 11 and P3HT was applied to fit with the valence band position of CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3. It was supposed that the band level decreased linearly as Sn content increased. However, in a later report, the band gap dropped from 1.55 eV for CH3NH3PbI3 to 1.17 eV for CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3 (x = 0.5, 075), then increased to 1.30 eV for CH3NH3SnI3, while similarly the valence band dropped from −5.45 eV for CH3NH3PbI3 to −5.77 eV for CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3 (x = 075), then increased to −5.47 eV for CH3NH3SnI3. Furthermore, no photovoltaic output was reported for CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite cells in ref. 264, while a PCE of 5.44% for the CH3NH3SnI3 cell was achieved (structures and performance of the cells are presented in Table S3). This difference might have resulted from the easy oxidation of Sn2+, in turn inducing self-doping of perovskite, during the fabrication process of the cells. For lead free i.e. CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite cells, the PCE was further improved from 5.23% to 5.73% after partly substituting I with Br. The PCE of the CH3NH3SnI3cell has been improved to 6.4%. The PL decay lifetime and charge diffusion length were also measured to be ∼200 ps and 30 nm, respectively. If the background doping level of CH3NH3SnI3 was controlled to be ∼1015 cm−3, the diffusion length would increase to 1 μm.


The recent progress in organic–inorganic halide solar cells has been remarkable. New reports on the working mechanisms, device structures, preparation methods and materials applied continue to emerge. Excellent reviews have also been written. As discussed here, with regard to mechanisms, first principles calculation served as a powerful tool to predict the material properties, where the good fit of calculation results with experiments indicates that the developed models could be further applied for electronic parameters of perovskite with other components. Then, the optical and electronic study is able to reveal key factors (such as charge diffusion length and density) of charge transfer and recombination within the perovskite and interfaces to determine the device efficiency. Finally, the study of solar cell performance as a device allows for better evaluation of the properties of solar cells. However, there remain some open questions in this field.

Firstly for materials, the toxicity of lead and easy oxidization of Sn2+ are problematic: though compared with the amount of lead in lead acid batteries, much less lead is estimated to be required to produce 1000 GW per year from CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, materials such as functional polymers are needed to remove the escaping lead. Replacing lead with tin may present a promising way out, but unfortunately Sn2+ suffers from easy oxidation. Therefore it is necessary to investigate other alternative metal ions. Secondly, with regard to the band gap modification of perovskite: different organic cations and halogen anions can be applied to optimize the band gap of perovskite to match the solar spectrum. Thirdly, regarding the ETMs and HTMs chosen, the band level of ETMs and HTMs should comply with the valence and conduction band energy levels, respectively. It is also necessary to take the price and efficiency of these materials into account. Next, the stability of the perovskite remains an issue: the negative standard Gibbs free energy for iodide perovskite degradation with moisture indicated the sensitiveness of perovskite to water. Except for the water needed to dissolve the HI and CH3NH2 byproducts, a single water molecular is enough to degrade the perovskite. The water content of starting materials should also be taken into account. Thus, the sealing of the perovskite and waterproofing of other materials are necessary. As TiO2 also shows photocatalytic characteristics, modification of the interface layer might be required. Last but not least, scalable manufacturing techniques: if the water sensitivity issue could be solved, scalable production of perovskite could be performed under ambient conditions. Control of the uniformity of the film would be the most important factor.
