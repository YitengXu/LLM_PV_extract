As an n-type inorganic semiconductor, ZnO has been widely used in organic solar cells (OSCs) and hybrid solar cells (HSCs) due to its salient characteristics such as low cost, easy synthesis, non-toxicity, high stability, and good optoelectronic properties. This article reviews the applications of ZnO in solar cells, including ZnO/organic HSCs, and OSCs with ZnO acting as electrode buffer layers or transparent electrodes. For ZnO/organic HSCs, ZnO serves as the electron acceptor material, while organic semiconductors act as electron donor materials. For the buffer layers or electrode applications, ZnO is used as an electron collection and hole blocking material where its structure plays an important role in the determination of the device performance (e.g., power conversion efficiency, lifetime, stability, etc.). Special emphasis goes to the device performance of OSCs and HSCs, which depends not only on the active materials and the device configurations, but also on the structural characteristics of the ZnO buffer layer. Finally, we briefly give an analysis on the opportunities and challenges for this promising semiconductor in OSCs and HSCs.

The rapidly increasing demand for energy together with more and more concerns about the environment force us to seek sustainable energy resources and clean energy technologies. As a result, photovoltaics have received increased interest in recent years. In order to further lower the cost of solar cells, organic solar cells based on fully organic semiconductors and hybrid solar cells based on a combination of organic and inorganic semiconductors have been intensively investigated as promising approaches to low-cost photovoltaics. Zinc oxide (ZnO) has received exceptional attention as a promising material for solar cell applications due to its non-toxicity, good stability, good electrical and optical properties, and low cost. This article reviews the research and performance parameters of organic and hybrid solar cells where ZnO acts as an electron acceptor material, an electrode buffer layer or a transparent electrode. The limitations of these devices and an outlook for each system are also discussed.


The world's energy consumption is reaching 16 terawatts and is predicted to triple by 2050. The research and development of solar cells has been driven by this quickly increasing energy consumption and further accelerated by increasing concerns about carbon emission from fossil fuel-based energy sources. As a result, photovoltaics have seen more interest in technological development in recent years. Although silicon p–n junction solar cells have been the most used solar cell system because of their advantages in high efficiency and reliability, the high cost of silicon solar cells has limited their applications. Besides conventional solar cells based on silicon, organic and hybrid solar cells have been intensively investigated in the past decade. Compared to conventional solar cells, organic and hybrid solar cells have many advantages, such as light weight, flexibility and potential low cost due to their compatibility with versatile solution processing methods.

Organic-inorganic HSCs, which use a combination of organic and inorganic semiconductors, have been widely studied as an alternative to fully OSCs. This type of solar cell has been demonstrated by combining organic semiconductors and different inorganic semiconductors together as the active layer of devices. In most cases, a p-type organic semiconductor serves as both light harvester and electron donor, and the n-type inorganic semiconductor serves as electron acceptor. HSCs based on this device structure have a few interesting advantages compared to OSCs. For example, the inorganic phase of HSCs usually has higher electron mobility than that of available n-type organic semiconductors. Additionally, inorganic semiconductors usually have higher physical and chemical stability compared to that of organic semiconductors, especially the low-stability n-type organic semiconductors. The choice of inorganic semiconductors starts with CdSe and extends to TiO2 and ZnO. Among these inorganic semiconductors, ZnO has attracted a lot of attention for being used in HSCs because ZnO is less toxic than many other II–VI semiconductors and is relatively easy to synthesize in large quantities with low cost techniques. As an n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap, ZnO also has very good optical transmittance, which makes ZnO an excellent candidate as an efficient cathode buffer layer (CBL) or a transparent electrode in OSCs and HSCs.
In this review, we will cover the development of solar cells containing both ZnO and organic semiconductors, with the focus on the research and performance parameters of solid-state devices where ZnO acts as an electron acceptor material or electrode buffer layer and transparent electrode. Dye sensitized solar cells are not in the scope of this review, since other good reviews have been published on this topic.

In HSCs, ZnO is widely used to replace the electron acceptor organic semiconductors of OSCs. In this section, we will summarize the studies on ZnO/organic semiconductor HSCs, where ZnO acts as an electron acceptor and the organic semiconductors act as the electron donor materials.

The general principle of operation of ZnO/organic semiconductor HSCs is similar to that of OSCs. In the first step, incident photons with energies higher than the band gap of the organic semiconductor are absorbed by that organic semiconductor and produce excitons, which are bound electron–hole pairs. In the second step, those excitons may diffuse during their lifetime within the material to the donor/acceptor interfaces and then dissociate into holes and electrons at that interface. The exciton diffusion lengths usually range from 5 nm to 20 nm in most organic semiconductors, so that the optimum distance of the exciton to the donor/acceptor interface is also in this range. After these charge carriers are separated, they have to be transported to their respective electrodes for the generation of an external current. Then holes transport toward the anode electrode through the donor materials, and electrons transport to the cathode electrodevia the acceptor materials. This step is essentially critical for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) HSCs with randomly dispersed ZnO nanocrystals, because the charge transport is highly dependent on percolating pathways to ensure the charge carriers can arrive at their respective electrodes without recombination due to trapping in dead ends on the isolated ZnO domain. Finally those charge carriers are collected at the respective electrodes.
Performance of solar cells is usually measured and evaluated through current density–voltage characteristics under air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) simulated solar irradiation. Fig. 1 shows typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for solar cells. A set of parameters can be extracted from the J–V characteristic: open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), current density (Jmp) and the voltage (Vmp) at the maximum power point. Based on these parameters, the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of the device can be calculated according to eqn (1), where Pout and Pin are output power and input power, respectively.

As a semiconductor that has been studied for a long time, many nanostructure forms of ZnO have been reported, such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods (NRs), nanobelts, nanocombs, nanosaws, nanosprings, nanocoils and many other structures. The versatility of ZnO nanostructures has lead to the application of ZnO in solar cells with various device architectures. In this review, three types of ZnO/organic semiconductor HSCs will be examined. The first one is ZnO-NC/organic bulk heterojunction HSCs with randomly dispersed ZnO nanocrystals (ZnO-NC); the second is ZnO-NR/organic HSCs with vertically aligned ZnO nanorods (ZnO-NR); and finally ZnO-BL/organic HSCs with a bilayer structure (ZnO-BL). Fig. 2 shows schematic diagrams of these three device structures.

Early studies of ZnO/organic HSCs use a direct blend of ZnO nanocrystals and polymer semiconductors. The structure of ZnO-NC/organic bulk heterojunction HSCs is shown in Fig. 2a, and the device characteristics are compared in Table 1. The major advantage of this bulk heterojunction device structure is the much larger acceptor/donor interface area compared to planer structure, which leads to increased charge dissociation and current density.

In 2004, Janssen et al. first reported bulk heterojunction HSCs based on ZnO nanocrystals and poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) with power conversion efficiency η = 1.6% at 0.71 sun equivalent illumination, and η = 1.4% at 1.7 sun equivalent illumination. The same group also investigated the effect of nanocrystal geometry and UV light excitation on device performance of the ZnO-NC/MDMO-PPV HSCs. However, optimized devices did not exhibit PCE higher than the previously reported 1.6%. They also found that adding n-propylamine as a stabilizing ligand can smooth the ZnO-NC/polymer film, but it does not lead to improved device performance.
Besides MDMO-PPV, another polymer semiconductor that is widely used in ZnO-NC/organic HSCs is poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). In P3HT:methyl [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyrate (PCBM) OSCs, the hole mobility of P3HT can be very high after annealing, which is one of the important factors leading to high PCE of P3HT:PCBM OSCs. As one of the materials of choice for OSCs, P3HT has also been widely utilized in ZnO/organic HSCs. Janssen's group reported their study on ZnO-NC/P3HT bulk heterojunction solar cells in 2006. The fabrication and characterization techniques are similar to what they have used in their earlier work on ZnO-NC/MDMO-PPV bulk heterojunction HSCs. The best ZnO-NC/P3HT bulk heterojunction HSCs they reported exhibited Voc = 0.8 V, Jsc = 2.2 mA cm−2, FF = 0.46 and the highest PCE of η = 0.9%. This measured PCE is actually lower than that of ZnO-NC/MDMO-PPV bulk heterojunction HSCs they reported (0.9% compared to 1.6%), although the hole mobility of P3HT was expected to be higher than that of MDMO-PPV. The reason for the lower PCE of ZnO/P3HT bulk heterojunction HSCs is not completely known, and is probably due to many factors. For example, the presence of ZnO may influence the crystallization of P3HT due to the hydrophilic surface of ZnO, so that the hole mobility of P3HT in ZnO/P3HT bulk heterojunction solar cells is not as high as that of P3HT:PCBM solar cells.
While ZnO nanocrystals are usually first synthesized by hydrolysis and then dispersed into ZnO/polymer bulk heterojunction, for many studies on ZnO/polymer solar cells, an alternative route utilizes the mixture of diethylzinc precursor and polymer semiconductors to fabricate HSCs. The ZnO phase in the hybrid system is constructed in situ from a highly reactive diethylzinc precursor. The precursor is soluble in organic solvents, and can be cast into thin film together with a polymer. The precursor can then react with moisture upon exposure to air, resulting in well dispersed ZnO nanoparticles in polymer films.
This method was first illustrated for TiO2/polymer HSCs, where titanium isopropoxide was used as precursor for TiO2. However, TiO2 formed by this method is usually ill-defined and not well crystalized, so that TiO2/MDMO-PPV HSCs fabricated by this method exhibited poor result. High temperature annealing can form crystalline TiO2, but it is not compatible with organic semiconductors. This method was then further developed to fabricate ZnO/polymer HSCs, since crystalline ZnO can form at a lower temperature (∼110 °C). ZnO-NC/MDMO-PPV HSCs fabricated by this precursor mixture method exhibited a calculated PCE of η = 1.1%, and Voc as high as 1.14 V. The same method was utilized by Blom's group to fabricate ZnO-NC/P3HT solar cells, with a maximum efficiency of 1.4%.
The highest PCE of ZnO-NC/P3HT hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cell fabricated by this precursor method was recently reported by Janssen's group, with PCE of η = 2%, Voc = 0.75 V, Jsc = 5.2 mA cm−2 and FF= 0.52. This represents the highest PCE obtained from all ZnO/organic HSCs to date.
For ZnO/P3HT HSCs, surface modification on ZnO does not necessarily lead to higher PCE. In a recent study on porphyrin modified ZnO/P3HT HSCs, tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) molecules at various concentrations were grafted onto the surface of ZnO to enlarge the optical absorption spectrum of the blend. However, solar cells based on this architecture only exhibited a PCE of 0.06% due to very low current density.
While P3HT and MDMO-PPV are the materials of choice for most studies on ZnO/organic BHJ solar cells, a few other organic semiconductors have also been studied with this device structure. HSCs based on the blend of poly-3-phenylhydrazone thiophene (PPHT) and ZnO nanoparticles are reported to produce Voc = 0.64 V, Jsc = 0.38 mA cm−2, FF= 0.54 and PCE η = 0.12%. When ZnO was modified by dye, the light absorption in the active layer can be increased, and the device exhibited improved performance: Voc = 0.62 V, Jsc = 1.45 mA cm−2, FF= 0.61 and PCE η = 0.55%. A small molecular semiconductor, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), has also been investigated as the electron donor material of HSCs with this device structure. Voc as high as 0.84 V is reported, but the Jsc of the device is low (3.6 × 10−5 A cm−2).

Application of vertically aligned ZnO nanorods in HSCs is also motivated by studies on solar cells with TiO2 vertically aligned nanostructures. Compared with devices in a planar configuration, this device architecture has several advantages. For example, the morphology of the composite can be controlled in a systematic and reproducible way through controlling ZnO nanorod growth; devices using vertically aligned ZnO nanorods have increased electron donor/acceptor interface areas; and this device structure creates direct electron transport pathways toward the electrode that possess high electron mobility. Compared with ZnO-NC/organic bulk heterojunction HSCs, a device based on vertically aligned ZnO has both advantages and disadvantages: In ZnO-NC/organic bulk heterojunction HSCs, ZnO nanocrystals are randomly dispersed in organic semiconductor films, leading to an increased donor/acceptor interface area, which can effectively increase charge separation for photogenerated charge carriers, but the conducting path for electron transport is poorly formed. In ZnO-NR/organic HSC device architecture, devices consist of rigidly connected and vertically aligned ZnO nanorods, which can provide direct pathways for electron transport, but the interface area between ZnO and the organic semiconductor is usually smaller than that of ZnO-NC/organic bulk heterojunction HSCs.Table 2 lists the device performance observed from a few ZnO-NR/organic HSCs based on vertically aligned ZnO nanorods.

Olson et al. first reported their study on ZnO-NR/P3HT HSCs based on vertically aligned ZnO nanorods in 2006.ZnO/P3HT HSCs with this device structure produced a VOC of 0.44 V, a JSC of 2.2 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.56, and an η of 0.53%. The same group also studied the effect of polymer processing on ZnO-NR/P3HT solar cell performance. Improved performance was observed when dichlorobenzene was used as the solvent instead of chloroform, due to the enhanced infiltration and polymer order. They further demonstrated that thermal annealing can also improve the infiltration of the P3HT into the ZnO nanorods, which is one of the most important issues for solar cells with this vertically aligned nanorod structure.Fig. 3 compares cross-sectional SEM images of ZnO-NR/P3HT HSCs with and without annealing. It clearly shows that the infiltration of the P3HT polymer was enhanced with increasing annealing temperature, and more P3HT polymer adhered to the ZnO nanorods in the annealed samples after removing the polymer on top of the nanorods.
Very recently, the highest PCE of ZnO-NR/P3HT HSCs was reported by Manca's group. Post-annealing of devices at the melting temperature of P3HT for a well-defined time (about 1 min) can largely improve the PCE, which is believed to result from an improved crystallinity of the P3HT. Annealing the devices for a longer time was found to reduce device performance. The best device with an optimal thickness of the hole/electron blocking layers and ZnO NR length exhibited a PCE of 0.76%.
Besides P3HT, another polymer semiconductor poly(1-methoxy-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) also has been utilized in this type of HSCs. ZnO-NR/MEH-PPV with vertically aligned ZnO nanorods has been investigated by Wang's group very recently. High quality ZnO nanorods with rather low defect concentrations were prepared by electrodeposition. A peak PCE of η = 0.34% was observed.
In order to further improve device performance of ZnO-NR/organic HSCs, many approaches have been investigated to modify and optimize the ZnO-NR/organic interface.ZnO is practically easy to be substitutionally doped. Furthermore, the ZnO surface can be modified by coating with a thin layer of other materials. The electrical properties and surface energy of ZnO can then be controlled by the doping level or coating composition. Various doping and surface treatment methods are demonstrated to modify the performance of HSCs with this device structure.
For example, Peiró and Ravirajan et al. demonstrated the fabrication and characterization of dye modified ZnO-NR/polymer solar cells with vertically aligned nanorods acting as electron acceptor materials. Three different solution chemical routes were investigated for the synthesis of ZnO. An amphiphilic polypyridyl ruthenium complex (Z907) dye was used to modify interfacial electron transfer between P3HT and the ZnO nanostructure surface, which resulted in improved device performance when compared with devices without dye treatment.
The improvement is probably due in part to slower charge recombination after the amphiphilic dye molecular interface treatment. When P3HT was used as the polymer semiconductor and ZnO nanorods were treated by Z907 dye, the best device in this study exhibited JSC = 1.73 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.30 V, FF = 0.389 and η = 0.20%. Devices using the TPD(4M)-MEH-M3EH-PPVpolymer were also investigated with the similar fabrication process and exhibited a lower PCE of η = 0.15.%. This study reveals that charge recombination in the solar cell containing vertically aligned ZnO nanorods treated by dye is over 2 orders of magnitude slower than that for randomly oriented ZnO nanocrystals.
Other than those organic materials, inorganic coating has also been investigated to improve the device performance of ZnO-NR/organic HSCs. For example, Xu et al. reported a simple and low cost electrodeposition method to deposit n-type CdSe on the ZnO surface. ZnO-NR/P3HT solar cells with vertically aligned ZnO nanorods coated by CdSe exhibited an improved PCE of η = 0.88%, with Jsc = 4.89 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.51 V, and FF = 0.35. Both P3HT and CdSe were deposited by an electrodeposition process. Although P3HT acts as an electron donor material and CdSe/ZnO serves as an electron acceptor material for this solar cell, the structure of this device is more like that of a dye-sensitized solar cell considering the presence of electrolytes. Coating the vertically aligned ZnO nanorods by TiO2 is reported to improve the performance and stability of HSCs. Yang's group demonstrated that thin shells of TiO2 grown on the ZnO nanorods by atomic layer deposition can increase the VOC and FF relative to devices without shells, and the TiO2 coated ZnO-NR/P3HT HSCs stored in air for 1 month can still exhibit 0.29% efficiency.
One advantage of ZnO over many other semiconductors is that vertically aligned ZnO can be grown on many different substrates with low-cost techniques. For example, a hydrothermal method can be applied to fabricate ZnO nanorods on a large scale and, almost, on any substrate, which provides ample flexibility for the choice of electrode substrates for ZnO-NR/organic HSCs. Besides the commonly used but relative expensive indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine tin oxide (FTO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been utilized as a conductive electrode material for ZnO-NR/organic HSCs. Monocrystalline ZnO nanowires with high donor concentrations were electrochemically deposited on highly conductive rGO films. HSCs with a structure of quartz/rGO/ZnO/P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Au exhibited PCE η = 0.31%, with JSC = 1.43 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.66 V, and fill factor = 0.33.
Recently, Fréchet and Yang carried out an interesting study on ZnO/organic hybrid single nanowire solar cells. As shown in Fig. 4, end-functionalized p-type oligo and polythiophene are utilized to chemically graft the organic component to a ZnO nanowire, producing a p–n core–shell nanowire HSC. P3HT is end-functionalized with a phosphonic ester, and didodecylquaterthiophene (QT) is end-functionalized with phosphonic acid. The ZnO/P3HT nanowire device exhibited a JSC of 0.32 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.40 V, FF of 0.28, and an efficiency of 0.036%. The ZnO/QT nanowire device showed a similar efficiency of 0.033%.

The bilayer structure is the simplest device geometry for ZnO/organic HSCs. In this device architecture, a layer of ZnO is first deposited onto the electrode substrate, followed by the deposition of a second layer of p-type organic semiconductors, and then the top electrode. PCE of ZnO-BL/organic bilayer HSCs is usually lower than that of devices based on ZnO nanocrystals and vertically aligned ZnO nanowires, due to a smaller electron donor/acceptor interface area. The PCE of bilayer ZnO/organic HSCs can be improved through doping and surface modification on the ZnO layer.

Doping the ZnO layer with Mg at various concentrations is demonstrated to change the work function of ZnO, and hence change the photovoltaic performance of bilayer devices, as shown in Fig. 5. The highest-efficiency device (not shown in Fig. 5) was found to be Zn0.75Mg0.25O/P3HT. This device showed a JSC = 1.27 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.70 V, FF = 0.556, and η = 0.49%, respectively when high molecular-ordering P3HT (Rieke Metals) was used.
Another simple approach to enhance the efficiency of bilayer ZnO/organic HSCs is applying porous ZnO electrodes instead of dense ZnO films, making this device geometry similar to that of ZnO/organic HSCs based on vertically aligned ZnO nanowires. With this approach, the best device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 0.35% under AM1.5G simulated solar emission. Other efforts include annealing the ZnO layer in air, treating the ZnO layer by UV/ozone, and modifying the ZnO film thickness.
Overall, PCEs of ZnO/organic HSCs reported to date are still lower than those of OSCs. Future trends of this research field will be discussed in the conclusion and outlook part of this review.

In addition to acting as electron acceptor material in the active layer of ZnO/organic HSCs, ZnO can also be used as an important cathode buffer layer (CBL) as well as a transparent electrode, which has attracted increasing attention during the past 5 years. As we have mentioned, ZnO belongs to one of the n-type semiconductors with a wide band gap of 3.3 eV, exhibiting attractive features such as high electron mobility, good optical transmittance, and excellent stability. It also has merits such as being non-toxic, low cost and easy to process during large scale commercialization. So far various ZnO nanostructures have been fabricated by a number of methods and techniques, which include chemical vapor deposition, laser ablation, vacuum arc deposition, sputtering, electrochemical deposition and hydrothermal processes. All these advantages make ZnO an excellent candidate for an efficient CBL in OSCs or HSCs. Using ZnO as a CBL in solar cells can improve the PCE by collecting and extracting electron carriers, as well as blocking positive hole carriers.

Furthermore, such ZnO CBL is also considered as the optical spacer and oxygen barrier in solar cells devices to enhance their stabilities and lifetimes, and finally to improve the overall device performance. As a result, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the performance of organic and organic/inorganic HSCs by using ZnO nanostructures.
In this section, we will first focus on the applications of ZnO with several different structures as a CBL in organic and organic/inorganic HSCs with conventional or inverted device configurations. The conventional solar cells fabricated by introducing ZnO as a CBL are briefly discussed in the first part, and their corresponding device characteristics are compared according to the structure difference of ZnO (Table 3). Then the ZnO CBL-based solar cells with an inverted structure are specially highlighted due to the wide utilization of ZnO materials in these inverted devices. The ZnO CBLs in the inverted solar cells can be categorized into three groups, which include an intrinsic ZnO layer, a nanostructured ZnO layer, and a modified ZnO layer. Based on many impressive achievements in recent years, we are able to elaborate the role of ZnO as a CBL in these inverted solar cells, to discuss how the CBL affects the device characteristics as well as device stability (Tables 4–6). In the end, the use of ZnO as a transparent electrode in solar cells is also briefly introduced and discussed.

In general, organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) are mainly comprised of active materials, electrodes and their interfaces. For most of the OPVs, π-conjugated polymers or small organic molecules act as the electron-donor and hole transporting materials, while fullerene derivatives, etc. serve as the electron-acceptor and electron transporting materials. These two components form the active layer in BHJ solar cells with maximized interfacial donor/acceptor area. Upon light illumination, excitons are generated throughout the whole bulk active layer, and can diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface within a certain diffusion length (5–20 nm). The driving force induced by the difference between the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level of the donor material and the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level of the acceptor material can overcome the binding energy of photogenerated excitons, so they dissociate into free carriers by charge transfer. Then the separated positive and negative charges will transport to the cathode and anode through two different continuous pathways provided by the acceptor materials and donor materials respectively. Therefore, the interface between the active layer and both electrodes is of fundamental significance to the charge transport and extraction process, which play essential roles in the determination of device performance and lifetime. To achieve solar cells with high performance, it is critical to control the interfaces between the active layer and the electrodes in both conventional and inverted solar cells.

Recently, inserting ZnO materials into the interface between the active layer and the cathode in solar cells as a buffer layer is regarded as one of most effective strategies in interface engineering to improve the device performance, in combination with some hole-transporting and electron-blocking materials as an anode buffer layer (ABL). The device structures of ZnO CBL based conventional and inverted solar cells are shown in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 6a, the BHJ active layer of solar cells with the conventional structure is sandwiched between the transparent ITO/ABL anode and ZnO CBL deposited cathode. Table 3 summarizes the device characteristics of some representative ZnO CBL-based conventional solar cells. Chapuis et al. reported on the introduction of ZnO materials as a CBL in conventional solar cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al) devices with an improved PCE (an increase from 2.16% to 2.34%), and they also found that the device performance depends on the size of ZnO as well as the thickness of the ZnO CBL.
For P3HT:PCBM based solar cells, the efficiency also increased by annealing the ZnO CBL at a temperature of 130 °C and 150 °C. The improved performance was attributed to the fact that the Fermi level of ZnO (4.3 eV) is well matched with the LUMO of PCBM (4.3 eV), which facilitates efficient electron transfer and extraction from the PCBM based BHJs and the corresponding interfaces. In addition to the so-called optical spacer effect, the low-lying valence band of ZnO materials can also prevent hole carriers in the BHJ from reaching the cathode which would also contribute to the improved performance of the conventional solar cells.
Furthermore, interface engineering of the contact between the ZnO CBL and different metal cathodes is an important strategy to improve performance of organic and organic/inorganic HSCs. The characteristics of ZnO, such as its electrical and electronic properties, can be easily controlled and functionalized by modifying the ZnO surface by a self-assembled molecular layer (SAM), thus providing an efficient route to tune the contact property and improve the device performance. For instance, Jen et al. developed a simple solution deposition method to prepare highly effective polymer solar cells (the maximum of PCE reached up to 4.6%) with a SAM-modified ZnO/metal cathode bilayer. They found that the contact property between the ZnO layer and the metal cathode could be tuned by modifying the interface with different carboxylic acid-based SAMs. The performance of solar cells significantly depended on the dipole direction and chemical bonding between the SAM and metal cathodes. It was proposed that SAMs with an unfavorable dipole across the ZnO and metal thin film would result in a Schottky contact and poor device efficiencies. In contrast, an appropriate dipole across the ZnO and the metal thin film generated Ohmic contacts and improved device efficiencies dramatically. Consequently, the fabricated polymer solar cells exhibited dramatically enhanced efficiencies with appropriate SAMs. In this case, high work-function metals such as Ag or Au could also be used as cathodes. This finding paves a facile way to interface engineering in organic optoelectronic devices, and provides opportunities to obtain organic or organic/inorganic HSCs with high efficiencies. Although using ZnO as an effective CBL in conventional solar cells has so far been intensively explored, many challenges still remain and more efforts are needed.

Compared to conventional solar cells, ZnO-based inverted solar cells show a similar device composition but with the reversed polarity of the electrodes (shown in Fig. 6b). In this inverted structure, the intrinsic ZnO film is deposited on the bottom ITO or FTO electrode, serving as a CBL between the BHJ layer and the cathode for electron collection and hole-blocking, while some hole-transporting or electron-blocking materials such as PEDOT:PSS or metal oxide can also be inserted between the BHJ layer and suitable work-function metal anode to facilitate hole-collecting. The performance of inverted solar cells critically depends on the properties of the BHJ layer and the buffer layer, as well as their interfacial contact properties. Table 4 lists the device characteristics of some representative intrinsic ZnO film CBL based inverted solar cells with different BHJ layers, ABLs and electrodes.

In both organic and organic/inorganic HSCs, there is no doubt that the intrinsic ZnO thin film itself plays an essential role in the determination of the device performance. So far several strategies have been developed to prepare intrinsic ZnO thin film as a CBL in the inverted devices in order to improve the device efficiency as well as stability. Recently, Yang et al. fabricated new inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) by using a solution-processed ZnO thin film as a CBL, poly[9,9-bisoctylsilafluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-5′,5′′-diyl] (PSiF-DBT):PCBM blend as a BHJ layer, and MoO3/Au as an ABL-modified anode. They found an increased PCE of 3.8% for the inverted device with the ZnO CBL. In contrast, PSCs without a ZnO CBL only showed a PCE of 1.67%. At the same time, the operating and shelf stability for the device with a ZnO CBL are greatly improved. Jones et al. prepared intrinsic ZnO films with different structures for ZnO CBL-based inverted solar cells by using electrodeposition (ED) or spray pyrolysis (SP) methods. It was demonstrated that the performance of solar cells was affected by the film parameters including thickness, surface roughness, and morphology. They found that a CBL with a rougher ZnO film structure leads to more efficient OPV devices with improved charge collection (Fig. 7). The corresponding optimized device structures achieved a remarkable maximum PCE of 4.91%, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 74%, as well as good device operation stability in air and nitrogen. This facile electrodeposition procedure of processing ZnO CBL is a useful thin-film technique for interface engineering of organic or organic/inorganic hybrid devices, so that it holds considerable potential for large area processing. More recently, Wang et al. used atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit ZnO film on flexible ITO/poly(ethylene naphthalate) substrate (PEN) as a CBL in inverted solar cells. They achieved a maximum PCE of 4.18% on this flexible ZnO CBL based inverted solar cells. Because the whole processing temperature can be kept below 110 °C, ALD-grown ZnO may be a promising candidate as the electron selecting layer in different kinds of flexible OPV devices. Other methods such as sol–gel, spin-coating, and thermal annealing have also been used to process intrinsic ZnO layer to improve the performance of various solar cells. Though many available methods have been demonstrated to fabricate intrinsic ZnO films, advanced techniques are still needed to precisely control some film properties of ZnO, such as the thickness, morphology, crystallinity, and work function.
In general, PSCs using a P3HT:PCBM blend as an active layer exhibit a higher efficiency compared to those with an active layer of pure P3HT, C60/P3HT and small organic molecules blends. When inserting intrinsic ZnO as the CBL into inverted solar cells, the PCE of P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells reached up to as high as 4.91%, whereas the PCEs of pure P3HT and CuPc:C60/CuPc BHJ solar cells only are 0.13% and 0.31%, respectively. By using intrinsic ZnO as a CBL in ITO/C60/P3HT/Au solar cells, the fill factor (FF) increased from 36% to 54% and the energy conversion efficiency under monochromatic light (500 nm) was improved from 3.0% to 5.2%. The introduced intrinsic ZnO layer altered the contact type of the interface and played a role of leak prevention in the solar cells, leading to improved device performance.
However, PCEs of the above depicted BHJs-based inverted solar cells are mostly less than ca. 5%, which is inferior to those of conventional solar cells to some extent. In order to further increase the PCE of solar cells, new photoactive blend layers will play a key role. It is well known that the widely employed PCBM:P3HT active material has a relatively small energy offset between the HOMO of P3HT (−5.0 eV) and the LUMO of PCBM (−3.91 eV). This drawback limits the magnitude of Voc to around 0.65 V. To solve this problem, a promising approach is to develop a new fullerene derivative with a higher-lying LUMO energy level, to improve Voc and device efficiency while maintaining other parameters. In this context, a novel n-type indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) with a LUMO of −3.74 eV was recently developed and used to blend with p-type P3HT as a highly effective BHJ active layer to fabricate ITO/ZnO/ICBA:P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Au solar cells, which achieved an increased Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 10.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.55, yielding a high PCE of 4.81%. This PCE value shows a 31% improvement compared to that of the corresponding ITO/ZnO/PCBM:P3HT/PEDOT:PSS/Au solar cells. It should be noted that the Voc of the devices can also be tuned by using p-type polymers with lower-lying HOMO levels. Recently, Heeger et al. demonstrated air-stable inverted BHJ solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of approximately 6% fabricated with a low-temperature annealed sol–gel-derived ZnO film as an electron transport layer. In these devices, a low band-gap polymer, poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) with a low lying HOMO level and [6,6]-phenyl C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) were used to form an active layer to achieve an increased Voc and an improved Jsc, which contribute to the increased efficiency. More recently, when poly[5,5′(4,4′-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole)-alt-1,3(5-octyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione)] (P-Ge) was used to blend with PC70BM to form an active layer in inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells, the cells displayed average power conversion efficiencies of 7.3%, which demonstrated a promising way for the fabrication of organic solar cells with high efficiencies and long-term stability.
Besides the effects of photoactive materials on the device performance, ABL materials and metal anodes can also influence the performance of intrinsic ZnO CBL-based solar cells. It is known that the ABL materials play an important role similar to ZnO CBL in determining the efficiency of inverted solar cells by collecting and extracting holes for the anode. If PEDOT:PSS was used as an ABL, the ZnO CBL-based inverted solar cells with a ITO cathode and Ag anode showed a PCE of 3.5%, which is larger than that of the corresponding inverted solar cells without an ABL (PCE 2.97%).
By replacing the Ag anode with an Au anode or an ITO cathode with an FTO cathode, all the fabricated solar cells exhibited lower PCEs. In addition, metal oxides such as MoO3, CuOx and WOx are another significant class of ABL materials which have been extensively researched in several inverted solar cells with a ZnO CBL. Kyaw et al. demonstrated that the ZnO CBL-based solar cells incorporated with MoO3 had a larger Voc and a higher FF than devices without the MoO3 ABL. Using MoO3 as an ABL, an optimized PCE approaching 3.09% was achieved by modifying the transmittance of sol–gel derived ZnO thin film to 95%. Lin et al. employed sol–gel derived CuOx thin film as an ABL to improve the performance of the ZnO CBL-based inverted solar cells based on P3HT:PCBM. It was found that this CuOx layer induced the formation of an Ohmic contact between the BHJ layer and the electrode, and it also redistributed the light intensity to enhance light absorption. Accordingly, an improvement of Jsc from 11.0 to 11.9 mA cm−2 and of PCE from 3.11% to 4.02% was observed. An amorphous ZnO film was also found to be an effective CBL for high performance inverted tandem solar cells by Yang et al. In their tandem devices, good electrical and optical coupling of the two sub-cells was achieved by using a MoO3/Al/ZnO layer. 10 nm of MoO3 obtained by thermal evaporation and 30 nm of amorphous ZnO film obtained by sol–gel process were used as effective hole and electron collectors. A high PCE of 5.1% was achieved under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G illumination.

With the rapid development of nanotechnology, ZnO nanomaterials are currently drawing tremendous interest due to their controllable structures, novel optoelectronic properties, and facile synthesis strategies. When the nanostructured ZnO was used as a CBL in the inverted solar cells, they could show distinctive nano-effects in addition to some beneficial effects for high performance solar cells as provided by intrinsic ZnO films. Not surprisingly, nano-effects such as size effect, surface effect, and others have led to some unexpected results and improved device performance.

So far, a large number of solar cell devices with a CBL based on low-dimensional ZnO nanostructures have been reported, and their improved performances and fabrication methods have also been investigated. The configuration and device parameters of some representative devices based on ZnO nanostructured CBL are summarized in Table 5.

ZnO
nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most popular low-dimensional ZnO nanostructures, which have been widely used in solar cells to serve as efficient electron extraction and transportation materials similar to the intrinsic or bulk ZnO. A facile solution processing method was used to synthesize ZnO NPs viahydrolysis and condensation of zinc acetate dihydrate using potassium hydroxide in methanol. The resulting ZnO NPs have good electron mobility (about 0.066 cm2V¬1s¬1) without additional post-thermal treatment. By incorporating a ZnO NPs thin film as a CBL, several inverted solar cells were designed and investigated extensively. It was found that the inverted solar cells with the room temperature solution-processed ZnO NPs as a CBL displayed similar device performance (shown in Table 5) to the cells with the high temperature sol–gel processed bulk ZnO as a CBL. It should be noted that an advantage of these ZnO NPs CBL-based inverted solar cells is the greatly improved performance in stability compared to the conventional cell devices. For example, Jen et al. found that the inverted cells showed only a 20% decrease in efficiency after 40 days under ambient conditions, while the conventional device barely exhibited any photovoltaic activity after 4 days. At the same time, these ZnO NPs could also be deposited onto plastic ITO substrates to fabricate air-stable, flexible inverted solar cells. Nonetheless, the plastic substrates did slightly affect the device performance due to the reduced transmittance of the substrates. A similar flexible solar cell device with inverted configuration of PET/ITO/ZnO NPs/P3HT:PCBM/Ag was recently reported by Choy et al. The opposite shape of the J–V curves for the flexible solar cells with ZnO NPs CBL and without ZnO was attributed to the converse directions of charge transport, suggesting the electron-transporting and hole-blocking action of ZnO NPs. These results demonstrated the availability of developing stable, low-cost, large area, roll-to-roll printable solar cells using ZnO NPs as a CBL.
To further improve the cell performance, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures were developed as another important family of nanostructured ZnO to construct an efficient CBL in the inverted solar cells. Using 1D ZnO nanostructures layer instead of a ZnO NP film led to the rapid collection of generated carriers because the device with 1D ZnO nanostructures provided a directly conducting and ordered path from the point of photogeneration to the electrode, thus effectively reducing the electron recombination losses and improving the device performance. However, the ZnO NPs layer may result in enhanced scattering of free electrons due to the disorder of particle structures, thus reducing the electron mobility and increasing the detrimental electron recombination rate.
Several groups have synthesized various 1D ZnO nanostructures, such as nanorods (NRs), nanopillars (NPIs), nanofibers (NFs) and nanowires (NWs), as well as arrays to achieve the improved performance of organic and organic/inorganic HSCs (Table 5).
In a typical case of ZnO NRs CBL-based solar cells, the inverted device structure is shown in Fig. 8a, which has three main components: a thin film ITO cathode, a thick hybrid layer (about 450 nm) of P3HT:PCBM BHJ and ZnO NRs CBL, as well as an anode layer of Ag. The used ZnO NR arrays were prepared on two different seed layers: (1) the sol–gel layers using a Zn/amino ethanol complex as a precursor and (2) ZnO NP layers, while the highly uniform and densely packed ZnO NR arrays were successfully produced (shown in Fig. 8b). At this time, the FF of the solar cells increased from 38% to 50% by the incorporation of ZnO NRs, which contributed to the improvement of the PCEs approaching 2.7%. Additionally, their photovoltaic performance was found to improve with the increase of the ZnO NRs average length, similar to the reported hybrid P3HT/elongated CdS nanocrystals solar cells with the FTO-coated ZnO NRs electrode. When an ABL of VOx film was further introduced, the PCE of the corresponding devices was greatly improved to 3.9%. The effect of ZnO NRs on the device performance of these solar cells has been studied in details by Hashimoto et al. Hames et al. used electrochemically processed ZnO film/ZnO NRs as a CBL in inverted solar cells to achieve an optimized efficiency of 2.4%. It was found that the solidification time of the active layer could also affect the device performance of inverted polymer/ZnO NRs HSCs. By slow-drying the active layer, a relatively high device efficiency of 3.58% was achieved without using any ABL materials, which can be attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of the polymer, the increased thickness without decreasing the charge transport efficiencies, and the infiltration of the active materials. The enhanced infiltration will lead to the increased interface area and good contact property, which resulted in an improvement of the charge transport across the interface and better charge collection. Furthermore, the observed vertical phase separation effect with the slow drying conditions is also beneficial to the enhanced electrode selectivity in favor of improved solar cell performance.
Likewise, ZnO NPIs and NFs are also broadly investigated in solar cells with an inverted device structure (see Table 5). Similar to ZnO NRs, ZnO NPIs served as an efficient 1D nanostructured ZnO CBL to improve the efficiency of inverted solar cells. As for the ZnO NFs, it has been shown that HSCs with ZnO NFs CBL and P3HT active layer revealed better photovoltaic performance as a result of the increased donor–acceptor interfacial area compared to planar ZnO/P3HT devices, which is in good agreement with the reported higher efficiency of ZnO NRs than flat ZnO films and ZnO NPs. More importantly, the solar cells exhibited a surprising improvement in performance after storage in air, which suggested the important role of native defects and surface properties of ZnO nanostructures.
1D nanostructured ZnO can also be used in small molecular based solar cells to improve device performance. By incorporating aligned 1D ZnO NWs as the CBL, the small molecular based HSCs (CuPc:C60/CuPc) with an efficiency of 0.53% have been reported. The fabricated devices with ZnO NWs exhibited a salient improvement in PCE and an enhancement of EQE at the maximum absorption wavelength compared to the solar cells without ZnO NWs, which was attributed to the increased exciton dissociation interface area and continuous carrier transport pathways resulting from the ZnO NWs.
More recently, some other novel ZnO nanostructures such as nanoridges and nanodisks (NDs) have been synthesized and used as CBLs in inverted solar devices. Yang et al. synthesized a unique thin film structure of a ZnO nanoridge and explored its application in solar cells. These ZnO nanoridges, with a peak of about 120 nm and a valley to valley distance of about 500 nm, were formed by a ramp annealing method similar to a simple sol–gel processed ZnO planar layer. As a CBL in inverted solar cells, such a nanoridge structure had excellent electron-collection properties similar to the case of ZnO NRs, and thus contributed to the improvement in FF, yielding a high PCE of 4.0%, which is about a 25% increase compared to similar devices made by a planar CBL based on ZnO NPs. Other films based on nanoporous ZnO and ZnO NDs were also synthesized in order to promote the development of ZnO nanostructures and their applications in solar cells. However, when they were used as CBLs in solar cells, a relatively lower efficiency was found compared to ZnO ridges and 1D ZnO nanostructures.

Although most recent studies have focused on the intrinsic and nanostructured ZnO CBL-based inverted solar cells, the efficiencies of these devices still need to be improved and optimized. Recently, researchers found one important way to achieve better performing devices by using modified ZnO as more effective CBL materials. Based on different modification types, modified ZnO can be divided into three categories: (1) element doped-ZnO, (2) surface modified-ZnO, and (3) ZnO/additive blends. Using these modified ZnO as CBLs in the inverted solar cells, the corresponding device characteristics of some representative samples are summarized in Table 6.

By elemental doping, a dramatic increase in the photovoltaic performance of inverted solar cells can be found by using element doped-ZnO as an efficient electron transport layer. By employing a gallium (Ga)-doped ZnO (GZO) as a CBL, the PCE of the fabricated solar cells was improved by about 110% compared to that of devices with undoped ZnO as a CBL, which was ascribed to the higher electron conductivity and favorable surface morphology of the buffer layer through Ga-doping. By replacing Ga with indium (In) to modify ZnO, a similar improvement of Jsc and PCE in the In-doped ZnO (IZO) CBL-based inverted solar cells was also achieved.
Surface modification of ZnO between the active layer and ZnO layer with functional materials such as SAMs,dyes, and other organic molecules has also been shown to be a very effective way to optimize the performance of inverted solar cells. A series of ZnO/C60-SAMs with different dipole moments was developed by Jen et al. to tune the contact properties of inverted P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells. These functional layers were considered to have several functions, including enhancement of interfacial exciton dissociation efficiency, passivation of inorganic-surface trap states, and optimization of upper organic layer morphology. As a result, the C60-SAM modified ZnO solar cells achieved a high PCE of 4.9%, which is a 20% improvement over the unmodified devices. At the same time, an improvement in both the FF from 55.4% to 60.6% and Jsc from 10.8 to 12.0 mA cm−2 was observed. By modifying the interfaces between the ZnO buffer layer and the active layer with a C60-SAM in inverted tandem solar cells, Jen et al. found an improved PCE of 2.9%. More recently, a cross-linked fullerene interlayer, C-PCBSD, was used to modify the ZnO CBL in P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells, which exerted multiple positive effects on the interface of the active layer, including improved exciton dissociation efficiency, reduced charge recombination, decreased interface contact resistance, and induction of vertical phase separation to reduce the bulk resistance of the active layer as well as passivation of the local shunts at the ZnO interface. Thus the designed solar cells achieved a significantly improved PCE of 4.4% as well as an exceptional lifetime compared to the device without a modified ZnO CBL. By the incorporation of such C-PCBSD modified ZnO CBL into the ICBA:P3HT BHJ solar cells to modulate the interface properties, the fabricated inverted devices (ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/P3HT:ICBA/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) showed an improved Jsc and an increased FF due to the enhancement of the electron collection, thus boosting the PCE to a record high value of 6.22%, which is a 29% improvement over devices (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:ICBA/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) without using C-PCBSD to modify the ZnO layer (Fig. 9a). The device with C-PCBSD modified ZnO CBL (Device B in Fig. 9b) also exhibited a large EQE maximum of 74%, which was consistent with its high photocurrent. This effective modification of the ZnO CBL is very useful to achieve solar cell devices with high performance and good stability.
Introduction of additives such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and CdTe quantum dots (CdTe-QDs) into ZnO film has also been investigated to tune the characteristics of ZnO CBL and to further optimize solar cells device performance. For example, Lim et al. reported that the device efficiency of the ZnO CBL-based OPVs with the inverted structure was dramatically improved by introducing SWCNTs into the ZnO film. Use of SWCNTs provided a higher carrier mobility of the ZnO/SWCNT blend layer and an increased contact area between the electrode and active layer due to the increased surface roughness, thus contributing to the improvement of device performance.

Since ZnO materials have good electrical conduction and optical transmittance, they can also serve as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrode in organic and organic/inorganic OSCs when doping by a metal element such as Al and Ga.ZnO doped with aluminium (AZO) was demonstrated as a suitable TCO electrode for BHJ devices owing to its high electrical conductivity and excellent optical transparency in the near infrared and visible regions. As for small-molecule based solar cells, a PCE of 1.3% with use of an AZO substrate was observed. For OPV solar cells with an AZO substrate, relatively high PCEs of 2.84% and 3.15% were achieved when incorporating PEDOT:PSS as an ABL and NiO as a CBL. Likewise, ZnO doped with gallium (GZO) was also developed as an efficient TCO electrode in solar cells. Low-cost GZO thin films could be grown by batch type DC/RF magnetron sputtering, demonstrating their good potential for low-cost TCO electrodes. However, their low PCE is one of main drawbacks. Thus, an efficient cylindrical rotating magnetron sputtering (CRMS) system was employed to fabricate low-cost and large area solar cells based on CRMS-grown GZO film electrodes with low sheet resistance (about 11.67 Ω per square) and high transparency (90%). The resulting solar cells showed a high PCE of 3.15%. In view of the process efficiency and materials cost of this approach, it is believed that CRMS-grown GZO electrodes are more suitable for realization of low-cost OPVs than the conventional batch-type grown GZO electrodes.


The maximum PCEs of ZnO/organic HSCs reported to date have been much lower than those of fully OSCs, especially for the polymer:PCBM OSCs. Actually the VOC of many ZnO/organic HSCs is comparable to that of the corresponding fully OSCs, and the lower PCE of HSCs is usually due to much lower current densities. The reason for the low current density of ZnO/organic HSCs is only partially understood, and can be attributed to a lot of factors such as poor polymer infiltration in ZnO nanostructure, low polymer/ZnO wettability and limited active donor/acceptor interfacial areas. For ZnO-BL/organic HSCs with bilayer architecture, the current density of devices is mainly limited by the effective donor/acceptor interfacial area and the depth of light absorption. ZnO-NC/organic bulk heterojunction HSCs usually have extensive donor/acceptor interfacial areas. However, a portion of these domains can be isolated due to the random dispersion of ZnO nanocrystals. Charge carriers generated in these isolated domains cannot transport to electrodes, which results in a reduced current density and a low PCE. Additionally, if devices are fabricated by depositing the blend solution of ZnO nanocrystals and polymer semiconductors, ZnO nanocrystals may aggregate during solvent evaporation, which will again reduce the current density and the PCE of solar cells. For the case of ZnO-NR/organic HSCs based on vertically aligned ZnO nanorods, the device structure is close to that of ideal HSCs. Theoretical studies show that an ideal HSC structure is a perfect vertically aligned array of single-crystalline nanorods of the appropriate dimensions and pitch covered with organic semiconductors. This structure provides direct pathways for efficient charge carrier collection. However, PCEs of ZnO/organic HSCs based on vertically aligned ZnO nanorods reported to date are still modest. Studies on TiO2/P3HT HSCs have shown that polymer infiltration is a big challenge for HSCs with nanostructured inorganic semiconductors. The infiltration of polymers into inorganic semiconductor nanostructures can be quite low even after thermal annealing. This is probably also true for the case of ZnO-NR/polymer HSCs. Another factor that may limit the overall PCEs of ZnO-NR/polymer HSCs is the large spacing between ZnO nanorods (in average ∼100 nm), which is much larger than exciton diffusion length of a polymer semiconductor (usually <20 nm). In brief, better controlled nanostructures with favorable morphology are essential to drive the PCE of ZnO/organic HSCs higher. Besides that, the hole/electron blocking layer thicknesses and ZnO NR length also need to be systematically studied and optimized simultaneously in order to further improve PCE of ZnO/organic HSCs.

While numerous polymer semiconductors have been investigated for the PCBM/polymer OSC system, only a very limited amount of organic semiconductors have been studied for the ZnO/polymer HSC system. Most of those studies utilize P3HT as the electron donor material, with only a few exceptions including poly (p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and metal phthalocyanines (Pc), because of the good performance obtained from PCBM/P3HT solar cells. At optimized deposition and annealing conditions, P3HT and PCBM can phase separate into the desired nanoscale architecture with an interpenetrating network and appropriate domain size, which is essentially important for BJH OSCs. However, P3HT is not necessary the best choice for the case of ZnO/organic HSCs, since the morphology of the active layer in ZnO/organic HSCs is usually confined by inorganic ZnO nanocrystals or nanorods in this case. Studies have shown that when P3HT is constrained in oxide nanostructures, charge carrier mobility of P3HT can be orders of magnitude lower than its mobility in PCBM/P3HT solar cells, which results in low PCEs of HSCs. A similar issue was raised regarding ZnO/PPV HSCs. Mobility of PPV is as low as 5.5 × 10−10 cm2 V−1s−1 in ZnO/PPV HSCs, which limits the performance of solar cells. To further improve the performance of ZnO/organic HSCs, more p-type organic semiconductors besides PPV and P3HT need to be tested and investigated, including polymers with a smaller band gap absorbing at longer wavelengths, and even those polymers which cannot form desired nanoscale morphology through phase separation with PCBM in OSCs.
Compared to ZnO/organic HSCs, studies on solar cells with ZnO serving as a CBL or transparent electrode are more promising in view of the achieved high efficiencies. As ZnO can provide an Ohmic contact with the acceptor material and can transport electrons while blocking holes, over the past few years, it has been extensively used as a CBL material in conventional or inverted solar cells. In order to increase the solar cell efficiency, various ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized and fabricated as a CBL in solar cells with an attempt to improve charge transport across the interface, get better charge collection, enhance the surface area of the nanostructured ZnO electrode, obtain a beneficial phase separation effect in favor of improved solar cell performance, or reduce interface contact resistance. Although many techniques can be used to synthesize the ZnO nanostructures, only a few of them show potential for future commercialization from the viewpoint of the cost, solution processability and scalability of various techniques. In most solar cells with a ZnO CBL, P3HT:PCBM is still a benchmark blend for photoactive material and most of these solar cells devices have an efficiency in the range of 1–4.8%. Further improvement in the efficiency of PSCs based on P3HT:PCBM is limited by the relatively large band gap of P3HT, and relatively small energy difference between the LUMO of PCBM and the HOMO of P3HT. Therefore, the future record high efficiency of solar cells will go to devices based on other photoactive materials instead of P3HT:PCBM. As expected, an improved efficiency of 6.2% and increased Voc of 0.84 V was achieved for the inverted OSCs employing ZnO as a CBL, where a PCBM derivative (ICBA) with a higher-lying LUMO level was used to ensure a larger Voc and a cross-linked fullerene interlayer, C-PCBSD was used to further modify the ZnO CBL. Likewise, when a low band-gap polymer P-Ge with a lower-lying HOMO level was used to blend with PC70BM to form the photoactive layer in inverted OSCs with a ZnO CBL, the cells displayed a new record high efficiency of 7.3% due to the increased light harvesting ability of the photoactive materials and an improved Voc. Now, it has become clear that, to achieve organic and organic/inorganic solar cells with an efficiency up to the commercialization level, the development of new photoactive materials (both n-type and p-type materials), together with new buffer layer materials, new electrodes, as well as new interfacial engineering techniques to get beneficial interfacial properties, will play a vital role. As the inverted OSCs technology continues to advance and the efficiency continues to increase, inverted OSCs with a ZnO CBL now have a bright future with the benefit of being cheaper to produce and of being more stable compared to conventional OSCs without a ZnO CBL. It should be noted that so far most high performance inverted OSCs devices have a relatively small area of ∼4 mm2. For real applications, more efforts should be made on the inverted OSCs with large device areas without the loss in the device stability as well as the device parameters including PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF.
