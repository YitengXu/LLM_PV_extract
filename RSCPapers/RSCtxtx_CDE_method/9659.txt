Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have emerged as a promising material to replace conventional semiconductors for different applications owing to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, major concerns like toxicity and stability issues of lead (Pb) based perovskites have tempted researchers to explore the potential of alternative Pb-free perovskite structures by replacing the Pb with nontoxic, or at least less-toxic, and less moisture/oxygen sensitive elements. In this review, we have discussed the effect of Pb2+ replacement with alternative metal ions on their band structures, thus illustrating their impact on the fundamental optoelectronic properties (band gap, binding energy, dielectric constant, effective mass, diffusion length, charge carrier lifetime, mobility, and defects) and identified the reasons, which make them lag behind their Pb-based counterparts. Additionally, the current scenario of the Pb-free perovskite photovoltaics, i.e., the effects of doping and interfacial engineering on the stability and photovoltaic performances, have been presented. The strategies of Pb replacement, such as isovalent or heterovalent substitution resulting in ABX3, A2B(I)B(III)X6, A3□B(III)2X9 and A2□B(IV)X6 materials have been highlighted (here □ denotes vacancy). This review highlights the potential of Pb-free perovskites and presents an overview of directions and strategies for their application in solar photovoltaics.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are the first solution-processable technology to surpass multi-crystalline and thin-film silicon solar cells, and currently, a record-breaking power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% has been achieved (certified 25.7%). LHPs commonly rely on the APbX3 structure, where A is an inorganic or organic cation (Cs+, methylammonium, etc.) and X is halide ion (I−, Br−etc.). The high performance obtained for PSCs is ascribed to their remarkable optoelectronic properties such as suitable direct band gap (∼1.48–1.62 eV) close to ideal Shockley–Queisser gap for single-junction solar cells, high absorption coefficient (1.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm for CH3NH3PbI3), long carrier diffusion length (up to ∼1 μm), low trap density (1016 to 1017 cm−3), small exciton binding energy (∼20 meV) and shallow defect states. In addition, their easy processibility using solution-based techniques at low temperatures and low energy payback time has made them promising candidates for photovoltaic technology and other applications such as LED, photodetectors, memristors, radiation detectors, etc. However, the main issues that must be overcome for scale-up purposes are the poor stability and toxicity of used materials. The perovskite solids have an inherent “soft” crystal lattice, which is one of the main reasons for their poor stability and makes PSCs vulnerable to different external factors, such as moisture, UV-light, thermal annealing, and electric field. Some recent reviews have highlighted these factors and the current challenges with the stability of PSCs. In terms of the severe concerns about the toxicity of Pb ion, it would be advantageous to discover alternate components that preserve the LHPs distinctive optoelectronic properties. It is unknown how the lead from perovskite materials will actually affect the environment. Lead leakage from PSCs may infiltrate plants ten times more effectively than other lead toxins and could have an impact on the food cycle. Although bismuth is thought to be harmless and an adult may tolerate up to 15 g of it (Pb is 1 mg), its prolonged usage may have negative consequences on humans, including poisoning. The types of bismuth compounds and the amounts consumed determine the specific cases' bismuth toxicity levels. Additionally, antimony (Sb), a less dangerous element, may be used in place of lead (Pb) in perovskite frameworks to fabricate PSCs. In contrast to Pb which is absorbed by the human body, antimony residues are mostly excreted out through human excreta and urine. Since antiquity, silver (Ag) has also been utilized, but unlike Pb, it is universally recognized as safe for use in dental fillings, plates, and cutlery with no known adverse effects. The explanation above leads to the conclusion that toxicology is a challenging science that depends on the chemical form of an exposure to determine if one element is more dangerous than another. The stability and toxicity of lead perovskite can also be resolved by encapsulation of the PSCs with an ideal encapsulating materials. However, the currently available encapsulating materials are far from an ideal material which should be chemically inert and its deposition should stop the degradation of active device layers. Therefore, the encapsulation material used for PSCs should have >90% transmittance for the incident light, should resist the degradation induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, as well as it should have low oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR). Moreover, good mechanical properties, adhesion to the contact surfaces within the module, and a thermal expansion coefficient matching that of PSC components are required. In addition, the problem of lead ion leakage from the encapsulated devices still persists, leading to the entering of the lead ions into the environment through moisture and rain. Thus, it is of great interest and necessity to search for non-lead-based ions to use in perovskite materials to build environmentally-friendly and stable materials.

To address the toxicity issue, generally Pb is completely or partially replaced by alternative metals. Several key properties were proposed by Brandt et al. that are likely to give rise to defect-tolerant and highly efficient solar absorbers, including small effective mass of electron and hole, a large dielectric constant, a valence band maximum (VBM) composed of antibonding states, and high levels of band dispersion. As such, a broad range of compounds comprising Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, Sb3+, and Bi3+, cations are of current interest to be incorporated in the absorber layer. Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of how Pb-replacement has been done in the past and the results that have been obtained so far. There are two general types to be considered: employing either homovalent- (Sn, Ge) or heterovalent- (Bi, Sb) elements to replace Pb. The homovalent substitution results in the same ABX3 type of structure. The heterovalent substitution may result in mixed cation compounds commonly known as double perovskites and represented as A2B(I)B(III)X6. In addition, B(III) compounds with the general formula A3□B(III)2X9 and B(IV) compounds with the general formula A2□B(IV)X6 are two subgroups of the ordered vacancy categories (here, □ indicates vacancy). Fig. 1 also summarises the properties and concerns of each set of materials providing a clear understanding of the replacement of Pb with other metals. A decrease in electronic dimensionality is the primary cause of the lower electronic properties that comes from the heterovalent substitution of Pb. On the other hand, oxidation associated instability has been observed in the case of homovalent substitution by Sn or Ge. Antimony/bismuth-based perovskite derivatives, and double perovskites exhibit excellent chemical stability. Moreover, bismuth (Bi3+) and antimony (Sb3+) were used to replace the Pb, which form A3B2X9 structure. These perovskites usually show low-dimensional phases, which accounts for their improved stabilities but also results in broader bandgaps and poor photovoltaic performance. From the above discussion, it can be concluded that all lead-free perovskites are not stable than the lead-halide perovskites. It depends on the perovskite composition, morphology, interface and many other factors as discussed in this review. For all Pb-free perovskite and perovskite-derived solar cells reported in the literature, the photovoltaic performance is inferior compared to Pb-based counterparts. A lot of optimization strategies are needed to achieve stable lead-free PSCs maintaining its performance.
The advantages that are offered by lead free perovskite materials are reduced toxicity, better stability, and a rich chemistry. The rich chemistry of Pb-free perovskites makes them appropriate for indoor and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) as well as tandem devices. These Pb-free perovskites reveal huge band gap tunability, high transparency, and a large variety of colours (across the visible spectrum) which are prerequisites for the semi-transparent thin film technology. The key advantage in applying Pb-free perovskites is the prospect of realizing multi-colour BIVP modules which can be easily utilized as the building parts such as facades, windows, walls, and fences to enhance artistic design along with power generation. These semi-transparent devices with suitable band gaps can also be very useful for the tandem top cells. Highly efficient tandem photovoltaic devices require a wide band gap top cell (1.7 to 1.9 eV) and a low band gap bottom cell (0.9 to 1.2 eV). Both Pb-based and Pb-free perovskites reveal a suitable band gap for the tandem top cells and can be utilized with the other low band gap semiconductors. However, it is impossible to tune the band gap of Pb-based perovskites lower than 1.48 eV, and these materials will not be appropriate for the bottom cells. Pb-free perovskites can exhibit individually low and high band gaps and will be very advantageous for perovskite–perovskite tandem devices.
In this review, various Pb-free perovskite materials and their applications in solar cells have been discussed. The effect of replacing Pb with other possible isovalent and heterovalent atoms on the fundamental optoelectronic properties such as band structure, charge carrier mobility and lifetime, effective mass of electron and hole, etc. are summarized. Different Pb-free perovskites such as ABX3, A2B(I)B(III)X6, A3□B(III)2X9 and A2□B(IV)X6 materials have been highlighted. Additionally, the development of their photovoltaic devices has been included. Finally, a direction and strategy for the further development of Pb-free PSCs have been predicted.

Among the above proposed structures of homovalent substitution, the most promising materials so far are perovskites based on Sn, since they exhibit higher optical absorption coefficients (104 to 105 cm−1) along with narrower optical band gaps (1.2–1.4 eV), small exciton binding energy (2–50 meV), and high carrier mobility (322–2320 cm2 (V−1 s−1)) which are competitive to those observed in lead-based perovskites. While the 6p (along with 6s) orbital of Pb is important in defining the band structure of a typical hybrid perovskite, Sn 5p orbital is however less shallow as well as dispersive, resulting in a narrower bandgap. On the other hand, Sn-based perovskite materials have high carrier mobility (322–2320 cm2 (V−1 s−1)) than Pb-based counterparts (up to 518 cm2 V−1 s−1), which makes them superior to Pb-based perovskite materials. Sn-based solar cells had shown enormous progress in the efficiency since 2012, when a PCE of 0.88% was achieved for the first time, and have reached an impressive efficiency of 14.81% in 2021. Although the Sn-based perovskites show such promising progress, their performance still falls behind the Pb-based counterparts due to the ease of Sn2+ oxidation, formation of high defect levels, and fast crystallization properties. This leads to the poor photovoltaic performance (both in terms of efficiency and stability) of the devices. Several efforts have been made to address these issues in the Sn-based PSCs by solution engineering, compositional engineering including crystal dimensionality, and device engineering, which will be discussed later in this review (Section 3.1). For CsSnI3, i.e., all-inorganic Sn-based systems, Ye et al. reported efficiency of 10.1% by using additives that restricted the oxidation of Sn2+ and, thus, its fast degradation. The other divalent substitute for Pb2+ is Ge2+. However, the Ge-based perovskite materials haven't yet achieved substantial success, since Ge2+ possesses low chemical stability and it is moderately soluble in polar compounds, which limited their potential. The maximum reported efficiency for Ge-based perovskites when used in solar cells is merely 0.57%. A 50% alloying of Ge2+ with Sn2+ yielded an efficiency of 7.11%, which gives hope of achieving higher efficiency for an alloyed Pb-free system. Similarly, due to its electrical structure being similar to that of Pb, Sb is also a viable contender to replace Pb in several applications. Yang et al. proposed an easy approach for facilitating heterogeneous nucleation process along with controlling the dimensions alteration, resulting in high-quality 2D MA3Sb2I9−xClx films. According to this technology, Sb-based PSCs attain 3.34% PCE and preserve 90% of their starting efficiency when held at ambient temperatures for nearly two months. Furthermore, semi-transparent Sb-based PSCs effectively achieved visible transparencies in the range of 42–23% and efficiencies in the range of 2.62–3.06%, indicating the significant promise of the developing Pb-free halide semiconductor for a broad range of solar applications. Singh et al. employed an indacenodithiophene-based organic acceptor (ITIC), and Cs3Sb2I9/ITIC heterostructure showed panchromatic absorption in an inverted structure, which resulted in 3.25% PCE. Additionally, a PCE of 9.2% was attained under indoor illumination for the optimized Cs3Sb2I9/ITIC heterostructure-based solar cell, demonstrating the device's potential for usage in indoor applications. This improved performance, with a complementary absorption method, indicates a new route for producing Pb-free perovskite derivatives for solar cell applications. Similarly, Wang et al. also used a heterostructure comprising an organic dye and the double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6, which yielded an efficiency of 4.23%. These current works suggested that these Bi and Sb-based perovskite can have a future by making a heterostructure with an organic dye and, thus, can be a suitable choice for future tandem solar cells. A brief review of all the highest efficiencies achieved so far is provided in Fig. 2a.


Among commonly studied Pb substitutions such as Sn, Ge, Sb, Bi, Cu, etc., Sn has evolved as the most promising element to replace Pb in the last few years. Sn (i.e., member of group-14 element) have the same ns2 np2 outer shell electronic configuration, similar coordination type, and comparable ionic radius as of Pb (1.35 Å for Sn2+ and 1.49 Å for Pb2+). Sn can form a traditional perovskite structure with the corner-sharing [SnX6] octahedra and the A-cations resides at the eight corners of the cubic units. Therefore, similar to Pb, Sn-based perovskites possess superior optoelectronic properties as compared to other perovskites based on Ge, Bi, Sb, Cu, etc. Moreover, compared to Pb-based perovskites, Sn perovskites have a narrower optical band gap (∼1.3 eV) and higher charge carrier mobility. So, higher short circuit current density (Jsc) can be generated in Sn-based perovskites advancing towards the theoretical efficiency limit (Shockley–Queisser limit). Therefore, Sn-based perovskites are a very promising alternative to Pb-based perovskites in view of solving the toxicity issue. However, there are some issues related to the Sn-based perovskites such as fast crystallization, easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and high defect formation, which need to be tackled.


Although the MASnI3 was synthesized in the 1970s, this Pb-free perovskite was first applied in a PSC in 2014. The crystal structure of MASnI3 reveals a tetragonal α-phase at room temperature with P4mm symmetry (Fig. 2b and c). Other phases of MASnI3 are also possible such as tetragonal β-phase with I4cm symmetry and orthorhombic γ-phase with Pbnm symmetry, which are formed at low temperatures. The unit cell of α-phase MASnI3 has a lattice parameter in the range of ∼6.231–6.243 Å. Different values of hole mobility (50–200 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole concentration (1017 to 1019 cm3) have been observed for MASnI3 materials based on their fabrication processes such as hydroiodic (HI) solution-based method or solid-state method. A low concentration of charge (1 × 1014 cm−3) with a conductivity of ∼5 × 10−2 S cm−1, a high mobility of electrons (up to 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1) was observed for the MASnI3 prepared using HI solution approach. MASnI3 has a narrower band gap of ∼1.3 eV as compared to the MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV). A narrower band gap is beneficial for high efficiency single-junction solar cells as it covers a broader absorption spectrum. In addition, similar to MAPbI3, the band gap of MASnI3 can also be tuned by using different halides with a band gap range of 1.3 eV for MASnI3 to 2.15 eV for MASnBr3 (Fig. 2d). Fluorescence quenching measurements revealed a hole diffusion length of 193 ± 46 nm and an electron diffusion length of 279 ± 88 nm for the MASnI3 perovskite film. MASnI3 has excellent optoelectronic properties enabling its use in devices such as photodetectors and solar cells.

The first use of MASnI3 in a mesoporous device structure resulted in an encouraging PCE of 6.4% in the year 2014. The first application of MASnI3 as a photoactive layer in inverted PSCs was demonstrated by Yan et al., and a PCE of 1.7% was only achieved. The effect of SnF2 additive on optical response and photocarrier dynamics of MASnI3 thin film and solar cell devices was studied by Handa et al. The film prepared with SnF2 showed a red-shift in the absorption, but no change in photoluminescence (PL) peak energies was observed. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement revealed that the photo-carrier lifetime of the perovskite films increased by one order of magnitude after SnF2 addition. The PCE of 1.94% was achieved after SnF2 addition in the conventional device configuration. Fujihara et al. developed a method to fabricate flat MASnI3 film with high coverage. A solvent bathing (SB) method was applied to control the crystallization of perovskite film. The solar cell devices fabricated with the SB technique at low temperature (13 °C) and mixed antisolvent (toluene and hexane) resulted in a PCE of 2.14 ± 0.35%. It was concluded that the achieved efficiency is not very high as the films had a small grain size, and it is expected that a large grain size could produce highly efficient and stable PSCs. Another report presented the suppression of Sn4+ formation through the introduction of hydrazine vapor as a reducing agent during film formation. The reducing vapor process leads to a reduction of the Sn4+/Sn2+ ratio by more than 20%, suppressing the carrier recombination significantly, and hence a PCE of 3.89% was achieved with the MASnI3. Similarly, instead of using hydrazine vapor, hydrazinium (HA) ions were directly added to the precursor solution. The HA ions partially replaced the MA ions in MASnI3 and the optimal HA0.2MA0.8SnI3 composition resulted in a PCE of 2.6% in inverted planar junction PSCs. In addition, under an inert atmosphere, the stability was much superior with respect to light exposure. Motivated by the above reports, Li et al. developed a cation displacement approach with a two-step coating process for the deposition of MASnI3 film having low background carrier density. First, a hydrazinium tin iodide layer was deposited, which was then transformed into MASnI3 using a methylamine atmosphere through an organic cation displacement approach. Following this method, a dense and smooth film was formed with high crystallinity and large grains (micrometre size). Also, due to the presence of hydrazine generated during the cation exchange, the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ was effectively suppressed. This route resulted in an efficient mesoporous heterojunction solar cell with PCE of 7.13%. Wang et al. developed a strategy for the fabrication of good quality MASn3 film via an ion exchange/insertion reaction between solid-state SnF2 and gaseous MAI. First, PEDOT:PSS solution containing SnF2 was coated on the substrate followed by treatment with MAI vapor to get the perovskite film. A high-quality perovskite film was formed, and the detrimental oxidation of Sn2+ was suppressed owing to the presence of a large amount of remaining SnF2. A high PCE of 7.78% was realized with high reproducibility and good stability. Although many efforts have been made for the development of high-efficiency MASnI3 solar cells, their PCE is still lower than that of other organic cations-based Sn perovskites. This can be attributed to their fast oxidization in air. A summary of recently developed Sn-perovskite based solar cell devices is given in Table 1.

The most common approach to improve the performance of Sn-based PSCs is the replacement of MA with FA cation. The crystal structure of FASnI3 is mainly found as either orthorhombic Amm2 or cubic Pm3m structure. The lattice parameters of cubic FASnI3 are ∼6.3290(9) Å and it exhibits a stable structure at room temperature (Fig. 2e and f). It has a moderate band gap of ∼1.4 eV, which is wider than MASnI3 and narrower than MAPbI3 (Fig. 2g). It is observed that all the high efficiency Sn-based PSCs consist of FASnI3 due to its high stability compared to MASnI3. Recent report on the FASnI3 and MASnI3 bulk single crystals revealed that they are n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively having very low trap density (1011 cm−3). Moreover, better air stability and tolerance against O2 were observed in the case of FASnI3 single crystals. The probability of Sn2+ oxidation greatly reduces by replacement of MA with FA in MASnI3. Although it is not clear that what is the origins of the relative stability, it might be possible that it is related to the thermodynamic stability of the respective oxidized products (MA2SnI6 and FA2SnI6). FA2SnI6 being more stable than the MA2SnI6 owing to the larger separation of the discrete [SnI6]2− octahedra. The role of FA and MA cations on the defect physics of Sn halide perovskites was studied using DFT calculations. It was revealed that the antibonding overlap between Sn 5s and I 5p orbitals of FASnI3 is evidently weaker than MASnI3 as the size of FA is larger, leading to higher formation energies of Sn vacancies in FASnI3. Therefore, the better performance and stability of FASnI3 based PSCs compared to that of MASnI3 is clearly evident from the above results.

Similar to other perovskites, the band gap of FASnI3 can also be tuned by the use of different halides compositions such as FASnI2Br has a band gap of 1.68 eV and FASnBr3 has a band gap of 2.4 eV. In addition, the substitution of I with Br in FASnI3 reduces the carrier density considerably owing to the reduced Sn vacancies. Moreover, the decreased defect concentration of Sn vacancies enhances the charge lifetime and improves the performance of Sn-based PSCs. The thermal stability of FASnI3 is similar to MASnI3 but its conductivity is lower. However, depending on the growth conditions, the conductivity behaviour of FASnI3 can be regulated to have a p-type to intrinsic nature, unlike MAPbI3, which exhibits p-type behaviour only. The charge carrier density and the charge carrier mobility of FASnI3 are ∼8 × 1017 cm−3 and ∼22 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, FASnI3 shows an Auger rate lower than Pb-based perovskite and exhibits strong bimolecular recombination behaviour. These properties make FASnI3 an excellent absorber material for Pb-free Sn-based PSCs.
The first application of FASnI3 as the absorber layer in Sn-based PSCs employed a mesoporous device configuration, and a PCE of 2.1% was achieved. The first use of FASnI3 in an inverted device was accomplished by Yan and co-workers, when a PCE of 6.22% was achieved following the solvent-engineering method. Similar to MASnI3, the performance of FASnI3 was also improved using hydrazinium additive. Kayesh et al. presented an additive approach by utilizing hydrazinium chloride (N2H5Cl) along with SnF2 in a single precursor solvent as an additive for the fabrication of FASnI3 perovskite film. This resulted in the reduction of Sn4+ formation by 20%, resulting in a high coverage perovskite film with suppressed carrier recombination. These remarkable improvements resulted in a PCE of 5.4%, which was attributed mainly to a substantial enhancement in the open circuit voltage (Voc). In addition, the best PSC retained 65% of its initial PCE after a shelf-life of 1000 h without any encapsulation. A sequential 2-step deposition process was developed by Zhu et al. for the formation of compact and dense FASnI3 film having a large crystalline domain (>1 μm). The SnI2 films were first fabricated with the help of trimethylamine (TMA) as an additive along with SnF2 in the SnI2 precursor solution. The polar TMA, a Lewis base, formed SnY2-TMA complexes (Y = I−, F−) which retarded the fast reaction between FAI and SnI2, thereby modulating the process of crystallization and allowing homogenous dispersion of SnF2 for preventing its segregation. Then the dense and compact FASnI3 perovskite film was formed through ion exchange with FA+ ions. As a result, a high PCE value of 4.34% was obtained in conventional n-i-p configuration and 7.09% for inverted p-i-n configuration. To tackle the issue of fast crystallization in FASnI3 perovskite, Meng et al. introduced hydrogen bonding to retard the crystallization rate of the FASnI3 perovskite. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was added in the perovskite precursor solution, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement confirmed the strong O–H⋯I− hydrogen bonding interactions between PVA and FASnI3. The hydrogen bonding interaction retarded the crystal growth, introduced nucleation sites, and directed the crystal orientation; as a result, the trap state was reduced, and the iodide ion migration was suppressed. Finally, a PCE of 8.92% and Voc of 0.63 V were achieved in an inverted device configuration. Moreover, striking long-term stability was observed with no decay in the PCE after 400 h of operation at the maximum power point. Wang et al. proposed a self-repairing perovskite solar cell formation and achieved a high PCE of 11.4% for FASnI3 perovskite in an inverted device configuration. Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) additive containing large reductive cation was introduced into FASnI3 films, which passivated the defects and improved stability. The presence of PHCl reduced the existing Sn4+ and prevented the degradation of FASnI3. The FASnI3 film developed with 5.0% of PHCl as an additive has a longer carrier lifetime (∼3 times) and higher built-in voltage (∼3.5 times) compared to the control film without PHCl. The PHCl showed a self-repairing and trap state passivation behaviour, and therefore, the solar cell device without encapsulation exhibited the best stability among Sn-based PSCs, showing no degradation when stored in a glove box for over 110 days. Interestingly, the device exhibited astounding efficiency recovery after being exposed to an oxygen-containing environment for 10 days. Recently, Chang et al. introduced a method of regulating the growth of perovskite grains to fabricate uniform and full coverage perovskite films with lower defect density. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is an eco-friendly polymer, was introduced in a FASnI3 precursor to control the crystallization process. PEG has plenty of ether bond groups (C–O–C) which have hydrogen bonding interaction with FA+ as well as forms Lewis acid–base complexation with undercoordinated Sn leading to regulating the crystallization behaviour, improving perovskite film quality, and reducing defect density. The PEG polymer scaffold crosslinks the adjacent perovskite grain during the annealing process and reduces the stress between grains. Therefore, using this method, a PCE of 7.53% was obtained in inverted device configuration along with improved device stability. The unencapsulated device could retain 90% of its initial PCE, when stored for 720 h in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.

The crystal structure of perovskite can be stabilized through compositional engineering of A-site cations. The use of mixed A-site cations to improve the performance and stability in Pb-based perovskites has been successfully achieved. In fact, most of the high-efficiency solar cell devices are based on mixed cation 3D perovskites, such as the well-known triple cation perovskite with Cs, MA, and FA at the A-site. Following this, different Sn-based perovskites have been developed with mixed A-cations and used in solar cell devices.

An inverted solar cell fabricated with MA0.9Cs0.1SnI3 as a photoactive layer was developed by Liu et al., and a PCE of 0.33% with a Voc of 0.20 V, FF of 36.4% and Jsc of 4.53 mA cm−2 was observed. When the ratio of FA and MA in (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3 was changed, it affected the crystallization and absorption behaviour of the perovskite film. The resulting perovskite film exhibited a band gap between ∼1.26–1.36 eV. In the optimum composition of (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3, a highly improved morphology of perovskite film was observed, leading to reduced charge recombination in the PSCs and hence a PCE of 8.12% with a notable Voc of 0.61 V. The PCE of (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3 was further enhanced to 9.06% through the utilization of chlorobenzene as an antisolvent. Furthermore, tin(0) nanoparticles were used to modify the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite, and a PCE of 9.9% was achieved by scavenging tin(IV) impurities which have been found detrimental to device performance (Fig. 3a). But the maximum Voc achieved (0.63 V) was still lower than expected, considering 1.36 eV band gap for FA0.75MA0.25SnI3, which was attributed to the recombination at the interfaces. So, EDA was used to treat the perovskite surface and to promote ohmic contacts, a thin layer of PCBM was inserted. As a result, the PCE was improved to 11.5%, with Voc = 0.76 V, Jsc = 22.0 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.69 (Fig. 3b).

Similar to Pb-based perovskites, two-dimensional (2D) Sn perovskites with Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) structure with a general formula of (RNH3)2An−1SnnX3n+1 are having better moisture resistance and stability compared to their 3D counterparts. The ammonium cation (RNH3) can be either an aliphatic or aromatic structure. The RP perovskite structure has a 2D network of corner-sharing [SnX6]4− octahedral between the organic spacer layers. The first report on 2D Sn-based perovskite solar cell was based on (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 absorber layer, and a PCE of 2.53% was obtained (for n = 4) in the conventional device structure. Depending on the layer numbers (value of n), the band gap of (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 ranged between 1.83 to 1.20 eV. The first report on 2D Sn-based perovskite fabricated in an inverted device configuration in 2017, when PEA was used as the spacer cation along with FA to achieve highly oriented tin halide perovskite films (Fig. 3c–e). The (PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28 2D perovskite resulted in a PCE of 5.94% and enhanced stability. The improved stability was achieved due to the superior oxidation resistance of 2D Sn perovskite owing to their improved thermodynamic stability. Additionally, the formation of compact perovskite film and encapsulating nature of organic PEA ligands also protected Sn2+ from contact with oxygen. Xu et al. developed a quasi-2D perovskite using 5-ammonium valeric acid as a spacer. In addition, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was used as an additive resulting in a highly oriented and vertically aligned tin-based quasi-2D perovskite films. The highly ordered vertical orientation facilitated the charge collection between electrodes. The solar cell device with AVA2FA4Sn5I16 as quasi 2D perovskite layer and optimum concentration of NH4Cl additive resulted in a PCE of 8.71% in inverted device configuration. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices showed an N2 shelf life of 400 h (retaining ∼90% of initial PCE after 400 h), and ambient air shelf life of unencapsulated device under air with RH of 50% and temperature of 25 °C for 100 min (retaining ∼65% PCE after 100 min).


CsSnCl3 nanocrystals adopt the cubic perovskite phase (Pm3m) unlike the orthorhombic phase of CsPbX3, whereas CsSnX3 having bromide or iodide ions results in a lower symmetry orthorhombic phase (Pnma), as demonstrated in Fig. 4a–c. There is a need for more research because some reports imply that quantum rods of CsSnBr3 also belong to the cubic system, contradicting the earlier observations. Also, the substitution of Sn ions in place of Pb in CsPbI3 results in CsSnI3 perovskites that form different polymorphs. Four polymorphs of CsSnI3 are present: a one dimensional double-chain configuration having yellow colour (Y); a three dimensional configuration having black colour (B-γ); a black cubic perovskite phase (B-α) obtained after the Y phase undergoes heat treatment over 425 K; a black tetragonal phase (B-β) following the cooling of the B-β phase up to 351 K. CsSnI3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic Pnma space group in a deformed 3D perovskite structure at room temperature. The black orthorhombic phase of CsSnI3 perovskite is a semiconductor exhibiting direct band gap.

The γ-CsSnI3 phase has a band gap of 1.3 eV. Further, like CsPbX3 perovskites where X = I, Br, Cl; CsSnX3 perovskites' band gap could be adjusted via altering X components. CsSnX3 exhibits a variable band gap that ranges from 1.3 eV to 1.75 eV. For the same composition, it has been found that the band gap decreases with increasing crystal ordering from orthorhombic > tetragonal > cubic. In the case of Cs cations, the magnitude of the differences is typically large (CsSnI3 with a difference of 0.52 eV (cubic vs. orthorhombic)). The density-functional theory (DFT) with GW correction method was also used to predict the small band gap value of CsSnI3 in a cubic configuration. This is probably related to the reason that the influence of Cs on the crystal structure is very less, thus retaining the perfect cubic configuration. Generally, an increase in bandgap was observed as B and X ions get changed, such as Pb to Sn and from I to Br to Cl, due to the increase in electronegativity.
The physical characteristics of a compound highly depend on the band gap that exists in the DOS (density of states). Thus, it becomes an essential parameter for the development of magneto-optic, optoelectronic, as well as magneto-electronic devices. The DOS graphs depend on the orbitals that are contributing near the band edges and the overall contribution of the states. In the case of CsSnI3, I-p-states are significant near the band edges in the valence band and Sn-p-states are significant near the conduction band. The overall contributions in band gap are generally Cs-p and I-s-states in the valence band and Cs-d in the conduction band. Considering the state's contributions of CsSnBr3, Br-p and Sn-p-orbitals play a major role in band gap formation, whereas the overall contribution of states in the VB is of Cs-p, Br-s and in the CB is of Cs-d-orbitals. The γ-CsSnI3 has large optical absorption coefficient (104 cm−1) as well as a low exciton binding energy (18 meV) that makes CsSnI3 highly suitable for PSCs. In addition, a CsSnI3 structure with deficiency of Sn results in an efficient p-type conductor having carrier concentration of ∼1017 cm−3 along with hole mobility of ∼585 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Owing to these properties, Chung et al. employed CsSnI3 as a gel electrolyte for the first time in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It was prepared via a vacuum melt technique at 450 °C, and it was observed that with high photocurrent, the achieved a PCE was 10.2%. It was found that CsSnI3 exhibits good absorption of light over a wide range of wavelengths as well as is capable of converting absorbed light into photocurrent. PSCs employing an active layer of CsSnI3 in a device having configuration FTO/mp-TiO2/CsSnI3/HTL/Au was first reported by Kumar et al. Single-step solution technique as well as a low annealing temperature (70 °C) was used for the formation of the perovskite layer. Further, SnF2 was included to lessen the amount of inherent defects linked to Sn vacancies that cause CsSnI3 perovskites to have good background carrier concentrations as well as significant charge recombination. The introduction of SnF2 decreased Sn vacancies without affecting the CsSnI3 lattice configuration. Also, with the addition of SnF2 (20%), the photovoltaic performance was significantly improved showing PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF of 2.02%, 22.70 mA cm−2, 0.24 V and 0.37, respectively but, it was believed that trap-assisted recombination, instead of any considerable energy barrier in the device, were responsible for the low photovoltaic performance. SnF2 must be added to CsSnI3 in order to minimize Sn vacancies as well as enhance the resistance of the film, which improves the overall performance of the device as pristine CsSnI3 is too conductive for solar cell absorbers. The performance of CsSnI3 PSCs is constrained by the low film quality, large Sn vacancies, and less knowledge about the properties of CsSnI3 perovskites. To alleviate these problems, Wang et al. reported a straightforward solution-based procedure in which a mixture of multiple solvents, including acetonitrile, DMF, and methoxyactonitrile was used to dissolve CsSnI3. Additionally, different post-annealing temperatures were employed to regulate Sn vacancies and film quality. An increase in grain size was found as a result of increased post-annealing temperature, and the grains were coarsened at 250 °C.
Mesoporous scaffolds (Al2O3 or TiO2), p-i-n and n-i-p planar PSCs, as well as other device architectures, were developed, and tested. The mesoporous PSCs show very low PCE values (0.3% for Al2O3 and 0% for TiO2), which may have been caused by the following factors: (i) incomplete filling of pores; (ii) a restricted crystallization in the mesoporous scaffolds; as well as (iii) low crystallinity impurity (Cs2SnI6 and γ-CsSnI3). These problems were resolved by creating a planar device having configuration ITO/c-TiO2/CsSnI3/spiro-MeOTAD, which resulted in an increased PCE (0.77%).
On the other hand, because of the poor conductivity of undoped spiro-MeOTAD that results in low hole conductivity as well as low carrier transportation, the device performance was still subpar. To prevent γ-CsSnI3 from getting degrade due to oxidation steps that occur while doping spiro-MeOTAD, the spiro-MeOTAD was left undoped in this experiment. To circumvent the difficulties associated with the usage of spiro-MeOTAD in γ-CsSnI3-based PSCs, NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL) was utilized, which considerably raised the PCE up to 3%. Further, the device performance was greatly influenced by the annealing temperature; a temperature of 150 °C was ideal for creating a smooth surface as well as homogeneous crystals that ultimately enhanced device performance. Larger crystals were formed by annealing at higher temperatures, but this also increases the Sn vacancies as well as film roughness that reduces the carrier lifespan and degrades the interfacial contact.
The stability and overall performance of CsSnI3-based PSCs are limited by the oxidation susceptibility of Sn-based perovskites, the low energy of defect formation in addition to the challenges in fabricating films that are free from pinholes. Marshall et al. thoroughly investigated the effects of adding tin halides, such as SnI2, SnBr2, SnCl2, and SnF2, to CsSnI3 in order to overcome these difficulties. An excessive amount of SnI2 was firstly incorporated into CsSnI3 precursor solutions, and then its impact on the structure of the CsSnI3 film as well as on the overall performance of the device was examined. An improvement in the PCE of CsSnI3 PSCs was observed with the addition of 10% SnI2. Since there are less Sn vacancies in the Sn-rich perovskite films, it has been suggested that this will suppress carrier recombination, which would be a viable mechanism for improvement in PCE. Consequently, by employing CuI as HTL and ICBA (Indene-C60 Bisadduct) as ETL, a PCE and Voc of 2.76% and 0.55 V, respectively were accomplished. It was observed that SnBr2 and SnF2 were two Sn halide additions that led to PSCs with subpar device efficiency (PCE of 0.4%), whereas the performance of CsSnI3 perovskite films was significantly impacted by SnCl2 addition. The CsSnI3 perovskite film's morphology was not improved by the addition of SnCl2 (pinholes were still present as in the case of SnI2, SnBr2, and SnF2 additions), but the poor morphology seems to have a negligible effect on the photovoltaic performance.
Further investigation revealed that a SnCl2 layer rather than CsSnCl3 or CsSnI3−xClx was produced on CsSnI3 film. This may have happened as a result of the significant discrepancy between the ionic radii of I (2.2 Å) and Cl (1.81 Å). Such layer of SnCl2 was forfeited in order to create a stable hydrate and SnO2 which shielded the CsSnI3 layer from oxidation when exposed to air. This study added support to the theory that excess SnCl2 at the CsSnI3 crystallite surface led to moderate n-doping of the fullerene layer and the generation of a Schottky barrier that inhibits unintentional electron extraction from the fullerene into the ITO at the pinholes. Thus, with no electron blocking layer, the PCE of the CsSnI3 device improved to 3.56% as well as the carrier recombination at the exposed ITO sites was markedly decreased. Additionally, in ambient atmosphere, the SnCl2 layer improved the stability of the unencapsulated CsSnI3 PSC device evaluated at a humidity of around 25% under a constant 1 sun simulated solar simulation. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of CsSnI3 PSCs before and after a period of extended storage under N2 are shown in Fig. 4d and e, respectively. The stability of such devices is the maximum for any Sn halide PSCs: on average PCE decreased to 70% of its initial value only after ∼7 hours under continuous 1 sun illumination in ambient air, with the best performing devices taking 16 hours to reduce to the same value.
When the band gap of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) is increased, their Voc is also enhanced by replacing I with Br. In their study of CsSnBr3 PSCs, Gupta et al. used mp-TiO2 as ETL and spiro-MeOTAD as HTL to create the perovskite absorber layer via a single step solution technique. Additionally, the impacts of SnF2 inclusion on the characteristics of the CsSnBr3 film as well as on the performance of PSC was scrutinized. The incorporation of SnF2 decreased the background carrier density by neutralising the carrier traps caused by Sn vacancies and decreasing the work function of CsPbBr3. Also, the incorporation of SnF2 decreased the background carrier density and enabled carrier transportation at the interfaces by bringing the CB energy closer to ETL and VB energies to HTL, and the resultant PCE rising from 0.01% to 2.1%.
The UPS VB study of CsSnBr3 was performed with and without SnF2 to scrutinize the effect of SnF2 on the energy levels of the compound. In comparison to pure CsSnBr3 (WF = 4.62 eV and EVBM = 6.33 eV), the inclusion of SnF2 lowers the work function (WF) and the ionisation potential (VB maximum, EVBM) of CsSnBr3 (WF = 4.52 eV and EVBM = 6.1 eV). This slightly reduces the significant voltage loss at the HTM/HaP interface in comparison to pure CsSnBr3 and moves the VBM of the perovskite with SnF2 near the HOMO level of the HTM, spiro (5.0 eV). The WF and EVBM energies of CsSnBr3 did not significantly alter when SnF2 concentration was varied between 5 and 80 wt% in comparison to CsSnBr3 with 20 wt% SnF2. Additionally, it was observed that CsSnBr3 (containing 20 mol% SnF2) provided the optimum performance. Further, considering that the band energies do not vary due to the formation of interfaces, the CB minimum (CBM, computed from the EVBM and the optical band gap, omitting exciton binding energy) for CsSnBr3 (with and without SnF2) may be calculated. This demonstrates a substantial electron injection barrier among the perovskite and the CB minimum of the titanium dioxide layer (0.48 eV for the pure CsSnBr3 and a smaller barrier of 0.25 eV for the electrode formed with SnF2). If viewed superficially, this barrier might prevent the perovskite from injecting electrons into the titanium dioxide.
Additionally, the inclusion of SnF2 without any encapsulation inhibited the oxidation of Sn from X-ray radiations as well as boosted the perovskite's stability in an inert atmosphere. A large amount of SnF2 or SnCl2 added to CsSnX3 in order to restrict the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ resulted in poor film morphology, which reduces efficiency. By spin coating CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 precursors in an environment containing hydrazine (N2H4) reducing vapour, Song et al. created an innovative and efficient way to address this issue. The carrier recombination caused due to the unfavourable p-type conductivity of Sn vacancies was significantly decreased by the suggested reaction path in the reducing atmosphere at the time of film production. Consequently, the obtained PCE values for the PSCs based on CsSnI3 and CsSnBr3 were 1.83% and 3.04%, respectively. Further, they investigated that a large amount of SnI2 was immersed in the perovskite film under a reducing environment of N2H4 instead of using SnF2 to minimize the Sn vacancies. By balancing the Sn 2p vacancies, the extra SnI2 results in reduced p-type conductivity. The CsSnI3 PSCs, which were formed using this method, had an ideal concentration of 0.4 M CsI and 1.0 M SnI2, exhibiting the maximum efficiency of 4.81%. Further, as reported in the literature, different ETLs and HTLs used with Sn-based Pb-free perovskites (CsSnX3) are illustrated in Fig. 4f. Also, Table 2 demonstrates various PV parameters of the solar cells based on different device configurations of Pb-free Sn-based perovskite absorbers.

Lately, various molecules have been used as additives in CsSnX3 based perovskites to improve the efficiency and stability of solar cells. It has been established that the usage of the molecules alone or as co-additive suppresses the conversion of Sn2+ to Sn4+. The first such reports displayed a PCE of 3.83% when piperazine was used as co-additive along with SnF2. Here, the addition of piperazine increased the electron donor tendency which further lowered the chances of short-circuit in the device. The additive incorporated CsSnI3 based photovoltaic displayed a PCE of 3.83%. Later, the electron donor nature of the additive molecule was studied through change in the Fermi level of the CsSnI3 perovskite by Zhang et al. The effect of varying concentrations of cobaltocene molecules in the perovskite precursor solution was checked, and the highest PCE of 3.0% was obtained for optimum concentration of the additive, while the pristine device showed only 0.65%. Further, it was also developed that the additive 2-aminopyrazine formed a complex with co-additive SnF2 that hindered the oxidation of Sn2+. This resulted in enhanced PCE of 5.12% and improved stability of the co-additive modified solar cell devices. The first major breakthrough in CsSnI3 based PSC was the incorporation of phthalimide as an additive by Ye et al., which showed PCE >10%. They demonstrated localized electron density engineering through trigeminal coordination interactions between phthalimide and CsSnI3 to form relatively ordered grain, stable films with low defect density. The possibility of fabricating phthalimide modified CsSnI3 based PSC was confirmed on both rigid and flexible substrates. The highest PCE of 10.1% and 9.6% was obtained on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. The stability test of the modified device was tested under inert, ambient-air, and 1 sun continuous illumination at 70 °C conditions for long periods and significant improvement was noticed. Further, air tolerant CsSnI3 perovskite has been developed by mixed B-site engineering, where a part of Sn has been replaced by Ge. Highest PCE of 7.1% was obtained for the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 perovskite which was due to the formation of ultrathin native oxide passivating layer with the presence of Ge.
In summary, the performance of Sn-based perovskites still needs to be improved. Further efforts should be dedicated towards optimization of perovskite composition and in strategically designing additives that can avoid Sn2+ oxidation. In addition, selection of efficient hole/electron transport materials and developing better encapsulation will be a viable direction in developing long-term stabile Sn-based PSCs.

A new structure known as double perovskite having general formula A2B′B′′X6 has been developed to address the complex substitution of Pb, where A is a relatively large cation (typically Cs+), B′ and B′′ are either trivalent or monovalent cations, whereas X represents either oxygen or halogen (Fig. 5a). Their derivatives comprise metallic halide octahedra BIX6 or BIIIX6 units that assign intersections among six adjacent octahedra having different ions to form the 3D lattice. Recently, halide double perovskites have achieved great popularity in the field of photovoltaics owing to their good stability and non-toxicity. Furthermore, it is expected that scrutinization of different possible combinations of B′ and B′′ in A2B′B′′X6 helps in developing efficient alternatives for Pb-based halide perovskites. Different reports suggested that the halide double perovskites have a cubic face-centred configuration that belongs to the space group Fmm and with a lattice parameter in the range of 10–12 Å. This configuration is analogous to the ABX3 perovskite, comprising of a three-dimensional network of corner connected octahedra, having Cs+ ions at the centre of the cuboctahedron interstices. In contrast to the hybrid halide perovskites in which the configuration is achieved by B2+ centred octahedron, the halide double perovskite is formed via alternating B′ and B′′ centred octahedrons in a three-dimensional framework termed as rock salt ordering.

Various types of double perovskites with a wide range of band gaps are reported, some of those are summarized as shown in. The band structures of halide double perovskites were usually described by the B(I)-, B(III)- and X-site atoms. The cation-transmutation strategy offers more degrees of freedom in choosing the B-cation elements for halide perovskites. The elements in IA, IB, and IIIA groups are suitable for the B+ sites, whereas those in IIB, IIIA, and VA are suitable for B3+ sites. Whenever any B-site element of the halide double perovskites is localized at IA or IIIA groups, the materials exhibit a direct band gap. Theoretically, there are various halide double perovskites, however, the exact formula considers two phenomena of the Goldschmidt's rule and thermodynamic stability.
Volonakis et al. fabricated a family of double perovskites and predicted a band gap of 0.5–2.7 eV and 0.0–2.6 eV corresponding to bismuth and antimony based compounds, respectively. To get an insight, the electronic structure of the most studied double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functionals with excluding and including spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was evaluated. According to the PBE non-SOC theory, an indirect band gap of 1.32 eV was calculated for Cs2AgBiBr6, while the HSE functional (standard 25 percent Hartree–Fock exchange) accounts for an indirect band gap of 1.97 eV, closer to the experimentally observed value 1.95 eV. Nevertheless, the silver and bismuth lack compatibility, leading to a wide and indirect band gap. The monovalent cation Cu+ offers the advantage of reduced band gap and thus to further understand the distribution of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs in these compounds, the partial charge densities for the CBM and VBM of various Cs2AgBiX6 compounds was estimated. The stereo-chemical lone pair of electrons on bismuth 6s orbitals stabilizes the rock-salt perovskite structure. This is the reason behind their unique electronic and optical characteristics. Also, the CBM of the chloride-based compounds is more uniform compared to bromide ones, resulting in a higher density of photo-induced electrons. To better understand the applicability of these perovskites in photovoltaic applications, information regarding the electron–hole mobility and effective mass is crucial. The Cs2CuBiBr6 compound has the smallest effective electron mass (0.35), whereas Cs2CuBiCl6 has the largest (0.47). Cs2AgBiBr6 has the smallest effective hole mass (0.35), resulting in the highest carrier mobility. The smaller the effective mass of electron and hole, the more carrier mobility. Hence, Cs2BBiBr6 (B is Ag and Cu) must have high electron mobility due to their low effective masses. The small band gap of Cs2CuBiX6 is responsible for the absorption of light.
The indirect band gap double perovskites like Cs2B(I)BiX6 and Cs2B(I)SbX6 (B(I) = Ag, Cu, Na), Cs2AgInCl6 show a direct band gap via both first-principle methods and experiments. However, Yan et al. showed the large variation among experimentally measured optical band gap of 3.2 eV and photoluminescence emission energy of 2.1 eV. It is due to the parity-forbidden transitions, owing to the centrosymmetry of double perovskite and the lowest CB. Developing novel double perovskites for optoelectronic uses also requires taking into account inversion symmetry-induced parity forbidden transitions. Inversion symmetry which is present in the crystal structure of perovskite compounds has the tendency to cause parity-forbidden transitions between CB and VB interfaces. The materials' optical absorption properties may be considerably impacted by this.Fig. 5b shows the permitted and prohibited transitions for a few halide double perovskites. As demonstrated in Fig. 5c, the Cs2AgInCl6 single crystals with the direct band gaps show parity-forbidden as well as parity-allowed transitions. The estimated band structure of Cs2AgInCl6 by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) (Fig. 5d) shows that VBM and CBM have identical even parity. Thus, there would be a parity-forbidden transition from VBM to CBM at the Γ point. The parity of the CB edge varies, whilst the VB edge does not, at k points far from Γ point. Consequently, the optical absorption coefficients of Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskites are poor. It was found that the CBM and VBM both lie at the Γ point for Cs2InBiCl6, thus exhibiting different behaviour. As demonstrated in Fig. 5e, the CBM is represented by Γ4˙− and the VBM by Γ1˙+. As a result, there is no parity-forbidden transition between CBM and VBM. At the Γ point, the estimated transition parameter shows a high value, indicating exceptional optical absorption properties.
Experimental calculations of the band gap of double perovskites show that double perovskites have a variable band gap and can be selectively varied from direct to indirect by tuning the CB and retaining the VB. Theoretical investigation of band gap structures also reveals this feature. However, most electronic transitions in double perovskites lead to an indirect band gap. The band gap values for Ag-based halide double perovskites are larger than Cu-based ones, whereas Cl-based materials have larger band gap values than the Br ones. The compound Cs2BiCuI6 and (CsFA)BiCuI6 exhibit a high dielectric constant in low energy zone (0 to 2 eV), whereas the double perovskite (FA)2BiCuI6 shows the highest dielectric function in high energy zone (2 to 4 eV). A high value of a dielectric function of (FA)2BiCuI6 for solar radiation makes it a potential material for PV applications. The absorption coefficient provides information about the light-harvesting capability of a material and defines the efficiency of corresponding solar cells. A high absorption coefficient having a peak absorption was achieved in (FA)2BiCuI6, revealing the high potential of Pb-free organic–inorganic hybrid double perovskite in solar cell application. Furthermore, the optical conductivity of double perovskites is the same for all materials except (FA)2BiCuI6. The intense peak in the conductivity spectra of (FA)2BiCuI6 demonstrates its highest optical conductivity in comparison to other materials. For reflectivity, refractive index as well as the extinction coefficient it was reported that (FA)2BiCuI6 exhibits low reflectivity and high extinction coefficient. Zhang et al. used hydrogen treatment that effectively decreased the bandgap from 2.18 eV to 1.64 eV of Cs2AgBiBr6 film. The author found atomic hydrogen treatment for 1200s doped the interstitial sites that increases the carrier mobility from 1.71 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 9.28 cm2 V−1 s−1, carrier lifetime from 18.85 ns to 41.86 ns, and the carrier concentration has also been improved from 1.42 × 1012 cm−3 to 5.96 × 1012 cm−3, respectively. These promising properties makes it highly suitable for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications like solar cells and LEDs.
A well-balanced system comprising electron and hole diffusion is crucial for achieving optimum photovoltaic performance. To improve the performance and stability of Cs2AgBiBr6 as the light-absorbing layer, ongoing efforts have been made to modify its composition, phase, and quality. Ji et al. reported the smallest bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal from 1.98 eV to 1.72 eV through controlled growth rate at a temperature of 150 °C. Wu et al. fabricated a solar cell based on Cs2AgBiBr6 through the low-pressure assisted (LPA) solution technique (Fig. 6a). The LPA method involves spin coating of Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor solution, keeping it under reduced pressure for some time, and then annealing to get perovskite film. Different annealing temperatures were tried to achieve a good quality film. Fig. 6b demonstrate the XRD patterns of different perovskite films. Solar cell devices were fabricated with n-i-p geometry and the energy level diagram of different layers used are presented in Fig. 6c. The active area of the solar cell was kept at 0.1 cm2. The Au was used as the reference electrode. The PCE attained a maximum value 1.44% (Fig. 6d black line) at 250 °C, having Voc = 1.04 V, Jsc = 1.78 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.78. Simultaneously, an HTL-free device was formed, having a PCE = 0.86% (Fig. 6d red line), Voc = 0.95 V, Jsc = 1.50 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.60. Both devices showed the hysteresis phenomenon. The stability of PCEs was measured by observing the steady-state photocurrent corresponding to the highest value of power under controlled illumination. The HTM-based solar cell exhibited a stable PCE ∼1.30% at 0.80 V, whereas the HTM-free one exhibited 0.86% at 0.75 V. The absorption and PL spectrum of Cs2AgBiBr6 film is shown in Fig. 6e and f, respectively. The absorption spectrum shows a strong absorption peak at 438 nm with a tail at 610 nm. A broad PL cantered at 615 nm was observed. The exciton binding energy of 220 meV was estimated for Cs2AgBiBr6 film which is much larger than MAPbI3 (25 meV). This is one of the probable reasons for lower efficiency of PCE of Cs2AgBiBr6 devices.
Longo et al. fabricated Cs2AgBiBr6-based thin films using sequential evaporation. The films absorb strongly up to 400 nm, corresponding to a direct band gap at 3 eV. There exists an intense peak at 440 nm, having no significant interpretation. It can either be an exciton bound at the band edge, or an intense transition among the Bi3+ s–p orbitals. Further, an n-i-p solar cell was prepared with the double-perovskite active layer by varying the film thickness. The device structure was FTO/TiO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The J–V plots of the best-performing devices for each film thickness are given in Fig. 7a. The device with 750 nm film thickness demonstrated a PCE = 1.03%, a Voc = 1.10 V, Jsc = 1.33 mA cm−2, and a FF = 0.70. This work combined experimental and theoretical studies on the factor affecting the performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells. By studying the thickness of the solar cells, it was pointed out that the Jsc is not dependent on the absorber thickness. This result was further analysed by the EQE spectrum by illuminating the front and back of the cell, leading to the conclusion that the perovskite has extremely small and large electron and hole diffusion lengths, respectively (Fig. 7b–d). The small electron diffusion length may be due to the energy disorder and highly dense electron traps. All these results help in interpreting the drawbacks of double perovskites for solar cell applications and improve their performances.
In another example, a Cs2AgBiBr6-based solar cell was formed on a methyl trans-32-carboxy-pyropheophorbide-a (C-Chl)-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) ETL. The structure of C-Chl is shown in Fig. 7e inset. C-Chl acts as a photosensitizer due to its carboxyl group at the C32 position on the tetrapyrrole ring leading to adsorption of C-Chl onto the m-TiO2. The C-Chl modified the absorption spectrum of these solar cells by increasing it to 750 nm, resulting in an increase in the photocurrent density and a comparatively high PCE = 3.11%. Fig. 7e shows the J–V curves for the Cs2AgBiBr6 PSCs derived using pristine and C-Chl-sensitized m-TiO2. The improved efficiency is primarily because of the enhanced Jsc upon the additional optical absorption because of C-Chl. An increase in electron extraction efficiencies, reduction in charge recombination, and suppression in defects were also observed. Besides, restrained hysteresis and enhanced stability were also seen. Their device has a mesoporous structure and the device configuration is illustrated in (Fig. 7f). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device revealed that the thicknesses of c-TiO2, HTL, silver electrode are 40, 80, and 45 nm, respectively, and the total thickness of m-TiO2/C-Chl/Cs2AgBiBr6 is 430 nm. The Tauc plot of a Cs2AgBiBr6 film shows that phonon-assisted energies of 2.32 and 1.87 eV emerged from the emission and absorption of a phonon (Fig. 7g), leading to the average value of 2.09 eV assigned to the indirect band gap. Recently, Cs2AgBiBr6 inorganic double PSCs efficiency has been increased to 6.37% by atomic hydrogen treatment that adjusted its valence band and conduction band energy levels.
Various groups investigated the lead-free double perovskite structures for solar cell applications. For synthesizing thin films of Cs2AgBiBr6, Igbari et al. utilized solution-processed and vacuum sublimation techniques. In solution-processed approach, Cs2AgBiBr6 was synthesized separately via the solvothermal method and spin-coated onto the TiO2 layer. Photo conversion efficacy of 2.51% and the current density of 3.82 mA cm−2 were reported by using this technique. In vacuum sublimation to obtain a film of Cs2AgBiBr6, multiple cycles of deposition of AgBr, CsBr, and BiBr3 onto the TiO2 layer were done in vacuum followed by heat treatment up to the desired temperature. This approach of fabricating film resulted in a PCE of 1.41% and the current density of 2.06 mA cm−2. These results confirm the suitability of double perovskite as an absorber for solar cell application as well as the importance of the solution-processed technique.
Mohandes et al. reported a Cs2AgBiBr6 based perovskite solar cell by employing SnO2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL. In addition, they also investigated Cu2O as HTL and got a highest PCE of 11.32%. Islam et al. executed more research on Cs2AgBiBr6 utilizing Cu2O as the HTL and achieved PCE of 11.17%. Further, Wang et al. reported Zn-chlorophyll hole transporter-sensitized lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 PSCs and obtained PCE of 2.79%. Additionally, Igbari et al. studied the composition stoichiometry of Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs and achieved PCE of 2.51%. Ou et al. investigated Zn doping in Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite solar cells and observed an increase in PCE by 45.9% with Zn inclusion. The highest PCE of 2.16% was obtained. The PCE for single-junction perovskite solar cells is substantially lower than the recorded 25.6% PCE, as per the literature report. As a result, there is a great deal of room for improvement in the Cs2AgBiBr6-based perovskite solar cell's efficiency. Since NiO displays greater PCE and QE in the device, it is also chosen as the HTL.
Pantaler et al. investigated various HTLs with different HOMO and LUMO values to improve the PCEs of Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs. It was observed that the device with poly[bis(4-phenyl)-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as the HTL exhibits the maximum PCE of 1.26% without any hysteresis. In addition to these traditional HTLs, photoactive HTLs, for instance, Zn-chlorophyll, were also scrutinized, which not only transferred holes but also sensitized the perovskite material. Additionally, dual interfacial engineering by incorporating C60 and poly[(5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)(6-fluoro2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)(4,4 dihexadecyl4Hcyclopenta [2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)] (PCDTFBT) to modify the interface of the ETL and HTL, respectively, was reported in Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs, and the PCE of such device shows an increment from 0.93% to 1.57%. In Cs2AgBiBr6 films, surface imperfections play an imperative role. Surface passivation is a viable tactic to reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance the PCEs of Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs. The PCEs and stability of Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs can be improved by introducing a suitable material to optimize the energy level alignment since the interfacial energy level alignment is essential to charge carrier extraction and transfer.

The chemistry of metal halides has transformed dramatically during the past few years, leading to the emergence of halide PSC absorbers. Among this class, the double perovskite of type A2BX6 is formed by various compounds. Its structure is similar to cubic like in ABX3 type perovskite but with 50% vacant cation B sites in ABX3 structure, and the remaining cations at the B-site yield a face-centred cubic (fcc) structure. Henceforth, the BX6 octahedra in the structure of A2BX6 are not linked through secondary B–X linking; wherein all negative ions are linked to a single B cation respectively. In this arrangement, an additional degree of freedom can be seen compared to other perovskites, represented in the form of a crystallographic X-coordinate of the negative ion site. An important characteristic of this structure is that it can have a variety of compositions, from fluorides to iodides, such that there is no static tilting or change in symmetry. Its structure consists of a [BX6]2− octahedra and monovalent cations at the A-site to ensure charge neutrality. Certain cubic A2BX6 compounds exhibit good electrical conductivity and charge transport properties, demonstrating their potential as PSC absorbers. Hence, the knowledge about the cubic A2BX6 will open new possibilities for building functional materials. Certain examples of this type of double perovskites are K2PtI6, Rb2PtI6, Cs2PtI6, Cs2PdI6, Rb2SnI6, Cs2SnI6, Cs2TiX6, Cs2ZrX6 and Cs2TeI6.

There are multiple ways of obtaining the lattice structure (A is Rb/Cs; B is Sn/Pd/Pt, and X is Cl/Br/I). They have an fcc arrangement and belong to the Fmm space group. Twelve and six X (halogen) ions surround an A and B cation, respectively. B is at the centre of octahedra, formed by B–X bonds. All BX6 octahedra are present at the centre of a cube, occupying the corner and the face centre sites. The octahedra are independent and form a 12-fold coordinated surrounding for all halogen ions. The A2BX6 structure can also be derived from the ABX3 structure after removing one-half B cations of the [BX6] cluster centre. To maintain charge neutrality, cation B must be tetravalent. Alternatively, if a vacancy is created at the cation B-site of the double perovskite A2B1+B3+X6, an A2BX6 double perovskite is formed (Fig. 8a–c). Generally, A2BX6 is represented by a [BX6]2− octahedron connected through the ions A. The lattice structure of most A2BX6 perovskites is cubic and quite similar to ABX3 perovskites. If every alternate [BX6]2− octahedra is made to vanish viz one-half cation B-site is empty in A2BX6 structure, then the packing is identical to ABX3.
In this section, the electronic structure of some compounds of A2BX6 perovskites has been discussed. Among these compounds, the Rb2PdI6 perovskite exhibits the lowest band gap value of 0.47eV and Cs2PtCl6 has the highest value of 2.91 eV. Rb2SnBr6 and Rb2SnI6 are Sn-based double perovskites behaving as direct band gap semiconductors. The band gap of Rb2SnBr6 is 2.42 eV and Rb2SnI6 is 0.84 eV. The band gap of Rb2SnI6 gets reduced by 0.16 eV upon considering SOC, while Rb2SnBr6 shows no significant change. Based on DFT and SOC calculations, the iodine-based compound exhibits a direct band gap of 1.13 eV (tetragonal phase) and 1.32 eV (monoclinic phase). In such compounds, the VB is formed of Sn-5s and X-5p orbitals, whereas the CB of Sn-5p orbitals. In Pd-based perovskites having the formula Rb2PdX6 (X is a halogen ion), keeping the cations A and B fixed, as the anion size increases from Cl to Br to I., the band gap decreases. An explanation could be the electronegativity difference between cation B (Pd) and halogen ion (X). As the size of the negative ion increases, the Pd–X covalent bond becomes stronger due to the increased electronegativity difference. This causes Pd–X orbitals to move, elevating the VBM energy level and leading to a narrow band gap. The SOC plays no significant role here, except for Rb2PdI6, wherein the band gap decreases by 0.08 eV. The calculated DOS shows that the VB comprises the Pd-d and X-p orbitals and the CB of X-p orbitals.
In another case, Cs2PtX6 perovskites are considered. It was revealed that the band gap increases as the size of X anion increases. Among these perovskites, Cs2PtCl6 perovskite shows a direct band gap of 2.91 eV, which decreases to 2.71 eV after considering SOC. On the other hand, Cs2PtBr6 has an indirect band gap at 2.23 eV (excluding SOC) and 2.21 eV (including SOC). Here, SOC's effect is less significant compared to its Cl-based counterpart. The Cs2PtI6 has a band gap at 1.22 eV (without SOC) and 1.11 eV (considering SOC). In Cs2PtX6 compounds, the bottom of the VB comprises of Cs-p orbital while VBM primarily comprises X-p orbitals. The higher CBs comprise Cs-p and Pt-d orbitals. The Pt-d orbital disintegrates into a two-fold and a three-fold degenerate band gap and t2g states, respectively. The Pt-band gap states orbitals, X-p hybridized, occupy the upper part of the CB. The VBM is occupied by the Pt-t2g states.
Interestingly, among the above perovskites, Rb2PdBr6 (band gap ∼1.31 eV) and Cs2PtI6 (band gap ∼1.22 eV) have band gaps in the 0.9–1.6 eV optimal window, making them the ideal candidates for single-junction PSCs. The optical and dielectric behaviour can determine the performance of A2BX6 perovskites in PSCs. The behavioural characteristics like absorption spectra, complex dielectric function, reflectivity, and optical conductivity are considered for analysing their potential application in optoelectronic energy devices. The frequency-dependent imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω) (representing absorption) explains the energy band structure. 0.86 and 2.41 eV are the threshold energies for Rb2SnBr6 and Rb2SnI6, respectively, at which the optical transitions among VBM and CBM are direct. 2.12 eV, 1.33 eV, and 0.49 eV are the threshold energies of Rb2PdCl6, Rb2PdBr6, and Rb2PdI6, respectively. Likewise, the thresholds for Cs2PtCl6, Cs2PtBr6, and Cs2PtI6 occur at 2.93 eV, 2.08 eV and 1.11 eV. Their optical transitions are indirect, as seen in their band structures. The thresholds resemble the calculated band gap.
Qui et al. observed the photovoltaic performance of Cs2SnI6 as a light absorber. Cs2SnI6 films were synthesized in air through oxidative phase conversion of B-γ-CsSnI3 films. The layers of the fabricated solar cell were in order: glass/FTO/TiO2/Cs2SnI6/P3HT/Ag, as shown in Fig. 8d. The substrate was FTO/glasses, and the TiO2 layer was used as the blocking layer. The J–V characteristics of the devices prepared using Cs2SnI6 films of different thicknesses are displayed in Fig. 8e. The highest PCE of 0.96% was observed for Cs2SnI6 film device having 300 nm thickness exhibiting Jsc = 5.41 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.51 V and FF = 0.35. In another case, the vibrational and optical behaviour of the Cs2SnX6-type materials and their respective hole-transporting behaviour in solar cells were studied. Photoelectrochemical studies were conducted to appropriately choose a dye for Cs2SnI6 perovskite as an HTM (Fig. 8f). All dyes exhibited good PCE. The highest Jsc ∼10.35 mA cm−2 was obtained for the MK-2 dye, yet Z907 dye showed the highest PCE ∼3.27%. J–V characteristics of Cs2SnCl6 and Cs2SnBr6 were also obtained for Z907 dye. Among these three perovskites, Cs2SnI6 exhibited the highest PCE (Fig. 8g). The poor efficiency of Cs2SnCl6 and Cs2SnBr6-based solar cells is attributed to their large crystals leading to an inhomogeneous surface. The Jsc of Cs2SnCl6 and Cs2SnBr6 perovskites is 0.56 mA cm−2 and 0.41 mA cm−2, respectively, whereas the fill factor value <0.2 for both, reflecting low coverage of the dye by the perovskite. Besides, they have a large band gap, and there is probably no transfer of charge between them and the Z907 dye. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) films were added to this solar cell structure to optimize the performance (Fig. 8h). This increased the Jsc of the cells to 12.56 mA cm−2 and PCE to 4.23%.
Hamdan et al. examined Cs2PtI6 perovskite in acidic medium (pH-1), basic medium (pH-13), and through electroreduction. They used it in the form of an electrocatalyst and photoanode for hydrogen generation and water oxidation, respectively. The catalyst showed stability for 100 electrochemical cycles and 6 hours of hydrogen generation at pH-1. A photoanode of Cs2PtI6 was used in photoelectrochemical water oxidation, exhibiting a photocurrent of 0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) under simulated AM1.5G sunlight, and was stable for 12 hours for constant voltage supply.

Antimony (Sb) is widely used in therapeutics and thus presents a non-toxic alternative for Pb. Also, in contrast to Pb, which is absorbed by the human body, antimony residues mostly is excreted out through human excreta and urine. From the economic point of view, Sb is half in price as compared to Sn. In the 3+ oxidation state, the 5s and 5p orbitals of less toxic and cheaper Sb match well with the orbitals of p-block anions. The trivalent Sb3+ retains the lone-pair ns2 state similar to Pb2+, which leads to the extraordinary photovoltaic performance of Pb-based compounds. However, instead of crystallising in AMX3, trivalent Sb3+ favours a stable stoichiometry of A3M2X9. Two main phases of A3M2X9 includes the hexagonal phase usually referred as dimer phase which has bioctahedral face-sharing (M2I9)3− octahedra (0D phase) and the other layer phase which has corrugated layers with partial corner-sharing MX6 octahedra (2D phase).Fig. 9a–c shows the crystal structure of 0D and 2D A3Sb2X9, which is derived from the 3D perovskite phase.

Research in the A3Sb2X9 structure has been carried out with different A cations (MA, Cs, Rb, NH4), but the highest explored perovskite material is Cs3Sb2I9. The Cs3Sb2I9 exists in both dimer and layer phases depending upon its crystallization process conditions. Saparov et al. studied it extensively and calculated a direct band gap (2.06 eV) for the layer phase, and a larger indirect band gap (2.40 eV) for the dimer phase. It was revealed that the experimental absorption coefficient values of Sb-based perovskites have similar coefficients as Pb-based perovskites as shown in Fig. 9d. Similar band gap values for different A cations have been reported, revealing that these Pb-free perovskites possess wider band gaps which make them suitable for tandem, indoor, and building-integrated photovoltaics.
The absorption spectrum of Cs3Sb2I9 comprises two edges as shown by Wessels et al., a small excitonic peak near 2.0 eV and the other at higher energy which is attributed to the fundamental (electronic) band edge as shown in Fig. 9e. The lower energy edge leads to the formation of the tail and thus results in underestimation of the band gap. Similar absorption features have also been exhibited by Pb-based 3D perovskites, but the low binding energy leads to complete overlap of fundamental and excitonic emissions. This suggested that Sb-based perovskites have high binding energy (∼100 meV), which cannot be overcome via thermal activation. Thus, the observed emission does not comprise free exciton emission and thus lead to bound exciton recombination. The binding energy for Sb-based perovskites (∼100 meV) is significantly lower than that for Bi-based perovskites (∼300 meV), but a lot higher than Pb-based perovskites (∼25–30 meV). Pecunia et al. compared the effective lifetime of excitons from the PL decay of two phases of Cs3Sb2X9. It was found that Cs3Sb2X9 layer has a longer lifetime of τ1/e (1.62 ns) as compared to the dimer phase τ1/e = 0.32 ns, as exhibited in Fig. 9f. The short lifetime for the dimer phase was explained by dominant STE-induced non-radiative recombination.
Saparov et al. calculated the effective masses along two different planes and concluded that the structural anisotropy in the layered phase of Sb-perovskite results in larger effective mass of charge carrier along k[001] than those along k[100]. Therefore, film with orientation perpendicular to the substrate will possess better transport properties. However, the effective mass of holes along the k[001] is not very large, due to the rather dispersive nature of VB. Thus, their observation concluded that the layered nature may not be detrimental for PV application.
Singh et al. made thin films of both layered and dimer phase and showed that the absorption coefficient of the layered phase is higher than that of the dimer phases. The band gap was also experimentally calculated for both the phases by Tauc plot and bandgap of 2.30 and 2.05 eV were calculated for dimer and layer forms, respectively. Their findings were similar to that of calculated ones using DFT by Saparov et al. as shown in Fig. 9g. Saparov et al. further used a standard model and calculated formation energies for defects (Fig. 9h).
They observed that shallow acceptor and donor states are constituted by VCs and Csi, respectively, while other defects create deep level defects in Cs3Sb2I9. This behaviour of producing deeper defect states in Cs3Sb2I9 is different from that in the CH3NH3PbI3, where most of the defect states are shallow. This can be related to the more localized p atomic orbitals of Sb than that of Pb. The deep-level defect states in layered Cs3Sb2I9 thin films could be partly responsible for their poor PL intensity. Therefore, careful control of defects as well as defect passivation is essential to use Cs3Sb2I9 in optoelectronic applications. Despite similar absorption coefficients, the performance of these Sb-based perovskites is lacking behind their Shockley–Quisser (SQ) limits. This can be explained because of the broad photoluminescence exhibited by these materials. The materials possess intense Raman scattering at room temperature which indicates strong electron–phonon coupling and this affects the observed luminescence by broadening the emission bands via scattering as illustrated by Fig. 9i. The electron–phonon interactions also result in the formation of polarons inside the lattice. These polarons interact with the charge carriers and increase their effective mass. If the coupling is too strong then the polarons bind the charge carriers to the lattice sites and results in their self-trapping. The recombination due to self-trapping is responsible for the broad PL bands of the layered phases of Sb-based perovskites. The electron–phonon coupling in SB-based perovskite is found to be quite strong; S = 42.7. This high value despite the covalency in the structure can be attributed to the layered structure as it can tolerate more local fluctuations as the structure is are not rigidly bonded like the 3D case. The SbI6 octahedra are bonded to only three other octahedra in two directions and thus have more degrees of freedom than the 3D structure which has six bonds in all three directions. This allows the layered structure to have strong electron–phonon coupling and thus have major distortions in the presence of charge carriers. Singh et al. further found from the absorption curves that even in the dimer phase, there are two radiative transitions which are attributed to direct and indirect transitions. The PL curves also revealed two broad PL due to these two transitions at room temperature (Fig. 9j). The low-temperature PL studies revealed that the PL peak at a lower wavelength range was corresponding to indirect transitions. In their other work, similar broad PL peaks were found for all the three halogen counterparts (X = I, Br, Cl), and the broad PL peaks were reduced to a narrow peak at 4.7 K (Fig. 10a). The lower intensity PL can be further explained by low activation energy (<1.24 meV) for quenching of the zero-phonon emission in Sb-based perovskite. This low activation energy results in failure of excitons dissociation, and thus an exciton with lower binding energy than 1.2 meV would not be observed due to thermal energy. This implies that exciton trapping in defects is a major factor for the lack of free-exciton emission. Pecunia et al. deconvolved the PL emission peaks associated with the PL spectrum of 2D-Cs3Sb2I9−xClx and found three separate peaks at 1.97, 1.83, and 1.56 eV. They assigned these peaks to band edge emission (direct transition), STE emission, and defect-assisted emission as illustrated in Fig. 10b. Their finding further proves that this system strongly supports the strong electron–phonon interactions which are detrimental for solar cell performance.
Thin film preparations and characterizations of Cs3Sb2I9 and their first solar cell application were first reported in 2015. Boopathi et al. used HI and observed a champion PCE of 0.84%. The solution-processed thin films were synthesized by vapour assisted approach by Singh et al. They compared the PCE as well as the optoelectronic properties of both layered and dimeric phases of Cs3Sb2I9 and achieved device PCEs of 1.5 and 0.89%, respectively. The stability of the thin films was found to be better than that of MAPbI3 films. The layered Cs3Sb2I9 exhibited an exciton lifetime of 6 ns and exciton binding energy of 100 meV. Further, Umar et al. used chloride as an inhibitor, lowering down the formation rate of the Sb–I–Sb bond and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was introduced into the precursor solution which resulted in an efficiency of 1.2%. Thus, an intermediate coordinated phase using this HCl-assisted strategy helped in crystallizing layered Cs3Sb2I9 film at lower temperatures. As the Cs3Sb2I9 films prepared via solution processing organize in the dimeric form, so Singh et al. used Lewis acid–base adduct approach to improve the morphology of the dimer phase. They achieved a PCE of 1.8% and also found that NMP mediated film is stable under all environmental stresses.
In addition to Cs as the A-site cation, Harikesh et al. found that a smaller cation Rb is more inclined to make layered structures via solution methods (Fig. 10c). The formation energies of the two structural phases of A3Sb2I9 with A = Cs (1.88 Å) and Rb (1.72 Å) cations were compared with the help of DFT. They concluded that for Rb3Sb2I9 the layered phase is more stable and also has a better heat resistance compared to the Cs compound. Corre-Baena et al. synthesised A3Sb2I9 thin film with Cs, Rb, and K as the A-site cation and found that the A-site cation showed a significant effect on not only on the structural properties but also on the optoelectronic properties of the thin films. The most suitable was found to be Rb3Sb2I9 and a PCE of 0.76% was recorded for its solar cell. Bromination of the films was also done and Rath et al. found that the absorption onset blue shifts and the band gap rises from 2.02 to 2.46 eV, without inducing any change in the crystalline structure. They recorded a PCE of 1.37% for solar cells based on the Rb3Sb2I9 absorber. New perovskite derivatives with even smaller cation of formula (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x were also developed as shown in Fig. 10d, which delivered a hole carrier mobility of 4.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron carrier mobility of 12.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. A single crystal of (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x. A high Voc of 1.03 V and a PCE of 0.51% were demonstrated for PSCs based on (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x as absorber. Hebig et al. used MA3Sb2I9 in PSCs and achieved a PCE of only 0.5%. Later, Boopathi et al. used HI as an additive to improve the quality of thin films and achieved a PCE of 2.04%. Karupawamy synthesized films with large grain of MA3Sb2I9 by inserting a hydrophobic scaffold as an underlayer. A record efficiency of 2.77% was obtained using these films as solar absorbers. Meanwhile, Zhou et al. reported that adding chlorine into the system help to crystallize the layered phase at lower temperatures and also prepared high-quality crystalline films of layered phase MA3Sb2ClxI9−x (Fig. 11a and b). Dai et al. introduced bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium (Li-TFSI) to control the dimensional phase change and produced high-quality two-dimensional A3Sb2I9−xClx film and achieved a PCE of 3.34%. Semi-transparent cells were also made by using the architecture given in Fig. 11c which yielded a PCE of 2.62 to 3.06% with average visible transparencies (AVT) of 42 to 23%, respectively. This work illustrated the use of these perovskite derivatives in semi-transparent cells and also opened up their use in solar windows. In addition to all these works done for the PCE improvement, the solar cell performance under 1 sun was still limited. Singh et al. tried to improve the morphology of Cs3Sb2I9 by using ITIC to make Lewis acid–base adduct as illustrated in Fig. 11d, and achieved the highest efficiency in this system of about 3.5%. It was realised that if the heterostructure of these high band gap semiconductors is made with a low band gap ETL like ITIC, then it resulted in a panchromatic absorption. The resulting films still maintained a good transmission and can be further used in semi-transparent cells in future (Fig. 11e). It was realised that the EQE spectra of these systems overlap the LED spectrum and hence the devices were used under indoor light illumination (Fig. 11f). The indoor light illumination of this cell resulted in an efficiency of around 9% and gave a new pathway for use of these perovskites.
Though a substantial amount of efficiency improvement has been recorded for Sb-based perovskites, their larger bandgap is still a huge stone for further efficiency enhancement. Various ways are underway to reduce the bandgap by using elemental doping or by elemental substitution. Pal et al. reported that by introducing Sn4+ in the MA3Sb2I9 structure, the optical band gap of MA3Sb2I9 can be reduced from 2 eV to 1.55 eV. Due to this hetero-valence substitution in MA3Sb2I9, the CB edge of the perovskite gradually shifts and changes the perovskite from p to n-type, as was revealed by the density of state spectra. The decrease of the band gap was found to be at the expense of increased surface roughness, and thus tin content was optimized to find a balance between the band gap and the surface roughness. The planar heterojunction PSC was optimized to achieve an excellent Jsc of 8.32 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 2.69%. Sulphur was also used as a dopant and MASbSI2 was used as a solar light absorber in photovoltaic devices, which yielded an optimal PCE of 3.08%.
This is to be noted here that the most successful and stable phase for Sb based perovskite are the all-inorganic counterparts (Rb3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9), while for Pb-based perovskite the all-inorganic phase (CsPbI3) is highly unstable in moisture. The Sb-based perovskite not only exhibits a good stability under moisture, it also presents an outstanding thermal as well as light stability.

Bismuth demonstrates very little evidence of toxicity, and thus, is particularly remarkable as heavy metal. Bi in its 3+ oxidation state possesses a strong lone pair effect and potentially benevolent properties, owing to the matching of p-block anions with it. Similar to Sb3+, the trivalent Bi3+ retains the lone-pair ns2 state similar to Pb2+ and crystallizes in the stable stoichiometry of A3Bi2X9. Unlike CH3NH3PbI3 in which Pb 6s orbitals contribute majorly in the VBM, the contribution of the Bi 6s orbitals to the VBM is smaller and thus, resulting in less cation–anion orbital interactions. These lesser orbital interactions lead to the dispersion of the VBM and thus, the effective mass for holes is higher in Bi-based perovskites than in CH3NH3PbI3. This indicates that the mobility of holes is lower in bismuth-based perovskites. Fig. 12a–c compares the optoelectronic properties of bismuth-based perovskites with different A cations. Like Sb, Bi also favours low dimensional perovskite like structures. For (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, the crystallographic dimensionality can be assigned as 0.5 D, because the [BiI6]3− octahedra pairs through face-sharing and form isolated Bi2I93− groups alternating with CH3NH3+ cations (Fig. 12d). A 0D material has completely isolated octahedra, while a 1D material has isolated ribbons of bismuth halide. The low dimensionality limits charge transport as the electrons and holes localize in the isolated Bi2I93− groups and results in flat bands in VBM and a low dispersion of CBM. Kawai et al. calculated an exciton binding energy of 300 meV, which is considerably higher than the exciton binding energy of 5 meV reported for CH3NH3PbI3. Further, a trap state density of 3.3 × 1011 cm−3 was measured for Bi-based compound which is an order of magnitude higher than for CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals. Thus, the high trap state density, large band-gap, and considerably high exciton binding energy are the primary cause of limited free-carrier generation which altogether limits the application of (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 in a solar cell.

Park et al. reported the synthesis of (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9via a one-step spin coating method. Synthesized thin films exhibited weak PL emission and poor morphology with interlinked and overlapping grains. The XRD patterns for different A3Bi2X9 materials are given in Fig. 12e. Cs+ was used to substitute CH3NH3+, which resulted in an increase in the PL quantum yield but an enhanced bandgap. Öz et al. also found poor morphology for (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 films processed by one-step spin coating method, which can be attributed to the fast crystallization and the poor solubility of BiI3 in common organic solvents. To solve this issue, Hoye et al. proposed a two-step fabrication process. First, BiI3 was spin-cast and annealed to obtain compact BiI3 films, then diffusion of methylammonium iodide (MAI) was done through either spin-casting on top or via exposure to MAI vapor. The vapor-assisted processed films demonstrated longer carrier lifetimes. Growth of compact (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 thin films using vacuum evaporation processing routes has also been demonstrated. However, PL lifetimes were limited to a very low value of 2.84 ns. A solvent engineering method with antisolvent dripping has been demonstrated by Shin et al. to synthesize compact phase-pure (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 films to further improve crystallization during the spin-casting process. Adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP) as additives to solutions of BiI3 and MAI further resulted in the formation of Lewis adducts, which improved the solubility of BiI3 and slowed down the crystallization process to give compact morphologies. The films produced by the solvent-engineering method appear to be highly compact and continuous, contributing toward better PCE of 0.71%. Despite these efforts, the Jsc has been below 2.95 mA cm−2, limiting the overall PCE of devices. This low PCE can be attributed to the wide band gap of 2.9 eV in (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 (ref. 275) as well as high effective masses, exciton binding energy, low charge mobility as well as low diffusion length of carriers.
In one of the earlier reports on PSC fabrication with bismuth-based defect perovskite, solution processed A3Bi2I9 (A = MA or Cs) was used. Both the perovskite thin films displayed different morphology, but the Cs based perovskite displayed higher absorption and PL intensity which was most likely the reason for improved device PCE >1% compared to only 0.12% for MA-based device. The low Voc and Jsc of MA3Bi2I9 can also be attributed to higher non-radiative recombination and higher exciton binding energy, respectively. These did not allow energy charge separation and transport to the interfacial layers. It has been also developed through an in situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) study that the formation of the MA3Bi2I9 phase was direct from the precursor solution without any other ordered intermediate phases. This makes the formation of uniform MA3Bi2I9 layer enormously difficult. However, the growth of the film was further suggested to be controlled by an anti-solvent dripping method which resulted in the highest efficiency of 0.17%. Similarly, even recently, the comparison of Cs and MA in A3Bi2I9 based perovskite solar cells have witnessed a superior performance from the former compared to the latter. This work also presented thickness-dependent morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films which resulted in tuning the photo-physical and optical properties of the active layer. In one of the other works, A3Bi2I9 based perovskite was fabricated by tuning the stoichiometric ratio of MAI (or CsI) with BiI3. The band gap of the perovskite was altered by varying the ratio, which also altered the energy band levels. When the band-edges of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite were observed through scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, it was found to be p-type due to the acceptor-nature of the defects above the VB. With methylammonium presented at the A-sites, defect-formation was not facile due to the defect-tolerant nature of MA-based perovskites. The photovoltaic results were also tested for the perovskite and the efficiency of Cs3Bi2I9 was inferior to that of the MA3Bi2I9. Furthermore, the electron extraction and transport from the MA3Bi2I9 based perovskite were studied by varying the TiO2 layer (planar, brookite, and anatase mesoporous) for solar cell application. It was well demonstrated that the morphology of the active layer depends strongly on the underlying layers. The mesoporous TiO2 layer showed uniform nucleation and growth of perovskite. Even though the PCE was limited to 0.2% only, but the devices were found to be stable for 10 weeks which confirmed that MA3Bi2I9 can be a promising material for optoelectronic applications especially solar cells. Furthermore, TiO2 based nanorods were also utilized as the mesoporous layer as ETL to develop MA3BI2I9 perovskite solar cells. The electron extraction potential barrier was dependent on the size of the nanorods and the largest potential barrier was found for nanorods of 564 nm in size. This resulted in an efficiency of 0.14% and stability of over two months. Moreover, a comparative study of fabricating A3Bi2I9 based PSC in both n-i-p and p-i-n architecture has also been performed. For the n-i-p architecture, the usual compact and mesoporous TiO2 was used at ETL and spiro-OMeTAD was used as HTL, while for the p-i-n architecture, NiOx was used as HTL, and PCBM was used as ETL. As expected, the highest efficiency of 0.21% was obtained for n-i-p architecture due to enhanced Jsc which was due to the improved morphology on the underlying TiO2 layer. However, the performance of the p-i-n device was improved by partly replacing Bi with Sb to obtain a PCE of 0.34%.
Thereafter, one of the early breakthroughs of MA3Bi2I9 based photovoltaic was achieved using the high-low vacuum deposition (HLVD) process, where the BiI3 was deposited in high vacuum (∼10−4 Pa) followed by MAI deposition in low vacuum (∼100 Pa). The deposited films were then thermally annealed to obtain optimum quality MA3Bi2I9 perovskite films of sub-micron to micron-sized grains without any solvent processing. The highest efficiency of 1.64% was obtained for the 300 °C annealed perovskite film, which shows lower hysteresis and higher repeatability. The device was further found to be stable for 16 weeks. In one of the other works, vacuum deposition was again employed to deposit MA3Bi2I9 perovskite films with varying substrate temperatures and solvent vapor annealing. Here, fluorinated PDI based organic ETL was also added instead of the conventional TiO2. It was systematically proven that the morphology of the active layer can be tuned by varying the substrate temperature and improved photo-response was obtained for substrate temperature of 75 °C which resulted in PCE of 0.06%. It has also been established that BiI3 on vapor treatment with MAI can be easily converted to MA3Bi2I9. MAI vapor treatment of 25 minutes resulted in an improved morphology and crystallinity that led to a PCE of 3.17%. The better surface coverage minimized short-circuit between the cathode and anode increasing the repeatability of the device results. There was also a reduction of the Bi-based metal defect sites due to over exposure of the MAI vapor resulting in lower recombination loss. This technique has also been attempted to grow MA3Bi2I9 with sulfur incorporation. The sulfur content in the perovskite film was controlled by the reaction time and its presence was confirmed by EDX and XPS studies. The highest PCE of 0.152% was achieved for 30 min reaction time, which displayed the lowest trap density among other variants. Thereafter, chemical vapor deposition technique has also been attempted to grow MA3Bi2I9 perovskite films for large-area photovoltaic applications. Due to the limited penetration of perovskite in the mesoporous layer, the device result was not as promising as vapor deposition and vapor assisted annealing methodology. However, it has been nicely presented that the perovskite crystallite size can be well controlled by modulating its thickness. The morphology of the Cs3Bi2I9 has also been tuned by solvent dripping during spin-coating followed by solvent annealing. Also, its energy offset with various HTLs in a p-i-n architecture was checked. It was found that for the Cs3Bi2I9, instead of PEDOT:PSS, PTAA and NiOx were better matched with the HTL, resulting in PCEs of 0.37% and 1.26%, respectively. The morphology of the MA3Bi2I9 based active layer has also been tuned by varying the molar concentration in the precursor solution. The optimum concentration was found to be 0.2 M, which displayed the largest crystallite size of perovskite. The spin-speed was also controlled, and it was found that at 5000 rpm the film coverage was better than the other variants. The best photovoltaic result of 0.16% was obtained for a combination of 0.2 M perovskite in precursor solution coated at a spin-speed of 5000 rpm.
FA3Bi2I9 based perovskite solar cell has also been fabricated to replace the most use MA and Cs in the A-site of the A3Bi2I9 photovoltaic. It formed a hexagonal phase and plate-like morphological structure by precursor solvent engineering. Due to the large size to FA large perovskite unit cell was obtained. This improved the light absorption in the perovskite film resulting in an efficiency of 0.022%. A carbon-based MA3Bi2I9 perovskite solar cell was also fabricated using methyl acetate as green solvent for the precursor solution. The results of two HTMs, namely spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, were compared and the device with P3HT as HTM showed higher efficiency of 1.62% compared to 1.12% for spiro-OMeTAD. Further, P3HT based device also displayed ambient stability of 35 days. Another work has compared all three Bi-based perovskites, namely MA3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9 and FA3Bi2I9 in a HTL-free and carbon-based PSC. In this work as well, Cs3Bi2I9 based PSC outperforms the other two with a PCE of 1.51%, whereas MA3Bi2I9 and FA3Bi2I9 based solar cells showed the highest efficiencies of 0.67% and 0.87%, respectively. These improvements in performance were attributed to enhancement of both Jsc and FF values. The results were largely associated to the higher absorption coefficients, enhanced charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. Also, the well-matched energy levels with respect to the carbon electron helped in achieving the necessary results. Among the other derivatives of the A3Bi2I9, (NH4)3Sb2I9 has also been demonstrated as a photo-absorber for solar cells. Two-step spin-coating method with anti-solvent has been used to facilitate perovskite film growth. PCE of 0.42% was achieved for a device fabricated by a two-step process, which was higher than that of the one-step method (0.2%). A similar technique has been also used to develop (NH4)3Sb2I9 based perovskite solar cells by varying the ratio of DMF:DMSO and chlorobenzene as anti-solvent. The crystallization of the perovskite layer was controlled by solvent engineering effectively and resulted in the highest PCE of 0.6%.

There is a rich structural diversity in the lead-free perovskite materials which makes them suitable for different optoelectronic applications. Here, a systematic review of the recent progress in lead-free perovskite materials for PSCs application has been presented. The replacement of Pb with homovalent as well as heterovalent atoms resulting in ABX3, A2B(I)B(III)X6, A3□B(III)2X9 and A2□B(IV)X6 materials have been reviewed. The material properties, device performance and stability of the promising lead-free perovskite materials has been presented highlighting the key issues and possible solutions for further development.

The ABX3 type Sn-based Pb-free perovskites show excellent optoelectronic properties, and a highest PCE of 14.81% has been achieved. However, the easy oxidation of Sn2+ poses serious stability issue in Sn-based perovskites and hinders the further development of Sn-based PSCs. To solve this problem, numerous efforts have been made including creation of a tin rich environment by use of excess tin halide and through utilization of oxidation inhibiting reducing agents. Similar to Pb-based perovskites, additives have also been applied to improve the film quality of Sn-based perovskites. In addition, compositional engineering of Sn-based perovskites has been a successful approach to significantly improve the device performance. Chemical modification of A-site cations can lead to improvement in the morphology of perovskite film and hence the performance of solar cell devices. In addition, it helps in improving the long-term stability. Specifically, the development of 2D/3D mixed or 2D Sn-perovskites by introducing larger A-site cations such as BA+ or PEA+ in 3D perovskites is instrumental in improving the device stability to a great extent. Another method of tuning the properties of Sn-perovskites is with the compositional engineering of anions. This can enhance the device performance by changing the bandgap and carrier density. Other than engineering the perovskite layer, interface properties and device design are key to the device performance. Sn-based PSCs have limited options for suitable charge transport layers and hence, there is a need to investigate and develop charge transport materials appropriate for Sn-based PSCs. The charge transport materials should make a perfect interface and suitable energy alignment with Sn-based perovskites.
In the double-perovskite Pb-free materials, Cs2AgBiBr6 has demonstrated the maximum potential for application in the field of photovoltaic devices. Nevertheless, the indirect band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6, thick absorber films (tens to hundreds of μm) would considerably increase the generated photocurrent but would result in long charge-carrier diffusion lengths. Hence, it is important to know the charge-carrier diffusion length and mobility. So far, a clear evaluation of these parameters is still missing for this material, and to date, several different values have been reported. There are many possible ways of improving the performance of these photovoltaic cells. The doping of Rb+ ions in the Cs2AgBiBr6-type double perovskite can effectively increase the performance of the device. It was reported that the absorption of long wavelength of double perovskite doped with Rb+ is strengthened due to localized surface plasmons polaritons (LSPP), produced by Ag particles. The average PCE of the devices with (Cs0·9Rb0.1)2AgBiBr6 is nearly 15% higher than that of the devices with Cs2AgBiBr6, thereby enhancing their application potential. Several methods for manufacturing Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs have been proven to be successful, including low pressure, antisolvent method, vapour deposition, and cationic doping. While these studies demonstrated encouraging results, there is still a long way to go before achieving the ideal efficiency value of 8%. Additionally, the majority of published techniques focused on optimising Cs2AgBiBr6 films, whereas just a few studies addressed HTLs or ETLs, which are potentially possible avenues for increasing the performance of Cs2AgBiBr6-based PSCs. Some other major limitations in the development of these devices are the poor morphology and high defect density of lead-free double perovskite films with larger bandgap. Double perovskite has low solubility in common solvents, fast crystallization, and high annealing temperature that limits the high film quality for lead-free devices. Therefore, much efforts are required to tackle these issues.
A2BX6-type vacancy ordered double perovskites are known to display the desired optical and electronic properties through compositional engineering at all three sites. For example, tuning the halogen composition in the X-site modulates the band alignment and charge transport properties for application in solar cells. The incorporation of small-sized halogen results in the increased bandgap, while the large-sized halogens decrease the bandgap due to the sufficient orbital overlap between the neighbouring isolated octahedral resulting in higher carrier mobilities. Further, B-site can also be modulated as its covalent interaction with the halide allows tuning of the bandgap from direct to indirect and vice versa. This also results in regulating the charge transport properties, which further affects the solar cell performance. Finally, even though the A-site does not participate in tuning the optical properties, its compositional engineering influences the nearby octahedral framework. This leads to a change in the carrier effective masses and structural topologies. It is also well-known that selection of A-site cation results in electron-phonon coupling reaction which influences the charge transport of the perovskite. Thus, as large range of chemical composition modulation is possible as all three sites; it will be quite interesting to study and understand the dynamics and structure–property relationship of this material which can lead to sustainable energy conversion using photovoltaic cells.
A3M2X9 perovskites have come up as a promising class of perovskite material that reduced toxicity and more stability. Even though these materials have high excitons binding energy, the tunable optoelectronic properties have allowed them to be used for photovoltaic applications. For solar cells, bismuth and antimony have been mostly used at the M-site, and PCE beyond 3% has been obtained with the later. These materials are wide band gap in nature which is one of the limiting factors of the photovoltaic performance. Other major challenges with this material include the formation of poor morphological features, lower charge transportation due to high excitons binding energy, and hysterical crystallization process. These drawbacks can be addressed to further improve the efficiency and stability of solar cells. Also, introduction of other metals at M-site can reduce the band gap. Further, the morphology and crystallization of the perovskite film can be controlled by additives and anti-solvent methods. Utilization of new transport layers can help in separating the excitons and their extraction, thereby increasing the charge transport property. Finally, the stability can be further improved by addition of hydrophobic cations along with the perovskite.
The cation-ordered double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 and antimony- or bismuth-based A3B2X9 perovskite derivatives, which have bandgaps of less than 2 eV, have high prospect to be utilized for the perovskite-silicon tandem devices. Furthermore, lead-free perovskites offer appealing prospects for color-tunable building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) applications in architectural design since they have hues that encompass several visible spectrum areas. These perovskite absorbers provide a high average visual transparency (AVT) with an optical gap of 2.0 eV, enabling the simultaneous harvesting of visible light photons. By exploring tandem designs in conjunction with other solar cells (such as organic ones) that absorb near-infrared photons, the full potential of lead-free perovskites for transparent photovoltaics may be realized. In this regard, it is anticipated that lead-free PSCs could be very useful for Internet of Things (IoT) applications where compact photovoltaic devices (a few cm2) are required.
In summary, a large body of work reported on Pb-free perovskite materials has been scrutinized, where the structural, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performances of a broad range of materials, including ABX3, A2B(I)B(III)X6, A3□B(III)2X9 and A2□B(IV)X6 have been discussed and future directions have been presented for further development (Fig. 13). Pb-free perovskite materials avoid the toxicity issue and are more conducive towards commercial applications. The development till date is encouraging, and we believe that further investigations on Pb-free PSCs will enable the use of these materials to be commercially relevant.
