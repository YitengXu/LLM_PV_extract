We introduce a facile approach to use ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) and ruthenium (Ru) nanostructures as effective counter electrodes instead of using platinum (Pt) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). RuO2 and Ru nanostructure layers on the FTO glass can be readily prepared by a simple annealing process followed by the spin coating process of the mixture solution containing amorphous RuO2·xH2O precursor and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a dispersion matrix at low temperature in air. The Ru metal nanostructure layer prepared by the reduction of RuO2 with H2 shows the highest efficiency of 6.77% in DSSC operation, which is comparable to the efficiency of the Pt electrode (7.87%).

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising sustainable alternatives to inorganic solar cells for electric power generation by solar energy conversion owing to their low cost, environmental safety, and relatively high solar conversion efficiency. Generally, platinum (Pt) has been extensively introduced as a counter electrode material which is an indispensable component in DSSCs because of its good catalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, and chemical stability against corrosive iodine based electrolytes. However, due to its high cost and scarcity, there have been recent efforts to find out an efficient alternative as the counter electrode material of DSSCs to replace platinum. Among possible candidates, ruthenium (Ru) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) are attractive electroactive materials as promising potential electrodes in electrochemical devices, capacitors, and optoelectronics owing to their high catalytic activity, extremely low resistivity, and good chemical and thermal stability. Additionally, the price of ruthenium (Ru) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is much cheaper than that of platinum. Although RuO2 has been used in light emitting devices, organic thin film transistors, and organic photovoltaics, its application in the field of DSSCs is rarely considered owing to the higher instinct resistivity of RuO2 as well as the relatively complicated synthetic process compared to that of the conventional Pt electrode in DSSCs. Furthermore, there have been no reports of using pure ruthenium metal nanostructures as counter electrodes of DSSCs so far.

Recently, Yun et al. first reported the potential use of the thermally annealed RuO2 thin film deposited by radio frequency sputtering as a counter electrode based on the improved solar cell parameters including an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.639 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.2 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 45%, and an efficiency of 3.5%, respectively. Hou et al. also described the use of RuO2 nanocrystals prepared by two step hydrothermal and thermal annealing processes for triiodide reduction in DSSCs, resulting in a remarkably comparable photovoltaic efficiency of 7.22% relative to that of Pt of 7.17%. They also concluded that the high-efficiency photovoltaic performance of RuO2 nanocrystals could be attributed to both superior electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity based on theoretical and electrochemical considerations. However, the FF of 54% among photovoltaic parameters is too low to be reliable for the fabrication of high performance DSSCs. It is well known that the reasonable FF in the use of Pt electrodes is generally over 70% contributing to the good performance of DSSCs. Furthermore, the synthetic approach for preparing RuO2 nanocrystals is complicated with the long time hydrothermal process of 48 h as well as a high sintering temperature of 450 °C.
In this communication, thus we propose a simple strategy to effectively form the nanostructure RuO2 layer and the pure Ru layer as alternative counter electrodes for the fabrication of high performance DSSCs. RuO2 and Ru nanoparticles on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass can be directly synthesized from an amorphous RuO2·xH2O precursor via a thermal annealing process in an air or H2 atmosphere. Furthermore, we introduce the incorporation of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in RuO2·xH2O nanoparticle solution as an effective matrix polymer in order to further increase the loading concentration of RuO2 and Ru nanoparticles and induce a homogeneous distribution of RuO2 and Ru nanoparticles on the substrate, resulting in much enhanced catalytic properties in DSSC operation.
The details of the experimental procedure are explained in ESI.Fig. 1 represents typical SEM images of RuO2 layers directly prepared in the course of thermal annealing from amorphous RuO2·xH2O precursors with and without PEO and the reference Pt layer on FTO glass substrates. The distinct difference in the use of PEO is immediately apparent in the distribution of RuO2 nanoparticles on FTO glass. While RuO2 nanoparticles are seen as mostly aggregated forms with a low density as shown in Fig. 1a, they are well dispersed on FTO glass due to the supported PEO matrix polymer as shown in Fig. 1b. It thus indicates that PEO can serve as an effective matrix for the homogeneous distribution of amorphous RuO2 nanoparticles during the spin coating process of the mixture solution of RuO2·xH2O precursor and then it prevents the aggregation of RuO2 nanoparticles on FTO glass substrates during the thermal annealing process. On the other hand, the morphology of the reduced RuO2 nanoparticles under a flow of H2 gas at 150 °C is quite similar to that of RuO2 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 1c. In addition, the reference sample of the Pt layer shows a very uniform distribution of Pt nanoparticles with the size of sub-10 nm on the FTO glass as shown in Fig. 1d and inset. The growth mechanism is quite similar to a well-established vapor–solid (VS) process except for a nucleation step from the vapor phase precursor. In our study, the origin of the nucleation of nanostructures is obviously amorphous RuO2·xH2O precursor nanoparticles and they can be readily crystallized as water is removed from the amorphous RuO2·xH2O precursor nanoparticles at high temperature. This strategy is certainly fruitful to form the thin counter electrode layer of RuO2 and reduced RuO2 nanoparticles at a much lower temperature of 250 °C compared to that of Pt nanoparticles of 400 °C.

Fig. 2 represents the XRD patterns, Raman spectra, and XPS spectra of RuO2 nanoparticle layers prepared by using the PEO polymer matrix. In Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern of the original RuO2 nanoparticle layer confirms the presence of crystalline RuO2 structures, exhibiting indexed peaks, (110), (101) and (211), consistent with the rutile RuO2 structure in the tetragonal phase which is in agreement with the standard reference data (JCPDS 88-0322). However, the reduced RuO2 nanoparticle layer obtained as a result of flow of H2 gas shows very distinct characteristic peaks compared to the untreated one, corresponding to (100) and (101) in the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure of Ru metal.
In addition to XRD data of nanoparticles, evidence regarding the chemical composition of nanoparticles was obtained from Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2b). Raman spectra clearly exhibit three characteristic peaks measured at 510, 625, and 690 cm−1 which can be attributed to the first order Eg, A1g, and B2g phonon bands of the rutile RuO2 structure or Ru metal. In addition, the nature of the broad full width at half maximum (FWHM) of two peaks for Eg and A1g modes compared with that of the bulk single crystal can be partially attributed to the size induced phonon confinement effect, which led to a downshift and broadening of the first order Raman bands.
The surface composition and the chemical states of elements in nanoparticles were carefully investigated from high resolution Ru 3d and O 1s XPS spectra obtained before and after the reduction process (Fig. 2c and d). Although Ru 3d XPS spectra of nanoparticles are severely overlapped with C 1s peak positions of the various carbon bound species, it is immediately apparent that there is a shift of the intense peak position from 281.2 eV to 280.3 eV for Ru 3d5/2 after the reduction process at 150 °C under a H2 atmosphere as shown in Fig. 2c. The sharp peak of as-prepared RuO2 nanoparticles at a binding energy of 281.2 eV is readily assigned to the 3d5/2 spin orbit doublet of RuO2, consistent with the literature values of RuO2. It implies that the surface chemical state of Ru in the study is mainly RuO2, which is the stable oxide phase after the oxidation process at high temperature in air. On the other hand, the XPS spectrum of reduced nanoparticles indicates that the peak for Ru 3d5/2 from RuO2 is shifted to a lower binding energy of 280.3 eV, consistent with that of Ru metal. For the spectra of O 1s in Fig. 2d, while the peak of 529.6 eV of RuO2 (PEO) is reasonably consistent with the presence of Ru4+ from RuO2, the intense peak at a binding energy of 531.6 eV of Ru (PEO) is closely related to Ru metal bounded species such as H2O and residual O containing species. As a consequence, we present that crystalline RuO2 nanoparticles or Ru nanoparticles with a homogeneous distribution can be prepared by a simple thermal annealing process from a RuO2·xH2O precursor mixed with PEO in an air or H2 atmosphere.
The detailed crystal structures of RuO2 and reduced RuO2 nanoparticles were investigated by means of TEM images as shown in Fig. 3. It is clearly seen that RuO2 nanoparticles in the PEO matrix are well dispersed with a size of below 5 nm (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, a typical HRTEM image of a RuO2 nanoparticle along the [010] zone axis indicates that a nanoparticle possesses the single crystalline nature with no sign of any amorphous overlayer. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) of a nanoparticle represents that the lattice spacing of the adjacent plane is about 0.2318 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of the tetragonal RuO2 phase, in close agreement with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the lattice-resolved image (Fig. 3 inset). On the other hand, the morphology of the reduced RuO2 nanoparticles was slightly changed into elongated nanostructures from the spherical shape of untreated RuO2 nanostructures as shown in Fig. 3c and d. In addition, the lattice spacing of the adjacent plane after the reduction process was about 0.2056 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure of Ru metal, which is well matched with our XRD and XPS data. Thus, we could conclude that the reduced form of nanoparticles is pure Ru metal transformed from the RuO2 rutile crystalline structure.
The performance of the RuO2 counter electrode in DSSCs was compared with that of the Pt electrode. The DSSCs utilizing the RuO2 counter electrode fabricated with PEO and without PEO will be denoted as Cell-RuO2(PEO) and Cell-RuO2, respectively. The DSSCs utilizing the counter electrode after the reduction process of RuO2(PEO) will be denoted as Cell-Ru(PEO). Fig. 4a compares the J–V characteristics of DSSCs with different counter electrodes and their solar cell performance parameters are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4a, the power conversion efficiency of Cell-RuO2(PEO) is 20.90% higher than that of Cell-RuO2, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced FF of Cell-RuO2(PEO) compared to that of Cell-RuO2. As shown in the SEM image, the efficiency of RuO2(PEO) was greatly enhanced when compared to that of RuO2. Therefore, it is expected that the catalytic performance of the RuO2 counter electrode processed with PEO (RuO2(PEO)) will be superior to that processed without PEO (RuO2). The efficiency of Cell-RuO2(PEO) was further improved as the RuO2 nanoparticles in the counter electrode were reduced to Ru nanoparticles (Cell-Ru(PEO)). This improvement is mainly attributed to the enhanced FF of Cell-Ru(PEO) compared to that of Cell-RuO2(PEO). This implies that the series resistance of DSSCs was reduced after utilizing Ru(PEO) as a counter electrode material. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) analysis of the DSSCs supports this assumption.

Fig. 4b shows Nyquist plots of DSSCs with Pt, RuO2 and Ru counter electrodes. These plots were obtained under open-circuit conditions and under 1 sun illumination conditions. Usually, three semicircles are observed from Nyquist plots of the DSSCs. The first and second semicircles correspond to the impedance of spatially separated interfaces formed by electrolyte|catalyst (Pt, RuO2, or Ru) and electrolyte|dye|TiO2|FTO, respectively. The third semicircle, not clearly observed in Fig. 4b, is related to ion diffusion in the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4b and Table 2, the first semicircles of Cell-Ru(PEO) and Cell-RuO2(PEO) are apparently smaller than that of Cell-RuO2. The resistance of the electrolyte|catalyst (RuO2 or Ru) interface in Cell-RuO2, Cell-RuO2(PEO) and Cell-Ru(PEO) is 18.3 Ω, 7.3 Ω and 4.3 Ω, respectively (R1 in Table 2). This clearly shows that the reduction process on RuO2 nanoparticles can effectively reduce the impedance (or electrical resistance) of the electrolyte|Ru(PEO) interface, which is closely related to the FF of the DSSCs.

We measured the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Pt, RuO2, RuO2(PEO) and Ru(PEO) coated FTO glass substrates to investigate their catalytic activities for the redox reaction in iodine-based solution. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Pt electrode displayed two pairs of redox peaks, which is a typical CV in the I3−/I− electrolyte, corresponding to the following reactions: 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3− and I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−. RuO2, RuO2(PEO) and Ru(PEO) electrodes also showed the similar shape of CV with Pt, indicating that the same reaction process with that of Pt occurs on Ru-based electrodes. The left side redox peak at more negative potential coincides with the reduction reaction of I3−, which is main concern to investigate the catalytic activities as a counter electrode. Since the high current density of peak and small peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp) between redox peaks represents a small overpotential and a high electrochemical reaction rate for the redox reaction, we can conclude that the order of catalytic activity of counter electrodes is as follows: Pt > Ru(PEO) > RuO2(PEO) > RuO2.

Fig. 4d shows typical Tafel polarization curves for Pt, RuO2, RuO2(PEO) and Ru(PEO) electrodes and we can obtain the exchange current density (J0) from the intersection at U = 0 of the tangent to the cathodic current. The slope of cathodic current of Ru(PEO) is much steeper compared to that of RuO2(PEO) and RuO2, indicating that J0 on the surface of Ru(PEO) is higher than that of RuO2(PEO) and RuO2 and that the catalytic activity of Ru(PEO) is highest among Ru-based electrodes. The J0 obtained from Tafel curves can be correlated with the charge transfer resistance measured from EIS by the following equation. The trends in J0 observed in Tafel curves are well consistent with the R1 values measured by EIS.

R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction reaction and Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface (this is the fitted value of R1 in EIS).
In conclusion, we report a facile approach to use ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) and ruthenium (Ru) nanostructures as effective counter electrodes instead of using platinum (Pt) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). RuO2 and Ru nanostructure layers on the FTO glass can be readily prepared by a simple annealing process followed by the spin coating process of the mixture solution containing an amorphous RuO2·xH2O precursor and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a dispersion matrix at low temperature in air. The density and dispersity of RuO2 nanoparticles were greatly improved by using PEO as a dispersion matrix, which led to enhanced solar cell performance. The solar cell performance was further improved by reducing the RuO2 nanoparticles to Ru with H2 gas. As a consequence, the DSSC utilizing the Ru nanoparticles as a counter electrode showed an efficiency of 6.77%, which is comparable to the efficiency of DSSCs utilizing Pt as a counter electrode. Although the solar cell performance of DSSCs with RuO2 counter electrodes could be improved by the PEO and reduction processes, the best performance is still inferior to that of DSSCs with Pt counter electrodes. The additional conductivity improvement and size control of RuO2 nanoparticle are required.
