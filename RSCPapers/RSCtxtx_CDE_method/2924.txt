Forming nano-scale interpenetrating networks in electron donor/acceptor blends via phase-separation tuning and maintaining their optimal morphology are of paramount importance for the favorable performance and operational lifetime of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells. In this work, two fulleropyrrolidine derivatives that bear π-conjugated terthiophene (3T) and two hexyl (H) or ethylhexyl (EH) chains, abbreviated as 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60, are separately used as a compatibilizer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The effect of the loading of such an agent on the photovoltaic properties of solar devices and the morphological stability of the P3HT/PCBM blend was examined. The substitution of PCBM with a tiny amount of 3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60 apparently enhances the short-circuit current density, reflecting the formation of small PCBM clusters within the P3HT matrix. More importantly, optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and photoluminescence measurements verify that the presence of 1 wt% 3T-H-C60 or 3 wt% 3T-EH-C60 effectively hinders the thermal motion of PCBM molecules to form micro-scale clusters, leading to an extremely stable morphology even under long-term exposure to elevated temperatures. Accordingly, the power conversion efficiencies of P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 and P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 devices remain very steady during prolonged aging at 130 °C. This work provides valuable guidelines for the design of an effective compatibilizer for thermally stable polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells.

Efficient bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have undergone explosive growth owing to their numerous favorable properties, including their light weight, flexibility, low-cost production, and usefulness as an eco-friendly energy source. Moreover, they are superior to silicon and other photovoltaic technologies in terms of long-term sustainability and energy payback time. The nanostructured active layer in PSCs normally comprises a conjugated polymer as an electron donor (D) and an aggregated fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor (A), forming a bi-continuous interpenetrating network. The most commonly used D–A composite is a blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and solar cells based on this blend yield a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼5%. Another interesting approach is to use a conjugated diblock copolymer which consists of both n-type and p-type polymeric segments as the photoactive material, providing molecular D–A junctions to replace a physically mixed active layer. Recent advances in the synthesis of low-band-gap conjugated polymers and novel fullerene derivatives further improve the PCE of lab-scale devices to more than 9%. A long operational lifetime is indispensable to the commercialization of high-efficiency cells. Although the long-term stability of PSCs is determined by numerous parameters such as the degradation of donor/acceptor materials, interfaces and electrodes, the morphology of D–A blends has been identified as the key factor affecting the device performance. For instance, exposure to intense sunlight and/or high-temperature aging may disorganize the optimal morphology by causing crystallization of polymer chains and diffusion of acceptor molecules out of the polymer matrix to form large clusters, resulting in severe phase separation that reduces the size of the D–A interface and destroys the transport pathways of free carriers, degrading the performance of the PSC.

Recently, several efforts have been made to establish a rational strategy for improving the environmental stability of solar devices by stabilizing the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) film morphology. Sivula et al. applied a small amount of dihexyl-functionalized thiophene as a co-monomer to reduce the regioregularity of P3HT from >96% to 91%, suppress the crystallization-induced phase separation and enhance the thermal stability of BHJ devices. Kim et al. copolymerized 2-bromo-3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene and 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene to prepare bromine-functionalized P3HT, which can be cross-linked upon irradiation under UV light, restricting the thermal motion of fullerene acceptors and the consequent formation of large clusters, preserving long-term performance. Bertho et al. employed high-glass-transition-temperature poly(phenylene vinylene) as a donor that freezes the morphology of D–A blends after the film formation process. Some amorphous fullerene derivatives have been designed to limit the growth of fullerene crystals during thermal aging, stabilizing the film morphology and enhancing the device stability. He et al. reported a thermal crosslinker that can bridge PC61BM molecules via a heat-triggered Diels–Alder reaction, lowering the ability of fullerene cages to aggregate, achieving a stable BHJ. A similar method involves the chemical grafting of crosslinkable moieties, such as styrene and epoxide, onto a fullerene acceptor. However, these methods have several drawbacks, such as reducing the carrier mobility, decreasing the crystallinity and yielding a sub-optimal D–A morphology, leading to poor device performance.
Several molecules have been employed as additives and aggregation inhibitors in D–A blends to provide a thermally stable morphology. Another important approach to improving the morphological stability of the active layer is the adoption of copolymers as an interfacial compatibilizer to minimize the destructive segregation of phase domains. Sivula et al. used amphiphilic diblock copolymers that incorporated fullerene and a P3HT macromonomer as an interface-active agent to lower the interfacial energy between the polymer and fullerene and thereby succeeded in preventing thermal phase segregation. Yang et al. presented the use of rod–coil block copolymers consisting of P3HT and C60 chromophores as a surfactant to control the interface morphology of the phase domains in the P3HT/PCBM composite. Lee et al. synthesized C60-end-capped P3HT as a comptabilizing agent for a P3HT/PCBM blend film, reducing the interfacial tension within the active layer and improving the long-term thermal stability of the device. Recently, Palermo et al. synthesized a gradient sequence π-conjugated copolymer containing PCBM pendants as an effective compatibilizer for P3HT/PCBM physical blends to suppress micron-scale phase separation and improve the stability in BHJ solar cells. The preparation of such polymeric compatibilizers typically involves complicated multiple synthetic steps and a tedious purification procedure, and the large insulating groups can inhibit charge carrier transport, reducing the Jsc value. Furthermore, few compatibilizers that are based on C60-derived small molecules have been reported upon.
We very recently developed two series of functionalized fulleropyrrolidines that bear one terthiophene (3T) or a dithienyl thienothiophene (2TTT) conjugated unit together with two hexyl (H) or ethylhexyl (EH) solubilizing groups, abbreviated as 3T-H-C60, 3T-EH-C60, 2TTT-H-C60 and 2TTT-EH-C60, as sole acceptors of P3HT, and established that these thiophene-derived substituents on C60 greatly enhance its miscibility with P3HT, resulting in a highly stable blend morphology. In this work, 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60 are further utilized as compatibilizing agents of the P3HT donor and the PCBM acceptor and a tiny amount of these molecules is demonstrated effectively to shield PCBM molecules from harsh intermolecular aggregation, reducing the sizes of the phase domains and enhancing the photocurrent. More interestingly, these blends possess a robust morphology in high-temperature environments so BHJ devices that are derived from them retain their performance exceedingly reliably upon prolonged heating at 130 °C.

PCBM (>99%) and regioregular P3HT were purchased from Nano-C and used as received. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS) was obtained as Clevios P VP AI 4083 from HC Stark and filtered via a 0.25 mm PVDF syringe filter before spin-coating. The detailed synthesis and characterization of 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60 were described in our previous paper.


The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of polymer solar cells were measured under AM1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 on a Keithley 2400 instrument. AM1.5G solar irradiation was generated using a 300 W solar simulator (Oriel 91160), and the 100 mW cm−2 light intensity was calibrated by using a mono-silicon reference cell with a KG5 filter (PV Measurements, Inc.), which was precalibrated by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The UV-visible spectra were measured by using a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer. Optical microscopic (OM) images were recorded on a homemade microscope. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were captured using a Hitachi H-7100 microscope. The TEM samples were prepared by spin-coating the D–A blend solution onto a PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO, before being immersed into a water bath to partially dissolve the PEDOT:PSS layer. The BHJ film floating on the surface of the water was then picked up with a TEM copper grid, and dried at room temperature.


The polymer solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass as an anode and a Ca/Al as a cathode. The ITO coated glasses were cleaned by a sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min each. Then, PEDOT:PSS was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and spin-coated at a spin-rate of 3500 rpm for 30 s on top of the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air, and then moved into a glovebox. Different ratios of fulleropyrrolidine, 3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60, (0 to 5 wt% with respect to the amount of PCBM) were blended into P3HT/PCBM in a mixed solvent comprising 20% o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 80% chlorobenzene (CB) to form homogeneous solutions. They were then filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 800 rpm for 30 s on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. These devices were thermally annealed at various times at 130 °C, followed by capping with Ca (∼20 nm) and then Al (∼60 nm) in a thermal evaporator at a base pressure of 10−6 Pa. The active area of the devices is 0.07 cm2.


Two fulleropyrrolidines, 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60, were synthesized by using the Prato reaction and their chemical structures are presented in Fig. 1. They were used as a capitalizing additive to control the morphology of the P3HT/PCBM blend. Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with a device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/PCBM:(3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60)/Ca/Al. Fig. 2 plots the J–V curves of these devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The P3HT/PCBM device without an additive gives an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 653 ± 5 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.6 ± 0.11 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 69.3 ± 0.3, yielding a PCE of 3.46 ± 0.03%. When 3 wt% of the PCBM in the active layer is replaced with 3T-EH-C60, Jsc increases from 7.66 ± 0.11 to 8.24 ± 0.09 mA cm−2; further increasing the 3T-EH-C60 loading to 5 wt% causes the Jsc value to decrease slightly, but it remains higher than that of the P3HT/PCBM device. The presence of 3T-EH-C60 does not affect Voc but the FF monotonously decreases as the 3T-EH-C60 content increases. By comparison, the Jsc of the device with 1 wt% 3T-H-C60 is improved by ∼6% to 8.1 ± 0.11 mA. However, the presence of 5 wt% of 3T-H-C60 significantly worsens all of the photovoltaic parameters, causing an S-shaped J–V curve, and dramatically degrading the device performance, yielding a very poor PCE of 0.48 ± 0.08%. This abnormal curve may arise from the relatively poor solubility of 3T-H-C60, which may therefore precipitate to the bottom of the active layer during the spin-drying process. The formation of a 3T-H-C60-rich layer blocks the pathways of holes to the anode, resulting in unbalanced electron and hole mobilities inside the cell.

The photovoltaic characteristics shown in Table 1 also reveal that the P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 devices outperform the P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 devices in terms of FF, which is essentially determined by two components – series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). One straightforward method for estimating the values of Rs and Rsh is to find the reciprocals of the slopes of the J–V curve of the studied cell at the Voc and Jsc points, respectively. In both systems, Rs increases with the fullerene additive content in the P3HT/PCBM blend, primarily because the intrinsic electron mobility of pristine 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60 is lower than that of PCBM, as reported elsewhere. Similarly, the fulleropyrrolidines worsen the Rsh in the 3T-H-C60 device at a rate that is much higher than in the 3T-EH-C60 device. This result can again be explained by the above assumption that the 3T-H-C60-rich domains close to the bottom of the active layer block the smooth transport of holes to the ITO electrode, increasing the probability of recombination of charge carriers. To gain insights into the two systems, the hole and electron mobilities in P3HT/PCBM blend films with different loadings of 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60 were measured from the hole-only and electron-only diodes with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/PCBM:(3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60)/Au and Al/P3HT/PCBM:(3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60)/Al, respectively, using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. S1 in ESI plots the dependence of the dark current on the applied voltage, and the determined values of mobilities are listed in Table 2. As expected, the electron mobility decreases as the fulleropyrrolidine content increases to a similar extent in both systems. Conversely, the hole mobility decreases more rapidly in the P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 than in the P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 films. Adding 5 wt% 3T-H-C60 reduces the hole mobility by approximately one order of magnitude to 2.61 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, giving rise to a very high ratio of electron to hole mobilities of 12.6. These findings agree closely with the trends of Jsc and FF that are observed in both BHJ solar cells.

The above results demonstrate that the presence of 1 wt% 3T-H-C60 or 3 wt% 3T-EH-C60 maximally improves the performance of the P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cells. The long-term thermal stability of these two systems is investigated herein by heating them on top of a digitally controlled hot plate at 130 °C for various periods in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Their photovoltaic properties were obtained under simulated AM1.5 illumination at an intensity of one sun. Fig. 3(a–d) plot the variations of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE with heating time. Consistent with the results published elsewhere, both the Jsc and the FF of the parent P3HT/PCBM cell degrade rapidly as the aging time increases, causing the PCE of the cell to decrease dramatically to 1.8% after 20 h of isothermal heating. In contrast, BHJ cells with either 3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60 exhibit a very stable device performance against long-term aging in a high-temperature environment. The PCE of the 3T-EH-C60 device remains almost the same upon thermal annealing for 1200 min, while that of the 3T-H-C60 device decreases by only 7%.

Optical microscopy (OM) was used to study the effects of 1 wt% 3T-H-C60 and 3 wt% 3T-EH-C60 on the change in the morphology of P3HT/PCBM blend films upon thermal aging at 130 °C for 0 to 20 h. Fig. 4 reveals that the as-spun D–A blend films in all of the devices of interest are featureless. Upon heating for 240 min, the entire surface of the P3HT/PCBM film becomes covered with a few micron-sized needle-shaped aggregates whose number and size increase continuously with aging time. The formation of these large clusters reduces the area of the D–A interface and degrades the carrier transport pathways, causing poor device performance. These micro scale aggregates have already been confirmed as PCBM-rich domains by various techniques. On the other hand, the films of P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 and P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 have an uniform heterojunction morphology with minute size and a lower number of clusters, even following prolonged thermal aging, confirming that a small amount of 3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60 can greatly enhance the morphological stability of P3HT/PCBM against prolonged high-temperature aging. These observations suggest that the terthiophene unit and C60 cage in 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60, which are structural analogues of the P3HT donor and the PCBM acceptor, respectively, enable these fulleropyrrolidine derivatives to act as an effective compatibilizer in the D–A blend.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the nano-morphologies of thermally aged P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 (1 wt%) and P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 (3 wt%) blends. All sample films have a phase-separated structure of bright P3HT-rich domains and dark PCBM-rich domains, forming interpenetrating polymer and fullerene-cluster networks, as shown in Fig. 5. During long-term annealing at 130 °C, PCBM moieties diffuse together to form micron-sized PCBM-rich aggregates in the P3HT/PCBM blend, as presented in the insets. The heating of systems with either 1 wt% 3T-H-C60 or 3 wt% 3T-EH-C60 has only a weak effect on the heterogeneous morphology of P3HT/PCBM, slightly increasing the number of meso-scale PCBM-rich domains. These results were in line with the OM images above, from which the addition of an appropriate amount of 3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60 was determined to suppress effectively the macrophase separation in the P3HT/PCBM blend and thereby improve the long-term thermal stability of solar cell performance.

Fig. 6 displays the effect of heating time on the photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of BHJ solar cells that are based on P3HT/PCBM, P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 (1 wt%) and P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 (3 wt%). For all three systems, the integrated current densities that were calculated from the IPCE spectra are consistent with the Jsc values that were determined from the J–V curves. All of the IPCE spectra are similar in shape and include one small band in the UV region, 300–400 nm, along with one strong and broad band in the visible region, 400–650 nm. The former is ascribed to the monoadduct of C60 and its terthiophene substituent; the latter is attributed to the P3HT donor. A comparison of Fig. 6(a) with Fig. 6(b) and (c) indicates that the devices with 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60 have robust IPCE values over the entire range of wavelengths of interest against high temperatures, whereas thermal aging significantly reduces the IPCE of the P3HT/PCBM device.
To elucidate the morphological stability of the photoactive D–A blends, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the active layers, which were maintained at 130 °C for various intervals, were measured under an excitation light with a wavelength of 550 nm. As shown in Fig. 7, the integrated intensity under the PL spectrum of the parent P3HT/PCBM film increases with heating time, verifying a marked decrease in the area of the interface between the polymer donor and the fullerene acceptor that is caused by thermally induced macro-scale phase separation, thus diminishing the dissociation efficiency of excitons that are created in the P3HT. Consistent with the OM and TEM images, the emission intensities from both P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 and P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 films remain almost unchanged upon heating at 130 °C. The absence of any correlation between the emission intensity and the duration of thermal treatment in Fig. 7(b) and (c) arises primarily from the experimental error that is associated with these PL studies on account of the slight variation in the position of the sample and the thickness of the films among measurements.
The influence of thermal aging on the charge transporting characteristics in the active layers was investigated by fabricating hole-only and electron-only devices from P3HT/PCBM, P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 and P3HT/PCBM–3T-EH-C60 blends, to evaluate independently their carrier mobilities by the SCLC method. Fig. S2 plots the dependence of current density on the applied voltage; Table 3 presents the obtained mobility values. Twenty hours of heating of the P3HT/PCBM cells reduces the hole mobility to about half of its original value but the electron mobility decreases by more than one order of magnitude from 4.92 × 10−4 to 1.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, resulting in extremely unbalanced charge carrier mobilities. This finding clearly reveals that the PCBM molecules aggregate at elevated temperatures to yield micro-sized clusters, which are seen in the OM and TEM images, seriously destroying the continuous pathways of electrons to the cathode and degrading the cell performance. Conversely, the hole and electron mobilities in both P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 and P3HT/PCBM–3T-EH-C60 films are moderately reduced at similar rates upon heating. Therefore, relatively both hole and electron mobilities are maintained. This fact demonstrates that both 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60 are promising compatibilizers of P3HT and PCBM that can retard the thermally driven aggregation of PCBM molecules and stabilize the blend morphology.

This work demonstrated that the fulleropyrrolidine derivatives, 3T-H-C60 and 3T-EH-C60, which comprise a conjugated terthiophene moiety and a C60 cage, can be utilized as effective compatibilizing agents for P3HT and PCBM. Replacing a small amount of the PCBM acceptor with 3T-H-C60 or 3T-EH-C60 substantially improves the morphological stability of the D–A blends by suppressing the formation of large PCBM clusters even after prolonged aging at high temperature. As a result, the BHJ solar cells that are fabricated from the P3HT/PCBM:3T-H-C60 (1 wt%) and P3HT/PCBM:3T-EH-C60 (3 wt%) blends exhibit superbly steady PCEs, which decrease by less than 7% over 20 h at 130 °C. This approach enables the continuous use of PCBM as a universal acceptor of polymer donors, retaining its good electron mobility and adequate solubility in common processing solvents. Moreover, the results herein open up a new avenue for designing effective fullerene-based compatibilizers for next-generation low-bandgap polymers to realize high-efficiency and long-life polymer solar cells.
