Two ferrocenyl benzimidazoles with carboxylic (1) and nitro (2) anchors have been synthesized and characterized using microanalyses, IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and in one case using single crystal X-ray diffraction. UV-Vis spectroscopic studies indicate that in comparison to ferrocene the electronic absorption bands of the synthesized 1 and 2 dyes are bathochromically shifted up to 530 nm with concomitant enhancement in their intensities. The synthesized dyes have been exploited as a photosensitizer in TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The photovoltaic performances and charge transport properties (EIS spectra) were studied to evaluate the synthesized dye performance in DSSCs. Amongst both the dyes, the one with the carboxylic anchor showed relatively superior photovoltaic performance in comparison to the dye with a nitro anchor. The superior performance of 1 is probably due to the better anchorage and superior dye loading capability on the TiO2 surface, which suppresses charge recombination, prolongs electron lifetime, and decreases the total resistance of the DSSC. The assembly fabricated using 1 showed the best performance with an overall conversion efficiency η of 5.81%, Jsc of 12.74 mA cm−2, and Voc of −0.648 V. The obtained efficiency is ∼84% of the cell efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art N719 dye in similar conditions.

After the pioneering report by Grätzel and co-workers on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) the research on the development of photo-sensitizers has achieved significant progression, with photon-to-current conversion efficiencies improving up to 11% by using ruthenium(II) (polypyridyl) complexes. However, the high cost and toxicity of Ru(II) limits their applications in the field of DSSCs. Recently, DSSC devices comprising zinc-porphyrin sensitizers achieved an efficiency of ca. 12% by employing the Co2+/Co3+ redox mediator under standard conditions. But again the complicated synthetic procedure and low yield of porphyrin sensitizers restrict their widespread use in DSSCs. Also, using a co-sensitization strategy, an efficiency of up to 14.7% has been reported using ADEKA-1 dye with a carbazole/alkyl-functionalized oligothiophene/alkoxysilyl-anchor as a photosensitizer and LEG-4 dye with a carboxy-anchor as a co-sensitizer.

In view of these observations, research efforts have been aimed toward improving the efficiency by optimizing the dye architecture, and selecting a suitable redox mediator, photoanode, and counter electrode material. For instance, the dye architecture can be tuned to improve the molar extinction coefficient and the solar light harvesting capacity by modifying its chromophoric as well as anchoring group which can improve the photocurrent and efficiency of DSSCs.
We are interested in deploying ferrocene as a possible sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and reported the light harvesting properties of the homo- and heteroleptic complexes of ferrocenyl dithiocarbamates, as well as their organomercury(II) derivatives. Also, we have reported ferrocene with dithiocarbamate and dithiocarbonate as anchors in DSSCs. In addition to these sulfur derivatives, π-conjugated derivatives of ferrocene and biferrocene with different anchors have been reported by our group. In addition to our reports Mishra et al. have reported ferrocenyl-substituted triphenylamine-based donor–acceptor dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells. Sirbu et al. reported DSSCs fabricated using a trisubstituted ferrocene-based porphyrin derivative with a Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte, with modest conversion efficiency; Cariello and co-workers have designed some ferrocenyl-based dyes and investigated the role of π-conjugation in the conversion efficiency. The choice of using ferrocene derivatives as the sensitizer is because of its well-defined reversible one-electron redox process and electron donating properties. As the formal reduction potential of the ferrocenyl group is dependent on the nature of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring, the redox potential can be tuned to obtain the desired potential for a specific application.
In continuation to our development program for photosensitizers comprising ferrocene we found that although imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives have been used in DSSCs ferrocenyl-substituted benzimidazoles have been reported with sensing applications and yet their role as a possible photo-sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells has not been explored. Hence, we thought of deploying the ferrocenyl-conjugated benzimidazole systems with –COOH and –NO2 as anchoring groups in dye-sensitized solar cells. This work was undertaken due to two important reasons: (1) it has the conjugated framework which offers improvement in the charge-transfer transition from the auxiliary electron donor to first electron donor; (2) charge recombination after electron injection may be retarded because of decreasing positive charge density at the donor by electronic delocalization by the aromatic ring. We believe that these two important points will prove worthy when these dyes are explored for real world applications and therefore we wish to report the synthesis, characterization, and light harvesting properties of two ferrocenyl benzimidazole dyes with –COOH and –NO2 anchors.

Ferrocenyl benzimidazoles 1 and 2 comprising –COOH or –NO2 anchors, respectively, were prepared by acid-catalyzed condensation of the appropriate 1,2-diamino benzene with –COOH and –NO2 functionals with ferrocene carboxaldehyde (Scheme 1). Both the compounds were air stable and were characterized by IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and in one case the structure was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.


The purity and composition of both complexes have been examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy performed in DMSO-d6. Both the compounds display well-resolved 1H NMR signals which integrate with the corresponding hydrogens. The IR spectra of the compounds display bands at around 3100 cm−1 which correspond to the N–H vibrations in the imidazole ring and the position of the signal corresponding to the N–H proton depends on the nature of the electron withdrawing moiety attached to the imidazole ring. In the case of 1 the band at ∼2968 cm−1 corresponds to the O–H stretching of the carboxylic group while the band at ∼1711 cm−1 can be ascribed to ν(CO)as. In the case of 2, the bands at 1518 cm−1 and 1337 cm−1 can be attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes respectively of the –NO2 group. Additionally, the TGA data (Fig. S1 and S2 ESI) indicate the thermal stability of both the sensitizers up to ∼200 °C.


Single crystals of 2 were obtained by slow evaporation of a dichloromethane–ethanol mixture (50:50 v/v). The X-ray structural analysis of 2 (Fig. 1) indicates that it crystallizes in the trigonal system having P3121 space group. The bonded benzimidazole and the cyclopentadiene rings are essentially planar with a dihedral angle of 2.27°, which indicates strong electronic communication operating between the ferrocenyl moiety and nitro group through the benzimidazole spacer. These X-ray parameters suggest that these ferrocenyl benzimidazole derivatives may be utilized in DSSCs as electronic communication is one of the important prerequisites for a molecule to be used as sensitizer.


The electronic absorption spectra of the dyes in dichloromethane are presented in Fig. 2. The electronic absorption spectra for both the sensitizers display a prominent band located at ∼450 nm which arises due to the d → d (assigned to the 1E1g ← 1A1g) transition. However, in comparison to ferrocene, the absorption band in these dyes gets red shifted. This bathochromic shifting may be attributed to extensive π-conjugation operating from ferrocene up to the aromatic benzimidazole linkage thereby leading to the strong electronic communication in the molecule. This red shifting in the electronic absorption band corresponding to ferrocene provides impetus to use these molecules as potential sensitizers in DSSCs.

The electronic absorption spectra of the dyes recorded on TiO2 film (Fig. 3) indicate slight broadening as well as minor bathochromic shift which may be because of the aggregation or electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. Also, the IR spectra of both the dyes after adsorption on TiO2 film displayed significant shifting of ν(CO)asymm. from 1711 cm−1 to ∼1610 cm−1 in the case of 1 and slight shifting of ν(NO2)asymm. from 1518 cm−1 to 1500 cm−1 and ν(NO2)symm. from 1337 cm−1 to 1310 cm−1 in the case of 2. These spectral shifts indicate the binding of 1 and 2 by –COOH and –NO2 groups, respectively on TiO2 film.
In order to gain insight into the nature of transitions in both the molecules time-dependent density functional theory calculations have been performed. The selected orbital transition obtained from the TD-DFT calculations and the nature of these transitions are presented in Table 1. In both cases the HOMO is mainly located at the ferrocenyl center and the LUMO is present at the benzimidazole ring comprising –COOH and –NO2 anchors to different extents (Table 1).

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are important parameters of the photosensitizer for the estimation of the thermodynamic feasibility of dye regeneration and the electron transfer process in DSSCs. To assess the energies of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the dyes, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in a three-electrode cell on an electrochemical workstation using a Pt disc as the working electrode and Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) as the reference electrode in dichloromethane containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate (Fig. 4). The experimental electrochemical parameters of these dyes are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO levels of the dyes 1 and 2 are found to be +0.190 and +0.155 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile, respectively, which are more positive than the I−/I3− redox potential (−0.15 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile). This implies that the oxidized dyes produced from respective electron injection into the CB of TiO2 will favorably accept electrons from I− ions. On the other hand, it is apparent that the excited state of the dyes is sufficiently negative (−2.56 to −2.54 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile) compared to the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.75 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in ACN), which ensures an energetically favorable electron injection from the photo-excited dye into the conduction band TiO2. Generally, a minimum driving force of 0.2 V is enough to ensure fast excited-state injection and regeneration of the oxidized dye. Thus, the excited electron injections by both the dyes 1 and 2 are guaranteed to be efficient and the regeneration of their oxidized form is also proficient. The schematic energy level diagram for 1 and 2 based on the dye absorption spectrum and electrochemical data is presented in Fig. 5 which indicates that these ferrocenyl benzimidazole dyes have appropriate electronic energy levels to be deployed as promising sensitizers in DSSCs.

To assess the electron injection mechanism we performed density of states (DOS) calculations of (TiO2)30, dyes 1 and 2 as well as the dye + (TiO2)30 systems. The DOS for all of the investigated systems are presented in Fig. 6. When compared to the DOS of the cluster (Fig. 6), the DOS of the dyes shows clearly localized states, which are all occupied (Fig. 6). In the case of dye + (TiO2)30, the DOS plot clearly indicates the core states, valence band (VB), and conduction band (CB). The fundamental TiO2 valence band is located at the energy levels roughly between −10.0 eV and −8.2 eV, and the conduction band is located starting from −4.2 eV. From the DOS plot for the bare (TiO2)30 cluster, clear separation between the VB and CB without any gap states is observed. The adsorption of the dyes onto the nanoparticle surface introduces occupied states at the lower part of the nanoparticle band gap and extending the valence states from around −8.2 eV to −5.5 eV for 1 + (TiO2)30 and −8.2 eV to −5.7 eV for 2 + (TiO2)30. Based on the DOS plots (Fig. 6), it can concluded that lower energy electrons are excited from the VB energy levels approximately between −8.2 and −5.7 to −5.5 eV for dye + (TiO2)30 and then transferred to CB states above −4.2 eV. Based on the DOS plot, the minimum inter-band excitation energy lies in the range of 1.3–1.5 eV for the dye + (TiO2)30 systems. The results of DOS indicate significant electronic coupling between the LUMO of the dyes and the CB of TiO2, however, this electronic coupling is slightly weaker in 2 having the –NO2 anchor.


The performance of DSSCs with the ferrocenyl benzimidazole dyes as photosensitizers was evaluated under standard conditions and the relevant photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2. The higher Jsc and IPCE values observed for these dyes are consistent with their absorption properties. The overall power conversion efficiency of 1 and 2 are 5.81 and 3.71 mA cm−2, respectively. The difference in cell efficiencies for both dyes is due to the different anchoring group attached to benzimidazole entity. Dye 1 with a carboxylic group shows better photovoltaic performance due to its better dye-loading capacity on the surface of TiO2 and consequently the light-harvesting propensity. The low efficiency of dye 2 (with nitro as the anchoring group) is due to the higher electron-withdrawing –NO2 group, which is also responsible for the low charge injection into the TiO2 band edge that corresponds to the lowering in Jsc value (Fig. 7).

The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs sensitized with all the dyes were covered in the region 400–700 nm and were consistent with the J–V curves. The close resemblance of the absorption spectrum of the complex with the respective action spectrum (IPCE) except for a slight red shift by ca. 3–4 nm, confirms the sensitization of the photocurrent by dye. The strong absorption of blue light by I−/I3− electrolyte is considered to decrease the IPCE value in the short wavelength region, resulting in the red shift of the peak in the action spectrum. The DSSCs with dyes 1 and 2 showed IPCE maxima of 59% at 469 nm and 52% at 472 nm, respectively. These IPCE values obtained under short-circuit conditions can be increased if the semiconductor photoanode is externally biased with positive potential. The absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE) for the solar cell system is the measure of the number of absorbed photons that are converted into the current. The APCE parameters can be calculated by dividing the IPCE by the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) value. Thus,
APCE(λ) = IPCE(λ)/LHE
LHE(λ) = 1 − 10–A
where
A is the absorbance of the dye on TiO2 at the maximum wavelength.

The higher LHE value can be attributed to the maximum dye adsorption which in turn contributes to the higher IPCE and Jsc. The higher IPCE value of the cell with photosensitizer using 1 is because of the higher APCE value (Fig. 8) in comparison to the sensitizer 2.
In our previous investigations, we have synthesized transition-metal as well as phenylmercury(II) ferrocenyl dithiocarbamates having ferrocene deprived of suitable anchoring groups. These systems display modest photosensitizing ability through remote sensing or physical adsorption on the TiO2 surface with spectral response in the range of 400–440 nm. Our recent investigation with phenylmercury(II) methylferrocenyldithiocarbamates with –OH linker enhances the photovoltaic performance. To overcome the anchoring problem we had also designed π-extended ferrocenes with varied anchoring groups which provided better anchorage and hence gave relatively better results. With the ferrocenyl benzimidazole dyes presented herein we succeeded in broadening the spectral response in the visible region from 400 nm upto 530 nm. The presented results are encouraging which clearly indicates that the photovoltaic parameters of ferrocenyl benzimidazoles as photosensitizers are almost comparable to the N719 dye and these ferrocenyl-based dyes with some fine modifications may become a promising candidate for achieving high cell performance, low-cost production, and non-toxicity.

The electron transport properties of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (DSSCs) and its correlation with the performance of the cell have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), executed at their open circuit potential (OCP) over a frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz under AM 1.5. The Nyquist and Bode plots for the dye 1 and 2 sensitized cells are shown in Fig. 9a and b, respectively. With the bias voltage applied, the first small semicircle is attributed to charge-transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface, and the second larger semicircle at middle frequencies to the charge recombination processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface in light decreases, with decreasing semicircle diameter. The decreasing trend of charge transport resistance in the middle frequency region is 1 > 2, which is in accordance with the obtained Jsc values shown in Table 3 and indicates that the recombination rate is in the order 2 > 1.

This is the main reason for the higher Voc value of 1 (0.648 V) than that of 2 (0.628 V). The Bode phase plots (Fig. 9b) were plotted in order to determine the effective lifetime (τeff) and charge-transfer process of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. Further the higher Voc of 1 can further be explained by electron lifetime. The value of the frequency for dyes 1 and 2 is 25.23 and 29.06 Hz, respectively, with effective life times of 6.31 and 5.48 ms, respectively, using the following equation.
τeff = 1/2πf
where the frequency (
f) corresponds to maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak in the Bode phase plot. The longer electron lifetimes of dye 1 could explain the significant enhancement in Voc for the dye 1 sensitized cell in comparison with that of dye 2 (as shown in Table 3). The cell based on dye 1 with the –COOH linker group attached to ferrocenyl benzimidazole was able to inject electrons efficiently with a superior electronic pathway as well as the lowest electron transport resistance value, which acts as an impetus for highest Jsc and Voc compared to 2.


To determine the sustainability of the photocurrent the transient current–time profiles were recorded at intermittent dark and light conditions and the short circuit current was monitored with the passage of time. Fig. 10 shows the current–time (J–t) profiles for dyes 1 and 2. The cell constructed with dye 1 showed a stable photocurrent whereas a small decay (∼3–4%) in photocurrent was observed in the cases of the cell with dye 2. The experimental decay in photocurrent in the latter case is probably because of the charge carrier-recombination. In the dark, the response of dye 1 shows a lack of sharpness compared to that of dye 2 from which we can infer the slowness of the dye regeneration process as compared to the rate of charge carrier-injection by the excited dye molecules (inset).


OCVD studies are a significant tool to explore the interfacial recombination processes between injected electrons (to the conduction band of TiO2) and the electrolyte and provides some quantifiable insight into the electron recombination rate in DSSCs. The OCVD decay curves of the DSSCs based on the different dye sensitized photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. 11. The study showed that the OCVD response of dye 1 is slower than that of dye 2. Due to charge recombination the decay of Voc is observed as a decrease in electron concentration. The dye 1 sensitized photoelectrode has a lower electron recombination rate than the dye 2 sensitized photoanode, which is favorable for improving the performance of DSSCs.


Based on the findings of the present investigation it can be concluded that the synthesized ferrocenyl benzimidazole dyes with two different anchoring groups can act as donor type sensitizers and with the use of these dyes, the spectral response of a wide band gap TiO2 electrode can be extended well into the visible region (up to 530 nm wavelength). The sensitization effect of these dyes has been evidenced by their photo-action spectra. Although we have succeeded to achieve ∼84% of the cell efficiency of N719 dye but with some fine modifications, these dyes may become a promising candidate for achieving high cell performance, low-cost production, and non-toxicity. Hence enhancement in the spectral response in the visible region, a suitable anchoring group, electron communication properties and low lying LUMO levels, make these ferrocenyl benzimidazole systems an attractive candidate for enhancing the cell efficiency in DSSCs.


All chemicals and reagents were commercially available and used without further purification. Ferrocene carboxaldehyde, 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxy acetophenone, and 2- and 4-acetyl pyridine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Solvents were distilled in accordance with the standard procedure.


Elemental analyses were performed using a Perkin-Elmer 240 C, H, N analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded as KBr pellets on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on BRUKER Avance III FTNMR spectrophotometer. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million using TMS as an internal standard. The electronic absorption spectra in dichloromethane solution were recorded using a SPECORD 210 PLUS BU UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemistry was carried out using a Pt working electrode, a Pt rod counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as a working electrode. All the electrochemical experiments were carried out in dichloromethane. In all cases TBAP (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. After each experiment the reference electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple which was found to be at 0.55 V. The photoelectrochemical performance, including the short-circuit current (Jsc, mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (Voc, V), fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η) were determined from the J–V curve obtained by using a digital Keithley 236 mm under irradiation of white light from a 1000 W/HS Xenon arc lamp with a 100 mW cm−2 light intensity with 1.5 AM. The maximum output power (Pmax) was obtained by choosing a point on the J–V curve corresponding to which the product of current (Jmax) and voltage (Vmax) is maximum. The power conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF) were evaluated using the following relations:
Here
Jsc, Voc, and Iinc are short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit potential, and intensity of incident light respectively.

To avoid spurious light reflections and refractions, a black mask was used for the cell on the illuminated side and also covered the side area of the cell, which largely contribute to the cell response and lead to erroneous interpretation. The reproducibility and reliability of all results were confirmed by realizing three cells of each 1 and 2 sensitized photoanode and keeping all structural and photovoltaic characterization identical. The active area of the cells was 0.25 cm2.
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by using a 300 W Xe lamp light source joined to a monochromator (Oriel). A reference Si photodiode calibrated for spectral response was used for the monochromatic power-density calibration. From the values of Jsc and the intensity of the corresponding monochromatic light (Iinc), the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated at each excitation wavelength (λ) using the following relation:
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a CH 660C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a two-electrode configuration. The photoanode was used as a working electrode and the Pt electrode as a counter electrode. The electron transport properties were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with 10 mV alternative signal in the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz.

To a mixture of ferrocene carboxaldehyde (0.214 g, 1 mmol) and 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (0.152 g, 1 mmol) in ethanol (2.5 mL), 0.05 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was added and the mixture was heated at 80 °C with stirring for 24 h. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, distilled water was added into the reaction mixture to obtain a light orange precipitate which was filtered and washed with distilled water 4 times. The product was purified by chromatography using dichloromethane to obtain 1.

The same procedure was applied for a mixture of ferrocene carboxaldehyde (0.214 g, 1 mmol) and 4-nitrobenzene-1,2-diamine (0.153 g, 1 mmol) to obtain a dark red precipitate of 2.

Transparent conductive glass plates coated with F-doped SnO2 (FTO, purchased from Pilkington. Co. Ltd, 8 Ω/γ) were used to prepare both the photo- and counter-electrodes. Commercialized TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T, Solaronix) was casted onto the heat-treated FTO substrates by the doctor-blade technique and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The substrates with thin nanoporous TiO2 layers (∼6 μm) were dipped into a dichloromethane solution of dyes 1 and 2 (1 × 10−5 M) and kept overnight. The unadsorbed dye was washed out with anhydrous ethanol. Pt-layered counter-electrodes were prepared by Pt catalyst (Solaronix), screen printed on FTO, and then sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and platinum coated counter electrodes were sandwiched to each other in a face-to-face manner leaving the space for making contact, to connect with external load. This sandwich-type assembly was sealed from all sides by using the hot melt sealant/spacer and the electrolytic solution (an electrolyte composed of 0.6 dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile) was injected through a predrilled hole in the counter electrode. Copper wires were fixed on both the electrodes using silver paste and araldite for getting electrical contact.


Intensity data for 2 were collected at 150(2) K on a Rigaku Xcalibur, EosS2 single crystal diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Unit cell determination, data collection, and data reduction were performed using the CrysAlisPro software. For all structures an empirical absorption correction using spherical harmonics was employed. The structures were solved by direct methods (SIR97) and refined by a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 (Shelxl-2014). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed onto calculated positions and refined using a riding model.

In order to ascertain the nature of electronic transition in the ferrocenyl benzimidazole compounds density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. Optimized molecular geometries were calculated using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional. The MDF10 basis set for Fe and 6-31G** basis set for other atoms were used for geometry optimization. The optimized structures of the compounds were used for molecular orbital analyses as well as for the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations using the polarized continuum model (PCM). The solvent parameters of dichloromethane were employed. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programme. The TiO2 cluster(TiO2)30 + 1–2 system was optimized by using the 3-21G* basis set and the initial geometry was taken from the relaxed geometry of the (TiO2)30 cluster and 1–2.
