The effects of the incorporated CdS on the local optoelectronic properties of CH3NH3PbI3:CdS bulk heterojunction (BHJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are studied using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The KPFM and c-AFM results clearly show that as the amount of incorporated CdS increases, the incorporated CdS creates more uniform and compact perovskite films. Moreover, the incorporated CdS nanoparticles lead to a higher surface potential and a more uniform and higher photocurrent distribution on the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS active layer, which indicates that the CdS nanoparticles can lead to more effective photo-generated electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to the CdS and proves experimentally that the CdS nanoparticles can form a continuous photo-generated electron transport channel. The EIS results show that the CdS can effectively decrease the contact resistances at the active layer/electron transport layer and the active layer/hole transport layer interfaces and it helps in the charge collection of the cells, which further confirms that the CdS nanoparticles can play the role of transporting electrons. Our study provides a nanoscale understanding of the improved device performance of CH3NH3PbI3:CdS PSCs.

Lead trihalide perovskite materials (MAPbX3, MA = CH3NH3+; X = Cl−, I−, Br−) have been receiving a great deal of attention due to their high light absorption and long diffusion lengths. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on MAPbX3 has increased to more than 20% from just 3.8% in the past few years. There are usually two device configurations for PSCs, namely the mesoporous scaffold and p–i–n planar heterojunction architectures. For these two structures, the quality of the perovskite materials has a crucial impact on the device performance. So far, considerable efforts have been made to improve the compactness and uniformity of the perovskite layer. Typically, additive methods, solvent engineering methods, heat treatment methods and the temperature-assisted rapid nucleation method were adopted to improve the quality of the perovskite films. Recently, a precursor blending solution method was proposed by our group for the first time to fabricate CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite films, which significantly improved the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 films and thus increased the PCEs of the PSCs. In addition, it has been reported previously that CdS can act as an electron transport layer to enhance the performance of PSCs. However, the most critical mechanisms for understanding these PSCs such as the nanoscale charge generation and transport have not been studied in-depth. Therefore, there still exists a need for understanding the correlation between different CdS incorporation amounts in the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS film and the resulting film morphology and between the nanoscale morphological features and the charge transport/recombination for the newly developed CH3NH3PbI3/CdS bulk-heterojunction PSCs.

To solve these problems, powerful tools are needed to understand the optoelectronic processes occurring in the device at the nanometer scale. Due to the small radius of the probe, scanning probe microscopy techniques, such as Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), can be used to examine the performance of PSCs at the nanoscale, providing a better understanding of the relationship between the nanostructure and the optoelectronic properties. In this study, we further systematically investigate the influence of the CdS incorporation amount on the nanoscale charge generation and transport mechanism in the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS perovskite solar cell by KPFM, c-AFM and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The device structure and energy level alignments are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KPFM, c-AFM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were used to investigate the effect of CdS on the nanoscale morphology and the photoelectric properties of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS composite films while the EIS was used to study the dynamics of photogenerated charge transport/collection in the devices. We found that the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 film depends on the incorporation amount of CdS which creates more uniform and compact perovskite films. Furthermore, the direct charge transfer process from the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals to the CdS nanoparticles and the photo-generated electron transport via the connecting channel of CdS nanoparticles on the nanometer scale in the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS active layer is observed. Moreover, the effect of CdS on the contact resistances at the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/ETL and CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/HTL interfaces is also investigated.

Indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 99.99%), copper iodide (CuI, 99.999%), thiourea (≥99.0%), 1-propionic acid (≥99.5%), n-butylamine (≥99.0%), Al2O3 (20% w/w in isopropanol), and cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 99.0%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, ≥99.5%) and lead iodide (PbI2, ≥99.9%) were purchased from the Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (DCB) and[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM, 95 wt%) were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd, and Luminescence Technology Co, respectively. All the reagents were used without further purification. Copper indium sulfide (CuInS2) precursor solution was synthesized by dissolving the CuI (0.11 mmol), In(OAc)3 (0.1 mmol), and thiourea (0.5 mmol) in a mixture of 1-butylamine (0.6 mL) and 1-propionic acid (40 μL) with stirring at room temperature for 1 min. The perovskite precursor using PbI2 was dissolved in DMF (40% by weight) with a molar ratio of CH3NH3I/PbI2 = 1:1. Then the precursors were stirred and heated at 60 °C overnight. Afterwards, the CdCl2 and thiourea with a molar ratio of 1:3 was added to the perovskite precursor to prepare the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS precursor solution. In this study, a series of CH3NH3PbI3/CdS precursor solutions was obtained when the molar concentrations of CdCl2 were fixed at 0.03, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1 mM. Correspondingly, the prepared film with x mM CdS was denoted as ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x), (x = 0.03, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1).


The ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, acetone, deionized water and ethyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath. CuInS2 layers were prepared by spin-coating the CuInS2 precursor solution on the clean ITO glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 150 °C for 10 min, then heated to 250 °C and held for 15 min. The Al2O3 layers were deposited on the CuInS2/ITO substrate by spin-coating Al2O3 (20% w/w in isopropanol) solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s and they were dried on a hot plate at 150 °C for 20 min. The solar cell structure employed here is ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/PC60BM/Ag. The CH3NH3PbI3:CdS layers were deposited on the Al2O3/CuInS2/ITO substrate by spin-coating the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS precursor solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 100 °C for 30 min. The PC60BM layer was further deposited on the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS films by spin-coating PC60BM/1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) (20 mg mL−1) solution at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the sliver counter electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed as 0.04 cm2, and all device fabrication was conducted under a 40% humidity atmosphere.


The surface morphology and structure of the as-prepared films were characterized using SEM (JSM-7001F, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co, Japan). TEM and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) studies were performed on a JEOL-2010 microscope under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films were recorded using the HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 Spectrofluorometer system with a Xe 900 (450 W xenon arc lamp) as the light source. Time-resolved fluorescence analyses were performed on an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 980 photoluminescence spectrometer. The KPFM and c-AFM measurements were performed using a Bruker AFM (Multimode 8.0, Bruker Co, USA). The model of the probe is ASYELEC-01 and the radius of the silicon probe coated Ti/Ir (5/20) is about 28 nm. All of the AFM measurements were performed in the dark and under illumination at an angle of ∼45°. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the as-prepared solar cells were measured by using a Keithley 2410 source meter (Cleveland, OH, USA) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity is calibrated by using a Si reference cell certificated by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards). All J–V measurements are performed below a relative humidity of 40% and the ITO was taken as the positive electrodes. The J–V characteristics of the prepared solar cells are measured in the forward (from 1.0 V to 0 V) and reverse (from 0 V to 1.0 V) modes at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the fabricated cells was performed using a CHI660E (Chenhua Device Company, Shanghai, China) electrochemical measurement system at room temperature under ambient atmosphere (40% relative humidity) under illumination (100 mW cm−2). The frequencies scanned were in the 1 MHz to 100 mHz range. The resultant impedance spectra were simulated using the Z-view software.


Fig. 2a shows a typical top view SEM image of the prepared ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film without CdS at 50000× magnification. In order to observe the effect of different CdS incorporation amounts on the surface morphology of the film, Fig. 2b–d show the SEM images of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films (x = 0.03, 0.08 and 0.1). From Fig. 2a–d, it can be observed that the compactness of the films increased with the increasing of the CdS incorporation amount, which is consistent with previous results. To further investigate the influence of CdS on the microstructure inside the film, cross-sectional SEM images of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 without CdS and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films with x = 0.06 and 0.1 are displayed in Fig. 2e, which shows a CuInS2 thickness of 150 nm for all three films. It can be observed that there is little difference in the film thicknesses (about 900 nm) of the three films, suggesting that the CdS had little effect on the thicknesses of these three films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS precursor solution penetrated into the pores inside the Al2O3 layer, leading to the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3/CuInS2 and CdS/CuInS2 heterojunctions. More importantly, Fig. 2e shows that the Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS layer is becoming more compact as the amount of CdS increases, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2a–d.
To further investigate the influence of CdS on the surface flatness of the films, the 2-dimensional (2D) AFM height images of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.06) and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.1) films are shown in Fig. 3a–c, respectively. The scan size is 5 μm × 5 μm. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film without CdS, ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.06) and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.1) is 14.1 nm, 12.0 nm and 11.5 nm, respectively. For the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film, Fig. 3a shows that the sizes of the highest (i.e., the purple area) and lowest (i.e., the red area) regions are in the order of several hundred nanometers and the distribution of these areas is not uniform. After the incorporation of CdS, the sizes of these purple and red areas are continuously reduced and the distribution becomes more uniform as the incorporation amount of CdS increases for the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.06) and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.1) films. These results indicate that the surface flatness of the perovskite film is significantly improved with the increase of the CdS incorporation amount.
The TEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS(0.1) composite film is shown in Fig. S1a (ESI). It can be seen that the CdS nanoparticles (marked in yellow circles) have a spherical structure and the CH3NH3PbI3 particles (marked in pink polygons) have a diamond-shaped structure. The CdS size ranges from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers, which is significantly smaller than that (from tens of nanometers to more than one hundred nanometers) of the CH3NH3PbI3 particles. The inset shown in Fig. S1a (ESI) is the HR-TEM image of a single CdS nanoparticle, which reveals a lattice fringe spacing of 0.357 nm, corresponding to the (400) lattice planes of orthorhombic CdS (PDF# 47-1179). In order to further confirm the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 particles, the HR-TEM image of one CH3NH3PbI3 particle is shown in Fig. S1b (ESI), The observed lattice fringe spacing of 0.317 nm can be attributed to the (220) plane of the tetragonal phase of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, which is in agreement with previous report.
To study the effect of the CdS incorporation amount on the electron–hole dynamics at the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface, PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay transients of pure CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) composite films are measured and shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. All the samples show a strong PL peak around 770 nm, in accordance with other reports. As the CdS incorporation amount increases, the PL intensities drop sharply, which has been attributed to the effective charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to CdS. To gain an indepth understanding on the influence of the CdS incorporation amount on the fundamental photo-induced charge transfer process, the time-resolved PL decay transients are measured at 775 nm and shown in Fig. 4b. With increasing x from 0.03 to 0.1, the carrier lifetime of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) composite film increases from 46.27 ns to 91.88 ns, while the carrier lifetime of the pure CH3NH3PbI3 is only 14.85 ns. Moreover, the measured carrier lifetime for the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) composite film is much longer than that (26 ns) for the previously reported CH3NH3PbI3/CdS bilayer film. To explain this result, the charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface is shown in Fig. 4c, which indicates that as more CdS is incorporated, more photogenerated electrons transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to the CdS and then recombine with the holes in the CH3NH3PbI3 through the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface, prolonging the lifetime of the carriers. The time-resolved PL results further confirm that CdS can effectively promote the charge separation in CH3NH3PbI3.
To investigate the influence of CdS on charge transfer and recombination at the nanometer scale, the surface morphology and corresponding surface potential distribution of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films are characterized by KAFM. Fig. 5a–c show the surface morphology of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films for x = 0.03, 0.06 and 0.1, respectively. The corresponding surface potential distributions under dark (upper half) and under illumination (lower half) are shown in Fig. 5d–f, respectively. For all three kinds of CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films, it can be observed that both under illumination and in the dark, the surface potential on the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS grains is more negative than that at the grain boundaries, indicating the existence of local positive charges on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3:CdS grains. Apparently, the positively charged CH3NH3PbI3 boundaries result from the electron transfer from the surface area of the CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticle to the CdS via the CH3NH3PbI3/CdS interface, which can be observed from Fig. 4c. After the photo-generated electron transfer to the CdS, most of the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles is charged by rich electrons due to the deposited CdS, while the junction area (i.e., grain boundaries) between the CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles shows a more positive charge. These results prove the direct charge transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to the CdS on the nanometer scale. To further investigate the effect of the incorporation amount of CdS on the local electrical properties, the line profiles of the surface potential on the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films (x = 0.03, 0.06 and 0.1) are shown in Fig. 5g. It can be seen that, for the single ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) film, the surface potential difference between the grain boundaries and the grains under illumination increases compared to that in the dark, suggesting that more photo-generated electron transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 boundaries to CdS due to the increased light intensity. Moreover, for the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films, the surface potential difference between the grain boundaries and the grains under illumination increases significantly with the increase of x, which indicates that the increase of the incorporation amount of CdS improves the electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to CdS.
To further investigate the influence of CdS on the charge transportation and recombination during the photovoltaic process, the local photocurrent distribution over the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films is measured using c-AFM. Fig. 6 shows the 2-dimensional AFM topographic images and the corresponding surface photocurrent images of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) films (x = 0.03, 0.06 and 0.1) at variable external bias voltages (from −0.1 V to 0.3 V). It can be seen that, as the value of x increases from 0.03 to 0.1, the current distribution of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) film becomes more uniform, which further confirms that the films are becoming more and more uniform and compact with the increase of the incorporation amount of CdS. To investigate the effect of the incorporation amount of CdS on local photocurrent distribution, the summarized distribution of the current at different bias voltages is shown in Fig. 6g, which clearly demonstrates a higher current density as the value of x increases. These results further demonstrate that the film quality and electric property of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x) film are improved with the increase of the incorporated CdS amount. Moreover, these results confirm that the CdS nanoparticles can be connected to form an effective electron transport channel.

Fig. 7 shows the J–V characteristics of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Ag and ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x)/PC60BM/Ag solar cells under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) under a 40% humidity atmosphere. The corresponding device performance parameters such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 1. The ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Ag cell without CdS shows a PCE of 7.7%, with a Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 16.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.56. For the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x)/PC60BM/Ag cells with CdS, as the x value increases from 0.03 to 0.1, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE improve, from 0.89 V, 17.9 mA cm−2, 0.56 and 8.9% to 0.95 V, 23.6 mA cm−2, 0.68 and 15.2% (Table 1), respectively. The highest PCE of 15.2% was achieved for the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.1)/PC60BM/Ag cell, which is 1.9 times the PCE (7.7%) of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Ag cell without CdS. An average PCE of 14.8% is achieved for the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(0.1)/PC60BM/Ag cell, which is much higher than that (7.3%) of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Ag cell. It should be noted that, compared to the cells fabricated in a nitrogen glovebox, the optimum efficiency of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x)/PC60BM/Ag cells fabricated in an ambient environment (40% relative humidity) showed a slight decrease due to the influence of moisture.

To study how the incorporation of CdS affects the device performance, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the ITO/CuInS2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:CdS(x)/PC60BM/Ag cells under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with different applied potentials has been performed and the obtained experimental results are shown in Fig. 8a–c for x = 0.03, 0.06 and 0.1, respectively. A reported equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 8d was employed to fit the experimental data.Rs is the contact resistance including the contact resistance between the HTL/perovskite or ETL/perovskite interface and the electrode resistance, RCT1 is the charge transfer resistance from the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS active layer to the CuInS2 layer, RCT2 is the charge transfer resistance from the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS active layer to the PC60BM layer. The parameters RCT1 and RCT2 obtained from the impedance spectra fits are presented in Table 2. It can be seen that both RCT1 and RCT2 decrease with the increasing value of x, suggesting that the incorporated CdS significantly improves the charge extraction rate from the active layer to the HTL and ETL layers and thus enhances the FF and Jsc. One reason is that as the concentration of CdS increases, the contact area of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/ETL and CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/HTL interfaces may increase, which significantly reduces the interface contact resistance and allows the charge to be collected more efficiently by their respective electrodes. More importantly, EIS results further confirm that photo-generated electron can be transported to the PC60BM layer via the connecting channel of CdS nanoparticles.

In summary, we have fabricated CH3NH3PbI3:CdS perovskite solar cells with different CdS incorporation amounts and investigated the effect of CdS on the device performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the incorporation of CdS improves the compactness of the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS layer and enhances the PCE of the device. Our mechanistic investigations further show that as the CdS incorporation amount increases, the charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to CdS becomes more effective in the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS layer, and the CdS nanoparticles can be connected to form effective electron transport and decrease the contact resistances at the CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/ETL and CH3NH3PbI3:CdS/HTL interfaces, which leads to a more effective charge extraction from the active layer to the HTL and ETL layers and thus reduces the charge recombination in the solar cells, leading to an improvement of the device performance.
