Molecular innovation is highly important to achieve highly efficient small-molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Herein, we report two small-molecule donors, namely, B3T-T and B3T-P, which differ only in their conjugated side chains: the former with a thienyl group and the latter with a phenyl unit. Surprisingly, both small-molecule donors show distinct electron density distribution and electrostatic potential along the conjugated backbone. B3T-P has a much higher dipole moment (0.920 D) than that of B3T-T (0.237 D). In SMOSCs, the B3T-T:BO-4Cl-based device shows a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.1%. In contrast, the B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based device gives an outstanding PCE of 15.2%, which is one of the highest values among SMOSCs. Compared to the B3T-P-based device, although the B3T-T-based device has a large enough driving force for exciton separation and an extremely low non-radiative recombination voltage loss (0.168 V) for achieving high open-circuit voltage, the large domain size (63 nm) and low domain purity in the B3T-T:BO-4Cl-based device results in a relatively low short-circuit current density and fill factor, thus giving a low PCE. This result may pave the way to rationally design SM donors for highly efficient SMOSCs.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising for harvesting clean solar energy due to their advantages of being light weight, flexible, and large-area photovoltaic performance via solution processing or semi-transparency. In BHJ OSCs, the active layer material including an electron donor and an electron acceptor plays a vital role in improving power conversion efficiency (PCE). Based on the attributes of the active layer material, OSCs can be divided into polymer solar cells (PSCs), all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), and small-molecule OSCs (SMOSCs). Compared to other types of OSCs, ASM-OSCs show great potential in commercialization and the achievement of excellent PCE due to several advantages in small molecules over conjugated polymers such as well-defined chemical structures, reproducible synthesis, relative ease of purification, and low energetic disorder. However, the PCEs of SMOSCs lag far behind PSCs that have reached 18%. Currently, the best ternary SMOSCs have achieved a PCE of 15.9%, which was fabricated by one donor material of ZnP-TBO and two acceptors of 6TIC and 4TIC. One of the critical reasons is in understanding that the relationship between molecular structure and device performance is lagging due to the insufficiency of high-performance SM donors compared to polymer donors. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop novel SM donors for high-performance SMOSCs.

Compared to the state-of-the-art non-fullerene (NF)-based PSCs, the inferior PCEs of NF-based SMOSCs are usually caused by low short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), which are mainly attributed to the unfavourable BHJ morphology, resulting in inefficient exciton dissociation, low charge transportation, and serious charge recombination. The formation of a favourable BHJ in OSCs involves nanoscale bi-continuous phase separation with high domain purity and proper domain sizes. For PSCs, a polymer donor with pre-aggregation in solutions can form an interpenetrating network in films by a spin-coating method. This advantage makes it easier to obtain a favourable BHJ morphology with an NF acceptor. Currently, some strategies are developed to optimize the BHJ morphology by tuning polymer donor's aggregation in PSCs. For SMOSCs, however, SM donors cannot form efficient pre-aggregation properties in solutions due to the lack of strong enough intermolecular entanglement and intermolecular interaction on such a short molecular skeleton. Meanwhile, the SM donor has a closer chemical structure and molecular size with NF acceptors than that of polymer donors. Therefore, it is more challenging to achieve a favourable BHJ morphology by material design and optimization in SMOSCs.
BHJ morphologies of SMOSCs have been proved to be optimized properly by some external factors such as solvent additives, solvent vapor annealing (SVA), and thermal annealing (TA). Based on these optimization methods, however, it is hard to achieve the best JSC and FF simultaneously due to the limitation of SM donors' inherent property. The breakthrough in PCEs of SMOSCs is highly dependent on the development of new active materials. This is because the active layer morphology is mainly contributed by the intermolecular interactions of active layer materials. Recently, the researchers have found that the enhanced crystallinity of small-molecule donors can improve the BHJ morphology and obtain high-efficiency binary SMOSCs. For example, Lu et al. used Cl atoms to replace a pair of alkyl chains of BTR to obtain a donor material, BTR-Cl, which has a higher crystallinity than that of the BTR. Such property made BTR-Cl form better phase-separation with electron acceptors of Y6. Thus, the BTR-Cl:Y6-based device produced a PCE of 13.6%. Wei et al. designed a highly crystalline small-molecule donor, ZR1, by fusing two thiophenes onto the central unit, which yielded a hierarchical morphology with Y6 and achieved a PCE of 14.3%. Recently, our group has also synthesized a highly crystalline small-molecule donor, B1, which showed a smaller π–π distance than that of the referenced BTR. After blending with an electron acceptor of BO-4Cl (Fig. 1d), B1 exhibited stronger interactions with BO-4Cl than with BTR and BO-4Cl, leading to a better BHJ morphology. The B1-based device showed a best PCE of 15.3% among binary SMOSCs to date. Considering that the electron acceptor of the Y6 series shows excellent device performances in OSCs, it is highly desired to develop novel SM donors to match this kind of acceptors and understand their relationship between molecular structures, BHJ morphologies and photovoltaic efficiencies.
To further understand the influence of phenyl groups as conjugated side chains in small molecules on the photovoltaic performances, herein, we report two SM donors (B3T-T and B3T-P, Scheme 1), which have different conjugated side chains: a thienyl unit in the former and a phenyl group in the latter. We deeply considered the following two points to achieve rational molecular design. First, the thienyl unit as a conjugated side will produce few disordered molecular geometries in a given target molecule due to its non-axisymmetric structure. Therefore, the meta-position-substituted benzene was used as a conjugated side chain to keep similar molecular geometries. Second, the meta-position-substituted benzene as a conjugated side chain could downshift high occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels or reduce non-radiative recombination energy loss by enhancing device electroluminescence quantum efficiency in a given molecule, thus outputting a relatively high open-circuit voltage (VOC) in an OSC. Thus, the fluorine atoms were introduced onto pendent thiophene units to maintain an approximate initial VOC in both SM donor-based OSCs. When both small donors were blended with the NF acceptor of BO-4Cl, the B3T-T:BO-4Cl-based device gave a PCE of only 11.1%, while the B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based device showed an impressive PCE of 15.2%. Such different PCEs for both SM donors were carefully analysed by investigating their inherent properties, BHJ morphology, and energy losses in both devices.

Both SM donors were synthesized via two-step reactions from reported precursors, as shown in Scheme 1. Dialdehyde compound 3a (3b) was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction between corresponding distannyl compound 1a (1b) and compound 2 in a high yield of 91% (90%). Subsequently, dialdehyde compound 3a (3b) was transformed into a desired SM donor of B3T-T (B3T-P) by Knoevenagel reactions with 3-butyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (4) in a good yield of 85% (83%). The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI. Both SM donors have good solubility in tetrahydrofuran and chloroform, which is beneficial for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices via solution processing. The thermogravimetric analysis shows that B3T-P has a decomposition temperature with 5% weight loss up to 394 °C, which implies more thermal stability than B3T-T (372 °C, Fig. S1, ESI). Besides, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements reveal that both SM donors show clear melting points (Tm) of 273 and 222 °C on the heating and recrystallization point (Tc) of 217 and 193 °C on the cooling for B3T-T and B3T-P, respectively (Fig. 1a). The lower Tm and Tc values of B3T-P indicate that the phenyl group as a conjugated side chain could reduce the molecular thermal robustness compared to that of thienyl as a conjugated side chain.


As shown in Fig. 1b, both SM donors show similar absorption profiles with a maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 518 nm in a dilute chloroform solution at room temperature. The corresponding molar extinction coefficients are 1.0 × 105 and 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for B3T-T and B3T-P, respectively (Fig. S2a, ESI). Compared to their absorption spectra in solutions, both SM donors exhibit the same red-shift of λmax to 576 nm in films but the difference is that B3T-T has a stronger and more bathochromic shoulder peak at 629 nm than that of B3T-P (621 nm), which suggests that B3T-P has a weaker intermolecular interaction or aggregation ability than those of B3T-T in the solid state. It is consistent with the observation from DSC measurements. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of B3T-T and B3T-P are 1.80 and 1.81 eV, respectively, estimated by their absorption onset of the films. Such Eoptg values of both SM donors exhibit the well complementary absorption spectra with the NF acceptor of BO-4Cl, which are expected to achieve high JSCs in the resulting photovoltaic devices.

The HOMOs of both SM donors were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Their oxidation and reduction curves are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). Based on the onsets of first oxidation peaks and the equation of EHOMO = −(EOx − EFc/Fc + 1/2 + 4.8) eV, the HOMO values were estimated to be −5.59 eV for B3T-T and −5.56 eV for B3T-P, respectively. The corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of both SM donors were calculated to be −3.69 and −3.65 eV, based on the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg. It should be noted that these ELUMO should be larger than those of the values obtained from CV measurements due to the inclusion of exciton binding energy in this equation. The energy level alignments of photoactive materials are illustrated in Fig. 1c. The HOMO energy offset in B3T-T:BO-4Cl is 0.07 eV, which is large enough to achieve efficient exciton dissociation in NF-based OSCs.

The torsional barrier energies of both conjugated side chains were investigated by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the basis set of B3LYP/6-31(d,p). Considering the same conjugated main chains of both SM donors, the model compounds of BDT-T and BDT-P were used to replace B3T-T and B3T-P, as shown in Fig. 2a. The significantly big torsional barrier energy in BDT-P implies that B3T-P has a more stable conformation than that of B3T-T. To further understand the inherent property of SM donors, the electron density distribution, molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and dipole moments were also calculated by DFT calculations using the above-mentioned basis set. As shown in Fig. 2b–d, B3T-T shows a typical electron density distribution that electron density locates electron-withdrawing and electron-donating units for LUMO and HOMO, respectively. Surprisingly, B3T-P presents a significantly different phenomenon that the electron density distributes onto the whole conjugated backbone for LUMO and both outsides of B3T-P for HOMO. The ESP image also confirms different electrostatic potential distribution onto the centres of both SM donors. Additionally, B3T-P has a dipole moment up to 0.920 D, which is much higher than B3T-T (0.237 D). A higher dipole moment facilitates enhanced ordering between the donor and the acceptor in OSCs, which improves the charge mobility between the donor and the acceptor. Overall, such different electronic features in both SM donors should affect their organization in blend films, resulting in different BHJ morphologies and photovoltaic performances in SMOSCs.


To investigate the photovoltaic performances of both SM donors with BO-4Cl, we employed a conventional device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/SM donor:BO-4Cl/PFN-Br/Al. The BHJ morphology of the active layer was carefully optimized by changing the SVA time, donor/acceptor weight ratios (w/w) and the thickness of the active layer. The detailed data are summarized in Tables S1–S6 (ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal OSCs are displayed in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1. Without any treatment, the B3T-T:BO-4Cl-based device exhibited a PCE of 0.9%, with a VOC of 0.925 V, a JSC of 3.2 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.300, and the B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based device showed a PCE of 1.0%, with a VOC of 0.899 V, a JSC of 3.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.305. The different VOC values of both devices could be attributed to their HOMO levels. When both devices were treated by SVA using chlorobenzene for 55 seconds, the B3T-T:BO-4Cl-based device gave a PCE of 11.1% with a VOC of 0.867 V, a JSC of 21.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.582. In contrast, the B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based device showed an outstanding PCE of 15.2%, with a VOC of 0.815 V, and significantly improved JSC of 25.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.724. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the highest PCE values among SMOSCs. Fig. 3b presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of both optimized SMOSCs. Although both devices had the same photo response region from 300 to 1000 nm, B3T-P-based SM-OSC exhibited a higher EQE response in the whole region than that of B3T-T-based SMOSC. The JSC values were calculated from the integration of the EQE data to be 20.9 and 24.5 mA cm−2 for B3T-T- and B3T-P-based SMOSCs, respectively. These values are close to the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements below 5% mismatch. The molar extinction coefficients of blend films at the absorption peak of 576 nm were calculated to be 6.1 × 104 and 6.2 × 104 cm−1 for B3T-T:BO-4Cl and B3T-P:BO-4Cl, respectively (Fig. S2b, ESI). Such minor differences in molar extinction coefficients of both blend films have a weak influence on their corresponding SMOSCs, thus the significantly different JSC values in both devices should be mainly attributed to their different BHJ morphologies.

To understand the effect of the conjugated side chains in both SM donors on exciton dissociation and charge collection in SMOSCs, the measurement of photogenerated current density (Jph) against effective voltage (Veff) was carried out. The Jph is the difference between light current density (JL) and dark current density (JD), the Veff is defined as the difference value between the compensation voltage (V0, determined when the Jph is zero) and the applied external voltage bias (Vbias). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) was estimated using the equation of Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density. As shown in Fig. 3c, Pdiss of B3T-T:BO-4Cl- and B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based devices was calculated to be 84% and 91%, respectively, under short circuit conditions, indicating that the B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based device has a higher efficiency in the photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection.
To investigate the effect of the conjugated side chain in both SM donors on charge transport properties of the SMOSCs, we first employed photo-induced charge-carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) to estimate their charge carrier mobilities in both devices. The mobilities of both devices were obtained from five optimal devices, the representative curves were shown in Fig. 3d, the B3T-T-based device gives a mobility of 2.6 ± 0.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the B3T-P-based device exhibits a higher mobility of 4.3 ± 0.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. To further understand the charge hole and electron charge transport abilities in films, space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were also performed on the neat SM donors and blend films. The corresponding films were treated according to the conditions of the optimal devices. The mobilities of these films were obtained from five-time measurements, and the representative curves are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI). The hole mobility (μh) of the neat B3T-T film is 2.37 ± 0.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of the neat B3T-P film (2.25 ± 0.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which could be attributed to the stronger intermolecular interactions and ordering arrangement in B3T-T films. After blending with BO-4Cl, the μh value of the B3T-T:BO-4Cl blend film is significantly reduced to 5.0 ± 0.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the μh value of the B3T-P:BO-4Cl blend film is slightly decreased to 1.0 ± 0.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Additionally, the electron mobilities (μe) of both blend films are 1.8 ± 0.07 × 10−4 and 1.1 ± 0.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for B3T-T:BO-4Cl and B3T-P:BO-4Cl films, respectively. The B3T-P:BO-4Cl film gives more balanced charge carrier mobilities (μe/μh = 1.1) than that of the B3T-T:BO-4Cl film (μe/μh = 3.6), which is consistent with the higher FF in B3T-P-based SMOSCs.
To clarify the different JSC and FF values in both SMOSCs, the charge recombination mechanism was further studied by measuring J–V curves as a function of illumination intensity (Plight). The relationship between VOC and Plight was measured, as shown in Fig. S6a (ESI). The B3T-T- and B3T-P-based SMOSCs show slopes of 1.21KT/q and 1.11KT/q, respectively. The smaller slope for the B3T-P-based SMOSC suggests the suppressed Shockley–Read–Hall recombination under the open-circuit condition. The relationship between JSC and Plight was also investigated, which was described as a power-law equation of JSC ∝ PlightS; when the S value is approaching 1, the photovoltaic device has negligible bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. S6b (ESI), the S values of both SMOSCs were calculated to be 0.94 and 0.99 for B3T-T- and B3T-P-based devices, respectively, which indicates that the B3T-P-based SM-OSC has weaker bimolecular recombination than that of B3T-T-based device. Overall, this result agrees well with their photovoltaic performances.

To understand the difference in VOC values of both devices, their energy losses (Eloss) were investigated in detail. The Eloss of the photovoltaic cell can be divided into three parts as the equation of,

Eloss = Eg − qΔVOC = qΔVrad + ΔECT + qΔVnon-rad
(1)
where the bandgap (
Eg) of these devices were calculated from the intersection of the electroluminescence and EQE curve of the blend film; q is the element charge; ΔVrad is the voltage loss due to radiative recombination, which is inevitable in all types of solar cells; ΔECT = Eg − ECT, where ECT is the charge state of the blend film, which provides the driving force for exciton separation. ΔVnon-rad is the voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination, which can be calculated from the equation of qVnon-radOC = −kTln(EQEEL), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and EQEEL is the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the solar cell when charge carriers are injected into the device under dark conditions. The detailed energy losses are collected in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4, the Eg values of both devices were calculated to 1.397 and 1.391 eV for B3T-T:BO-4Cl and B3T-P:BO-4Cl films, respectively. The total Eloss values of both devices were 0.530 and 0.576 eV according to eqn (1) for B3T-T- and B3T-P-based SMOSCs, respectively. The ECT values of both blend films were calculated according to the reported method. Both blend films have the same ECT of 1.342 eV, as shown in Fig. 4, thus their corresponding ΔECT are 0.055 and 0.049 eV for B3T-T- and B3T-P-based SMOSCs, respectively. For the qΔVnon-rad, the B3T-T-based device showed a much higher EQEEL of 7.50 × 10−4 than that of the B3T-P-based device (1.17 × 10−4), thus producing a much smaller qΔVnon-rad of 0.186 eV for the former and bigger qΔVnon-rad of 0.234 eV for the latter. Based on these results, we found that the B3T-T-based device has a bigger driving force for the exciton separation than that in the B3T-P-based device due to its larger ΔECT. Therefore, the significantly low JSC and FF in the B3T-T-based device should be attributed to the inferior BHJ morphology. This result can be further supported that phenyl as side chains in small-molecule donor is beneficial for optimizing BHJ morphology. Additionally, the B3T-T-based device has a small non-radiative loss, which reached the same level as that of PSCs. According to the previous prediction, a photovoltaic cell with qΔVnon-rad of 0.19 eV and EQE photoresponse edge could achieve more than 18% efficiency, if the BHJ morphology issue is overcome.

To further understand the effect of the conjugated side chain in both SM donors on device performances, the surface morphologies of the blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5. Without SVA treatment, the height images show that the B3T-P:BO-4Cl film exhibits a smoother surface with a mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 0.89 than that of the B3T-T:BO-4Cl film (1.66 nm), which could be attributed to the weaker crystallinity of B3T-P. The phase images show that B3T-T:BO-4Cl shows obvious large-scale phase separation, and B3T-P:BO-4Cl shows an interpenetrating network but without clear phase separation, which are directly related to their low JSCs and FFs. After these blends were treated by SVA for 55 s using chlorobenzene, the surface roughness of both blend films was slightly increased due to the re-organization of small molecules. The phase images show that the scale of phase separation in the B3T-T:BO-4Cl film was obviously improved compared to the initial film, but is still larger than that of the B3T-P:BO-4Cl film; more importantly, the nanofiber-like structure can be observed in the B3T-P:BO-4Cl film, which is of vital importance for B3T-P-based SM-OSCs to achieve a higher PCE.

To deeply understand the difference in photovoltaic performances caused by the changed conjugated side chains, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to determine the molecular structural organizations of both neat SM donors and their blend films. The GIWAXS patterns of the neat donor and blend films are presented in Fig. 6. The corresponding data are collected in Table S7 (ESI). The neat films of both SM donors exhibit strong π–π (010) diffraction peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction and lamella stacking (100), (200), and (300) peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. This indicates that both SM donors have the edge-on organization and are highly ordered. Although B3T-P has the same π stacking distance of (0.36 nm) with B3T-T, the coherence length (CL) of π–π stacking in B3T-P (6.47 nm) is smaller than that of B3T-T (6.68 nm). Meanwhile, B3T-P also shows a larger lamella stacking distance of 18.36 nm than that of B3T-T (17.99 nm). These results further confirm that B3T-P has a weaker molecular packing and intermolecular interaction than those of B3T-T. It can also explain that B3T-P has slightly lower hole mobility than that of B3T-T. After blending with BO-4Cl, both blend films exhibit a face-on arrangement, which is beneficial for the charge transport in OSCs towards the electrodes. Simultaneously, the (200) and (300) diffraction peaks in blend films disappear compared to the neat SM donor films, indicating that both SM donors' molecular packing was suppressed by introducing BO-4Cl. Importantly, the B3T-P:BO-4Cl film shows a smaller π–π distance of 0.34 nm and longer CL of 5.66 nm than those of the B3T-T:BO-4Cl film (0.35 nm and 3.88 nm), which is consistent with their corresponding device performances. To elucidate the observed JSC and FF changes in both SMOSCs, the domain size and purity of both blend films were also investigated by resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) at a photon energy of 284.2 eV, as shown in Fig. 6f. The RSoXS data reveal that the average domain sizes are 63 and 19 nm for the films of B3T-T:BO-4Cl and B3T-P:BO-4Cl, respectively. The large domain sizes of B3T-T:BO-4Cl is harmful for exciton dissociation and charge transport. In contrast, the domain sizes of B3T-P:BO-4Cl are close to the ideal value of 20–30 nm for highly efficient exciton dissociation in OSCs. Additionally, the relative composition variation, which relates monotonically to the domain purity, of B3T-T:BO-4Cl is 0.87, which is lower than that of the B3T-P:BO-4Cl film. This result indicates that the B3T-T:BO-4Cl film has a strong intermixing phase, thus suffering from serious charge recombination, which is in good agreement with the light intensity-dependent VOC and JSC measurements. Overall, these experiments support the superior JSC, FF, and PCE of the B3T-P:BO-4Cl-based device over those of the B3T-T:BO-4Cl-based device.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized two SM donors of B3T-T and B3T-P, which only differ in their conjugated side chains. Both SM donors have similar chemical structures and optical properties, but they show significantly different molecular packing and electronic properties such as electron density and ESP distribution onto the conjugated backbone as well as dipole moment. In the SMOSCs, the B3T-T-based device only yielded a PCE of 11.1%, a VOC of 0.867 V, a JSC of 21.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.582. In contrast, the B3T-P-based device gave an outstanding PCE of 15.2%, with a VOC of 0.815 V, and significantly improved JSC of 25.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.724, which is one of the highest PCE among SMOSCs. The offset (ΔVOC = 0.052 V) in VOC of both devices is primarily attributed to their difference in ΔVnon-rad (0.048 V). Compared to B3T-T, the different electron feature in B3T-P may maintain more efficient intermolecular interaction between B3T-P and BO-4Cl, which is beneficial for forming favourable phase separation with balanced charge carrier mobilities, longer CL, proper domain size, and high domain purity. These results should be the main reasons that the B3T-P-based device has a higher PCE with an improved JSC and FF. Overall, our results indicate that the use of phenyl conjugated side chains in SM donors is an important tool to optimize BHJ morphologies and achieve highly efficient SMOSCs.
