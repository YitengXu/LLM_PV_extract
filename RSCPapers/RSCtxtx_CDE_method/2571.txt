Anode modification by doping silver nano-particles (Ag NPs) into poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and cathode interfacial modification by inserting solution-processed bathophenanthroline (sBphen) in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based planar perovskite solar cells are investigated. Prior to the optical effect such as localized surface plasmon resonance, the Ag-NPs distributed in PEDOT:PSS mainly cause an improvement in the electrical property of PEDOT:PSS–Ag NPs composite films. The sBphen interfacial layer modified the surface morphology of perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) films by filling the voids on the surface of perovskite/PC61BM effectively, which led to an obvious improvement in the fill factor. Accordingly, an efficient device with a power conversion efficiency of 15.75% was achieved due to the simultaneous cathode and anode interfacial modification.

Organometal halide perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress in recent years due to the remarkable increase in their power conversion efficiency (PCE). The certified efficiency of PSCs has now reached over 20%. Initially, most perovskite cells relied on sensitized structures by infiltrating perovskite materials into the mesoporous scaffolds of titania, alumina, or nickel oxide. Recently, planar structure based PSCs also demonstrated remarkable efficiency because of controllable interface engineering.

In planar structured PSCs, it is very essential to manipulate the carrier behavior along the device from the active layer to the electrodes through the hole transporting layers (HTL) and the electron transporting layers (ETL). Many HTL and ETL materials have been utilized to optimize the carrier transport pathway in the entire device. To date, organic or inorganic HTLs, such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), poly-triarylamine derivatives, poly-diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives, 2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N′di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), copper iodide (CuI), nickel oxide (NiOx), copper-doped nickel oxide (Cu:NiOx), and GeO2-doped PEDOT:PSS based PSCs, have demonstrated promising PCEs. Moreover, thermal vapor deposited LiF, bathocuproine (BCP), or fullerene (C60) and solution-processed polyelectrolyte or amino-functionalized polymer cathode interfacial layer based PSCs have also showed remarkable device performance.
In addition, optical manipulations, such as using folded device architectures, aperiodic dielectric stacks, diffraction gratings and plasmon resonant metallic nanostructures, have been explored successfully to improve the light harvesting efficiency or reduce the exciton binding energy in planar photovoltaic devices. Among them, the introduction of metal nanoparticles (NPs) with the excited localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect is regarded as the most efficient and simplest approach. Moreover, some reports demonstrated that, in some cases, these metallic NPs can cause interfacial and morphological changes in devices. Furthermore, both optical and electrical properties should be considered for better understanding the improved performance in the photovoltaic devices incorporated with metallic NPs.
Herein, Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS and solution-processed Bphen (sBphen) are developed to act as the HTL and the ETL, respectively, in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based planar perovskite solar cells. The Ag-NPs distributed in PEDOT:PSS caused interfacial and morphological changes in PEDOT:PSS at the anode side with efficient hole extraction. The sBphen interfacial layer effectively modifies the interface between the cathode and the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). The electron extraction properties were improved, which leads to an enhanced photocurrent to some extent and improved fill factor. Accordingly, the perovskite photovoltaic devices based on the HTL of Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS and ETL of sBphen achieve a PCE of 15.75% due to the simultaneous anode and cathode interfacial modification.

Ag-NPs of about 30 nm diameter were received from Shinkou Kagaku Institute. Clevios PVP AI 4083 PEDOT:PSS was bought from Heraeus (Germany). CH3NH3I, PbCl2 (99.999%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (anhydrous, amine free; 99.9%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. PC61BM and Bphen were purchased from Nichem Fine Technology Co. Ltd. (Taiwan). CH3NH3I and PbCl2 were dissolved in DMF with a molar ratio of 3:1. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight in a glovebox.


Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS composite films were obtained by spin-coating the precursor on a clear ITO surface under 4500 rpm/40 s and then annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. For the perovskite layer, 30 wt% CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was spin coated from a dimethylformamide (DMF) solution with CH3NH3I (synthesized in a previous study) and PbCl2 in a 3:1 molar ratio. The solution was spin-coated onto the hole transport layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s in an N2 filled glovebox. The annealing of wet perovskite films was carried out by following a typical gradient increased temperature method, which can be found elsewhere. After drying at room temperature for ∼20 min, the samples were slowly heated from 50 °C to 100 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/10 min on a hot plate; i.e., we increased the hot plate temperature by 10 °C after every 10 min dwell. After that, 20 mg mL−1 PC61BM in chlorobenzene was coated onto the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Then, the Bphen interfacial layer with varied concentrations in ethanol was spin-coated without additional annealing. Ag (100 nm) was finally deposited onto the Bphen layer under vacuum at 2 × 10−6 Torr through a shadow mask, thus defining a device area of 7.25 mm2. The devices have a structure of ITO/Ag-NPs doped PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/sBphen/Ag (100 nm). Fig. 1(a–c) show a schematic of the device structure, chemical structure of Bphen and TEM image of Ag-NPs, respectively. The nanoparticles are spherical in shape and highly dispersed with average diameters of 30 ± 5 nm.

The surface morphologies of the different films were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco Multimode V instrument) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co.). Absorption spectra were obtained with an UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750). The average particle size of the metal NPs was estimated from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (FEI Tecnai G2F20S-TWIN, at 200 kV). Current density–voltage characteristics of PSCs under 1 sun illumination were performed in ambient conditions using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U), and the characteristics have been described elsewhere. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurement was performed using a system combining a xenon lamp, a monochromator, a chopper and a lock-in amplifier together with a calibrated silicon photodetector.

The mixed halide perovskite, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, is used as a model material to investigate the effects of Ag-NP optical manipulation on cell performance. The J–V characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solar cells based on pristine PEDOT:PSS and Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS HTLs with varied doping ratios under AM 1.5G illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 is shown in Fig. 2. The reference device using pristine PEDOT:PSS as an HTL showed the best PCE of 11.43% (short circuit current density of 18.93 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage 0.90 V, and fill factor 0.67) and an average power conversion efficiency (PCEAVE) (40 devices) of 10.72%. The performance of the Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS based cells is obviously influenced by the doping concentration of Ag-NPs, and these details are reported in Table 1. The maximum performance is obtained at the doping ratio of 0.05 wt% Ag-NPs. The champion device exhibits a PCE of 13.64%, short circuit current density (JSC) of 20.95 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.90 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.72 under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. As seen in Table 1, the VOC in the Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS based cells remains the same as that of the reference device. This indicates that the Ag-NP doping does not have a large influence on the energy level alignment in the device. Noticeably, the JSC increases with the Ag-NPs doping ratio from 18.83 mA cm−2 to 20.95 mA cm−2.

To clarify the improved cell performance, the optical and electrical effects of Ag NPs on the PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite layers were investigated. Fig. 3(a) shows the extinction spectra of the Ag-NP solution. The extinction peak is located at 427 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 166 nm. A theoretical calculation of the electric field profiles in Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS was calculated at different wavelengths (ESI Fig. S1). The magnitude of the electric field intensity is indicated by the color scale. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a), the electric field intensity is strongly enhanced at the wavelength of 427 nm. Fig. 3(b) presents the absorption spectra of the stacked films of PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with and without Ag-NPs (0.05 wt%) and a slight absorption enhancement is observed in the wavelength range of 300–450 nm. Nevertheless, the composite film of PEDOT:PSS:Ag NPs did not present obvious changes in the transmission and absorption (ESI Fig. S2). Noticeably, the strong field around the Ag NPs mainly locates laterally along the PEDOT:PSS:Ag layer rather than vertically into the perovskite layer. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite active layer has strong light harvesting in the visible light region. Although there was an enhanced electric field around the Ag NPs at special wavelengths, the small amount of the Ag NPs did not play a large role in absorbing more photons into the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite active layer. This is why the PEDOT:PSS–Ag NPs/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films did not show obvious absorption enhancement, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(c) shows the IPCE spectra of the perovskite solar cells incorporated with and without Ag NPs. Interestingly, there was an obvious increment of IPCE with a wide wavelength range in the Ag NPs based perovskite cells. Considering that there was no large effect of Ag NPs on the absorption spectra of PEDOT:PSS and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, the wide band enhancement of IPCE is attributed to the improved electrical properties by doping Ag NPs into PEDOT:PSS.
The morphology changes of the PEDOT:PSS:Ag-NPs and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films were further evaluated by AFM and SEM (ESI Fig. S3 and S4). Fig. 4(a) and (b) present the AFM top images of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film and Ag-NP (0.05 wt%) doped PEDOT:PSS film, respectively. Pristine PEDOT:PSS demonstrates a smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 1.67 nm. In the doped cases, Ag-NPs distribute randomly in the PEDOT:PSS films. The doped Ag-NPs result in an enlarged film roughness, which is dependent on the Ag-NPs doping concentration (ESI). In the case of 0.05 wt% Ag-NP doping as shown in Fig. 4(b), the film rms roughness is increased to 2.34 nm.
It has been reported that a suitable rough interface would increase the interface area adjacent to the active layer in organic solar cells. A large interface area at the anode side will be helpful for efficient hole extraction with a short transporting route. In addition, the Ag NPs on the surface of PEDOT:PSS films were assumed to act as the growing sites of the crystal nucleus of perovskite films during the annealing process.Fig. 4(c) and (d) present the SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films after annealing on the pristine PEDOT:PSS film and the PEDOT:PSS–Ag NP composite film, respectively. The difference in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films grown on pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS–Ag NP underlayers was very evident. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films grown on the PEDOT:PSS–Ag NP underlayer demonstrated improved crystalline properties with large grain size and good uniformity, which resulted in the enhanced absorption of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films, as shown in ESI Fig. S5. These combined effects can explain the wide band enhancement of the IPCE spectra. In all, the electrical effect of the Ag NPs in PEDOT:PSS is suggested to play the dominant role in the performance improvement of perovskite solar cells.

4,7-Diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (bathophenanthroline, or Bphen) is a well-known organic electron transport material with high electron mobility that exceeds 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at electric fields of the order of 105 V cm−1. It has been widely used as an electron transport layer, a hole blocking layer, and a host material of the metal-doped electron-injecting layer in organic light-emitting devices. Herein, we modify the cathode interface at Ag/PC61BM in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based perovskite solar cells by inserting a solution-processed Bphen interfacial layer, which has good solubility in ethanol. Moreover, the sBphen interfacial layer was naturally air dried without any annealing process.


Fig. 5 shows the Bphen concentration dependent J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Bphen/Ag under AM 1.5G illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Table 2 shows the key parameters, including JSC, VOC, FF and PCE. There was a large effect of Bphen concentration on the device performance. In the case of 0.6 wt% Bphen, the device demonstrated the best performance with a PCE of 14.38%, short circuit current density (JSC) of 20.03 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.78. It is found that the VOC in sBphen-based cells remains unchangeable as that of the reference device. The JSC increased slightly from 18.93 mA cm−2 to 20.03 mA cm−2. Noticeably, the fill factor improved largely from 0.67 to 0.78. We attribute this to the good interface modification by the sBphen interfacial layer.

In general, the perovskite films have a large roughness over 15 nm in rms since the crystal film tends to have voids between the crystals. We assume that a smoothed interface between the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer and the Ag electrode was formed by the interface engineering of solution-processed Bphen. Herein, we performed AFM and SEM measurements to investigate the coverage and the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films covered by PC61BM and sBphen.

Fig. 6(a–f) show the AFM surface images of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/sBphen (varied concentrations) films. With the PC61BM covering, the roughness was significantly reduced to 8.7 nm, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The surface morphology of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/sBphen is strongly dependent on the sBphen concentration. Under optimized conditions, the deposition of sBphen (0.6 wt%) on top of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM resulted in a further decrease of film roughness to 6.4 nm (Fig. 6(d)). Fig. 6(g–l) present the corresponding SEM top-view images. The CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film exhibited interconnected crystalline areas with a scale length of about 1 μm, and clear voids between the crystalline domains were observed. With PC61BM deposition, the perovskite film was covered with relatively smaller and fewer voids (Fig. 6(g)). Additional deposition of sBphen further filled the voids in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM films. At the optimized case of 0.6 wt% Bphen, the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Bphen film was very flat. The voids were almost filled with only a negligible quantity of pinholes. This means that the cathode interface between the perovskite layer and the Ag electrode could be largely flattened by the solution processed Bphen layer. These account for the improvements in the fill factor and JSC in the sBphen based perovskite solar cells, as shown in Table 2. It should be noted that the vacuum-evaporated BCP small molecule has been reported to act as the cathode interfacial layer in planar perovskite solar cells. Considering the rough morphology and voids of perovskite films, vacuum-evaporated bathocuproine BCP may not be the best choice for cathode interface modification. Bphen has good solubility in ethanol, and the sBphen interfacial layer does not need an additional annealing process. Accordingly, the solution-processed Bphen interfacial layer can flatten the cathode interface effectively.

Combined with the optical manipulation of Ag-NPs and the interfacial modification of sBphen, perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS–Ag NPs (0.05 wt%)/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/sBphen (0.6 wt%)/Ag were fabricated. Fig. 7(a) shows the J–V characteristics of the champion device under AM 1.5G illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 15.75% with a JSC of 21.51 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.93 V, and FF of 0.79 was achieved. In addition, there was a slight hysteresis for the PCE between the reverse scan from the forward bias to short-circuit and the forward scan from short-circuit to forward bias (ESI Fig. S6). The origin of the anomalous hysteresis in perovskite solar cells is not clearly understood at present.Fig. 7(b) presents the histograms of the PCE parameter in 20 cells. A higher PCEAVE of 14.82% with low relative standard deviation was obtained. These results illustrate that the optical manipulation of Ag-NPs and the interfacial modification of sBphen are very efficient and simple means for improving the device performance of planar perovskite solar cells.


In summary, we have demonstrated Ag-NP doped PEDOT:PSS and solution-processed Bphen are acting as the HTL and the ETL, respectively, in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based planar perovskite solar cells. The resulting cells show the best performance with 15.75% PCE and 79% fill factor. Ag-NPs distributed in PEDOT:PSS mainly cause an improvement in the electrical property of PEDOT:PSS–Ag NPs composite films. The modified anode interface can improve hole extraction effectively. Surface morphology evaluations by AFM and SEM demonstrate that the sBphen interfacial layer can modify the surface morphology by filling the voids on the surfaces of perovskite/PC61BM. Moreover, the fill factor of perovskite solar cells can be improved largely. Especially, the cathode interface modification by sBphen is more evident. The combined effects of Ag NPs at the anode side and sBphen at the cathode side resulted in the largely improved cell performance. The findings in this study provide simple and efficient means for interfacial modification in planar perovskite solar cells.
