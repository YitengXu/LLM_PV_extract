Taking into account the effect of planarity, alkyl chain steric hindrance and molecular weight towards high performance polymer solar cells, a “planar” semiconducting polymer PTOBDTDTffBT is designed. Minimal intra- and inter-molecular steric hindrances are realized by removing the alkyl chains at the 4,4′-positions of the DTffBT monomer and introducing shorter octyloxy chains on the BDT unit, respectively. Such a steric minimization strategy endows PTOBDTDTffBT with a high number average molecular weight of 343.37 kg mol−1, a planar conjugated backbone and strong inter-molecular aggregation characteristics as well. The optical properties indicate that the aggregation can only be partially broken even at 160 °C; theoretical calculations indicate that the polymer backbone has small distortion and the thiophene-phenyl bridge can move the octyloxy chains outward by 6.77 Å from the polymer backbone, both of which ensure the strong inter-chain aggregation. In spite of the high planarity and strong aggregation of the polymer, PTOBDTDTffBT is relatively amorphous in its film form, indicated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction analysis. PTOBDTDTffBT exhibits a narrow bandgap of 1.71 eV together with a high ionization potential of 5.46 eV. Because of the strong aggregation of the polymer, the PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM active layer exhibits temperature-dependent photovoltaic performance. When the active layer is spin-coated at a relatively low temperature below 100 °C, PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM exhibits a stable power conversion efficiency above 6.6%. However, when the temperature is elevated from 120 °C to 160 °C, the power conversion efficiency decreased gradually to 3.58% because of the decreased short-circuit current density and fill factor. The temperature-dependent photovoltaic performance is explained by the fact that the PC71BM is easily spun out from the solution at higher temperatures as confirmed by the UV-vis absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. High temperatures can also lead to coarse morphology and large phase separation in the active layer observed from the atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.68% is obtained when the active layer is spin-coated at 80 °C, which is a significant improvement of the power conversion efficiency for the “planar” PBDTDTffBT series.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) composed of an electron-donating conjugated polymer and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative offer promise for the realization of a low-cost, printable and flexible renewable energy source. Materials having a delocalized π electron system can absorb sunlight, create photo generated charge carriers and transport these charge carriers. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a PSC is determined by the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF). In view of the fixed energy level, optical properties and electron structure of fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl-ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl-ester (PC71BM), research hotspots are mainly focused on designing π–π conjugated polymers by optimizing their bandgaps (Eg) and energy levels. Specially, nano-scale morphology and phase separation in the active layer are also crucial for effective charge separation and transport.

When semiconducting polymers are designed towards high PCE, firstly, a planar conjugated backbone is desired, the planar conjugated backbone ensures a close π–π stacking distance, which is relevant for inter-molecular aggregation and charge carrier transport. The planarity also warrants an effective conjugation along the polymer backbone which is beneficial for narrower Eg. Secondly, soluble side chains have to be indispensably introduced to ensure solubility. However, the non-chromophoric side chains can influence charge carrier transport, aggregation and BHJ morphology when blending the polymer with a fullerene derivative in the active layer of a PSC. It is well established that properly chosen and placed alkyl side chains can promote inter-chain interdigitation, and the bulky alkyl chains usually hinder inter-chain interactions. Thirdly, the molecular weight has to be improved to be as high as possible. Brabec and Heeger reported respectively that devices made of higher molecular weight poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) exhibited higher photovoltaic performance because of the longer conjugation length of the polymer chain and better interconnections within the bicontinuous interpenetration network. However, higher molecular weights can also lead to improved aggregation which will influence the solubility. Hence, optimal planarity, solubility and molecular weight are not simple choices and likely need to be optimized for each specific conjugated backbone to achieve the best performance.
In the past few years, conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers that use 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTffBT) as an electron withdrawing unit have emerged as promising semiconductors for application in field effect transistors and PSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that the fluorine atom can increase the planarity of the structure and decrease the dihedral angles to zero between thiophenes and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (ffBT). These DTffBT containing polymers then exhibit a certain degree of aggregation in solutions such as the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)–DTffBT and bithiophene–DTffBT alternating copolymers. After a comprehensive survey of the reported DTffBT containing polymers we found alkyl chains are constantly introduced into the 4,4′-positions of thiophenes. Although this strategy is in favor of solubility according to You's work, these alkyl chains are sterically hindered compared to the hydrogen atom and will produce intra-molecular steric hindrance and thus result in a “tortuous” backbone. In contrast, several “planar” polymers have been reported incorporating naked DTffBT with BDT or indacenodithiophene; unfortunately, most of the polymers exhibit low PCE < 5% in their PSC devices. A more intuitive comparison of the “tortuous” and “planar” PBDTDTffBTs is depicted in Fig. 1. BDT is chosen as the donor unit because the fused ring system endows BDT based polymers with high planarity and effective π–π conjugation. For “planar” PBDTDTffBTs, these polymers possess a rigid and planar backbone, which are beneficial for effective conjugation and inter-molecular aggregation. However, it will be more difficult to design high PCE “planar” polymers because the modifiable substituent is only R1 compared to “tortuous” type polymers, for which both R2 and R3 are modifiable to regulate the solubility and energy level of the polymer. In order to develop a high PCE “planar” polymer, R1 should be designed without influencing the aggregation of the polymer with large bulkiness, meanwhile, R1 should provide good solubility as a guarantee of high molecular weight and solution process-ability. Therefore, the designing of R1 will be a challenging contradiction of solubility and steric hindrance effect. Our previous work indicated 4,8-bis(2-(3,4,5-tris(octyloxy)phenyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (TOBDT) can significantly improve the solubility and molecular weight of 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole containing polymer, however, the detailed optical property, aggregation and photovoltaic characteristics were not discussed. Herein, TOBDT is employed to design a new “planar” polymer PTOBDTDTffBT. As shown in Fig. 1, shorter octyloxy chains are employed to reduce the steric hindrance arising from the side chain, moreover, a conjugated thiophene–phenyl bridge is inserted between the conjugated backbone and alkyl chains to minimize the steric hindrance effect of flexible alkyl chains, which may freely swing between the two adjacent polymer backbones and hinder the aggregation. Therefore, PTOBDTDTffBT is designed with minimal distortion along the backbone and hindrance of the flexible side chains. In addition, the conjugated side chains are beneficial for deeper lying energy levels and narrow Eg. As is expected, PTOBDTDTffBT exhibits strong aggregation in both the neat film and dilute solution states because of the “planar” backbone. The aggregation can also be observed by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements, which will be discussed together with its optical property in this work. Because of the strong aggregation characteristics of the “planar” polymer, PSCs based on PTOBDTDTffBT show a temperature-dependent morphology and photovoltaic effect, and a maximum PCE = 7.68% is obtained with Voc = 0.91 V, Jsc = 12.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 69.29% when the polymer is spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at 80 °C together with PC71BM. This result is a dramatic breakthrough in the PCE for the “planar” PBDTDTffBT series.

Common solvents were obtained as reagent grade; deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), o-DCB, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2dba3) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Solvents were carefully dried and distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. It is equipped with a three-electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. The measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Thin films were deposited from chloroform solution onto the working electrodes and dried under nitrogen prior to measurements. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is 0.40 V vs. SCE. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined by calculating the empirical formula of EHOMO = −IP (ionic potential) =  and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg, where Eox is the onset oxidation potential. Absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-4100 UV-vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC performed using an ELEOS system, and polystyrene was used as the standard (room temperature, chloroform as the eluent; 150 °C, trichlorobenzene as the eluent). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed by using a SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired with an Agilent-5400 scanning probe microscope with a Nanodrive controller in tapping mode with MikroMasch NSC-15 AFM tips with resonant frequencies ∼300 kHz. Bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were acquired using a HITACHI H-7650 electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) data of the polymer films were obtained at beamline BL14B1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) at a wavelength of 1.2398 Å. BL14B1 is a beamline based on a bending magnet and a Si (111) double crystal monochromator was employed to monochromatize the beam. The size of the focus spot is about 0.5 mm and the end station is equipped with a Huber 5021 diffractometer. A NaI scintillation detector was used for data collection. GIXD patterns were recorded with a two-dimensional image detector. The structures of the polymer/PC71BM blends were analyzed using XRD (Bruker D8 ADVANCE). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a thermo ESCALAB 250XI multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) equipped with an Al Kα radiation source and a 1 μm beam size. Measurements were taken while the sample was under ultrahigh vacuum (10−10 Torr). The ground state geometries of BDT–DTffBT molecules were fully optimized with the density functional theory (DFT) method under B3LYP/6-31 G(d,p) level.

 (0.3203 g, 0.2 mmol), DBrDTffBT (0.0988 g, 0.2 mmol), Pd2dba3 (1.8 mg, 0.002 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were dissolved into 4 mL of toluene in a flask protected by argon. The flask was purged three times with successive vacuum and argon filling cycles. The oil bath was heated to 110 °C gradually, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 18 h at 110 °C under an argon atmosphere. Next, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by addition of 300 mL methanol. The precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol and hexane successively in a Soxhlet apparatus to remove oligomers and catalyst residues. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum at 40 °C overnight. PTOBDTDTffBT was obtained as a dark solid, yield = 90%, 290 mg. The polymer can be readily dissolved into THF, CHCl3, and o-DCB. 1HNMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ ppm), 8.35–6.69 (br, 14H, ArH), 4.39–3.35 (br, 12H, –OCH2–), 2.06–1.75 (br, 12H, –CH2–), 1.58–1.02 (br, 60H, –(CH2)5–), 1.03–0.72 (br, 18H, –CH3).

Hole mobility was measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model, using a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au by taking current–voltage in the range of 0–5 V and fitting the results to a space charge limited form for hole-only devices. In the presence of carrier traps in the active layer, a trap-filled-limit (TFL) region exists between the ohmic and trap-free SCLC regions. The SCLC behavior in the trap-free region can be characterized by using the Mott–Gurney square law, where ε is the static dielectric constant of the medium and μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the polymer thickness.

PSCs were fabricated as a traditional device architecture, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. ITO coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, water, acetone and isopropanol, followed by treating in an oxygen plasma (Plasma Preen II-862 Cleaner) for 6 min. The cleaned substrates were covered by a 40-nm-thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios TM P AI 4083) by spin-coating. After annealing in an oven at 150 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred to a glove box filled with N2. Polymer and PC71BM (American Dye Source) were dissolved in o-DCB. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature and then heated at corresponding temperatures from 25 °C to 160 °C, finally the solution was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS modified ITO coated glass with the same rotation rate = 1750 rpm to prepare the active layer. The devices were completed after the deposition of Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) as the cathode through a shadow mask under high vacuum (∼10−4 Pa). The thickness of the active layer was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin coating process and estimated using a Veeco Dektak150 surface profiler in our laboratory. The effective area of the device was measured to be 0.10 cm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2, Newport solar simulator). Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.


The final copolymer PTOBDTDTffBT was prepared via Stille coupling polymerization of TOBDTSn with DBrDTffBT in the presence of Pd2dba3/P(o-tol)3 in toluene refluxed for 18 h. After 3 hours of reaction time, the dark solution became viscous, indicating an effective polymerization reaction and potential high molecular weight. After 18 hours the reaction mixture was removed from heat and a colloidal substance was obtained, which was precipitated from methanol as continuous fibers with metallic luster. The polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform in sequence. PTOBDTDTffBT showed excellent solubility in chloroform and o-DCB at room temperature. PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited high Mn = 343.37 kg mol−1 with PDI = 2.39 measured by GPC (Fig. S1 in ESI). There was no precipitate obtained even when the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, which indicated high solubility of PTOBDTDTffBT and this may help to obtain high molecular weight and excellent solution process-ability when fabricating a PSC device. In addition, the high molecular weight will be beneficial for inter-chain aggregation and PSC performance. TGA indicated that PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited a high decomposition temperature (Td) with a 5% weight loss denoted at 375.27 °C (Fig. 2a), higher than those of reported “tortuous” alkoxy-BDT and DTffBT incorporated polymers.


The Eox of PTOBDTDTffBT was recorded by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the polymer deposited from chloroform solution onto the working electrode (Fig. 2b). The onset Eox of PTOBDTDTffBT was estimated at about 1.06 V according to the CV curve. Then the IP was calculated to be 5.46 eV, corresponding to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.46 and −3.75 eV, respectively. A high Voc is expected because PTOBDTDTffBT possessed a deep lying HOMO energy level and efficient exciton dissociation rate can also be expected because of the large energy offset (>0.3 eV) between the LUMOs of the PTOBDTDTffBT donor and the PC71BM acceptor. The electrochemical properties of PTOBDTDTffBT are summarized in Table 1.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of semiconducting polymers are dependent on many factors; when a particular conjugated backbone is finalized, their absorption shape and intensity vary with the substituent's position and bulkiness. In addition, the molecular weight can also affect their photophysics characteristics such as the optical bandgap (Eoptg) and extinction coefficient. As shown in Fig. 3, PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited a stronger 0–0 peak (λ0–0) together with a weaker 0–1 peak (λ0–1) charge transfer transition absorption in the neat film state, implying strong inter-chain aggregation in the solid state. Strong aggregation can also be obviously observed in the dilute o-DCB solution at 25 °C, PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited distinguished structural absorption except there was a slightly hypo-chromatic shift of the peak wavelength from 656 nm to 646 nm compared to its neat film, this phenomenon is rare in the “tortuous” PBDTDTffBTs. The structural absorption can be roughly observed even at 100 °C, though λ0–0 became weaker than λ0–1 beginning from 80 °C. In order to give a direct relationship of the optical properties at different temperatures, the peak wavelength and the intensity of λ0–0 and λ0–1 are described in Fig. S2a in the ESI and summarized in Table S1 in the ESI. In the dilute solution, both λ0–0 and λ0–1 hypochromatic shifted (Fig. 3) with the increase of temperature, which indicated a broken process of the inter-chain aggregation. Here we used intensity ratio of λ0–0 and λ0–1 (I0–0/I0–1) to judge the aggregation degree, as described in Fig. S2b and Table S1 (in the ESI), the maximum I0–0/I0–1 value of 1.0617 was obtained in the neat film state, higher I0–0 than I0–1 can also be obtained in some DTffBT containing polymers. The I0–0/I0–1 linearly decreased as the temperature increased from 25 °C to 80 °C. I0–0 was weaker than I0–1 with I0–0/I0–1 = 0.9992 at 80 °C for the first time. When the solution was heated to 100 °C, I0–0/I0–1 dropped slightly to 0.9980, still very close to 1, indicating that aggregation of PTOBDTDTffBT in o-DCB solution was too strong to be broken completely even at 100 °C. Unfortunately, we cannot obtain the UV-vis spectra of PTOBDTDTffBT at higher temperatures to further study its aggregation because of the test conditions limit. However, we can infer that I0–0/I0–1 will grow smaller until λ0–0 disappeared completely from the absorption spectra with the increase of temperature. The solution faded from dark to light color when it was finally heated to 180 °C (boiling point of o-DCB) as shown in the Fig. 3 insets. The pictures of PTOBDTDTffBT in o-DCB solution at different temperatures indicated strong aggregation because an obvious color change was observed at a very high temperature of ∼160 °C, much higher than those of many reported “tortuous” polymers, for which the aggregation can always be broken below 100 °C, I0–0/I0–1 values estimated from their absorption spectra in solutions were far less than 1 when lower temperatures were applied.

In order to further study the inter-chain aggregation of PTOBDTDTffBT, high temperature GPC was carried out at 150 °C using trichlorobenzene as the eluent. Compared to the high Mn = 343.37 kg mol−1 of PTOBDTDTffBT measured at room temperature, a relative low Mn = 77.05 kg mol−1 was obtained. This also indicated PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited stronger inter-chain interactions in the solution state. GIXD was employed to investigate the polymer packing in films as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI. Films were fabricated by spin coating PTOBDTDTffBT in o-DCB at 25 °C, 80 °C, 120 °C and 160 °C, respectively. However, no obvious diffraction peak was observed, indicating that the films were relatively amorphous. The possibility of non-crystallinity may be because of the high molecular weight of PTOBDTDTffBT, which has also been observed for P3HT according to McGehee's work, the diffraction peak became weaker with the increase of molecular weight because low Mn polymer chains are more able to pack into crystals. The Eoptg of PTOBDTDTffBT was estimated to be about 1.71 eV from the onset absorption in neat films, the narrow Eoptg was a result of the high planarity and molecular weight of PTOBDTDTffBT together with the conjugated side chain, which ensure an effective π–π conjugation along both horizontal and vertical directions. The electronic energy level diagrams of PTOBDTDTffBT and PC71BM are depicted in Fig. 4a. Both the HOMO and LUMO energy differences (ΔEHOMO = 0.64 eV and ΔELUMO = 0.73 eV) between the polymer and PC71BM were larger than 0.3 eV, thus, efficient exciton dissociation could be expected to occur in their corresponding devices. Interestingly, a higher Voc > 0.9 V is expected because there is a 1.26 eV energy offset between the HOMO of PTOBDTDTffBT and LUMO of PC71BM according to the empirical formula that Voc = (1/e) (|EdonorHOMO| − |EPCBMLUMO|) − 0.3 V, where e is the elementary charge and using −4.20 eV for the PC71BM LUMO energy level. It should be pointed out that in the “tortuous” PBDTDTffBT systems, high PCEs are obtained employing polymers with alkoxy-BDT as the donor unit, however, introducing alkoxy-BDT can raise the HOMO level and result in lower Voc. Though there are six alkoxy chains contained in the TOBDT monomer, which are inserted by a thiophene-phenyl bridge between BDT and thus the inductive electronic effect of the octyloxy chains will be weaker than the octyloxy connected directly to the BDT building block, moreover, the 3- and 5-position substituted octyloxy chains exhibit a stronger electron-withdrawing inductive effect than electron donating p–π conjugation when they are connected to phenyl. Therefore, PTOBDTDTffBT exhibits a deeper lying HOMO energy level than alkoxy-BDT containing PBDTDTffBTs.

The computational study of PTOBDTDTffBT provided insightful information to account for the observed strong aggregation and narrow Eg properties. The optimized geometry and electron density distributions were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31 G(d,p) level of theory using DFT. To simplify the calculations, only one repeating unit of each polymer was subject to the calculations, with alkyl chains replaced by CH3 groups. Horizontally, as shown in Fig. 4b, DTffBT exhibited high planarity with two dihedral angles of 0.37° between the thiophene groups and central ffBT unit, similar to the result reported by Bronstein and coworkers. Interestingly, a small dihedral angle of 13.7° was also simulated between BDT and flanking thiophene group, this value was smaller than some “tortuous” polymers, giving a more direct interpretation of the effective conjugation along the polymer backbone in “planar” PTOBDTDTffBT. Vertically, the six flexible octyloxy chains were moved outward by two 6.77 Å long rigid thiophene-phenyl bridges, which can reduce the chances of the flexible chains swinging inside the adjacent polymer backbones and ensure stronger inter-chain aggregation. The LUMO of PTOBDTDTffBT was mainly delocalized in the DTffBT unit seen from the isosurface of the LUMO displayed in Fig. 4c (right), this result coincided completely with the reported PBDTDTffBTs. However, the isosurface of the HOMO showed us clearly that the electron density was delocalized in not only the BDT unit but also the thiophene-phenyl side chains, indicating an extended conjugation along the vertical direction. Simulation results show us a well designed “planar” PTOBDTDTffBT, besides the “planar” polymer backbone, the conjugated side chains participated in the conjugation and minimized the steric hindrance effect of the flexible alkyl chains, which may help to explain the experimental narrow Eg and strong aggregation characteristics of PTOBDTDTffBT. The Eg of PTOBDTDTffBT was narrower than Cho's report, who have studied a series of “tortuous” PBDTDTffBTs with different R2 substituents. Our previously reported “tortuous” PBDTDTffBT also exhibited a wider Eg about 1.74 eV. Besides the narrow Eg, PTOBDTDTffBT also exhibited stronger aggregation than those “tortuous” PBDTDTffBTs, which showed weaker 0–0 than 0–1 absorption peaks in their solutions.


PSCs were fabricated by spin coating PTOBDTDTffBT with PC71BM from o-DCB solution. The photoactive layer was sandwiched between transparent ITO/PEDOT:PSS and reflective Ca/Al back electrodes. Initially, different PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM ratios were examined to find the optimum weight ratios. Because of the admirable solubility of PTOBDTDTffBT in o-DCB, the PTOBDTDTffBT concentration was fixed at as high as 10 mg mL−1. As shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI and Table S2 in the ESI, all the devices show stable Voc with different PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM ratios (1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5 and 1:3), a maximum PCE of 6.67% was obtained with a high Voc = 0.91 V at a specific ratio = 1:2.5. For bulk heterojunction PSCs, a bicontinuous interpenetration network in the active layer is expected, which will be beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport. However, the “planar” PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited strong aggregation in its dilute solution, and the aggregation will be stronger in the spin coating solution because of the higher polymer concentration. Considering the polymer self-aggregation will decrease the contact area of PTOBDTDTffBT and PC71BM interfaces, this may reduce the exciton dissociation and charge carrier generation occurring at these interfaces. Here, the PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM solution was heated gradually from 25 °C to 160 °C, at which temperature the aggregation was broken as shown in Fig. 3, and the hot solutions were spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS to study their photovoltaic effects.


PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM based devices exhibited temperature-dependent photovoltaic performance as shown in Fig. 5a and summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, all the devices exhibited stable Voc around 0.91 V within a certain temperature range from 25 °C to 160 °C and inconspicuous change of FF > 66% and Jsc > 10.5 mA cm−2 from 25 °C to 100 °C (Fig. S5 in the ESI). This is not difficult to understand because PTOBDTDTffBT exhibits strong aggregation in its solution even at 100 °C, and temperatures below 100 °C can hardly affect the polymer/PC71BM micro-structure during the film-forming process. This result is quite different from Hou's report, who designed a “planar” PBDTBDD, and the PCE decreased significantly from 6.67% (spin-coated directly at 25 °C) to 4.72% when the donor/acceptor solution spin-coated after a 25 °C to 90 °C to 25 °C heating–cooling circle. The main reason may be the different structures of the polymer backbones, but it should be pointed out that PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited stronger aggregation in the solution state than PBDTBDD for which the aggregation can be broken at 90 °C and an obvious color-fading process from dark to red was seen. In contrast, an obvious color change can be obtained at a temperature as high as 160 °C for PTOBDTDTffBT (the Fig. 3 insets). Maximum PCE = 7.68% was realized by spin coating the active layer at 80 °C compared to other temperatures, together with a highest Jsc = 12.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 69.29%. The Jsc and FF dropped gradually with temperature increasing from 100 °C to 160 °C, and finally a low PCE = 3.58% was obtained spin-coated at 160 °C (Fig. 5a and S5 in the ESI). To evaluate the photo-response of PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM based devices and calibrate the Jsc data, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of optimized devices with different temperatures were measured and shown in Fig. 5b. The calculated Jsc is consistent with the measured data. The higher photo-response at the region between 400 and 500 nm than 500–750 nm should result from the strong absorption of PC71BM in PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM blends with a high PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2.5 together with the absorption of the PTOBDTDTffBT film in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm. The phenomenon was similar to some DTffBT based devices. The EQEs increased gradually as the films were cast at 25 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C, and then showed a significant downward trend with temperature increasing from 100 °C to 160 °C. The unintelligible decrease of EQE together with the FF at high temperatures was unexpected because the broken self-aggregation of PTOBDTDTffBT may result in a more homogeneous mixture between the donor and acceptor theoretically.

In order to further investigate the temperature-dependent photovoltaic effect of PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM blends, their optical and morphology characteristics were carried out by spin-coating the films at a relatively low temperature (80 °C), medium temperature (120 °C) and high temperature (160 °C). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the active layers are shown in Fig. 6a. Surprisingly, the film spin-coated at 80 °C exhibited a higher absorption coefficient during the entire spectral range than the films spin-coated at 120 °C and 160 °C, although all the films were fabricated with the same PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM solution and spin-coated with a fixed rotation rate = 1750 rpm. The maximum absorption coefficient of the film spin-coated at 80 °C was about 0.6 × 105 cm−1, however, maximum absorption coefficients below 0.5 × 105 cm−1 were obtained when the films were spin-coated at 120 °C and 160 °C. Obviously, the active layers exhibited comparable absorption ability from 600–750 nm by anatomizing their absorption spectra regardless of the temperature, which was mainly attributed to the contribution of PTOBDTDTffBT. However, an apparent difference can be seen between 350 and 550 nm which was the main absorption of PC71BM. The absorption differences of the active layers look like the content of PC71BM decreased gradually in the films as the temperature increased from 80 °C to 120 °C and 160 °C. Considering the elemental composition difference of PTOBDTDTffBT and PC71BM, XPS was employed to detect the proportion of sulfur (S), nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) elements in the surface of the films used for UV-vis absorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 6b, obvious improvements of F were observed in the films spin-coated at higher temperatures of 120 °C and 160 °C compared to 80 °C, indicating larger polymer contents in the active layers spin-coated at higher temperatures, and the contents of F in the films spin-coated at 120 °C and 160 °C were comparable, which were in agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra of PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM blends spin-coated at different temperatures (Fig. 6a). There was a slight difference of the absorption coefficient between 120 °C and 160 °C, which was much smaller than the difference between 80 °C and 120 °C or 160 °C. Similar tendencies were also obtained for S and N elements as shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI. The UV-vis absorption and XPS results help to understand the temperature-dependent photovoltaic effect of the “planar” PTOBDTDTffBT and PC71BM based device. One reasonable excuse should be that the PC71BM is easily spun out from the o-DCB solutions at higher temperatures.


Same as the pure polymer film, the crystallinity signal of PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM films spin-coated at 80 °C, 120 °C and 160 °C can hardly be detected after XRD measurements as shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI, indicating that PTOBDTDTffBT is relatively amorphous rather than crystalline. The amorphous PTOBDTDTffBT then shows relatively low hole mobility of ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured using the SCLC model (Fig. S8 in the ESI). However, the highly crystalline polymer with a high hole mobility does not always guarantee a high photovoltaic effect with the desired morphology blending with fullerene acceptors. In order to further explain the temperature-dependent photovoltaic properties of PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM based devices, AFM was used to explore their surface morphology and phase separation characteristics of the active layers spin-coated at 80 °C, 120 °C and 160 °C (Fig. 7). The excellent solubility and high molecular weight of PTOBDTDTffBT warrant admirable film-forming ability, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 1.51 nm when the active layer was spin-coated at 80 °C as shown in Fig. 7 height images, however, relatively coarse surfaces were obtained when the active layer was fabricated at 120 °C or 160 °C with RMS = 3.04 and 3.40 nm, respectively. The phase images also exhibited an obvious difference of the phase separation in the films. At 80 °C, narrow fibril-like domains can be seen in the whole phase image, however, the fibril becomes wider at 120 °C which results in larger domains than at 80 °C. Larger scale phase separation can be observed from the phase image spin-coated at 160 °C. Furthermore, TEM was used to give a real space image of the phase separated morphology of the blends, and the TEM images of the PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM blends spin-coated at 80 °C, 120 °C and 160 °C are provided in Fig. 8. The electrons can be scattered more efficiently by the PC71BM from the TEM beam because of the higher electron density of PC71BM compared with semiconducting polymers. Thus, the darker regions in the TEM images are domains of phase-separated PC71BM and the bright regions are phase-separated PTOBDTDTffBT. Obviously, the blend spin-coated at 80 °C has a fine feature of phase separation and is characterized by the formation of favorable bi-continuous donor/acceptor interpenetrating networks, which is desired for better exciton dissociation and charge transport. In contrast, large bright and dark clusters can be seen in the films spin-coated at higher temperatures, especially at 160 °C, continuous polymer phase-separation is observed in the 50–100 nm scale, and the PC71BM clusters are in the scale of about 100–200 nm. A clearly defined nanoscale phase separation is observed. However, typical exciton diffusion lengths for conjugated polymers are a few nanometres, and hence the large scale phase separation may negatively affect the percentage of excitons that reach the interface with the fullerene where charge generation occurs. Therefore, it's reasonable that relatively low Jsc values are obtained when the active layers are spin-coated at higher temperatures.

Recently, Yan et al. have reported several polymers with temperature-dependent aggregation, which exhibited strong aggregation at room temperature in their o-DCB solutions, however, all the polymers were disaggregated when the temperature elevated to 85 °C, and they have developed a controlled morphology and crystallinity in the active layer. In this study, the “planar” PTOBDTDTffBT exhibited a stable photovoltaic effect from 25 °C to 100 °C because of the polymer's strong aggregation characteristics, more importantly, improvement of the PCE cannot be realized when the PTOBDTDTffBT/PC71BM solution was heated to higher temperatures. This is the first report of a polymer with extremely strong aggregation and photovoltaic effect study by spin coating the active layers at temperatures higher than 120 °C. Our study indicates that there are obvious morphology and donor/acceptor ratio changes in the active layer when fabricating the active layer at elevated temperatures.

In summary, employing a steric minimization strategy, we have successfully designed a “planar” semiconducting polymer PTOBDTDTffBT uniting the planarity, solubility and molecular weight, which exhibited strong inter-molecular aggregation characteristics and showed temperature-dependent photovoltaic performance with optimized PCE up to 7.68%. After a systematic study on the physical/chemical properties and photovoltaic characteristics of PTOBDTDTffBT, significant results have to be pointed out. (1) Cleverly diminishing the inter-molecular steric hindrance by moving the flexible alkyl chains away from the polymer backbone may strengthen the inter-molecular aggregation. (2) We have concluded that the donor/acceptor blends spin-coated at higher temperatures above 120 °C will result in various donor/acceptor ratios, surface morphologies and phase separations compared to lower temperatures. The multi alkyl chains substituted monomer TOBDT has been proven to be an alternative donor unit for designing “planar” polymers together with our previously reported PTOBDTDTBT with PCE = 6.21%, one of the highest PCE among the “planar” PBDTDTBTs. However, both the TOBDT containing polymers are still amorphous in spite of their high planarity and strong aggregation characteristics.
