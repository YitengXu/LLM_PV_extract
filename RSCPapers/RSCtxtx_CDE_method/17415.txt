Halide perovskites have attracted much attention among the emerging photovoltaic materials due to their high efficiency, low cost and facile solution processing. However, the usual facile materials contain toxic Pb elements, which can pollute the environment and cause almost permanent damage to the earth and mankind. Therefore, the exploration of non/less-lead halide perovskites is urgent for the practical application of this photovoltaic technology. Here, perovskites with the formula MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and 1% MnI2 excessive doped MAPbI3 were prepared. With 1% MnI2 excessive doping in MAPbI3, the perovskite film showed larger crystal sizes than that of a pristine MAPbI3 film. The optimization results from first-principles calculations revealed that Mn2+ could be easily inserted into the interstices of octahedral [PbI6]4− to restrain the generation of vacancy defects accompanying perovskite crystallization. These could improve the microcrystalline thin film quality during the annealing process and reduce carrier recombination. Eventually, the efficiency of the perovskite solar cells based on 1% MnI2 excessive doping was up to 19.09%, which was superior to 17.68% of the MAPbI3-based devices. In addition, the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) films possessed large grains and tunable bandgaps. Meanwhile, efficiency of 6.40% was still obtained when the substitution content was increased to 12.5%. Consequently, the perovskite solar cells based on Mn incorporation have enormous potentials for applications and provide a potential pathway for non/less-lead hybrid perovskite materials.

Halide perovskites have been widely applied in photoelectric devices, especially in solar cells, due to their intrinsic properties such as long diffusion length, high charge carrier mobility, strong absorption coefficient and appropriate direct bandgap. Recently, perovskite solar cells successfully achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2%.

To date, the doping approach has played an active role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Typically, appropriate doping in MAPbI3 can optimize the bandgap and the morphology of the films. Therefore, both experimental and theoretical studies have been undertaken on the doping in MAPbI3 (MA = [CH3NH3]+) materials, such as the fractional replacement of I or MA sites. Meanwhile, doping of Pb sites is considered important as the heavy metal lead is harmful to the human body and pollutes the environment. Importantly, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on lead replaced by other metallic ions can not only reduce environmental pollution but also adjust the bandgap and morphology of the perovskite films. Therefore, more and more researchers are trying to replace or partially replace lead with other metal ions. The most remarkable interest has been shown in the incorporation of manganese cations in hybrid perovskites. Mn2+ possesses a much smaller cationic radius (80 pm) than that of Pb2+ (119 pm), which gives an opportunity for easy replacement. Moreover, the electrical properties of the perovskite materials can be tuned by Mn incorporation due to its 3d orbital. Enhanced chemical stability in water was obtained for a perovskite prepared by incorporating abundant MnAc2·4H2O in a perovskite precursor solution in 2019. However, PCE was slightly reduced from 15.6% to 12.3% after the substitution ratio of manganese ion was 5%. Almost at the same time, He et al. found that the efficiency of PSCs based on 0.2% MnCl2 doped in the perovskite could be improved from 12.67% to 14.72% compared to that of a device without manganese cations. Although they reported that manganese ions have advantages when incorporated in hybrid perovskites, the efficiency and performance of PSCs are less than satisfactory. It can also be seen from these two papers that excessive Mn2+ doping improved the efficiency of PSCs, while Mn2+ replacement reduced the performance of PSCs.
Here, perovskites with the formula MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and 1% MnI2 doped in MAPbI3 were prepared. With excessive 1% Mn2+-doped MAPbI3, the film had larger crystal sizes than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film. The optimization results from first-principles calculations revealed that Mn2+ could be easily inserted into the interstices of octahedral [PbI6]4− to restrain the generation of vacancy defects accompanying perovskite crystallization. These will improve the quality of the microcrystalline thin films during the annealing process and reduce carrier recombination. However, when Mn2+ ions were substituted for Pb ions in the lattice, such as in MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 50%), obvious crystal boundaries and pinholes could be observed on the surface of the films. The poor film morphology would cause large current leakage and poor performance of PSCs. Eventually, the PSCs based on 1% MnI2 excessive doping in MAPbI3 exhibited the best performance, with Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 22.75 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.77 and PCE of 19.09%, which represented about 8% enhancement as compared with that of pristine MAPbI3. Meanwhile, efficiency of 6.40% was still obtained when the substitution content was increased to 12.5%. Consequently, PSCs based on Mn incorporation have enormous potentials for applications and provide a potential pathway for non/less-lead hybrid perovskite materials.

The performance of PSCs greatly depends on the quality of the perovskite films. Perovskite films with different concentrations of Mn2+ substitution were prepared. In Fig. 1, the top-view SEM images of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25%, and 50%) and excessive 1% MnI2-doped MAPbI3 present the perovskite thin-film morphology. With excessive 1% Mn2+ doping in MAPbI3 and with the increase in the substitution ratio of Mn2+, the grain size of the perovskite thin films becomes larger. A summary of the mechanisms of MAPb1−xMnxI3 formation with substituting Mn2+ and interstitial Mn2+ is outlined in Fig. 2a. When the content of MnI2 was excessive, i.e., 1%, the optimization results from first-principles calculations revealed that Mn2+ could be easily inserted into the interstices of octahedral [PbI6]4− to restrain the generation of vacancy defects accompanying perovskite crystallization (Fig. S1, ESI). During the annealing process, excess Mn2+ aggregated in the grain boundaries, slowing down the perovskite crystallization process, providing a passivating effect and leading to the formation of larger crystalline and more uniform perovskite layers. With the partial replacement of Pb2+ with Mn2+, both Mn2+ and Pb2+ acted as the nuclei. The addition of MnI2 accelerates nucleation by incorporating heterogeneous nucleation, which is faster than homogeneous nucleation due to the lowering of the nucleation free energy barrier in the pristine MAPbI3 thin film. The faster nucleation process in crystallization generates larger crystal domains. However, when the doping concentration was over 25%, obvious crystal boundaries and pinholes could be observed on the surface of the films. Mn2+ ions can slightly distort the crystal structure of the perovskite MAPbI3 because of its small ionic size, which can decrease the bond length of Pb–I (Table S1, ESI). During film formation, when the Mn-doping concentration is higher, the Pb–I distance and the octahedral tilting angles are greater, and the MAPb1−xMnxI3 perovskites can become unstable. Hence, a discontinuous film was formed, resulting in a large current leakage and a poor performance of PSCs. Thus, we chose to prepare PSCs based on an Mn substitution content of less than 12.5%. The EELS analysis of excessive 1% MnI2-doped MAPbI3 showed that Mn and Pb were uniformly distributed (Fig. 1g). XRD was carried out to study the MAPb1−xMnxI3 film crystallinity (Fig. 1h and i). In the XRD spectra, diffraction peaks around 14° and 28° are clearly observed and can be assigned to the (101) and (202) lattice planes, respectively, which indicates that the MAPbI3 film is formed with good quality. Only one peak was observed for each lattice plane for the mixed metal perovskites, indicating that the Mn2+ and Pb2+ cations were evenly distributed in the lattices rather than forming phases of different species. Moreover, the diffraction angles slightly decreased for the (101) and (202) peaks with excessive 1% Mn2+-doped MAPbI3 (Fig. 1i) because the unit cell for the interstitial incorporation of Mn increased, as per the computing result (Table S1, ESI). However, the diffraction angles gradually increased as the substituted Mn2+ content increased (Fig. 1i). The peak shift towards higher diffraction angles suggested shrinkage in the lattice parameters of MAPb1−xMnxI3 probably caused by the gradual replacement of the smaller Mn2+ cations by the larger Pb2+ cations. At the same time, the calculated results also showed that the cell volume decreased continuously as the Mn2+ content increased (Table S1, ESI).


Fig. 2b shows the band structure and density of states for MAPbxMn1−xI3. The annealing temperature of the perovskite film was 349–379 K, which was consistent with the previously reported cubic Pmm structure at room temperature (T > 300 K). Fig. S2 (ESI) shows the Rietveld refinement XRD pattern of the perovskite films. Apart from the peaks of FTO, the other peaks corresponded well to the calculations for the perovskites, which showed that our theoretical model was convincing. The bandgap values of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 12.5%) and excessive Mn2+-doped MAPbI3 were 1.677, 1.815, and 1.819 eV, respectively. For MAPbI3, the valence and conduction bands are dominated by the p orbitals of I and Pb. The replacement of Pb2+ with Mn2+ introduced localized electronic states at ∼2 eV below the valence band maximum. The valence band maximum exhibited strong hybridization between the Pb p and Mn 3d states. In addition, in order to study the potential of Mn replacement for Pb, we calculated the electronic and optical properties of MAPbxMn1−xI3 (where x = 0, 12.5%, 25%, 50%). Table S1 (ESI) sums up the optimized octahedral tilting angles and Pb–I and Mn–I distances of the perovskites with different Mn2+ concentrations. Obviously, the calculated bond length and octahedral tilting angles (θ) of the perovskites were similar to the experimental values, which indicated that the calculated data could be used to analyze the properties of the samples. Then, the structural and electronic properties of MAPb1−xMnxI3 were analyzed. The MAPb1−xMnxI3 structures were calculated, corresponding to the Mn contents of 12.5%, 25% and 50%. Fig. 3 exhibits the calculated band structure of MAPb1−xMnxI3. In particular, the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) perovskites were all direct bandgap materials, which is beneficial for optical materials. The calculated energy gap of bulk MAPbI3 was 1.667 eV, which was in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.587 eV (Table S3, ESI). The small error in the bandgap energies between the calculations and experiment may be because spin orbital coupling (SOC), magnetic coupling and the effect of photoexcited carriers were ignored. The bandgap values of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) were 1.677, 1.815, 1.877 and 1.697 eV, respectively. The detailed bandgap data are shown in Table S2 (ESI). In order to investigate the effects of the partial replacement of Pb with Mn on the electronic structure, the projected density of states (PDOS) of the atomic orbitals of the pristine MAPbI3 and MAPb1−xMnxI3 systems was calculated. In Fig. 3, the symmetrical DOS indicates that the MAPbI3 perovskites are nonmagnetic. However, for the mixed systems, the spin-up and spin-down DOSs were not completely symmetrical, indicating that perovskite MAPb1−xMnxI3 exhibited magnetic properties, as shown in Fig. 3b. From our calculation, the total magnetic moment of the perovskite MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 12.5%) atom was 4 μB and the magnetic properties of the systems could be mainly attributed to the contribution of Mn incorporation. Moreover, the contributions from the Mn atom and its nearest neighbouring I atoms were 3.58 μB/Mn, and 0.05 μB/I, respectively. Although I atoms exhibited spin polarization, their contribution to the magnetic moment was negligible. It is clear that the spin resided mainly on the Mn atoms, and I atoms only made a very minor contribution to the total magnetic moment. The magnetic coupling between Mn atoms indicates the potential applications in magnetic fields. Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida long range coupling is present in the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 10%) sample and Nafradi et al. applied it to optically switch magnetism, which indicated the potential application of MAPb1−xMnxI3 in magnetic fields. Furthermore, the valence and conduction bands were dominated by the p and s orbitals of I and Pb, respectively. The valence bands ranged from −5 eV to 0 eV and there existed strong hybridization between the Pb p, Pb s, and I p states. The replacement of Pb2+ with Mn2+ introduced localized electronic states at ∼5 eV below the valence band maximum. The valence band maximum ranged from 0 eV to 5 eV and there existed strong hybridization between the Pb p and Mn 3d states. With the increase in the doping ratio from 0 to 25%, the contribution of Mn to the conduction band was obviously enhanced. Thus, Mn incorporation can increase the bandgaps. However, when the doping content was increased to 50%, the bandgaps decreased because the conduction band contribution of Mn obviously decreased (Fig. S3, ESI). From the calculations, we can infer that Mn-replacing Pb has enormous potential applications and provides a potential pathway for non/less-lead hybrid perovskite materials.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also applied to verify substitution of Pb2+ by Mn2+ and to analyse the oxidation states and the chemical bonding states of I and Pb in the MAPb1−xMnxI3 films. Fig. 4a shows the Mn peak at 641.1 eV with broad shoulders at lower and higher binding energies, hinting at the presence of Mn2+ in 1% MnI2-doped MAPbI3. The appearance of the Mn 2p orbital feature verified that Pb2+ is indeed partially replaced by Mn2+. Fig. 4b shows the XPS spectra of the total elements from the 1% MnI2-doped MAPbI3 thin film. The XPS spectra of I and Pb from the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 thin films are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The binding energy (BE) of Pb 4f7/2 was around 136.0 eV, which was consistent with previous results. The spectra also showed well separated spin–orbit components with a separation of around 4.9 eV, which is typically related to Pb(II). Fig. 4d shows the I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2 spectra, revealing a well-separated spin–orbital component of around 11.5 eV, which represents I. When the doping content of manganese was increased from 0 to 50%, a slight shift towards high binding energy for I 3d was observed for the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 thin films. These results further indicated that Mn was bonded to I since only the Pb–I bonds constructed the octahedral framework in the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 12.5%, 25%, and 50%) thin films. Such a slight shift towards high binding energy probably originates from the decreased Mn–I distance, which results in the distortion of the [Pb(Mn)I6]4− octahedra, consequently leading to higher energy in the Pb(Mn)–I bonding. This suggests slight changes in the oxidation state of I due to the different interactions between the Pb2+ and Mn2+ cations, as can be observed from the theoretical calculations above. With the increase in Mn concentration, the changes in bond length and angle of the Pb–I bond became more and more obvious (Table S1, ESI). It was also observed (Fig. 4c) that the peak shifts for Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 were similar to those of I 3d. Therefore, the appearance of the binding energy shifts of I and Pb for the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) films demonstrated that Pb2+ was indeed partially substituted by Mn2+ in MAPb1−xMnxI3. In order to obtain the detailed bandgap and energy level distribution, UV-vis absorption and ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS) were performed. In Fig. 5b, we can observe that the absorption intensity decreases gradually with the increase in Mn concentration except for a slight increase for the excessive 1% Mn2+-doped sample. This result is similar to the calculated result, as shown in Fig. 5c. The bandgaps of the perovskites were estimated by transforming the UV/vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5b) into Tauc plots (Fig. 5d). According to the Kubelka–Munk theory, the bandgaps of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 thin films were determined to be 1.587, 1.592, 1.593, 1.600, 1.580 and 1.590 eV, respectively. Fig. 5b and c show the absorbance coefficients of the perovskites from the calculations and experiments. From Fig. 5b and c, we can infer that the absorption range of MAPb1−xMnxI3 covers almost all visible light and there are slight shifts to the high energy side with Mn incorporation, which is consistent with the increasing bandgap. The slight shifts to the high energy side also lead to a blue-shift behavior. Fig. 5e shows a comparison of the bandgap results from the calculation and experiment. From Fig. 5c and e, both the absorption spectrum and the bandgap results from calculation are almost similar to the results from experiment. These excellent optical properties could be supposed to be useful for photovoltaic applications. The specific energy levels were determined using UPS, where the valence band energy levels of MAPb1−xMnxI3 were determined (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5a shows the UPS spectrum for the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 films. The Fermi level was calculated using the equation EF = 21.22 − EB, where the excitation energy is 21.22 eV (from the width of the He I UPS spectra), EF is the Fermi level, and EB is the high binding energy cut-off. The detailed analysis of the full UPS spectra can be obtained from Fig. S4 and Table S3 (ESI). The Fermi levels of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 were −4.27, −4.44, −4.52, −4.53, −4.56 and −4.28 eV, respectively. The valence band maximum of MAPbI3 was −5.49 eV (−4.27 to 1.22). The conduction band maximum of MAPbI3 could be calculated by adding the optical bandgap as −3.903 eV (−5.49 to +1.587). Similarly, the detailed energy levels of the Mn-substituted perovskite film could be calculated. Fig. 5f shows the final energy level diagram of perovskite films.
The SEM cross-sectional images of PSCs are shown in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b shows the structure of PSCs. The photovoltaic properties of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5% and 12.5%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 were investigated by the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs with a device structure of FTO/TiO2/MAPb1−xMnxI3/spiro/Ag. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs fabricated by MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, and 12.5%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 6c. Table 1 summarizes the device performance parameters under AM 1.5G illumination. The PSCs fabricated by MAPbI3 exhibited short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.04 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V, and FF of 75%, with the corresponding PCE of 17.68%. Under the same conditions, the PSCs based on 1% Mn incorporation exhibited the best performance, with Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 22.75 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.77 and PCE of 19.09% (Fig. 6e), which was about 8% enhancement as compared with that of pristine MAPbI3. The enhanced Voc was probably related to the increased bandgap after Mn incorporation. However, when the Mn incorporation concentration was more than 5%, the performance of PSCs started to decline gradually. When 12.5% Mn was replaced by lead, the efficiency of the PSCs was 6.4%. This is because a small amount of doping will increase the grain size of the film, but a very high doping content will increase the crystal boundary and pinholes of the film. The poor films would then cause large current leakage, resulting in lower Jsc and worse performance of PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs fabricated by the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5% and 12.5%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 films are shown in Fig. 6d. The PSCs fabricated by the pristine MAPbI3 thin film showed a wide photoresponse from 350 to 800 nm, with the EQE values approaching 85% in the visible region, reflecting the weakly bound excitons in the pristine MAPbI3 film and the effective charge transfer process in PSCs. The EQE values from the PSCs based on excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 increased over 90%. The integration of the EQE spectra over the wavelength range from 375 to 800 nm afforded the photocurrents of 20.56 and 21.74 mA cm−2 for PSCs fabricated by MAPbI3 and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3, respectively. The values of integrated Jsc were 19.09 and 15.87 mA cm−2 for the PSCs based on MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 5% and 12.5%, respectively), which were in accordance with Jsc of the J–V curve. These integrated Jsc values were in good agreement with the Jsc values observed from the J–V characteristics. Fig. 6f shows the PL spectra of the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5%, and 12.5%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 films. The samples were deposited on FTO substrates with an excitation light of 465 nm. For the pristine perovskite film, a peak of PL at 790 nm was observed. With Mn-doping, blue-shifts of the PL peaks were observed, which was consistent with the enlarged energy bandgap due to Mn doping. Another phenomenon was that the PL intensity was obviously reduced for the 1% Mn-incorporated perovskite film. Mn doping decreases carrier recombination to reduce the PL intensity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to investigate the charge transfer properties in PSCs. EIS was conducted in the dark at an applied bias of −1.0 V with the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The main arc at the high-frequency area includes the series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the relevant capacitor (CPE1). The equivalent circuit, which can be simplified to the circuit model, is shown in the inset of Fig. 6g.Rs was assumed to be the same because all PSCs possessed the same device structure (Fig. S6, ESI). In the Nyquist plot, Rct is represented by a different arc at the high-frequency region. Thus, the major difference is Rct induced by various film morphologies and crystal structures of MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5% and 12.5%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 active layers. The lowest Rct value for excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 indicated enhanced electron extraction capacity from the perovskite. For the excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 thin film, the improved film quality and larger grains as well as the dramatically suppressed trap densities facilitated the charge carrier transfer process, which resulted in dramatically decreased Rct. As a result, high Jsc was observed for the PSCs fabricated by the excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 film.

To investigate air stability, the PSCs based on MAPbI3 and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 were stored in an ambient atmosphere (30% relative humidity and 25 °C temperature) without encapsulation for 48 h (Fig. 6g). The PSCs based on pristine MAPbI3 retained 87% of their initial PCE after ambient air for 48 h. The PSCs based on excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 retained 95% of their initial PCE, which represents greater stability than that for the pristine MAPbI3 device.

In summary, mixed Mn–Pb halide perovskites were studied with respect to both theory calculations and experiment and were further applied in solar cells. From the calculations, it was inferred that the MAPb1−xMnxI3 materials have suitable bandgaps and promising absorption coefficients, which indicate the good application prospects in perovskite solar cells. From the experiments, the absorption and bandgap of MAPb1−xMnxI3 were in good agreement with the calculated results, and the MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 0, 5% and 12.5%) and excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 samples possessed larger grain sizes and bandgaps than the pristine perovskite films. The PSCs based on excessive 1% Mn-doped MAPbI3 possessed the best photovoltaic performance, with PCE up to 19.09%. Meanwhile, there was still efficiency of 6.40% when the doping content was increased to 12.5%. Consequently, PSCs based on Mn doping have enormous potential applications and provide a potential pathway for non/less-lead hybrid perovskite materials.


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the ab initio VASP code. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the pseudo potential of projector augmented wave (PAW), Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) were employed. The energy cut-off of plane waves was 500 eV. All the samples convergence criteria had an energy cut-off of 1 × 10−4 eV and a maximum force of 0.09 eV Å−1. For geometry optimization of the bulk perovskite, a 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack grid was adopted for sampling the Brillouin zone. The calculated lattice constants were a = b = 6.3115 Å and c = 6.3161 Å for bulk MAPbI3 perovskite. These parameters correspond well with the experimental values (a = b = 6.26 Å and c = 6.33 Å for bulk perovskite).


Titanium isopropoxide (99.999% purity), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8% purity) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8% purity) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9% purity) was received from Sinopharm Group. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.99% purity), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99% purity) and spiro-OMeTAD (99.95% purity) were supplied by Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.


FTO glasses were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min each in deionized water, acetone and ethanol, respectively. Then, the FTO glasses were dried under flowing N2 and treated with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. For preparing the TiO2 dense layer precursor solution, 369 μL titanium isopropoxide and 35 μL hydrochloric acid (2 M) were dissolved in 2.53 mL isopropanol, respectively. The hydrochloric acid solution was added dropwise into titanium isopropoxide. After being stirred for one hour, the precursor solution was spin-coated on the cleaned FTO glasses at 2500 rpm for 30 s, dried at 125 °C for 15 min, and finally annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. The MAPbI3 films were prepared by a spin-coating method. Typically, 159 mg MAI and 472 mg PbI2 were dissolved in a mixed solution of 0.16 mL DMSO and 0.64 mL DMF under stirring over 6 h at 70 °C. 1% MnI2-doped MAPbI3 films were also prepared by a one-step spin-coating method. Also, 1% mmol MnI2, 159 mg MAI and 472 mg PbI2 were dissolved in a mixed solution of 0.16 mL DMSO and 0.64 mL DMF under stirring for 6 h at 70 °C. Likewise, MAPb1−xMnxI3 (where x = 5%, 12.5%, 25% and 50%) films were prepared with different content ratios of MnI2 and PbI2. The precursor solution was spin-coated on the TiO2 compact layer at 500 rpm for 3 s, 4000 rpm for 20 s. In the tenth second during high spinning, chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent was rapidly added to the films for enhancing the film quality. Immediately, the perovskite films were annealed at 75 °C for 10 min, 105 °C for 10 min. The spiro-OMeTAD layer was synthesized on a clean FTO glass as per a previous work. Finally, the devices were completed by evaporation of 150 nm Ag electrodes (0.1 nm s−1), with a shadow mask to determine the device area of 0.09 cm2.


The morphology of the samples was acquired by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Photoluminescence measurements were obtained using Edinburgh F900. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 650S spectrophotometer with the wavelength range from 350 to 800 nm. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy were conducted using AXIS Supra. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were acquired on a Keithley 2400 Source under the illumination of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Newport 91150 USA).
