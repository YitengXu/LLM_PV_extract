The development of all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) is limited by the lack of polymer acceptors. An effective strategy to design high-efficiency polymer acceptors is to copolymerize small molecular acceptors with electron-rich linking units. In this work, we develop a new polymer acceptor by copolymerizing a small molecular acceptor with an electron-deficient linking unit based on the boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B←N). The incorporation of B←N into the polymer acceptor downshifts the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of the polymer by ca. 0.1 eV, and thus facilitates photo-induced hole transfer from the polymer acceptor to polymer donor. The all-PSC device based on the polymer acceptor containing B←N exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.3%, which is much higher than that of the control polymer acceptor without B←N (PCE = 7.2%). This is attributed to the improved phase separation morphology and the facilitated photo-induced hole transfer of the active layer based on the polymer acceptor containing B←N. These results suggest that B←N based building blocks with electron-deficient properties are promising to design high-performance polymer acceptors.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which utilize blends of polymer electron donors and polymer electron acceptors as the photoactive layer, have attracted considerable attention because of their great advantages of excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties. In the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to the development of all-PSCs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-PSCs has been boosted from ca. 2% to over 15%, indicating that all-PSCs are a promising photovoltaic technology. However, the PCE of all-PSCs is still lower than that of typical organic solar cells, which always use blends of polymer donors and small molecular acceptors as the photoactive layer. This is due to the lack of high-performance polymer acceptors. Generally, polymer acceptors are designed with electron-deficient building blocks based on imide, boron–nitrogen coordination bonds (B←N), or cyano groups. The all-PSC devices of these polymer acceptors exhibit a PCE of 10–12%. Our group recently focused on polymer acceptors containing B←N. In 2017, Li et al. proposed a new strategy to design polymer acceptors by polymerizing acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecular acceptors with π-conjugated linking units. After careful optimization of chemical structures and all-PSC devices, polymer acceptors of this strategy can yield a PCE exceeding 15%. This motivated us to combine Li's strategy of “polymerizing small molecular acceptors” and our strategy of “B←N” to design high-efficiency polymer acceptors.

In Li's strategy of “polymerizing small molecular acceptors”, the typical π-conjugated linking units are electron-donating, such as thiophene, thienyl-benzodithiophene, etc.51–57 This is due to synthesis availability of bis-trimethyltin monomers of electron-donating linking units, which enable Stille polymerization to give polymer acceptors. It is challenging to synthesize bis-trimethyltin monomers of electron-deficient linking units because the C–Sn bond is not adequately stable. Therefore, there are very few reports of copolymerizing small molecular acceptors with electron-deficient linking units to develop polymer acceptors. The only example is Guo et al.'s paper, in which electron-deficient bithiophene imide is used as the linking unit. The resulting polymer acceptor shows excellent all-PSC device performance. In our previous paper, we have disclosed that B←N has electron-withdrawing capability and that building blocks based on B←N are strongly electron-deficient. Therefore, it is interesting to copolymerize small molecular acceptors with B←N based electron-deficient linking units to design polymer acceptors.
The benchmark small molecule acceptors are the Y-series molecules, which are initially developed by Zou et al. These Y-series small molecule acceptors have also been copolymerized with thiophene linking units to design high-performance polymer acceptors. In this manuscript, we polymerize a Y-series small molecule acceptor and an electron-deficient B←N bridged bithiophene linking unit to develop a novel polymer acceptor, PBN25. Its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1a. The all-PSC device based on PBN25 exhibits a PCE of as high as 14.3%. In comparison, the control polymer without the B←N unit (PBN25-CC, see Fig. 1a) shows a PCE of only 7%. We find that incorporation of B←N downshifts the LUMO/HOMO energy levels (ELUMO/EHOMO) of the polymer acceptor and enables efficient photo-induced exciton dissociation, leading to enhanced PCE of all-PSC devices. These results indicate that B←N based electron-deficient building blocks are promising for molecular design of high-performance polymer acceptors.

The chemical structures of the polymer acceptor PBN25 and the control polymer PBN25-CC are shown in Fig. 1a. Their synthetic routes are presented in the ESI. The di-bromo monomer of the Y-series small molecule acceptor was synthesized following the literature methods. The two bis-trimethyltin monomers with and without B←N were prepared according to our previously reported paper. Finally, PBN25 and PBN25-CC were synthesized by Stille polymerization of the corresponding monomers. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity (PDI) of PBN25 and PBN25-CC are 11.2 kDa/2.25 and 10.8 kDa/2.31, respectively. Both the polymers are readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the two polymers (Fig. S1) indicates excellent thermal stability. PBN25 and PBN25-CC show thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss of 300 °C and 307 °C, respectively.

To investigate the effect of B←N on the energy levels of polymer acceptors, we employed cyclic voltammetry to estimate the ELUMO/EHOMO of PBN25 and PBN25-CC. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 1b. According to the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the ELUMO/EHOMO of PBN25 and PBN25-CC are estimated to be −3.93 eV/−5.74 eV and −3.85 eV/−5.59 eV, respectively (see Table 1). The ELUMO and EHOMO of PBN25 are lower than those of PBN25-CC by 0.08 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively. This is attributed to the electron withdrawing properties of B←N in PBN25. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBN25 and PBN25-CC in thin film are shown in Fig. 1c. PBN25 and PBN25-CC exhibit similar absorption spectra and their maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) are 792 nm and 799 nm, respectively. Both the polymers possess high absorption coefficients exceeding 105 M−1 cm−1. The optical bandgap of PBN25 and PBN25-CC is estimated to be 1.44 eV and 1.43 eV, respectively. These data indicate that B←N only slightly affects the optical properties of the polymer acceptors. The absorption spectra of PBN25 and PBN25-CC in solution are only slightly dependent on the solution temperature (see Fig. S3), suggesting weak aggregation of polymer chains in solution. This is probably due to the large steric hindrance effect of the phenyl groups on the boron atom or the sp3-carbon atom. The electron mobilities (µe) of PBN25 and PBN25-CC were measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with the electron-only devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S9 and the µe values are listed in Table 1. The µe of PBN25 (µe = 1.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher by ca. 4 times than that of PBN25-CC (µe = 3.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was employed to study the molecular stacking behaviors of the two polymers in thin film. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns of PBN25 and PBN25-CC are shown in Fig. S6. Both the polymers show the (010) π–π stacking peak at q = 16.5 nm−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) orientation, suggesting face-on orientation of the polymer chains. We calculate the coherence length (CL) of the (010) peaks of the two polymers using the Scherrer equation. PBN25 exhibits a CL value of 1.8 nm and PBN25-CC shows a CL value of 1.1 nm. PBN25 shows stronger crystallinity in thin film than PBN25, which is in accordance with its enhanced electron mobility.

PM6 (Fig. 1d) is a commercially available polymer donor. To fabricate all-PSC devices, we selected PM6 as the polymer donor to pair with PBN25 and PBN25-CC as the polymer acceptors. Fig. 1d shows the energy level alignment of PBN25, PBN25-CC and PM6. The lower EHOMO of PBN25 compared to PBN25-CC is expected to facilitate charge separation on the donor/acceptor interface. The device configuration is indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:acceptor/3,3′-(1,3,8,10-tetraoxoanthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-2,9(1H,3H,8H,10H)-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine oxide) (PDINO)/Al. The active layers were spin-coated at room temperature with a blend solution of PBN25 or PBN25-CC and PM6 in chloroform with 1.8% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the solvent additive. The J–V curves of the two all-PSC devices under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2a and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The device based on PM6:PBN25 shows a PCE of 14.36%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 22.62 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.6%. In comparison, the device of PM6:PBN25-CC exhibits a PCE of 7.17%, with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 12.40 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.5%. As shown in Fig. 2b, both the devices exhibit broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra covering from 300 nm to 900 nm. The maximum EQE value of the PBN25 based device is 0.75 at 560 nm, which is much higher than that of the PBN25-CC based device (0.47 at 560 nm). These results suggest that the incorporation of B←N into the polymer acceptor results in improved all-PSC device performance. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of PBN25 is the highest value reported so far for organoboron polymer acceptors.

The active layer morphology of the all-PSC devices was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2D-GIWAXS. Fig. 3a–d shows the AFM height images and TEM images of the PM6:PBN25 and PM6:PBN25-CC active layers. Obviously, the PM6:PBN25 blend shows smaller size phase separation and smoother surface than those of the PM6:PBN25-CC blend. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PM6:PBN25 blend and the PM6:PBN25-CC blend is 1.96 nm and 2.33 nm, respectively. The small-size phase separation of the PM6:PBN25 blend is consistent with the high EQE and JSC of the all-PSC devices. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the two blends are shown in Fig. S7. Because the (010) peak only appears in the out-of-plane direction, both the polymer donor and the polymer acceptors adopt face-on orientation in the two blends. The calculated CL value of the (010) peak is 2.1 nm for the PM6:PBN25 blend and 1.2 nm for the PM6:PBN25-CC blend. This suggests stronger crystallinity of polymer chains in the PM6:PBN25 blend than in the PM6:PBN25-CC blend.
The electron mobility and hole mobility (µh) of the active layers were estimated by the SCLC method with the electron-only devices (ITO/PEIE/active layer/Ca/Al) and the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al), respectively. As listed in Table 2, the PM6:PBN25-CC blend film exhibits a µe of 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a µh of 5.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the PM6:PBN25 blend film exhibits a µe of 6.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a µh of 6.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared with the PM6:PBN25-CC blend, the PM6:PBN25 blend shows higher and more balanced electron/hole mobilities, which are consistent with the enhanced JSC and FF of the corresponding all-PSC devices. The dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) of the all-PSC devices was measured to evaluate the charge collection efficiency (Pc). Fig. 2c shows the Jph–Veff curves of the two devices. For the PM6:PBN25 based device, Jph keeps increasing as Veff increases and gets saturated at low Veff. In contrast, the Jph of the PM6:PBN25-CC device keeps increasing even at high Veff. Pc is defined as Jph,sc/Jph,sat, in which Jph,sc is the Jph under short-circuit conditions and Jph,sat is the Jph saturated at a certain Veff. The Pc of the PM6:PBN25 device is 96.0%, which is much higher than that of the PM6:PBN25-CC device (Pc = 80.3%). This result is consistent with the higher EQE in the former case than in the latter case. The charge recombination behaviors of the two all-PSC devices were investigated from the dependence of JSC on light intensity (P). JSC follows a power exponential dependence on light intensity and can be expressed as JSC ∝ Pα, where α is the calculated power-law exponent. The α value should be close to 1 when bimolecular recombination of charge carriers is negligible. The α values for the PBN25-based device and the PBN25-CC-based device are 0.979 and 0.944, respectively. Therefore, bimolecular recombination is weaker in the PBN25-based device than in the PBN25-CC-based device. This is consistent with the higher and more balanced electron/hole mobilities in the former case than in the latter case.
To study the photoinduced charge transfer between the polymer donor and the two polymer acceptors in the all-PSC devices, we carried out femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy with the two active layers. According to the steady state absorption spectra of the polymers, we used a pump wavelength of 800 nm to selectively excite the polymer acceptors in the active layers. Fig. S12 shows the TA spectra of the two active layers. The hole transfer from the polymer acceptors to polymer donor can be monitored by the appearance of ground state bleach (GSB) of PM6 in the blend films at 630 nm. Fig. 4a shows the decay dynamics of GSB at 630 nm of the two active layers. For the PM6:PBN25-CC blend, the GSB reaches the peak in 1 ps and then recovers rapidly. In comparison, for the PM6:PBN25 film, the GSB continuously increases till 10 ps. These results indicate that the hole transfer is more efficient in the PM6:PBN25 blend than in the PM6:PBN25-CC blend. This is probably due to the larger HOMO offset of donor/acceptor in the former case than in the latter case. The incorporation of B←N downshifts the HOMO levels of the polymer acceptor and contributes to the improved hole transfer, leading to enhanced PCE of the PM6:PBN25 all-PSC device. In addition, the excellent phase separation morphology of the PM6:PBN25 blend may also contribute to the improved hole transfer. The improved hole transfer in the PM6:PBN25 blend is also supported by the fluorescence quenching results. As shown in Fig. 4b, the fluorescence of PBN25 is quenched by 94.9% in the PM6:PBN25 blend while the fluorescence of PBN25-CC is quenched by 88.5% in the PM6:PBN25-CC blend. The fluorescence quenching is mainly due to the hole transfer from the polymer acceptors to the polymer donor. For the PM6:PBN25-CC blend, PM6 and PBN25-CC are well intermixed, and the low fluorescence quenching of PBN25-CC by PM6 is assigned to the inadequate HOMO offset for the photo-induced hole transfer. In contrast, for the PM6:PBN25 blend, the HOMO offset of donor/acceptor is adequately large and the hole transfer becomes efficient.

In summary, we have developed a polymer acceptor by copolymerizing a Y-series small molecular acceptor with an electron-deficient B←N-based linking unit. The incorporation of B←N downshifts the ELUMO/EHOMO by ca. 0.1 eV and does not greatly change the optical properties of the polymer acceptor. The all-PSC device based on PBN-25 exhibits a PCE of 14.3%, which is much higher than that of the control polymer acceptor without B←N. This is attributed to the improved active layer morphology and the facilitated photo-induced hole transfer from the polymer acceptor to the polymer donor. These results prove that B←N based building blocks with electron-deficient properties are promising to design high-performance polymer acceptors.
