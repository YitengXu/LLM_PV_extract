Organo-metal halide perovskite solar cells have shown great potential for application in photovoltaics with their high power conversion efficiency. For the future commercialisation of perovskite solar cells, it is crucial to simplify their device structures while maintaining their efficiency. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in the simplification of device structures for low-cost, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells after briefly reviewing the evolution of the device structures of perovskite solar cells.

In the 21st century, the growing demand of energy for human development worldwide calls for the exploitation and utilisation of renewable energy resources. As an inexhaustible and clean resource, solar energy has always been a research focus of scientists. Over the last few decades, many photovoltaic technologies have emerged, such as silicon-based solar cells, CuInxGa1−xSe2 thin film solar cells, dye-sensitised solar cells, and organic photovoltaic cells. However, their application has been impeded by the high material or fabrication cost. In the past few years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed rapidly, showing huge potential for application due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low material cost.

A typical PSC consists of a perovskite active layer sandwiched between a hole transport layer (HTL) and an electron transport layer (ETL), as well as two corresponding electrodes to collect holes/electrons. The active layer usually employs organo-metal halide compounds with an ABX3 perovskite structure (Fig. 1), which possess outstanding features such as high absorption coefficient, small exciton binding energy, high charge-carrier mobilities, and long electron–hole diffusion lengths. Besides, these materials are inexpensive in general and can be deposited by various methods. Furthermore, the adjustable composition of these compounds provides the possibility of tuning their properties. Given the excellent characteristics mentioned above, it is not surprising that the efficiency of PSCs has increased rapidly from 3.8% (ref. 17) to over 20% (ref. 18) in only 6 years. Although major problems, including the toxicity of organo-lead halide perovskites and the long-term device stability, remain to be solved for PSCs, the feasibility of their commercialisation has been investigated.
The commercialisation of PSCs requires scalability, device stability, low material cost, simple manufacturing procedures, low-temperature fabrication, and compatibility for flexible substrates in roll-to-roll manufacturing. To meet these requirements while maintaining the high performance of PSCs, researchers have made tremendous efforts such as designing simple device structures, exploiting facile deposition methods, and developing inexpensive charge transport materials. Among these approaches, the simplification of device structures is an essential link in the mass production of inexpensive and efficient PSCs.
This review article briefly summarises the evolution of the device structures of PSCs, and then focuses on the devices with simplified structures, i.e., HTL-free devices and ETL-free devices. The working principles and architectures of these PSCs and the optimisation of different layers in these devices are also discussed in detail.

The regular structure, in which sunlight enters through the n-side of the cell (Fig. 2a and b) was developed in the earlier stage for PSCs. The very first regular-structured PSCs adopted the structure of dye-sensitised TiO2 solar cells, where CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3, X = I, Br) was applied as the sensitiser. However, the liquid electrolyte would destruct the perovskite crystals and thus deteriorate the device performance. To solve this problem, Park et al. fabricated an all-solid-state PSC adopting the structure fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/MAPbI3/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)/Au (mesoscopic structure, Fig. 2a). Consequently, the PCE was improved to 9.7%. Subsequently, Snaith et al. reported a PCE of 10.9% for their mesoscopic PSC by depositing CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) onto a mesoporous Al2O3 (mp-Al2O3) layer. Different from the case of mp-TiO2, the mp-Al2O3 layer acts only as a scaffold due to its high valence band, which means that the electrons must have been transferred to the compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer. Their work indicated that the perovskite layer is capable of transporting both holes and electrons and enlightened the future simplification of the device structure.

Later on, PSCs with a planar structure (Fig. 2b) were demonstrated, where the mesoporous layer is omitted. Snaith et al. fabricated PSCs in the planar configuration for the first time, where the perovskite layer was directly deposited onto the c-TiO2 layer. Liu and Kelly replaced the c-TiO2 with a layer of low-temperature processed ZnO and achieved a PCE of 15.7%. Yang et al. reported a high PCE of 19.3% for PSCs adopting this configuration using yttrium-doped TiO2 as the ETL and polyethyleneimine ethoxylate-modified indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. These results showed that the architecture without a mesoporous n-type semiconductor is feasible for high-efficiency PSCs.

Since 2013, PSCs with an inverted planar structure (Fig. 2c) have emerged as an alternative to the structure mentioned above. Chen et al. first reported an inverted-structured PSC with the configuration ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/MAPbI3/[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al and obtained a PCE of 3.9%. This structure avoids the use of TiO2 that requires an energy-consuming sintering process, and is thus suitable for fabrication at low temperatures and on flexible substrates. The inverted structure has also displayed a reduced hysteresis effect compared with the TiO2-based regular planar structure. Devices with the inverted structure have been developing very quickly ever since, and their efficiency has been boosted to over 19%.


As a group of ambipolar materials, organo-metal halide perovskites can transport both holes and electrons. Therefore, PSCs without an HTL or ETL may be feasible. Since 2012, HTL-/ETL-free devices have been studied and reported.

The most commonly used hole transport materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PSS, are not only expensive but also detrimental to the stability of devices. The exclusion of the HTL can not only simplify the fabrication process but also bring down the material/manufacturing cost. An HTL-free PSC may adopt a regular (Fig. 2e) or inverted structure (Fig. 2f). In the past four years, the efficiency of HTL-free PSCs has been improved from an initial 5.5% (ref. 33) to a promising 18.1% (ref. 34) that is comparable to HTL-based devices, which shows great potential for future application.
To avoid the use of a high-temperature deposited TiO2 layer, researchers have also attempted to develop ETL-free PSCs. Until now, these devices are all based on the regular structure (Fig. 2d). Although high PCE over 15% (ref. 35 and 36) has been achieved for this type of PSC, it has also been proposed that an ETL may be indispensable for power sustainability. Therefore, the feasibility of ETL-free PSCs should be carefully revisited.

For regular-structured PSCs, organic hole conductors, such as spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, have been employed as hole transport materials, which are costly due to their relatively complex synthesis procedure. Moreover, it has been proposed that the most commonly used spiro-OMeTAD may cause device deterioration. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate the HTL for simpler architectures and lower cost.

Until now, most HTL-free PSCs are based on the regular structure (Fig. 2e). They can be roughly divided into two categories depending on the material of the counter electrode (CE): Au-based HTL-free PSCs (Table 1) and carbon-based HTL-free PSCs (Table 2). There are mainly two configurations for regular-structured HTL-free PSCs. One of them is transparent conducting oxide (TCO, usually FTO or ITO)/ETL/perovskite/Au or carbon. It was reported by Etgar et al. at first (as shown in Fig. 3) and was adopted by the majority of HTL-free PSCs. Another configuration is TCO/ETL/insulating layer/carbon/(perovskite), which features an insulating layer that was designed to avoid the direct contact between the ETL and the anode. This configuration was first reported and developed by Han's group for their fully printable HTL-free PSCs (Fig. 4), where a mesoporous TiO2/ZrO2/carbon triple layer serves as a scaffold to host the perovskite absorber deposited by drop-casting the precursor solution. The ZrO2 insulating layer prevents photoexcited electrons from reaching the back contact and recombining with holes. Other metal oxides, such as Al2O3 (ref. 53) and SiO2, have also proven to be effective spacer layers in mesoscopic HTL-free PSCs.

For regular-structured PSCs, different perovskite materials have been used as the active layer, and modification of the ETL and the anode has also been implemented. These great efforts have promoted their PCE from an initial 5.5% (ref. 33) to over 14% (ref. 55) in the past four years, although their performance still lags behind that of the HTL-based PSCs. It is worth noting that the use of high-temperature deposited TiO2 may hinder the low-temperature fabrication of devices. However, the replacement of TiO2 by low-temperature deposited ETLs, such as ZnO and SnO2, can be a remedy for this problem. Besides, the carbon-based CEs provide the possibility of utility-scale fabrication of regular-structured HTL-free PSCs.

At the early stage of the development of HTL-free devices, researchers have explored the possibility of omitting the HTL in PSCs with the regular structure. Several reports have shown that the hole diffusion length in MAPbI3 or MAPbI3−xClx films is comparable to the thickness of the perovskite films, which indicates that the perovskites can act as both a light harvester and a hole conductor and that PSCs may not necessarily need an HTL. In 2012, Etgar et al. reported the first HTL-free PSC (Fig. 3) with an efficiency of 5.5%, proving the feasibility of excluding the HTL and paving the path to the realisation of low-cost, high-efficiency PSCs.

The photovoltaic performance of regular-structured HTL-free PSCs is determined by the depletion layer formed at the TiO2/perovskite interface, which facilitates the charge separation and inhibits the back transfer of electrons from TiO2 to the perovskite layer. Etgar et al. measured the contact potential difference (CPD) at the nanocrystal TiO2 (nc-TiO2)/MAPbI3 and nanocrystal Al2O3 (nc-Al2O3)/MAPbI3 interfaces using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Fig. 5a and b). The results showed that, although the width of the depletion region at the perovskite side (Wp = 10 nm) is the same for the two interfaces, the depletion at the nc-Al2O3 side of the nc-Al2O3/MAPbI3 interface was negligible, while a 45 nm wide depletion region width was formed at the nc-TiO2/MAPbI3 interface (Fig. 5c and d). Their study revealed the indispensable role of the TiO2 layer in forming the depletion region in HTL-free PSCs.
The metal oxide/perovskite interface also significantly influences the open circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs. Etgar et al. demonstrated that the mp-Al2O3/MAPbBr3-based HTL-free cells had a smaller surface potential than the mp-Al2O3/MAPbI3 cells that could result in a higher Voc. The mp-Al2O3-based cells also showed longer recombination lifetimes than those of the TiO2-based devices, which can also contribute to the high Voc. The result shows the possibility to gain high Voc in HTL-free PSCs.

In HTL-free PSCs, the perovskite layer acts both as the light absorber and the hole conductor. Therefore, it is crucial to modify and optimise the perovskite layer to enhance its light absorption and hole transport, which are not only determined by the composition of the perovskite material itself but also influenced by the preparation methods of the perovskite layer.

There have been several reports on the composition modification of perovskites in HTL-free devices. Etgar et al. employed MAPbInBr3−n as the light absorber and obtained a maximum PCE of 8.54%. The introduction of Br− ions leads to the formation of a cubic-structured perovskite with improved stability while only changing the bandgap slightly. Grätzel and Han et al. introduced 5-ammonium valeric acid (5-AVA) to template the crystal growth of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3. The mixed-cation perovskite showed a lower defect concentration and better infiltration compared to MAPbI3, leading to a longer exciton lifetime and a significant increase in the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 6). Consequently, the PCE of the cell reached 12.8% with a greatly promoted short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.8 mA cm−2. Also, the device was stable in ambient air for over 1008 h under full sunlight. Han and co-workers achieved a PCE of 11.9% in FAPbI3 (FA = NH2CHNH2)-based HTL-free PSCs, and enhanced the PCE to 12.9% by employing (FA)0.6(MA)0.4PbI3, which shows stronger light absorption and reduced recombination as compared to FAPbI3. Efforts have also been made to investigate the possibility of using a purely inorganic perovskite in HTL-free PSCs. Ho-Baillie et al. demonstrated a CsPbIBr2-based HTL-free PSC with a maximum PCE of 4.7% and good thermal stability, which has the potential for tandem silicon cells in the future. An alternative modification method is the co-deposition of the perovskite and other materials that may improve the device performance. Han et al. introduced LiCl as an additive to the perovskite film, which does not only enable faster electron transport but also improves the crystallinity of the perovskite film. As a result, the PCE of the LiCl-mixed perovskite-based device reached 14.5%.
Various deposition methods of the perovskite films have been employed to change the crystallisation kinetics of perovskite and film morphology, which can eventually influence the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. Etgar et al. provided an in-depth study on two-step deposition in HTL-free PSCs. They examined the effects of different parameters (spin velocity, annealing temperature, dipping time, and MAI concentration) on the device performance and found that the Jsc is mainly affected by the spin velocity while the fill factor (FF) is in correlation with the dipping time and MAI concentration. After optimisation, the best device displayed a PCE of 9.4%. Kanatzidis and co-workers deposited pin-hole free perovskite films via a low-temperature gas–solid crystallisation process in their HTL-free devices, in which the PbI2 precursor film was treated with MAI vapour. The gas–solid crystallisation process results in high film coverage and controllable grain sizes by preventing the formation of CH3NH3PbI3·H2O or CH3NH3PbI3·DMF intermediate phases. Consequently, the device reached a maximum PCE of 10.6%.
Solvent engineering is a useful method to control the perovskite film formation. The precursor solvent should be polar to dissolve the precursor, while its properties such as viscosity, boiling point, and coordination ability are also important parameters deciding the crystallisation process and thus the film quality. Han et al. systematically studied the influence of different solvents on the performance of HTL-free PSCs. The wettability of solvents and their coordination ability with PbI2 decide the extent of perovskite infiltration into the mesoporous scaffold and the crystallisation kinetics of perovskite. After optimisation, the DMF/DMSO mixed solvent-based device showed a highly promising PCE of 13.89%. Yang's group prepared high-quality perovskite films with a modified two-step sequential method, where they replaced isopropanol (IPA) with IPA/cyclohexane (CYHEX) as the solvent for MAI in the second step. By changing the solvent and optimising the reaction time in MAI solution, they successfully obtained a smooth perovskite surface, which resulted in a much better contact at the perovskite/carbon interface. Consequently, the PCE reached 14.38%, which is the highest reported so far for regular structured HTL-free PSCs. Moreover, a PCE of 9.72% was achieved for the large-area device (1 cm2).
Solvent treatment has proven to be an effective way to change the crystallisation kinetics of perovskite. Diau et al. achieved the retarded crystallisation of MAPbI3via a solvent extraction method in the device FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/mp-Al2O3/carbon/(MAPbI3) and obtained a maximum PCE of 13.3%. The N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution of the perovskite precursor was infiltrated in the triple-layered scaffold and then immersed in ethyl ether for 30 min followed by a room-temperature annealing for over 100 h, leading to a homogeneous nucleation and the formation of dense perovskite nanocrystals. As a result, the morphology of the perovskite film deposited by the solvent-extraction crystal growth (SECG) method was superior to that of the thermally annealed ones (Fig. 7). Etgar et al. demonstrated the impact of anti-solvent treatment on HTL-free PSCs and achieved a PCE of 11.2%. They found that toluene treatment of the perovskite surface does not only improve the film morphology and coverage but also made the perovskite more intrinsic, leading to better device performance. Also, the toluene treatment creates a net positive charge on the Pb atoms by removing halide and MA+ ions on the surface, which improved the conductivity of the perovskite surface. Zhao et al. fabricated HTL-free PSCs with a two-step sequential deposition method where the PbI2 films were immediately treated by solvents to induce fast crystallisation. The solvent treatment resulted in nano-sized PbI2 particles with a large number of voids which facilitated the complete reaction with MAI. The device based on ethanol-treated PbI2 showed a maximum PCE of 11.22%. Wang et al. achieved better MAPbI3/carbon contact with a DMF vapour treatment of the PbI2 precursor film, which resulted in a more homogeneous diffusion of PbI2 in the TiO2/Al2O3/carbon triple layer and hence the complete conversion to MAPbI3, eliminating unreacted PbI2 at the MAPbI3/carbon interface that obstructs the hole extraction. As a result, their device reached a maximum PCE of 12.30%.

In regular-structured HTL-free PSCs, the TiO2 layer, which is the most often adopted ETL in PSCs, plays a key role in forming the TiO2/perovskite heterojunction where the photogenerated excitons dissociate into holes and electrons. The mp-TiO2 layer acts as a scaffold to hold the perovskite absorber and offers a large surface area for fast electron extraction. The c-TiO2 layer does not only transport electrons but also avoids the direct contact between the perovskite layer and the FTO surface, inhibiting electron–hole recombination. Different parameters of the TiO2 layer, such as thickness, pore size, and morphology, may influence the device performance profoundly.

The thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer has been reported to determine the performance of HTL-free PSCs. As was suggested by Etgar et al., the thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer decides the depletion layer width, which further determines the PCE of HTL-free PSCs. A thick mp-TiO2 layer with a large surface area ensures the contact with the perovskite layer. However, a too thick mp-TiO2 layer can lead to severe recombination. Different deposition methods have been employed to study the influence of the mp-TiO2 layer on the device performance. Sun et al. prepared the mp-TiO2 layer via high-temperature sintering and achieved a maximum PCE of 8.31% with an optimised mp-TiO2 thickness of 630 nm. Zhao et al. deposited the mp-TiO2 layer by spin-coating a paste of commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. With an optimised thickness of 456 nm for the mp-TiO2 layer, a PCE as high as 12.48% was achieved.
The porosity of mp-TiO2 influences the infiltration of the precursor solution and the contact between perovskite and TiO2 and thereby determines the efficiency of electron extraction. Han et al. enhanced the PCE of the device FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/mp-ZrO2/carbon/((5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3) to 13.41% by using TiO2 nanoparticles with an optimised diameter of 25 nm as the mesoporous scaffold, which resulted in a large pore size for better precursor infiltration. Yang and colleagues synthesised TiO2 nanobowl arrays as the mesoporous layer with a polystyrene template method. They found that the TiO2 nanobowl arrays with an optimised pore size and thickness can reduce recombination with increased interface area between perovskite and TiO2, and enhance the light absorption. With an average pore size of 220 nm they achieved the highest PCE of 12.02%.
There are also studies focusing on adopting different nanostructures of mp-TiO2. It was shown earlier that the higher ionic charge of the exposed (001) facets of anatase TiO2 nanosheets could strengthen the attachment of the light absorbers to the TiO2 surface and assist in electron injection. The first HTL-free PSC, where anatase (001) TiO2 nanosheets were employed as the ETL, displayed a PCE as high as 5.5%. Han et al. also utilised (001) TiO2 nanosheets in their mesoscopic HTL-free PSCs and achieved a PCE of 10.64% along with a Jsc of 20.1 mA cm−2 that was 47% higher than that of the TiO2 nanoparticle-based device, suggesting the effectiveness of electron extraction at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface. Zhao's group employed a composite nanostructured ETL by combining size blended TiO2 nanoparticles (SBNPs) and TiO2 nanoarrays (NAs) in HTL-free PSCs (Fig. 8), where the NAs act as electron transfer channels while the highly porous SBNPs ensure the infiltration of MAPbI3. The composite ETL showed improved charge transport and reduced recombination compared to traditional nanoparticles. Consequently, the SBNP + NA-based PSC reached a high PCE of 13.5%, which was superior to that of the SBNP- or NA-based devices. The SBNP + NA-based PSC also displayed enhanced stability, maintaining ∼100% original PCE for 30 days in ambient air.
The impact of the c-TiO2 layer thickness on HTL-free PSCs was investigated by Wan and co-workers. They used atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit the c-TiO2 layer, which is a low-temperature process that obviates the need for a sintering step. They found that thicker c-TiO2 films resulted in larger recombination resistance. However, devices with a too thick c-TiO2 layer showed a large charge transfer resistance. By optimising the c-TiO2 thickness, they achieved a maximum PCE of 7.82%. Nevertheless, Han et al. showed that a c-TiO2 layer might not be obligatory in HTL-free PSCs. Their c-TiO2-free devices FTO/mp-TiO2/mp-ZrO2/carbon/((5-AVA)1−x(MA)xPbI3) showed comparable performance to the c-TiO2-based devices, reaching a PCE as high as 13.10%. They proposed that, due to the significantly different wettability of the perovskite precursor on FTO and mp-TiO2, air cavities form between the perovskite layer and the FTO substrate, leading to poor contact and thus reducing the recombination at the FTO/perovskite interface. The c-TiO2-free devices also displayed negligible hysteresis due to the elimination of the compact layer.
Despite the optimisation of the TiO2 layer itself, attempts in the surface modification of TiO2 have also been made to improve device performance. Han and co-workers introduced a silane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the TiO2 surface in their mesoscopic HTL-free PSCs and obtained a high PCE of 12.7%. The hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions between the amino groups in the silane SAM and the perovskite layer lead to the better affinity between the SAM-modified TiO2 and the perovskite absorber and thus better infiltration of the perovskite precursor. As a result, the silane-SAM-based device showed stronger light absorption and suppressed recombination process.
ZnO is known to have a higher electron mobility than that of TiO2, and can be deposited under mild conditions. As an effective alternative for TiO2, it is compatible with the low-temperature fabrication of HTL-free devices. Ma and colleagues fabricated the low-temperature processed device FTO/ZnO/MAPbI3/carbon (as shown in Fig. 9) and achieved PCEs up to 8% on FTO/glass substrates and over 4% on flexible polymer substrates. Jin and Chumanov demonstrated a similar device and obtained a PCE of 10.2%, Voc of 0.960 V and Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2. These devices show the potential for the fabrication of less energy-consuming HTL-free PSCs.

The most often used noble metal electrodes in PSCs, such as Au or Ag, are prepared by high-vacuum thermal deposition that is complicated and energy-consuming, calling for substitutes to lower the manufacturing cost and realise large-scale production. Carbon-based counter electrodes (CEs) have emerged as an excellent alternative for the electrode in HTL-free PSCs, due to their low cost, flexibility, simple preparation and deposition, and their HOMO levels (∼5.0 eV) that match considerably well with the valence band of MAPbI3. It has been reported that carbon-based PSCs displayed similar or even better performance compared with Au-based PSCs. Moreover, carbon-based devices have exhibited excellent long-term stability in ambient air. Until now, there are mainly two types of carbon-based CEs: carbon nanotube (CNT)-based CEs and graphite-based composite CEs.

CNT-based CEs have proven to act not only as an electrode but also a hole collector. Li and co-workers fabricated HTL-free PSCs by laminating films of a CNT network onto the MAPbI3 film as the electrode and obtained a maximum PCE of 6.87%. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed that the CNTs, as a p-type conducting material, can effectively collect and transfer holes (Fig. 10a). Moreover, the CNT-based PSC showed better performance than the Au-based device (Fig. 10b). Lin et al. used a cross-stacked superaligned CNT (CSCNT) sheet as the CE in HTL-free PSCs. The 3D hole extraction and collection of CSCNTs resulted in a PCE of 8.65%. By doping the CSCNTs with iodine to improve their conductivity, the PCE was enhanced to 10.54%. Yang's group fabricated a hysteresis-free PSC using multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) as the CE and achieved a PCE of 12.67% with an impressive FF of 0.80. In another study, they used the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-modified CNTs as the CE for HTL-free PSCs, where the P3HT modifier acts as an electron blocker and a cross-linker of the CNTs. Their optimised device showed a PCE up to 13.43%.
Another type of carbon-based CEs is based on graphite, and carbon black is often added to form a composite CE. The fully printable HTL-free PSCs developed by Han's group adopt a mesoporous graphite/carbon black composite as the CE. They demonstrated that devices with carbon black/spheroidal graphite CEs performed better than those with carbon black/flaky graphite CEs due to their better conductivity and favourable morphology for pore-filling. By using a highly ordered mesoporous carbon framework as the CE, they improved the PCE up to 7.02%. The same group adopted an 8 μm graphite-based carbon CE, which has a larger pore size for pore-filling and a smaller square resistance, enhancing the PCE of the carbon-based PSC to 11.65%. Graphite-based CEs were also employed in insulating layer-free devices. Meng and co-workers fabricated a carbon CE consisting of a mesoscopic carbon layer and a graphite conducting electrode layer. They found that reducing the graphite flake size in the mesoscopic carbon layer and adding carbon black can lead to better contact with the perovskite layer (Fig. 11) and reduced the charge transfer resistance. A PCE of 10.2% was achieved for their HTL-free devices.
Apart from the CEs as mentioned above, other CEs based on other carbon materials have also been reported. Yang et al. fabricated HTL-free PSCs with graphene-based CEs. They demonstrated that multi-layered graphene (MG) can extract holes more efficiently than single-layered graphene (SG), due to the Schottky barrier formed at the perovskite/MG interface that facilitates hole extraction and electron rejection. Consequently, a PCE of 11.5% was achieved for the MG-based device.
The high-temperature preparation of CNTs and the sintering process of carbon CEs in the TiO2/ZrO2/carbon tri-layer are energy-consuming, which may limit their use in the large-scale manufacturing of PSCs. Therefore, low-temperature processed carbon electrodes are required for simpler fabrication procedures. Many reports have highlighted the feasibility of low-temperature processed carbon CEs, which were usually deposited by a simple doctor-blading technique or spin-coating. Sun et al. fabricated carbon CEs with commercial carbon paste by the doctor-blading technique followed by heat-treatment at 100 °C, achieving a PCE of 8.31%. Ma et al. removed the solvent in commercial carbon paste that may destroy the perovskite layer and redispersed the dried carbon sample in chlorobenzene. The PSC using the carbon CE deposited from the remoulded carbon paste exhibited a maximum PCE of 9.08%. Meng et al. employed free-standing thermoplastic carbon film as the CE in HTL-free PSCs. The carbon CE was prepared by a doctor-blading technique and then peeled and hot-pressed directly onto the perovskite film at a temperature of 85 °C (Fig. 12). By adjusting the proportion of graphite flakes and carbon black particles in the carbon films and optimising hot-pressing pressure, they achieved a PCE up to 13.53% with high reproducibility.

In regular-structured HTL-free devices, the energy level difference between perovskite (valence band −5.4 eV) and the work function of Au (5.1 eV)/carbon (5.0 eV) is relatively large (0.3–0.4 eV), making the hole extraction relatively unfavourable as compared to HTL-based PSCs. Poor contact between the perovskite layer and the electrode may also be detrimental to the long-term stability of the device. Therefore, interface modification is another crucial method to improve the performance of HTL-free PSCs.

As was demonstrated by Meng's group, a Schottky junction with a metal–semiconductor (M–S) interface is formed between MAPbI3 and Au. For an unmodified M–S interface, interfacial defects can cause severe recombination, and electrons may even transfer to the metal electrode in the meantime. To modify the M–S interface, the same group inserted a thin layer of the wide bandgap organic semiconductor N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenyl-benzidine (TPB) between the MAPbI3 layer and the Au electrode. The modification increased the interfacial resistance of the MAPbI3/Au interface and passivated the recombination process, resulting in an improved PCE up to 6.71%. In another study, they constructed a metal–insulator–semiconductor back contact for HTL-free PSCs by depositing an ultrathin insulating AlOx layer onto the MAPbI3 film via atomic layer deposition. The electron blocking effect of the AlOx layer enhanced the efficiency of charge collection, leading to a maximum PCE of 11.10%.
For carbon-based HTL-free PSCs, the engineering of the perovskite/carbon CE contact is a useful approach to the long-term stability and endurance of HTL-free PSCs. Zhao et al. employed a bi-layer back contact consisting of a carbon/MAI composite layer and an exterior compact hydrophobic carbon layer in their HTL-free device. The carbon/MAI layer suppresses the decomposition of MAPbI3 and facilitates the regrowth of MAPbI3 during heating, while the hydrophobic carbon layer keeps out the moisture. Impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that the charge transfer resistance at the perovskite/carbon + MAI interface was lower than that at the perovskite/carbon interface. As a result, the best-performing cell showed a final PCE of 13.6% from an initial PCE of 11.3% after thermal stress in the ambient air. Upon encapsulation, these cells displayed excellent stability after water exposure or under thermal stress.

For PSCs with the inverted structure, PEDOT:PSS is the most often adopted hole conductor, which is suitable for low-temperature fabrication of devices. Nevertheless, the hydrophilic and acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS can deteriorate the device stability. Inexpensive inorganic hole conductors, such as NiOx, CuSCN, and Cu2O, have also been widely investigated, but their preparation may increase the fabrication cost and complexity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop inverted-structured HTL-free PSCs. Until now, there are only a handful of reports on HTL-free PSCs with the inverted structure (Table 3), but they have in general shown higher PCEs than the regular-structured ones.

In inverted-structured HTL-free PSCs, the energy alignment between ITO (work function 4.7–4.8 eV) and perovskite (valence band −5.4 eV) is considerably unsatisfactory, which may cause potential loss and inefficient hole extraction. Besides, the direct deposition of the perovskite layer on the ITO surface causes an increasing level of difficulty in controlling the film morphology. Until now, there have been several reports focused on these problems. Jen et al. firstly demonstrated an inverted HTL-free PSC with the structure ITO/MAPbI3/PCBM/bis-C60 (C60-bisadduct)/Ag, achieving a PCE up to 11.02% and a high Voc of 1.01 V. The efficient hole extraction of ITO from the MAPbI3 layer seemed to contradict the assumed potential loss. As was shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, the formation of hydrogen bonding between the MA+ cation of MAPbI3 and the unprotonated oxygen at the ITO surface leads to a slight increase in the work function of ITO (0.3 eV), contributing to the high Voc. Our group found that UV-ozone treatment could change the work function of ITO from 4.8 eV to 5.2 eV, which provided better energy alignment with the perovskite layer and thus resulted in a higher Voc. Moreover, the removal of organic species on the ITO surface contributed to a higher Jsc and a lower series resistance. The HTL-free PSCs based on UVO-treated ITO displayed a highly reproducible PCE up to 16.0%, which was due to the better hole extraction property of the UVO-treated ITO compared with NiOx (Fig. 13a) and the smaller interface resistance of the HTL-free PSCs as compared to the NiOx-based devices (Fig. 13b).
It was proven by Yang et al. that the elimination of HTL does improve the long-term device stability as compared to PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs. They fabricated the device ITO/MAPbI3/PCBM/Al where pinhole-free perovskite films were obtained on the ITO surface under ambient conditions, achieving a PCE of 12.78%. The device exhibited good stability by maintaining a PCE of 9.91% after a 15 day storage, which is superior to that of the PEDOT:PSS-based device.
Chen and co-workers fabricated for the first time an HTL-free PSC on flexible PET substrates and obtained a maximum PCE of 9.7% (and 12.5% on glass substrates). Moreover, the fabricating time was reduced to only ∼3 h for their devices, showing the potential for their commercialisation. It is worth noting that the top electrode has been deposited via evaporation in inverted-structured HTL-free PSCs until now. The employment of non-evaporated top electrodes, such as silver nanowires or commercial silver inks that has been successfully used in PSCs may make these PSCs fully compatible with roll-to-roll fabrication.
The co-deposition of hole conductor and the perovskite layer is another practical approach to highly efficient HTL-free devices, which simplifies the fabrication process while retaining the functions of the hole conductor. In our group, the inexpensive inorganic hole conductor copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) was co-deposited with perovskite by spin-coating the hybrid precursor solution to fabricate the HTL-free device ITO/MAPbI3−xClx (CuSCN)/C60/BCP/Ag. In the device, CuSCN was distributed both inside the perovskite layer and at the ITO/perovskite interface. Since the valence band of CuSCN (−5.3 eV) was very close to that of the MAPbI3−xClx (−5.3 eV), such a distribution of CuSCN could passivate the trap states at the surfaces and interfaces of the perovskite crystals, resulting in significantly accelerated hole transfer from the perovskite layer to ITO (Fig. 14a and c) with only slightly reduced electron mobility (Fig. 14d), as well as inhibited recombination (Fig. 14b). Consequently, the device reached a maximum PCE of 18.1%, which is to the best of our knowledge the highest PCE reported for HTL-free PSCs so far.

For regular-structured PSCs, the most widely used material for the ETL is TiO2, which needs a high-temperature sintering process and therefore consumes extra energy and limits the scalability of PSCs. Many attempts were made to find low-temperature processed electron-selective materials, and highly efficient PSCs based on alternative electron transport materials such as ZnO, SnO2, and fullerene derivatives, have been reported. However, their deposition still requires an additional step. The elimination of the ETL may further simplify the device fabrication and bring down the cost. Until now, there have been some reports on ETL-free devices (Table 4).

Since 2014, several reports have shown that the performance of ETL-free PSCs may be comparable to ETL-based ones. Liu and colleagues reported a ZnO-free PSC with the highest PCE of 13.5%. Compared to their former ZnO-based cells, the contact resistance of the ETL-free devices increased, but the effect was offset by an increase in the recombination resistance. The lack of the ETL did not result in extensive charge carrier recombination at the CH3NH3PbI3/ITO interface, and a high Voc (∼1 V) was obtained. Meanwhile, the ZnO-free devices also exhibited improved stability under ambient conditions. Yan et al. obtained a maximum PCE of 14.14% with a high Voc of 1.06 V in MAPbI3−xClx-based ETL-free PSCs (Fig. 15). They suggested that Cl-doping may facilitate the passivation of the MAPbI3−xClx/FTO interface. In comparison, the TiO2-based device surprisingly showed no improvement in the Voc.
The direct deposition of the perovskite layer on the TCO may result in poor film morphology and coverage, which may cause severe recombination and shunting. It was demonstrated that in ETL-free devices the incomplete coverage of the perovskite film results in direct contact between FTO and spiro-OMeTAD and forms the FTO/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure that acts as a short circuit pathway and thus severely deteriorates the device performance. Similar to the case of inverted-structured HTL-free PSCs, the UV-ozone treatment of the FTO surface can improve the perovskite coverage by removing residual organic species adsorbed on the FTO substrates. Zhang and co-workers found that the MAPbI3−xClx film deposited on UVO-treated FTO showed full coverage and smoothness and exhibited 70% PL quenching that is similar to those deposited on TiO2, suggesting an efficient charge transfer between perovskite and FTO. As a consequence, the champion device displayed a PCE of 10.67% and a high Voc of 0.97 V.
The energy alignment between the TCO and the perovskite layer is also a major problem which may influence the effective charge selection/transport at the TCO/perovskite interface. Therefore, the modification of the TCO surface is of great importance. Zhu et al. modified the ITO surface with caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) solution in the device ITO:Cs2CO3/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 16). The modification tunes the work function of the ITO surface and leads to a better band alignment between ITO and perovskite. Meanwhile, Cs2CO3, as an n-type dopant, endows the ITO surface with electron-selective and hole-blocking properties. As a result, a remarkable PCE of 15.1% was achieved.
The deposition method of the perovskite layer in ETL-free devices was also investigated. Miyasaka et al. employed a two-step sequential deposition method to prepare the MAPbI3 film in ETL-free devices. Solvent vapour annealing (SVA) was used to prepare PbI2 films with large grain sizes, which was then dipped in MAI solution for conversion to MAPbI3. The photovoltaic performance was improved by a repeatable dipping-drying method, and a PCE up to 11.4% was achieved. Zhang et al. applied a multistep annealing method to obtain high coverage MAPbI3−xClx films with high crystallinity and achieved a PCE of 11.07%.
The co-deposition of perovskite and electron conductors has been employed as a fabrication method of ETL-free devices as well. Tena-Zaera and colleagues deposited an MAPbI3:C70 fullerene blend layer in ETL-free devices. The introduction of C70 significantly eliminated pinholes in the film and suppressed charge carrier recombination. As a result, the MAPbI3:C70-based PSCs exhibited larger recombination resistance than the MAPbI3-based ones, showing a maximum PCE of 13.6%. Also, the MAPbI3:C70-based PSCs displayed enhanced photostability without encapsulation. Jen et al. fabricated an inverted-structured PSC based on a MAPbI3:fluoroalkyl-substituted fullerene (DF-C60) hybrid layer. They suggested that the preferential distribution of DF-C60 near the surface of the perovskite layer may function similar to an ETL layer at the interface. In the absence of a PCBM layer as the ETL, the MAPbI3:DF-C60-based device reached an impressive PCE of 15.14% and exhibited reduced hysteresis compared to the pristine perovskite-based one. This is the first inverted structured ETL-free PSC to the best of our knowledge, and we believe that further optimization may generate even better performance of this type of PSC.
Since the FTO electrode makes up a large portion of the material cost of PSCs, recycling them can reduce the fabrication cost. Zhang and co-workers fabricated ETL-free PSCs on recycled FTO substrates and achieved PCEs around 10%, which is close to that of the cells based on pristine FTO. As an environmentally friendly technique, the recycling of FTO or ITO may also be implemented in the fabrication of HTL-free PSCs.
The elimination of the TiO2 ETL layer also allows the fabrication of PSCs on flexible substrates. Yang et al. reported a flexible ETL-free PSC with the structure of ITO/Cl-doped FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. They concluded that the large charge storage in the perovskite film, rather than the built-in potential, is essential for the charge transfer across the ITO/perovskite interface. The device reached the highest PCE of 12.70% with a stable output PCE of 6.8% at 0.7 V, indicating that this ETL-free device holds huge potential towards roll-to-roll fabrication.
Although ETL-free PSCs have been reported in the literature, it has been proposed by Snaith et al. that the ETL maybe essential for the stabilised power output of PSCs with the regular structure. They demonstrated that although the c-TiO2-free, mp-TiO2-free PSC showed a PCE of 11.5% from a reverse scan, severe hysteresis was observed as the forward scan only gave a PCE of 6.4% with a significant loss in Voc and FF. Moreover, the device's stabilised power output was approximately zero, which may be due to the lack of a permanent built-in field as the ETL was omitted. Their discovery questions the power sustainability of ETL-free PSCs and highlights the necessity to report the stabilised power output under load when characterising PSCs.

In this review article, we summarised the recent progress in the simplification of the device structures of PSCs. The capability of organo-metal halide perovskites to transfer both holes and electrons makes it possible to fabricate HTL-/ETL-free devices. The elimination of the HTL or ETL simplifies the fabrication process of devices and reduces the material cost and energy consumption, and may pave the way to the large-scale manufacturing of PSCs. However, the lack of HTL or ETL may also result in poor interfacial contact and inadequate perovskite morphology, leading to inferior device performance. Researchers have made extensive efforts to solve these problems and improve the PCE of HTL-/ETL-free devices.

In HTL-free PSCs, the exclusion of commonly used organic hole transporting materials brings down the material cost and alleviates device instability. For regular-structured HTL-free PSCs, a lot of research efforts have been devoted in modifying the perovskite layer with optimal composition and morphology, optimising the TiO2 layer, utilising carbon-based CEs, engineering the perovskite/anode interface and so on. As for the inverted-structured HTL-free PSCs, a few studies have been dedicated to improving the hole extraction from the perovskite layer to the ITO surface; hence the devices have shown promising PCEs that are higher than those of the regular-structured ones.
There have also been several reports on ETL-free PSCs. In these devices, the elimination of the traditional TiO2 ETL in regular-structured PSCs is critical for their low-temperature fabrication, yet whether the ETL is dispensable for acceptable stabilised power output of PSCs is still in debate. On the other hand, more progress can be made in ETL-free PSCs with the inverted structure.
In summary, the simplification of device structures is an important approach to the low-cost, utility-scale fabrication of PSCs. With advancement in the deposition techniques of perovskites, the employment of cheaper functional layers and the engineering of interfaces, the commercialisation of HTL-/ETL-free PSCs may eventually come into reality.
