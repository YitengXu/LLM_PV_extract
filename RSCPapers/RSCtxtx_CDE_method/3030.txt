Here, four D–π–A porphyrin dye molecules with carboxylic acid at the para-position or meta-position of the benzene ring (coded as WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7, respectively) were designed and synthesized for monolithic dye-sensitized solar cells with mesoscopic carbon counter electrodes. Significant optical and electrochemical differences were found for WH-C6 and WH-C7 with carboxylic acid at the meta-position of the benzene ring in comparison with WH-C4 and WH-C1 with carboxylic acid at the para-position of the benzene ring. The influence of anchoring group positions on the photovoltaic performance of corresponding devices was systematically investigated. The devices sensitized by WH-C6 and WH-C7 show inferior open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) compared with those sensitized by WH-C4 and WH-C1. The above performance differences were confirmed and explained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), UV-visible absorption spectra and dye loading measurement, respectively.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the promising photovoltaic devices which can convert sunlight efficiently to electricity, attracting extensive attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), ease of fabrication and potential low cost compared with traditional silicon-based solar cells. DSSCs are mainly composed of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline oxide, electrolytes and counter electrodes (CEs), among which dyes, as one of the important components, play a key role in determining the photovoltaic performance of the devices. In the past two decades, although optimized Ru polypyridyl sensitizers have achieved PCEs of over 11% due to their broad absorption spectrum through metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), the longer exciton lifetime, and their long-term chemical stability, several drawbacks, such as the high cost of noble metal ruthenium, the requirement for careful synthesis, tricky purification steps and low molar extinction coefficients, are obstacles to their large-scale application. Under such circumstances, it seems to be an effective solution to these problems to seek alternative sensitizers.

Among the dyes under investigation, porphyrins as alternative sensitizers to polypyridyl ruthenium DSSCs have aroused widespread interest due to their low cost, high molar extinction coefficients and structural diversity. Motivated by the above advantages, considerable efforts have been devoted to develop new and efficient porphyrin sensitizers. Before 2009, most porphyrin sensitizers were designed through the connection of anchoring groups to the meso or β-position of the porphyrin ring without additional electron-donating donors, leading to low PCEs (generally <7%). Over the recent several years, as for the structures of the most organic dyes, the porphyrin dyes are also designed according to the basic structures of the donor–π-conjugated bridge–acceptor (simplified as D–π–A), which are beneficial to intramolecular electron transportation. Benefitting from the introduction of a D–π–A push–pull structure, great progress has been made in the past few years. Thereto, through the cosensitization of the porphyrin YD2-o-C8 with the excellent organic dye Y123 based on a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte, a record efficiency as high as 12.3% has been achieved by judicious molecular engineering methodology. Subsequently, the DSSCs based on judiciously engineered push–pull porphyrin sensitizer SM315, which was obtained through inserting a benzothiadiazole unit between the porphyrin ring and benzoic acid acceptor, achieved a world record liquid state efficiency of 13% using a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte. Recently, a solar cell cosensitized by the organic dye C1 and the porphyrin XW4 with an extended conjugation framework and a carbazole donor exhibited a high PCE of 10.45% with improved current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) values. Additionally, push–pull Zn-porphyrin WW-6 functionalized via N-annulated perylene as an efficient electron donor displayed a power conversion efficiency as high as 10.5% using a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte, which is comparable to that of the YD2-o-C8 cell (η = 10.5%) under the same conditions. The above experimental results adequately testify to the importance of the push–pull D–π–A Zn-porphyrin design. So, in the present study we designed and synthesized push–pull D–π–A Zn-porphyrin. Although very high PCEs have been achieved, there is still room for PCE improvement through a rational modification and engineering of porphyrin molecule structures. It is well known that the performance of porphyrin sensitized solar cells is limited by their serious aggregation. In order to alleviate the aggregation of D–π–A porphyrin dye molecules, here we explore the possibility of improving the photovoltaic performance of D–π–A porphyrin-sensitized solar cells by increasing the asymmetry induced via different anchoring group positions. Actually, it has been demonstrated previously that the acceptor in the D–π–A structure is of great importance in determining the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs through influencing the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the sensitizers along with the function mode with TiO2. Obviously, the kinds of anchoring groups have significant effects on the binding mode of dyes on TiO2. Actually, over the past two decades, a variety of anchoring groups, such as carboxylic acid groups, sulfonic acid groups, phosphonic acid groups and the pyridine ring, have been applied to various sensitizers for DSSCs. To explore the application of porphyrins as light-harvesting materials with various anchoring groups, Lu et al. reported a dye, LW11, with pyridine ring as the anchoring group for DSSCs. It was found that the dye LD14, with the conventional carboxylic acid as the acceptor, possessed a much better photovoltaic performance than LW11. Nevertheless, to date, the anchoring group most widely and successfully used is still carboxylic acid. So, in this study we chose carboxylic acid as the anchoring group in push–pull D–π–A porphyrin dyes.
In reality, apart from the kinds of anchoring groups, the positions of the anchoring groups in different dyes have an important influence on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. But literature on the influence of anchoring group positions on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs is very limited. Hart et al. synthesized porphyrins 1m-Zn and 1p-Zn with a carboxyl anchoring group incorporated at the meta or para-position of the benzene ring, respectively, which have no additional strong electron-donating donor at the meso or β-position of the porphyrin ring. It was found that 1m-Zn exhibited higher Jsc and Voc than 1p-Zn. In order to improve further the performance of porphyrin sensitized solar cells, it is significantly meaningful to further investigate if a change in the anchoring group position from the para-position to the meta-position of the benzene ring in a D–π–A structural porphyrin with additional different strong electron-donating donors at the meso-position of the porphyrin ring sensitizers can improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Consequently, here we designed and synthesized two new push–pull porphyrin dye molecules with carboxylic acid at the meta-position of the benzene ring, coded as WH-C6 with carbazole as donor, and WH-C7 with 4,4′-dimethyltriphenylamine as the donor, respectively. Simultaneously, we also synthesized WH-C1 and WH-C4 with carboxylic acid at the para-position of the benzene ring for a convenient comparison, which have been reported in our previous papers. Accordingly, the influence of anchoring group positions on the photophysical and electrochemical characteristics of porphyrin sensitizers were systematically investigated. It was found that the anchoring group positions significantly influence the HOMO and LUMO levels and molar absorption ability of porphyrin molecules. To further scrutinize the relationship between porphyrin sensitizers with different anchoring group positions and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs sensitized by the corresponding porphyrin dyes, a fully printable low-cost monolithic cell architecture with mesoscopic carbon counter electrodes was utilized to fabricate the complete DSSC devices. It was found that WH-C4 and WH-C1 with carboxylic acid at the para-position of the benzene ring show a much better photovoltaic performance than WH-C6 and WH-C7 with carboxylic acid at the meta-position of the benzene ring.

All the reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Solvents used for reactions were dried by standard procedures. All the reactions were carried out under a N2 atmosphere. Column chromatography of all the products was performed on silica gel (Kanto, Silica Gel 60N, spherical, 200–300 mesh), and some were further purified by recrystallization. [5,15-Bis(2,6-di-octoxyphenyl)-10,20-bis[(triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl]-porphinato] zinc(II) (1), 3-iodo-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole and N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)-N-(4-iodophenyl) were synthesized as in a previously reported method.


Platinized carbon paste was prepared as described elsewhere. 2 g carbon black powder (particle size: 30 nm) and H2PtCl6 (Sigma) with a predetermined Pt/carbon black weight ratio were added into a 20 mL isopropanol solution (Sigma) under continued stirring for 30 min, and then the paste was sintered for 30 min at 380 °C in a furnace to thermally deposit the Pt nanoparticles on the surface of carbon black, followed by mixing with graphite powders (particle size: 1.3 μm) with a predetermined graphite/carbon black weight ratio. Finally, 1 g of 20 nm ZrO2 nanopowder (Sigma) and 1 g of hydroxypropyl cellulose (Sigma) were added into 30 mL terpineol solution. The platinized carbon material paste was obtained after stirring vigorously using ball milling for 2 h.


UV-visible spectra were performed on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-AV400 spectrometer at 400 MHz. The chemical shifts were recorded in parts per million (ppm) with TMS as the internal reference. ESI mass spectra were measured on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage mass spectrometer. The cyclic voltammetries (CVs) were carried out with a three-electrode system in an argon-purged electrolyte solution on a PARSTAT 2273 Electrochemical Workstation. Cyclic voltammograms for the porphyrin dyes were conducted with a three-electrode cell equipped with a BAS glassy carbon (0.07 cm2) disk as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (saturated) reference electrode. The working electrode was polished with 0.03 μm alumina on felt pads (Buehler) and treated ultrasonically for 1 min before each experiment. The potential of the reference electrode was adjusted by recording the cyclic voltammogram for 0.01 M ferrocene in THF containing 0.1 M TBAPF6. The thickness of all the films was measured with a profilometer (VeecoDektak 150).


A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO-coated glass by spray pyrolysis deposition with di-isopropoxytitanium bis(acetyl acetonate) solution. Subsequently, a 8 μm-thick mesoporous TiO2 (particle size, 20 nm, PASOL HPW-18NR TiO2 nanopowders, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd, Japan) transparent electrode, a 3 μm-thick spacer layer composed of 40 and 90 nm-sized zirconia particles, and a 50 μm-thick mesoscopic platinized graphite/carbon black electrode were prepared by screen printing onto FTO-coated conducting glass layer by layer, which were sintered at 500 °C, 500 °C and 400 °C for 30 min, respectively. Then the working electrode was prepared by immersing the TiO2 film in the 0.2 mM dye solution (in toluene/EtOH = 1/1, v/v) containing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 0.4 mM) at 25 °C overnight. The cell was encapsulated by a 100 μm thick spacer of a thermo-bonding polymer (Surlyn, DuPont) with sheet glass. After sealing, the liquid electrolyte was injected into the cell through the hole predrilled in the sheet glass, and then the hole was sealed with the Surlyn polymer and a cover glass. The liquid electrolyte consisted of 1.0 M 1,2-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15, v/v).


Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) giving light with an AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A black mask with a slightly smaller circular aperture (0.07 cm2) than the active area of the square solar cell (0.25 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 260) as the monochromatic light source. The illumination spot size was chosen to be slightly smaller than the active area of the DSSC test cells. IPCE photocurrents were recorded under short-circuit conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The monochromatic photon flux was quantified by means of a calibrated silicon photodiode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the symmetric cell was measured using a PARSTAT 2273 Electrochemical Workstation in the frequency range 0.1 to 106 Hz with a 10 mV AC amplitude. The complete DSSCs prepared under the same conditions were used to measure I–V, IPCE and EIS.


Compound WH-C6 was prepared according to the literature procedure. To a solution of porphyrin 1 (98 mg, 0.07 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) was added TBAF (1 M in THF, 0.57 mL, 0.57 mmol). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h. The mixture was concentrated and then extracted with CH2Cl2–H2O. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue, 3-iodo-9-ethyl-9H-carbazole (25 mg, 0.077 mmol, 1.1 eq.), and 3-iodobenzoic acid (17 mg, 0.07 mmol, 1.0 eq.) were dissolved in a mixture of THF (20 mL) and Et3N (4 mL) and degassed with N2 for 10 min, and then Pd2(dba)3 (33 mg, 0.036 mmol) and AsPh3 (88 mg, 0.29 mmol) were added to the mixture. The solution was refluxed for 5 h under N2 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel) using CH2Cl2/CH3OH = 20/1 as the eluent. Recrystallization from CH2Cl2–EtOH gave a green solid (34.3 mg, 35%). 1H NMR (CDCl3–pyridine-d5, 600 MHz) δH 9.71 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 9.63 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 8.86 (t, J = 4.0 Hz, 4H), 8.75 (s, 1H), 8.71 (s, 1H), 8.51 (s, 1H), 8.24 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 8.21 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 8.12 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 8.08 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.72 (t, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.60 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.53 (t, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.46 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 7.04 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 4H), 4.43 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H), 3.88 (t, J = 5.9 Hz, 8H), 1.48 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H), 1.23–1.10 (m, 8H), 0.99–0.85 (m, 8H), 0.79–0.70 (m, 8H), 0.66–0.55(m, 28H), 0.51–0.43 (m, 8H). 13C NMR (CDCl3–pyridine-d5, 600 MHz) δC 168.9, 160.0, 151.6, 151.3, 150.5, 150.4, 140.4, 139.5, 134.9, 132.6, 132.4, 131.7, 131.4, 130.4, 130.2, 129.6, 129.3, 129.0, 128.5, 126.1, 125.0, 123.7, 123.4, 122.7, 121.4, 120.7, 119.3, 114.8, 108.7, 105.1, 101.0, 98.6, 96.8, 94.7, 94.2, 91.9, 68.5, 67.9, 67.0, 45.8, 37.7, 31.4, 28.8, 28.7, 28.6, 25.3, 22.3, 13.9.

Compound WH-C7 was synthesized from N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)-N-(4-iodophenyl) amine (31 mg, 0.077 mmol, 1.1 eq.) and 3-iodobenzoic acid (17 mg, 0.07 mmol, 1.0 eq.) according to the synthetic procedure used for WH-C6, giving a green solid (37.1 mg, 35.9%). 1H NMR (CDCl3–pyridine-d5, 600 MHz) δH 9.62 (d, J = 4.3 Hz, 2H), 9.57 (d, J = 4.3 Hz, 1H), 8.82 (d, J = 4.4 Hz, 2H), 8.80 (d, J = 4.4 Hz, 1H), 8.72 (s, 1H), 8.18 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 8.05 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 7.76 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.72 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 2H), 7.69 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.56 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 7.50 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 1H), 7.13 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H), 7.10 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 4H), 7.02 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 4H), 3.86 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 8H), 2.34 (s, 6H), 1.02–0.94 (m, 8H), 0.94–0.86 (m, 8H), 0.80–0.70 (m, 8H), 0.66–0.53 (m, 28H), 0.50–0.41 (m, 8H). 13C NMR (CDCl3–pyridine-d5, 600 MHz) δC 159.9, 151.6, 151.3, 150.4, 148.0, 144.8, 134.0, 133.1, 132.5, 132.2, 132.1, 131.6, 131.4, 131.3, 130.3, 130.0, 129.6, 129.3, 128.2, 125.1, 121.5, 121.3, 116.8, 114.8, 105.1, 100.5, 99.1, 95.7, 94.7, 94.1, 92.9, 68.5, 31.4, 28.8, 28.7, 28.6, 25.3, 22.3, 20.8, 13.9.

In the present work, two novel porphyrin dyes with a carboxylic acid anchoring group at the meta-position of the benzene ring (carbazole and 4,4′-dimethyltriphenylamine as donors at the meso-position opposite to the anchoring benzoic acid group) were designed and synthesized for monolithic DSSCs based on carbon/graphite counter electrodes, coded as WH-C6 and WH-C7, respectively. The structures of dyes and the synthetic route are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. The detailed synthetic procedures are presented in the experimental section. The molecular structures of target porphyrins were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and ESI-MS, which are also given in the experimental section.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7 in THF solution are depicted in Fig. 2. The corresponding peak positions and molar absorption coefficients (ε) of the Soret and Q bands are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the four sensitizers exhibit typical porphyrin absorption characteristics with a strong Soret band appearing in the range 400–500 nm and mild Q bands appearing in the longer wavelength range of 600–700 nm, which is attributed to π–π* charge transfer transitions of the conjugated molecule and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions of the D–π–A conjugated backbone. According to the absorption data in Table 1, it is obvious that Soret band and Q band peak positions for WH-C6 and WH-C7 are blue-shifted in comparison with WH-C4 and WH-C1, respectively, which may be ascribed to inferior intramolecular charge transfers (ICTs) of WH-C6 and WH-C7 compared with WH-C4 and WH-C1. Apparently, the maximum molar extinction coefficients of the Soret bands of WH-C6 and WH-C7 are lower than those of WH-C4 and WH-C1. Meanwhile, Fig. 3 presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of the sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 films. In comparison with the absorption spectra in solution, the trend of the Soret and Q bands absorption spectra is similar when the sensitizers are adsorbed on TiO2 films. Nevertheless, the Soret and Q absorption bands are broadened and corresponding absorption onsets are red-shifted conspicuously (see Fig. 2 and 3). Therefore, the broadening of Soret and Q absorption bands is ascribed to the interaction between the dyes and TiO2. Besides, the absorption of dyes on the TiO2 electrode is correlated with the aggregation morphology, such as H-type or J-type aggregation. H-aggregates, in which molecules are aligned parallel to each other with a strong intermolecular interaction, tend to induce a nonradiative deactivation process. The formation of H-aggregates is characterized by blue-shifted absorption bands with respect to those of the isolated chromophore. In contrast, J-aggregates, in which the molecules are arranged in a head-to-tail direction, induce a relatively high fluorescence efficiency with a bathochromic shift of the UV absorption maximum. Consequently, the red shift of the absorption onsets is thought to result from the formation of J-aggregates on the TiO2 electrode. Additionally, the fluorescent emission spectra were measured in THF and are shown in Fig. 4. For the fluorescence spectra, major emission bands are observed at 673, 674, 668 and 671 nm for WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7, respectively, which are similar to the trends of the Soret and Q bands absorption spectra. Consequently, it can be concluded that porphyrin dye molecules with carboxylic acid as the anchoring group at the meta-position of the benzene ring possess significantly different optical properties compared with those for a carboxylic acid as the anchoring group at the para-position of the benzene ring.

In order to investigate the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration processes in DSSCs, cyclic voltammetry measurements for the four dyes were performed in water-free THF containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at room temperature and the cyclic voltammograms are presented in Fig. 5. It is observed that the electrochemical data for the four dyes display quasi-reversible couples. The highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of dyes corresponding to the first redox potential were calculated to be 0.861, 0.860, 0.849 and 0.837 V for WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7, respectively. Practically, it was confirmed that a ηinj of unit efficiency requires approximately 0.2 V of over-potential (−ΔG) between the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the dye, and 0.3 V of −ΔG between the dye's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the redox potential for sufficient driving forces of electron injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2 and the regeneration of the oxidized dye. It is observed that the HOMO levels of the four porphyrin dyes are sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE), guaranteeing the efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye through I− present in the electrolyte of the DSSCs. The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) were calculated to be 1.944 V (WH-C4), 2.016 V (WH-C1), 1.985 V (WH-C6) and 1.949 V (WH-C7) by the intersection of the normalized UV-vis absorption spectrum and the steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum. The lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMOs) levels of all the porphyrin sensitizers were determined according to the expression LUMO = HOMO − E0–0 and the corresponding level values are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the LUMO levels of all the dyes are sufficiently more negative compared with the conduction band edge level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which means that electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is thermodynamically feasible. Therefore, these dyes are appropriately used as sensitizers for the DSSCs.


The monochromatic incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs is mainly determined by the light harvesting efficiency (ηLHE), the electron injection yield (ηinj) and the charge collection efficiency (ηcc). Among these, ηLHE and ηinj, being closely related to the dye, greatly contribute to the improvement of IPCE. In the past, it was demonstrated that the molecular structures of sensitizers have a significant influence on ηLHE and ηinj through influencing their photophysical and electrochemical properties. In this work, we synthesized two novel push–pull porphyrin dye molecules with carboxylic acid at the meta-position of the benzene ring, coded as WH-C6 with carbazole as the donor and as WH-C7 with 4,4′-dimethyltriphenylamine as the donor, respectively. For a convenient comparison, we also synthesized WH-C1 and WH-C4 with carboxylic acid at the para-position of the benzene ring. The IPCEs for DSSCs based on the four dyes are presented in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, it is obvious that two peaks are located in the ranges 400–500 nm and 600–700 nm, respectively, which is in agreement with the UV-visible absorption spectra of the dyes. Besides, it was found that WH-C6 and WH-C7 possess lower IPCEs values at the Soret and Q absorption bands than WH-C4 and WH-C1, which is consistent with the trends of the corresponding Soret and Q absorption bands. Compared with WH-C1 and WH-C7 with 4,4′-dimethyltriphenylamine as the donor, WH-C4 and WH-C6 with carbazole as the donor show lower IPCEs values, which is opposite to the trends of the corresponding Soret and Q absorption bands. This phenomenon could be explained by a more serious recombination reaction between the electron injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and I3− in the vicinity of TiO2 for WH-C4 and WH-C6. In fact, we previously reported that WH-C5 with triphenylamine as the donor shows a higher IPCE than WH-C4 with carbazole as the donor because of enhanced electron lifetimes. Now, ηcc competes with ηLHE. In other words, although WH-C4 and WH-C6 have higher ηLHE values than WH-C1 and WH-C7, WH-C1 and WH-C7 show higher IPCE and Jsc values because of their significantly enhanced electron lifetimes compared to those of WH-C4 and WH-C6, which is in good agreement with a previous report.

The current density–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs sensitized by WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7 are displayed in Fig. 7 with the corresponding detailed photovoltaic performance parameters listed in Table 2. Under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, WH-C4- and WH-C1-sensitized cells gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 10.07 and 12.18 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 609.81 and 639.48 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72 and 0.72, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.40% and 5.58%, respectively. Under the same conditions, WH-C6- and WH-C7-sensitized cells exhibited a Jsc of 8.53 and 9.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 599.44 and 604.25 mV, and a FF of 0.73 and 0.73, corresponding to a η of 3.75% and 4.30%, respectively. Compared with WH-C4 and WH-C1, the cells based on WH-C6 and WH-C7 showed inferior Jsc and Voc values. In order to explain this difference, we performed dye loading measurement through adsorbing the dyes onto TiO2 films. The loading amount of WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7 was calculated to be 0.37 × 10−7, 0.35 × 10−7, 0.34 × 10−7 and 0.34 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. Consequently, the lower Jsc values of WH-C6 and WH-C7 could be attributed to the lower dye loading amounts. Furthermore, the carboxyl anchoring group of WH-C6 and WH-C7 located at the meta-position of the benzene ring could be detrimental to intramolecular charge transfer and eventually influence electron injection efficiency, which results in a low IPCE and short circuit current. As we all know, there are two kinds of recombination reaction in DSSCs. First, the oxidized dye can recombine with the electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Second, I3− in the electrolyte can also recombine with the electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Hart et al. reported that the porphyrin 1m-Zn with a carboxyl anchoring group incorporated at the meta-position of the benzene ring showed higher Jsc and Voc values in comparison with 1p-Zn with a carboxyl anchoring group incorporated at the para-position of the benzene ring, which can be ascribed to the lower dye absorbing amount of 1p-Zn and the inhibition of the above second recombination reaction. However, here we draw the opposite conclusions for a D–π–A porphyrin. A carboxyl anchoring group introduced at the meta-position of the benzene ring not only reduces the dye loading amount because of steric hindrance but also could accelerate the above two recombination reactions, leading to lower Jsc and Voc values of WH-C6 and WH-C7 relative to those of WH-C4 and WH-C1.

To further investigate and elucidate the photovoltaic results and gain a better insight into the interfacial charge transfer process of the DSSCs with the different dyes, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in the dark under a forward bias of −0.6 V. The Nyquist plots for the devices based on WH-C4, WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7 are shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, the first semicircle is assigned to impedances related to charge transport at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface. In the middle frequency range, the large semicircle is ascribed to the electron recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance at the working electrode/electrolyte. It is obvious that the semicircle resulting from Rrec based on different dyes is in the order WH-C6 < WH-C7 < WH-C4 < WH-C1, indicating that the electron recombination resistance is also in the same order, WH-C6 < WH-C7 < WH-C4 < WH-C1. As shown in Fig. 7, the order of open circuit voltages for WH-C6, WH-C7, WH-C4 and WH-C1 is in agreement with the order of the electron recombination resistance. EIS results suggest that carboxylic acid anchoring group orientation can influence the electron lifetimes via affecting the recombination reactions between the electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and the oxidized dye or I3− in electrolyte.


In summary, we designed and synthesized two novel push–pull porphyrin dye molecules (WH-C6 and WH-C7) with a carboxylic acid anchoring group at the meta-position of the benzene ring for monolithic dye-sensitized solar cells. Simultaneously, we also synthesized previously reported porphyrin dyes (WH-C4 and WH-C1) with a carboxylic acid anchoring group at the para-position of the benzene ring for a convenient comparison. We investigate systematically the effect of the anchoring group position orientation on the photovoltaic performance of monolithic donor–π-conjugated bridge–acceptor (simplified as D–π–A) porphyrin-sensitized solar cells based on mesoscopic carbon counter electrodes. Compared with WH-C4 and WH-C1, WH-C6 and WH-C7-sensitized solar cells show an inferior photovoltaic performance. Herein, it is demonstrated that the introduction of a carboxylic acid anchoring group at the meta-position of the benzene ring in push–pull porphyrin dye molecules (seen in Fig. 1) not only reduces the dye loading amount because of steric hindrance but also could accelerate electron recombination back reaction. The performance difference caused by the anchoring group positions indicates that the structures of dye molecules are related closely to the performance of the device. The investigation offers direction for the rational design of high performance push–pull porphyrin dye molecules. In order to achieve highly efficient porphyrin-sensitized solar cells, an elaborate design of the donor, π-conjugated spacer and acceptor is indispensable.
