By incorporating benzothiadiazole units into the main chain of 1,2,5,6-naphthalenediimide (iso-NDI) and thiophene based copolymers, we report herein a new high performance donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer, P(iso-NDI-TBT), with much improved film crystallinity and charge carrier mobility. The optical, electrochemical, and charge transport properties as well as the photovoltaic performance were investigated. Bottom-gate bottom-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on the thin films of P(iso-NDI-TBT) show a high hole mobility of up to 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a record value for the 1,2,5,6-NDI based polymers. In addition, the photovoltaic performance of P(iso-NDI-TBT) was also studied, affording a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.5% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.9 V. Our work provides important clues for designing high performance D–A polymeric semiconductors and also demonstrates that 1,2,5,6-NDIs are promising building blocks for constructing new polymer semiconductors.

In recent years, conjugated polymeric semiconductors have been receiving increasing attention in the field of organic electronics such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). The excellent film-forming ability, solution processability, and mechanical properties of polymers make them highly advantageous in utilizing high throughput techniques such as roll-to-roll processing, inkjet printing, and spray-coating to fabricate the low-cost, large-area, and flexible electronic devices. Great progress has been made for p-type, n-type, and ambipolar polymers with excellent charge mobilities and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while the exploration of new conjugated polymers is still very important for either achieving the higher device performance of OFETs and PSCs or further understanding the structure–performance relationships of polymer semiconductors.

The construction of alternating donor (D)–acceptor (A) polymers is the most popular strategy to obtain new high performance semiconducting polymers. By selecting different donor and acceptor units, the energy level, band gap, as well as the charge transport characteristic of the D–A polymers could be finely tuned, leading to their versatile use in organic electronics. However, in comparison with donor moieties, the choices of acceptors for constructing D–A polymers are still limited. Rylene diimides are strong and planar acceptors that have been frequently used for constructing molecular semiconductors and D–A polymeric semiconductors. Zhan, Watson and Facchetti have reported earlier on perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) based copolymers. Particularly, the copolymer incorporating naphthalene diimides (1,4,5,8-NDIs) as the accepting unit and bithiophene as the donor unit affords an electron mobility of 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was a milestone for the development of polymer semiconductors especially the n-type ones. In addition, as isomers of the 1,4,5,8-NDIs, novel angular-shaped 1,2,5,6-NDIs (iso-NDIs) had also been developed as new acceptor units and applied in constructing molecular semiconductors and D–A polymeric semiconductors, which showed different physical properties and charge transport characteristics from that of 1,4,5,8-NDIs. For instance, a series of iso-NDIs based D–A polymers that displayed hole-dominated charge transport have been developed by Gao and coworkers recently. In spite of their amorphous film morphology, one of the iso-NDI based polymers, iso-P(NDI2OD-T2), showed a high mobility of up to 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is among the highest mobilities for the disordered polymeric materials. However, the amorphous-like film characteristic of the iso-NDI based polymers limited the further improvement of the device performance, since a crystallized thin film is more favored in affording a higher charge mobility. Therefore, further modification of the polymeric backbone to improve the film crystallinity and morphology is of great significance for affording high performance semiconducting polymers and understanding the relationship between the molecular structure and the film crystallinity.
Thiophene–benzothiadiazole–thiophene (TBT) has a large and planar π-conjugated molecular structure and shows great potential in constructing polymer semiconductors with high device performance. Herein, a new copolymer, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) was designed and synthesized by incorporating iso-NDI as the acceptor unit and TBT as the donor moiety. In comparison with the previously reported polymers based on iso-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Fig. 1), the backbone of the polymer P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) contains two electron-deficient moieties (iso-NDI and benzothiadiazole) and exhibits more extended π-conjugation, that, we thought could enhance the interchain donor–acceptor interactions and thus improve the film crystallinity. The investigation of the film microstructure indicated that the films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) showed improved crystallinity and self-assembly characteristics. OFET measurements showed that P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) exhibited a hole mobility of 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of 105 that is a record mobility for 1,2,5,6-NDI based polymers. In addition, the primary photovoltaic performance of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) was also investigated by using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor, which showed a PCE of 1.5% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.9 V.

As depicted in Scheme 1, iso-NDI2DT-2Br was prepared according to the previously reported procedure. P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) was synthesized by Stille cross-coupling of iso-NDI2DT-2Br and 4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. It is worthy of note that the monomer ratio of 1:1 affords an insoluble copolymer, and slight tuning of the D/A monomer ratio gives a soluble polymer (see the Experimental section for details). P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, petroleum ether, CHCl3, and chlorobenzene, and was obtained as a blue solid with green metallic luster. The molecular weight of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C using polystyrene standards as calibrants and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent. P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) shows a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 20.1 kDa with a polydispersity index of 2.9 (Fig. S1). P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) is well soluble in hot chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, while at room temperature, it tends to aggregate and gel in solution, indicating the strong interchain interactions and self-assembly characteristics. In addition, the thermal properties of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. S2, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) exhibits excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss upon heating at 460 °C. And from a scanning range of rt to 400 °C, no phase transition was observed (Fig. S3), indicating the stable film morphology over a wide temperature range.


The frontier molecular orbital energies could provide a qualitative indication of the hole/electron injection ability and also determine the redox stability of the semiconductors. Thus we carried out the molecular simulation of the trimers of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G* level with the Gaussian 09 package.Fig. 2 shows the frontier orbitals of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT), where the largest coefficients in the HOMO orbital are delocalized along the central iso-NDI and thiophene substituted benzothiadiazole units while the electron density distribution of the LUMO orbital is just located on one iso-NDI unit, indicating the more favored hole transport than electron transport. The HOMO and LUMO energies estimated by DFT calculation are −5.20 eV and −3.17 eV, respectively, and the limited LUMO electron density distribution probably contributes to the high LUMO energy.


Electrochemical behaviors of the thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 3a, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) shows reversible reduction waves and irreversible oxidation waves with the onset oxidation potential and reduction potential of 0.9 V and −1.1 V, respectively. HOMO and LUMO energies of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) were estimated from the equation: HOMO = −(Eonsetox − E1/2(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8) eV, LUMO = −(Eonsetred − E1/2(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8) eV, affording the HOMO and LUMO energies of −5.58 eV and −3.58 eV, respectively. In comparison with the previously reported P(iso-NDI2OD-T2) (HOMO: −5.78 eV, LUMO: −3.72 eV), both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P(ANDI2DT-TBT) show an increase, although an electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit is introduced into the polymer backbone. The increase of HOMO is probably ascribed to the π-expansion of TBT relative to T2. The optical properties of P(ANDI2DT-TBT) in dichlorobenzene solution and as thin films were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3b, in dichlorobenzene solution, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) shows a broad absorption band from 300 nm to 714 nm; in addition, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) shows an absorption maximum (λmax) of about 558 nm, followed by an additional shoulder peak at about 670 nm, which may indicate that there is aggregation behavior for P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) even in dilute solution, or there is an unfavored transition due to the asymmetric distribution of the molecular orbitals. In the solid state, the maximum absorption peak shows a slight red-shift (6 nm) in comparison with that of the solution absorption due to the stronger aggregation of the polymer chains in the films. Thermal annealing didn't have an obvious impact on the absorptions of the thin films of polymer P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT), which implies that P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) tends to form a ordered crystalline structure even in pristine film form (Fig. S4).


Bottom-gate bottom-contact OFETs based on the thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) were fabricated to investigate the charge transport properties. The device performance was measured under ambient conditions. Fig. 4 gives the typical transfer and output characteristics of OFETs based on the thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) when annealed at 120 °C, and P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) mainly shows p-type charge transport behavior under ambient conditions. The as-spun thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) show an average mobility of 0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the optimized mobility of the previously reported P(iso-NDI2OD-T2) (0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1). When annealed at 120 °C, the hole mobility increased to 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of 105. In addition, the threshold voltages (VT) also show a decrease from −21 to −10 V with the annealing temperature increasing from rt to 160 °C. It is worthy of note that the molecular weight is generally thought to have an important impact on the performance of polymer semiconductors, as high molecular weight is in favor of high mobility. Although the molecular weight of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) is just less than 1/3 of P(iso-NDI2OD-T2) (20.1 kDa vs. 74.1 kDa), its mobility is almost three times the optimized performance of P(iso-NDI2OD-T2), indicating the more efficient charge transport of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) than that of P(iso-NDI2OD-T2). The excellent performance of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) is probably ascribed to the improvement of the film morphology and crystallinity, due to the increased interchain D–A interactions and the improved planarity of the polymer main chain.


In order to deeply understand the high charge mobility of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT), the thin film microstructures and topographies of the as-spun and annealed thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) deposited on the OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrates were investigated by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S5, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) presents a primary diffraction peak (100) at 2θ = 2.56°, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 27.4 Å, and a secondary diffraction peak (200) at 2θ = 5.13°, indicating that some degree of crystallinity has formed for the pristine films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) at room temperature. When annealed at 120 °C, the diffraction patterns became stronger and sharper, with the (100) peak at 2θ = 2.66° and (200) peak at 2θ = 5.38°, suggesting that a more ordered crystalline structure was formed. Two dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) was also implemented on the thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT). As shown in Fig. 5a and b, two out-of-plane diffractions were exhibited for the as-spun thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT), which were attributed to the (100) and (200) diffractions. After annealing at 120 °C, the intensity of the diffractions definitely increased, indicating the improved film crystallinity. The XRD results indicated that the polymer chains adopted a layer-by-layer lamellar packing motif in its thin films as mostly reported crystalline conjugated polymers and the packing pattern is edge-on mode. This packing pattern is considered to be beneficial in achieving a higher charge mobility and might be one of the reasons for the higher charge mobility of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) than that of the amorphous P(iso-NDI2OD-T2). Fig. 5c and d show the AFM images of the as-spun and annealed thin films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT). The pristine films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) show granular features at micrometer scales which assembled into compact and ordered rod-like patterns. As the annealing temperature increased to 120 °C, these rod-like structures developed and established interconnected network-like patterns, which would form highly efficient pathways for charge carrier transport. The better film morphology and crystallinity upon annealing are well in accordance with the improved OFET performances (Table 1).

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were also fabricated by spin-coating the solution of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT)/PC61BM (in o-dichlorobenzene) onto the PEDOT/PSS-coated ITO glasses, followed by vacuum evaporation of Ca and Al as the cathode. Fig. S6 depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the polymer devices. The device performance data are presented in Table S1 in the ESI. A primary investigation of the weight ratio of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT)/PC61BM indicates that a ratio of 1:1 is plausible for affording good device performance (Table S1). And a PCE of 1.11 was recorded with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.18 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 53.8%. Despite a high Voc of up to 0.95 V, the PCE of the device was limited by the poor current. The AFM image of the blend films of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) and PC61BM presented a very coarse domain with a root mean square (RMS) of 10.26 nm (Fig. S7), which we believe might hamper effective exciton diffusion and migration of separated charges in the blend film, thus decreasing the Jsc of the P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT)/PC61BM devices. After the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the film morphology was significantly improved and the short circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) were increased, leading to a device efficiency of 1.54% (Fig. S7 and Table S1).


In conclusion, a new copolymer, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT), has been prepared by incorporating benzothiadiazole units into 1,2,5,6-NDI and thiophene based copolymers, and then applied as an active layer for OFET and OPV. In comparison with the previously reported polymers based on 1,2,5,6-NDIs and bithiophene, P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) shows improved film crystallinity and morphology as well as charge transport characteristics. Bottom gate bottom contact OFETs based on P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) displayed a high hole mobility of 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio of 105, which is a record mobility for 1,2,5,6-NDI based polymers reported to date. The high charge mobility of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) is ascribed to its improved film crystallinity and morphology. In addition, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells employing P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT)/PC61BM as active layers, show a PCE of 1.54% with a high Voc of 0.9 V. This research will provide important clues for designing high performance semiconductors and also demonstrates that 1,2,5,6-NDIs are promising building blocks for constructing high performance polymer semiconductors.

Electrochemical measurements for polymer P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT) were carried out on a CHI610D electrochemical workstation using a platinum working electrode coated with polymer films, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode in a solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in CH3CN at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on a PL-GPC220 instrument at different temperatures, using trichlorobenzene as the eluent and polystyrene standards as calibrants. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and two-dimensional (2D) grazing incident X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) measurements were carried out at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) on beamline BL14B1 with λ = 1.24 Å. The incidence angle of 0.16° was chosen to optimize the signal-to-background ratio, and the image diffraction patterns were recorded using a detector MAR3450. AFM was recorded on a Nanoscope IIIa atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode.


Iso-NDA-2Br was synthesized according to the previously reported method. 4,7-Bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole was purchased from commercial sources and used as received.


The Si/SiO2 substrates were cleaned and modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). Transistors were fabricated in the bottom-gate bottom-contact device configurations. The organic active layer was deposited by a spin-coating process with a film thickness of about 50 nm (10 mg mL−1 in dichlorobenzene at 3000 rpm). The thin films were annealed at 120 and 160 °C, respectively for 1 hour under vacuum. Then the Au source and drain electrodes were deposited through a shadow mask by vacuum evaporation with a channel length of 273 μm and a width of 31 μm.


The OPV devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned successively by ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and then subjected to UV/ozone cleaning for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP. Al 4083) was spin-coated on the top of the ITO layer from its aqueous solution and baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The active layer film (with a thickness of about 100 nm) was prepared by spin-coating from an o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution of P(iso-NDI2DT-TBT)/PC61BM at a speed rate of 2000 rpm for 60 s in a glove box. Then, the Ca layer (10 nm) and the Al layer (100 nm) were successively deposited on the top of the active layer under high vacuum through a shadow mask. The effective area was 7 mm2 for each device. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded on a Keithley 2420 source meter. Solar illumination was provided by using an AAA solar simulator (Oriel94043A, 450 W) with the AM 1.5G filter.


Iso-NDA-2Br (166 mg, 0.39 mmol) was reacted with 2-decyltetradecan-1-amine (345 mg, 0.97 mmol) in refluxed glacial acetic acid (10 mL) for 5 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. After removing the acetic acid under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography, using the mixture of petroleum ether and dichloromethane (3:1) as the eluent. A 350 mg yellow product was obtained (yield: 82%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 0.84–0.87 (m, 12H), 1.22–1.28 (m, 80H), 2.18 (m, 2H, CH), 3.62–3.63 (m, 4H), 9.50 (s, 2H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 14.08, 22.65, 26.30, 29.31, 29.32, 29.56, 29.59, 29.62, 29.65, 29.89, 31.52, 31.69, 37.09, 42.87, 117.19, 128.09, 130.07, 130.77, 135.83, 165.99, 167.35; MS (MALDI-TOF) m/z: 1098.0 (M + H)+; Anal.

To a mixture of iso-NDI2DT-2Br (100 mg, 0.091 mmol) and 4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (58 mg, 0.093 mmol) in toluene (12 mL), Pd2(dba)3 (3 mg, 4% mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (4 mg, 0.15 mmol) were added under a N2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and dropped into methanol (500 mL). The bluish violet precipitate was filtered. The resulting solid was subjected to Soxhlet extraction successively with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform to remove the oligomers and impurities. The remaining polymer was extracted with chlorobenzene and precipitated again from methanol, filtered, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. 95 mg of an aeruginous copolymer was obtained (yield: 85%).
