We demonstrate that the post-adsorption of small molecules (a phenothiazine-based dye) on the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 anode surface plays dual roles: (1) to greatly retard the back reaction between conduction-band electrons in TiO2 and the oxidized species (I3−) in the electrolyte and (2) to enhance the spectral response of solar cells. These two effects finally give rise to device efficiencies exceeding 10%, which are superior to those of individual dye-sensitized devices by either porphyrin (7.4%) or phenothiazine (8.2%) under the same conditions. Experimental analyses show that the incoming small molecules are adsorbed in the interstitial site of porphyrin dyes, forming densely surface packed molecules and thus impeding the I3− species from approaching the TiO2 surface. Since a broad range of ruthenium-based dyes and porphyrin-based photosensitizers possess relatively large molecular volumes, this method is anticipated to be applicable for further improving the energy conversion efficiency of devices sensitized by these two classes of dyes.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received increasing interest due to their low fabrication cost and reasonably high power conversion efficiency (PCE, η). The colourful, transparent, and light-weight characteristics make them even more attractive in terms of practical applications. In this device configuration, the dye molecule serves as the light harvester. The electrons in the excited state of dye molecules injecting into the conduction band of TiO2 enable charge carrier separation for final charge collection at the anode. On the other hand, a competitive process is that the electron in the conduction band of TiO2 is also prone to reacting with the oxidized species (I3−) of the redox couple; this process is regarded as a major recombination mechanism in DSSCs. Obviously, a large exposure of TiO2 surface area to the electrolyte is favourable for the I3− adsorption and hence the back reaction. To solve this problem, surface passivation is usually implemented by using co-adsorbent or hydrolysed inorganic materials to minimize the TiO2 surface area in direct contact with the electrolyte, both of which form barriers that impede the I3− approaching the TiO2 surface. It is noted that the conventionally used co-adsorbents are generally small organic molecules, such as stearic acid, citric acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, etc., which do not exhibit light response and photocurrent generation in the visible and near-infrared regions. To further improve the performance of DSSCs, we demonstrate here for the first time the use of small dye molecules for surface passivation; they thus act as both co-adsorbent and light harvester upon co-adsorption with zinc-based porphyrin (ZnP) dyes.

ZnP dyes have demonstrated unique spectral characteristics with high extinction coefficients in the ranges of 400–500 nm (Soret band) and 600–700 nm (Q band). The recent advancement exploiting ZnP dye molecules has reached efficiency of around 11%, while co-sensitization with other organic dye molecules has achieved PCE values exceeding 12%. ZnP molecules are also excellent dyes for near-infrared light harvesting due to the high extinction coefficient of the Q band. However, a drawback of porphyrin-based dyes is that they typically display weak absorption in the range of 500–600 nm (between Soret and Q bands), where the sun supplies a considerable amount of light energy. In this context, we make use of a phenothiazine-based dye which has strong light response in the visible range to complement the spectral response of ZnP-sensitized devices, aiming at achieving strong panchromatic light harvesting.
The structures of the used phenothiazine molecule (PT-C6) and ZnP dye are depicted in Scheme 1a. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the dye molecules are higher than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (Scheme 1b, Table S1), which enables charge injection. On the other hand, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the two dyes are lower than the chemical potential of the redox couple (Scheme 1b), ensuring the regeneration of the dye molecules. Compared with porphyrin-based dye molecules, PT-C6 has a simple molecular structure and small volume. It is well known that small molecules with alkyl chains tend to form a densely packed monolayer due to the weak steric hindrance. Furthermore, the post-adsorption of small molecules into the interstitial sites of large-molecule layers would greatly increase the overall surface molecular coverage, thus impeding the I3− percolation to the TiO2 surface (Scheme 1c).
The ZnP solution shows strong light absorption in the ranges of 400–500 nm and 630–685 nm (Fig. 1a), which are typical absorption features of porphyrin-based dye molecules. PT-C6 presents broad spectral response ranging from the blue end to ∼560 nm (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b presents the absorption spectra of ZnP and PT-C6 anchored TiO2 films on transparent conducting glass, which display similar absorption features to the corresponding dye solutions. In addition, it is observed that when ZnP was adsorbed on the TiO2 film, the absorption peak of the Soret band was slightly blue-shifted, from 455 nm to 450 nm, when compared to that in solution. This type of band shift is due to the H-type aggregation of ZnP on TiO2. The co-adsorbed TiO2 film with PT-C6 and ZnP exhibits enhanced light absorption when compared with the individually sensitized films (Fig. 1b). Notably, the Q band is slightly broadened in Fig. 1b in comparison to the absorption characteristics in solution (Fig. 1a). This also ensures harvesting more sunlight. It is also noted that the absorption peak at the Soret band is shifted back to 455 nm after co-sensitization, which indicates that the adsorption of PT-C6 could cause a reorientation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface to a more upright configuration and reduce the aggregation of ZnP on the TiO2 surface as a consequence of the steric repulsion resulting from PT-C6.
In this study, the co-sensitized anode films were prepared by a stepwise dye soaking process. For comparison, control devices sensitized individually by ZnP and PT-C6 (devices 1 and 2, respectively) were also fabricated. Fig. 2a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The PCEs are calculated to be 7.4% (device 1, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.78 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.699 V and fill factor (FF) of 67.5%) and 8.16% (device 2, Jsc = 14.70 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.778 V, FF = 71.3%). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE, Fig. 2b) spectra show similar photocurrent generation profiles to their absorption features.
In co-sensitized DSSCs, the relative surface coverage of the two types of molecules is vital to the overall light harvesting efficiency. Here, the surface coverage of each was controlled by incubating the anode films in the two separate dye solutions for different periods of times. Firstly, the TiO2 film was soaked in ZnP solution for 10 h, followed by incubation in PT-C6 solution for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10 h, denoted as devices 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Upon the adsorption of PT-C6 from 1 to 3 h, the photocurrent conversion efficiency showed gradual improvement in the blue end and 500–630 nm region (Fig. 2b), suggesting that PT-C6 is capable of making up the intrinsically weak spectral response of ZnP-sensitized solar cells. When the incubation time was increased to 10 h, the IPCE curve remained nearly unchanged when compared with that at 4 h, indicating a saturated adsorption of PC-C6 on the ZnP-anchored film surface.
We further performed measurement of dye loading capacities of some typical devices. The devices 1 and 2 show dye uptake amounts of 110.3 and 822.9 nmol cm−2 after incubation in ZnP and PT-C6 solutions for 10 h, respectively. It should be noted that the incubation for 10 h has already reached the device maximum loading capacities; further extension of the loading time did not lead to improved dye loading capacities and device performance. Since the volume of the ZnP molecule is much larger than that of PT-C6, the uptake amount of device 2 is much higher than that of device 1. In the cosensitized devices, with the post-adsorption of PT-C6 for 1, 4 and 10 h, the loading amounts of ZnP show only tiny alterations, from 107.9, 103.0 to 116.4 nmol cm−2 (Table 1), indicating that the ZnP could not be replaced by PT-C6, and PT-C6 molecules were mostly likely inserted in the interstitial sites of ZnP. However, the adsorption for 10 h in PT-C6 results in lower loading capacity (device 7), this may be due to the dissociation of PT-C6 with much longer incubation time. In addition, the FF is reduced in device 7 when compared with devices 4, 5 and 6 (Table 1). Therefore, the long time incubation would cause an unfavourable spatial conformation of the dye molecules to degrade the device quality.

Furthermore, compared with the significant IPCE improvement in the blue end and 500–630 nm region, the IPCE intensities corresponding to the Q band (670 nm) of ZnP show a relatively small enhancement from devices 3 to 7 (Fig. 2b). The IPCE is a product of light harvesting efficiency, charge injection efficiency and charge collection efficiency. Here, the light harvesting efficiency in this region and charge injection efficiency should remain the same since the photocurrent generation at ∼670 nm of PT-C6 is negligible. Therefore, the IPCE enhancement should be ascribed to the improved charge collection efficiency, which is due to PT-C6 impeding the electron leakage by increasing the molecule surface coverage in devices 3–7. In this case, PT-C6 plays the role of a co-adsorbent similar to other investigations. In addition, the increased IPCE in this region after PT-C6 adsorption also indicates that the replacement of ZnP by PT-C6 in the post-adsorption process is less possible. Therefore, the most probable configuration of the surface molecular packing involves the insertion of small PT-C6 molecules into the interstitial sites of the ZnP-anchored film (Scheme 1c). An interesting observation is that the post-adsorption of PT-C6 did not give rise to considerable enhancement of IPCE at its absorption peak of ∼450 nm. This can be understood as the light harvesting has been approaching its maximum in the devices due to the high absorption coefficient of ZnP at 450 nm, and the significant IPCE improvement in the weak absorption regions of ZnP, i.e., the blue end and 500–630 nm region, confirms this assumption.
From the J–V characteristics, a gradual PCE improvement was observed with increasing adsorption of PT-C6. Specifically, the dye soaking in PT-C6 solution for 1 h led to a PCE of 9.0%, and it was further increased to 9.8% and 10.0% when the dye adsorption was extended to 2 and 3 h, respectively. Afterwards, the PCE reached a maximum value of 10.1% (Jsc = 19.36 mA cm−2; Voc = 0.735 V) when the incubation time of the ZnP-sensitized film in PT-C6 was prolonged to 4 h. Further extending the incubation time to 10 h did not bring forth improvement of the device performances. This is consistent with the IPCE changes when the dye loading is saturated after 4 h. All the photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1 for easy comparison. It is observed that, in the co-sensitized devices ( devices 3 to 7), the remarkably increased Jsc is the main reason for the final PCE improvement (Table 1). The increased Jsc is caused by the improved photon to electron conversion efficiency. We also noted that the Jsc estimated from IPCE spectra is generally smaller than that from the J–V curve by around 4 mA cm−2 (Tables 1 and S2). Herein, the IPCE spectra were obtained through a wavelength-dependent measurement, while the J–V characteristics were obtained by full sunlight irradiation, the latter of which generates more electrons during the measurement and thus a high electron gradient inside the anode, enabling more efficient charge transport/collection. On the other hand, in the measurement of J–V characteristics, heat is inevitably generated inside the devices, mainly from the near-infrared light irradiation of the solar simulator. This temperature increase usually results in considerable improvement of chemical diffusion of electrons and charge generation yield for higher Jsc. However, in wavelength-dependent IPCE measurement, heat generation is negligible. These two effects should contribute jointly to the Jsc obtained in J–V curves being systematically higher than those estimated from IPCE spectra.
To study the effect of dye loading sequence on the device performance, we reversed the soaking process. Optimizations show that the anode film sensitized first in PT-C6 (10 h) and then in ZnP (4 h) gives the highest PCE of 8.6% in device 8. The IPCE spectrum reveals that the photocurrent generation at around 670 nm is greatly enhanced (Fig. S2). Since PT-C6 does not exhibit light absorption in this region (Fig. 2b), this improvement indicates that the incubation of the PT-C6-adsorbed film in ZnP solution could lead to the replacement of PT-C6 by ZnP. However, as discussed above, if the anode is firstly adsorbed by ZnP followed by PT-C6, the typical IPCE peak (Q band) of ZnP is only slightly enhanced. These observations suggest that ZnP possesses stronger binding affinity with TiO2 than that of PT-C6.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions was performed to elucidate the interfacial charge recombination process in DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 3a, a major semicircle for each device was observed in the Nyquist plot, which reflects the resistance of electron transport at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, i.e., the recombination kinetics between conduction-band electrons in TiO2 and I3− species from the electrolyte. The resistance values (RCT) correspond to the diameters of the semicircles; the larger the RCT, the slower the recombination kinetics. Apparently, device 1 presents the smallest RCT (the calculated value is 55.7 Ω, Table S2) while PT-C6 sensitized device 2 generates the largest one (371.2 Ω), indicating that small molecules are favourable for a densely packed monolayer to block I3− in contact with TiO2, while large molecules tend to leave larger “exposed” surface areas and increase the back reaction probability. Consequently, the post-adsorption of PT-C6 can increase the molecular surface coverage of a ZnP sensitized anode and then reduce the back reaction. Due to the reduced back charge transfer, there should be higher electron density in the conduction band of TiO2 that could cause a lift-up of the Fermi level for higher Voc, since Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level and the potential of the redox pair in the electrolyte. As a result, from devices 3 to 7, an increasing trend of charge recombination resistance is observed, which is consistent with the Voc evolution. In addition, the alkyl chain of PT-C6 could also impede the diffusion of I3− onto TiO2 surface. Further investigation shows that an even higher Voc (0.748 V) and RCT (205.15 Ω, Fig. S4) can be obtained by reducing the surface coverage of ZnP and increasing that of PT-C6 (device 9, anode film was soaked in ZnP for 2 h and PT-C6 for 10 h). The recombination between the conduction band electrons with I3− is regarded as the main reason for the small Voc of porphyrin sensitized solar cells; the use of small molecules can be an effective way to resist the Voc leakage.
From the Bode phase plots of the devices (Fig. 3b, in the dark), the characteristic back charge transfer frequencies (f) are obtained, which correspond to the peaks of the Bode phase plots. The f of device 1 (35.53 Hz) is the largest one while that of device 2 (5.43 Hz) is the smallest one, indicating that the small molecule formed monolayer is much more efficient for decreasing the charge transfer frequency than the larger molecular adsorption. Therefore, f is gradually decreased with the increasing adsorption of PT-C6 (Fig. 3b).
To further probe the recombination kinetics of the devices, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was recorded to illustrate the lifetime of Voc from a steady state to dark equilibrium. Fig. 4a shows the OCVD profiles of devices 1 to 9. The profiles in the interval from 120 to 150 s were enlarged for distinct observation (Fig. 4b). The correlation between Voc decay and electron lifetime (τn′) can be described by eqn (1):
(1)
where
kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and e is the electron charge. The electron lifetimes can be extracted from the slopes of the Voc decay curves.

The decay curve of device 1 presents the steepest initial slope while the voltage decay of device 2 displays the slowest one, which suggest the shortest electron lifespan of the ZnP-sensitized DSSC and the longest one of the PT-C6 sensitized device. This variation matches well with the EIS analysis and the photovoltaic performances. From device 3 to device 7, the slopes become more and more gentle, indicating that the electron lifetimes are gradually increased with increased surface coverage of PT-C6.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that small dye molecules can serve as both co-adsorbent to retard back electron transfer and light harvester when co-sensitized with large molecules. The co-sensitized devices exhibits remarkable overall efficiency improvements of 36% or 24% as compared with the devices individually sensitized by the porphyrin or phenothiazine-based dyes, finally achieving high energy conversion of 10.1%. Co-sensitization offers a powerful way to achieve strong and broad spectral response of DSSCs, and application of dye molecules with complementary absorption maxima is the prerequisite for efficient light harvesting. However, other factors such as the molecule surface organization should also be considered to achieve highly efficient photovoltaic energy conversion. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method applying small molecules to retard recombination kinetics and enhance light harvesting is unprecedented in co-sensitized devices. The method is simple and could be applicable to a broad range of multiple-dye-sensitized solar cells.

TiO2 anode films with thicknesses of 18 μm (12 μm transparent layer and 6 μm scattering layer) were prepared by a sequential printing method modified from our previous approach. Afterwards, the films were sintered to remove polymers to form TiO2 nanoparticle networks. Then, these sintered films were soaked in 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 60 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature for the following dye soaking. The ZnP dye (0.2 mM) was dissolved in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution; and PT-C6 (0.5 mM) was also dissolved in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution. The electrodes for devices 1 and 2 were immersed in ZnP solution and PT-C6 solution, respectively. They were held in the solution for 10 h to achieve enough dye loading for the maximum efficiency. The electrodes of devices 3–7 were all firstly soaked in ZnP solution for 10 h, and then they were transferred into PT-C6 solution for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 10 h, respectively. The electrode of device 8 was immersed in PT-C6 for 10 h and then in ZnP for 4 h, and the electrode of device 9 was first immersed in ZnP for 2 h and then in PT-C6 for 10 h. Afterwards, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and dried in air. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by a sputtering method. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt film (SX1170, thickness 60 μm), in which liquid LiI/I2 redox couple based electrolyte was applied for the dye regeneration. The effective areas of all the TiO2 electrodes were 0.196 cm2.


UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-3501 UV-visible/NIR spectrophotometer. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled cells were measured by a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from a solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. IPCE action spectra of DSSCs were recorded in a Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) using DC mode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out by applying a bias of 700 mV under dark conditions over a frequency range of 0.1 × 105 Hz and AC amplitude of 10 mV. The parameters were calculated using Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner AssociatNe, Inc.). For the open-circuit voltage decay measurements, the cell was first illuminated for 20 s to a steady voltage, then the illumination was turned off for 80 s and the OCVD curve was recorded, and this process was repeated for three periods. The above two measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.
