During the past decades, various semiconductors (such as TiO2 and ZnO) have been proven to be excellent photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical applications. However, there are still many challenges that need to be resolved, including the enhancement of solar energy conversion, the suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and the effective utilization of visible light. On the basis of graphene's unique structure and excellent properties, the combination of graphene with semiconductors presents the possibility to possess simultaneously excellent adsorptivity, transparency, conductivity and controllability, which could facilitate effective photoelectrochemical performance. Over the past few years, much work has been attempted on the design and preparation of novel graphene-based materials and the exploration of their applications in photoelectrochemistry, and considerable advances in this area have already been made. This review article explores and summarizes the recent advances in graphene-based materials for photoelectrochemical applications, including photoelectrochemical solar cells, photocatalytic decomposition, photocatalytic splitting of H2O, photocatalytic conversion for fuels, and so forth. Also, the prospects and further developments of graphene-based materials in this exciting field are suggested.


As a rapidly rising star in the field of materials science, graphene has generated increasing interest both in fundamental science and potential applications due to its unique structure and remarkable properties such as excellent conductivity, high electron mobility, superior chemical stability and large surface-to-volume ratio. Comprehensive reviews on the properties and applications of this material are available. With respect to its physical structure, graphene is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb network of six-membered rings. The one-atom-thick structure provides graphene with high transparency and an ultrahigh theoretical surface area of 2600 m2 g−1. Particularly, long range π-conjugation in graphene permits ballistic transport, meaning that the electrons in graphene can behave like massless relativistic particles and travel without scattering at mobilities exceeding ∼15000 m2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. This makes graphene possess a number of very peculiar electronic properties such as the quantum Hall effect, an ambipolar electric field effect, the Klein paradox, and transport via relativistic Dirac fermions. Apart from these unique electronic properties, graphene can be made insulating, semiconducting, or semimetallic by appropriately tuning the oxidation or reduction process to control its structural order. Moreover, the surface properties of graphene could be also adjusted via chemical modification, which offers tremendous opportunities for functionalized graphene-based materials. Thus, these unique physicochemical properties of graphene suggest the potential to provide new approaches and critical improvements for many applications including energy storage, catalysis, biosensors, and drug delivery,etc.

Since the discovery of the photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, semiconductor materials-based photoelectrochemical systems have been extensively studied to alleviate the deterioration of natural environments created by toxic pollutants and the exhaustion of energy resources by photogeneration of electricity and photocatalytic hydrogen production from water utilizing light. It is known that the unique electronic structure of a semiconductor, consisting of a filled valence band (VB) and an empty conduction band (CB), plays a key role in photoelectrochemical processes. When the semiconductor is excited by a photon with energy equal to or higher than its band gap energy (Eg), an electron in the VB is thus promoted to the CB, leaving a positive hole in the VB. The photo-generated electrons and holes that migrate to the surface of the semiconductor without recombination can, respectively, reduce and oxidize the reactants adsorbed by the semiconductor. The reduction and oxidation reactions are the basic mechanisms of photocatalytic pollutant degradation, photocatalytic hydrogen production and solar photovoltaics. Theoretically, semiconductors that satisfy the above-mentioned requirements can be used as photocatalysts for light-induced electrochemical reaction. To date, a number of semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, WO3, CdS, Bi2WO4 and NaTaO3, etc.) have been proven to be excellent photocatalysts for photoelectrochemical applications, and considerable advances in this area have already been made. However, there are still many challenges that are yet to be met before these photoelectrochemical processes become economically feasible, including the enhancement of solar energy conversion, the suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, as well as the effective utilization of visible light. In order to solve these problems, a variety of strategies have been developed to improve the photoelectrochemical performance and enhance the visible light response of semiconductor materials, for example, via addition of electron donors (hole scavengers), controlled incorporation of oxygen vacancies, noble metal loading, metal ion doping, anion doping, dye sensitization and formation of composite semiconductors. In particular, much recent attention has been attracted to explore graphene and its derivatives for photoelectrochemical applications, with the potential to harness graphene's excellent properties for opening up new opportunities in next generation photoelectrochemical systems. On the basis of graphene's unique structure and excellent properties, the application of graphene in combination with semiconductor materials presents the possibility to possess simultaneously excellent adsorptivity, transparency, conductivity, and controllability, which could facilitate effective photoelectrochemical performance. Over the past few years, much work has been attempted to design and prepare novel graphene-based materials and explore their applications in photoelectrochemistry. Examples include the use of graphene-based materials as transparent conductive electrodes or active materials in solar cells, photocatalysts for pollutant degradation, photocatalytic hydrogen production and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels.
In this review article, we briefly review the state of research on graphene-based materials from the standpoint of photoelectrochemistry. Focusing on the discussion of photoelectrochemical properties and processes of graphene-based materials, we then explore and summarize the exciting recent progress on the use of graphene-based materials for photoelectrochemical applications (Fig. 1), including photoelectrochemical solar cells, photocatalytic decomposition, photocatalytic splitting of H2O, photocatalytic conversion for fuels and so forth. In addition, the prospects and further developments of graphene-based materials in this exciting field will be also suggested.

As is known, photoelectric events (such as photonic absorption, electrons and holes separation/recombination, etc.) and mass transfer (such as adsorption/desorption, diffusion, etc.) are key steps that can affect photoelectrochemical activity. Thus, it is important to elucidate the role of graphene in photoelectric events and mass transfer during photoelectrochemical processes to improve the photoelectrochemical properties of graphene-based materials and facilitating their photoelectrochemical applications. To date, graphene-based materials have been proven to possess improved photoelectrochemical activities. However, the roles of graphene in promoting photoelectrochemical activities are still not clearly understood, and the elucidation of the roles of graphene in photoelectrochemical processes needs to be further explored.

A photoelectrochemical process can be defined as a photoinduced reaction, which involves transforming light into other forms of energy, on the basis of semiconductor materials. In an illuminated semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical system, three key processes usually take place in sequence. The first key process is the absorption of photons to create electron–hole pairs. The ability of a semiconductor to absorb light at various wavelengths is exclusively determined by its electronic structure, namely the position of the valence and conduction bands (ΦVB and ΦCB). For photons to be absorbed, they must be energetic enough to promote electrons from the valence to the conduction band (hν ≥ ΦVB − ΦCB). The second key process is the separation and migration of the photogenerated electrons and holes to surface reaction sites, or recombination. The most widely used parameters to characterize this type of transport are the diffusion length of holes and electrons, and the recombination rate. It has been revealed by time resolved spectroscopic studies that electron–hole trapping or recombination rates are extremely fast (of the order of 10−6 to 10−15 s), which can substantially lower the photoelectrochemical activity. When the particle size is reduced, however, the diffusion length of the photogenerated holes and electrons to surface reaction sites tends to be reduced, thereby reducing the recombination probability. The final key process involves the surface chemical reactions, usually including at least two reactions, i.e., oxidation by photogenerated holes and reduction by photogenerated electrons, in which several highly reactive species (such as ˙OH, ˙O2−, and H2O2) are usually involved. For the surface chemical reactions, of importance are surface character (active sites) and quantity (surface area). The use of cocatalysts (such as Pt, NiO, and RuO2) to introduce suitable active sites and increase the rate of surface reactions is extremely common, while increased surface area can be obtained by using highly porous materials, and/or reducing their sizes. Thus, from the viewpoint of the above three key processes, there are three fundamental approaches for enhancement of photoelectrochemical activities: (i) band-gap tuning and/or extension of excitation wavelength by use of photosensitizers; (ii) minimizing charge carrier recombination; and (iii) promotion of the surface chemical reactions through provision of adequate quality and quantity of active sites.
On the basis of the intrinsic physical and chemical characteristics of graphene, the application of graphene in combination with semiconductor nanoparticles presents the opportunity to cover simultaneously all three of the mechanisms of photoelectrochemical enhancement, as described above. Employed as a scaffold, graphene can create a 2D conductive support path for charge transport and collection, which can be used to enhance the electron transport properties of nanostructured semiconductors and dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical systems. Because of its higher work function, graphene can act as an electron shuttle to induce easier electron transfer from the conduction band of semiconductors or the excited dye to graphene, leading to an efficient charge separation and significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity. The electron transfer from excited semiconductors or dyes into graphene nanosheets continues until the two systems attain charge equilibration. Some of these transferred electrons are consumed in the reduction reaction on the surface of graphene while some are stored in the graphene network. In addition to serving as a sink and shuttle for photoexcited electrons, the formation of chemical bonds and nano-sized Schottky interfaces at the contacts between semiconductor and graphene can narrow the band gap of semiconductor particles and extend the photoresponse range, thus leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical activities. Besides, graphene can provide large amounts of surface reaction sites due to the extra large surface area, and the surface chemistry of graphene may be tailored to promote specificity towards adsorbents. Very recently, it has also been revealed that graphene may enhance photoelectrochemical activities by acting as a photosensitizer, and transferring the excited electrons in the upper valence band from graphene to the conduction band of semiconductor nanoparticles due to the large difference in work function between graphene and semiconductor nanoparticles.
Thus, it can be concluded from the above discussion that although graphene is much more popular than its forebears (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) at present, graphene-based materials basically exhibit four positive factors that can potentially enhance photoelectrochemical activity, including: the minimization of electron–hole recombination; band gap tuning; provision of high quality highly adsorptive active sites; and photosensitization. In fact, all four factors were well established in other carbon-based photocatalysts, and the previous literature has strongly shown that graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts are in essence the same as other carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon)-based semiconductor photocatalysts in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Therefore, it is still hard to clarify whether graphene is superior to other carbon materials when combined with other semiconductor photocatalysts for enhanced photoelectrochemical activities. A full understanding of the role of graphene to the photoelectrochemical properties and mechanisms of graphene-based materials in photoelectrochemical process still needs more evidence. However, it should be noted that graphene has a number of unique intrinsic properties that make possible graphene's superiority to other carbon materials in photoelectrochemical applications. One important advantage is that electrons move much faster through graphene than through other carbon materials. They behave as massless Dirac fermions and travel at 1/300 the speed of light. Another advantage is that graphene is also very good at absorbing light over a very wide range of wavelengths, ranging from the visible to the infrared. Other carbon materials do not work over such a wide range. Other advantages include an ultrahigh theoretical surface area of 2600 m2 g−1 and high transparency, which is much higher than those exhibited by other carbon materials.
On the other hand, except for the above-mentioned functions of graphene for the enhancement of photoelectrochemical activity, graphene itself (or its derivatives) have been proven to possess intrinsic photoelectrochemical properties. For example, as one of the graphene derivatives, graphene oxide (GO) itself has been found to possess a significant level of self-photocatalytic ability for water splitting, with encouraging results due to its tunable band-gap by adjusting the degree of oxidation. Under irradiation with UV or visible light, the GO photocatalyst could steadily catalyze H2 generation from a 20 vol% aqueous methanol solution and pure water. For another example, the high-quality monolayer or bilayer graphene itself has demonstrated an intrinsic photoresponse, and the origin of the intrinsic photoresponse in graphene is attributed to either thermoelectric or photovoltaic effects. This kind of intrinsic photoresponse may offer a path to hot carrier-assisted optoelectric technologies for efficient solar energy harvesting.

A solar cell (also known as photovoltaic (PV) device) can convert sunlight into electrical energy, and thus has been considered as one of the state-of-the-art solutions to energy issues. Besides the well commercialized Si based solar cells, inexpensive alternatives, including organic PVs, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), have also attracted extensive investigation. Graphene-based materials, owing to their excellent electrical conductivities, high transparency, strong capability in accepting electrons, wide band tunability, as well as flexibility, have been much involved in recent advances in the field of solar cells.


Polymer solar cells, or organic solar cells (also known as organic photovoltaics, OPV), are of great interest as a promising alternative to traditional solar cells due to their light weight, ease of manufacture, compatibility with flexible substrates, and low cost. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPVs is still inferior to the traditional Si or quantum dots (QDs)-based PVs. To date, graphene-based materials have been applied in OPVs as transparent electrodes, electron acceptors or hole transporters and so on, with a view to achieving enhanced performances.


An ideal transparent electrode for a solar cell should fulfil the requirements of high transparency (>80%) in a wide window, low sheet resistivity (Rs < 100 Ω per square), as well as a proper work function (4.5–5.2 eV). Currently, the transparent electrode in organic solar cells is indium tin oxide (ITO), which possesses a transparency of >90% at the wavelength of 550 nm, a Rs of 10–30 Ω per square and a favorable work function. However, the use of ITO is increasingly problematic due to the scarcity of the indium source, its sensitivity toward acid–base, susceptibility to ion diffusion into polymer layers, as well as the brittle nature of the oxides. As opposed to the rising cost and brittleness of ITO, the low cost, unique optical and electrical properties, chemical robustness, as well as the high flexibility facilitate graphene as a promising new generation transparent electrode. Recently, graphene and its derivatives have been employed as alternative transparent electrodes for OPVs, and the corresponding OPVs exhibited promising performances as shown in Table 1. For example, Chen and coworkers explored the possibility of the chemically and thermally reduced GO (rGO) as the transparent electrode for OPVs. It was found that the transmittance of as-prepared rGO was as high as >80% in the range of 400–1800 nm, while the Rs was ≥1 kΩ per square, which was much higher than that of the ITO electrode. They also demonstrated that the transmittance and conductivity were dependent on the thickness of the graphene film. By stacking more layers of graphene nanosheets, the conductivity increased whereas the transmittance was compromised. As for the OPV devices based on the graphene film with thicknesses of 4 and 7 nm, the transmittance and Rs of the graphene films were measured to be 95–85% and 100 to 500 kΩ per square, respectively. Due to the relatively high resistance, the optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the graphene-based OPV device was reported to be 0.4%, which was lower than that of the ITO-based OPV device (0.84%). Though the rGO-based OPV devices show high resistance and low PCEs, the rGO films offer a unique advantage of excellent flexibility over ITO-based films as the transparent flexible electrodes in OPVs. As reported by Zhang and co-workers, rGO was transferred onto flexible substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and then used as transparent and conductive electrodes for OPVs. The highest PCE obtained in such a rGO–PET-based OPV was 0.78% with a transparency of 55% and a Rs of 1.6 kΩ per square, which was still inferior to that of ITO-based OPVs. With an applied tensile strain (∼2.9%), the fabricated rGO–PET-based OPVs were able to sustain a thousand cycles of bending, whereas the ITO-based OPVs showed obvious cracks upon bending (Fig. 2). In addition, compared to chemical or thermal reduction of GO, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method has surged as a reliable and scalable way to obtain high quality graphene with a large and smooth area, high transmittance and electrical conductivity. For example, Zhou and co-workers explored the implementation of large-area, smooth, few-layer graphene films obtained by CVD as the transparent electrodes in flexible OPVs. The prepared CVD graphene film was continuous with a minimal surface roughness of ∼0.9 nm and a Rs value down to 230 Ω per square at 72% transparency. Such a CVD graphene-based OPV device showed a relatively high PCE of 1.18%, which was comparable with the ITO-based OPV device (PCE of 1.27%). Also, the CVD graphene-based flexible OPV device demonstrated an outstanding capability to operate under bending conditions up to 138°, whereas the ITO-based devices displayed cracks and irreversible failure under bending of 60°.

As is known, the key challenge for graphene to replace ITO as the transparent electrode is the high sheet resistivity, leading to a decrease in the short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), and consequently the low PCE of the OPVs. In principle, the sheet resistance of graphene is given by Rs = (σ2DN)−1, where σ2D is the 2D sheet conductivity and N is the number of layers. Stimulated by the theoretical prediction, many efforts have been made on reducing the Rs of the graphene films by stacking of multiple graphene layers (increasing N) and chemical doping (increasing σ2D by increasing the carrier concentration). For example, Choi et al. reported the fabrication of the organic solar cells on the CVD-grown multilayer graphene (MLG) films. The MLG film showed a relatively low Rs value of 374 Ω per square at 84.2% transparency, and the MLG film-based OPV device exhibited a PCE of 1.17%. As for the graphene doping, different species have been used as dopants for increasing carrier concentration in graphene, such as Au, acid, and organic molecules. For example, Kong and co-workers reported the doping of graphene with AuCl3. The introduction of AuCl3 dopants could improve the compatibility between the hydrophobic graphene electrodes and the hydrophilic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) hole transporting layers, thus leading to an enhanced efficiency of the graphene-based OPV device, which was comparable with the ITO-based OPVs. Wang et al. reported the acid (HCl and HNO3) doped multi-layer stacked graphene as the transparent electrode for OPVs. The doped four-layer graphene film exhibited a Rs of ∼80 Ω per square and a transmittance of ∼90% at 550 nm, and the constructed graphene-based solar cell showed a PCE of 2.5%, which was 80% of the PCE of ITO-based solar cell. Despite the high efficiency of the acid doped graphene, it suffered in long term stability. This can be ascribed to the fact that the acid dopants were easily eliminated by heating or electrical stress, causing reliability issues in electronic applications. Moreover, the possible acid diffusion from acid-doped graphene to organic layers could also degrade the device performance. Organic molecules have been also used for the doping of graphene. Li and co-workers reported the use of layer-by-layer graphene–tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) stacked films as the transparent electrode for OPVs. The TCNQ molecules were thermally evaporated onto the surface of graphene sheets, and embedded between two graphene layers. As a p-doping agent, the inclusion of TCNQ significantly increased the hole concentration in the graphene layers, leading to a decrease of Rs and an enhanced PCE of 2.58% for flexible OPVs. Besides the small organic molecules, ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) were also reported as p-doping agents for graphene. It is important to note that the P(VDF-TrFE) polymer is highly stable under ambient atmosphere and essentially transparent (>95%) in the visible range. In this graphene–P(VDF-TrFE) hybrid structure, large-scale graphene was heavily doped up to 3 × 1013 cm−2 by nonvolatile ferroelectric dipoles, yielding a low sheet resistance of 120 Ω per square at ambient conditions.
In addition to the doping strategies, the composites of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been also proven to exhibit notably enhanced electrical conductivity compared to either pristine CNTs or graphene while maintaining their optical transmittance. For example, Yang's group reported the formation of the composites of chemically converted graphene and CNTs (G–CNTs) via a solution based route. After chemical doping with SOCl2, the optimized G–CNTs showed a Rs value of ∼240 Ω per square at 86% transmittance, and the G–CNT based OPV device exhibited a PCE of 0.85%. Later, King et al. developed a water-based route to obtain graphene–CNT composites. The addition of a small amount (3 wt%) of graphene into CNTs could render an increase of the material's conductivity by 40%. Optimized, the graphene–CNTs based composite films displayed a transmittance of 80% coupled with a sheet resistance of 100 Ω per square.

Unlike in traditional inorganic solar cells where free electrons and holes are generated upon irradiation, light absorption in organic solar cells leads to the formation of excitons, or closely bound electron–hole pairs. To separate these closely bound electron–hole pairs, an electron acceptor, whose electron affinity (EA) is larger than that of the donor polymer, but still smaller than its ionization potential (IP), is necessary. At the current stage, the most successful OPVs are based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures with a combination of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron donor–acceptor pair, showing an overall efficiency of 5–6%. However, the fullerene-based PCBM is not necessarily the optimum choice for electron acceptors in view of the relatively low PCE of the OPVs. Accordingly, the replacement of PCBM with its carbon allotropes such as CNTs has been thoroughly investigated. However, the unexpectedly low PCE (<0.5%) was obtained in the OPVs with CNTs as the electron acceptors, which can be attributed to poor solubility and impurities as well as the bundling structures of the CNTs. Graphene, with a mobility as high as 7 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, is considered to be a promising electron acceptor in OPVs. For example, Chen and coworkers reported the application of the solution-processable functionalized graphene (SPFGraphene) material as an electron-acceptor material in the OPVs, with P3OT and P3HT as electron donors. The efficient electron transport from the electron donors to the SPFGraphene was evidenced by significant photoluminescence (PL) quenching. After the annealing treatment, the SPFGraphene-based OPV device showed a PCE of 1.4%, which was comparable to most of the best OPV devices using materials other than fullerenes as electron acceptors. Similarly, Liu et al. mixed the SPFGraphene and functionalized multi-walled CNTs (f-MWCNTs) together in the active layer, and fabricated OPVs with a structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PSS)/P3HT-f-MWCNTs-SPFGraphene/LiF/Al, where SPFGraphene acted as the electron acceptor and also provided the percolation path for electrons, and f-MWCNTs served as an efficient hole transporter. The combination of the two carbon allotropes would facilitate a fast separation of the electron–hole pairs and thus suppress the recombination, achieving a PCE of 1.05%.

In addition, due to their high specific surface area for a large interface, high mobility and tunable band gap, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) exhibit great potential as an electron acceptor material in photovoltaic devices. For example, Gupta et al. synthesized aniline-functionalized GQDs (ANI-GQDs) via a hydrothermal method and explored their applications as electron acceptors in OPVs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ANI-GQDs/LiF/Al). For comparison, the solar cells based on P3HT–ANI-graphene sheets (ANI-GSs) were also fabricated. When 1 wt% GQDs were added, the optimized performance for the ANI-GQDs-based OPVs was achieved with a PCE of 1.14%, better than that of the optimized ANI-GSs-based cells (0.65%). The superior performance suggested that the GQDs could be a promising electron acceptor in OPVs.
As shown in the above examples, however, the performances of the OPVs based on the graphene sheets or GQDs electron acceptors were still inferior to those of the fullerene acceptor-based OPVs. Thus, an intuitive strategy to improve the performance of OPVs can be constituted by using the fullerene–graphene hybrid as an electron acceptor for OPVs. Recently, Yu et al. reported the use of fullerene-grafted graphene hybrids as the electron acceptors in OPVs. The covalent interaction between the mono-substituted C60 and graphene sheets was obtained by a lithiation reaction. As shown in the energy diagram, graphene possessed a work function of −4.5 eV, which was lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (−4.4 eV) of C60 and close to the work function of the Al cathode, indicating graphene could act as an effective electron acceptor between C60 and Al. The device based on C60-grafted graphene:P3HT showed the highest PCE of 1.22%. In comparison, the devices based on C60:P3HT and the C60–graphene mixture:P3HT exhibited much lower PCEs of 0.47% and 0.44%, respectively.

In an OPV device with the BHJ structure, the hole transporting layer (HTL) is deposited on top of the transparent electrode to suppress the carrier recombination and minimize current leakage. An ideal HTL should be composed with a wide band gap p-type semiconductor, which plays the following roles: (1) to adjust the energetic barrier height between the active layer and the transparent electrodes; (2) to form a selective transporting layer for holes, while blocking the electrons; (3) to modify the surface property to alter active layer morphology; (4) to prohibit a chemical or physical reaction between the active layer and electrodes; (5) to act as an optical spacer. Some inorganic oxides, such as V2O5, MoO3 (ref. 132) and NiO, have been employed as the HTL for OPVs, yielding a PCE as high as 3–5%. However, the inorganic oxide-based HTL layers are usually fabricated by using the vacuum deposition technique, which is not only incompatible with the solution processable advantages of OPVs, but also adds to the cost. Thus, the most commonly used HTL in the OPVs is the organic semiconductor PEDOT:PSS. The advantages of PEDOT:PSS reside in the solution based processing, which minimizes the detrimental effect on the roughness of ITO, as well as the alignment of the energy barriers of ITO and the active layer for efficient hole collecting. However, there still remain several shortcomings of PEDOT:PSS, including the high acidity (pH ∼ 1 during the deposition) and consequently the corrosion of the ITO electrode at elevated temperatures, hygroscopic properties, and inhomogeneous electrical properties, resulting in poor long-term stability.

Recently, GO thin films have been reported as an alternative HTL material for high performance OPVs. Compared to PEDOT:PSS, GO can be deposited from neutral aqueous suspensions, avoiding corrosion of the electrode. Moreover, the optical band-gap of GO and the band structures can be chemically or thermally tuned for a better alignment of the work functions of ITO and the active layer. In addition, GO also offers significantly higher transparency than PEDOT:PSS. For example, Li et al. reported the use of the GO thin films deposited in neutral aqueous suspensions as an efficient HTL for OPVs. In the OPV device with the structure of ITO/GO/P3HT:PCBM/Al (Fig. 3(A)), the work function of GO (4.9 eV) matched well with the work function of ITO and the LUMO of P3HT (Fig. 3(B)), facilitating an efficient hole transfer. The optimized PCE for the OPV with 2 nm GO as the HTL was 3.5%, which was highly comparable with its counterpart (PEDOT:PSS, 3.6%) (Fig. 3(C)). Furthermore, the OPVs with GO as the HTL have demonstrated significantly improved long-time stability compared to the PEDOT:PSS devices. Murray et al. reported the employment of GO as the HTL in the OPV devices based on the active layer of the electron donor poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and the fullerene electron acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM). Such GO HTL-based OPVs exhibited PCEs as high as 7.5% while providing a 5× enhancement in thermal aging lifetime and a 20× enhancement in humid ambient lifetime compared to the analogous PEDOT:PSS-based OPV devices.
As reported in Li and co-workers' work, the PCE of the OPV device is highly sensitive to the thickness of the GO HTL thin films (Fig. 3(D)). As the thickness increased from 2 nm to 10 nm, the PCE dropped from 3.5% to 0.9%, due to the insulating property of GO. However, to deposit ultrathin GO films (2 nm or 1 or 2 monolayers) via spin coating is extremely challenging because the resulting films also need to cover fully the underlying surface. Therefore, allowing thicker GO films to be used as the HTL can greatly facilitate the integration of GO into OPVs. For this purpose, Kim et al. studied the composites of GO and single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) as the HTL in OPVs. A small amount of SWCNTs (with a small diameter of ∼1 nm) could significantly improve the vertical conductivity of GO while not notably affecting the surface roughness, allowing the use of thicker and thus easier-to-make GO films as HTL. The GO:SWCNT composite-based devices showed comparable performances to the PEDOT:PSS-based ones. In the absence of SWCNTs, the PCEs of the cells decreased from 3.28 ± 0.14% to 2.36 ± 0.28% when the GO thickness increased from around 1 nm to around 3–4 nm, respectively. However, after adding SWCNTs, the difference between the PCEs of the two types of cells (3.66 ± 0.18% and 3.13 ± 0.11%, respectively) became much smaller. Another way to allow the use of thicker GO films is to reduce them. By means of chemical reduction, the insulating property of GO can be tuned to semimetallic conducting and facilitate a more efficient carrier transport. Yun et al. compared the cell performance of OPVs with GO, rGO, and p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide reduced GO (pr-GO) as the HTLs. The pr-GO devices with a thickness of 2 and 5 nm showed a PCE of 3.63 and 3.53%, respectively, which were comparable to the PEDOT:PSS devices. The long term stability of the pr-GO device was also superior to the PEDOT:PSS counterpart.
More interestingly, by simple charge neutralization of the COOH groups in GO with Cs salts, the charge extraction property of GO could be reversed in BHJ OPVs. The obtained cesium derivative (GO-Cs) could act as an efficient electron extraction material in BHJ, whose work function matched well with the active layer and the cathode. The normal and inverted devices based on GO hole- and GO-Cs electron-extraction layers showed a PCE of 3.67% and 2.97%, respectively, which both outperformed the corresponding standard BHJ solar cells with the state-of-the-art hole- and electron-extraction PEDOT:PSS layers.

In contrast to the traditional inorganic PVs, one of the key limitations of OPVs is the narrow absorption window. One strategy to harvest complementary absorption spectrum is to stack materials with different band gaps together. By connecting two sub-cells in either a serial or parallel fashion, a tandem solar cell can be obtained, which in principle should exhibit double open circuit voltage (Voc) or short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, the progress in tandem organic solar cells, especially in solution-processed ones, has been limited. As a key part in the tandem PVs, the interconnecting layer (also called the intermediate layer) needs to possess high conductivity, minimal light absorption, low surface roughness, dense coverage, and high mechanical and chemical stability. More importantly, the interlayer material needs to have orthogonal processability to maintain the stacking integrity and avoid intermixing between the different layers in the device. Recently, Huang and coworkers reported the GO/PEDOT:PSS gel as a sticky interconnecting layer for a serial tandem OPV. The insulating GO increased the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS by altering its resonating ground states and morphology through strong π–π interaction and hydrogen bonding. The Voc of the tandem cell was 0.94 V, reaching 84% of the sum of the two sub-cells' Voc. The PCE of the final tandem cell was calculated to be 4.14%, which was higher than that of either of the two cells (2.92% and 3.75%, respectively). Tong et al. employed MoO3 modified graphene as the intermediate layer (IML) in both the serial and parallel tandem cells. The coating of MoO3 was performed on the CVD-grown graphene sheets for the modification of the work function, and the intermediate layer formed an ohmic contact with the photoactive layers. Using MoO3-modified graphene IML, a high Voc of 1 V and a high Jsc of 11.6 mA cm−2 could be obtained in series and parallel connection, respectively, in contrast to a Voc of 0.58 V and Jsc of 7.6 mA cm−2 in single PV cell.


Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), also known as Grätzel cells, have attracted increasing scientific and industrial interest due to their relatively high efficiency and low cost. Generally, a DSSC is composed of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film on a transparent conducting electrode (ITO or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)), a counter electrode and an electrolyte usually containing an I−/I3− redox couple. Upon irradiation, the dyes (also known as the sensitizers) are excited, followed by ultrafast electron-injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor film. The dye molecule is then regenerated by I−, which is oxidized to I3− and then restored at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface. Though a high PCE of ∼12% has been reported, there still remain several challenges for DSSCs, including the suppression of the charge recombination, the high cost of the Pt-based counter electrode, and so forth. Graphene-based materials have been explored to act as different components in DSSCs including transparent electrodes, counter electrode materials and electron acceptors as well as light absorbers, showing a great potential in the fabrication of cost-effective DSSCs with promising performance.


As discussed above, graphene fulfils all the criteria for a promising alternative to ITO or FTO transparent electrodes. Wang et al. revealed the possibility of using graphene as the transparent electrode in DSSCs. In their work, an aqueous solution of GO was dip-coated on the substrate, followed by subsequent thermal reduction. The obtained graphene thin film showed a high conductivity of 550 S cm−1 and a transparency of more than 70% over the 1000–3000 nm range. Based on this transparent electrode, the solid state DSSC device (graphene/TiO2/dye/spiro-OMeTAD/Au device (spiro-OMeTAD = 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenilamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)) exhibited a PCE of 0.26%, which was lower than that of the comparable FTO-based device (0.84%).


In DSSCs, the counter electrode is an indispensable part, which injects electrons into the electrolyte and restores the redox couple (from I3− to I−). The counter electrode can dictate the cathodic activity and affect the performance of the photoanode through the regeneration of dyes. For an ideal counter electrode, the commonly referenced performance targets for its RCT (charge transfer resistance) are less than 10 Ω cm2, and 2–3 Ω cm2. A conventional counter electrode is the Pt-deposited on ITO or FTO electrode, which possesses high catalytic activity and outstanding conductivity, as well as stability towards the I3−/I− redox couple. However, due to the scarcity of Pt and the issues during the fabrication of Pt/transparent conducting electrodes (high cost in the magnetron sputtering and the weak adhesion of Pt onto the ITO/FTO in the thermal decomposition), inexpensive and abundant materials such as graphene have been intensively studied as alternative counter electrode materials in DSSCs.

Lee et al. reported the CVD-grown 3D nano-foam of graphene layers (3D-NFG) as a counter electrode for DSSCs. The 3D-NFG-based DSSC showed a Jsc of 12.1 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.7 V, which were similar to the Pt counter electrode-based DSSC. However, the FF and overall efficiency of the 3D-NFG DSSC was slightly lower (FF: 60% versus 69.2%; PCE: 5.2% versus 5.7%), which could be ascribed to the ∼10 times higher Rct of the 3D-NFG counter electrode compared to its Pt counterpart. Aksay and coworkers also investigated graphene sheets as the counter electrode in DSSCs. The graphene-based cell performed comparably to the Pt-based cell (conversion efficiencies of 5.0 and 5.5%, respectively, at 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated light).
A unique advantage of graphene over the conventional Pt counter electrode is its superior catalytic activities towards other redox couples. Despite the merits of the commonly used I3−/I− redox mediator, its redox potential is too low (ca. 0.35 V vs. SHE) to achieve the optimum voltage of the DSSC system and, consequently, the best power conversion efficiency. Moreover, the triiodide itself absorbs light, reducing the efficiency of the device. Accordingly, other mediators based on cobalt, sulfur, and iron compounds have been explored, among which a Co(bpy)33+/Co(bpy)32+ redox shuttle in conjunction with an optimized combination of dyes demonstrated a recording PCE of 12.3%. For such redox mediators, Pt is not necessarily the optimum choice as the counter electrode material. In contrast to the excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of triiodide, Pt shows less efficient performance with Co mediators, and much worse with sulfur-based mediator systems. Kavan et al. revealed that graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) (1–15 nm thick stacks of graphene) could outperform platinum for the reduction of the cobalt mediator. The use of GNPs instead of graphene sheets was due to a larger number of active edges sites for the catalysis. When using the GNPs deposited on FTO glass as the counter electrode for the catalysis of Co(bpy)33+/Co(bpy)32+ redox couple, the optimized GNPs-based DSSCs could achieve the highest efficiency of 9.6%, which was superior to the Pt-based DSSCs. The chemical stability of the GNPs–FTO counter electrode was also proven to be much higher than that of the conventional Pt–FTO. Similarly, Aksay and co-workers explored a few layers of functionalized graphene sheets (FGSs) and a sacrificial binder of ethyl cellulose for catalytic performance in DSSCs. These FGSs-based counter electrodes exhibited lower effective charge transfer resistance (<1 Ω cm2) than the thermally decomposed chloroplatinic acid electrodes traditionally used. DSSCs using these FGS electrodes had efficiencies (η) equal to or higher than those using thermally decomposed chloroplatinic acid electrodes in each of the three major redox mediators (i.e., iodide, cobalt and sulfur complexes).
A shortcoming for graphene as the counter electrode is the relative inert basal plane, which limits the interaction between graphene and the electrolyte, and consequently the redox reactions only occur at the edges. Therefore, the modification of graphene with F-doping or polymers has been explored with a view to an improved performance. For example, Das et al. reported the fabrication of large-area fluorinated graphene by using CF4 reactive ion plasma treatment, and its electrocatalytic properties for iodine reduction in DSSCs. The introduction of F− induced more active sits, and thus enhanced the interfacial electron transfer at the graphene–electrolyte interfaces, leading to an improved efficiency. Shi and coworkers revealed the feasibility of the polymer modified graphene (PEDOT-PSS–graphene) electrode as the counter electrode in DSSCs. The PEDOT-PSS–graphene-based counter electrode exhibited high transmittance (>80%) at visible wavelengths and high electrocatalytic activity. With the PEDOT-PSS–graphene-based counter electrode, the energy conversion efficiency of the cell reached 4.5%, which was comparable to 6.3% of the cell with a platinum counter electrode. Very recently, other polymers, such as PEDOT and polyaniline (PANI), have been also reported for the hybridization of graphene. The hybrid film used as counter electrode in DSSCs could exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the I3−/I− redox mediator, comparable to the Pt counterpart. In addition to the doping or polymer modification, the introduction of Pt or MWCNTs can also increase the catalytic activity of graphene. In the former case, the Pt–graphene composite was fabricated by electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly (ELSA) based on poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), and a comparable efficiency (7.66%) to a sputtered Pt counter electrode (8.16%) was achieved. In the latter case, the addition of MWCNTs provided many sharp edges as the catalytic sites and lowered the resistance of graphene, which in turn led to a reasonable PCE of 7.55%.
Recently, there was a report on the use of graphene nanoribbons as the counter electrode and its highly reversible photobleaching for the I3−/I− redox couple. The unique effect has never been reported for other nanocarbons, even other forms of graphene. Photobleaching and the resultant decrease of electrolyte absorption significantly improved the performance of the inverted configuration. Hence, this photobleaching effect provided by few-layer graphene nanoribbons can be used advantageously for structurally inverted dye solar cells and tandem solar cells.

Although a ∼12% PCE has been achieved in DSSCs, a hurdle for the further enhancement in PCE is the transport of photogenerated electrons across the network of TiO2 nanoparticles, which competes with charge recombination. To suppress the charge recombination, several strategies, such as the fabrication of a semiconductor heterostructure and the introduction of 1D transporting materials (e.g. CNTs), have been adopted. Compared to the 1D CNTs and the point contact between TiO2 and CNTs, 2D graphene sheets have been reported to benefit the charge separation due to their excellent conductivity and good contact with TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 4). More importantly, the work function of graphene is in the range of 4.42–4.5 eV, which is much lower than the CB of TiO2, which in turn facilitates an effective charge injection from the semiconductor to graphene. In addition, the higher light scattering contributes to the efficient charge separation to a certain extent. Tang et al. reported large area graphene nanosheets (GS)–TiO2 on ITO as the photoanode in DSSC. The GS–TiO2 exhibited much higher conductivity compared to the bare TiO2 film, since the GS could provide the pathways for the photogenerated electrons. The cell based on the GS–TiO2 film gave a Jsc of 6.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.56 V, and a FF of 0.45, yielding a PCE of 1.68%. In comparison, the cell based on the bare TiO2 film showed corresponding values of 1.95 mA cm−2, 0.52 V, 0.31, and 0.32%, respectively. The increased Jsc and FF were mainly attributed to the enhanced electron transport. Another report by Hayashi et al. investigated the electron transfer cascade by organic–inorganic ternary composites of porphyrin (ZnP), zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONP), and rGO on a tin oxide electrode. It was suggested that the role of the rGO could reside in two aspects: (i) accepting electrons from the ZnONP–ZnP composites; and (ii) providing a medium to store and shuttle electrons within the composite film.


Li and co-workers successfully synthesized GQDs with a uniform and tunable size via solution chemistry. GQDs consisted of graphene moieties containing 168, 132, and 170 conjugated carbon atoms, respectively. By enclosing the graphene dots in three dimensions with covalently attached multiple 1,3,5-trialkyl-substituted phenyl moieties, they could be highly soluble in various common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene, with a solubility up to 30 mg mL−1 at room temperature. The GQDs (∼5 nm in diameter) showed maximum absorbance at 591 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 1.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1, nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the metal-complex-based dyes commonly used in dye-sensitized solar cells. To explore the feasibility of the use of GQDs as the dyes in DSSCs, TiO2 DSSCs were fabricated with GQDs replacing the conventional Ru-complex-based dyes. The measured Voc (0.48 V) and FF (0.58) were comparable to those of cells with ruthenium complexes, while the measured Jsc was more than one order of magnitude lower (200 μA cm−2). The extremely low Jsc could be ascribed to the low affinity of GQDs with the oxide surfaces as a result of physical adsorption, as well as the consequent poor charge injection.


In principle, the quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) adopt a similar design to the DSSCs, except for the replacing of organic dyes by inorganic QDs, such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, InAs, etc. Compared to the organic dyes, the QDs have the advantages of high extinction coefficients, tunable band gaps, large intrinsic dipole moments, and good stability, all known to increase the overall PCE of solar cells. A more alluring feature for QDSSCs is the multiple electron generation and hot electron utilization, boosting the theoretical PCE (44%) beyond the 32% Shockley–Queisser limit in silicon-based solar cells. However, the practical performance (3–4%) still lags behind that of DSSCs at present. The low PCE can be ascribed to limitations, such as charge recombination at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface and the poor redox activity of the counter electrode. To overcome these challenges, graphene-based materials have been incorporated into the QDSSCs and played a crucial role as the counter electrode materials or the electron transporters.


Unlike in the case of DSSCs, the redox couple commonly used in QDSSCs is the polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−), since it is beneficial to the stability of the QDs photoanode. Under this circumstance, the application of Pt as the counter electrode material is problematic due to the chemisorption of the redox couple on the surface of Pt and the induced poisoning effect. To circumvent this, other counter electrode materials such as PbS, CoS, and Cu2S have been developed. However, such chalcogenides also present issues with long term stability, including continual corrosion and disintegration from the electrode.

Kamat and coworkers reported the use of Cu2S–rGO composites as the counter electrode in QDSSCs. The high surface area of the 2D rGO sheets facilitated the spread of the Cu2S reactive sites across the surface. Furthermore, the rGO also served to shuttle electrons across the 2D mat to the Cu2S catalyst sites where the electrons were used to reduce the oxidized polysulfide. With a poly(vinylidene) fluoride (PVDF) binder, the cast Cu2S–rGO film-based QDSSC exhibited a Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.52 V, and a FF of 0.43, yielding a unsurpassed PCE of 4.4%. In comparison, the Cu2S–rGO film without a binder and the Pt film-based cells showed a PCE of 2.5% and 1.6%, respectively. The authors suggested the PCE could be further enhanced over the 5% limit by tackling other issues such as charge recombination processes at the photoanode–electrolyte interface. Another work by Zhu et al. revealed the possibility of using a reduced graphene–Au (RG–Au) composite as the counter electrode in QDSSCs. The RG–Au composite was prepared by one-step microwave-assisted reduction of chloroaurate in alkaline solution with graphite oxide dispersion. The cell with a RG–Au counter electrode showed a PCE of 1.36%, which was higher than those of cells employing conventional Pt, Au, or RG counter electrodes.

A key challenge in achieving higher PCE in QDSSCs is efficient electron–hole pair disassociation and electron collection. More specifically, to arrive at the current collecting electrode (photoanode), the photogenerated electrons must complete a great number of hopping events without undergoing recombination or trapped-state termination. However, the existence of surface state in QDs can capture photoinduced electrons and lead to recombination of carriers. Moreover, if the surface state is located below the conduction band of the photoanode material, injection of photoinduced electrons into photoanode will be inhibited. To circumvent these problems, conducting materials, especially carbonaceous materials, are used to assist the transport and collection of the photogenerated electrons in QDSSCs. The 2D graphene with a unique sheet morphology and excellent electron conductivity has been investigated as a promising scaffold for more-effective charge separation and transport in QDSSCs. For example, our group reported the application of QDs-sensitized graphene in light harvesting and energy conversion. The chemically reduced graphene sheets were first functionalized with pyrenebutyrate (PB), which served as a linker in the following deposition of QDs. Then, Cd2+ and S2− ions were sequentially added, resulting in the formation of CdS QDs (3–5 nm) on the surface of the graphene (Fig. 5(A)). The CdS sensitized graphene film showed an extended light absorption range as well as a reduced charge transfer resistance (Fig. 5(C) and (D)), thus leading to a better performance as a photoelectrode. Compared to the CdS film, the CdS sensitized graphene film exhibited a 140% higher incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 5(B)). Similarly, Lin et al. reported the synthesis of linker-free CdSe–rGO composites via in situ growth of CdS on rGO. Due to the efficient transfer of the photoinduced electrons from CdSe NPs to rGO, the CdSe–rGO composites showed a drastically increased photoresponse in comparison with CdSe, rGO and physically mixed CdSe and rGO.

Besides the excellent electrically conductivity, another important advantage for graphene as an electron acceptor and transporter is its proper work function (4.42–4.5 eV), which is much lower than the CB of the commonly used metal oxide photoanode materials such as TiO2, ZnO, and so forth. Accordingly, more effective electron injections are expected to occur into graphene than directly into the photoanodes. Sun et al. reported the assembly of CdSe on the surface of graphene sheets and the application of the composite in the QDSSCs. The QDSSC with the graphene–CdSe composite showed a significantly higher PCE (0.76%) compared to graphene (0.009%) or CdSe (0.016%) based cells. Moreover, the optimal PCE was also notably greater than the efficiency (<0.1%) of C60 or CNTs related cells. The improved efficiency could be assigned to two effects. On the one hand, work function of graphene is lower than the CB of QDs CdSe (Fig. 6(A)). This energetic alignment favours the electron transfer from photoexcited CdSe to graphene. On the other hand, the high electron mobility of graphene facilitates the fast transport of the electrons. For a further improvement in the charge separation and electron transport, Au or other metals can be introduced into the graphene–QD based systems and serve as the electron sink. Narayanan et al. fabricated a quaternary composite of TiO2/CdSe/ionic liquid functionalized GO (FGO)/Au for enhanced solar cell performance. The role of each component could be described as follows: CdSe as the exciton generator; Au nanoparticles as an electron sink; FGO for storage and shuttling of electrons; and TiO2 as the robust support. In addition, the band alignment of these components could facilitate an effective electron transport and electron collection on the electrode. Accordingly, the quaternary composite-based solar cell showed superior performance compared to the individual/binary/ternary component cells. More recently, Lightcap et al. investigated quantitatively the relative rates of the electron and energy transfer from QDs to the GO or rGO by comparing the photoluminescence lifetime characteristics. As shown in Fig. 6(B) and (C), the incorporated graphene sheets in QD films could provide pathways for effective electron transfer, and contribute to the enhanced photoresponse.

Silicon (Si) represents the state of the art material in the solar cell industry due to its broad absorption range and well-developed processing techniques. However, Si-based solar cells suffer from a high material cost as well as elaborate processing conditions. To replace partially Si and thus reduce the cost of the overall solar cell, graphene has been integrated with Si to form a Schottky junction and efficient solar cells. For example, Li et al. reported the first example of the graphene-on-silicon Schottky junction solar cell. In their report, the CVD grown graphene nanosheets could be conformally coated on the Si with 100% coverage, and form a Schottky junction with a relatively large built-in field (0.55–0.75 V), which favored the carrier separation. Additionally, the graphene sheet could also serve as a semitransparent electrode and an anti-reflection coating, leading to a reduced reflection by ∼70% in the visible region and ∼80% in the near-IR region. Under AM 1.5 conditions, a Voc of 0.42–0.48 V, a Jsc of 4.0–6.5 mA cm−2, and an average PCE of about 1.5% was achieved. Apparently, the efficiency was far lower than those of the pure Si based devices. The authors suggested that the efficiency could be enhanced with an improved understanding of the electronic coupling, surface passivation, doping, and junction formation, etc.

Since then, several strategies have been proposed to improve the efficiency of the graphene–Si Schottky solar cells. The first strategy is to use the newly Si substrate materials. For example, to improve the efficiency of the graphene–Si Schottky solar cells, the silicon-pillar-array (SPA) was adopted instead of planar Si. The SPA was fabricated using photolithography followed by a dry etching process. The geometry of SPA lead to a drastically suppressed reflectance and enhanced light harvesting. A typical graphene–SPA device exhibited a Voc of 0.465 V, a Jsc of 15.19 mA cm−2, and a PCE of ∼2.90%. Similarly, an Si nanowire array prepared by chemical etching or the CVD method was also adopted to enhance the light harvesting, and the assembled devices demonstrated higher efficiency than the planar Si based counterparts.
Moreover, the performance of the graphene–Si solar cells can be improved by p-doping of the graphene. Such a p-type doping would increase the work function of graphene, leading to an increase in not only the conductivity but also the built-in field at the interface. Thus, the p-graphene–n-Si based devices could show superior overall performance compared to the pristine assemblies. So far, various doping methods have been adopted. HNO3, AuCl3 or SOCl2 was used as the p-dopant, and the resultant p-graphene–n-Si heterojunction based devices exhibited improved PCE compared to the undoped counterparts. In addition, B has also been reported as an effective p-dopant for the graphene–Si solar cells. A Voc of 0.53 V, a Jsc of 18.8 mA cm−2, and a PCE of 2.3% was measured in an unoptimized cell, where both the Voc and Jsc were higher than the pristine graphene-based assemblies. Further surface treatment with HNO3 fumes increased the work function of graphene and the conductivity of the device, resulting in an enhanced performance with a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 21.0 mA cm−2, and a PCE of 3.4%. Very recently, a surprisingly high PCE (8.6%) was achieved in the p-doped graphene–n-Si based solar cell devices. The p-doping was realized by spin-casting a layer of bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide (TFSA) on the pristine graphene–n-Si layer. Upon doping with TFSA, the Voc, Jsc, and FF all increased from 0.43 to 0.54 V, 14.2 to 25.3 mA cm−2, and 0.32 to 0.63, respectively. As a result, the PCE was boosted from 1.9% to 8.6%, which is the highest record for the graphene–Si-based solar cells to date.

The QD thin film based solar cell is the leading technology for next generation energy products. Compared to Si, the QDs solar cells possess the potential to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit (PCE ∼ 32%) for Si solar cells and achieving size-tunable optical absorption and efficient multiple carrier generation. The main challenge to achieve high performance in QDs solar cells is the efficient separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes, and the effective collection of the charges at the electrodes. One strategy to circumvent this is to introduce nanomaterials with a suitable energy band as efficient acceptors. Specifically, carbon materials including fullerenes and SWCNTs have been used in QDs solar cells as efficient electron acceptors. However, even the highest IPCE reported in these systems (∼5%) is still too far away from the requirements of commercialization.

Recently, graphene has been reported as an efficient electron acceptor for QDs solar cells. For example, Li and co-workers developed the layered graphene–CdS QDs for high efficiency solar cells. Graphene sheets offered several advantages compared to other carbon materials such as CNTs. First, the 2D planar geometry of graphene facilitated a uniform distribution of the CdS quantum dots on the surface, maximizing the light absorption and the charge collection. Second, graphene showed a better energy match with CdS compared to the CNTs, leading to a more efficient transport of the electrons at the interfaces. Accordingly, the ITO/graphene/CdS QDs bilayer exhibited an IPCE of 5%, which was much superior to that of the ITO/SWCNTs/CdS QDs. Furthermore, by repeating the assembly of the graphene–CdS QDs layers, the increase in light absorption as well as the decrease in the charge recombination losses could be accomplished simultaneously. The optimized graphene–CdS QDs multilayer nanoassemblies showed an IPCE of up to 16%, which was drastically higher than those of other carbon materials/QDs based solar cells.
In addition, graphene sheets with both high transparency and electrical conductivity can serve as the front electrode in the QDs solar cells. For example, Bi and co-workers reported the replacement of ITO by ambient pressure CVD (APCVD) grown graphene films in CdTe solar cells. The graphene films exhibited an extremely high carrier mobility (up to 600 cm2 V−1 s−1) with a sheet resistance and optical transmittance in the range from 1150 Ω per square and 97.1% to 220 Ω per square and 83.7%, respectively. The resultant device exhibited an encouraging PCE of 4.17%, as well as a much lower cost in comparison with the solar cells with ITO as the front electrode. On the other hand, pristine and doped graphene can also serve as the back electrode material, which is crucial for the stability and overall performance of the QDs solar cells. For example, Lin et al. compared the performance of CdTe solar cells with pristine APCVD grown graphene (PG), boron doped graphene (BG), and chemically reduced GO (rGO) as the back electrodes. The PCE increased from 6.50% for rGO to 7.41% for PG due to the lower resistivity of PG. Upon doping with B, the impedance was further decreased with an increased work function, allowing BG to serve as an ohmic back contact for CdTe. Thus, a PCE ∼ 7.86% was achieved in the CdTe solar cells with BG as the back electrode. Later, the same group developed a composite of Cu nanowires and graphene as the back contact for CdTe solar cells. The PCE was up to 12.1%, which was superior to the traditional back contacts using Cu particle-doped graphite (PCE 10.5%) and Cu thin films (PCE 9.1%).

The photocatalytic decomposition (also known as photodegradation) of the organic pollutants has been considered as an energy-effective pathway for environmental remediation. The photodegradation process is mainly achieved by the oxidation of organic pollutants by photogenerated radicals (e.g. ˙OH, ˙O2−) from semiconductor photocatalysts. Among all the photocatalysts used in photodegradation, TiO2 is considered as the dominant photocatalyst due to its high oxidation power, low cost and long term stability. However, a large band-gap (3.2 eV) of anatase TiO2 restricts its use only to the narrow light-responding range of ultra-violet (<5% of sunlight). In addition, the carrier recombination in TiO2 should also be suppressed for a higher efficiency. Graphene nanosheets have been incorporated with TiO2 to form composite catalysts, which exhibit significantly enhanced activities in the photodegradation of the organic pollutants.

Our group reported the photodegradation of organic compounds (methylene blue (MB)) using TiO2 (commercial P25, Degussa)–graphene (P25–GR) nanocomposites for the first time. P25–graphene (P25–GR) nanocomposites were obtained via a facile, one-step hydrothermal method using P25 and GO as the starting materials. Compared to the bare P25 catalyst, the P25–GR composite exhibited three advantages. First, the π–π stacking between MB and the aromatic regions of graphene enhanced the adsorptivity of the dyes on the surface of the catalysts (Fig. 7(A)), leading to a synergetic effect between adsorptivity and photoreactivity. Second, the introduction of graphene extended the light responding range of P25 by 30–40 nm (Fig. 7(B)), facilitating a more efficient visible light driven photocatalysis. The red shift could be attributed to the formation of the Ti–O–C bonds during the preparation. Last but not least, P25–graphene showed a decrease in the solid state interface layer resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the surface compared to bare P25, according to the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Fig. 7(C)). Thus, P25–GR nanocomposites demonstrated significant advancement over bare P25 in the photodegradation of MB dye under both UV and visible light irradiation (Fig. 7(D) and (E)). In view of the high efficiency achieved in the P25–graphene catalyst, many efforts have been devoted to the growth of TiO2 nanostructures on graphene through in situ or one-pot routes. In most studies, TiO2 nanostructures were fabricated on graphene via: the hydrolysis of various Ti precursors including TiF4, titanium(IV) ammonium oxalate and TiCl4 on graphene; the solvothermal process; or the two step method (hydrolysis of a Ti precursor, e.g. Ti(BuO)4, in the presence of GO, followed by the solvothermal reaction). Moreover, Kamat et al. and Ng et al. developed the fabrication of TiO2–graphene composites by carrying out UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction of graphite oxide using TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, other methods, such as the microwave-assisted synthesis and the redox reaction between Ti3+ and GO, can be also adopted to form the TiO2–graphene composites. All of the obtained TiO2–graphene nanocomposites exhibited superior performance in the photodegradation compared to pure TiO2. The improvement in the photocatalytic activities can be attributed to the enhanced adsorptivity of dyes, extended photo-response range, and enhanced charge separation and transportation properties, as mentioned above. Despite the success with the TiO2–graphene photocatalysts, there still remain several challenges, such as the exploration of a decent visible light photocatalytic activity, and a further suppression of the charge recombination. To circumvent these, several strategies including tuning the crystal facets of TiO2, morphology control of the composites, as well as coupling of TiO2–graphene with other materials have been attempted.
Theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that the photocatalytic reactivity of TiO2 {001} or {100} facets, is much higher than that of the thermodynamically stable {101} facets. The higher reactivity can be attributed to the higher surface energy (0.90 J m−2 for {001} > 0.53 J m−2 for {100} > 0.44 J m−2 for {101}). Therefore, the combination of {001} or {100} dominant TiO2 crystals with graphene can lead to an improved photocatalytic reactivity. Recently, Wang et al. and Liu et al. reported the hydrothermal synthesis of {001} dominant TiO2–graphene composites, respectively. During the synthesis process, the introduction of F− played a crucial role in the controlled growth of the facets. As expected, the {001} facets-exposed TiO2–graphene nanocomposites demonstrated a significant advancement over bare P25 or the normal TiO2–graphene nanocomposites in the photodegradation of MB or methyl orange under both UV and visible light irradiation.
The morphology control can also be adopted to enhance the photocatalytic activities. Cheng and co-workers reported a simple template-free self-assembly of uniform mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres on graphene sheets. The resultant mesoporous TiO2–graphene compounds showed a comparable activity in the photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) with the benchmark P25 catalyst. Du et al. fabricated a hierarchically ordered macro-mesoporous TiO2–graphene composite film using a polystyrene template. The mesopores in TiO2 provided a photocatalytic platform with a large surface area, while the incorporation of interconnected macropores in mesoporous films could improve the mass transport through the film, reduce the length of the mesopore channel, and increase the accessible surface area of the thin film. In addition, the integrated graphene served as an effective electron acceptor and suppressed the charge recombination. Thus, the obtained macro-mesoporous TiO2–graphene nanocomposites demonstrated better performance in the degradation of MB than the sole mesoporous TiO2 as well as the mesoporous TiO2–graphene without the macropores. One dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructure–graphene composites have been also fabricated for enhanced photocatalytic activities. Compared to the spherical nanoparticles, 1D TiO2 materials possess excellent mobility of charge carriers, high surface areas, more light scattering at the red part of the solar spectrum, and enhanced charge collection and transport, which are favorable for the photocatalytic process. Liu et al. and Zhu et al. reported the fabrication of rice-shaped TiO2 rod–graphene and TiO2 nanotube array–graphene composites for photocatalytic application, respectively. Compared to unmodified TiO2 nanomaterials, both of the systems showed greatly enhanced photocatalytic activities in the photodegradation of organic dyes, indicating the possibility for the application of well-designed low dimensional TiO2–graphene catalysts in the photodegradation of pollutants. In addition, Lee et al. reported the synthesis of graphene-wrapped TiO2 nanoparticles as a novel photocatalyst for the photodegradation of organic dyes under visible light. In this work, GO sheets were self-assembled on the surface of the amine-modified TiO2 nanoparticles, and the reduction of GO and the crystallization of TiO2 were simultaneously achieved during the subsequent hydrothermal treatment. It was revealed that the wrapping of graphene significantly reduced the band gap of TiO2 (3.27 to 2.80 eV), while the band gap of the TiO2–graphene sheet composite was 3.19 eV. As a result, the graphene-wrapped TiO2 exhibited a photodegradation rate constant of 3.4 × 10−2 min−1 in the photodegradation of MB under visible light, which was much higher than that of bare anatase TiO2 NPs, graphene–TiO2 NPs (obtained via the two-step hydrothermal method), and P25 NPs.
To harness the visible light in the solar spectrum, TiO2–graphene composites have been coupled with various visible light reactive species. For instance, Wen et al. reported the incorporation of Ag in the TiO2–graphene composite. The plasmonic absorption of Ag under visible light and the subsequent electron transfer to TiO2–graphene provided the visible light photocatalytic activity for the catalyst, and the Schottky junction between TiO2 and Ag nanoparticles and the high electron mobility of graphene sheets facilitated an efficient charge separation. Thus, the photodegradation of MB in the presence of Ag/TiO2/graphene catalysts under visible light was superior to those with bare P25, graphene or TiO2–graphene. In addition, the upconversion (UC) nanocrystals (such as YF3:Yb3+, Tm3+) were also introduced into the TiO2–graphene nanocomposites for an advanced sunlight-activated photocatalyst. Under sunlight irradiation, the UC materials could absorb the near IR light and emit UV light, and the TiO2 nanocrystals could absorb the UV light either directly from the sunlight, or from the secondary energy transfer from UC nanocrystals, to form the electron–hole pairs. The graphene sheets within this novel ternary nanocomposite could serve as the electron acceptor and transporter, improve the adsorptivity of dyes on the catalysts' surface, as well as extending the light-responding range to violet–blue. Under simulated solar light and near IR light, the resultant UC/TiO2/graphene catalysts showed significantly improved efficiency in the degradation of MB compared to P25, UC–P25 and P25–graphene catalysts. Furthermore, GO and GQDs can be also coupled with TiO2 to act as the sensitizer in the visible light photodegradation of organic dyes. As is known, GO has been demonstrated to be either a p- or n-type semiconductor by tuning the degree of oxidation and the species of the oxygen containing groups. Chen et al. reported the synthesis of visible-light responsive GO–TiO2 nanocomposites with p–n heterojunction via a solution-based process. It was found that either a p-type or n-type semiconductor was formed by GO in GO–TiO2 nanocomposites, dependent on the concentration of GO in the starting solution. These GO semiconductors, possessing a band gap smaller than 2.43 eV, could be excited by visible light with wavelengths longer than 510 nm and acted as sensitizers in GO–TiO2 composites for visible light driven photodegradation of methyl orange. Compared to commercial P25 and sole TiO2 nanoparticles, the GO–TiO2 nanocomposites showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances under visible-light irradiation. Another interesting work reported by Zhuo et al. revealed the use of GQDs as the sensitizer in the complex photocatalysts (rutile TiO2–GQD and anatase TiO2–GQD systems), which were designed to harness the visible spectrum of sunlight for the photodegradation process. Under visible light irradiation, GQDs in the TiO2–GQD composites were excited to produce photoluminescence (PL), and the energy was then transferred to TiO2 to generate electron–hole pairs, which were subsequently involved in the photodegradation process. Because the energy of the PL (3.05 eV) emitted from GQDs was larger than the band gap of rutile TiO2 (3.0 eV, 414 nm) but smaller than that of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV, 388 nm), the photocatalytic rate of the rutile TiO2–GQD complex system (0.0576 min−1) was ca. 9 times larger than that of the anatase TiO2–GQD complex (0.0063 min−1) under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation in the degradation of MB.
Besides the photodegradation of the aforementioned organic dyes, TiO2–graphene based photocatalysts can also conduct the decomposition of other water contaminants from agricultural and industrial products, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, phenol,p-nitrophenol, and 2-propanol,etc. For example, Ng et al. reported the photodegradation of 2,4-D by rGO–TiO2 thin films, which exhibited a 4-fold increase in the rate of degradation compared to the bare TiO2 based films. The enhancement was attributed to two aspects. First, the incorporation of graphene to TiO2 could ensure the rapid transport of the carriers and suppress the recombination. Second, the interaction between graphene and the pollutants could concentrate the organics near the surface of the catalysts and accelerate the photodegradation. Another report by Jiang et al. investigated the photodegradation of phenol by solvothermal-synthesized TiO2–graphene composites under UV or visible light. In both cases, the composite catalysts showed enhanced efficiency compared to the commercial P25 due to the increased charge separation, enhanced absorption intensity and width, and good adsorptivity of pollutants of the TiO2–graphene composites. Moreover, gas phase pollutants such as acetone and aromatic compounds (such as benzene) in the air could also be decomposed reportedly by TiO2–graphene based photocatalysts. In these reports, owing to the effective charge separation, the TiO2–graphene photocatalysts exhibited superior activity to bare TiO2 or commercial P25 TiO2.

Many non-TiO2 based photocatalysts have also been incorporated with graphene, including metal oxides (such as ZnO), magnetic materials (such as Fe3O4, CoFe2O4), metal chalcogenides (such as ZnSe), metallate (such as Bi2WO6), plasmonic materials (such as Ag/Ag halides), and so forth. Similar to the TiO2–graphene photocatalysts, the introduction of graphene to these catalysts can also enhance the adsorptivity of organic pollutants, extend the photoresponding range, and facilitate effective charge separation, thus leading to improved photocatalytic activities. For instance, Luo et al. reported the synthesis of hierarchical hollow ZnO sphere–rGO composites, which showed a 5 times enhancement in the UV-assisted degradation of MB compared to the pure ZnO hollow spheres. In another work, Yoo et al. investigated the photocatalytic performance of a multidimensional heterojunction composed of decorated Ag nanoparticles on ZnO nanorods vertically grown on chemically converted graphene (CCG). It was found that both Ag and graphene could serve as the traps/acceptors for the photogenerated electrons and facilitate an effective charge separation. The degree of photodegradation by Ag/ZnO/CCG was much higher than the sum of photodegradations by Ag/ZnO and ZnO/CCG samples. The in situ growth of the magnetic Fe3O4 or CoFe2O4 on graphene for photocatalysis has also been reported. The existence of graphene in such composites led to an enhanced activity in the visible light driven photodegradation, and the maintained magnetic properties of Fe3O4 or CoFe2O4 facilitated a rapid separation of the catalysts from the aqueous solution. Chen et al. reported the in situ growth of ZnSe on N-doped graphene sheets via a hydrothermal method. It was revealed that the p–n junction could be formed at the interface between ZnSe and N-doped graphene, and the formed p–n junction could promote the charge collection and separation at the interfaces. Accordingly, the composites showed drastically enhanced visible light driven photodegradation activities compared to P25 or bare ZnSe nanoparticles. As a representative of the Bi(III)-based photocatalysts, Bi2WO6 has shown promising properties in the visible light photodegradation of organic pollutants. The electronic interaction and charge equilibration between graphene and Bi2WO6 led to the shift of the Fermi level and decreased the conduction band potential. Such a band alignment promoted the migration of the photoinduced electrons, contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6–graphene nanocomposites compared to sole Bi2WO6 or graphene catalysts.

Moreover, visible light triggered plasmonic photocatalysts such as Ag/Ag halides (Ag/AgX, X = Cl, Br) and Au have also been coupled with graphene or GO, showing the great potential for alternatives to the traditional UV- or visible light driven photocatalysts. Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of graphene sheet grafted Ag@AgCl composites by a deposition–precipitation method. The composite catalyst showed a 4-fold enhancement in the visible light photodegradation of RhB compared to Ag/AgCl. Similarly, Liu and coworkers reported the fabrication of well-defined GO enwrapped Ag/AgX (X = Br, Cl) nanocomposites via a water/oil system. It was suggested that the hybridization of Ag/AgX with GO nanosheets could lead to a decent adsorptive capacity of Ag/AgX/GO for methyl orange molecules, the smaller size of the Ag/AgX nanoparticles in Ag/AgX/GO, the facile charge transfer, and the suppressed recombination of electron–hole pairs in Ag/AgX/GO. All of these factors contributed to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. In addition, the graphite like carbon nitride (g-C3N4), which was reported as a sustainable and “metal-free” photocatalyst with a band gap of 2.7 eV, was also assembled with GO for the preparation of a novel visible-light-triggered photocatalyst. The presence of a heterojunction between GO and g-C3N4 facilitated the charge separation, thus leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity. As a result, the pseudo-first-order kinetic constants of photocatalytic degradation of RhB and 2,4-dichlorophenol under visible light irradiation with GO/g-C3N4 were 3.80 and 2.08 times as large as those with pristine g-C3N4, respectively.

Production of clean hydrogen fuel from photoinduced water splitting has been considered as one of the most promising solutions to address the increasing demand for energy and associated environmental concerns. A variety of semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported to catalyze hydrogen evolution from water under irradiation. Considering its superior electronic properties and giant 2D structure, graphene can serve as not only a 2D mat for the catalysts, but also an efficient electron acceptor to enhance the photoinduced charge transfer and to inhibit the backward reaction by separating the evolution sites of hydrogen and oxygen.

Among all the semiconductor catalysts for water splitting, TiO2 and CdS have been extensively studied. Since the pioneering work by Honda and Fujishima, TiO2 has been the most widely used photocatalyst because of its high activity, chemical inertness, low cost and nontoxicity. However, it suffers from a limited light absorption range and severe charge recombination. On the other hand, CdS possesses a relatively narrow band gap (2.4 eV), making it effective in absorbing incident visible light, as well as appropriate band positions which are sufficient for the evolution of both hydrogen and oxygen from water. However, the long term stability, toxicity, and the rapid recombination of photoexcited electron and holes limit its practical application. Generally, noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh can be loaded on the surface of TiO2 or CdS as the co-catalyst to improve the charge separation within the catalysts, as well as to provide a redox pathway with low overpotential, leading to significant enhancements in the efficiency of water splitting. Nevertheless, the scarcity and high cost of these noble metals can be an obvious limitation in practical applications, and alternative cocatalysts based on nonprecious materials need to be pursued. Very recently, our group reported the use of graphene sheets as a metal-free cocatalyst in light driven water splitting with TiO2 or CdS (Fig. 8(A)). In the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial electron donors, the CdS-modified graphene catalyst (CdS-mG, 2 wt% graphene) showed a higher activity compared to the CdS–Pt catalyst, and ca. 4 fold enhancement compared to bare CdS (Fig. 8(B)). For the TiO2 (P25)–graphene (P25–G) catalyst obtained via a one step hydrothermal method, the amount of the evolved hydrogen was around 45% and 50% that of P25–Pt under UV-visible and visible light irradiation, respectively (Fig. 8(C) and (D)). In both cases, the role of graphene as a cocatalyst for CdS and TiO2 could be ascribed to the following three aspects. (i) The graphene acted as an electron acceptor and mediator, promoting the separation of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs. (ii) The graphene acted as a support with large surface area, offering more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers. (iii) The graphene itself could catalyze the evolution of hydrogen with the surface carbon atoms as the catalytic centers. Accordingly, the inexpensive, environmentally benign graphene can serve as an alternative cocatalyst for highly efficient hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic splitting of H2O. Shen et al. reported an ionic liquid-assisted one-step hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2–rGO composite, which showed a dramatic improvement in the hydrogen evolution compared to TiO2 catalyst under UV light. In another work, nanocomposites of P25 and rGO which were prepared by several techniques, including UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction, hydrazine reduction, and a hydrothermal method, were studied as photocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen from alcohol solution under UV-vis irradiation. The incorporation of rGO into P25 significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution. This enhancement could be ascribed to the intimate contact between P25 and rGO, which could accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons on P25 to rGO and suppress the recombination of charge carriers, thus increasing the photocatalytic performance. All of these composite catalysts exhibited better photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution than P25 alone, and the P25–rGO composite prepared by the hydrothermal method possessed the best performance (74 μmol h−1, 10-fold higher than P25 alone). In addition to CdS–graphene and TiO2–graphene photocatalysts, other photocatalysts (such as BiVO4 and g-C3N4) combined with graphene have also been reported for efficient H2 evolution from water splitting. Ng et al. reported the incorporation of BiVO4 with rGO to improve its photoresponse in visible light. A remarkable 10-fold enhancement in the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction was observed on the BiVO4–rGO composite compared with pure BiVO4 under visible illumination. This improvement could be attributed to the longer electron lifetime of excited BiVO4, as the electrons were injected to rGO instantly at the site of generation, minimizing the charge recombination. As reported by Xiang et al., graphene and g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were prepared by a combined impregnation–chemical reduction strategy. The resulting graphene–g-C3N4 composites showed an H2 evolution rate 3 times higher than pure g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation due to the efficient charge carrier separation on the photocatalyst.
In addition, graphene derivatives can also be adopted as metal free cocatalysts. Jia et al. studied the photocatalytic H2-production activity of N-doped graphene–CdS nanocomposites from aqueous solutions containing Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents under visible-light irradiation. With a 2 wt% doping of N, the catalyst showed a H2 evolution rate as high as 210 μmol h−1 (5 times higher than that of pure CdS), which was superior to the graphene–CdS and GO–CdS composites. This enhancement could be ascribed to the increased electrical conductivity as well as the change in the density of states by doping. More importantly, the N-graphene–CdS photocatalyst did not show deactivation for H2 evolution for longer than 30 h, indicating that the cocatalyst of N-graphene acted as a protective layer preventing CdS from photocorrosion under light irradiation. Choi and co-workers reported enhanced activity in the water splitting of reduced nanographene oxide (rNGOs)–TiO2 compared to the reduced large graphene oxide (micrometer sized, rLGOs)–TiO2. The advantages of rNGOs over rLGOs could be mainly attributed to the full contact between the rNGO and TiO2, which facilitated the transfer of the photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to rNGO. Besides the aforementioned catalysts with graphene as the metal-free cocatalyst, other inexpensive cocatalyst can be added for a further enhanced H2 evolution. Xiang et al. reported the use of a layered MoS2–graphene (MG) hybrid as the cocatalyst in the photogeneration of hydrogen with TiO2 nanoparticles. In the ternary catalyst system, the photogenerated electrons was transferred from TiO2 to MoS2 nanosheets through the graphene sheets (which acted as a conductive electron transport “highway”) and then reacted with the adsorbed H+ ions at the edges of MoS2 to form H2. The synergetic effect between graphene and MoS2 nanosheets not only suppressed the charge recombination, but also provided more active sites for H2 evolution. As a result, the optimized TiO2–MG catalyst showed a H2 production rate of 165.3 μmol h−1, which was significantly higher than the TiO2–graphene catalyst (29.7 μmol h−1) and bare TiO2 (ca. 4 μmol h−1).
A small amount of Pt has commonly been coupled with the semiconductor catalyst to promote H2 generation. In this scenario, the semiconductor/graphene/Pt catalysts have exhibited significantly improved performance compared to semiconductor/Pt or semiconductor/graphene counterparts. As an example, Li et al. reported the fabrication of CdS-decorated graphene sheet composites as photocatalysts in visible-light-driven water splitting. In the presence of a small amount (0.5 wt%) of Pt, the optimized CdS–graphene showed a H2 production rate of 1.12 mmol h−1 and a quantum efficiency of 22.5%, in comparison with the sole CdS catalyst with a H2 production rate of 0.23 mmol h−1 and a quantum efficiency of 4.6%. The photogenerated electrons from CdS could transfer in one of three following ways: (1) to Pt deposited on the surface of CdS clusters; (2) to carbon atoms on the graphene sheets; (3) to Pt located on the graphene nanosheets, and subsequently participate in the H2 evolution process. In another report, Gao et al. combined GO, CdS and Pt nanoparticles for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The results showed that the GO–CdS–Pt composite containing 0.5 at% Pt exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 123 mL h−1 g−1 (5.5 mmol h−1) with a reliable photostability, which was about 2.5 times higher than that of GO–CdS and 10.3 times higher than that of CdS. The increased photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency could be attributed to the effective charge separation and anti-recombination with the addition of GO and Pt, as well as the low overpotential of Pt for water splitting.
Interestingly GO itself, with an appropriate oxygen level and band structure, can also play a role as the photocatalyst in the evolution of both H2 and O2. Previous studies have proved that GO can be considered as a p-type semiconductor, whose band gap is dependent on the oxygen levels. Teng et al. reported a GO specimen with a band gap of 2.4–4.3 eV as the water splitting catalyst in an aqueous methanol solution or pure water under UV or visible light irradiation. A steady evolution of H2 was observed even in the absence of the Pt cocatalyst. Although the reduction in the band gap of GO occurred during the irradiation, the conduction band edge seemed almost unchanged and remained high enough to supply an overpotential for the H2 generation. The same group also investigated the evolution of O2 with GO as the catalyst. Unlike the stable H2 production, the O2 evolution was negligibly small due to mutual photocatalytic reduction of the GO with upward shift of the valence band edge under illumination. When NaIO3 was used as a sacrificial reagent to suppress the mutual reduction mechanism under illumination, strong O2 evolution was observed over the GO specimens.
The ultimate goal for the light-driven water splitting is the steady and simultaneous evolution of H2 and O2. Iwase et al. reported the application of photoreduced GO (PRGO) as the mediator in the Z-scheme photocatalytic system with BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh as the O2 and H2 photocatalysts, respectively. The PRGO could transfer electrons generated in the O2 photocatalyst to holes in the excited H2 photocatalyst, thus resulting in efficient oxidation and reduction of water on the O2 and H2 photocatalysts, respectively.

The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons is an attractive solar-to-fuel process, in that it can simultaneously solve the global warming and the energy shortage problems. Graphene-based materials have been employed as photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Liang et al. investigated the influence of defects of graphene on the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The two major solution-based pathways for producing graphene, oxidation–reduction and solvent exfoliation, resulted in nanoplatelets with different defect densities. It was demonstrated that the TiO2–graphene catalysts based on solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) exhibited higher activity due to less defects and enhanced carrier mobility. In comparison with the bare TiO2 catalyst, the optimized TiO2–graphene nanocomposites yielded ca. a 7-fold improvement in the photoreduction of CO2. Moreover, Liang et al. also investigated the role of carbon nanomaterial dimensionality on the photoreduction of CO2 by comparing the two photocatalysts of SEG–TiO2 nanosheets (TiNS) and SWCNT–TiNS. During the photoreduction of CO2, SEG–TiNS produced 73.5% more CH4 compared to SWCNT–TiNS. The enhancement could be attributed to the fact that the 2D SEG possessed more intimate electronic and physical coupling with TiNS in comparison to 1D SWCNT, facilitating a more efficient suppression of the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Very recently, Tu et al. reported the synthesis of the robust hollow spheres consisting of alternating TiO2 nanosheets and graphene nanosheets (G–Ti0.91O2) via a layer-by-layer deposition method for efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Compared to the TiO2–graphene nanocomposites prepared by dispersing TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of graphene sheets, G–Ti0.91O2-based hollow spheres exhibited a 9-fold enhancement in the photoreduction of CO2. The enhancement could be attributed to three aspects: (i) the ultrathin nature of Ti0.91O2 nanosheets allowing charge carriers to move rapidly onto the surface; (ii) the sufficiently compact stacking of ultrathin Ti0.91O2 nanosheets with graphene nanosheets enabling the photogenerated electron to make a fast transfer from Ti0.91O2 nanosheets to graphene, enhancing the lifetime of the charge carriers; and (iii) the hollow structure potentially acting as a photon-trap well to allow the multi-scattering of incident light for the enhancement of light absorption.


In addition to the above mentioned photoelectrochemical applications, graphene-based materials have also been involved in other photoelectrochemical applications, such as selective chemical synthesis, the disinfection process, photodynamic anticancer and photoelectrochemical cytosensing.

Photocatalysis has been considered as an alternative to conventional synthetic routes in the selective transformation of organic compounds. The required mild conditions and the possibility to decrease the generation of undesired substances highlight its potential as a promising route for organic synthesis. Recently, graphene-based materials have been used as novel photocatalysts for selective transformation of organic compounds. For example, Xu and coworkers reported the use of CdS–graphene and TiO2–graphene as catalysts in the light-driven selective oxidation of alcohols, respectively. In the former case, the CdS–graphene catalyst showed significantly enhanced conversion and yield in the oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes compared to the pure CdS. The high photoactivity of CdS–graphene could be ascribed to the integrative effect of enhanced light absorption intensity, high electron conductivity of graphene, and its significant influence on the morphology and structure of the samples. In the latter case, three TiO2–graphene composites (TiO2–GR via Hummers method, TiO2-solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) via dimethylformamide-assisted exfoliation, and P25–SEG) were compared. All the three composites showed decent selectivities (>95%), and the TiO2–SEG catalyst exhibited the highest yield and conversion. The high performance of TiO2–SEG could be attributed to the low density of defects in the SEG and the improved interfacial contact between TiO2 and SEG. In another work, Pan et al. reported the visible light induced oxidative C–H functionalisation of tertiary amines catalyzed by the combination of GO and Rose Bengal. The introduction of GO as a cocatalyst typically resulted in an increase in both the reaction rate and the yield, though the role of GO was not clear at this stage.
In addition, graphene has shown the potential to modify the TiO2 surface to contrive photoresponsive biomaterials for photoelectrochemical bio-related applications. For instance, Akhavan et al. investigated the photoinactivation of the bacteria of the graphene–TiO2 composite thin film. It was found that the graphene–TiO2 composite thin films were able to destroy more than 99.9% of E. coli bacteria in an aqueous solution under solar light irradiation. Compared to the pure TiO2, the antibacterial activity was improved by a factor of about 7.5. Very recently, these authors also investigated the inactivation of viruses photocatalyzed by a graphene–tungsten oxide (graphene–WO3) composite under visible light irradiation. The graphene–WO3 composite showed an enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance in the photoinactivation of viruses, as compared to WO3. It was revealed that the photocatalysis of the viruses on surface of the graphene–WO3 composite film resulted in a nearly complete destruction of the viral protein and a sharp increase in RNA efflux after 3 h light irradiation at room temperature. In addition, Hu et al. demonstrated the visible light driven photodynamic anticancer activity of GO–TiO2 hybrid (GOT). Consistent with the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, GOT generated reactive oxygen species after visible light irradiation, which could be used for photodynamic anticancer processes. It was found that GOT (0–100 μg mL−1) didn't show cytotoxicity during long incubation times without irradiation. When cancer cells were exposed to GOT under visible-light irradiation, however, a marked decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cell viability, activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as increased malondialdehyde production were observed. Moreover, GOT further caused significant elevation in caspase-3 activity, and induced apoptotic death. Furthermore, the heteronanostructure of the graphene–semiconductor nanocomposites is known to facilitate the spatial separation of the charge carriers, thus resulting in enhanced photocurrent intensity, which makes it a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical biosensing. Recently, Zhao et al. reported a facile one-step synthesis of graphene–CdS nanocomposites for photoelectrochemical cytosensing. The graphene–CdS nanocomposites-based photoelectrochemical cytosensor was fabricated by using a layer-by-layer assembly process. This photoelectrochemical cytosensor showed a good photoelectronic effect and cell-capture ability, and had a wide linear range and low detection limit for HeLa cells.

Since its discovery in 2004, graphene has attracted global attention because of its unique atom-thick 2D structure and excellent electrical, thermal, mechanical and optical properties. Moreover, graphene can be made insulating, semiconducting, or semimetallic by appropriately tuning the oxidation or reduction process to control its structural order. The surface properties of graphene could also be adjusted via chemical modification, which offers tremendous opportunities for functionalized graphene-based materials. On the basis of the unique structure and excellent properties of graphene, the coupling of graphene with semiconductor materials presents the possibility to design and fabricate novel graphene-based materials for a wide range of applications in photoelectrochemistry, ranging from photoelectrochemical solar cells, photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants, photocatalytic splitting of H2O, photocatalytic conversion for fuels, and so on. Considerable advances in this area have already been made in recent years. In this review, we have summarized the recent advances in the field of graphene from photoelectrochemistry. These exciting developments have opened up new pathways to develop novel photoelectrochemical systems for their potential in high-performance photoelectrochemical applications.

Despite these advances, the studies in this field are at an early stage. A number of challenges still exist in the exploitation of graphene-based materials for their photoelectrochemical applications, and further developments are required. First, one of the key challenges is related to the facile synthesis and processing of graphene on a large scale in a somewhat controlled fashion. Many critical problems are still waiting for efficient solutions, particularly regarding the precise structural engineering of graphene, which is crucial for both band-gap adjustment and building-block functionalization. More controlled strategies have to be developed for preparing high-quality graphene or graphene oxide sheets with high purity, well-defined structure, uniform morphology and tunable sizes of layers, compositions and defects. Second, it's known that the photoelectrochemical performances of graphene-based functional materials are highly dependent on the surface microstructure of materials. Thus, the structural evolution of loaded functional nanomaterials on the 2D graphene supports should be highlighted, through controlling their morphologies, phase structures, porosities, surface active sites, as well as tailoring the interface, interactions, and assembly behavior among graphene layers and between graphene and other materials. Further improvement of photoelectrochemical performance is expected via structural optimization of the graphene-based nanoarchitectures. Third, a full understanding of the role of graphene in photoelectrochemical properties and photoelectrochemical mechanisms of graphene-based materials still needs more exploration. Specific attention should be paid to understanding, designing and controlling the mechanisms of photoelectrochemical enhancement induced by graphene-based materials. For this purpose, all aspects of the fundamental processing–structure–properties relationship will need to be better understood and controlled. Furthermore, the development and endorsement of standardized testing methods is also important for the investigation of photoelectrochemical activities of graphene-based materials. Finally, the construction of graphene-based photoelectrochemical devices is another challenging work. In this regard, extra efforts are needed to further improve the quality of synthetic graphene-based materials and the device fabrication technique to make a well-defined device structure so that its properties and functions can be fully utilized for high-performance photoelectrochemical applications. Nevertheless, researchers in the world are nowadays making rapid progress toward the exploration of graphene-based materials for photoelectrochemical applications, and it is certain that the remaining challenges will soon be circumvented. Thus, graphene-based materials are expected to be developed as competitive materials for photoelectrochemical applications with a view to addressing various environmental and energy-related issues. The future in this area should be interesting and fantastic.
