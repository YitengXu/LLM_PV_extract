β-Functionalized push–pull zinc opp-dibenzoporphyrins were designed and synthesized as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. The utilization of arylamine to replace aliphatic amine as the donor group has been proved to be an effective strategy to solve the solar cell instability reported previously. Three different arylamino groups including carbazole (YH8), diphenylamine (YH9), and phenothiazine (YH10) were investigated as arylamine donor groups, and different electronic effects were observed for these donor groups. Diphenylamine carrying YH9 and phenothiazine carrying YH10 displayed strong push–pull characteristics including segregated HOMO/LUMO and red-shifted and broadened absorption bands. In sharp contrast, the incorporation of carbazole (YH8) cancels out the push–pull effect. YH9 and YH10 solar cells achieved high PCEs of 6.9% and 7.5% respectively, which are comparable to that of the best ruthenium dye, N719 (η = 7.7%), under similar conditions. This work demonstrates the great potential of π-extended porphyrins as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) offer a cheap and convenient solution for clean and renewable energy. Due to the critical role the dyes play in DSSCs, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing suitable dyes for DSSCs. Porphyrins are one of the most investigated dyes in the past decade. Porphyrins possess a number of properties that are suitable for DSSCs including broad absorption in the visible region and favorable cell kinetics for electron injection and charge recombination. The push–pull porphyrins introduced by Diau and Yeh represent an extremely successful development of organic dyes. Record-breaking power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs have been achieved with these push–pull porphyrins. Despite these advances, DSSCs based on organic dyes are still far from practical applications due to problems relating to solar cell instability arising from labile anchoring groups, lengthy synthesis, and low photostability of dyes. The development of DSSCs has reached a bottleneck. New strategies must be developed in order to make new breakthroughs in DSSCs.

π-Extended porphyrins are attractive candidates as sensitizers for DSSCs. As compared to their parent porphyrins, π-extended porphyrins display broader and red-shifted absorption with often enhanced Q bands, which allow a more effective overlap with the solar spectrum. However, due to difficult synthesis and lack of functionalization methods, despite their interesting optical and photophysical properties, π-extended porphyrins have been rarely used in DSSCs and other applications. Our groups have been engaged in developing concise and versatile synthetic methods to access linearly π-extended porphyrins. The availability of these methods has opened the door to design functionalized π-extended porphyrins. Through developing new classes of push–pull π-extended porphyrins as sensitizers for DSSCs, we wish to provide new opportunities in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells.
In a previous study, we designed a class of push–pull dibenzoporphyrin (YH7), which bear dimethylamino groups on the phenylethynyl bridge as the “push” (electron-donating) group and acrylic acid as the “pull” (electron-withdrawing or anchoring) group (Fig. 1, top).YH7 displayed a strong “push–pull” effect including much faster electron-ejection from the excited state to the conduction band of TiO2, called the HOMO and LUMO orbital segregation, and broadened and enhanced absorption bands, all of which suggest that a better power conversion efficiency (PCE) should be obtained for YH7-based solar cells. To our surprise, YH7 showed a lower PCE than its non-push–pull analogue YH6. Careful investigation has revealed that YH7 has similar or increased stability to its non-push–pull analogue YH6 in solution and on the TiO2 surface. However, significant illumination-induced photodegradation of YH7 was observed when the electrolyte I−/I3− was present. In order to solve the decomposition problem, we have designed a new series of push–pull dibenzoporphyrins bearing tertiary arylamine groups as the electron-donating group (Fig. 1, bottom). Our studies have shown that the decomposition problem has been resolved through incorporating tertiary arylamines and a much enhanced PCE similar to that of the best ruthenium dye (N719) has been achieved. Herein, we present the synthesis, studies on the donor group effect and structure–property relationships of these push–pull opp-dibenzoporphyrins, and their evaluation as sensitizers in DSSCs.

The low photostability of push–pull dibenzoporphyrin YH7 in the presence of the I−/I3− electrolyte likely arose from the redox reaction between the excited dye and the I−/I3− electrolyte. Although triethanolamine (TEA) has been reported to facilitate photobleaching of porphyrins, such photodegradation has not been reported for other dyes carrying amino groups. Considering YH6 which does not carry amino groups and does not decompose in the presence of the I−/I3− electrolyte, the dimethylamino groups on YH7 appeared to be responsible for the severe photodegradation. In order to solve this problem, we decided to replace the dimethylamino group on YH7 with diarylamino groups. Diarylamino derivatives are electron-rich compounds that have been used as hole transporting materials and light emitters in the field of optoelectronics. Diarylamine has been reported to promote fast regeneration reactions in DSSCs through repelling the triiodide ions from the TiO2 surface to reduce charge recombination. Very importantly, diarylamine is expected to be more stable in its excited state due to the delocalization of the excited radical in the π-system. We have designed a homologous set of push–pull zinc dibenzoporphyrins bearing tertiary arylamines including carbazole (YH8, Fig. 1), diphenylamine (YH9) and phenothiazine (YH10) as the donor groups, and acrylic acid groups as the pull/anchoring groups. Triphenylamine derivatives have been extensively studied as electron-donating units in various porphyrin dyes. Carbazole and phenothiazine are structurally analogous to the triphenylamine unit except that the two phenyl rings are fused together through a 5-membered ring (carbazole) and 6-membered ring (phenothiazine), respectively. The fusion would force the two phenyl groups to lie in the same plane, further extending the π-conjugation. The presence of the sulfur atom in phenothiazine (YH10) is also expected to have impacts on its electronic structures.

The synthesis of these push–pull dibenzoporphyrins is illustrated in Scheme 1. The three donor diarylamine derivatives 1, 2 and 3 were synthesized from ethynylbenzenes, which were either commercially available or prepared using literature reported procedures,via the Sonogashira coupling reaction. Dibromobenzoporphyrin 4 was synthesized using a similar procedure reported previously by us. Dibromobenzoporphyrin 4 reacted with the corresponding enynes through the Heck-based sequence reaction, which involves the Heck reaction followed by 6π-cyclization and subsequent aromatization, yielding opp-dibenzoporphyrins 5, 6 and 7. The Heck reaction was carried out in the presence of Pd[P(t-Bu)3]2. No oxidant was needed for 6π-electrolization and subsequent aromatization. However, the yields of the reactions of bromobenzoporphyrin 4 with enynes were low due to the severe polymerization reaction of enynes as well as a side reaction occurring in enynes in the presence of Pd(0). Zinc insertion of 5, 6 and 7 followed by hydrolysis of the ester groups furnished the final push–pull opp-dibenzoporphyrins YH8, YH9 and YH10, respectively.

Normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of dibenzoporphyrins YH8–YH10 are shown in Fig. 2. Dibenzoporphyrin YH9 bearing the diphenylamino-group displayed a very similar absorption pattern to that of YH7, with both showing an intense Soret band centered at 480 nm and an apparent shoulder at 460 nm for YH9 and 458 nm for YH7. The Q bands of YH9 and YH7 are also similar. While YH9 absorbed at 597, 618, and 639 nm, the corresponding absorption bands of YH7 were found at 598, 618, and 641 nm. The minor differences between the absorption spectra of YH9 and YH7 reflect that the phenyl substituents of the amino group executed a minimal impact on the electronic properties of YH9, which is likely due to the non-planarity of the diarylamino group. Upon fusion of two phenyl groups, both the Soret bands of YH8 and YH10 shifted slightly hypsochromically and the shoulder of the Soret bands became less distinguishable. The Soret band of YH10 was much more broadened relative to that of YH9 and YH8. The Q bands of YH8 shifted slightly hypsochromically and were narrowed relative to those of YH9. In contrast, the Q bands of YH10 were much more broadened and enhanced as compared to those of YH8 and YH9. These data suggest the different influences of carbazole (YH8) and phenothiazine (YH10) on the electronic properties of the dyes. YH10 has much better spectral overlap with the solar spectrum arising from broadened and enhanced absorption which could contribute to a better photovoltaic performance.

Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the three dibenzoporphyrins (YH8–YH10) exhibited similar emission patterns with two emission bands around 600–750 nm (Fig. 2, inset). The fluorescence spectral onset of YH8–YH10 roughly reflects a similar trend in their UV-Vis absorption spectra. The optical data of these porphyrins are organized in Table 1.

The fluorescence lifetimes of YH8–YH10 were measured using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. The fluorescence lifetimes of YH8 and YH9 were found to be 1.12 ns and 1.18 ns, respectively, both of which are slightly longer than that of YH7 (1.06 ns). In contrast, the fluorescence lifetime of YH10 was only 0.58 ns, suggesting an even stronger push–pull effect in YH10.
The optical HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of YH7–YH10 were calculated from UV-Vis and emission spectra. YH8–YH10 displayed the same optical energy gap of 1.94 eV, which is only slightly higher than that of YH7 (1.93 eV).

The electrochemical properties of YH8–YH10 were measured by cyclic (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. All these three dibenzoporphyrins revealed two one-electron oxidation corresponding to porphyrin ring oxidation and a third multi-electron oxidation due to the peripheral push groups, and two one-electron reduction (Fig. 3, see Fig. S2 for CV curves). CV studies suggested these electrode processes to be quasi-to-irreversible; hence, DPV data were used to report the redox potential values. The two oxidation occurred at 0.78 V and 0.99 V vs. Ag/AgCl for YH9, which are close to those of YH7 (0.78 V and 0.96 V). The carbazole bearing YH8 was relatively easier to oxidize than YH9 with the first oxidation occurring at 0.77 V and second oxidation at 0.97 V. In contrast, YH10 revealed relatively higher oxidation potentials, with the first one at 0.79 V and second one at 0.98 V. While the reduction potentials of YH8 (−1.22), YH9 (−1.25 V) and YH10 (−1.24 V) shifted to more negative potentials as compared with YH7 (−0.96). These electrochemical data once again reflect the impact of the different 3° arylamine donor groups on the electronic properties of the porphyrins. The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO energy gap followed the order of YH7 (2.06 V) > YH10 (2.03 V) ∼ YH9 (2.03 V) > YH8 (1.99 V). Although the electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gap is slightly higher than the optical HOMO–LUMO gap, it is notable that the electrochemical energy gaps of YH7, YH9 and YH10 are very close, roughly following a similar trend observed for the optical energy gap.

The relevant optical and electrochemical data are given in Table 1.
The driving force for dye regeneration (ΔGreg) of oxidized dyes was estimated using the experimental first oxidation potentials of YH8–YH10 and the potential of the redox mediator I−/I3− (Fig. 4). All investigated porphyrins possess first oxidation potentials > 0.5 V, more positive than the potential of the redox mediator I−/I3− (0.42 V vs. SHE) (Table 1), which suggest the thermodynamically feasible regeneration of oxidized dyes from the electron mediator.
The driving force for electron injection (ΔGinj) from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2 was also determined (Fig. 4). The excited state oxidation potentials  of YH7–YH10 were calculated to be −0.94 V, −0.97 V, −0.96 V and −0.94 V, respectively. The LUMO energy levels are sufficiently high to ensure efficient electron injection from the photo-excited porphyrin dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 (ΔGinj = −0.44 to −0.47 eV).

DFT calculations (Gaussian 09 DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) in gas phase) were carried out for YH8–YH10 in order to gain better understanding of their electronic properties. The calculated geometries (Fig. 5, top) and the HOMOs and LUMOs (Fig. 5, bottom) of these molecules are shown in Fig. 5. Dibenzoporphyrins YH8–YH10 adopt a slightly domed conformation. It is notable that the phenylethynyl groups in YH8–YH10 lie in the same plane as the porphyrin core, which is expected to facilitate intramolecular electronic communication.

The LUMOs of these porphyrins mainly involve the porphyrin core and the acceptor groups including the phenylethynyl component bearing the anchoring groups. The donor groups are not included in the LUMO and LUMO+1. The HOMO of YH9 is mainly located on the donor group. It is interesting to note that the HOMO and HOMO−1 of YH10 reside on one of the phenothiazine groups. The characteristics of the HOMOs and LUMOs of YH9 and YH10 suggest significant orbital segregation. Such orbital segregation is expected to facilitate electron injection from the photoexcited dye to the TiO2 conduction band. It is notable that the orbital arrangement of YH9 is very similar to that of YH7. In contrast, YH8 displays a completely different feature. The HOMO of YH8 is mainly located on the porphyrin core with some contributions to the two fused benzene rings. The HOMO−1 of YH8 is also located on the porphyrin core, however, with inclusion of only one fused benzene ring. The donor groups are not involved in both the HOMO and HOMO−1 of YH8. The energy levels of the orbital also displayed a different scenario. While the HOMO and HOMO−1 of YH9 and YH10 remain essentially degenerated, the degeneracy of the HOMO and HOMO−1 of YH8 is broken. On the other hand, while the LUMO and LUMO+1 of YH8 are degenerated, those of YH9 and YH10 are more split. The calculated data on the molecular orbitals explain the significant difference in the electronic and electrochemical properties observed for YH8, YH9 and YH10.
The order of the calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gap is YH8 (2.53 eV) > YH10 (2.46 eV) > YH9 (2.32 eV) ∼ YH7 (2.38 eV). This order does not agree with those of the optical energy gap and electrochemical energy gap. The discrepancy could be explained with solvent effects as the optical and electrochemical measurements were performed in different solvents.
DFT calculations (Gaussian 09 DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) in acetonitrile were carried out for YH8–YH10 to further understand how the inclusion of solvent would affect the DFT calculations. The calculated geometries and frontier orbitals of YH8–YH10 are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI. It is not surprising that the orbital distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of YH8–YH10 changed in acetonitrile media. While the HOMO and LUMO of YH10 displayed even enhanced segregation, the segregation of the HOMO and LUMO of YH9 became much less significant. On the other hand, the HOMO and LUMO of YH8 remained similar to those of the DFT calculation in the gas phase. These data provide some insights into solvent effects for understanding solar cell performance.

DSSCs sensitized by YH8–YH10 were assembled and photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves and IPCE action spectra were recorded to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. The J–V curves and IPCE spectra were measured under simulated AM 1.5 one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination for cells with a 0.16 cm2 active area. The sandwich type two electrode cells were constructed dye-coated TiO2 film as the working electrode, Pt-sized FTO as the counter electrode, and I−/I3− as the redox mediator in the presence of a CHCl3/t-BuOH (v/v, 1/2) solvent mixture. The steady photocurrent production was confirmed by preforming on–off switching experiments. The light to power conversion efficiency (η) was determined based on eqn (1), where JSC is the short-circuit current density, VOC is the open circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor.

Dye soaking time for dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface was investigated to optimize solar cell performance using YH10 as the standard sensitizer (Table S5 in the ESI). A range of times were tested including 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h and 15 h. It turned out that 3 h of dye soaking time gave the optimal photovoltaic performance. The PCE value of YH10 decreased significantly with increased soaking time, which suggests severe dye aggregation at higher dye concentration on the photoanode, leading to lower JSC and VOC values.

Dye aggregation is known to ensue self-quenching of the excited state, thus blocking the pathways for carrier photogeneration resulting in low photovoltaic performance. To optimize the dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface, we investigated the dye concentration and the solvent ratio (CHCl3/t-BuOH) using YH10 (see Tables S2 and S3 in the ESI). A dye concentration of 0.2 mM in 2/1 (v/v) of CHCl3/t-BuOH gave the best power conversion efficiency. Co-adsorption of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) with the dye onto the TiO2 surface is an effective strategy to reduce dye aggregation. The effect of CDCA was then investigated through sensitizing YH10 with different concentrations of CDCA (0–1.0 mM CDCA) (see Table S4 in the ESI). The best PCE value was achieved when 0.2 mM CDCA was used as a co-absorbent with YH10.

The power conversion efficiencies were measured for solar cells based on YH8–YH10 under optimized conditions. The photovoltaic performances of these solar cells are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2. The power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of the YH9-sensitized solar cell is 6.9%, which is much higher than that of its aliphatic counterpart YH7 (5.7%) bearing the dimethylamino group as the donor group. The increased PCE can be attributed to the improved stability of YH9 in the presence of the I2/I3− electrolyte. In sharp contrast to the YH7-based solar cell, for which significant decomposition was observed causing the dark green-coloured surface of the YH7-sensitized device to turn to a pale colour upon irradiation, the YH9-based solar cell was stable with no observable colour change upon irradiation. The YH8- and YH10-based solar cells displayed similar stability. The much-enhanced stability of the YH8–YH10 based solar cells suggests that the strategy of utilizing arylamines to replace aliphatic amines as the donor group of the dyes is effective.


YH10-sensitized solar cells achieved an even higher PCE (η = 7.5%) than the YH9 cell, making it comparable with the best ruthenium dye N719 (η = 7.7%). The VOC values of YH9 and YH10 cells are the same at 0.63 V, indicating similar kinetic processes for electron injection and charge collection (TiO2). The JSC value of the YH10 cell is higher than that of the YH9 cell (16.16 mA cm−2), reaching 17.16 mA cm−2. The higher JSC value of the YH10 cell suggests the higher light harvesting ability of YH10 as reflected by the much broader UV-Vis absorption spectrum. A silent factor that also contributes to the much higher PCE of the YH10 cell is the HOMO orbital distribution of YH10 (Fig. 5), which is much further away from the TiO2 surface as compared with those of YH8 and YH9. The longer distance from the TiO2 surface is expected to retard charge recombination and thus enhance the PCE.
When carbazole groups serve as the donor group, the YH8-sensitized solar cell gave a surprisingly low PCE of 5.3%, even lower than that of the solar cell sensitized by YH6 (6.7%), which does not bear electron-donating groups as donor groups. The JSC value of the YH8 cell (12.51 mA cm−2) is much lower than those of the YH9 (16.16 mA cm−2) and YH10 (17.16 mA cm−2) solar cells. The VOC value (0.60 V) of the YH8 cell is also lower than those of the YH9 (0.63 V) and YH10 (0.63 V) cells. As shown in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 2), YH8 displayed much narrower Soret and Q bands as compared with YH10. However, the absorption bands of YH8 are only slightly blue-shifted and narrower than those of YH9. On the other hand, the HOMOs and LUMOs of YH9 and YH10 showed orbital segregation with the LUMO lying heavily on the electron-withdrawing (anchoring) groups and the HOMO centred on the electron-donating groups. Such orbital segregation is expected to facilitate electron injection and charge separation, which is a much-desired feature for DSSCs. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of YH8 did not show any orbital segregation. This feature along with the earlier discussed free-energy change values (Table 1) are likely the reason for the low PCE of the YH8 cell.
The current and potential switching plots are shown in Fig. 6c and d. The reproducibility of the results for YH8–YH10 suggests the robustness of the solar cells.

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE%) spectra were measured for selected dye-sensitized devices (Fig. 6b). The IPCE% (λ) values were calculated from eqn (2), where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the quantum yield of electron injection from the excited sensitizer into TiO2, and ηcol is the electron collection efficiency.

IPCE (λ) = LHE × Φinj × ηcol
(2)
The IPCE% spectra of YH8–YH10 display a similar trend with higher IPCE values in the Soret band region (up to 45%) and lower IPCE values in the Q band region (up to 15%). The YH10 solar cell exhibited higher IPCE values than YH8 and YH9 solar cells in both the Soret band region and Q-band region. The order of the overall IPCE value is YH10 > YH9 > YH8, which reflects exactly the trend observed for JSC.

The interfacial charge transfer resistance in solar cells was estimated with EIS experiments under dark and light conditions (Fig. 7).

The Nyquist plots of YH8–YH10 show two semicircles with two different radii, whereas the larger semicircle at low frequency represents the electron transport at the TiO2/dye/redox mediator interface at the working electrode. The smaller semicircle at the high frequency relates to the charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. By using the equivalent circuit shown at the top of Fig. 7, the impedance curves of the dyes were analyzed and the recombination resistance values (Rct) were calculated. Rct values of YH8 (2.47 Ω cm2) is lower than those of YH9 and YH10 (3.20 and 3.40 Ω cm2, respectively) under light conditions (see Table 3) which generally agrees with high VOC values recorded for the latter two compounds.

In previous work, we observed that the YH7 (see Fig. 1 for the structure of YH7) solar cell became discoloured 5–10 min after the solar cell was assembled. Discolouration of the YH6 solar cell was not observed. Solar cell stability studies revealed that the PCE of the YH6 cell increased in 3 h and only slightly decreased after 20 h. In contrast, the PCE of the YH7 cell continually decreased within the 20 h window. In order to understand the causes of degradation, we conducted stability studies on YH6 and YH7 in solution and on the TiO2 surface (see Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI) using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Our studies showed that YH6 and YH7 display similar stability in solution and on the TiO2 surface. However, when I2/I3− was present, YH7 bearing amine groups decomposed much faster than YH6 that does not carry amine groups in solution (see Fig. S7 in the ESI), which correlates well with the phenomenon observed for the corresponding solar cells. It has been reported that the presence of triethanolamine (TEA) facilitates the photobleaching of porphyrins. It is likely that the tertiary amine groups on YH7 caused the severe degradation in the presence of the I2/I3− electrolyte.

Since YH7 demonstrated a much stronger push–pull effect than YH6, which was a much-desired feature for dyes in DSSCs, we decided to investigate the possibility to replace the amine group in YH7 with arylamines as the donating groups. YH8, YH9 and YH10 bearing arylamines, i.e., carbazole (YH8), diphenylamine (YH9) and phenothiazine (YH10), displayed similar stabilities to that of YH7 in solution in the absence of I2/I3−. When I2/I3− was present, YH8–YH10 also showed similar decomposition profiles to that of YH7 (see Fig. S8 in the ESI). In sharp contrast to the YH7 solar cell, YH8–YH10 based solar cells showed similar stability to that of the YH6 cell during the measurement time period. These data suggest that the bulky tertiary arylamine of YH8–YH10 could stabilize the solar cells likely through shielding the amine group from interacting with the electrolyte on the TiO2 surface. However, in solution, such shielding does not exist; as a result, all these amine carrying dyes share similar decomposition profiles in solution.

In summary, a series of β-functionalized push–pull opp-dibenzoporphyrins bearing different push groups (YH8–YH10) has been introduced as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. These compounds were designed to solve the solar cell instability issue reported earlier. Replacing alkylamines with arylamines as the donor groups proved to be an effective strategy to alleviate the problem of illumination-induced dye degradation. The presence of two anchoring groups, a unique structural advantage of these benzoporphyrin dyes as compared with the majority of other organic dyes carrying only one anchoring group, further enhances the solar cell stability. Remarkably high PCEs close to that of the best ruthenium N719 dye (η = 7.7%) have been achieved with YH9 (η = 6.9%) and YH10 (η = 7.5%). The high PCE of the YH10 solar cell is mainly attributed to its exceptional light harvesting ability and favourable cell kinetics. In addition, the orbital distribution in the HOMO of YH10 is further away from the TiO2 surface relative to those of YH8 and YH9, which is expected to slow down the charge recombination and contribute to its higher PCE. The results in this work suggest the great potential of β-functionalized push–pull opp-dibenzoporphyrins, representing a new generation of sensitizers for DSSCs. We anticipate new breakthroughs with β-functionalized push–pull opp-dibenzoporphyrins in DSSCs.

Significant push group effects were observed for these porphyrins. Different amino groups including carbazole (YH8), diphenylamine (YH9) and phenothiazine YH10 were incorporated into the dye molecules as the donor group. Push–pull dibenzoporphyrins bearing diphenylamine (YH9) and phenothiazine (YH10) demonstrated strong push–pull effects, displaying significant orbital segregation of the LUMO heavily located on the anchoring groups (acrylic acid groups) and HOMO centred on the donor groups. All these push–pull porphyrins (YH8–YH10) showed red-shifted and broadened absorption bands as compared with YH6 bearing no donor groups. The band broadening was particularly remarkable for phenothiazine carrying YH10. The fluorescence lifetime of YH10 (0.58 ns) was also much shorter than those of YH8 (1.12 ns) and YH9 (1.18 ns). In sharp contrast, the inclusion of the carbazole group as the donor group (YH8) rendered an opposite effect. The absorption bands of YH8 were blue shifted, and much narrower than those of YH10. The significant orbital segregation observed for YH7, YH9 and YH10 did not appear for the HOMO and LUMO of YH8. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of YH8 were largely elevated as compared with those of YH7, YH9 and YH10. As a result, the YH8 solar cell gave the lowest PCE of 5.3%. The notable differences in the electronic and optical properties of these dibenzoporphyrins indicate their exceptional structural modifiability. Further investigation into structure–property–efficiency relationships of this class of benzoporphyrins is currently underway in our laboratories.
