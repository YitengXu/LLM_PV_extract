New biaxially extended quaterthiophene (4T) conjugated polymers, including poly(5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene) (P4T) and their copolymers with thiophene(P4TT), bithiophene (P4T2T), selenophene(P4TSe) and biselenophene (P4T2Se) were synthesized by Stille coupling reactions under microwave heating. The effects of the ring number of thiophene and selenophene moieties on the physical properties and polymer structures were systematically investigated experimentally and theoretically. With the increased ring number of the unsubstituted thiophene and selenophene moieties, the band gaps and the main-chain torsional angles were reduced. However, the side-chain torsional angles were increased with increasing the ring number, and thus significantly affected the carrier transporting characteristics. Among these studied conjugated polymers, the field-effect transistor (FET) based on P4TSe showed the highest hole mobility of up to 4.28 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 1.12 × 104. The photovoltaic device prepared from P4TSe/PC71BM exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.6%, which resulted from more balanced hole/electron mobility and a smaller band gap. The above results revealed that the conformation, charge-transporting and optoelectronic device characteristics of biaxially extended 4T-based conjugated copolymers could be manipulated by incorporating the heteroaromatic ring spacer.

The development of organic polymer semiconductors for applying to organic electronics such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs),memory devices, and field-effect transistors (FETs) have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of low cost, lightweight, flexibility and large-area fabrication. Biaxially extended semiconducting polymers with conjugated side chains have been studied for FET and OPV, because they can effectively enhance charge transport and power conversion efficiency. Li and coworkers reported that the incorporation of conjugated side chains into the thiophene backbone facilitated the extension of electron delocalization, such as bi(phenylenevinylene),bi(thienylenevinylene) and phenothiazinevinylene. It resulted in broad absorption and improved charge transport within the polymer thin films. Ting and coworkers demonstrated that polythiophene directly attached with alkylthiophene side chain possessed a lower band gap and relatively lower-lying HOMO level in comparison with those of the parent P3HT. These reports imply that the biaxially extended conjugated polymer structure is a promising approach for optoelectronic device applications. On the other hand, selenophene (Se)-based conjugated polymers have shown excellent PV characteristics, mainly due to their reduced optical band gaps and intrinsically low-lying LUMO level to result in small energy damage. Simultaneously, Se-based conjugated polymers provide the chance to enhance the chain interaction and the carrier transport phenomenon since selenium generally exhibits a stronger heteroaromatic interaction than sulfur, favorable for FET application. Park and coworkers reported that poly(5,5′-bis(3-dodecylthiophene-2-yl)-2-2′-biselenophene) (PDT2Se2) exhibited much better carrier mobility and power conversion efficiency compared to poly(3,3′′′-didodecyl quaterthiophene) (PQT-12). However, the effects of ring spacer and heteroatom on the optoelectronic properties of such biaxial conjugated polymers have not been fully explored yet.

In this work, the synthesis, properties and device applications of new 4T-based copolymers poly(5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene) (P4T) and four 4T-based conjugated copolymers are reported, including poly(2′,5′′-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene-alt-2,5-thiophene) (P4TT), poly(2′,5′′-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]-quaterthiophene-alt-5,5′-[2,2′]dithiophene) (P4T2T) poly(2′,5′′-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene-alt-2,5-selenophene)(P4TSe), poly(2′,5′′-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene-alt-5,5′-[2,2′]diselenophene) (P4T2Se). The effects of thiophene, bithiophene, selenophene, and biselenophene moieties on the backbone conformation, chain packing, and optoelectronic properties were explored. These polymers were synthesized by Stille coupling reactions under microwave heating, as shown in Scheme 1. The charge transport characteristics of these copolymers were studied by using top-contact FETs. Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated by spin-coating a substrate with a polymer blend of 4T-based polymer/PC71BM, which was then sandwiched between a transparent anode (ITO) and cathodes (Ca/Al). The correlation of the chemical structure, polymer conformation, electrical properties, and device characteristics was explored.


Tri(o-tolyl)phosphine, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0), trimethyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane, and bromothiophene were purchased from Aldrich (Missouri, USA) and used without further purification. Common organic solvents for synthesis were distilled to keep anhydrous or degassed by nitrogen 0.5 h before using. Ultra-anhydrous solvents (such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene) for device applications were purchased from Aldrich (Missouri, USA). The donors 2′,5′′-dibromo-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′′4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene (4T-Br2) and 2′,5′′-bis-(trimethystannyl)-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene (4T-ditin) were synthesized according to our previous report. The following compounds were synthesized according to the procedures in the literature: 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (T),5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-dithiophene (2T),2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene (Se), and 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-diselenophene (2Se). Surface treatment agent octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) was purchased from Acros (Geel, Belgium) for field-effect transistor characterization. 1-(3-Methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl[6,6]C-71 (PC71BM) was purchased from Nano-C and Solenne (Groningen, The Netherlands) for solar cell device application.


The general procedures of synthesizing conjugated homopolymer poly(5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene) (P4T) and the copolymers P4TT, P4TSe, P4T2T and P4T2Se are shown in Scheme 1. 2′,5′′-Dibromo-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′]quaterthiophene (4T-Br2) or 2′,5′′-bis-(trimethystannyl)-5,5′′′-di-(2-ethylhexyl)[2,3′;5′,2′′;4′′,2′′′] quaterthiophene (4T-ditin), dibromo monomers (2Se) or ditin monomers (T, Se or 2T), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (16 mol% with respect to ditin monomer), and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (2 mol% with respect to ditin monomer) were dissolved in chlorobenzene, and these polymers were synthesized by Pd(0)-catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization under microwave heating for 1–2 h. After that, they were end-capped with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene and 2-bromothiophene (both 1.1 equiv with respect to ditin monomer), cooled, and poured into hexane. The precipitated materials were dissolved into a small amount of chloroform and then re-precipitated into methanol to form crude polymers. The crude polymer was purified further by washing for 3 days in a Soxhlet apparatus with methanol, acetone and hexane to remove oligomers and catalyst residues. The final product was obtained after drying at 40 °C in vacuum.

Microwave reaction was carried out using a Biotage microwave reactor in sealed vessels. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance DRX-400 MHz spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was performed on a Lab Alliance RI2000 instrument (two column, MIXED-C and D from Polymer Laboratories) connected with one refractive index detector from Schambeck SFD Gmbh. All GPC analyses were performed on polymer/THF solutions at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 and temperature f 40 °C, and then calibrated with polystyrene standards.


Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at heating rates of 10 and 5 °C min−1 using the TA instruments Q-50 and Q-100, respectively. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurements were carried out at the 4C2 beamline at the Pohang Light Source. The samples were measured at a sample-to-detector distance (SDD) of 112 mm. The exposure time for the scattering experiments was typically 60 s with a synchrotron X-ray radiation source (0.138 nm wavelength λ) and using a two dimensional charge-coupled detector (2D-CCD: Roper Scientific, Trenton. NJ). The incidence angle αi of the X-ray beam was set to 0.18°, which was between the critical angles of the polymer thin film and silicon substrate. The actual scattering angles in scattering data were corrected according to the scattering angle of the pre-calibrated silver behenate (TCI, Japan) powder. Aluminum pieces were employed as a transparent beam stop because the intensity of the specular reflection from the silicon substrate was much stronger than that of GIXS near the critical angle. UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. For the thin film spectra, polymers were first dissolved in dichlorobenzene (10 mg ml−1), followed by filtering through a 0.45 μm pore size PTFE membrane syringe filter, and then spin-coated at a speed rate of 600 rpm for 600 s onto quartz substrates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with the use of a three-electrode cell in which ITO (polymer films area were about 0.5 × 0.7 cm2) was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary electrode. All cell potentials were taken with the use of a Ag/AgCl, reference electrode. The electrochemical properties of the polymer films were detected under 0.1 M dry acetonitrile solution containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the electrolyte. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were determined from the onset oxidation (Eoxonset) and reduction (Eredonset), respectively, estimated on the basis of the reference energy level of ferrocene (4.8 V below the vacuum level) according to the following equations: HOMO = −[Eoxonset − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8] (eV) and LUMO = −[Eredonset − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8] (eV), respectively.

Theoretical molecular simulation of the 4T-based polymers was calculated through the Gaussian 03 program package. The density functional theory (DFT) method, using Becke's three-parameter functional with the Lee, Yang, and Parr correlation functional method (B3LYP) with 6-31G(d), was used for the optimization of ground-state molecular geometry.


A 200 nm SiO2 layer (capacitance per unit area Ci = 17 nF cm−2) as a gate dielectric was thermally grown onto the highly doped n-type Si(100) substrates. Octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) as a silane coupling agent was modified on the SiO2 by the following preparation procedures: the cleaned wafers were immersed into a 10 mM solution of ODTS in anhydrous toluene at room temperature overnight, and the substrates were rinsed with toluene, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and dried with a steam of nitrogen. The semiconducting polymer thin films were deposited on SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating polymer solutions in chloroform at a spin rate of 1000 rpm for 30 s, or in a mixed solvent of chloroform/o-dichlorobenzene at a spin rate of 600 rpm for 60 s. After drying, these samples were kept for 1 h at 120 °C to anneal. The top-contact source and drain electrodes were defined by 100 nm thick gold through a regular shadow mask, and the channel length (L) and width (W) were 50 and 1000 μm, respectively. FET transfer and output characteristics were recorded in a N2-filled glove box by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer.


All the bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells were fabricated by the following preparation procedures: the glass–indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (obtained from Lumtec, 5 Ω sq−1) were first patterned by lithography, then cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried using a hot plate at 120 °C for 5 min, and finally treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVP AI4083) was filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size PTFE membrane syringe filter and deposited on ITO by spin-coating at 5000 rpm in air, then dried at 140 °C for 20 min inside the glove box. The polymer/PC71BM blend with a ratio of 1:3 was prepared from polymer solutions in anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene followed by spin-coating on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a glove box. Subsequently, the device was coated with a 30 nm thickness of Ca and a 100 nm thickness of Al by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr), respectively. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the polymer photovoltaic cells were conducted using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) with a Peccell solar simulator under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The illumination intensity was calibrated by a standard Si photodiode detector with a KG-5 filter.


The chemical structures of these polymers are confirmed by 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. Fig. 1 shows the 1H-NMR spectrum of the homopolymer P4T, in CD2Cl2. The three peaks at 7.46 (peak a), 6.92 (peak b), and 6.61 ppm (peak c) are assigned to the protons on the aromatic rings. The peaks at 2.66 ppm (thiophene-CH2, peak d), and in the range of 0.82–1.32 ppm are attributed to the protons on the 2-ethylhexyl side chains. The numbers of aromatic and aliphatic protons estimated from integration of the peaks are in a good agreement with the molecular structures of the polymers. The 1H-NMR spectra of the other studied polymers are also consistent with the proposed polymer structures, as shown in the Fig. S1–S4 of the ESI. Furthermore, the experimental carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents of the prepared polymers are in a good agreement with the theoretical values. The above structural characterization results indicate the successful synthesis of the target 4T-based conjugated polymers.

All these polymers are soluble in common solvents, such as chloroform, THF and o-dichlorobenzene, etc. The good solubility of the synthesized polymers provides the solution-processed thin films for optoelectronic device applications. The weight-averaged molecular weight and the polydispersity (Mw, PDI) of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe, and P4T2Se, estimated by GPC are (9100, 1.32), (59480, 1.82), (41110, 1.62), (75930, 1.83), and (22820, 2.14), respectively.


Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the thermal stability of these 4T-based polymers, as shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td) values of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 419, 460, 458, 415 and 423 °C, respectively, indicating their good thermal stability for device applications. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm) of the polymers were estimated from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. 2. The Tg values of P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 31, 30, 43 and 46 °C, respectively. The low Tg of the prepared polymers is probably due to the ethylhexyl group in the 4T moiety providing more free volume for polymer chain migration. P4T has a crystalline melting temperature of 206 °C, and recrystallization occurs at 183 °C on slow cooling. Intriguingly, P4TSe crystallizes at 109 °C, and melts at 189 °C, which is a typical thermal transition of a liquid crystalline (LC) phase.


To further investigate the molecular packing of the 4T-based polymers, X-ray diffraction analyses were performed. Among these polymers, only P4T and P4TSe showed distinguishable diffraction peaks from the X-ray diffraction measurements. GIXS measurements were done with polymer thin films since it is a versatile tool to investigate the out-of-plane and in-plane molecular organization formed in thin films. A schematic picture of the experimental setup is given in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows representative 2D GIXS patterns with thermal annealed thin films of conjugated polymers supported on Si substrates. Measurements were done at an incidence angle of 0.18°, and αf and 2θf are the out-of-plane and in-plane scattering angles in the scattering pattern, respectively. In-plane and out-of-plane scattering profiles are extracted from scattering patterns to obtain more accurate information. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show out-of-plane scattering profiles for P4T and P4TSe thin films extracted along the αf direction at 2θf = 0° and Fig. 5(c) and (d) show in-plane scattering profiles for P4T and P4TSe thin films extracted along the 2θf direction at αf = 0.20°, respectively.


Fig. 4(a) shows the scattering pattern acquired with P4T and ordered peaks are observed along the out-of-plane direction. The out-of-plane scattering profile shown in Fig. 5(a) clearly indicates peaks located at αf = 4.9°, 9.7°, and 14.3°, which are first, second, and third order scattering peaks of a layer structure having a d-spacing of 1.68 nm. The amorphous halo was observed around 20° as shown in Fig. 5(a), having an average distance of 0.40 nm between side chains. For some parts of the amorphous halo, the scattering intensity is enhanced around an azimuth angle of 40–50° with respect to the in-plane direction, which is attributed to the π–π stacking of the polymer backbone and the packing of the alkyl side chains partly occurring.

Fig. 4(b) shows the scattering pattern acquired with P4TSe and several ordered peaks are observed along the out-of-plane direction. The out-of-plane scattering profile shown in Fig. 5(b) clearly indicates peaks located at αf = 4.4°, 8.7°, 12.8°, and 16.7°, which are first, second, third and fourth order scattering peaks of a layer structure having a d-spacing of 1.90 nm. P4TSe forms a more regular structure of layers, since higher order peaks can be observed in comparison with P4T. Furthermore, P4TSe reveals several vertically striped peaks over the range 10–28°, instead of an amorphous halo. This is due to the fact that P4TSe in the thin film has higher crystallinity as shown in the DSC results. So the polymer chains are well stacked to form a lattice structure, showing a series of scattering peaks.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the studied polymers in dilute o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution and spin-coated thin-films are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) and optical band gaps (Egopt) are collected in Table 1. The λmax of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are observed at 390, 471, 487, 512 and 509 nm in solution, and at 394, 499, 540, 587 and 529 nm in the film state, respectively. P4T exhibits a similar absorption spectrum in both solution and film state. However, the λmax of the P4T2T and P4TSe thin films are red-shifted approximately 53 and 75 nm with respect to those in the solutions, indicating strong inter-chain association and aggregation in the thin films of the former. In the cases of P4TT (Δλ = 28 nm) and P4T2Se (Δλ = 20 nm), smaller red shifts are observed, indicating weaker intermolecular stacking or electronic coupling between neighboring polymer backbones in the film state. The large red-shifted absorption spectrum of P4TSe thin film and a clear vibration structure may imply that P4TSe may possess more well-ordered intermolecular packing than the other 4T-based polymers; the absorption spectrum of the P4T2T thin film shows a weak shoulder at around 600 nm, which usually originates from the slight π–π stacking of the polymer molecules.

The optical band gaps of these polymers, obtained from the onsets of the UV-Vis absorption thin films by employing the empirical equation Egopt. = 1240/λonset, eV, are in the following order: P4TSe (1.80) < P4T2Se (1.88) < P4T2T (1.94) < P4TT (2.02) < P4T (2.65). Among them, P4T exhibits the largest Egopt., which could be related to the large steric hindrance of the pendent thiophene moieties. The smaller Egopt. obtained from the 4Tpolymers incorporating the thiophene or selenophene moieties into the backbone may be due to the fact that the inserted thiophene and selenophene units act as spacers to reduce the steric hindrance between the bulky neighbor 4T moieties. Both P4TSe and P4T2Se have smaller Egopt. than P4TT and P4T2T, presumably due to the selenium having a larger atomic radius and being more polarizable, which is favorable for intermolecular interactions in thin films.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior and the energy levels of the polymers. Fig. 7 shows the CV curves of the polymers and the electrochemical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, these polymers exhibited both reversible p-doping/de-doping (oxidation/re-reduction) and n-doping/dedoping (reduction/re-oxidation) processes. The HOMO energy levels for the 4T-based polymers estimated from CV curves are −5.51, −5.28, −5.19, −5.13 and −5.13 eV for P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se, respectively, while their LUMO energy levels are −2.56, −2.73, −2.63, −2.81 and −2.88 eV, respectively. The corresponding electrochemical band gaps of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 2.95, 2.55, 2.56, 2.32 and 2.25 eV, respectively. The different values between the electrochemical and optical band gap are probably due to the exciton binding energies of conjugated polymers, which should be in the range from 0.4 to 1.0 eV. In comparison with P4T, P4TT and P4T2T have higher-lying HOMO energy levels, which indicate that the incorporated unsubstituted thiophene moieties enhance the π-electron delocalization. The stronger intermolecular interaction of selenophene than thiophene leads to the higher-lying HOMO and lower-lying LUMO energy levels of P4TSe and P4T2Se as compared to those of P4TT and P4T2T, respectively. The above results indicate that the electronic properties of the 4T-based polymers can be efficiently tuned by introducing the different moieties into the polymer backbone.


Theoretical molecular simulation of the 4T-based polymers was calculated through the Gaussian 03 program package, in order to understand the molecular conformation of the polymers. Fig. 8 is the optimized geometry on the trimers of the 4T-based polymers, calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The torsional angles of the trimers in the main chain (θα, θγ, and θω) and side chains (θβ) are listed in the ESI (Table S1). The P4T trimer shows a large torsion angle of up to 84° (θα) between the 4T units (Fig. 8a), attributed to the steric hindrance between the neighboring pendent thiophene units. The remarkable torsion angle may disturb the π-conjugation within the P4Tpolymer chains, leading to the largest band gap among the 4T-based polymers. From the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 6), P4T exhibited a side-chain π → π* transition at approximately 300 nm, much stronger than the main-chain absorption near 400 nm. This may imply that the π–π stacking of the conjugated side chain of P4T is preferred, instead of that of the main chain. Through the incorporation of the spacer units, such as thiophene and selenophene, the main-chain torsional angles (θα) between the 4T unit and the spacer units are 38°, 36°, 16°, and 3° for P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe, and P4T2Se, respectively. These torsional angles are much smaller than that for P4T (84°). It suggests that the inserted spacers (unsubstituted thiophene and selenophene) can release the conformation distortion induced by the presence of pendent thiophene moieties. It is worth noting that the selenophene-based units exhibit the more significant reduction of conformation distortion in the main chain, compared to the thiophene-based units. This is probably due to the fact that the heteroatom selenium possesses lower ionization energy than sulfur and provides more delocalized π-electrons in the main chain, thus leading to the enhanced coplanarity of the polymer chains. Intriguingly, although the insertion of the spacer decreases the torsion within the main chain, it spontaneously causes the increase of the conformation distortion between pendent thiophene moieties and the main chain. The side-chain torsional angles (θβ) of the 4T-based polymers display the following order: P4T (18°) < P4TT (41°) < P4T2T (44°) < P4TSe (65°) < P4T2Se (85°), which is the reverse of the trend of the main chains. The distortion of the pendent thiophene may be attributed to the intramolecular repulsion between the sulfur atoms of the pendent thiophene and the heteroatoms of the ring spacers. It is evident that the side-chain distortion increases with the increased number of ring spacers. Moreover, as compared to the sulfur atom, the selenium atom causes a larger conformation distortion in the side chains due to the large atomic radius of selenium. Therefore, P4T2Se containing the diselenophene moiety exhibits the largest side-chain distortion among these 4T-based polymers. Despite the high coplanarity in the main chain, the highly twisted side chains (θβ = 85°) within P4T2Se may suppress the intermolecular π–π stacking in a thin-film state. It thus leads to a band gap slightly higher than that of P4TSe. These results indicate that the insertion of the spacer has a great influence on the conformation distortion in the main chain and side chain. Note that P4TSe displays the two pendent thiophene units near selenophene moieties on the same side, whereas those of P4TT, P4T2T and P4T2Se are on the opposite side. The non-symmetrical side-chain arrangement of P4TSe results in the longest distance (1.8 nm) between pendent thiophene moieties of neighbor repeating units among the 4T-based polymers, as shown in Fig. 8. This long distance may provide more space for the interdigitation of side chains, which is favorable for the self-organization of the polymer chains.


The influences of solvents and thermal annealing for the charge transporting polymer were investigated by using FET techniques. Table 2 is the summary of the electrical performance of the FETs. The FET mobility is calculated in the saturation regime by using the plot of the square root of drain-to-source current (Ids)1/2versus the gate voltage (Vg). The correlation between the Ids and other parameters is obtained using the following equation:
where
Ids is the drain-to-source current in the saturated region, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer, and Vg and Vt are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively. Fig. 9 shows the p-type output characteristics of the P4TSe and P4T2T and transfer characteristics of all studied polymers on the ODTS-modified substrate, which exhibit good current modulation, well-defined linear and saturation region. The maximum hole mobilities of the FETs prepared from P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se using chloroform (CF) as processing solvent are 1.34 × 10−8, 2.13 × 10−5, 2.54 × 10−3, 1.30 × 10−3 and 6.06 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Mixed solvents were used to improve the electrical performances of these FETs. By mixing a small amount of high-boiling-point solvent o-DCB into the CF solution, the FET mobilities of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 8.49 × 10−8, 1.12 × 10−5, 1.54 × 10−2, 2.12 × 10−2 and 8.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These mobilities of the 4T-based polymers were significantly enhanced, since mixing with high-boiling-point solvent o-DCB provides a longer evaporation time for the self-assembly packing of the polymer chains. Besides, thermal annealing largely affects the FET performances. When using CF/o-DCB as processing solvent and thermal annealing at 120 °C for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere, the maximum mobilities of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 4.61 × 10−7, 1.08 × 10−5, 1.06 × 10−2, 4.28 × 10−2 and 1.33 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This suggests that the thermal annealing could significantly improve the chain packing and the FET performance.

The FET performance of the 4T-based polymers is largely affected by the spacer ring number and the heteroatom. Without the addition of the ring spacer, P4T shows a low mobility of 4.61 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 on ODTS-treated wafer, despite using CF/o-DCB as processing solvent and thermal annealing. This may be attributed to the highly twisted main chain of P4T, disturbing the conjugation of π-electrons in the main chain. The large mismatch of the HOMO energy level (−5.5 eV) of P4T and the work function (−5.1 eV) of gold electrodes results in a large barrier for hole injection. The addition of the unsubstituted thiophene or selenophene ring as spacer significantly improves the FET characteristics due to the reduced steric hindrance of side chains. Therefore, P4T2T exhibited higher carrier mobility than P4TT and P4T because the bithiophene moiety provides more appropriate space to decrease the conformation distortions of the main chains and results in the stretched-out coplanar conformation. However, even though P4T2Se includes two unsubstituted selenophene units, it only shows a low carrier mobility of 1.33 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is due to the fact that the larger selenium atom possesses stronger intramolecular repulsion between the main backbone and bulky side chain. Thus, it induces the highly twisted side chain within P4T2Se suppressing the intermolecular π–π stacking in a thin-film state, even though P4T2Se has a highly coplanar main chain backbone. Among these polymers, P4TSe exhibits a remarkable mobility up to 4.28 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and on/off ratio of 1.12 × 104, probably attributed to the ordered molecular packing and the reduced main-chain torsional angles for enhancing charge transport. Furthermore, the carrier mobility of P4TSe is three orders of magnitude as high as that of P4TT, suggesting the strong intermolecular interaction of the selenium atom to assist in intermolecular packing.

Bulk heterojunction solar cell were fabricated with a sandwich configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm). The thickness of the active layers is around 80 nm. The active layers of the polymer devices were prepared through thermal annealing at 120 °C for 20 min. The J–V curves of polymer/PC71BM were measured in air after encapsulation with UV-curing glue, as shown in Fig. 10. The detailed photovoltaic properties including short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all 4T-based polymers are summarized in Table 3. The highest PCEs of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 0.1%, 1.51%, 2.44%, 2.60% and 0.66%, respectively. To understand the effects of hole and electron transport upon the power conversion efficiency, the hole and electron mobilities of polymer blends were measured, as shown in Table 3. The ratios of the hole and electron mobilities of P4T, P4TT, P4T2T, P4TSe and P4T2Se are 2.3 × 10−3, 9.3 × 10−4, 4.9 × 10−1, 4.5 × 10−2 and 6.6 × 10−3, respectively. P4T2T exhibited balanced transport mobility between holes and electrons, which corresponds to high Jsc. However, P4T2T-based devices have slightly lower PCE than P4TSe-based devices, probably due to the larger Eg of P4T2T. The relatively low PCEs of P4T and P4T2Se based devices are probably due to their relatively low hole mobilities. The highest PCE (2.6%) of the P4TSe/PC71BM device compared to other polymers resulted from more balanced hole/electron mobility and smaller band gap.

In this study, four 4T-based copolymers and homopolymer P4T were successfully synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization under microwave heating. 4T-based copolymers incorporating unsubstituted thiophene or selenophene rings were capable of reducing the conformation distortion in the main chain, which led to reduction of the band gap and enhanced the device performance significantly. The 4T-selenophene copolymers exhibited the more reduced conformation distortion in the main chain compared to the 4T-thiophene copolymers because of their lower ionization energy for promoting the delocalized π-electrons and enhancing the coplanarity. However, the side-chain torsional angles were increased with increasing the ring number, and thus significantly affected the FET characteristics. Among the studied polymers, P4TSe exhibited the highest hole mobility of up to 4.28 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, presumably due to the well-ordered interlayer alignment and strong π–π stacking. The PCE of the P4TSe/PC71BM bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell was up to 2.60%, resulting from its low optical band gap, more balanced hole/electron mobility, and low-lying HOMO energy level. The above results revealed that biaxially extended 4T-based conjugated copolymers with heteroaromatic rings could enhance the backbone coplanarity for increasing charge transport and photovoltaic properties.
