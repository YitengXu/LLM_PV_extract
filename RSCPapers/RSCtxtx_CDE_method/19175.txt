Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are a promising cost-effective alternative to silicon-based solar cells, and possess light-weight, low-cost, and flexibility advantages. Significant progress has been achieved in the development of novel photovoltaic materials and device structures in the last decade. Nowadays small molecular semiconductors for OPVs have attracted considerable attention, due to their advantages over their polymer counterparts, including well-defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, and high purity without batch to batch variations. The highest power conversion efficiencies of OPVs based on small molecular donor/fullerene acceptors or polymeric donor/fullerene acceptors are up to 6.7% and 8.3%, respectively, and meanwhile nonfullerene acceptors have also exhibited some promising results. In this review we summarize the developments in small molecular donors, acceptors (fullerene derivatives and nonfullerene molecules), and donor–acceptor dyad systems for high-performance multilayer, bulk heterojunction, and single-component OPVs. We focus on correlations of molecular chemical structures with properties, such as absorption, energy levels, charge mobilities, and photovoltaic performances. This structure–property relationship analysis may guide rational structural design and evaluation of photovoltaic materials (253 references).

Nowadays, fossil fuel (such as coal, oil, and gas) production and use gives rise to a mass of environmental problems, and also their stocks are diminishing. The need to develop renewable energy sources has become urgent. The development of photovoltaic cells (PVs), which transform inexhaustible solar energy into electricity, is therefore one of the most promising long-term solutions for clean, renewable energy. Currently, the main barrier that prevents PV technology from providing a large fraction of energy is the high cost of silicon-based PVs.

Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) are a promising cost-effective alternative to silicon-based solar cells, and possess low-cost, light-weight, and flexibility advantages. Contemporary OPVs are based on a heterojunction resulting from the contact of an electron donor (D) and an electron acceptor (A) material. Absorption of solar photons creates excitons, which diffuse to the D/A interface, where they are dissociated into free holes and electrons, and opposite polarity carriers (holes and electrons) transport through the donor and acceptor channels to anodes and cathodes respectively, subsequently charges are collected at the electrodes, resulting in the generation of electrical power. D/A heterojunctions can be created with two main types of architectures, bilayer heterojunction and bulk heterojunction (BHJ).
Before the mid 1980s, in conventional OPVs, a single layer of single component organic material was sandwiched between two different electrodes with different work functions. In these single-layer and single-component cells, the built-in potential is derived from either a Schottky-type potential barrier at one of the metal/organic contacts or the difference in work function of the electrodes, and the photovoltaic properties are strongly dependent on the nature of the electrodes. These early OPVs showed very poor performance.
In 1986, Tang fabricated a bilayer heterojunction solar cell with an efficiency approaching 1%, which was a milestone in the development of OPVs. Bilayer heterojunction architecture has been intensively investigated and still is an invaluable tool for the evaluation of new active materials, nevertheless, performance of OPVs based on this structure is limited by the short exciton diffusion length in organic materials (typically 5–20 nm). Since the exciton dissociation process is confined to the D/A interfacial zone, only excitons produced at a distance shorter than their diffusion length have a good probability to reach the interfacial zone and generate free charge carriers. So the exciton diffusion length limits the maximum thickness of the active layer and thus the maximum fraction of the incident light that the cell can absorb and covert into electricity.
In 1991, Hiramoto et al. fabricated a novel type of three-layered OPV with a codeposited interlayer of mixed pigments between the respective pigment layers, and the interlayer acted as an efficient carrier photogeneration layer. Actually, this type OPV device is the predecessor of hybrid planar-mixed molecular heterojunction (PMHJ) OPVs. And the mixed interlayer was recognized as the first bulk heterojunction layer in small molecule-based OPVs.
In 1992, Sariciftci et al. demonstrated that photoexcitation of a mixture of a conjugated polymer and fullerene (C60) resulted in an ultrafast, highly efficient photoinduced electron transfer. And then Yu et al. and Halls et al. created the “bulk heterojunction” (BHJ) concept, which is one of the best OPV device architectures so far. BHJ is a blend of bicontinuous and interpenetrating donor and acceptor components in a bulk volume. Such a nanoscale network exhibits a D/A phase separation in a 5–20 nm length scale, which is within a distance less than the exciton diffusion length. Compared to bilayer heterojunction, BHJ significantly increases the D/A interfacial area, leading to enhanced efficiency of the OPV devices.
Two or even more OPV cells can be stacked on top of each other to form a tandem OPV structure, which enables one to resolve two limiting factors existing intrinsically among organic semiconductor molecules: poor charge carrier mobility and a narrow light absorption range.
The bilayer heterojunction and BHJ OPV device structures are shown in Fig. 1. In the two devices, the photoactive layers both sandwiched between a high work function anode, typically a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, and a relatively low work function metal cathode, such as Ca, Al. In the bilayer heterojunction device, the donor materials stick to the anode and the acceptor materials stick to the cathode, while the active layer is blend of donor and acceptor materials in BHJ device. In principle, there are two processing techniques for the fabrication of OPV devices, vacuum deposition and solution processing. Generally, the bilayer heterojunction was fabricated by vacuum deposition since it is difficult to find suitable solvents for donor layer and acceptor layer without destroying the D/A interface. And both of the two processing techniques are suitable for the BHJ devices. Some of small molecules such as metal phthalocyanine and C60 can be deposited under high vacuum conditions by thermal evaporation. By coevaporation of donor and acceptor materials, BHJ layers can be obtained. On the other hand, soluble materials can be deposited from solution, by spin coating, inkjet printing, gravure or flexographic printing.
In OPV devices, principal figures-of-merit include power conversion efficiency (PCE), short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF), defining, respectively, the ratio between the output device electrical energy versus the input solar energy, the device current density when no reverse bias is applied, and the device voltage when no current flows through the cell, and the ratio between maximum power of the device and JSC × VOC.
The photoactive materials, including polymeric and small molecular semiconductors, play a key role in influencing physical processes involved in energy conversion, which in turn determine the electrical characteristics of the solar cell, such as JSC, VOC, and FF, and ultimately PCE. Recently, OPVs based on a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and a fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61 (or C71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM) as an acceptor have been rapidly developing, and so far the highest reported PCEs of this type OPVs are up to 8.3%, but still below 10% that is often regarded as being a prerequisite for large-scale commercial applications. On the other hand, small molecular semiconductors for OPVs have attracted considerable attention, due to their advantages over their polymer counterparts, which include well-defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, and high purity without batch to batch variations. An increasing number of publications on OPVs based on small molecules have appeared, the PCEs of devices based on small molecule donors and fullerene acceptors fabricated by vacuum deposition or solution processing are both in excess of 6%. As for small molecule acceptors, compared to the fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM and PC71BM, the development of nonfullerene small molecular acceptors has been lagged with relatively low performance. Recently, research on nonfullerene acceptors has become more active due to their interesting potentials, such as convenient synthesis, low cost, easy tunability of energy levels, and perhaps most importantly, better absorption in the visible spectrum.
A number of reviews have summarized the synthesis and application of conjugated polymeric active materials, small molecular donors, fullerene acceptors, small molecular nonfullerene acceptors in OPVs as well as device physics. In the present review, we focus on the representative small molecular donors, acceptors and donor–acceptor dyads in single OPVs. Progress in the past decade has been substantial, but continued development of OPV materials will require a better understanding of the relationships between molecular structure, electronic structure, materials microstructure, charge transport and photovoltaic properties than is currently available. For these reasons, we will survey and analyze what is currently known concerning structure/property relationships of photovoltaic small molecules.

Small molecular semiconductors can be generally classified as hole or electron transporting (p-type or n-type) materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers, under a given set of conditions, stemming from removal of electrons from the filled molecular orbitals or from the addition of electrons to empty orbitals, respectively. Many small molecular p-type semiconductors have been studied for decades. Among these molecules, only a small fraction has been applied successfully as electron donors in OPV devices due to the various optical, electrical, and stability requirements demanded of the chosen materials. The properties of materials, such as hole mobility (i.e., the distance over which holes are transported per second under the unit electric field), exciton diffusion length, thin film morphology, frontier energy level alignment, band gap, and absorption coefficient, all greatly affect the performance of OPV device. In this section, some representative small molecular donors such as dyes, fused acenes, oligothiophenes, and triphenylamine-based molecules used in the active layer of OPVs are described and discussed.


Of a variety of small molecular donors that have been reported in the literature, dye-based molecules are first and common. Several famous classes of dyes are believed to be potential materials in OPVs, such as phthalocyanine (Pc), subphthalocyanine (SubPc), merocyanine (MC), squaraine (SQ), diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPP), borondipyrromethene (BODIPY), isoindigo (ID), perylene diimides (PDI), and quinacridone (QD). As several groups have demonstrated, functionalizing a dye molecule has been confirmed to be a successful approach to donor design. Table 1 provides a summary of electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative dye-based donors (Fig. 2).

Pc, comprising four isoindole units connected by 1,3-aza linkages, is a planar and highly aromatic 18-π-electron macrocycle. Pc derivatives typically exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stability, and they also offer flexibility in their optical and electronic properties through synthetic modifications, such as attaching functional groups to the molecule perimeter. The optoelectronic properties and stacking in the solid state of Pc derivatives can be turned by replacing of the two protons in the molecular cavity with a metal ion. Although many metal Pc complexes have been used in OPVs, CuPc (a1) and ZnPc (a2) have been the most common choices to date for application in Pc-based OPV devices, due to longer exciton diffusion length of CuPc and ZnPc as compared to the other Pcs.
In 1986, CuPc was first used as a donor material in bilayer heterojunction OPV by Tang, and the device showed a PCE value of 1%. Inspired by this pioneering contribution, Pc has been commonly applied in vacuum-deposited OPV devices, due to high absorption coefficient and long exciton diffusion length. And Pcs are frequently paired with fullerenes in the OPV active layer. The CuPc/C60 combination is among the most common for small molecule OPV active layers at present, and devices deriving from this system exhibited high performance. In 2001, Forrest and Peumans demonstrated that bilayer heterojunction OPVs based on CuPc and C60 with PCE of 3.6% can be achieved under 150 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G illumination, while the BHJ OPVs based on a mixture of vacuum codeposited CuPc and C60 were fabricated and the best PCE was up to 3.5% at 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G illumination. Later, Forrest et al. fabricated an OPV structure with a planar-mixed heterojunction (PMHJ), i.e., a mixed layer consisting of CuPc and C60 sandwiched between homogeneous CuPc and C60 layers, and the device afforded a maximum PCE of 5.0%, at 120 mW cm−2 under simulated AM1.5 solar illumination. Additionally, stacking two of these cells together in a tandem cell resulted in a ca. 15% increase in device performance and a PCE of 5.7% at 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 simulated solar illumination.
Planar Pcs have relatively narrow absorption band and cannot effectively absorb low-energy photons, while ca. 50% of photons in the solar spectrum have energies corresponding to wavelength of 600–1000 nm. Nonplanar Pc molecules, such as chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (AlClPc, a3), exhibited an absorption peak in the near-infrared around 755 nm and harvested a greater percentage of infrared photons. The out-of-plane Cl atom bonded to the central Al atom with square-pyramidal geometry strongly influences the molecular packing, inducing an interleaved slip-stack arrangement and significant red shift in absorption compared to CuPc (maximum absorption wavelength of ca. 630 nm). Additionally, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements indicate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of a3 is shifted to −5.4 eV, ca. 0.1 eV farther from vacuum than that of a1, which is beneficial for an increased VOC. The optimized a3/C60 bilayer devices exhibit an overall improvement in PCE from 1.8% of a1/C60 bilayer devices to 2.1%.
Oxo-titanium phthalocyanine (a4) has also been applied in the OPV devices as donor materials leading to both a higher absorbance at long wavelengths and an increased VOC in a4/C60 bilayer OPV devices as compared to a1. The studies of a4 films have determined that vapor deposition results in the formation of at least two distinct phases with different absorption spectrum. In 2009, Armstrong et al. reported that polymorph a4 film has changed to crystalline form that absorbs light at the longest wavelengths by exposure of the as-deposited thin film to concentrated solvent vapors (solvent annealing). The optimized OPVs based on a4 showed a relatively high PCE of 4.2%, with JSC of 15.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.57 V, and FF of 0.53.
A metal-free Pc (a5) with aliphatic side chains was one of the earliest small molecule donors in solution-processed BHJ OPVs. The reported a5-based devices were prepared by spin-casting a mixed solution of a5 and PDI derivative (f3, Fig. 7) in chloroform. These very first reported devices exhibited poor device performance, but recent work has shown that Pc derivatives are viable donors for application in solution-processed BHJ OPVs. Significantly improved performance was realized by using a combination of three ZnPc-based donors and a fullerene acceptor to give PCE of 0.12%, with a JSC of 1.24 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.41 V, and FF of 0.24.
The OPVs based on Pcs showed relatively low VOC (generally less than 0.6 V), which was one of factors limiting the PCEs of OPVs. The VOC value generally depends on the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMO) of the acceptor and HOMO energy of the donor. Thus, one way to increase the VOC is to lower the HOMO level of donor materials. In 2006, Thompson and coworkers reported a subphthalocyanine (a6)/C60-based bilayer heterojunction OPV. Due to the deep HOMO level of a6, the devices exhibited much higher VOC (0.97 V) as compared to conventional devices based on CuPc/C60 bilayer heterojunction (0.42 V), without a concomitant reduction in JSC, resulting in enhancement in PCE from 0.9% to 2.1%. Gommans et al. reported a higher JSC (5.4 mA cm−2) and higher PCE (3.0%) from this device architecture.
In 2009, solution processing of subnaphthalocyanine (SubNc, a7) was carried out for the first time to form a donor layer in efficient bilayer heterojunction OPVs. Due to its unique properties, such as good solubility, low tendency to aggregate, and strong light absorption in the visible region, amorphous a7 films with good charge transporting and light-harvesting properties can be prepared via simple solution casting. The a7/C60 bilayer device based on solution processed a7 donor layer demonstrated a PCE of 1.5%, with a JSC of 5.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.55 V, and FF of 0.49 after thermal annealing at 120 °C for 40 min. At the same time, Verreet et al. reported that the a7/C60 bilayer OPVs based on vacuum deposited a7 donor layer produced a higher PCE of 2.5%, with JSC of 6.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.79 V, and FF of 0.49. The decreased VOC as compared to that of a6-based devices results from greater conjugation imparted by the additional benzene rings in a7, which raises the HOMO energy level. However, the benzene rings are also responsible for the shift in absorption to longer wavelengths and a resultant improvement of JSC, compared to a6-based OPVs.
Merocyanine (MC) dye-based molecules offer high absorption coefficients (usually over 1 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and sufficiently large variability in the position of the HOMO and LUMO levels. In 2008, Würthner, Meerholz and coworkers have successfully applied MC dyes in solution-processed BHJ OPVs for the first time. The optimized PCEs were up to 1.54% or 1.74% for blends of MC dyes (a8 or a9):PC61BM. Later, they modified the push–pull dye a8 with a flexible alkyl chain to achieve more efficient photovoltaic molecules by bridging the electron donating unit with a propylene group in a10 to diminish the flexibility of the structure and to ensure a more planar geometry.a10 exhibited relatively high hole mobility of 5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, five times of that for a8. Solution-processed devices based on a a10:PC61BM blend showed a JSC of 8.24 mA cm−2, larger than that of a8:PC61BM (5.30 mA cm−2), resulting in a remarkably improved PCE of 2.59%. Moreover, vacuum processed BHJ OPVs based on a10 and C60 were also fabricated, and the best vacuum processed device showed a promising PCE of 4.9%. More recently, a PCE of 6.1% was achieved by introducing MoO3 instead of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as hole-collecting contact sandwiched between the active layer and anode after solvent annealing in CH2Cl2 for 10 min. They developed a new dye a11 for application in solution-processed OPVs, the optimized device showed a PCE of 4.5% with a VOC of 1.0 V. They reported a parallel-BHJ cell that forms in situ driven by dipolar intermolecular forces when mixing two merocyanine dyes with complementary absorption as double-donors with C60 acceptor. By optimizing the ratio of the two donor components and the thickness of the active layer, the PCE (3.2%) of the blend donor cells was higher than either (2.6–2.7%) of the reference devices based on the individual dyes only. This synergetic effect is attributed to a more efficient photon harvesting efficiency of the mixed donor cells compared to either of the single donor devices. MC dyes show a great potential for the application in highly efficient tandem solar cells. Very recently, a dye a8 and C60-based novel tandem-cell device architecture, combining bilayer and bulk heterojunctions, was fabricated by fully vacuum depositing, consisting of only four organic layers. The optimized PCE was up to 4.8%, with a strikingly high VOC of 2.1 V, which is the highest VOC value reported for small molecule tandem solar cells. Würthner et al. also investigated the charge dissociation at the D/A heterointerface of thermally evaporated bilayer heterojunction MC dye (an analog with propyl replacing butyl in a8)/C60 OPVs, where they found that the FF value can be improved by evaporating the dye film on a heated substrate or post-annealing the completed devices above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of this MC donor. The optimized bilayer device showed PCE up to 3.9% with very high FF of 0.70.
Squaraine (SQ) has been effectively applied to small molecule OPV devices. The SQ dye-based molecules showed broad absorption from 500 to 900 nm in the film, high absorption coefficients (over 1 × 105 M−1 cm−1), good photochemical and thermal stability. In 2008, Marks and coworkers reported that a series of SQ-based molecules exhibited promising performance in solution processed BHJ OPV, and the optimized a12-based device processed in air exhibited a PCE of 1.24%. Subsequently, the structure modification by using hexenyl groups (a13) instead of 2-ethylhexyl side chains improved the device PCE up to 1.99% after thermal annealing at 50 °C for 30 min. Würthner, Meerholz and coworkers replaced the ketone on the SQ moiety with dicyanovinyl group (a14), leading to increased crystallinity and relatively high hole mobility (1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing). The BHJ device based on a14 and PC61BM (annealing at 110 °C for 5 min) showed a PCE of 1.79%, with an unusually high JSC of up to 12.6 mA cm−2, a high FF of 0.47, but a rather low VOC of 0.31 V. Thompson, Forrest and coworkers also recently reported a SQ-based molecule (a15) as donor in OPVs. Initially, a15 was used to fabricate bilayer heterojunction OPVs by vacuum deposition, which exhibited a PCE of 3.2% under 1 sun, AM1.5G simulated solar irradiation. Later, bilayer devices using solution processed a15 layers with evaporated C60 layers were found to have a higher PCE of 4.1%, while the BHJ device achieved a PCE of 2.9%. Recently, they found that post-annealing through additional extended exposure of the blend to dichloromethane can lead to control of the nanoscale phase separation of a15:PC71BM (1:6) blend films and an optimized morphology reduces series resistance. By optimizing morphology and molecular ordering of the a15:PC71BM BHJ OPVs, a peak PCE of 5.5% has been achieved, with a maximum cell performance achieved when the exciton diffusion length is approximately equal to the mean a15 crystallite size. This result suggests that the high BHJ OPV performance could be achieved by the precise structural control of phase separation. Furthermore, they developed a series of new SQ-based dyes; the optimized a16/C60 bilayer device with using solution processed a16 layer with evaporated C60 layer showed the best OPV performance after thermal annealing at 90 °C: PCE of 5.7%, JSC of 10.0 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.90 V, and FF of 0.64. Crystallographic data suggest that the intermolecular stacking of a16 molecules is closer than that of a15, thereby reducing the device series resistance and increasing its fill factor.
Roncali and coworkers firstly reported borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives as photovoltaic materials. This type of dyes can be used as a platform for the design of donor materials owing to a unique combination of facile synthesis, good stability, and high absorption coefficients. Additionally, based on the presence of a tetrahedral boron atom in the structure, BODIPY appears as an interesting potential of isotropic active materials for OPVs. In a first exploration of BODIPY-based donors, the dyes a17 and a18 were synthesized and applied in BHJ OPVs blending with PC61BM acceptor. The absorption spectra of a17 and a18 show a maximum at 572 and 646 nm, respectively, with high molecular extinction coefficients (1.0–1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1). The OPV cells based on a17 or a18:PC61BM (1:2) delivered PCE of 1.17% or 1.34%. Combining these two dyes with complementary absorption characteristics and blending with PC61BM, the devices were fabricated showing broad IPCE (the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency, i.e., the current obtained outside the photovoltaic device per incoming photon) spectrum from 350 to 700 nm, yielding a PCE of 1.7%, with a JSC of 4.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.87 V, and FF of 0.42. Bithiophene was incorporated into a18 to build the new molecule a19, leading to improved hole mobility of 9.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 from 5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a18, while retaining the broad and strong absorption of BODIPY. The BHJ OPV based on a19 and PC61BM showed an improved JSC of 7.0 mA cm−2 and PCE of 2.2%.
Due to several attractive properties of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes for photovoltaic applications, such as strong light absorption, good photochemical stability, and facile synthetic modification, Nguyen et al. have applied a series of DPP-based materials in solution processable BHJ OPVs. In 2008, they explored the first soluble DPP-based molecule (a20) with terthiophene arms as a donor blending with PC61BM; the BHJ device exhibited a JSC of 8.42 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.67 V, FF of 0.45, and an overall PCE of 2.3%. However, inherent aspects of this material limit the device performance, including high HOMO energy level, potential morphological instability from the thermally labile alkyl group, and imbalance of carrier mobilities (hole mobility of 5 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility (i.e., the distance over which electrons are transported per second under the unit electric field) of 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 as measured using single-carrier diodes). By using 2-ethylhexyl group instead of t-Boc substituent in a20, the new DPP-based molecule (a21) showed deeper HOMO level (−5.2 eV), improved morphological and thermal stability, and balanced carrier mobilities when blending with PC71BM (hole mobility of 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Owing to these improvements, the OPVs based on a21:PC71BM (1:1) exhibited a PCE of 3.0%, with JSC of 9.2 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.75 V, and FF of 0.44. The OPV performance of DPP-based materials was further improved by replacing hexylbithiophene end groups with benzofuran (a22). Blending a22 with PC71BM, very little phase separation was apparent in the as-cast film. However, thermal annealing leads to suitable phase separation so that effective BHJ morphologies are obtained. The degree of phase separation can be controlled by adjusting annealing temperature; 110 °C yielded optimum device properties: JSC of 10 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.9 V, FF of 0.48, and PCE of 4.4%. In 2010, Luscombe et al. incorporated selenophene into DPP-based molecules as the donor material in BHJ OPVs; the optimized devices based on an a23:PC61BM (1:1) blend showed a PCE of 1.53%, with a JSC of 4.9 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.77 V, and FF of 0.41. Recently Fréchet and coworkers reported a series of DPP-based donors with different end groups, and demonstrated that efficient OPV materials can be constructed by attaching planar, symmetric end groups to electroactive small molecules. π–π interaction of molecule a24 dictated tight, aligned crystal packing, favorable morphology, and promoted intermolecular connectivity, so OPV devices based on blend of a24:PC71BM (2:1) exhibited a maximum PCE of 4.1% with a FF approaching 0.6. Marks and coworkers first implemented naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (NDT) in donor materials for BHJ OPVs. The molecule (a25) with NDT as core and DPP as arms was synthesized and showed high absorption coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at maximum absorption of 624 nm, appropriate HOMO energy level (−5.4 eV), and relatively high hole mobility of up to 7.18 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Combined with the electron acceptor PC61BM, a high PCE of 4.06% was achieved, with a JSC of 11.27 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.84 V, and FF of 0.42, by annealing at 110 °C for 10 min.
Similar to DPP structure, isoindigo (ID) and perylene diimide (PDI) both have symmetrical lactam structure with strong electron withdrawing property. Reynolds et al. reported synthesis of a26 based on ID as core and bithiophene as arms and application in solution processed BHJ OPVs as donor material. After annealing at 110 °C, the device based on a26:PC61BM (1:1) gave a PCE of 1.76%; the PCE was increased to 2.15% by adding a polydimethylsiloxane additive, due to more favorable morphology. Ko and coworkers reported annulated thiophene PDI linked with triphenylamine through a bithiophene bridge (a27), and BHJ OPV based on a27:PC61BM (1:2) showed JSC of 5.94 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.776 V, FF of 0.308 and PCE of 1.42%.
Fréchet and coworkers reported a series of multifunctional linear quinacridone (QD)-based molecules which showed intense absorption in the visible spectral region, and the absorption range and intensity were well-tuned by the interaction between the QD core and the incorporated thiophene arms. A solution processed thin film of a28:PC71BM (1:2) showed bicontinuous nanophase separated morphology, which was feasible for exciton dissociation and charge transport. a28-based device gave a PCE of 2.22%, under an AM1.5 simulated solar illumination.
In dyes, Pc, MC, and DPP-based molecules have exhibited very high performance in OPVs with PCE values over 6%, which can be partially attributed to the strong absorption of these materials. Interestingly, some dyes (e.g., BODIPY and MC) with very similar structures can show very different and complementary absorption spectra while retain compatibility of other properties. Thus, multicomponent devices can be fabricated by mixing two dyes as double-donors with fullerene acceptor, and better device performance can be achieved, which may deserve further attention.

In organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), fused acenes, such as pentacene and tetracene, have been extensively studied as a p-type semiconductor, and especially, pentacene is well known to exhibit extremely high hole mobility (over 1 cm2 V−1 s−1). The high mobility is a key factor to enhance the PCEs of OPV devices. This type of materials has been successfully applied in vacuum deposited bilayer or solution processed BHJ OPVs, due to their high hole mobility, broad absorption and good thermal stability. Table 2 provides a summary of electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative fused acene donors (Fig. 3).

In 2004, Kippelen et al. first fabricated an efficient OPV based on a bilayer heterojunction of polycrystalline pentacene (b1) and C60. Under illumination of broadband light 100 mW cm−2, the device exhibited a JSC of 15 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.36 V, FF of 0.50, and PCE of 2.7%. Obviously, in this device the most limiting factor is the low VOC. JSC and PCE were projected to be around 8.2 mA cm−2 and 1.5% under AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2. In 2005, Yang et al. fabricated bilayer heterojunction OPVs with tetracene (b2)/C60 as the photoactive layer. The PCEs of the devices were 2.3% under AM1.5 solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2.
Researchers have tried to use the fused acenes for applications in solution processable BHJ OPVs by properly functionalizing with solubilizing groups such as triisopropylsilylethynyl (b3). Unsubstituted pentacene adopts a herringbone motif in solid state, while 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene exhibits a structural improvement in solid state, promoting face-to-face instead of face-to-edge (herringbone) packing, leading to close cofacial π-stacking. Such modification offers tunability of the π-orbital overlap and therefore control of intrinsic charge carrier mobility, an important parameter for OPV applications. b3 can be crystallized in film and absorb farther into the red than pentacene, theoretically leading to higher photocurrent and PCE. Unfortunately, b3 rapidly undergoes a Diels–Alder reaction with fullerene derivatives in solution, and b3-fullerene adduct ineffectively supports photoinduced charge transfer. Hereby, Anthony, Malliaras and coworkers fabricated a bilayer device (spin-coated b3 layer and vacuum-deposited C60 layer), where adduct formation can be minimized. After optimization of photoactive layer thickness, incorporation of exciton-blocking layer, and thermal annealing, PCE reached a peak value of 0.5%. Triethylsilylethynyl-substituted anthradithiophene (b4) exhibited an absorption cutoff of 575 nm in film and a high hole mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1. As-cast b4:PC61BM (7:3) film was fairly amorphous and did not generate large photocurrent. Solvent (dichloromethane) vapor annealing of these blends led to the formation of spherulites, which is consisted of a network of b4 crystallites dispersed in an amorphous matrix composed primarily of PC61BM. The spherulite covered fraction of the film appeared rough with submicrometer, needle-like crystals, which led to a marked improvement in photocurrent generating capacity. The generated photocurrent was proportional to the area covered by spherulites. Devices with 82% spherulite coverage gave the best PCE of 1.0%, with a JSC of 2.96 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.84 V and FF of 0.40.
Thompson et al. synthesized triethylsilylethynyl-substituted tetracene monomer (b5) and dimer (b6). The PCE of bilayer OPV device based on b5 and C60 was 0.5%, with VOC of 1.06 V, JSC of 1.48 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.34. The VOC (0.31 V) for the dimer (b6) based device was substantially lower than that for the monomer based device, leading to lower PCE (0.2%), and the main reason might be that b6 has higher HOMO energy level (−5.16 eV) than that (−5.36 eV) of b5.
In 2008, Marrocchi and coworkers reported BHJ OPV devices based on an anthracene derivative (b7):PC61BM (1:1.17) blend with a PCE of 1.12%. They found that an acetylenic spacer yielded significantly better OPV performance than an olefinic spacer in this system. The optimized OPV device based on b7:PC61BM (2:1) showed a JSC of 3.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.89 V, FF of 0.45, and overall improved PCE of 1.27% upon thermal annealing at 60 °C. In 2010, Chung et al. reported triisopropylsilylethynyl anthracene derivative substituted with bithiophene (b8). The BHJ OPVs were fabricated by blending b8 with PC61BM (1:1–4). As varying the blending ratio, the blend film morphology changed from obvious phase-segregated crystalline domains at 1:1 ratio to homogeneous, nearly amorphous phases at 1:4 ratio. At the ratio of 1:4, BHJ OPVs yielded a PCE of 1.4%, higher than that for other ratios, revealing that well-mixed homogeneous phases, rather than highly crystalline phases, resulted in improved PCE by allowing for efficient charge separation.
In 2009, Watkins and coworkers reported a new class of organic semiconductors based on dibenzo[b,def]chrysene (DBC). In contrast to well-studied pentacenes, DBC derivatives did not undergo cycloaddition reactions with fullerenes. In the BHJ OPVs, one successful result was obtained by using a mixture of triethylsilylethynyl-substituted DBC (b9) and PC61BM spin-casted from chloroform solution. Casting solvents played an important role in determining crystallinity and morphology. High boiling point solvent such as chlorobenzene led to larger scale of phase separation, and reduced interfacial area, resulting in very low device efficiency. Spin-casted BHJ films from low boiling point solvent such as chloroform showed phase separation at the nanoscale, which benefited more efficient dissociation of the photogenerated excitons and collection of separated charges. At high concentration and high spin speed, the BHJ films from chloroform have been well modified to enhance the PCE of OPV devices. Hereby the optimized device showed a JSC of 6.55 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.83 V, FF of 0.41 and PCE of 2.25%. Very recently, triisopropylsilylethynyl-functionalized dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene (b10) with similar structure to b9 was synthesized and applied to fabricate OPV devices. The primary BHJ OPVs based on b10:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 1.95%, lower than that of b9.
In 2001 Friend and coworkers used a discotic liquid crystalline hexaperihexabenzocoronene (HBC) derivative (b11) in combination with a PDI acceptor (f3, Fig. 7) to fabricate solution-processed OPVs with a PCE of 1.95% at 490 nm (0.47 mW cm−2). Recently, Holmes and coworkers reported synthesis of difluorenyl-substituted HBC (b12) and its use in OPVs. Devices based on a blend of b12:PC61BM (1:2) after thermal annealing at 150 °C generated JSC of 2.68 mA cm−2 and PCE of 1.46%. Later, they attached oligothiophene to b12 to yield b13. Relative to b12, b13 has extended conjugation and broader absorption. The BHJ OPVs based on b13:PC71BM (1:2) exhibited higher JSC (5.71 mA cm−2) and higher PCE (2.64%) relative to the devices based on b12:PC71BM (1:2) (JSC of 2.53 mA cm−2 and PCE of 1.0%).
Most fused acenes possess high crystallinity and relatively high mobility, and these materials show moderate photovoltaic performance in vacuum deposited bilayer devices. For solution-processed BHJ devices, high crystallinity of fused acenes leads to large phase separation scale when blending with fullerene acceptor, which causes decreased device performance. Thus, tuning the crystallinity of fused acenes by modifying their substituent groups is necessary to achieve high performance BHJ devices based on fused acenes.

Oligothiophenes, including one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional conjugated systems, are one of the largest families of organic semiconductors, and have been widely used in OPVs due to their high charge-carrier mobility and facile synthesis to tune energy levels.Table 3 summarizes electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative one, two and three dimensional oligothiophenes (Fig. 4).

BHJ OPVs based on blend of α-sexithiophene (c1) and C70 were fabricated by the vacuum coevaporation method. Since c1 was easy to aggregate and crystallize, it was difficult to mix homogeneously c1 and C70 at a blend ratio of 1:1 (w/w), leading to insufficient formation of carrier transport network and charge separation. When c1:C70 ratio was 1:5 (w/w), excessive C70 prevented c1 from crystallization, leading to formation of amorphous structure, so that charge separation efficiency was improved and desirable carrier transport interpenetrating network was formed. After thermal annealing at 140 °C for 20 min, the OPV devices exhibited a PCE of 2.38%. However, narrow absorption and relatively high HOMO level of c1 limited JSC and VOC of OPVs, respectively. To achieve high-efficiency OPVs, conjugated oligothiophenes with low band gap, broad absorption and appropriate energy levels are required. One successful approach is to introduce electron withdrawing units into the conjugated backbone to form D–A oligothiophenes with highly polarizable π-electron systems, which can extend the absorption spectrum of the donor toward longer wavelengths by an intramolecular charge transfer and thus have a good match with the solar spectrum.
The dicyanovinyl (DCV) group has strong electron-withdrawing properties leading to efficient intramolecular charge transfer. Some DCV-substituted oligothiophenes have been synthesized and applied in vacuum-deposited and solution-processed OPVs. In 2006, Bäuerle, Leo and coworkers fabricated bilayer heterojunction OPVs based on terminally DCV-substituted oligothiophenes bearing butyl side chains (c2) as donor and C60 as acceptor. Due to low HOMO level and red-shifted absorption of c2, these OPVs afforded PCEs of up to 3.4%, with high VOC of 0.98 V, JSC of 10.6 mA cm−2 at 118 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight. Later, they used selenophene instead of thiophene in c2 to synthesize a series of c2 analogs. Selenophene-containing oligomers showed slightly lower performance due to lower degree of donor/acceptor phase separation compared to c2 in BHJ OPVs, but PCE was still in a good range of 2.5–3.1%. Recently, they synthesized a series of terminally DCV-substituted oligothiophenes without solubilizing side chains via a novel convergent approach and used them as electron donors in vacuum-processed bilayer heterojunction and BHJ OPVs. OPV devices incorporating c3 and C60 showed PCEs of up to 2.8% for bilayer heterojunction and 5.2% for BHJs under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
In 2010, Chen and coworkers reported the synthesis of a DCV-substituted oligothiophene with six solubilizing side chains (c4) and application in solution-processed BHJ OPVs. Absorption spectra of c4 films showed good solar spectral coverage. Hole mobility of pristine c4 was 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. Under illumination of 100 mW cm−2, the devices based on c4:PC61BM blend (1:1.4) displayed a PCE of 3.7%, with JSC of 12.4 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.88 V, and FF of 0.34. Carefully designing and controlling the position and density of different alkyl side or end chains can not only increase solubility of materials in organic solvents for spin-casting devices but also improve their packing structure and solid-state miscibility with fullerenes. Recently, Chen and coworkers designed and synthesized a series of oligothiophenes end-capped with electron-withdrawing alkyl cyanoacetate groups instead of DCV and investigated the correlation between these different end groups and their BHJ device performance. OPVs based on c5:PC61BM (2:1) exhibited a PCE of 5.08%, with a JSC of 10.74 mA cm−2VOC of 0.86 V and FF of 0.55. Compared to c4 with DCV end group, c5 with alkyl cyanoacetate end group gave higher PCEs. The better PCEs benefited from improved FF (over 50%), which came from better film quality and morphology. Later, 3-ethylrhodanine was introduced as an end acceptor group to synthesize oligothiophene c6.c6 showed stronger solar absorption than c5, which is beneficial to improving the JSC. A very high PCE of 6.10% was obtained by using a blend of c6:PC61BM as the active layer, with a remarkable JSC of 13.98 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.92 V. Meanwhile, they replaced the central thiophene unit in c5 with a more electron-rich and planar structure such as benzodithiophene and dithienosilole to synthesize c7 and c8. Improved mobility and absorption of c7 and c8 led to enhanced PCEs (5.44% for c7 and 5.84% for c8). The high PCE values 5.08–6.10% of c5–c8 based devices suggest that the oligothiophenes with electron-withdrawing end groups are very promising donor materials for solution processed BHJ OPVs. In addition, Roncali et al. synthesized a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical septithiophenes end-capped with DCV and thiobarbituric (TB) electron-withdrawing groups, and investigated their photovoltaic properties in bilayer OPVs based on spin-coated donor layer and vacuum-deposited C60 acceptor layer. They found an interesting phenomenon that breaking the symmetry of the donor structure can lead to a significant increase of VOC, which may be attributed to the intermolecular interactions and molecular orientation.
Other electron withdrawing units such as benzothiadiazole (BT), thiadiazolopyridine (TP) and trifluoroacetyl (TFA) were also introduced into oligothiophene systems. Bäuerle and coworkers reported two linear oligothiophenes c9 and c10 end-capped with BT and TP acceptor units, respectively. Bilayer heterojunction OPVs based on c10 and C60 showed a higher PCE (3.15%) with a very high FF (0.67) compared to that of c9-based devices (1.73%). The excellent FF, which is among the highest values reported for small molecule-based OPVs, might be due to better stacking in thin film caused by intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions by the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring. In 2010, Fréchet and coworkers reported a series of platinum-acetylide linear oligothiophenes containing a thienyl-BT-thienyl core, and various oligothiophenes were connected to control the molecular packing by changing the number of thiophene units from two to four. The best device based on the oligomer with terthiophene (c11) blending with PC71BM (1:4) after annealing at 70 °C for 30 min exhibited a JSC of 8.45 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.82 V, FF of 0.43, and PCE of 3.0%. Recently, Bazan and coworkers introduced dithienosilole (DTS) in oligothiophenes. The DTS-containing oligothiophenes showed broad absorption extending beyond 700 nm, due to intramolecular charge transfer. After annealing at 110 °C for 2 min, BHJ OPVs based on c12:PC71BM (3:2) showed a JSC of 10.9 mA cm−2 and PCE of 3.2%. Later, Heeger, Bazan and coworkers synthesized one novel isomeric compound (c13) of c12, and used it to fabricate solution processed BHJ OPVs. Compound c13 exhibited strong optical absorption, especially from 600 to 800 nm, and a high hole mobility of ca. 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by organic field-effect transistor (OFET). Under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), a record PCE of 6.7% was achieved for small-molecule donor based BHJ devices from c13:PC71BM (7:3, w/w). This high efficiency was obtained by adding remarkably low percentage of solvent additive (0.25% v/v of 1,8-diiodooctane) during the film-forming process, which led to decreased domain sizes in the BHJ layer. Additionally, the low fraction of fullerene in BHJ layer is surprising and interesting. The high performance at such a low fullerene concentration indicated that the crystalline donor may render the fullerene acceptor to form percolated pathways to the electrode. Moreover, it seems that lower fullerene concentration has some connection with the small amount of additive required to achieve optimized BHJ morphologies.
Aside from linear oligothiophenes, two-dimensional oligothiophene systems have also been reported. Early in 2006, Liu, Tian and coworkers reported X-shaped conjugated systems with four linear oligothiophene arms connected to a central thiophene core.c14 with the longest arms had the lowest bandgap with an absorption onset of 520 nm; the blend of c14 and PC61BM exhibited the smallest feature size in AFM images. BHJ OPVs based on c14:PC61BM gave a PCE of 0.80% under simulated solar illumination. Recently, Zhan and coworkers reported a new X-shaped oligothiophene (c15) with four longer arms than c14. Owing to the longer conjugation, c15 exhibited red shifted absorption with the maximum at 426 nm and the onset of 582 nm in film relative to c14. BHJ OPVs based on the blend of c15:PC61BM (1:2) gave a VOC of 0.93 V, JSC of 2.71 mA cm−2, FF of 0.40, and PCE of 1.02%. Replacing PC61BM with PC71BM led to an improved JSC of 4.61 mA cm−2 and a higher PCE of 1.54%.
In 2006, Kopidakis et al. investigated 1,3,5 and 1,2,4,5-substituted phenyl-cored thiophene dendrimers as donor materials in photovoltaic application. Once again, the oligomers with the longest oligothiophene arms exhibited the best performance. Although three-armed dendrimers had superior mobility, four-armed dendrimers enabled solution-cast film formation and yielded smaller optical bandgap. The best material (c16) consisted of a 1,2,4,5-substituted phenyl core with each arm containing six thiophenes. Solution processed BHJ devices based on c16:PC61BM (1:4) exhibited PCE of 1.3%, with a JSC of 3.35 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.94 V and FF of 0.40. However, due to high bandgaps (over 2.3 eV) and poor morphology, 1,3,5-substituted phenyl-cored thiophene dendrimers did not show promising photovoltaic performance, which was similar to the work from Roncali et al. In an effort to improve overlap with the solar spectrum, they reported a thiophene dendrimer that was modified with an electron-withdrawing group in order to lower the bandgap. The dendrimer c17 had an electron-withdrawing tricyanobenzene core and three oligothiophene arms to create a push–pull structure that lowers LUMO level. Compared to its counterpart without cyano groups and other 1,3,5-substituted phenyl-cored thiophene dendrimers, the optical absorption onset of c17 was down to 2.1 eV, attributed to lowering of the LUMO level. The density functional theory calculations showed that the optimized geometry of c17 is totally planar and therefore π-stacking should be favored in films. Planarized structure led to improved morphology both in neat films and in blends with PC61BM. The BHJ OPVs based on c17:PC61BM showed an improved FF, from 0.28 for that without cyano groups to 0.47, leading to an overall PCE enhancement from 0.40% to 1.12%. The authors attributed the higher FF to the improved morphology and reduced carrier recombination of the c17:PC61BM blend.
Extended push–pull oligothiophenes with DCV groups exhibited narrow optical energy gap, strong absorption and favorable intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid state and were promising donors for high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Wong and coworkers synthesized a series of dendritic oligothiophenes with carbazole and DCV, the optical bandgap of these molecules in thin films greatly reduced to 1.74 eV with strong spectral broadening and a high ionization potential at ca. 5.5 eV as determined by UPS. The BHJ OPVs fabricated from dendrimer c18 blended with PC71BM (1:4) showed a PCE of 1.64% with a Voc of 0.93 V after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min.
In 2008, Bäuerle and coworkers reported promising OPV results with large, highly branched oligothiophene dendrimers blended with PC61BM. The largest dendrimer showed absorption cutoff up to 600 nm. Oligothiophene c19 showed the best result in BHJ OPV blending with PC61BM, and the optimized device produced a PCE of 1.72%, with JSC of 4.19 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, and FF of 0.42.
One issue with many OPV materials, such as fused acenes and low dimensional oligomers, is molecular and crystal orientation. High anisotropy in light absorption and charge transport is an important concern for the future of OPV materials, especially the solution processable BHJ materials. In 2006, Roncali and coworkers sought to overcome the low dimensionality of planar small molecules via synthesis of three dimensional oligothiophenes with a tetrahedral silicon core. Absorption spectra of these compounds are identical in thin film and solution state, indicating an absence of aggregation or intermolecular π-interactions in the solid state. Within a BHJ, these molecules are likely to form amorphous hole-transporting networks that may hinder charge collection. The PCE of device based on c20:PC61BM (1:3) under white light irradiation at 80 mW cm−2 is 0.3%, a relatively high value considering the charge transport limitation and the 440 nm light absorption onset. However, the insufficient robustness of the silicon-thiophene bond was identified as a problem, and in some cases degradation of the molecules was observed during vacuum sublimation. In order to solve this problem, they have developed a different approach based on the use of a bithiophene twisted by steric effect as a core for building three dimensional oligothiophenes. The steric interactions associated with the fixation of bulky groups at the 3,3′-positions of bithiophene produced a dihedral angle between the thiophene rings, thus generating a tetrahedral starting unit for the construction of three dimensional systems. BHJ OPVs based on c21 and PC61BM in a 1:3 (w/w) ratio under white light irradiation at 99 mW cm−2 gave a JSC of 1.33 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.51 V, and PCE of 0.20%. The low PCE was considered in relation with the poor absorption of c21, the maximum peak was only 399 nm.
One-dimensional oligothiophenes with pull–push structure exhibited promising OPV performance. Especially, oligothiophenes with electron-withdrawing end groups yielded very high PCEs up to 6.10% when blending with PC61BM. Meanwhile, oligothiophenes with fused rings (such as benzodithiophene and dithienosilole) showed better performance in BHJ devices. On the other hand, the issue mentioned above in low dimensional oligomers is molecular and crystal orientation. High anisotropy in light absorption and charge transport is critical concern for OPV materials, especially for the solution processable BHJ materials. Thus, introducing the electron-withdrawing units and fused rings into three-dimensional oligothiophenes may produce surprising and superb results in BHJ OPVs.

Triphenylamine (TPA) has been regarded as a promising unit for organic semiconductor materials due to its good hole-transporting and electron-donating capabilities. TPA-based small molecules, including push–pull molecules with TPA as the terminal group and star-shaped molecules with TPA as core have been widely investigated for application in OPVs, and they have exhibited good photovoltaic performance. Table 4 provides a summary of electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative linear and star-shaped TPA-based donors (Fig. 5).

Li and coworkers reported a series of TPA-based linear push–pull chromophores with benzothiadiazole (BT) pull moieties. Early in 2006, they synthesized a D–A–D molecule d1 with TPA as the donor, BT as the acceptor and vinylthiophene as the bridge, and the solution-processed BHJ OPVs based on d1:PC61BM (1:1) blend showed a PCE of 0.26%. Replacing thiophene in d1 with 4-hexylthiophene (d2) or 4-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (d3) led to higher PCEs (1.44%) due to better film formation caused by alkyl chains. Zhan and coworkers synthesized d4, similar to d2 but without a vinyl group. BHJ OPVs based on d4:PC71BM (1:3) gave a higher Voc (0.93 V) and higher PCE (2.21%) relative to d2:PC71BM (1:3). They used 1% 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) as additive to further improve PCE to 2.86%. This 30% PCE enhancement was attributed to aggregated domain formation, enhanced absorption, improved hole mobility, and more balanced charge transport. Later, they replaced benzothiadiazole in d4 with thiazolothiazole to synthesize d5; BHJ OPVs based on d5:PC71BM (1:4) after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min afforded JSC of 9.39 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.91 V, FF of 0.44, and PCE of 3.73%. Bo and coworkers reported a series of X-shaped TPA-based molecules with BT as core. Interestingly, the X-shaped molecules exhibited deeper HOMO levels and wider bandgaps than corresponding linear molecules. The best X-shaped molecule (d6) blending with PC71BM showed a JSC of 4.9 mA cm−2,VOC of 0.92 V, FF of 0.41, and PCE of 1.8%, similar to that for its linear counterpart.
Cyano-containing electron withdrawing units, such as dicyanomethylenepyran (DCP), DCV and cyanoacetic acid, were also combined with TPA to build push–pull molecules. In 2007, Li and coworkers designed and synthesized a D–A–D molecule (d7) with TPA as the donor, DCP as the acceptor, and divinylbenzene as the bridge. The VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE of the optimized device based on d7:PC61BM (1:3) reached 0.9 V, 2.14 mA cm−2, 0.41, and 0.79%, respectively. Replacing benzene bridge in d7 with thiophene (d8) led to broader absorption, beneficial to generating excitons and improving the JSC of OPVs. The OPV devices based on d8:PC71BM (1:3) blend showed a JSC of 5.94 mA cm−2 and PCE of 2.06%, higher than that (1.40%) of devices based on d7.
In 2011, Roncali and coworkers reported a series of molecules with TPA as the end group, a DCV dimer as the core and thiophene as the bridge. These compounds showed interesting light-harvesting properties (absorption onset at ca. 700 nm) and low-lying HOMO levels. The symmetrical molecule d9 with one thiophene as bridge showed promising performance in d9/C60 bilayer heterojunction OPVs: JSC of 3.06 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, FF of 0.33, and PCE of 1.08%. Lin, Wong and coworkers reported a molecule (d10) adopting coplanar diphenylsubstituted dithienosilole as a central π-bridge between TPA and DCV, with a cutoff absorption wavelength of 650 nm; vacuum deposited planar-mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) OPVs incorporating C60 or C70 as an acceptor showed an appreciable PCE of 2.69 or 3.82%, respectively. More recently, they reported a novel D–A–A molecule (d11) with ditolylaminothienyl as the donor and BT and DCV as acceptors for vacuum-deposited OPV devices; PMHJ OPVs using C70 acceptor delivered very high Jsc of 14.68 mA cm−2 and PCE of 5.81%, which was attributed to the solar spectral response extending to the near-IR region and the ultracompact absorption dipole stacking of the thin film. Later, they further developed D–A–A molecule (d12) where the pyrimidine acceptor was employed to replace the BT block in d11. The PMHJ device based on d12 and C70 exhibited a markedly high spectra-mismatch-corrected PCE of 6.4% with a JSC of 12.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.95 V, and FF of 0.56. The high VOC value for d12 is attributed to its low-lying HOMO level (−5.46 eV) acquired by using UPS, which is deeper than that of d11 (−5.30 eV measured by UPS). Compared to d11, the JSC is slightly lower possibly due to the blue-shifted absorption of d12. The PCE value of 6.4% is among the highest ever obtained for organic vacuum-deposited single cells. Pei and coworkers reported a D–A–A molecule (d13) with TPA as donor and BT and cyanoacetic acid as acceptors, which exhibited broad absorption (300–800 nm) in thin film. Solution-processed BHJ OPVs based on d13:PC61BM (1:2) blend gave a moderate PCE of 1.23%.
Benefiting from its special propeller starburst molecular structure, three-dimensional, amorphous materials with isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties could be expected when combining TPA core with linear π-conjugated arms. Early in 2006, a series of three-dimensional, star-shaped molecules with TPA as core for OPVs were firstly reported by Roncali and coworkers. They synthesized a series of star-shaped molecules based on a triphenylamine core modified by various combinations of thienylenevinylene conjugated branches and electron-withdrawing indanedione or dicyanovinyl groups (d14–d18). Compared to d14, d15–d18 with electron-withdrawing end groups showed broadening and red shift of absorption and IPCE spectra as well as down-shifting of HOMO levels. Under the same conditions, the PCE of vacuum-deposited bilayer OPVs increased from 0.46% (d14) to 1.17% (d17). Optimized devices based on d18 exhibited a PCE of 1.85% with a very high VOC of 1.15 V. In 2006, they synthesized a star-shaped molecule with TPA as core and terthiophene as arms (d19).d19 exhibited high mobility (0.011 cm2 V−1 s−1) but narrow absorption (λmax = 429 nm), leading to a low PCE (0.32%). Replacing terminal bithiophene in d19 with one (d20) or two (d21) dicyanovinyl groups extended absorption bands and lowered HOMO levels as a result of intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in a large improvement of VOC and JSC. The BHJ OPV devices based on d20 or d21:PC61BM (1:2) showed PCEs of 1.80 and 2.02%, respectively.
Recently, Zhan and coworkers reported a new three-dimensional, star-shaped, D–A–D small molecule (d22) with TPA as the core, BT as the bridge and terthiophene as the arms. Relative to its counterpart d19 without BT, d22 exhibited broader absorption as a result of intramolecular charge transfer. The d22:PC71BM (1:2) blend film exhibited nanoscale aggregated domains, which are beneficial to charge separation and enhanced efficiency of the OPVs. Without any post-treatment, the BHJ OPV devices exhibited a JSC of 9.51 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.87 V, FF of 0.52 and PCE of 4.3%. The PCE value of 4.3% is among the highest reported for solution processed BHJ OPVs based on TPA-containing small molecules, indicating that d22 is a promising three dimensional donor molecule for OPVs.
To improve absorption and solution processability of d18, Li and coworkers replaced thiophene with 4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene to give d23. Solution-processed BHJ OPVs based on d23:PC71BM (1:2) showed a PCE of 1.4%. To further extend absorption, they incorporated vinylene bridge between TPA and bithiophene units in d23 to give d24. The absorption spectrum of the d24 film covered a broad wavelength range in the visible region from 380 to 750 nm, which red-shifted by ca. 40 nm relative to that of the d23 film. BHJ OPVs based on d24:PC71BM (1:2) showed a JSC of 7.76 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.88 V, FF of 0.439 and PCE of 3.0%, better than that of d23.
In 2008, Li and coworkers synthesized a star-shaped, D–A molecule (d25) with TPA as core, BT as arm and vinylene as bridge. The optimized BHJ device based on d25:PC61BM (1:3) produced a PCE of 0.61%. Attaching vinyl-TPA to d25 as end groups (d26) extended the absorption and the absorption maximum red shifted from 486 to 541 nm. The PCE of BHJ devices based on d26:PC61BM (1:3) reached 1.33%, higher than that of the devices based on d25 or the corresponding linear molecule. The result indicates that the three dimensional, star-shaped structure may be beneficial to improving the photovoltaic performance compared to its linear counterpart. Subsequently, PCE of the devices was further improved to 2.39% by using PC71BM as an electron acceptor and replacing the terminal group of vinyl-TPA in d26 with 4-hexylthiophene (d27).
In materials based on TPA and its analogs, the D–A–A structure (e.g., d11 and d12) showed amazing results in PMHJ OPVs, with PCEs up to 6.4%. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional pull–push materials based on TPA as core (e.g., d22) also gave high performance in solution-processed BHJ OPVs with PCEs up to 4.3%. These results suggest that combining multi electron-withdrawing units with TPA core to form three-dimensional D–A–A structure may be one good direction for developing high performance OPV materials.

As the rapid development of donor materials, including polymers and small molecules, PCEs of the OPVs have reached over 8%. The acceptors are of the same importance as the donors for high performance OPVs. However, research efforts devoted to the acceptors are much less than those on the donors. So far, fullerenes and their derivatives still dominate the acceptors although nonfullerene-based acceptors have attracted increasing attention in recent years.


Fullerenes and their derivatives have been widely used in bilayer heterojunction and BHJ OPVs largely due to their strong tendency to accept electrons from donor semiconducting materials and high electron mobilities in the films even in composite form. Additionally, fullerene derivatives readily form favorable nanoscale morphological network with donors, which could improve BHJ OPV performance. Table 5 provides a summary of electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative fullerene derivatives (Fig. 6).

Generally, C60 (e1) and C70 (e2) were mainly used in vacuum deposited OPVs as acceptors, while their soluble derivatives PC61BM (e3) and PC71BM (e4) were mainly used in solution processed OPVs. C60 was discovered by Kroto et al. in 1985. The spherical shape of C60 renders it a good acceptor in any direction, and this isotropy toward electron transfer is advantageous versus planar molecular structures because it greatly increases the chance for a beneficial alignment with the donor π-system. Leo and coworkers obtained an over 25% improvement in device performance in ZnPc:C70 BHJ devices over that using ZnPc:C60. The PCE enhancement from 2.27 to 2.87% was attributed to an increase in photocurrent (from 7.52 to 9.88 mA cm−2), due to stronger long-wavelength absorption of C70 as compared to C60, caused by a relaxation of symmetry-forbidden transitions in C70.
PC61BM was firstly synthesized by Hummelen et al. for the application in photophysical studies toward improvement of photoinduced electron transfer efficiencies in the fabrication of photodetectors and photodiodes. PC61BM has much better solubility in organic solvents than its parent compound C60. In 1995, Yu et al. invented the BHJ structure for the OPVs using soluble PC61BM as acceptor blended with conjugated polymer donor. A deficiency of PC61BM as a photovoltaic material is its very weak absorption in the visible region, due to the high degree of symmetry of C60 which causes the lowest-energy transition formally dipole forbidden. To improve the visible absorption of PC61BM, Wienk et al. synthesized the corresponding C70 derivative PC71BM possessing stronger absorption from 400 to 700 nm than PC61BM. Since then, PC61BM and PC71BM have been widely used in the fabrication of BHJ OPVs. So far the BHJ OPVs based on polymer donors and PC61BM or PC71BM acceptors have PCE values of over 7%. In recent years, some other promising fullerene derivatives have also been reported. PC61BM analogues with the phenyl ring replaced by thiophene, fluorene, or triphenylamine units have been synthesized successfully and exhibited PCEs of 4% in solution processed BHJ OPV devices in combination with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) donor.
Relatively deep LUMO levels of the PC61BM analogues lead to VOC loss in OPV devices, and further limit increase in PCEs. In 2008, Blom and coworkers introduced bisPC61BM (e5), the bisadduct analogue of PC61BM, as a new fullerene-based acceptor material in OPVs. The cyclic voltammetry measurements showed the LUMO energy level of bisPC61BM was 0.1 V higher than that of PC61BM, so that the device based on P3HT:bisPC61BM (1:1.2) showed a higher VOC of 0.73 V (0.58 V for PC61BM), ultimately a higher PCE of up to 4.5% (3.8% for PC61BM).
Li and coworkers developed indene–C60 bisadduct (IC60BA, e6) and indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA, e7) which exhibited 0.17 and 0.19 eV LUMO up-shift, respectively, relative to PC61BM and PC71BM. Meanwhile, IC60BA and IC70BA were easier to synthesize and more soluble in common solvents than PC61BM and PC71BM. The photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives were studied by fabricating BHJ OPVs with P3HT as donor and the fullerene derivatives as acceptor. Thanks to the LUMO up-shift, the VOC of the devices with IC60BA and IC70BA reached 0.84 V, which was 0.26 V higher than that (0.58 V) of the devices with PC61BM as acceptor, and the PCE values of the devices were up to 5.44 and 5.64%, respectively, which were over 40% enhancement in comparison with that (3.88%) of the BHJ OPVs based on P3HT and PC61BM. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, BHJ OPVs based on P3HT and IC60BA provided a PCE of 6.48%. By additive (3-hexylthiophene) processing, BHJ OPVs based on P3HT and IC70BA showed a PCE of up to 6.69%, which is the highest value in the OPVs based on P3HT reported in the literature so far.
Cheng and coworkers reported a new class of diphenylmethano-based C60 bisadduct. The plane of the phenyl groups lying parallel to the fullerene surface sterically protects and shields the core C60 structure from severe intermolecular aggregation, rendering it intrinsically soluble, morphologically amorphous, and thermally stable. The double functionalization raises the LUMO energy level (−3.85 eV) by ca. 0.1 eV, compared to that of PC61BM (−3.95 eV). The BHJ devices based on P3HT:e8 (1:1.2) blend after thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 min exhibited a JSC of 9.05 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.87 V, FF of 0.655, and a high PCE of 5.2%. Voroshazi et al., Kim et al. and Wang et al. independently reported novel o-xylenyl C60 bisadduct e9 with a higher LUMO level (−3.66 eV) relative to PC61BM. e9 was successfully used as an electron acceptor with P3HT in BHJ OPVs, showing a high PCE of 5.31% with a high VOC of 0.83 V.
Endohedral fullerenes were also confirmed to have much higher LUMO levels than their corresponding empty-cage fullerenes in theory and experiment. Ross et al. synthesized a series of soluble PCBM-like Lu3N@C80 derivatives, and the LUMO energy level of Lu3N@C80-PCBH (e10) is 0.28 eV higher than that of PC61BM. The BHJ devices based on P3HT:e10 (1:1) after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min displayed high VOC of 0.89 V and PCE of 4.2%. This result indicates that this series of endohedral fullerene derivatives might be another type of high VOC acceptor for application in OPVs.
Matsuo et al. synthesized a new fullerene derivative with Si-containing side chains (e11), which has good thermal stability and LUMO up-shift relative to PC61BM. They fabricated OPVs with a three-layer structure: an interdigitated BHJ layer of tetrabenzoporphyin (BP):e11 sandwiched by BP donor and e11 acceptor layers. The JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of the best device reached 10.5 mA cm−2, 0.75 V, 0.65 and 5.2%, respectively. Recently, Sharma and coworkers synthesized a new fullerene derivative (e12) from PC61BM; e12 displayed better solubility in common solvents and stronger absorption in the film than PC61BM. After optimizing mixed solvents and subsequent thermal annealing, the best device with P3HT and e12 showed a JSC of 10.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.81 V, FF of 0.63, and PCE of 5.25%. Fréchet and coworkers synthesized a dihydronaphthyl fullerene benzyl alcohol benzoic acid ester (e13); the best BHJ OPV based on P3HT:e13 (55:45) after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min exhibited a JSC of 11.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.65 V, FF of 0.57, and PCE of 4.2%.
Without question, fullerene derivatives are the most successful acceptors in the OPVs so far. During the last decade, significant advances have been made in fullerene-based acceptors, appropriate chemical modifications have up-shifted their inherent LUMO energy levels, and the cost of fullerene production has also decreased along with an increase in synthetic yields and material purity. Nevertheless, there remain incentives to develop nonfullerene acceptors that will not only retain the favorable electron accepting and transporting properties of fullerenes, but also overcome their insufficiencies such as the limited spectral breadth and bandgap variability.

On the basis of recent developments in high-performance electron transporting materials for OFETs, some research groups have begun investigating nonfullerene acceptors for use in OPVs. Rylene diimides have attracted interest as alternative acceptor materials since they exhibit excellent photostability, easy alteration of HOMO and LUMO energies, large absorption coefficients, high electron mobilities, electron affinities similar to those of fullerenes and each of these properties can be readily tailored through either variation of substituents on the imide nitrogen atoms or on the rylene core.Table 6 provides a summary of electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative rylene diimide related acceptors (Fig. 7).

Perylene diimides (PDIs) are among the earliest and most common nonfullerene acceptors investigated in OPVs. Many early studies of OPVs incorporating PDIs consisted of layered structures fabricated by vacuum deposition. The first bilayer heterojunction OPV was reported by Tang where a PDI-based small molecule (f1) was used as the acceptor along with CuPc as the donor. When ZnPc was employed as a donor in place of CuPc in a simple bilayer device, the PCE was improved from 0.95% to 1.3%. Later, the cis-isomer f2 was prepared, and a bilayer heterojunction device based on CuPc/f2 showed a PCE of 0.93%, slightly lower than that of f1 (1.1%). The lower efficiency was attributed to less efficient packing in acceptor f2, leading to shorter exciton diffusion lengths in the system.
BHJ OPVs based on solution processed blends of PDI-based materials with appropriate donor materials are attracting increasing attention. Solution processable PDI-based acceptors can be prepared by introducing solubilizing groups, such as alkyl, on the imide nitrogen atoms. 3-Pentyl substituted PDI (f3) was prepared and blended with a variety of donors such as P3HT and polycarbazole to fabricate OPVs by spin coating. By careful control over the solvent, substrate temperature during deposition, and annealing temperature and time, the devices based on P3HT:f3 (1:4) film showed a JSC of 1.65 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.45 V, FF of 0.34, and PCE of 0.25%. Nonetheless the tendency for f3 to form crystalline domains within polymer matrices limited the efficiencies of BHJ devices since the crystalline domains acted as electron traps to decrease photocurrents.
PDIs with longer alkyl substituents on the imide nitrogen atoms have also been prepared, and when blended with P3HT gave low efficiencies. For instance, a maximum PCE of 0.18% was achieved with a P3HT:f4 weight ratio of 1:4 after annealing at 80 °C for 1 h. Along with varying substituents on the imide nitrogen atoms, recent studies have also examined the impact of substituents in the bay regions of the PDIs on thin-film morphology and device performance. Although the PDIs with electron donating or withdrawing substituents have tuned the LUMO energy level over a range of nearly 0.7 eV and impacted on device VOC, none of these PDI bay-substituted derivatives yielded higher performance than simple PDIs without bay-region substituents. Very recently, Laquai et al. demonstrated that the photovoltaic characteristics of blend films of P3HT and PDIs are improved upon using a core-alkylated PDI derivative (f5) instead of the often used N-alkylated. The alkyl-substitution pattern affected the packing of the PDI and improved the blend aggregation. The optimized device based on P3HT:f5 exhibited a PCE of 0.5%, with JSC of 1.74 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.75 V, and FF of 0.38.
PDI-based small molecular acceptors had no promising results in OPVs, until Sharma and coworkers developed a series of high-performance acceptors by attaching tert-butylphenoxy groups to the bay-region of PDIs and varying the imide substituent. The acceptors f6–f8 with different fused-ring substituents on the imide exhibited electron mobilities (Measured by SCLC) of 4–9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when blended with small molecular donors X, Y, or Z (Fig. 7). The devices based on X:f6, Y:f7, and Z:f8 blends gave PCEs of 2.85%, 3.17%, and 3.88%, respectively, after annealing and/or inserting a ZnO layer between the active layer and the cathode. The PCE of 3.88% is the highest ever reported for nonfullerene-based BHJ OPVs.
Compared to the PDI-based molecules, the smaller fused-ring unit naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives were less successful as acceptors in OPVs, because they possess a larger bandgap and thus absorb poorly in the visible spectrum (generally at onset less than 400 nm). For example, bilayer OPVs based on ZnPc/f9 exhibited a PCE of 0.54%, lower than that (1.3%) of its analog, f1. Recently, Jenekhe and coworkers reported a new nonfullerene acceptor (f10) with NDI as core and oligothiophene as arms used in BHJ OPVs. After annealing at 100 °C for 10 min and adding 0.2% diiodooctane additive, the optimized P3HT:f10 based device showed a PCE of 1.5%.
Although rylene diimides have strong absorption and high electron mobility, the performance of OPVs using rylene diimides as acceptors do not yet rival those of fullerene-based systems. The planar shapes of rylene diimides may result in enhanced π-stacking and more quasi one-dimensional electron transport, compared to the spherical/ellipsoidal molecular shapes of fullerenes. So when rylene diimide-rich phases do not have high degrees of long-range order, there can be multiple orientations of π-stacked phases, which may decrease long-range mobilities and therefore act as recombination centers. In this system, introducing bulky side chains can decrease the molecular planarity and may be helpful to improve the photovoltaic performance.

Apart from the rylene-based acceptors, some other n-type molecules have been reported as the nonfullerene acceptors for OPVs. Table 7 provides a summary of electronic properties as well as OPV data for representative other nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (Fig. 8). One method of increasing the n-type character of molecules is to introduce electron-withdrawing units, such as fluorine and cyano, to the periphery of the aromatic rings. For example, hexadecafluorinated CuPc g1 showed electron mobilities of up to 5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs. When incorporating g1 in bilayer heterojunction OPVs as an acceptor and sexiphenyl (p-6P) as a donor, a PCE of 0.18% was obtained. Using subphthalocyanine (SubPc) instead of p-6P led to improved PCE of 0.56%. Torres and coworkers synthesized a series of fluorinated SubPc as acceptors in OPVs. Bilayer OPV devices of the acceptors with a variety of donors, such as pentacene, CuPc, AlClPc, SubPc and SubNc, were prepared by vacuum evaporation. In these devices, the SubPc/g2-based device showed the highest PCE of 0.96%, with JSC of 2.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.94 V, and FF of 0.49. However, the PCE value of 0.96% was obviously lower than that (3.0%) of SubPc/C60-based control device. The moderate efficiencies could be limited by the low electron mobility of the amorphous fluorinated SubPc as well as series resistance effects in the active layer. Jones and coworkers found that replacing fluorinated SubPc (g2) with chlorinated SubPc (g3) led to improved performance; SubPc/g3-based device showed promising PCEs of 2.68% with very high VOC of 1.31 V. After selective halogenation to tune the energy levels of SubPc, g3 provided sufficient interfacial HOMO and LUMO offsets for efficient exciton dissociation, whilst maximizing the interface gap. Recently, Verreet et al. reported fluorinated fused SubPc dimer (g4, mixture of two isomers) with strong and complementary absorption to the donor material SubPc. The optimized SubPc/g4-based bilayer device exhibited a high PCE of 4%, with JSC of 7.8 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.95 V, and FF of 0.54. The PCE of 4% is the highest ever reported for nonfullerene-based bilayer OPVs.

Although pentacene and its derivatives belong to a promising class of donors in OPVs, Anthony and coworkers demonstrated that it is possible to switch them from donors to acceptors in OPVs by lowering their LUMO energy levels through cyanation. Cyanopentacenes g5 and g6 with tricyclopentylsilyl groups have been synthesized; the energy levels can be tuned by varying the number of cyano groups, while the trialkylsilyl groups control crystal packing and film morphology. They found that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels down-shifted by ca. 0.14 eV for every cyano group that was introduced to the pentacene core, and a particularly strongly one-dimensional “sandwich herringbone” crystal packing motif yielded devices with the highest photocurrent. In the initial devices, blended with P3HT donor, dicyanopentacene g6 exhibited a best PCE of 0.43%, with JSC of 1.93 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.54 V, and FF of 0.41. Reducing the number of cyano from 2 (g6) to 1 (g5) led to a higher performance: JSC of 3.72 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.84 V, FF of 0.41, and PCE of up to 1.29%. The 0.3 V improvement in VOC was attributed to an up-shift of LUMO energy level caused by a decrease in cyano number. Subsequently, several other pentacene derivatives with a single electron withdrawing group were investigated, and the better acceptors were found to be chloropentacene g7 and trifluoromethylpentacene g8 with PCE of 1.00% and 1.26%, respectively, when blending with P3HT. Recently, anthradithiophene was also converted into acceptor for OPVs, through the introduction of amide groups. In most literature work, anthradithiophene derivatives were studied as a mixture of syn and anti isomers due to the great challenge in the preparation of isomerically pure materials. However, amide groups caused different self-assembly of the syn- and anti-isomers that allowed for the first time separation and property evaluation of isomerically pure anthradithiophenes. Anthony and coworkers evaluated the acceptor properties of two pure isomers and their mixture in BHJ OPVs with P3HT as donor; syn-isomer g9 yielded much better PCE (0.8%) than that of anti-isomer (0.008%) or their mixture (0.09%) after annealing at 120 °C for 1 min. For anti-isomer, larger scale aggregation was observed in the blend film, while syn-isomer:P3HT blend showed a more uniform coverage textured with small grains of the acceptor. The difference in blend film morphology is responsible for the difference in OPV performance.
As same as CuPc and pentacene, oligothiophenes have also been widely employed as donors in OPVs. However, thienyl-S,S-dioxide caused a significant increase in electron affinity of the oligothiophene system. Barbarella et al. developed a series of linear and branched thiophene-S,S-dioxide-containing oligothiophene acceptors for OPVs. In these studies, due to the propensity for linear oligothiophene acceptors to crystallize and form aggregates leading to reduced D/A interfacial area, BHJ OPVs based on all linear acceptors blending with P3HT showed very low PCEs, and the asymmetric molecule g10 gave a PCE of 0.06%, higher than the others. To suppress crystallization, V-shaped acceptors were synthesized. Owing to the branched structure lacking any symmetry elements, these V-shaped acceptors displayed a low tendency to crystallization and better film forming properties than their linear counterparts. Thus for the acceptor g11, devices fabricated from a blend of P3HT yielded estimated PCE of 0.3–0.4% by thermal annealing.
Cyano is an excellent electron-withdrawing unit in design of donor and acceptor materials for OPVs. As with the systems described above, carbazole has also been modified as an acceptor through cyanation. The molecule g12 substituted with two DCV groups showed broad absorption with the onset of about 600 nm. By controlling blend ratio, solvent and annealing conditions, the optimized devices with P3HT:g12 showed a PCE of 0.14%. The relatively low PCE of OPVs based on g12 is due to its low electron mobility of 1.15 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 estimated by the SCLC method.
Wang and coworkers developed DCV substituted quinacridone derivatives as acceptors for BHJ OPVs. These molecules exhibited remarkable absorption in the region from 650 to 700 nm. In particular, molecule g13 exhibited a LUMO energy level of −4.1 eV, small bandgap (1.8 eV) and moderate electron mobility (1.14 × 10−2 cm2 V− s−1 by SCLC). A device based on P3HT:g13 exhibited a PCE of 1.57%, with JSC of 5.72 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.48 V, and FF of 0.57. However, the relatively deep LUMO energy level of g13 led to a significant loss of photovoltage.
Meredith et al. combined fluorene, BT and DCV together to synthesize a new nonfullerene acceptor (g14), which can be processed by vacuum deposition or solution processing to give amorphous thin films and can be annealed at a modest temperature to give films with better order and enhanced charge transport properties. The P3HT:g14 BHJ device spun cast from dichlorobenzene showed a low PCE of 0.04%, and after annealing at 65 °C for 20 min, the PCE was improved to 0.73%, which can be attributed to an increase in electron mobility in the acceptor phase and improvement in the charge percolation network to the contacts.
Recently, a series of substituted dicyanoimidazole derivatives known as Vinazene have received focused attention as acceptors in BHJ OPVs. The series of Vinazene-based molecules displayed a wide range of electronic properties, with LUMO energy levels ranging from −2.76 to −3.60 eV. Of these molecules, g15 and g16 containing BT core gave the most efficient devices when blended with P3HT in BHJ OPVs. After thermal annealing, g15 and g16 based devices showed a PCE of 0.45% and 1.1%, respectively. For g16, a further improvement in efficiency can be achieved by employing an octylphenyl-substituted polythiophene (POPT) as the donor. The optimized device at a 1:1 blend weight ratio of POPT:g16 yielded a JSC of 5.5 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.62 V, FF of 0.4, and PCE of 1.4%. The higher performance of POPT could be explained by the ability of the conjugated phenyl substituent to twist out of planarity, resulting in a high dissociation efficiency. Very recently, Sellinger et al. synthesized a series of electron-deficient molecules based on a central BT moiety flanked with vinylimides and used for solution processed BHJ OPVs as acceptors. Of these acceptors, phthalimide-BT based molecule (g17) showed promising photovoltaic performance. BHJ OPVs based on P3HT:g17 (1:1.4) yielded a high VOC of 0.96 V and a maximum PCE of 2.54%, whereas naphthalimide-BT analog only afforded 0.1% PCE. The high VOC is attributed to the high LUMO level (−3.3 eV) of g17.
DPP-based materials have been proven promising donors for OPVs; blended with PC71BM acceptors, they yielded PCEs up to 4.4%. Interestingly, a variety of DPP derivatives with electron withdrawing end capping groups (such as aldehyde, trifluoromethylphenyl and trifluorophenyl) were tested as acceptors in OPVs. The inherent electron affinity of DPP moiety was further improved through the introduction of electron withdrawing groups. Among these compounds, g18 provided the highest PCE of 1.0%, when blended with P3HT donor in a BHJ device, while aldehyde substituted DPP g19 showed a lower PCE of 0.31%.
Very recently, Pei et al. modified the fluoranthene-fused imide scaffold to develop a new electron acceptor g20 by combining with a cyano substituent group. The investigation of the photophysical and electrochemical properties indicates that LUMO level (ca. −3.5 eV) of g20 both matches the work function of the LiF/Al cathode and increases VOC of OPV devices. The preliminary results showed that by thermal annealing at 100 °C, the solution-processed BHJ OPVs based on P3HT:g20 (1:2) gave a PCE of 1.86%, with relatively high VOC of 0.76 V, compared to that (0.58 V) of the control device based on P3HT:PC61BM blend.
Wudl and coworkers reported the use of a 9,9′-bifluorenylidene polycycle for small molecule acceptors. The 9,9′-bifluorenylidene structures are particularly effective at stabilizing a negative charge, due to both steric and electronic effects. But the steric effect is relieved when the molecule receives an electron and gains aromaticity. Meanwhile, the LUMO energy level of this system is easily tuned by substitution on the aromatic periphery. When blended with P3HT, the asymmetric molecule g21 showed a decent PCE of 1.7% and a high VOC of 1.10 V.
Chemical functionalization allows control over absorption profile and energy levels of nonfullerene acceptors. However, compared to fullerenes and their derivatives, nonfullerene acceptors showed lower performance in OPV devices, especially solution processed BHJ OPVs. The hurdles that remain arise from active layer morphology and charge transport issues. While many of these materials showed good electron mobilities when measured in neat films, the mobilities in blends with the donors were generally not as high. The next step in the development of new nonfullerene acceptors may involve developing multi-dimensional structures.

For BHJ OPVs, one of the main problems is fine tuning the complicated physical interactions between donor–donor, acceptor–acceptor, and donor–acceptor to obtain an ideal and stable morphology with a well-defined nanostructure. To solve this problem, acceptors, such as fullerene, PDI, DCV etc. were attached to donor molecules, such as oligothiophene, oligophenylenevinylene, and triphenylamine, as pendant side chains or end groups to form donor–acceptor dyad molecules (Fig. 9), which can be regarded as a molecular heterojunction and used to fabricate single-component OPVs. Such a structure facilitates exciton dissociation and homogeneous distribution to prevent severe phase separation. In recent years, the donor–acceptor dyad molecules showed some promising performance.

Hashimoto and coworkers developed a series of fullerene-dyad molecules for single-component OPVs. In 2009, they reported synthesis of an oligophenylenevinylene containing five phenyl rings with C60 connected to the middle phenyl ring in the conjugated chain by a polyether linker (h1). After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 1 min under inert atmosphere, the h1-based single-component OPV device gave JSC of 3.30 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.88 V, FF of 0.44 and PCE of 1.28% under white light irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. More recently, the same group reported an oligothiophene containing 8 thiophene rings and an electron-withdrawing DPP unit in the middle with C60 connected to the DPP unit by a polyether linker (h2).h2 showed a low bandgap and the photocurrent response was extended to 850 nm, so that a h2-based single-component OPV device gave a high JSC (4.79 mA cm−2). This high JSC together with VOC of 0.51 V and FF of 0.46 led to a total PCE of 1.1%.
In 2009, Geng et al. synthesized a series of extended D–A cooligomers in which substituted fluorene-alt-bithiophene oligomer was selected as donor block and PDI as acceptor block. They found that solvent vapor annealing significantly improved the order of the cooligomers with an increase of the persistent length of the lamellae. After solvent annealing, h3-based single-component OPV device showed a JSC of 4.49 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.87 V, FF of 0.38 and PCE of 1.50%, which is the best value reported for a single-component OPV device so far. TPA-DCV-based star-shaped D–A molecule (d17, Fig. 5) reported by Roncali et al. also exhibited promising results in single-component OPVs: JSC of 1.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.70 V, FF of 0.30, and PCE of 0.40%.
The fast charge recombination and inefficient charge hopping and transport in single-component OPVs is probably responsible for the relatively lower PCEs of single-component OPVs compared to donor/acceptor blend or bilayer solar cells.

We have reviewed some representative and promising small molecule donors, acceptors, and donor–acceptor dyad systems for high-performance bilayer, BHJ, and single-component OPVs. So far a number of small molecular OPV materials have been discovered, but most of these materials give relatively low PCEs. With extensive research and accumulated practical experience that we have outlined in this review, the guidelines to pursuing and developing high-performance small molecules for OPVs are becoming legible. The basic requirements of specific intrinsic properties necessary for an ideal small molecular donor, acceptor or donor–acceptor dyad materials include: (a) a low optical bandgap for broad absorption range matching with solar spectrum and high extinction coefficient for capturing more solar energy; (b) long exciton diffusion lengths for effective migration of excitons to D/A interface; (c) high hole or electron mobility for accelerating charge transport, which in turn allows a thicker active layer required for increased light harvesting, as well as reduces charge recombination and series resistance; (d) suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels to ensure a large VOC and a downhill energy offset for exciton dissociation. Additionally, easy sublimation, relatively low molecular weight, excellent thermal stability are also necessary for vacuum deposited materials, while good film-forming property and sufficient solubility are also necessary for solution processed materials. Meanwhile, since the optimal OPV material itself is device application and system specific, for bilayer heterojunction OPVs, high crystallinity of the active materials may be beneficial to improve the device performance. On the other hand, for BHJ OPVs, it is also critical for the active materials that formation of a bicontinuous interpenetrating network with the optimum morphology for building two distinct highways for transporting free charge carriers; moderate crystallinity of materials can improve charge carrier mobility, but high crystallinity will cause large phase separation scale and low PCE of devices. Generally, low PCEs in OPV devices may be attributed to the OPV materials violating one or some of the above criteria, or the device configuration and fabrication below optimization.

High-efficiency OPVs have been achieved as a result of innovations of small molecular materials and device fabrication technology, boding a bright future for this exciting research field. For further improving the device performance by modifying the molecular structure of active materials, it is necessary that deeply understanding the relationships between chemical structures and optical, electronic and device properties. To summarize:
(1) Enhancing and extending the absorption of active materials to match solar radiation is one of the main ways to improve JSC and efficiencies of OPV devices. An OPV molecule with bandgap < 2 eV is necessary but not sufficient for a high PCE. The oligomers with long conjugation length generally possess broad and strong absorption. Building the push–pull structure with electron donating and withdrawing units can create the intramolecular charge transfer and in turn improve the molecular absorption. Molecules and oligomers based on fused-ring blocks such as acenes, dithienocyclopentadiene, dithienosilole, dithienopyrrole and benzodithiophene could exhibit relatively low Eg and broad absorption.
(2) Since the VOC of devices is related directly to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor, a lower HOMO of a donor and a higher LUMO of an acceptor would help to achieve a higher VOC. In general, a donor with a HOMO below −5.3 eV or an acceptor with a LUMO above −3.7 eV tends to give VOC > 0.8 V. The energy levels can be tuned by changing the species and number of substituent group. In general, introducing the electron-withdrawing units, such as cyano and fluorine etc., would down-shift the LUMO levels of materials. On the contrary, the electron-donating units such as TPA and thiophene help to raise the HOMO levels.
(3) The high hole mobility of donors and electron mobility of acceptors (> 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−2) would help to achieve a high JSC. Molecules based on fused-ring blocks tend to exhibit relatively high mobilities. Crystal structure and π–π stacking in the film are the key factors to determining the mobility of materials. In addition, the mobilities matching of donor and acceptor benefit also FF and PCE of devices.
(4) For solution processing, the use of long alkyl or alkoxy side chains has been a common approach. However, the side chain nature not only affects the solubility, configuration and intermolecular interaction of the molecules, and also affects the absorption, energy levels and charge transport properties. In particular, the side chain affects morphology of blend films and finally affects the photovoltaic performance of devices. It should be stressed that increasing the content of insulating alkyl side chains relative to the conjugated main chain in the molecule may result in deterioration in charge transport. Thereby, balanced choice of a suitable solubilizing group at an appropriate location is of crucial importance for fine-tuning the structure–properties relationship.
(5) The morphology and phase separation scale in BHJ film is not only related to the nature of materials, but also can be optimized by carefully controlling the device fabrication conditions, such as varying spin-casting solvent and speed or donor/acceptor radio and concentration, thermal annealing, exposure to solvent vapor, modifying the surface energy of the blend component and substrate. With optimal morphology on the nanoscale, it becomes easy to translate the microscopic intrinsic properties of the photovoltaic materials into macroscopic OPV device performance.
(6) Merocyanine (MC) dye and TPA-based D–A–A molecule donors in combination with C60 or C70 acceptors exhibited very high performance in vacuum deposited OPVs, while one-dimensional oligothiophenes with push–pull structures in combination with PC61BM or PC71BM exhibited very high performance in solution processed BHJ OPVs; the best PCEs were up to > 6%. Fused acenes exhibited relatively low efficiencies in vacuum deposited or solution processed OPVs (< 3%). Nonfullerene acceptors (PCE < 4%) do not yet rival fullerene-based systems in vacuum deposited or solution processed devices, while donor–acceptor dyad molecular heterojunction (PCE < 1.5%) does not yet rival donor/acceptor bilayer or bulk heterojunction in vacuum deposited or solution processed devices.
(7) It should be emphasized that the PCE is more a device parameter than an intrinsic photovoltaic material parameter. High efficiency achievement is a systematic combination of material properties with judicious and careful optimization of the various device fabrication conditions. So far the best performances (> 6%) of OPVs were achieved from vacuum or solution-deposited small molecule donors with fullerene acceptors. An interdisciplinary approach such as novel photovoltaic materials and new advanced device concepts will probably bring high efficiency over 10% and low cost OPVs to final commercialization.
