Organic solar cells (OSCs) have witnessed great progress over the past few years. A diversity of breakthroughs, such as record power conversion efficiencies of single junction or tandem OSCs, high performing flexible devices and large area modulus, have been successfully realized to date. These achievements depend on comprehensive materials innovation, including light harvesting materials, interlayer materials and novel electrodes. The cathode interlayer (CIL), usually a thin layer between the photoactive layer and the cathode, is responsible for electron extraction and hole blocking, thus playing crucial roles in the overall performance of OSCs. CIL materials, which can be solution processed at low temperature and show high conductivity, are vital for the convenient fabrication of flexible and large area OSC devices. However, traditional CIL materials such as inorganic metal oxides and pure organic semiconductors often suffer from different disadvantages, such as high temperature treatment for the former and film thickness-sensitive performance for the latter. Therefore, intensive research efforts have been made among the community on organic–inorganic hybrid CIL materials for the purpose of combining their advantages while reducing their drawbacks. To summarize, these hybrid CILs can be categorized as (i) organic modification of traditional inorganic CILs, (ii) simple organic–inorganic hybrid coordination complexes and (iii) hybrid cluster based CILs. Notably, class (i) can enable metal oxide based CILs to be processed at lower temperature, display more thickness-insensitive performance and improved stability. Moreover, classes (ii) and (iii) can be expressed with definite structures and are suitable for establishing a clear structure–performance relationship, which should be of significant potential for deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of CIL materials in OSCs. In particular, metal oxide cluster based CILs with both metal oxide cores and designable surface groups according to their composition show great promise for bridging the gap between inorganic and organic materials, hence providing new excellent CIL materials and corresponding OSCs. This review focuses on the research progress of hybrid CILs in recent years and is intended to inspire more innovative creation on this topic, which undoubtedly will provide great benefits to the development of OSCs.

An organic solar cell (OSC) is a kind of photovoltaic device, which can transform renewable solar energy into electricity, using conjugated organic semiconductors as electron donors and acceptors forming blended photoactive layers. Owing to the advantages such as light weight, flexibility and semi-transparency, OSCs have great application prospects in wearable equipment, colorful windows and internet of things. Benefited from the extended absorption range of photoactive layers, including both polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors, and energy loss mitigation of corresponding OSC devices, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction OSCs have exceeded 19% to date. With respect to charge generation and transport, interfacial layers between the photoactive layers and electrodes are generally necessary. These interlayers, including the cathode interlayer (CIL) and anode interlayer (AIL), are capable of forming energy level alignment, facilitating charge extraction, and should exhibit high carrier mobility. The interlayer can not only guarantee high performance, but also is crucial for device stability. Moreover, interlayer materials, which can display excellent physicochemical/semiconducting properties and show solution processing convenience, are vital for roll-to-roll manufacturing of large area OSC devices and even flexible modulus, which represents one of the most striking characteristics of OSCs.

The CIL materials toward high performance OSCs should meet requirements such as well aligned energy levels between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electron acceptor and the cathode, high electron mobility and smooth films for inherent contact across the interlayer. Various materials have been developed as efficient CILs for high performing OSCs. According to their composition, these materials can be divided into three main classes, pure inorganic materials, pure organic materials and organic–inorganic materials. Pure inorganic CIL materials mainly include inorganic salts, such as LiF and Cs2CO3, and metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2. Pure organic CIL materials have been designed with various structures such as conjugated PFN, PFNBr, PNDIT-F3N-Br and PDINO, non-conjugated PEIE, and so on. Although pure inorganic and organic CIL materials have been instrumental in promoting the rapid development of OSCs, they also suffer from different drawbacks. For instance, there are inevitable interfacial contact issues between inorganic CILs and organic conjugated photoactive blended layers. Furthermore, metal oxide-type inorganic materials often need high temperature treatment which is not compatible with most polymer flexible substrates. To date, inorganic CILs have been mainly employed in inverted OSCs. Organic CIL materials can be elegantly designed with different kinds of backbone structures and functional elements or groups. Great achievements in organic CIL materials have been made over the past few years. They can effectively tune the work functions of metal or ITO electrodes and have been applied in both inverted and regular OSCs. The classical principles of organic CIL materials mainly include conjugated electron deficient segments with high electron affinity combining organic polar groups for good alcohol solution processability and distinct electrical doping behavior with photoactive layer materials. However, some organic CILs suffer from low conductivity and unstable film microstructures leading to film thickness-dependent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device performance degradation.
One reasonable idea to overcome these issues is the organic–inorganic hybrid method to alleviate the respective drawbacks and meanwhile combine their advantages, which has been confirmed to be feasible in recent years. There have been numerous research efforts on this point and intriguing progress has been made. Although some excellent reviews on whole interlayer materials have been made recently, it seems that a special summary on typical hybrid CIL materials and corresponding OSC devices for the OSC community is lacking. In this review, we present an overview on the main achievements in this developing area and try to provide a perspective on the rational design of organic–inorganic hybrid CIL materials.

ZnO is a kind of commonly used inorganic oxide-type CIL in efficient inverted OSCs, due to its high conductivity and electron mobility, and well-aligned energy levels to various fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. Generally, ZnO possesses a hexagonal wurtzite structure (Fig. 1a) and can show different exposed facets on the surface. In particular, Sun et al. reported the sol–gel method for ZnO film, which has been widely employed in the fabrication of inverted OSCs. However, ZnO also suffers from an uneven surface with oxygen mediated defects and necessary thermal annealing treatment. To reduce these drawbacks, different strategies have been reported in the literature, such as introducing different kinds of organic and inorganic dopants, processing with optimized solvents, and tuning the thermodynamic process of the film. A state-of-the-art review providing the surface modification of ZnO with tuned electronic properties and improved device performance has been summarized by Hewlett and McLachlan in 2016. Hence, we mainly summarize representative studies since then in this part. Besides ZnO, both TiO2 and SnO2 are also commonly used oxide based CILs in OSCs, and their typical atomic rutile or anatase structures are shown in Fig. 1b.


A milestone strategy of obtaining a ZnO–PBI type hybrid CIL was reported by Ma and Xie in 2015. The authors and co-workers reported that introducing an organic dye molecule (Fig. 2), PBI-H, with an imide coordinating with the Zn ion into the ZnO precursor solution can greatly enhance the photoconductivity of the resulting ZnO film and improve the interfacial contact between ZnO and photoactive layers. The device performance has been optimized for different electron donors with a fullerene acceptor (PC71BM), and an impressive PCE of 10.59% was obtained for PTB7-Th:PC71BM when using MoO3 as the HTL. Owing to the high photoconductivity of this hybrid CIL, the high device performance is insensitive to its thickness over a broad range of 30–60 nm. Following this pioneering work, they have developed a series of PBI based coordinating dopants, including pyridine containing PBI-Py, phenol containing HO-PBI, carboxylate containing PBI-COOH and sulfonic acid containing PBI-SO3H. It was unveiled that under white light illumination, the PBI dopants can not only release a large number of electrons in the conduction band of ZnO leading to higher conductivity, but also can reduce the work function resulting in better energy level alignment. Suitable energetics of CILs is critical for a high built-in electric field to facilitate efficient charge collection and transport, ensuring high device open circuit voltage and short circuit current. As a result, the CIL thickness with an optimal PCE over 10% for fullerene OSCs can be up to 100 nm. Furthermore, the OSC devices have been optimized with high-performing non-fullerene acceptors. A high PCE of 15.95% can thus be obtained by this method for PBDB-T-2F:Y6 based OSCs. Besides normal rigid OSCs on ITO glasses, flexible devices can also be obtained by using this kind of ZnO-PBI CIL, which can be treated at lower temperatures of 120–130 °C. An attracting PCE of 9.63% was thus achieved with the J71:ITIC active layer, while the PCE of the corresponding rigid OSC device is 11.3%.

Other rylene imide and 2-pyran-4-ylidenemalononitrile based molecules and non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have also been used as dopants, such as a naphthalimide-Schiff base (NS), TPT-S and ITIC. Wen et al. reported that TPT-S can be effectively doped into ZnO, delivering high photoconductivity. This made TPT-S doped ZnO a thickness-insensitive CIL whose thickness ranged from 20 to 75 nm. When TPT-S doped ZnO thermally treated at 130 °C was used as the CIL, the PBDB-T-2F:IT4F based OSCs can achieve a comparable efficiency of 12.33% to that with bare ZnO treated at 200 °C. Therefore, TPT-S doped ZnO can be readily utilized to fabricate flexible OSCs providing an efficiency of over 11%. Interestingly, Fang and Wang et al. employed small phenanthroline molecules to dope ZnS and also delivered improved performance. Typical alcohol soluble polymer electrolytes, belonging to important organic CIL materials, have also been used to passivate the ZnO defects. Both PFN and NDI-PFNBr have been introduced into the precursor solution of ZnO. As a result, fullerene based OSCs can be obviously improved resulting in enhanced PCEs. Specifically, NDI-PFNBr doped ZnO can afford higher conductivity and exhibit less performance dependence. When employed to fabricate a large area modulus by the doctor blade coating method, the 16 cm2 and 93 cm2 OSC modulus delivered high efficiencies up to 8.05% and 4.49%, respectively. Kim and co-workers used viologen derivatives to dope ZnO and the device performance could also be increased.
In addition to the conjugated molecules, non-conjugated ones but with polar groups can also be used to modify ZnO. As early as in 2011, So, Reynolds and co-workers adopted PVP as an additive in the ZnO precursor solution to improve the ZnO film. Fang et al. reported that EDTA can be used to dope ZnO leading to an enhanced PCE of 12.10%, compared to the 11.07% of bare ZnO for PBDB-T:IT-M based OSCs. The film was treated at 140 °C for 10 min. PEIE, as a typical non-conjugated organic amine derivative, has been demonstrated by Zhou et al. to be able to reduce the work function values of metal electrodes. Yu and Tang et al. reported that PEIE can be incorporated into ZnO film to serve as an excellent CIL in both fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. Zhou's group further reported that PEI-Zn can accommodate flexible OSC fabrication owing to the low annealing temperature of 150 °C. This kind of CIL can be processed on both conductive PEDOT:PSS and silver nanowire based electrodes, giving PCEs of 12.3% and 15.0% for PBDB-T-2F:Y6, respectively. Very recently, Zhou et al. further applied a PEI-Zn CIL in the fabrication of all-printed OSCs, combined with alcohol processable PEDOT:F as the HTL. Besides the above organic dopants, simple coordination complexes, especially those based on 8-hydroxyquinoline, can also be used in ZnO film fabrication. Hao and co-workers employed different metal ions chelated by 8-hydroxyquinoline into ZnO (Table 1).

Actually, ZnO can also be pre-synthesized as nanoparticles (NPs) for ZnO films, but they usually need to be freshly prepared, because ZnO NPs often suffer from serious aggregation and cannot be stored for a long period. Therefore, various organic ligands have been used to modify the ZnO NPs to alleviate the aggregation and improve the resulting films. These ligands, including small molecules and polymers, usually contain polar and even ionic end groups. For example, Matsuo et al. reported that 2-aminoethanol-stabilized ZnO NPs can be used to form ZnO films (AE:ZnO) in air without thermal annealing. The as-obtained AE:ZnO can afford comparable PCE to that of sol–gel ZnO with thermal treatment at 200 °C. Guo and co-workers reported that polyethylenimine (PEI) can be used to stabilize ZnO NPs, which then can be processed without thermal annealing. Both PTB7:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM based OSCs can thus be improved in comparison with those based on pristine ZnO without modification. What's more, coordinating N-containing polymers can also be used to stabilize ZnO NPs. Liu et al. synthesized adenine appendant polystyrene (PA), which can not only effectively passivate the defects of ZnO film, but also decrease the work function and increase the conductivity. As a result, the ZnO:PA based CIL can provide a much elevated PCE for both fullerene and non-fullerene based OSCs with thick CIL films even at 100 nm.

Since ZnO NPs are often synthesized with large amounts of –OH on the surface, it is reasonable to use molecules with reactive groups to make modification through covalent bonds. One prototypical molecule of this kind is 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) or (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). Ma's group reported ZnO@APTMS, while Zhang et al. and Zhou et al. reported ZnO-APTES as efficient CILs, respectively. Specifically, ZnO@APTMS can significantly increase the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs to 9.07% without UV illumination owing to the reduced light soaking effect (Fig. 3). For comparison, the control device using a bare ZnO CIL can just achieve a PCE of 8.73% after UV light illumination. The significantly improved device stability can be owing to the passivation of surface defects on ZnO, which can effectively suppress the light soaking issues. More importantly, ZnO@APTMS can be applied to fabricate large area and flexible OSCs by roll-to-roll Microgravure printing and exhibit excellent device performance. ZnO-APTES can be applied as a CIL in non-fullerene OSCs such as PBDB-T:IT-M and PBDB-T:ITIC systems giving high PCEs of 11.53% and 10.3%, respectively. Zn(OAc)2 is often used to prepare ZnO NPs, leading to the partial capping of ZnO NPs with acetate. We anticipated that the acetate sites on ZnO could be used for ligand exchange for ZnO modification. Keeping this in mind, we introduced a tertiary amine terminated acid, dimethyl glycine (DMG) to replace the acetate. As a consequence, the resultant ZnO-N was stable and could be stored for over a month. When ZnO-N was used as the CIL in conventional high performance non-fullerene OSCs, a high PCE close to 17% was obtained for PM6:BTP-4Cl blends. Moreover, this kind of CIL can be applied to other photoactive systems such as PM6:Y6 and PM6:IT-4F. More strikingly, Li et al. used another benzoic acid ligand terminated with ethylene glycol ether, to modify ZnO NPs. The obtained S3-ZnO based CIL could deliver PCE over 18% for both binary PM6:BO-4Cl and ternary PM6:BO-4Cl:Y6-1O based OSCs. The S3-ZnO based CIL can be fabricated with thickness up to 300 nm delivering high efficiency and improved stability.
Besides ZnO, similar strategies have also been applied to SnO2 and TiO2 NPs. Compared to ZnO, SnO2 based OSCs can display higher photo-stability. Zhou and co-workers reported that polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyethylenimine (PEI) can be utilized to modify the SnO2 NPs to eliminate the “S” shape. It was revealed that PEO and PEI can interact with SnO2 to form favorable interface dipoles and reduce the work function, leading to improved charge collection. Moreover, the modified SnO2 based CIL can effectively increase the device stability. Recently, Tan and co-workers reported the synthesis of a sulfonate electrolyte PAS to passivate defects on SnO2. The work function can be effectively adjusted and furthermore the conductivity can be increased. When applied as the CIL in PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-ec9 based OSCs, high PCEs of 16.37 and 17.12% could be obtained in the inverted device structure. What's more, the PAS passivated SnO2 based devices can display much improved stability even under continuous illumination. Similarly, TiO2 NPs also need to be improved by ligand modification. As early as in 2014, Jiu and Fang et al. reported that the insulating oleic acid ligands on the as-synthesized TiO2 are unfavorable for charge extraction. So they conducted ligand exchange using 1,10-phenanthroline to remove long alkyl chains. As a result, the properties of TiO2-Ph films could be greatly improved, thus the device performance was enhanced. Wang et al. reported a strategy of employing titanium(diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) derived titanium oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) to passivate TiO2. After treating with UV-light irradiation and rinsing with an amine polar solvent, ethanolamine, the resultant TiO2:TOPD film can provide much improved performance of corresponding inverted OSCs. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM based device displayed a high PCE up to 10.55%. The obtained OSCs display considerably enhanced stability compared to their counterpart device in the regular configuration. Recently, we used a simple p-dimethylamine benzoic acid to decorate TiO2 NPs forming a clear and stable solution. The obtained TiO2-N can be fabricated into films on top of the photoactive layer. As a result, non-fullerene acceptor-based OSCs delivered much improved efficiencies compared to those based on pristine TiO2 NPs (Table 2).

Focusing on the defects and roughness on inorganic oxide surfaces, researchers also developed surface modification on pre-formed metal-oxide films through a self-assembled/ultrathin monolayer, which can result in better energy level alignment and surface passivation with enhanced device performance and stability. As early as in 2012, Gong et al. reported that when depositing a thin layer of PFNBr on ZnO, a record PCE of 8.4% for inverted OSCs was obtained at that time. It was revealed that the PFNBr interlayer can facilitate efficient electron transport and suppress the bimolecular recombination on ZnO. Chang and Leu obtained similar results by using neutral PFN modified ZnO in PTB7:PC71BM based OSCs. Chen et al. synthesized a series of this kind of conjugated polyelectrolytes with varied backbones. When casting on ZnO, the resulting ZnO/PFEO-b-PTNBr ETL can increase the PCE of P3HT:PC61BM based OSCs to 3.8% compared to 3.0% with the bare ZnO ETL. It was revealed that ohmic contact can be realized with PFEO-b-PTNBr self-assembled electrolytes. Wong and Jones et al. reported the synthesis of a polyfluorene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte PFS-FTEG through a green route. PFS-FTEG can be processed with alcohol on ZnO to improve the surface properties leading to more efficient PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs with an improved PCE of 10.75%. Tu and Zhang et al. used the fluorine based polyelectrolyte bearing sulfonate and ethylene glycol side chains to modify ZnO film. Non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs with PBDB-T:IT-M as the photoactive layer can also afford higher efficiency by using ZnO/PFEOSO3Li as the double layer ETL. Moreover, some non-conjugated materials incorporating polar groups can also be used to passivate the surface defects of ZnO films, which is helpful in increasing the device stability. Courtright and Jenekhe reported that PEI can act as a better modifier than PEIE and the improved efficiency is highly dependent on the molecular weight of PEI. The PBDTT-FTTE:PC71BM based OSCs with ZnO/PEI(750k molecular weight) can achieve a high PCE of 8.27% and retain 86% of its initial PCE after 3 months, both of which are superior to those based on ZnO/PEI(800 molecular weight). Similar results have been observed in non-fullerene OSCs by Zhou et al. The processing solvents, water or iso-propanol, are critical to the passivating effects of PEI on ZnO. The ZnO/a-PEI from the aqueous solution displayed much improved illumination stability (Fig. 4a). Since PEI is typically synthesized from poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOz), Kim and co-workers employed PEOz as a buffer layer on ZnO. As a result, PEOz can form nanodot morphology on ZnO and the resulting ZnO/PEOz ETL provided a high PCE of 9.53% for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs. Chen and co-workers demonstrated that small molecule electrolytes can also effectively passivate ZnO. They reported the synthesis of PNSO3Na which can be cast on ZnO to form a smooth thin layer. The work function was also tuned and when applied in PBDB-T:ITIC based OSCs, PCEs of 9.9% and 11.2% could be obtained without or with the PNSO3Na interlayer. It was revealed that the morphology of the photoactive layer can also be optimized by inserting the PNSO3Na layer. Furthermore, simple amino acids such as glycine and sarcosine or thiophenol, 2-phenylethylmercaptan (PET), can be used to passivate ZnO providing higher performing non-fullerene based OSCs. Specifically, device performance and stability can be simultaneously improved by treating the ZnO films with PET through surface –OH group regulation. Consequently, a high T80 life time over 4000 h has been successfully realized.

Other functional materials, especially organic conjugated molecules, have been used to modify ZnO. Xie et al. reported that cross-linked PBI on ZnO can be further reduced to radical anions, which are rather stable in the presence of the protective couterions, tetraoctylammonium (TOA+). This led to the formation of a directional interfacial dipole between Al doped ZnO, AZO and the photoactive layer. As a result, the PCE of PTB7:PC71BM based OSCs with AZO/poly-PBI˙−–TOA+ can be increased to 9.23%, which is obviously higher than the 5.00% of OSCs with unreduced AZO/poly-PBI. Draper et al. inserted amino acid terminated PBI between ZnO and the photoactive layer, and the P3HT:PC61BM based OSCs could be thus improved to give an efficiency of 2.55%. Bo, Wu and Xu et al. reported that the typical non-fullerene acceptor ITIC can be used to form a buffer layer on ZnO. To avoid the erosion of the ITIC layer in fabricating the active layer, they developed the spontaneously spreading-film technique for device manufacture. Consequently, the double layer ETL can exhibit better charge extraction and transport and a PCE of 8.07% was achieved for PTB7-Th:PC71BM. Before that, Xie and co-workers reported that conjugated molecules containing the IDT/IDTT core and BI-H/NI-H end groups can form J-aggregates on ZnO films. The electron mobility can be thus improved. PBDB-T:ITIC based OSCs can display an elevated PCE of 10.65%. In addition, small conjugated molecules such as IIDTh-NSB, PBD and two BODIP-containing BZnTPP and Py-BDP, have also been utilized to improve the ZnO surface properties and enhanced PCEs have been realized in both fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. It is worth noting that, although it is possible that the inserted layer, especially the neutral type, might be influenced by the solvents of the active layer, positive effects on the device performance can also be observed. On the other hand, functional molecules with strong coordinating groups such as carboxylic acids should be more anti-erosive on ZnO. Yip et al. adopted a COOH functionalized fullerene molecule C60-SAM to form a thin layer on ZnO. The resulting PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based OSCs can display not only higher PCE, but also a long T80 lifetime up to 20 years. Li and co-workers also demonstrated that small acids can form a monolayer on ZnO to not only passivate the surface defects but also increase non-fullerene acceptor segregation near the n-contact interface (Fig. 4b and c). As a result, the OSCs can display much improved overall performance and photo stability. Very recently, Chen and coworkers reported a naphthalene based modifying agent, NMA, to surface-treat preformed ZnO films. Consequently, better energy level alignment and improved conductivities could be thus obtained. High PCEs over 18% have been realized in the D18:N3 system. Moreover, the OSCs can display an extrapolated T80 lifetime of 7572 h, corresponding to 5 years under outdoor exposure. Ru coordination complex type sensitizers can also modify the ZnO film. What's more, a 2D MOF layer has been used to obtain a hybrid with PEIE, and the MOF-PEIE composite between ZnO and the active layer can significantly improve the conductivity, tune aligned energy levels and thus reduce the charge recombination. Although ZnO-based double layer CILs can afford high PCEs and much improved light stability, the sophisticated processing approach is not so friendly to scale R2R manufacturing, and this kind of CILs have been rarely adopted to fabricate large area and flexible OSCs.
Exploration of TiOx and SnOx based double layer CILs has also been reported. To passivate the TiOx surface, Li and Zhang et al. spin-cast a layer of PEI on a magnetron sputtered TiOx ETL, where the PEI layer was controlled to be below 10 nm. The double layered TiOx/PEI based ETL displayed higher electron mobility and decreased series resistance. Consequently, PTB7:PC71BM based OSCs with TiOx/PEI gave a much increased PCE of 9.08%, compared to the 7.00% and 7.38% for those with individual PEI or TiOx as the ETL, respectively. Jiang and Fang et al. employed a fullerene derivative C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA) to modify the TiO2 nanotube based ETL. Improved surface properties can thus be obtained, which further result in an obvious PCE enhancement to 8.74%. Vasilopoulou and Coutsolelos et al. reported a porphyrin modifier terminated with two carboxylic acids bridged with a triazine spacer TPPtriazinegly2Zn, which was spin cast on 50 nm thick TiO2. As a result, the work function could be reduced to 3.7 eV. Moreover, the surface energy of TiO2 can be decreased and the interfacial contact with the photoactive layer can thus be improved. All these factors can enable more efficient charge extraction. The device with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer displayed an average PCE of 8.73%, much higher than the 6.52% of the control devices using the pristine TiO2 ETL. In addition to TiO2, the bare SnO2 ETL can also be improved by this kind of layer surface modification. Shen, Bai and co-workers employed the typical fluorene based polymer PFN to form an ultrathin layer on SnO2. The thickness of the PFN layer was estimated to be ca. 3 nm. Owing to the interfacial dipole moment, the energy level alignment can be effectively realized. The corresponding OSCs of PTB7-Th:PC71BM with the SnO2/PFN ETL displayed remarkable PCE enhancement to 11.05% compared to the low PCE of 4.31% based on the bare SnO2 ETL. Recently, Yang and Zhao et al. reported a kind of double layer CIL of LiF/PFNBr or LiF/PDINO in conventional OSCs. The LiF layer was deposited by vacuum evaporation with ca. 1 nm thickness, which can act as the optical spacer layer to optimize the light intensity distribution resulting in better light harvesting. Meanwhile, the work function can also be tuned leading to better energy level alignment. As a consequence, both Voc and FF of the OSCs can be increased (Table 3).

Beyond metal oxides, there are numerous simple metal–ligand based coordination complexes, which can be easily synthesized, or are even commercially available. It has been demonstrated that by selecting a suitable combination of metal ions and organic ligands, these coordination complexes can lead to aligned energy levels and display moderate electron mobility, thus facilitating efficient charge extraction and transport. Notably, both inverted and regular OSCs have been obtained by using these coordination complex based CILs. Fan and Zhu reported that zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) is soluble in a range of organic solvents from chloroform to methanol. Interestingly, ZrAcac can act as an efficient cathode buffer layer providing high performing inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs with a PCE of 9.21%. Tan et al. reported that titanium(IV) oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) and aluminum(III) acetylacetonate (Al(acac)3) can also be used to fabricate inverted OSCs, especially the non-fullerene OSCs. Although the semitransparent PM6:Y6 OSCs with Al(acac)3 as the CIL achieved a moderate PCE, its average visible transmittance (AVT) was up to 25.33%. When TOPD is used as the CIL to fabricate inverted OSCs, vertical phase separation of the photoactive layer can be realized, which is beneficial for enhancing device efficiency. Tan's group further reported that similar Zr and Hf based coordination complexes can be used as CILs for regular OSCs. For the Hf(ACB1)4 CIL (Fig. 5), PM6:BTP-eC9 based OSCs delivered a high efficiency up to 17.13%. Moreover, the device stability based on the Hf complex is superior to that based on Ca. Very recently, they applied another Hf based complex, Hf(ACBN)4, which can form an assembling layer on SnO2 driven by hydrogen bonding, as a surface modifier on SnO2. As a result, high PCE over 18% could be achieved in the inverted OSCs. They claimed that Hf(ACBN)4 can act as a UV light filter resulting in better illumination stability. Another type is 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, which can undergo complexation with Li and Al. Chen et al. reported that 8-hydroxyquinolinatolithium (s-Liq or LiQ) can facilitate ohmic contact with the Al electrode, thus giving a PCE of 8.37% for PTB7:PC71BM based regular OSCs. When composited with PEIE, the resultant PEIE–LiQ can be used as a CIL in inverted OSCs, delivering a PCE of 10.10% in PBDTT-FTTE:PC71BM type OSCs. Peng et al. synthesized a series of ammonium appendant fluorine modified tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum(III) (Alq3), in which Alq3-F2 can afford both efficient fullerene and non-fullerene regular OSCs. Owing to the high electron mobility, the Alq3-containing CILs can retain about 70–80% of the optimized highest PCE even with a large thickness up to 50 nm.

2,9-Dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) is a kind of cathode buffer layer commonly used in optoelectronics. Fang's group reported that the complex formed from BCP and CdS can act as a CIL for inverted OSCs, providing a high PCE of 8.36% for PTB7:PC71BM based devices. It was reported that iridium (Ir) complexes could also be processed as CILs for regular OSCs, but the obtained PCE of 12.38% for the PM6:Y6 system was rather moderate. Moreover, metallophthalocyanine and naphthalocyanine derivatives have also been designed to be used as CILs in OSCs with conventional structures. These small molecules are alcohol soluble and processed on top of the photoactive layer, giving both high performance fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. Thereinto, silicon naphthalocyanine tetraimides, SiNcTI-Br, can be optimized providing high PCEs within thicknesses between 9 and 27 nm. Recently, He, Xia and Tan et al. reported that metal–nanographene containing large transition metals involving dπ–pπ conjugated systems can be efficient CILs, providing an encouraging PCE exceeding 18% for PM6:BTP-eC9 based OSCs. What's more, Margeat and co-workers reported a class of soluble bismuth halide anion salts which can be processed as CILs in regular OSCs, giving fullerene OSCs with high PCEs. Although these coordination complexes can enable OSCs with high PCEs, most of them cannot be processed with thick films and meanwhile provide comparable efficiencies to those using thin CILs. This is probably due to their low conductivity, and the charge transport should possibly undergo tunneling through the CIL to the electrode (Table 4).

Recently, Nian and co-workers reported that organic hybridized silica nanodots (OSiNDs) can be used as efficient CILs for both inverted fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs, which showed a high PCE up to 17.15% for ternary PM6:Y6:PC71BM and displayed superior stability in comparison with the OSCs using the traditional ZnO CIL. Despite exhibiting amazing device performance, these hybrid oxides lack detailed structural information for a deeper understanding of their structure–performance relationship. On the other hand, oxide clusters, especially some kinds of metal-oxo clusters, have been studied as molecular models of their metal oxide nanoparticle counterparts. The clusters are usually synthesized with atomically precise structures and can display similar physicochemical properties to the corresponding metal oxides. The synthesis is usually finished with a sol–gel process under solvothermal conditions with considerable yields and batch scales. This can often result in achieving flexibility of desired properties to fulfill different application requirements. The metal-oxo cores are usually robust enough to allow modification of various ligands on their surface. The application of metal-oxo clusters, such as POMs, in different optoelectronics, has attracted much research attention. Vasilopoulou et al. have reported that water soluble lacunary polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as an inserted layer between a TiO2 ETL and an organic blend layer to improve the interfacial connection. As a result, increased efficiencies, device lifetime and photo-stability can be simultaneously realized. Li and co-workers developed another kind of POM based CILs, composed of [SiW12O40]4− anion and four balanced organic ammonium cations, for efficient fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. They revealed that these hybrid POMs can display aligned energy levels between metal electrodes and the photoactive layer, facilitating much improved charge transport. This kind of POM CIL can be applied to a variety of active blends including PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7:PC71BM, PM6:Y6 and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl. And high efficiencies over 16% and 17% have been obtained for Y6 and BTP-BO-4Cl based OSCs (Fig. 6), respectively.

Since TiO2 has played paramount roles in the development of emerging thin film solar cells such as dye sensitized SCs, perovskite SCs and OSCs, we decided to devote our efforts towards the molecular model of TiO2, Ti-oxo clusters (TOCs) for developing novel TOC based CILs and tried to establish the corresponding structure–performance relationship. For example, we started with an easily accessible cyclic Ti-oxo cluster (CTOC), which can be synthesized in the gram scale. CTOC can be dissolved in trifluoroethanol. However, when bare CTOC is used as the CIL directly, a moderate PCE of 15% was obtained for PM6:BTP-4Cl. We thus learned the molecular design of classical organic CIL materials, for instance PFNBr, and made molecular tailoring on CTOC by introducing four ammonium salts (Fig. 7a). As a consequence, the resultant CTOC-N-Br can be dissolved in methanol and the solution is rather stable for over months. More importantly, the fabricated PM6:BTP-4Cl based OSCs provided a higher PCE of 17.19%, which can be attributed to the thoroughly enhanced parameters of Voc, Jsc and FF. It was found that CTOC-N-Br can display more aligned energy levels, increased conductivity and charge mobility. CTOC can also be improved by decorating with BPTI units through the reactive alcohol sites on the surface. Differently, small TOCs, such as Ti6, Ti8 and Ti12 (Fig. 7b), which are soluble in methanol, can provide high PCEs by using these bare TOCs without further modification. These results clearly suggest that TOCs can be a novel kind of CILs with significant prospects for efficient OSCs, while both the Ti-oxo cores and surface organic groups play crucial roles in their functions in OSC devices (Table 5).

Enormous research attention has been devoted to hybrid CILs over the past decade to promote the spurring development of OSCs. Owing to the good composition and structural design flexibility, the hybrid CIL holds great potential in overcoming the drawbacks of pure inorganic or organic CIL materials. Hybrid CIL materials can be designed to combine both advantages of organic and inorganic compositions and accommodate different BHJ photoactive layers. There are several aspects that also need to be paid more attention.

(1) With respect to metal oxides, such as ZnO, the effects of the hybridization on work function adjustment, charge communication with the photoactive layer and charge mobilities have been thoroughly investigated. The problems associated with the photo-doping behavior and the “S” shape of corresponding OSCs can be effectively reduced. However, the detailed impacts of these introduced organic constituents on the electronic structure of ZnO, especially the surface electron layer or surface two-dimensional electron gas, which should be inherently correlated with the electron extraction and transport, remain less understood. Deeper investigations or simulations are needed. Furthermore, as a kind of attractive CIL materials which can be solution processed with thick films while being able to provide high efficiencies, ZnO based hybrid CILs should be devoted more efforts with respect to large area R2R fabrication and even flexible OSC modulus in the future.
(2) For simple coordination complex based CILs, although high PCE values have been achieved in various photoactive layer based OSCs, their working mechanism should be substantially different from those of typical inorganic metal oxides. In principle, the charge conducting model in the coordination complex films should differ from those in metal oxides. Since most coordination complexes display low conductivity and thickness dependent performance, the charge transport should be via a tunneling process. More research efforts should be devoted towards this issue for deeper understanding and further enhancement.
(3) Cluster based CIL materials, especially those corresponding to traditional inorganic metal oxides, are now emerging as a kind of promising CILs. They not only have core structures analogous to metal oxide phase structures, but also possess variable surface groups, and the linking mode between surface groups and the cores can be definitely expressed. This is valuable for establishing a clear structure–performance relationship, especially from the point beyond traditional metal oxides and pure organic materials, and holds great promise in producing more efficient CILs, which are beneficial for alleviating the obstacles of OSCs, such as the scalable roll-to-roll manufacturing and high power output stability issues.
To conclude, great efforts have been devoted to hybrid CIL materials from the aspects of both inorganic and organic constituents, which resulted in excellent CILs and corresponding OSCs. With respect to the thickness sensitivity of different hybrid interlayers, it is obvious that metal oxides, especially ZnO based hybrid CILs can display better film thickness-insensitive device performance. So ZnO based hybrid CILs have been preliminarily used to fabricate flexible and large area OSCs. For comparison, coordination complex and cluster based CIL materials can give high efficiencies with very thin films in most cases. Nonetheless, they can provide interesting insight on the interfacial modification and charge communication, which should be important for developing more excellent CIL materials in the future. Particularly, most hybrid CIL materials can exhibit great potential in yielding high PCEs and improving the storage/illumination stability. However, the relationship between the thermal stability of devices and specific CILs has been less discussed in the literature, therefore it should draw more attention as it is necessary for future scale-up and commercialization of OSCs.
