The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.00% was achieved in PBDB-T:Y16-based polymer solar cells (PSCs). On this basis, PCE of ternary PSCs was improved to 14.11% by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 in acceptors, resulting from simultaneously enhanced short circuit current (JSC) of 22.76 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 68.22%. The observed 14.11% PCE is among the highest values for all ternary PSCs. Y16 and MeIC1 preferred to form an alloyed acceptor due to good compatibility, which is beneficial to the formation of efficient electron transport channels in ternary active layers. Photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge transport could be synergistically optimized by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors. The optical field and photogenerated exciton distribution in active layers were calculated according to their intrinsic properties, which could provide more intuitive evidence of JSC and FF improvement. The photogenerated exciton distribution in active layers could also be optimized by employing a ternary strategy, which was beneficial for better balance charge collection efficiency and for achieving high FF of the ternary PSCs. This work further demonstrates that ternary strategies have great potential for improving the PSC performance by simultaneously optimizing photon harvesting and photogenerated exciton distribution in active layers.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been recognized as promising for converting sunlight to electricity due to their advantages of low cost, flexibility, large-area fabrication and semitransparency. The significant progress of PSCs should be mainly attributed to the innovations of materials and device engineering. Emerging as a new material in the PSC field, nonfullerene materials have caught intense interest due to their excellent optical absorption ability, easily tunable chemical structures and energy levels. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 14% for nonfullerene PSCs with a single bulk heterojunction. It is well-recognized that organic materials almost exhibit relatively narrow absorption spectra. The photon harvesting ability of active layers should be limited with one donor and one acceptor, which can be enhanced by incorporating a third component with an appropriate optical band gap. It is meaningful to combine the advantages of nonfullerene materials and ternary strategies for achieving highly efficient PSCs. A ternary strategy has been commonly considered as an effective and simple method to improve the performance of PSCs by adjusting the relative content of the two donors or two acceptors. Most ternary PSCs were designed with the complementary absorption spectra of the used materials as active layers to improve short circuit current density (JSC). In addition to the markedly enhanced photon harvesting ability of active layers, optical field and photogenerated exciton distribution can also be finely adjusted due to the dependence of the varied absorption coefficients and extinction coefficients of the active layers on the component content. Meanwhile, the compatibility and energy levels of the used materials also play vital roles in influencing the charge transport in ternary active layers for achieving a relatively high fill factor (FF). The good compatibility of the used materials provides more potential to finely optimize the phase separation degree, where the third component plays a vital role as a morphology regulator. Meanwhile, two donors or two acceptors with good compatibility may also prefer to form an alloyed state for efficient charge transport in ternary active layers. The appropriate energy levels of the used materials should be beneficial to achieve a relatively high open circuit voltage (VOC) and should form cascaded charge transfer channels for less charge loss. The three key photovoltaic parameters can be simultaneously optimized by incorporating an appropriate third component. Here, the typical progress of ternary PSCs based on the corresponding binary PSCs with over 11% PCE is summarized in Table 1. The working mechanism of ternary PSCs can be summarized as energy transfer (ET), charge transfer (CT) and alloyed model (AM). The compatibility of used materials is a vital factor in determining the intermolecular dynamic processes that are strongly dependent on the intermolecular distance.

In this work, a series of binary and ternary inverted PSCs were fabricated with a wide-band-gap material PBDB-T as the donor and a narrow-band-gap nonfullerene material Y16, MeIC1 or Y16:MeIC1 as the acceptor. PCEs of two binary PSCs reached 13.00% and 9.42% with Y16 and MeIC1 as the acceptors, respectively. The PCE of ternary PSCs increased to 14.11% by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, resulting from the simultaneously enhanced JSC and FF. The PCE of 14.11% is among the highest values of ternary PSCs. The optical field and photogenerated exciton distribution in the ternary active layers were first simulated according to the transfer matrix method, which could provide more intuitive evidence of the performance improvement in ternary PSCs. In addition to the enhanced photon harvesting of the ternary active layers, the photogenerated exciton distribution can be well optimized by adjusting the content of the third component. The calculated photogenerated exciton density in the entire region of the active layer can be improved by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, which supports the improved JSC of ternary PSCs. The enhanced photogenerated exciton density in the near middle region of the ternary active layer should be beneficial to balance charge transport and collection, leading to FF improvement in the ternary PSCs. Meanwhile, the phase separation degree of the active layers can be optimized by incorporating an appropriate amount of MeIC1 as a morphology regulator. The enhanced JSC and FF can well compensate for the slight VOC loss by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 into the acceptors, resulting in over 8.5% PCE improvement compared with that of 13.00% for the Y16-based binary PSCs. In this work, specific insights into the ternary strategy for the performance improvement of PSCs were first proposed from photogenerated exciton distribution in the active layers, which strongly influenced charge transport and collection efficiency. The well-optimized photogenerated exciton distribution should be beneficial to simultaneously improve JSC and FF of ternary PSCs.

The chemical structures of the used materials are displayed in Fig. 1a. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Y16 lie between the corresponding energy levels of PBDB-T and MeIC1, as shown in Fig. 1b. The cascaded energy levels of the used materials may provide multiple possible pathways for charge transfer in ternary active layers. In addition to the appropriate energy levels of the used materials, enhanced photon harvesting of ternary active layers should also play a vital role in determining the performance of ternary PSCs. The normalized absorption spectra of neat PBDB-T, Y16 and MeIC1 films are exhibited in Fig. 1c. Neat PBDB-T, MeIC1 and Y16 films exhibit absorption peaks at around 630 nm, 720 nm and 820 nm, respectively. Obviously, complementary absorption spectra can be observed, which should have great potential in the preparation of efficient ternary PSCs. The absorption spectra of blend films with different MeIC1 contents were obtained (Fig. 1d). It is apparent that the absorption spectrum of PBDB-T:Y16 blend films covers a broad spectral range from 300 nm to 950 nm with an apparent dip from 670 nm to 730 nm. The absorption spectral dip can be slightly compensated along with the increase in the MeIC1 content in ternary blend films. In fact, the absorption spectra of blend films are rather different from those of the corresponding active layers in cells, which should be attributed to the interference effect between the incident light and the reflected light from the Ag electrode. The interference effect plays a vital role in determining photon harvesting and photogenerated exciton distribution in active layers.

The optical field distribution in cells consisting of ITO (120 nm)/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (110 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was simulated by using the transfer matrix method, as shown in Fig. 2a–c. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the blend films were measured using a spectroscopic ellipsometer, as shown in Fig. S1. The optical field distribution in the cells can be adjusted due to the altered optical constants of active layers with different MeIC1 contents. The markedly distinct interference fringes can be observed due to the different extinction coefficients of the active layers. The relatively weak interference fringes can be observed in the strong absorption spectral range of active layers (marked in Fig. 2a–c); this is observed because most photons have been harvested by active layers before arriving at the Ag electrode. Obvious interference fringes can be observed in the near infrared (NIR) region of the cells with PBDB-T:MeIC1 as active layers due to the rather weak photon harvesting in this spectral range. It is well-known that the position of the photogenerated excitons in active layers strongly influences the charge collection efficiency. According to the optical field distribution in cells and the extinction coefficient of the active layers, the photogenerated exciton distribution can be calculated in the active layers, as shown in Fig. 2d–f. The detailed calculation process of the photogenerated exciton distribution is described in the ESI. Apparently, the photogenerated exciton distribution in active layers can be markedly adjusted by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 into the acceptors, especially in the NIR region. The photogenerated exciton density in the entire active layer can be calculated according to the transfer matrix. The calculated photogenerated exciton density values are 3.37 × 1029 s−1 m−3, 3.48 × 1029 s−1 m−3 and 2.47 × 1029 s−1 m−3 in PBDB-T:Y16, PBDB-T:Y16:MeIC1 and PBDB-T:MeIC1 active layers, respectively, which supports the JSC improvement of ternary PSCs. The photogenerated electrons and holes in the middle of the active layers may be more efficiently collected due to the similar transport distance to that of the individual electrode. The calculated photogenerated exciton density values near the middle 50 nm region of the active layer are 1.68 × 1029 s−1 m−3, 1.74 × 1029 s−1 m−3 and 1.25 × 1029 s−1 m−3 in PBDB-T:Y16, PBDB-T:Y16:MeIC1 and PBDB-T:MeIC1 active layers, respectively. The enhanced photogenerated exciton density in the near middle region of the ternary active layers should be beneficial to balance charge transport and collection for achieving high FF. The photogenerated exciton distribution in active layers can provide more solid evidence to understand the JSC and FF improvement of ternary PSCs.
A series of PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO (120 nm)/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (110 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm), and the weight ratio of donor to acceptor(s) was kept constant at 1:1 (wt/wt). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of all PSCs were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as displayed in Fig. 3a. PCE of 13.00% was achieved in Y16-based binary PSCs with JSC of 21.33 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.914 V and FF of 66.69%. The MeIC1-based binary PSCs exhibited a relatively low PCE of 9.42% with JSC of 15.94 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.889 V and FF of 66.45%. The distinctly different JSCs can be well explained by the absorption spectra of Y16 and MeIC1. Over 66% FFs of the two binary PSCs indicated the good compatibility of the used materials, which is the prerequisite to prepare efficient ternary PSCs. PCE of 14.11% was achieved in the optimized ternary PSCs with 15 wt% MeIC1 in acceptors, which is among the highest values reported for ternary PSCs. JSC and FF could be simultaneously increased from 21.33 mA cm−2 to 22.76 mA cm−2 and from 66.69% to 68.22% by incorporating 15 wt% MeIC1 into the acceptors, respectively. VOC of the optimized ternary PSCs was 0.909 V and was slightly lower than 0.914 V of the Y16-based binary PSCs. The enhanced JSC and FF can well compensate for the slightly decreased VOC, resulting in over 8.5% PCE improvement of ternary PSCs. It should be highlighted that FFs of all ternary PSCs are larger than those of the two binary PSCs, indicating that the used materials have good compatibility to form efficient charge transport channels in the ternary active layers. The excellent FF value of ternary PSCs improved to 70.08% by incorporating 30 wt% MeIC1 in acceptors, suggesting that MeIC1 can be used as a morphology regulator to finely optimize the phase separation degree for efficient charge transport and collection in ternary PSCs. The shunt resistance (RSH) and series resistance (RS) were calculated according to the J–V curves of PSCs. RS slightly decreased and then increased along with the increase in the MeIC1 content; RSH exhibited an opposite trend. The varied FF values of ternary PSCs can be well explained by the corresponding RSH and RS values. Although FF reached the maximal value of 70.08% for ternary PSCs with 30 wt% MeIC1 in acceptors, JSCs of ternary PSCs already decreased for contents of more than 15 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors due to the weakened photon harvesting in the long wavelength region. According to the J–V curves, the key photovoltaic parameters of PSCs are summarized in Table 2.

The EQE spectra of PSCs with different MeIC1 contents were measured (Fig. 3b). The EQE values of ternary PSCs gradually enhanced in the whole spectral range for MeIC1 contents up to 15 wt% in the acceptors. The slightly enhanced EQE values were attributed to the well-balanced photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge transport in the active layers with appropriate MeIC1 contents. The EQE values of ternary PSCs decreased in the whole spectral range when the MeIC1 contents were more than 15 wt% in the acceptors, which can be explained by the relatively low EQE values of MeIC1-based binary PSCs. According to the J–V curves of all PSCs, VOC dependence on the MeIC1 content is depicted in Fig. 3c. VOCs monotonously and slightly decreased from 0.914 V to 0.889 V when the MeIC1 content was increased up to 100 wt% in the acceptors. It is well-known that VOCs should be mainly determined by the energy levels of hole and electron transport for PSCs with the same interfacial layers and electrodes. All photogenerated holes will be transported along the channels formed by PBDB-T with constant HOMO levels in all PSCs with different MeIC1 contents. The gradually varied VOC values of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the varied LUMO levels caused by the alloyed acceptor dependence on the MeIC1 content. Y16 and MeIC1 were intimately mixed and electronically coupled to form an alloyed state based on their good compatibility. Under an alloy state, the electrons on two acceptors prefer to transfer onto the mixed energy level rather than transfer from one material to another material. This indicates that intermolecular charge transfer should be negligible in the ternary active layers. To further investigate the intermolecular interaction between Y16 and MeIC1, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat Y16, MeIC1 and their blend films were measured under 700 nm light excitation conditions, as shown in Fig. 3d. It is apparent that MeIC1 has a strong and broad PL emission with a PL peak at 770 nm. Y16 exhibits a relatively weak PL emission with a PL peak at 850 nm. The emission intensity of MeIC1 is markedly quenched in the blend Y16:MeIC1 films, and this is observed even for the blend film with 50 wt% MeIC1 content. Meanwhile, the emission intensity of Y16 can be monotonously enhanced as the MeIC1 content is increased up to 50 wt% in the blend films. This phenomenon indicates efficient energy transfer from MeIC1 to Y16, which can be well supported by the apparent spectral overlap between the PL spectrum of MeIC1 and the absorption spectrum of Y16, as shown in Fig. S2. According to the above analysis, we infer that Y16 and MeIC1 prefer to form an alloyed state with mixed energy levels due to their good compatibility, which is beneficial for the formation of efficient electron transport channels. The alloyed state of the two acceptors may be beneficial for efficient energy transfer from MeIC1 to Y16, which is conducive to exciton utilization in the ternary active layers.
To gain more insights into photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, and charge collection in active layers, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the binary and the optimized ternary PSCs were measured (Fig. 4a). The Jph and Veff values were calculated by JL − JD and V0 − Va, respectively; here, JL and JD represent the current densities under standard simulated light and in dark conditions, respectively, and V0 and Va represent the voltage at Jph = 0 and the applied voltage, respectively. Assuming that all excitons can be dissociated into free charges and all the photogenerated charges can be extracted by electrodes at high Veff of 4.5 V. The saturated current density (Jsat) of the optimized ternary PSCs was 24.43 mA cm−2, which was larger than 23.04 mA cm−2 of PBDB-T:Y16-based PSCs or 17.44 mA cm−2 of PBDB-T:MeIC1-based PSCs. More photons could be harvested in the optimized ternary active layers, which can be confirmed from the largest Jsat value observed. The Jph/Jsat value represents the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) under a maximum power output condition. The corresponding values were 79.3%, 78.5% and 76.0% for the optimized ternary, PBDB-T:Y16-based and PBDB-T:MeIC1-based PSCs. The optimized ternary PSCs exhibited higher ηcoll compared with the corresponding binary PSCs, which can well explain the improved FF of 68.22%. The detailed Jph, Jsat and Jph/Jsat values of binary PSCs and the optimized ternary PSCs are summarized in Table S1. The space charge limited current (SCLC) model was employed to investigate the effect of MeIC1 content on the charge transport in active layers. The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layers/PDIN/Al, respectively. The ln(Jd3/V2)–(V/d)0.5 curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices with different MeIC1 contents are displayed in Fig. S3 and the detailed values of charge mobility are summarized in Table S2. Both hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in blend films show a decreasing trend with increasing MeIC1 content. To intuitively exhibit this trend, μh and μe and μh/μe dependence on the MeIC1 content is shown in Fig. 4b. The μh and μe values slightly decreased from 8.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 6.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and from 5.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 4.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively with increase in MeIC1 contents from 0 wt% to 100 wt% in acceptors. The μh/μe value was 1.68 for the PBDB-T:Y16-based device, and the ratio decreased to 1.60 for the optimized ternary device with 15 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors. More balanced charge transport with a μh/μe ratio of 1.57 could be achieved for the devices with 30 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, which was in accordance with the relatively high FF of 70.08% for the corresponding ternary PSCs.
The J–V curves of typical PSCs were measured under different illumination intensities to clarify the effect of incorporating MeIC1 on the charge recombination process in active layers, as shown in Fig. S4. According to the J–V curves, the dependence of JSC and VOC on the illumination intensity (I) was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5a, the relationship between JSC and I can be described as JSC ∝ Iα, in which α is the exponential factor. The fitted α values are 0.91, 0.88, and 0.87 for the optimized ternary, PBDB-T:Y16-based and PBDB-T:MeIC1-based PSCs, respectively. The α value of the optimized ternary PSCs is closest to 1, suggesting that bimolecular recombination in the active layers is efficiently inhibited by incorporating appropriate amounts of MeIC1. As shown in Fig. 5b, the relationship between VOC and I can be described as VOC ∝ nKT/qln(I), in which K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The slope of 2KT/q or KT/q represents that trap-assisted or bimolecular recombination is the dominant recombination mechanism in active layers, respectively. The slopes are 1.47KT/q and 1.48KT/q for PBDB-T:Y16- and PBDB-T:MeIC1-based PSCs, respectively. The optimized ternary PSCs show a much smaller slope of 1.43KT/q compared with binary PSCs, indicating that the appropriate incorporation of MeIC1 can reduce the trap-assisted recombination in active layers. The bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination can be simultaneously suppressed in the optimized ternary active layers, leading to an improved ηcoll of 79.3% and FF of 68.22% for the optimized ternary PSCs.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to investigate the surface morphology and the bulk morphology of blend films with different MeIC1 contents, respectively. The AFM height images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 6a. Relatively low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values can be obtained from all AFM images, suggesting a smooth surface of the blend films. The RMS roughness values of the blend films slightly increased from 1.01 nm to 1.50 nm as the MeIC1 content was increased from 0 wt% to 100 wt% in the acceptors. The good compatibility of the used materials could be confirmed from the tiny surface morphology variation. The influence of the MeIC1 content on the film morphology can be further investigated from the TEM images, as shown in Fig. 6b. All the TEM images of the blend films exhibit homogeneous distribution with a fibrillar structure. The thin and dense fibrillar structure can be observed from the TEM image of PBDB-T:Y16 blend film. More obvious bright and dark domains can be observed from the TEM image of the PBDB-T:MeIC1 blend film. As seen from the TEM images of ternary blend films, the fibrillar structure slightly decreases and phase separation mildly increases as the incorporation of MeIC1 is increased, indicating that the film morphology can be finely adjusted by incorporating MeIC1. The gradually and slightly altered bulk morphology of blend films suggests the good compatibility of the used materials. The optimized performance of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting, balanced exciton dissociation and charge transport and collection of ternary active layers.

In summary, highly efficient ternary PSCs were fabricated with one polymer donor PBDB-T and two well compatible nonfullerene acceptors Y16 and MeIC1. High PCE of 14.11% was achieved in ternary PSCs with 15 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, which benefited from the complementary absorption spectra, the cascaded energy levels and the good compatibility of the used materials. PCE of 14.11% is one of the best efficiencies reported in the literature so far for ternary PSCs. Over 8.5% PCE improvement was mainly derived from the simultaneously improved JSC of 22.76 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.22%, which could compensate slight VOC loss. The optimized photogenerated exciton distribution in the ternary active layers provided more solid evidence to support the JSC and FF improvement of ternary PSCs. The compatible Y16 and MeIC1 preferred to form alloyed acceptors, which was beneficial for efficient electron transport in the ternary active layer. Ternary PSCs have great potential in achieving high efficiency with a simple fabrication process, which can be a promising strategy for PSC industrialization.
