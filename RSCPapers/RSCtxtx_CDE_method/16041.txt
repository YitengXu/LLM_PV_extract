We present a method for the modification of the structure of thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) to gain two novel acceptors TPN and TIN. And a series of donor–acceptor–donor-type oligomers 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T, and 3TTIN3T, based on TPD, TPN and TIN, have been designed and synthesized for solution-processed small-molecule bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The impact of these different central acceptor moieties on their optical, electrochemical properties, morphology, and solar cell performance were studied. Optical and electrochemical data showed that structural modification of TPD exhibited a slight impact on the band gap and HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering studies revealed that the central acceptors of these oligomers played an important role in determine the morphology of solid-state packing. Oligomer 3TTPD3T showed weak crystallinity in a thin film. The larger conjugation plane counterpart 3TTPN3T showed an improved structure order. Surprisingly, the structurally twisted compound 3TTIN3T showed a strong crystalline nature with large crystalline domains of several hundred nanometers. The photovoltaic properties of these oligomers were evaluated by fabricating BHJ devices with PC71BM. 3TTPD3T/PC71BM blends with a weight ratio of 2:1 showed a best power conversion efficiency of 1.87%, with a Jsc of 4.93 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and a fill factor of 44%.

Solution-processed small-molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have received intensive attention in recent years due to their tremendous increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCE). Very recently, PCE of 6–7% have been achieved, making SMOSCs promising candidates as renewable energy sources. Although PCE of solution-processed SMOSCs are still lower than those of their polymeric counterparts, which is presumably due to their poor film quality or a less optimized BHJ morphology obtained from solution casting, systematic optimization of both material structure and device engineering will inevitably push the performance of SMOSCs to a new level. While directly comparing small molecules to their counterpart polymer, several advantages can be seen: firstly, small molecules are much purer. Past studies on BHJ solar cells clearly revealed that molecular weight and polydispersity are important factors that govern the device performance. Small molecules are monodispersed materials with well-defined chemical structures, thus the purification and analysis will be much easier and straightforward. This property, though minor as it is thought, is actually critical in increasing the reproducibility of both materials and device performance. Secondly, small molecules are more synthetically viable. Different functional groups and atoms can be feasibly engineered onto the target molecules, which can be used to tune the absorption and energy level of the materials, thus a solid structure–property relationship can be obtained. This route was proven to be quite successful, as seen from previous research, high open voltage materials can be easily obtained in small molecules. In the current state of SMOSCs research, the materials optimization is still of high priority. There is an urgent need to scrutinize the functional units and build conjugated molecules to test their performance. The enlargement of a material library will be the first step for further device engineering and physical property studies.

After the first utilization of thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) in polymer solar cells by Leclerc and coworkers in 2010, TPD derivatives have been widely used to construct donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers due to the strongly electron-withdrawing ability of its imide group (Scheme 1). By copolymerizing with various donor units, such as bithiophene, cyclopentadithiophene, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole, and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives, the resulting TPD-based D–A conjugated polymers have shown promising performance, with a PCE of above 7% achieved. Usually the solubility and processability of TPD-based copolymers could be well tuned by introducing different alkyl chains on the imide nitrogen atom.
In an attempt to tune the electronic properties (band gap and HOMO/LUMO energy levels), we conducted a structural modification of the TPD unit by fusing it with a naphthalene unit through a pyrimidine to afford a perinone-type structure (TPN, Scheme 1). The synthesis of TPN is simply accomplished by intramolecular cyclization of an amino-imide intermediate using acetic anhydride/pyridine as the dehydrating agent. It would be interesting to design materials using these large aromatic π-systems to functionalize an existing unit with novel properties. The new TPN monomer, as can be seen from its chemical structure, has a much larger π-electron plane. Incorporating TPN to new molecular materials or polymers could enhance the intermolecular stacking in organic solids. Wang et al. and Navarrete et al. have reported that the introduction of thienoimidazole into the naphthalene and perylene monoimide or diimide results in a significant bathochromic shift in absorption spectra and a decrease in the band gap. By fusing naphthalene monoimide with a thienoimidazole unit, we can obtain TIN monomer, which is the isomer of TPN. This monomer is also incorporated to build new materials, as a direct comparison with TPN materials.
To design D–A–D-type small molecules suitable for solution casting solar cells, we choose 3,3′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene as donor. An unsubstituted thiophene unit is symmetrically inserted between 3,3′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene, therefore some rotational freedom is allowed between the octylthiophene and unsubstituted thiophene units, which curtails the effective conjugation length, lowers the HOMO level, and consequently increases oxidative stability. A series of D–A–D-type small molecules, 3TTPN3T, 3TTIN3T and 3TTPD3T, combining TPN/TIN/TPD (acceptor), 3,3′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (donor) were constructed, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The influence of structural modification of the TPD unit on the thermal properties, morphology and optoelectronic properties has been investigated. A comparison between the solution-processed OSCs based on these small molecules has also been carried out.

All chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without purification. Anhydrous diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran were distilled from sodium/benzophenone ketyl prior to use. The monomers 2,5-dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride 1, 3,3′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene 4, 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene 7 and 1,3-dibromo-5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 10 were synthesized according to the literature.


NMR spectra were collected with a Varian Mercury Plus 500 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) experiments were carried out using a Shimadzu AXIMA-CFR plus time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK.). UV-vis spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu 3150 PC spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Shimadzu thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (DSC) DTG-60H at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 with an AUTOLAB.PGSTAT30 potentiostat/galvanostat system (Ecochemie, Netherlands), which was equipped with a three-electrode cell. The sample was cast onto a glass carbon disk as a working electrode and Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. An Ag/Ag+ was used as a reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 mol L−1) was used as a supporting electrolyte. Atom force microscopy was performed with a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100, operated in the tapping mode. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed with a Beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. An X-ray beam impinged onto the sample at a grazing angle above the critical angle of the polymer film (αc = 0.16) but below the critical angle of the silicon substrate (αc = 0.24). The wavelength of X-rays used was 1.240 Å, and the scattered intensity was detected using a PILATUS 1M detector.


The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (20 ± 5 ohms per sq) were bought from Thin Film Devices Inc., and were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in an oven overnight. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP A1 4083) (∼35 nm) was spin-coated on the ultraviolet ozone-treated ITO substrates. After annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air, the substrates were transferred to the glove box. Oligomer/PC71BM chloroform solution was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm. The thickness of the film was ∼80 to 100 nm (KLA-TENCOR Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler). Finally, 1.5 nm of LiF and then a 100 nm thick Al cathode was deposited (area 6.5 mm2) on the active layer under high vacuum (2 × 10−4 Pa) using a thermal evaporator. All current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based Newport 91160 300-W solar simulator. A Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used as the white light source. The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter.


2,5-Dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride 1 (935.8 mg, 3 mmol) was added to a solution of 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (474.6 mg, 3 mmol) in dry THF (50 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. A yellow precipitate was formed. The precipitate was collected, washed with a large amount of THF, and then dried under vacuum.

Compound 3 was produced by adding 10 mL of a 50/50 by volume mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine to a suspension of yellow precipitate in 30 mL of DMF. After 12 h stirring the intensively red colored solution was poured in 100 mL of water and the yellow precipitate was filtered off. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane (1:1) as eluent to afford a yellow solid (1.13 g, 87%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.40 (d, 1H), 7.54 (t, 2H), 7.45–7.39 (m, 3H).

3,3′′-Dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene 4 (1.02 g, 2.15 mmol) was placed in 30 mL of DMF at 0 °C. Then, N-bromosuccinimide (382.7 mg, 2.15 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of DMF was added dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted by CH2Cl2. The organic layer was thoroughly washed with water, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, brine, and then dried over MgSO4. After removal of solvent the residue was purified by column chromatography with hexane as eluent to afford a yellow oil (795 mg, 67%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.21 (d, 1H), 7.07 (d, 1H), 7.03 (d, 1H), 6.97 (d, 1H), 6.92 (s, 1H), 2.81 (t, 2H), 2.75 (t, 2H), 1.69–1.61 (m, 4H), 1.40–1.29 (m, 20H), 0.92 (t, 6H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 140.25, 139.86, 136.73, 134.66, 132.73, 132.05, 130.25, 130.14, 126.45, 126.03, 123.93, 110.53, 32.03, 32.01, 30.85, 30.72, 29.71, 29.59, 29.54, 29.43, 29.40, 29.36, 22.82, 14.25.


2.5 M n-BuLi (0.5 mL, 1.25 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 5 (551 mg, 1 mmol) in dry THF (15 mL) at −78 °C under nitrogen. After stirring for 1 h at −78 °C, tributylchlorostannane (0.47 mL, 1.7 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for an additional 30 min and then gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 h. The reaction was quenched by adding water (10 mL), followed by extraction with diethyl ether. The organic phase was separated and washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (30 mL) and brine (30 mL). The solvent was evaporated from the dried (Na2SO4) extract without heating to afford a yellow oil. The freshly prepared 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)terthiophene 6 was used without purification because of instability.

A mixture of the dinitro compound 8 (500 mg, 0.45 mmol) and Sn(II)Cl2·2H2O (1.52 g, 6.75 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) and conc. HCl (5 mL) was heated to 95 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was made basic with 4 N NaOH in an ice bath. The product was extracted with dichloromethane, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated by rotary evaporation without heating to afford the title compound 9 (389.6 mg, 82%) as a dark solid.

A general procedure for the Stille coupling reaction follows. A mixture of dibromo-monomer 3 or 10 (1 equiv.), 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)terthiophene 6 (2.2 equiv.), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (1 mol%) was added to degassed toluene ([monomer] = 0.2 M). The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred and reacted at 85 °C for 2 days. After cooling to room temperature, dichloromethane was added. The organic layer was separated and washed with brine for drying over anhydrous Na2SO4. Upon evaporating off the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography with dichloromethane/hexane as eluent to yield the products.

Monomers 6 (609 mg, 0.8 mmol) and 10 (148.1 mg, 0.35 mmol) were used in the reaction mixture. 3TTPD3T was obtained as a deep reddish solid (228 mg, 54%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 7.88 (s, 2H), 7.21 (d, 2H), 7.15 (d, 2H), 7.07 (d, 2H), 6.96 (d, 2H), 3.68 (t, 2H), 2.82–2.77 (m, 8H), 1.73–1.66 (m, 10H), 1.43–1.30 (m, 50H), 0.92–0.90 (m, 15H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 162.54, 140.73, 139.90, 137.16, 135.85, 134.85, 134.34, 133.02, 130.21, 130.17, 129.84, 128.24, 126.62, 126.04, 123.96, 38.64, 31.93, 31.84, 30.71, 30.47, 29.74, 29.67, 29.65, 29.52, 29.48, 29.42, 29.39, 29.34, 29.30, 29.26, 28.66, 27.11, 22.72, 22.66, 14.15, 14.11. MS (MALDI-TOF): calcd for C70H95NO2S7 [M]+, 1205.54; found, 1206.86.


Monomers 6 (609 mg, 0.8 mmol) and 3 (152 mg, 0.35 mmol) were used in the reaction mixture. 3TTPN3T was obtained as a dark solid (290 mg, 68%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 8.36 (s, 1H), 8.13 (d, 1H), 7.56 (s, 1H), 7.19 (d, 1H), 7.12 (d, 1H), 7.05 (m, 3H), 6.96 (m, 3H), 6.89 (d, 2H), 6.86 (d, 1H), 6.84 (d, 1H), 6.78 (d, 1H), 2.78 (t, 2H), 2.72 (t, 2H), 2.55 (t, 2H), 2.36 (m, 2H), 1.67–1.56 (m, 8H), 1.34–1.26 (m, 40H), 0.94–0.89 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 157.93, 143.62, 139.79, 139.63, 139.15, 138.83, 136.00, 135.64, 135.44, 134.59, 133.73, 133.42, 132.71, 132.43, 132.34, 131.89, 130.92, 130.83, 130.13, 130.02, 129.66, 127.39, 126.80, 125.60, 125.40, 124.74, 123.50, 123.28, 122.85, 121.75, 120.19, 117.93, 108.67, 32.27, 32.06, 32.01, 30.69, 30.07, 29.98, 29.91, 29.86, 29.77, 29.65, 29.63, 29.53, 29.46, 29.42, 22.84, 22.80, 14.24. MS (MALDI-TOF): calcd for C72H84N2OS7 [M]+, 1216.46; found, 1217.40.


The synthetic routes of the monomers and target oligomers are illustrated in Scheme 2. 1,8-Diaminonaphthalene and 2,5-dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride 1 were reacted in THF to give the corresponding amino-imide intermediate, which then was converted to monomer 3via intramolecular cyclization using acetic anhydride/pyridine as dehydrating agent. The synthesis of 3TTPD3T started with terthiophene 4, which was brominated with NBS in CHCl3/AcOH at 0 °C to afford the corresponding bromoterthiophene 5 in 67% yield. Lithiation of bromoterthiophene 5 followed by quenching with tributyltin chloride afforded tributylstannaneterthiophene 6. The palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reactions of tributylstannaneterthiophene 6 with monomers 3 and 10 yielded compounds 3TTPN3T and 3TTPD3T, respectively. 3TTIN3T was synthesized using the procedure reported by Navarrete et al. The results from 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass analysis confirmed that the synthesized compounds have the predicted chemical structures. The NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the oligomers are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1–S9). Among them, the 1H NMR spectrum of 3TTPD3T displays the simplest resonance pattern for the aromatic protons. The peaks at 7.88 (singlet), 7.21 (doublet), 7.15 (doublet), 7.07 (doublet) and 6.96 (doublet) ppm could be assigned to the protons of the terthiophene unit, while the triplet peaks at 3.67 ppm are attributed to the a-protons of the octyl groups linked at the imide nitrogen of TPD unit. The 1H NMR spectra of 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T show a very similar pattern, but the peaks of the aromatic protons display a complicated mode due to the asymmetric molecular structures. All the oligomers reported here each show only a single peak corresponding to the molecular weights of 1206.8 for 3TTPD3T, 1217.4 for 3TTPN3T, and 1217.8 for 3TTIN3T, respectively. The perfect agreement between the calculated and experimentally determined m/z ratios confirms the monodispersity of the oligomers.


The thermal properties of the oligomers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The TGA analysis reveals that the 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T are 439, 450, and 413 °C, respectively (Fig. 1). This indicates that all the oligomers have good thermal stability, which is very important in device fabrication process and other kinds of applications. DSC analysis (Fig. 2) reveals that 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T have different melting peaks, which are 115.6, 128.4 and 101.7 °C, respectively. And a crystallization exothermal peak at 92.3 °C is also observed for 3TTPD3T. 3TTPN3T shows a weak endothermal peak at about 103 °C, which is due to the side chain melting of the material. When TPN unit is used, this peak is suppressed. Oligomer 3TTIN3T shows a much lower melting point compared to 3TTPN3T, suggesting that there might be a fundamental difference in the solid state packing of these two molecules.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the oligomers in diluted dichloromethane solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 3 and 4. The corresponding optoelectronic data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the maximum absorption peak at 472 nm for 3TTPD3T in solution, fusing naphthalene through a pyrimidine unit at the imide position of TPD (3TTPN3T) produces an obvious red-shift of maximum absorption to 497 nm, which can be ascribed to the increased effective conjugated length since TPN is much large than the TPD unit. It is noticed that 3TTIN3T exhibits a more blue-shifted absorption with two absorption peaks at 377 and 434 nm than the other oligomers. Due to the intramolecular steric hindrance between the septithiophene and naphthalene monoimide unit, which will be confirmed in the following theoretical calculations results, the septithiophene backbone of 3TTIN3T twists largely, thus reducing the conjugation length. The absorption coefficient of 3TTPN3T is similar to that of its isomer 3TTIN3T, while 3TTPD3T has a slightly higher absorption coefficient. The absorption spectra of these oligomers in the film state show an obvious broadening and red shift of the bands compared to the solution spectra. 3TTPD3T and 3TTPN3T exhibit shoulders at about 560 and 600 nm, respectively, which stems from intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid states. The optical band gaps of oligomers are estimated from the onset of the film absorption spectra to be 2.01 eV for 3TTPD3T, 1.89 eV for 3TTPN3T, and 1.78 eV for 3TTIN3T, respectively.

To fit the energy band structural scheme of a photovoltaic device, it is necessary to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy level of the oligomers. We carried out CV to investigate the redox properties of the oligomers. And according to de Leeuw et al., the ionization potential (EHOMO) and electron affinity (ELUMO) are approximately equal to the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential (vs. Ag/Ag+) plus 4.7 eV, respectively. All the oligomers exhibit reversible oxidation and reduction waves (Fig. 5). The anodic scan showed that the onset of oxidation for 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T, and 3TTIN3T occurred at 0.65, 0.58 and 0.35 eV, respectively, which corresponded to HOMO levels of −5.35, −5.28, and −5.05 eV. Compared with 3TTPN3T, the HOMO energy level of isomer 3TTIN3T rises about 0.23 eV. When scanning cathodically, the onset potentials of reduction for 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T are −1.19, −1.16 and −1.19 eV, respectively, corresponding to LUMO levels of −3.51, −3.54, and −3.51 eV. Compared with 3TTPD3T, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 3TTPN3T shift upwards and downwards by 0.07 and 0.03 eV, respectively. The band gaps estimated from redox properties are 1.84, 1.74, and 1.54 eV for 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T, and 3TTIN3T, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps of the oligomers are similar to the optical band gaps estimated from UV-vis absorption onset.


To gain deep insight into these materials, theoretical calculations were employed to investigate the electronic structure of the molecules. The quantum chemical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03, revision B.04, program. To minimize the calculation cost, the long alkyl chains were substituted by a methyl group in the calculation. The ground-state geometry of the molecules was first optimized by AM1, and the obtained ground-state geometry was used as the input for DFT optimization. The frontier orbital energy was obtained by ground-state DFT/6-311 G(d) calculation. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, band gaps and torsional angles are summarized in Table 2, and the frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. 6

In 3TTPD3T, the electron densities of HOMO and LUMO are spread out over the whole π-system. And the nodes in the HOMO and LUMO at the imide nitrogen are also observed. That is not the case in 3TTPN3T, when fusing naphthalene is at the imide position of TPD, the symmetry of the structure changes, and the HOMO and LUMO of 3TTPN3T spread over the central TPN acceptor moiety and adjacent thiophene rings, with reduced density on terminal thiophenes. It is also noted that the contribution of the central TPN moiety to the HOMO and LUMO is higher than that of the TPD moiety in 3TTPD3T, indicating that this modification provides an effective pathway to extend the electronic properties. We can also attach different functional groups on the naphthalene to further tune the LUMO and HOMO level in further materials design. In the case of 3TTIN3T, the electron density of LUMO is mainly located on the central TIN acceptor moiety and the adjacent thiophene rings, while the HOMO is predominantly located on the oligothiophene unit. The oligothiophene unit is electron-rich, while the central acceptor TPD/TPN/TIN is electron-deficient. The comparison of the frontier orbital constitution and energy level reveals important electronic properties. As mentioned in our design, fusing naphthalene into TPD can extend the conjugation, thus the 3TTPN3T shows a slightly shallow HOMO compared to a full imide structured TPD analogue. While in 3TTIN3T, the large twisting angle between the oligothiophene backbone and TIN fused ring largely reduces their electronic orbital communication, making less content of acceptor unit hybrided into HOMO, thus its energy level is much less than that of 3TTPN3T.

The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of these oligomers, good solubility and high efficient solar light absorption are suitable for the application of these materials as donors in organic solar cells. The photovoltaic characteristics were investigated with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/oligomer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. Here we chose PC71BM instead of PC61BM as the electron acceptor, which has better absorption in the visible range. OSC devices based on these three oligomers were fabricated and tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. We investigated bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on oligomer:PC71BM blends with different weight ratios of 1:1 and 2:1. Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the photovoltaic properties of the devices are summarized in Table 3. The measured J–V curves show a strong dependence of device performance on the oligomer/PC71BM weight ratios. Increasing the weight ratios of oligomer to PC71BM from 1:1 to 2:1, the 3TTPD3T/PC71BM system shows an increase of PCE from 1.35% to 1.87%, which would benefit from the increase of Jsc and fill factor (FF). In contrast, it is observed that an increase of the weight ratios of oligomer to PC71BM from 1:1 to 2:1 results in a decrease of both Jsc and FF. Consequently, 3TTPN3T/PC71BM and 3TTIN3T/PC71BM systems exhibit a decrease of PCE from 1.24% to 0.77%, and 0.34% to 0.11%, respectively.

With the optimized weight ratio of 3TTPD3T/PC71BM at 2:1, a best but moderate PCE of 1.87% was obtained, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 4.93 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, and an FF of 44%. All the oligomers showed moderate Jsc values between 0.58 and 4.93 mA cm−2. This may probably be due to the morphology of the blend film and crystalline domains that will be discussed below. And all the studied materials also displayed moderate Voc values in the range of 0.69 to 0.87 V. Changing the oligomer/PC71BM blend ratios had a slight impact on the Voc. Voc is correlated with the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. Generally, the lower the HOMO levels of the donor, the higher the Voc. Compared to 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T, 3TTPD3T has the lowest-lying HOMO level and shows the highest Voc value of 0.87 V.

The morphology of the active layer is one of the key factors determining the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the morphology of the oligomers/PC71BM blend films. Fig. 8 shows the AFM height and phase images with different weight ratios of oligomers/PC71BM. These blend films were prepared according to OSC device procedure. The surfaces of all the films are smooth and pinhole free, showing good film-forming quality. For the 3TTPD3T/PC71BM (1:1) system, both blends show a nanoscaled-rouged surface. By increasing the blend ratio, the average root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the blend films decreases slightly from 0.84 to 0.61 nm. The phase images (Fig. 8a2 and a4) show that there two distinctive component on the surfaces, indicating a network structure of the blended film. It is believed that these continuous domains provide percolated pathways for holes and electrons to be efficiently transported through the blend and subsequently collected at the opposite electrodes, thus ensuring the large Jsc. Different from that of 3TTPD3T/PC71BM blend film, AFM images of 3TTPN3T/PC71BM (1:1) blends show rougher morphology. It is found that the roughness of the 3TTPN3T/PC71BM blended thin film changes from 1.48 to 1.06 nm when increasing the blend ratio of 3TTPN3T. From the height image of the 3TTPN3T:PC71BM (2:1) blended thin film its morphology appears to be good, yet its size scale is hundreds of nanometers, thus not optimum for device function. Also in its corresponding phase image, the surface feature changes, dominated with one component. The 3TTIN3T/PC71BM (1:1) blends shows a smooth surface with a RMS of 0.46 nm. Fibrils of submicron size are seen in both height and phase images. As shown in the latter GIWAXS characterizations, those fibrils are 3TTIN3T crystals. Although we observed a large twisting angle inside the 3TTIN3T molecule, its crystallization ability is still strong. Those isolated and buried fibril crystals don't seem to form a percolated network, thus making 3TTIN3T worst in device performances. When the amount of 3TTIN3T in the blends is increased, more fibrils, actually in bundles are seen. This morphology is far from optimum in BHJ OPVs, thus a further decrease is seen in device performance.


To further understand the difference in solar cell performance of these oligomers, two-dimensional GIWAXS was used to investigate their aggregation structure. Thin films were prepared on a silicon/PEDPT:PSS substrate by spin-coating process. A 0.18° incident angle was used in the experiment. As shown in Fig. 9, 3TTPD3T is slightly crystalline without much preferred orientation. In the out-of-plane line-cut profile, a weak peak at 0.25 A−1 is seen, which corresponds to a spacing of 25 Å. This spacing is close to the octyl-terthiophene polymer (100) spacing. A weak π–π stacking peak is seen at 1.63 A−1, corresponding to a spacing of 3.85 Å. 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T show strong diffraction points in the 2-D detector, indicating their high crystalline nature. For both of them, an obvious diffraction peak at 0.21 A−1 is seen, corresponding to a spacing of 30 Å. This enlarged spacing is due to the introduction of a fusing naphthalene unit, which blocks the close hydrophobic interaction of the alkyl side chains. A π–π stacking peak at 1.68 A−1 (corresponding to a spacing of 3.73 Å) is seen for 3TTPN3T, which is slightly smaller than 3TTPD3T, indicating the introduction of a large aromatic ring in the backbone which could promote π–π stacking of the molecule. For 3TTIN3T, its diffraction is more of a single crystalline nature, which corresponds well with the fibril crystal findings of the AFM study.


In summary, we have developed a new method to chemically modify TPD by fusing it with a naphthalene unit through a pyrimidine to afford a new acceptor TPN. And the isomer of TPN, naphthalene monoimide fused with a thiophene monomer TIN was also prepared. The A–D–A-type oligomers with 3,3′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene as terminal donor and TPD/TPN/TIN as central acceptor units were synthesized. The structural modification of TPD exhibits a slight impact on the band gap and HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Compared to 3TTPD3T, the maximum absorption of 3TTPN3T shows a 25 nm red shift. And the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both oligomers are almost the same. Because of the intramolecular steric hindrance, 3TTIN3T shows the highest HOMO energy level and lowest band gap. The central acceptors of these oligomers play a great role in their packing mode in the film state, which has a great impact on their photovoltaic performances. The obtained materials were used as electron donors in BHJ devices with PC71BM as an electron acceptor in a simple ITO/PEDOT:PSS/oligomer:PC71BM/LiF/Al device structure. 3TTPD3T/PC71BM blends with a weight ratio of 2:1 showed the best PCE of 1.87%, with a Jsc of 4.93 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and an FF of 44%. For 3TTPN3T and 3TTIN3T, an increase of the weight ratios of oligomer to PC71BM from 1:1 to 2:1 results in both a decrease of Jsc and FF. It is seen from this comparative study that the right morphology and energy level is quite important to increase the device performance. Too high crystallinity or crystal size is a negative factor in small molecule OSCs.
