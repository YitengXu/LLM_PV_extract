To investigate the influence of side chains of quinoxaline on the photovoltaic performances, a novel D–A-type polymer of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T was synthesized and characterized, in which 5,8-dioctylthienyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T), thiophene (T) and 6,7-dioctyloxy-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (Qx-3) were used as the donor (D) unit, π-bridge and acceptor (A) unit, respectively. The resulting polymer exhibited good thermal stability with a high decomposition temperature of 357 °C, a low optical bandgap of 1.78 eV with an absorption onset of 696 nm, a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.51 eV, and a high carrier mobility of 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the reported analogues, polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM demonstrated the highest open-circuit voltages (Voc) up to 0.96 V. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.9% with a Voc of 0.94 V, short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.28 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 64.7% was obtained with a delicate balance among the above factors for the polymer in PSCs. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that the appending two octyloxy side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline in the BDT-T-alt-DTQx type polymers would be a feasible approach to improve photovoltaic properties.

As a promising sustainable energy source technology for future, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, and ease of processing, which leads to the realization of next-generation renewable energy sources. To improve photovoltaic performance of PSCs, numerous attempts have been made to develop new solution processable donor–acceptor (D–A)-type polymer donor materials with a narrow optical bandgap. More encouragingly, PSCs with high-record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 10.8% were reported. Despite some remarkable advancements of the polymer donor materials being achieved, some challenges still remain in highly efficient PSCs, especially with respect to the high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels that lead to low open-circuit voltages (Voc), narrow absorption spectra that lead to small short-circuit current (Jsc), and low carrier mobility that leads to a weak fill factor (FF). Based on the previous reports, the PCEs of the PSCs are proportional to three parameters interplaying each other (Voc, Jsc and FF). For example, Voc is mainly related to the energy level between the HOMO of the polymer donor materials and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene acceptor materials. However, a lower HOMO level of the polymer donor materials would reduce FF, increase optical bandgap and decrease Jsc. That is, high Voc, Jsc and FF are difficult to obtain concurrently. Obviously, a delicate balance among these three factors of the optical bandgap, energy level and carrier mobility is needed via sophisticated control over the physical properties of a donor material to achieve higher PCEs in PSC.

Recently, 7,8-dithienyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) has been flourishing as an electron donor unit for application in PSCs, due to its relatively large and planar conjugated structure that is favorable for π–π stacking, improvement of carrier transportation and absorption in long wavelengths. So far in the literature, a record PCE of 10.2% was obtained in the BDT-T polymer based device by the Hou group. Meanwhile, another effective way to promote the physical properties of the conjugated polymer is to introduce conjugating components of quinoxaline derivatives with strong quinoid properties, due to their relatively stable and strong electron withdrawing properties that are conducive to promoting the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, which endows them with a broader light absorption and enhanced carrier transportation. A notable PCE up to 8.0% with Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2 was obtained in the quinoxaline-polymer based device by the Chou group. Furthermore, to explore the interactions between the BDT-T and 5,8-dithienylquinoxaline (DTQx) in polymers, there are some exciting reports about the BDT-T-alt-DTQx-based polymers recently. For instance, Hou et al. reported a polymer of PBDTDTQx-T with an alternating D–A backbone of BDT-T-alt-2,3-di(3-alkyloxyphenyl)-DTQx. To further study the effect of various substituted side chains on the photovoltaic properties of these BDT-T-alt-DTQx polymers, our group recently reported two other polymers of PBDTT-TQ with an alternating D–A backbone of BDT-T-alt-6,7-difluoro-2,3-di(3-alkyloxyphenyl)-DTQx and PBDTDT(Qx-2)-T with an alternating D–A backbone of BDTT-alt-6,7-dialkyloxy-2,3-di(4-alkyloxyphenyl)-DTQx, respectively. Recently, some significant influences of various substituted side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline on PCE of these polymer based devices were also observed, while the phenyl has two alkoxy groups. For example, PBDTDTQx-T with two hydrogen atoms at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline was found to show a relatively low Voc of 0.76 V, low Jsc of 10.13 mA cm−2 and high FF of 64.3% which resulted in a poor PCE of 5.0%.PBDTT-TQ with two fluorine atoms at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline was found to display a similarly low Voc of 0.77 V, low FF of 56.0% and high Jsc of 13.70 mA cm−2 resulting in a moderate PCE of 5.9%.PBDTDT(Qx-2)-T with two alkoxy groups at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline was found to indicate a relatively moderate Jsc of 10.82 mA cm−2, moderate FF of 61.4% and high Voc up to 0.95 V, which resulted in a maximum PCE of 6.3%. Obviously, these previous studies using conjugated two-dimensional (2-D) side chains on the BDT-T unit as donors and various substituted side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline as acceptors not only can increase the rigidity of the repeating unit, but also improve the performances of PSCs. However, a delicate balance among all these three factors of Jsc, Voc and FF has still not been achieved in the BDT-T-alt-DTQx type polymer based PSCs.
In this work, a novel D–A-type polymer of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T was synthesized and characterized. As shown in Chart 1, compared to the reported analogic polymers, this polymer was just appended with two octyloxy side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline. As reported in the literature, two 6,7-dioctyloxy side chains at quinoxaline twist the polymer main chain somehow, which can reduce the HOMO energy level and improve the Voc. Meanwhile, removal of the two alkoxy side chains at phenyl not only promotes the electron withdrawing ability of quinoxaline but also reduces intermolecular steric hindrance, which can broaden the absorption spectrum to enhance the Jsc value and improve carrier mobility to increase the FF value of the polymer. We expected that the unsubstituted phenyl and two octyloxy side chains instead of two hydrogen or two fluorine atoms at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline are able to improve the photovoltaic properties along with a delicate balance among these three factors of Jsc, Voc and FF for their polymers in PSCs due to the above alkyl chain modification on quinoxaline combined effect.
The synthetic routes of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T are shown in Scheme 1. As expected, PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T shows a low HOMO energy level of −5.51 eV, narrow optical bandgap of 1.78 eV and high hole mobility of 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PSCs based on the polymer/PC71BM blend presented the highest Voc up to 0.96 V. The highest PCE of 6.9% with a Voc of 0.94 V, Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2 and FF of 64.7% was achieved. Obviously, the device shows a delicate balance among the above factors, under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, the maximum PCE and FF values here are higher than those for the previous BDT-T-alt-DTQx polymeric derivatives in BHJ-PSCs. This work demonstrates that the photovoltaic properties of the BDT-T-alt-DTQx type polymer based PSCs can significantly improve just by grafting two octyloxy side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline.

Monomer 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) and 2,5-bis(trimethytin)-7,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ((BDT-T)Sn2Me6) were purchased directly from the Suna Tech Inc. The other reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Acros, TCI) and used without further purification. Compounds 2, 3, DT(Qx-3) and DT(Qx-3)Br2 were synthesized according to the reported literature. The detailed syntheses of monomers and the polymer are presented following the procedures described herein.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a reference in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K. Mass spectrometric measurements were performed on Bruker Bifiex III MALDI-TOF. The molecular weights were determined using a Waters GPC 2410 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) via a calibration curve of polystyrene as the standard. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted under a dry nitrogen gas flow at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 on a Perkin-Elmer TGA 7. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP-8453 UV visible system. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were carried out on a CHI660A electrochemical work station with a three electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) acetonitrile solution with a scan of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature (RT) under an argon atmosphere. In this three-electrode cell, a platinum rod, a platinum wire and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as a working electrode, a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. The surface morphology of the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM blend film was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Veeco, DI multimode NS-3D apparatus in tapping mode under normal air conditions at RT with a 5 μm scanner.


The PSCs were fabricated using indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as an anode, Ca/Al as a cathode, and a blend film of the polymer/PCBM as a photosensitive layer. After a 30 nm buffer layer of poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the precleaned ITO substrate, the photosensitive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating a solution of the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM (1:4, w/w) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) on the PEDOT:PSS layer with a typical concentration of 35 mg mL−1, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes to remove ODCB. Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were successively deposited on the photosensitive layer in a vacuum and used as top electrodes. The current–voltage (I–V) characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley source measurement system. A solar simulator was used as the light source and the light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. The active area was 1 × 10−2 cm2 for each cell. The thicknesses of the spun-cast films were recorded by a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200, Tencor Instruments). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 150 W xenon lamp.

After quenching with distilled water (50 mL), the mixture was extracted with anhydrous diethyl ether (20 mL × 3). The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered. The filtrate was distilled to remove the solvent and the compound 2 of 2,3-diamino-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-1,4-dibromobenzene was obtained and directly used in the next step.

To a mixture of compound 3 (0.40 g, 0.57 mmol) and 2-thienyltributyltin (0.85 g, 2.28 mmol) in degassed toluene (30 mL) was added tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Pd(PPh3)4, 0.08 g, 0.07 mmol) and then refluxed for 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to RT and quenching with water, the mixture was extracted with DCM (20 mL × 3). The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and distilled to remove the solvent. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using PE-DCM (v/v, 2/1) as an eluent to obtain DT(Qx-3) as a yellow solid (0.35 g, 87.3%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 8.05 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 7.66–7.65 (m, 4H), 7.55 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 2H), 7.33–7.32 (m, 6H), 7.21 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 4.04 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 4H), 1.81–1.76 (m, 4H), 1.40–1.26 (m, 20H), 0.93–0.88 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), (ppm): 152.87, 150.25, 138.91, 136.41, 133.47, 130.91, 130.33, 128.69, 128.17, 127.89, 126.09, 124.18, 74.10, 31.89, 30.43, 29.52, 29.34, 26.09, 22.71, 14.20.

In a dry 25 mL flask, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3, 5.0 mg) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-Tol)3, 10.0 mg) were added to a solution of DT(Qx-3)Br2 (112 mg, 0.13 mmol) and (BDT-T)Sn2Me6 (100 mg, 0.13 mmol) in 6 mL degassed toluene under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred vigorously at 100 °C for 16 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was poured into acetone (100 mL) and the precipitation occurred. It was collected by filtration and successively extracted in Soxhlet apparatus with diethyl ether and chloroform (CHCl3), respectively.

As shown in Scheme 1, compound 2 was prepared through a ring-opening reaction and used immediately to obtain compound 3via the condensation reaction with a yield of 72.1%. Compound 3 was then reacted with 2-thienyltributyltin via the Stille coupling reaction to afford DT(Qx-3) in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 with a moderate yield of 87.3%. DT(Qx-3) was brominated with NBS in THF to afford the monomer DT(Qx-3)Br2 with a high yield of 90.1%. The polymer of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization between DT(Qx-3)Br2 and (BDT-T)Sn2Me6 with a yield of 81.3%. The chemical structures of compounds 3, DT(Qx-3) and DT(Qx-3)Br2 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (see the ESI). The molecular weight of the polymer was determined with GPC relative to polystyrene standards. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of 59 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.64 was observed for PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T, and the related data are listed in Table 1. Due to the influence of the appending two octyloxy side chains on quinoxaline, PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T exhibits excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as CHCl3, THF, chlorobenzene (CB) and ODCB.

The thermal properties of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T were investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 1, PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T shows excellent thermal stability, with 5% weight-loss at a temperature (Td) of 357 °C under an inert atmosphere, and its corresponding data are summarized in Table 1.

The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T in dilute CHCl3 solution with a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M and a thin film are shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. Two typical absorption bands are observed in the range of 340–700 nm for the polymer. The high-lying absorption band from 340 to 450 nm is assigned to the π–π* transition, and another low-lying absorption band from 500 to 700 nm should be attributed to the strong ICT interaction between the donor and acceptor units. The absorption of the polymer in the thin film has about 51 nm red-shifted in comparison with the absorption spectra in solution, indicating that the strong aggregation is formed in the thin film. The absorption edge (λonset) of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T is located at 696 nm in its thin film, corresponding to the optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.78 eV. Compared to the previous PBDTDTQx-T and PBDTT-TQ (1.67 and 1.77 eV), appending two octyloxy side chains to replace hydrogen or fluorine atoms at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline, can weaken the ICT effect to lead a higher Eoptg value and a higher Voc value in PSCs. A similar phenomenon has also been reported in other studies. Furthermore, compared to the previous PBDTDT(Qx-2)-T (1.82 eV), two methoxy side chains were eliminated at 4,4′-positions of phenyl in PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T, which can enhance the ICT effect to obtain a lower Eoptg value and a higher Jsc value.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T by using the Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference and redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the calibrated standard. Fig. 3 shows the recorded CV curve of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T, and the relevant CV data are listed in Table 2. The observed onset oxidation and reduction potentials (Eox/Ered) for PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T are 1.16 V/−0.78 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T can be calculated according to the empirical equations:EHOMO = −(Eox − 0.45) − 4.8 eV, ELUMO = −(Ered − 0.45) − 4.8 eV and Eecg = −(Eox − Ered) eV. As a result, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO/ELUMO) are estimated to be −5.51/−3.57 eV for PBDTDT-(Qx-3)-T, respectively. Obviously, PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T presents a lower EHOMO value than that of the previous analogues with two alkyloxy groups at phenyl and two fluorine (or hydrogen or octyloxy) at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline, Also, increasing two octyloxy side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline can twist the polymer main chain somehow and decreasing two methyloxy side chains at phenyl can enhance the electron withdrawing ability of quinoxaline causing a lower HOMO level. The relatively deep HOMO energy levels (5.51 eV) could be expected to afford higher Voc in PSC applications, which is one of the main contributors to achieve high efficiency PSCs. This discrepancy between the electrochemical and optical bandgaps might be induced by the presence of an energy barrier at the interface between the polymer neat film and the electrode surface.


Besides the absorption and energy levels, the charge carrier transport abilities of polymers have also an important effect on the resulting photovoltaic performance of PSCs, especially on FF. We measured the hole-only mobilities (μh) of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T blended with PC71BM at an optimized blend ratio (w:w, 1:4) under different conditions by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au. The SCLC could be estimated using the Mott–Gurney equation: J = (9/8)ε0εrμh(V/L3), where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of polymer, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), L is the thickness of the blended film layer (105 nm), V = Vappl − Vbi, V is the effective voltage, Vappl is the applied voltage, and Vbi is the built-in voltage that results from the work function difference between the anode and the cathode. As shown in Fig. 4, the hole-only mobilities of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T are calculated to be 1.01 × 10−4, 1.53 × 10−4 and 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the hole-only polymer/PC71BM-based devices, under without annealing, annealing temperature of 80 °C, and annealing temperature of 80 °C with 1% DIO additive conditions, respectively. Compared to the previous BDT-T-alt-DTQx polymers,PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T shows a best hole mobility under annealing temperature of 80 °C with 1% DIO additive conditions, which implies that a relatively high FF could be obtained in the PSCs.


To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymer, the BHJ-PSCs were also fabricated with a typical device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The active layer of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM with a thickness of 105 nm was obtained from an ODCB solution at a concentration of 35 mg mL−1. The photovoltaic performances of PSCs are strongly affected by the processing parameters, and these processing parameters were investigated to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T. To obtain the optimal D/A (PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM, w/w) ratios, annealing temperature, DIO additive concentration and spin-coating rates on the photovoltaic properties, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM based devices at different ratios, annealing temperatures, DIO additives and spin-coating rates are shown in Fig. S1–S4, respectively. The resulting photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1–S4, respectively. An optimized PBDTDT-(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM ratio of 1:4, annealing temperature of 80 °C, DIO additive concentration of 1% and spin-coating rate of 2250 rpm were obtained successfully in the BHJ-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 5, three typical devices exhibited the typical J–V characteristics under different conditions, and the device parameters, such as Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are summarized in Table 3. More encouragingly, all of the three typical devices exhibit excellent photovoltaic properties.

Without any post fabrication treatment, the device performances exhibited moderate PCE of 5.8%. When we used the annealed active layer, the device performances were moderately improved, which can be attributed to the increased Jsc value and well-controlled nanoscale morphology of the BHJ active layer films leading to an improved efficient photo-response (see Fig. 6 and 7). The corresponding PCE was increased to 6.2% with a comparable Voc value of 0.96 V and a Jsc of 11.10 mA cm−2. When further treated with 1% DIO additive, the device performances were greatly enhanced and exhibited a high PCE of 6.9%, which can be attributed to the increased FF value of 64.7% and the same well-optimized nanoscale morphology of the BHJ active layer films leading to an enhanced hole mobility. As result, the maximum PCE of up to 6.9% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.7% was obtained in the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM-based device. To our knowledge, the recorded maximum PCE and FF values here are higher than those of the previous BDT-T-alt-DTQx based on copolymeric derivatives in BHJ-PSCs, due to the side chain modified engineering and the device optimization.
To understand why the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM based devices displayed high PCE values, external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of devices under different conditions were also measured. As depicted in Fig. 6, the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM based three devices show very efficient photo-response in a broad range from 310 to 730 nm, corresponding to high EQE over 40% in a broad range from 340 to 630 nm is observed for all three devices. The maximum EQE of 73% at 420 nm for the device without annealing, 76% at 422 nm for the device with annealing temperature of 80 °C, and 80% at 431 nm for the device with annealing temperature of 80 °C and 1% DIO additive, was observed respectively. These differences can be attributed to changes of the surface morphologies. Obviously, a high EQE value is responsible for high Jsc of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T based PSCs. According to the EQE curves and the solar irradiation spectrum, the integral Jsc values of the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T based PSCs are 10.45, 10.96 and 11.30 mA cm−2, respectively, which are coincident with the measured Jsc values within a 2% error.

To better understand the photovoltaic performances of the resulting polymer, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements are carried out to demonstrate the surface morphologies of the blend films of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM (1:4, w/w) processed in unannealed, annealed and annealed with a DIO additive, and the height images (5 × 5 μm2) are shown in Fig. 6. The root mean square (RMS) roughness is observed to be 1.45 nm in unannealed conditions, and the other blend films after annealing and adding a DIO additive exhibit a smooth surface and the RMS are 0.83 and 0.45 nm, respectively. In general, good surface morphology is available to enhance photovoltaic performance. The results agreed well with the improvement of Jsc from 10.50 to 11.28 mA cm−2 for the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T based PSCs. Thus, the well-ordered nanoscale morphology of PBDTDT(Qx-3)T/PC71BM should also result in high charge carrier mobility, which gives rise to a FF of 64.7%, and a better device performance with a PCE up to 6.9%. Therefore, the relatively excellent morphology together with the high hole mobility mentioned above, results in a high Jsc and FF.


A novel D–A-type polymer of PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T was obtained with a BDT-T-alt-DTQx building block to investigate the influence of side chains of quinoxaline on the photovoltaic performances. The polymer exhibited a high decomposition temperature of 357 °C, broad absorption in the range of 300–696 nm, a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.51 eV, and a high carrier mobility of 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Based on the PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T/PC71BM blend, the device exhibited an outstandingly increased Voc value of 0.96 V and a maximum PCE value of 6.9% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.7%. The maximum PCE and FF values here are the highest levels reported in the BDT-T-alt-DTQx copolymeric derivatives based PSCs. Our work demonstrates that the photovoltaic properties of the BDT-T-alt-DTQx based polymers in PSCs can be remarkably increased by the side chain modified engineering, with just appending two octyloxy side chains at 6,7-positions of quinoxaline.
