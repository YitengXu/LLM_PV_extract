Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have attracted immense interest owing to their ability for facile structural modification and good thermal and optical characteristics. Among these acceptors, isomerized building blocks originating from multiple reaction sites affect the electronic structures, morphological properties and resulting photovoltaic performance, but have rarely been studied. Herein, three isomeric FREAs, Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb, were synthesized using different reaction sites of benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (BTBT)-based fused-ring cores and were used in organic solar cells (OSCs). As compared to Z1-aa and Z1-ab, Z1-bb exhibited red-shifted absorption and a higher maximum molar extinction coefficient. When blended with PM6, Z1-bb-based OSCs exhibited more balanced charge transport compared to those with the PM6:Z1-aa and PM6:Z1-ab blend films, which favored higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). As a result, the OSC devices based on Z1-bb exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.66% with Voc = 0.98 V, Jsc = 18.52 mA cm−2, and FF = 70.05%, respectively, which are significantly higher than the values recorded for the Z1-ab-based (PCE of 9.60%) and Z1-aa-based (PCE of 4.56%) devices. These results indicate that the isomerization of a fused-ring core originating from a special reaction site could be a promising approach to achieve high-performance OSCs with high Jsc, Voc, and FF.

Owing to their immense potential for easy modification of molecular structures, as well as highly tunable absorption spectra and energy levels, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) featuring an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular configuration have injected a new vitality into the field of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). They have now been greatly improved with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16%. Generally, FREAs consist of three building blocks: a bulky fused-ring core, strong electron-deficient terminals, and outstretched side chains. Modifications in all three parts of FREAs have been proven to be effective for modulating absorption spectra, electronic energy levels, and active layer morphologies.

Therefore, such modifications would aid in improving the key photovoltaic parameters, such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), thereby ultimately contributing to the improvement of PCEs. For instance, recently, a type of FREA with an electron-deficient fused-ring core blended with wide-bandgap polymer donors, such as PBDB-TF, Pt10, and PM6, was reported to deliver remarkable PCEs of over 16%, along with impressive Jsc values that exceeded 25 mA cm−2 and FFs over 74%. The high Jsc values in OSCs based on this kind of FREA mainly arise from the diverse and strong photo-harvesting characteristics. However, a relatively low Voc of <0.9 V has been obtained due to the lower-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (∼−4.0 eV). With regard to tailoring of electronic energy levels, Zhou et al. used the so-called “same-acceptor strategy” (SAS) to develop well-matched polymer donor and FREA materials containing the same building unit, i.e., benzotriazole (BTA). OSCs based on this polymer donor and FREA acceptor pair achieved a PCE of 10.5%, which was mainly due to a rather high Voc of 1.24 V, which was accompanied by a relatively low Jsc of 13.16 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.6%. The high Voc could be attributed to the lower ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO between the polymer donor and fused-ring electron acceptors. As for the active layer morphologies, Yang and co-authors provided a new strategy to balance the crystallinity of acceptors and miscibility of the BHJ via introduction of a phenyl group at the tail of alkyl side chains of FREAs. As a result, a distinct improvement in BHJ morphologies was observed. Ultimately, OSCs based on FREAs with a phenyl terminal group delivered a high PCE of up to 14% with a remarkably high FF of 78.32% and a Voc of 0.94 V. To better understand these cases, we have listed efficient OSCs based on FREAs with high Jsc and/or Voc and/or high FF values (Table S1 in the ESI). From these examples, one can deduce that the high performance of OSCs based on FREAs could typically be attributed to one or two outstanding photovoltaic parameters, and that simultaneously high Jsc (>18.5 mA cm−2), Voc (>0.95 V), and FF (>70%) values are rarely achieved. Therefore, a rational design of FREAs to finely modulate the absorption properties, electronic energy levels, and blend morphologies to induce simultaneous improvements of all key photovoltaic parameters would be very challenging.
Apart from modifications in the three aforementioned parts of FREAs, it is worth mentioning that isomerization of the three parts, i.e., fused-ring cores, electron-deficient terminals, and side chains, has also been demonstrated to be a useful approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs. Isomeric terminals can affect the intermolecular aggregation of FREAs as well as the active layer morphologies. Yang's group reported three FREAs with different isomeric thiophene-fused terminals, where CPTCN-Br2 fused with the 3,4-position of thiophene showed a red-shifted absorption by ∼60 nm as compared to CPTCN-Br and CPTCN-Br1 fused with the 2,3-position of thiophene. Its blend film exhibited stronger face-on molecular orientation, more distinct phase separation, and more balanced charge transport than the latter two, which resulted in higher Jsc, FF and PCE values in the PM6:CPTCN-Br2 OSC device. Additionally, isomerized side chains have a strong impact on the photovoltaic performance of FREAs because they influence the aggregation state of the BHJ active layer. Typically, m-ITIC with meta-alkyl phenyl substitution has shown higher crystallinity, higher film absorption coefficients, and a more balanced charge transport than the corresponding ITIC with para-alkyl phenyl substitution, which led to better photovoltaic performance of the OSC with m-ITIC. Moreover, the energy levels and aggregation of FREAs are significantly influenced by the isomeric fused-ring core. It has been reported that FNIC2 (ref. 33) with a polycyclic electron-donating core of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene exhibited a red-shift of 42 nm in absorption and higher electron mobility as compared to the FNIC1 with a core of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (BDTT) fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthiophene. Thus, the PTB7-Th:FNIC2 device displayed a higher PCE of 13.0% as compared to that of the PTB7-Th:FNIC1 device (10.3%). As another typical example, an electron-donating core of naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthiophene (NTIC) showed better photovoltaic performance than benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthiophene (BTIC) because of the ∼30 nm red-shifted absorption of NITC. In previous reports, the focus has been on the isomeric fused-ring cores of FREAs that are designed to have several different aromatic rings with different sequential arrangements. However, little attention has been paid to studying the effects of fused-ring core isomerization originating from different linkages in the same sequentially fused-ring cores on the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
In this work, three isomeric FREAs with an octacyclic electron-donating core (D) of benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (BTBT) fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthiophene and electron-deficient 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone (2FIC) as terminals (A) were designed and synthesized, where the cyclopentadienyl moiety was fused at the 2,3-7,8 (Z1-aa), 2,3-6,7 (Z1-ab), and 1,2-6,7 (Z1-bb) positions of the benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (BTBT)-based fused-ring cores (Fig. 1). The three isomeric FREAs not only have the same sequentially fused-ring cores but also have the same outstretched side chains (4-hexyl phenyl), as well as the same electron-deficient terminals (2FIC). The only difference in the chemical structure of these FREAs is the octacyclic isomeric core originating from the different cyclization patterns. Owing to the largely conjugated rigid plane structure, BTBT-based small organic molecules are widely used in OFETs and have achieved high electron mobility, which may be helpful in obtaining high Jsc and FF in OSCs, depending on FREAs incorporating the BTBT unit. At the same time, we have observed that BTBT-based small molecules have rather deeper HOMO energy levels (∼−5.6 eV) and high-lying LUMO energy levels (∼−3.8 eV), which is key to designing high Voc photovoltaic materials. These features enabled us to obtain BTBT-based FREAs with high Jsc, Voc, and FF. As compared to Z1-aa and Z1-ab, Z1-bb exhibits a red-shifted and broader absorption spectrum, as well as a higher molar extinction coefficient. Meanwhile, the PM6:Z1-bb blend film delivered dominant face-on stacking, more favorable blend morphology, and better charge transport than PM6:Z1-aa and PM6:Z1-ab blend films. As a result, the OSC device based on PM6:Z1-bb achieved the highest PCE of 12.66%, along with a high Jsc of 18.52 mA cm−2, an outstanding Voc of up to 0.98 V, and a high FF of over 70%. Furthermore, this champion PCE was significantly higher than that of the corresponding PM6:Z1-ab-based (9.60%) and PM6:Z1-aa-based (4.56%) devices. This study reports a promising approach to simultaneously achieve high Jsc, Voc, and FF values for FREA-based OSCs via polycyclic core isomerization originating from the different linkage patterns of the same sequentially fused-ring cores.

The synthetic route to FREAs Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb is shown in Scheme S1, and the detailed synthesis procedures are provided in the ESI. Compound 1 was prepared according to a previously described method; it was then converted into a bis(pinacolato)diboron compound (2). Next, compound 3 was obtained through a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction between compound 2 and 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and toluene as a solvent. Subsequently, compound 3 was subjected to nucleophilic attack by excess (4-hexylphenyl)lithium to obtain the key tertiary alcohol, i.e., compound 4, which was directly used in the next step without further purification. The fused-ring isomeric mixtures containing BT-aa, BT-ab, and BT-bb were synthesized by a subsequent ring-closure reaction using Amberlyst 15 as a catalyst at 90 °C via attack on different active positions of compound 4 (Fig. 1 and Scheme S1). Because of the difficulty in separating fused-ring isomers, this mixture and the following dialdehyde compounds (BT-aa-CHO, BT-ab-CHO, and BT-bb-CHO) were only subjected to primary purification, and then used for further experiments. Lastly, three isomeric BTBT-based FREAs, Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb, were obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the dialdehyde mixture and electron-deficient terminals of 2FIC in the presence of pyridine. Notably, the three isomeric FREAs were difficult to separate by conventional column chromatography. After numerous attempts, we found that Z1-bb is not readily soluble in ethyl acetate; therefore, we utilized their different solubilities to successfully separate them. We first used silica-gel column chromatography with a mixed solvent as the eluent (petroleum ether/dichloromethane, v/v = 3/2) to separate Z1-aa as a black gold solid (80 mg, yield 26%), followed by the mixture of Z1-ab and Z1-bb. Z1-ab was then further purified by recrystallization from ethyl acetate to yield Z1-bb as a black gold solid (40 mg, yield 13%). Finally, we obtained Z1-ab as a purple solid (50 mg, yield 16%) by silica-gel column chromatography using a mixed solvent as the eluent (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, v/v = 1/1).

The chemical structures of these isomeric FREAs Z1-aa, Z1-bb, and Z1-ab were fully characterized and confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). In consideration of the only difference in the molecular structures of the three isomers, we paid special attention to their 1H NMR spectra in the chemical shift range between 7.6 and 8.2 ppm, which is attributed to aromatic H signals in the BTBT unit. As shown in Fig. 2, for Z1-aa, two distinct singlet peaks were located in the range of 7.6–7.9 ppm that could be assigned to aromatic H signals corresponding to positions “a1” and “b1” of the BTBT unit, while the aromatic protons of the BTBT unit (a3 and b3) showed two doublet peaks in the Z1-bb molecule. For Z1-ab, it was observed that the aromatic protons of the BTBT unit exhibited complex NMR signals due to the structural combination of Z1-aa and Z1-bb, where both singlet peaks (c2 and d2) and doublet peaks (a2 and b2) were present. These results indicated that the three isomeric FREAs were well-separated and pure isomers had been obtained. Z1-aa, Z1-bb, and Z1-ab are readily soluble in several common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves (Fig. S10) show that Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb delivered melting peak temperatures of 347, 311 and 312 °C in nitrogen, which means that all possess favourable crystallinity. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves (Fig. S11) show that Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb have decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 369, 365 and 392 °C in nitrogen, respectively, indicating good thermal stability.

The optimized molecular geometry and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb with simplified side chains were calculated with the help of density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP 6-31G* level using the Gaussian 09 package. Considering that most publications have reported that the oxygen of the “IC” acceptor and sulfur of the last thiophene are closest, we also took this configuration (see Scheme S1). As shown in Fig. 3, all three FREAs exhibited good planarity because dihedral angles between the central “D” unit and the end group “A” units are nearly 0°. As compared to the other two FREAs, Z1-bb presented smaller dihedral angles (0.07° and −0.04°) between the “D” and “A” units, indicating that Z1-bb had the best molecular planarity. The high coplanarity in the molecular backbone would favor more efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and higher charge mobility. Meanwhile, the DFT calculation revealed that the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb were −5.67/−3.44, −5.65/−3.42, and −5.62/−3.40 eV, respectively. The high-lying LUMO energy levels are well-matched with the deeper HOMO energy-level polymer donors, such as PM6, which is required to obtain a high Voc in the OSCs.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb in chloroform and film together with that of the PM6 film are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The corresponding absorption data are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb in the chloroform solution exhibited very different absorption profiles in the range from 500 nm to 750 nm with maximum absorption peaks at 634, 567, and 654 nm, respectively. From solution to film, the peak significantly red-shifted for all three isomers, reflecting the strong aggregation in their corresponding neat films. The peak for Z1-ab exhibited a red-shift of approximately 42 nm as compared to that for Z1-aa, while the peak for Z1-bb exhibited a red-shift of 48 nm relative to that of Z1-ab. More importantly, the maximum molar extinction coefficients were greatly different: 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for Z1-aa, 8 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for Z1-ab, and 2.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for Z1-bb, respectively. Z1-bb showed a ∼2 times higher value than those of Z1-aa and Z1-ab. Although we do not understand clearly the origin of this difference at present, the isomeric fused core seems to influence the transition dipole and oscillation strength. In addition, the Z1-aa and Z1-ab films showed a significant spectral overlap with the absorption of the polymer donor PM6 in film; however, Z1-bb exhibited a more complementary spectrum to the PM6 film (Fig. 4b). These results imply that the OSC prepared from PM6:Z1-bb would deliver a higher Jsc than the OSCs prepared from Z1-aa and Z1-ab. The electrochemical properties of Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb were investigated by conducting cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell under continuous argon flow at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 4c, the LUMO energy levels of Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb were determined to be −3.84, −3.87, and −3.92 eV, respectively, from the onset reduction potentials. The HOMO energy levels of Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb were calculated to be −5.67, −5.69, and −5.70 eV, respectively, from the onset oxidation potentials. For all three FREAs, both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels were lower than those of the polymer donor, PM6 (−3.50 and −5.56 eV) (Fig. 4d), indicating the large enough energy offsets for efficient hole and electron transfers between the donor and acceptor.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to investigate the effect of the isomeric structures on the molecular packing properties. Fig. 4e–h and S12 show the two-dimensional GIWAXS images of PM6, Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb neat films. It is observable that the crystallinity and molecular aggregation of the FREAs were significantly influenced by the position of the cyclization reaction. In the neat film of the three isomers, Z1-bb showed a distinct (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.70 Å−1 (d-spacing, 3.79 Å) along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction together with a (100) peak at qxy = 0.27 Å−1 (d-spacing, 23.27 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction, indicating that Z1-bb possesses strong cofacial intermolecular packing in a predominant face-on fashion, while there was no clear (010) signal for Z1-aa and Z1-ab films. Moreover, we calculated the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) based on the Scherrer equation. Z1-bb exhibits the largest CCL of 2.7 nm compared to those of Z1-aa (1.0 nm) and Z1-ab (0.84 nm) based on the (010) diffraction peak, suggesting tighter intermolecular packing and higher crystallinity in Z1-bb films. In addition, PM6 shows a (100) lamellar peak in both OOP (qz = 0.29 Å−1) and IP (qxy = 0.28 Å−1) directions and a (010) π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.68 Å−1, showing a bimodal orientation.


Photovoltaic devices combining the FREAs as the acceptors and PM6 as the donor were fabricated with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Preliminary device optimization (shown in Table S2) was carried out by optimizing the donor/acceptor weight ratios, as well as by optimizing the processing additive (DIO). When the donor:acceptor weight ratio was 1:1 and the amount of additive DIO was 5% by volume, the OSCs based on Z1-bb delivered the highest PCE of 12.66% with a rather high Voc of 0.98 V, an attractive FF of 70.05%, and an outstanding Jsc of 18.52 mA cm−2. Under the same fabrication conditions, OSCs based on both Z1-aa and Z1-ab demonstrated inferior PCEs of 4.56% and 9.60%, respectively, mainly due to the lower Jsc (11.68 and 14.76 mA cm−2) and FF (40 and 60.89%). However, comparably high Voc values of 0.98 and 1.0 V were obtained for the Z1-aa- and Z1-ab-based OSCs, respectively, which should be attributed to the sufficiently large difference between the HOMO of the polymer donor, PM6, and the LUMOs of these BTBT-based FREAs. As shown in Table S1, previous reports have revealed that the high Voc (>0.95 V) based on A–D–A type FREAs is usually accompanied by a relatively low Jsc (<18 mA cm−2) and/or FF (<70%). Interestingly, for the Z1-bb-based OSCs, high Jsc (>18 mA cm−2), Voc (>0.95 V), and FF (>70%) were achieved simultaneously. This has rarely been observed in previous reports.

The high FF could be attributed to the favorable “face-on” orientation and superior active layer morphology, which is beneficial for charge generation, exciton dissociation, and charge transport. This will be discussed in the subsequent sections. For a high Jsc, the more complementary absorption spectra (Fig. 4b) between Z1-bb and the polymer donor PM6 are beneficial. The Jsc values were also verified by integrating the photocurrent (Jcalc) values from the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves (Fig. 5b) for the OSCs based on Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb. As listed in Table 2, these Jcalc values agreed well with the measured Jsc within a mismatch of 5%. In addition, as we had expected, we obtained a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) because the relatively lower ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO between the PM6 and these isomeric FREAs provided a high Voc. However, to our surprise, the actual Voc value of Z1-aa (0.98 V) is lower than that of Z1-ab (1.00 V), which is not in good agreement with the expected Voc value from the LUMO energy levels. Recent work indicates that Voc is not only dependent on the energy levels (LUMO/HOMO) between the donor and acceptor, but also on non-ideal charge recombination, interchain distance and active layer morphology. Intensifying the intermolecular interaction or electronic coupling between the acceptor and donor molecules may increase the reverse saturation current density in the dark and hence lower the Voc.

The blend film morphology is a key factor in determining the photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs. The film morphologies of the PM6:FREA blend films were first characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, the PM6:Z1-bb blend film exhibited a slightly larger root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.86 nm than PM6:Z1-aa (2.20 nm) and PM6:Z1-ab (2.30 nm), which may have originated from the stronger tendency of crystallization of Z1-bb. In addition, the more distinct microphase separation in PM6:Z1-bb (Fig. 6f) implies that the blend film PM6:Z1-bb is favorable for exciton dissociation.

To investigate the intermolecular packing as well as the orientation in the blends, we measured the GIWAXS of all blend films. As shown in Fig. 7a–d, the PM6:Z1-aa blend film showed a weak (010) diffraction peak at 1.71 Å−1 (d-spacing, 3.67 Å) with a CCL of 2.5 nm in the out-of-plane direction, which must have originated from the π–π stacking of PM6 as the pristine Z1-aa film did not show any (010) diffraction peak. The PM6:Z1-ab blend film exhibited an enhanced (010) diffraction peak at 1.70 Å−1 (d-spacing, 3.67 Å) with a CCL of 3.3 nm in the out-of-plane direction and a weak (010) diffraction peak at 1.70 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, which indicated that the PM6:Z1-ab blend film formed the preferential “face-on” orientation and partial edge-on orientation derived from the π–π stacking of PM6 and Z1-ab. The PM6:Z1-bb blend film also delivers two diffraction peaks at qz = 1.70 Å−1 (d-spacing, 3.70 Å) with a CCL of 2.7 nm in the OOP direction, but there is a negligible (010) diffraction in the IP direction, suggesting that PM6:Z1-bb possesses the most pronounced face-on orientation among the three blends. These morphological data clearly support the superior photovoltaic characteristics of PM6:Z1-bb compared to the other two devices.

The hole and electron mobilities of the PM6:Z1-aa, PM6:Z1-bb, and PM6:Z1-ab blend films were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Two configurations of ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al were used as electron-only and hole-only devices, respectively. As shown in Fig. S13 and Table 3, the hole/electron mobilities of the blend films of PM6:Z1-aa, PM6:Z1-ab, and PM6:Z1-bb were determined to be 1.1 × 10−4/5.5 × 10−6, 3.9 × 10−4/1.9 ×10−5, and 5.6 × 10−4/3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; hence, their hole-to-electron mobility ratios (μh/μe) were 20.0, 20.5, and 1.9, respectively. It was noted that the electron mobility of the PM6:Z1-bb blend film was higher by 1–2 orders of magnitude than those of the PM6:Z1-ab and PM6:Z1-aa blend films. This is well consistent with the most pronounced face-on ordering in the PM6:Z1-bb blend. The largely improved electron mobility and more balanced hole and electron mobilities of the PM6:Z1-bb blend film agreed well with the highest Jsc, FF, and PCE.

To characterize the charge recombination dynamics of the Z1-aa, Z1-bb, and Z1-ab BHJ devices, we studied the light intensity-dependent J–V characteristics. First, the Jsc dependencies on the light intensity (Ilight) are shown in Fig. 7e. Their relationship can be described as Jsc ∝ (Ilight)α. The closer α is to 1, the lower the degree of bimolecular recombination; on the other hand, the farther α is from 1, the higher the degree of bimolecular recombination. The α values of the Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb BHJ devices were 0.706, 0.845, and 0.895, respectively. These results demonstrate that Z1-bb underwent a relatively weak bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. The Voc dependence on the light intensity is shown in Fig. 7f, and is described by the relationship Voc ∝ (nkbT/q)Ilight, where n values close to 2 indicate that monomolecular recombination dominates at Voc. The n values of the Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb BHJ devices were determined to be 1.43, 1.34, and 1.23, respectively, implying that the monomolecular recombination in PM6:Z1-bb is smallest under open-circuit conditions. The charge recombination characteristics are well consistent with the measured SCLC charge mobilities.


We synthesized three isomeric fused-ring electron acceptors, Z1-aa, Z1-ab, and Z1-bb. Compared to Z1-aa and Z1-ab, Z1-bb exhibited red-shifted absorption, a more complementary spectrum to PM6, and a higher molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore, the PM6:Z1-bb blend film delivered a more favorable phase morphology and better electron–hole mobilities compared to PM6:Z1-aa and PM6:Z1-ab. In addition, the GIWAXS measurement of Z1-bb showed more orderly π–π stacking and a dominant face-on orientation, which is beneficial for charge separation and electron transport in a vertical direction. Thus, BHJ devices based on Z1-bb and PM6 showed a superior PCE of 12.66%, with a high Voc of 0.98 V, Jsc of 17.14 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.05%; these values were significantly higher than those for the PM6:Z1-ab-based (9.60%) and PM6:Z1-aa-based (4.56%) devices. Our results demonstrate that choosing an appropriate molecular configuration at the central fused ring core originating from multiple reaction sites in FREAs is a promising way to achieve high-performance OSCs with high Voc, Jsc, and FF.
