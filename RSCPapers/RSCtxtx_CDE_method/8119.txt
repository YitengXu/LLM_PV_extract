Solution processability is one of the advantages of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, most high-efficiency OSCs are prepared using hazardous chlorinated solvents for the deposition of photoactive layers. The replacement of non-halogenated solvents with eco-friendly green solvents for photoactive materials is urgently required. Herein, we have developed a novel asymmetric T2-OEHRH, which is modified from the symmetric T2-ORH. The introduction of asymmetric alkyl side chains onto rhodanine end groups can effectively suppress excessive self-aggregation/crystallization and substantially improve solubility without sacrificing optoelectrical properties. Therefore, ternary-blend OSCs based on PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH processed using a non-halogenated solvent system exhibit a uniform and favorable morphology and give a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.10%. More importantly, we demonstrate an impressive PCE of 9.32% for large-area NFA-OSCs (substrate size = 100 cm2 and aperture size = 55.5 cm2) prepared via D-bar coating in air. To our knowledge, this PCE is the highest reported to date for NFA-based large-area OSC modules processed from a non-halogenated solvent. This asymmetric alkyl-chain engineering strategy can be exploited to develop high-performance large-area NFA-OSCs with eco-friendly solvent processing.

Compared with their inorganic counterparts, organic solar cells (OSCs) enable the production of solar electricity in a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner. Thus, OSCs based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure have seen steady performance gains with single/tandem, small-area, and large-area devices and provide a power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 14%. Despite such success, further development of eco-friendly device fabrication approaches with high efficiency is needed to realize the full potential of OSC technology. The development of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based organic semiconductors has recently led to important breakthroughs in the field of OSCs. Because of intensive research efforts regarding chemical tailoring of NFAs (especially acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type fused-ring-based NFAs), NFA-OSCs are now outperforming conventional fullerene-based OSCs and have strong potential as a renewable and low-cost energy technology that enables the fabrication of lightweight, semitransparent, colorful, and flexible devices. However, NFA-OSCs still face formidable challenges for future commercialization: highly polluting processing solvents used in the device fabrication process are not eco-friendly, and they are not yet compatible with industrial-scale processes for the manufacturing of highly efficient large-area OSCs, which requires the combination of an appropriate material system with efficient module design methods.

The solvents widely used thus far in NFA-OSC fabrication are chlorinated solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene because of their strong ability to dissolve NFAs and form favorable BHJ morphologies. However, the use of these solvents is restricted in industrial production because they are highly detrimental to the environment and human health. Thus, substantial efforts are needed to develop a high-performance NFA-OSC that can be processed from green solvents. State-of-the-art NFA-OSCs processed from non-halogenated solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and toluene have achieved PCEs greater than 12%, already representing a substantial advancement. Most NFA-OSCs processed with eco-friendly solvents have involved indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT)-based acceptors such as 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene) (ITIC) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(5&6-methyl-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene) (IT-M), which showed good solubility, high crystallinity, favorable charge transport characteristics, and strong optical absorption in the wavelength range 600–800 nm. However, halogen-free solvents have limited ability to dissolve most of the other high-performing NFA-based photoactive materials. Therefore, to develop a high-efficiency NFA-OSC technology enabling real-life applications, a new materials concept for eco-friendly OSC fabrication is needed. From the aspect of materials design, the solubility of the photoactive materials could be tuned by introducing functional groups or controlling side-chain length to induce different solvation effects.
For the ultimate industrial application, the large-area manufacturing of OSCs on an industrial scale is also considered a critical issue. In general, device performance is inevitably diminished when small-area OSCs are transferred to large-area OSC modules because of several complex issues, including the morphology of photoactive films, the coating method, and the resistance of the air-stability processing and scalable modules. To achieve highly efficient large-area OSCs, the appropriate material design, along with an efficient module design, is critical. Although numerous NFA-based small-area devices (<1 cm2) with high efficiencies when processed from non-halogenated solvents (>11%) as well as from chlorinated solvents (>14%) have been reported, fullerene acceptors are still mainly used for the fabrication of large-area (>1 cm2) OSC modules (Tables S4, S5, Fig. S22 and S23, ESI); the resulting devices exhibit efficiencies up to 7% when processed from chlorinated (with an active area of up to 200 cm2) or non-halogenated solvents (with an active area of up to 20 cm2). Recently, large-area (>1 cm2) NFA-OSC modules have been reported using PBTIBDTT:ITIC-F (8.6%, 3.48 cm2) and PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-ORH (10.08%, 13.5 cm2) processed from chlorinated solvents. Green-solvent-processable large-area (>1 cm2) NFA-OSC modules have rarely been studied. One recent example of a large-area NFA-based OSC module was fabricated using P3HT and IDTBR as donor and acceptor, respectively; a 4.7% of PCE with an active area of 59.52 cm2 was achieved when the device was processed from o-methylanisole using a doctor-blade method, showing a promising future for the commercialization of OSCs.
Recently, we reported a rod-shaped acceptor, (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-((2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-yl)bis(methanylidene))bis(3-octyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (T2-ORH) with a simple structure; it is composed of an unfused electron-rich core comprising bithiophene and electron-withdrawing octyl-substituted rhodanine end-capping groups. This symmetric T2-ORH exhibited high crystallinity and impressive PCEs of 9.33% for a binary cell with poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):T2-ORH (1:2) and 11.55% for a ternary-blend device with PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-ORH (1:1:1). Nevertheless, the NFA-OSCs with T2-ORH were fabricated with a CF solvent because of its limited solubility and are therefore incompatible with large-scale production. Chlorinated solvents show high solvating ability and lead to high PCEs in NFA-OSCs but should not be used for printing devices, particularly in large-scale production, because of environmental issues. Therefore, for the chlorine-free and large-scale fabrication of an NFA-OSC, we designed a new, simple, bithiophene-based NFA, T2-OEHRH, in which asymmetric alkyl side chains have been introduced onto the end groups (Fig. 1a). Asymmetric NFAs have recently been considered a promising class of NFAs. In particular, asymmetric A–D–A-type NFAs composed of asymmetric cores or terminal groups have received great attention and PCEs greater than 10% have been achieved from asymmetric IDTT or indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) derivatives because, compared with their symmetric counterparts, they exhibit stronger intermolecular binding and larger dipole moments. However, despite the side-chain engineering effectively controlling molecular orientation and packing behavior, we know of only two reported examples of asymmetric A–D–A-type NFAs with asymmetric side chains, both of which have several stereoisomers in their side chains. One is an IDT derivative composed of asymmetric side chains of octyl and hexylphenyl (IDT-OB, 10.12%), and the other is its IDTT counterpart (IDTT-OB, 11.19%). In addition, asymmetric-structured NFAs have rarely been studied in green-solvent-processable NFA-OSCs, and considerable room exists for enhancing their PCEs compared with those of chlorinated-solvent-processed NFA-OSCs.
In the present work, the asymmetric NFA T2-OEHRH, which is composed of asymmetric side chains (octyl and 2-ethylhexyl) and an unfused simple bithiophene core, was easily synthesized and successfully used for OSC applications. In addition to maintaining the advantages of the symmetric T2-ORH, such as facile synthesis and physical properties that well match those of the PTB7-Th polymer donor, the asymmetric T2-OEHRH exhibits excellent solubility in toluene and xylene as well as CF at room temperature, offering an opportunity for processing high-efficiency NFA-OSCs from non-halogenated solvents. A PCE of 12.01% can be achieved in spin-coated ternary-blend devices with PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH dissolved in a non-halogenated toluene solvent system. Previously reported high-efficiency (>10%) devices based on asymmetric NFAs have been fabricated using chlorinated solvents such as CF and CB. The T2-ORH-based ternary-blend OSCs show poor photovoltaic properties (2.35%) when processed under the same conditions because of excessive self-aggregation/crystallization in photoactive films. Thus, the facile asymmetric strategy proposed here could effectively improve both the material properties and device performance. More importantly, because of the improved material solubility and film morphology, we successfully fabricated large-area NFA-OSC modules with a surprisingly high PCE of 9.32% (substrate size = 100 cm2 and aperture size = 55.5 cm2) with toluene as the solvent under ambient conditions using a D-bar coater. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest reported one for an NFA-based, large-area (>1 cm2) OSC module processed from a non-halogenated solvent. These results demonstrate the great potential of the unfused simple T2-OEHRH as an acceptor material for eco-friendly and high-performance organic electronics. Notably, the unfused simple chemical structure and such a short synthesis procedure of T2-OEHRH are beneficial for its future industrialization.

The novel small-molecular acceptor T2-OEHRH can be easily synthesized via the Suzuki coupling reaction with octylrhodanine–thiophene (compound 1) and 2-ethylhexylrhodanine–thiophene (compound 2). Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized through a Knoevenagel condensation between the corresponding alkylrhodanines and the commercially available thiophene derivatives. The detailed synthesis processes are described in Scheme 1. The symmetric reference acceptor T2-ORH was synthesized according to the method described in our previous work. The synthesis of asymmetric materials is inevitably more complex than that of the corresponding symmetrical structures, as is the case with T2-OEHRH and T2-ORH. The number of synthetic steps (NSS) required to prepare T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH from the commercially available materials is two for T2-ORH but five for T2-OEHRH. However, compared with other (mostly fused) asymmetric NFAs, the synthesis of T2-OEHRH is still relatively simple and inexpensive, resulting in a total synthetic yield as high as 56%. The chemical structure of T2-OEHRH was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S4), high-resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis results (ESI).

The introduction of asymmetric alkyl side chains is expected to strongly affect both the solubility of NFAs as well as the molecular packing/ordering and film morphology simultaneously. The solubility of the NFAs was tested using chlorinated CF and chlorine-free toluene solvents according to the method described in the literature. As expected, T2-OEHRH, with asymmetric alkyl side chains, exhibited excellent solubility compared with T2-ORH. Octylrhodanine-substituted symmetric T2-ORH is soluble in CF at a concentration less than 20 mg mL−1, whereas T2-OEHRH with an asymmetric alkyl side chain exhibited excellent solubility in CF (<50 mg mL−1) at room temperature. A similar tendency of the solubility properties of NFAs was observed in the case of toluene. The asymmetric T2-OEHRH showed solubility in toluene (<30 mg mL−1) suitable for the solution processing of NFA-OSCs with green solvents at room temperature; by contrast, the solubility of T2-ORH in toluene was less than 10 mg mL−1.
To characterize the intermolecular interactions among NFAs, we also carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations; see Table S1. The calculated intermolecular interaction energies for T2-OEHRH are ca. −1.57 and −1.53 eV for the syn and anti dimer conformers (Fig. S5), respectively, whereas the corresponding values for T2-ORH are ca. −1.81 and −1.74 eV, respectively. The interaction energies between the side chains and those between the backbones are also consistently smaller for the T2-OEHRH dimers. In particular, interactions between one of the pairs of octyl and ethylhexyl side chains in the anti conformer of T2-OEHRH are calculated to be only ca. 80 meV, which supposedly enables facile disruption of the intermolecular interaction of the dimer. These relatively weak intermolecular interactions for T2-OEHRH dimers are consistent with their greater solubility. Therefore, according to the aforementioned results, the asymmetric T2-OEHRH with octyl and ethylhexyl groups substituted onto the end groups could enable the use of a non-halogenated solvent for the fabrication of high-performance NFA-OSCs.
The thermal properties of the NFAs were characterized via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S6) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating or cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 1e); the corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. The two NFAs showed almost identical thermal decomposition behaviors, exhibiting good thermal stability (T5d) with less than 5% loss of their weights upon heating to 384 °C. The melting temperature (Tm) and recrystallization temperature (Tcryst) for T2-ORH were 204 °C (ΔHm = −69.95 J g −1) and 175 °C (ΔHcryst = 68.75 J g−1), respectively. By comparison, the ΔHm and ΔHcryst of T2-OEHRH were lower, likely because of reduced crystallinity resulting from the introduction of the asymmetric alkyl side chains;T2-OEHRH exhibited a Tm value of 154 °C (ΔHm = −45.40 J g−1) and a Tcryst value of 111 °C (ΔHcryst = 41.95 J g−1).

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular orientation/packing properties of T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH, we characterized them using 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. S7 presents the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line–cut profiles of the neat NFA films. The pattern of the as-cast T2-ORH displayed a series of multiple (h00) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction. After the CF solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment, the pattern of the T2-ORH film showed strong (00h) diffraction spots in both the OOP and IP directions with ring-like reflections, indicating a highly crystalline structure. By contrast, the patterns of the as-cast and SVA-treated T2-OEHRH films showed no obvious diffraction peaks, suggesting an amorphous-like state. Thus, the asymmetric T2-OEHRH effectively suppresses the excessive self-aggregation/crystalline nature of T2-ORH because of its modified alkyl side chains. Consequently, T2-OEHRH exhibits greater solubility than T2-ORH and can be used with halogen-free solvent processing.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of NFAs are displayed in Fig. 1c and d, and the corresponding optical properties are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH in the CF solution state are identical, with an absorption maximum (λmax) at 510 nm. Compared with the λmax of the solution-state NFAs, those of the film-state samples were blue-shifted by 65 nm and 30 nm for T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH, respectively, indicating H-aggregation, where molecules stack predominantly face-to-face. By comparison, J-type aggregation was observed in the SVA-treated films compared to the as-cast films. These phenomena agreed well with the GIWAXS results discussed above, where the GIWAXS patterns of the NFA films were changed by annealing. The λmax peaks of the SVA-treated T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH were located at 524 and 494 nm, respectively, and the bathochromic shifts induced by annealing were approximately 79 and 14 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1d. The larger blue- or red-shifts of T2-ORH can be explained by the improved molecular packing/ordering properties of T2-ORH compared with those of T2-OEHRH. In addition, shoulder peaks observed at approximately 575 nm were more pronounced in the spectrum of T2-ORH, indicating a stronger π–π stacking and a more ordered crystalline structure of T2-ORH, consistent with the results of the DSC and 2D-GIWAXS analyses. The results suggest that the asymmetric alkyl side chain of T2-OEHRH could alleviate the severe self-aggregation/crystallization of symmetric T2-ORH. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) were estimated to be 1.98 eV for both T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH, which could give rise to a desirable complementary absorption with the low-band gap photoactive materials PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR for ternary-blend NFA-OSCs (Fig. 1c and d).

The frontier energy levels of the NFAs were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S8); the electrochemical properties are summarized in Fig. 1b and Table 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the NFAs were calculated using the empirical relationship EHOMO = −(Eonset,ox − E1/2,ferrocene + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = −(Eonset,red − E1/2,ferrocene + 4.8) eV, where Eonset,ox and Eonset,red are the onset potentials of oxidation and reduction, respectively, assuming that the energy level of ferrocene (Fc) is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of T2-OEHRH were calculated to be −5.65 and −3.58 eV, respectively, which are approximately the same as those of T2-ORH (HOMO = −5.66 eV and LUMO = −3.59 eV). Thus, the modification of the alkyl side chain on the end groups improved the solubility in non-halogenated solvents and alleviated strong self-crystalline aggregation without sacrificing the optoelectronic and electrochemical properties.

In our previous work, we demonstrated that ternary-blend NFA-OSCs based on PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-ORH showed surprisingly high efficiency and thermal/light/air stability compared with their counterpart binary devices. This enhanced performance of the ternary-blend NFA-OSCs is attributed to the coexisting working mechanism of the energy transfer and alloy-like structure providing complementary light absorption and a robust morphology. Therefore, we selected the low-band gap polymer donor PTB7-Th and small-molecule acceptor EH-IDTBR as photoactive materials to be paired with wide-band gap NFAs in the present study (Fig. 1a and b). To investigate the photovoltaic properties in ternary-blend NFA-OSCs, we used an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PEIE/PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:NFA/MoOx/Ag. The thickness of the photoactive layers was constant at 100 nm. The optimized weight ratio of PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH was found to be 1:1:1 (Tables S2–S3 and Fig. S9), consistent with the configuration used in our previous work on PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-ORH. Full details of the device fabrication procedure are provided in the ESI. The best current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the ternary-blend NFA-OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic results are summarized in Table 3. To investigate the photovoltaic properties depending on the type of NFAs with symmetric or asymmetric alkyl side chains, we first used CF as the processing solvent because of its good solvation ability for both NFAs. When processed with CF with 1.0 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE), the T2-ORH-based ternary-blend OSC exhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.05 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.62 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 62%, achieving a PCE of 11.47%. Similarly, the T2-OEHRH-based ternary cells showed an optimized PCE of 11.44%, with a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 17.27 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64%. As a non-halogenated solvent, toluene with 1.0 vol% DPE was also used as the processing solvent for the fabrication of ternary-blend NFA-OSCs. While the PCE of the T2-ORH-based device decreased to 2.35%, that of the T2-OEHRH-based device was 12.10%, which is an improvement even when compared with the PCE of its counterpart processed with a CF solvent. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the aforementioned ternary-blend NFA-OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectrum of the T2-ORH-based device with toluene solvent substantially decreased in intensity compared with the spectrum of the CF-processed device in the region of 400–650 nm, which corresponds to the absorption region of T2-ORH. By contrast, the T2-OEHRH-based device processed with toluene solvent exhibited a photocurrent response as high as ∼80%, covering a broad spectral range (300–800 nm). In particular, the EQE values exceeded 70% in the wavelength range of 450–700 nm, consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the photoactive materials. This difference in absorption behavior between T2-ORH and T2-OEHRH is mainly caused by the differences in film morphology behaviors resulting from the differences in solubility between the two NFAs.

To deeply examine the phase separation and morphological properties of the ternary-blend photoactive films, surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded. The films processed with CF show similar phase separation and morphological features (Fig. 2c and e). Meanwhile, the T2-ORH-based film processed with toluene solvent (Fig. 2d) exhibited large rectangular domains attributed to strongly aggregated T2-ORH as a result of its poor solubility, where strong self-trapping of excitons and a discontinuous charge transport channel occur, severely limiting the photovoltaic performance. For the toluene-cast film based on T2-OEHRH (Fig. 2f), the highly uniform phase separation and favorable morphology are ascribed to the excellent solubility of the T2-OEHRH. The high-magnification SEM images (Fig. S10) show that the T2-ORH-based photoactive film exhibited excessive self-aggregation/crystallization behavior. By contrast, the surface of the T2-OEHRH-based ternary-blend photoactive films exhibited structural homogeneities and uniform/compact morphologies. Optical microscopy also revealed the presence of excessive self-aggregates in the T2-ORH-based films but a smooth and uniform surface morphology of T2-OEHRH films (Fig. S11). The mean size and shape of the aggregates in the T2-ORH-based films are dependent on the choice of solvent. T2-ORH containing symmetric octyl side chains exhibits limited solubility in organic solvents, where aggregates comprise pure T2-ORH domains that precipitate from the solution as the films are prepared. However, the asymmetric alkyl-side-chain-substituted T2-OEHRH exhibited excellent solubility in organic solvents and formed a uniform and favorable film morphology. The nano-morphology of the blend films influenced their photovoltaic performance in NFA-OSCs. A direct correlation appears to exist between the degree of phase separation and the output photovoltaic parameters in the ternary-blend systems. Thus, the asymmetric alkyl side chain on the NFA increases its solubility without sacrificing photovoltaic performance and appears to be beneficial for eco-friendly processed device performance.

Although the ternary-blend OSC based on T2-ORH processed by CF exhibited an impressive PCE of 11.47%, the device with toluene showed a poor photovoltaic performance of 2.35%. Optimizing the interfacial area and domain size of T2-ORH-based devices while simultaneously achieving compatibility with eco-friendly roll-to-roll processing for high-throughput production is difficult. By contrast, the asymmetric T2-OEHRH-based OSC processed with halogen-free toluene solvent with 1.0 vol% DPE additive exhibited a substantial PCE of 12.10% because of its optimized BHJ morphological properties. Herein, to study the influence of the DPE additive on the charge carrier generation/transport/recombination and optical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties, we fabricated toluene-processed NFA-OSCs based on PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH, and investigated the DPE additive–property relationships as a function of the DPE volume. Fig. 3a shows the best J–V characteristics of the ternary-blend NFA-OSCs as a function of the DPE concentration under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The corresponding key photovoltaic metrics are listed in Table 4. According to the J–V curves, almost no change was observed in the VOC after various amounts of DPE were added, except for NFA-OSCs with 3.0 vol% DPE. However, the JSC, FF, and PCE of the devices strongly depended on the DPE content. The control device without any DPE additive shows a PCE of approximately 8.16% with a VOC of 1.05 V, a JSC of 14.67 mA cm−2, and an FF of 53%. After 0.5 vol% DPE was added in the BHJ solution containing ternary-blend photoactive materials, the JSC increased from 14.67 to 17.08 mA cm−2, the FF slightly increased from 53 to 56%, and the PCE increased to 10.04%. The device with 1.0 vol% DPE shows the highest PCE value of approximately 12.10%, with a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 18.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65%. The values of JSC and FF began to substantially decline when the DPE concentration was greater than 1.0 vol% DPE, likely because of the coarsening of the BHJ morphology in the ternary-blend photoactive films. Therefore, the non-halogenated solvent additive, DPE, strongly affected the photovoltaic properties in ternary-blend NFA-OSCs (Fig. 3c). The EQE spectra of T2-OEHRH-based ternary-blend OSCs cover a wide absorption range following the absorption spectra of donor and multi-acceptors (Fig. 3b). The EQE curves show a similar trend to the value of JSC calculated from the J–V characteristics. The greatest increase in JSC was realized by addition of 1.0 vol% of the DPE additive to the BHJ solution, resulting in a strong photoresponse with a maximum value of 80% in the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm compared with the control devices. However, a further increase in the DPE additive content dramatically decreased the JSC value, as evident from the EQE spectra. Thus, the addition of DPE additive showed a positive effect until its concentration reached 1.0 vol% DPE; at higher concentrations, no positive effect on the photovoltaic performance was observed in the ternary-blend OSCs.

The absorption coefficient UV-vis spectrum was measured to understand the effect of DPE on the optical properties of the ternary-blend photoactive films with different vol% DPE, as displayed in Fig. S12 and S13 (ESI). As expected, the ternary-blend photoactive films showed an enhanced absorption coefficient from 0.0 vol% to 1.0 vol% DPE additive over a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the absorption coefficient originating from PTB7-Th and EH-IDTBR as well as the T2-OEHRH component also increased in the systems with 1 vol% DPE. Thus, the packing/ordering and morphological properties of the T2-OEHRH-based ternary-blend films were modulated by the addition of DPE additive, whereas the light absorption substantially decreased when the DPE content exceeded 1.0 vol%, consistent with the EQE spectra.
To study the exciton generation and dissociation properties, we carried out photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements on the ternary-blend photoactive films with different ratios of DPE volume (Fig. S14). At excitation wavelengths of 480, 550, and 650 nm, the 1.0 vol% DPE-based ternary-blend film exhibited the highest PL quenching efficiency, whereas the devices with excessive DPE (2.0 or 3.0 vol%) showed poor charge transfer properties, indicating substantial geminate recombination. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) charge carrier mobilities were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime (Table 4 and Fig. S15). When the amount of DPE was increased from 0.0 vol% to 1.0 vol%, the μh of the corresponding devices was found to be steadily enhanced; however, it gradually decreased when the DPE content exceeded 1.0 vol%. By contrast, the μe was lower than the μh irrespective of the DPE content, but the trend for μe with DPE volume fraction in toluene followed the trend for μh. Hence, despite the imbalanced μh and μe values, the enhanced FF with 1.0 vol% of DPE must be related to its relatively high μh and μe values. Such an improved charge transport ability with reduced charge carrier recombination observed in the 1.0 vol% DPE device is attributed to the suppression of the overly large crystalline domains, as discussed in Section 2.6.
To further estimate the charge recombination phenomenon, the dependence of the VOC, JSC, and FF characteristics on the incident light intensity from 3.2 to 100 mW cm−2 was examined (Fig. S16). As shown in Fig. 3d, a plot of VOC as a function of the light intensity based on VOC ∝ (nkT)/(qln(Plight)) is obtained, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, q is the elementary charge, and Plight is the light intensity. A slope of approximately 2 kT/q indicates a trap-assisted recombination system; by contrast, for a kT/q value close to unity, bimolecular recombination is considered the main mechanism of charge carrier losses. The ternary-blend NFA-OSC with 1.0 vol% DPE showed a slope of 1.08 kT/q, whereas the control device without the DPE additive exhibited a value of 1.55 kT/q. These results demonstrate that the 1.0 vol% DPE-based device reduced interfacial surface-trap densities between the photoactive components in the ternary-blend systems, thereby contributing to enhanced JSC and FF values. However, a slope 2.46 kT/q was obtained for the device with 2.0% DPE, implying that severe trap-assisted recombination occurs in ternary-blend NFA-OSCs. We speculated that a recombination process is generated by excessive morphological aggregation after the addition of greater than 1.0 vol% DPE. The dependence of JSC at various light intensities is presented, as shown in Fig. 3e. In principle, the JSC shows a power-law dependence on the light intensity for OSCs, which can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Plight)α. Weak bimolecular recombination in the device would result in a linear dependence of JSC on the light intensity, with an α value approaching unity. The extracted α values are 0.93, 0.96, and 0.92 for the ternary-blend OSCs with 0.0 vol%, 1.0 vol%, and 2.0 vol% DPE, respectively. Thus, the addition of 1.0 vol% DPE to toluene increased the α value of the resulting device to 0.96, which is a direct indication of the effective suppression of bimolecular charge recombination in the ternary-blend OSCs. Additionally, a qualitative study of the FF values as a function of the light intensity was carried out (Fig. S17). The ternary-blend device with 1.0 vol% DPE yielded a higher FF value at all light intensities compared with the other devices, indicating that it was capable of the most efficient charge extraction and transport to the respective electrodes with reduced charge recombination. Moreover, to gain insight into the effect of the non-halogenated DPE additive on the photocurrent and exciton dissociation in ternary-blend NFA-OSCs, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) characteristics were measured (Fig. S18). The ternary-blend device with 1.0 vol% DPE displayed a saturated photocurrent (Jsat) at a low Veff. This result suggests that this system had zero net trapped charges and that the electric field was uniform throughout the photoactive layer. By comparison with the control device without the DPE additive, we concluded that the 1.0 vol% DPE promoted effective exciton generation/dissociation and charge carrier extraction/transport to the respective electrodes.
To further reveal the charge carrier transport time and recombination lifetime of the ternary-blend NFA-OSCs, we conducted intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) under a short-circuit condition and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) under an open-circuit condition (Fig. 3f and g). The charge carrier transport time (τt) and recombination lifetime (τr) were calculated from the frequency minima (fmin) in the IMPS and IMVS data using the relation 1/2πfmin. As depicted in Fig. 3f, the calculated τt of the device with 1.0% DPE was 0.24 μs, whereas the τt values of the 0.0% and 2.0% DPE-treated ternary-blend systems were 0.26 and 0.28 μs, respectively. The reduced charge transport time in the 1.0% DPE-based ternary-blend device indicates improved charge carrier extraction from the photoactive layer to the respective electrode, which is beneficial to the JSC and FF. The τr values were 3.01, 5.33, and 1.68 μs for the 0.0 vol%, 1.0 vol%, and 2.0 vol% DPE-based devices, respectively (Fig. 3g). The observed longer recombination lifetime in the ternary-blend NFA-OSC with 1.0 vol% DPE suggests that reduced trap-assisted and bimolecular charge recombination losses can be achieved.

To gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between molecular packing/ordering and the DPE additive, 2D-GIWAXS and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) analyses were carried out with the optimized device fabrication conditions (Fig. 4, S19, and S20). The GIWAXS results of neat films without and with 1.0 vol% DPE additive are shown in Fig. S19. The neat PTB7-Th and EH-IDTBR films showed dominant face-on orientation, with a (100) lamellar scattering peak in the IP direction and (010) π–π stacking in the OOP direction. After DPE was added to toluene, identical scattering patterns were observed for the neat PTB7-Th film. Interestingly, neat EH-IDTBR with 1.0 vol% DPE improved the molecular packing and ordering, as verified by the observation of reduced (100) lamellar and (010) π–π stacking distance in the IP and OOP directions, respectively. Meanwhile, the pattern of the neat T2-OEHRH film without the DPE additive showed no distinct diffraction peak in either direction, whereas the pattern of the T2-OEHRH film with 1.0 vol% DPE additive exhibited strong (100) and (001) diffraction peaks in both the OOP and IP directions; in addition, a (010) π–π stacking peak is observed in the IP direction, indicating that DPE induces interactions between T2-OEHRH and then forms T2-OEHRH aggregates. Fig. 4 presents GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding OOP and IP line–cut profiles of the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH (1:1:1) photoactive films with different vol% DPE. Interestingly, a strong (100) lamellar diffraction peak at 0.32 Å−1 along the OOP direction from T2-OEHRH was observed in the ternary-blend film even without DPE addition. This observation is attributed to the BHJ ternary-blend materials inducing molecular packing and ordering of T2-OEHRH in the absence of the DPE additive. Meanwhile, the ternary-blend photoactive films with 1.0 vol% DPE show an enhanced (100) lamellar peak in the OOP direction and a (010) π–π stacking signal in the IP direction from T2-OEHRH; they also exhibit a strong merged (100) lamellar peak in the IP direction and a (010) π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction from the PTB7-Th and EH-IDTBR components. Thus, we expected that the optimized crystallinity of T2-OEHRH is well established with 1.0 vol% DPE and that alloy-like structures are formed with EH-IDTBR, without the disruption of the original molecular packing structures in the ternary-blend systems. Notably, improved molecular packing and ordering properties have been the usual target for high-efficiency NFA-OSCs because of the enhanced charge carrier mobility, intermolecular interaction, light-harvesting ability, and device stability. With a further increase of the DPE concentration, obvious (001) peaks in both the OOP and IP directions and high-order (h00) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction arise because of the excessive self-aggregation/crystallinity between T2-OEHRH, leading to poor JSC and FF values.

NEXAFS measurements were collected in the total electron yield (TEY) mode to investigate the molecular orientation of the bulk state of the photoactive layers (Fig. 4h and S20). The NEXAFS spectra were analyzed over the incident X-ray angle range 30° ≤ θ ≤ 70°, which provides information about the average tilt angle (α) of the molecular chains from the dichroism of the C 1s → π* resonant transitions perpendicular to the plane of the conjugated planes (details described in the ESI). The average α value of the control ternary-blend photoactive films without the DPE additive, as calculated from the linear fittings, is 61.39° (α = 90° edge-on and α = 0° face-on orientation). However, α was changed to 63.60° and 65.70° for 0.5 vol% and 1.0 vol% DPE-based ternary-blend films, respectively. The dichroic ratios (R) were also determined to compare the orientation tendency of the ternary-blend films. The calculated R values of the 0.0 vol%, 0.5 vol%, and 1.0 vol% photoactive films are 0.21, 0.27, and 0.34, respectively (R = 0.7 edge-on, R = 0 random, and R = −1 face-on orientation). The trend of R is similar to that of α, indicating that the ternary-blend films with 1.0 vol% mainly adopt edge-on orientation with improved molecular packing and ordering properties compared with the other films; this finding is consistent with the results of the GIWAXS analyses. Although T2-OEHRH shows an amorphous-like packing and ordering behavior, the crystallinity of T2-OEHRH grows with DPE addition. Therefore, T2-OEHRH initially becomes homogeneously dispersed in the BHJ ternary-based photoactive film and thereafter undergoes favorable phase separation induced by the DPE additive. This observation indicates that better structural ordering and a well-defined structure in ternary-blend films with 1.0 vol% DPE additive should be beneficial for enhanced charge transport/recombination and, hence, increased charge carrier mobilities, JSC, as well as FF in ternary-blend NFA-OSCs.

We used tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to further investigate the relationship between the BHJ morphology in the ternary-blend systems and their photovoltaic performance. Fig. 5 shows that the ternary-blend film without DPE additive exhibited a small-length-scale phase separation, with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.86 nm (Fig. 5a and f). By contrast, the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH film with 1.0 vol% DPE showed a favorable phase-separated domain with a high RMS value of 7.77 nm (Fig. 5c and h), which formed percolation pathways for sufficient charge carrier transport. When the DPE concentration was increased to 2.0 vol% in the ternary-blend BHJ solution, a highly aggregated surface morphology with a substantially increased RMS roughness greater than 21.00 nm was observed. The coarse and unfavorable phase separation in the ternary-blend films led to poor charge transfer and transport and to lower JSC and FF values. The TEM image also indicates that the 1.0 vol% DPE-based ternary-blend films exhibit a uniform and well-mixed interpenetrating morphology with optimized crystalline domain sizes compared with other ternary-blend films with 0.0 vol%, 0.5 vol%, 2.0 vol%, and 3.0 vol% DPE additive. Notably, a homogeneous and uniform morphology with an optimized crystalline interpenetrating network in ternary-blend films is beneficial for facilitating photo-induced charge transfer and transport, restraining charge carrier recombination, and thus improving device performance.


The large-area manufacturing is ultimately required for commercialization of OSCs. Although PCEs greater than 7% have been achieved with fullerene-based large-area OSC modules, large-area OSCs based on NFAs have rarely been studied. Furthermore, despite exhibiting excellent solubilization ability and efficiency, the halogenated solvents need to be replaced with green solvents to address environmental issues in scalable fabrication processes. In this regard, we demonstrate high-efficiency large-area NFA-OSC modules with reduced PCE loss, processed from non-halogenated toluene solvent and 1.0 vol% DPE additive using a D-bar coater in air. A schematic and the best J–V curve of the large-area module containing 11 stripe cells are displayed in Fig. 6a, b and S21. Photographic images from the glass and top electrode side of this large-area device are shown in Fig. 6c. The best-performing device exhibits an impressive PCE as high as 9.32% with a VOC of 11.47 V, JSC of 1.29 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63% in the aperture area of 55.5 cm2. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is one of the highest reported for an NFA-based large-area OSC processed from a non-halogenated solvent system.

To further characterize the surface and bulk morphological properties of the ternary-blend photoactive films deposited using a D-bar coating in air, AFM and TEM analyses were conducted; the corresponding images are shown in Fig. 6d. The ternary-blend films cast via D-bar coating in air exhibited a uniform and well-mixed interpenetrating morphology with an optimized domain size and surface roughness (RMS = 6.74 nm), which is similar compared with that of a small-area photoactive film deposited via spin coating in a N2-filled glove box. As a result, a simple modification of the chemical structure (i.e., asymmetric side-chain strategy) can successfully improve the material solubility of T2-OEHRH, making it a promising candidate for use in eco-friendly printable electronics.

We developed a wide-band gap NFA, T2-OEHRH, with a simple and asymmetric chemical structure. Our strategy of an asymmetric alkyl chain on the end group enabled T2-OEHRH to effectively avoid severe self-aggregation/crystallization and substantially improved its solubility compared with that of the symmetric reference material T2-ORH. T2-OEHRH exhibited excellent solubility in halogen-free solvent systems, which led to a uniform and homogeneous nano-morphology. By contrast, the relatively poor solubility of symmetric T2-ORH limits the application of NFA-OSCs under non-toxic processing conditions. We also examined the influence of the DPE volume on the charge transfer/transport/recombination and optoelectronic, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of the ternary-blend NFA-OSCs. As a result, the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR:T2-OEHRH-based device with 1 vol% DPE exhibited the best PCE of 12.10% with a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 18.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65%, which is ascribed to the optimized structural ordering and well-defined BHJ structure with an interpenetrating network of ternary-blend photoactive films. More importantly, we successfully demonstrated a substantial PCE of 9.32% for large-area NFA-OSC modules (substrate size = 100 cm2 and aperture size = 55.5 cm2) fabricated via D-bar coating in air. As a result, this work suggests an effective alkyl side-chain engineering strategy to obtain high-performance and benign-solvent-processable NFA-OSCs, thereby providing an important advancement toward meeting the requirements for future practical applications.
