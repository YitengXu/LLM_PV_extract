Fabrication of high-quality perovskite films with a large grain size and fewer defects is always crucial to achieve efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report a simple and effective method for crystal growth and defect passivation via additive engineering. It is found that bidentate ligand 2,2′-bipyridine (Bpy) and tridentate ligand 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (Tpy) show a positive effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) while a negative effect is observed for monodentate pyridine (Py). Bpy or Tpy additives increase the grain size and carrier lifetimes, which indicates that the degree of interaction between Lewis acid species in the precursor solution and pyridine derivatives plays a critical role in modulating grain growth and passivating defects. Moreover, device stability is improved upon introduction of Bpy or Tpy additives, which is mainly ascribed to suppressed trap-assisted non-radiative recombination as a consequence of reduced defect density. This work highlights the importance of rational engineering of additives for the purpose of simultaneous realization of morphological improvement and defect passivation in efficient and stable PSCs.

Owing to their intriguing and unique optoelectronic properties, organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have been extensively applied in several fields, such as perovskite solar cells (PSCs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, memristors,etc. Since the pioneering report on solid-state PSCs with a PCE of 9.7% in 2012, PSCs have been the focus of academia and industry accompanied by an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement from 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 1) to a presently certified 23.7%, and are widely recognized as promising and appealing next generation solar cells. The striking PCE enhancement in the past several years is mainly ascribed to the device structure engineering, development and optimization of charge transporting materials, interface engineering and optimization of perovskite film quality. Among them, perovskite film quality plays an important role in the achievement of efficient and stable PSCs. Although the currently certified PCE is up to 23.3%, it is still far from the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit efficiency (30.5%) for the perovskite material with a bandgap of 1.6 eV, which was reported to be mainly due to interface recombination and the trap-assisted non-radiative (also called Shockley–Read–Hall, SRH) recombination in perovskite films. The perovskite morphology has been known to affect charge transport and collection, where a low PCE correlates with a poor morphology. Except for affecting the PCE, perovskite film quality is closely related to device stability, including light stability, moisture stability and thermal stability. It was reported that decomposition of perovskite films preferentially occurred at grain boundaries (GBs) because a large number of defects especially deep energy level defects were demonstrated to be mainly located at GBs during uncontrollable crystallization. Consequently, it is indispensable to maximize the PCE and stability through fabricating high-quality perovskite films with minimized trap states and thus SRH non-radiative recombination losses.

For the purpose of improving perovskite film quality, various strategies have been developed and attempted, such as composition engineering, precursor solvent engineering, antisolvent engineering, procedure development and optimization, post-treatment, and additive engineering. Among them, additive engineering was found to be one of the effective ways for realization of high-quality perovskite films because of the structural and functional diversity of additives. Various additive materials were investigated including polymers, fullerenes, organic halide salts, inorganic acids, metal halide salts, and nanoparticles. Among the reported additives, some additives were developed to just improve film stability or charge transportation and collection. However, the purpose of developing most of the additives in the past was to improve the perovskite film quality through either modulating the kinetics of grain nucleation and growth or passivating defects/trap states. It is widely recognized that poor perovskite film quality with a small grain size and a large number of GBs and defects is mainly attributed to fast crystallization. Therefore, it is required to appropriately control and modulate the crystallization rate through rationally tuning the strength of the chemical interaction between additives and perovskite precursor compositions. Most of the additives, such as MACl (MA = CH3NH3+), MASCN, NH4SCN, and inorganic acids like HI, HBr, and hypophosphorous acid, were demonstrated to be effective in controlling crystal growth and, however, were less effective for defect passivation. Some of the additives with Lewis base or acid properties, such as PVP (poly(4-vinylpyridine)), organic dye (AQ310), PCBM and ITIC, and the p-type π-conjugated polymer PBDB-T, were used to only passivate defects in perovskite films without improving crystallization.
In order to simultaneously achieve an improved morphology and reduced defects, incorporation of multiple additives with different functions into perovskite precursor solutions may be one of the best ways. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies on simultaneous achievement of morphological improvement and defect passivation through introduction of different additives have been reported. Since two additives were reported to synergistically improve the perovskite film morphology, it seems interesting to develop additive compositions (or formulations) to achieve simultaneous effects. Another way is to integrate multiple functions into the same additive. Simultaneous improvement of the perovskite morphology and passivation of its defects was reported with a single additive such as N-doped graphene, side-chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP), and carbonized bamboo-derived carbon nanodots (CNDs). Thus, additive engineering has been proved to be an effective approach to obtain high quality perovskite films.
Herein, we report a simple and effective additive engineering strategy through introducing the bidentate ligand 2,2′-bipyridine (abbreviated as Bpy) or tridentate ligand 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (abbreviated as Tpy) into the perovskite precursor solution. The effects of the monodentate ligand pyridine (Py), Bpy and Tpy on device performances are compared. Bpy and Tpy additives are found to have a positive effect on the PCE as compared to that of the control device without additives, while a negative effect is observed for Py. The degree of interaction between PbI2 and additives is considered to be involved in crystallization. Additionally, Bpy or Tpy with strong Lewis base properties can effectively passivate defects due to iodide vacancies. The increased grain size and effective defect passivation are responsible for the substantial increase in the carrier lifetime and reduction in defect density, which eventually leads to an improved PCE and device stability.

In order to improve the perovskite film quality, we try to incorporate Lewis base additives with different coordination abilities into the perovskite precursor solution, aimed at improving perovskite film crystallization and morphology and passivating the defects in films. The molecular structures of the additives used in this work are shown in Fig. 1a, and Fig. 1b schematically illustrates the device configuration employed in this study, which is composed of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au (bl and mp represent blocking and mesoporous, respectively). The perovskite composition for this study is FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3, in which we used Cl− ions to control crystal growth. It is well known that improved crystallization, morphology and thus carrier lifetimes can be achieved by incorporation of Cl into the precursor solution. Considering that there is still no clear conclusion about whether or not Cl− ions can be incorporated into the lattice of MAPbI3 or FAPbI3, the formula FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 is adopted in the present work. Besides, hydroiodic acid (HI) solution was also added to the precursor solution to improve the morphology of perovskite films according to its effect reported elsewhere. The additives studied here were directly added to the above as-prepared perovskite precursor solution.

First of all, we investigate the effect of the concentration of different additives (Py, Bpy and Tpy) on the photovoltaic performance. The ratio of additive to Pb2+ is varied and denoted as Py-x%, Bpy-x%, and Tpy-x%, where x represents the content of additives. The device without additives is defined as the control device. Fig. S1–3 present the photographs of perovskite precursor solutions with different additives. As shown in Fig. S1 and S3, no precipitates are observed after introduction of Py or Tpy after aging for 12 h even if the content is up to 4% for Py and 2% for Tpy. In fact, it was reported that MAPbI3 can be obtained at room temperature using the PbI2·(Py)2 complex. This suggests that the interaction between Py and PbI2 is very weak. However, the stable Lewis acid–base adduct PbI2·DMSO can be obtained at room temperature, which indicates that Py exhibits a weaker interaction with PbI2 as compared to DMSO. In contrast, a large amount of precipitate is observed for both fresh and 12 h-aged precursors with Bpy when the Bpy content exceeds 2%, although no precipitate is observed when adding less than 1% Bpy as illustrated in Fig. S2. However, the precipitate is dissolved after addition of HI solution, which means that the solubility of the formed Bpy–PbI2 complex is increased upon decreasing the pH of the solution. As illustrated in Fig. S4, a large number of solids are formed at a higher concentration (10%) of Bpy or Tpy. Moreover, the solids exhibit different colors probably due to complexation between PbI2 and additives with different chelation ability. This indicates that both Bpy and Tpy can form complexes with PbI2 and the formed complexes exhibit poor solubility in DMF/DMSO mixed solvents. We also check the solubility of Bpy or Tpy additives in pure DMF or DMSO as shown in Fig. S5. It is clearly found that both Bpy and Tpy exhibit excellent solubility in pure DMF or DMSO solvents even in the case where the concentration is increased up to 100 mg mL−1. This demonstrates that the generated precipitates in perovskite precursor solutions are from complexes between additives and PbI2 instead of bare additives. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1, all of the photovoltaic parameters are gradually reduced as the Py content is increased, which could be related to its extremely weak complexing ability with PbI2 and low boiling point. It was reported that a perovskite film was fabricated by directly converting PbI2·(Py)2 into MAPbI3 at room temperature through a sequential deposition process. This indicates that the Py monodentate (non-chelating) ligand is unbeneficial for slowing down the perovskite crystallization rate, leading to lower performance as compared to the film without Py. In contrast to Py, a much improved PCE is observed for the devices with Bpy (Fig. S7 and Table S2) or Tpy (Fig. S8 and Table S3), which might be attributed to the improved film quality and defect passivation (will be discussed in detail hereinafter). Evidently, the optimal ratio is 1% for Bpy and 0.2% for Tpy. In the case of Bpy, it should be stressed that the significantly reduced PCE mainly as a result of the reduced Voc and FF is observed at the concentration of 4% Bpy, different from 1% Bpy, although the perovskite film with 4% Bpy shows much improved crystallinity (Fig. 3c and d) and grain size (Fig. 4) as compared to the control film. Reduced carrier lifetimes (Fig. 5a and b) and increased defect density (Fig. 6) should be responsible for the reduced photovoltaic performance. This indicates that an optimal amount of additive is beneficial to passivate defects and increase lifetimes.
Since the positive effect on the PCE for Bpy and Tpy was discussed above, subsequently we will focus on the investigation of optimized Bpy and Tpy-based devices. Fig. 2a–d display the statistical distribution diagram of photovoltaic parameters of control, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S2 and 3. It is clearly seen that all of the photovoltaic parameters are increased after incorporating Bpy or Tpy additives. The average short-circuit current density (Jsc) is increased from 22.04 ± 0.28 mA cm−2 for the control device to 23.01 ± 0.20 mA cm−2 for the Bpy-1% device and 22.95 ± 0.29 mA cm−2 for the Tpy-0.2% device, respectively. The average open-circuit voltage (Voc) is enhanced from 1.044 ± 0.007 V for the control device to 1.061 ± 0.008 V for the Bpy-1% device and 1.050 ± 0.008 V for the Tpy-0.2% device, respectively. The average fill factor (FF) is enhanced from 0.73 ± 0.01 for the control device to 0.76 ± 0.01 for the Bpy-1% device and 0.76 ± 0.01 for the Tpy-0.2% device, respectively. As a consequence of the improved Jsc, Voc and FF, the average PCE is improved from 16.85 ± 0.44% for the control device to 18.61 ± 0.27% for the Bpy-1% device and 18.21 ± 0.29% for the Tpy-0.2% device. The improved PCEs are attributed to the improved crystallinity, increased grain size, effective defect passivation, and thus improved carrier lifetimes (will be discussed subsequently). Fig. 2e and f show J–V curves and the corresponding IPCE spectra of the best-performing control, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table S4.J–V curves were measured in reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS) with a scan rate of 130 mV s−1 under simulated AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The best-performing control device shows a Jsc of 22.48 mA cm−2 and 22.57 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.050 V and 1.050 V, and FF of 0.74 and 0.71, corresponding to a PCE of 17.58% and 16.77% in RS and FS, respectively. A higher performance is observed for Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2%: the best-performing Bpy-1% device yields a Jsc of 23.17 mA cm−2 and 23.36 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.066 V and 1.061 V, and FF of 0.77 and 0.72, corresponding to a PCE of 19.02% and 17.77% in RS and FS, respectively, and the Tpy-0.2% device produces a Jsc of 23.07 mA cm−2 and 23.23 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.062 V and 1.051 V, and FF of 0.76 and 0.74, leading to a PCE of 18.68% and 17.97% in RS and FS, respectively. Although photovoltaic parameters are improved after addition of Bpy and Tpy, hysteresis for the control device remains unchanged as shown in Fig. S9 and Table S4, which indicates that ion migration as the possible origin of hysteresis might not be influenced by additives. As illustrated in Fig. 2f, the integrated Jscs of control, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices are 21.68 mA cm−2, 22.54 mA cm−2, and 22.43 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with those from J–V curves. Fig. 2g–i exhibit the stabilized current density and PCE as a function of time for control, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices, measured at the maximum power point (Vmax = 0.878 V for the control device, Vmax = 0.892 V for the Bpy-1% device, and Vmax = 0.886 V for the Tpy-0.2% device). A stabilized current density of 19.7 mA cm−2 and PCE of 17.3% for the control device are improved to 20.8 mA cm−2 and 18.6% for the Bpy-1% device, and 20.77 mA cm−2 and 18.4% for the Tpy-0.2% device, respectively.
In order to confirm the existence of additives in final films and investigate the interaction between additives and perovskite compositions, we measure the FTIR spectra for control, Bpy-1%, Bpy-4%, Bpy-10%, Bpy, Tpy-0.2%, Tpy-2%, Tpy-10, and Tpy samples (Fig. S10a and b). No distinguishable peaks are observed before and after addition of Bpy even with a high concentration of 10% (Fig. S10a), while characteristic peaks of Tpy can be seen in the spectrum of the Tpy-10% perovskite sample but the peak position shifts. For example, peaks at 732 cm−1 and 766 cm−1 in the spectrum of the Tpy sample are assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibrations of C–H in Tpy and are shifted to a lower wavenumber of 728 cm−1 and 759 cm−1 in the spectrum of the Tpy-10% sample, respectively, as displayed in Fig. S10c, which is attributed to the Lewis acid–base interaction between Tpy and PbI2. Additionally, several peaks in the range of 1400–1600 cm−1 from stretching vibrations of CC and CN in the spectrum of pure Tpy can also be found in the spectrum of the Tpy-10% sample but slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers as revealed in Fig. S10d. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to further study the interaction between additives and the perovskite. As shown in Fig. 3a, peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 in the spectrum of the Bpy-4% film are located at 138.0 eV and 142.8 eV, respectively, which are shifted by 0.1 eV towards lower binding energy as compared to 138.1 eV and 142.9 eV in the spectrum of the control film. Similarly, it is found from Fig. 3b that the Tpy-2% film shows a shift of 0.3 eV and 0.2 eV towards lower binding energy for Pb 4f7/2 (137.8 eV) and Pb 4f5/2 (142.7 eV) compared with the control film, respectively. The shift of Pb 4f peaks indicates that electron cloud density is increased and electron affinity is reduced after more electrons are accepted by Pb atoms through coordinating with Bpy or Tpy.Fig. 3c exhibits X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of control, Bpy-1%, Bpy-4%, Tpy-0.2%, and Tpy-2% films, and the peak intensity ratio in the (100) crystal plane is shown in Fig. 3d. Obviously, all films display characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 13.98°, 19.92°, 28.70°, 31.63°, 40.34°, and 42.88°, corresponding to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (220), and (221) crystal planes of the trigonal perovskite phase, respectively. This indicates that the crystal structure was not changed after incorporation of Bpy or Tpy additives. It is interesting that the amount of residual PbI2 is reduced after introduction of Bpy or Tpy additives. As presented in Fig. 3d, the (100) peak intensity of Bpy-1%, Bpy-4% and Tpy-0.2% is 1.51, 1.99, and 1.30 times higher than that of the control film, respectively. This signifies that both Bpy and Tpy additives can improve perovskite crystallinity, which is in good accordance with the increased grain size as revealed by the SEM results in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4a and b show top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of control, Bpy-1%, Bpy-4%, Tpy-0.2%, and Tpy-2% perovskite films deposited on mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO/glass. The perovskite grain size is estimated from Fig. 4a using Nano Measurer 1.2 software and exhibited in Fig. 4c. As for cross-sectional SEM, no evident morphological difference is observed for control, Bpy-1%, Bpy-4%, and Tpy-0.2% films except for a slightly increased thickness for the Bpy-4% film. However, a much coarser morphology is observed for Tpy-2% as shown in Fig. 4b. It is obviously seen from Fig. 4c that incorporation of additives has a pronounced influence on perovskite crystallization and the grain size. The average grain size is increased from ∼337 nm for the control film to ∼391 nm for Bpy-1% and then ∼452 nm for Bpy-4%. In the Tpy case, the average grain size is increased to ∼386 nm for Tpy-0.2% but significantly reduced to ∼175 nm for Tpy-2%. The grain size distribution demonstrates that the introduction of an appropriate amount of Bpy or Tpy is beneficial for increasing the grain size, which is consistent with improved crystallinity as confirmed by the XRD results (Fig. 3c and d). Obviously, the increased grain size and improved crystallinity are due to the suppressed crystallization rate as a result of the strong interaction between additives and the perovskite as revealed by FTIR (Fig. S10) and XPS (Fig. 3a and b) along with precursor photographs (Fig. S4).
To investigate the effect of additives on the light harvesting efficiency, UV-vis absorption spectra of control, Bpy-1%, Bpy-4%, Tpy-0.2%, and Tpy-2% perovskite films spin-coated on mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO/glass substrates are measured and shown in Fig. S11a and c. As illustrated in Fig. S11a, UV-vis absorbance is slightly increased for Bpy-1% and Bpy-4% films relative to the control film, which is attributed to the improved crystallinity and increased grain size as confirmed by XRD and SEM results (Fig. 3c and 4). The increased IPCE and Jsc could be partially ascribed to the slightly increased UV-vis absorbance. In contrast, almost similar absorbance is observed for Tpy-0.2% and Tpy-2% films as compared to the control film (Fig. S11c). In addition, the bandgap (Eg) was estimated by fitting the (αhυ)2 plot as a function of photon energy based on the Kubelka–Munk equation (Fig. S11b and d). The Egs of Bpy-1% and Bpy-4% films are calculated to be 1.55 eV, which are similar to that of the control film (Fig. S11b). This means that the incorporation of less than 4% Bpy additive hardly affects the bandgap of the perovskite film. Although the Eg of the control film is slightly increased from 1.55 eV to 1.56 eV after addition of Tpy-0.2% (Fig. S11d), this increasing rate is almost negligible. Thus, the band gap of the bulk perovskite is hardly affected by additives. Steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra are collected to study the effect of additives on carrier lifetimes and the interfacial charge extraction efficiency. Fig. 5 shows SSPL and TRPL spectra of perovskite films (control, Bpy-1%, Bpy-4%, Tpy-0.2% and Tpy-2%) deposited on non-conductive glass substrates, and the fit results are summarized in Table S5. The biexponential decay equation of I(t) = I0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) was used to fit TRPL curves, where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitude fraction for each decay component, I0 is a constant, and τ1 and τ2 represent fast and slow decay time constants, respectively. The average PL lifetime is calculated using the equation of τavg = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2). As illustrated in Fig. 5a and c, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% films show much improved PL intensity as compared to the control film, which is consistent with a significant enhancement in the average PL lifetime (τavg) from 124.14 ns for the control film to 253.58 ns for the Bpy-1% film and 223.68 ns for the Tpy-0.2% film (Fig. 5b and d). Except for the improved crystallinity and increased grain size, defect passivation is probably one of the important reasons for the increased carrier lifetimes when considering that Bpy and Tpy can interact with PbI2 in the perovskite composition because of their strong Lewis base properties. Significantly improved lifetimes at the optimal ratio should be responsible for the increased Voc and FF because of suppressed SRH non-radiative recombination. However, the τavg is reduced from 124.14 ns for the control film to 103.14 ns for the Bpy-4% film and 79.36 ns for Tpy-2%, respectively. This manifests that the amount of additive used for defect passivation is limited. For the Tpy-2% film, the reduced grain size and thereby increased grain boundaries could be responsible for the reduced lifetimes to some extent. Consequently, the overall performance is highly sensitive to the additive concentration. As shown in Fig. S12 and Table S5, slightly improved electron or hole extraction is achieved for Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2%, which is indicative of better interfaces formed by additive addition. Therefore, the improved charge extraction and carrier lifetime can lead to reduced bulk and interface non-radiative recombination, which eventually results in improved photovoltaic parameters as evidenced in Fig. 2a–d. However, slightly worse charge extraction is observed when the content of additives is much larger than the optimal ratio.
In order to gain further insight into the origin of the improved Voc and FF along with increased Jsc, we quantitatively evaluate the defect density of perovskite films with Bpy and Tpy additives using a sandwiched FTO/perovskite/Au device through the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. As shown in the typical dark J–V characteristics in Fig. 6, three regions are observed: (I) the ohmic region at low bias exhibiting a linear relationship between the current and electric field, (II) the trap-filled limit region at intermediate bias showing a steep increase in current, and (III) a trap-free space-charge limited-current (SCLC) region at high bias potential. In the trap-filled limit region, the trap density levels are continuously filled as the bias increases and all the traps are filled until trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). The trap density is calculated according to the equation of nt = (2εε0VTFL)/(eL2), where ε, ε0, L and e are the dielectric constants of the perovskite, the vacuum permittivity, the thickness of the perovskite film, and the elementary charge, respectively.VTFL values are obtained by fitting the dark J–V curves. The relationship of ε = (CgL)/(ε0A) is utilized to calculate the dielectric constant of the perovskites, where Cg is the geometrical capacitance of the perovskite layer, the permittivity of free space ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1, and A is the active areas of the FTO/perovskite/Au devices.Cg is obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of the FTO/perovskite/Au device. Table S6 illustrates the corresponding parameters for calculation and calculation results. The trap density is reduced from 1.47 × 1016 cm−3 for the control film to 0.81 × 1016 cm−3 for the Bpy-1% film and to 0.95 × 1016 cm−3 for Tpy-0.2%, which is in good agreement with the increased carrier lifetime. For a higher content of the additives (Bpy-4% and Tpy-2%), trap density is even higher than that of the control (Fig. 7f), which leads to lower Voc.
In Fig. 7, the crystallization process of perovskite films is schematically illustrated, where three states might exist: (I) the wet film state before dripping the antisolvent, where the perovskite composition, solvents and additives are dispersed relatively randomly, (II) the small grain size state after dripping the antisolvent, where DMSO or additives interact with the perovskite according to a specific ratio, and (III) the large grain size state after annealing, where DMSO will evaporate from the final film but additives still exist and strongly interact with the perovskite. There is little difference in the wet film state, but in the second state, Bpy or Tpy will interact with the perovskite competing with DMSO. In case of stronger interactions with bidentate or tridentate than DMSO, which is evidenced by FTIR and XPS, the crystal growth rate can slow down. Thus, larger grains are expected in the presence of Bpy or Tpy in the final state. Furthermore, Bpy or Tpy will stay in the annealed film and passivate the defects of the perovskite film surface (Fig. 7b), while relatively little passivation occurs in the control film due to less interaction with lower boiling point DMSO (Fig. 7a). Actually, similar defect passivation effects were reported, where it was proposed that additives with Lewis base properties can effectively passivate the vacancies created by under-coordinated Pb atoms.
Finally, we investigate the effect of additives on stability. Fig. 8a shows the thermal stability of unencapsulated control, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices heated at 85 °C in the dark in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. After aging for 192 h, the Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices maintained ∼77% and ∼81% of their original PCEs, respectively, while merely ∼57% of the initial PCE is retained for the control device. Additionally, Fig. 8b illustrates the photostability of unencapsulated control, Bpy-1%, and Tpy-0.2% devices exposed to one sun illumination at room temperature in a glovebox filled with nitrogen, where almost no degradation is observed for Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices, whereas the control device is degraded by 10% after 240 h. Moisture stability is also evaluated for unencapsulated control, Bpy-1%, and Tpy-0.2% devices exposed to a relative humidity (RH) range between 50 and 70% at room temperature in the dark (Fig. 8c). Compared with ∼51% degradation of the control device, Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices are degraded to ∼43% and ∼28%, respectively. As we mentioned in Introduction, it was reported that decomposition of perovskite films preferentially occurred at grain boundaries (GB) because a large number of defects especially deep energy level defects were mainly located at GBs during uncontrollable crystallization. Moreover, many defects could be produced by ion migration, and ion migration was demonstrated to be much faster at GBs than in the bulk. It was demonstrated that trap-assisted non-radiative recombination resulting from defects at GBs seriously degraded device stability. Consequently, the increased grain size and reduced trap state density should be mainly responsible for the improved stability for Bpy-1% and Tpy-0.2% devices as compared to the control device. Additionally, improved thermal stability could be partially ascribed to formation of 1D complexes in the final perovskite film because 1D perovskites were thought to have better thermodynamic stability than 3D perovskites.

In conclusion, we demonstrated a simple and effective grain growth modulating and defect passivation engineering through rationally tuning the coordination ability of additives from monodentate to tridentate ligands. After incorporation of Bpy and Tpy additives, the photovoltaic performance and stability were much improved. The grain size and crystallinity of perovskite films were increased and defect density was decreased in the presence of additives, which should be mainly responsible for the improved PCE and device operational stability. This work can provide important insight into simultaneous achievement of grain growth modulation and defect passivation through additive engineering in PSCs.


Formamidinium iodide (FAI; FA: NHCHNH3) was synthesized according to our previous reports. All the other materials were purchased from commercial sources and used as received without further purification.


FTO-coated glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) were etched with a laser and then ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol, respectively. After the substrates were further treated with UV ozone for 20 min, a TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2) was fabricated by repeatedly spin coating a solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma-Aldrich, 75 wt% in isopropanol) in 1-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) on the FTO-coated glass at 2000 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 125 °C for 5 min, which was repeated three times. A mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer was prepared by spin coating a diluted TiO2 paste (50 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles, terpineol, ethylcellulose and lauric acid with a nominal composition of 1.25:6:0.9:0.1 in wt%) in anhydrous 1-butanol (0.1 g mL−1) on top of the bl-TiO2 layer at 2000 rpm for 20 s, which was annealed at 125 °C for 5 min and then annealed at 550 °C for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mp-TiO2 film was treated with UVO for 20 min and then treated with 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) solution at 90 °C for 10 min. The TiCl4-treated film was repeatedly cleaned with deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The mp-TiO2 film was exposed again to UVO for 20 min before depositing the perovskite film. 1.5 M FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FAI (0.2269 g), CsI (0.0468 g, Alpha Aesar, 99.99%), PbI2 (0.6639 g, Alpha Aesar, 99.9985%), and PbCl2 (0.0167 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) in DMSO (0.106 mL, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and DMF (0.894 mL, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), where the concentration of the precursor solution was calculated according to the content of Pb2+, and the molar ratio of DMSO/Pb2+ is 1:1. For additive-containing perovskite precursor solutions, different molar ratios of additives were added to the above prepared 1.5 M FA0.88Cs0.12PbI3 perovskite precursor solution: 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 4% for pyridine (Py) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% for 2,2′-bipyridine (Bpy) (Alpha Aesar, 98%), and 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% for 2,2':6′,2′′-terpyridine (Tpy) (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), respectively. The ratio of additives is calculated according to the molar ratio of additive to perovskite. Before depositing perovskite films, HI solution (57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) was added to the perovskite precursor solution, where volume (precursor):volume (HI) = 50:1. Perovskite films were prepared by spin coating the as-prepared precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 25 s where 500 μL diethyl ether was poured onto films at 10 s after spinning and then the films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 20 μL of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) solution was spin coated on the as-prepared perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by mixing 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD (Merck), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (t-BP) and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) stock solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, an Au electrode was thermally evaporated on the spiro-MeOTAD-coated perovskite film at an evaporation rate of 0.3 Å s−1.


UV–visible spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin Elmer). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected with a field-emission SEM (JSM7000F). ATR-FTIR spectra were measured with a Bruker IFS-66/S (TENSOR27). Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus Tau C11367-12, HAMAMATSU) with the excitation of a 464 nm laser (PLP-10, HAMAMATSU) pulsed at a frequency of 10 MHz for state–state PL and 500 kHz for time-resolved PL. Time-resolved PL was detected using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique to measure the spontaneous photoluminescence decay. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker AXS (D8 Advance, Bruker Corporation) using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on an ESCALAB 250 XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Al Kα X-ray radiation (1486.6 eV). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279 NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell covered with a KG-5 filter. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.125 cm2 was applied on top of the cell. The IPCE spectra measurements were carried out on an IPCE system (PV measurements) under DC mode, where the monochromatic beam was supplied with a 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO). Impedance spectra were measured in the dark using an Autolab 302B in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz.
