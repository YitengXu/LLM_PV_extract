Recently, there have been rapid advances in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells based on dopant-free contacts. However, there is no better choice to achieve flexible energy band alignment than to choose different materials. Here, Zn(O,S) materials, whose energy band structure can be flexibly tuned by a continuously adjustable ratio of S/Zn, combined with a low work function Mg layer, contribute a novel electron-selective contact (ESC) for Si-based dopant-free heterojunction solar cells. The tunability of the energy band structure of the ESC is confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, originating from the modulation of chemical composition by the change in oxygen partial pressure using reactive sputtering, which is linked to the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface properties and the corresponding solar cell device performances. Zn(O,S) films with a high ratio of S/Zn present a small conduction band offset (CBO) and a large valence band offset (VBO) at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface, which reduces minority carrier recombination and favors majority carrier transport, and then contributes to an absolute efficiency gain of 1.9% compared with the reference cell. In contrast, the Zn(O,S) films with a low ratio of S/Zn present a large CBO at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface, which makes the solar cell J–V curve exhibit an anomalous S-shape with a degraded fill factor (FF). A similar J–V distortion trend is found in simulated results when the value of the CBO at the Si/Zn(O,S) interface goes from small to large. These results offer a concept of energy-band-tunable ESCs for constructing new dopant-free contacts to realize high-performance photovoltaic devices.

A lot of work has been done to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and reduce the production costs in the photovoltaic industry. The implementation of carrier selective contacts (CSCs) in solar cells is a promising approach. CSCs allow only one photo-generated carrier (electron or hole) to be transported, with high separation and collection efficiency. In general, CSCs are divided into two types. One is electron-selective contacts (ESCs) whose energy band possesses an obvious downward bending contributing to transporting electrons while blocking holes. The other is hole-selective contacts (HSCs) whose energy band possesses an obvious upward bending contributing to transporting holes while blocking electrons. Typically, CSCs are a conductive doped layer (e.g., n-type or p-type doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(n) or a-Si:H(p))) deposited on a passivation interlayer (e.g., intrinsic a-Si:H (a-Si:H(i)) or SiO2). A high-quality CSC not only extracts carriers efficiently but also provides excellent surface passivation. Therefore, the application of stack CSCs in silicon solar cells contributes to cell efficiency by high open-circuit voltage Voc due to excellent surface passivation and high fill factor (FF) resulting from the simplified current flow pattern. It was reported in 2017 that the highest efficiency of 26.6% (180.4 cm2: designated area) for a Si solar cell was obtained on a silicon heterojunction interdigitated back-contact (SHJ-IBC) geometry by using a-Si:H(i)/doped a-Si:H stack CSC. The highest efficiency of 25.7% was obtained on a silicon solar cell with a diffused front boron-doped emitter and tunnel SiO2/doped poly-Si ESCs at the rear reported in 2017. It is expected that solar cells based on stack CSCs can achieve ultrahigh efficiencies in the near future.

Despite the fact that CSCs with a tunnel SiO2 or intrinsic a-Si:H have achieved great success in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE), there is still a myriad of intrinsic challenges such as parasitic absorption, Auger recombination and other heavy doping effects. In addition, the complicated deposition process and expensive equipment increase the production costs. What's more, the use of pyrophoric silane and toxic boron/phosphorous gas during deposition of the a-Si:H layers also raises potential security issues, which limits the large-scale application of the SHJ technologies. In this context, it is imperative to develop dopant-free carrier-selective materials that can be deposited more safely, easily and economically.
Many carrier-selective materials have been implemented in c-Si, including transition metal oxides (TMOs), organic materials, fluorides and metal oxides. Especially, TMOs, such as molybdenum oxide (MoOx), tungsten oxide (WOx), and vanadium suboxide (VOx), have been investigated as hole-selective contacts for silicon solar cells. Sub-stoichiometric molybdenum oxides (MoOx, x < 3) with a bandgap of ∼3 eV, are integrated into the SHJ solar cells to substitute the a-Si:H(p) layers, resulting in clear optical gains with a PCE of 22.5%. Solar cells with a set of dopant-free asymmetric contacts (hole-selective contacts (MoOx) and electron selective contacts (lithium fluoride, LiFx) DASH cells) have achieved a high efficiency of 19.4% based on intrinsic a-Si:H(i). Subsequently, a protective titanium oxide (TiOx) interlayer between the a-Si:H(i) passivation layer and the low work function (WF) LiFx/Al electrode is introduced to improve the thermal stability of the electron selectivity, which helps to increase the efficiency up to 20.7%, the highest efficiency of DASH solar cells to date. What's more, a solar cell with the TiOx/LiFx electron-selective contacts architecture as a partial rear contact has achieved a PCE of 23.1%.
The materials mentioned above can be deposited by simple techniques to form full-area contacts with a suitable energy band tailored for either the front or rear side of a solar cell device. However, there is no better choice in the field of SHJ solar cells, than to choose different materials to reduce the conduction-band offset (CBO) of the ESCs/n-Si interface. By contrast, the electron affinities of the Zn(O,S) films and bandgaps of the CIGS absorb layers are separately determined by the sulfur-to-zinc and gallium-to-indium ratios in chalcopyrite solar cells. This characteristic of Zn(O,S) films may apply equally to silicon solar cells as it does to chalcopyrite solar cells.
Zn(O,S) films can be fabricated by reactive sputtering, chemical bath deposition, and other simple techniques. Furthermore, the energy band structure of Zn(O,S) films is closely related to the composition of the films, which can be easily adjusted during the preparation process. It is very meaningful for silicon solar cells that Zn(O,S) films with the most suitable band structure are applied as electron selective layers by optimizing the composition of the Zn(O,S) films. The carrier selectivity characteristics of the Zn(O,S) films are fully studied in chalcopyrite solar cells, but silicon solar cells with a full-area Zn(O,S) contact have not been fully investigated to date.
Inspired by the high-efficiency silicon solar cells with dopant-free carrier selective contacts, we develop new ESCs based on Zn(O,S) films, which are deposited by reactive sputtering from a ZnS target in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The reactively sputtered Zn(O,S) films are explored by considering the composition, surface topography, conductivity and energy band structure. Obviously, the composition of the reactively sputtered Zn(O,S) films is a function of the oxygen contents in the sputter gas. The key point is that the CBO can be tuned to an optimal value through modification of the sulfur-to-zinc ratio. A low-WF Mg metal layer (∼7 nm) is introduced between the Zn(O,S) film and the Ag electrode to achieve a downward energy band to enhance the efficiency of carrier separation and collection. Combining a low-WF Mg metal layer with the distinct energy band structure of the Zn(O,S) films, a new stack ESC is constructed and incorporated in the solar cells. The performances of the solar cells with the stack ESC are quite different due to the distinct band structure of the Zn(O,S) films. According to the performance of the solar cells and photoelectric measurement, the composition of the Zn(O,S) films corresponding to the most suitable energy band is determined. The relationships between the device parameters and the CBO at the n-Si/Zn(O,S) interface are discussed carefully. Finally, a Zn(O,S)/Mg bilayer electron-selective contact with a tunable energy band structure is developed for silicon heterojunction solar cells.

The Zn(O,S) films are deposited by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering from a ceramic ZnS target (60 mm, diameter) in mixed gas containing argon and oxygen with different proportions up to 1.0% (further details are listed in Table 1). The S/Zn ratio of the reactively sputtered Zn(O,S) films (listed in Table 1) is a function of the oxygen partial pressure in the sputter gas. The deposition rate drops sharply as the oxygen partial pressure increases (see Fig. S1, ESI) and the desired thickness is obtained by changing the deposition time.

To first quantify the energy band, Fig. 1 presents the measured optoelectronic properties of the Zn(O,S) films. Transmission and reflection spectra of the Zn(O,S) films (∼100 nm) deposited on Schott glass (AF 32® eco) are obtained with a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (see Fig. S2, ESI). Later, the optical bandgap Eg is fitted from the absorption spectrum calculated from the transmission and reflection spectra, as shown in Fig. 1a, and the values of Eg are listed in Table 1. The work function and valence band spectrum of the Zn(O,S) (∼10 nm) films deposited on polished c-Si wafers, as measured by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), are demonstrated in Fig. 1c and d. In this study, ultraviolet light with 340 nm is used as the excitation source, and the fluorescence emission spectra of the Zn(O,S) films are examined in the wavelength range of 320–570 nm. The PL spectra, as shown in Fig. 1b, clearly show the characteristic blue emission peak of bulk ZnS at around 2.9 eV (427 nm) for sample 1 and sample 2. While for the other Zn(O,S) films (sample 3–sample 5) deposited at high oxygen contents, a remarkable enhancement in intensity for the 2.4–3.6 eV (340–510 nm) region is observed with peaks at 413 nm (sample 3) and 387 nm (sample 4, sample 5) indicating that a blue shift is introduced in the luminescence peak following the formation of the Zn(O,S) films, which is good agreement with the results of UV-VIS analysis. It is difficult to find out the exact contributory factor behind the peak shift. Vacancies, interstitial ions in the Zn(O,S) films and the possibility of oxidation in the process of deposition may contribute to peak shift. Because the PL emission is the result of the recombination of excited electrons and holes, the lower PL intensity of the sample indicates a lower radiative recombination rate. As shown in Fig. 1d, a significant increase in CBO can be expected for the Zn(O,S) films deposited at high oxygen contents (sample 4 and sample 5), showing a large CBO (listed in Table 1). Hence, they should present a large impediment to electron flow. While for the Zn(O,S) films deposited at the oxygen content of 0.3%, a rather low CBO (0.05 eV) is achieved at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface, which is smaller than the CBO of the TiO2/n-Si interface, so that they should present the smallest impediment to electron flow. A large valence band offset (VBO) over 2.6 eV between crystalline silicon and Zn(O,S) films is extracted from all samples, which provides a large barrier that prevents holes in the silicon valence band from flowing to the metal cathode and contributes to reduced dark current and increased open circuit voltage.
A suitable energy band structure of the silicon heterojunction solar cell is beneficial to transport and separate photo-generated carriers. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the energy band of the solar cells to improve PCE. It's confirmed that the VBM and the CBM can be tuned by controlling the chemical composition of Zn(O,S) films. Therefore, XPS analyses are performed to investigate the chemical composition and element chemical states of the Zn(O,S) films. All the measured spectra are calibrated in energy at the binding energy (BE) of C 1s, 284.6 eV, in order to adjust the surface charging effects. The evolution of XPS spectra under different oxygen contents is shown in Fig. 2. A high-resolution XPS spectra of the Zn 2p3/2 region for the five samples, together with the corresponding optimal fit are demonstrated in Fig. 2a. The BE of Zn 2p3/2 at ∼1021.6 eV is associated with ZnO or ZnS. It must be noted that the identification of the Zn–S bond becomes especially difficult in the presence of ZnO. Because the BEs of these two compounds are very close to each other (ZnO and ZnS are normally found at around 1021.5–1022.5 eV and 1022.0–1022.5 eV, respectively). The data collected from another three samples (sample 3–sample 5) can be fitted corresponding to Zn–O or Zn–S (∼1021.6 eV) and fully oxidized ZnSO4 (∼1022.7 eV). Moreover, an enhancement in intensity for fully oxidized ZnSO4 is observed as the oxygen partial pressure increases. These results imply that oxidation occurs when the Zn(O,S) films are deposited at the high oxygen partial pressure.
The most common chemical states of sulfur are 2−, 0, 4+, and 6+, and the chemical BE of these species can be found in the NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Database. The data collected from samples can be fitted with two doublets, which can be assigned to the valence states 2− (BE (S 2p3/2) = 161.3 eV in pink) and 6+ (BE (S 2p3/2) = 168.6 eV in blue), as shown in Fig. 3b. The valence state 2− can be assigned to the ZnS, when the oxygen content is less than 0.3%. The signals of S6+ observed in sample 3–sample 5 are attributed to the formation of zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) during deposition at the high oxygen partial pressure. A very low peak centered at 168.6 eV is found in sample 2 deposited at the oxygen content of 0.3%, indicating the initiation of oxidation. As the oxygen partial pressure increases, the doublet attributed to the valence state 6+ dominates the XPS spectrum, coming from the ZnSO4 phase as strong XPS signals from Zn and O are recorded as shown in Fig. 2a and c, whereas the contributions coming from the valence state 2− is significantly reduced. The signal centered at ∼167.1 eV may be ascribed to not fully oxidized ZnSO3. Moreover, the decrease in the intensity of the ZnSO3 is observed as the oxygen contents increase. Experimentally, the formation of zinc sulfite (ZnSO3) or zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) would be favorable in a ZnO–ZnS system because sulfur and oxygen have high reactivity.
The O 1s spectrum of the Zn(O,S) film can be deconvoluted into three peaks, at ∼529.7 eV, ∼531.4 eV and ∼532.0 eV respectively, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dominant peak centered at 529.7 eV (in blue) is assigned to the Zn–O bond. A significantly enhanced intensity is observed in the Zn(O,S) films deposited at the oxygen content of 0.3%, which drops sharply due to the formation of a large number of various oxides as the oxygen partial pressure increases. The peak around 531.4 eV (in pink) corresponds to the O2− ion in an oxygen-deficient sample including the sample 1 and sample 2. Combined with the above analysis, the presence of the Zn–O bond in the Zn(O,S) films deposited under the condition of low oxygen contents (0%, 0.3%) is confirmed, because the oxygen substituted the sulphur during the deposition. Therefore, a solid solution of ZnO and ZnS is formed. However, as oxygen contents increase, a peak (in green) slightly shifted to higher energy compared with sample 1 and sample 2, centered at 532.0 eV, is assigned to ZnSO4. The comparative analysis of the Zn 2p3/2 (Fig. 2a), S 2p (Fig. 2b), and O 1s (Fig. 2c) peaks reveals the presence of ZnSO4, ZnO, ZnSO3etc. when the Zn(O,S) films are deposited at high oxygen partial pressure. In contrast, a solid solution of ZnO and ZnS without oxidation is observed at low oxygen contents.
The performances of the solar cells are severely influenced by the surface topography of the Zn(O,S) films due to its effect on the growth of subsequent layers. In addition, the Zn(O,S) films with compact and low defect states are essential in high-efficiency solar cells. Fig. 3 shows the AFM morphology of the Zn(O,S) films deposited with different oxygen contents. A compact and homogeneous film is observed in Fig. 3a and b, indicating that the Zn(O,S) films deposited at low oxygen contents show better surface quality. However, as the oxygen partial pressure increases, a small density of isolated particles with very small sizes and irregular shapes are found in Fig. 3c and d. When the proportion of oxygen goes up to 1.0%, there is no formation of a homogenous and compact film on the substrate and a great number of large particles are contained in the films. The values of roughness are demonstrated in Fig. 3f. A slight increase in the surface roughness is noted as the oxygen contents increase. However, the significant increase in roughness observed is attributed to the process of severe oxidation when the proportion of oxygen is up to 1.0%.
The above systematic analysis has concerned the composition and chemical states of the Zn(O,S) films, and their effect on the energy band structure and morphology are carefully evaluated. Moreover, it's imperative for high quality CSCs to achieve a relatively low resistive loss. A schematic diagram for extracting conductivity measurements shown in Fig. 4a is used for elucidating the relationship between conductivity and the composition of the Zn(O,S) films. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Zn(O,S) films are deposited at different oxygen contents on glasses. Subsequently, a pair of coplanar Ag electrodes with the same length and width are covered on the Zn(O,S) films. The result is shown in Fig. 4b. A remarkable improvement in conductivity of the Zn(O,S) films is observed, reaching 2.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 when the proportion of oxygen is up to 0.3%, which is consistent with the other literature report. Compared with sample 1 (6.0 × 10−7 S cm−1) the conductivity is improved by nearly three orders of magnitude. During the deposition, oxygen can play an instrumental role in the stoichiometry and free electron concentration of Zn(O,S). Oxygen vacancies contribute to the conductivity of the Zn(O,S) films by changing the free carrier concentration. However, as the oxygen contents increase, a sharp decrease in the conductivity of the Zn(O,S) films is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 4b, caused by high resistivity oxides (ZnSO4, ZnSO3etc.) which are formed by the oxidation reaction during deposition.

To develop the Zn(O,S)-based ESCs, the Zn(O,S) films (∼10 nm) deposited in different oxygen contents are inserted between the rear side of the solar cells and an Mg metal layer (∼7 nm) used to enhance the electron transport properties. 10 nm ZnS films are determined by the previous study. We adopt the optimized thickness because the composition of the Zn(O,S) films is adjusted by changing the oxygen content in the sputter gas from 0 to 1% using reactive sputtering. For the textured front side, a typical diffused homojunction is formed, which is covered by SiNx and front fingers Ag electrodes. The device geometry is shown in Fig. 5a. Further details can be found in the ESI. A reference cell (Dev. 1) with direct Si/Mg contact at the rear side is fabricated for comparison. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of silicon solar cells with the Zn(O,S)-based electron-selective contact measured under standard 1 sun conditions (25 °C, 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G spectrum), are shown in Fig. 5b and the photovoltaic parameters of champion devices are summarized in Table 2. The reference cell without the Zn(O,S)-based contact shows a low efficiency (η) of 14.2%, which is mainly limited by a low Voc (535.7 mV) as well as FF (75.2%) caused by high carrier recombination at the Mg/Si interface. The efficiency of Dev. 2. with the Zn(O,S) film deposited at the oxygen content of 0% is significantly improved to 15.5%. All the solar cell parameters, especially the Voc (from 535.7 mV to 553.8 mV) and FF (from 75.2% to 78.3%) are improved obviously. It is proven that the ZnS film is an effective electron selective contact in favor of electron transportation. Further efficiency improvement is achieved by inserting the Zn(O,S) films deposited at an oxygen content of 0.3%, due to the rather low CBO (0.05 eV) at the n-Si/Zn(O,S) interface. The champion solar cell featuring a full-area Zn(O,S)/Mg bilayer contact exhibits a relatively high Voc of 565.8 mV, a Jsc of 35.7 mA cm−2 and an FF of 79.5%, achieving an efficiency of 16.1% that represents an absolute efficiency gain of 1.9% compared with the reference cell. However, distortion to the J–V curves is observed in Dev. 5 and Dev. 6, because a large barrier at the Si/Zn(O,S) interface prevents the electrons from transporting across it. The large barrier is caused by the conduction-band offset (CBO), whose magnitude is determined by the oxygen fraction in Zn(O,S), in line with the band structure discussed above.

By contrast, without the low WF metal layer, a significant degradation of performance is observed (see Fig. S3, ESI) for all devices. The low WF metal layer optimizes the rear interface energy band structure i.e., from upward to downward bending, which reduces minority carrier recombination and favors majority carrier transport. In addition, it's expected that the performance of the solar cells will be further improved if the intrinsic a-Si:H(i) layer is used for passivating the surface of silicon.

Fig. 5c shows the dark I–V characteristics of devices with and without the Zn(O,S)-based contact. All the devices exhibit diode properties clearly. The device with Zn(O,S) deposited at low oxygen contents exhibits much better diode properties, with a lower saturation current density and higher rectification ratio in comparison to the reference device. This suggests a reduction of the series resistance and interfacial recombination, and an increase in the shunt resistance for the solar cells with the Zn(O,S)-based contacts, consistent with the improved cell parameters shown in Table 2. In contrast, Dev. 5 and Dev. 6 demonstrate a higher saturation current density and lower rectification ratio in comparison to the reference device, due to a large conduction band offsets at the n-Si/Zn(O,S) interface in line with the distorted J–V curve discussed above. However, there is no significant difference in the EQE spectra for all devices as shown in Fig. 5d.
Photovoltaic parameters of Dev. 1–Dev. 6 are summarized in Fig. 6. Comparing the value of Suns-Voc with Voc, it's easy to find that the value of Suns-Voc is equal to the Voc for Dev. 1–Dev. 4. However, the value of Suns-Voc is much higher than Voc of Dev. 5 and Dev. 6. This is due to the value of Suns-Voc being extracted by excluding the influence of series resistance. For Dev. 1–Dev. 4, the negligible series resistance has a little influence on the open-circuit voltage and fill factor. But for Dev. 5 and Dev. 6, the series resistance is too high to be neglected. That is why pFF and FF are different. As for the short circuit current density, all the devices reached up to around 35 mA cm−2. Finally, an efficiency of 16.1% has been demonstrated by the inclusion of a full-area Zn(O,S)-based contact.

To illuminate the impact of the band offset at the Zn(O,S)/Si interface on the solar cells, a numerical simulation is operated under the platform of AFORS-HET (an open source heterojunction software) with other parameters fixed. The simulation details are listed in Table S1 (ESI). The band alignment at the rear of the solar cells with and without the Zn(O,S)-based contacts are shown in Fig. 7 simulated by AFORSE-HET. The low WF Mg metal films function as a back surface field material resulting in a downward energy band bending corresponding to an electron accumulation layer at the Si interface, which greatly mitigates the impact of barriers on the majority electron conduction clearly seen in Fig. 7. A large VBO and a different CBO are observed at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface, which make a great difference to the performance of the silicon solar cells. It can be clearly understood with the solar cell J–V curves shown in Fig. 8. Corresponding cell parameters are listed in Table 3. The reference cell demonstrates a relatively low efficiency (η) of 22.1% limited by a low Voc (698.3 mV) as well as low Jsc (37.4 mA cm−2) simulated by AFORSE-HET as shown in Fig. 8 due to the high carrier recombination at the Mg/Si interface. The downward energy band bending is not influenced by inserting the Zn(O,S) film (∼10 nm). A large VBO at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface provides a large barrier that blocks the dark-current contribution of holes, thereby increasing the open circuit voltage. However, the CBO at the Zn(O,S)/Si interface should be taken into account, because the value of the CBO can play a significant role in the performance of the solar cells. Furthermore, when the CBO is lower than 0.4 eV, there's a positive effect on the performance of the solar cells. As shown in Fig. 8, a high Voc (over 720 mV) as well as a high FF (over 84%) have been achieved in the solar cells with the Zn(O,S) films deposited at an oxygen content of 0%, 0.3% and 0.5%. In addition, with the decrease in CBO, FF gradually increases. A rather high FF (85.1%) is achieved in the solar cells (Dev. 3 and Dev. 4) with the CBO lower than 0.1 eV due to the little influence in the transportation of electrons. Finally, the same high simulated efficiency of 24.2% has been achieved for both Dev. 3 and Dev. 4. This result may be attributed to some parameters which were not being considered during the simulation such as conductivity, carrier concentration, and electron/hole mobility etc. as the oxygen contents increase. The large efficiency difference between the experiment and simulation results may be ascribed to the high recombination, caused by the lack of a passivation layer, such SiO2 at the rear surface. But the simulation results show a similar variation trend to the experimental data. In contrast, as the CBO is higher than 0.4 eV, there's a negative effect on the performance of the solar cells, because the large barrier limits the current flow, resulting in a rather low FF, which is confirmed by means of numerical simulations. This makes the solar cell J–V curves present an obvious S-shape which is consistent with the experimental results.

In summary, Zn(O,S)/Mg bilayer electron-selective contacts with tunable energy band structure are developed for silicon heterojunction solar cells. The distinct energy band structure of the Zn(O,S) films plays a key role in the performance of the silicon solar cells. In particular, the Zn(O,S) films deposited at low oxygen partial pressure demonstrated a low (0.05 eV) CBO and a large VBO (over 2.6 eV) at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface contributing to the reduction of minority carrier recombination and favoring majority carrier transport. An absolute efficiency gain of 1.9% has been achieved on the n-type silicon solar cell with the optimal band structure of the Zn(O,S)/Mg bilayer contacts, compared with the reference cell. In contrast, the Zn(O,S) films deposited at high oxygen partial pressure demonstrated a rather high (0.63 eV) CBO at the Zn(O,S)/n-Si interface, which hinders the transportation of electrons and leads to an obvious S-shape of the J–V curve so that the solar cell shows a low efficiency. Simulation results confirm that a high CBO hinders the electron transport resulting in the J–V distortion curves, while a low CBO implies a reduced barrier for electrons contributing to a high fill factor showing a good compatibility with the experimental results. The solar cells based on the Zn(O,S)/Mg bilayer CSCs have a great potential to achieve a high efficiency of 24.2%. The continuously adjustable energy band structure of Zn(O,S) materials provides a new concept for carrier transport contacts in solar cells.
