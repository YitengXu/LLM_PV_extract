Here we demonstrate that the power conversion efficiency of a P3HT:PC61BM bulk heterojunction solar cell can be improved from 3.4% to 4.3% by adding 10% of a cyclopent[hi]aceanthrylene derivative (CPA), which is an ambipolar small-molecule semiconductor, to form a ternary blend BHJ solar cell. This enhanced power conversion efficiency arises from improvement of both short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage because the addition of CPA not only provides absorption complementary to that of P3HT, but also leads to longer charge carrier lifetime in the bulk heterojunction.

The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has been widely investigated as a benchmark organic photovoltaic (OPV) structure, which led to power conversion efficiency certified as 3.5% to 4%, although a broader range of efficiency of 3% to 5% was reported in the literature. The efficiency of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ solar cells was improved by various strategies, such as increasing the regioregularity of P3HT, optimizing the annealing temperature as well as the molecular weight of P3HT, slowing down the drying kinetics of the wet films, using processing additives to support phase separation between P3HT and PC61BM. Here we demonstrate that the power conversion efficiency of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ solar cells can be improved from 3.4% to 4.3% by adding an ambipolar small-molecule semiconductor as the third component. The efficiency of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ solar cell is mainly limited by two issues. First, P3HT:PC61BM solar cells exhibit small open-circuit voltage (VOC) because the large difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of P3HT and PC61BM results in unnecessary dissociation energy. Second, P3HT as a film absorbs light of wavelength up to about 650 nm, thereby unable to cover a significant cross-section of the full solar radiation spectrum. To circumvent these two hurdles, donor polymers with a deeper energy level of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and a narrower HOMO–LUMO gap were used to replace P3HT. A less-explored alternative approach to more efficient solar cells is blending P3HT and PC61BM with another organic semiconductor, which acts as steps along an energy cascade to assist charge transfer between the electron-donating P3HT and the electron-accepting PC61BM. The reported cascade materials include polymers and small molecules, which operate as donors or acceptors or both donors and acceptors in the ternary BHJ structures. The resulting ternary BHJ solar cells can achieve higher power conversion efficiency, because the cascade material can provide complementary absorption and improve open-current voltage (VOC). The cascade material explored here is a cyclopent[hi]aceanthrylene derivative, CPA, (shown in Fig. 1), whose π-backbone, similar to fullerenes, contains cyclopentadiene rings as the electron-accepting moieties.

We considered CPA as a suitable cascade material with P3HT and PC61BM in view of two reasons. First, CPA has its HOMO energy level at −5.3 eV and its LUMO energy level at −3.7 eV, and was reported as an ambipolar semiconductor with field effect mobility of about 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both hole and electron. These properties can in principle allow it to function as a cascade material between P3HT and PC61BM as shown in Fig. 2. Second, the film of CPA absorbs light in a wide range of 350 nm to near 800 nm, and thus can complement P3HT by absorbing light of wavelength longer than 650 nm. Detailed below are the fabrication and characterization of ternary BHJ solar cells of P3HT:CPA:PC61BM and a study on transient photo-voltage, which assists to better understand the role of CPA in enhancing the open-circuit voltage.

Before being applied in the ternary BHJ solar cells with P3HT and PC61BM, the properties of CPA as an acceptor were tested in vacuum-deposited thin films and in bi-layer solar cells with P3HT. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption spectrum of CPA in thin films shows an absorption edge at about 780 nm, which corresponds to an optical band gap of 1.6 eV. The absorption of CPA compensates that of P3HT in both short-wavelength (350–400 nm) and long-wavelength (650–800 nm) regions. As determined by ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis, the HOMO energy level of CPA is −5.3 eV. Based on this HOMO energy level and the optical band gap of 1.6 eV, the LUMO energy level of CPA is estimated as −3.7 eV. These energy levels are very close to those that are estimated from electrochemical potentials measured in solution. As summarized in Fig. 2, the HOMO energy level of CPA is just positioned between those of P3HT and PC61BM, and the LUMO energy level of CPA is also positioned between those of P3HT and PC61BM. Such properly aligned HOMO and LUMO energy levels are expected to allow separated electrons and holes to transport along the energy cascades.

To test whether P3HT and CPA can be used as a donor–acceptor pair for OPVs, steady-state fluorescence quenching of P3HT with CPA in 100 nm films on quartz substrates was studied. As shown in Fig. 4a, the photoluminescence of P3HT is remarkably reduced upon the introduction of CPA, and CPA is as effective as PCBM in quenching the fluorescence of P3HT. This indicates that efficient charge transfer occurs along the interface between P3HT and CPA. Bi-layer solar cells with PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) as the anode buffer layer and BCP (10 nm) as the cathode buffer layer were fabricated by vacuum-depositing CPA onto a spin-coated 50 nm-thick film of P3HT as illustrated in the insert to Fig. 4b. Under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2, the resulting bi-layer solar cell exhibited J–V characteristic as shown in Fig. 4 with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 1.85 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.35, leading to an energy conversion efficiency of 0.63%, which is almost 4 times larger than the reported efficiency of bilayer solar cells of P3HT/C60 fabricated with similar processes. Although CPA exhibited promising performance in the bi-layered solar cell, the BHJ solar cell of P3HT:CPA as fabricated by spin-coating a blend of P3HT and CPA appeared even less efficient because easy crystallization of CPA from the blend resulted in a poor microphase separation.

Ternary blend BHJ solar cells were fabricated by utilizing a blend of P3HT:PC61BM:CPA as the photoactive layer with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PSS) (40 nm)/active layer (120 nm)/LiF (1.5 nm)/Al (100 nm). To control the morphology of active layer for reducing resistance, dichlorobenzene (DCB) containing 3% (volume percentage) of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as the solvent for spin-coating the blend films of P3HT:PC61BM:CPA. One key factor that affects the performance of ternary blend solar cells is the weight ratio of three active components as indicated by the early studies on ternary blend solar cells. In this study, the weight ratio of P3HT, PC61BM and CPA was optimized in two aspects. First, the ratio of PC61BM to CPA was varied, while the ratio of P3HT to the total acceptors (PC61BM and CPA) was fixed at 1:1. Second, the ratio of P3HT to CPA was varied, while the ratio of P3HT to PC61BM was fixed at 1:1. It is found that a high ratio of CPA relative to P3HT results in unfavourable agglomerates as observed with AFM and thus leads to very poor performance, in agreement with that the BHJ binary solar cell of P3HT:CPA exhibits poor microphase separation and device performance. Therefore the ratio of CPA to P3HT was kept as 0.2:1 or lower in the optimization of weight ratio. Summarized in Table 1 are the photovoltaic characteristics for ternary BHJ solar cells of P3HT:PC61BM:CPA with weight ratios of 1:0.8:0.2, 1:0.9:0.1, 1:1:0.1 and 1:1:0.2, along with those of the binary BHJ solar cell of P3HT:PC61BM fabricated with the same method as a reference. For comparison, the five devices were all tested under the same simulated AM 1.5 G 100 mW illumination, and the resulting J–V characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 5a. It is found that a weight ratio of 1:0.9:0.1 for P3HT:PC61BM:CPA leads to the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE, or denoted as η) of 4.3%, while the reference P3HT:PC61BM solar cell exhibits a PCE of 3.4%. In comparison with the reference P3HT:PC61BM solar cell, this ternary BHJ solar cell improves both short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) and keeps the fill factor (FF) almost unchanged. Another finding from Table 1 is that the ternary BHJ solar cells generally exhibit higher VOC, which can be attributed to the larger difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of CPA along with a longer charge carrier lifetime as discussed in the latter part of this article. Shown in Fig. 5b is external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength for the most efficient solar cell P3HT:PC61BM:CPA (1:0.9:0.1) in comparison with that of the reference P3HT:PC61BM (1:1) solar cell. Based on this comparison, the EQE is improved in both short-wavelength (350–400 nm) and long-wavelength (650–800 nm) regions, although the absorption in the long-wavelength region makes less contribution. The enhanced JSC can thus be attributed to the improved EQE.

In order to illustrate the dependence of photovoltaic performance on the ratio of three components, the surface morphologies of the P3HT:PC61BM (1:1) binary film and P3HT:PC61BM:CPA ternary films with the four different ratios (1:0.8:0.2, 1:0.9:0.1, 1:1:0.1, 1:1:0.2) were investigated with AFM. As shown in Fig. 6, the ternary films exhibits morphologies different from that of the P3HT:PC61BM (1:1) binary film. When the ratio of CPA to P3HT is as large as 0.2:1, the ternary films contain micron-scaled agglomerates, which are likely formed by the aggregation of easily crystallized CPA molecules. Such morphology involves poor microphase separation and thus impairs exciton separation and charge transport in the photoactive layer leading to inferior JSC. In contrast, with a lower ratio of CPA to P3HT (0.1:1), the ternary films exhibit a smoother morphology with much less agglomerates, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. Such morphology likely involves smaller crystallites of CPA leading to more interfaces between P3HT and CPA domains, where the separation of excitons occurs. Therefore, the dependence of photovoltaic performance on the percentage of CPA in the ternary BHJ can be explained in terms of film morphology, which is related to the crystallization of CPA in the blend. However, the lower efficiency of the P3HT:PC61BM:CPA (1:1:0.1) ternary film cannot be attributed to its morphology, which is very similar to that of the P3HT:PC61BM:CPA (1:0.9:0.1) ternary film. A possible reason is that the donor–acceptor ratio in the P3HT:PC61BM:CPA (1:1:0.1) ternary film deviates from the optimum.


To better understand the role of CPA in enhancing the open-circuit voltage (VOC), the transient photo-voltage was studied, because the VOC is not only correlated to the energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials of BHJ solar cells, but also depends on the lifetime of charge carriers within the blend. As shown in Fig. 7, the transient photo-voltage in the binary blend film of P3HT:PC61BM (1:1) quickly reaches a plateau within 5 × 10−3 ms, while the transient photo-voltage in the ternary blend film of P3HT:PC61BM:CPA (1:0.9:0.1) reaches a plateau within about 4 × 10−2 ms. From these results, the value of charge carrier lifetime τ (in verse of k, a general recombination rate coefficient) is estimated as 5 × 10−3 ms for the binary blend film of P3HT:PC61BM (1:1) and 4 × 10−2 ms for the ternary blend film of P3HT:PC61BM:CPA (1:0.9:0.1). According to the equation of Durrant, the VOC of BHJ solar cells increases with the increase of charge carrier lifetime. Therefore, the enhancement of VOC in the ternary blend BHJ solar cell of P3HT:PC61BM:CPA can be attributed, at least partially, to the longer charge carrier lifetime in it.


Synthesis of 2,7-bis((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)cyclopenta-[hi]aceanthrylene (CPA): to a mixture of 384 mg (1 mmol) of 2,7-dibromocyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene, 70 mg (0.1 mmol) of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride and 52 mg (0.2 mmol) of triphenylphosphine in round-bottom flask under a N2 atmosphere were injected 0.57 mL (4 mmol) of trimethylsilylacetylene, 10 mL of toluene and 1.12 mL (8 mmol) of triethylamine. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours, and then concentrated under a reduced pressure. The resulting residue was filtered through a short pad of silica gel in a fritted glass funnel and washed with CH2Cl2. The green filtrate was concentrated under a reduced pressure and then purified with column chromatography on silica gel with hexane/CH2Cl2 4/1 (v/v) as eluent, yielding 272 mg (65%) of CPA as dark-green crystalline powders. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra are the same as reported earlier.

Organic solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (120 nm)/LiF (1.5 nm)/Al (100 nm). A glass substrate with a pre-patterned ITO (active layer area of 0.12 cm2) was ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, CMOS-grade acetone and isopropanol for 15 minutes successively. The surface of ITO was then treated with UV-ozone for 1.5 minutes. A blend of PEDOT:PSS, as hole injection layer, was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 55 seconds to a thickness of 30–40 nm on the cleaned ITO-patterned glass substrate, followed by baking at 145 °C for 15 minutes in air. Mixed solutions of P3HT, CPA and PC61BM in a solvent of dichlorobenzene containing 3% of 1,8-diiodooctane by volume were prepared by fixing the concentration of P3HT at 20 mg ml−1 and varying the weight ratio of the three materials as mentioned above. Such solutions were spin-cast onto the top of a PEDOT:PSS layer to form the active layer, which had a thickness of about 120 nm, and was then annealed at 130 °C for 10 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently, a thin LiF layer (1.5 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under a pressure 2 × 10−5 Pa. Finally, a 100 nm-thick film of Al was vacuum-deposited onto the top of the device to form the cathode. The thickness of organic layers was measured with atomic force microscope (AFM), while the thickness of LiF and Al was measured with a quartz crystal microbalance during the vacuum deposition.
The J–V characteristics were characterized using a Keithley 236 source measure unit in combination with a Newport Oriel 91160 solar simulator. The EQE was measured using a photo-modulation spectroscopic setup (model Merlin, Oriel), a calibrated Si UV detector, and a SR570 low noise current amplifier. UV-visible (Varian CARY 1E) and Photoluminescence (FR 650, JASCO) measurements were applied to analyze the optical properties of the blend ternary photoactive layers. Atomic force microscope (AFM) was operated in tapping mode to acquire images of the surfaces of blend ternary photoactive layers. For the transient photo-voltage measurement, a green LED (λ = 532 nm) driven by a function generator was used as the triggering light source to provide square-wave modulated illumination, which resulted in a small perturbation voltage ΔV in addition to VOC. The transient decay of ΔV was then recorded by a HP oscilloscope.

In summary, we have improved the power conversion efficiency of P3HT:PC61BM BHJ solar cell from 3.4% to 4.3% by adding 10% of CPA, an ambipolar small-molecule semiconductor, to form a ternary blend BHJ solar cell. This enhanced power conversion efficiency is accompanied with an increase in JSC from 8.95 mA cm−2 up to 9.33 mA cm−2 and an increase in VOC from 0.58 V to 0.7 V. Such improvement is attributed to the addition of the cascade material CPA, which not only provides absorption complementary to that of P3HT-PC61BM but also leads to longer charge carrier lifetime in the BHJ.
