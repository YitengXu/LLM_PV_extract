An electric field assisted spray deposition method is employed for improving the perovskite film morphology, crystallinity, and surface coverage, and for further fabricating an efficient solar cell. By applying different voltages ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 kV during spray deposition, we observed a large variation in the film morphology and surface coverage compared to those fabricated without an electric field, which is due to improved atomization from the Coulomb fission process. The optimized applied voltage of 1.5 kV during spraying led to completion of the reaction between CH3NH3I and PbI2 on a hot substrate for pure phase CH3NH3PbI3 thin film formation with improved grain growth and surface coverage. The cells fabricated using perovskite films showed clear applied voltage dependence in the energy conversion process and alleviation in J–V hysteresis; with 1.5 kV applied voltage the average cell efficiency of 8.9% was obtained compared to films fabricated without applying voltage providing only 6.5%. The best efficiencies are 10.9% and 7.37% for applied voltages of 1.5 kV and 0 kV, respectively. The enhancement in efficiency with applied voltage is due to the formation of more uniform and dense films with large perovskite crystals, which resulted in efficient electron transportation (enhanced photocurrent and modified series and shunt resistances) by minimizing the charge carrier recombination at grain boundaries (resulting in enhanced open circuit voltage). With further optimization of the perovskite film thickness by adjusting the CH3NH3I spray volume, the average cell efficiency of ∼11.0% was obtained.

Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl−, Br−, or I−) have recently emerged as promising light harvesting materials for photovoltaic devices due to strong absorption, bipolar transport and large charge carrier diffusion lengths. In a span of less than five years, perovskites have made rapid progress as solar cell materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) reached 17%, and Yang's group reported the highest PCE of 19.3% based on a planar device architecture using mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) materials. Recently, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) has established a new world record efficiency for PSC, with a certified PCE of 21.0%. Indeed, PSCs are becoming highly promising next generation photovoltaic devices for harnessing solar energy with accelerated research and development. But, the PSCs exhibit hysteresis in I–V characteristics, possibly due to defect-assisted trapping, which has been identified as a critical roadblock to commercial viability of perovskite photovoltaic technology. Therefore, recent research work in this area concentrated on improving the perovskite film surface coverage by increasing the crystal size and enhancing the crystalline quality of the grains, which is expected to minimize the overall bulk defect density and alleviate hysteresis by suppressing generated charge carrier trapping during solar cell operation.

The morphology, crystallinity, thickness and surface coverage of perovskite thin films play a crucial role in obtaining high efficiency PCEs with less hysteresis. Various methods have been reported to obtain large crystals with uniform perovskite films such as solution processing, thermal evaporation, and spray coating for reduced charge carrier recombination and improved charge transport. A solvent engineering approach has also been investigated as a one step solution and two step sequential deposition technique to fabricate extremely uniform, and dense perovskite films with a large grain size for realization of high performance PSC devices. Liang et al. demonstrated an improvement in the surface coverage and film morphology of perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) by adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane to perovskite precursor solution, and also obtained a defect free perovskite crystal structure. On the other hand, a modified two-step sequential deposition method (solution–vapour) was also employed by first spin coating PbI2 followed by vapour deposition of CH3NH3I, and also the inter diffusion method like spin coating of a stack of PbI2 and CH3NH3I layers to obtain uniform, large-grain polycrystalline and pinhole-free perovskite films.
But, the above mentioned methods have a few disadvantages, such as wastage of precursor materials to some extent, reduced surface coverage by forming island like perovskite structures with pinholes, and also the formation of poor quality perovskite films due to incomplete conversion of the PbI2 precursor. These factors can affect the reproducibility of films, and also the above mentioned methods have limitations for large scale fabrication of PSCs. Evaporation based PSCs are going to be more expensive than solution processed cells in a commercial perspective, because of high processing cost and unsuitability for manufacturing on a large scale. To fabricate cost effective PSCs, recently Lidzey et al. have reported a simple ultra-sonic based spray deposition of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates under ambient conditions. Further, Linag et al. also reported the spray deposition of different concentrations of CH3NH3PbI3 solution on TiO2 coated FTO substrates. However, with the simple spray deposition technique, the disadvantages are small grain size and pin hole formation, and also impurity incorporation during film formation due to incomplete reaction on the substrate. So, the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films need to be improved for better electronic properties and for further enhancing the photovoltaic performance using the simple spray technique.
To address some of the above mentioned issues, we prepared perovskite films using an inexpensive and simple pneumatic spray deposition method assisted by an electric field. In the spraying process, the most important step is atomization, the crucial parameter is the size of precursor droplets generated at the nozzle and their dispersion over the substrate during the film formation. Apart from air-pressure for the droplet generation at the nozzle, an applied electric field can also play a major role in tuning the droplet size due to the Coulomb fission process, for improving the quality of perovskite films by having complete reaction. We fabricated PSCs by spray deposition of CH3NH3I on the top of spin coated PbI2 films, with and without an electric field under ambient conditions. We made an attempt to improve the crystallinity, crystal size and morphology of perovskite films, and also optimized the thickness by modifying the electric field during atomization and the amount of spray solution for achieving the best PCE from PSCs with minimum hysteresis.

Methylamine (CH3NH2) (40 wt% aqueous solution), hydroiodic acid (HI) (57 wt% in water), lead iodide (PbI2) (98% purity), and N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) were purchased from Alfa Aesar, and used as received. For the preparation of CH3NH3I, a method described in detail elsewhere is followed. By reacting 30 ml of HI with 30 ml of CH3NH2 at 0 °C for 2 h in a three-necked round bottom flask under a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere with constant stirring. The resultant solution was evaporated with a rotary evaporator to obtain a white precipitate, followed by washing with diethyl ether several times, and finally dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C. The obtained white crystalline powder was used for preparation of perovskite precursor solution.


Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates having resistivity of <15 Ω sq−1 were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol by ultrasonication treatment for 15 min each, and flushed with N2 gas for 10 min. A thin compact TiO2 layer (thickness of ∼70 nm) on FTO substrates was prepared by spin coating of titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) solution (1:39 volume ratio in ethanol) at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by drying at 125 °C for 5 min, and annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer (thickness ∼500 nm) composed of 20 nm sized particles was prepared by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NRT) diluted in ethanol (2:7 weight ratio). Then the films were dried at 125 °C for 5 min, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. The resultant films were subjected to TiCl4 (40 mM aqueous solution) treatment at 70 °C for 30 min, washed with deionized water and ethanol and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min again.

The deposition of the perovskite layer was made by using the electric field assisted spray technique inside a gas leak-proof spray chamber. The CH3NH3I spray solution was prepared in 2-propanol with a concentration of 8.0 mg ml−1, and the other optimized spray deposition parameters are the deposition temperature of ∼70 °C, the solution flow rate of ∼0.5 ml min−1, and the nozzle to substrate distance of 18.0 cm. The atomization of solution was made by N2 gas with a flow rate of 10 l min−1 and at a pressure of 1.5 kgf cm−1. Initially, PbI2 solution (1.25 M PbI2 in DMF) was spin coated on mesoporous TiO2 films with a spinning rate of 4000 rpm for 40 s followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. In the second step, CH3NH3I solution (100 μl) was sprayed on PbI2 films without and with different applied voltages. For electrostatic assisted spray deposition, an additional electric pressure on N2 gas generated droplets were produced by applying high voltage between the spray nozzle (+ve) and an annular metal electrode (−ve) placed beneath the nozzle at a distance of ∼4.0 mm as shown in Fig. 1. The deposition was carried out by spraying the CH3NH3I solution on PbI2 coated substrates, by applying D. C. voltages from 0.5 to 2.0 kV with an interval of 0.5 kV between the nozzle and metal electrode, by keeping all other spray parameters the same as mentioned above. During the spray deposition, the substrate temperature was kept at ∼70 °C, after the deposition the substrates were immediately transferred to a second hot plate and annealed at 85 °C for 45 min in order to improve the morphology of the perovskite films, all the steps were performed inside the spray chamber. The thickness of the perovskite films is about 350 nm.
The hole transporting layer (HTL) Spiro-MeOTAD of ∼200 nm thickness was deposited by spin coating on the perovskite layer at 4500 rpm for 30 s. The Spiro-MeOTAD solution contains a mixture of 72.3 mg of 2,2′7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorine, 28.8 μl of 4-tert butylpyridine, and 17.5 μl of lithium bis(tri-fluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (520 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) in 1.0 ml chlorobenzene. Finally, an ∼80 nm thin gold electrode was deposited using a DC sputtering system having a pressure of ∼2 × 10−6 mbar. The active area of each perovskite cell is 0.12 cm.

The crystal structure of perovskite films was examined by analysing the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded using a Rigaku UltimaIVX-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray tube (λ = 1.54056 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were acquired using a Carl Zeiss EVO-18 microscope to study the surface morphologies. The surface roughness factor of perovskite films was analyzed using a Bruker's Dimension icon atomic force microscope (AFM). Absorbance spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda (1050) UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of spray deposited perovskite films were recorded using a spectrometer from Edinburgh instruments with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm. The photovoltaic parameters were recorded by using a Keithley 2440 source meter under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) from an Oriel class 3A solar simulator. For the measurements, first the devices were allowed to stabilize (20 s), and then the cyclic J–V was swept toward forward bias and return at 150 mV s−1. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed by using a lock-in amplifier coupled with a monochromator from ReRa systems, The Netherlands, the light source was a 150 W xenon lamp with a chopped frequency of 20 Hz, in addition bias light of 10 mW was also applied during IPCE measurements.


The perovskite film preparation without and with the electric field assisted spray deposition method is schematically presented in Fig. 1, along with SEM micrographs, which shows the effect of the applied voltage on the perovskite film morphology. Usually, a normal spray deposition method (without electric field) generates a large droplet size, and it leads to slow evaporation of the solvent, resulting in the formation of voids in the film, and also an incomplete chemical reaction for obtaining the desired compound material. To minimize this, the electric field (pressure) was applied, in addition to gas pressure during atomization, which will lead to the formation of finer droplets of uniform size distribution, for the complete reaction between the chemical species on the hot substrate. The existing electric field at the nozzle will develop some type of polarization effect in the droplets, which will increase the droplet surface area for improving the rate of evaporation, and result in a better surface morphology of films. Application of an electric field also minimizes droplet coalescence before reaching the hot substrate due to the electrostatic repulsion between charged droplets. The isolated and fine charged droplets have an advantage of growing thin films with good optical and electronic properties. The distance between the nozzle and substrate also alters the morphology of the perovskite films. The optimized nozzle to substrate distance of 18.0 cm gives the best film morphology, for other distances a poor film morphology was observed, the distance dependent film morphologies are presented in Fig. S1 as in the ESI.

In Fig. 2, we present a set of SEM micrographs related to perovskite films that show the effect of the electric field during spray deposition on the surface morphology and coverage, except in Fig. 2(a) which shows the surface morphology of the spin coated PbI2 thin film having a flake like structure. After the spray deposition of CH3NH3I solution, one can see without applied voltage (Fig. 2b) and with 0.5 kV applied voltage (Fig. 2c) the formation of small size (∼100–150 nm) perovskite crystals, which is due to large sized CH3NH3I droplet generation at the nozzle with no/small (<1.0 kV) electric field, and these droplets can't diffuse into the PbI2 layer for the growth of large grains, leading to a poor crystallization and non-uniform perovskite films. With the increase in applied voltages to 1.0 kV and 1.5 kV, we observed the formation of well-ordered, large and uniform perovskite crystals (∼240–350 nm), with improved surface coverage in film formation. At a large applied voltage (≥1.0 kV), the atomization process improved by generating tiny CH3NH3I droplets through the process of Columb fission, which improves the diffusion of CH3NH3I into the PbI2 layer, leading to large sized (∼460 nm) perovskite crystal formation with the complete chemical reaction under optimized spraying conditions. However, with 2.0 kV applied voltage, we observed the perovskite films having unreacted CH3NH3I droplets, despite the large perovskite crystals. Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional SEM images of glass/FTO/TiO2 + CH3NH3PbI3 prepared at voltages of 0 kV and 1.5 kV. At an applied voltage of 1.5 kV, one can see the growth of the perovskite crystals, which are large sized and densely implanted in the mesoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. 3b). The extra perovskite material above TiO2 provides higher pore filling and also acts as a capping layer, where it acts as both light absorber and hole transporting layer. Thus the higher portion of the perovskite reduces the requirement of the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting layer.
The XRD patterns of the perovskite films prepared with different applied voltages from 0.5 to 2.0 kV are presented in Fig. 4. The diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈ 14.02°, 19.98°, 23.38°, 24.42°, 28.38°, 31.83°, 34.92°, 40.53°, and 43.08° are correspond to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), and (314) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase, respectively. The films prepared at applied voltages of 1.0 kV and 1.5 kV showed sharp and intense peaks from crystal planes of (110), (220) and (310), which indicates the formation of well oriented perovskite crystal phases with large grain sizes. Improved crystal structure formation also reflects the formation of fine CH3NH3I droplets at large applied voltages due to improved atomization for effective interdiffusion of CH3NH3I droplets into spin-coated PbI2 films. Even with a high applied voltage of 2.0 kV, we observed pure perovskite crystal formation without any evidence of unconverted PbI2. But the films prepared without voltage, and also with a small voltage of 0.5 kV resulted in some additional peaks (marked by *) at 2θ ≈ 12.65°, 12.65° and 12.65° along with the tetragonal perovskite phase, which matches well with the PbI2 crystal phase (Fig. 2a). At no/small applied voltage, due to larger droplet generation at the nozzle, the perovskite film formation is incomplete due to some unevaporated solvent during film deposition, leading to the presence of trace amounts of unconverted PbI2 crystals. So, these results clearly show that the applied electric field plays a prominent role in enhancing the crystallinity and morphology of perovskites with the complete reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I on the hot substrate along with other important spray parameters.

Fig. 5 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of perovskite films prepared with different applied voltages. The spectra show a broad range of absorption in the visible region of the spectrum having the absorption band edge around 784 nm (Eg ∼ 1.58 eV). The perovskite film prepared without an electric field shows relatively less absorption compared to films prepared with an electric field. It also may be due to an incomplete conversion of PbI2 (see Fig. 4), the resulting films remain pale yellow in colour. With the gradual increase of applied voltage during spraying, the colour of films turned dark brown, and led to the improvement of light absorption in the entire visible region due to the improved crystallinity and morphology of perovskite films. However, at a higher applied voltage (2.0 kV) the amount of light absorption is slightly decreased, which can be due to the modified surface roughness of the film due to the saturation of diffusion rate of CH3NH3I into PbI2 films by leaving the unreacted CH3NH3I material over the film (see Fig. 2f). The inset of Fig. 5 shows the PL spectra of perovskite films prepared without and with 1.5 kV voltage. The PL peak is observed around 780 nm, but we have not observed any enhancement in the PL intensity in spray deposition with an electric field except the uniform increase in the background. An enhanced background represents modification in surface roughness, which we have verified using AFM analysis. The root mean square surface roughness values of perovskite films are 37.6 nm and 76.4 nm for without and with 1.5 kV voltage, respectively. The AFM micrographs of perovskite films prepared at different applied voltages (0 to 2.0 kV) are presented in Fig. S2.
A series of PSCs are also fabricated using perovskite films prepared under different applied voltages to observe the photovoltaic performance of the device. The fabricated solar cell structure is FTO/bl-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD/Au having an active area of 0.12 cm2. It was reported that high efficiency PSCs suffer from the hysteresis effect, which depends on the scan direction, scan rate and TEBBing effect, all these effects create difficulty in determining the cell efficiency accurately. The original research paper on the hysteresis effect demonstrated the origin of traps, mobile ions and ferroelectric effects, along with the crystal size effect. Here, we also investigated the effect of hysteresis since the applied electric field during spraying strongly affects the crystal size. The cyclic J–V characteristics (forward and reverse scan directions) of PSCs fabricated at different applied voltages are presented in Fig. 6(a–e), and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The effect of the electric field on device performance is clearly observed. The device PCE improved with an applied voltage of 1.5 kV and for a higher applied voltage it started decreasing. The devices without an electric field showed a relatively poor performance due to an incomplete conversion of PbI2, which can affect the absorption and charge transportation hence, resulting in a lower short circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.64 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, a fill factor (FF) of 62.86%, and an average PCE of 6.5%. These devices exhibited a high hysteresis index (h-index) of 0.061 due to the smaller perovskite crystal size. The h-index values are calculated using the relation (eqn (1)) given by Kim et al. in ref. 29, they have observed the large J–V hysteresis for small sized perovskite crystals and explained that smaller crystals store capacitive charge, which will be released as the crystal size increases. We made a similar observation, as the applied increases the crystal increases, which alleviates the J–V hysteresis. The average PCE of 8.92% is observed for the cell prepared with a perovskite film deposited under an applied voltage of 1.5 kV, with a Jsc of 18.11 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.912 V, and a FF of 66.0%. The h-index of the device prepared at 1.5 kV is the lowest (0.034), which increases for lower and higher values of the applied voltage. With an applied voltage of 2.0 kV the average cell efficiency also decreased to 8.06%, because of unreacted CH3NH3I droplets, which can act as a thin insulating layer over perovskite films instead of the semiconducting layer. This insulating layer can hinder the charge transportation in a perovskite layer resulting either in accumulation or recombination near the perovskite layer, which is also reflected by the increasing series resistance and the decreasing shunt resistance of the device (Table 1).

To evaluate the reproducibility of device performance, ten such devices are fabricated at different applied voltages, the maximum number of devices showed an average PCE of 7–8%. For comparison, we also fabricated a device by the one step spin coating method, and the corresponding surface morphology of perovskite film is presented in Fig. S3, and the J–V graph and cell parameters are presented in Fig. S4. The cell from the spin coated perovskite film exhibited a poor performance compared to cells prepared from perovskite films under an electric field of 0.5 to 2.0 kV, due to non-uniform film formation and poor crystallization.
The applied electric field improves first the conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3, later the structure and morphology, which is clearly reflected in the device performance with improved electronic properties and charge transport. The increase in Jsc is attributed to the improvement in carrier mobility with an effective electron transportation, which originated from the improved crystallinity and grain sizes of the perovskite, and also the improved surface coverage. We also observed a decrease in series resistance and an increase in shunt resistance from PSCs with the applied electric field (see Table 1) during perovskite film preparation. The significant enhancement of open circuit voltage (∼60 mV) also clearly reflects the reduced charge carrier recombination at grain boundaries. With smaller applied voltages <1.0 kV, the poor quality crystalline perovskite thin films are obtained with less surface coverage, which clearly reflects the high series resistance and low shunt resistance, which led to poor cell performance. The EQE spectra as well as integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE data are presented in Fig. 6(f), to see the wavelength dependent photo-to-electron conversion. The improvement of EQE in a broad spectral response from 400 nm to 760 nm observed for an applied voltage of 1.5 kV. The spectral responses of all devices are in good correlation with the observed absorbance. The integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE data also correlated with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements, one can clearly see from Fig. 6(f) that the photocurrent density is nearly the same.
Based on the optimized applied voltage of 1.5 kV for perovskite film growth, we further explored the effect of film thickness on the device performance, the film thickness was controlled by varying the CH3NH3I spray solution volume. Three batches of PSCs are fabricated with volumes of 150, 250 and 350 μl spray solution, which resulted in film thicknesses of ∼240 nm, ∼320 and ∼390 nm, respectively. The J–V graphs of PSCs fabricated with different film thicknesses are presented in Fig. 7, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The average cell efficiency of 11.0% was obtained with 250 μl of CH3NH3I spray solution having a film thickness of 320 nm, with a Jsc of 19.38 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 V, and a FF of 63.45%. It is known that an optimized perovskite film thickness absorbs more light and generates higher photocurrent, but a large thickness loss of photovoltage can also occur mostly due to increased charge carrier recombination. With the increase in film thickness by increasing the volume of CH3NH3I to 350 μl, the photo-generated charge carriers cannot be extracted effectively from perovskite films due to limited diffusion lengths, which can decrease the device performance. With a lower volume (150 μl) of CH3NH3I, poor cell performance was observed due to insufficient CH3NH3I for complete conversion of CH3NH3PbI3 from the PbI2 film. Thus inappropriate amounts of perovskite precursor solution can reduce Jsc and FF due to traceable insulating precursors and non-stoichiometric compounds in the prepared perovskite thin films.

We have investigated the effect of the electric field on spray deposited perovskite films and further on the solar cell performance. We observed that the applied electric field improves the crystallinity, morphology and surface coverage of perovskite films with an improved atomization process during spraying. With an optimized electric field of 1.5 kV, we obtained the pure crystal phase with an average grain size of around 350 nm, which led to the highest PCE of 10.9% from the cell, and without an electric field the cell PCE is 6.5% due to the improved charge carrier transportation process. The hysteresis index which depends on the crystal size also improves with the applied voltage and is found to be minimum for devices fabricated at 1.5 kV. We further optimized the perovskite film thickness of around 320 nm by varying the CH3NH3I spray solution volume and with an optimized applied voltage of 1.5 kV, we achieved the average conversion efficiency of ∼11.0% from the PSC. Besides this, further investigations on spray deposition of mesoporous TiO2 and HTM layers are also in progress to boost the cell efficiency using an electric field. Our results demonstrate that the electrostatic assisted spray deposition method can be considered as one of the low cost techniques for preparing high quality perovskite films with a large area to fabricate photovoltaic devices for harnessing the abundant solar energy.
