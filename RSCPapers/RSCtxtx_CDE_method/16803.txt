Mg doping into high temperature processed (HTP) SnO2 as an electron selective layer (ESL) significantly improves perovskite solar cell (PSC) performance including power conversion efficiency (PCE), open circuit voltage, short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor. An optimum Mg content (7.5%) affords a uniform, smooth and dense Mg-doped SnO2 film with high electron mobility and its corresponding PSC displays less hysteresis and achieves a highest steady-state PCE of 14.55%, nearly 92.8% enhancement compared to that with undoped SnO2. Electrical measurements show that suitable Mg doping dramatically reduces free electron density and substantially increases the electron mobility of pristine SnO2. The mechanism of efficiency enhancement for PSCs is proposed as follows: the low free electron density causes suppression of carrier recombination and high electron mobility facilitates fast extraction of electrons from perovskite to ESLs, contributing to an improved JSC. Impedance analysis strongly supports the proposed mechanism and reveals that the higher is the electron mobility, the higher is the electron collection efficiency, and the higher are the JSC and PCE. The HTP SnO2 with a suitable Mg content can be an excellent ESL for PSCs and might well be a suitable candidate of ESLs for CdTe, CuInGaSe and other photovoltaic devices involved in HTP treatment.

Electron selective layers (ESLs) play important roles in achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Previous studies revealed that the perovskite material transported both holes and electrons, naturally leading towards the investigation of a thin film perovskite configuration with an ESL for electron extraction and hole blocking. Subsequently, more and more studies proved that the ESL was crucial for determining the performance of PSCs, including the synthesis methodology for a dense interfacial layer for hole blocking and appropriate energy-level alignment with a perovskite absorber for electron extraction. Thus, the exploration of materials used as the ESLs for PSCs remains a subject of high interest and one of the most challenging scientific issues.

Stannic oxide (SnO2) as an ESL for PSCs has attracted much attention recently. It enjoys high electron mobility, stability under UV illumination as well as antireflection properties in comparison with TiO2. SnO2 prepared by low temperature treatment proved to be an excellent ESL material for efficient PSCs. Snaith et al. formed a SnO2 ESL by immersing the cleaned FTO substrate in 40 mM aqueous solution of SnCl4 at 80 °C. The fabricated perovskite cells reached an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.2 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17%. Grätzel et al. used a low temperature atomic layer deposition process to fabricate SnO2 ESL and the planar PSCs were almost hysteresis-free and could achieve PCE above 18% with VOC exceeding 1.19 V. Miyasaka et al. and Kuang et al. developed SnO2 films by low temperature processes. Their optimized planar PSCs attained the best PCE of up to 13% and 14.69%, respectively. Our recent work also proved that low temperature solution processed SnO2 was an outstanding ESL material for efficient PSCs with an average efficiency of 16.02% with a VOC of 1.11 V, even better than TiO2. However, the device with high temperature processed (HTP) SnO2 suffered from performance degradation and its highest reported PCE to date is around 8%. This phenomenon is due to HTP SnO2 producing discrepancies such as worse interfacial contact, electrical properties and unaligned energy level with the adjacent perovskite layer.
To overcome the adversity, surface modifications were attempted to improve the properties of HTP SnO2 films as ESLs for PSCs. Yang et al. coated a thin TiO2 barrier layer on SnO2 with TiCl4 treatment, which considerably reduces the recombination while largely maintaining the superior electron-transport properties. They achieved a record PCE of 8.54%, higher than the efficiency values of all of the SnO2-based dye sensitized solar cells. Dai et al. modified the surface of SnO2 film by treating it with TiCl4 aqueous solution, which significantly retarded the recombination process and improved the device PCE from 6.5% to greater than 10%. These reports have successfully demonstrated the possibility of utilizing the HTP SnO2 as an ESL in PSCs. However, these surface modifications only contributed to a moderate PCE of around 8% for the devices and the employed methods such as TiCl4 treatment could be incompatible with the simple and fast production of the devices. In addition, in spite of the crucial importance of SnO2 as the ESL for device functionality, the energetics of these systems, i.e., energy positions of electronic bands and their alignment with the energy levels of adjacent perovskite layers, have yet not been determined comprehensively. Therefore, extending the feasibility of HTP SnO2 as well as efficient characterization of SnO2 as ESLs for high performance PSCs has become an important issue.
Doping is one of the most important methods used in interfacial engineering to improve the performance of cells. In this work, we attempted to introduce magnesium (Mg) into SnO2 films via high temperature treatment for modifying its surface topography, tailoring its optical and electrical properties and tune the energy levels so as to improve the device performance. Mg2+ has an ionic radius of 72 nm, which is close to the ionic radius of Sn4+ that is 71 nm. Therefore replacement of Sn by Mg does not change the lattice constants and crystal structure. It is possible to improve the film quality and tune the energy band structure by doping SnO2 with a suitable amount of Mg. Our results show that suitable Mg doping into SnO2 films is a simple and efficient approach to contribute to a great improvement of the device performance. To understand the mechanism of performance enhancement and uncover the origin of differences for the devices with different Mg contents, we used the measurement techniques for the determination of the major electronic processes under the working device conditions. We focused on the influences of the different Mg contents in SnO2 films on the interfacial contact, optical properties, electrical parameters and band structures, which were deeply associated with the parameters of device performance including PCE, VOC, short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). In particular, the electrical characterization allows determination of the resistivity, carrier concentration and mobility while the impedance spectrum affords to evaluate the kinetics of carrier transfer, recombination and collection for SnO2-based ESLs. This electrical characterization combined with the impedance analysis technique could offer a simple and compact method for an insight into the correlation between the properties of ESLs and device parameters and thus could contribute to further optimization of the design of ESLs and improvement of device performance. Moreover, the HTP SnO2 with suitable Mg content also proved to be an excellent ESL for PSCs and might well be a suitable ESL candidate for CdTe, CuInGaSe and other photovoltaic devices where high temperature treatment is involved.

Hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, 99.99%), methylamine (33 wt% in absolute ethanol), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99.9%) and anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2), Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), chlorobenzene, and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were purchased from Aladdin. 2-Propanol, chloroform, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, ethanol, acetone, Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O (99.8%) and SnCl2·2H2O (99.7%) were received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deionized water (resistivity > 18 MΩ) was obtained using a Millipore water purification system. All chemicals, solvents and reagents were used as purchased.


0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20 mol% Mg-doped SnO2 colloidal ethanol solutions were prepared by mixing Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O and SnCl2·2H2O and fixing them into a total concentration of 0.075 mol L−1 in an ambient atmosphere for 0.5 h. F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass (14 ohm sq.−1, Asahi Glass), slide glass or fused silica substrates were cleaned by sonication in a detergent, acetone, 2-propanol, and ethanol. Then, the substrates were further cleaned using UV ozone for 15 min. After cleaning, undoped and doped SnO2 layers were deposited by spin coating with 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing in air with different ramping rates to the final 550 °C. These prepared films were used for optical or electrical characterization or solar cell fabrication. In addition, to obtain the phase compositions of the prepared films, the undoped and doped SnO2 powders were collected by scraping SnO2 coatings off the slide glass for XRD measurements.


CH3NH3I was synthesized by a previously reported method. Hydroiodic acid (9.8 mL, 0.15 mol) and methylamine (18.7 mL, 0.15 mol) with a 1:1 molar ratio were stirred in an ice bath for 2 h. The precipitate was collected by evaporating the solution at 50 °C or 2 h. Finally, a white powder was obtained by washing with diethyl ether and ethanol three times and then drying at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.


The organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) was deposited by a sequential method from the literature. PbI2 solution (460 mg mL−1 in DMF at 70 °C) was spin-coated on top of the SnO2-based films. After drying at 70 °C for 30 minutes in a dry box, a coated FTO substrate was dipped into CH3NH3PbI3 solution (in 2-propanol, 10 mg mL−1) for 5 min, then dried at 70 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD-based HSL was deposited using a solution, which contained 80 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 μL TPB and 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), all dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene. This precursor solution was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 15 s. Finally, a gold film was deposited on top of the HSL by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 10−4 Pa to complete the device. We show that solar cell devices of the same CH3NH3PbI3 composition produce similar electro-optical characteristics. In this case, any performance differences should be attributed to the use of different ESLs.


The morphologies of SnO2-based films as well as PSCs were observed by high-resolution field emission SEM (JSM6700F). The phase purity was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometer (Y-2000) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). A scan efficiency of 0.1° S−1 was applied to record the powder patterns in the range of 20° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed using a XPS/UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi, USA). All samples were sputter-cleaned to remove atmospheric contamination in the XPS chamber for approximately 20 s by lower energy argon ions (Ar+). The Ar+ gun was operated at 0.5 kV at a pressure of 1 × 10−7 Pa. The vacuum pressure of the analysis chamber was higher than 2 × 10−8 Pa. For XPS, survey scans to identify overall surface compositions and chemical states were performed using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (=1486.68 eV), detecting photoelectrons at 150 eV pass energy and a channel width of 500 meV. The surface carbon signal at 284.6 eV was used as an internal standard. UPS was carried out using He I radiation at 21.22 eV from a discharge lamp operated at 90 W, a pass energy of 10 eV, and a channel width of 25 meV. A bias (−9 V) was applied to the samples in order to separate the sample and analyzer low-kinetic-energy cutoffs. The absorption and transmission spectra of the SnO2-based films on FTO and quartz glass substrates were measured using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (CARY5000, Varian, Australia). Hall measurements were conducted via a LakeShore 7704 Hall Measurement System. The PSCs were stored in an ambient atmosphere for a short period of time and then measured under AM 1.5 simulated irradiation with a standard ABET Sun 2000 Solar Simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. The cell size was 2 cm2. The active area was 0.09 cm2, which was defined by the area of the Au electrode. The current density–voltage (J–V), and impedance spectra (IS) were measured using a CHI660D electrochemical station (Shanghai, China). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a Quantum Efficiency/IPCE system (PV Measurements Inc.) in the 320–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. IS data were analyzed using Zspwim equivalent circuit modeling software (Scribner).


For clarity and brevity, if not otherwise specified, the undoped, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20 mol% Mg-doped SnO2 and their corresponding PSCs are denoted as 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20% SnO2 or PSCs, respectively. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of undoped and doped SnO2. All peaks corresponding to diffraction planes (110), (101), (200), (211), (220), (002), (221), (112), (301), (202) and (321) are in good agreement with the standard of the rutile type tetragonal structure of SnO2 (JCPDS41-1445). The XRD patterns of Mg-doped SnO2 are almost similar to that of 0% SnO2, suggesting the incorporation of Mg ions into the SnO2 host lattice owing to the very close ionic radii of Sn4+ (71 nm) and Mg2+ (72 nm). To identify the existence of the MgO phase, we provide the enlarged XRD patterns in Fig. S1 of the ESI. We were unable to track the effects of the small Mg content (≤3%) in SnO2, which is in accordance with the experimental and computational results. In the case of 5% and 7.5% SnO2, impurity peaks corresponding to the (200) plane of MgO appeared, indicating the limit of doping by using the current method. Increasing the Mg content significantly degraded the intensity of the XRD peaks and finally resulted in the disappearance of the phase information of MgO, indicating excessive Mg doping (≥10%), which was detrimental to the crystallinity of both MgO and SnO2.

To investigate the distortion of the nanocrystal lattice of SnO2 after Mg doping, the effective strain η inside undoped and doped SnO2 was evaluated by the well-known Williamson–Hall equation:
where
λ is the wavelength of the X-ray; δ is the crystalline size and η represents the effective lattice strain. β is the full width half maxima (FWHM) of the corresponding peak situated at position θ. When βcosθ/λ was plotted against sinθ/λ for the different samples and fitted linearly, the strain was obtained from the slope. Four prominent peaks arising from (110), (101), (200) and (211) planes were considered for the plot (Fig. 1b). It is known that the strain η indicates the distortion of the nanocrystal lattice. The average effective strain η varies as −0.665%, 0.322%, 0.379%, −0.073%, −1.23% and 2.74% for 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20% SnO2, indicating that appropriate doping (≤7.5%) contributes to the improvement of strain while excess doping (≥10%) causes the reverse of it.



Fig. 2a shows typical broad-scan XPS spectra with the binding energy range of 0–1300 eV for 0 and 7.5% SnO2. The spectra of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20% SnO2 are similar to those of 7.5% SnO2, not shown here. The spectra include primary peaks corresponding to Sn 4d (25.8 eV), Sn 3d5/2 (486.4 eV), Sn 3d3/2 (494.9 eV) and O 1s (530.5 eV), and minor peaks from Sn 3p3/2 (716.8 eV), Sn 2p1/2 (757.8 eV), Sn Auger (MNN, 1060.2 eV), O Auger (KLL, 977.8 eV) and adventitious carbon (284.5 eV). Besides Mg 1s and Mg Auger peaks (not including 0% SnO2), the absence of an additional impurity peak further confirms the phase compositions of the samples. The peaks corresponding to binding energies for Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 appeared at 486.4 eV and 494.9 eV, respectively, for all samples, giving a spin orbit coupling of 8.5 eV and identifying the existence of Sn as Sn4+. The doublet is shown in Fig. 2b for clarity.

The lower energy portion of the XPS for 7.5% SnO2 is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. It clearly provides convincing evidence for the presence of Mg 2p3/2 at 50.7 eV and Mg 2s at 91 eV. Increasing the Mg content results in the increase of the intensity and area of the two peaks (Fig. S2), indicating that Mg was well implanted into SnO2. The Mg KLL peak (304.8 eV) is also supportive of the presence of Mg in the doped sample due to the characteristic binding energy peak. EDX analysis of 0 and 7.5% SnO2 further confirms these results because of the quantitative evaluation of nearly 7.5% Mg content in 7.5% SnO2 (Fig. S3).

The above characterizations confirmed that 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20% SnO2 films were obtained. To determine whether this doping design is feasible for the device performance, we fabricated PSCs with device architecture similar to the commonly used planar configuration. A SEM image of this structure is shown in Fig. 3a. FTO, SnO2-based film, perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3), spiro-OMeTAD and Au were used as the electrode, ESL, absorber, hole selective layer (HSL) and back contact, respectively. The thicknesses of the SnO2-based film, perovskite, HSL and Au layers were evaluated to be 50, 450, 350 and 220 nm, respectively.

We used a typical full device structure (Fig. 3c) to systematically examine the performance of PSCs with SnO2-based ESLs. Statistic results of the parameters of cell performance are registered in Fig. 4. These box charts demonstrate that the photovoltaic performance is strongly influenced by Mg doping. We obtained an average PCE of 7.186% (Fig. 4a) for 0% PSC. The value is close to the reported data for PSCs with HTP SnO2. After Mg doping, the average PCE of the devices was significantly improved up to 10.91, 11.98, 13.56, 10.39 and 9.925% for 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 20% PSCs, respectively. The average PCE of the device has achieved a nearly 89% enhancement (from 7.168 to 13.56%) when an optimum Mg content (7.5%) was employed for interfacial modification. Impressively, after Mg doping, all parameters of cell performance including PCE, VOC, JSC and FF more or less shifted to the corresponding higher values. The order of PCE values was the same as those of JSC and FF for all devices and determined as 0% < 20% < 10% < 2.5% < 5% < 7.5% PSCs (Fig. 4a, c and d). For VOC values (Fig. 4b), the order changed to 0% < 20% < 10% < 2.5% < 7.5% < 5% PSCs. These results show that Mg doping contributes to both the improvement and regulation of the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Note that 7.5% is an optimum quantity for Mg-doped SnO2 as an ESL, as a result, we compared the cell performance of 7.5% PSCs with its undoped counterpart to determine how much the performance can be improved after Mg doping. Fig. 5a gives the J–V characteristics of the two cells with their highest PCEs. The J–V curves were measured under forward and reverse voltage scanning (scan rate 0.1 V s−1). The specific performance parameters are given in Table S1. It demonstrates that the performance parameters of 7.5% PSCs were greatly improved in contrast to those of the 0% one. Moreover, 7.5% Mg doping significantly suppressed anomalous hysteresis as well. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5a, the onset of the dark current of 7.5% PSCs shifted to a higher voltage with respect to the 0% one.
The shift in the onset of the dark current contributes to the corresponding increase in the VOC. These results imply that Mg doping significantly suppressed the electron–hole recombination at the interfaces due to the reduction of the back flow of electrons from the blocking layer to the perovskite layer or hole transport layer.Fig. 5b shows the steady-state JSC and efficiencies of these two cells. The constant bias voltages of 0.793 V and 0.599 V are consistent with the voltages at the maximum power points of J–V curves of these two cells. Compared with 0% PSCs, the 7.5% device achieved a substantial increase in steady-state JSC (from 12.58 to 18.35 mA cm−2), suggesting that Mg doping significantly improved the electron extraction efficiency, contributing to most of the enhancement of steady-state efficiency (nearly 92.8%, from 7.546 to 14.55%). In addition, the two cells showed good and similar long-term stability. They were stored in dry air (humidity < 20%) and presented low degradation of PCE (Fig. S4) within 30 days, close to Miyasaka et al. and Grätzel et al.'s SnO2-based devices. The integrated JSC of 12.68 and 18.85 mA cm−2 from IPCE data agree well with the measured values (Fig. 5b and its inset).

To have an insight into the influence of Mg doping on the cell performance, a series of morphology, optical absorption, photoelectron spectroscopy and electrical properties studies have been carried out for all film samples.


Fig. 6 gives the top surface SEM images of all SnO2-based films coated on FTO substrates. Fig. 6a shows that 0% SnO2 film was discontinuous owing to the appearance of many cracks, suggesting that the FTO substrate cannot be fully covered with SnO2 nanoparticles under the current synthesis conditions. Interestingly, after Mg doping, the situation was entirely different. Appropriate Mg doping (2.5, 5 and 7.5%) significantly improves the film quality and contributes to uniform, smooth and dense SnO2 films as shown in SEM and AFM results (Fig. 6 and S5). This can be further confirmed by the comparison of the surface flatness of bare FTO and SnO2-coated FTO. Fig. S5a shows a highly rough surface of bare FTO due to the presence of many large-sized F-doped SnO2 grains. Coating of 7.5% SnO2 smoothened the surface of bare FTO by filling the pitholes (Fig. S5b). AFM images (Fig. S5c and S5d) show that the root mean square roughness of bare FTO was sharply reduced (from 15.6 nm and 3.4 nm) after 7.5% SnO2 was coated on FTO. Unfortunately, excess Mg content (10 and 20%) degrades the film quality, leading to surface irregularity. The differences of the film quality might originate from their average effective strain η as previously discussed (Fig. 1b) that appropriate doping (≤7.5%) contributes to improvement of strain while excess doping (≥10%) causes the reverse of it. In the case of 0% SnO2 film, imperfect coverage gave rise to ready recombination of electron–hole across the FTO/perovskite interface. As for excess Mg-doped SnO2 films, the surface irregularity can induce poor carrier transport via defective interfacial contact, resulting in the loss of carriers due to carrier recombination and trapping in poor quality films. As a whole, we observed relatively poor device performance for 0, 10 and 20% PSCs. However, a flat and dense ESL readily resolves the above issues. Flat and dense ESLs have been widely reported and proved to be an essential component of high-efficiency PSC devices. Therefore, dense and uniform SnO2 films with a suitable Mg content contributed to an excellent interfacial contact with perovskite layers and the improvement of cell performance. However, performance differences are still obvious even for the PSCs with suitable Mg-doped SnO2, implying that besides interfacial contact, some other factors influencing the cell performance are also at work and further investigations are required.


Fig. 7a shows the transmission spectra of the bare FTO, doped and undoped SnO2-coated FTO. Slightly better transmission was observed after the FTO substrates were coated with SnO2-based films. The good antireflection of these coated FTO proved to be important to achieve improved JSC and, therefore, higher PCE for PSCs. To determine the band gaps of all films, we also measured the transmission spectra of SnO2 coated on quartz glass. We did this because we failed to abstract the band gaps according to the transmission spectra in Fig. 7a. Apparently, one cannot tell the differences of absorption edges due to the shield effect of the FTO substrate. Fig. 7b demonstrates that all films exhibit well pronounced fundamental absorption edges in the rather narrow energy range. The optical band gaps of the samples were calculated from (αhν)1/nversus hν curves plotted (inset of Fig. 7b) for n values (n = 1/2), a direct optical transition. As shown in the inset, the band gap of the 0% SnO2 film is 3.95 eV, which is larger than the typical value quoted for bulk SnO2 (∼3.6 eV). The band-gap values for all films are listed in Table 1. The band-gap becomes narrow first and widens later with increasing Mg content, which is consistent with the report by Zhou et al. These SnO2-based films have a much more wider band-gap than TiO2 (3.2 eV). In this case, the SnO2-based films are much more transparent than TiO2 under solar irradiation, and thus more favorable as window materials for photovoltaic devices.

Furthermore, SnO2-based film enjoys better photochemical stability than TiO2 due to the high photocatalytic activity of the latter. These results suggest that SnO2-based film is a very potential ESL candidate for high-performance photovoltaic devices.


Fig. 8 shows the relative accurate position of the energy band of SnO2-based films recorded by characterization of UPS, which is a widely used technique that provides direct measurements of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM). The full UPS spectra using He I radiation are located in the middle position. Work function (WF) is derived by subtracting the cut-off binding energy (the right panel of Fig. 8) with the photon-energy of 21.22 eV. The WFs of all films are listed in Table 1. It is obvious that increasing the Mg content increases the WFs. The enlarged valence spectra are shown in the left panel of Fig. 8. The low binding energy onset region in the range of 0–6 eV can be used to calculate the VBM relative to the Fermi level. The onset value is the distance between the VBM and the WF. Thus, the VBM could be determined. Based on the data of UPS and band gaps, the detailed information of the energy levels of SnO2-based films was established and is listed in Table 1 as well.

According to Table 1 and the energy levels of relevant functional layers already well characterized and determined in the literature, we plotted the diagram of energy levels for the device (Fig. 3b). All energies are referenced to the vacuum energy (0 eV).
As shown in Fig. 3b, Mg doping significantly lowered the CBM position of pristine SnO2. The order of CBM values for all films was determined as 0 > 5 > 10 > 7.5 > 20 > 2.5% SnO2. It is reported that VOC is proportional to the quasi-Fermi level difference between ESL and HSL. The quasi-Fermi levels of ESL and HSL are highly related to the CB and VB positions of ESL and HSL, respectively. However, 0% SnO2 has the highest CBM position but the corresponding PSC delivers the lowest VOC. Moreover, the order of CBM was not the same as the order of VOC (Fig. 4b). These results may originate from poorer interfacial contact in the corresponding PSCs, leading to lower VOC. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3b, the CBM of perovskite is 0.42 eV higher than that of 0% SnO2 and much more higher than those of doped SnO2. In this case, Mg doping results in significantly large offsets. The large offset was inappropriate for energy alignments of perovskite/ESL because the suitable offset was about 0.2 eV, which can ensure the efficient injection of electrons from the perovskite to the ESL. Thus, in this case, a loss in VOC is expected for all SnO2-based devices due to large offsets. Indeed, we could only obtain a highest VOC of less than 1.03 eV (Fig. 4b) for our devices, which was much lower than those of low temperature processed SnO2-based PSCs, which can reach 1.11, 1.20 (ref. 14) and 1.19 V. However, Mg doping narrowed the offsets between ESLs and the Fermi level of FTO, which reaches ∼5.0 eV after UV-ozone treatment. This could facilitate electron transfer across the doped SnO2 films/FTO interfaces.


Fig. 9 shows the resistance, resistivity, carrier density and mobility of all films obtained by Hall measurements. The resistance (RV) is defined as the transport resistance across the entire SnO2 layer in the vertical direction of the film surface. RV of all films was evaluated according to the following linear relationship, eqn (1):

RV = ρT/S
(1)
where
RV, ρ, T and S are the resistance, resistivity, thickness and area of SnO2 film, respectively. As described in the Experimental section, the thickness T and area S of SnO2 films are around 50 nm and 0.09 cm2, respectively. The specific descriptions of these electrical parameters are given in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 9a, increasing the Mg content increases the resistivity and resistance. The resistance presented a similar variation to the resistivity due to their linear relationship. The RV listed in Table 2 ranged from ∼10−4 to ∼10−3 Ω for all SnO2 films, which were relatively low values and could be negligible in comparison with the series resistance (Rs) for any photovoltaic devices.

Surprisingly, Mg doping could dramatically reduce the carrier density and effectively regulate the carrier mobility (Fig. 9b). As for 7.5% SnO2 film, nearly two orders of magnitude reduction and over 5 times increase can be observed for carrier density and mobility, respectively. Here, all SnO2-based films are n-type semiconductors and the major carriers here are free electrons, which were determined by Hall measurements. The free electron density and mobility presented a totally opposite variation trend due to their reverse relationship as eqn (2):
σ = eneμe
(2)
where
σ, e, ne and μe are the electrical conductivity, electric quantity of unit charge, electron density and mobility, respectively. Comparing Fig. 4c with 9b, one could conclude that the order of electron mobility values was actually the same as the order of JSC values, which was 0 > 20 > 10 > 2.5 > 5 > 7.5% SnO2 films and PSCs, respectively.

Enlightened by the close correlation of electrical properties and device performance, we proposed the mechanism for explaining the efficiency enhancement for the PSCs. On one hand, the free electrons in SnO2-based films may recombine with photogenerated holes at the SnO2/perovskite interface, leading to a weakened ability to block holes. Thus, it is expected that dramatic reduction of free electron density in SnO2 after Mg doping can greatly prevent the recombination of photogenerated carriers, contributing to an improved JSC. On the other hand, the higher the electron mobility, the faster the electrons can be transferred from perovskite to SnO2-based ESLs, also contributing to an improved JSC. Indeed, we can observe a significant enhanced photocurrent for all devices with Mg-doped SnO2, especially for the 7.5% PSCs (Fig. 4b).

To confirm the proposed mechanism and further comprehensively understand the origin of performance enhancement and the differences for the devices with different Mg contents, IS measurements were conducted to investigate the internal electrical processes and qualitatively analyze the associated parameters.

We conducted the IS measurements by selecting a batch of PSCs whose performance parameters were very close to the average values shown in Fig. 4. A detailed description of the J–V curves, IPCE and performance parameters is included in Fig. S6 and Table S2. The resulting IS were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 10a. The Nyquist plot reveals two distinct features (Fig. 10a and b). One feature occurs at high frequency predominantly with semicircles and the second appears at low-medium frequency with obvious arcs. The high-frequency feature in planar PSC devices has been attributed to the charge transport within the Spiro-OMeTAD HSLs. However, this feature was also observed in the absence of the HSLs, and therefore was linked to charge accumulation at the interfaces of perovskite layer/HSLs and perovskite layer/ESLs. The lower-frequency feature was suggested to be associated with the dielectric response of the perovskite layer. The equivalent circuit used to describe these two features comprises the Rs, the charge transfer resistance (Rtr) and recombination resistance (Rrec) at the perovskite/contact layer interface, the selective contact capacitance (Ccon) owing to the charge buildup at the interfaces of perovskite/contact layers, the dielectric relaxation resistance (Rdr) and the dielectric relaxation capacitance (Cdr) of the perovskite film. The equivalent circuit incorporates a Debye dielectric relaxation component that Bisquert et al. and Chen et al. have identified as related to the frequency dependence of the perovskite polarization and are particularly designed to establish an accurate impedance model for planar PSCs devices.
The Nyquist plots (Fig. 10) illustrate the high frequency and low-medium frequency impedance features typically observed in planar PSCs. In our PSCs, the charge transport resistances of FTO, SnO2, perovskite, HSL, Au and conductive wire of the external circuit constitute most of the Rs. Thus, the Rs displayed an independence of different bias voltages (Fig. 11a). The value of Rs is the point of intersection between the semicircles and the X-axis in the high frequency section, which is 7.64, 6.88, 5.81, 4.52, 29.49, and 35.87 Ω for 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10% and 20% PSCs, respectively. Apparently, the only difference of these PSCs is their SnO2-based ESLs. Thus, it seems that the RV of SnO2-based films contributed a lot to Rs. However, as shown in Fig. 9a and Table 2, the RV ranging from ∼10−4 to ∼10−3 Ω for all SnO2 films could make negligible contribution to the corresponding Rs. Thus, the significantly large Rs for 10 and 20% PSCs might well originate from their surface irregularity which induced poor carrier transport via defective interfacial contact. Additionally, Rs plays an important role in the final device performance, as it has a deleterious effect on the FF. The relatively high Rs of 10 and 20% PSCs significantly resulted in low FF. The lowest FF of 0% PSCs may be ascribed to both film inhomogeneity and incomplete coverage of the FTO substrate.
Electric charge transfer and recombination processes occur in all photovoltaic devices. Rtr and Rrec represent the transfer and recombination resistance of carriers at the interfaces bordering the perovskite layer. It is apparent that the Rtr and Rrec resistive elements displayed an essentially exponential dependence on the open-circuit potential (Fig. 11b and c). The exponential dependence is expected since charges are more likely to transfer and recombine across the contacting interfaces when there is a higher population of free-carriers within the perovskite layer. Comparing Fig. 11b and c with 9b, one could conclude that the order of Rrec values was the reverse of that of free electron density values while the order of Rtr values was consistent with that of electron mobility values. This means low free electron density induces high Rrec while high electron mobility gives rise to low Rtr. The results are strongly supportive of the above proposed mechanism.
When the internal impedance in the cell is low, the transport and extraction of free-carriers are easier, resulting in a higher charge collection efficiency (ηcc). ηcc can be calculated according to eqn (3):
ηcc = 1/[1 + (τtr/τn)]
(3)
The time of electron transfer τtr and the lifetime of electrons τn are determined by eqn (4) and (5):
τtr = Rct × Cμ
(4)
τn = Rrec × Cμ
(5)
where
Cμ represents the chemical capacitance and can be regarded as Ccon. The calculated ηcc is shown in Fig. S7. At a high open-circuit voltage, ηcc reduced due to the increase of recombination. Comparing Fig. S7 with Fig. 4c, the order of ηcc values was determined as 7.5 > 5 > 2.5 > 10 > 20 > 0% PSCs. The order is actually the same as that of JSC and electron mobility values while the reverse of that of free electron density values. The results suggest that the higher is the electron mobility, the higher is the ηcc, and the higher JSC. The variation of electron mobility mirrored that of ηcc and JSC, further confirming the proposed mechanism. High electron mobility facilitates fast abstraction of electrons from perovskite to SnO2-based ESLs, contributing to an improved JSC. Similar results were also obtained through the measurement of time-resolved photoluminescence by D. B. Kuan et al. who determined the order of efficiency of the charge transfer at the perovskite/ESL interface as SnO2 > SnO2/TiO2 > TiO2 ESLs, the same as the order of their electron mobility, suggesting that high electron mobility facilitates efficient charge transfer at the perovskite/ESL interface. Meanwhile, low free electron density results in the suppression of carrier recombination, also contributing to an improved JSC. The result is understandable since ηcc is one of the critical parameters for photocurrents in such devices.


Fig. 11d shows the fitted Rdr and Cdr values for these PSCs. The 0, 10 and 20% PSCs presented higher Rdr and Cdr than 2.5, 5 and 7.5% PSCs. As discussed above, Rdr and Cdr are related to the dielectric polarization of the perovskite material in the interfacial regions. The higher Rdr values in the 0, 10 and 20% PSCs imply that there is a stronger polarization in the perovskite and that this polarization is more resistant to relaxation.Cdr appears to reflect the relative charge concentration within the perovskite film. J. Bisquert et al. revealed that high capacitance could result in significant I–V hysteresis in the normal planar structure PSCs. In this case, the 0, 10 and 20% SnO2 films/perovskite interfaces accumulated significant interfacial charge and resulted in strong electric field strength, inducing the J–V hysteresis phenomenon. Moreover, the polarization characterization of 0, 10 and 20% PSCs was also supported by the curve shapes of the IS spectra. These evident elliptical arcs (Fig. 10b) were associated with the polarization with a broad distribution of relaxation lifetimes. These results may partly explain why the hysteresis characterization of 0% PSCs is much more serious than that of 7.5% PSCs (Fig. 5a).

The interfacial modification by Mg doping significantly improved the interfacial contact and the performance of SnO2-based planar PSCs. All parameters of cell performance including PCE, VOC, JSC and FF were elevated after the introduction of Mg into SnO2 film. 7.5% PSCs presented poor hysteresis characteristics and achieved a highest steady-state PCE of 14.55% and JSC exceeding 18 mA cm−2, nearly 92.8% PEC enhancement respectively compared to 0% PSCs. Mg doping lowered the levels of the conduction band, resulting in the increase of the offsets of doped ESLs/perovskite layers and thus reducing the VOC. However, suitable Mg doping significantly improved the interfacial contact, dramatically reduced the free electron density and substantially increased the electron mobility, in favor of the suppression of photogenerated carrier recombination and the improvement of electron transfer at the ESL/perovskite interfaces. J–V, electrical and IS measurements show that the order of electron mobility values was the same as that of JSC and ηcc values and determined as 7.5 > 5 > 2.5 > 10 > 20 > 0% for SnO2 films or PSCs. These results revealed that the higher is the electron mobility, the higher is the ηcc, resulting in the higher JSC and PCE. The poor hysteresis characteristics of 7.5% PSCs compared to that of the 0% counterpart may partly be due to their smaller Rdr and Cdr.
