There are only few semiconducting materials that have been shaping the progress of third generation photovoltaic cells as much as perovskites. Although they are deceivingly simple in structure, the archetypal AMX3-type perovskites have built-in potential for complex and surprising discoveries. Since 2009, a small and somewhat exotic class of perovskites, which are quite different from the common rock-solid oxide perovskite, have turned over a new leaf in solar cell research. Highlighted as one of the major scientific breakthroughs of the year 2013, the power conversion efficiency of the title compound hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite has now exceeded 18%, making it competitive with thin-film PV technology. In this minireview, a brief history of perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications is reported, the current state-of-the-art is distilled and the basic working mechanisms have been discussed. By analyzing the attainable photocurrent and photovoltage, realizing perovskite solar cells with 20% efficiency for a single junction, and 30% for a tandem configuration on a c-Si solar cell would be realistic.

The recent discovery of organo-metal halide perovskite crystals to replace the dye in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) gave thin film photovoltaics a renaissance. The versatility of the hybrid perovskites in composition and preparation makes them “excellent materials” with a unique combination of properties, including panchromatic absorption, high absorption coefficient, ambipolar charge-carrier mobilities, long exciton lifetimes/diffusion length and very low exciton binding energy. The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells based on the title compound has increased almost 5 times from its initial to the present state-of-the-art efficiency. In this context, a detailed elucidation about the progress of this phenomenon material is given in this review.


Generally, perovskite refers to a calcium titanium oxide mineral species composed of calcium titanate, with the chemical formula of CaTiO3. The mineral was discovered in the Ural Mountains of Russia by Gustav Rose in 1839 and is named after the Russian mineralogist Lev Perovski. Later on, the word ‘perovskite’ was borrowed to describe any material with the same type of crystal structure as calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO3), known as the perovskite structure. The compounds of the perovskite family exist extensively in nature, and the magnesium silicate perovskite (MgSiO3) is the most abundant mineral in the earth's mantle.

The general chemical formula for pure perovskite compounds is AMX3, where ‘A’ and ‘M’ are two cations of very different sizes, and X is an anion that binds to both. Oxide perovskites (AMO3) are formed from divalent AII (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+) and tetravalent MIV (Ti4+, Si4+, Fe4+) elements with O as the anion. The ideal cubic-symmetry structure has the M cation in 6-fold coordination, surrounded by an octahedron of anions (MX6), and the A cation in 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination (Fig. 1a and b). The relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent, so slight buckling and distortion can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions, in which the coordination numbers of ‘A’ cations, ‘M’ cations or both are reduced. Many physical properties of perovskites depend crucially on the details of these distortions, particularly the electronic, magnetic and dielectric properties, which are very important for many of the applications of perovskite materials. For example, the distortions as a consequence of cation substitution can be used to fine tune physical properties exhibited by perovskites. For perovskites, the measure of the mismatch between the average equilibrium A–X and M–X bond lengths is expressed by the tolerance factor  (where RA, RM and RX are the ionic radii of A, M and X, respectively).
The first observation of photocurrents in oxide perovskite – BaTiO3 – can date back to 1956. Following that, a similar phenomenon was observed in LiNbO3, which was attributed to the presence of internal fields due to space charge at the crystal surfaces – ferroelectricity. Enlightened by these pioneering studies, researchers started to explore the potential of photovoltaic application in these oxide perovskites. The physical mechanism of the photovoltaic effect in ferroelectrics is not completely understood. A possible explanation is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. In these materials, the strong inversion symmetry breaking leading to the polarization-induced internal electric field promotes the desirable separation of photo-excited carriers and allows voltages higher than the bandgap, which may enable efficiencies beyond the maximum possible in a conventional p–n junction solar cell. For example, in doped ferroelectric LiNbO3 crystals a large saturation photovoltage in excess of 1000 V was demonstrated. However, the previously obtained efficiency of the photovoltaic effect in oxide perovskites is very low, typically from the order of 10−7 to 10−5 to less than 1%.
Halide perovskite (AMX3) represents a big collateral series of perovskite family and it is reasonable to divide them roughly into alkali-halide perovskite and organo-metal halide perovskite (Fig. 3). The first category is mainly formed from the monovalent alkali metal AI (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) and the divalent MII (Be2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+) with X representing halogen anions (F−, Cl−, Br−, I−). There was no report relating halide perovskite materials to solar absorbers until 1980, when Salau reported a new compound KPbI3 (potassium lead iodate) having an absorption edge (direct energy gaps between 1.4 and 2.2 eV) that matches the solar spectrum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the halide perovskite material has been identified for photovoltaic application. Considering Schoiject's proposition on the requirements of new materials for solar photovoltaic cells, the author suggested the potential use of KPbI3 as a new solar cell material with an optimum theoretical efficiency of 36% and an operating temperature of 220 °C. Though the author prepared the alloys with the desired band gap by simply grinding together the powders of PbI2 and KI, no real solar cell device was demonstrated based on this alkali metal halide perovskite material.
Distinct from the inorganic oxide perovskites and alkali-metal halide perovskite, for the past 20 years, the organometal halide perovskites (AMX3) feature relatively young but also extensively studied crystalline families of hybrids, consisting of a wide range of organic cations (A: aliphatic or aromatic ammonium) and divalent metal cations (M: Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Pd2+, Cd2+, Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+, Eu2+, etc.) (Fig. 3). Among these combinations, perovskites containing metal halides in the fourth main group (4A, including Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+) attracted more interest due to their good optoelectronic properties and potential for low-temperature device fabrication. Depending on the characteristics of the ammonium cation, the general formula for a typical 〈100〉 single or multilayer organometal halide perovskite can be written as (RNH3)2An−1MnX3n+1 (where A = CH3NH3 but may be any other small cation) (Fig. 1c). When n = 1, a single inorganic layer is encountered. As n increases so does the thickness of the inorganic sheet. Hence as n → ∞ the dimensionality → 3D. The ending of this process is narrowed band gap and/or increased mobility of charges within the layers. The focus of this minireview will be on the solar cell application of 3D perovskite materials.
Although these class of materials have been widely studied for decades, initial interest was focused on their photo- or ionic conductivity and semiconducting properties for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and thin film transistor (TFT) applications. At the same time, unlike the intensive studies on tin(II)-based halide perovskite, lead(II)-based halide perovskites have received less attention due to much decreased metallic behavior and charge carrier mobility with respect to use in superconductor or TFT devices.
In the spring of 2009, organometal halide perovskites made a re-entry into the literature in the name of visible-light sensitizers for photovoltaic cells. In this report, Miyasaka et al. pioneered the first perovskite solar cells based on mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes that were sensitized with CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br). However, the resulting photo to current conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were only moderate (η = 3.81% for the triiodide and 3.13% for the tribromide), and the cell stabilities were poor in a liquid electrolyte configuration. Subsequently, in 2011 Park et al. fabricated again liquid dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using ca. 2–3 nm sized CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) nanocrystals with iodide redox shuttle and bumped up the conversion efficiency of the triiodide cell to 6.54% at 1 sun illumination. The improvement is believed to be due to the optimized titania surface and substitution of the DMF solvent by γ-butyrolactone (GBL). In both cases the perovskite absorbers were regarded as quantum dots (QDs) deposited on TiO2 although the absorbers dissolved or decomposed in the liquid electrolyte and the cells rapidly degraded within a few minutes. A schematic of the perovskite-sensitized titania and the spectral response of the ensuing solar cells is shown in Fig. 4.
When the organometal halide perovskite cells were facing the hitch of poor stability, alkali metal halide perovskite – fluorine-doped CsSnI3 – was adopted by Kanatzidis and co-workers in 2012 as p-type solid hole transporting materials (HTM) in a traditional dye-sensitized architecture with N719 as the absorber. This is the first time that a perovskite material has been used as the HTM in a solid state DSSC (ssDSSC) with efficiencies reaching approximately 10.2%, which revived the concept of all-solid-state inorganic solar cells and indicated the possibility that perovskite materials could be good HTM candidates. For solid-state sensitized solar cells, this represented a big step forward in performance in comparison to the best-reported ssDSSCs before, which exhibited just over 7% efficiency.
The next breakthrough came in late 2012, when M. Grätzel and co-workers teamed up with N. G. Park and used MAPbI3 as a light harvester in combination with the solid hole conductor 2,2′,7,7,′-tetrakis-(N,N-dimethoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) on mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2), which led to a PCE of 9.7% (Fig. 5a and b). Soon after that, H. Snaith in collaboration with T. Miyasaka discovered that in “meso-superstructured” solar cells the n-type mesoporous oxide can be replaced by an inert scaffold, such as Al2O3, onto which CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and spiro-MeOTAD were coated (Fig. 5c). The authors claimed that compared with the cells with m-TiO2, the use of the Al2O3 scaffold avoids the voltage drop associated with the occupation of the TiO2 band-tails and generates increased open circuit voltage (VOC) values as high as 1.13 V and an efficiency of 10.9%. This result established that the perovskite materials can also behave as n-type semiconductors. But it seems that in the absence of an m-TiO2 layer, a qualified compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) is still detrimental in a well-performing device.
Since the middle of 2013, several milestones in PCE improvement are being witnessed due to the innovation of the cell fabrication technique, which leads the efficiency of organometal halide perovskite based solar cells over 15% (Fig. 6). First came the introduction of a sequential deposition method (SDM) for the fabrication of perovskite on the m-TiO2 film, which gave a PCE of 15% and a certified value of 14.1% with high reproducibility, then came the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell fabricated by vapor deposition which demonstrated 15.4% PCE and matched the 15% efficiency record of the mesoporous cell. After that, a series of eye catching PCE values were reported: 15.6%, 15.7% (ref. 46) and 15.9% (ref. 47) and by the end of 2013, 17.9% efficiency was certified as well. The fast development has triggered tremendous research interest followed by rapid and continuous improvements in the whole perspective of the relative PV devices and discussions about the underlying principles and the potential for further improvement of efficiency. A thorough retrospect of the metal halide perovskites revealed the materials' excellent optical, electrical and mechanical properties along with solution processability. The remarkable synergistic achievements on devices from both materials science and device engineering promise further breakthroughs in this field of study. Currently, researchers from all over the world are working to broaden the cells' appeal by tailoring their chemical compositions to further boost the electrical output, by improving processing methods and stability, and by figuring out why these solar cells perform so unexpectedly well (Table 1).

Choices of materials for solar light harvesting are diverse, but the good candidates all share one merit: broad and strong absorption over the visible to near infrared region of the solar spectrum. It is believed that semiconductors with the band gap below 1.1 eV are suitable for solar light absorption. This band gap determines the strength (voltage) of the electric field, and when it is too low, then the cell will collect extra current (by absorbing more photons), but at the cost of having a small voltage. The optimal band gap, balancing these two effects, is around 1.4 eV for a solar cell made from a single material. According to the studies on perovskite crystals, scientists found that the band gap of the perovskite material will decrease with (a) increase of the dimensionality of the MO(X)6 network; (b) increase of the angle of M–O(X)–M (≤180°) bonds; (c) decrease of the electronegativity of anions; (d) decrease of the difference in effective electronegativity between the metal (M) cation and the anion. While the last two parameters are directly controlled by the nature of the elemental atoms (molecules), the first two are also influenced by extraneous factors e.g. temperature and/or pressure. Due to space constraints in paragraph, we will only discuss the band-gap tuning strategy above room temperature and under atmospheric conditions.


Typical oxide perovskites normally refer to alkaline earth metal titanate (ATiO3, A: Ca, Sr, Ba) and are colorless wide band gap (3–5 eV) solids due to the large difference in electronegativity between the oxygen and titanium atoms. The electronic structure of simple perovskite-type oxides near the Fermi level is formed mainly by mixing of frontier d-orbitals of the transition metal and 2p-orbitals of oxygen. The top of the valence band is represented mainly by oxygen non-bonding 2p-orbitals, whereas the bottom of the conduction band is formed by the anti-bonding 2p–nd orbitals of both atoms. By modifying the composition of the material according to the rules mentioned above, one low bandgap for an oxide perovskite Eg = 2.7 eV has been obtained for BiFeO3 and the recently fabricated LaCoO3-doped Bi4Ti3O12 films. This made BiFeO3 the subject of a number of investigations for photovoltaic applications. In 2013, A. M. Rappe and P. K. Davies showed the first strongly visible-light-absorbing ferroelectric perovskite material [KNbO3]1−x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3−δ]x (KBNNO) with the bandgaps in the range of 1.1–2.0 eV (Fig. 7). This study opened up the possibility of the use of oxide perovskites as solar absorber layers and carrier separators in practical photovoltaics.


Similar to its oxide perovskite counterparts, halide perovskite (AMX3) can easily achieve bandgap tuning by varying the combination of all the three cationic and anionic components. It is known from the first-principles study that the electronic structure of halide perovskite is dominated by the characteristics of the M–X bond: the valence-band maximum is characterized as an antibonding hybrid state of the M-ms (Pb: m = 6) and the X-np (n = 3–5) orbitals in the M–X chains. The conduction-band minimum is characterized as a non-bonding hybrid state of the M-mp (Pb: m = 6) and the X-np (n = 3–5) orbitals.


It has been proposed that in this system, the A cation does not play a major role in determining the band structure but acts to make charge compensation within the lattice. Nevertheless, it can influence the optical properties by deforming the MX64− octahedron network due to the variation of its size. A larger or smaller A cation can cause the whole lattice to expand or contract and lead to change of the B–X bond length which has been demonstrated to be important in the determination of the bandgap.

Given a particular metal and halide, for example APbI3, a relatively small size range is allowed for the A cation, since it must fit between the corner-sharing metal halide octahedral as indicated by the so-called tolerance factor (t). (ut supra) When t = 1, to maintain cubic symmetry, the value of the ionic radius (RA+) may not be larger than 2.6 Å. If the cation is too large, the 3D perovskite structure is unfavourable and lower-dimensional layered or confined perovskites will be formed. An ethylammonium cation based perovskite has been explored previously in solar cells, and was shown to form a wider bandgap perovskite due to a 2H-type structure. So far it has been proved that small monovalent cations, such as K+, Rb+, Cs+, methylammonium (MA+), or formanidinium (FA+) can form a three-dimensional (3D) framework with the PbI6 network. Within the scope of this comparison, the effective ionic radius follows a trend of RCs+ < RMA+ < RFA+ as illustrated in Fig. 8. It is observed that CsPbI3 absorbs up to a shorter wavelength, whereas FAPbI3 absorbs to a longer wavelength than MAPbI3. We can summarize that as the A cation increases in ionic radius, and hence the lattice would be expected to expand, the band gap decreases, causing a red-shift in the absorption onset. Enlightened by this phenomenon, Pellet et al. and Eperon et al. prepared formanidinium based perovskite and realized JSC higher than 20 mA cm−2. Also from Fig. 8, we have to note that when the metal is changed to a smaller Sn2+, the trend in the band gap is totally changed.

There are numerous reports of Pb(II) and Sn(II) halide 3D perovskites, however only a few reports were made of the 3D perovskite family of AGeX3 (A = Rb, Cs; X = Cl, Br, I). This is presumably because of the decreasing stability of the Ge(II) oxidation state when moving up the group on the periodic table. As mentioned above, the X–M–X bond angle has been attributed to have the greatest impact on tuning the band gap for each individual metal. Taking AMI3 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb) as an example, the M–I–M bridging angles between the MI6 octahedra are 166.27(8)° for Ge, 159.61(5)° for Sn and 155.19(6)° for Pb. At the same time, with the downward selection of the metal cation, a decrease of the covalent character of the M–I bond is observed, meaning the increase of the difference between the electron-negativity of the two atoms. Therefore the band gap of the group of perovskites follows the trend of AGeI3 < ASnI3 < APbI3. It is obvious from Fig. 8 that all the Sn(II) based perovskites show lower band gap than that of Pb(II) based perovskites. Bearing this in mind, it is convenient to combine Sn halide perovskite with Pb perovskite to realize NIR absorbing perovskite solar cells. Although the edge of the IPCE curve reached 1060 nm, which was 260 nm red-shifted compared with that of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, the efficiency was compromised by the poor Sn(II) stability.


Although people have observed an increase in lattice constants with the increasing atomic size of the anions from Cl to Br to I, electronic absorption spectra for Pb halide perovskite shift to longer wavelength by changing the halide from Cl to Br and I. For further discussion, we will limit ourselves to the MAPbX3 systems where X = Cl, Br, and I, as all the other 3D AMX3 cases will follow the same trend. The nature of the CBM and VBM was studied by a theoretical method and people found that the red shift of the bandgap upon proceeding down the group (Cl → I) is due to the increase in the covalent character of the halogen bonding with the lead, meaning a decrease of the electron-negativity of the halogen atom. Interestingly, a perovskite structure which incorporates two halides (e.g. iodide with bromide or bromide with chloride) allows for the continuous tuning of the bandgap and the optical absorption to cover almost the entire visible spectrum (Fig. 9). On the other hand, however, no obvious band gap change was observed in the case of iodo-chloride mixed perovskite, indicating that the mounting of Cl into the PbI6 octahedron is very difficult.


By virtue of the their ‘customizable’ low band gap, the perovskite absorbers showed superior advantages over traditional dyes by much more strongly absorbing over a broader range, enabling complete light absorption in films as thin as 500 nm. This is specifically favorable for the solid-state cells, where thickness limitations of around 2 μm have historically limited the light absorption and photocurrent generation. And this time, lead(II)-based halide perovskites outperformed their tin(II) counterparts due to much smaller oxidation sensitivity and stronger photovoltage response. So far only one report showed that tin(II) perovskite (MASnI3) was applied as a light absorber in a solar cell and another one with CsSnI3 served as a p-type semiconductor (HTM) in a DSSC. Due the extremely low PCE of oxide perovskite based solar cells, they will not be discussed in detail in this section.


The first record and certified solar cell obtained from organometal halide perovskite adopted methyl ammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) as the light absorber and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM (Fig. 6b and e). MAPbI3 as the most successfully applied perovskite material for light harvesting showed a narrow band gap of 1.55 eV, high extinction coefficient and excellent incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the solar cells up to 800 nm, harvesting the photons from visible range to part of the near-infrared (Fig. 10a). Therefore, researchers realized ever growing PCEs in PV devices from 3.9% (ref. 35) to 15.7% (ref. 46) within four years. However, the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) was limited to an average value of 17 mA cm−2. In theory, a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.5 eV can deliver photocurrents up to 27 mA cm−2 under standard AM1.5G illumination.

To achieve higher JSC, people looked in to new pervskite materials with broader light harvesting ability based on the band gap engineering strategy discussed in the previous sections. Compared with MAPbI3, formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) shows a narrower band gap as 1.48 eV (∼840 nm absorption onset), and hence lies even closer to that favorable for optimum solar conversion efficiencies (Fig. 10b). So far there have been few reports about devices based on FAPbI3 and the highest PCE achieved is reported to be 14.2% by Eperon et al. based on a planar heterojunction device structure. Although the average VOC (0.85 V) and FF (60%) dropped compared to those of MAPbI3 and average efficiency is still below 10%, the average JSC was increased to 18.8 mA cm−2 and a record value of 23.3 mA cm−2 was also reported.
Partially replacing the MA+ in MAPbI3 by FA+ is an innovative way to make use of the advantages of both cations. Pellet et al. demonstrated for the first time a perovskite-sensitized photovoltaic device based on the mixed cation perovskite (MA)x(FA)1−xPbI3 (x = 0 to 1). Here, the formamidinium (FA) cation is presented as a replacement for methylammonium (MA) in lead iodide perovskites. Devices based on pure FAPbI3 were made via sequential deposition and gave a PCE of 11.0% which is lower than that of MAPbI3 due to the presence of the yellow δ-phase. Surprisingly, using the same deposition method and adding 20% MA to the FA dipping bath completely avoids the undesirable formation of the δ-phase while maintaining the red-shifted band gap of FAPbI3. Moreover, the mixed-cation perovskite MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 exhibits superior PV performance to the single cation analogues owing to a greater harvesting and collection of red photons resulting in higher average JSC (19 mA cm−2) without sacrificing the photovoltage (∼1 V) and FF (70%). This superior carrier collection efficiency is likely related to the longer exciton lifetime in the MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 material exceeding 100 ns. Using this technique, it is possible to fabricate devices with an average PCE of 13.4% and record values up to 14.9% under the AM1.5G simulated solar spectrum (Fig. 6a). The strategy of mixing organic ammonium cations opens up new possibilities of tuning the optical, electrical and morphological properties of the semiconducting sensitizers to further improve the photovoltaic efficiency of perovskite-sensitized solar cells.
On the route to higher JSC, replacing the metal cation is an alternative method to narrow the band gap. In 1990 Yamada et al. showed for the first time structural phase transition and electrical conductivity of mixed-metal halide peovskite MASn1−xPbxBr3, while recently, Ogomi et al. reported photovoltaic performances of the first all solid-state Sn/Pb mixed perovskite solar cells. It is interesting to note that pure Sn halide perovskite itself did not show photovoltaic properties until PbI2 was added to SnI2. The best performance was obtained by using MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite and a 4.18% efficiency with an open circuit voltage of 0.42 V, fill factor of 0.50, and short circuit current of 20.04 mA cm−2 was reported. Though the PCE of the device based on mixed-metal halide peovskite is quite ordinary, due to the fact that this new perovskite can harvest the light up to 1060 nm, it can be useful in bottom cells for tandem perovskite solar cells (Fig. 11).
It is necessary to mention that besides spiro-OMeTAD, a broad variety of HTMs such as poly-(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), poly[N-9′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), PTAA, pyrene arylamine, CuI, CuSCN, etc. have also been tested with interesting results.

Methyl ammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3) is one of the earliest studied halide perovskite materials for solar cell absorbers and has the reputation of giving higher VOC compared to its triiodide counterparts due to its lower HOMO level, although the light harvesting ability is much weaker (Fig. 12a). After the first report in 2009 with a VOC of 0.96 V, MAPbBr3 has been used by several groups for solar cell absorbers. First by Cai et al. and Noh et al., using conjugated polymers PCBTDPP or PTAA respectively as the HTM, the cells gave a high VOC of 1.16 V (ref. 93) and 1.13 V. Finally, Edri and co-workers reported that higher VOC up to 1.3 V (ref. 52) can be obtained by using a MAPbBr3-coated alumina scaffold as absorber/electron conductors and PDI where the HOMO level has lower energy in relation to the vacuum level as the HTM (Fig. 12b). However, the PCE of these cells are very poor (<4%) due to the short light absorption range and therefore low JSC.


The first mixed halide perovskite MAPbI3−xClx was developed by Snaith and coworkers and applied to a nonelectron injecting, mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold layer by spin-coating the mixture solution of MAI and PbCl2 in the 3:1 ratio, resulting in the so-called “meso-superstructured” solar cell. (eqn (1)) It is expected that the perovskite material MAPbI3 and the byproduct MACl may form at the same time in the deposited thin film. However, according to XRD patterns, no sign of MACl exists inside the films and crystals of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx are identical. One hypothesis is that most of the excess organic MACl is sublimed leaving only traces of Cl in the MAPbI3 lattice. During the annealing procedure, the crystallization process of perovskite is accompanied by this sublimation of MACl, which will have an impact on the phase transformation control. That is why the formula MAPbI3−xClx is used to show the uncertainty of the Cl content.

3MAI + PbCl2 → MAPbI3−xClx + 2MACl (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)
(1)
MAPbI3−xClx can be seen as I− ions in MAPbI3 are partially substituted by the Cl− ion. The Cl− doping will induce lattice distortion and the excess organic phase can prolong the crystallization process. This is evidenced by the increased time necessary to fully anneal deposited films, specifically less than 1 h for pure iodine perovskite and between 2 and 3 h for the mixed halide perovskite. More significantly, this doping increases the environmental stability of the perovskite film and the conductivity as well as the charge diffusion length (∼1 μm) of the perovskite domain without affecting its optical properties. After the success in achieving a 11% PCE with MAPbI3−xClx in a “meso-superstructured” solar cell, the trajectory of H. Snaith's team turned out to be twofold: firstly, they developed low-temperature processing routes for the m-Al2O3 scaffold and a compact TiO2 layer to be compatible with low cost fabrication on a flexible organic substrate; secondly, in their following seminal reports, they aimed at further reducing complexity and ultimately returning to the very essentials of planar heterojunction solar cells by getting rid of the mesoporous scaffold without sacrificing efficiency. Following these two tracks, fabulous JSC (>20 mA cm−1), VOC (>1 V) together with PCE (15.4%–15.9%) values have been achieved and the position of organometal halide perovskite in the field of photovoltaic industry has been consolidated (Fig. 6c, d and f) (Table 1).
Mixed-halide perovskite MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) has been made by either a one step deposition or two-step sequential deposition process. Although Noh claims that when x = 0.2 the stability of the device (μ > 10%) was greatly improved, in contrast to the Cl− ion doping in MAPbI3, the inclusion of Br− cannot bring much gain in the photovoltaic performance but rather the opposite effect with the increase of the Br− ratio (Table 1).
The newest mixed-halide perovskite is MAPbBr3−xClx, which gave an extraordinarily high VOC of 1.5 V. Edri et al. found that adding Cl to the MAPbBr3 to yield MAPbBr3−xClx improves the surface coverage and therefore increases the VOC, FF, and, especially, the JSC. Again, as is the case for the better-studied iodide analogue, no Cl is detected in the film by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Table 1).

Besides the excellent PV performance of the organometal halide perovskite, the title compound is also attractive because of its versatility in fabrication techniques. So far there have been four different film deposition methods reported: one-step precursor solution deposition; two-step sequential deposition; dual-source vapor deposition and vapor assisted solution process. All the first three methods have given efficiencies above 15% and been applied in fabricating perovskite solar cells on the organic flexible substrate based on the low temperature processing technique (Table 1) (Fig. 13). At the same time, methods to fabricate perovskite nanoparticles have been reported via template assisted or template-free protocols.


One-step precursor solution deposition represents the most popular thin film deposition method for perovskite solar cells due to its obvious simplicity (Fig. 13a). Generally, the precursor solution of perovskite is prepared by mixing the powder of RAX (R: methyl, formamidine; X: I, Br) and PbX2 (X: I, Br, Cl) at the 1:1 (stoichiometry) or 3:1 (non-stoichiometry) mole ratio in high boiling point aprotic polar solvents (DMF, DMAc, DMSO, NMP, GBL, etc.) at elevated temperature for several hours to get a clear solution. This solution is then used for the in situ formation of organometal halide perovskite by spin-casting or drop-casting on a n-type contact layer. Normally, an annealing process is needed for the complete transformation of the precursor to the perovskite crystalline film. After that a layer of HTM (e.g. spiro-OMeTAD) is deposited on top. With this fabrication technique several parameters could be tuned to further optimize the device performance e.g. thickness of c-TiO2, thickness of m-TiO2 or m-Al2O3, concentration of precursor solution, solvent type, thickness of the perovskite layer, annealing temperature and time as well as the thickness of the HTM layer. So far the cell with the reported highest PCE record (15.9%) has been achieved via the one-step precursor solution deposition method.


The two-step sequential deposition method (originally developed by Mitzi et al.) was first used by Burschka et al. to fabricate a perovskite thin film in a solar cell (Fig. 13b). In a typical sequential deposition procedure, the PbI2 is first spin-coated from solution in DMF onto the nanoporous titania film and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by dipping into a solution of MAI in iso-propanol. The perovskite formation is instantaneous within the nanoporous host upon contacting the two components. After annealing, spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM was subsequently deposited by spin-coating. The two-step sequential procedure allows much better control over the perovskite morphology compared to the one-step deposition method by allowing better confinement of PbI2 into the nanoporous network of TiO2. Employing this technique for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly improves the reproducibility of their performance, and allows achieving the first perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 15% and the highest PCE of a HTM free perovskite cell (Fig. 6b) (Table 1). This finding opens up completely new opportunities for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaics with high power conversion efficiencies and stability that matches or even exceeds those of today's best thin film photovoltaic devices. With this aim in mind, Pellet et al. fabricated highly efficient devices with a mixed-cation perovskite following the sequential deposition procedure. At the same time, Liu et al. made a planar heterojunction cell and realized a PCE of 15.7%, when he replaced the c-TiO2 and m-TiO2 layers by a single c-ZnO blocking layer but kept the rest of the steps almost the same as those in the work of Burschka (Fig. 6e).


Preparation of the perovskite thin film under vacuum by vapor deposition process was first reported by Salau and then by Mitzi. In 2013, Liu et al. modified the deposition condition and used a dual-source vapor deposition technique to prepare the thin film of mixed-halide perovskite as the absorbing layer in a planar heterojunction solar cell (Fig. 13c). It was demonstrated that vapor-deposited perovskite films were extremely uniform with crystalline platelets at the nanometer scale while solution-processed films only partially covered the substrate containing voids between the micrometer-sized crystalline platelets which extend directly to the compact TiO2-coated FTO glass. The authors claimed that superior uniformity of the coated perovskite films without any pin-holes was the reason for the record efficiency of 15.4% (Fig. 6c). Later on, the same method was used by Bolink and his colleagues to construct an inverted thin film solar cell with a sublimated MAPbI3 perovskite layer sandwiched between two very thin electron (polyTPD) and hole blocking layers (PCBM) consisting of organic molecules. In this structure, which is typical for organic-photovoltaic and light-emitting devices, an organic transparent conductor (PEDOT:PSS) was used as the positive charge collecting contact. Remarkably, a high VOC of 1.05 V and PCE of 12% were achieved, which together with the planar heterojunction device geometry indicated the possibility of applying it to a flexible solar module (Table 1).


Yang and his colleagues reported a novel low-temperature approach for the deposition of a perovskite absorbing layer called the Vapor-Assisted Solution Process (VASP) which is like a combination of SDM and DSVD. In this process, PbI2 films were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with a compact layer of TiO2 (c-TiO2), followed by annealing in MAI vapor at 150 °C in a N2 atmosphere for 2 h to form the perovskite films (Fig. 13d). The perovskite film derived from this approach exhibits full surface coverage, uniform grain structure with grain size up to micrometers, and 100% precursor transformation completeness. A film evolution study on perovskite transformation indicated an appropriate rearrangement of the PbI2 film during intercalation of MAI driven by the reduction of grain boundary energy. Facilitated by the excellent film quality, the MAPbI3 materials enabled an impressive device PCE of 12.1% in a planar architecture. VASP presents a simple, controllable, and versatile approach to the pursuit of high-quality perovskite film and the resulting high-performance PV devices. The author believed that incorporation of organic species into the as-deposited inorganic framework through vapor effectively avoids the high reaction rate of perovskite during co-deposition of precursors (OSPDs) and concern about possible film deterioration when dipping an inorganic framework into an organic species solution (SDM).


Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit some differences with their most immediate predecessors, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For example, similar PCEs have been achieved in devices employing mesoporous TiO2, nanostructured Al2O3 (ZrO2), or even no mesoporous scaffold at all; while DSSCs cannot perform well without using a conductive and mesoporous scaffold to deposit the sensitizer and collect the photocurrent. On the other hand, cells with significant efficiency have been produced with even no hole-transporting media. All these different functioning device geometries highlight the importance of understanding the effect of selective contacts in efficient charge separation (Table 2).

Different from sensitizers used in a DSSC, perovskite itself can accumulate charge, a property which will have significant influence on the final device structure. In a typical PSC, the most commonly used selective contact materials for electrons and holes are compact TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Nevertheless, finding another selective hole contact is one of the hottest branch topics about PSCs. Different low HOMO molecules and polymers and also inorganic CuI (ref. 125) and CuSCN (ref. 128) have been used as hole-selective contacts and some of them showed comparable performance to that of spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, a much smaller variety of materials has been checked as an alternative electron-selective contact: C60/PCBM, graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites, nanocrystalline anatase/rutile TiO2 (ref. 83) and ZnO (ref. 46) are some of the few examples. More recent reports also described the so-called inverted cell structure (light first passes through the hole selective contact instead of the electron selective contact) with a perovskite layer sandwiched between PCBM and PEDOT:PSS and PSC on a flexible substrate with low temperature processed a ZnO electron selective contact. For the same purpose, Yella et al. also demonstrated low temperature deposition of a nanocrystalline TiO2 (rutile) hole-blocking layer on a FTO conducting glass substrate via hydrolysis of TiCl4 at 70 °C, forming the electron selective contact with the photoactive MAPbI3 film. A collection of energy level alignments for different materials commonly used in PSCs are shown in Fig. 14.
Juárez-Pérez et al., have studied the role of the selective contacts in PSCs by impedance spectroscopy (IS) and found that three major roles were played by it: transport resistance at the selector layer, charge-transfer rate at the interface (that could affect the bulk carrier density and consequently bulk recombination), and the surface recombination at the selective contact interface. It has been found that the nature of both electron and hole selective contacts contribute to the enhancement of the cell FF, while the hole-selective contact is mainly responsible for the high VOC. For example, judiciously selected combination of the inert scaffold with perovskites and low HOMO HTM, e.g. ZrO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD, Al2O3/MAPbBr3/N,N′-dialkylperylenediimide (PDI) and Al2O3/MAPbBr3−xClx/4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP) showed record VOCs updating continuously from 1.07 V to 1.3 V and finally 1.5 V (Table 1).

The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. However, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying such exceptional performance has not grown at the same pace. Due to the fact that high power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures, controversies exist and questions are open on a series of topics: the necessity of the n-type meso-porous layer (is electron injection necessary?); sensitized or a heterojunction solar cell; low exciton binding energy (30–50 mV) (selective contact device?); the role of the HTM layer (direct contact between Au and perovskite), etc. (Fig. 15). Focusing on the two necessary and successive processes for photovoltaic conversions: accumulation of a photogenerated charge and charge separation, much effort is under way to characterize these different processes occurring in the perovskite layer measuring the diffusion length (LD) in ad hoc prepared samples or complete devices and the lifetime.

It is known that organometal halide perovskites work both as the absorber and ambipolar charge transporter. So to find out the necessity of the n-type mesoporous layer, Moser and his colleagues used time-resolved techniques to study the kinetics of interfacial electron transfer processes of the MAPbI3 film on TiO2 and Al2O3. Using ultrafast spectroscopy in the near-infrared, they were able to monitor transient absorption by photogenerated charges in the perovskite. Primary charge separation occurs at both selective contacts, with TiO2 and the hole-transporting material, simultaneously, with ultrafast electron and hole injection taking place from the photoexcited perovskite over similar timescales. However, charge recombination is shown to be significantly slower on TiO2 than on Al2O3 films.
Snaith and colleagues and Nripan Mathew with collaborators independently reported on diffusion-length measurements performed on hybrid perovskites, which shed light on the dynamics of photoexcited species (excitons or charge carriers) in these materials. Both teams used photoluminescence quenching experiments to measure the electron–hole diffusion length. They deposited on top of a perovskite thin-film a layer of quenching molecules, which act as a sink for the photoexcited species that, travelling in the film, reach the interface between the perovskite and the quencher. The photoluminescence dynamics of the material under study are therefore dependent on the thickness of the thin film and on the LD of the photoexcitations, the latter of which can be extracted by modelling the photoluminescence decay curves according to a simple one-dimensional diffusion equation. Both teams obtain a LD of about 100 nm for electrons and holes in MAPbI3. Furthermore, the group of Snaith also investigated the mixed-halide perovskite MAPbI3−xClx, obtaining in this case a LD exceeding 1 μm. This high value reinforces hope for the future of hybrid perovskite solar cells, because it makes possible the fabrication of devices with thicker active layers, where the absorption of light can be increased without affecting the collection efficiency of the generated charges. Edri et al. further developed this observation by studying electron beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging of cross-sections of flat cells based on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx respectively and found that the LD of electrons is shorter than that of holes (Leff, e−/Leff, h+ < 1) in MAPbI3, with the latter being at least 1 μm. They believe that this could explain why MAPbI3-based cells require mesoporous electron-selective contacts, while MAPbI3−xClx ones, where LD values are comparable for both charge types, do not.
On the other hand, impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out to study the transport coupled with the recombination process in perovskite solar cells. Gonzalez-Pedro et al. found that a large diffusion length is achieved in the compact film of MAPbI3−xClx, while the metal oxide nanostructure increases the LD of MAPbI3 perovskite. For the first time, they reported the measurement of the diffusion length in a nanostructured perovskite solar cell. Their model and conclusion are in good agreement with the above mentioned results for thin film MAPbI3−xClx measured by Snaith et al. and Edri et al. but with a completely different technique.
The necessity of a hole-selective contact was also studied by fabricating depleted hole conductor free MAPbI3/TiO2/Au solar cells. Etgar et al. performed capacitance voltage measurements and observed the self-doping density of the MAPbI3 as well as the depletion layer which extends to both sides, the mesoporous TiO2 film and the MAPbI3 layer. The built-in field of the depletion region assists in the charge separation and suppresses the back recombination of electrons from the TiO2 film to the MAPbI3 film. Meanwhile, Shi et al. observed a linear relationship between JSC and light intensity in a similar cell, which means that carriers can transport smoothly in the semiconductors and there is no obvious difference in the transport velocity between electrons and holes. It is in agreement with the above mentioned results of carrier diffusion constants of MAPbI3 by Snaith et al. and previous experimental results in the literature. The above analyses reveal that TiO2/MAPbI3/Au is a typical heterojunction solar cell, in which the n-type wide-band-gap TiO2 acts as a window layer, and the MAPbI3 acts as an absorber layer.

This minireview has unraveled an underexplored eclectic class of materials, hybrid oxide/halide perovskites, following the timeline and highlighted the state-of-the-art for its application in solar cells from the perspectives of material science and device engineering. The utilization of these hybrid perovskites offers both the advantages of the organic compounds, such as solution processability and optical property tunability, and those of the inorganic crystalline semiconductors, like high charge mobilities and large absorption coefficients. It is not often that such a ‘dirty cheap’ and easily available material can perform all the three basic tasks required in solar cell operation, that is, light absorption, carrier generation, and ambipolar transport. The unique combination of all these advantages has signified a field breakthrough during the last two years, allowing novel device layouts leading to record performances from just a few percent in a forerunner of perovskite cells to more than 19%, leaving the conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics far behind and holding the promise of cost effective solar energy production.

In addition to further optimizing the morphology of the known perovskite absorber (thickness and homogeneousity) and finding an even better HTM with higher mobility and HOMO of over 5 eV, one can also look in to the possibility of atomistic modification of the perovskite. Hybrid perovskites have been shown to exhibit spontaneous electric polarization, which can be tuned through the judicious choice of the organic cations with different dipole moments (e.g. NH3CH3 < NH3CH3F < NH3CHF2 < NH3CF3). The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. Studies have shown that when the perovskite is introduced into a TiO2 mesoporous structure, electron injection from perovskite to the metal oxide is efficient in less than a picosecond but the lower intrinsic electron mobility of TiO2 leads to unbalanced charge transport. Therefore finding a metal oxide with higher electron mobility and fermi level may further increase the performance of this class of solar cells. In the case of MAPbI3 perovskite with a band gap of 1.57 eV (corresponding to an onset of light absorption is ca. 790 nm), a short circuit current density (JSC) of 28 mA cm−2 is theoretically achievable. To date, VOC, FF and JSC values of 1.1 V, 0.7 and 21 mA cm−2, respectively, have already been achieved. If we take into account the perovskite film absorption in the range 400–800 nm and 85% of IPCE is achievable, a short circuit current of 24 mA cm−2 is thermodynamically achievable and with the FF of 0.8, the power conversion efficiency could be as high as 21%. Realizing 0.8 FF is possible by suppressing effectively the recombination by engineering the selective contacts and optimizing doping of the HTM.
One drawback of perovskite-based solar cells is the use of lead, which in combination with another weak point – water sensitivity – will undermine the credit earned by the excellent PV performance. Therefore there is a drive to replace Pb2+ with a less toxic element such as Sn2+, Cu2+ or Fe2+ as one of the obvious candidates or completely move on to perovskite oxide derivatives. Considering the oxygen sensitivity of Sn2+ and Fe2+, perovskite oxide may be a better option. As a promising representative, a doped ferroelectric BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3−δ (BNNO) with a band gap as low as 1.1 eV has already been reported. Ab initio calculations are needed as guidance to identify newer families of photovoltaic perovskites.
Similar to other relatively young photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells can be fashioned using common wet chemistry techniques. The simplicity of making solar-cell components via liquid-phase chemical reactions and depositing the materials by methods such as spraying, screen-printing and ink-jet printing may make it possible for solar-cell manufacturers to eventually replace clean rooms and sophisticated manufacturing equipment with simple bench top processes. The fast-paced improvement, which has not shown signs of slowing, coupled with inexpensive materials and preparation methods, prompts a new paradigm. It will not be an exaggeration that one day perovskite based solar cells can match the capability and capacity of their arch rival silicon and power our planet.
