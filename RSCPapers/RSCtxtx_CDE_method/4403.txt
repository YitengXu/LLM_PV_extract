An efficient synthesis of N-(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-N-(4-bromophenyl)-2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine (BPTPA donor, 5) was developed based on a new 4-step synthetic route. The BPTPA donor is used to quickly access two new sensitizers: NT35 and G220, which both exhibit greater IPCE response with cobalt-based redox shuttles, compared to the classical iodide/triiodide electrolyte. A reference sensitizer, G221, comprising only a TPA unit as the donor and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor/anchor unit, was also realized for comparative purposes. The devices consisting of the sensitizers bearing the BPTPA donor and cobalt-based redox shuttles showed the highest Jsc, Voc and IPCE spectra response compared to G221. The BPTPA donor is shown to efficiently suppress the electron recombination between the TiO2 surface and the redox shuttle yielding high Voc values. Among these sensitizers, G220 showed the best photovoltaic performance having a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 9.06% under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions. These results demonstrate that organic sensitizers based on this bulky BPTPA donor are promising candidates for cobalt-based DSSCs.

Donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) organic dyes for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been the subject of much academic and industrial research, owing to their wide variety, high molar extinction coefficients and potentially low cost of fabrication compared with ruthenium dye sensitizers. Among the various organic donors, e.g., triphenylamine, coumarin, indoline, fulvenyl, and 4H-pyran-4-ylidene, that have been explored in DSSCs, triphenylamine (TPA) and its derivatives are the most utilized. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the TPA unit is expected to confine the cationic charge away from the semiconductor surface and efficiently hamper charge recombination. The TPA unit also possesses steric properties that may prevent unfavorable dye aggregation at the semiconductor surface. Additionally, it is found that among the reported organic sensitizers for liquid electrolyte based DSSCs, those based on the TPA moiety are more suitable for solid state DSSCs, due to the excellent electron-donating nature and non-planar configuration of TPA. The intrinsic hole conducting capability of the TPA units can improve the wetting of spiro-OMeTAD resulting in fast charge transfer in solid state DSSCs. Structure modification has further brought vitality to TPA units as a donor fragment, e.g. alkyl or alkoxy substitution, fusion of aromatic rings, planarization,etc.

Besides the classic iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox shuttle, and among the many new redox species under study, divalent/trivalent cobalt bipyridine complexes ([Co(bpy)3]3+/2+) exhibit the most impressive performance. The advantages of using a cobalt-based redox shuttle as an electrolyte include variability of the chemical structure, tunability of the redox potential and transparency to visible light. Despite these merits, however, after the first report in 2001 by Nusbaumer et al. few papers have been published on cobalt complex redox shuttles in DSSCs, mainly due to the lack of proper sensitizer compatibility with the new electrolyte: it has been shown that when the cobalt-based electrolytes were tested with sensitizers that performed well with I−/I3−, the efficiencies achieved were rather poor in comparison. Only a few examples have been shown where a sensitizer gave improved efficiency in a cobalt-based electrolyte compared to that of an iodide/triiodide electrolyte.
Recently, one D–π–A dye coded D35 was designed and synthesized by Sun and Hagfeldt (Fig. 1). Modification of the base TPA donor with bis(2,4-dibutoxyl)benzene substitution provides a bulkier and slightly less strongly donating group than the base TPA. Hagfeldt et al. have found that D35 performed very well with cobalt-based redox shuttles because of the efficient suppression of recombination by the extra bulky bis(alkyloxy)phenyl on the TPA moiety with overall conversion efficiencies of 6.7% compared to 6.0%. To further explore the validity of the so-called BPTPA donor (shown as a bold structure in Fig. 1), our group further synthesized dye Y123 with much extended spectral response compared to D35. Therefore the dye afforded an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.8% with the cobalt-based redox shuttle, and further improvement to 10% by optimizing the TiO2 mesoporous film and the use of a new cobalt bipyridine pyrazole electrolyte. Later on, Y123 was applied as a cosensitizer with a porphyrin chromophore to yield the record efficiency of 12.3%, used in conjunction with the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox couple. All these examples indicated that the D–π–A dyes with the BPTPA donor are compatible with cobalt-based redox mediators, which are promising alternatives to the I3−/I− redox couple for large-scale manufacturing of DSSCs, for the reasons mentioned above.
Until now, the synthesis of D–π–A dyes comprising the BPTPA donor has been proceeded via two different routes. The first route involves in situ installation of the donor moiety while the second one requires pre-synthesis of the donor before it is connected to the desired π-bridge. The utilization of the first route is confined to only a few stable intermediate compounds. Although the pre-made BPTPA donor is easily popularized and readily used with high versatility, the current synthetic route towards the pre-made donor is, however, expensive and tedious, limiting wide-spread adoption.
For the purpose of a convenient synthesis and scale up of the BPTPA donor, in this work, we report a newly designed synthetic route towards the donor moiety before it is applied to the construct of new sensitizers. To further widen the scope of this donor group, (E)-3-(4-(bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amino)phenyl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (NT35) and (E)-3-(6-(4-(bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amino)phenyl)-4,4-di-dodecyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-2-cyano-acrylic acid (G220) were synthesized bearing the same BPTPA donor and cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor and anchoring group. The performances of these dyes with the cobalt redox shuttle were systematically studied and compared to those with the I−/I3− redox couple. To show the effectiveness of the BPTPA donor towards hampering the recombination rate in both electrolytes (a loss mechanism), a simple version of NT35, (E)-3-(4-(bis(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (G221), was also synthesized, according to a reported similar procedure (Fig. 2).

A screen-printed double layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles was used as the photoelectrode. The FTO glass plates were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A 7 microns thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was then printed on the FTO conducting glass and further coated with a 4 microns thick second layer of 400 nm light-scattering TiO2 particles (400 nm diameter, Catalysts & Chemicals Ind. Co. Ltd. (CCIC), HPW-400). Sintering was carried out at 500 °C for 15 min, which was gradually heated. The films were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 0.1 mM solution of dyes in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) for 15 h at room temperature. To prepare the counter electrode, Pt catalyst was deposited on cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (10 mM in 2-propanol solution) with heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. For the assembly of DSSCs, the dye-containing TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 microns thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (Dupont). The redox electrolyte was placed in a drilled hole in the counter electrode, and was driven into the cell by means of vacuum backfilling. Two types of electrolytes were used for device evaluation, in which JH34 was composed of 0.6 M DMII, 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.25 M TBP, 0.05 M GuNCS as the iodine electrolyte, and JH180 was composed of 0.22 M Co2+, 0.05 M Co3+, 0.1 M LiClO4, 0.2 M TBP as the cobalt electrolyte. Finally, the hole was sealed using Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness).


Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel, USA). The spectral output of the lamp was matched in the region of 350–750 nm with the aid of a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH, Germany) so as to reduce the mismatch between the simulated and true solar spectra to less than 4%. I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step 10 mV was kept and the delay time of the photocurrent was 40 ms and 80 ms for iodine based and cobalt based electrolyte, respectively. The photocurrent action spectra were recorded with an Incident Photon-to-Current conversion Efficiency (IPCE) test system. The modulation frequency used was about 2 Hz and light from a 300 W Xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) was focused through a computer controlled Gemini-180 double monochromator (John Yvon Ltd., UK). A white light bias was used to bring the total light intensity on the device under testing closer to operating conditions. The devices were masked to attain an illuminated active area of 0.2 cm2.


Photovoltage transients were observed by using a pump pulse generated by four red light emitting diodes controlled by a fast solid-state switch with a white light bias. The pulse of red light with widths of 100 ms was incident on the photoanode side of the cell, and its intensity was controlled to keep a suitably low level to generate the exponential voltage decay where the charge recombination rate constants are obtained directly from the exponential decay rate. A white bias light, also incident on the same side of the device, was supplied by white diodes. Small perturbation transient photocurrent measurements were performed in a similar manner to the open-circuit voltage decay measurement.


The uniqueness of the BPTPA donor lies in the two additional bis(2,4-dialkoxy)benzene substitutes on the base TPA structure, which may not only improve the solubility, but also decrease electron recombination and enhance the open circuit voltage, especially in the presence of cobalt-based redox shuttles. One improved synthetic route to BPTPA donor 6 is depicted in Scheme 1. Starting from cheap chlororesorcinol, hexyl chains were introduced through nucleophilic substitution. Then, the arylchloride undergoes ipso substitution with pinacol boronic ester (BPin) utilizing the Buchwald catalyst system to yield compound 2. Through the Suzuki reactions between 2 and bis(4-bromophenyl)amine, this route leads to BPDPA donor 3, which can be converted to standard BPTPA donor 5via a CuI catalyzed amination reaction in high yield. By adopting the new route, the overall yield of 5 increases to 63% over four steps compared to 11% over six steps via the old synthetic route. After the conversion of 5 to its BPin derivative 6, a Suzuki coupling reaction with 6-bromo-4,4-didodecyl-cyclopentadithiophene-2-carbaldehyde yields the aldehyde precursor 7. Finally, the conventional Knoevenagel condensation yielded dye G220 with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine. The conjugation length can be further tailored by reacting compound 3 with 4-bromobenzaldehyde to afford monoaldehyde precursors 4. In the end, a shortened and thiophene-free version of D35 coded NT35 was obtained following the same reaction conditions as for making G220. From a structural point of view, NT35 is like the BPTPA donor itself, with only and additional electron acceptor/anchor. When the thiophene in D35 is replaced by an alkylated cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), G220 is synthesized. For comparison, G221 with simple TPA connection directly to the acceptor/anchor group was also synthesized (compare NT35 and G221) (Scheme 2). These dyes and their precursor compounds are well soluble in common organic solvents (i.e., chloroform, DMF, and THF). The structure and purity of the four compounds were confirmed by standard spectroscopic methods.


The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three dyes (NT35, G220 and G221) in CH2Cl2 solutions are shown in Fig. 3, and their absorption peaks as well as their extinction coefficients are summarized in Table 1. According to the UV-Vis spectra, these dyes exhibit two major prominent bands, appearing at ca. 300–380 nm and ca. 400–650 nm respectively. The absorption bands in the UV region can be assigned to a localized aromatic π–π* transition, while the absorption bands in the visible region originate from an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between the triphenylamine donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. For the charge-transfer band, the absorption maxima vary according to different donor substitution and conjugated bridges (441 nm for G221, 451 nm for NT35 and 542 nm for G220). The absorption of NT35 with the BPTPA donor is 10 nm red shifted than that of G221 with the base TPA unit. Compared with G221 and NT35, the absorption band of G220 shows a considerable red-shift (91 nm) due to the greater conjugation length of the CPDT unit in the π-bridge of this dye, which further decreases the band gap by raising the HOMO and results in a broader ICT absorption. This trend illustrates that the modulation of the optical band-gaps and energy levels of these sensitizers can be partly achieved by altering the electronic nature of the π-conjugation bridges.

To estimate the HOMO level of the dyes, cyclic voltammetry was employed using a three-electrode cell with 0.1 M TBAPF6 in CH2Cl2 as the supporting electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) diagrams of the dyes are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1.

It is shown that the first oxidation potentials (Eox) corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the dyes (NT35: 1.11 V, G220: 0.90 V and G221: 1.04 V vs. NHE) are sufficiently more positive than the I−/I3− redox potential value (∼0.35 V vs. NHE) and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox potential value (∼0.49 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dyes formed after electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 should be efficiently regenerated by means of reduction by the redox shuttles (i.e. there is enough driving force thermodynamically).
Except for G221, two oxidation waves were generally observed in the voltammograms. The first quasi-reversible oxidation wave at lower oxidation potentials is attributed to the triphenylamine, whereas the higher oxidation potentials with quasi-reversible behavior were from the respective π-bridges. G220 has the lowest oxidation potential because the oxidized triphenylamine can be stabilized by the π-extended CPDT unit nearby, and the highest oxidation potential of G221 is ascribed to the lack of both bis(hexyloxy)benzene and a π-bridge. Lower oxidation potentials indicate that the HOMO rises upon the introduction of stronger electron donating moieties, which agrees well with the molecular structure. The reduction potentials corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these dyes (described as Ered = Eox − E0–0, see Table 1) were more negative than Ecb (conduction band edge energy level) of the TiO2 electrode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE), hence, an effective electron transfer is energetically possible from the excited dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2.
To scrutinize the electronic properties of these dyes further, the optimized structures of NT35, G220 and G221 were determined by energy minimization with density functional theory (DFT) at the M06/6-31G* level in an SMD (methylene chloride) solvation model. HOMO and LUMO orbital distributions are shown in Fig. S1. In all four dyes, the HOMO orbital density is primarily located on the π-framework of the donor (TPA), whereas the orbital density of the LUMO is primarily extended throughout the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor and the neighboring π-bridges. Thus, a strong spatial relocation and distancing of electron density from HOMO to LUMO is expected for the π–π* CT transition, ensuring vectorial electron transfer and a strong coupling of the dye excited state with the semiconductor surface.

To compare the performance of the synthesized dyes in the Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte and the I−/I3− redox system, and hence to evaluate the efficacy of the BPTPA donor with cobalt-based redox shuttles, DSSCs with these two redox shuttles were fabricated for each dye with the same double-layer TiO2 as the photoanode and Pt-coated glass as the counter electrode.


Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for DSSCs based on these dyes in Co2+/Co3+ and I−/I3− redox couples. As is shown in Fig. 6a, with the I−/I3− redox shuttle, the solar cells based on NT35 and G221 show similar spectral responses and high IPCEs above 80% in the range from 450 to 510 nm. Meanwhile, although much broader absorption was observed with G220, its IPCE value is almost completely lower than 80% in the range of 400–680 nm. Such a broader spectral response of G220 is consistent with the trend of the absorption spectra, implying that it possesses better light harvesting ability for long-wavelength visible light, which would be attributed to the larger CPDT π-system. At the same time, when all the parameters are kept constant except that the electrolyte is changed to the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle, the IPCE spectral responses of the BPTPA donor substituted NT35 and especially G220 are greatly improved, particularly below 450 nm, possibly due to the lack of competitive light absorption by triiodide, which lowered the IPCE of the iodine system relative to that of the cobalt system (Fig. 6b). In contrast, the spectral response of G221 is much deteriorated, indicating that the G221 sensitized TiO2 electrode would generate the lowest conversion yield among the three dyes. Considering the only structural difference between G221 and NT35 lies in the BPTPA donor, this example directly indicates the compatibility of the BPTPA donor with the cobalt electrolyte, and how this donor generally engenders D–π–A sensitizers with this compatibility.

Fig. 5a and b show the current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated with NT35, G220 and G221 as sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions in cobalt- and iodide-based electrolytes respectively. The detailed output parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. In both redox systems, Jsc data are positively proportional to the absorption breadth of the sensitizer molecules. For example, the G220 dye has the broadest light harvesting range and consequently the highest Jsc. NT35 has higher Voc than that of G221 in both redox systems because the introduction of the bulky BPTPA donor can act as a barrier, preventing electrolyte from approaching the TiO2 surface, and thus inhibiting charge recombination, which is more dramatic with cobalt-based electrolytes.

For NT35 and G220, the Jsc values of the cells with the cobalt electrolyte were around 12% higher than that of the iodide/triiodide-based DSSCs. This increase was also reflected in the IPCE curves and could be ascribed to the lack of competitive light absorption by iodine electrolyte. It is noteworthy that the two dyes with the BPTPA donor (NT35 and G220) both have higher open circuit voltages (Voc) (928 mV and 868 mV) in the cobalt electrolyte than in the iodide/triiodide electrolyte (793 mV and 755 mV) measured under the same conditions and the increase is ascribed mainly to a 210 mV higher oxidation potential of the redox potential of the cobalt complex compared to an iodide system. In contrast, both the Jsc and Voc of the G221 cell with the cobalt-based redox shuttle are lower than those of the same cell with an iodide-based electrolyte system (Fig. 5, Table 2). This result is in agreement with previous investigations, and is interpreted by rapid recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with the Co3+ redox species. In this study, the BPTPA donor showed tangible effects towards solving this recombination problem. That is to say, by introducing the BPTPA donor, we can fully make use of the advantageously tunable redox potential of the cobalt-based electrolytes without worrying about the adverse charge recombination. Consequently, the cell based on the G220 dye showed the best photovoltaic performance in both iodide- (6.97%) and cobalt-based electrolytes (9.06%). With relatively lower Jsc, solar cells based on NT35 and G221 showed relatively inferior efficiencies (Table 2). This result indicates that the BPTPA donor is beneficial for cobalt-based DSSCs and provides a strategy to construct dye molecules that can work with iodine-free electrolytes as well as iodide-based electrolytes.
To provide a rationale for the origin of the different Voc shift behavior observed when employing cobalt- and iodide-based electrolytes, the dependence of TiO2 electron lifetimes on capacitance as recorded from photocurrent decay measurements for the investigated dyes was measured (Fig. 7). After introduction of the BPTPA donor, NT35- and G220-based DSSCs showed much longer electron lifetimes and no significant change in the electron lifetime in both cobalt- and iodide-based electrolytes, while iodide-based devices show slightly longer electron lifetimes, generally. By contrast, a striking difference is observed for the G221 dye, which showed the largest drop of electron lifetime with the cobalt-based electrolyte compared to iodide-based devices, indicating that the recombination reaction between the electrons on the TiO2 surface and the trivalent cobalt complex in the electrolyte was considerably faster than that of an iodide-based device. Furthermore, DSSCs based on the G221 dye in conjunction with the iodide-based electrolytes, on the other hand, showed the shortest electron lifetime among all the devices of the same type. This result is supported by the changes in the dark current with applied bias, which is indicative of the electron recombination rate with the electrolyte (Fig. 5). The onset of recombination current occurs at the lowest potential for G221 compared to the other two dyes in the cobalt electrolyte (Fig. 5b). The observed increase in the dark current density of G221 is essentially due to the inadequate suppression of Co3+ reduction to Co2+ at the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode, which is a result of inadequate surface protection by the sensitizing dye. Notably, the dyes with the BPTPA donor all exhibited relatively lower dark current density. To conclude, we developed a simple, practical approach to the construction of sensitizers compatible with cobalt-based redox shuttles and confirmed that the use of the BPTPA donor is ideal for suppressing the recombination reaction between the redox shuttle and the TiO2 surface, especially in cobalt-based DSSCs.

We have developed a simplified synthesis of the BPTPA donor from chlororesorcinol in an overall yield of 63% over only four steps for use as a DSSC donor unit. To further validate the compatibility of this donor group in working with the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle, two new organic D–π–A dyes NT35 and G220, both comprising the BPTPA donor, were synthesized and tested in both iodide- and cobalt-based electrolytes. G221, with just a TPA as the donor unit, was also conceived and synthesized for comparative reasons. The DSSC devices utilizing the sensitizers bearing the BPTPA donor in combination with the cobalt-based electrolyte showed higher Jsc, Voc and better visible light spectra response than that of the combinations with an iodide-based electrolyte. Compared with NT35, G221 without the BPTPA donor exhibited depreciated performance in both iodide- and cobalt-based electrolytes. This result, in combination with electron lifetime data, indicates that the BPTPA donor efficiently suppresses the electron recombination between the TiO2 surface and the redox oxide species. The DSSC made with G221 showed lower comparative Voc in a cobalt-based electrolyte than in an iodide-based electrolyte. With respect to NT35, the G220 dye with CPDT as the π-bridge, when combined with the cobalt electrolyte, evokes a dramatic red-shifted photocurrent response and the photovoltaic performance increases commensurately. Therefore, the G220 based device with the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ electrolyte shows the best PCE of 9.06% (Jsc = 14.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.87 V, FF = 0.71). In view of the excellent compatibility between the BPTPA donor with the cobalt electrolyte, it is believed that the much improved synthetic route makes it possible to scale up the production of iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cells, and that this donor will find use in many of the next-generation D–π–A sensitizers.
