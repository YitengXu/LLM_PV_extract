Bilayer organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells have been fabricated with chemical-bath deposited In2S3, SnS, and Sb2S3 interlayers between the organic P3HT hole-conducting and inorganic TiO2 electron-conducting layers. Sb has the highest electronegativity among the elements investigated, and the ionicity of the metal–sulfur bond decreases in the order In2S3 (15%) > SnS (9%) > Sb2S3 (7%). Thus, with a larger covalent character of the Sb–S bond, Sb may bond to S atoms on P3HT relatively easily compared to In or Sn. Such chemical bonding between Sb2S3 and P3HT may then reduce the overall incompatibility between the TiO2 and P3HT layers, making Sb2S3-based devices more efficient compared to In2S3- and SnS-based devices. Along with strong photon absorption, the presence of the metal–sulfur bond promotes improved wetting between the TiO2 sand P3HT layers, resulting in dual functionality for the metal sulfide interlayers. However, along with differences in metal–sulfur bond ionicity, the efficiency improvements seen with Sb2S3 can further be attributed to factors like differences in crystal structure, morphology, photon absorption, charge carrier recombination rates, and the manner in which the sulfide layer interacts with TiO2. While further studies are required to elucidate the exact reason behind the behavior of Sb2S3, the findings discussed herein can provide guidelines for identifying novel absorber layers for developing efficient and cost-effective organic–inorganic hybrid photovoltaics.

Organic–inorganic hybrid polymer solar cells are comprised of an active layer that typically combines organic light absorbing, hole-transporting polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with inorganic, electron-transporting semiconductors such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). It is widely reported that the complex interface between the organic and inorganic layers in hybrid polymer solar cells can affect charge separation and transfer, thus critically influencing photovoltaic properties. The power conversion efficiencies of this class of polymer solar cell have hence remained low compared to organic photovoltaic device efficiencies, which are fast approaching the 10% rubicon.

Recently, hybrid solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 5% have been reported. These remarkable device efficiencies were attributed to the presence of a metal sulfide absorber layer, namely antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3), between the organic P3HT and inorganic TiO2 layers. However, not all metal sulfides seem to work so well when incorporated into hybrid polymer solar cells. Several factors relating to the morphology and chemistry of the metal sulfide can influence how they behave when in contact with organics like P3HT. Devices fabricated with other metal sulfide layers like CdS and Cu2S have exhibited relatively reduced performance compared to Sb2S3-based devices. Employing resonance Raman spectroscopy, a recent report suggested that the bonding between thiophene moieties in P3HT and the Sb2S3 layer could play a role in the improved photovoltaic performance of Sb2S3-based hybrid solar cells. One possibility is that the Sb atom could bond with the S atoms of P3HT and form a bridge that facilitates charge transfer with the P3HT.
Sb is among the elements that can exhibit both metallic and non-metallic behavior mainly due to its proximity to the “staircase line” that separates metals and non-metals in the periodic table. Thus, the Sb–S bond is more covalent, and the Sb atoms can readily bond with the S atoms present in the thiophene rings of P3HT. Such an interaction could facilitate better interaction between the normally incompatible TiO2 and P3HT layers, thereby resulting in better devices. This hypothesis makes it necessary to study the plausible links between the metal ion of the sulfide, in particular the metal–sulfur bond ionicity, when exploring the use of metal sulfide layers in hybrid solar cells. In addition to the strong photon absorption provided by metal sulfides, the presence of metal–sulfur bonding can promote better wetting between the TiO2 and P3HT layers, resulting in a dual functionality for these metal sulfide layers.
As metal–sulfur bond ionicity is determined by the electronegativity of the metal, we evaluate the influence of bond ionicity on the photovoltaic properties by comparing the behavior of Sb2S3-based hybrid P3HT–TiO2 solar cells with those employing sulfides of metals in the same row as Sb but with varying electronegativities. Accordingly, we report here a systematic investigation of substituting Sb with less electronegative elements like In and Sn, which lie to the left side of Sb in the periodic table. Specifically, we find that replacing Sb2S3 absorber layers by In2S3 and SnS layers results in poorly performing devices compared to the devices with Sb2S3. Raman analysis carried out directly on the sulfide–polymer interface inside working devices suggests that the highly covalent character of the Sb–S bond can cause Sb to bond with the S atoms of the P3HT polymer with relative ease compared to In or Sn. The resulting reduction of surface incompatibility between the TiO2 and P3HT layers by the Sb2S3 layer could explain the improved performance of Sb2S3-based devices compared to other sulfides. Other factors like differences in crystal structure, morphology, photon absorption, charge carrier recombination rates, and the manner in which the sulfide layers interact with TiO2, could also contribute to the observed differences in photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, our results suggest that bond ionicity as a factor must not be overlooked and can serve as an additional guideline for identifying novel absorber layers that can improve hybrid solar cell performance beyond what is currently obtained with Sb2S3.

For synthesizing the TiO2 sol–gel, tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) [Ti(OC4H9)4] and 2,4-pentanedione raw materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals used in the chemical bath deposition (CBD) of the metal sulfide layers were also purchased from Alfa Aesar. Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was purchased from Rieke Metals and used without further purification. Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides of 10 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance were purchased from Nanocs (New York, NY) and cut into 1 × 1 in square pieces with a diamond pen. High purity (99.999%) gold (Au) wires used for thermal evaporation were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Tungsten wire baskets for thermal evaporation were purchased from Spi supplies.


TiO2 thin films were synthesized from the TBT precursor by a previously reported sol–gel method. Briefly, 10 mL of TBT was dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous ethanol under continuous stirring. After 30 min, 10 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) was added to stabilize the gel, 10 mL of 2,4-pentanedione was added for uniform particle size distribution, and finally 10 mL of de-ionized water was added to hydrolyze the gel. It is important to note that the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min before each solvent was added. The final sol was pale yellow in color and was aged for a week before use.


Previously cut ITO-coated glass substrates were first patterned by taping with polyimide tape and then slow etching (15–20 min) in a mixture of 7.5 mL of de-ionized water, 0.8 mL of HNO3, and 2.2 mL of HCl at 60 °C. The substrates were then rinsed with copious amounts of de-ionized water and cleaned by successive sonication (10 min each) in aqueous detergent (alconox), de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The cleaned substrates were dried in flowing nitrogen and immediately treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min inside a Harrick PDC-32G plasma cleaner operating at a medium RF power level.

The aged TiO2 sol–gel was then coated onto these cleaned substrates by spincoating at 3000 rpm for 20 s on a Chemat KW4A spincoater. In order to form the electron-transporting transparent thin film of anatase TiO2, these spincoated substrates were sintered in an air furnace at 450 °C for 120 min and cooled slowly to room temperature. The sintered TiO2 films were transparent with a thickness of around 100 nm, as measured by a Quanta 650 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The sintered TiO2-coated substrates were subsequently immersed in a chemical bath to deposit the bifunctional metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfide layer, as described subsequently. The metal sulfide films were sintered in a tube furnace at 300–330 °C for 30 min and cooled slowly to room temperature under a steady argon flow. It is important to purge the furnace tube for at least 2 h prior to heating to ensure removal of oxygen. While a temperature of around 300 °C was sufficient to grow crystalline In2S3 and SnS films, the Sb2S3 films required at least 330 °C to crystallize.
The metal sulfide-coated substrates were transferred into an argon-filled glovebox immediately after removing from the furnace. Then, 12–13 mg of P3HT was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene by stirring at 50 °C for 2 h inside the glovebox. The resulting solution was then filtered through a 0.20 μm pore size PTFE membrane syringe filter (Pall Life sciences). A hole transporting P3HT layer of 150 nm thickness was obtained by coating the P3HT solution onto the metal sulfide (In2S3, SnS or Sb2S3) coated substrates at a speed of 1500 rpm for 60 s. The P3HT–sulfide composites were created by melt infiltrating P3HT into the metal sulfide layer by heating at a temperature of 185 °C for 8 min. The substrates were then cooled slowly overnight. The hybrid solar cell devices were completed by depositing a 2 × 3 matrix of 150 nm thick Au electrodes. The evaporation was carried out at vacuum levels better than 10−7 Torr and a deposition rate of 1–2 Å s−1 inside a JEOL thermal evaporator, using Au wires hung on W wire baskets. The active area of the hybrid solar cells was 3 × 3 mm, as defined by a metal mask.
The chemical bath deposition of In2S3 films was performed inside a temperature-controlled bath maintained at 70 °C as previously reported. The reactive bath solution was prepared by the sequential addition of 10 ml of 0.1 M InCl3 (in de-ionized water), 20 ml of 0.5 M glacial acetic acid, and 20 ml of 1 M thioacetamide. Lastly, 50 mL of de-ionized water was added to bring the total solution volume to 100 ml. The pH of the final solution was ∼2.5. The TiO2-coated substrates were then placed vertically inside the bath. The film thickness was controlled by varying the deposition time. The films grew at deposition times as short as 1.5 h. The grown In2S3 films were light yellow in color and well adhered to the substrate. The films were washed with de-ionized water, dried in flowing nitrogen, sintered in a tube furnace at 300 °C for 30 min, and finally cooled slowly to room temperature under a steady argon flow. After sintering, the film color changed to a darker yellow.
A previously reported procedure was followed to deposit SnS films. Briefly, 1 g of SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved in 5 mL of acetone. Then, the following were added sequentially to the bath maintained at 75 °C: 6 mL of triethanolamine (TEA), 65 mL of de-ionized water, 8 mL of 1M thioacetamide (TA), and 10 mL of 4M ammonium hydroxide. Although many reports in the literature do not use TEA for SnS deposition, we found that it was difficult to grow well adhered films without using TEA. However, it is important to mix 6 mL of as-purchased (concentrated) TEA with 6 mL of de-ionized water before adding to the bath to prevent immediate precipitation inside the bath. The TiO2-coated substrates were then placed vertically inside the bath. The film thickness was controlled by varying the deposition time. The films grow at deposition times as short as 80 min. The grown SnS films were brown in color and well adhered to the substrate. The films were washed with de-ionized water, dried in flowing nitrogen, sintered in a tube furnace at 300 °C for 30 min, and finally cooled slowly to room temperature under a steady argon flow. After sintering, the film color changed to a darker brown.
Sb2S3 films were grown in a controlled chemical bath maintained at 4 °C inside a temperature controlled refrigeration chamber. A previously reported recipe was followed. Briefly, 0.65 g of SbCl3 was dissolved in 2.5 mL of acetone. Then, 25 mL of 1 M sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and 70 mL of de-ionized water were added sequentially to the bath. It must be noted that these solvents were refrigerated at 4 °C for several hours prior to being added to the bath. The TiO2-coated substrates were then placed vertically inside the bath, which was then immediately transferred to the refrigerator. The film thickness was controlled by varying the deposition time. The films grew at deposition times as short as 3 h. The grown Sb2S3 film was orange in color and well adhered to the substrate. The films were washed with de-ionized water, dried in flowing nitrogen, sintered in a tube furnace at 330 °C for 30 min, and finally cooled slowly to room temperature under a steady argon flow. After sintering, the film color changed to a brownish-black. Optimum device results were obtained when the Sb2S3 films were allowed to cool under argon until the temperature of the tube furnace reached ∼98 °C and then slowly cooled in air overnight.

SEM images were collected on a Quanta 650 SEM. Glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis of thin films was performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer operating in parallel beam (PB) mode at 40 kV and 44 mA with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in the 2θ range of 20 to 80° at a step size of 0.02° and a glancing angle of 0.5°. Raman spectra were acquired with a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope using 50% of the 50 mW 514.5 nm laser excitation at a 50× objective. X-Ray photoelectron (XPS) studies were conducted with a Kratos analytical spectrometer using monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The charging effect was corrected with the binding energy of adventitious C 1s signal at 284.8 eV. Absorption spectra of the metal sulfide layers on TiO2-coated ITO-glass substrates were measured with a Cary 5000 UV-VIS NIR spectrometer.

Solar cell current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under ambient conditions with a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. No UV blocking filter was used. Prior to testing, cells were stabilized by storing in air for up to 1 h in the dark. Light soaking was done for at least 10 min prior to data accumulation. The hybrid solar cells were illuminated from the ITO side using an Oriel 91160 300 W solar simulator as the excitation source (100 mW cm−2 white light illumination under AM 1.5G conditions). The solar cell test and measurement system was fully automated by in-house developed LabVIEW software. Photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) that determine the overall power conversion efficiency of a solar cell) were measured for a series of cells (6 cells on each substrate) and the values were found to be repeatable.

GIXRD patterns of metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfide films deposited onto TiO2-coated ITO-glass substrates are shown in Fig. 1a. GIXRD reveals the formation of cubic α (JCPDS Card file No. 05-0731) and cubic β (JCPDS Card file No. 32-0456) phases of In2S3 with a minor fraction of the tetragonal β phase (JCPDS Card file No. 25-0390). The reflections in Fig. 1b and 1c match the standard patterns for the minerals herzenbergite (SnS: JCPDS Card file No. 72-8499) and stibnite (Sb2S3: JCPDS Card file No. 06-0474), respectively. SEM images (ESI) indicate that these sulfide layers are around 200–250 nm thick. For the same thicknesses, In2S3, and SnS films appear to be less crystalline. The sol–gel-derived TiO2 films are anatase as previously reported.

One of the objectives of introducing a metal sulfide interlayer between TiO2 and P3HT is to enhance the overall photon absorption in hybrid solar cells. Fig. 2 compares the absorption spectra of the metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfide layers on TiO2-coated substrates. While all three sulfides are strong absorbers, In2S3 has a lower absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1 at 450 nm) compared to ∼105 cm−1 for both SnS and Sb2S3. Details regarding the calculation of absorption coefficients and direct band gaps of the sulfides are provided under sections 2 and 3 of the ESI. In2S3 shows the highest band gap (2.3 eV), which can partly account for the reduced absorption. Sb2S3 and SnS show comparable band gaps of 1.8 and 1.9 eV, respectively. The experimentally determined values for both absorption coefficients and band gaps are comparable to those reported previously for films grown under similar conditions.Fig. 3 compares the relative energy band alignment of the three metal sulfides with respect to P3HT and TiO2. Table 1 lists the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edges of the metal sulfides reported previously. Within a tolerance of ± 0.1 eV, these values suggest that electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band edge located at ∼4.2 eV is most favorable in the case of Sb2S3, but still possible in the case of SnS and In2S3. In other words, electron injection from Sb2S3 to TiO2 and P3HT to Sb2S3 is not considerably more favorable when compared to SnS and In2S3. It is, however, possible that more charge (electron) traps exist on the surfaces of In2S3 and SnS films compared to Sb2S3. Passivation of such traps by surface oxidation may reduce charge carrier recombination rates in Sb2S3, as discussed later.

To understand how different metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfide interlayers affect hybrid solar cell efficiency, we fabricated bilayer devices with well-defined interfaces between the inorganic TiO2 and metal sulfide layers and between the metal sulfide and organic P3HT layers, as depicted in Fig. 4a. These bilayer devices are easier to fabricate and simpler to analyze for the purposes of this study, compared to devices reported previously. The metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfide layers are also deposited by the facile CBD process, instead of using quantum dot based sulfides. The anatase sol–gel derived nanocrystalline TiO2 and spincoated P3HT layers are sandwiched between a transparent ITO electron-collecting electrode and a thermally evaporated Au hole-collecting electrode. With a metal sulfide layer as thick as 200–250 nm, it is likely that the metal sulfide performs the bulk of the absorption, which means that the P3HT layer behaves more like a passivation layer at the sulfide–Au interface, which also exhibits minor absorption.
The J–V characteristics of bilayer hybrid solar cells with and without the sulfide interlayers are compared in Fig. 4b, and the photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The performance of bilayer devices without metal sulfides are comparable to those previously reported. As indicated by the J–V curves shown in Fig. 4b, Jsc values > 6 mA cm−2 were obtained with Sb2S3-based devices compared to Jsc as low as 0.34 and 0.19 mA cm−2, respectively, for SnS- and In2S3-based devices. Additionally, reduced Voc and FF values for In2S3 and SnS devices resulted in orders of magnitude lower efficiency compared to that for the Sb3S3-based devices. In fact, the use of In2S3 and SnS layers degraded the device performances below that of bilayer P3HT-TiO2 devices without a sulfide layer, while Sb3S3-based devices exhibited an efficiency of 1.35%. The Voc values for Sb3S3-based devices are higher than those previously reported. The lower FF values compared to bilayer devices plausibly stem from a resistive loss associated with the thickness of the sulfide films. While thinner sulfide layers have been reported with mesoporous TiO2 layers, thicker sulfide films are needed with the denser sol–gel derived TiO2 layers used here, on account of the lower interfacial surface area of the latter.

While the devices in Fig. 4 are comprised of metal sulfide films of almost equal thickness (200–250 nm), Tables 3–5 track the photovoltaic parameters as the sulfide layer growth times are increased. As an increasing bath deposition time results in thicker sulfide films, Tables 3–5 indirectly track the photovoltaic parameters as the thickness of the sulfide layer increases. Device efficiency increases with increasing sulfide layer thickness for Sb3S3-based devices (Table 4). However, this trend peaks at a thickness of ∼250 nm and any further increases in growth time or film thickness deteriorates the device performance. This observation agrees with the previous reports about increased internal recombinations of charge carriers in thicker sulfide layers. The trend, however, differs for In2S3- and SnS-based devices. Here, as the film growth time or film thickness increases, the device performance tends to deteriorate (Table 3 and 4).

Electronegativity can be used to calculate the degree of ionic or covalent character of a bond between two dissimilar elements. The percentage ionic character of a bond (B) can be calculated as:

B = 1 − e−1/4(χA − χB)2
(1)
Bond ionicity values calculated in Table 6 based on electronegativity values in Table 7 quantify that the ionicity of the metal–sulfur bond decreases in the order In2S3 (15%) > SnS (9%) > Sb2S3 (7%). Thus, with a larger covalent character of the Sb–S bond, Sb could more readily bond with the S atoms on the covalent P3HT compared to In or Sn. Sb exhibits characteristics of both metals and non-metals due to its proximity to the staircase line running up the right hand side of the periodic table, which further helps form an optimum interface between the normally incompatible inorganic TiO2 and organic P3HT layers. Photovoltaic parameters in Fig. 4b also demonstrate this trend wherein In2S3-based devices fare the worst, while SnS-based devices have photovoltaic parameters intermediate to those of In2S3 and Sb2S3. We, therefore, hypothesize here that the more covalent the metal–sulfur bond, the more efficient the devices incorporating these metal sulfide absorber layers at the hybrid P3HT–TiO2 interface are likely to be. A second objective of introducing the metal sulfide interlayers was to act as a linker between P3HT and TiO2, thereby optimizing the charge separation and transfer processes. Accordingly, Raman analysis was carried out directly on the metal sulfide-P3HT interface inside the hybrid solar cell devices to investigate the interaction between metal atoms of the sulfide layer and the S atoms of P3HT.

Stibnite (Sb2S3) has a parallel ribbon-like structure comprising of two types of Sb atoms and three types of S atoms. As depicted in Fig. 5a, one type of Sb atoms forms short (2.5–2.8 Å) covalent Sb–S bonds with S atoms within the same plane, which are too strong to be broken by a reaction with the thiophene ring of P3HT. On the other hand, the second type of Sb atoms forms long (3.4 Å) Sb–S bonds with S atoms on a parallel ribbon. As these are weak bonds, these Sb atoms can be attacked with relative ease by the S atom on P3HT. To examine this interaction, Fig. 5b compares the Raman spectra of P3HT-coated Sb2S3 films in a device configuration with those of neat Sb2S3 films deposited on a TiO2-coated ITO-glass substrate. An advantage of Raman analysis is that the characteristic peak from the organic (P3HT) appears at 1442 cm−1 and does not overlap with the inorganic (Sb2S3) peaks. Raman spectra of the Sb2S3 film shows two strong peaks at 277 and 293 cm−1. On coating with P3HT, both peaks become depressed and broaden. The peak at 277 cm−1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the long Sb–S bonds, broadens and shifts to lower wavenumbers, suggesting a weakening of the long Sb–S bonds. The weakening could signal a bonding or chelating of the Sb atoms in Sb2S3 with the S atoms in P3HT. This observation agrees well with a previous report in the literature which employed Raman spectroscopy to show that P3HT strongly depressed the characteristic Raman peaks of the long Sb–S bond in Sb2S3. The peaks at 399, 519 and 639 cm−1 correspond to the characteristic peaks of anatase TiO2.
Interestingly, Raman analysis of In2S3 and SnS films coated with P3HT does not display such bonding or chelation of the thiophene moieties in P3HT towards the metal atom. Raman spectra of SnS film in Fig. 5d shows two strong peaks at 220 and 300 cm−1. Raman spectrum of In2S3 in Fig. 5f is dominated by a broad peak centered around 300 cm−1, the intensity of which strongly depends on film deposition temperature. The shoulder at about 350 cm−1 associated with the A1g Raman mode is also visible. On coating with P3HT, neither the positions nor the intensities of these In2S3 and SnS peaks change (Fig. 5d,f), unlike in the case of Sb2S3 samples (Fig. 5b), signaling a difference in the interaction between the metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfides and P3HT. However, as the electronegativity difference between the metal ions of the sulphides considered here is small, further research is required to confirm these findings in other sulfides comprised of metal ions with a larger difference in electronegativity. It is also required to confirm how other conjugated polymers, particularly those without S-containing thiophene moieties, will interact with these metal sulfides interlayers. Nevertheless, recent reports of improvements seen with spiro-OMeTAD hole transporters in Sb2Se3-based hybrid devices seem to suggest that the reactive nature of Sb may enable it to easily react with other conjugated polymers that have reactive sites.
Unlike the defect spinel-like structure of In2S3 (Fig. 5e), SnS has a layered structure (Fig. 5c), quite similar to the ribbon-like structure of Sb2S3 (Fig. 5a) and is comprised of both short and long Sn–S bonds. However, as seen in Fig. 5c, Raman peaks of SnS remain unchanged after coating with P3HT, which raises the question of whether there can exist changes in morphology that make it more difficult for the P3HT to interact with SnS when compared to Sb2S3. SEM images in Fig. 6 reveal clear differences in the morphology of the three metal sulfides. The nanoparticle domains seen on the surface of Sb2S3 films may expose crystallographic facets that are more suitable for interaction with P3HT, compared to the nano-disk and nano-flower morphologies exhibited by In2S3 and SnS, respectively. Furthermore, the low polarity of the covalent Sb–S bond can make the surface of the Sb2S3 film more hydrophobic compared to In2S3 and SnS. This could also make it easier for the hydrophobic P3HT to wet the Sb2S3 surface and form an intimate charge transfer contact compared to In2S3 and SnS. In summary, several factors relating to the crystal structure, morphology, and chemistry of the metal sulfides can influence how they behave when in contact with P3HT, thereby influencing the photovoltaic properties of hybrid solar cells. Detailed investigations of the influence of these factors are planned for future study.

Plan-view (Fig. 6) and cross-sectional SEM images (ESI) further indicate that the three metal sulfide layers grow differently on the TiO2 surface. Again Sb2S3 films appear to form a planar (compact) layer on TiO2, compared to the higher surface area (porous) layers formed by In2S3 and SnS. This difference in the sulfide film growth mechanism could be yet another reason for the differences seen in photovoltaic behavior. To make this point clear, Fig. 7 compares the photovoltaic performance of ITO/TiO2/Sb2S3/Au type bilayer devices without a P3HT layer. Although, these devices do not reach efficiencies as high as devices with P3HT, they are nonetheless more efficient than P3HT–TiO2 devices without a sulfide layer (Fig. 4b), with Jsc values approaching 2.5 mA cm−2. This result could mean that the TiO2–sulfide interface, in particular charge injection from sulfide to TiO2, can affect the photovoltaic behavior. However, In2S3- and SnS-based devices did not show rectification behavior in the absence of the P3HT buffer layer. In fact, all three metal sulfides exhibit poorer photovoltaic behavior in the absence of P3HT. This means that even if most of the photon absorption and exciton generation happens in the metal sulfide layer, the P3HT layer is still required for optimum hole injection into the Au electrode. It is also possible that more charge traps are present on the surfaces of In2S3 and SnS compared to those on Sb2S3, resulting in increased charge carrier recombination rates in the former. While it is outside the purview of the current work, the role of such traps in hybrid solar cells based on TiO2 and P3HT has been reported before. These factors, along with the small differences in absorption spectra, could also be responsible for the varied photovoltaic response of hybrid solar cells with metal sulfide interlayers.

The growth of a native oxide layer is an effective technique to passivate traps present on the surface of semiconductors. This effect has been successfully employed in the passivated emitter rear locally diffused (PERL) silicon solar cell, in which recombination at the rear silicon surface is minimized by growing a thin silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer. It is known that Sb2S3 can easily oxidize on the surface when in contact with atmospheric oxygen. This leads to the formation of a Sb2O3 surface passivation layer, which can reduce charge carrier traps and recombinations at the Sb2S3-P3HT interface. XPS analysis of the surface of Sb2S3 film in Fig. 8 clearly indicates Sb 3d peaks at a higher binding energy, which could be associated with this native, surface passivating Sb2O3 layer. These peaks are removed after Ar+ sputtering, confirming that the additional peaks are indeed due to the surface oxide. Analysis of the surfaces of In2S3 and SnS does not show evidence for such passivation (Fig. S5 in ESI). This surface oxidation phenomenon could further explain why TiO2–In2S3 and TiO2–SnS devices behaved worse than the TiO2–Sb2S3 bilayer devices as the presence of the Sb2O3 layer could help passivate surface traps in Sb2S3, unlike in the cases of In2S3 and SnS. As depicted in Fig. 9, if the Sb2S3 films are deliberately oxidized, photovoltaic parameters deteriorate, perhaps owing to an increase in resistive losses in the thick Sb2O3 layer. Insets in Fig. 9 reveal that deliberately oxidized Sb2S3 films (sample b) have a whitish patina compared to dark brown unoxidized films (sample a). In the case of sample b, the Sb2S3-coated substrates were exposed to air once the furnace temperature reached ∼200 °C after sintering at 330 °C, instead of cooling to room temperature as in sample a.

The bifunctional metal sulfide interlayers, in particular, Sb2S3, are both strong absorbers and modifiers of the P3HT–TiO2 interaction because of the differences in how they interact with both layers. However, Sb2S3 and SnS are both strong absorbers with similar band gaps and absorption coefficients as mentioned previously. In spite of this, only Sb2S3-based devices work efficiently. Thus, the interaction of the metal sulfide absorber layer with both P3HT and TiO2 layers plays a critical role in these sulfide-based hybrid solar cells. Thus, incorporating an optimized metal sulfide interlayer can result in improved charge separation kinetics at the organic (P3HT)–inorganic (TiO2) interface. In fact, the hybdrophilic nature of the TiO2 surface is a major obstacle to the efficient wetting between TiO2 and P3HT. Introducing bifunctional metal sulfide layers at the P3HT–TiO2 interface can eliminate this problem, as TiO2 and the sulfide layers both being inorganic form an intimate contact, while the favorable interaction between the sulfide and S atoms on P3HT further reduces the overall incompatibility between the TiO2 and P3HT layers.

Nevertheless, given the complexity of the diverse interfaces involved in hybrid solar cells with metal sulfide interlayers, it is challenging to provide a conclusive explanation of the differences seen in the photovoltaic behavior. It is possible that the decreased performance of In2S3- and SnS-based hybrid solar cells could also be attributed to factors like differences in crystal structure, morphology, photon absorption, and charge carrier recombination rates, which make the interaction of In2S3 and SnS absorber layers with TiO2 and P3HT fundamentally different from that of Sb2S3. The differences in photovoltaic performance can, therefore, not be attributed solely to electronegativity differences of the metal ions in the metals sulfides. Instead, these differences are being proposed as a possible factor, which has been hitherto overlooked when analyzing these complex systems involving hybrid interfaces between multiple materials. Our results suggest that metal–sulfur bond ionicity can serve as an additional guideline for identifying novel absorber layers such as highly covalent metal sulfides formed by elements on the right hand side of the periodic table, and can improve hybrid solar cell performance beyond what is currently obtained with Sb2S3.

Incorporating bifunctional metal (In, Sn, and Sb) sulfide interlayers between P3HT and TiO2 appears to be a promising approach to fabricate efficient organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells. The role of metal–sulfide bond ionicity on hybrid solar cell performance has been investigated. As Sb is more electronegative than In and Sn, the ionicity of the metal–sulfur bond decreases in the order In2S3 (15%) > SnS (9%) > Sb2S3 (7%). Raman spectra indicate that the highly covalent character of the Sb–S bond can make it favorable for Sb to bond with the S atoms of the organic P3HT hole-transporter with relative ease compared to In or Sn. Along with strong photon absorption, the presence of the metal–sulfur bonding can promote better wetting between the surfaces of TiO2 and P3HT, making Sb2S3-based devices several orders of magnitude more efficient than In2S3- and SnS-based devices. The improvements in photovoltaic properties seen with Sb2S3 can be further attributed to a complex array of factors, like differences in crystal structure, morphology, photon absorption, charge carrier recombination rates, and how the sulfide layer interacts with TiO2, which require further investigation. Nevertheless, metal–sulfur bond ionicity can serve as an additional parameter, in the ongoing search for metal sulfides that can replace or improve the effects seen with Sb2S3.
