Crystalline Indan-C60 and its photovoltaic application were studied. Microsheets and aloe-like micro-nano superstructures can be assembled from Indan-C60. Indan-PC61BM derived from Indan-C60 was further investigated as an acceptor for OPV devices, which shows a higher Voc, FF, and PCE than those obtained using PC61BM.

Fullerene (C60) is a significant molecule due to its excellent chemical properties, appealing self-assembly performance, unique physical properties, and extensive applications in semiconductors and optoelectrical devices. Molecular self-assembly of C60 and its derivatives has attracted much interest as the well-ordered thin films or bulk materials have been shown to find applications in catalysis, sensor technology, and interfacial heterojunctions. Moreover, the crystallinity of C60 and its derivatives imparted by π-stacking interactions play an important role in material chemistry as this kind of crystallization-driven self-assembly can result in better optoelectronic materials, such as those with higher electron mobility. In addition, the electron deficiency of fullerene C60 for an n-type organic semiconductor, i.e., electron accepting character, has been widely utilized in combination with suitable electron donors for the development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. A representative polymeric bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device, containing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)), is widely studied as an organic solar cell. However, the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ca. 0.6 V for the P3HT:PC61BM-based device has limited the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Therefore, it is important to explore new fullerene structures and to study their material chemistry for promising applications.

Herein, we focus on the exploration of new fullerene materials towards molecular self-assembly and applications in OPV devices. A new fullerene derivative of Indan-C60 was synthesized and characterized. Surprisingly, Indan-C60 readily crystallizes in organic solvents and its crystalline character was analyzed using single crystal X-ray crystallography. The self-assembly of Indan-C60 was investigated by a solvent evaporation method. Moreover, the Indan-PC61BM derivative based on Indan-C60 was employed as an acceptor for solar cells, and the OPV device based on P3HT and Indan-PC61BM shows a higher Voc of 0.80 V, an enhanced fill factor (FF) of 67.2%, and an improved PCE of 4.33%, while the OPV device based on P3HT/PC61BM displays a Voc of 0.63 V and a PCE of 3.8%.
The synthesis of Indan-C60 and Indan-PC61BM is shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, 1-indanone was first converted to the corresponding tosylhydrazone moiety, which was then reacted with C60 to yield Indan-C60. Indan-C60 was isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Buckyprep column. Indan-PC61BM was synthesized from Indan-C60 with a tosylhydrazone moiety used for PC61BM and the resulted bis-adducts were also isolated by HPLC. The Indan-PC61BM products contain a mixture of regioisomers and they were not further purified. Indan-C60 and Indan-PC61BM were confirmed by the matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis (see ESI).
Interestingly, Indan-C60 is found to readily crystallize to form microcrystals when the purified sample in toluene solution was left to stand for hours (see ESI). These microcrystals have a plate shape and a high degree of crystallinity as revealed by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and XRD characterization. In addition, the Indan-C60 microcrystals have lower solubility in toluene, chloroform, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) than in carbon disulfide (CS2). A single crystal of Indan-C60 with a plate-shape structure was obtained from CS2 and the X-ray diffraction analysis results, as shown in Fig. 1a, revealed that the adduct site of carbene is a 6,6-ring juncture of C60 with a closed quaternary-carbon-bridged transannular bond (1.628 Å), which is similar to the methano-bridged bond in the well-known PC61BM.
The obtained single crystal has a unit cell comprised of 2C69H8·5CS2, which is packed in a triclinic space group with unit cell parameters of a = 9.857 Å, b = 14.021 Å, c = 14.292 Å and α = 89.90°, β = 87.03°, γ = 84.22°. Fig. 1b shows the packing mode along the a axis and the nearest distances between these two molecules were labeled. The relatively short distances (3.228 and 3.279 Å) between C60 moieties reveal strong π–π interactions. Moreover, there is a strong interaction between the benzene ring and the neighboring C60 moiety as their nearest distance is 3.398 Å. These results indicate that π–π interactions between C60 moieties combined with arene–C60 interactions are involved in the first step of their self-organization, and this probably is the main reason for the high crystallinity of Indan-C60.
Considering the excellent crystalline character of Indan-C60, the self-assembly of Indan-C60 was then investigated by the solvent evaporation method that is widely used to prepare various unusual crystal shapes of pristine C60 solids.Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Indan-C60 prepared in o-DCB and in chloroform solutions, respectively. Fig. 2a shows the assembled Indan-C60 in o-DCB solution, and a large number of microsheets were observed. The resulting fullerene sheets have large sizes with lengths of ca. 10 μm. The powder XRD analysis (see ESI) revealed that these microsheets have a high degree of ordering and these microsheets with a 2-dimensional layered structure may offer them advantages in the fabrication of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Fig. 2b shows the SEM images of aloe-like micro-nano structures prepared from a chloroform solution of Indan-C60 and it is interesting to observe that these micro-nano superstructures are composed of leaf-like substructures assembled from Indan-C60. For these aloe-like micro-nano structures, there is no observable XRD peak (see ESI). This result reveals that in chloroform solution the Indan-C60 molecules undergo assembly and are deposited very quickly due to the highly volatile nature of chloroform. The sizes of these aloe-like superstructures are ca. 2 μm and these micro-nano structures may have potential applications in catalysis or as interfacial materials.
The electrochemical property of Indan-C60 was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Compared with that of PC61BM which is widely used as a good acceptor in polymer solar cells, reduction potentials of Indan-C60 show cathodic shifts and the estimated LUMO level of Indan-C60 is 0.06 eV higher in energy than that of PC61BM. It is known that the high LUMO levels of fullerene acceptors are favourable for providing a high Voc for solar cells since Voc is proportional to the energy level difference between the donor HOMO and the acceptor LUMO. Therefore, we further modified Indan-C60 and prepared Indan-PC61BM. Unlike the highly crystalline Indan-C60, Indan-PC61BM has greatly improved solubility in organic solvents. As listed in Table 1, the half-wave reduction potentials and the estimated LUMO levels of Indan-C60, Indan-PC61BM, and PC61BM are compared. Moreover, Indan-PC61BM is found to have a higher LUMO level than Indan-C60 and PC61BM, and such an enhanced LUMO level may be attributed to the 56 π-electron fullerene system, similar to that found in other bis-adducts such as ICBA, DMPCBA, OXCBA, and OQMF.

Furthermore, we fabricated a bulk heterojunction solar cell device using Indan-PC61BM with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:Indan-PC61BM/Ca/Al, and PC61BM was used as a reference. The concentration of Indan-PC61BM in o-DCB was 12 mg mL−1 and the donor/acceptor ratio was optimized to be 1:0.7. The annealing temperature of the devices was 110 °C for 10 min. Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), FF, and PCE for the optimized solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are listed in Table 2, and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3.

Compared with the reference PC61BM solar cell, a highly improved Voc value (0.80 V) and FF (67.2%) were obtained for the Indan-PC61BM device. The increased Voc of the P3HT/Indan-PC61BM device can be ascribed to the enhanced LUMO level (0.12 eV higher than that of PC61BM) as the Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor. Moreover, the FF (67.2%) of the P3HT/Indan-PC61BM device is also slightly improved in comparison with that of the P3HT/PC61BM device (64.9%) and is comparable to that of the reported P3HT/ICBA device (67%). FF is the ratio between the maximum obtainable power (ImppVmpp) and the theoretical power (IscVoc). The enhanced FF reveals a higher actual maximum power output for the P3HT/Indan-PC61BM solar cell. As the FF is affected by many factors, including charge carrier mobility and balance, film morphology, and others, a clear understanding of the factors that led to the higher FF for the P3HT/Indan-PC61BM device would require further study. The lower Jsc may be caused by the regioisomers of the bis-adduct Indan-PC61BM, and this phenomenon has also been reported in the solar cells based on bis-adduct acceptors of ICBA, OXCBA, and DMPCBA because isomers may interfere with fullerene stacking and affect electron transport in the fullerene domain. Although there is about 13% loss of Jsc for the Indan-PC61BM-based device, the significant increase of Voc combined with the higher FF leads to an improved PCE of 4.33% for the P3HT/Indan-PC61BM solar cell compared to the standard P3HT/PC61BM device.
In conclusion, a new fullerene derivative of Indan-C60, which readily crystallizes in organic solvents and can be used as a precursor for good fullerene acceptors, was reported. The self-assembly of Indan-C60 was investigated, and microsheets as well as the aloe-like micro-nano structures of Indan-C60 were prepared. The Indan-PC61BM derivative based on Indan-C60 was employed as an acceptor in OPV devices, and the OPV device based on P3HT and Indan-PC61BM shows a higher Voc of 0.80 V and a higher PCE of 4.33%. Further work on its assembly and acceptor derivatives is underway.
