Correction for ‘Blade coated P3HT:non-fullerene acceptor solar cells: a high-throughput parameter study with a focus on up-scalability’ by Enrique Pascual-San-José et al., J. Mater. Chem. A, 2019, DOI: 10.1039/c9ta07361b.

The authors regret that a figure panel was accidentally omitted from the published article, which is now provided as Fig. S14(a) below.

In the section ‘Study of the casting temperature for the P3HT:O-IDTBR’ in the published article, the text ‘Fig. 6 shows the photovoltaic parameters…’ should instead read: ‘Fig. S14 shows the photovoltaic parameters…’.
A corrected version of Fig. S14 is provided below:

Fig. S14 Casting temperature study for P3HT:O-IDTBR based devices. (a) Photovoltaic parameters such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) and (b) EQE (solid line, left axis) and absorption (1 − R) of the full device (dashed line, right axis) are plotted as function of three casting temperatures: 40 °C (blue squares), 80 °C (orange circles) and 105 °C (red triangles).
This change has also now been made to the ESI document.
