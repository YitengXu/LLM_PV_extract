A novel compound 6,6′-(ethyne-1,2-diylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(2-(2-butyloctyl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione) (NAI-PVP-NAI) based on an end capping group 1,8-naphthalimide and central building block diphenylacetylene was designed and synthesized by Suzuki coupling. The newly synthesized NAI-PVP-NAI compound is characterized using optical, thermal, and electrochemical techniques as well as ab initio modeling. This novel and unique compound exhibits strong blue emission in the solid state and has been successfully used as an active light-emitting layer in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Interestingly, the newly developed compound shows both electron-donating and electron-accepting abilities. Therefore, it can act as a donor or an acceptor organic semiconductor. Indeed, upon evaluating this molecule in solution processable organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, we show that it acts as a donor when used with a PCBM acceptor and as an acceptor when used with a P3HT donor. Thus, NAI-PVP-NAI is a versatile compound, which can play three roles as a blue light emitting layer in OLEDs and a donor or an acceptor in OPV devices.

Low cost semiconducting materials are an important class of materials in the electronics industry today and in the future for a wide range of electronic devices and for large area application. These semiconducting materials can be classified as inorganic or organic. Compared to inorganic (non-carbon based) semiconductors, organic (carbon based) ones can bring many advantages for electronic devices such as low cost, preparation at low process temperatures or from solution on flexible substrates (ink formulation and printing), large area coverage, tunable optical and electronic properties by changing the molecular structure or functionalization, and facile synthetic modification. Indeed, there are numerous organic semiconductors, including small molecules and polymers, which have been designed and applied in various organic electronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and so on. Basically, there are plenty of studies based on which an organic semiconducting material can be designed for a single specific application, but to date very few attempts or reports have been made available in which a single semiconducting material can be employed in various multifunctional devices. Herein, we report the use of a single compound for applications in two different types of devices, OLEDs and OSCs.

On the one hand, OLEDs have attracted considerable attention because of their potential application in flat-panel displays for mobile phones and televisions. The key point of material development for OLEDs is to achieve high efficiency, long lifetime, and saturated colour purity. While a large number of green and red emitters satisfy the requirement for OLEDs, efficient and stable blue emitters are still rare. Furthermore, such blue emitting materials are crucial not only as blue emitters but also as host materials to facilitate efficient green and red emission. As a result, the improvement of blue light emitting materials with high luminescence efficiency and pure bright color are some of the most critical requirements.
At the same time, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have gained particular attention as a promising technology for harvesting solar energy and converting it into electrical energy due to their apparent advantages of low-cost fabrication, light-weight, mechanical flexibility, roll-to-roll production and the tunable chemical properties of the organic semiconducting photovoltaic materials. Recently, reported record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have significantly increased, to more than 12% following advances in the synthesis of novel photoactive materials, adoption of interface materials, and design of new device structures. Traditionally, the photoactive layer of OSCs generally consists of a p-type electron donor and an n-type electron acceptor and optimization of both materials plays an important role in enhancing the performance of an OSC device.
1,8-Naphthalimide (NAI) derivatives have attracted great attention for their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and good optical, thermal and chemical stabilities. The 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives have unique photo-physical properties and have been used as yellow emitting layers in doped devices or red emissive materials. Herein, we report a new compound based on diphenylacetylene or phenylene–acetylene–phenylene (PVP) as a central building block and 1,8-naphthalimide as an end capping group based acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) compound, namely, NAI-PVP-NAI, which shows strong blue emission in the solid state; we therefore attempted to use it as an active layer in fluorescent OLEDs. The phenylene group in the PVP moiety is a weak donor and in this molecular structure it can act as an acceptor whereas the electron rich alkyne group is a good electron donor and may also allow free internal rotation of two conjugated planes suggesting better packing behavior. In addition, 1,8-naphthalimide has been studied in recent years and its derivatives are used as n-type semiconducting materials for organic electronics. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no single report using NAI as a candidate for designing p-type semiconductors. In our molecular design, we used NAI as an end capping group with phenylene–acetylene–phenylene as a core moiety and found that this compound demonstrates both electron-accepting and electron-donating abilities for OSC application. Our finding clearly suggests that a carefully designed single donor–acceptor based compound can play three roles in various types of organic electronic devices, which is very rare among materials reported in the literature.

The synthetic route of the target compound is shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, 2-butyl-octylamine (3) was prepared from the respective alkyl alcohol via three steps following our previous report. Then, the alkyl amine was reacted with commercially available 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (4) to form the alkyl substituted NAI derivative 6-bromo-2-(2-butyloctyl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione (5). For the central PVP building block, its commercial dibromo PVP derivative was converted to its bisboronic ester analog 1,2-bis(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)ethyne (6) using a standard protocol. The final compound NAI-PVP-NAI was synthesized by carrying out the Suzuki coupling reaction between alkylated monobromo NAI compound 6-bromo-2-(2-butyloctyl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione and 1,2-bis(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)ethyne over 48 h under reflux conditions, using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] as a catalyst in a mixture of toluene and an aqueous 2 M potassium carbonate [K2CO3] solution. The final compound NAI-PVP-NAI was obtained in 70% yield upon performing column chromatography and recrystallization purification methods. The presence of branched alkyl chains such as butyl–octyl on the N-bay position of naphthalimide as an end-capping group induces adequate solubility for the NAI-PVP-NAI compound, and indeed it is highly soluble in most common organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The thermal properties of compound NAI-PVP-NAI were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The 5% weight loss temperature (decomposition temperature, Td) of the compound is 420 °C (Fig. 1) under nitrogen, indicating an excellent thermal stability of the NAI-PVP-NAI compound. In the first DSC heating cycle, NAI-PVP-NAI exhibits a small melting peak at 102 °C and another sharp melting point at 189 °C (Fig. 2), suggesting that different polymorphs are present. Meanwhile during the first cooling scan, the compound showed crystallization peaks at 151 °C. A subsequent cycle showed a single melting transition at 188 °C, indicating the formation of a single polymorph after the initial melting and recrystallization. In the second cooling cycle, double exothermic peaks at 147 °C and 155 °C are observed, which might be attributed to molecular conformation transformations.


The optical properties of the NAI-PVP-NAI compound are studied using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy both in solution and in the solid state. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the compound in dilute chloroform solution and the corresponding thin film deposited on a glass substrate are shown in Fig. 3. NAI-PVP-NAI exhibits similar absorption spectra with a maximum absorption peak at 367–368 nm in solution and thin films, suggesting weak intermolecular aggregation of the compound in the solid state. Such a weak intermolecular interaction is due to the distortion in the planarity of the backbone due to the attached end capping NAI group's phenylene moiety to the central phenylene ring of PVP.

It has been well established that the dihedral angle between two phenylene units is high and this contributes to a relatively high band gap. In comparison with 2,2′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-1H,1′H-[6,6′-bibenzo[de]isoquinoline]-1,1′,3,3′(2H,2′H)-tetraone in which two naphthalimide groups are combined by a single bond, a slight red shift of about 8–9 nm of the peak maxima is observed due to the increase in conjugation of a diphenylacetylene bridge between two naphthalimide units. The absorption band-edge of the cast film for NAI-PVP-NAI is 420 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 2.95 eV.
The high band gap nature of this newly developed NAI-PVP-NAI compound is due to the high dihedral angle between the end capping groups and the central conjugated building block. The NAI-PVP-NAI molecule is also investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and exhibits maximum emission in chloroform solution at 450 nm and in thin films at 460 nm, which is observed to be perfect blue by the human eye. In order to study the effect of solvent polarity on the emission properties, we measured fluorescence using various solvents such as hexane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), and dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively. The emission spectra of the compound clearly exhibit a bathochromic shift upon increasing the polarity of the solvent (Fig. S8, ESI).
The electrochemical behavior of NAI-PVP-NAI was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution. The CV curve was recorded with respect to the potential of a standard calomel electrode (SCE), which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple, and its energy level was taken as −4.80 eV below the vacuum level. As shown in Fig. 4, NAI-PVP-NAI exhibits irreversible reduction and oxidation waves. The HOMO and LUMO values for the compound are calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials using the equations: HOMO = −EHOMO = e(Eonset(ox) + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = e(Eonset(red) + 4.8) eV.
The obtained HOMO and LUMO levels of NAI-PVP-NAI are −5.95 and −3.04 eV respectively. Both the LUMO and HOMO of NAI-PVP-NAI are lower than those of the classical polymer donor P3HT and higher than those of PC71BM (see Fig. 5), indicating that this compound could be used as an acceptor or a donor in a low wavelength layer in tandem cells. The optical (absorbance maxima and optical band gaps) and electrochemical (HOMO–LUMO levels and electrochemical band gaps) properties of these newly synthesized materials are shown in Table 1. To investigate the solid-state interactions and the thin film properties of the material, we performed X-ray diffraction of pristine NAI-PVP-NAI and of thin films of CBP doped with 3 wt% NAI-PVP-NAI. The recorded XRD spectra revealed the amorphous nature of the material (Fig. S9, ESI).

Density functional theory at the B3LYP level of theory using the basis set Lanl2dz was used to study the properties of the newly synthesized compound such as frontier orbital energies and localization. A polarized continuum model (PCM) of the chloroform solvent was used. The calculations were performed in Gaussian 09. Because the alkyl chains do not significantly affect the calculation result, we replaced long alkyl chains by a simple ethyl group to reduce the computational load. From Fig. 6, it is observed that while both the HOMO and LUMO of compound NAI-PVP-NAI are delocalized along the entire backbone, the HOMO is relatively more localized on the core and the LUMO on the end capping groups.

The computed HOMO and LUMO energy levels of NAI-PVP-NAI were −6.13 and −2.96 eV, respectively. The computed HOMO and LUMO energies and the gap (of 3.17 eV) are in decent agreement with the measured values. The dihedral angle at the equilibrium geometry between the NAI moiety and central building block PVP is quite large, 50°, suggesting the potential for charge transport in more than one dimension.


NAI-PVP-NAI revealed an excellent photoluminescence peak at 450 nm in solution and 460 nm in the thin film upon excitation at 350 nm. The intense blue emission and strong fluorescence inspired us to fabricate an OLED device to evaluate its potential for real-life application in solid-state lighting. The multilayer OLED device was fabricated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as a hole injection/transport layer (HI/HTL), an emissive layer (EML) comprising of different dopant concentrations of the NAI-PVP-NAI blue emitter in the 4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP) host, 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBI) as an electron transporting layer (ETL), and lithium fluoride (LiF) as an electron injecting layer. The schematic representation of the device architecture and the energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 7.

The electroluminescence characteristics of the studied sky-blue OLED device are shown in Fig. 8 and 9 respectively. The obtained device data are shown in Table 2. Fig. 8a shows the J–V characteristics of OLED devices for different NAI-PVP-NAI dopant guest concentrations in the CBP host. The diode characteristics curve clearly shows that the studied devices are shunt-free. The forward bias current of the device with 3 wt% of NAI-PVP-NAI doped into the CBP host is higher than that with 7 wt% of NAI-PVP-NAI. As the doping concentration of the guest increases in the host material, the self-aggression of molecules occurs. Because this sheet resistance of the device is increased, therefore, the forward bias current is smaller compared to the other devices. The effect of NAI-PVP-NAI dopant concentration on the electroluminescence (EL) parameters of the blue OLED devices is summarized in Table 2. The sky blue OLED devices were fabricated with four different NAI-PVP-NAI dopant concentrations in the CBP host. The studied devices revealed that the 1% NAI-PVP-NAI weight doped device exhibits a sky-blue emission of CIE (0.17, 0.20) with a power efficiency of 1.6 lm W−1, a current efficiency of 2.0 cd A−1, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.5% at 100 cd m−2. As the doping concentration increased to 3 weight%, the power efficiency, current efficiency, and the EQE increased by 37, 40 and 6% at 100 cd m−2 respectively, with a CIE of (0.17, 0.25). A further increase in doping concentration to 5 weight% did not lead to a significant improvement in EL parameters. In contrast, an increase in dopant concentration to 7 weight% leads to a decrease in power efficiency, current efficiency, and EQE by 13.6, 13.8 and 13.3%, respectively, with a CIE of (0.18, 0.28).

The overall decrease in EL parameters at high dopant concentration is attributed to concentration quenching. More importantly, exciton generation is reduced due to self-aggregation of the emitter materials at high dopant concentration.
The operating voltage for all OLED devices was found to be around 3.5 V. The low operating voltage is attributed to appropriate energy levels and the device structure that enables injection of the charges into the EML effectively. The LUMO of the CBP host is −2.9 eV, which is favorable for electron injection because it is 0.2 eV lower than that of the electron transport layer, TPBI, as shown in Fig. 7. Moreover, CBP possesses ambipolar characteristics with excellent hole and electron mobility. Even though the difference between the HOMO level of the CBP host and the PEDOT:PSS hole injection/transport layer is large (∼1.0 eV), the number of holes injected into the EML is fully utilized to generate excitons because of its high hole mobility (2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Due to this reason, effective charge carrier recombination is localized within the EML resulting in high power efficiency, current efficiency, and EQE of the studied sky-blue OLED device. The brightness of the devices steadily increased with an increase in dopant concentration. The maximum luminance is 4318 cd m−2 for the 7 weight% doped device and is shown in Fig. 8b. At 1000 cd m−2, the power efficiency roll-off is significantly observed in the 1 weight% device as compared to 3 and 5 weight% devices and a similar trend is observed in the EQE of the devices, as shown in Fig. 8c and d.
The PL spectra of pristine NAI-PVP-NAI and the CBP-host doped with different concentrations of NAI-PVP-NAI guest obtained by employing 350 nm excitation wavelength are shown in Fig. 9(a). All the PL spectra are normalized to peak guest NAI-PVP-NAI. It is noticed that the maximum peak intensity of the neat film is obtained at 463 nm. A red shift is observed in the case of the host–guest doped film. The CBP host emission is noticed at 375 nm for doped thin films, which decreases with increasing NAI-PVP-NAI doping concentration. This demonstrates that the host–guest energy transfer depends on the amount of guest concentration. At 1 weight% guest concentration, the number of guest molecules present in the host matrix is not enough to absorb the complete excitation originating from the host by any kind of energy transfer including Förster or Dexter energy transfer. The maximum emission peak position for the NAI-PVP-NAI emitter is roughly located at 477 nm. It is important to mention that for the 1 weight% doped film, the obtained PL spectrum is broader than that of high concentration doped films. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for a neat film was found to be 92.72%, whereas that of CBP doped with 3 wt% and 5 wt% NAI-PVP-NAI was found to be around 91.42 and 88.52%, respectively.

Fig. 9(b) shows the EL spectra of studied sky-blue OLED devices, fabricated with four different NAI-PVP-NAI dopant concentrations in the CBP host. The peaks of the EL spectra indicate that the emission is from the sky-blue region for all the devices except the 1 weight% doped device. The CBP host emission is observed at 390 nm along with a broad emission peak at 470 nm. The intrinsic CBP emission spectrum is attributed to residual excitons in the CBP host. The intrinsic emission can be minimized by increasing the dopant concentration in the CBP host. As the dopant concentration increased to 3 weight%, a single emission peak is noticed at 470 nm. It is important to note that, as the concentration is increased from 3 to 7 weight%, the peak position of the EL spectrum shifts from 470 to 480 nm. This bathochromic shift is attributed to the non-uniform dispersion of the NAI-PVP-NAI dopant into the CBP host. The NAI-PVP-NAI material is expected to be electron deficient; therefore, we fabricated the electron only device with ITO/TPBi/NAI-PVP-NAI/TPBi/LiF/Al device architecture (Fig. S10, ESI). As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI), the electron current density of the device increases with an increase in applied bias voltage confirming the excellent electron charge carrier mobility of the NAI-PVP-NAI material.

To evaluate the potential of the novel compound NAI-PVP-NAI as an acceptor and a donor in organic solar cells, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a conventional structure consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI/LiF/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM/LiF/Al were fabricated as shown in Fig. 10a. The ITO coated glass and Al act as an anode and a cathode, respectively, while PEDOT:PSS and LiF are hole and electron transporting layers, respectively. NAI-PVP-NAI is used as the electron acceptor when combined with P3HT and is utilized as the donor when mixed with PC71BM. The active layer blends (a donor to acceptor ratio of 1:1 by weight, 20 mg mL−1) were spin-coated from chloroform solution under ambient conditions without the use of additives, while the thickness of the active layers was kept at about 80 nm. The films were annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes before evaporation of the back contact. The OSC devices were characterized using standard electrical current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics. The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices under solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 10b and c respectively. The device characteristics, including short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 3. The P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI based OSC devices achieved a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 2.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 32% and a PCE of 0.7%. A higher VOC but a low current and FF is likely due to the relatively high lying LUMO of NAI-PVP-NAI approaching the LUMO of the P3HT donor, limiting charge separation. Meanwhile the NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM based device exhibited VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of 0.64 V, 3.3 mA cm−2, 47% and 1.0%, respectively. The current and FF are somewhat higher in part due to a better driving force for charge separation in this donor–acceptor pair. Although the LUMO/HOMO offset between the acceptor and donor of P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI and NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM mixtures is comparable around 2.0 eV, VOC of NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM is remarkably lower than that of P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI. Many factors such as the morphology and electrode contact could also affect the VOC value of organic solar cells. The EQE spectra of blended films are presented in Fig. 10c. OCS devices showed EQE spectra from 300–650 nm and 310–530 nm with a maximum value of 57.0% at ∼390 nm and 33.8% at ∼400 nm for P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI and NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM respectively. Both the donor and acceptor contribute to the EQE spectrum. The P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI based device has a rather lower EQE onset than NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM, consistent with the broader absorption spectrum of P3HT than PC71BM.

The surface morphology of the active layer plays an important role in influencing the device performance and was characterized by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. The AFM images of the blend films P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI and NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:1 are shown in Fig. 11. The root mean square (RMS) roughness is 0.73 nm and 1.83 nm for P3HT:NAI-PVP-NAI and NAI-PVP-NAI:PC71BM respectively.

In summary, we have synthesized a new compound acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) NAI-PVP-NAI based on diphenylacetylene as a central building block (donor) and 1,8-naphthalimide (acceptor) as an end capper. We have successfully demonstrated the use of NAI-PVP-NAI as a sky-blue emitter for high performance organic light emitting diodes via the solution process technique. At 3 weight% dopant concentration of NAI-PVP-NAI with the CBP host, the fabricated OLED device demonstrates high power efficiency ηp = 2.2 lm W−1, current efficiency, ηc = 2.8 cd A−1, and ηEQE = 1.6% at 100 cd m−2. The obtained OLED results are very promising and NAI-PVP-NAI can be used as a promising sky blue emitter to be used in displays and solid-state lighting. Since this material has appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels to be an ambipolar material, we explored the use of NAI-PVP-NAI as both an electron donor and electron acceptor in BHJ OSC devices. The device based on NAI-PVP-NAI as an acceptor showed the best PCE of 0.7% with a VOC of 0.90 V, JSC of 2.5 mA cm−2, and FF of 32%. Meanwhile, when NAI-PVP-NAI is used as a donor and combined with conventional acceptor PC71BM, the device exhibited VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of 0.64 V, 3.3 mA cm−2, 47% and 1.0%, respectively. All the above results clearly indicate that NAI-PVP-NAI is a versatile organic semiconductor and can play a triple role as an emitter in OLEDs and a donor or an acceptor in OPV devices. Such a multifunctionality aspect in a single material is a rare feature and this makes this class of A–D–A materials useful for a range of organic electronic devices.


All the staring materials were purchased commercially as analytical reagents and used directly without any further purification. Synthesized compounds were characterized using 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra, which were obtained with a Varian-400 or Bruker-600 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) source, operating in the positive ion mode at a resolution of 120000 (at m/z 400). Thermal analysis was performed using a Pegasus Q500TGA thermogravimetric analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted under nitrogen using a Chimaera instrument Q100 DSC. The sample was heated at 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 300 °C. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Carry50 UV-vis Spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane and a three-electrode cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum-wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed. X-ray diffraction measurement was carried out with Bruker D8, which was operated at 30 kV and 10 mA with a step of 0.02° from 5–50°. Photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined according to the procedure followed by de Mello et al. The absolute PLQY was obtained using a calibrated integrating sphere system (Labsphere) attached with a CCD spectrograph. ±2% measurement error is considered because of the stability of the excitation source and the radiometric calibration source.


OLED devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned UV-ozone treated, 3 × 3 cm2, 120 nm thick pattern ITO substrates. PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) purchased from Uni-onward crop was used without any purification to deposit a 40 nm hole injection/transport layer. It was spin-coated on a cleaned ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s and dried at 120 °C for 20 min. The host–guest mixture solution consists of CBP and NAI-PVP-NAI was prepared in tetrahydrofuran solvent at 40 °C and subjected to sonication for 40 min. A 25 nm thick emission layer (EML) was deposited via spin coating on an ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at 2500 rpm for 20 s in a nitrogen filled glove box. An electron transporting layer (ETL), 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi), LiF and Al having thicknesses of 40, 1 and 100 nm, respectively, were deposited via the thermal evaporation technique under high vacuum (10−6 Torr). The EL characteristic of the final devices was measured in ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The current–voltage–luminance characterization was done using a computer interfaced Keithley 2400 electrometer and Minolta CS-100A luminance meter. A PR-655 spectroradiometer was used to record the emission spectra. The active OLED device area was 0.09 cm2 calculated from the pattern ITO substrate and masked Al electrode.


Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were fabricated by spin coating 30 nm-thick layers of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Baytron AI 4083 from HC Starck) on ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) patterned glass substrates which were washed with acetone and 2-propanol in an ultrasonication bath and UV/ozone-treated. The PEDOT:PSS films were baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air. An active layer of the device consisting of a blend of P3HT/NAI-PVP-NAI or NAI-PVP-NAI/PC71BM (20 mg mL−1) with a ratio of 1:1 was then spin coated from chloroform solvent with a thickness of ∼80 nm. Then, the active layer was annealed at 80 °C for 10 min. The films were transferred to a metal evaporation chamber and top electrodes consisting of LiF (1 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were deposited through a shadow mask (device area was 0.1 cm2) at approximately 1 × 10−6 Torr. The film thickness was determined using a Veeco Dektak 150+Surface Profiler. The current density–voltage measurements of the devices were carried out using a 1 kW Oriel solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter as the light source in conjunction with a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. Solar measurements were carried out under 1000 W m−2 AM 1.5G illumination conditions. For accurate measurement, the light intensity was calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell (PV measurements Inc.) certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Device fabrication and characterization were performed in ambient environment without any encapsulation.


The AFM samples were prepared by spin-coating the blend solution on the PEDOT:PSS layer. Tapping-mode AFM (NanoScope III, Dimension, Digital Instrument Inc.) was used with commercially available tapping mode tips.


Triphenylphosphine (26.23 g, 0.1 mol) was dissolved in DCM (200 mL) under argon for 15 minutes. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the addition of bromine (7.2 mL, 0.14 mol). After 2-butyloctan-1-ol (18.63 g, 0.1 mol) was added dropwise via an additional funnel over 30 minutes, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature overnight under argon.

The mixture was then heated at 84 °C for 48 hours under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with DCM, washed with water and brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent, the reaction mixture was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (chloroform:hexane = 1:1).
