Two new hole-extraction materials, TPDI (5,10,15-triphenyl-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole) and TBDI (5,10,15-tribenzyl-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole), were synthesized and explored in planar heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). The synthesized materials have good transparency in the visible spectrum, high hole mobility, and compatible highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values with the donor material, which make them excellent hole-extraction layers (HELs) for OSCs. The SubPc (subphthalocyanine chloride)/C60 and SubNc (subnaphthalocyanine chloride)/C60 OSCs with a TBDI HEL show impressive 35.9% and 29.1% improvements in power conversion efficiencies compared to reference devices. Their HOMO values were evaluated as 5.2–5.3 eV and hole mobilities were measured as 5.9–6.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.3 MV cm−1 by the space-charge limited current method.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their enormous improvement in performance are now on the way to commercialization. However, there are certain limitations, which are hindering their rapid progress such as issues of controlling the metal–organic interface. To resolve this, new materials and concepts are being introduced in OSCs, such as methods of efficient hole-extraction from the donor layer using different surface treatments on ITO, insertion of a buffer layer between ITO and the donor layer,etc. The basic idea behind this was to align the work-function of the metal with the energy of photo-excited quasi-fermi levels of organic semiconductors in order to maximize the photocurrent by minimizing the charge extraction energy barrier for achieving higher efficiencies.

Until now, several groups have focused on developing new donor and acceptor materials to improve light absorption and band gap for the increase of open-circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) in OSCs. However, low hole mobility of donor materials in many cases limits the overall performances of OSCs. For efficient hole-extraction, various approaches have been adopted in the past, such as insertion of a basic hole-extraction layer (HEL), PEDOT, in inverted cells or reducing the hole injection barrier using a buffer layer by band bending at organic–metal interfaces through generating strong dipoles or improving hole-extraction by inserting polymer derivatives in polymer OSCs. In spite of these approaches, the hole extraction phenomenon is still dealing with critical issues like low hole mobility, high injection barrier between two HOMO levels, and thermal and morphological instability of semiconductors. Hence, hole-extraction materials possessing high hole mobility, well-matched ionization potential with the donors for efficient hole extraction, and excellent thermal durability with morphological stability and a high glass transition temperature are always in demand.
There are limited reports on hole-extraction materials which have shown improved performances and thermal stability in the OSCs. Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) is the most commonly used hole-extraction material these days in OSC devices. Triarylamine derivatives such as 4,4′-bis(N-phenyl-1-naphthylamino)biphenyl (NPB) and 4,4′-bis(3-methylphenylphenylamino)biphenyl (TPD) are also well known hole-extraction materials. Nevertheless, there are some deficiencies that hamper their further applicability such as TPD's lack of thermal and morphological stability, and NPB's low Tg (glass transition temperature) as well as poor interfacial stability with ITO and low hole mobility making it incapable for actual solar cell applications. Recently, we demonstrated the effect of HELs with different energy levels and mobilities on SubPc/C60 OSCs. It was shown that appropriate HEL materials can enhance the Voc as well as PCE, if they have an appropriate HOMO level and high mobility. In addition, the high LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level of HELs can prevent electron leakage by reducing the dark current resulting in high performances. Therefore, new materials need to be synthesized based on the systematic understanding of HELs in relation to Voc and its dependence on HOMO level, mobility, and dark current. Motivated by these results, we have developed two new hole-extraction materials with high mobility and effective energy levels to improve the OSC performances.
In this paper, we present a detailed investigation of two newly synthesized high mobility hole-extraction materials, TPDI (5,10,15-triphenyl-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole) and TBDI (5,10,15-tribenzyl-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole). These new organic semiconductors possess a high hole mobility of ∼6.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.3 MV cm−2 electric field, excellent HOMO values of 5.2–5.3 eV to make a good ohmic contact between ITO and donor semiconductors, and good optical transparencies in the visible region. These materials are capable of enhancing the overall performances of OSC devices.

All chemicals, reagents, and solvents from commercial sources were used as received without further purification. All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, 0.2 mm). Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (200–300 mesh). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ultrashied™ 300 in an appropriate deuterated solvent solution at 295 K. IR spectral measurements were carried out on a Varian FTS 7000 with ATR. The elemental analysis was performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific EA-1112. The DSC and TGA were taken on a Metellor Toledo DSC1 and TA Instrument Q 5000IR, respectively. Triazatruxene was synthesized as described previously.


To a solution of triazatruxene (3 g, 8.69 mmol), iodobenzene (10.6 g, 52.11 mmol) in 60 mL of quinoline, CuI (6.61 g, 34.7 mmol) and K2CO3 (4.80 g, 34.7 mmol) under nitrogen were added. After stirring at 180 °C for 2.5 days under a N2 atmosphere, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and subsequently diluted with dichloromethane (120 mL) followed by filtering through a plug of celite. The resulting filter cake was further washed with dichloromethane (∼100 mL). The filtrate was concentrated in a vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography eluting with 1/4 to 1/1 dichloromethane–hexane to give a pale yellow solid of the desired product. Finally, the obtained solid was re-crystallized in a mixed solution of dichloromethane and methanol to provide a white solid of the product TPDI in 60% yield. Mp 352 °C; 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) 7.67–7.60 (m, 15H), 7.34 (dd, J = 8.1, 1.2 Hz, 3H), 7.17 (ddd, J = 9.0, 8.1, 1.2 Hz, 3H), 6.77 (ddd, J = 9.0, 8.1, 1.2 Hz, 3H), 6.05 (dd, J = 8.1, 1.2 Hz, 3H); 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3) 141.6, 140.9, 137.7, 130.0, 129.0, 128.2, 123.1, 122.5, 120.0, 109.9, 104.4; IR (ATR) cm−1: 3041, 1593, 1579, 1498, 1476, 1453, 1402, 1323, 1298, 1238, 1152, 1121, 1073, 1022, 917, 838, 768, 742, 728, 696, 678; anal. calcd (%) for C42H27N3, C, 87.92; H, 4.75; N, 7.33.

The synthesis process of TBDI is the same as that of TPDI. For the synthesis of TBDI, iodomethylbenzene was used as a reactant instead of iodobenzene and the final yield of the product TBDI was 60%. Mp 333 °C; Tg 275 °C; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 7.99 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 3H), 7.52 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 6H), 7.44 (dd, J = 6.4, 7.6 Hz, 6H), 7.36 (dd, J = 7.2, 7.6 Hz, 3H), 7.24 (ddd, J = 10.8, 7.2, 8 Hz, 6H), 7.01 (dd, J = 7.2, 7.6 Hz, 3H), 6.08 (s, 6H); 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 141.8, 139.7, 138.2, 129.1, 127.5, 126.6, 123.3, 123.2, 121.6, 120.3, 110.9, 103.3, 51.5; anal. calcd (%) for C45H33N3, C, 87.77; H, 5.41; N, 6.83.

The TPDI and TBDI materials for device fabrication were purified by the train sublimation technique. All sublimation grade materials for the other layers were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corporation and ACROS Organics. Organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated on indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass having an area of 2 mm × 2 mm with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω per square. A line pattern of ITO was formed using the photolithography process. Before coating with organic layers, the patterned ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and acetone, and then rinsed with de-ionized water, dried by blowing nitrogen gas, and finally irradiated in the UV-ozone chamber. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated by the evaporation of hole-extraction materials TPDI or TBDI, SubPc (subphthalocyanine chloride) or SubNc (subnaphthalocyanine chloride) as donors, C60 as an acceptor, and BCP (2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) as an exciton blocking layer. Subsequently, Al as cathode (100 nm) was deposited in an adjacent metal chamber without breaking the vacuum.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source-meter, in the dark and under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a calibrated AM 1.5G sun simulator (McScience, K3000-LAB50) in ambient conditions. A short arc xenon lamp of 150 W and an AM1.5G filter were used to give a simulated irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (equivalent to an AM1.5 irradiation) at the surface of the device. The J–V characteristic measurements under illumination were carried out in a dark chamber with a window slit of 2 mm2 area for illumination.
The EQE (external quantum efficiency) of the fabricated devices was measured by using a monochromator (Model 74000, Newport Oriel Instruments, USA) and a HAMAMATSU silicon photodiode was used for the calibration of the EQE system. During EQE measurements, the wavelength was controlled with a monochromator from 200 nm to 1600 nm. For optical measurements, the UV-Visible absorption spectrum of the TPDI and TBDI in chlorobenzene solution was recorded with a Shimadzu 3100 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. In case of photoluminescence (PL) measurements, emission spectra of both the materials in solution were measured using a photoluminescence spectrophotometer with excitation at 380 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using EC epsilon electrochemical analysis equipment. Platinum wire and ITO film on glass were used as counter and working electrodes, respectively. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) was used as the supporting electrolyte. Also, an Ag wire in 0.1 M AgNO3 was used as a reference electrode. Using an internal ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fe+/Fe) standard, the potential values were converted to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) scale. The position of the LUMO of each material was estimated from the optical band gap determined from the onset of absorption spectra.


Triphenylene-fused long alkyl chain attached triazatruxene derivatives were reported as p-type organic semiconductor materials with HOMO values of 4.9–5.2 eV. They have a discotic arrangement in the films having good hole carrier mobility values of 0.03–0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, such mobility values are not good for organic transistor applications, but they could be very excellent candidate materials for OSCs and organic light-emitting diode applications. The new HEL materials have been synthesized based on previous reports on triazatruxene derivatives. TPDI and TBDI were designed to have high Tg values by reducing alkyl chain and attaching phenyl rings. Scheme 1 shows the molecular structures of TPDI and TBDI with their synthetic methods. The molecular structures of TPDI and TBDI were confirmed by 1H NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The thermal properties of both HELs were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The TPDI and TBDI are thermally stable up to 420 °C and 346 °C as shown by their high decomposition temperature (Td) and their melting temperature (Tm) appearing at 352 °C and 333 °C, respectively. The Tg of TPDI and TBDI did not appear even after reheating several times. These results indicate that they have good morphological stability with high thermal stability.

The absorption spectra of both HEL materials in dilute chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectra of TPDI and TBDI give a broad absorption band peaking at 314 and 317 nm which could be from π–π* transitions of the conjugated π-electron system. Their absorption in the ultraviolet region makes them excellent candidates as hole extraction materials for OSCs. The PL emission peaks of TPDI and TBDI in chlorobenzene solution at room temperature were observed at 391–394 nm as shown in Fig. 1.
The optical band gaps of these compounds were determined in cholorobenzene solution from the onset of absorption spectra at 3.32 and 3.25 eV. The energy levels of frontier orbitals were estimated by cyclic voltammetry and the corresponding electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels of TPDI and TBDI were calculated by calibration with ferrocene as an internal standard as 5.32–2.02 eV and 5.25–1.98 eV, respectively.

The SCLC (space charge limited current) method for hole mobility measurements of TPDI, TBDI, and NPB was applied to each hole-only device. Hole-only devices of ITO/MoO3 (1 nm)/NPB or TPDI or TBDI (100 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al were fabricated for the evaluation of hole mobility. The thin MoO3 layer on a metal electrode was inserted to make ohmic contact so that the SCLC region can be investigated clearly in all devices. Carrier mobility depending on the electric field as a function of voltage in our devices was plotted as shown in Fig. 2. The TPDI and TBDI SCLC hole mobilities were evaluated as ∼6.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.3 MV cm−2 electric field. The NPB hole mobility was measured as a reference and it was found to be 2.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.3 MV cm−2. This value is very similar to previously reported data. The measured hole mobilities of both HELs are about an order of magnitude greater than that of NPB. For comparison, hole mobility values of both materials are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 3(a) shows the energy level diagram of SubPc/C60 devices, and the fabricated device structures are as follows:
Device A: ITO/SubPc (14.5 nm)/C60 (31.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm),
Device B: ITO/SubPc (8.5 nm)/C60 (31.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm),
Device C: ITO/TPDI (6 nm)/SubPc (14.5 nm)/C60 (31.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm),
Device D: ITO/TPDI (6 nm)/SubPc (8.5 nm)/C60 (31.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm),
Device E: ITO/TBDI (6 nm)/SubPc (8.5 nm)/C60 (31.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm).

Fig. 4(a) shows the J–V characteristics of Devices A–E, measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device parameters such as Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 2. The light absorption in OSCs can be improved by increasing SubPc thickness, but due to the low exciton diffusion length and low hole mobility of this donor material, series resistance of the device increases. Therefore, an optimal thickness condition of SubPc is required for achieving high performance of OSCs. Device A was fabricated as a reference device with the optimized condition of SubPc/C60, and the optimum thickness of the active layer shows a good agreement with the reported data. The photo performances of Device A show a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 4.81 mA cm−2, an FF of 56.88% and a PCE of 2.62%. In order to know the thickness effect of SubPc, Device B was fabricated with a low thickness (8.5 nm) of SubPc. Device B displayed a reduction in Voc and Jsc values, and FF was increased with the decrease in series resistance. However, the PCE decreased only slightly with the reduction of donor material thickness, indicating that the HEL plays an important role in rapid hole transportation instead of some portion of the donor layer. In order to confirm the effect of the HEL, Device C was fabricated by insertion of TPDI without change of donor layer thickness. As expected, indeed Device C generated an s-shaped curve due to the increase in series resistance of the device. Hence, the optimum thickness condition of SubPc with TPDI as the HEL was investigated and it was found to be 8.5 nm.

The insertion of HELs shows significant enhancement in the Voc values to 1.15 V (Device D) and 1.13 V (Device E). Also, the addition of an HEL helps to increase the Jsc values as compared to the reference device. The Jsc values of Devices D and E were increased to 5.63 and 5.69 mA cm−2. However, devices with studied HELs show a reduction in FF as compared to the reference device due to an increase in series resistance. Such a significant enhancement in Voc and Jsc values demonstrates the great advantage of HELs for improving the performance of OSCs. Devices D and E exhibited a PCE of about 3.21 and 3.56%, showing an increase of about 22.5% and 35.9% as compared to the reference device.
To verify the effect of our new HELs, we subsequently fabricated the devices using SubNc as a donor. Fig. 3(b) shows the energy level diagram of SubNc/C60 devices. The fabricated structures of solar cell devices are as follows:
Device F: ITO/SubNc (6 nm)/C60 (33.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm),
Device G: ITO/TPDI (5 nm)/SubNc (6 nm)/C60 (33.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm),
Device H: ITO/TBDI (5 nm)/SubNc (6 nm)/C60 (33.5 nm)/BCP (8.0 nm)/Al (100 nm).

Fig. 4(b) describes the OSC characteristics of SubNc devices. In Device F (SubNc/C60 reference device), Voc was 0.84 V, Jsc was 6.83 mA cm−2, FF was 56.09% and PCE was 3.23%. After incorporating HELs, no major changes were observed in the Voc values of Devices G and H. Devices G and H showed Voc values of 0.84 and 0.85 V, similar to the reference device. There was an enormous increase in Jsc values in Devices G and H, which were increased to 8.13 mA cm−2 and 7.95 mA cm−2. However, FF showed an increase, in contrast to Devices D and E. The FF was noticed to be about 59.86 and 62.50% in Devices E and F. The PCE of Devices G and H was measured to be about 4.17% and 4.15%, which is almost 29.1% more than that of the reference device.
In general, the inverse relationship between Voc and dark saturation current has been reported in the literature. In Fig. 5, the dark current saturation densities of HEL incorporated and reference devices at −0.50 and −0.75 V are shown. For the SubPc/C60 combination, the dark current values for Devices D and E at 0.75V are ∼10−4 mA cm−2 which is higher than ∼10−5 mA cm−2 for reference Device A. In contrast, the SubNc/C60 active layer combination shows different results. The level of leakage current at 0.75 V in Devices G and H was decreased by about one order of magnitude compared with reference Device F, i.e. from ∼10−5 to ∼10−6 mA cm−2. These results illustrate that the highest Voc was achieved in SubPc/C60 even with high dark saturation current, whereas there was almost no effect on Voc even when the dark current was reduced. The results in two different systems confirm that Voc is independent of the dark current values, i.e. the dark current does not influence the Voc directly even when using different HELs with almost same LUMO levels.
As we have reported in our earlier paper, ΔEHOMO (HOMO energy level difference between the HEL and SubPc donor) is a very important factor which affects the Voc value directly, and 0.2–0.3 eV of ΔEHOMO is the optimum condition to achieve the highest Voc. Here, both of these new HELs completely satisfied this condition with SubPc/C60. TPDI and TBDI ΔEHOMO values in relation to SubPc donor are about 0.28 eV and 0.33 eV, which are favorable enough to increase the Voc to the highest level. In the case of SubNc/C60, ΔEHOMO values of TPDI and TBDI devices are about 0.06 and 0.15 eV, which are considerably less for achieving the maximum Voc. The ability of hole-extraction of HELs is energetically better for SubPc/C60 due to the increase of built-in potential by the appropriate energy level difference between HEL and SubPc donor HOMO levels. However, such an effect in the SubNc/C60 system does not work properly due to similar HOMO energy levels of donor and HEL materials.
Another important feature of both HELs is that they have high hole mobilities on the order of ∼10−3 magnitude which are significantly better than those of SubPc and SubNc donors (10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Therefore, high mobility HELs extract holes easily from the donor layer and increase the Jsc rapidly. The Jsc enhancement can be seen in both the HEL incorporated devices. In Devices D, E, G, and H, high hole mobility contributes a lot to the Jsc enhancement.
The EQE values of Devices A and D–H are shown in Fig. 6. Reference Device A of SubPc/C60 exhibited an EQE of only 37%, while Devices D and E which are TPDI and TBDI incorporated devices exhibited an improved EQE of ∼45% and ∼51% in the wavelength range of 500 to 606 nm. Device F exhibited an EQE of ∼45%, while for Devices G and H EQE improvement was ∼62%, mainly in the wavelength range of 545 to 725 nm. Therefore, EQE enhancements by HELs in both the SubPc/C60 and SubNc/C60 based devices are quite effective in the donor absorption wavelength region. This indicates that the studied HELs help in effective hole transportation to the electrode from donor materials.

In this work, we have synthesized two new HEL materials, TPDI and TBDI, for their application in OSCs. These materials possess a high mobility of about ∼6.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼5.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.3 MV cm−2 electric field. Their HOMO–LUMO energy levels are 5.32–2.02 eV and 5.25–1.98 eV. When these materials were implemented as the HEL in the SubPc/C60 device, the Voc increased to the highest level with improvement in the device efficiency. Similarly, HEL incorporated SubNc/C60 solar cell devices also improve the performance by boosting the Jsc. We believe that these new HEL materials are quite effective and can be used for improving the performances of OSCs in future device applications.
