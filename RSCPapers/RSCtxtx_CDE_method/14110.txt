Two new organic sensitizers (JK-313 and JK-314) possessing bulky cyclic thiourea functionalized triphenylamine as an electron donor were designed and synthesized. Especially, JK-314 showed a strong molar absorption coefficient and a red-shifted absorption compared with JK-313 due to its planar indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer. An indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer as well as bulky groups on the cyclic thiourea plays a key role in preventing both the intermolecular aggregation and undesired charge recombination in DSSCs, which resulted in an improvement in both short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Under standard AM 1.5G solar conditions, JK-314 based DSSCs in the presence of polymer gel electrolytes showed an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.44%. It is one of the highest values in organic dye based DSSCs ever reported.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered one of the alternatives to the silicon-based solar cells because of their low-cost production and simple device fabrication. Organic dyes in DSSCs have a number of advantages such as easy tuning of photophysical and electrochemical properties through molecular design and low-cost synthesis routes compared to ruthenium metal complexes. Therefore, molecular design for organic dyes has been widely investigated for efficient DSSCs so far. Organic dyes for use in DSSCs are generally divided into three segments, namely electron donor, π-conjugated spacer, and electron acceptor. To improve the photon-to-current conversion efficiency in DSSCs, a variety of electron donor groups such as triphenylamine, coumarin, indoline, and fluorene were employed in the aspect of molecular engineering. In particular, the triphenylamine electron donor has attracted much attention due to its unique photo-physical properties depending on the nature of substituents. For example, the incorporation of cyclic thiourea groups possessing bulky alkyl groups at N atoms of cyclic thiourea into this donor unit enhances the electron donor ability of organic dyes and suppresses both the intermolecular aggregation and undesired charge recombination in DSSCs. Based on these characteristics, An and Chen have recently reported cyclic thiourea functionalized organic dyes and their DSSC performances. The DSSC device based on (E)-3-(5′-(4-(bis(1,3-dihexyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-5-yl)amino)-phenyl)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid(AZ6) with an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte showed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE: 7.29%). However, the π-conjugation linker (spacer) as well as cyclic thiourea functionalized electron donors in the AZ6 series affects the PCE significantly. Therefore, we envisioned that further improvement can be achieved by varying some functional units.

For the achievement of highly efficient DSSCs, organic dyes should have an intense and wide absorption from the visible to the near IR region in order to gain high PCE, especially short-circuit current (Jsc). Thus, the adaptation of the π-conjugation spacer maintaining a co-planarity between door and acceptor units is a key factor to obtain the panchromatic absorption. Keeping this in mind, we design and synthesize a new organic dye (JK-314) possessing a planar and highly π-conjugated spacer unit with indeno[1,2-b]thiophene. To investigate the effect of the spacer on both photo-physical properties and DSSC performances, we also synthesize JK-313 with a bithiophene/phenyl spacer, as shown in Fig. 1. Herein, we report the investigation of photo-physical properties of JK-313 and JK-314 with a different spacer and DSSC performance using two new dyes.

Two JK-313 and JK-314 sensitizers were prepared in high yields via multi-step processes that involved the Suzuki cross-coupling of 4 or 9 with the corresponding dioxaborolane, followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine in acetonitrile and chloroform, as shown in Scheme 1. All intermediates were also obtained in high yields, and synthesis details are described in the Experimental section. The molecular structures of JK-313 and JK-314 were confirmed using spectroscopic methods, such as NMR and elemental analysis.



Fig. 2 shows the normalized UV/vis absorption and emission spectra of the JK-313 and JK-314 dyes recorded in THF. The absorption spectrum of JK-313 displays two intense bands at 354 nm (ε = 37200 dm3 mol−1 cm−1) and 460 nm (ε = 20600 dm3 mol−1 cm−1), which are due to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated molecule. Under the same conditions, JK-314 that contains the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer exhibits red-shifted absorption bands at 361 nm (ε = 63000 dm3 mol−1 cm−1) and at 482 nm (ε = 40300 dm3 mol−1 cm−1) as compared to the JK-313 dye. In addition, absorption of JK-314 at longer wavelength is remarkably red-shifted (ca. 40 nm) compared to that of AZ6, which is one of the organic dyes possessing a cyclic thiourea unit. These results indicate that the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene unit as a spacer allows JK-314 dye to have effective π-conjugation throughout the molecule. When two dyes are adsorbed onto nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes, relatively broad and red-shifted absorption bands compared to those of the corresponding solution spectra are observed in all cases. In particular, the absorption band is significantly broadened and tailed-off at about 700 nm for JK-314. From the viewpoint of harvesting the solar energy and obtaining large photocurrent, the absorption of JK-314 is highly desirable. In addition, this observation can be clearly explained by a spacer difference between two dyes. Indeed, the cyclic thiourea-functionalized compound, JK-314, showed a significant red-shift absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient relative to the corresponding analogue, JK-313, due to the coplanar nature of the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer. Upon excitation at ∼360 nm, the JK-313 and JK-314 dyes display strong red emissions in the fluid state at ambient temperature. As shown in Fig. 2, JK-314 emits at λmax = 624 nm, about 19 nm red-shifted, compared to that (λmax = 605 nm) of JK-313, which is consistent with those of absorption. Details of photo-physical properties of JK-313 and JK-314 are summarized in Table 1.

We performed the molecular orbital calculation for JK-313 and JK-314 in the gas phase to gain insight into the geometrical configuration and photo-physical properties using B3LYP/6-31G*. The dihedral angle between the phenyl ring and the bithiophene in the optimized structure of JK-313 is 23.2°, while the dihedral angle between the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene and the thiophene for JK-314 is 0.2° (see ESI). Based on these geometrical optimizations, we found that the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer is almost coplanar with the thiophene, leading to effective π-conjugation throughout the molecules. Fig. 3 displays the isodensity plots of the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1) of two dyes and the calculated excitation energy characteristics of both compounds are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3, all compounds show that electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor segment occurs effectively. The HOMO levels of JK-313 and JK-314 are mainly dominated by π-orbital contribution of the triphenylamine/cyclic thiourea electron donor unit, while the LUMO levels are largely delocalized at the electron acceptor unit of cyanoacrylic acid. The contribution of electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO is about 70% in both JK-313 and JK-314. Therefore, we confirm that electronic transitions of both compounds are originated from HOMO to LUMO. In addition, the resultant electron distribution strongly supports the fact that electron injection from the excited state of dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 will be facilitated.

Electrochemical properties of these dyes were evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate. TiO2 films stained with two dyes were used as working electrodes. The oxidation of the two dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film shows a reversible couple at 1.26 V for JK-313 and 1.10 V for JK-314versus the standard hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. The oxidation potential of JK-314 is less positive than that of JK-313, which is due to the enhancement of π-conjugation caused by the coplanar indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer. However, two dyes have more positive oxidation potential than I−/I3− redox potential, which implies that the reduction process of dyes will be facilitated by the redox couple of the electrolyte. The LUMO energies (ELUMO) of JK-313 and JK-314 calculated from the oxidation potential and the E0–0 values determined from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra are listed in Table 1. The ELUMO of JK-313 (−1.01 V vs. NHE) and JK-314 (−1.12 V vs. NHE) is sufficiently negative compared to the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE). Thus, the downhill energy offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in both dyes ensures the thermodynamic driving force for electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2.


In order to investigate the effect of the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer on the DSSC performance, we fabricated DSSCs based on the quasi-solid state electrolyte using JK-313 and JK-314. Details for the fabrication of DSSCs are described in the Experimental section and photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on JK-313 and JK-314 is summarized in Table 3.

Fig. 4 shows the action spectra of monochromatic incident-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for DSSCs based on two dyes in two different electrolytes. The IPCE spectrum of JK-314 is red-shifted by about 30 nm as compared to that of JK-313, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum. The IPCE value (%) based on JK-314 is slightly lower than that of JK-313 in the region of 400–600 nm (maximum value, JK-313: 80% at 510 nm; JK-314: 74% at 490 nm). The IPCE spectrum of JK-314, however, is much broader and its integral is significantly larger compared to that of JK-313.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs was obtained using either an iodine or a polymer gel electrolyte. An iodine electrolyte consists of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-n-propylimidazoleium iodide (DMPImI), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, while a gel electrolyte consists of 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 5 wt% poly(vinylidene-fluoride-co-hexafluoro) propylene (PVDF-HFP) in anhydrous acetonitrile. Fig. 4 (left) shows a photocurrent density–voltage curve for the DSSCs based on two sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions. The JK-313 and JK-314 based cells in the presence of the iodine electrolyte gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.66 and 15.56 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.719 and 0.725 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76 and 0.76, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.51 and 8.61%, respectively. The conversion efficiency of JK-314 is comparable to that of JK-306, (E)-3-{5′-{4-[bis(2′,4′-dihexyloxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino]phenyl}-2,2′-bithioph-ene-5-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid, based DSSCs (8.52%, Jsc = 16.14 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.75 V, FF = 0.71). As shown in Fig. 4, Jsc values of JK-314 increased dramatically relative to that of JK-313. The better Jsc of JK-314 than that of JK-313 is responsible for the broad and red-shifted absorption of JK-314 with high molar extinction coefficient. In addition, this result can be due to the broad IPCE spectrum of JK-314 rather than that of JK-313 because the integral of the IPCE spectrum is generally related to the value of Jsc in DSSC performance. In the presence of the polymer gel electrolyte, the similar results are observed in two new dye based DSSCs (see Table 2). The overall conversion efficiencies in the polymer gel electrolyte, however, are slightly lower than those in the iodine electrolyte (η = 7.37 for JK-313 and η = 8.44 for JK-314). Consequently, the improvement of the JK-314 based DSSC may be originated from the introduction of the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer, which serves effective π-conjugation over an entire conjugated system. In addition, the efficiency of 8.61% is one of the highest values for organic sensitizer based DSSCs.


Fig. 5 shows the electron diffusion coefficients (De) and lifetimes (τe) of the DSSCs employing different dyes (i.e.JK-313 and JK-314) and electrolytes (i.e. liquid and gel electrolytes) displayed as a function of Jsc and Voc, respectively. No significant differences among the De values were found under the identical Jsc conditions by varying the kinds of dyes and electrolytes. However, the τe values were shown to be significantly affected by the different dyes and electrolyte conditions and the results were also well consistent with those of Voc. The increasing order of the τe values was JK-313 < JK-314 under the identical Voc conditions in both cases of liquid and gel electrolytes and the results are also well consistent with those of Voc shown in Table 3 (or Fig. 4). However, the lifetimes of the cells employing the gel electrolyte were shown to be somewhat shorter than those of the cells filled with the liquid electrolyte. It is believed that the reduced mobility of I3− ions in the gel electrolyte facilitated the electron recombination on the surface of dye-attached TiO2 nanoparticles.


The effects of the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer on photovoltaic characteristics were further elucidated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Fig. 6. A typical Nyquist diagram of DSSCs consists of three semi-circles, which represent the catalytic reaction at the platinum counter electrode (high frequency: on the left circle of the Nyquist graph), the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (medium frequency: on the middle circle of the Nyquist graph), and the carrier transport by ions in the electrolyte (low frequency: on the right circle of the Nyquist graph). When the ac impedances of the cells were measured under dark conditions, two well-resolved semi-circles were observed in the low to medium frequency region, as shown in Fig. 6. In the dark under forward bias (−0.70 V), the semicircle in the region of medium frequency represents the dark reaction impedance caused by electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In the dark, the radius of the semicircle in the region of medium frequency increased in the order of JK-313 (70.06 Ω) < JK-314 (70.46 Ω) for the iodine electrolyte and JK-313 (58.68 Ω) < JK-314 (59.30 Ω) for the polymer gel electrolyte. In general, the increased radius of the semicircle in the region of medium frequency represents the reduced electron recombination rate at the dyed TiO2–electrolyte interface. Therefore, these observations are in good accordance with the trends of the Voc and τe values. Based on the results from electron diffusion coefficients, lifetimes and EIS measurements, the combination of the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer and bulky cyclic-thiourea electron donor brings about the suppression of recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in an enlargement of Voc. The details for this mechanism, however, are still unclear and needed further studies.


All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled from appropriate reagents. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and TCI. 1,3-Dihexyl-5-iodo-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one was prepared according to the literature procedure.1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Chemical shifts δ were calibrated against TMS as an internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Elba Instruments CHNS-O EA 1108 analyzer. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a VersaSTAT 3 (Princeton Applied Research). Anhydrous acetonitrile was used as the solvent and 0.1 M of tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte. TiO2 films stained with the sensitizers were used as working electrodes, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The measurements were done at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and the ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple was used as an internal reference.


The electron diffusion coefficients (De) and lifetimes (τe) in the photoelectrodes with different dyes and co-adsorbents were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltage (SLIM-PCV). A diode laser (λ = 635 nm) was modulated using a function generator and the transient responses were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity. The initial laser intensity was constant at 90 mW cm−2 and was attenuated up to approximately 10 mW cm−2 using a series of ND filters positioned at the front side of DSSCs (TiO2 thickness = 8.4 μm; active area = 0.04 cm2). The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. The De value was obtained by a time constant (τc) determined by fitting a decay of the photocurrent transient with exp(−t/τc) and the TiO2 film thickness (ω) using the equation, De = ω2/(2.77τc). The τe value was also determined by fitting a decay of photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τe).


For the preparation of DSSCs, a washed FTO glass plate (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar 2.3 mm thickness) was fabricated using a modified procedure of ref. 13. The first FTO glass plate was prepared by using doctor blade printing TiO2 paste (Solaronix, Ti-nanoxide T/SP) and the second opaque layer containing 400 nm sized anatase particles (CCIC, PST-400C) was coated for the purpose of light scattering. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed into the dye (JK-313 and JK-314) solution (0.3 mM in THF/EtOH = 1/2) and kept at room temperature for 18 hours. Counter electrodes were prepared by coating a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg Pt in 1 mL ethanol) on a FTO plate. A drop of electrolyte solution (iodine electrolyte: 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.8 M t-butylpyridine in acetonitrile; gel electrolyte: 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.8 M t-butylpyridine, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in acetonitrile) was placed on the drilled hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness).

Two novel cyclic thiourea-functionalized organic dyes with bulky alkyl chains, JK-313 and JK-314, have been synthesized and their photophysical properties and DSSC characteristics have been investigated as well. Two dyes show strong absorptions from the UV to the visible region with a vertical electron density distribution between HOMO and LUMO, and stable electrochemical behaviors, which makes them suitable organic dyes for DSSCs. These complexes demonstrate very high IPCE (%) up to 80%. The enhancement of Jsc in JK-314 based DSSCs was observed relative to JK-313 based DSSCs, which is attributed to the planar indeno[1,2-b]thiophene spacer. In addition, for JK-314 based DSSCs in the presence of I−/I3− and polymer gel electrolytes, the significant improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE: 8.61% at I−/I3− and 8.44% at polymer gel) is observed. We believe that the development of highly efficient DSSC devices is possible through structure modification, and work on these is now in progress.
