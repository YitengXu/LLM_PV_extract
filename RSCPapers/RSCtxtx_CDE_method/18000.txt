Three-dimensional π-conjugated dendrimers are a class of structure defined macromolecules for use in organic electronics. Herein, a new family of dendritic oligothiophenes (DOT-p-DPPs) that are functionalized with the diketopyrrolopyrrole group at the periphery were synthesized by a precise stepwise approach. The chemical structure and the monodisperse nature of these DOT-p-DPPs were confirmed by NMR, MALDI-TOF MS, HR MS, and GPC measurements. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra and cyclic voltammetry data of these compounds were also measured. Small band gaps (∼1.8 eV) and almost identical HOMO/LUMO energy levels (−5.2/−3.5 eV) were measured for these DOT-p-DPPs independent of the molecular size. However, the molecular molar extinction coefficient (ε) of DOT-p-DPPs was found to be linearly correlated with the number of terminal DPP units, and a high ε of 3.6 × 105 cm−1 L mol−1 was measured for the bigger molecules. These results in combination with theoretical calculation results confirm that the frontier molecular orbitals are mostly localized over the peripheral DPP units. The applications of DOT-p-DPPs in organic solar cells as the electron donor are presented. However, unfavorable nanophase separation and lower DOT-p-DPP content in the blended films led to poor device performance. The two photon absorption cross section of these DPP decorated dendrimers was measured, and high cross section values of over 2000 GM were measured for these dendritic molecules, among which the G1 dendrimer 6T-p-DPP with a high TPA cross section value close to 7000 GM was achieved.

Conjugated polymers and small molecules are among the most widely investigated organic semiconducting materials for use in organic electronics. Among them, conjugated polymers are considered to have the advantages of a superior film-forming ability, good processability, and high device performance. However, polymeric materials possess their inherent drawbacks, including wide molecular weight distributions, poor regioregularity control, and undesired end group effects, which usually affect the optical and electronic properties of the materials a lot, and consequently lead to a poor batch-to-batch reproducibility in device application. Conjugated small molecules, on the other hand, possess a well-defined and monodisperse molecular structure, which are considered to have advantages of good reproducibility in device application. In addition, owing to their controllable and defined molecular structure, conjugated small molecules are also often used as the model compounds for structure–property–performance relationship studies. However, conjugated small molecules also have drawbacks of strong crystallization tendency in solid films, which brings difficulties in thin film deposition and poor thermal stability in device application.

Conjugated dendrimers that are composed of conjugation moieties over the molecular skeleton are a new type of polymer with three-dimensional hyperbranched molecular structures. Unlike conjugated polymers, conjugated dendrimers have a defined and controllable molecular structure owing to their precise step-by-step synthesis approach. In addition, higher-generation conjugated dendrimers could have molecular weight as high as 10000 Da. Therefore, conjugated dendrimers are a kind of structure defined macromolecule, which is expected to have both advantages of good processability of polymers and good reproducibility of small molecules. Until now, conjugated dendrimers based on benzene, thiophene and carbazole units have been synthesized and investigated, among which thiophene based ones, named also dendritic oligothiophenes (DOTs), are highly interesting in organic electronics owing to their unique optical and electronic properties originating from the extended π-conjugation chain. Not only the all-thiophene dendrons and dendrimers have been synthesized and characterized, but also dendritic oligothiophenes functionalized at the core, at the branching π-bridge, and at the periphery have been developed. Various functional groups, including porphyrin, dibenzo-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (dibenzo-BODIPY), pyridine or methylpyridinium, perylenediimide derivatives (PDI), benzothiadiazole (BT), bisthienoimidazoles, pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline, squaraine (SQ), fluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (FHBC), metal complexes, anchoring groups, or electron donating and withdrawing groups, have been introduced for such a molecular modification. The applications of these functionalized dendritic macromolecules in nonlinear optical devices, organic electroluminescence devices, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells, in metal nanoparticle synthesis, and in biosensoring have been reported, demonstrating versatile properties and application aspects of these thiophene dendrons and dendrimers.
Especially, the all-thiophene dendrons and dendrimers exhibit quite promising photovoltaic performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.7% was achieved for the 42T: PC61BM based device, which was further improved to 3.5% when using PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The organic solar cell using branched quinquethiophene based dendrimers showed also the highest PCE of 3.1% when blended with PC71BM as the acceptor. Knowing that the maximum absorption wavelength of these all-thiophene dendrimers is around 420 nm, a moderate PCE of more than 3% confirms that 3D conjugated dendrimers could be an excellent molecular skeleton for constructing conjugated molecules for OSC application. On the other hand, Zheng et al. first reported that π-conjugated dendritic structure is able to enhance the two-photon absorption (TPA) of organic chromophores, and a TPA cross-section of 1412 GM (1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s per photon) was achieved for six branched dendrimers, which is much larger than that of the conventional single branched chromophores. Since then, various dendrictic molecules have been developed for TPA application, and high TPA cross section values over 104 GM have been reported in the literature. Inspired by the good photovoltaic performances of low band gap polymers, in this paper, a new family of thiophene dendrimers decorated with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) groups at the periphery was synthesized and characterized. Such a chemical structure modification greatly reduces the optical band gap and increases the light harvesting ability of the thiophene dendrimers. The chemical structures of these molecules were proved by NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF MS and HR MS. The monodisperse nature of these molecules was investigated by MALDI-TOF MS and GPC analyses. Optical and electrochemical properties will also be discussed. Finally, the photovoltaic as well as two-photon absorption properties of these novel molecules were investigated in detail to obtain a better understanding of these materials’ properties.

Chemicals were purchased and used without further purification: 2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP-H) (Suna Tech Inc.), n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi, 2.4 M in n-hexane, J&K Scientific Ltd), [Ir(OMe)(COD)]2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) (Strem Chemicals), 4,4′-bis(di-tert-butyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (dtbpy) (Sigma-Aldrich), Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich), HP(t-Bu)3·BF4 (Sigma-Aldrich), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, Alfa Aesar), K2CO3 (Enox®), K3PO4 (Enox®), and 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (HBpin) (Sigma-Aldrich). Solvents were purified and dried by usual methods prior to use and typically used under an inert gas atmosphere. PC61BM was purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc. (Beijing).


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Chemical shifts are expressed in δ (ppm), and were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) via the residual non-deuterated solvent peaks (CDCl3: 1H NMR: 7.26 ppm, 13C NMR: 77.0 ppm; C2D2Cl4: 1H NMR: 6.00 ppm, 13C NMR: 74.0 ppm) as an internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), and multiplet (m). Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed using a Bruker Autoflex Speed using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene] malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix. High resolution mass spectrometry (HR MS) was performed using a Bruker ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF (operation mode: MALDI; matrix: DCTB). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed using a Waters Breeze separation module apparatus with THF as the eluent (flow rate 1 mL min−1, 35 °C). The number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of compounds were determined by GPC analysis relative to polystyrene standards. UV-vis spectra of the new materials in chloroform (CHCl3) solution and thin film were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV-vis spectrophotometer. For UV-vis absorption spectrum measurements in solution, three concentrated solutions (around 10−4 mol L−1) were prepared independently, each of which was further diluted to obtain three dilute solutions (with concentration around 10−7–10−6 mol L−1) for UV-vis absorption measurements. The absorption spectra of the dilute solutions were recorded, and the data points of the absorbance at a certain wavelength vs. concentration were then plotted. A good linear relationship was found for all these compounds, suggesting that no obvious intermolecular interaction was found in such a concentration range. The molecular molar extinction coefficient (ε) was obtained from the slope of the best-fit line over the abovementioned data points according to the Beer–Lambert law equation), A = ε·l·c. Thin film samples for UV-vis spectra measurements were prepared by spin-casting a chloroform solution on quartz glass. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the DOT-c-BTs in the chloroform solution were obtained with an F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed with an RST-3000 Electrochemistry Workstation (Suzhou Risetech Instrument Co., Ltd). All CV measurements were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration under a nitrogen atmosphere. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed using a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6)/dichloromethane (DCM) solution at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1. A Pt disc (ϕ = 1 mm) embedded in Teflon was used as the working electrode. The surface was polished before use. A Pt sheet (∼1 cm2) and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. After the measurements, a small amount of ferrocene was added into the solution and the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal standard. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tests were performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin 200 kV field-emission electron microscope (FEI). Specimens for the TEM experiments were obtained by transferring the floating blended films from the water onto the 200 mesh copper grid. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed by using a Dimension 3100 Scanning Probe Microscope in tapping mode.
For nonlinear optical experiments, the excitation pulse (1 kHz, 240–2600 nm, pulse width <120 fs) was generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-F-UV2, Spectra-Physics) pumped by a regeneratively amplified femtosecond Ti-sapphire laser system (800 nm, 1 kHz, pulse energy 4 mJ, pulse width <120 fs, Spitfire Pro-F1KXP, Spectra-Physics), which was seeded by a femtosecond Ti-sapphire oscillator (80 MHz, pulse width <70 fs, 710–920 nm, Maitai XF-1, Spectra-Physics). The data were obtained by the two-photon excited fluorescence method with fluorescein (80 μM in water, pH = 11) as a reference. Two-photon excited fluorescence spectra of the samples were recorded in a THF solution at room temperature by using an Ocean Optics s2000 spectrometer in conjunction with a fiber coupler head. The laser beam was focused by an f = 10 cm lens, and the solution sample in a 1 cm fluorimeter cuvette (four optically clear windows) was placed at a fixed distance of ∼13.5 cm from the focusing lens.

A solution of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (870 mg, 4.89 mmol) in chloroform (50 mL) was added to DPP-H (4 g, 4.65 mmol) dissolved in well-degassed chloroform (150 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen protection. The reaction mixture was protected from light and stirred at 0 °C for 4 h, then allowed to warm to room temperature, and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated to 50 mL, water (100 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with chloroform (100 mL × 3).

In a glove box, a 5 mL flask was charged with [Ir(OMe)(COD)]2 (30.0 mg, 45.0 μmol, 4%). HBPin (2.70 g, 2.10 mmol, 2 eq.) was added to the [Ir(OMe)(COD)]2 flask.

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/DOTs: PC61BM/LiF/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonic cleaning with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 30 min each. After an additional treatment for 30 minutes in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber, a thin layer (30–40 nm) of PEDOT: PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter) was spin-coated onto each substrate at 3500 rpm for 1 min, and the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). After annealing in a glove box for 124 or 10 minutes, the substrates was cooled to room temperature. Compounds DOTs and PC60BM were dissolved in chloroform (CF) and then stirred for 4 h. The substrates were spin-coated with the solution of DOTs: PC61BM in chloroform to form the photoactive layer. The cathode made of LiF (1 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) was sequentially deposited by vacuum evaporation under high vacuum (<10−4 Pa). The effective area of the devices was 0.09 cm2.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 2400 source meter under a simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) sun light generated by white light from a halogen tungsten lamp, filtered by using a Schott GG385 UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight filter. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were measured under simulated one sun operation conditions using bias light from a 532 nm solid state laser (Changchun New Industries, MGL-III-532). Light from a 150 W tungsten halogen lamp (Osram 64610) was used as probe light and modulated with a mechanical chopper before passing the monochromator (Zolix, Omni-λ300) to select the wavelength. The response was recorded as the voltage by an I–V converter (DNR-IV Convertor, Suzhou D&R Instruments), using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR 830). A calibrated Si cell was used as the reference. The device for EQE measurements was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container.

2,5-Bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP-H, Scheme S1) is the most widely used starting material for synthesizing DPP based materials. However, DPP-H is not suitable for peripheral functionalization of DOTs, since DPP-H has two reactive terminal C–H positions. To solve this problem, the α-hexyl-thienyl group was selected as the terminal blocking group. To ensure the necessary solubility and film-forming properties of the target dendritic oligothiophenes, 2-octyldodecyl was selected as the solubilizing group at the N-position of the DPP unit.

Scheme S1 depicts the synthetic route to the key precursor B-DPP-T (ESI Scheme S1). 3-(5-Bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP-Br) was synthesized by bromination of DPP-H using 1.1 equivalents N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), which gave a 55% yield (Scheme S1, reaction i). Reaction of lithiated 2-hexylthiophene (T) with 2-isopropyloxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane gave the corresponding boronic ester B-T in 90% yield (Scheme S1, reaction ii). Suzuki coupling of DPP-Br with B-T by using [Pd2(dba)3]·CHCl3/HP(tBu)3BF4 as a catalyst gave the asymmetrical DPP derivative DPP-T in 94% yield (Scheme S1, reaction iii). Iridium-catalyzed borylation of DPP-T by using [Ir(OMe)(COD)]2/dtbpy as a catalyst gave the key precursor B-DPP-T in 85% yield (Scheme S1, reaction iv).

Scheme 1 depicts the synthetic route to the first generation dendron 3T-p-DPP and dendrimer 6T-p-DPP. Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of diiodinated terthiophene 3T-I and B-DPP-T (1:2 mol/mol) gave the first generation 1st dendron 3T-p-DPP in 80% yield (Scheme 1, reaction i). Side reactions within the Suzuki coupling reaction include (1) homocoupling of B-DPP-T to yield a dimer T-DPP-DPP-T; (2) homocoupling of 3T-I with a follow-up Suzuki coupling with B-DPP-T to give the higher order oligomer T-DPP-3T-3T-DPP-T, which is confirmed by mass-spectrometric analysis of the crude products (ESI Scheme S2 and Fig. S1). Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of the tetrabrominated sexithiophene core 6T-Br with four equivalents of B-DPP-T under the same coupling conditions gave the first generation 1st DPP-terminated thiophene dendrimer 6T-p-DPP in a yield of 81% (Scheme 1, reaction ii). Both 3T-p-DPP and 6T-p-DPP were purified by preparative size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, Bio-Rad Beads SX1) eluting with THF. One step further, iridium-catalyzed borylation of 3T-p-DPP selectively gave the corresponding boronic ester B-3T-p-DPP (Scheme 1, reaction iii), which is a basic building block for the construction of higher generational dendrons and dendrimers.
The 2nd generation DPP-terminated dendron 9T-p-DPP was synthesized by Suzuki coupling of the tetraiodinated G2 dendron 9T-I and four equivalents of boronic ester B-DPP-T in a yield of 62% (Scheme 2, reaction i). The side products were separated successfully by SEC with THF as the eluent. An alternative synthetic route to 9T-p-DPP was Suzuki coupling of the diiodinated terthiophene 3T-I and the G1 boronic ester B-3T-p-DPP (Scheme 2, reaction ii). However, side products including 6T-p-DPP and (3T-3T-p-DPP)2 formed (ESI Scheme S3) originating from the homocoupling of B-3T-p-DPP and homocoupling of 3T-I with a follow-up Suzuki coupling with B-3T-p-DPP, respectively (Scheme S3 and Fig. S2 in ESI). Owing to the similar hydrodynamic molecular volume for these products, it is difficult to purify the final compound by SEC purification. Only after multiple SEC column chromatography separations, pure 9T-p-DPP was obtained in a yield of 64%. The G2 DPP-terminated dendrimer 18T-p-DPP was synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling of the tetrabrominated G1 dendrimer 6T-Br with four equivalents of the G1 boronic ester B-3T-p-DPP in 65% yield (Scheme 2, reaction iii). Purification of 18T-p-DPP by preparative SEC was found to be much easier than that of 9T-p-DPP, which was ascribed to the large hydrodynamic molecular volume difference for the product and side products.
The 3rd generation DPP-terminated dendron 21T-p-DPP was synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling of the tetraiodinated G2 dendron 9T-I and four equivalents of the G1 boronic ester B-3T-p-DPP in 63% yield (Scheme 3). Purification of 21T-p-DPP was found to be more difficult than that of 18T-p-DPP. On the one hand, the molecular weight of 21T-p-DPP is close to 10000 Da, reaching the separation limit for the preparative SEC column we used. The uncompleted coupled side products of this reaction, on the other hand, have similar hydrodynamic molecular volumes as the product. Nevertheless, the final compound 21T-p-DPP can be purified by multiple SEC column chromatography, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry (vide infra).

All these compounds are highly soluble in organic solvent for their hyperbranched structure and the multiple alkyl side chains on the DPP units. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were then characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF MS and high resolution MS. Owing to the unsymmetrical molecular structure of these dendrimers, 1H NMR spectra of these compounds are rather complicated, especially for the higher-generation dendrimers. However, characteristic 1H resonance peaks can be clearly identified for the small molecules. Fig. S3 (ESI) shows the full 1H NMR spectra of DOT-p-DPPs. As can be seen from Fig. S3, all these DOT-p-DPPs showed characteristic 1H resonance peaks at 4.0 and 1.9 ppm (protons of –N–CH2–CH–R1(R2) on the DPP unit), 2.8 ppm (protons of Th–CH2–R on the terminal thiophene unit), 8.9 ppm (Ha and Hb, β-H of the core thiophene unit next to the DPP units, see more details in ESI Fig. S3), confirming the successful attachment of DPP units to the DOT periphery. Except for these characteristic proton resonances of the terminal DPP units, 1H resonance peaks of the core dendritic thiophene can also be clearly seen. Fig. S3b depicts the 1H NMR spectra of the small molecules (3T-p-DPP, 6T-p-DPP, 9T-p-DPP) in the aromatic region. For 3T-p-DPP, except for the characteristic 1H resonance peaks at 8.9 ppm (Ha and Hb, for the β-H of the core thiophene unit next to the DPP), characteristic doublet peak couples at δ = 7.34, 7.05 ppm (Hc and Hd) can be clearly distinguished, which are assigned to the α,β-protons of the central thiophene unit. Such a doublet peak couple is changed to a single peak at 7.08 ppm for the 6T-p-DPP molecule, which is reasonable since the central thiophene unit was homocoupled. Interestingly, all the resonance peaks up-field shifted for the 6T-p-DPP when compared with 3T-p-DPP, which could be due to the shielding effect of the conjugated wedge-shape dendron unit. It is worth noting that 1H NMR of 6T-p-DPP tends to be broader and featureless, which was ascribed to more intensive intermolecular interactions. Checking 1H NMR with other deuterated solvents, such as THF-d8, CD2Cl2, and C2D2Cl4, or diluting the solution could not yield a better resolution result. For 9T-p-DPP, a doublet peak at 7.34 ppm can also be clearly seen, which is ascribed to the α-proton of the central thiophene unit, confirming a wedge-shape dendron molecular structure of the 9T-p-DPP. The H resonance peaks become broader and featureless with the increase of molecular size (Fig. S3d in ESI), which was on the one hand ascribed to a more complicated molecular structure, and on the other hand to the increased intermolecular interactions. Nevertheless, 1H NMR peaks for the small molecules confirmed a defined molecular structure of them. In addition, it is fully confirmed that DPP units were successfully attached to the periphery of the dendritic oligothiophene core.

To further confirm the chemical structure of these compounds, mass spectra of these compounds were measured by MALDI-TOF MS and HR MS measurements. Fig. 1a shows the MALDI-TOF MS results of target DPP-functionalized thiophene dendrons and dendrimers with defined isotopic patterns, and the HR MS results are shown in ESI. The obtained MS data of these compounds are listed in Table 1. For small molecules (3T-p-DPP, 6T-p-DPP, 9T-p-DPP), the isotopic patterns fit very well to the simulated spectrometry, both for the MALDI-TOF MS and HR MS results (see ESI). For 18T-p-DPP and 21T-p-DPP, the HR-MS showed broad and featureless spectra, which were ascribed to the high molecular weight of these two compounds, which is close to the measurement limit of the instrument. However, the MALDI-TOF MS clearly showed the isotopic patterns of these two compounds, which fit very well to the simulated ones (see ESI). Nevertheless, the MS and NMR results unambiguously confirmed the chemical structures of the synthesized macromolecules. In addition, all these compounds show one predominant molecular ion peak signal (Fig. 1a), demonstrating an excellent monodispersity of these dendrons and dendrimers.

The molecular weight properties and polydispersities of these peripherally DPP-functionalized dendritic oligothiophenes were further studied by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The GPC traces of these compounds are depicted in Fig. 1b, and the calculated average molecular weights as well as the polydispersity of these compounds are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, wedge-shaped thiophene dendrons exhibit smaller hydrodynamic volumes than the corresponding dendrimers with similar molecular weights. For example, the G2 DPP-terminated dendron 9T-p-DPP has a larger retention volume than 6T-p-DPP, although 9T-p-DPP has only three thiophene units more than 6T-p-DPP, demonstrating a smaller hydrodynamic volume of 9T-p-DPP. A similar trend was also found in the TMS-protected all-thiophene dendrons and dendrimers, and this could be ascribed to the more condensed molecular structure wedge-shaped dendrons. For smaller derivatives (3T-p-DPP, 6T-p-DPP, 9T-p-DPP) investigated by GPC, the PDI indices were almost constant and ranged from 1.01 to 1.02, indicating a high degree of defined and monodisperse structure. Much broader GPC traces were found for 18T-p-DPP and 21T-p-DPP, leading to the slightly higher PDI values of 1.07 and 1.10, respectively. Such a broader GPC trace was ascribed to the formation of aggregates of dendritic molecules, which was also found in the all-thiophene dendrimers.

To investigate the molecular geometries and electronic structures of DOT-p-DPPs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program with the B3LYP/6-31G approach. Calculated optimal molecular conformations and molecular orbital surfaces of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are shown in Fig. 2 and the related data are listed in Table 2. As can be seen in Fig. 2, for DOT-p-DPPs, the electron density distributions of the HOMO and LUMO levels are both located in the peripheral DPP groups, which is in good accordance with the cyclic voltammetry results, where both 1st oxidation and reduction processes are ascribed to the oxidation and reduction of DPP units (vide infra). In addition, these results are also in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption results where the low energy absorption bands are ascribed to the DPP units. Slightly reduced optical band gaps were found for the bigger molecules, which could be attributed to slightly increased π-conjugation systems. The molecular dimensionality of a few nanometers was calculated for all these compounds. Especially, 18T-p-DPP and 21T-p-DPP have a molecular dimension of 6–7 nm, respectively, demonstrating synthesized single molecular organic nanoparticles (ESI Fig. S4).

The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of these DOT-p-DPPs and the reference compound T-DPP-T were measured, and the optical data are listed in Table 2. Fig. 3a shows the UV-vis absorption of these compounds in a chloroform solution. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, all compounds exhibit similar absorption patterns, which can be divided into two parts, a high-energy absorption band from 300 to 500 nm and a low-energy band from 500 to750 nm. The absorption band of these compounds in a short wavelength range (300–500 nm) was ascribed to the superimposition of the absorption of the conjugated oligothiophene unit with different conjugation lengths, supported by the linear correlation between the molar extinction coefficient and the total thiophene number of the dendritic oligothiophene core (Fig. 3b), which is similar to that in all-thiophene dendrons and dendrimers. On the other hand, the molar extinction coefficient of the long wavelength band (500–750 nm) was also found to be linearly correlated to the number of DPP units rather than to the number of thiophene units (Fig. 3b, insert). Therefore, such a low-energy absorption band was ascribed to the absorption of the peripheral DPP units. Owing to the multiple DPP units for the bigger molecules, a high molar extinction coefficient was obtained for these compounds. Nevertheless, a molar extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 105 cm−1 L mol−1 for both 18T-p-DPP and 21T-p-DPP is a high value for a structure defined macromolecule. Fig. 3c shows the absorption spectra of the DOT-p-DPPs in thin solid film. In comparison with the corresponding spectrum in the chloroform solution, the absorption spectrum in thin solid film was found be broader and red-shifted (Fig. 3c), which can be ascribed to the intensive intermolecular interaction of these molecules in solid film. The optical band gap (Eg) of these compounds determined from the absorption onset λonsetabs decreases slightly with the increase of molecular size (Table 2), indicating a slightly extended π-conjugation chain length of the DPP unit and the α-oligothiophene chain.

Fluorescence emission spectra of the peripherally DPP-functionalized dendritic oligothiophenes in chloroform are displayed in Fig. 3d. As can be seen from here, the reference compound T-DPP-T showed an emission band peaking at 652 nm. The emission band for the DOT-p-DPPs red-shifted slightly with the increase of molecular size, with the peak wavelength in the range of 670–680 nm, suggesting a slightly increased π-conjugation system in these molecules, which is in consistency with the optical band gap results. Interestingly, the emission wavelength of these dendrimers was found to be independent of the excitation wavelength, i.e. excitation on the dendritic thiophene core also leads to the emission of the DPP units (Fig. S5, ESI). These results indicate that the excited energy is more delocalized over the peripheral DPP units rather than within the dendritic oligothiophene core, suggesting an energy anti-funnel effect within these molecules. This is different from the behavior of all-thiophene dendrimers, where the excited state energy is more localized in the core part of the molecules.

The electrochemical properties of the DOT-p-DPPs were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Fig. 4a shows cyclic voltammograms of these DOT-p-DPPs, and the DPV curves of these compounds are shown in Fig. S6 in ESI. The redox potential data are listed in Table 2 for comparison. Interestingly, all these compounds showed one reversible reduction process over the negative potential range (0–−2.0 V). The standard reduction potentials were determined to be around −1.6 V vs. Fc+/Fc, which is close to that of the reference compound T-DPP-T. Therefore, such a reversible reduction process was ascribed to the reduction of the DPP units. Although the bigger molecules have more DPP units at the periphery, the anode or cathode peak currents (iap and icp) for the reduction of DPP normalized to the DOT-p-DPP concentration were found to be almost identical for all these compounds. This result suggests that only one of these DPP units was reduced in such a negative potential range.

The oxidation potentials of these compounds, on the other hand, were found to be dependent on the molecular structure. For example, the 1st generation dendron, 3T-p-DPP, displays three reversible oxidation processes (E0ox = 0.20, 0.30, and 0.55 V, respectively) during the positive potential sweeping. For comparison, the reference compound T-DPP-T showed two reversible oxidation processes with an E0ox of 0.30 and 0.56 V. For 6T-p-DPP, two oxidation processes were measured with E0ox = 0.20, 0.30 V, respectively, which is quite similar to that of 3T-p-DPP. Knowing that the 1st oxidation potentials for the trimethylsilane terminated thiophenedendron (3T-Si) and dendrimer (6T-Si) are 0.82 and 0.53 V, respectively, the measured 1st oxidation processes were then ascribed to the oxidation of peripheral DPP units as well. For larger dendrons and dendrimers (9T-p-DPP, 18T-p-DPP and 21T-p-DPP), the oxidation waves become broader, which could be due to the fact that these compounds are composed of multiple π-conjugated moieties. Nevertheless, the first oxidation potential could be obtained by DPV measurements, which was found to be negatively shifted with increasing the generation of the dendrons and dendrimers (see ESI Fig. S6). This was ascribed to the increased π-conjugation length with the increase of molecular size, which is in accordance with the shift trend of the UV-vis absorption band. It also worth noting that, although there is one reactive α-H at the core thiophene ring in the dendrons (3T-p-DPP, 9T-p-DPP and 21-p-DPP), neither dimerization nor electropolymerization was found during positive potential sweeping, which is unlike the all-thiophene dendrons where electrochemical dimerization was found for these compounds during CV sweeping. These results further confirmed that oxidation occurred on the peripheral DPP units, which could not undergo dimerization or polymerization.
HOMO/LUMO energy levels of these compounds were determined from the onset oxidation (Eonsetox) and the onset reduction potentials (Eonsetred) according to eqn (1) and (2),
EHOMO = −(Eonsetox + 5.10) (eV)
(1)
ELUMO = −(Eonsetred + 5.10) (eV)
(2)
ECVg = Eonsetox − Eonsetred (eV)
(3)
where
Eonsetox and Eonsetred represent the onset oxidation and the onset reduction potential values relative to the ferrocene/ferricenium couple, respectively, for which an energy level of −5.10 eV versus vacuum was taken. Energy levels of these compounds are listed in Fig. 4b. As can be seen here, all these compounds show similar HOMO–LUMO energy levels almost independent of the molecular structure. Again, this was ascribed to the fact that the frontier molecular orbitals are mostly localized over the peripheral DPP units.

In comparison with PC61BM, all these DOT-p-DPPs showed higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The higher LUMO energy levels of DOT-p-DPPs would enable electron transfer from DOT-p-DPPs to PCBM after photoexcitation. All these DOT-c-DPPs show low-lying HOMO levels of −5.1 eV, which could be beneficial for achieving high VOC when used in organic solar cells.

Solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells with the conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/DOT-p-DPP: PC61BM/LiF/Al (ITO: indium tin oxide; PEDOT: PSS: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfonate); PC61BM: [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) were fabricated and characterized, where DOT-p-DPPs and PC61BM were used as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. The DOT-p-DPP : PC61BM blend ratio (w/w) was optimized for each compound (see ESI for details), and the optimized photovoltaic performances of the optimized devices are given in Table 3. The current–voltage (J–V) curves under light illumination and EQE response spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively.

As can be seen from Table 3, the open circuit voltages (VOC) for these DOT-p-DPP based devices are in the range of 0.75–0.81 V, which are slightly higher when compared with the DPP based polymer based devices. The VOC was found to be slightly decreased with the increase of molecular size, which may be ascribed to the slightly higher HOMO energy level for the larger molecules (vide supra). Surprisingly, except for the 3T-p-DPP based device which showed a relatively low fill factor (FF) of 0.41, all the other DOT-p-DPP based devices showed high FF values with a highest number of 0.69. The high FF was also found for DPP polymer based devices. However, owing to the low short circuit current (JSC), all these DPP based devices showed a relatively low power conversion efficiency of around 1.0%. EQE spectra reflect also the low incident photon-to-current efficiency for these cells.
To better understand the reason for the low device performance, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the blended film were recorded. Fig. 6 presents TEM images of the DOT-p-DPPs:PC61BM films fabricated under optimal conditions. As can be seen, all blended films displayed an obviously large phase separation. Such an unusual nanophase separation was also found for DPP polymer: fullerene blended films. Such an unfavorable nanophase separation is adverse for the JSC, since photogenerated excitons cannot be dissociated efficiently and the electrons generated in the photoactive layer cannot be collected by the electrode efficiently. It is also worth noting that the optimized DOT-p-DPP:PC61BM blend ratio was found to be 1:4 or 1:5 (except for 3T-p-DPP, which has an optimized ratio of 2:1), indicating an extremely low electron donor content in this blended film. Increasing the DOT-p-DPP concentration led to poorer device performance (ESI, Fig. S8–S11, Tables S2–S5). Such a low electron donor content lowers the light absorption ability of the photoactive layer, which could be the 2nd reason for the low JSC of the devices. The surface morphologies of the DOT-p-DPP:PC61BM films were measured using an atomic force microscope, and the results are shown in Fig. S12 of ESI. For the 3T-p-DPP, 6T-p-DPP and 18T-p-DPP based films, rather smooth surfaces were measured, suggesting that the morphology on the surface of these films might be different from that in the bulk, whereas the 9T-p-DPP and 21T-p-DPP films show large aggregates on the surface, demonstrating a molecular shape related nanophase separation, which are in good accordance with the TEM results. Nevertheless, the preliminary results showed that DOT-p-DPPs could be used as the electron donor in organic solar cells. Further optimizations of the D:A nanomorphology are still needed to achieve high device performance.

Organic optical materials with a large TPA cross section have attracted increasing attention owing to their applications in two-photon bio-imaging and two-photon biosensing. Conjugated dendrimers are recognized as a special type of high performance TPA material for its intriguing chemical structures. In comparison with linear materials, conjugated dendrimers have larger TPA cross section values owing to a higher density of effective chromophores in an ordered and confined geometry, strong interchromophore interactions and efficient intramolecular charge transfer. Therefore, TPA behaviors of the synthesized DPP decorated thiophene dendrimers were then measured and tested.

TPA cross-sections of the various molecules as a function of excitation wavelength are shown in Fig. 7. For comparison, the TPA spectra of the reference molecules T-DPP-T and DPP-3T-DPP with linear structures (see the chemical structures in ESI, Fig. S13) are also shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7, all linear molecules (T-DPP-T and DPP-3T-DPP) have a small TPA cross-section value of less than 1000 GM. In comparison with the linear oligothiophenes, DPP-based dendritic oligothiophenes show significant enhancement in TPA cross-section values, which could be ascribed to the cooperative enhancement effect derived from the 3D special dendritic structures, with a high density of effective chromophores as well as stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions among the branched multichromophores. For example, 3T-p-DPP and DPP-3T-DPP are two configurational isomers with the same molecular weight. However, 3T-p-DPP with branched structures has substantially (215%) larger TPA cross-section values than the corresponding linear isomer DPP-3T-DPP, which is in accordance with the previous report.
The first generation dendron 3T-p-DPP has a TPA cross section peak value of 2499 GM at λ = 810 nm, and the corresponding first generation dendrimer 6T-p-DPP has a TPA cross section peak value of 6984 GM, which is 180% larger than the value for 3T-p-DPP. The increased TPA cross section peak value for 6T-p-DPP in comparison with 3T-p-DPP is attributed mainly to the extended conjugation length. Surprisingly, the TPA cross section peak values have not increased with increasing the generation of molecules with wavelength in the range of 780 nm to 880 nm. The second generation dendron 9T-p-DPP has a TPA cross section peak value of 3252 GM at λ = 810 nm, and the corresponding second generation dendrimer 18T-p-DPP has a TPA cross section peak value of 3672 GM. The phenomenon may be related to the increased steric hindrance, which decreased the orbital overlap of the α–α linkage around the thiophene chain. It should be noted that a large TPA is attributed to an extended π-conjugated system as well as an increased intramolecular charge transfer. However, the TPA cross section peak values have increased gradually with increasing the generation of DOT-p-DPPs in the wavelength range of 880 nm to 980 nm. 9T-p-DPP has a TPA cross section peak value of 1978 GM at λ = 930 nm, and 18T-p-DPP has a TPA cross section peak value of 2110 GM. The diketopyrrolopyrrole group may be mainly responsible for the TPA band in the longer wavelength range considering the relatively lower band gap of the unit. Thus a larger generation of DOT-p-DPPs would exhibit a larger TPA value with increasing the number of diketopyrrolopyrrole building blocks provided that their steric hindrance is relatively insignificant. These initial results clearly demonstrate that peripherally diketopyrrolopyrrole-functionalized dendritic oligothiophenes are a potentially suitable class of two-photon absorbing materials.

In summary, a new series of three dimensional conjugated thiophene dendrons and dendrimers with peripheral DPP units were synthesized by a step-by-step synthesis approach that involves Ir-catalyzed boronation and palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross coupling reaction. All these peripherally DPP-functionalized DOTs are highly soluble in common organic solvents, thus facilitating the full structure characterization, including NMR, MALDI-TOF MS and HR-MS. Both MS and GPC analyses showed the monodisperse nature of these molecules. Optical and electrochemical property investigation, as well as the theoretical simulation results, confirmed that the frontier molecular orbitals are mostly localized on the peripheral DPP units, which leads to similar optical band gaps and HOMO/LUMO energy levels for all these functionalized dendrimers. The application of these DPP-functionalized DOTs in organic photovoltaic devices showed a low performance with power conversion efficiencies around 1%. A high FF of more than 0.6 was measured for these DPP dendrimers, which is similar to that of DPP based polymers. Unfavorable nanophase separation and lower DOT-p-DPP concentration in the blended films were the main reason for the low JSC of these devices. In addition, these branched DPP dendrimers showed a very high two photon absorption cross section, and a clear dendritic effect can be seen from these results.
