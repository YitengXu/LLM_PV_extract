A low-temperature one-step solution process for the preparation of cesium lead iodide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was developed by adding hydrobromic acid (HBr) into the precursor solution. CsPbI2.69Br0.31 was confirmed as the best structure, with a bandgap of 1.75 eV. A 9.58% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved, which is the highest for PEDOT:PSS-based inorganic perovskite solar cells. The device efficiency decreased by 4% after being stored in N2 for 1200 hours.

In the last few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted great attention because of their excellent optoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficients, suitable direct bandgap, extra-long carrier diffusion length, and low defect density. The PCEs for the PSCs have risen from 3.8% in 2009 to 23.7% in 2018. Great achievements have been made by continuous improvements in the fabrication techniques and understanding of the crystallization processes. Even though the PCEs for PSCs are approaching those for silicon solar cells, their commercialization is still impeded by the compositional instability caused by the unstable organic parts.

Substituting the organic cations with inorganic cations to develop all-inorganic PSCs is an effective approach to realize high stability, and cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) could be the most promising candidates. Black-phase CsPbI3 with a suitable bandgap of 1.73 eV is a good candidate for solar cells. However, it presents phase instability upon moisture and exhibits an orthorhombic yellow phase at room temperature, and it has a too large bandgap of 2.82 eV. To obtain a cubic black phase, a high annealing temperature of 305 °C is required, which impedes the application of CsPbI3 in tandem and flexible solar cells. CsPbBr3 has good phase stability, but its bandgap (∼2.3 eV) is not suitable for photovoltaic applications. Partially substituting I with Br in CsPbI3 can stabilize the preferred cubic phase.
Various deposition techniques were applied to develop CsPbX3 films, and among them one-step solution processing is the most facile and low-cost method. The most reported solution-processed high-quality CsPbX3 films require a high annealing temperature above 250 °C, which costs energy and restricts the application of polymeric transport materials and flexible substrates. Some groups tried to develop simple low-temperature methods. Snaith et al. converted CsPbI3 from the yellow phase to the black phase at 100 °C by adding hydroiodic acid (HI) into the precursor solution and the solar cells with a structure of FTO/TiO2/CsPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au gave a PCE of 2.9%. By using the same additive, Kim et al. made solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI3/PC61BM/BCP/LiF/Al, which gave a PCE of 4.88%. Ho-Baillie et al. incorporated strontium (Sr) into CsPbI2Br and decreased the annealing temperature to 100 °C. Bian et al. demonstrated that the coordinated solvent DMSO can induce the formation of the photovoltaic cubic-phase of the all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites at room temperature, and the solar cells with a structure of PET/ITO/NiOx/CsPbI2Br/C60/BCP/Ag afforded a PCE of 6.9%. Chen et al. reported a low-temperature process (100 °C) via solvent engineering to get high-quality CsPbI2Br films.
In this work, we prepared black-phase cesium lead iodide perovskite films by using a low-temperature (60–140 °C) one-step solution process with HBr added into the precursor solution. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that the Br anions partially substituted the I anions, and the optimized I/Br ratio was 2.69:0.31. Solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI2.69Br0.31/PC61BM/Al were fabricated to study the photovoltaic performance. The best CsPbI2.69Br0.31 cells gave a PCE of 9.58% (100 °C), which is the highest among the reported CsPbX3 solar cells with a PEDOT:PSS HTL. The CsPbI2.69Br0.31 cells showed a better performance and stability than the cells made by adding HI.

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra for the CsPbI3 films made from different precursor solutions (with no additive, HBr and HI additive) on PEDOT:PSS substrates. The films were made by spin coating and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. They show absorption onsets at 440 nm, 708 nm and 718 nm, respectively, corresponding to bandgaps of 2.82 eV, 1.75 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively, which can also be derived from the Tauc plots (Fig. S1, ESI). The absorption of film B shows a little blue-shift compared with film C, indicating that the Br anions partially substituted the I anions, which was proved by the XPS spectra (Fig. S2, ESI). This phenomenon was also observed in the MAPbX3 and CsPbX3 perovskite films. Film A presents the orthorhombic yellow phase and films B and C present the desired cubic black phase, and their X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles are shown in Fig. 1b. Film A shows diffraction peaks at 13.06°, 21.78°, 22.72°, 26.52° and 31.46°, suggesting the non-perovskite yellow phase. Films B and C show the same diffraction peaks at 14.32°, 20.30° and 28.98°, which can be assigned to the (100), (110) and (200) planes, respectively, demonstrating the cubic perovskite phase.
Films B and C were exposed under ambient conditions with humidity of 65% and a temperature of 28 °C to study the phase stability. The films showed the black phase initially (Fig. 2a). After being exposed for 240 seconds, film C presented the yellow phase entirely while film B remained black mostly. Fig. 2b and c show the exposure time dependence of the absorption spectra for the perovskite films with the HBr and HI additive, respectively. The HBr additive improves the stability of the perovskite film. The CsPbI3 films with the HI additive can easily degrade to a nonphotoactive yellow phase. However, the HBr additive can add Br into the CsPbI3 films to increase the tolerance factor, thus enhancing the phase stability.
The perovskite films made from the low-temperature one-step solution process were used to fabricate the solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/Al (films annealed at 100 °C for 10 min). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the cells made with different additive concentrations are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI) and the device performance data are listed in Table S1 (ESI). The optimized HBr concentration was 35 μL mL−1, and the corresponding cells gave a PCE of 8.71%, surpassing the 2.40% PCE of the cells with the HI additive. The XPS spectra indicated that the composition for the best film was CsPbI2.69Br0.31. The optimized thickness for the perovskite film was 167 nm (Table S2, ESI). The device performance under different annealing temperatures was studied (Fig. S4, ESI). At 60 °C, the perovskite film showed a cubic black phase, and the cells gave a PCE of 6.18%. The optimal annealing temperature was 100 °C (Table S3, ESI).
The effect of annealing time on the device performance was investigated, and it is interesting that there are two peak PCEs (Table 1). The performance parameters were plotted against the annealing time (Fig. S5, ESI). The solar cells made of the perovskite films annealed for 15 min gave an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.05 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.41 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 73.0% and a PCE of 9.47%, while the cells annealed for 60 min gave a VOC of 1.03 V, a JSC of 13.98 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.4% and a PCE of 9.58%. Fig. S6 (ESI) shows the J–V curves for the devices with different annealing times. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curve for the best device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum is given in Fig. 3b, and the photoresponse edge is ∼720 nm. The integrated JSC was 13.70 mA cm−2, which was very close to the JSC value from the J–V measurement. The absorption spectra for the CsPbI2.69Br0.31 films with different annealing time are quite similar (Fig. S7, ESI), and the EQE spectra for the corresponding devices have the same photoresponse edge (Fig. S8, ESI), suggesting that the annealing time didn’t affect the absorption onset of the films.

Fig. S9 (ESI) shows the hysteresis for the J–V curves. Different scan speeds were applied in the J–V measurements, and there were no large differences (Fig. S10, ESI). Under continuous light illumination, the device gave a stable JSC of 11.42 mA cm−2 under 0.82 V bias and the stabilized PCE was calculated to be 9.22% (Fig. S11, ESI). The device performance was tracked inside an N2 glovebox for 1200 h (Fig. S12, ESI). The VOC increased a little from 1.03 V to 1.07 V, while the JSC decreased from 13.98 mA cm−2 to 12.98 mA cm−2. The FF kept well at 66% and the PCE showed only a 4% decrease from 9.58% to 9.19%, indicating the good stability of the solar cells.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were carried out to study the film morphology, which affects the device performance significantly. The SEM images of the CsPbI3 films with the HBr additive annealed at 100 °C for 20 s, 15 min and 60 min are shown in Fig. 4a–c, respectively. 20 sec were needed to complete the phase transition. The grain size increased with the annealing time (Fig. S13, ESI). The root-mean-square roughnesses for the films were 5.86 nm, 2.84 nm and 9.49 nm, respectively. The increase in the grain size could lead to a trade-off between JSC and FF. The devices annealed for 15 min showed the highest FF due to the smoothest surface with few pinholes. The solar cells made of the films annealed for 60 min gave higher JSC due to larger grain size, which improved the charge carrier mobility, but the FF decreased as the roughness and pinholes increased. Fig. 4d shows the SEM image of the CsPbI3 film with the HI additive annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The film shows larger grains with many pinholes as compared with the films with HBr, and the pinholes could deteriorate the charge transfer. The dense and pinhole-free films with adequate grain sizes may benefit the device performance and stability.

A low-temperature one-step solution processing was developed to make cesium lead iodide perovskite films. HBr was added into the precursor solution. The optimal perovskite film was determined to be CsPbI2.69Br0.31 with a bandgap of 1.75 eV. Solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI2.69Br0.31/PC61BM/Al. By annealing the perovskite films at 100 °C, the solar cells gave a PCE of 9.58%, which is the highest among the inorganic PSCs with PEDOT:PSS. The cells presented good stability with only 4% decrease in the PCE after being stored in an N2 glovebox for 1200 hours. This report provides an interesting approach to make efficient and stable inorganic PSCs via a low-temperature process, which could be useful for making flexible solar cells.
