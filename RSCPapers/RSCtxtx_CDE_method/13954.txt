The development of sustainable, cost-effective, and un-depleted energy resources is a demanding challenge. Harvesting an abundant source of energy, such as solar light, is one of the promising ways, to convert sunlight through a semiconductor directly into electricity. Varieties of solar cells based on silicon, thin-film, and emerging solar cells are being developed to address these challenges, and some of them have reached market maturity. Emerging solar cells also provide the possibility of manufacturing flexible devices with high efficiency, low material use, and subsequently low-module cost. Among them, perovskite solar cells have emerged as being efficient with potential for a commercial endeavor. Nonetheless, there is a window of opportunity that exists to improve the lifetime, photovoltaic (PV) performances and to further reduce the cost before its commercial viability. Employing polymers is one of the promising strategies to increase the reliability and upgrade the PV performances, such as improving fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and thus power conversion efficiency. Here, we present the recent progress in the use of polymeric materials as charge transporting (electron and hole-selective) layers, interfacial layers, and additives, to improve stability and photovoltaic properties.

Solar energy is an environmentally friendly, reliable, and unlimited source of energy that can be converted into electrical energy without any substantial harmful effect on the environment. Solar cells can be classified into three categories. The first-generation solar cells are based on crystalline silicon wafers (c-Si), also known as silicon wafer-based technology, and are efficient and reliable. They have reached high market maturity and penetration but are heavy, rigid, and have high technology manufacturing costs. It is paramount to replace silicon photovoltaics (PV) with flexible, lightweight, cost-effective, and easy-to-fabricate solar cells. The second-generation solar cells termed thin-film PV consist of two heterojunction layers between two contact layers. They are made from a multilayer thin film with a thickness of 2.5 μm (compared to 170–250 μm for c-Si) on a substrate made of metal, glass, or polymer. Such PV showed fewer processing steps, and simpler fabrication technology compared to the c-Si and include amorphous silicon (a-Si), copper indium selenide (CIS), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and cadmium telluride (CdTe). The third-generation solar cells enjoy the synergistic benefits of the earlier version and in the last decades have become a topic of significant interest to supply future energy demand. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QD-SSCs), and metal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the developed third-generation solar cells. PSCs are a relative recent discovery and have achieved significant attention in the PV technology during the past decade owing to their poly-crystalline structure, unique optoelectronic properties, low processing cost, and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which are on par with the well-developed c-Si solar cells. The term “perovskite” refers to a mineral known as calcium titanate (CaTiO3) and its crystallographic structure is denoted by the chemical formula ABX3. Similar to CaTiO3, three-dimensional metal-halide perovskites are also represented by the formula ABX3, where A and B are cations of different sizes, and the larger A cation occupies a cubo-octahedral site shared with twelve X anions. For PV applications, B cation is usually lead (Pb2+) cations, but it can be tin (Sn2+), germanium (Ge2+) or their mixed metal alloy, and X represents an halide anion (usually bromide, and iodide). A is typically an inorganic or organic cation, such as cesium (Cs+), methylammonium (CH3NH3+), ethyl ammonium (CH3CH2NH3+), or formamidinium (CH(NH2)2+). The crystal structure of perovskite is illustrated in Fig. 1. In case, when A was replaced by an organic cation, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite will be formed. The nature of A deeply influences the optoelectronic properties and stability of the perovskite layer. Organic–inorganic metal halide hybrid perovskites are exceptional candidates for PV applications with strong visible-light absorption and suitable optoelectronic properties.

The typical structure of PSC devices is composed of (i) a layer of the perovskite active layer as a light absorption layer, which generates free charge carriers upon photoexcitation, (ii) charge transporting materials (CTMs) including hole-transporting material (HTM) and electron transporting materials (ETM), and (iii) bottom (FTO or ITO) and top electrodes (Au, Ag, Al, or Cu).
The perovskite active layer is sandwiched between the HTM and ETM. ETM extracts and transports electrons from the active layer to the negative electrode and HTM extracts and transports holes to the positive electrode. Depending on the deposition of the ETM or HTM on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate, the PSCs can be divided into regular (conventional) and inverted structures. The configuration of the regular structure (n–i–p) is glass substrate/FTO/ETM/perovskite/HTM/metal, and the inverted (p–i–n) PSC is glass substrate/ITO/HTM/perovskite/ETM/metal. PSCs were developed from liquid DSSCs by Miyasaka's research team, in which CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 were the first reported perovskites as the light absorber. In their initial research (2006), CH3NH3PbBr3 was used as the sensitizer in liquid DSSC with an efficiency of 2.19%. Then, in 2009, to improve the efficiency, CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite was infilterated on mesoporous TiO2 scaffold as n-type semiconductors to sensitize perovskite for visible-light conversion in photovoltaic cells, and the efficiency was improved to 3.80% for a CH3NH3PbI3-based cell. PSCs can be classified into two main structures, mesoscopic and planar structures (Fig. 2). Both of them can have regular (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) structure. The mesoscopic structure was the most studied device structure in the early stages of the PSCs development. The fabrication of mesoporous layer needs high temperature sintering of n-type TiO2 for the conversion of rutile to anatase phase, while the fabrication of planar structures is relatively simple and does not require an high processing temperature. Inverted planar (p–i–n) PSCs have much potential for commercialization as compared with the mesoscopic owing to their multiple advantages, such as simple fabrication procedures, moderate processing temperature, less hysteresis effect, high-interface stability, and shorter process time.
When a perovskite absorbs a photon with energy higher than the perovskite bandgap, the perovskite layer is excited, and charge carriers (electrons and holes) are generated that are transported through the ETM and HTM. The separation of charge carriers inside the materials and interface formed conduction band electrons and valence band holes. Electrons and holes are injected into the conduction band of the ETM and valence band {i.e. highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)} of the inorganic (organic) HTM, and the collection of charge carriers at the respective electrodes takes place to complete the circuit (Fig. 3).
Since the pioneering work in 2009, sincere efforts have been made to enhance the PV performance of PSCs, and very recently, Chen et al. introduced monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with 23.60% (22.95% certified) efficiency. Although different research groups have focused on this issue, the PSCs still display poor stability as compared to silicon solar cells. Various strategies have been employed to tackle this problem, including designing new perovskites with high stability, introducing novel HTM or ETM, and interfacial engineering by modifying the absorber layer, HTM, or ETM. In the last few years inclusion of polymer into PSCs has emerged as a promising pathway to produce PSCs with a long-lifetime. The polymer strategy not only enhances device stability but also improves device performance since the polymer material has an extended π-conjugated system, which can harness sunlight more efficiently and can generate a circuit by charge transport. Also, there is a possibility of mixing polymers and creating a blend to absorb light in a wide spectrum. Moreover, polymers have shown high-quality film-forming properties together with the potential of preparing flexible solar cells, which can, in principle, offer production in high volumes at a low-process cost.
Conjugated polymers have excellent charge transfer properties with superior stability and are promising materials to be used as HTM. A PCE of 22.30% with remarkable device stability has been shown by utilizing a pyrene-based polymer termed PE10 as HTM. Moreover, perylene diimide (PDI), naphthalene diimide (NDI), and polyfluorene-based polymeric ETM have been introduced into PSCs. Fang et al. introduced a PDI-based polymer, PFPDI, as the ETM. The device fabricated with PFPDI exhibited Jsc of 23.43 mA cm−2 with an overall PCE of 15.01%, which was comparable to the PCBM-based device.
Polymers with various functional groups have been used as an additive in the perovskite to enhance the interaction between the grains in the perovskite layer, and also increase the perovskite thin-film quality, which leads to improved device stability and performance. Grätzel et al. used poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite film. The incorporation of the polymeric passivation layer between the perovskite layer and adjacent transport layers protects the active layer from moisture or environmental attack. Boo et al. reported a PCE of 15.10% by using polyaniline (PANI) as an interfacial layer between the perovskite layer and ETM. However, PANI is known to convert from one phase to another at room temperature.
In this communication, we reviewed the role of polymers as HTM, ETM, as an interfacial layer, and additives in the perovskite absorber, charge transporting layer to improve stability and photovoltaic properties.

HTMs play an essential role in PSCs, and they can extract and transport holes from the perovskite to the metal electrode. Moreover, they improve the stability of the devices and minimize the charge recombination and the energy barrier between the perovskite and electrode. Polymeric HTMs have attracted considerable attention owing to their mechanical flexibility, film-forming properties, thermal stability, and less corrosive effects on electrodes. The structure and summary of some polymeric HTMs are presented in Scheme 1 and Table 1, respectively.

Poly-[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), as a promising candidate was the first polymer studied as HTM in PSCs and achieved high efficiency. The nanocomposite of mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PTTA-based PSC obtained a maximum PCE of 12.00% even higher than that based on 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) (8.40%) under standard AM 1.5 conditions. Later, the device fabricated by formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) as a perovskite layer exhibited better performance than methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) because of its broad range light absorption with a smaller band gap, and a PCE > 20.00% was achieved. Moreover, a methoxy-functionalized triarylamine-based polymeric HTM (CH3O–PTAA) into PSCs with an n–i–p structure (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/blocking layer (bl)-TiO2/mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/CH3O–PTAA/Au) enhanced the doping ability, conductance, and stability, as compared to the common CH3–PTAA. PSCs based on doped CH3O–PTAA exhibited PCEs of up to 21.00% and excellent long-term thermal stability after the damp-heat test in the dark storage conditions (ISOS-D-3) of 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH) for over 1000 h. The methoxy group at the para (p-) position of the PTAA in CH3O–PTAA enhanced the stability and doping ability due to the resonance stabilization effect and favourable interaction of oxygen atom in the methoxy group with the Li+ ion. The radical delocalization of triarylamine through resonance improves the stability of the CH3O–PTAA radical cation, suppressing radical quenching. Higher doping ability and conductance of CH3O–PTAA are the results of the upshifted HOMO energy level, favourable interaction of the oxygen atom with Li+ and resonance stability of CH3O–PTAA compared with CH3–PTAA. In another report, methyl-functionalized PTAA was synthesized through the Suzuki polycondensation and used as HTM in dopant-free PSCs with an n–i–p configuration. The PV properties of the fabricated device (17.60%) PCE were enhanced as compared to those of the reference device based on commercial PTAA (PCE of 16.70%).
Although significant works with promising results have been demonstrated based on PTAA, PTAA is not a good choice in inverted structures in terms of its low refractive index. Texturing PTAA by simply mixing polystyrene (PS) with PTAA and then washing them away from the PTAA film is an efficient way to reduce reflection, achieving an efficiency improvement from 18.30% to 20.80%. By using an antireflection coating on glass more light can be transmitted into the device, and the efficiency was further improved to 21.60%, which is among the highest efficiencies of the inverted PSCs with low-temperature processing. Very recently, few-layered 2D-black phosphorus (BP) nanosheet-doped PTAA has been introduced as HTM for planar p–i–n type PSCs. The black phosphorus doping increases the conductivity and hydrophobicity of the PTAA, and this improves the charge extraction efficiency with a reduced energy barrier at the perovskite/black phosphorus: PTAA interface. A high-quality device, leading to a high PCE of 20.49% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.106 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.43 mA cm−2, and a FF of 82.60%, a superior to 18.26% of the control PSC with excellent stability, which was maintained over 80% of its initial efficiency after 800 h of storage under 45% relative humidity at room temperature was demonstrated. The certified PCE of single-junction planar inverted PSCs using PTAA as HTM and perovskite as an absorber achieved 22.30% (23.00% for lab-measured champion devices). The p–i–n planar heterojunction PSCs were structured as indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate/(PTAA)/perovskite/fullerene (C60)/bathocuproine (BCP)/copper. Adding a trace amount of surface-anchoring alkyl amine ligands (AALs) to the precursor solution suppresses non-radiative carrier recombination and improves the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite films with good operational stability (1000h at the maximum power point under simulated AM 1.5 illuminations, without the loss of efficiency).
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used polymeric HTM in PSCs because of its high optical transparency, easy fabrication process, good mechanical flexibility, as well as suitable energy levels. However, the initial results were not satisfactory and hydrophilicity limits the PCE along with the storage stability of PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs. The first inverted PSCs adopted PEDOT:PSS as HTM on the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Al configuration produced a PCE of 3.90% in 2013. Until now, the inverted PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS as HTM has achieved a PCE of 18%, by assembling PEDOT:PSS monolayers on the ITO surface through the water rinsing process.
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is thiophene (electron-rich monomer)-based polymer with attached –(CH2)5CH3 side chains, an alternative HTM, with excellent optoelectronic properties, relatively high hole mobility, good stability, and ease of synthesis, and is among one of the few feasible conjugated polymers for large-scale production to date. The use of P3HT as HTM in PSCs first started from PCE of 0.52% using the P3HT/CH3NH3PbBr3-coated alumina scaffold in 2013. Despite the potential advantages of P3HT, the resulting cells have a low Voc due to the recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface. Seo et al. introduced a double-layered halide (DLH) structure in which an ultrathin wide-bandgap halide was inserted between the perovskite absorber layer and P3HT to reduce interface recombination and improve PCE, and a PCE of 23.30% was achieved for the best-performing device. Moreover, the DLH-based PSCs yielded certified PCE of 22.70% with a low hysteresis of ±0.51% for small-area and 16.00% PCE for a large-area system, a promising candidate for commercial PSCs.
Without using any additional absorber layers or any interlayers at the perovskite/P3HT (PSK/P3HT) interface, a PCE of 19.25%, 16.29%, and 13.30% for a small area (0.1 cm2), large area (1.0 cm2), and perovskite solar module (43 cm2 active area) was achieved respectively by adding dopant and additive such as Li-TFSI, t-BP, and FK209 into P3HT and using triple-cation/double-halide hybrid perovskite ((FA1−x−yMAxCsy)Pb(I1−xBrx)3) absorber based mesoscopic PSCs. Jeong et al. indicated that incorporating gallium(III) acetylacetonate (Ga(acac)3) in P3HT could improve the moisture stability and PCE with an efficiency of over 24.00%. Furthermore, the introduction of the acceptor monomers into the P3HT chain achieved donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers to improve device performance. Introduction of benzothiadiazole (BTD) as an electron-poor moiety into P3HT creates a D–A system improved the hole mobility of HTM in flexible PSC.
Poly{2,7-[(5,5-bis(3′,7′-dimethyloctyl)-5H-1,8-dithia-as-indacenone)]-alt-5,5-[5′,6′-bis(octyloxy)-4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole]} (PDTIDTBT), a D–A type copolymer, with good hole mobility, great hole-transporting property, and excellent optical properties used in the fabrication of the mesoscopic PSCs as HTM with a PCE of 17.90%. Although this PCE was lower than spiro-OMeTAD, the deposition of a thin layer of PMMA at the perovskite/HTM interface was pushed to an impressive PCE of 19.89%, which is better than PMMA/spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC (19.28%). The PDTIDTBT-based PSC exhibited excellent operational stability with only 8% PCE loss after 200 h under continuous illumination.
In addition to PCE, device stability plays a key role in the commercialization of PSCs, and researchers have focused on this issue as well. Two D–A type polymers involving fused dithienopiceno carbazole (DTPC) with a planar conformation, the narrow bandgap of a DTPC unit, and strong electron-donating property were employed as the polymeric dopant-free HTMs by Gao et al. PDTPC as a suitable HTM delivered an impressive PCE of 16.96%, with high hole mobility of up to 4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The dopant-free PDTPC-based PSCs exhibited excellent stability, sustaining 96% of the initial efficiency without encapsulation for 1300 h of storage in ambient air.
The poly(1,4-(2,5-bis((2-butyloctyloxyphenylene)-2,7-(5,5,10,10-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-5,10-dihydro-s-indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′] dithiophene)))) (IDTB) copolymer, with high moisture stability (remaining 80% of initial PCE in 65% RH after 10 days), and low hysteresis (0.44%) was employed as HTM in a planar n–i–p based PSCs. The intramolecular S⋯O interactions (red dash line) between indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′] dithiophene (IDT) and 2,5-bis((2-butyloctyloxyphenylene)) (B) monomers resulted in a high planar ladder-like conjugated IDTB copolymer. The IDTB copolymer effectively passivated the defects in the perovskite layer and exhibited high hole mobility and hole-extracting abilities due to strong interactions of the O and S atoms in the backbone with Pb ions of the perovskite layer. As a result, the IDTB-based PSC showed Voc of 1.107 V, Jsc of 23.06 mA cm−2, FF of 75.90%, as well as, PCE of 19.38%, while the spiro-OMeTAD-based reference PSC exhibited Voc of 1.073 V, Jsc of 23.78 mA cm−2, FF of 71.40%, and PCE of 18.22%. The higher Voc and FF values of the polymeric-modified device are attributed to its deep HOMO level and its high hole mobility.
Pyridine-based polymer, called PPY2, with passivation function, can suppress the non-radiative recombination processes inside the perovskite and at its interface by the formation of high-quality polycrystalline perovskite films when used as the HTM in inverted PSCs. Upright optical transparency of PPY2 in the visible region makes it a worthy HTM, and dopant-free PPY2-based PSC can reach a remarkable PCE of up to 22.41% with a high Voc of 1.16 V, and excellent long-term photo-stability of over 97% of its initial PCE was retained after one sun constant illumination for 500 h.
To overcome the low conductivity of such polymers, the tactic of using a composite of activated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and a Lewis-base polymer as an additive was a highly effective method for the fabrication of small area (0.16 cm2), large-area (1.0 cm2), and flexible devices. Highly conductive CNTs can facilitate effective hole-extraction and charge transport from perovskite to the HTM, and polymers can act as the passivating materials. The PSCs based on the PMMA-CNTs exhibited an excellent PCE of 21.70%, 20.70%, and 18.30% for small-, and large-area PSCs, and flexible PSCs, respectively.

ETMs play an important role in receiving and transporting electrons. For competent charge transfer and hole blocking, the electron mobility of the ETM should be high and should have aligned energy levels with perovskite, and the negative electrode. In addition, ETM should be flat and smooth with high optical transmittance, good stability, and low-cost fabrication. Fullerene and its derivatives are the most commonly used ETMs in inverted structures; high electron mobility and fast electron injection from perovskites to fullerenes make them good candidates. These derivatives are sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and their structures are difficult to be modified, moreover, at high annealing temperatures, they can aggregate. Only a few examples of polymeric ETMs have been reported in the literature. The structure and summary of some polymers as ETM is presented in Scheme 1 and Table 1, respectively. NDI as an electron-deficient core has been widely used in designing polymeric ETMs. It seems poly{{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)}} (N2200 or PNDI2OD-TT), poly{{[[N,N′-bis(alkyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,2′-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene]}} (PNVT-8), and PNDI2OD-TT were the first polymeric ETMs in inverted planar PSC giving a competitive PCE of 8.15, 7.47, and 6.47%, respectively, which was shown to be competitive with a control device where PCBM was used as ETM and yielded a PCE of 8.51%.

Yip et al. developed an amino-functionalized copolymer that included fluorene, NDI, and thiophene spacers (called PFN-2TNDI) to replace [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), the most popular used ETM, in inverted planar PSCs. The backbone of polymeric ETM is composed of fluorine (with good hole-blocking properties) and NDI with two thiophene spacers (improved polymer packing and charge transfer property). A high PCE of 16.70% was achieved by PFN-2TNDI as the ETM while the control PSC showed a lower PCE of 12.90%. Moreover, an NDI-based polymer contains a copolymer of NDI and dicyano-terthiophene as a highly efficient ETM, namely P(NDI2DT-TTCN), not only enhanced photovoltaic performance with PCE of 17.00% with negligible hysteresis but also improved hydrophobicity, mechanical and light-induced stability compared with PCBM (Fig. 4).
Jiang et al. developed a conjugated polymer, poly(naphthodiperylenetetraimide-vinylene) (NDP-V), as an efficient ETM in inverted planar PSC with a maximum PCE of 16.54% and low hysteresis. Compared with PC61BM, a fullerene-based ETM, NDP-V demonstrated higher electron mobility, and more hydrophobicity, yielding higher performance and stability in PSCs.

Interface engineering impacts the performance and stability of PSCs, as these factors strongly depend on the interaction between the perovskite layer and adjacent HTM or ETM or between electrodes and HTM/ETM. It is proposed that making a water-resistant polymeric layer can protect the perovskite layer from corrosion by water or moisture. The structure and summary of some polymers as an interface are also presented in Scheme 2 and Table 2, respectively.

Poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine) (polyTPD) was employed in the perovskite/PEDOT:PSS with a PCE of 12% that was a respected PCE at that time. Meng et al. used low-cost and stable conjugated polymer poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10) as a hole extracting and cation-preserving interlayer in a regular planar PSC. The introduction of PTQ10 between PTTA as HTM and perovskite layer not only achieve high performance with a PCE of 21.20% but also showed thermal and ambient stability. PolyTPD is not only utilized as HTM but also introduced in PSCs as an interfacial passivator for the perovskite and grain boundaries by preventing the penetration of degradation agents into the inner layers. Modification of NiOx with PTAA, PMMA, and PS induces efficient charge transport between perovskite/HTM and reduced energy loss at the interface, as well as energy-level alignment with the perovskite materials. The NiOx-PTAA, NiOx-PMMA, and NiOx-PS-based PSC exhibited PCE of 21.56%, 21.08%, and 20.84%, respectively, with a Voc as high as ∼1.19 V listed as one of the highest Voc for NiOx-based inverted PSCs. Tavakoli et al. deposited a thin layer of PMMA, at the perovskite/HTM interface, and measured a PCE of 19.89%.


Different polymeric interlayers are employed between the perovskite and ETM to enhance PSC's performance. Teflon, polyvinylidene-trifluoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE), and PS have been successfully used as insulating tunneling layers between C60 as ETM and the active perovskite absorber film to prevent the perovskite layer from moisture damage. Relative to the control device, the performance of the PSCs increased significantly from a PCE of 16.90% for the control PSC (PCBM) to 20.30% by employing a 1.0% PS solution. Further, NDP-V, which was being used as ETM in inverted PSCs, can also be sandwiched between perovskite and C60 as interfacial layer. The introduction of the NDP-V interlayer showed a significant improvement with a PCE of 19.09%, surpassing the control PSC that measured 17.09% (C60-based ETM). According to the passivation effect of PS, Wu et al. fabricated dual-side passivated PSCs by introducing a PS layer between both the perovskite/SnO2 and perovskite/HTM interface. The PS buffer layer not only improves the efficiency of PSC with a PCE of 21.89% but also improves device stability by preventing moisture (Fig. 5).

Similarly, poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethyl-ammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]di-iodide (PFN-I) was introduced as a promising interface at both the perovskite/polyTPD and perovskite/PCBM to achieve long-term stability with a PCE up to 20.56%.

The contact resistance between electrodes and the organic CTMs has a significant effect on the electrical properties of the device, causing poor electron injection and extraction. The interface layer either can be inserted into perovskite/HTM, perovskite/ETM, or can be placed between charge transport materials/electrode interface to enhance the performance and stability of the device. Incorporation of poly(ethylenimine) ethoxylated (PEIE) or poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl) thiophene] (P3TMAHT) as a polyelectrolyte interlayer between PCBM and the Ag electrode in the inverted PSC promoted the performance of the device to reach the PCE of 12.01, and 11.28%, respectively, as compared with that of the control PSC without the interlayer (PCE of 8.53%).

The polymer interlayer reduced the electron injection resistance to PCBM from 7.96 Ω cm2 to 1.00 Ω cm2 (PEIE) and 0.99 Ω cm2 (P3TMAHT). PN4N, an amino-functionalized polymer as a cathode interlayer could reduce the contact resistance, block interfacial charge recombination, and enhance electron transport, resulting in an improvement of efficiency from PCE of 12.40% to 15.00%. In addition, to the modification of PSCs, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) has been also inserted between the Ag cathode and PCBM, leading to lower interfacial resistance, better electron transportation, as well an improvement of FF from 58.98% to 66.13%, and the PCE increases from 10.83% to 12.55%. Sun et al. introduced a high-performance device with a certified PCE of 21.44% and negligible hysteresis through the deposition of a double-layered ETM consisting of (PEIE)/SnO2 composite in contact with an ITO electrode. The ultrathin polyelectrolyte, PEIE interlayer was interfaced with ITO and the SnO2 layer was in contact with the perovskite layer, which could control the nucleation and reduce the energy mismatch between the PEIE/SnO2 composite used as ETM and perovskite.

Polymers as additives to the perovskite layer provide a tool to promote device efficiency, stability, and film quality of perovskite layers such as crystallinity, morphology, and coverage. At the initial step, poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOXA) was inserted into the CH3NH3PbI3 to control the crystallization process and structure of the perovskite layer. A PCE up to 6.35% was achieved by adding a small percentage (1.5 wt%) of PEOXA into the perovskite layer. Since then, several attempts have been made to improve the performance of the device by adding polymers into the active layer. Tuning the morphology of the perovskite with polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an additive resulted in lower voids between perovskite domains and better coverage of the perovskite film on the TiO2 layer. By using 1 wt% of PEG, more than 25% improvement was obtained from a PCE of 10.58% to 13.20%. PMMA as an efficient template to control nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite layer resulted in PCE of up to 21.60% (Fig. 6). Zhao et al. utilized polymerization-assisted grain growth (PAGG) strategy to obtain high stability and high-performance device with a PCE of 23.00%. The incorporation of dimethyl itaconate (DI) as a sufficient monomer into the PbI2 solution formed the perovskite layer, where, the polymers adhered at the perovskite grain boundaries making an effective passivation, resulting in the low defect density. The structure and summary of some polymeric additives are presented in Scheme 3 and Table 3, respectively.

Habisreutinger et al. incorporated a P3HT-SWNT layer (where SWNT is single-walled carbon nanotube) with insulating polymer PMMA, and the influence of mixed HTM on the device performance was investigated. Employing polymer-assisted SWNTs as the HTM improved the power efficiency of PSCs up to 15.30% with a protective effect between the perovskite film and the metal cathode that enhanced stability to thermal stressing and moisture ingress. PTAA doping into the 4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)benzenamine] (TAPC) layer, formed a mixed HTM with a smooth surface and the energy-level alignment with perovskite leading to improve the charge transfer and reduce charge recombination. With this strategy highly performing PSC was developed with an average PCE of 19.03% ± 0.53%, and the highest PCE of 21.01%. Addition of PEDOT:PSS as a dopant into metal–phthalocyanine–tetrasulfonated acid tetrasodium salt (TS-MPc) as the main HTM improved the cell efficiency of the p–i–n inverted PSCs. The first report of the nanomesh structure formation in a TS-MPc:PEDOT: PSS blended system exhibited a higher PCE of 14.65%, Voc of 0.950 V, Jsc of 19.861 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.64%, compared with that of both pure TS-CuPc (PCE of 7.99%) and PEDOT: PSS (PCE of 11.02%). The stability of the PSCs improved with PEDOT:PSS-assisted TS-MPc as HTM.


As the first reported polymeric additive blended into ETM, Bai et al. incorporated a high molecular weight PS into PCBM to promote the ETM film quality (highly smooth and uniform ETM) resulting in a significant improvement in PCE from 9.50% to 10.68% at 1.5 wt% PS doped PSC. To fabricate a cost-effective and simple device PEG was incorporated into colloidal-quantum-dot ink (SnO2) as an ETM. Dissolving PEG into SnO2-ink allows to deposit a dense and uniform SnO2-in-polymer matrix layer with thickness below 20 nm measuring a PCE of 20.80% with a Voc of 1.12 V and a FF of 81.90%.


The perovskites are very sensitive to moisture and degrade in the ambient environment. Poor stability of PSCs under moisture conditions is an obstacle to their practical applications. Device degradation not only takes place through moisture but also through heat and UV irradiation. Different efforts have been made to improve the stability of PSCs. As alternative approaches, adding polymer additives and interface engineering are promising routes to improve device stability. The structure and summary of some polymers to improve stability are also presented in Scheme 4 and Table 4, respectively. For example, hygroscopic PEG can stabilize the perovskite layer making PEG-scaffold PSC with strong humidity resistance. The modified device exhibited high output even at 70% RH for over 300 h. The introduction of polyethylene oxide (PEO) into the active layer could improve the humidity tolerance in a moisture processing environment (55 ± 5% RH). The fabricated device in high humidity (55 ± 5% RH) exhibited a PCE of 11.70% compared to that fabricated in a dry environment (30 ± 5% RH), while the devices without PEO, fabricated in high moisture and dry moisture showed a significant difference in performance. Moreover, the fabrication of dopant-free HTM by a random copolymer (RCP) based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) as HTM, resulted in a radically stable device even at 75% RH for over 1400 h with PCE of 17.30% (Fig. 7).

Dai et al. demonstrated doping of P3HT into PCBM (ETM) as an additive that can improve the aggregation of PCBM and modify the surface morphology of the ETM, leading to improvement in the stability of ETM. The introduction of P3HT protects the perovskite layer from water diffusion, leading to humidity resistance. As a result, the device based on the P3HT/PCBM (1:30) exhibited an impressive PCE of 20.84% with a Jsc of 23.27 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.10 V, and a FF of 81.47%. The PCE of the device retained 85.03% for 720 h (20% RH), 77.90% for 48 h (60% RH), 44.31% for 1 h (90% RH), and 17.43% for 30 min (in water) of its initial PCE value. Moreover, by the introduction of P3HT, the Jsc exhibited almost no degradation at the first 360 h exposure and retained 91.41% of its initial value after 720 h, while the Jsc of the control device decayed after 120 h and retained 86.94% of the initial value after 720 h.
The introduction of the electron-poor moieties into P3HT not only improved the charge transport properties due to more efficient intramolecular interactions but also led to more stability. Employing modified P3HT by benzothiadiazole (BTD-modified P3HT) as HTM in flexible PSC could improve the hole mobility of the HTM due to a donor–acceptor behavior. De Rossi et al. demonstrated improved device stability with BTD-P3HT copolymers, as compared to commercial P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the fabricated device using polymeric BTD/P3HT exhibited a performance comparable to the commercial P3HT.
The addition of PANI with unique optical and electrical properties into the perovskite film not only improved stabilities against heat (retained 86% of absorption intensity after 200 h of heat aging) and moisture (larger water contact angle, 71.7°, than the pristine device, 62.1°) but also improved light absorption, charge transfer, morphology and crystalline structure of the film. Subsequently, the performance of the modified device improved and gave a PCE of 19.09%. Porphyrin derivatives with superior thermal stability are largely used in photovoltaic devices. With the introduction of polymeric zinc porphyrin (ZnP)n, stabilities against heating (retained 77% of intensity after 900h at 85 °C) and lighting (retained 86% of intensity after 630 h under the white LED) improved, and the PCE of the device also increased to 20.53%. Moreover, through the polymerization-assisted grain growth (PAGG) method, dimethyl itaconate (DI) was polymerized, chemically gathered at the perovskite grain boundaries, the main channels for moisture penetration into the perovskite layer, and effectively reduced the defects accumulated at the grain boundary area. PAGG-treated solar cells resulted in superior stability and performance (PCE of 23.00%), where 85.7% and 91.8% of the initial PCE were retained after 504 h of continuous illumination and 2208 h of shelf storage in ambient conditions. Employing hydrophobic and cross-linkable ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate (E2CA) into the active layer not only increases heat resistance (retained over 90% of the post-burn-in efficiency after 200 h) and humidity resistance (retained about 90% of the efficiency after aging over 1000 h in 40–60% RH) but also decreased the polymerization temperature without damaging the active layer (Fig. 8).

Interfacial engineering can improve Voc by improving charge transport, trap density reduction, and preventing non-radiative recombination. The modification of PSCs by polymers is a significant approach to improve Voc and device performance. The structure and summary of some polymers to improve Voc are presented in Scheme 4 and Table 4, respectively. Lian et al. showed the modification of NiOx by PTAA in inverted PSCs could improve the device PCE to 21.56% with a Voc of 1.19 V. Placement of a thin PMMA/PCBM blend film into the active layer/TiO2 interface suppressed interfacial recombination resulting in an increase in Voc by as much as 80 mV. The efficient passivated device exhibited a significant Voc of 1.18 V with a steady-state PCE of 20.40% as well as negligible hysteresis. Interface passivation by the introduction of PMMA at both the active layer/HTM and ETM/active layer interfaces successfully reduced interface recombination. As a result, a remarkable Voc of 1.22 V with a high efficiency of 20.80% was achieved. Moreover, the band alignment of the perovskite with HTM is essential for increasing Voc. The incorporation of fluorine atoms as an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) into PTAA resulted in a deeper HOMO energy level. The alignment of the energy level of fluorinated PTAA (F-PTAA) with the perovskite film improved the performance of the device with a Voc of 1.14 V and PCE of 21.10%.


FF is a measure of the quality of solar cells and it is a ratio of the maximum power of the device to the product of Voc and Jsc. The ideal FF should be 100%, but experimentally, it is not possible. Several research works has been reported on PSCs using polymers to improve FF. The structure and summary of some polymers to improve FF is also presented in Scheme 4 and Table 4, respectively. For example, PTAA as an HTM can improve the FF of PSCs. Wang et al. by using an ultrathin PTAA sandwiched between the active layer and PEDOT: PSS, effectively passivated the interfacial and grain boundary defects and suppressed interfacial recombination. As a result, they obtained a PCE of 19.04% with a striking FF of 82.59% and a Jsc of 21.38 mA cm−2. Moreover, using Zn-doped PEDOT: PSS as the HTM improved the photovoltaic performance, where the FF increased from 70.00% to 83.00%. Introduction of low-cost and stable conjugated polymer such as poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluroro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)-quinoxaline)] (PTQ10) as an interfacial layer in planar n–i–p PSC not only improved the active layer quality and suppressed the volatilization of organic cations during the thermal annealing process but also functioned as a hole selective layer. As a result, a champion PCE of 21.20% with a high FF of 81.60% as well as thermal and ambient stability was achieved. Also, poly aspartic acid sodium (PASP), an interlayer between the HTM and active layer, passivated surface traps in perovskites and control the crystallization, resulting in high device performance with a superior PCE of 20.05% as well as a high FF of 82.20%. Introduction of the conjugated n-type polymer, poly[(9,9-dioctyluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-2′,2′′-diyl] (F8TBT), into PCBM as ETM could control the active layer formation, enhanced electron mobility, and reduced recombination at the perovskite/PCBM interface. As a result, device performance with PCE of 20.60% and FF of 82.00% as well as high stability (remaining 80% of efficiency after 45 days under ambient air condition) was achieved.


The functionalized PTAA (CH3O–PTAA, CH3–PTAA, and F–PTAA) were synthesized through the modified Ni-catalyzed Yamamoto polycondensation reaction by the desired monomers from Buchwald-Hartwig amination, as outlined in Scheme 5. The obtained polymers were purified by filtration through a short bed of silica gel, followed by Soxhlet extraction, collected by precipitation into methanol, filtered, and dried under vacuum. The Suzuki polycondensation is another route for the preparation of functionalized PTAA (Scheme 5). Based on the results, the obtained polymeric HTM improved the photovoltaic properties of the cell compared with commercial PTAA, suggesting that the synthetic method is a very important consideration for obtaining a high-performance device.

PDTPC with the donor and acceptor units, namely dithienopiceno carbazole (DTPC) and fluorinated benzothiadiazole (F-BT), was obtained via Suzuki coupling polymerization, as outlined in Scheme 6. Moreover, the amino-functionalized polymers PFN-2TNDI and PN4N were synthesized by Suzuki copolymerization from the desired boronic ester and aryl halide (Scheme 6). On the other hand, the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction was applied for the preparation of PPY2 in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a copper(I) cocatalyst, and an amine base, as described in Scheme 6.
The reaction of 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), MgBr, and then 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane nickel(II) chloride (Ni(dppp)Cl2) can result in highly regioregular P3HT through the Grignard type polycondensation reaction (Scheme 7). De Rossi et al. synthesized different BTD/P3HT copolymers by Stille coupling and Kumada polycondensation reactions. Through the Stille coupling reaction, the BTD/3-hexylthiophene (HT) ratio could be controlled, whereas by the Kumada reaction a polymer with relatively high molecular weight was achieved. Due to the low molecular weight (Mw) of the former (by Stille coupling) low FF and low PCE were achieved, while the other one (by Kumada reaction) demonstrated improved stability and PCE. The polymerization of the corresponding monomers through the Kumada reaction is illustrated in Scheme 7.
PDTIDTBT as HTM for PSC was synthesized from Stille cross-coupling polycondensation from two monomers, namely 2,7-dibromo-(5,5-bis(3′,5′-dimethyloctyl)-5H-1,8-dithia-as-indacenone) (M1) and 5,5-bi(tributylstannyl)-(5′,6′-dioctyloxy-4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (M2), as outlined in Scheme 8. The growth of the polymer chain ended with the addition of 2-bromobenzene and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene at the appropriate time. Similarly, highly planar π-conjugated copolymer IDTB and RCP were obtained from their corresponding monomers by Stille coupling polymerization (Scheme 8).
Stille cross-coupling conditions have also been employed for the synthesis of such polymeric ETMs including NDP-V, PNVT-8, N2200, PNDI2OD-TT, and P(NDI2DT-TTCN), as described in Scheme 9. Polymeric DI is the result of radical polymerization in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. By the introduction of the monomeric DI into the PbI2 solution and initiating the polymerization process, CC bonds of monomers are cleaved and then subsequently relinked with adjacent monomers to form polymeric DI.


1H-NMR and 13C-NMR analyses were used to elucidate the structure of the polymers. 1H-NMR spectra (400 MHz) of CH3O–PTAA in o-dichlobezene-d4 displayed aromatic protons as one singlet at 6.89 ppm (2H) and two doublets at 7.50–7.48 (4H) and 7.09 ppm (4H) with the coupling constants of 8.5 and 8.4 Hz, respectively. The singlets at 3.68 (3H) and 2.10 (6H) ppm were attributed to methoxy and methyl groups, respectively. The aromatic protons of CH3–PTAA appeared at 7.47–7.45 (4H) and 7.09–7.07 (4H) ppm as doublets with the coupling constants (J) of 8.5 and 8.7 Hz, respectively, as well as a singlet at 6.86 ppm (2H). The protons belonging to the methyl groups appeared at 2.25 (3H) and 2.06 ppm (6H) as singlets. The 1H-NMR spectra of F-PTAA displayed aromatic protons at 7.42–7.40 ppm as a doublet (4H, J = 9.0 Hz) and at 7.15–7.13 (1H) and 7.02–6.90 ppm (6 H) as a multiplet, while the methyl group appeared as a singlet at 2.07 ppm. The 1H-NMR spectra of BTD/P3HT displayed the thiophene proton in the 4-position on the ring at 6.98 ppm. Since the chemical shift of the α-methylene group is affected by the chemical environment and regio-regularity, the narrow peak belonging to the α-methylene group at 2.8 ppm suggests the high regioregularity of the copolymer and is estimated to be about 100%. PDTIDTBT is synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polycondensation and characterized by the 1H-NMR technique (400 MHz) in deuterated chloroform. The aromatic protons appeared as broad signals at 7.8–7.5 (1H), 7.4–7.3 (4H), and 7.2–7.0 ppm (1H), and the aliphatic ones at 4.4–4.1 and 2.3–0.6 ppm. To note here, we believe this compound has 76 aliphatic protons; however, the report suggests 60 aliphatic protons. Synthesis of the IDTB copolymer was also monitored by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (600 MHz, CDCl3). The signals at 7.51 (s, 2H), 7.41 (s, 2H), 7.19–7.05 (18H) were attributed to aromatic protons and the other ones at 4.03–3.76 (m, 4H), 2.68–2.39 (m, 8H), 1.81 (s, 2H), 1.66–1.41(m, 8H), 1.39–1.12 (m, 56H), 0.97–0.71 (m, 24H) were assigned to aliphatic chain protons. The aromatic protons of PPY2 appeared at 8.47–8.09 (m), 7.69–7.65 (m), and 7.12–6.89 ppm (m), while CH3 protons appeared at 2.17 ppm as a broad signal. Moreover, 13C-NMR confirmed the synthesis of brown solid PPY2. The aromatic carbons are observed between 147.43–119.58 ppm and the signal at 20.82 ppm is assigned to the methyl moiety. The 1H-NMR studies suggest that PPY2 displays coordination ability to Pb2+ due to its outward orientation, which causes the passivation ability. Moreover, the synthesis of PFN-2TNDI, RCP, N2200, PNVT-8, and P(NDI2DT-TTCN) was established by this technique.


FTIR spectroscopy is a widespread technique that can play a role as the fingerprint of materials. It is one of the most applicable methods used to detect functional groups and structures of compounds. FTIR data was obtained in DI and DI-PbI2 films before and after the annealing process to verify the polymerization of DI. The pure DI exhibited the characteristic bands of CO (stretching mode, 1737 cm−1), CC (stretching mode, 1636 cm−1), and CH2 (bending mode, 898 cm−1) groups, which were retained in the PbI2 film with DI. After the thermal treatment of the DI-PbI2 film, the bands related to CC and CH2 moieties disappeared, indicating complete polymerization (Fig. 9).


The molecular weight and its distribution are determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) techniques. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of CH3O–PTAA, CH3–PTAA, and F-PTAA measured by the SEC technique were 14.0, 14.1, and 25.0 kg mol−1 (kDa) with polydispersity values of 1.63, 1.54, and 1.90, respectively. Further, the GPC technique was also used for the CH3-functionalized PTAA by the Suzuki polycondensation reaction, and Mw of 20.8 kDa, as well as a narrow molecular weight distribution (1.4), was obtained, as compared to the commercial PTAA. GPC analysis exhibited a relatively high molecular weight equal to 45 kDa with a poly dispersity of 1.25 for the BTD/P3HT copolymer. The Mw of PDTIDTBT and IDTB estimated using the GPC technique were 135.5 and 35.9 kDa, respectively, and the measured Mn values were 67.3 and 18.3 kDa with polydispersities of 2.0 and 1.9, respectively. The PDTPC and PPY2 exhibited Mn values of 11.4 and 7.7 kDa with polydispersities of 1.69 and 1.90, respectively, by GPC.


The thermal stability of polymers is evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA of PTAA derivatives by Kim et al. confirmed their high thermal properties with decomposition temperatures (Td) of 475, 502, and 522 °C for CH3O–PTAA, CH3–PTAA, and F-PTAA, respectively. The results indicated that the fluorination into the polymer backbone improved the thermal stability. BTD-P3HT copolymers synthesized through the Kumada polycondensation reaction exhibited Td of 479 °C, while Td of commercially P3HT (94 kDa) was 485 °C. It seems BTD moieties could reduce the thermal stability of the polymer. PDTIDTBT and IDTB copolymers were also stable below 300 °C. The thermal analysis of PDTIDTBT and IDTB under N2 atmosphere exhibited high Td of 324 and 376 °C, respectively. TGA and DSC methods were performed to investigate the thermal stability of the PDTPC and PPY2 copolymers and suggested thermal stability of the copolymers with 5% weight loss at 381 and 459 °C, respectively.


The optical and electrochemical properties of polymers were measured by different techniques such as UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), photoelectron spectroscopy in the air (PESA), and photoluminescence (PL) analysis.

The light absorption properties of polymers are influenced by conjugation length, regioregularity, planarity, and molecular weight. The maximum absorption (λabs) of the BTD/P3HT copolymer was found to be at 453 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra displayed λabs peak of CH3O–PTAA at 381 nm, whereas λabs of CH3–PTAA appeared at 377 nm with a red-shift of about 4 nm. The λabs of F-PTAA with EWG slightly decreases and shifted to the shorter wavelength (372 nm). The λabs for PDTPC in chlorobenzene appeared at 657 nm; however, two extra signals appeared in the solution form, one at 539 nm due to localized π–π* transition and the other at 657 nm related to intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor units. The λabs of PDTPC in the thin-film appeared at 696 nm with a shoulder peak. The red shifting of 39 nm can be ascribed to the enhanced order of inter-and intramolecular stacking in the solid state. The optical absorption spectra of the PFN-2TNDI film exhibited two unique signals at 383 and 612 nm resulting from π–π* transition and strong intramolecular charge transfer properties of this copolymer, respectively. The charge transfer properties of the polymers were investigated by the photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The PL emission (λem) peak of CH3O–PTAA (424 nm) red-shifted compared with that of CH3–PTAA (419 nm). From UV and PL data, Tavakoli et al. calculated an optical bandgap of about 1.82 eV for the PDTIDTBT copolymer. The PL lifetime of deposited perovskite with NDP-V (11.08 ns) confirmed that the electron extraction from the perovskite to NDP-V ETM is even more effective than that from PC61BM.
The charge mobility was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility could be improved by the inter-and intramolecular interactions and an increase in polymer backbone planarity, as an example, upon fluorination of the polymeric backbone. By the SCLC approach, the hole mobilities of CH3O–PTAA, CH3–PTAA, and F-PTAA films were calculated to be 5.59 × 10−5, 4.38 × 10−5, and 2.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. The hole mobility of PDTIDTBT was calculated to be 5.24 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1, as determined using the SCLC method, even higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (8.1 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1) suggesting its suitability as a dopant-free HTM. The high-planar ladder-like conjugated backbone of IDTB, as well as S⋯O intramolecular interactions resulted in high hole mobility and passivation effect for perovskite. The high hole mobility of undoped IDTB (2.89 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1) was slightly lower than that of the doped spiro-OMeTAD (5.97 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1). The charge-transporting capability in the PDTPC film was calculated by the SCLC measurement. The PDTPC film exhibited hole mobility of as high as 3.98 × 10−3 cm2 V s−1, even higher than that of non-dopant spiro-OMeTAD (4.71 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1), which is the result of the high planarity, excellent electron-donating capacity, and narrow band gap of the DTPC unit of the polymer. The hole mobility ∼1.90 × 10−3 cm2 V s−1 for PPY2 resulted in strong inter-chain interactions. For the RCP copolymer, the hole mobility (3.09 × 10−3 cm2 V s−1) was even higher than that of P-OR (1.85 × 10−3 cm2 V s−1) and P-R (0.65 × 10−3 cm2 V s−1) due to a more strongly directed face-on orientation. The electron mobility of NDP-V as an ETM determined by SCLC was 2.5 × 10−3 cm2 V s−1, comparable to that of PC61BM, so it is potentially an excellent ETM to replace costly and unstable PC61BM. Although the electron mobility of PFN-2TNDI (4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1) was slightly lower than that of PCBM, it is a competitive polymeric ETM in terms of charge transport characteristics.
The investigation of HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels is a method to estimate the suitability of polymers as HTM or ETM in PSCs. To find the effect of the substituent on the energy level and the electronic properties of the polymeric materials, photoelectron spectroscopy in the air (PESA) was measured. The mesomeric electron-donating ability of CH3O at the p-position of CH3O–PTAA resulted in a slightly higher HOMO energy level (−5.17 eV) than that of CH3–PTAA (−5.20 eV), leading to a higher doping ability and conductivity. The introduction of a fluorine atom at the para position instead of a methyl group at F-PTAA lowered the HOMO energy level of the polymer to −5.52 eV due to the dominant inductive effect of the fluorine atom. The energy level of the HOMO and LUMO could be influenced by the BTD/HT ratio in the BTD/P3HT copolymer. Through the voltammetry technique, the energy level of HOMO was detected in BTD/P3HT and it was found that the presence of BTD moieties shifted the HOMO level from −5.00 eV in commercial P3HT to −5.14 eV in BTD/P3HT. For PDTIDTBT, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.35 and −3.29 eV (with a band gap of 2.06 eV) were obtained from CV measurements, respectively. The HOMO energy level of IDTB was estimated to be −5.20 eV with an optical bandgap of 2.19 eV by photoelectron spectroscopy. This energy level is even lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.12 eV), which allows for achieving a higher Voc value of the device. In a D–A copolymer such as PDTPC, the donor units increased the HOMO energy level due to extended conjugation length and the acceptor units decreased the HOMO level. The HOMO level of −5.11 eV with an optical bandgap of 1.60 eV for PDTPC was measured by CV. Accordingly, the PPY2 has an aligned HOMO energy level (−5.17 eV from CV and UPS) with a perovskite layer. CV was used to determine the electrochemical characteristics of PFN-2TNDI. The study of frontier molecular orbitals demonstrated that the LUMO (−3.84 eV) and HOMO (−5.57 eV) levels of this copolymer were slightly lower than the conduction band and the valence band of perovskite film, respectively. The suitable hole blocking property makes it a promising candidate for ETM. RCP copolymer, including P–OR and P–R showed a HOMO energy level of −5.51 eV, slightly deeper than that of the perovskite layer (CH3NH3PbI3; −5.43 eV). PNVT-8, N2200, PNDI2OD-TT showed the LUMO level of ∼−3.90 eV and HOMO levels from −5.61 to 5.82 eV, which were compatible with the energy levels of the perovskite and also similar to the LUMO/HOMO levels of PCBM, making them as valuable ETM candidate (Fig. 10). It seems that the presence of vinyl linkages in PNVT-8 caused a higher energy level of HOMO, as compared with N2200 and PNDI2OD-TT, while having a negligible effect on their LUMO energy levels. One of the deeper LUMO levels among NDI-based polymers belongs to P(NDI2DT-TTCN) with a LUMO level of −4.14 eV, which suggests its suitability as an electron-transport layer.

The use of a rational polymer is one of the decisive means to improving the reliability, such as stability and performance, of perovskite solar cells. We scrutinized and summarized the recent progress in the use of polymers for improving the stability and carrier transport when employed as hole transporting material (HTM), electron transporting material (ETM), interfacial layer, and as an additive into the perovskite, HTM, and ETM. We quantified the use of effective and facile polymers along with their synthetic methods for perovskite solar cells and detailed their merits and shortcomings. An array of detailed characterization techniques of polymers using NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, molecular weight analyses, thermal stability, and optical and electrochemical properties are probed to unravel the underlying hypothesis of its use. Polymers have an enormous potential to contribute to the success of perovskite solar cell and a window of opportunity exists to improve lifetime, photovoltaic performances, and cost reduction through their use.
