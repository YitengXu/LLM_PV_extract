Fluorene-cored dendrimers containing a triphenylamine chalcone unit at the periphery have been synthesized by divergent methodology using a click chemistry approach, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties have been investigated. All of the dendrimers exhibited quasireversible oxidation reduction signals in cyclic voltammetry. All of the dendrimers were used as additives in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and the higher generation dendrimers exhibited better power conversion efficiency than the lower generation dendrimers in solar energy harvesting systems.

Emitting organic compounds possessing extended π-conjugated systems have garnered great interest in recent years owing to their variety of applications in OLEDs, solid state lasers, sensors, fluorescence imaging and nonlinear optical materials, and in photophysical and charge transport devices. Energy demands are increasing worldwide but fossil fuel reserves are depleting rapidly, and hence there is increasing pressure to use renewable energy sources for sustainable progress and development. Along these lines, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received significant attention due to their low cost of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values. With the aim of increasing and improving renewable energy sources, recently a large number of functional π-conjugated polymers, oligomers and dendrimers have been synthesized and used in DSSCs and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). DSSCs fabricated using ruthenium complexes, first reported by Grätzel and coworkers in 1991, had 11% power conversion efficiency. Recently, the highest recorded conversion efficiency (η) of 13.0% was achieved with Zn–porphyrin complex-based DSSCs. Dendrimers are highly branched macromolecules, combining the merits of a well-defined structure with superior chemical purity and excellent emissive properties that depend on the dendrimer generation. Dendrimers have attracted great attention in the past few decades due to their variety of applications, including optical data storage, solar cells and medical applications.

The triphenylamine (TPA) moiety possesses a three-dimensional propeller structure, and its derivatives play an important role in DSSCs due to their electron donating properties when linked to a sensitized dye with hole transporting abilities. Extension of the dye linker stabilizes the charge separation conditions but delays electron donation. In photoelectric research, TPA has been reported as a good p-doping unit and has been used as a hole-injection moiety. Triphenylamine and its derivatives have interesting properties for the development of photovoltaic devices as donor moieties, and hence they can be used as good antennae for charge transfer and/or energy transfer to the emitting center. TPA-based star-shaped oligomeric and polymeric materials are used as important organic semiconductors and as hole transporting materials in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, organic field effect transistors and in photorefractive holography.
Fluorene is a major component of fossil fuels, and 9,9-dialkyl-substituted fluorene derivatives often exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields and good solubility in organic solvents, with excellent thermo- and photostability. Therefore, fluorenyl-functionalized materials have been extensively explored as active components for electronic devices, such as light emitting diodes, charge transfer agents, field effect transistors and sensors.
Click chemistry is the most promising cycloaddition reaction, in which copper(I) is used as a catalyst for the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a terminal alkyne to an azide, developed by Sharpless and Meldal. The click reaction is characterized by its very high yields, mild and simple reaction conditions and easy product isolation, with excellent chemoselectivity affording reliable 1,4-regiospecific 1,2,3-triazoles, even in the presence of a large variety of other functional groups, which is a breakthrough in the synthesis of dendrimers and polymeric materials.
Recently, we have used dendrimers with pyrene, dimethyl isophthalate and benzothiazole surface groups as additives to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in DSSCs. We report herein the synthesis of triphenylamine chalcone-based triazole dendrimers 1–6 (Fig. 1) and their photophysical properties, and also their application to increase the efficiency of DSSCs when they are used as additives.

The synthesis of propargyloxy triphenylamine chalcone dendrons 10 and 11 was achieved by the controlled Vilsmeier-Haack formylation of triphenyl amine to give 4-formyl triphenylamine 7, which was brominated using NBS in DMF at RT to give 4-(bis(4-bromophenyl)amino)benzaldehyde 8 in a good yield. The Claisen–Schmidt condensation of triphenylamine aldehydes 7 and 8 with 1.0 equiv. of 4-(propargyloxy)acetophenone 9 using ethanol as the solvent and 10% sodium hydroxide as the base gave the corresponding propargyloxy triphenylamine chalcones, 10 and 11, in 83% and 84% yields, respectively (Scheme 1).

In the 1H NMR spectrum, the alkyne dendron 10 displayed a triplet at δ 2.56 (J = 2.1 Hz) and a doublet at δ 4.76 (J = 1.8 Hz) for the acetylenic and propargyloxy protons, and the trans olefinic protons appeared at δ 7.40 (J = 15.6 Hz) and δ 7.76 (J = 15.6 Hz), respectively, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 10 showed the propargyl and carbonyl carbons at δ 55.9, 76.2, 77.9 and 188.8, respectively, in addition to the signals for the other aromatic carbons. In the mass spectrum (ESI) of the alkyne dendron 10, a peak appeared at m/z 430 (M + H)+, corresponding to the molecular ion. The structure of the alkyne dendron 10 was further confirmed from elemental analysis. Similarly, the structure of the alkyne dendron 11 was also confirmed from the spectral and analytical data.
The synthetic pathway leading to the chloro- and azidodendrimers, 14 and 16 and 15 and 17, is shown in Scheme 2. The divergent synthesis begins with the reaction of 1.0 equiv. of 2,7-bis(azidomethyl)-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene, 13, with 2.1 equiv. of 1,3-bis(chloromethyl)-5-(propargyloxy)-benzene, 12, under Cu(I)-catalyzed click reaction conditions to give the chlorodendrimer 14 in 93% yield, which upon further treatment with NaN3 in DMF at 90 °C afforded the corresponding azidodendrimer 15 in 89% yield (Scheme 2). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 15 displayed a singlet at δ 4.31 ppm for the azidomethyl protons and two singlets at δ 5.20 and 5.61 ppm for the O-methylene and N-methylene protons, and a sharp singlet at δ 7.53 ppm for the triazolyl proton, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of the azido compound 15 displayed the azidomethyl carbon at δ 54.4 ppm and two signals at δ 55.3 and 62.2 ppm for the N-methylene and O-methylene carbons, respectively, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (ESI-MS) of azidodendrimer 15 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 930 (M + 1). Furthermore, the structure of azidodendrimer 15 was also confirmed by elemental analysis.
After synthesizing the first generation azidodendrimer, we focused our attention on the synthesis of the second generation azidodendrimer. The reaction of 4.1 equiv. of 1,3-bis(chloromethyl)-5-(propargyloxy)benzene 12 with 1.0 equiv. of azidodendrimer 15 under Cu(I) catalyzed click reaction conditions gave the second generation chlorodendrimer 16 in 89% yield, which on further treatment with NaN3 in DMF at 90 °C afforded the corresponding azidodendrimer 17 in 80% yield (Scheme 2).
The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 17 displayed a singlet at δ 4.31 ppm for the azidomethyl protons and four singlets at δ 5.10, 5.21, 5.45 and 5.59 ppm for the different types of O-methylene and N-methylene proton, and sharp singlets at δ 7.54 and 7.59 ppm for the two different triazolyl protons, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of compound 17 displayed the azidomethyl carbon at δ 54.4 ppm and four signals at δ 53.7, 55.3, 61.9 and 62.1 ppm for the four types of N-methylene and O-methylene carbon, respectively, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF) of azidodendrimer 17 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 1921 [M + Na]+. Furthermore, the structure of azidodendrimer 17 was also confirmed from elemental analysis.
The zeroth, first and second generation dendrimers, 1 and 2 (G0), 3 and 4 (G1) and 5 and 6 (G2), could be achieved by the click chemistry approach using 2,7-bis(azidomethyl)-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene 13 as the core unit. The functionalization reaction of the zeroth, first and second generation azidodendrimers, 13, 15 and 17, with 2.1/4.1/8.1 equivalents of propargyloxy triphenylamine chalcones 10 and 11 under Cu(I) catalyzed click reaction conditions, afforded the triphenylamine chalcone dendrimers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in 86%, 78%, 76%, 81%, 71% and 74% yields, respectively (Scheme 3).
The 1H NMR spectrum of dendrimer (G0) 2 showed a set of four proton singlets at δ 5.26 and 5.62 for the O-methylene and N-methylene protons and a sharp singlet at δ 7.55 ppm for the triazolyl proton, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of dendrimer 2 showed signals at δ 55.4 and 62.1 for the O-methylene and N-methylene carbons and the carbonyl carbon appeared at δ 188.6, in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF) of compound 2 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 1642 [M + Na]+. Furthermore, the structure of compound 2 was also confirmed from elemental analysis. Similarly, the structures of the zeroth, first and second generation dendrimers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were also confirmed from the spectral and analytical data.
The symmetrical structures of 1–6 and their extensive spectral studies, viz. NMR, MALDI-TOF MS and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), led to unambiguous structural determination. The formation of triazole chalcones 2, 3 and 6 was evidenced by the appearance of newly formed triazolyl protons at δ 7.55, 7.60 and 7.60 ppm, respectively, from the corresponding 1H NMR spectra.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of dendrimers 1–6 recorded in CH2Cl2 (1 × 10−6 M) are presented in Fig. 2 and the λmax values are summarized in Table 1. In the absorption spectra, dendrimers 1–6 exhibited two absorption bands at 308 and 408 nm, which correspond to the π–π*and n–π* transitions due to the presence of triphenylamine and fluorene units. Dendrimers 1, 3 and 5 show a small red shift of 14 nm compared to dendrimers 2, 4 and 6 due to the presence of an electron withdrawing bromine atom. The molar extinction coefficient of dendrimers 1–6 increases significantly with the increasing dendrimer generation. As the number of triphenylamine units increases from the zeroth generation to the second generation, the absorption intensity also increases, which indicates that the amount of light absorbed by the dendritic antennae increases from a lower generation to a higher generation, which is otherwise known as the valence effect in dendrimer chemistry.

The fluorescence spectra of dendrimers 1–6 were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer using CH2Cl2 as the solvent, and the fluorescence parameters are presented in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3, upon excitation at 420 nm, dendrimers 1–6 show strong emission bands in the range of 608–665 nm. The emission intensity of dendrimers 1–6 gradually increases with the increase in dendritic generation due to the higher number of triphenylamine moieties in the periphery. Dendrimers 1, 3 and 5 exhibited strong red shifts compared to dendrimers 2, 4 and 6. Due to the presence of electronegative bromine, the second generation dendrimer 6 shows a blue shift of 38 nm compared to dendrimer 5.

The fluorescence quantum yields, Φf, of dendrimers 1–6 have been measured in ethanol using coumarin 153 as the standard. The fluorescence quantum yields of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 lie in the range of 0.14–0.08, and compound 6 shows the lowest fluorescence quantum yield of 0.08 (Table 1).
Solvatochromism studies were carried out for all the dendrimers in different solvents to evaluate the effects of solvent polarity on the optical properties of the molecules. The absorption and emission spectra of 1–6 were recorded in solvents of different polarity, such as 1,4-dioxane (Diox), chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Fig. 4). The absorption and emission data observed in the selected solvents are listed in Table 2. Dendrimers 1–6 showed small changes in absorption upon varying the polarity of the solvent used for measurement (ESI, Fig. S1 and S2 and Table S1). However, dendrimers 5 and 6 (Fig. 5) showed prominent positive solvatochromism in the emission spectra only. Dendrimers 5 and 6 exhibit strong emission bands in the range of 621–667 nm in dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,4-dioxane and N,N-dimethylformamide, whereas in tetrahydrofuran the peaks were observed at lower emission wavelengths of 533 and 534 nm. The corresponding photographic images of the fluorescent solutions are shown in Fig. 5.

However, in solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,4-dioxane and N,N-dimethylformamide, the emission peak shifted to the red end of the spectrum, compared to that in tetrahydrofuran solvent, as shown in Fig. 5. Similarly, the Stokes shift is higher in polar solvents for dendrimers 5 and 6, which have a greater number of triphenylamine moieties at the surface. As they show greater polarization than the ground states, the excited states will be stabilized in polar solvents. The evidence for this is the larger Stokes’ shifts and longer emission wavelengths. It is reasonable to assume that the fluorene unit acts as a strong π-acceptor in the excited state.

The redox behaviour of dendrimers 1–6 was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 (1 × 10−3 M) at room temperature with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. All of the compounds exhibit an electrochemical response, and the cyclic voltammograms of dendrimers 1–6 are shown in Fig. 6, with the redox potentials listed in Table 3. The oxidation and reduction potentials for all of the dendrimers appeared in the potential range of −2.0 to +2.0 V. The reversible oxidation potentials for dendrimers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were obtained at 1.18 V, 1.24 V, 1.20 V, 1.36 V, 1.33 V and 1.49 V, respectively, and the reversible reduction peaks were observed at 0.83 V, 0.87 V, 0.74 V, 0.92 V, 0.80 V and 0.84 V, respectively. All of the dendrimers exhibit quasi-reversible behavior in their cyclic voltammograms due to the strong electron donating triphenylamine moiety. More importantly, both oxidation and reduction peaks occur in the positive potential regions, revealing that these dendrimers easily lose electrons from the triphenylamine units. Furthermore, the oxidation potential increases with the increasing dendrimer generation in the following order: 1 (1.18 V), 3 (1.20 V), 2 (1.24 V), 5 (1.33 V), 4 (1.36 V) and 6 (1.49 V). The second generation dendrimers 5 and 6 exhibited facile oxidation at a higher positive potential, attributed to the removal of electrons from the triphenylamine units. The cathodic peak potential shifts from lower to higher generation dendrimers due to the presence of a greater number of triphenylamine units at the periphery, which increases the electron density in the dendrimeric system.

Various nitrogen-based organic molecules, such as aminopyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrolidinopyridine and pyrrolidinoethylpyridine, have been used as additives to increase Voc which ultimately increases the solar energy harvesting efficiency (η) of the DSSCs. In an attempt to examine the effect of dendrimers as additives on solar cell performance, studies were carried out to observe the nature of the electrolytic solution in enhancing the performance of DSSCs. The efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell is related to the various components of DSSCs, such as TiO2, the dye, the iodide/triiodide concentration and the Pt surface. Among these, the redox electrolyte system (I−/I3−) occupies an important role in the power conversion efficiency of a DSSC. The redox couples without organic additives show a decreased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc). After adding the dendrimers as additives, the sublimation of iodine decreases, which in turn increases the Voc and Jsc values and improves the efficiency (η). Hence, nitrogen containing compounds form stable molecular complexes with the (I−/I3−) electrolyte system and drastically alter Voc due to the electron donating property of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. In the present investigation, we have synthesized a new series of 1,2,3-triazole-based electron rich triphenylamine chalcone dendrimers, 1–6, and employed them as additives for DSSCs. The tested dendrimers significantly affect the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells as shown in Fig. 7.

Upon passing from the zeroth generation dendrimers to the second generation dendrimers, Voc, Jsc and the current also increase due to the presence of an increasing number of triazole and triphenylamine units. The higher generation dendrimers 5 and 6 show greater efficiency in harvesting the solar energy than the lower generation dendrimers 1, 2, 3 and 4 when used as an additive in DSSCs. The photovoltaic performance data of the short-circuit current (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor and the electric energy efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 4.

In conclusion, by using a click chemistry approach, dendrimers with the triphenylaminochalcone group have been synthesized in good yields. Photophysical studies reveal that the presence of more triazolyl and triphenylamine units increases the light absorbing capacity of the dendritic antennae, and hence higher generation dendrimers show greater light absorbing abilities than the lower generation dendrimers. In electrochemical studies, the cathodic potential also increases as the dendrimer generation increases. Furthermore, from DSSC studies, as the dendritic generation increases the power conversion efficiency (η) also increases due to the increased number of triazole and triphenylamine units. Dendrimers 5 and 6 exhibit power conversion efficiencies (η) of 8.6 and 7.1% respectively when used as additives in DSSCs, which are better than that of the control (N3 dye/KI/I2) as well as that when other triphenylaminochalcone dendrimers are used as additives.

All chemicals and solvents were purchased commercially and used as such without further purification. All melting points were determined using a Toshniwal melting point apparatus by the open capillary tube method and are uncorrected. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (ACME, 100–200 mesh). TLC was performed on glass plates coated with silica gel-G (ACME) of about 0.25 mm thickness and visualized with iodine. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 300 MHz instruments. Chemical shifts are given in parts per million, and J values are in hertz. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer CHNS 2400 instrument. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed with a 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) matrix.


10% NaOH (5 mL) was added to a solution of 4-(propargyloxy)acetophenone and 4-formyl triphenylamine/4-(bis(4-bromophenyl)amino)benzaldehyde in ethanol (10 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 8 h, after which the reaction mixture was acidified with 1 N HCl (1 mL) and evaporated to dryness. The residue obtained was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL) and washed with water (3 × 100 mL) and brine (100 mL) and then dried over Na2SO4. Evaporation of the organic layer gave the residue, which was purified by column chromatography using hexane:CHCl3 (3:2) as an eluent.


Sodium azide (1.5 mmol) was added to the solution of the corresponding dendritic chloride (1 mmol) in dry DMF (20 mL) and stirred at 75 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. It was then poured into ice cold water (30 mL) and extracted with CHCl3 (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (100 mL) and saturated NaCl solution (3 × 100 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography (SiO2) using the eluent as specified under each compound.


A mixture of the polypropargylated compound (1.0 equiv. per azide functionalization) and the azido compound (1.2 equiv.), CuSO4·5H2O (0.3 equiv.) and sodium L-ascorbate (0.3 equiv.) was stirred at room temperature for 18 h in a 3:1 mixture of THF/water. After confirming the completion of the reaction by TLC, chloroform (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the organic layer was washed with water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL) then dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to obtain the crude product, which was then purified by column chromatography (SiO2) using the eluent as specified under each compound.
