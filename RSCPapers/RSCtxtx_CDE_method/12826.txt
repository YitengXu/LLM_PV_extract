In this work, three novel acene-based organic semiconductors, including 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)naphtho[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (TPA-NADT-TPA), 4,4′-(anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TPA-ANR-TPA) and N2,N2,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)anthracene-2,6-diamine (DPA-ANR-DPA), are designed and synthesized for use in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In OLEDs, devices based on TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA showed pure blue, blue green, and green emission, respectively. Also, the maximum brightness of the devices with a turn-on voltage of 3.8 V reached 8682 cd m−2 for TPA-NADT-TPA, 11180 cd m−2 for TPA-ANR-TPA, and 18600 cd m−2 for DPA-ANR-DPA. These new materials are also employed as hole transporting materials (HTMs) in inverted PSCs, where they were used without additives. The inverted devices based on these HTMs achieved an overall efficiency of 10.27% for TPA-NADT-TPA, 7.54% for TPA-ANR-TPA, and 6.05% for DPA-ANR-DPA under identical conditions (AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2). While the PSCs with TPA-NADT-TPA as the HTM achieved the highest efficiency, the DPA-ANR-DPA-based OLED devices showed the brightest emission and efficiency. Based on the obtained promising performance, it is clear that this molecular design presents a new research strategy to develop materials that can be used in multiple types of devices.

To date, a considerable inventory of organic semiconductors, including small molecules and polymers, have been synthesized and implemented in various organic electronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSCs or OPV), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and so on. These materials can be categorized into two groups based on their applications. One includes a single organic semiconducting material that can be designed for a single specific application. There is rich literature in which such materials and devices have been reported. The other group can be defined as multipurpose materials where a single molecule can be used in several types of devices. It has been widely reported that materials developed for OFET devices can also be used successfully for OPV devices and exhibit very high performance in both types of devices. Currently, there are a few studies relative to organic semiconducting materials which can be used for dual applications such as OSCs and PSCs. However, there are hardly any studies on organic semiconductors which can be used for dual applications in OLEDs and PSCs. Herein, we report the use of a single type of materials for two different types of devices, namely, OLEDs and PSCs.

The application of OLEDs in TVs, smartphones, digital cameras, and so on has been very successful commercially because this technology guarantees high-energy efficiency and pure bright colours; it allows large area processing and is suitable for flexible displays. As a consequence, highly efficient clear red, blue, and green coloured OLED devices have been developed. However, there is still great demand to reduce the cost and further improve the performance of such devices for the production of state of the art large area processable light emitting materials. This task requires molecular engineering to develop novel organic semiconductors. High performance red/orange emissive materials already exist in the market, but for pure blue/green emission, low cost materials still remain a critical challenge, particularly in terms of high efficiency, easy availability, and colour purity.
One of the promising optoelectronic applications of organic semiconductors is to design low cost high performance charge transporting materials for PSCs. Perovskite-based solar harvesting technology has gained significant attention and became one of the hot topics in both academic and industrial research. The fast growth of PSC technology is due to astonishing improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) within the last few years (from 3.8% to 22.7% in seven years). Basically, the device configuration of PSCs is categorized into conventional (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) types. Compared to the conventional one, the inverted architectures provide many significant benefits. First, the inverted devices are fabricated by using low-temperature solution-processing techniques and thus can be simply employed on flexible substrates, leading to very promising large-area production of these devices. Second, they can avoid high-temperature instability and large hysteresis issues, which impede practical applications of PSCs. To date, several research groups have developed numerous organic semiconductors that serve as the hole transporting layer (HTL) of inverted PSC layouts. This layer is critical to achieve very high open circuit voltage (Voc) and PCE in the inverted PSCs. Furthermore, in addition to hole transport ability after exciton dissociation, the HTL plays a key role to protect the active perovskite layer from moisture/oxygen ingress and electrode penetration. Currently, the champion efficiencies of inverted PSCs are roughly 19.4% and 18.1% when using poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transporting materials (HTMs), respectively. Unfortunately, the PTAA polymer is extremely costly, being about 50 times the price of gold whereas PEDOT:PSS is hydrophilic and has a strong acidic nature which reduces the device's long-term stability. In addition to the above limitations, the molecular weight of the polymers varies batch-to-batch, which may further affect the performance of the device. Compared to polymeric semiconductor-based HTMs, small molecules, which present several intrinsic advantages such as good yield, defined molecular structure, tunable energetics and good batch-to-batch reproducibility, can alleviate these limitations. One of the most well-known small molecular HTMs is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirbiuorene (Spiro-OMeTAD). Although Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices achieved a remarkable performance of 20.8%, there are significant drawbacks of Spiro-OMeTAD including high cost, multistep synthesis and poor cell stability. Spiro-OMeTAD usually requires salt-type additives to enhance the conductivity in order to achieve high performance of the device. Due to the use of salts as additives, the PSC devices are prone to environmental instability and the performance degrades rapidly. These bottlenecks can be addressed by developing new generation HTMs via molecular design.
In the present work, we report three novel small molecules, namely 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)naphtho[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (TPA-NADT-TPA), 4,4′-(anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TPA-ANR-TPA) and N2,N2,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)anthracene-2,6-diamine (DPA-ANR-DPA) using fused anthracene and naphthodithiophene cores, respectively. The optical, thermal, and electronic properties are characterised experimentally as well as using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The materials exhibit high thermal stability, good solubility, and high fluorescence efficiency. These materials were used as active light emitting materials in OLED devices and demonstrated promising performance with bright blue-green emission and high brightness. The same materials were also used as hole transporting layers in PSC devices, where they could achieve the highest PCE exceeding 10%. To the best of our knowledge, these newly developed organic small molecules are reported here for the first time with dual functions as dopants in OLEDs and pristine hole transporting materials (HTMs) in PSCs.

Acene cores have been used successfully for synthesizing various classes of organic semiconductors for a wide range of applications including OFETs, OLEDs, PSCs, and OPV devices. Due to their fused aromatic structure and planar nature, acenes can be considered as a potent class of conjugated building blocks for constructing new high performance organic semiconductors. In this work, we have used two simply fused cores based on a fused phenylene aromatic compound, “anthracene”, and naphthalene fused with thiophene, “naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene”, respectively. The rationale for the choice of anthracene (ANR) and naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NADT) cores is due to their planar nature. Planar groups are extremely beneficial for organic electronics because they can provide high charge-carrier mobility and ultimately high performance. Additionally, their fused nature is significant for better π–π stacking due to large orbital overlap. Herein, the ANR group has been rationally selected due to its key important features such as strong emission and high charge carrier mobility. Besides the ANR core, we have also used the NADT-fused core due to its more extended conjugation than ANR. Fusion of two thiophene rings with naphthalene makes it more electron rich and highly planar. NADT would be an ideal core to compare with the ANR core because both of these units possess high charge carrier mobility and high performance in devices. Furthermore, the attachment of thiophene moieties in the NADT structure has been shown to improve OLED, OSC, and PSC performance. ANR and NADT groups were selected as cores whereas triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA) moieties are selected as end-capping groups in order to study their effects on the device performance. The TPA unit has been widely used in OSCs, DSSCs and PSCs owing to its 3D propeller design, strong electron-donating and transporting capabilities and amorphous structure forming ability. Its derivatives are also implemented widely as hole-transporting or light-emitting materials in OLEDs. However, the long intermolecular distance of the non-planar TPA may lead to low hole mobility. Thus, DPA groups are introduced at the end of ANR and NADT cores for comparison with TPA. Although the DPA group is a weaker electron donor compared to TPA, DPA derivatives have demonstrated high efficiencies in OSCs, DSSCs and PSCs. However, there are very few studies reporting DPA-based derivatives for OLEDs.

The synthesis routes of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA are depicted in Scheme 1. First, the synthesis of the precursor 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (2) and 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)aniline (3) followed earlier attempts. The NADT core (2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)naphtho[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (5)) was prepared by using naphtho[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (4) with trimethyltin chloride (Me3SnCl) and n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent at room temperature for 12 h. The target TPA-NADT-TPA was synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction between compounds (2) and (5) using a tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] catalyst at 110 °C for 48 h in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. Meanwhile, the synthesis of TPA-ANR-TPA was based on a Suzuki coupling reaction between compounds (3) and (6) using a tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium [Pd(PPh3)4] catalyst and a 2 M K2CO3 base at 120 °C for 48 h in toluene solvent. The target compound DPA-ANR-DPA was prepared via a Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction between compound (6) and bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine using a tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium [Pd2(dba)3] catalyst, tri-tert-butylphosphine (tBu3P), and sodium tert-butoxide (NaOtBu) at 110 °C for 48 h in toluene solvent. After purification, TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA's yield was 38.2%, 38.3% and 50.2%, respectively. Their purity was proved by proton and C13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S3, ESI). The molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. While the solubility of DPA-ANR-DPA was extremely good in most common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and chlorobenzene, TPA-NADT-TPA and TPA-ANR-TPA exhibited a lower solubility due to their highly conjugated backbone and rigid chemical structure.


Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures and frontier orbital electron density distributions of the three new small molecules computed with DFT at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level with a PCM model of the chloroform solvent. The computed frontier orbital energies, optical absorption and photoluminescence data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). In all three molecules, both the LUMO and HOMO orbitals are delocalized over the entire aromatic system, which is extremely important for efficient charge transport. Indeed, the electron distribution of the LUMO is primarily localized on NADT and ANR cores whereas the HOMO is fully delocalized over the entire molecules including the end-capping groups, reflecting the electron-rich nature of TPA and DPA. The calculated HOMO values of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, and DPA-ANR-DPA are −4.90, −4.84 and −4.69 eV, respectively; the LUMO values are −1.90, −2.03 and −1.83 eV, respectively. The theoretical HOMO–LUMO trend helps understand the effect of end capping groups and the nature of the core on energy level tuning. Specifically one observes a lower LUMO with TPA vs. DPA, which corresponds to delocalization of the LUMO onto the core-adjacent phenyl units of TPA. The DPA unit leads to a higher HOMO, likely due to steric hindrance with the core of DPA's both phenyl units vs. a single core-adjacent unit with TPA. This trend is similar to the experimental results below, while the absolute values of the HOMO and the LUMO differ due to the difference in the aggregate state and approximations, as expected. We also note that the computed LUMO is higher than the estimate below based on the optical gap as the latter is downshifted due to broadening effects (being determined from the onset of absorption).


We measured the HOMO energy levels in thin films using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA), whereas the LUMO values were calculated from the difference between the HOMO values and the optical bandgap. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Using PESA, the HOMO values of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA are estimated to be at −5.27, −5.40 and −5.33 eV, respectively. These HOMO values matched well with those of perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, −5.44 eV) and host (MADN, −5.6 eV) materials, suggesting a good hole injection ability of these new materials. Regarding the ANR core, the replacement of end-capping TPA by DPA has affected the HOMO energy level, which proves that TPA units have a stronger electron donating ability than DPA ones. This is consistent with the observed red shifts in the UV-Vis spectra of both compounds and the trend observed for the energy levels of other HTMs based on the ANR core in an earlier report. From the obtained LUMO values of these compounds, it is clear that they have appropriate values, which are sufficient to block the electron injection due to high-energy offset (Fig. 2).

The optical properties of all newly developed materials characterized by UV-Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA in chloroform (CF) solutions and solid films are shown in Fig. 3a and the photophysical data are recorded in Table 1. Overall, there is a similar pattern of the spectra between the thin films and solutions, suggesting that there is no significant crystallization in thin films. On account of intermolecular interactions in the solid state, a slight bathochromic shift is observed in the absorption spectra of solid-state films compared to that of solutions. Additionally, the red shift is attributed to the increased π-electron density (π–π* transitions) of the compound. There is obvious red-shifted absorption among these compounds in the order: DPA-ANR-DPA < TPA-ANR-TPA < TPA-NADT-TPA which could be ascribed to: (a) the DPA unit having a lower electron-donating ability compared to the TPA unit due to the number of phenyl groups present in the structure; (b) the NADT moiety retaining a higher electron-donating ability in comparison with the ANR moiety due to electron-rich two thiophene units fused with naphthalene. The optical absorption spectra of these materials exhibit peaks in the ultraviolet (300–350 nm) and visible (400–500 nm) regions. TPA-NADT-TPA shows a strong peak (402 nm) in the visible area and a lower one in the UV region whereas ANR derivatives behave conversely. Compound DPA-ANR-DPA unveils absorption maxima at 330 nm for solution and 335 nm for thin films whereas the absorption peaks in solution and thin films of TPA-ANR-TPA are at 351 and 361 nm, respectively. Indeed, the optical band gaps of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA are 2.63, 2.58 and 2.37 eV, respectively, which are determined from the absorption onset wavelength (Eoptg = 1240/λonset) of the corresponding absorption spectrum.

The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra for these three small molecules were obtained in CF solution and are illustrated in Fig. 3b. The emission maximum peaks are found to be at 474 nm for TPA-NADT-TPA, 513 nm for TPA-ANR-TPA, and 522 nm for DPA-ANR-DPA. Stokes shift, which is defined as the gap between the ground state S0 and the first excited state S1, is calculated from the difference between the maximum of absorption and emission spectra. These compounds possess large Stokes shifts in the order: TPA-NADT-TPA (72 nm) < TPA-ANR-TPA (162 nm) < DPA-ANR-DPA (192 nm), indicating that these materials can play dual functionality in both organic light emitting diodes and perovskite solar cells. Note that the measured trend in the PL peaks corresponds to that computed with TD-DFT (Table S1, ESI). According to TD-DFT, the peaks are due to LUMO → HOMO transitions; the corresponding HOMO → LUMO transitions in the absorption spectrum correspond in the experimental spectrum to less intense peaks around 475 nm for DPA-ANR-DPA and around 440 nm for TPA-ANR-TPA and to the main peak around 425 nm for TPA-NADT-TPA.

In addition to the optical properties, the thermal properties of these new small molecules were also studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S5, ESI) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S6, ESI). The thermal properties of the molecules are vital in order to study the effect of thermal annealing of the thin film on the performance of devices. The summarized thermal data are listed in Table 1. According to TGA, these molecules start to decompose at a temperature above 431 °C for TPA-NADT-TPA, 438 °C for TPA-ANR-TPA and 370 °C for DPA-ANR-DPA, showing their high thermal stability. The high and almost identical thermal stability of both TPA-NADT-TPA and TPA-ANR-TPA is attributed to their rigid molecular pi-conjugated backbone. In addition to this observation, the DSC results also exhibited a low glass transition temperature (Tg) of 101, 108 and 122 °C for DPA-ANR-DPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, and TPA-NADT-TPA, respectively. Notably, while TPA-ANR-TPA and TPA-NADT-TPA do not show a crystallization temperature (Tc), that of DPA-ANR-DPA is observed at 183 °C. The high melting point and glass transition temperature of all three compounds suggest good heat tolerance for device fabrication and operation if annealing of thin films is required.


Owing to intense luminescence of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, and DPA-ANR-DPA (both solution and solid state) under a UV-lamp, we decided to investigate them further in OLED devices using the thin film as an active light-emitting layer. To prove this, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these compounds was estimated in chloroform solution and neat thin films. The corresponding data are shown in Table 2. The same molecules are also studied in PSC devices, which are shown in the next part, in order to investigate the effect of three different chemical structures on the device performance.

For OLED devices, a host–guest layer was introduced because this system has the benefit of improving electroluminescence and operational stability. 3 wt% of each TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, and DPA-ANR-DPA materials were doped into a wide-band-gap host material as an emissive layer in OLED devices, which is illustrated in Fig. 4a. Their use as a dopant in a wide band gap host improves hole injection ability and reduces the concentration-quenching effect on emitters. A simple OLED device architecture was fabricated as follows: ITO/HATCN/NPB/MADN: dopant/TPBi/LiF/Al. According to this configuration, 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATCN) and 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) act as hole injecting and transporting layers whereas 2-methyl-9,10-bis(naphthalen-2-yl)anthracene (MADN) was used as the host compound with our newly synthesized dopant as a light-emitting layer. Additionally, 1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl benzimidizol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) was used as the hole-blocking or electron-transporting layer whereas LiF was used as the electron injecting layer. The chemical structure of all these functional materials is illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI).
The characterization of a series of OLED devices is shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The relevant data are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 5, the emission color varies from sky blue (TPA-NADT-TPA), blue-green (TPA-ANR-TPA) to pure green (DPA-ANR-DPA). The obtained brightness is indeed very high and promising. The electroluminescence (EL) peaks for TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA based OLED devices are recorded at 465 nm, 486 nm, and 522 nm with the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) coordinates (0.16, 0.23), (0.17, 0.39), and (0.32, 0.62), respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that the maximum brightness of the devices was 8682 cd m−2 for TPA-NADT-TPA, 11180 cd m−2 for TPA-ANR-TPA, and 18600 cd m−2 for DPA-ANR-DPA respectively. In addition, the power efficiency (PE) for TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, DPA-ANR-DPA based OELD devices was 3.1, 5.9, and 8.0 lumen per watt (lm W−1) at 4 V, respectively. All the OLED devices exhibit a low turn on voltage close to 3.8 V. The lower voltage is due to an appropriate HOMO energy level. The current efficiency (CE) of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, DPA-ANR-DPA based OELD devices is 4.0, 7.8, and 11.5 candela per ampere (cd A−1) respectively. Among them, DPA-ANR-DPA based devices exhibited a higher CE, PE and brightness. Meanwhile, the emission of TPA-ANR-TPA results in blue-green light and its OLEDs show the lowest efficiency, which is due to its more pronounced molecular aggregation. For ANR derivatives, while the DPA groups do not have a strong electron-donating ability as compared to the TPA ones, the CE, PE and maximum brightness of DPA-ANR-DPA in OLEDs are higher than those of TPA-ANR-TPA. On the other hand, the other ANR-based compound, namely DPA, exhibited pure blue emission in a previous report with brightness up to 6627 cd m−2. In the present study, by replacing two phenyl rings with DPA and TPA units, the brightness increases to 11180 cd m−2 for DPA-ANR-DPA and 18600 cd m−2 for TPA-ANR-TPA. Also, the emission color diverges from pure blue into pure green (DPA-ANR-DPA) and blue-green (TPA-ANR-TPA), which indicates that the introduction of stronger electron donating units has effects on the emission color of ANR derivative-based OLEDs. The promising performance of all of the newly designed materials in OLED devices clearly indicates the great potential of acene-based organic semiconductors.

Since the molecular design of TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, and DPA-ANR-DPA contains TPA and DPA end-capping groups at the end of the acene cores which facilitate hole conduction, all these materials could be potential materials for the HTL in perovskite solar cells as suggested by earlier reports. Therefore, these compounds were implemented in the inverted device layouts: glass/ITO/HTL/perovskite/PCPM/BCP/Ag as in our previous study. In this structure, the active layer is CH3NH3PbI3 whereas 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) acts as an electron extracting and hole blocking layer and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron transporting compact layer. The device construction and energy levels of each layer are illustrated in Fig. 4b. Moreover, the chemical structures of PCPM and BCP are depicted in Fig. S8 (ESI).

The performance of inverted devices based on different HTMs was investigated and is shown in Fig. 7. According to cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a complete device shown in Fig. 7a, above the indium tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass there is a thin layer of HTM and the perovskite layer, an electron transporting layer (including PCBM and BCP) and a back silver electrode. Fig. 7b presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics measured under simulated sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 3. Overall, the devices based on these new HTMs are found to achieve a PCE of 10.27% for TPA-NADT-TPA, 7.54% for TPA-ANR-TPA and 6.05% for DPA-ANR-DPA, compared to that of the standard PEDOT:PSS based device (11.29%). The lower efficiency of TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA based devices compared to standard PEDOT:PSS ones may be caused by the aggregation of these chemical structures. This is related to their low solubility in chlorobenzene/dichlorobenzene, which makes it more challenging to obtain smooth and uniform films. In addition, the devices based on TPA-NADT-TPA and PEDOT:PSS HTMs result in a better PCE in comparison with others because of the presence of thiophene units. For ANR derivatives, even though DPA-ANR-DPA shows a better solubility than TPA-ANR-TPA, the device efficiency of the TPA-ANR-TPA HTL is higher than that of DPA-ANR-DPA. This may be attributed to the less strong electron-donating ability of DPA units, leading to a lower hole mobility of the DPA compound. This result also agrees well with earlier studies reporting that the efficiency achieved using HTMs based on TPA end-capping groups is greater than that with DPA under similar conditions in inverted and mesoporous configurations.

As shown in Table 3, devices with the TPA-NADT-TPA HTL present a better open-circuit voltage (Voc) than that with PEDOT:PSS, demonstrating a better band alignment of the TPA-NADT-TPA HTL with the perovskite layer. Although the HOMO values of TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA are close to that of perovskite materials, their Voc values are no better than that of TPA-NADT-TPA. This may be triggered by the poor uniformity of these materials and high interfacial recombination in the devices, leading to the low efficiency of ANR derivatives. Additionally, the short-circuit current (Jsc) for TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA are 20.04, 16.68, and 17.49 mA cm−2, respectively. These values also match well with the values obtained from the integrated external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (as shown in Fig. 7c). While the Jsc of TPA-NADT-TPA HTL-based devices is better than that of standard PEDOT:PSS HTL, the devices with the TPA-NADT-TPA HTL exhibit a lower PCE than those using the PEDOT:PSS HTL. The reason is due to a significant drop in the fill factor (FF) of TPA-NADT-TPA, which may be caused by a less smooth film and lower mobility of this new material. The series resistance (Rs) of the four HTL-based devices was derived from the J–V curves according to a previous report. The PEDOT:PSS-based PSC shows a low Rs value of 5.36 Ω cm2, while the TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA based PSCs show higher Rs values of 10.68 Ω cm2, 8.52 Ω cm2 and 9.43 Ω cm2. The higher Rs values for the three new HTLs resulted in a lower FF and subsequently limited the PCE.

In summary, we have designed and developed a novel series of acene-based solution processable organic semiconductors with triphenylamine and diphenylamine end-capping groups. The compounds namely 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)naphtho[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (TPA-NADT-TPA), 4,4′-(anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TPA-ANR-TPA), and N2,N2,N6,N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)anthracene-2,6-diamine (DPA-ANR-DPA) were synthesized by Stille, Suzuki, and Buchwald organometallic coupling. The effects of the central acene cores varying from lower conjugation anthracene to highly extended conjugated naphthodithiophene attached to the end-capping triphenyl and diphenyl amine moieties on opto-electronic properties were studied. The optical band gap is in the range of 2.3 to 2.7 eV, placing these newly compounds in the area of wide band gap compounds. Interestingly, these materials, which possess suitable LUMO–HOMO energy levels, can have dual functionality in OLEDs and PSCs. For OLED devices based on these materials, their electroluminescence maximum varies in the range of 465 nm to 522 nm with sky-blue, blue-green to pure green thin film colour emission. Additionally, they exhibit a low turn-on voltage of 3.8 V and strong emission with the maximum brightness of 8682 cd m−2 for TPA-NADT-TPA, 11180 cd m−2 for TPA-ANR-TPA, and 18600 cd m−2 for DPA-ANR-DPA. These small molecules have been also fabricated successfully in perovskite solar cell devices as HTMs without additives. The inverted devices based on these HTMs achieve an overall efficiency of 10.27% for TPA-NADT-TPA, 7.54% for TPA-ANR-TPA and 6.05% for DPA-ANR-DPA. The excellent performance of these newly designed materials, in both OLED and PSC devices, confirms that our innovative molecular design of organic semiconductors is a promising and versatile approach. These materials play a dual role and this opens up a new research strategy where single materials can be used for multiple devices.

OLED devices based on TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA were fabricated by thermal evaporation. The three synthesized materials were used as dopants with the device configuration of: ITO/HATCN (10 nm)/NPB (45 nm)/MADN: 3 wt% dopant (35 nm)/TPBi (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm). In this configuration, 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATCN) and 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) act as hole injecting and transporting layers, respectively. Additionally, while 2-methyl-9,10-bis(naphthalen-2-yl)anthracene (MADN) was used as the host compound, 1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl benzimidizol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) was used as the electron-transporting layer. Furthermore, LiF and Al were used as the electron injecting layer and cathode, respectively. All organic and inorganic layers were deposited onto the UV ozone treated ITO glass substrates in a multiple thermal source vacuum deposition chamber at 2 × 10−6 Torr. The device electroluminescence performances such as current–voltage, brightness, electroluminescence spectra, and CIE co-ordinates were measured and recorded using a Spectra PR650 CCD camera with a computer-controlled DC power supply.


Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, AI 4083) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Heraeus and Lumtec, respectively. PbI2 was purchased from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PCBM (60) was purchased from Nano-C. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized according to a previously reported method. The perovskite precursor solution (MAPbI3) was prepared by dissolving MAI and PbI2 at a stoichiometric ratio in gammabutyrolactone/dimethyl sulfoxide (7:3 v/v, 1.1 M) at 80 °C.

Perovskite solar cells were prepared on a pre-cleaned patterned ITO substrate. A filtered PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on ITO at 3000 rpm and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. For new HTM (TPA-NADT-TPA, TPA-ANR-TPA, and DPA-ANR-DPA) based devices, while TPA-ANR-TPA was prepared with a mixed solvent of chloroform and 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 2 mg mL−1 (1:1 v/v), TPA-NADT-TPA and DPA-ANR-DPA were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 5 mg mL−1. Afterwards, they were spin-coated on the ITO substrate. The film thickness was varied by changing the spin speed from 2000 rpm to 5000 rpm. The perovskite precursor solution (pre-heated at 80 °C) was spin-coated onto these hole-transporting layers at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s, and 250 μL toluene was dripped on the sample surface at 15 s of the second step spin-coating. Subsequently, the perovskite layer was annealed at 80 °C for 5 min and at 100 °C for 30 min. The PCBM solution was coated from a chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The devices were completed by evaporating BCP (6 nm) and Ag (120 nm) sequentially under high vacuum (1× 10−6 mbar). The active area was 7 mm2 as defined by the overlapping between the back electrode and ITO. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a calibrated solar simulator (AAA, SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO., LTD) coupled with a Keithley 2400 Source meter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained by combining a monochromatic light source, a light chopper and a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP).
