Development of new low-cost technologies for high-efficiency quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) is an effective way to solve current energy and environmental problems. Over the past few years QDSCs employing inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals as the light harvesters, introduced in 2010 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5%, have attracted much attention since the recent breakthrough PCE reports of over 12%. In this review, the strategies to obtain highly efficient QDSCs are discussed in detail from the viewpoints of QD sensitizers, properties of photoanode films, counter electrodes, redox electrolytes, and the interfacial passivation method. Furthermore, the limitations and further prospects are also discussed of how to fabricate QDSC devices with high efficiency and excellent stability. It is expected that these goals can be realized by virtue of the above effective strategies. We believe that this review will not only offer a theoretical basis and technical support for further industrial application of QDSCs, but also provide inspiration and references for performance improvement of other types of solar cells.

With increasing concern for environmental deterioration and conventional resource depletion, the development and utilization of solar energy are steadily growing. Solar cells are key devices for solar-to-electric conversion, wherein solar energy is transformed into electric energy. Exploiting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as light-harvesting materials constitutes a promising approach toward low-cost third-generation solar cells owing to their distinct advantages such as band-gap tunability, high absorption coefficient, low-cost facile preparation, solution processability, multiple exciton generation potential, etc. As shown in Fig. 1, the configuration of quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSC) devices is analogous to that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) with a photoanode based on a QD sensitizer-loaded mesoporous metal oxide (mainly TiO2) film, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE). Under persistent sunlight irradiation, QD sensitizers can absorb photons and electrons from the valence band (VB) of QDs and transfer them to the conduction band (CB) simultaneously. Due to staggered energy levels between QDs and metal oxide film (typically, TiO2), electrons would swiftly transfer from the CB of QDs to the CB of TiO2, followed by electron transport through the TiO2 mesoporous film to the transparent conducting oxide substrate. Meanwhile, photoexcited holes in the VB of QDs can be captured by reduced species (Red) in the electrolyte, which acts as a hole-transporter medium. From the other side, photoexcited electrons will transfer from the photoanode to the CE in QDSCs. Finally, a reaction takes place between the substrate and the oxidized counterpart (Ox) in the electrolyte. The Ox species will interact with photoexcited electrons in the CE, thus completing an electrochemical transformation from Ox to Red species of the redox couple. This general mechanism of QDSC functioning is depicted in Fig. 1. Theoretically, it is impossible to convert incident light into electric energy with an efficiency of 100% using solar cell devices. To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a QDSC device can be calculated from the photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) characteristics as follows:
where
Pin is the incident solar power density on the device, Jsc is the short-circuit density, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor. The PCEs of QDSCs are in direct proportion to the parameters Voc, Jsc and FF. Encouragingly, the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs has been undergoing a rapid evolution, with PCEs increasing from initially less than 1% to 12.3%, which has accelerated the process of industrialization of QDSCs.

Although the PCEs of the best QDSCs are above 12%, compared with the theoretical PCE of 44%, they still lag behind, and many problems such as relatively low Voc and photostability should be taken into account. Besides, photo-corrosion of QD sensitizers and fast charge recombination have hindered immediate application. Hence, various optimizing strategies have been implemented to improve device performance. However, although many review articles have already described efficient technologies from the single assembly unit towards the state-of-the-art QDSC devices, few reports have been published focusing on device integrity and summarizing systematically the optimization strategies for high-efficiency QDSCs. Thus, the present review article focuses on performance improvement strategies for fabricating devices of high efficiency and excellent stability not only employing device component optimization, but also concerning the interface connection and charge transport process between them.
Up to now, several effective methodologies have been developed to resolve the issues in QDSCs: (1) rational design of QD sensitizers to balance sunlight absorption and electron injection rate; (2) establishing a semiconductor oxide substrate with special structure for maximal light harvesting; (3) immobilizing pre-synthesized QDs onto semiconductor oxide matrix to achieve a well-covered sensitizer layer; (4) surface and interface passivation treatment for decreased charge recombination; (5) exploiting a CE with high catalytic activity and conductivity together with strong affinity on some special matrix; (6) exploring an innovative quasi- or all-solid electrolyte as well as new redox couples with higher Voc and stability. From this perspective, we present an overview of various strategies to improve the PCEs of QDSCs and classify them according to the above six aspects, as shown in Fig. 2.

As the pivotal components of QDSCs, QDs play a critical role in light-harvesting and charge carrier migration. Hence, rational QD design by composition and structure, as well as surface ligand layers will provide us a direct route to assemble highly efficient QDSCs. Therefore, to get an ideal sensitizer, the following requirements should be taken into consideration: (a) narrow band gap for efficient visible light capture; (b) higher conduction band edge position for enhanced electron injection driving force; (c) faster charge separation and lower numbers of traps for decreased charge recombination. By reviewing previous studies of the optimization strategies, the architecture and methods adopted in QDs can be summarized as follows.


As-synthesized QDs used in photoanodes are typically capped with long-chain insulating ligands (TOPO, oleic acid or oleylamine). These ligands are necessary to maintain colloidal stability of QDs in organic solvents, but detrimental to efficient electronic transport in photoanodes as they are water incompatible and create an electric barrier between QDs and films. These ligands can be exchanged by short chain, and better conductive bi-functional ligands to improve water solubility and electrical conductivity, such as thioglycolic acid (TGA), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys), etc. The charge transfer rate between QD sensitizer and TiO2 matrix, for example, can be tailored in this way, and the electron injection rate for TGA-capped CdSe (8.0 × 109 s−1) has been found to be greater than that for MPA- and Cys-capped CdSe (2.6–2.9 × 109 s−1). Enhanced PCE in QDSCs with TGA-capped QDs has been mainly a consequence of the improved short-circuit density (Jsc), owing to accelerated electron transfer rate and a higher loading of TGA-capped QDs at TiO2 film. Another aspect is the presence of dangling bonds on the surface of as-prepared QDs. One promising strategy is passivation of surface trap states with ligands, including halogen atoms such as iodine, chlorine, or a complex of iodine and MPA. Such ligands can not only reduce QD surface trap states but also improve the stability of the device.

Apart from organic ligands, a recent alternative is the ligand exchange strategy with a metal chalcogenide complex (MCC). Such MCC which can completely substitute for organic ligands on the surface of QDs and increase colloidal stability and electric conductivity in QD films include SnS44−, SbS43−, AsS33−, S2− and S2O32−. Although some surface deficiencies are caused on the surface of QDs, this ligand exchange process has provided a compelling pathway toward constructing highly efficient photovoltaic devices.

QDSCs made of as-prepared QDs generally suffer from low PCE owing to sufficient charge recombination at the surface trap states. An efficient surface passivation strategy is the epitaxial growth of an appropriate shell material to form a core/shell structure. The epitaxial shell isolates excited states in the core from the surrounding medium, thus improving the chemical stability and removing surface traps. The choice of core and shell materials depends on the band offset alignment and the lattice mismatch between the core and shell. According to the band offset alignment, the core/shell QDs can be divided into three types, i.e., type-I, type-II, and inverted type-I.

Type-I core/shell structures are formed of core QDs with a wide band gap semiconductor which creates a potential barrier for both electrons and holes excited in the core. In parallel, this shell eliminates surface defects and improves luminescent emission efficiency and stability of QDs. Traditional semiconductors used in the shell for type-I core–shell QDs include ZnS, CdS, and ZnSe. For example, QDSCs with CuInSexS2−x/CdS core–shell QDs demonstrated earlier high charge transfer and low charge recombination rates. For ternary QDs, epitaxial shells have a more profound effect on the optical properties, due to the existence of a large number of surface defects. Besides, Mn-doped CdS shell can play a dual role in surface passivation and promoting electron transfer rate. An environmentally friendly ZnS as a shell material has proven to be another alternative for type-I QDs. CuInS2/ZnS core–shell QDs were typically synthesized via a cation exchange procedure in which pre-synthesized CuInS2 QDs are treated with zinc precursor at high temperature. The highest PCE (7.07%) for CuInS2-sensitized solar cells was observed upon coating CuInS2 QDs with ZnS layer (the PCE for bare CuInS2 QDs was only 5.05%).
For type-II QDs (staggered band alignment, shown in Fig. 3a), the most prominent feature is the spatial separation of charge carriers between the core and shell materials. The reduced electron–hole wave function overlap and longer exciton lifetimes in type-II QDs will significantly improve the resulting device performance. For example, the type-II CdTe/CdSe QD-based solar cell (wide absorption range, fast charge separation, and slow charge recombination) has exhibited a record PCE of 6.76% (Jsc = 19.59 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.606 V, and FF = 0.569).
As regards the inverted type-I core/shell structures, they are constructed by coating the core QDs with a narrower band gap (with a lower CB and a higher VB, shown in Fig. 3b) inorganic shell material, and the photoexcited carriers will be extracted by the oriented electric field to the surface, thus leading to a high electron injection efficiency. For example, the inverted type-I CdS/CdSe-based solar cell has exhibited a high short-circuit current of 18.02 mA cm−2 and PCE of 5.32%. Besides, as shown in Fig. 3c, Rosei and co-workers designed alloyed CdSe/CdS “giant” core/shell QDs via incorporating CdSexS1−x interfacial layers and finally obtained the maximum PCE of 7.14% in QDSCs, which benefited from the broad absorption and high electron–hole transfer rate compared to the reference single core/shell QDs. Other core/shell QDs have been explored for solar cells devices, including ZnSe/CdSe, CdTe/CdS QDs, etc. (details are in Table 1).

Most of the single binary QD sensitizer-based solar cells presented low PCE values due to the limited light-harvesting range. In comparison, ternary or quaternary alloyed QDs are a promising alternative to QD sensitizers since their band gaps can be tuned by controlling their constituent stoichiometries without changing the particle size, and a narrower band gap than that of their original binary constituents can be achieved by altering their stoichiometry, which is governed by an “optical bowing” parameter. Moreover, a higher chemical stability than their constituents can be also achieved through an alloying strategy due to the hardened lattice structure and decreased interdiffusion. A CdSxSe1−x alloyed QD-based solar cell has been reported with a maximum PCE of 3.2%, owing to its relatively wide band gap. In comparison, a one-pot route has been shown to be effective for synthesizing near-infrared (NIR) absorption edge CdSe0.45Te0.55 QDs, leading to a PCE of 6.36% (Jsc = 19.35 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.571 V, FF = 0.575), and a long-term (more than 500 h) stability. Furthermore, quaternary alloyed QDs have been confirmed to be promising candidates. In particular, Zn–Cu–In–Se based solar cells with an absorption onset extending to ∼1000 nm showed a remarkable certified PCE of 11.61% (Jsc = 25.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.739 V, and FF = 0.622). Details of other alloyed QDs are summarized in Table 1. Besides, the doping strategy can be realized by doping optically active transition metal cations into the host material. The dopants have no apparent effect on the morphology and size of the host QDs, but the optical properties of the host QDs can be dramatically changed. For instance, doping CdS QDs with Mn2+ cations results in long-lived charge carrier lifetimes, and the QDSCs constructed with Mn-doped CdS/CdSe QDs deliver a PCE of 5.42%. To date, Mn-doped QDs are still the main topic in QDSCs, and a high PCE of 9.40% (Jsc = 20.87 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.688 V, FF = 0.655) has been achieved by using Mn-doped CdSeTe QDs. Other dopants such as Bi3+-doped PbS also have potential to improve the performance of solar cell devices.


To extend the light-harvesting range without sacrificing electron injection, a co-sensitized strategy has been developed. The co-sensitized photoanodes are generally constructed by combining several kinds (or sizes) of QDs with different light-harvesting range and/or different energy band structures, as depicted in Fig. 4, by optimizing the assembly procedure and the ratio of different QDs. Such co-sensitized QDs have higher electron injection driving force with staggered band alignment, and an extended light absorption range compared with their original single constituents. For example, co-sensitized QDSCs with enhanced efficiency were prepared by combining pre-synthesized CdSe QDs and Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe)-alloyed QDs, and a high PCE value of 12.75% (Voc = 0.752 V, Jsc = 27.39 mA cm−2, FF = 0.619) has been achieved. Other co-sensitized structured QDSCs such as CdS/CdSe, PbS/CdS, and QD/dye molecule systems are also summarized in Table 1.

To summarize, strategies for optimization of QD sensitizers vary with the specific QDSC systems. In most cases, we can integrate two or more strategies into a single fabrication process of QDSCs. For example, ligand engineering is a universal strategy for modification of surface photo-electronic properties of QDs, which can be applied to various kinds of QDs including core/shell, alloyed and doped ones; co-sensitization is an alternative strategy for expanding the spectral range of light absorption of various QD sensitizers. Compared with the binary QD sensitizers, alloyed QD sensitizers are attractive candidates for future applications, due to their band-gap tunability and photo-electronic properties, through chemical composition without changing the particle size using convenient preparation techniques, such as one-pot synthesis. To sum up, from the point of view of efficiency, it is highly beneficial to harvest visible light and reduce electron transfer resistance, and all these conditions require QDs with small and tunable band gap and clean surface. On the basis of abovementioned studies, taking into account advantages of the ligand engineering and alloying strategies, the resultant QD sensitizers would provide solar cells with a high efficiency.

Semiconductor oxide photoanode films are one of the critical parts of sensitized solar cells, which mainly play the dual roles of loading the QD sensitizers for sunlight absorption and offering electrical channels to transfer the photo-excited electrons from photoanodes to conductive substrates. Accordingly, the preferred semiconductor oxide photoanode films should provide sufficient surface area and smooth electrical channels for increasing the loading amounts of QDs and facilitating the charge transportation. Therefore, considerable effort has been dedicated to designing and optimizing the composition, morphology, and structure of photoanode films through increasing sunlight absorption and scattering, shortening the electron transport pathways, and reducing the charge recombination. In this section, we summarize and discuss the rational strategies for photoanode films in QDSCs with emphasis on the surface additional treatment, multiple-doped hybrid composites, structural morphology design, etc.

To date, the widely used and investigated mesoporous films for QDSCs have been mainly based on semiconductor TiO2 materials. As shown in Fig. 5, various strategies were adopted to improve the charge transfer channels and increase sunlight absorption. As the electron acceptor and scaffolds of QD sensitizers, scientists mainly focus on constructing TiO2 mesoporous films with special morphology and structure. For example, Meng et al. modified three-dimensional TiO2 photoanode films through balancing the aperture distribution for CdS/CdSe deposition and light absorption in the long-wavelength region. By using a double-layer structured photoanode with larger TiO2 particles (300 nm), a high PCE of 4.92% has been achieved. Meanwhile, Cao et al. optimized the pore structure and the thickness of photoanode films by adjusting the content of ethyl cellulose in TiO2 paste. Finally, the resulting device has shown a PCE of 4.62% with an optimal content of ethyl cellulose in the paste (12 wt%).
Surface modification of photoanode films is also crucial to reduce the surface trap states and thus obtain highly efficient QDSC devices. A thin TiO2 passivating layer of TiCl4 hydrolysis effect coating on TiO2 nanoparticles is widely used to hinder surface recombination. Zhong et al. systematically investigated the influence of TiCl4 surface treatment of photoanode films on device performances. Experimental results demonstrated that sole TiCl4 treatment on FTO glass could effectively improve the performance of the resulting devices in comparison with the simultaneous treatment on both FTO glass and TiO2 mesoporous films. Apart from the TiCl4 surface modification, fluorine ion treatment and high band-gap insulating metallic compound such as MgO or ZnS are usually used as a barrier layer for suppressing the charge recombination at the surface of TiO2 electrodes. Bisquert et al. modified the TiO2 electrodes with F− by dipping the electrode into NH4F or HF aqueous solutions, wherein the Ti–F group could form, which may act as the electron-trapping site and further reduce the interfacial electron transfer rates by holding the trapped electrons.
Doping TiO2 hybrid photoanode films with metal ions, non-metal ions, semiconductor oxides, and carbonaceous materials is normally regarded as an effective route to improve the performance of QDSCs, where the dopants can change the electronic structure, thus controlling the conduction band or valence band position of semiconductor oxides. Meanwhile, the dopants can accelerate the charge separation dynamics of excited electrons and reduce charge recombination. For QDSCs, ion doping (e.g. B/S, Nb and Zn) has already been applied to retard charge recombination and accelerate electron transfer in photoanodes. For example, Pan et al. fabricated Zn2+-doped TiO2 photoanodes via the hydrothermal method. The PCE of the CdS-based QDSCs was 1.25 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (from 1.92% to 2.38%), which was ascribed to the reduction of electron recombination and enhancement of electron transport in TiO2 film by Zn doping. Zhang et al. prepared nitrogen-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) via the sol–gel method and applied it in QDSCs. The N element dopants could not only reduce the conduction band energy level of TiO2, leading to a well-matched band alignment with CdSe QDs, but also promote the electron–hole pair spatial separation. Besides, incorporating plasmonic nanoparticles, such as Au and Ag, into photoanode films has become an attractive approach to improve the optical absorption intensity of sunlight. For example, Cao et al. constructed TiO2/ZnO nanorod array photoanodes decorated with Ag nanoparticles. Owing to the plasmonic effect, boosted PCEs of 5.92% have been achieved with an enhancement of visible light harvesting and exciton separation.
The morphological structures of photoanode films have usually been investigated to optimize QD absorption and light scattering effect. Although the photoanode films based on TiO2 nanoparticles have a large specific surface area to ensure efficient absorption, the disordered inner connection in the films may hinder the charge transportation and influence the performance of QDSCs. Therefore, a series of specific one-, two-, and three-dimensional structures such as nanowires, nanoribbons, and nanotubes have been designed to increase the QD deposition surface area and provide an easy pathway for charge transportation. Toyoda et al. fabricated CdSe-based QDSCs with the three-dimensional inverse opal structure TiO2 film and finally obtained PCEs of 2.7%, which benefits from the three-dimensional network structure and the light-harvesting ability of the special TiO2 photoanode. Kuang et al. prepared three-dimensional hierarchical structured photoanode films combined with TiO2 hollow balls via a hydrothermal synthesis method. Taking advantages of the hollow structure, the photoanode can provide a sufficient specific surface area for QD loading, and allow harvesting the maximum sunlight by light scattering. In addition, the TiO2 nanotube array would become a good electron transfer medium for accelerating the charge migration presented in Fig. 6. The comprehensive CdS/CdSe QDSCs with the above photoanode were obtained with a PCE of 6%.
Other wide band gap semiconductor oxides such as ZnO are considered as a probable alternative to TiO2 due to their similar conduction band position, fast electron mobility, and feasible preparation process. All kinds of ZnO-based photoanodes are also widely used in QDSCs and some typical structures are illustrated in Fig. 7. For example, Cheng et al. fabricated CdSe/CdS QDSCs with three-dimensional tetrapod-like ZnO nanoparticles, yielding a PCE of 4.24% under one standard sunlight illumination. Different complex hierarchical ZnO structures were widely investigated, aiming to offer a high surface area for QD loading, and enhance the light scattering. Cao et al. assembled novel hierarchically structured ZnO nanorods/nanosheets via the in situ growth method. Likewise, a double-layer branching architecture photoanode based on ZnO nanorod array underlayer and tetrapod-like top layer was fabricated, and the obtained PCE is 5.24%, which is at the same level as that of a TiO2 photoanode. Park et al. fabricated densely formed hierarchically structured ZnO nanowire arrays utilized for photoanodes in QDSCs and obtained a PCE greater by a factor of two compared to that of bare ZnO nanowires. Kuang et al. synthesized two types of TiO2/ZnO structures, such as vertically aligned hierarchical TiO2 nanowire-coated ZnO nanorod or nanosheet hybrid arrays. Consequently, both of the Jsc and FF were significantly improved compared with the pristine TiO2 nanowires, and finally an optimized PCE value as high as 4.57% was obtained for CdS/CdSe-based QDSCs. Besides, Qureshi et al. synthesized porous hexagon shaped ZnO nanodisks with exposed polar facets and fabricated CdSe QDSCs via the chemical bath deposition process. The experimental results exhibited that solar cells based on the ZnO nanodisks showed a higher PCE of 4.86% than the conventional ZnO nanoparticles (3.14%), ZnO nanorods (2.52%), and ZnO nanosheets (1.64%), benefitting from the efficient charge separation and collection, high surface area, and excellent light scattering ability.
A series of other materials such as SnO2, NiO, ZrO2, CoO, BiVO4, BaTiO3, and Zn2SnO4 have also been exploited and used as photoanodes in QDSCs. A bandgap match between the QDs and semiconductor oxide nanocrystals was required for the charge transport and to further influence the performance in solar cells. Therefore, these photoanode materials were chosen as photoanodes in order to match the QD materials with different bandgap and conduction band. For example, SnO2 was also used as a photoanode due to its higher electron mobility and much more negative conduction band than TiO2, which matches well with the narrow-gap QDs. Wang et al. prepared SnO2 mesoporous films via the screen-printing method as a photoanode and deposited CdS/CdSe and PbS/CdSe QDs, respectively. The results demonstrated that the PCE of QDSCs based on CdS/CdSe was slightly lower than that based on TiO2. When the QDSCs were assembled with PbS/CdS QDs, the PCE was better than that of the TiO2 photoanode. Besides, as a typical p-type semiconductor material, NiO-based photoanode has also been utilized in CuInSxSe2−x p-type sensitized solar cells and a PCE of 1.25% was obtained.
Concerning semiconductor oxide photoanode films, the abovementioned optimization strategies possess their own merits. Particularly, by constructing a hierarchical branched structure on the photoanode, a semiconductor (such as TiO2 or ZnO) can not only provide a large specific surface area to increase the loading of QDs, but also boost the scattering effect for capturing incident photons. Meanwhile, the branches on the photoanode can act as lanes for electron transfer from QDs to the semiconductor substrate, increasing the efficiency of electron migration in solar cells. However, along with the large surface area, some surface defects and the interconnections between adjacent nanoparticles would become recombination centers in the photoanode. Therefore, the structure of the semiconductor anode should be carefully chosen to balance the light-harvesting efficiency and electron-transfer efficiency. Additionally, surface modification strategies are regarded as an alternative approach to address these issues and improve the resulting device performance (Table 2). To make a further breakthrough in QDSCs, it is necessary to rationally design novel photoanode architectures with comprehensive consideration of the above optimization strategies.

To design a well-performing QDSC, an essential standard comes in the form of uniform and dense coverage of the QD sensitizers on an oxide substrate, which is dominated by the QD deposition approach. In general, the QD self-assembly deposition has been divided into two major deposition approaches, as illustrated in Fig. 8, designated as the direct growth of QDs and post-synthesis assembly. The direct growth route of QDs means that the QDs are directly grown on the TiO2 mesoporous film in situ, mainly including chemical bath deposition (CBD), successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), etc. The ex situ deposition method of QDs involves their pre-synthesis before their deposition, including direct adsorption, electrophoretic deposition (EPD), and linker-assisted assembly (LAA).

At the initial stage of development in QDSCs, the in situ deposition method of QD-sensitized photoanode films was recognized as a high-efficiency deposition method. In particular, high-density coverage of QDs can be obtained by simply tailoring the concentration of the precursor, reaction temperature and time. Based on this method, Cao et al. deposited Mn:CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2 with the CBD method and finally obtained a PCE of 6.33%. The introduction of Mn2+ not only enhances the absorption, but also increases the conduction band of CdSe QDs. Wang et al. achieved a higher PCE of 7.11% by incorporating CBD and SILAR process to assemble CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized anode film. In spite of this, there are still some shortcomings for the in situ deposition method, such as high surface deficiency, low surface coverage rate, uneven particle size distribution and uncontrollable morphology of QDs. Moreover, for some core/shell QDs, the in situ deposition method can hardly offer a dense shell on core materials, leading to undesirable charge recombination. To overcome the barriers, scientists have developed the ex situ deposition approach, including the EPD and ligand-induced self-assembled methods. For the EPD method, the pre-synthesized QDs are deposited directly on the semiconductor films with a driving force provided by an external electric field. Benefiting from the uniform size and shape of the pre-synthesized QDs, a very high-quality sensitized film with high loading amount has been achieved. For example, Kuang et al. deposited CdS/CdSe QDs on hierarchical TiO2 microspheres through EPD, and an increased Jsc value as well as a PCE of 4.81% was achieved. Nevertheless, to date, QDSCs with the record PCEs are not created by the EPD method, which may be attributed to the insulator organic ligands present between QDs and matrix, leading to an increased electron transfer hindrance.
To the best of our knowledge, the most effective deposition route is the capping ligand-induced self-assembly method. By using a short-carbon-chain bifunctional linker molecule, such as MPA, TGA, and so on, the pre-synthesized QDs can be tightly immobilized onto the semiconductor TiO2. A covalent bond will be formed between Cd2+ and thiol group (–SH), and the terminal group is hydrophilic carboxyl (–COO−), which provide good water solubility and electronegativity for QDs. Moreover, the strong affinity between hydrophilic carboxyl (–COO−) and Ti4+ (or Zn2+) will be favorable for the formation of a monolayer of QDs on oxidized substrates. Performance of QDSC devices mainly depends on the interplay between charge excitation from sensitizer and injection into the metal oxide matrix, thereby chemical construction of the ligand-linker molecules has to be rationally designed. Typically, Zhong et al. fabricated the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 film via the ex situ ligand exchange route with MPA, which demonstrated an efficient deposition route (within 2 h, and a high loading amount of 34% coverage). Afterwards, various ligand linker molecules were investigated and optimized in terms of the electron injection efficiency from the QD sensitizers to the TiO2 semiconductor nanocrystals. Three kinds of small bifunctional linker molecule, MPA, TGA, and Cys, were selected for analysis in the CdSe-based solar cells. From the results of transient grating measurements, TGA-capped CdSe QDs exhibited higher electron injection efficiency than those of MPA- and Cys-capped CdSe, which demonstrated the electron injection yield varies with the chain length of the ligand linker. The ligand linkers have a vital effect on the rate of interfacial electron transfer from QDs to TiO2. Zhang et al. adopted arene-substituted (ortho, meta, and para) bifunctional linkers with single or double aromatic rings to bridge CdSe QDs to TiO2 and adjust the interfacial electron transfer rate. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4MBA) shows a higher kET value and better interfacial coupling than other aromatic linkers.
Versatile deposition approaches, both direct growth and post-synthesis assembly techniques, have been developed to tether a QD sensitizer onto an oxide mesoporous film electrode (Table 3). Diverse deposition methods in fabricating QDSCs have their own advantages and limitations. The in situ deposition method can offer the direct electronic coupling between QDs and semiconductor, whereas the ex situ assembly process can hinder the surface trap sites through adjusting expediently the shape and size of QD sensitizers. Although the highest PCE of over 12% has been reached through the ex situ linker-assisted self-assembly method, the presence of linker molecules may hamper the effective charge transportation and prejudice the performance improvement of solar cells. Therefore, we should select the appropriate deposition method in terms of the specified investigation. However, comparing abovementioned deposition methods, we conclude that capping ligand-induced self-assembly remains a better choice. On the one hand, oil-phase synthesis techniques provide high-quality colloidal QDs with minimal trap defects; on the other hand, taking advantage of the ligand exchange technique, QDs can be easily transferred from oil into water maintaining their initial morphology (shape and size). This facile method has also been successfully utilized for various kinds of QDs achieving record PCEs. Additionally, a combination of both linked QDs and CBD (or SILAR) would also be a promising alternative approach. By growing other QDs on the photoanode in situ using CBD (or SILAR) method, uncovered photoanode near the linked QDs can be further loaded. High loading amount of QDs with dense coverage of QDs on the photoanode would be realized.

Understanding and clarifying the charge transfer processes of sensitized solar cells is decisive for harnessing the electrical output efficiently. The excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) of QDs are injected rapidly into the CB of TiO2 nanocrystalline films, followed by transportation to the collecting conducting substrate (commonly FTO). Simultaneously, holes left in the valence band (VB) of QDs are reduced by redox couple in the electrolyte, and the oxidized species of redox couple are simultaneously regenerated at the CEs. However, several recombination paths together with these favorable processes reduce the photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 9, the charge recombination process of QDSCs mainly takes place at the interfaces of TiO2/QDs/electrolyte and inside QDs, consisting of the following four major recombination paths: path 1 represents the internal and surface charge recombination of QDs themselves, path 2 represents the back transfer of electrons in the TiO2 to QDs at TiO2/QDs interface, path 3 represents the excited electron recombination from QDs with oxidizing species in the electrolyte and at QD/electrolyte interface, and path 4 represents the direct electron loss from TiO2 to the electrolyte at TiO2/electrolyte interface. Among them, paths 1, 2, and 3 are the main internal recombination processes in QDSCs and directly related with QDs, the surface trap states within QDs act as the recombination centers and are the potential contribution in the recombination paths. Meanwhile, because of the low transport rate of excited holes, the accumulation of holes in QDs would lead to the oxidative degradation of QDs or fast recombination with the excited electrons in QDs. Therefore, both reducing the hole trap states inside the QDs and accelerating the hole transport can reduce the parasitic recombination and promote the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.

At present, many efficient methods have been used to suppress the charge recombination, for example by creating a barrier layer of insulating or wide band gap materials around the TiO2 surface. Earlier, Park et al. pre-deposited a layer of TiO2 film with a thickness of 30 nm on the surface of FTO electrode by the magnetron sputtering method and inhibited the back-passing of electrons on the surface of FTO. In addition, Zhong et al. pretreated the surface of FTO electrode in a TiCl4 solution and obtained a PCE of 5.53% based on CdSe QDSCs due to the passivation effect between FTO glass and TiO2 mesoporous film. Chou et al. deposited NH4F aqueous solution on the surface of TiO2 mesoporous film as the passivation layer, and eventually obtained a PCE of 2.51% based on CdSe QDSCs, which was increased by 62% comparing to that without treatment. Subsequently, Mora-Seró et al. investigated the passivation mechanism of TiO2 film via fluorine ion surface treatment, and experimental results demonstrated that fluorine ion treatment could lead to charge collection centers to collect directionally the outer charge and inhibit the charge recombination due to the large electronegativity. Furthermore, Zhong et al. introduced varieties of metal ions on the surface of TiO2 films, such as alkaline earth-metal ions, transition-metal ions and heavy-metal ions. Among alkaline earth-metal ions, QDSCs based on Mg2+ treatment exhibited the best PCE of up to 9.73%, which benefited from the thin MgO passivation layer on the surface of TiO2 films. To date, various wide band-gap sulfide materials such as ZnS, ZnSe, and CdS have been widely used to surface-modify TiO2 photoanode films in order to control the charge transport and suppress the surface recombination. For example, ZnS surface passivation via the SILAR method can hinder charge recombination between QDs and TiO2 surface. In addition, ZnS shell also can increase the rate of electron transfer. Finally, the dual advantages of ZnS surface layer make it one of the most efficient surface passivation strategies for enhancing the performance of QDSCs. As shown in Fig. 10a and b, Ko et al. wrapped ZnS layers on the surface of CuInSe2 with different thickness via the SILAR process and controlled the ZnS layer thickness through adjusting the ion adsorption deposition time. Finally the highest PCE of 8.10% was obtained and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) result manifested that the ZnS surface treatment could efficiently suppress the charge recombination at the interface between electrolyte and QDs. Besides, Cao et al. deigned a ZnSe/ZnS passivation layer on the surface of CdS0.12Se0.88 alloyed QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and finally boosted the PCE to 6.14%, especially Voc and Jsc, which benefited from the light absorption enhancement and optical bandgap variation with the control of molar ratio of Zn/Cd.
Similarly to ZnS, other thin oxide materials such as SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2 and Al2O3 were used to suppress the charge recombination at the interface between electrolyte and QDs. For example, Zaban et al. firstly adopted MgO thin layer formed on the surface of TiO2 and QDs together, with the photoanode coated with MgO having a good effect on charge recombination suppression. Similarly, Bent et al. deposited Al2O3 passivation layer on the surface of CdS by the atomic layer deposition technique and assembled into solid-state QDSCs. The results showed that the Voc and PCE were significantly improved with the Al2O3 passivation layer. As shown in Fig. 11, Zhong et al. successively deposited ZnS and SiO2 high-barrier passivation layer on the surface of QD-sensitized photoanodes by SILAR and sol–gel techniques. According to the DFT calculation, after depositing ZnS and ZnS/SiO2 on the surface of the anode, the proportion of electron density on the outermost atomic shell decreased by 2 and 3 orders of magnitude respectively. The interface charge recombination between photoanode and electrolyte decreased corresponding to the reduction in electron density. The synergistic ZnS/SiO2 passivation treatment could suppress the charge recombination at the interface of photoanode/electrolyte, and improve the overall performance of QDSCs. The J–V test results demonstrated that the Voc of the CdSeTe QDSCs with ZnS/SiO2 double passivation layer was increased by 180 mV comparing to these without treatment, and the average PCEs increased from 2.53% to 8.37%. Zhong et al. further wrapped TiO2 and QDs with amorphous titanium dioxide (am-TiO2) via hydrolysis of TiCl4 in solution. By controlling the thickness of the am-TiO2 passivation layer, the CdSexTe1−x based QDSCs ultimately achieved the highest PCE of 9.28% and certified PCE of 9.01%, which was a new record for PCEs at that time.
From a systematic analysis of various surface passivation strategies for suppression of the charge recombination, the most efficient and universal method is to directly deposit ZnS layers atop sensitized photoanode by the SILAR method. By the interposition of an intermediate layer such as ZnS, the recombination can be significantly reduced. Compared with other passivation layer materials, such as amorphous TiO2 and SiO2, ZnS exhibits a good compatibility with QD sensitizers. However, ZnS layers cannot inhibit all the recombination pathways. In these cases, an additional inorganic passivation layer can be introduced atop ZnS, such as amorphous TiO2 and SiO2, which can further prevent charge recombination. In the near future, other strategies to restrain the undesired recombination should be developed for specific applications.

Exploring ideal CEs has been a long ongoing effort in the development of QDSCs. As shown in Fig. 12, a CE (consisting of catalyst supported on conducting substrate) is used to collect electrons from an external circuit and transfer them to the electrolyte through catalytic reduction of oxidized species in the electrolyte. Consequently, the CE has a critical effect on all the photovoltaic parameters (including FF, Jsc, and Voc) of a cell device. The impact of CE on the performance of QDSCs is mainly derived from its conductivity and electro-catalytic activity toward electrolyte regeneration, which determines the over-potential and charge transfer resistance at CE/electrolyte interface as well as energy loss caused by electron transport, thereby having a significant impact on the FF of QDSCs. If the reduction rate of the electrolyte is slower than the regeneration rate of an electron–hole pair, the electrochemistry equilibrium will be broken and holes will be severely accumulated. Excessive hole accumulation could result in electron recombination as well as chemical corrosion of QDs, which have a negative effect on the photovoltaic performance. Thus, the CEs should have excellent catalytic performance which reduces the reaction energy barrier by catalyzing and accelerating the reduction rate of the electrolyte.

Excellent CEs should have effective electrical conductivity, high catalytic activity and high specific surface area. Besides, materials used as CEs should also have good stability, corrosion resistance, low cost, etc. At present, various types of CE materials have been studied and applied in QDSCs. Generally, the reported CEs for QDSCs can be roughly classified into five categories: metal-based, metallic compound-based, carbon derivative-based, polymer-based, and composite material-based electrodes. Recent typical research details of CE materials are summarized in Table 4.

Pt-based CEs are widely used in DSCs and show excellent catalytic activity towards the iodine electrolyte (I3−/I−). Regardless of the fact of similar structure and working principle, Pt-based CEs are unsuited for QDSCs due to the corrosion in polysulfide electrolyte. In order to enhance the catalytic performance of Pt-based CEs, the structure and surface of Pt materials could be modified. Kim et al. firstly passivated the surface of Pt-based CEs through covering with a thin Cu2S layer, which reduces the chemical adsorption and corrosion of polysulfide electrolyte. Dao et al. prepared transparent Au–Pt alloyed CEs on the surface of FTO by a dehydrating plasma reduction method, and such CdS/CdSe QDSCs demonstrated a PCE of 3.4%, higher than that of cells with Au CE (1.1%) and Pt CE (3.2%), which benefited from high conductivity and light transmission of the metal alloyed materials. However, these noble metal-based CEs have had a hindered development and have been gradually eliminated due to high price and poor catalytic activity.


Metallic compound-based CEs are usually semiconductors with high catalytic activity, and excellent corrosion resistance, and have drawn great attention as the most commonly used CEs in QDSCs. Thus, research has been devoted to investigating different kinds of metallic compounds and their applications in photovoltaic devices. Currently, diverse types of metallic compound-based CEs are being developed and applied in QDSCs. Metallic sulfide-based CEs, such as CuxS, PbS, CoS, NiS and others, are considered as optimal because of their high catalytic activity and corrosion resistance in polysulfide electrolytes. Among them, CuxS CEs are the most widely used in the field of QDSCs due to high catalytic activity and good conductivity. Generally, Cu2S CEs are vulcanized by directly soaking the brass foils in polysulfide electrolyte. Although this fabrication method is simple, the brass foils suffer from chemical corrosion in polysulfide electrolyte. Considering this problem, various promising preparation processes of CuxS have been exploited and optimized in CE catalysts for QDSCs. Zhong et al. prepared Cu2S films on FTO glass substrate (Cu2S/FTO) CE via electrodeposition of copper film followed by dipping into polysulfide solution. The nanoflake-like Cu2S film exhibited high catalytic activity in polysulfide redox couple electrolyte in CdSe-based QDSCs and led to a PCE of 5.21%, which was very close to that for the commonly used Cu2S/brass CE (5.41%) but with better stability. The ideal materials used as CEs of QDSCs should have high specific surface area to guarantee more catalytic active sites. Thus, researchers prepared CuxS-based CEs with various morphologies and structures, such as porous films, nanodisks, nanosheets, etc. As shown in Fig. 13, Hu et al. assembled hierarchically grown ITO@Cu2S nanowire arrays with conductive single-crystalline ITO cores and Cu2S nanocrystal shells as efficient QDSC CEs. These ITO@Cu2S nanowire arrays not only provided an efficient three-dimensional charge transport network but also allowed for the effective deposition of more Cu2S nanocrystals as active sites to catalyze the electrolyte reaction. Thus, this obtained CE exhibited a high Voc of 0.688 V and PCE of 6.12% due to reduced sheet and charge transfer resistance, below that of the conventional brass/Cu2S CE.

The CuxS-based CEs are regarded as effective materials in QDSCs, and play a vital role in the operation process to improve device performance via their excellent electro-catalytic activity at the interface of the CE and electrolyte. Previous reports have verified that increasing the electro-catalytic activity of CEs is a crucial factor and should be exploited to develop more efficient QDSCs. At the same time, CuS nanostructures have excellent optical properties, such as an obvious surface plasmonic resonance effect and optical transmission. Xu et al. fabricated full-spectrum operating QDSCs integrated with a dual-functional CuS nanostructure electrode with both plasmonic resonance absorption and electro-catalytic activity. The experimental results demonstrated that the obtained PCE value was enhanced under NIR light irradiation from the backside, which benefited from the plasmon-induced photo-thermal effect and interfacial energy transfer. Besides, Guo et al. designed highly transparent and conducting CuS nanosheet networks (Rs < 50 Ω sq−1 at 85% transmittance) as flexible CEs in QDSCs, as shown in Fig. 14, which finally yielded a PCE of 3.25%. Meanwhile, this new style of CE exhibited high flexibility and stability for future application in wearable electronic devices.
Other metal sulfides including PbS, CoS, and NiS have also been investigated in QDSCs. In particular, Lin et al. prepared photoactive PbS films as CEs via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) techniques, and achieved a PCE of 4.7% in CuInS2/CdS-based QDSCs, better than that using Pt and CuS films. Although PbS materials have a lower catalytic activity towards polysulfide electrolyte than CuS film, PbS film more efficiently absorbs visible and NIR light to compensate for the limitation of semiconductor oxide photoanode light absorption. As an essential class of chalcogenides, metallic selenides have also attracted enormous attention due to their distinctive electronic properties and conspicuous chemical behaviors.

Carbonaceous materials (including carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphite, carbon black, activated carbon, porous carbon, carbon composite materials etc.) have been utilized as effective catalyst candidates in CEs with a high comprehensive performance, due to low cost, high durability, and good electrical conductivity. As shown in Fig. 15, Yu et al. prepared a series of carbonaceous materials as CEs, such as ordered mesoporous carbon (OMPC), mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MCNFs), and hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HCMS). Compared to activated carbon materials, the three above-mentioned carbonaceous materials have larger specific surface area and more abundant hole structures. In particular, CdS/CdSe QDSC assembled with MCNFs as CEs achieved a PCE of 4.81% and much better than that with OMPC (4.36%) and HCMS (3.90%), which mainly benefited from the higher specific surface area and three-dimensional hole structure of carbon fibers. Meanwhile, Lin et al. prepared single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) as CEs of QDSCs. These CNT-based CEs not only possess larger specific surface area to provide more catalytic active sites, but also accelerate the electron transfer rate in the axial direction. Zhong et al. developed a three-dimensional mesoporous carbon-coated Ti mesh substrate (MC/Ti) as a CE, and achieved a certified record PCE of 11.16% due to the high catalytic activity of the robust carbon film with sub-millimeter thickness and three-dimensional electrical tunnels with excellent conductivity. This work paves the way for further performance improvement of QDSCs. Subsequently, a series of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon materials with different nitrogen contents were prepared by the traditional silica template method. Electrochemical measurements revealed that nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon with a nitrogen content of 8.58% exhibited the greatest catalytic activity in catalyzing the reduction of the polysulfide redox couple, and the corresponding QDSC device showed the best photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 12.23% under one full sun, which was a new PCE record for QDSCs.


Conducting polymers are also regarded as excellent alternatives as CEs due to their excellent conductivity and relatively large specific surface area. Firstly, Sun et al. prepared TiO2-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) CEs by addition of porous template materials and obtained a PCE of 1.56%. TiO2 additives could increase the porosity of PEDOT materials in order to accelerate the electrolyte diffusion. Besides, Yeh et al. deposited PEDOT, polythiophene (PT) and polypyrrole (PPy) onto ITO glass through an electrochemical polarization method. As-assembled CdS QDSCs exhibited a PCE of 1.33%. Overall, the performance of CEs based on conducting polymers is still lower than that of other types of CEs, but these CEs exhibited excellent feasibility and laid an important foundation for the development of flexible devices.


Currently, categories of materials used as CEs mainly include the above-mentioned metals, metallic compounds, carbon derivatives and polymers. However, these types may not possess all such characteristics as good conductivity, electrocatalytic activity and corrosion resistance towards polysulfide electrolyte. So composite materials as integrated CEs have been taken into consideration. Currently, such composite materials as CuS/Pt, Cu2S/RGO, CuS/CoS, NiS/PbS, PbS/carbon black, and CuInS2/carbon have been studied. As shown in Fig. 16, four kinds of typical CEs for assembled QDSCs have been developed. For example, Kamat et al. fabricated composite CEs through mixing graphene oxide with CuS. Graphene oxide is a substrate that accelerates charge transport and improves the catalytic property of CuS. Finally, the performance, especially FF, of the assembled QDSCs using the optimal graphene oxide/CuS composite CEs is obviously enhanced compared to Pt CEs. Lee et al. introduced TiN nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanotube/graphene oxide hybrid structure which exhibited high surface roughness and good metal contact interface. Excellent catalytic activity of the composite CEs from EIS characterization results clarified the synergistic effect of large special surface area in carbon nanotube/graphene oxide hybrid structure with TiN nanoparticles having enough catalytic active sites. Meanwhile, CuZnSnSe or CuZnSnS nanoparticles respectively combined with carbon nanotubes and MoS2 can be also used as CEs with excellent catalytic property.

Overall, CEs have attracted much attention and provided vital breakthroughs in the research field of QDSCs. Various CEs for QDSCs each possess their own properties and applicable aspects. For example, for Au and Pt metal-based CEs, they suffer from severe corrosion issues in polysulfide electrolyte. To address this shortcoming, different metal sulfides were vigorously investigated as CE materials such as CuxS, CoS, PbS, etc. Meanwhile, various kinds of carbon derivatives such as carbon nanofibers, carbon foam, and mesoporous carbon were also utilized as CEs materials, and exhibiting excellent properties in QDSCs. Besides, due to the flexibility of conducting polymers, they would be promising candidates for flexible devices, although current PCEs of QDSCs based on conducting polymers still lag behind those of other solid-state or liquid-state QDSCs. Currently, in terms of advantages of different CE materials (such as high conductivity, catalytic activity of metal chalcogenides, large surface area of carbon materials, etc.), composite hybrid nanostructured materials with versatile functions are regarded as the most promising candidates as CEs for high-performance QDSCs.

As crucial components in QDSCs, redox electrolytes are mainly responsible for the inner charge transport between electrodes and continuously regenerate the QD sensitizers and themselves according to the operational principle. The electrolyte medium has a vital effect on the light-to-electric conversion efficiency and long-term stability of the devices. More importantly, the electrolyte significantly influences the efficiency of a QDSC device through changing the parameters, namely, Jsc, Voc, and FF. For instance, the Voc is affected by the redox potential of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the Jsc and FF values are influenced by the charge transport and diffusion of the redox couple components and the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The ideal electrolytes for QDSCs require several characteristics, as follows (and shown in Fig. 17). (1) The electrolytes should have suitable redox potential, well matching with the selected QDs, which guarantees the charge injection and regeneration of QDs and themselves rapidly. (2) The electrolytes provide fast diffusion of charge carriers and good interfacial contact with the mesoporous TiO2 films and CEs. (3) The electrolytes should have long-term chemical stability and have little influence on the QDs, such as desorption and degradation of sensitized QDs. (4) The electrolytes should have a small optical absorption in the visible region. In order to improve the performance and stability of QDSCs, research is mainly focused on design and development of excellent redox couples, modification of functional additives, and electrolyte gelation to enhance the stability of devices.

The earliest used iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple can cause the quick decomposition of QDs and reduce performance and stability. Nowadays, the inorganic polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple in aqueous solution is commonly used in QDSCs because this electrolyte medium can stabilize QDs and offer an acceptable photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. Polysulfide electrolyte was firstly studied and optimized systematically by Lee et al. who obtained a PCE of 1.15% in CdS QDSCs. Further exploration of the ionic conducting mechanism in polysulfide electrolyte resulted in increased device performance. Nevertheless, due to the relatively high redox potential of polysulfide electrolyte, Voc values obtained in QDSCs are substantially lower than those in DSCs (up to 1.0 eV), which has restricted the efficiency improvement. Therefore, further improvement, in particular a higher Voc, can be achieved by employing a novel electrolyte with low redox potential. Some efforts have been made to search for new alternative redox couples with relatively low redox potential, such as cobalt and iron complexes (Co2+/Co3+), Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− and organic redox couples. Tachibana et al. reported the optimized Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− (0.01/0.2 M) aqueous electrolyte and achieved the highest Voc up to 0.8 V due to small redox potential difference with TiO2 conduction band edge. Sun et al. designed the new modified polysulfide redox couple [(CH3)4N]2S−/[(CH3)4N]2Sn− and obtained the highest FF up to 0.89 and the PCE of 3.2% in CdS QDSCs.
Use of additives is a simple and efficient method to promote the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. Experimental results clarify that small amounts of additives could modify the redox couple potential, the TiO2 surface states, and recombination kinetics. Series of active additives such as KCl, 4-tert-butylpyridine, deoxycholic acid, and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) have been introduced into the electrolyte, which improved QDSCs through suppression of charge recombination and adjusting the Fermi level of TiO2. Bisquert et al. demonstrated the robust S2−/Sn2− electrolyte with pyrrolidinium ionic liquid, and obtained a PCE of 1.86% for CdSe QDSCs with good stability over 200 h. However, the nucleophilic ability of N-containing species may be suppressed in the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte system. Meanwhile, such additives may interact strongly with water molecules through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hence, the above-mentioned additives basically have invalid effects on the abundant protic aqueous electrolytes. Hence, nonionic polymer-based additives are considered as efficient additives for QDSCs due to good stability and solubility in alkaline solutions. Recently, Zhong's group reported modified polysulfide electrolyte with addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) to suppress undesired charge recombination, thus improving Voc and PCE of QDSCs. Experimental results revealed that the PEG or PVP polymer molecules were able to strongly absorb onto the surface of nanoparticles and retard the unwanted charge recombination in the interface layers between the photoanode and electrolyte. Besides the nonionic polymer additives, water-compatible inorganic compounds appear to be the suitable alternatives. As shown in Fig. 18, Meng et al. provided a convenient method to modify polysulfide with fumed SiO2 nanoparticle additives, mainly restraining the interfacial recombination. CdSexTe1−x QDSCs based on SiO2-modified electrolytes exhibited higher electron collection efficiency and longer electron lifetimes. Furthermore, Zhong et al. introduced tetraethyl orthosilicate, as the precursor to SiO2, into polysulfide electrolyte and enhanced the photovoltaic performance from 11.75% to 12.34% mainly due to improvement in Voc and Jsc values.
Based on the above-mentioned modified liquid electrolytes, the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs has been sufficiently improved. However, liquid polysulfide electrolytes cause technical problems, such as leakage and volatilization, corrosion of CEs, and ineffective encapsulation for long-time stability. Thus, development of quasi-solid-state electrolytes has become a research hotspot and appeared to solve these problems. For example, Meng et al. firstly incorporated polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel to prepare quasi-solid state polysulfide electrolyte into QDSCs and obtained a PCE of 4% for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs. Such gel polyelectrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity at room temperature up to 0.093 S cm−1, and also hinders the interfacial recombination at TiO2/electrolyte interface. Meng et al. prepared a gel electrolyte with natural polysaccharide Konjac glucomannan via simple in situ preparation process. Finally, QDSCs with such gel electrolyte demonstrated a PCE of 4.0% and excellent stability compared to liquid-based QDSCs. Kuang et al. fabricated a quasi-solid-state electrolyte for QDSCs by using dextran as gelator. This hydrogel electrolyte must be kept in a liquid state at about 90 °C for good penetration into mesoporous photoanode followed by cooling into the quasi-solid state. Apart from the above gel electrolyte, low molecular weight polymer-based gels such as polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether and polyethylene oxide have been widely applied to form quasi-solid-state electrolytes. Though the above-mentioned electrolytes could improve the stability of devices, PCE values usually are lower than when using liquid electrolyte due to high electric resistance between polymer matrix and two electrodes. Tang et al. fabricated graphene-impregnated PAAm gel electrolytes to assemble quasi-solid-state QDSCs, and gained enhanced PCEs, which mainly benefited from three-dimensional micropores and osmotic pressure in such complex electrolytes. Lin et al. reported high-efficiency quasi-solid-state DSCs and QDSCs employing functionalized NH2-rich silica nanoparticles. Such quasi-solid-state electrolyte not only shifted negatively the TiO2 conduction band edge, but also improved ion transport through inhibiting the charge recombination. Finally, the best PCE of 7.11% for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSCs was improved remarkably by 34.9% benefiting from the enhancement of Jsc and Voc values. Besides, Yang et al. introduced series of conducting gel electrolytes composed of PAAm matrix and conductive polymers polyaniline, PPy or PT. Here, PCEs were better than for the standard PAAm gel electrolyte because of excellent electrical conduction and three-dimensional framework of the gel electrolyte. Zhong et al. successfully prepared gelatinous polysulfide electrolyte by adding the hydrophilic polymer sodium polyacrylate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt, and finally achieved nearly the same PCE value as that of liquid-junction QDSCs but better stability.
Although the electrolyte gelation strategy can suppress the volatilization and leakage of liquid electrolytes, stability of devices based on gel electrolytes is still unsatisfactory when taking account of forthcoming commercial application. In view of this problem, several solid-state hole transport materials (HTMs) have been introduced into QDSCs to replace the liquid or quasi-solid electrolytes, including organic HTMs and inorganic TMs, such as PEDOT, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), CuI, and CuSCN. Campiña et al. first fabricated solid-state CdSe QDSCs using 3,3′-didodecylquaterthiophene as the hole conductor, and obtained a PCE of 0.34% under one standard sunlight illumination. Although the photovoltaic performance was low, the results indicated that it will be feasible to build a full solid-state structure for QDSCs. Song et al. employed P3HT as a HTM and fabricated solid-state CdS QDSCs, with a PCE of 1.42% under one standard sunlight condition. Moreover, Konstantatos et al. fabricated eco-friendly CuInS2-based solid-state QDSCs using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, and the best PCE of 1.16% was achieved through optimizing heterojunction architecture between CuInS2 and TiO2. Lévy-Clément et al. firstly reported the new-concept ZnO/CdSe/CuSCN structure and exhibited a PCE of over 2%. Despite the lower efficiency of QDSCs based on solid-state HTMs as compared to liquid- and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, further research is crucial for large-scale production and long-term utilization.
In this section, various types of electrolytes for QDSCs have been discussed and summarized (Table 5). Properties of electrolytes are directly related to the PCEs and stability of QDSCs. Currently, polysulfide redox couples remain a preferred choice for QDSCs owing to their moderate redox potential and relative stability towards QDs. Although new redox couples with low redox potential such as Co2+/Co3+ have been explored, QDs still suffer severe chemical corrosion and the regeneration of electrolyte is very slow. These issues have not been well addressed so far, which limit their further application in QDSCs. Besides, for the purpose of altering the electrochemical properties of an electrolyte, a simple approach to add specific additives into the electrolyte can be utilized. From the point of view of long-term development in QDSCs, optimization of solid-state electrolytes or high-hole-mobility HTMs is expected to be a promising direction to solve the durability issue.

Significant efforts have been made in the development of QDSCs with PCEs increased from 1% to ∼12% in the past few years. We attribute this success to the progress in optimization of every component of QDSC devices. However, the present PCE level for QDSCs is still far from the theoretical value of 44%, and simultaneously inferior to those of the novel perovskite solar cells (more than 20%). Thus, challenges still remain in seeking to achieve a comprehensive improvement of QDSC devices. As the “Holy Grail” in QDSCs, PCE enhancement plays a decisive role in their successful industrial application. The PCE value of a photovoltaic device is determined by the Jsc, Voc, and FF values. Among them, the Jsc value mainly hinges on the light-harvesting capacity of sensitizers and the injection rate of photo-generated charges; Voc is mainly governed by the relative position between Fermi level of sensitized photoanode and the redox potential of electrolyte as well as the charge recombination; and FF value is mainly influenced by the catalytic activity of CEs in the device system. Therefore, the essential problem is to further optimize every component in a device and clarify synergistic effects between them. To realize further breakthroughs, it is still of great necessity to improve the absorption of solar spectral energy, enhance exciton generation and transportation, and further decrease the recombination losses at different interfaces of the whole device.

In this review, we put forward recent achievements in PCE enhancement of QDSCs in accordance with the optimization strategies for the device components. In particular, new QD sensitizers with strong light-harvesting capacity, insulating semiconductor oxide overlayer as tunneling barrier, interface engineering in restraining charge recombination, CEs with high catalytic activity, and modified electrolyte with enhanced stability should be further investigated by various strategies. In terms of the above-summarized strategies from each aspect, possible research directions in the field of high-efficiency QDSCs may deserve great attention in the near future:
(i) Design of new superior QD sensitizers possessing both wider absorption range and stronger light-harvesting capacity. Accordingly, various appropriate construction strategies such as alloying, core–shell, doping, co-sensitizing etc. to develop composite QD absorbers should be continued to be carried out in QDSCs. Especially, the low-toxicity environment-friendly QD sensitizers such as CuInS2 or CuInSe2 are considered as promising options for light absorbers. Besides, two-dimensional co-sensitized nanomaterials, such as CdSe nanoplatelets, are wise choices owing to their strong light absorption and possibility of efficient charge transfer.
(ii) Fabrication of QD-loaded metal oxide film membranes with high surface area, light-scattering effect, and transport rate. For example, bifunctional hybrid hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure with high surface area, high light scattering effect and excellent electron transport rate was synthesized as an excellent route to improve the performance, in terms of boosting the charge transport rate and light-harvesting efficiency. The nanostructure parameters such as density, distribution, and arrangement in the film membranes should be also explored.
(iii) Substantial enhancement of QD loading on TiO2 film. More QDs covering the TiO2 film can promote better light-harvesting efficiency.
(iv) Precise interface passivating strategies towards suppressing charge recombination. Currently, surface modification strategies through SILAR deposition or surface in situ hydrolysis have been widely used to passivate the interfaces and suppress the charge combination processes. However, these strategies are usually incomplete and uncontrollable at interfaces. Therefore, atomic layer deposition can control the surface thickness precisely. In addition, it is worth considering that an excess surface passivation layer may also reduce the electron–hole transport rate.
(v) Exploitation of CEs with higher catalytic activity and better stability. In QDSCs, the charge transport rate between CE and polysulfide electrolyte can significantly affect the device performance. Therefore, development of novel CE materials with high catalytic activity is vital to improve the performance of QDSCs. Three-dimensional carbonaceous materials with mesh or spongy porous substrate such as mesoporous carbon, metal organic framework derivatives and hybrid carbon nanotube etc. will be a good choice as CEs, owing to their high catalytic activity, high electronic conductivity, low cost, and good stability.
(vi) Innovation towards new kinds of modified electrolyte and further all-solid-state HTMs. Currently, exploration of electrolytes in QDSCs is lagging behind that of photoanodes and CEs, which becomes a bottleneck for the further development of QDSCs. It is essential to find a novel type of redox electrolyte including transition metal ion complexes (such as Co2+/Co3+, Cu+/Cu2+, Fe2+/Fe3+, etc.). Besides, solid-state HTMs such as CuSCN, CuI and other p-type inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high-stability and excellent flexible devices.
Overall, this review systematically summarizes the efficient strategies from six corresponding aspects, and is well-organized and provides comprehensive and valuable guidance for the achievement of high-performance QDSCs. Meanwhile, it also provides inspiration and reference for improving the performance of other types of solar cells. Finally, through unremitting efforts, it is expected that high PCEs of 15% and excellent stability with industrial appeal can be realized by virtue of the above effective strategies in the near future.
