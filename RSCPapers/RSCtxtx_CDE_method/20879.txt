Graphene oxide (GO) has been extensively applied as an alternative hole transport layer (HTL) of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) with the function of selectively transporting holes and blocking electrons, but suffers from low electrical conductivity. Herein, using phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) dissolved in methanol as a precursor, we successfully modified GO via noncovalent phosphorylation for the first time, which showed improved hole transport in BHJ-PSCs compared to the pristine GO. As a result, BHJ-PSC devices based on noncovalently phosphorylated GO (P-GO) HTL show dramatically higher power conversion efficiencies (7.90%, 6.59%, 3.85% for PTB7:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM, P3HT:PC61BM, respectively) than those of the corresponding control devices based on the pristine GO HTL (6.28%, 5.07%, 2.78%), which are comparable to those of devices based on the most widely used HTL—poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) represent a promising renewable energy source and have been attracting ever-growing attention during the past two decades due to their advantages of low-cost, light-weight, flexibility, and feasibility of roll-to-roll large area processing. Recent advances in developing not only novel photoactive materials including conjugated polymer donors and fullerene/non-fullerene acceptors but also interfacial materials enable a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 13%. For the most popular and efficient architecture of PSCs based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ), interfacial layers sandwiched between the photoactive layer and electrode play important roles on facilitating charge collection and extraction via inducing interfacial charge redistribution, geometry modifications, and/or chemical reactions, and are thus critical to obtain high-performance PSCs. In particular, for the conventional-structure BHJ-PSC devices, a hole transport layer (HTL) is typically incorporated between the photoactive layer and the ITO anode with the aim of selectively transporting holes and blocking electrons. For this purpose, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been the most widely used HTL for conventional PSCs since the late 1990s due to its high optical transparency, high work function and solution-processability. However, PEDOT:PSS is acidic, hygroscopic and sensitive to oxygen exposure, hampering its practical applications in PSC devices. Thus, it is highly desired to develop alternative solution-processable HTL.

Graphene as a single-layer graphite composed of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms is a representative two-dimensional nanomaterial with high carrier mobility and electrical conductivity as well as good optical transparency, and has been widely applied in PSCs as transparent electrodes, acceptors in photoactive layers or interfacial materials. Particularly, graphene oxide (GO) as functionalized graphene with carboxyl, epoxy and hydroxyl groups has improved dispersity in aqueous alcohol solvents and higher work function than pristine graphene, rendering its solution-processability and consequently extensive applications as alternative HTL in PSC devices. Nevertheless, the attachment of oxygen-containing functional groups leads to the transformation of sp2- to sp3-carbon atoms, decreasing dramatically the electrical conductivity of GO, and this results in a high internal resistance of PSC device. To improve the hole transport property of GO, further modification of GO is needed, including partial reduction, thermal annealing, and chemical functionalizations. For the latter approach, so far most reports focused on covalent functionalizations, such as sulfonation, chlorination, trifluoromethylation and siliconization. However, rare studies on improving hole transport property of GO via noncovalent functionalization has been reported, which was fulfilled by either blending another functional material with GO or spin-coating an additional layer atop of GO film, thus being more facile than covalent functionalization.
Herein, we report for the first time noncovalent phosphorylation of GO via a P2O5 precursor, affording improved hole transport in BHJ-PSC devices. Upon spin-coating the as-formed phosphate ester [(CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x] (x = 1–3) atop of GO film, the phosphorylated GO (P-GO) HTL contributes to obvious efficiency enhancements of BHJ-PSC devices relative to those based on the pristine GO. The mechanism responsible for the improved hole transport of P-GO HTL is revealed on the basis of a series of spectroscopic, morphological and device characterizations.

Recently covalently phosphorylated GO has been reported, which was typically prepared via multi-step organic synthesis. Alternatively, in our present work we managed to prepare noncovalently phosphorylated GO via a facile spin-coating technique so as to avoid the complicated organic synthesis. A GO film was first prepared by spin-coating an aqueous GO dispersion onto ITO substrate, followed by spin-coating a solution of P2O5 dissolved in methanol (see Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, phosphate ester [(CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x] (x = 1–3) can facilely form in situ from the precursor of P2O5 dissolved in methanol, as confirmed by both mass spectrometry (see ESI Fig. S1) and FTIR spectroscopic characterizations. According to the FTIR spectrum of P2O5 dissolved in methanol solution (Fig. 1b, red line), the vibrational peaks at 1460, 2858 and 2962 cm−1 correspond to the stretching modes of C–H bond, and the peak at 1050 and 1192 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching mode of C–O–P bond. Furthermore, the peak at 3425 cm−1 is assigned to the vibrations of the hydroxyl (–OH) group. Except the C–H and C–O–P signals, other characteristic vibrational signals are also observed in the FTIR spectrum of H3PO4 (Fig. 1b, black line), suggesting the existence of PO and P–OH groups. Mass spectrometric analysis of the solution of P2O5 dissolved in methanol reveals the existence of several different forms of phosphate ester, namely (CH3O)PO(OH)2, (CH3O)2PO(OH) and (CH3O)3PO. These results suggest the facile formation of phosphate ester [(CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x] (x = 1–3) from the precursor of P2O5 dissolved in methanol, although the formation of its polymerized compounds seems also possible.

Upon spin-coating the as-formed [(CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x] onto a GO layer, noncovalently phosphorylated GO (abbreviated as P-GO) film can be readily prepared. In order to fulfill effective hole transport of P-GO film in PSC device, we first optimized the thickness of P-GO film by controlling the initial concentration of P2O5 dissolved in methanol solution and the spin-coating speed according to its HTL performance in PSC devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) active layer, and the optimized concentration of P2O5 dissolved in methanol solution is 0.2 mg mL−1 with the optimized spin-coating speed being 2000 rpm (see ESI Fig. S2, S3, and Tables S1, S2). Under this condition, the thickness of P-GO film is about 2.5 nm as determined by atomic force microscopic (AFM) analysis (see the inset of Fig. 1d), which is slightly larger than that of single GO film (∼2.0 nm, see the inset of Fig. 1c) fabricated as a control film (see ESI Fig. S4 and Table S3 for optimization of its thickness by controlling the spin-coating speed). Deposition of P-GO or GO film onto ITO hardly affects the transmittance of ITO substrate (see ESI Fig. S6), thus fulfilling the prerequisite for application of P-GO as a HTL of PSC device.
We then applied the P-GO film as a HTL of PSC devices based on three representative active layer systems, including polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene-co-benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM), poly(4,8-bis-alkyloxybenzo(l,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(alkyl thieno(3,4-b)thiophene-2-carboxylate)-2,6-diyl) (PBDTTT-C):PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM. Fig. 2a illustrates the structure of ITO/P-GO/active layer/Ca/Al BHJ-PSC devices fabricated in glove box, and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2b–d, which include also those of control devices based on pristine GO or PEDOT:PSS HTL, and the measured parameters (short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), FF (fill factor), PCE, series resistance (Rs)) are summarized in Table 1. The control PTB7:PC71BM device based on PEDOT:PSS HTL (device A) shows a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 15.72 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.1%, and an average PCE of 7.31% (the best PCE is 7.52%). When PEDOT:PSS was substituted by pristine GO HTL (device B), the average PSC decreases obviously to 6.03% based on a Voc of 0.65 V, a Jsc of 15.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.0%. Similar phenomena were observed for devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layers, and PCE decrease is attributed mainly to the drops of both Voc and FF (see Table 1). These results are consistent with those reported in literatures, confirming the insufficient hole transport ability of pristine GO due to its low work function. On the other hand, when (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x itself was applied as HTL in the P3HT:PC61BM-based devices, the PCE of (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x-based device is only 0.60% (see ESI Fig. S5 and Table S4), which is much lower than those of the devices based on PEDOT:PSS and GO HTLs, indicating (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x is much less effective in transporting holes as HTL. Upon using P-GO HTL (device C), the average PCE of PTB7:PC71BM device reaches 7.85% calculated from a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 16.12 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.4%. Noteworthy, such a PCE of 7.85% for the device based on P-GO HTL is improved by ∼30.2% relative to that of device based on pristine GO HTL, and even surpasses that of PEDOT:PSS-based device (see Table 1), indicating the superior hole transport property of P-GO. Furthermore, the applicability of P-GO HTL in poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):PC71BM active layer system was also investigated, and the same trends were observed (see ESI Fig. S7 and Table S5), confirming the universality of P-GO HTL in devices based on versatile active layer systems.

The obvious PCE enhancement of P-GO-based device relative to that based on pristine GO HTL is also found for devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layers, confirming the effectiveness of P-GO HTL. Such a PCE enhancement of P-GO-based device originates primarily from the simultaneous increases of both Voc and FF for all three active layer systems (see ESI Fig. S8), whereas Jsc exhibits only negligible increases (<5%) for PTB7:PC71BM and PBDTTT-C:PC71BM devices. The negligible change of Jsc for devices based different HTLs is confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements in ambient condition (Fig. 3a–c), indicating their comparable integrated Jsc values despite of the difference on the shape of EQE curve owing to the discrepancy on the transmittance spectra (see ESI Fig. S6).
We then measured the J–V curves of devices based on different HTLs and active layers in the dark, which can provide valuable information on the inherent electrical property of the BHJ-PSC device. According to the comparison of the dark J–V curves of the devices based on different HTLs shown in Fig. 3d–f, the leakage current in the reverse region of the devices based on P-GO HTL are quite close to those of the control devices based on PEDOT:PSS HTL, but much lower than those of the pristine GO-based devices. These results provide strong evidence that fewer leakage current pathways are generated and fewer interfacial traps suppress carrier recombination in the P-GO interlayer, accounting for the enhancement of FF (see Table 1).
The effects of phosphate ester modification on the film morphology, wettability and work function of GO were investigated so as to understand the reason for the simultaneous increases of Voc and FF. According to the comparison of the film morphologies of P-GO and pristine GO measured by AFM, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of P-GO and pristine GO films are 1.40 and 0.83 nm, respectively (see Fig. 1c and d). The higher RMS roughness of GO film may increase the specific surface area, and this is beneficial for the interfacial contact between the active layer and HTL. However, the increase of the RMS roughness of GO film upon phosphate ester modification may result in the increase of densities of trap sites and consequently the unfavorable trap-assisted recombinations detrimental for device performance, and further mechanistic studies are needed to address such an influence. Besides, upon phosphate ester modification, P-GO film shows a larger water contact angle (63.4°) than that of the pristine GO film (52.0°) (see ESI Fig. S9), suggesting the increase of the hydrophobicity of GO by phosphorylation. Since the active layer materials composed of conjugated polymer and PCBM are hydrophobic too, a higher affinity between P-GO and active layer is expected, beneficial for improved interfacial contact between the active layer and HTL.
Synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) was then used to probe the effect of phosphate ester modification on the work function of GO. According to the secondary electron cutoff regions presented in Fig. 4a, the measured work functions of ITO, ITO/PEDOT:PSS, ITO/GO and ITO/P-GO substrates are 4.64, 4.82, 4.24 and 4.70 eV, respectively (see ESI Table S6). Clearly, the work function of ITO/GO is much lower than that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS, thus apparently mismatching the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the donors (5.12–5.20 eV) (Fig. 4b), resulting in inferior PCE of GO HTL-based device relative to that of PEDOT:PSS-based one. Upon phosphate ester modification, the work function of ITO/P-GO increases to 4.70 eV, which is more close to that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (4.83 eV). Therefore, the work function of ITO/P-GO matches better the HOMO levels of the donors, benefiting the formation of an Ohmic contact between the active layer/HTL interface and consequently leading to the increase of the Voc value.
To understand the origin of the increased work function of GO induced by phosphate ester modification, we investigated the intermolecular interactions between phosphate ester and GO by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. According to the comparison of the XPS spectrum of P-GO with that of [(CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x] (x = 1–3) film deposited on Si substrate, the P 2p signal of (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x down-shifted from 133.1 to 132.4 eV for P-GO (see ESI Fig. S10), suggesting the change in the valence of phosphorus after spin-coating (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x onto GO surface. This can likely occur via electron transfer from GO to (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x. Thus, phosphate ester modification leads to a P-doping effect for GO, consequently inducing the increase of the work function of GO. Moreover, as revealed by Raman spectroscopic study, the characteristic G band peak of GO up-shifted by 8 cm−1 from 1601 cm−1 to 1609 cm−1 for P-GO (see ESI Fig. S11), suggesting charge transfer between phosphate ester and GO. This result is consistent with the supposed electron transfer from GO to (CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x deduced from XPS study.
Finally, the effect of phosphate ester modification on the hole transport property of the device is directly studied by measuring the hole mobility (μh) of the device. Hole-only devices of ITO/HTL/active layer/Au were fabricated for measuring μh from the J–V curves shown in Fig. 5 by using space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The μh value is calculated from the Mott–Gurney eqn (1):
(1)
where
JSCLC stands for current density, V is the applied potential, L is the thickness of the active layer, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the blend (assuming that 3.5), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 C V−1 s−1). The measured μh values are summarized in ESI Table S6. For the PTB7:PC71BM system, the calculated μh value of P-GO-based device is 2.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than those of GO-based (5.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PEDOT:PSS-based devices (1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Similar trends are observed for devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM active layers (see ESI Table S7). These results indicate that the hole transport property of the device is improved upon phosphate ester modification of GO, and this is benefical for the increase of the FF of the P-GO-based devices.


In summary, GO was modified via noncovalent phosphorylation and applied as a novel HTL of BHJ-PSC device for the first time, leading to improved hole transport relative to the pristine GO. By spin-coating a precursor solution of P2O5 dissolved in methanol affording the facile formation of phosphate ester [(CH3O)xPO(OH)3−x] (x = 1–3) onto GO layer, noncovalently phosphorylated GO (P-GO) film was prepared readily. Phosphate ester modification leads to increased RMS roughness and hydrophobicity of GO film, beneficial for the interfacial contact between the active layer and HTL. Besides, phosphate ester modification may lead to a P-doping effect of GO, and consequently the work function of ITO/GO increases from 4.24 to 4.70 eV, which matches better the HOMO levels of the donors, thus benefiting the formation of an Ohmic contact at the active layer/HTL interface. As a result, BHJ-PSC devices based on P-GO HTL exhibit the average PCE of 7.85%, 6.56% and 3.75% for active layer systems of PTB7:PC71BM, PBDTTT-C:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM, respectively, which are dramatically higher than those based on the pristine GO HTL due to the improved hole transport. Noncovalent phosphorylation of GO developed in this study is facile and effective, promising its potential application in high-efficiency polymer solar cells.
