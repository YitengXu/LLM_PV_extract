An ethynylene-linked benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-diketopyrrolopyrrole alternating copolymer, EDPP, was designed and synthesized to improve the open-circuit voltage of organic solar cells. The influence of the ethynylene on optoelectronic properties, energy levels, crystallinity, film morphology, and photovoltaic performance was investigated. Optical and electrochemical tests showed that introduction of ethynylene into the polymer backbone resulted in a larger bandgap, deeper HOMO energy level, and enhanced crystallinity due to the planar conformation and electron-withdrawing properties. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) showed that the pure EDPP film preferentially adopted a face-on orientation with a π–π stacking distance of 3.65 Å. After thermal annealing the face-on and edge-on orientations coexisted and the overall degree of crystallinity increased. Blending with PC71BM did not disrupt the crystallinity of the EDPP. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) showed that the EDPP:PC71BM blend films contained large domains, a few hundred nanometers in size. As a result, EDPP:PC71BM photovoltaic devices exhibited a high open-circuit voltage of 0.88 V, but a low short-circuit current, with a moderate power conversion efficiency of 1.98%.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have drawn attention as a promising technology for renewable energy in recent years due to the advantages of solution processability, low cost, light-weight, and flexibility. To get a BHJ device to function efficiently, usually a donor material, which plays a major role in light absorption, exciton generation and hole-conduction, and an acceptor material, which creates electron pathways, are required. The intrinsic properties of commercially available fullerenes show high electron affinities and mobilities and, consequently, are widely used as electron acceptors in BHJ devices. From the perspective of electron donor materials, introduction of low band-gap conjugated polymers consisting of alternating electron-rich (donor, D) and electron-deficient (acceptor, A) units in the conjugated backbone has been proven to be an effective strategy for achieving high performance OPVs, since their absorption can be extended to longer wavelengths via internal charge transfer (ICT) and their electronic properties can be easily tuned by varying the donor and acceptor units. For most reported D–A copolymers, the donor and acceptor units are connected by carbon–carbon single bonds in the polymer main chain, due, in part, to the availability of the efficient protocols for metal-catalyzed polycondensation of organometallic aryl monomers and aryl halides, like the Suzuki, Stille, Nigishi, and Kumada cross-coupling reactions,etc. The linkage of carbon–carbon single bond can extend the conjugation length but may also produce a fairly large twist angle between repeat units along the backbone due to steric hindrance between the neighboring carbon–carbon bonds. For example, one of the most well-studied polymer donor, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene copolymer (PTB7), prepared by palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction, was found to be nonplanar with an average inter-ring torsional angle of ∼25° by first-principles calculations. Such a steric twisting disturbs the formation of a more extended conjugation length and hinders efficient intermolecular stacking and solid-state packing. Insertion of unsaturated linkages (e.g., ethynylene and ethylene) between the donor and acceptor units has been recognized as a promising strategy to reduce steric hindrance and enhance coplanarity along the polymer backbone, which is beneficial for high charge carrier mobilities.

Poly(arylacetylenes) have attracted a significant amount of interest from the organic electronics community. Much of the research on these materials has focused on applications of their high fluorescent quantum efficiency characteristics, including metal ion sensing, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and bioimaging applications. Furthermore, poly(arylacetylenes) possess unique properties for OPV applications. Due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the ethynylene group, poly(arylacetylenes) usually have lower highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) compared to those of their analogues linked by carbon–carbon single bonds, leading to higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in organic solar cells. Hence, ethynylene-containing materials have been used in small molecules, polymers, and metallopolyyne photovoltaic materials. Janssen et al. reported that incorporating ethynylene units into the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) backbone could result in 0.3 eV lowering of the HOMO level, thus achieving a high Voc of 1.01 V, giving a significant improvement (0.4 V) of Voc with respect to P3HT:PCBM solar cells. Troshin, Facchetti, and Wong et al. reported the phenylene–vinylene–phenylene ethynylene copolymers, branched arylacetylenic small molecules, and Pt–acetylide-based oligomers and polymers, respectively, achieving the PCE of 3–4.93%. Recently, Braunecker et al. made a comparative study between a series of ethynylene-linked D–A conjugated polymers and their fully cyclic analogues. The authors found that the introduction of ethynylene linkages into the D–A systems universally resulted in planar conformations, significant blue-shift of absorbance, and a deeper HOMO value. So far, the ethynylene-containing D–A conjugated polymers have been only marginally explored, and their applications in OPV devices only achieved modest PCEs (generally <4%). The effect of ethynylene linkages on the BHJ morphology remains poorly understood.
In 2009, Yang and coworkers firstly reported the alternating copolymer poly(BDT-DPP) (Scheme 1) based on 4,8-dioctyloxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 2-ethylhexyl-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). Although poly(BDT-DPP) exhibited a low band-gap of 1.31 eV and broad light absorption range of 300–900 nm, the BHJ devices showed only a moderate PCE of 2.53% with a Voc of 0.68 V, due to a relatively high-lying HOMO level of 5.16 eV. Thereafter, intensive efforts have been made to improve photovoltaic performance of copolymers based on BDT and DPP, in which incorporation of alkylthienyl or alkylphenyl moieties onto the BDT unit and replacement of the neighboring thiophene units on the DPP core with either furan or selenophene rings have been performed, leading to further improvement of the PCE of over 8%, which is among the highest PCE values for the single-cell device. It is noteworthy that poly(BDT-DPP) copolymers usually display high-lying HOMO levels, and, thus, yield relatively modest Voc values, which is a limiting factor for high efficiency OPVs. It is well known that D–A conjugated polymers composed of “weak donor” units are beneficial for a low-lying HOMO level. One of the most widely used methods to gain the low-lying HOMO level is addition of pendant electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine, cyano or carboxy groups directly to the donor unit. Yu et al. successively introduced fluorine atoms into the thienothiophene (TT) and BDT units of the PTB, and the HOMO levels of the resulting polymers were lowered by ∼0.54 eV. Jo et al. reported that removing the strong electron-donating alkoxy-substituents from 4,8-positions of BDT could lead to a considerably lower HOMO (−5.46 eV) than those of dialkoxy-functionalized poly(BDT-DPP) (−5.29 eV), and thus a higher Voc value of 0.82 V was achieved.
Here, we introduce the electron-withdrawing ethynylene units into the polymer backbone to reduce their HOMO energy levels. An ethynylene-linked BDT-alt-DPP copolymer EDPP was synthesized by Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 1). And the polymer PBDTDPP bearing a similar chemical structure but without an ethynylene-bridge was also synthesized to compare with EDPP, thereby allowing us to focus solely on the impact of ethynylene units. As expected, EDPP indeed showed a deep HOMO of −5.68 eV, and thus a high Voc of 0.88 V was achieved when blending with PC71BM. Optical and electrochemical tests showed that introduction of ethynylene into the polymer backbone resulted in a larger band-gap and deeper HOMO energy level. To better understand the influence of ethynylene on the photovoltaic performance, a bulk heterojunction blended thin film morphology was systematically characterized by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), atom force microscopy (AFM), and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS).

All chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled from sodium/benzophenone ketyl prior to use. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-octyldodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene 5 was purchased from SunaTech Inc. (http://www.sunatech.com.cn). The monomers 1 and 4 were synthesized according to the literature.


The NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Mercury Plus 500 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 3150 PC spectrophotometer. TGA measurements were performed on a Netzsch TG209 apparatus. DSC measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer DSC 7 instrument with approximately 5 mg samples at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. GPC analysis of the copolymers was performed on a Shimadzu 10A series with THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard for calibration. FTIR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-470 plus Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and measured using KBr pellets. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 on an AUTOLAB.PGSTAT30 potentiostat/galvanostat system (Ecochemie, Netherlands), which was equipped with a three-electrode cell. The sample was cast onto a glass carbon disk as the working electrode and Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. Tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 mol L−1) was used as a supporting electrolyte. Atomic force microscopy was performed on a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100, operating in tapping mode. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed on a Beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. An X-ray beam impinged onto the sample at a grazing angle above the critical angle of the polymer film (αc = 0.16) but below the critical angle of the silicon substrate (αc = 0.24). The wavelength of X-rays used was 1.240 Å, and the scattered intensity was detected by using a PILATUS 1M detector. RSoXS was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Thin films were flowed and transferred onto a Si3N4 substrate and the experiment was done in transmission mode.


The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (20 ± 5 ohms sq−1) were bought from Thin Film Devices Inc., and were cleaned through ultrasonic treatment in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in an oven overnight. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP A1 4083) (∼35 nm) was spin-coated on the ultraviolet ozone-treated ITO substrates. After annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air, the substrates were transferred to the glove box. Polymer/PC71BM dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution (10 mg mL−1 of polymer concentration) was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm. The thickness of the film was ∼80–100 nm (KLA-TENCOR Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler). Finally, ∼5 nm of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) or 1 nm LiF and then a 100 nm thick Al cathode were deposited (area 6.5 mm2) on the active layer under a high vacuum (2 × 10−4 Pa) using a thermal evaporator. All current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based Newport 91160 300-W solar simulator. A Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used as the white light source. The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter.


Compound 1 (941.1 mg, 1 mmol), ethynyl trimethylsilane (245.6 mg, 2.5 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (4 mg), and cuprous iodide (2 mg) were added to a mixture of anhydrous THF (5 mL) and diisopropylamine (5 mL). The mixture was vigorously stirred at 60 °C for 24 h under nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane (v/v = 1/20) as the eluent to afford a pale yellow solid (yield: 70%, 683 mg). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.55 (s, 2H), 4.15 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 4H), 1.87–1.83 (m, 2H), 1.61–1.20 (m, 66H), 0.91–0.88 (m, 12H), 0.29 (s, 18H).


Compound 2 (722.1 mg, 0.74 mmol) and KOH (82.8 mg, 1.48 mmol) were added to a mixture of MeOH (3 mL) and THF (6 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature, then quenched with NH4Cl (aq.) and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic fraction was washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane (v/v = 1/9) as the eluent to afford a pale yellow solid (yield: 90%, 553.7 mg). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.63 (s, 2H), 4.14 (d, J = 5.39 Hz, 4H), 3.49 (s, 2H), 1.87–1.83 (m, 2H), 1.61–1.20 (m, 66H), 0.91–0.88 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 144.14, 131.56, 129.92, 126.56, 121.89, 114.10, 83.32, 39.21, 32.00, 31.98, 31.27, 30.10, 29.77, 29.73, 29.69, 29.44, 29.43, 27.00, 22.75, 14.17.


Monomer 3 (158.6 mg, 0.19 mmol), monomer 4 (194.5 mg, 0.19 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (8 mg), and cuprous iodide (4 mg) were added to a mixture of THF (5 mL) and diisopropylamine (5 mL). The mixture was vigorously stirred at 75 °C for 48 h under nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into a large volume of methanol. The precipitate was collected and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform successively. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. After drying under a vacuum overnight, a dark red solid was obtained with a yield of 63%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.95 (br, 2H), 7.8–7.2 (br, 4H), 4.20–4.05 (br, 8H), 2.0–0.87 (br, 160H). Mn = 46.3 kg mol−1; polydispersity = 2.55.


Monomers 5 (221.79 mg, 0.2 mmol), 4 (203.84 mg, 0.2 mmol), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (15 mg) were put into a round-bottom flask under the protection of nitrogen, and then 7 mL of degassed toluene was added. The mixture was vigorously stirred at 100 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into a large volume of methanol. The precipitate was collected and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone and finally chloroform successively. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. After drying under a vacuum overnight, a dark red solid was obtained with a yield of 70%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.22 (br, 2H), 7.66–7.13 (br, 4H), 4.23–4.11 (br, 8H), 2.0–0.87 (br, 160H). Mn = 10.2 kg mol−1; polydispersity = 2.11.


The synthesis route and structures of EDPP and PBDTDPP are shown in Scheme 1. To ensure the solubility of the polymer, 2-octyldodecyl chains were attached to nitrogen of the lactam in the DPP unit and the oxygen atoms of 4,8-positions of the BDT unit, respectively. PBDTDPP was synthesized by Stille coupling reaction following the method reported in the literature.EDPP was synthesized via a Sonogashira coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI as catalysts in a mixed solvent of toluene and diisopropylamine at 75 °C for 48 h. Both polymers were highly soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB) and DCB without gel formation. The 1H NMR spectrum of EDPP displayed broad resonance peaks of the polymeric characters. The peak at about 8.95 ppm could be assigned to the DPP thienyl protons, which appeared at a lower field than the DPP monomer 4 (8.64 ppm). The other aromatic protons of EDPP showed broad resonance peaks ranging from 7.8 to 7.2 ppm. The signals of the methylene adjacent to nitrogen of the lactam group in DPP units and oxygen of BDT units appeared around 4.2 and 4.0 ppm, respectively (Fig. S1). From FTIR results, the presence of absorption peaks around 2180 cm−1 assignable to the ethynylene moiety and the absence of the terminal ethynyl peaks (stretching vibrations around 3300 and 2100 cm−1) also supported the formation of an ethynylene-linked polymer (Fig. S2). The number-average molecular weights for EDPP and BDTDPP were 46.3 and 10.2 kg mol−1 with polydispersity values of 2.55 and 2.11, respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as an eluent against polystyrene standards (Fig. S3). The thermal properties of EDPP were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S4 and S5). The onset of thermal degradation temperature (5% weight loss) of EDPP was recorded at about 340 °C, showing excellent thermal stability for solar cell applications. However, no apparent thermal transitions were observed from DSC characterization while heating from 30 to 250 °C. It should be noted that in later X-ray investigation that structure order was seen for EDPP, which contradicts DSC observations. The reason for this discrepancy can be twofold: (1) due to the low crystalline nature in the bulk and slow crystallization kinetics EDPP thermal behavior can be hardly observed in a DSC scan; (2) X-ray measurement was done in thin film geometry, which might lead to a better structure.



Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of EDPP and PBDTDPP recorded in both chloroform solution and thin films. And the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. In a dilute solution, EDPP exhibited broad absorption in the range of 300–800 nm with two distinct energy bands. The absorption band around 300–500 nm could be assigned to π–π* transition of the conjugated main chain. And the second broad absorption band from 500 to 800 nm in the long wavelength region exhibited two peaks at 645 and 703 nm. The first peak originated from the ICT between BDT donor and DPP acceptor, and the second peak originated from polymer chain stacking (J-type). The absorption spectrum of EDPP in solution was similar to that of the thin film, and the maximum absorption peak was slightly red-shifted from 703 nm to 707 nm. These results indicated that EDPP polymer chains formed an aggregated structure in chloroform solutions, which most probably came from the flattened backbone structure induced by ethylnylene linkage. This could be verified by the absorption measured at an elevated temperature of 50 °C, at which the absorption peak of the aggregate blue-shifted from 703 nm (25 °C) to 694 nm (50 °C) and the absorption intensity was reduced significantly. The 707 nm absorption peak in the solid film became broader and showed a much higher intensity than that measured in solution, indicating better ordering of chains during solidification. A ∼15 nm red-shift in the absorption onset point was seen from solution to thin film absorption, showing a band gap narrowing induced by structure ordering. PBDTDPP exhibited similar absorption characteristics as compared to the literature analogue of poly(BDT-DPP) with different alkyl chains. However, the introduction of ethynylene units into the main chain resulted in a blue-shift in the absorbance spectra in both solution and the solid state compared to PBDTDPP, which implied that the ICT between BDT and DPP moieties was not as efficient as when directly linking them together. The maximum extinction coefficient of EDPP was 6.19 × 104 M−1 cm−1, slightly higher than that of PBDTDPP (5.22 × 104 M−1 cm−1). This slight increase in absorption for EDPP could be attributed to the introduction of the ethynylene chromophore into the backbone. The optical band gaps of EDPP and PBDTDPP based on optical absorption edges of the film spectra were 1.55 and 1.31 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical characteristics of EDPP were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The redox potentials of the polymers were referenced to the ferrocene/ferroceenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (absolute energy level of −4.8 eV relative to a vacuum). As shown in Fig. 2, EDPP exhibits one reversible reduction wave and one irreversible oxidation wave. The oxidation and reduction onsets appeared at 0.85 and −1.2 V, respectively, corresponding to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.68 and −3.63 eV. For PBDTDPP, the oxidation and reduction onsets appeared at 0.60 and −1.22 V, respectively, corresponding to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.43 and −3.61 eV. The introduction of ethynylene units into the polymer backbone significantly reduced the HOMO level by ∼0.25 eV with respect to the fully heterocyclic analogue PBDTDPP, which is consistent with literature results. Hence, a higher Voc in EDPP-based OPVs could be expected due to its deeper HOMO level. The calculated electrochemical bandgap of EDPP was 2.03 eV, which was about 0.5 eV larger than the optically determined one (1.55 eV). Similar differences had been seen in the literature, which could be attributed to the exciton binding energy of conjugated polymers, in the range of ∼0.4–1.0 eV.

The photovoltaic characteristics were investigated with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al. Due to the formation of a surface dipole at the interface between the photoactive layer and metal electrode, thus suppressing the interfacial recombination, conjugated polyelectrolyte PFN was prepared on the top of the photoactive layer as a cathode buffer. BHJ devices based on EDPP:PC71BM blends were fabricated and tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The active layers were optimized by varying the EDPP:PC71BM blends under different weight ratios (2:1, 1.5:1, 1:1, and 1:2). Fig. 3 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the photovoltaic data of the devices are summarized in Table 2. The Jsc exhibited a strong dependence on the EDPP:PC71BM weight ratios. On decreasing the EDPP content in the active layer from 2:1 to 1:1, Jsc increased from 2.84 to 5.67 mA cm−2. Then Jsc started to drop on further decreasing the EDPP content. The fill factor (FF) showed a similar trend, but the maximum value (45%) appeared at the weight ratio of 1.5:1. In general, the fill factors for these devices were low. The possible reason for the low fill factor in BHJ devices most probably could be strong recombination, which strongly limited device performance. Different from Jsc and FF, Voc almost remained constant (0.84–0.88 V). Finally, with the optimized weight ratio of EDPP:PC71BM at 1:1, a best but moderate PCE of 1.98% was achieved, with a Jsc of 5.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, and a FF of 39%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of the optimized device is shown in Fig. 4. The EQE curve of the device covered a broad range from 300 to 800 nm, showing contributions from both EDPP and PC71BM. However, the EQE value was not high, and that was the reason for its low current. A photovoltaic device of a PBDTDPP:PC71BM blend was also fabricated at 1:1 weight ratio to compare with EDPP polymer OPV performance. The PBDTDPP:PC71BM device showed a reasonable Voc of 0.66 V, which was consistent with the literature analogue of poly(BDT-DPP). However, the low Jsc of 1.48 mA cm−2 and FF of 39% limited the device performance with a poor PCE value of 0.37%, which could be partially attributed to the low molecular weight of PBDTDPP. Notably, EDPP exhibited relatively high Voc, due to its low-lying HOMO level, which was about 0.22 eV higher than that of the PBDTDPP based device. Although the Voc was significantly improved by introduction of ethynylene groups into the backbone, relatively low Jsc and FF limited the overall performance of the EDPP:PC71BM devices. Similar phenomena have been reported by Janssen et al., where incorporating ethynylene units into the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) backbone could result in a significant improvement (0.4 V) of Voc compared to those of P3HT:PCBM devices.

The crystalline properties, such as the chain registration and crystal orientation of pure polymer and polymer:PC71BM blends, are investigated using GIWAXS. Experiments were carried out in a helium chamber to reduce air scattering. The 2D diffraction profiles are shown in Fig. 5 and out-of-plane and in-plane line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 3. In the pristine film, EDPP showed semicrystalline properties and a broad diffraction halo ring existing at q = 1.4 Å−1 was attributed to scattering from amorphous regions within the EDPP film. A strong out-of-plan diffraction peak at qz = 1.72 Å−1 could be seen, which corresponds to a distance of 3.65 Å and is attributed to π–π stacking. This π–π stacking distance is obviously shorter than that of PBDTDPP (3.9 Å), which is due to the better coplanarity and rigidity of ethynylene groups, thus facilitating closer stacking. Also, a sharp and intense diffraction peak at qxy = 0.28 Å−1 in the in-plane direction was observed, which came from (1 0 0) lamellar stacking of alkyl chains with a d-spacing of 22.4 Å. These diffraction patterns show that EDPP preferentially adopt a highly ordered face-on orientation with respect to the substrate, which is obviously different from the patterns in a PBDTDPP film in that polymer chains assumed random orientations without a significant preference for edge-on or face-on orientations. When thermally annealed at 200 °C for 30 min, a strong diffraction peak at about qz = 0.3 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction is seen, suggesting formation of the edge-on orientation. At the same time, the (1 0 0) peak in the in-plane direction and the (0 1 0) peak in the out-of-plane direction still showed high intensity. Therefore, thermal annealing induces the growth of edge-on crystallites from amorphous materials and the face-on orientation is sustained. The Scherrer equation was used to estimate the crystal correlation length (CCL) from the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of (1 0 0) lamellar stacking. The CCL of the annealed film was increased to 23.5 nm, which was about 4.2 nm larger than that of the as-cast film (19.3 nm). The area of both (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) peaks showed enhancement upon thermal annealing, indicating a better order for the annealed thin film. In blends, the amorphous halo of the polymers overlaps with the PC71BM scattering (∼1.35 Å−1), making it difficult to assess the structure information of PC71BM. The EDPP polymer in blends primarily assumes a face-on orientation, as indicated from strong (0 1 0) reflection in the out-of-plane direction. The characteristic (1 0 0) and (0 1 0) diffraction peaks remained almost at the same positions relative to that for the pure polymer film. This indicates that the lamellar and π–π stacking distances of the polymer chains were not significantly influenced in the presence of PC71BM, and no PC71BM molecule was intercalated between the polymer chains. Consistent with this, the FWHM of (1 0 0) reflection remained almost the same as in the as-cast film, indicating the same CCL in the blend films.

The morphology of the active layer is one of the key factors determining the photovoltaic performance. The different performance of EDPP:PC71BM blend films was further analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). The surface morphologies of EDPP:PC71BM blend films with different weight ratios were characterized using tapping-mode AFM (Fig. 7). Note that these blend films were prepared according to the device procedure. The surfaces of all the films are fairly smooth and uniform. Varying the blend ratio of EDPP:PC71BM, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the blend films firstly decreases slightly from 1.69 (2:1) to 1.22 nm (1:1), then increasing to 2.37 nm (1:2). Phase contrast is related to the difference in adhesive and mechanical properties of individual materials, which indicates that the dark and bright regions correspond to different components. Large domain size of several hundreds of nanometers and discontinuous phase separation can be clearly observed in Fig. 7a′ and b′ when blending with 2:1 and 1.5:1 weight ratios, which is not beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus resulting in low Jsc and FF. When decreasing the EDPP content to 1:1, the domains appear to become better defined and smoother, but still larger than the tens of nanometers. On further decreasing the weight ratio to 1:2, both height image and phase image changed strongly, indicating that a high PCBM load significantly changes the phase separation and physical properties of the film.

AFM allows us to probe the morphology at the top surface of the film; however, it provides little information about the bulk morphology. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was utilized to investigate the bulk morphology of the blend films. In the RSoXS experiment, the beam energy was tuned to 284.2 eV, which is at the carbon K-edge to enhance the contrast of the PCBM and polymer. Fig. 8 shows the RSoXS profiles of EDPP:PC71BM blend films. The 2:1 EDPP:PC71BM blend film showed dual scattering peaks: a scattering peak at ∼0.0014 Å−1 and a shoulder at ∼0.006 Å−1, corresponding to center-to-center spacing of 450 and 100 nm, respectively. Thus a hierarchical morphology existed in this thin film. It was expected that the large size of phase separation was the interspacing of PCBM rich domains, and the 100 nm phase separation was polymer crystal interspacing. When the EDPP content decreased to 1.5:1 and 1:1, the intensity of the scattering peak at ∼0.0014 Å−1 gradually reduced, while the intensity of the shoulder (∼0.006 Å−1) became increasingly intense and the position slightly shifted to a low q value. In the 1:1 EDPP:PC71BM blend film, the dominant domain spacing was about 140 nm (0.0044 Å−1). The increase of PCBM content leads to permissive distribution of PCBM inside the BHJ thin film and no isolated PCBM rich domain can be discerned. The inter-crystal distance also increased due to PCBM swelling of the entire film. On further reduction of the EDPP content to 1:2, the scattering peak became more intense, and exhibited broad distribution towards a low q region. This was because overloading of PCBM led to aggregation of isolated PCBM domains, which gave rise to a new spacing in scattering. The inter-crystal spacing should be close to or slightly larger than the 1:1 case. A reduction in performance was expected due to the reduction in absorption since lesser polymer was used. However the existence of a similar inter-crystal spacing would still generate a fair amount of current; thus the performance drop would not be disastrous. These results were consistent with the photovoltaic device characterization, where 1:1 EDPP:PC71BM blend films achieved the optimized photovoltaic performance. It should be noted that adding a 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive does not strongly boost the performance of the devices (results shown in the ESI), since no strong PCBM aggregation was seen in the BHJ thin film. In fact addition of the additive led to more PCBM aggregation and slightly enlarged the size of phase separation; thus a drop in performance was recorded. It should also be noted that the observed phase separation was mainly due to the strong polymer crystallization. We observed a ∼20 nm (1 0 0) crystal size. Polymer crystals assume a face-on orientation, and the (1 0 0) direction was in-plane. The ∼100 nm phase separation best described the inter-crystal spacing by taking account of amorphous polymers and PCBM. Thus, such a large crystal size was not ideal to keep the length scale of phase-separated domains on the tens of nanometer level, explaining the moderate performance of this family of materials.

Ethynylene-linked D–A copolymer EDPP based on BDT and DPP units was synthesized by Sonogashira coupling reaction. Compared to the fully heterocyclic analogue PBDTDPP, introduction of ethynylene units into the polymer backbone resulted in the blue-shift of the maximum absorption. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that EDPP had a low-lying HOMO level of −5.68 eV, which was about ∼0.25 eV lower than that of PBDTDPP. EDPP:PC71BM devices gave a significant (0.22 V) improvement of Voc with respect to PBDTDPP:PCBM solar cells. With the optimized weight ratio of EDPP:PC71BM at 1:1, a best but moderate PCE of 1.98% was achieved, with Jsc of 5.67 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.88 V, and FF of 39%. GIWAXS revealed that EDPP preferentially adopts a face-on orientation with respect to the substrate. RSoXS suggested that the EDPP:PC71BM blends formed the large phase separation domains around 100 nm, which is the major reason for the low Jsc. This study demonstrates that introduction of ethynylene units into the polymer backbone is an effective method to improve the Voc of photon active materials. However, to get an overall enhanced performance of an OPV device we need to focus more on the size of phase separation. Too large crystal size will prohibit a refined phase separation and thus no optimized Jsc can be obtained. Thus a more comprehensive material design including modifying structures to directly tune morphology is a must in developing better performance materials.
