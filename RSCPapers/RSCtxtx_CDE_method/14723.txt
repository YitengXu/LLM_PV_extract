Herein, we propose a novel concept of adding PDI–PC61BM as a non-volatile morphology regulator to the active layer, with the low bandgap polymer PBDB-T as a donor and IT-DM as a nonfullerene molecule acceptor, to promote the molecular order of both the donor and acceptor. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device based on PBDB-T:IT-DM system is promoted by 1.39% from 10.63% to 12.23%.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSC) with a nonfullerene small molecule as an acceptor have attracted significant attention in the past few years ever since the successful performance of fullerene as an acceptor has been reported; fullerene has the advantage of tunable chemical structure for adjusting energy levels and provides complimentary light absorption to polymer donors. Among the high-performance nonfullerene acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have excellent electron-withdrawing capability, electron mobility, and relative ease of functionalization. Another type of small molecule acceptor is based on the acceptor (A)–donor (D)–acceptor (A) strategy with rigid side chains perpendicular to the molecular backbone for the prevention of self-aggregation; moreover, through fine tuning of the relative donor–acceptor strength to allow intramolecular charge transfer, the energy levels and energy bandgap of this acceptor can be adjusted. A typical example is that a single cell based on PBDB-T-SF as a polymer donor and IT-4F as a nonfullerene small molecule acceptor provides a PCE as high as 13.1%.

To obtain a desirable bicontinuous network in the active layer, some strategies such as thermal annealing, solvent annealing, addition of a high-boiling point additive, or additive-containing post treatment are required. The high-boiling point additive has much lower vapor pressure than the host solvent; this results in a longer drying time that allows more time for molecular arrangement in the spin casting process. Thus, this enables control of the extent of phase separation of the two components to provide a favorable bicontinuous network morphology. The high-boiling point additive will then evaporate away under vacuum during the metal deposition process. Moreover, the electrode interface affects vertical phase separation, influencing the charge transport behavior. However, the addition of a nonvolatile material to the active layer to promote the molecular order for effective morphological control has not been reported to date.
In PSCs, open circuit voltage (Voc) is mainly determined by energy level offset between the HOMO level of the polymer donor and LUMO level of the acceptor: the larger the offset, the higher the Voc. For a specific polymer donor, upshifting the acceptor LUMO level can obviously improve Voc, but this strategy may reduce the driving force for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Zhan and coworkers selected PTB7-Th (HOMO level −5.20 eV and LUMO level −3.59 eV) as a polymer donor and IDT-2BR (HOMO level −5.52 eV and LUMO level −3.69 eV) as a small molecule acceptor with LUMO offset merely 0.1 eV and added a small amount (1 wt%) of the lower LUMO level (−3.90 eV) non-volatile fully conjugated molecule PDI–2DTT as an energy driver to enhance the driving force for charge transfer. It resulted in efficient charge transfer between the polymer donor and small molecule acceptor although molecular packing and the extent of donor/acceptor phase separation remained unchanged. We therefore term it as an electron stabilizer in this study. The device performance was promoted by 1.6% from 8.5% to 10.1%.
In this study, we propose a novel concept of introducing a non-volatile morphology regulator (NVMR) to promote the extent of molecular order using PDI–PC61BM as an example, which is composed of a conjugated flat molecule moiety (PDI) and a fullerene derivative moiety (PC61BM) connected by a flexible spacer. The PBDB-T:IT-DM was selected as the active layer for the NVMR due to its small LUMO offset (0.25 eV), enabling a high Voc. From the results of the grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, we found that the addition of PDI–PC61BM in a small amount to the active layer simultaneously enhanced the intensities of the X-ray diffraction peaks associated with the molecular order of PBDB-T and IT-DM; this was due to the increases in the populations of the ordered domains in both phases. As a result, the charge mobilities and exciton dissociation are promoted. The device based on the PBDB-T:IT-DM system is promoted by 1.39% from 10.63% to 12.02% (12.23% when thin ITO is used) in PCE upon the addition of a small amount (2 wt%) of PDI–PC61BM as NVMR. This new concept is expected to be applicable to other PSC systems.
We chose PBDB-T as a polymer donor and IT-DM with high-lying LUMO level as a small molecule acceptor (Fig. 1a) and proposed the small molecule PDI–PC61BM with lower LUMO levels relative to those of IT-DM as NVMR to promote exciton dissociation and electron transport. The synthesis route and detailed procedures for the NVMR are described in the ESI. The absorption spectra of PBDB-T, IT-DM, and PDI–PC61BM coated on quartz glass plates from their solutions in chlorobenzene (CB) were obtained (Fig. 1b), which showed their absorption peaks and absorption coefficients as 626 nm and 1.1 × 105 cm−1, 700 nm and 1.3 × 105 cm−1, and 504 nm and 4 × 104 cm−1 (and 340 nm and 9 × 104 cm−1), respectively. The HOMO/LUMO levels of IT-DM and PDI–PC61BM as determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and calibrated with ferrocene, along with absorption onset, are −5.47 eV/−3.78 eV and −5.88 eV/−3.86 eV, respectively (Fig. S1). The values for IT-DM are slightly different from the reported values (−5.56 eV/−3.93 eV). For PDI–PC61BM, the oxidation onsets of PDI and PC61BM are very close; it is difficult to distinguish the oxidation peaks individually for each functional moiety in PDI–PC61BM. As the LUMO offset between PBDB-T and IT-DM is not high (0.25 eV), the addition of PDI–PC61BM with two lower LUMO levels (PDI: −3.83 eV, PC61BM: −3.90 eV (ref. 16)) is able to promote the dissociation of excitons generated in the donor and acceptor and stabilizes the generated electrons by reducing the extent of electron back transfer to PBDB-T such that energy loss via electron–hole recombination is reduced. The PDI–PC61BM-assisted stabilization of electrons is illustrated in Fig. 1c.
For the present active layer, we fabricated conventional-type PSCs with the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:small molecule/PFNBr/Al (Fig. 2a); the detailed device fabrication procedure is shown in the ESI. At first, we compared the PCE of PBDB-T with that of small molecules (ITIC and IT-DM) under non-optimized conditions: the PCE of the PBDB-T:ITIC system (8.16%, Table S1) is lower than that of PBDB-T:IT-DM (10.29%, Table S2). Therefore, we chose the PBDB-T:IT-DM system for further study. For the PBDB-T:IT-DM system, we used different high-boiling point additives, i.e. 1-chloronaphthalene (Cl-na), 1-naphthalenethiol (SH-na), 1-methylnaphthalene (Me-na), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and diphenyl ether (DPE), to adjust the miscibility of PBDB-T and IT-DM. Related studies on these additives are cited in the ESI. To select the most suitable additive for further studies, 1% by volume each of the additives was added to the active layer; the performances of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. S2a and their characteristic parameters are listed in Table S2. The device based on the DPE additive provided the best short-circuit current (Jsc) 16.18 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) 0.68, and PCE 10.45%. We then optimized the content of DPE and found that 0.5 vol% DPE was optimal, and the corresponding device, as shown in Fig. S2b and Table S3, provided a Jsc of 16.23 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.69, and a PCE of 10.63%.
We further added the proposed NVMR PDI–PC61BM at the different contents 1–3 wt%, and the performances of the corresponding devices and their characteristic parameters are shown in Fig. 2b and Table S4. The PCE increases from 10.63% to 12.02% with the addition of the optimal 2 wt% PDI–PC61BM. The PCE improvement is due to the increased Jsc and FF; however, the Voc remains at 0.95 V and drops slightly to 0.94 V at 3 wt% PDI–PC61BM. The FF improves from 0.69 to 0.74 due to the reduced series resistance (Rs) (from 5.23 to 4.26 Ω cm2) and increased shunt resistance (Rsh) (from 1113 to 2522 Ω cm2). Rs is related to the materials used and interfacial resistance between the active layer and transport layer electrode, whereas Rsh is related to the leakage current and charge recombination. Therefore, as PDI–PC61BM is added, charge transport is promoted, and the extent of electron back transfer from the acceptor to the donor is reduced; consequently, the Jsc is increased from 15.95 ± 0.28 to 16.69 ± 0.42 mA cm−2.
To understand if PDI and PC61BM moieties in the composed molecule PDI–PC61BM provide a synergistic effect to device performance, we have also added PDI and PC61BM each alone to the PBDB-T:IT-DM (with 0.5 vol% DPE) active layer at 0.5–2 wt%. Their J–V curves and device parameters are summarized in Fig. S3 and Tables S5 and S6. Due to the lower LUMO level of PDI or PC61BM relative to that of PBDB-T and IT-DM, addition of either one of them can promote effective exciton dissociation. At the optimal content 1 wt% PDI or PC61BM, the device performance is improved relative to that without PDI or PC61BM. For PCE, it improves from 10.63% to 11.35% (PDI) and 11.16% (PC61BM), which is similar to the improvement observed in the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BR system with the nonvolatile additive PDI–2DTT (PCE promoted from 8.5% to 10.1%). Since the addition of either PDI or PC61BM improves the device performance, we have therefore further investigated the case by adding 1 wt% PDI and 1 wt% PC61BM simultaneously. The PCE further slightly increases to 11.55% by 0.2% and 0.39% (Fig. 2c and Table S7), but is still lower than that of the composed molecule PDI–PC61BM (12.02%) as revealed below.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices without and with 0.5 vol% DPE additive and with 2 wt% PDI–PC61BM are shown in Fig. 2d. The EQE from 500 to 720 nm shows obvious improvement after the addition of DPE due to improvement of the morphology of the active layer and therefore leads to increases in Jsc and EQE. The integrated Jsc from the EQE measurement is 15.73 mA cm−2 with the addition of DPE. When 2 wt% PDI–PC61BM is further added, the EQE ranging from 380 nm to 540 nm is obviously improved, where the light absorption of the polymer PBDB-T dominates (Fig. 1b). This reflects that the lower LUMO levels of PDI–PC61BM can effectively promote the dissociation of PBDB-T exciton, leading to increase of EQE and Jsc. The conversion efficiency reaches about 80% at 600 nm, and the integrated Jsc from EQE is 16.78 mA cm−2 with the addition of PDI–PC61BM; this is in agreement with the J–V measurement within 3% error. For the abovementioned reported devices, we used ITO with 320 nm thickness as transparent conducting oxide (TCO). We also used ITO glass with ITO thickness reduced to 75 nm to increase the light transmittance. The light transmittances of the two different ITO glass plates in the range 300–900 nm are shown in Fig. S4a; the light transmittance of the 75 nm thick ITO is higher than that of the 320 nm thick ITO by about 5–10% in the wavelength range from 300 to 450 nm and 650 to 900 nm. Using 75 nm thick ITO as TCO for fabricating the PSC device with PDI–PC61BM, the performance is improved in terms of both Jsc (from 17.11 mA cm−2 to 17.63 mA cm−2) and PCE (from 12.02% to 12.23%) as compared to that of the 320 nm thick ITO (Table 1); their J–V curves and characteristic values are shown in Fig. S4b and Table S8, respectively.

Addition of NVMR PDI–PC61BM also promotes PCE on PBDB-T:ITIC (from 8.16% to 8.95%, Table S1) and PBDB-T:IT-DM (from 10.63% to 12.23%, Table 1) systems. We believe that NVMR PDI–PC61BM is potentially useful for polymer solar cells; however, compatibility of PBDB-T:ITIC with NVMR should be tuned by varying the NVMR structure for optimal performance. Further study is now under way.
For BHJ PSCs with high performance, the morphology of the active layer is preferred to form bicontinuous/interpenetrating networks in the polymer donor and small molecule acceptor domains. We used GIWAXS to investigate the molecular order in PBDB-T and IT-DM phases in the active layer upon the addition of different materials including PDI, PC61BM, PDI plus PC61BM, and PDI–PC61BM (Fig. S6). For the GIWAXS experiment, the samples of the active layers were prepared by spin-casting their solutions on silicon wafers pre-coated with PEDOT:PSS under the same fabrication conditions as used for device fabrication. The two-dimensional (2-D) GIWAXS patterns (displayed in Fig. S6) were used to obtain the one-dimensional (1-D) line-cut profiles in the scattering vector q range of 0.22–2.5 Å−1 along the in-plane (qy) and the out-of-plane (qz) directions (Fig. S7). The GIWAXS scattering intensities are presented at the same active layer film thickness of 100 nm with background subtraction to allow quantitative comparison between samples treated with different additives. In the in-plane 1-D profiles, the positions of the (100) peaks observed at qy(100) = 0.29 Å−1 and 0.344 Å−1 indicate that the inter-layer distances of the lamellar structure (composed of an alternating conjugated backbone and a side chain layer) formed by PBDB-T and IT-DM are 21.67 Å and 18.27 Å, respectively, as calculated by the Bragg's law d = 2π/q. We also clearly observed the (010) peaks associated with the π–π stacking of pure PBDB-T and IT-DM at qz(010) = 1.70 Å−1 and 1.81 Å−1, corresponding to the π–π stacking distances of 3.70 Å and 3.47 Å, respectively. The scattering intensities of the (010) peaks along the in-plane direction are much weaker than those along the out-of-plane direction. Thus, only scattering from face-on domains is significant and subject to analysis below. The observed (010) peak of the blend of PBDB-T and IT-DM is composed of the peaks associated with the individual constituents. The intensity of the observed (010) peak of the blend (without additive) is lower than that calculated by the linear additivity rule using the weight ratios and peak intensities of the pure constituents; this may be attributed to the seemingly favorable interaction between the two components that lowers the extent of π–π stacking relative to those in their pure states (Fig. S7). Fig. 3a summarizes the intensities of the scattering peaks of the samples studied, including (1) the observed (100) peaks of PBDB-T and IT-DM, (2) the observed (010) peak composed of the two overlapped peaks of the two components, and (3) the respective (010) peaks of the two components obtained from the deconvolution of the observed peak by taking the peaks of pure PBDB-T (at qz = 1.7 Å−1), IT-DM (at qz = 1.81 Å−1), and silicon background (around qz = 1.3 Å−1) in the curve fitting using the Gaussian function. It can be seen that after adding the DPE additive, the intensities of the observed (100) and (010) peaks increase slightly (Fig. 3a); this indicates that DPE improves the overall extent of molecular order of PBDB-T and IT-DM in the blend; this is the main reason for the improvement of the device performance upon the addition of the DPE additive.
The active layers show different scattering peak intensities upon the addition of different materials (PDI, PC61BM, PDI & PC61BM, and PDI–PC61BM) to the PBDB-T:IT-DM (DPE) active layer containing 0.5 vol% DPE. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, both the (100) and (010) peak intensities decrease obviously after adding 1 wt% PDI to the active layer; this is probably due to the interruption of the ordered arrangement of PBDB-T and IT-DM molecules by the long branch side chain (2-decyltetradecyl) of PDI during the morphological development process in spin casting, similar to that observed in the literature. The addition of PC61BM to PBDB-T:IT-DM (with DPE) promotes the overall molecular order of both PBDB-T and IT-DM, as reflected by the increases in the scattering peak intensities as compared to the case of PBDB-T:IT-DM (with DPE) (Fig. 3a), similar to those observed in the literature. To explore the origin of the increases of the scattering intensities, we further used the Scherrer equation,Lhkl = 0.9λ/(Bhklcosθ), to calculate the correlation lengths of the ordered packing of PBDB-T and IT-DM using the widths of their respective scattering peaks; the results are listed in Table S9. The correlation length can be considered as a measure for the size of the ordered domain, and the values of the correlation lengths along the (010) or π–π stacking direction deduced from the (010) peaks are summarized in Fig. 3a. The correlation length along the (010) direction does not show large changes (from 1.81 nm to 1.92 nm for PBDB-T and from 2.08 nm to 2.13 nm for IT-DM) after the addition of PC61BM to the active layer; this indicates that the improvement of scattering intensity arises mainly from the increases of the populations (rather than the sizes) of the ordered PBDB-T and IT-DM domains. As PDI and PC61BM are added simultaneously, the scattering peak intensity associated with the π–π stacking decreases; this indicates that the long branch side chain (2-decyltetradecyl) of PDI interrupts the face-on molecular arrangement of PBDB-T and IT-DM.
As PDI–PC61BM is added, the (010) peak intensities of both PBDB-T and IT-DM increase (Fig. 3a), showing more effective promotion of the molecular order of PBDB-T and IT-DM than that of the other additives. The correlation lengths associated with π–π stacking only increase slightly (from 1.81 to 1.98 nm for PBDB-T and from 2.08 to 2.37 nm for IT-DM); consequently, PDI–PC61BM is an effective additive for enhancing the population of the ordered domains in both PBDB-T and IT-DM phases. Although PDI interrupts the ordered molecular arrangement, PDI–PC61BM has a net effect of promoting the overall molecular order because the tendency of the PDI moiety to be intercalated to PBDB-T and IT-DM domains is highly reduced by its covalent connection with PC61BM. Therefore, PDI–PC61BM is most likely located at the interfaces of the ordered domains of the donor and acceptor or in the amorphous region. The GIWAXS measurements were used to analyze the molecular arrangement and phase separation in the bulk film of the active layer. PDI–PC61BM promotes phase separation, as seen from an increase of the scattering intensity (Fig. 3), by improving the populations of PBDB-T and IT-DM ordered domains extracted from the amorphous region. In the amorphous region, PDI–PC61BM may reduce the mutual miscibility between the donor and acceptor and therefore lead to an increase of the populations of the ordered domains of PBDB-T and IT-DM. The distribution of PDI–PC61BM at the interface of PBDB-T and IT-DM domains is beneficial for promoting exciton dissociation and electron transfer and therefore improves the device performance. It is conceivable that the presence of spherical fullerene is an essential part of NVMR, and the other part should be a conjugated acceptor moiety compatible to some extent with the molecular acceptor. Fig. 3b and c schematically illustrate the function of PDI–PC61BM in initiating polymer chains and acceptor molecules in the amorphous phase to form additional ordered domains.
As observed from the contact angle measurement (Fig. S9), PBDB-T (132.5°) has a higher contact angle than IT-DM (73.7°). The contact angle of the active layer surface reduces from 98.2° to 96.3° upon the addition of PDI–PC61BM; this indicates an increase in the amount of IT-DM on the surface. The morphology of the active layer is critical to the performance of PSCs since the formation of bicontinuous/interpenetrating networks of polymer donor and small molecule acceptor in the active layer is essential for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. As observed from the AFM topography images (Fig. S9a–e), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of PBDB-T:IT-DM (DPE) and that upon further addition of different materials (PDI, PC61BM, PDI & PC61BM, and PDI–PC61BM) is 3.7 nm, 3.36 nm, 3.06 nm, 3.56 nm, and 3.15 nm, respectively. The roughness slightly decreases after the addition of different materials, but the topography images (Fig. S9a–e) do not show obvious changes. As PDI–PC61BM is added, the phase contrast image (Fig. S9j) shows less bright regions as compared to those of other additives. It could result from the increase in the amount of IT-DM on the surface, as reflected from the contact angle measurement (Fig. S9). More IT-DM located on the active layer surface could be the reason for the improvement of the FF and therefore device performance.
We then measured charge mobilities for the active layer with the DPE additive and the added PDI–PC61BM using hole- and electron-only device methods, as shown in Fig. S11 and Table S10. The hole mobility slightly increases from 2.31 × 10−4 to 2.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after adding PDI–PC61BM; however, electron mobility improves significantly from 4.01 × 10−5 to 6.57 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 resulting from an increase in the number of face-on orientation of IT-DM. On the other hand, the more balanced electron/hole mobility ratio (without: 0.17, PDI–PC61BM: 0.25) could also contribute to the PCE improvement of the PSC with the added PDI–PC61BM.

In conclusion, we proposed a novel material, PDI–PC61BM, for addition to the PBDB-T:IT-DM active layer using its lower LUMO level to promote exciton dissociation and reduce the extent of electron–hole recombination. Furthermore, it promotes the populations of the ordered domains of PBDB-T and IT-DM, in which the conjugated polymer and molecule form π–π stacking. PDI–PC61BM is most likely distributed at the interfaces of PBDB-T and IT-DM ordered domains. This distribution is also beneficial for exciton dissociation. The device based on PBDB-T:IT-DM system promotes the PCE of the device from 10.63% to 12.02% (12.23% when thin ITO glass is used) by 1.39% upon the addition of a small amount (2 wt%) of PDI–PC61BM, which is termed a nonvolatile morphology regulator to distinguish from the volatile additives (such as DIO, DPE) and electron stabilizers (such as PDI). Although the addition of PDI, PC61BM or PDI & PC61BM also promotes device performance, PDI–PC61BM provides synergistic effects that lead to the best improvement among the other nonvolatile additives studied herein.
