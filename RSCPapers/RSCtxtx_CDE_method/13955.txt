In this study we synthesized quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-Cl, PQ-Br, PQ-F) for use as defect passivation additives in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)-based inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The defect passivation efficiency of PQ-Cl was much better than those of PQ-F and PQ-Br. The addition of the PQ-Cl to the MAPbI3 layer repaired the crystal defects, increased the crystallinity, and improved the coverage of the perovskite layer during the formation of the resulting perovskite films. Accordingly, the UV-Vis absorption intensities and external quantum efficiencies of the PQ-Cl-doped perovskite films were enhanced, especially for the MAPbI3 film blended with 0.06 wt% of PQ-Cl. The photovoltaic (PV) performance and stability of the PQ-Cl-incorporated PVSCs were improved relative to those of the control sample. The architecture of the cellulose derivative-doped inverted PVSCs was indium tin oxide/P3CT-Na/cellulose derivative (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, or PQ-Br):MAPbI3/PC61BM/bathocuproine/Ag. The PV performance and stability of the PQ-Cl-incorporated PVSC were superior to those of the PQ-F- and PQ-Br-doped PVSCs. The PVSC incorporating 0.06 wt% of PQ-Cl displayed the best PV performance, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.01%, an open-circuit voltage of 1.00 V, a short-circuit current density of 20.32 mA cm−1, and a fill factor of 76.80%. This PQ-Cl-0.06-based PVSC retained 92% of its initial PCE after 600 h of storage under ambient conditions (30 °C; 60% relative humidity).

Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted much attention because of their simple solution processing, low cost, and high photo-conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Indeed, the PCEs of PVSCs have increased from 3.8 to 25.2% within a very short period of time. PVSCs based on methylammonium lead halide perovskites [MAPbX3, where MA is a methylammonium (CH3NH3+) cation and X is a halide anion] are particularly interesting because of their excellent optical absorption properties, ambipolar charge transporting abilities, weakly bonded excitons that readily dissociate into free charges, and very long electron–hole diffusion lengths. These PVSCs have usually been fabricated using solution deposition processes, including spin-coating, roll-to-roll coating, and ink-jet printing. Although solution fabrication processes have the advantage of allowing manufacturing at low temperature, over large areas, and with low material wastage, crystal defects usually appear at grain boundaries and at the surface during the crystal growth of perovskite films during their thermal annealing. The crystal defects or imperfections that can appear on the surfaces or grain boundaries of perovskite crystals include undercoordinated halide ions, undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, lead clusters, Pb–I antisite defects (PbI3), and I or MA vacancies. These crystal defects can induce ion migration, charge trapping, charge carrier recombination, and moisture/oxygen permeability—all of which decrease the photovoltaic (PV) performance and stability of PVSCs. To develop efficient and stable PVSCs, a variety of additives have been introduced, including Lewis acids, Lewis bases, organic chromophores, and polymers.

Many additives have recently been passivated directly on the surface of perovskite films to minimize the number of surface and grain boundary defects, while also improving the PV characteristics and operational stability of their corresponding PVSCs. A formamidinium iodide (FAI) solution has been spin-coated onto perovskite surfaces, followed by post annealing; the FA+ and I− ions diffused into the vacancies formed by the loss of organic cations and halogen ions. Similarly, the passivation of 4-fluorophenethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI) onto the surface of a perovskite film significantly suppressed the formation of iodine vacancies, resulting in a much slower rate of charge trapping; as a result, the champion efficiency of the F-PEAI-modified PVSC was significantly greater than that of the control device. In addition, the introduction of hydrophobic 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenethylamine hydroiodide (CF3PEAI) onto the surface of perovskite films helped to decrease the number of internal defects and improve the long-term stability; compared with the control sample, the CF3PEAI-passivated perovskite film exhibited better energy level alignment, lower surface roughness, longer carrier lifetimes, a lower trap state density, and higher stability.
Various additives have also been incorporated into the methylammonium iodide (MAI) precursor solution, allowing the preparation of MAPbI3 films displaying lower numbers of grain boundary and interface defects in their perovskite bulk films. Cai et al. reported that incorporating trimethylammonium chloride in MAPbI3 perovskite films could minimize the number of grain boundaries and trap densities, thereby increasing the charge carrier diffusion coefficient and diffusion length. Chen et al. explored the effects of benzylammonium halide (BZAX; X = Cl, Br, I) salts as additives on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface morphology, crystal structure, optical characteristics, and solar cell performance and stability. The additive BZACl having a BZA+ cation as a surface capping ligand and exhibiting strong electronegativity, attributed to its Cl− anion, suppressed the formation of iodine vacancies as defects. Incorporating BZACl into MAPbI3 films could effectively minimize the number of defects and suppress non-radiative recombination, resulting in a significant increase of the PCEs and stabilities of the resulting PVSCs. Zhang et al. reported that the addition of 1-propyl-(4,4′-bipyridin)-1-ium iodide passivated antisite defects and positively charged defects in the perovskite, thereby improving the PCEs of the PVSCs. The pyridyl group and I− anion passivated the positively charged defects induced by the loss of iodine, with the pyridinium group passivating the Pb–I antisite defects through electrostatic interactions.
In addition to the examples mentioned above, amino-, hydroxyl-, and carboxyl-containing polymers have all been tested as additives for the perovskite precursor solution, where they have functioned as templates to control the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite films, thereby resulting in PVSCs exhibiting high PCEs. Moreover, these insulating polymer scaffold structures can stabilize the resulting PVSCs under humid environments, due to the high hygroscopicity of the polymers; as a result, such polymer-containing PVSCs have displayed high stabilities and self-healing PV properties. Although ammonium/pyridinium halide derivatives and polymers have been studied widely as additives for controlling the morphology and repairing the crystal defects of perovskite films, only a few papers have reported the synergistic effects of organic ammonium halides (or pyridinium halides) and polymers on the quality of perovskite thin films. Wang et al. employed a polymeric salt, poly(1-vinyl-3-ethylacetate)imidazole tetrafluoroborate (PEa), to modulate the crystallization and electronic properties of a perovskite. Their PEa contained multiple chemical anchoring sites capable of strong coordinative bonding to Pb ion defects at grain boundaries and at the interfaces of the perovskite films, thereby effectively passivating electronic defects and enhancing the photo-, thermal-, and moisture-stability of the perovskite films.
In this study, we synthesized three quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, PQ-Br) for use as defect passivation additives to minimize the number of crystal defects of MAPbI3 films and, thereby, enhance the PV performance of MAPbI3-based PVSCs. The polymer chains of the cellulose acted as a scaffold for crystal growth of the perovskite films. The incorporation of ethyl cellulose or cellulose acetate into the perovskite film can significantly improve its moisture stability, thermal stability, and photostability by forming hydrogen bonds with MAPbI3 to stabilize its crystal structure. Moreover, we expected the quaternary ammonium ions to passivate only the MA+ vacancies by occupying cuboctahedral sites, thereby compensating for MA+ loss at the surfaces of the perovskite films. Because the fluoride (F−), chloride (Cl−), and bromide (Br−) ions in the quaternary ammonium salts are more electronegative and have smaller ionic radii than iodide (I−) anions, they form ionic bonds with Pb2+ cations that are stronger than the Pb–I bonds in perovskite films. Therefore, we expected the halide anions in the quaternary ammonium salts of the cellulose to effectively passivate uncoordinated Pb2+ through Lewis acid–base interactions. Accordingly, we incorporated PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br into the perovskite precursor solutions in an attempt to repair the crystal defects and tune the morphologies of the perovskite layers during their formation. We anticipated that a cellulose derivative presenting multiple functional side-chain units (quaternary ammonium halides) would provide chemical anchoring sites for the passivation of under-coordinated Pb2+ cations in the perovskite film. Indeed, the addition of quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivative PQ-Cl decreased the content of grain boundaries defects, increased the crystallinity, and improved the coverage of the resulting perovskite films. Accordingly, the PQ-Cl-modified MAPbI3-based PVSCs displayed improved PV properties. We investigated the synergistic effects of the ammonium halide units and the long polymer chain of cellulose on the MAPbI3 surface morphology, crystal structure, and optical and PV performance.

Quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose ethoxylate [PQ-Cl; weight-average molecular weight (Mw) = 250000 g mol−1; degree of polymerization = 600] was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Sodium fluoride (NaF) and sodium bromide (NaBr) were purchased from Fluka. Poly[3-(4-carboxybutyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3CT, Mw = 3000–4000 g mol−1) was purchased from Rieke Metals. Bathocuproine (BCP) was purchased from Acros. The electro-transporting material 6,6-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was purchased from Uni-onward and used as received. Hydroiodic acid (HI), methylamine (CH3NH2), lead iodide (PbI2), and other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Acros, and TCI Chemical and used as received. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and chlorobenzene (CB) were freshly distilled over appropriate drying agents, then purged with N2, prior to use. The hole transporting material P3CT-Na was synthesized according to the literature. The chemical structure of PQ-Cl and the syntheses of PQ-F and PQ-Br are illustrated in Scheme 1. PQ-F and PQ-Br were prepared through ion exchange of PQ-Cl with NaF and NaBr, respectively. A dialysis bag containing solution of PQ-Cl in DI was immersed in a saturated aqueous NaF (or NaBr) and stirred to ensure the ion exchange of Cl− with F− (or Br−). PQ-F and PQ-Br were obtained after freeze-drying.


Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a HORIBA FT-720 FTIR spectrometer. 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a high-resolution NMR spectrometer (Varian Unity Inova, 600 MHz) with solutions in DMSO-d6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an XPS spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI, PHI500 VersaProbe). The glass transition temperatures (Tg), melting temperatures (Tm), and thermal decomposition temperatures (Td; temperatures at which weight loss reached 20%) of the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, PQ-Br) were determined through differential scanning calorimetry (TA Instruments, DSC-2010) and thermogravimetric analysis (TA Instruments, TGA-2050). Both analyses were performed under a N2 atmosphere at scanning (both heating and cooling) rates of 10 °C min−1. Absorption spectra of the PQ-F-, PQ-Cl-, and PQ-Br-blended MAPbI3 films coated on P3CT-Na-deposited indium tin oxide (ITO) glass were recorded using a Hitachi U3010 UV-Vis spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the PQ-F-, PQ-Cl-, and PQ-Br-blended MAPbI3 films coated on P3CT-Na-deposited ITO glass were measured using a Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrometer and a Delta Time TCSPC-MCS kit with 405 nm pulsed LED light. The pristine and cellulose derivative-blended MAPbI3 films were encapsulated within glass sheets for measurements of their UV-Vis, PL, and TRPL spectra. The morphologies of the PQ-F-, PQ-Cl-, and PQ-Br-blended MAPbI3 films coated on P3CT-Na-deposited ITO glass were imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Seiko SII SPA400), performed in tapping mode. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the perovskite layers coated on P3CT-Na-deposited ITO glass were analyzed using cold field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Hitachis-4800; operating voltage: 1.5–2.0 kV). The crystalline structures of the perovskite layers coated on P3CT-Na-deposited ITO glass were determined using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD, Shimadzu SD-D1), operated using a Cu target at 35 kV and 30 mA.


The PVSCs fabricated in this study had the structure ITO-coated glass/P3CT-Na/photoactive layer/PC61BM/BCP/Ag (100 nm), where the photoactive layer was a film of MAPbI3 doped with a quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivative (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, or PQ-Br) (as displayed in Fig. 1). The ITO-coated glass (sheet resistance: 20 Ω square−1) was purchased from Applied Film. Glass substrates with patterned ITO electrodes were washed well and then cleaned through O2 plasma treatment. A thin film of the HTM, P3CT-Na, was deposited on the ITO layer through spin-casting. The sample was dried at 150 °C for 10 min. CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized by reacting CH3NH2 with HI, according to previous reports. The prepared MAI powder and PbI2 were stirred with various amounts of a quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivative (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, or PQ-Br: 0.03, 0.06, or 0.12 wt%) in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (4:1, v/v). The resulting solution was deposited on top of the HTL-coated ITO substrate. The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite films doped with 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 wt% of PQ-F are named herein as PQ-F-0.03, PQ-F-0.06, and PQ-F-0.12, respectively; the films doped with 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 wt% of PQ-Cl are named herein as PQ-Cl-0.03, PQ-Cl-0.06, and PQ-Cl-0.12, respectively; the films doped with 0.03, 0.06, and 0.12 wt% of PQ-Br are named herein as PQ-Br-0.03, PQ-Br-0.06, and PQ-Br-0.12, respectively. A solution of PC61BM in CB (20 mg mL−1) was coated on top of the MAPbI3 layer; a solution (0.3 mL) of BCP in isopropanol (0.5 mg mL−1) was then coated on the PC61BM layer. In a high-vacuum chamber, the Ag-based cathode was thermally deposited onto the PC61BM layer. The active area of the PVSC was 0.24 cm2. The cathode deposition rate was determined using a quartz thickness monitor (STM-100/MF, Sycon). The thicknesses of the thin films were determined using a surface texture analysis system (3030ST, Dektak). The PV properties of the PVSCs without encapsulation were measured using a programmable electrometer equipped with current and voltage sources (Keithley 2400) under illumination with solar-simulated light (100 mW cm−2) from an AM1.5 solar simulator (NewPort Oriel 96000).


The chemical structures of the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, PQ-Br) were confirmed using FTIR spectroscopy and XPS. Fig. S1 displays the FTIR spectra of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br; their absorption behavior was similar. A broad absorption peak representing the O–H groups appeared at 3200–3600 cm−1. The C–H stretching peaks appeared at 2800–3000 cm−1. The signal for C–N–C stretching appeared at 1359 cm−1. The signal for stretching of the C–O units appeared at 1065 cm−1.


Fig. 2 presents the XPS spectra of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br. The survey scans of the three samples [Fig. 2(a)] revealed that, in addition to signals for C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s, signals appeared for F 1s, Cl 2p, and Br 3d in the spectra of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br, respectively. For PQ-Cl, signals of the Cl 2s and Cl 2p binding energies were present at 268.4 and 197.5 eV, respectively. After ion exchange with NaF and NaBr, the Cl 2s and Cl 2p peaks were absent from the spectra of PQ-F and PQ-Br. Signals for the F 1s, F 2s, and F 2p binding energies of PQ-F were present at 686.5, 25.5, and 17.4 eV, respectively. The signals for the Br 3s, Br 3p, and Br 3d binding energies of PQ-Br appeared at 254.2, 180.4, and 68.1 eV, respectively. In addition, the signals for the N 1s binding energies of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br appeared at 401.8, 402.2, and 402.4 eV, respectively [Fig. 2(b)]. The N 1s binding energy of PQ-F was lower than those of PQ-Cl and PQ-Br, consistent with the higher electronegativity of the F− counter anion. We calculated the ion exchange yields for Cl− being replaced by F− or Br− based on the signal intensities and affect factors of the signals for F 1s, Cl 2p, and Br 3d. The ion exchange yields for PQ-F and PQ-Br were 97.68 and 97.80%, respectively. These high ion exchange yields allowed us to study the effects of the quaternary ammonium salts on the morphologies and PV performance data of the resulting cellulose derivative-doped MAPbI3-based solar cells.
We used DSC [Fig. 3(a)] and TGA [Fig. 3(b)] to measure the values of Tg, Tm, and Td of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br. The glass transition temperatures were determined from the second rounds of the DSC heating scans. The values of Tg for the cellulose derivatives PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br were similar: 35.1, 33.3, and 32.4 °C, respectively. The values of Tm for PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br were also similar: 171.7, 171.2, and 170.0 °C, respectively. Thus, the thermal properties of these cellulose derivatives were not affected by the counter anions of quaternary ammonium salts. The values of Td, corresponding to 20% weight loss, for PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br were 312.4, 272.4, and 278.4 °C, respectively. Because moisture was absorbed by these quaternary ammonium-presenting cellulose derivatives, the weight of each cellulose derivative decreased significantly upon increasing the temperature up to 120 °C, especially for PQ-Cl and PQ-Br. Nevertheless, these high thermal stabilities suggested that our quaternary ammonium halide-presenting cellulose derivatives would be suitable for use in PVSCs.

To investigate the effects of the added quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br on the crystallization of the perovskite films, we used SEM to examine the morphologies and film qualities of the PQ-F/MAPbI3, PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films and, thereby, determine optimal processing conditions for the preparation of the MAPbI3-based photoactive layers. Fig. 4, S2 and S3 present top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, PQ-F/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films, respectively, that had been subjected to annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Moreover, Fig. 5, S4 and S5 display the MAPbI3 crystal grain size distributions of the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, PQ-F/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the average crystal sizes of the PQ-F/MAPbI3, PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films, calculated using Image J software. The average sizes of the MAPbI3 crystal grains decreased after incorporation of the quaternary ammonium halide-functionalized cellulose derivatives. Furthermore, the average sizes of the MAPbI3 crystal grains decreased upon increasing the content of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br. As displayed in Fig. 6, the quaternary ammonium units had a chemical structure similar to that of the MA+ cation, such that they might participate in the perovskite crystallization process through partial substitution of MA+ cations, while also replacing the I− anion with another halide anion. Moreover, polymer chains in general are known to reside at the grain boundaries of perovskite domains. We suspect that the spatial steric bulk and thermal mobility of the polymer backbones of the cellulose derivatives affected the crystal formation of MAPbI3, thereby decreasing the average size of the perovskite crystals. Moreover, the average sizes of the crystal grains of the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 composite films were larger than those of the PQ-F/MAPbI3 and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films. The superior crystal defect repair ability of the quaternary ammonium chloride units of PQ-Cl resulted in the larger average size of the crystal grains. Nevertheless, the cross-sectional SEM images indicated that the crystal grains with smaller size underwent denser packing. When compared with the pristine MAPbI3 film, the grain boundaries among the various crystal grains became more vague for the cellulose derivative-incorporated MAPbI3 films, resulting in the higher coverage of the perovskite films. The repairing of crystal defects by the quaternary ammonium halides presumably helped to connect the crystal grains. The decrease in the number of grain boundaries and the greater packing density of the crystal grains both favored charge transfer in the perovskite films. The molecular interactions in solution between the perovskite and the cellulose derivative PQ-Cl were characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Fig. S6(a) displays the NMR spectrum of a solution containing CH3NH3I, PbI2, and PQ-Cl. Signals corresponding to the NH3+ and CH3 groups of CH3NH3I appeared at δ = 7.150 and 1.682 ppm, respectively. Signals from PQ-Cl appeared at δ = 2.0 and 4.0 ppm. Fig. S6(b) and (c) reveal that molecular interactions between the CH3NH3+ group and cellulose derivative PQ-Cl shifted the signals of the CH3NH3+ group. In addition, we used XPS to confirm the repairing effect of the quaternary ammonium halides. Fig. 7 presents the XPS spectra of the PQ-F-0.03-, PQ-Cl-0.06-, and PQ-Br-0.03-based perovskite films. The characteristic peaks of Pb2+ appeared at 142.2 and 137.2 eV. The characteristic peaks of Pb2+ moved to higher binding energies after the incorporation of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br, presumably because of strong interactions between the perovskite and the quaternary ammonium salt units of the cellulose derivatives. Furthermore, cross-sectional SEM images revealed that the thickness of the perovskite layer decreased upon increasing the content of the cellulose derivative, especially after blending with 0.12 wt% of the additive. An excess of the additive inhibited crystal growth of the MAPbI3 layer. Moreover, the PQ-Br-doped perovskite layers were thinner than the PQ-F- and PQ-Cl-doped perovskite layers.

We used AFM microscopy to confirm the effects of the addition of the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives PQ-Cl, PQ-F, and PQ-Br on the morphologies of the perovskite films. Fig. 8, S7 and S8 display AFM images of the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, PQ-F/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films, respectively, that had been subjected to annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Table 1 summarizes the surface roughness values of the cellulose derivative-incorporated MAPbI3 layers. The AFM images indicate that the crystal grain sizes decreased upon increasing the content of the cellulose derivatives in the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, PQ-F/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films. This observation is consistent with the SEM images. In addition, the surface roughnesses of the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, PQ-F/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films were much lower than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film. Moreover, the surface roughnesses decreased slightly upon increasing the content of the cellulose derivatives. The surface roughnesses of the MAPbI3 films having a cellulose derivative content of 0.12 wt% were slightly higher than those of the samples containing 0.03 and 0.06 wt% of the cellulose derivatives. The decrease in the surface roughness of the MAPbI3-based composite films indicated that the presence of the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br) led to defect passivation. Moreover, the smaller crystal grains in the perovskite films with smoother surfaces suppressed scattering of light and improved the absorption capacity, both of which would favor enhancements in PV performance.

We used XRD to study the crystal structures of the perovskite films incorporating the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives. Fig. 9, S9 and S10 reveal that the perovskite films prepared with different contents of PQ-Cl, PQ-F, and PQ-Br exhibited the typical diffraction peaks of solution-processed MAPbI3 perovskites, including characteristic peaks at 14.2, 28.4, and 43.08° corresponding to the (110), (220), and (330) phases, respectively. These signals suggested the formation of tetragonal perovskite structures having lattice constants a and b each equal to 8.883 Å and c equal to 12.677 Å. Therefore, we conclude that the addition of a quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivative did not destroy the intrinsic crystal structure of the perovskite film. Furthermore, the intensities of the (110) peaks for the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 films (PQ-Cl-0.03, PQ-Cl-0.06, and PQ-Cl-0.12) were higher than that for the pristine MAPbI3 sample (Fig. 9). The highest intensity of the (110) peak was that for the PQ-Cl-0.06 sample. The intensity of the (110) peak of the PQ-Cl-0.12 sample was lower than that of the PQ-Cl-0.06 sample. The higher (110) diffraction peak intensities suggested higher crystallinities for the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 composite films. The higher peak intensities in the XRD patterns implied higher phase purity and preferential orientation of the PQ-Cl-doped perovskite crystals, both of which would be beneficial for improving the electronic properties (e.g., charge carrier transport) of the perovskite films. We attributed the enhancements in the crystallinities of the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 composite films to the presence of PQ-Cl inducing the repair of crystal defects. The quaternary ammonium cationic units and Cl− anions could passivate the positively charged defects induced by the loss of iodine, with the ammonium units passivating Pb–I antisite defects through electrostatic interactions. In addition, the intensities of the (110) peaks for the PQ-F/MAPbI3 (PQ-F-0.03 and PQ-F-0.06) composite films were similar to that of the pristine MAPbI3 sample (Fig. S9). The (110) peak for the PQ-F-0.12-based composite film was of lower intensity. The intensities of the (110) peaks of the PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films decreased upon increasing the PQ-Br content (Fig. S10). According to the XRD patterns, the effects of crystal defect repair were not obvious for the PQ-F- and PQ-Br-doped MAPbI3 films. Compared with a Cl− anion, stronger electronegativity would limit the dissociation of the F− anion from a quaternary ammonium fluoride. Accordingly, fewer F− anions could compensate for I− vacancies in the perovskite. Moreover, when compared with the Cl− anion, the larger ionic radius of the Br− anion would affect the compensation of I− vacancies. Therefore, the effects of PQ-F and PQ-Br on crystal defect repair were poorer than that of PQ-Cl. Table 1 summarizes the crystal sizes of the PQ-F/MAPbI3, PQ-Cl/MAPbI3, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 composite films. We calculated the crystal sizes from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) diffraction peak, according to the Scherrer equation. The crystal size of MAPbI3 decreased after addition of the cellulose derivatives PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br. The spatial steric bulk of the polymer backbones of the cellulose derivatives probably affected the crystal formation of MAPbI3, leading to the decrease in the crystal size of the perovskite.


We recorded the UV-Vis spectra of the perovskite films incorporating the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br to examine the effects of the additives on the optical properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite films (Fig. 10). The absorption spectra of the cellulose derivative-blended MAPbI3 films were quite similar to that of the pristine MAPbI3 film, implying that the addition of the cellulose derivatives did not destroy the intrinsic crystal structure of the MAPbI3 film. In comparison with the spectrum of the pristine film, the spectra of the perovskite films blended with PQ-Cl absorbed more strongly over almost the entire spectral range, except for the PQ-Cl-0.12 film. The highest absorption intensity was that for the PQ-Cl-0.06 film. This enhanced intensity is consistent with the greater crystallinity, lower number of grain boundaries, enhanced coverage, and decreased reflection for the modified MAPbI3 films, especially for the PQ-Cl-0.03 and PQ-Cl-0.06 films. In addition, the absorption intensities of the PQ-F/MAPbI3 and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 blend films were lower than that of the pristine MAPbI3 blend film. The absorption intensity decreased upon increasing the PQ-F and PQ-Br contents. The lower absorption intensities of the PQ-F- and PQ-Br-blended MAPbI3 films (PQ-F-0.03, PQ-F-0.06, PQ-F-0.12, PQ-Br-0.03, PQ-Br-0.06, and PQ-Br-0.12) suggest smaller crystal grains, lower crystallinity, and poorer crystal defect repair.

We used PL spectroscopy study the effects of the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br on the PL properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite films. Fig. 11(a) presents the PL spectra of perovskite films incorporating various contents of PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br. The maximal PL wavelength of the perovskite films was approximately 768 nm. Compared with the pristine MAPbI3 film, the PL intensity decreased significantly after incorporation of PQ-Cl for the PQ-Cl-0.03- and PQ-0.06-incorporated perovskite films. Thus, the charge separation capacity was enhanced after incorporation of PQ-Cl in the MAPbI3 perovskite layers. The PL intensity of the PQ-Cl-0.06-incorporated film was lower than those of the other PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 composite films (PQ-Cl-0.03 and PQ-Cl-0.12), consistent with the higher crystallinity of the former film. We attribute the lower PL intensities of the PQ-Cl-blended MAPbI3 films to the lower numbers of crystal defects and the good defect passivation effects of PQ-Cl. In contrast, the PL intensities of the PQ-F/MAPbI3 and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 blend films were higher than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film. This observation implies poor film quality, lower crystallinity, and poor crystal defect repair for the PQ-F- and PQ-Br-blended MAPbI3 films. Nevertheless, the PL intensities of the PQ-F/MAPbI3 films were lower than those of the PQ-Br/MAPbI3 films. The lower PL intensity of the PQ-F/MAPbI3 films implies that PQ-F had a better effect on crystal defect passivation.
We recorded TRPL spectra to investigate the influence of the quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br on the charge recombination process [Fig. 11(b)]. We obtained carrier lifetimes by fitting the PL spectra with a double-exponential-decay model:
I(t) = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2
where
A1 and A2 are constants and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow decay constants, respectively. Table S1 summarizes the fitting results of TRPL spectra. We considered the average lifetime to be the average of the fast and slow decay constants. We obtained the average decay lifetime from the equation
τavg = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)
where
τ1 is related to defect recombination or interface charge transport from MAPbI3 to the charge transport materials, and τ2 is related to radiative recombination. For the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 blend films, the lifetimes of PQ-Cl-0.03 and PQ-Cl-0.06 were shorter than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film, implying that the incorporation of PQ-Cl could effectively minimize the number of defects of the perovskite film and enhance charge extraction, thereby minimizing non-radiative combination loss. Nevertheless, an excess PQ-Cl content did not decrease the number of defects of the perovskite film. The PQ-Cl-0.12 film exhibited a longer lifetime than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film. In addition, the lifetimes of the PQ-F/MAPbI3 and PQ-Br/MAPbI3 blend films were longer than that of the MAPbI3 film. Thus, the film quality and charge transfer ability from the perovskite to the P3CT-Na layer worsened when the MAPbI3 films incorporated PQ-F and PQ-Br.


We used the optimized spin-coating procedure to fabricate PVSCs incorporating MAPbI3/cellulose derivative blends as photoactive layers. Fig. 12 displays the photocurrent density–voltage plots of the PVSCs incorporating MAPbI3 films blended with various contents of quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br). Fig. 13 provides a statistical box plot for the PV parameters of 20 PVSCs incorporating un-encapsulated pristine MAPbI3 and cellulose derivative/MAPbI3 blend films. Table 2 summarizes the statistical values of the PV properties of these PVSCs, including their open-circuit voltages (VOC), short-circuit current densities (JSC), fill factors (FFs), and PCEs. We performed five runs of PV evaluation tests for each PVSC sample. For PVSC I, prepared without a cellulose derivative as additive, we obtained a value of VOC of 1.01 ± 0.01 V, a value of JSC of 18.90 ± 0.60 mA cm−2, an FF of 73.40 ± 2.20%, and a PCE of 13.61 ± 0.35%. These PV parameters are comparable with those of other published PVSCs having similar architectures. Relative to the pristine PVSC I, we observed higher PV properties for the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3 composite film-based PVSCs (PVSC II and PVSC III, but not for PVSC IV). The PV properties improved after increasing the content of PQ-Cl within the PVSCs II and III. The highest performance was that for PVSC III incorporating the PQ-Cl-0.06 film: a value of VOC of 0.98 ± 0.02 V, a value of JSC of 19.72 ± 0.60 mA cm−2, an FF of 75.80 ± 1.95%, and a PCE of 14.75 ± 0.26%. The higher values of VOC, JSC, and FF are in agreement with the higher crystallinity and the stronger UV-Vis spectral absorptions of the perovskite films doped with PQ-Cl. The incorporation of PQ-Cl, presenting Cl− anions, improved the film quality of the perovskite layer and led to efficient charge separation and extraction and a low degree of charge recombination. We used incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectroscopy to confirm the improvements in the values of JSC of the PVSCs incorporating the cellulose derivatives (Fig. 14). The IPCEs for the PQ-Cl-0.03- and PQ-Cl-0.06-based PVSCs II and III were higher than that of PVSC I, incorporating the pristine film. Thus, we conclude that the presence of PQ-Cl had a significant effect on the crystal defect repair and crystallinity of the MAPbI3 film. In addition, an excessive amount of PQ-Cl did not enhance the PV performance: PVSC IV, incorporating the PQ-Cl-0.12 film, displayed PV properties poorer than those of PVSC I, incorporating the unmodified film, consistent with the poorer crystallinity of PQ-Cl-0.12 evidenced from the SEM and AFM images and XRD patterns. In contrast, the PV performance of the PVSC worsened when the MAPbI3 films incorporated PQ-F (PVSCs V, VI, and VII) and PQ-Br (PVSCs VIII, IX, and X). Thus, the effects of PQ-F and PQ-Br on crystal defect repair were poorer than that of PQ-Cl. The spatial steric bulk of the polymer backbones of the cellulose derivatives led to decreases in the crystallinity of the perovskite films. Therefore, we obtained poorer PV performance from the PQ-F/MAPbI3- and PQ-Br/MAPbI3-based PVSCs. Furthermore, the values of VOC, JSC, and PCE of the PQ-F/MAPbI3-based PVSCs (PVSCs V, VI, and VII) were higher than those of the PQ-Br/MAPbI3-based PVSCs (PVSCs VIII, IX, and X). Relative to the PQ-Br-blended MAPbI3 films, the higher UV-Vis absorption intensities, lower PL intensities, and larger average crystal sizes of the PQ-F-blended MAPbI3 films resulted in the higher PV performance of PVSCs V–VII. Similarly, the IPCEs of the PQ-F/MAPbI3-based PVSCs were higher than those of the PQ-Br/MAPbI3-based PVSCs. Accordingly, the incorporation of PQ-Cl could improve the PV performance of MAPbI3-based PVSCs, due to its good effect on crystal defect repair in the MAPbI3 layer.

Fig. 15 displays the storage stability characteristics of the pristine and PQ-F-0.03-, PQ-Cl-0.06-, and PQ-Br-0.03-based PVSCs. The PV parameters of the pristine, PQ-Cl-0.06-, PQ-F-0.03-, and PQ-Br-0.03-based PVSCs without encapsulation, measured after storage for various periods of time under ambient conditions (30 °C; 60% relative humidity), are summarized in Tables S2–S5, respectively. The PCE-stability of the PQ-Cl-0.06-based PVSC III was superior to those of the pristine and PQ-F-0.03- and PQ-Br-0.03-based PVSCs (PVSC-I, PVSC-V, and PVSC-VIII). The PQ-Cl-0.06-based PVSC III retained 92% of its initial PCE after 600 h. The effect of PQ-Cl on crystal defect repair was much better than the effects of PQ-F and PQ-Br. The incorporation of PQ-Cl induced effective crystal defect passivation, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. In addition, the PCE-stabilities of the PQ-F-0.03- and PQ-Br-0.03-based PVSC-V and PVSC-VIII were not better than that of pristine MAPbI3-based PVSC I, presumably because of the poorer crystal defect passivation and lower perovskite crystallinity induced by PQ-F and PQ-Br.

We have employed three quaternary ammonium halide-containing cellulose derivatives (PQ-F, PQ-Cl, and PQ-Br) as additives in MAPbI3 films used for the preparation of corresponding MAPbI3-based PVSCs. The addition of an appropriate amount of PQ-Cl repaired the grain boundary defects and enhanced the light absorption capacity of the perovskite film. Meanwhile, the spatial steric bulk of the polymer backbones of the cellulose derivatives affected the crystal formation of MAPbI3, leading to decreases in the average sizes of the perovskite crystals. The effect of PQ-Cl on crystal defect repair was much higher than those of PQ-F and PQ-Br. Accordingly, XRD patterns indicated that the crystallinity of the PQ-Cl-based MAPbI3 films was larger than those of the pristine and PQ-F- and PQ-Br-based MAPbI3 films. Consequently, the PV properties and PCE storage stabilities of the PQ-Cl/MAPbI3-based PVSCs were superior to those of the pristine MAPbI3-, PQ-F/MAPbI3-, and PQ-Br/MAPbI3-based PVSCs.
