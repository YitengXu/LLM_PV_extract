Fully printable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on an inorganic metal oxide architecture have attracted tremendous attention due to its feature of showing principally high stability. However, fully printable PSCs show a lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the thin film PSCs owing to the thick mesoscopic layers that pose an obstacle to charge collection. Herein, the triple cation perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2, for the first time, is introduced in fully printable PSCs on the basis of a mesoporous metal oxide TiO2/Al2O3/NiO layered framework with a carbon counter electrode. We found that partial replacement of FA/MA by Cs could increase the bandgap and exciton binding energy of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite. An optimal efficiency of 17.02% can be obtained using Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 as the light absorber under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents the highest efficiency observed to date for fully printable PSCs using a carbon counter electrode. Detailed investigations with nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements revealed that the presence of Cs in perovskite compounds can increase the charge carrier lifetime along with diffusion length, benefiting charge transport in thick mesoscopic layers. Furthermore, the Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2-based PSCs exhibit good stability with a retention of over 90% initial PCE after 1020 h in dark conditions at 85 °C.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been investigated extensively owing to their large absorption coefficient over a wide spectral range, high carrier mobility as well as ambipolar charge transport, etc. A typical hybrid halide perovskite material usually exhibits the formula ABX3 as it is composed of a cation, A = methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), formamidinium (FA, CH3(NH2)2+), or cesium (Cs+, B = Pb2+ or Sn2+), and an anion X = Cl−; Br−, I−. In the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs increased rapidly from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.1% in 2016.

Most highly efficient PSCs use an organic hole transport material (HTM), such as spiro-OMeTAD with Li-bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)imide and tert-butylpyridine as dopants. These doping additives are hydrophilic and consequently compromise device stability. Recently, several reports have suggested that the organic HTMs become penetrable (at elevated temperatures) during stability tests, causing a diffusion of metal electrode material into the perovskite layer across the HTM, and the occurrence of irreversible degradation has also been reported. Therefore, it is highly desirable to remove organic HTMs or replace them with other materials for highly stable PSCs. Fortunately, it was found that HTM-free (or depleted junction) PSCs could also operate efficiently thanks to the unique ambipolar property of the perovskite. Lately, carbon counter electrode (CE) based HTM-free PSCs have attracted much attention, which show much promise to overcome the abovementioned problems. However, the ZrO2 layer with micrometer-thick (1–2 μm) working as space layer between the TiO2 layer and the carbon layer in this type devices releases charge transportation and then hinders further improvement of the device performance. For instance, the photon-generated holes have to travel over a relatively long pathway in such a device before reaching the carbon CE. This leads to a misbalance between effective light harvesting/charge transportation. These important characteristics are related to the device architecture and perovskite preparation method, which always result in devices with relatively low FF and Voc values. Recently, we carried out systematic investigation on charge transportation and collection to improve device performance. For example, when single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were employed in the carbon CE, the PSCs using a mesoscopic TiO2/Al2O3 structure as a framework achieved a PCE of ∼14.7%, which could be attributed to an increased charge collection. To further increase the charge extraction, we suggested a fully printable metal oxide mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/NiO PIN layered framework for MAPbI3 solar cells, showing a PCE of ∼15%. The junction formed in the inorganic metal oxide TiO2/Al2O3/NiO layers could augment charge extraction. However, the Voc of those devices using an inorganic metal oxide framework is lower than that of efficient PIN PSCs with organic charge transport layers.
The perovskite compounds with appreciably long carrier diffusion lengths can further increase the device performance. FAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and CsPbBr3 possess long carrier diffusion lengths in the range from 177 nm to 9.2 μm. In principle, carriers with a long diffusion length can be efficiently extracted in photovoltaic devices. Compared to MAPbI3, FAPbI3 polycrystalline films have longer hole diffusion lengths (∼800 nm) and electron diffusion lengths (∼180 nm). However, the black α-phase of FAPbI3 is only thermodynamically stable above 433 K, which limits its practical application. The non-perovskite (yellow) phase of FAPbI3 can be effectively suppressed by introducing MA. A PCE of over 18% was achieved based on the planar structured device of FTO/TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/poly (triarylamine)/Au. However, traces of the yellow phase in the FA/MA-based perovskites have been observed. The introduction of Cs to FA/MA-perovskite can also be able to further suppress yellow phase impurities. A PCE of 21.1% was achieved with a Cs/MA/FA triple cation mixture perovskite-based solar cell using a structure of compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/Cs5(MA0.17FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/spiro-OMe-TAD/Au.
In this work, we comprehensively investigated Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite as light absorbers for high performance fully printable mesoporous PSCs based on TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon architecture. Significantly, we found that the bandgap and the exciton binding energy of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite increases with Cs content. A PCE of 17.02% was achieved for Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 based device with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.4 mA cm−2 and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1008 mV under standard AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. We further studied the charge transport and recombination process of Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 based devices in detail. We attributed the highly efficient PCE of Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 based devices to the long electron and hole diffusion lengths of ∼140 nm and ∼1.9 μm, resulting in an enhancement of charge collection and decreased charge recombination. The Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95–PbI2.8Br0.2-based PSCs exhibit good stability with a retention of over 90% initial PCE after 1020 h in dark condition at 85 °C.

The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is an index to predict the perovskite structure and can be an indication of the crystal-structure transition and stability. Detailed illustration about the expression of t can be observed in ESI. We first evaluated the t values for the perovskite compounds by varying the ratio of FA/MA and Cs/(MA + FA) (in which MA/FA = 3/2), as shown in Fig. 1. The t value increases with FA content. The t values are in the range of 0.9–1 for various FA/MA ratios. However, increase in the ratio of Cs/(MA + FA) would decrease t values of perovskite compounds. Therefore, we selected the ratio of 0–0.2 for Cs/(MA + FA) in the compound for device optimization. The detailed information about optimization of the ratio of FA/MA and PbBr2/PbI2 is presented in Fig. S1 and Table S1 and S2.


Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 (0 < x ≤ 0.2). A blue-shifted absorption onset was observed as the Cs content increased. This would lead to the contraction of the perovskite unit cell, which may result from the stronger electrostatic interaction of Cs+ and halogen anion. The bandgap Eg for Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 at x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 was evaluated to be 1.567, 1.578, 1.594 and 1.607 eV (Fig. S2), respectively. Fig. 2b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2. The up-shifted angle, as shown in Fig. S3, for the films containing Cs can be ascribed to the shrunken crystalline lattice wholly caused by the factor of Cs doping. Furthermore, all scattering patterns exhibited typical peaks at ∼14.0° and ∼28.0°, corresponding to the planes of (110) and (220), indicating that these materials have similar crystalline structures assignable to the perovskite system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to examine the thermal stability of these Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite species with different Cs contents under nitrogen flow. The increase in the decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss in nitrogen with Cs in the Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 (Fig. 2c) implies that the thermal stability can be significantly improved by Cs doping. Solar cells can benefit from such stable optoelectronic active materials. We further evaluated the exciton binding energy of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) by simulating the spectrum near the band-edge according to Elliott's formula (Fig. S4). We found the fitted values of exciton binding energy (Rex) for Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 to be 8.0, 9.0, 9.3 and 10.1 meV for x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2, respectively (Fig. 2d and Table S3). Interestingly, it is worth noting that binding energies for Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite are smaller than those of MAPbI3 (∼13.0 meV, Table S3). The Rex values of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 are lower than the thermal energy (∼25 meV) at room temperature, indicating full ionization of the excitons under the operating condition. Fig. 2e shows the schematic of the partial replacement of FA+ (or MA+) with Cs+.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectrum (ns-TAS) measurement was further performed to investigate the influence of Cs doping on perovskite charge carrier recombination kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, after excitation with ns-laser pulse, two photo-induced bleaching (PB) negative peaks at around 480 nm and 760 nm and one photo-induced absorption (PA) positive peak between 500 and 600 nm were observed. The PB negative peak (around 480 nm) arises from the electron population in the conduction band of perovskite. The PA positive peak in the range 500–600 nm can be assigned to the transition of the inter-band. The featured PB negative peak around 760 nm can be assigned to ground-state bleaching caused by band-filling, as well as a possible contribution from stimulated emission. The intensity of the PB peak around 760 nm obviously increases for the 0.05 Cs doped film. It indicates that the bleach recovery can be slowed down, suggesting less recombination due to the small doping content of Cs. To study the effects of different Cs content on the lifetime of the perovskite film on the glass substrate, the bleaching kinetics decay at PB peaks for the glass/FA0.4MA0.6PbI2.8Br0.2, glass/Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2, glass/Cs0.1(FA0.4MA0.6)0.9PbI2.8Br0.2 and glass/Cs0.2(FA0.4MA0.6)0.8PbI2.8Br0.2 films after excitation at 500 nm were measured as shown in Fig. 3c. The lifetime is fitted using a single exponential function. As shown in Table 1, the lifetime for glass/FA0.4MA0.6PbI2.8Br0.2, glass/Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2, glass/Cs0.1(FA0.4MA0.6)0.9PbI2.8Br0.2 and glass/Cs0.2(FA0.4MA0.6)0.8PbI2.8Br0.2 were found to be 364, 469, 362, 221 ns, respectively. Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 had the longest lifetime, indicating that electrons and holes can be effectively extracted by the charge selected layer. However, as shown in Fig. 3d, adding more Cs content (x > 0.05) decreases the lifetime presumably due to the worse crystallization of the perovskite.

SEM image of a mesoscopic perovskite solar cell using the TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon architecture. The n-type TiO2 and p-type NiO layers are used for corresponding charge extraction and transport while the Al2O3 layer serves as the spacer layer between them to realize a P–I–N metal oxide framework configuration. Fig. 4c shows the cross-section SEM image of the Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 based solar cell and the corresponding distribution of different components (Ti, Al, Ni, C, Pb, Cs, I) by mapping-scan analysis of the EDX map on the cross section. This obviously suggests the clear interfaces and thicknesses of different layers (TiO2, Al2O3, NiO and carbon layer), which can distinguish each layer in the cross sectional SEM image and the distribution of the perovskite. The homogenous distribution of Pb, Cs, and I elements among various layers represents the successful permeation of the Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite from the upper layer to the bottom layer.
Photovoltaic experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 based devices using the abovementioned device architecture. All devices were fabricated by keeping the TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon film at a constant thickness (TiO2 ∼460 nm, Al2O3 ∼450 nm, NiO ∼800 nm and carbon ∼10 μm).Fig. 4d shows the J–V curves of device A (FA0.4MA0.6PbI2.8Br0.2) and device B (Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2) measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Their corresponding photovoltaic parameters of Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCEs are listed in Table 2. Device A exhibited a PCE of 14.88% with a Jsc of 22.31 mA cm−2, Voc of 953 mV and FF of 0.70, while device B exhibited a PCE of 17.02% with a Jsc of 23.40 mA cm−2, Voc of 1008 mV and FF of 0.72. An improvement of FF and Jsc by 5.2% and 4.7% was observed when the Cs content changed from 0 to 0.05. In addition, the Voc of device B with x = 0.05 Cs doping content was also 55 mV higher than that of device A. The enhanced Jsc of device B could be mainly due to the fast charge transport property, which is on account of the high crystallinity of Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2. This was further confirmed by transient photocurrent decay measurements. The enhanced Voc of device B mostly contributed to the reduced electron recombination, which is further discussed in following characterizations. Device B showed negligible hysteresis with a forward scan PCE of 16.73% and a reverse scan PCE of 17.02% as shown in Fig. S5a and Table S4.Fig. 4e shows the corresponding EQE and integrating current curves for devices A and B. Both devices exhibit a wide range of photocurrent response with EQE values of about 85% from 400 nm to 600 nm. Compared to device A, device B shows higher EQE values in the long wavelength range above 600 nm, explaining the higher photocurrent for this device. Fig. S5b presents the J–V curves for devices with different Cs doping contents under standard AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, where Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 based devices with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 were named devices A–D, respectively. As x value further increased to 0.1 and 0.2, the PCEs of devices C and D diminished to 10.57% and 7.64%, respectively, due to the decrease in the Jsc, Voc, and FF (Table S5) values.

Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay measurements were further performed to understand the charge transport and recombination in these devices. Fig. 5a illustrates the charge carrier transportation process in the fully printable mesoporous structured device. As shown in Fig. S6a and b, the photocurrent decay and the transient photovoltage decay can be fitted with a bi-exponential function, indicating the presence of two distinguished populations of generated carriers, independently. This can be related to the ambipolar carrier transport properties of hybrid lead perovskite compounds. Fig. 5b compares the charge transport lifetimes for devices A and B. Device B shows faster carrier transport characteristics than that of device A. A fast charge transport ensures higher charge collection, principally delivering a high output photocurrent. This result properly explains an improvement of Jsc (1.09 mA cm−2) in device B. The electron and hole diffusion coefficients for device B with Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 were calculated to be ∼7.06 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 and ∼7.31 × 10−5, which are slightly higher than those for device A with FA0.4MA0.6PbI2.8Br0.2 (e: ∼3.54 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, h: ∼3.77 × 10−4 cm2 s−1), respectively.Fig. 5c presents the charge recombination lifetimes of devices A and B, which were obtained by fitting the transient photovoltage decay. These results could be caused by two distinguished populations of carriers recombining independently. We determined that the short lifetime (τr1) might be related to the charge recombination at the perovskite/carbon CE interface and the long lifetime (τr2) to the charge confined within the perovskite bulk layer recombining with TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5c, compared to device A, device B exhibits a longer lifetime constant of τr2, indicating that this device has less defect traps or less recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface. The electron diffusion length was further evaluated to be ∼140 nm for device B, which is longer than that of device A (70 nm). The hole diffusion length was further evaluated to be ∼1.9 μm for device B, which is longer than that of device A (950 nm). The electron and hole diffusion lengths were further evaluated based on the carrier diffusion coefficient and the recombination lifetime (τr1 and τr2 as shown in Fig. 5c) for device A and device B. Therefore, the augmented Voc of device B by 55 mV might be attributed to Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 having a large carrier diffusion length, which would increase the charge collection efficiency and decrease the chance of recombination. This was further confirmed using electronic impedance spectroscopy measurements (Fig. S7).
The stability issue has always been a critical concern for the commercialization of PSCs. The major factors affecting the stability of perovskite solar cells include moisture, thermal and light stimulation. High temperature may induce crystal structure transition in the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite. Herein, the thermal stability of the champion device with 0.05 Cs doping was evaluated. The device with simple encapsulation for thermal stability tests was aged at 85 °C with ∼40–60% humidity in dark condition. As shown in Fig. 6, the device employing Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 and mesoscopic TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/-carbon architecture exhibited excellent stability. Over the entire 1000 h test period, the photovoltaic parameters Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of the cell varied only slightly from the initial values. During the aging process, the device efficiency retained 91% of its initial value after 1000 hours. Such an impressively stable performance implies the robustness of the Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite itself as well as the perovskite/metal oxide heterojunction interface.

In summary, for the first time, we reported fully printable PSCs using a mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/C architecture with a Csx(FA0.4–MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 perovskite material, showing a champion PCE of 17.02%. The Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 based device exhibited long electron and hole diffusion lengths of ∼140 nm and ∼1.9 μm. The device also showed excellent thermal stability for 1020 h under thermal stress at 85 °C.


The device fabrication procedure can be referred to in our previous reports. In brief, Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2 was deposited onto the TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon mesoscopic porous film by a two step sequential method. First, 1.5 μL PbI2 (500 mg in 1 mL DMF with different Cs contents) was dropped onto the porous films. Then, the films were transferred to the hot plate at 70 °C. After drying for 30 min, the films were dipped into a solution of mixed MAI/FAI with a ratio of 3/2 dissolved in isopropanol (6.0/4.4 mg mL−1) for 13 min. The color of the film changed from yellow to black, indicating the successful formation of Csx(FA0.4MA0.6)1−xPbI2.8Br0.2. After that, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. All the procedures above were completed in air with 20–40% relative humidity.
