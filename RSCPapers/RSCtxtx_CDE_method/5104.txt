Due to their fabulous performance, porphyrins are considered to be emerging materials for dye-sensitized solar cell applications (DSSCs). Herein, we have designed and synthesised four novel porphyrin sensitizers tethered with a triphenylimidazole group as the donor, a porphyrin macrocycle as the π-spacer and 4-ethynyl phenyl (LG15), 5-ethynylthiophene (LG16), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD)-phenyl (LG17), and BTD-thiophene (LG18) as auxiliary acceptors and either a carboxylic acid or cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group, which resembles the structure of a donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A). The absorption spectra of LG17 and LG18 are red-shifted, when compared to LG15 and LG16, due to the presence of extended π-conjugation of the BDT group in its molecular structure. The red-shifted absorption spectra of LG17 and LG18 result in highest efficiency of 10.11% and 10.51%, respectively. Optical and electrochemical properties, and Density Functional Theory calculations of LG15–LG18, suggested that LG18 exhibits strong absorption and optimized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) aids the injection of electrons very effectively from the excited state of the dye into the TiO2 conduction band. Both LG17 and LG18 exhibit broad incident to photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the onset extends up to 950 nm, with >80% at 700 nm. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of LG15–LG18 revealed that LG17 and LG18 exhibit highest short-circuit current density of 20.64 and 21.43 mA cm−2 resulting in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.11% and 10.51%, respectively, in a liquid I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte. Bulky donor groups, π-spacer length and anchoring groups have significantly contributed to achieving high efficiency in a liquid redox shuttle that can be helpful to make efficient DSSCs for future generations. We have adopted intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy and nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectroscopy to explain the PCE and molecular structure relationship of the LG15–LG18 sensitizers.

Porphyrins are ubiquitous in nature and have found many applications such as donor–acceptor systems for bio-mimicking of natural photosynthesis, catalysis of organic transformations, electrocatalytic water splitting, sensitizers for photodynamic therapy, dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells, etc. Of these, we are particularly interested in porphyrin-based dyes for dye-sensitized solar cell applications (DSSCs). DSSCs are fascinating because of their beneficial capability of converting solar energy into electricity with comfortable fabrication which leads to economically viable production. In DSSCs, the sensitizer is one of the vital components because it harvests the light, i.e., absorption of light by the sensitizer followed by ejection of an electron, then injection into the TiO2 conduction band, the passage of the respective electron to the corresponding electrode, and yielding of a photocurrent in the external circuit. The extensively used sensitizers are Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes with certified efficiency of >11%. However, Ru dyes have their own limitations, i.e., the scarcity of Ru metal in the earth's crust, effort in synthesis and purification, and a lack of absorption at the near-IR region of the absorption spectrum. For this reason, researchers have continuously rendered their efforts towards the development of novel sensitizers to further improve the Photon Conversion Efficiency (PCE). The essential requirements for the development of efficient dyes are: (a) firstly, the dye should adhere to the TiO2 conduction band, (b) LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals) should be higher than the TiO2 conduction band and HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals) lower than that of the redox electrolyte for the regeneration of the oxidised dye, and (c) finally, the dye must have broad absorption from visible to the near-IR region for harvesting the maximum light from the sun.

A great variety of metal-free organic dyes have been designed based on triarylamine, coumarin, perylene, indoline, cyanine hemocyanin, tetrathiafulvalene, carbazoles, and diketopyrrolopyrrole scaffolds using donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) architecture. But these dyes are also unable to show broader absorption. In this regard, porphyrins are found to be alternative sensitizers for DSSC applications based on their optical, thermal and electrochemical properties. Moreover, the optical and electrochemical properties can be tuned by introducing substituents either at the meso-phenyl position or at the β-pyrrole position. The most common porphyrin sensitizers used for DSSCs have meso-substituted benzoic acid linking groups. In 2000, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin was reported to have a PCE of 3.5% under low light intensity. Later, Grätzel and co-workers changed the design strategy by functionalizing the anchoring group at the β-pyrrole position with Zn metallation and reported a PCE of 7.1%. To achieve the highest efficiency a continuous effort has been made on structural modifications at the meso positions of porphyrin macrocycles with a D–π–A approach. By this approach, the porphyrin sensitizers have crossed 10% PCE. But, π–π stacking between the porphyrins causes aggregation on the TiO2 surface, which may affect further improvement of the PCE. To smooth the way for the enhanced conversion of sunlight into energy, the dye must have less aggregation. For this reason, Grätzel and co-workers have developed octyloxy-enveloped constructions at the meso phenyl position of a D–π–A porphyrin, employing a benzothiadiazole (BTD) as an auxiliary acceptor allied between a π spacer and a carboxylic acid (SM315), reporting a top score efficiency of 13% using a Co(II/III) redox couple. With the inclusion of bulky donors and long octyloxy chains, porphyrins have improved in solubility, reducing the π–π stacking of the dyes as well as a reduction in the unfavorable charge recombination between injected electrons in the TiO2 and the redox couple in the electrolyte, which impacts on the PCE of the dye.
However, in the D–π–A approach the π-spacer and acceptor groups explore not only the light harvesting ability but also enhance the rate of electron injection and binding capacity on the TiO2 surface. In this view, we have constructed a series of D–π–A based porphyrin sensitizers, in which we have incorporated butterfly-conformation 3-ethynyl-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine as a donor, with various acceptor moieties, and achieved a PCE of 10.20%. Recently, we further re-designed porphyrin sensitizers by introducing a more bulky phenanthroimidazole moiety as a donor with efficient changes on its substituents, which exhibited a PCE of 7.45% and co-sensitization with an organic dye has shown a PCE of 8.27%. In order to promote the efficiency of the device, there will be an efficient donor with non-planarity with integration of auxiliary acceptors between the porphyrin macrocycle and π-spacers necessary for the D–π–A approach. Thus, the porphyrin dyes fill the absorption gap between the Soret and Q bands, which avoids the co-sensitization approach.
In the present work, we have designed and synthesised novel non-planar triphenylimidazole donor-based porphyrin sensitizers, which are linked to different acceptor groups (Chart 1). By this rational approach of synthesis, there is systematic improvement in the open circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current (JSC), thus pursuing high efficiency for DSSC applications. As shown in Chart 1, the porphyrin moiety was protected by octyloxy groups; these may diminish the unwanted charge recombination process between the iodine/triiodide redox shuttle and the oxidized dye. Triphenylimidazole has non-planarity in its structure, and it is a good electron donor linked to the meso-position of the porphyrin through an ethnyl bridge in all sensitizers (LG15–LG18). The donor also participates in the suppression of aggregation due to its non-planar nature. All of the four porphyrins were differentiated only by the acceptor groups attached between the porphyrin macrocycle and anchoring group. To understand the effect of π-spacers in the DSSCs, we have introduced phenyl, (LG15) and thiophene (LG16) moieties tethered as π-spacers, and carboxylic acid as an anchoring group. To gain the long wavelength response, LG17 and LG18 have the BDT moiety as the auxiliary acceptor between the porphyrin core and the π-spacer (phenyl) carboxylic acid (LG17), and π-spacer (thiophene) cyanoacrylic acid (LG18).

We procured all commercially available chemicals and reagents from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck and they were used without any further purification. All the reactions were done with analytical reagent (AR) grade solvents and laboratory reagent (LR) grade solvents were used for purifications and column chromatography. Dichloromethane, chloroform, and acetonitrile were dried in the presence of calcium hydride under nitrogen atmosphere followed by distillation. Hexane, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran were purified by stirring overnight with Na metal added to benzophenone, then distilling under a vacuum and storing over 4 Å molecular sieves. Triethylamine was distilled over NaOH pellets. Column chromatography was carried out using ACME silica gel (60–120 mesh) and thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck-precoated silica gel 60-F254 plates. Either gravity or flash chromatography was performed for purification of all compounds. All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen or argon atmosphere using dry and degassed solvents.

1H NMR spectra were obtained at 300 MHz using a Bruker 300 Avance NMR spectrometer running X-WIN NMR software and the chemical shift is relative to the tetramethylsilane (TMS), CDCl3, and pyridine D5 used as the internal references. The elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar, Vario MICRO CUBE analyzer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Shimadzu Biotech Axima Performance 2.9.3.20110624: Mode Reflectron-HiRes, power: 85. Major fragmentations are given as percentages relative to the base peak intensity. Differential pulse and cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed on a system controlled CH instruments model CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were performed on a 1 mM sample solution in tetrahydrofuran solvent at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was glassy carbon, a standard calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire was the counter electrode. After a cyclic voltammogram (CV) was recorded, ferrocene was added, and the other voltammogram was measured. Using the same instrument, a CH instruments model CHI 620C electrochemical analyser, the spectroelectrochemical studies were measured using a three-electrode configuration of a thin layer quartz spectroelectrochemical cell at 25 °C. A Pt gauge was the working electrode and a Pt wire was the counter electrode. The SCE reference electrode separated from the bulk of the solution by a double bridge was used. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e instrument was used for the thermogravimetric measurements at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with 10 mg of sample.


The absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu (Model UV-3600) spectrophotometer at concentrations of 1 × 10−6 M for Soret band and 1 × 10−5 M for Q band absorption. A Spex model Fluorolog-3 was used for steady state fluorescence spectra for solutions having an optical density at the wavelength of excitation (λex) ≈ 0.15. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer. Briefly, the samples were excited at 650 nm and the emission was monitored at 700 nm. The count rates employed were typically 103 to 104 s−1. DAS-6 software was used for the deconvolution of the data, which was carried out by the method of iterative reconvolution of the instrument response function and the assumed decay function. Standard statistical tests were employed to judge the goodness of fit of the experimental data to the assumed decay function.


All of the optimized geometries for LG15–LG18 were stable in their conformation by means of global minimum energy, which were carried out using the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-31(d,p) basis set as the input. Further calculations were done using Gaussian 09 (RevisionB.01) ab initio quantum chemical software on a personal computer. Ground state properties like energy-minimized structures and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) were implemented using Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the gas phase. Excited state properties like percentage of molecular contribution, oscillatory strength, and singlet transition energy were executed using Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) in tetrahydrofuran solvent. TDDFT calculations to describe the solvation of the dyes in tetrahydrofuran were carried out using the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (PCM) within the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) theory. Simulation of the major portions of the absorption spectra and interpretation of the nature of transactions were carried out by employing the software Gauss Sum 2.2.5. The contributing percentages of individual units present in the dyes to the respective molecular orbitals were calculated.


Generally the DSSC devices were fabricated using a TiO2 nanoparticle-based working electrode and Pt-coated counter electrode. The procedures for the synthesis of the TiO2 electrode and fabrication of the solar cells for the photovoltaic calculations were espoused from previous procedures. For the working electrode, the paste composed of a transparent TiO2 nanoparticle layer (∼20 nm diameter) was screen printed onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate (transmission >85% in the visible, sheet resistance 10 Ω cm−2). The required thickness (8 μm) and cell area (0.25 cm2) were obtained by repetitive screen printing. Subsequently, an additional scattering layer made of anatase TiO2 particles of 5 μm thickness (∼400 nm in diameter) was screen printed onto the active transparent layer to improve the device performance. Then the screen printed double layer was sintered at 500 °C for 1 h in the presence of oxygen. A Surfcom 1400A surface profiler (Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd) was used to measure the thickness of the films. To coat the TiO2 film, the dye was dissolved in 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol at 0.2 mM concentration. To these dye dissolved solutions, the prepared TiO2 films were immersed and kept at 25 °C for 15 h, so the dye was loaded onto the TiO2 films. The presence of water in the pores of TiO2 causes reduced injection efficiency of the dye. Therefore, to avoid rehydration of the TiO2 surface or capillary condensation of water vapours from ambient air inside the film, the dye was coated immediately onto the TiO2 after the high-temperature annealing. The electrode was dipped into the dye solution while it was still hot (80 °C). After complete adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface, the photoelectrode was removed from the solution, and the non-adsorbed dye was removed by washing with acetonitrile under a stream of dry air or argon. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by spin coating of H2PtCl6 solution onto the FTO conducting glass substrate and heating to 385 °C for 15 min. The dye-coated TiO2 film and thermally platinised FTO conducting glass counter electrode were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame at 100 °C. Finally, the DSSC cells were assembled using the electrolyte solution consisting of a mixture of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.1–0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. A black metal mask with an area of 0.25 cm2 under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan) was used to measure the current–voltage characteristics. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons per cm2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki).


The photovoltaic response induced by the modulated light was studied using intensity-modulated photo voltage spectroscopy (IMVS). A potentiostat (Solartron1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron1255B) at an open-circuit condition, based on a monochromatic illumination (420 nm) controlled by Lab view system, was used to measure the IMVS. The modulated light was driven with a 10% AC perturbation current superimposed on a DC current in a frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz. The charge extraction method (CEM) was performed with the same monochromatic light source. The solar cell was illuminated at an open-circuit condition for 5 s to attain a steady state and then the light source was switched off when the device simultaneously switched to a short-circuit condition to extract the charges generated at that light intensity.


A laser flash photolysis spectrometer (model LP920, Edinburgh) was used. It was associated with a continuum Nd-YAG laser (Surelite; 10 Hz repetition rate; FWHM 5 ns). A Surelite optical parametric oscillator permits conversion of the second harmonic to a visible spectrum of 400–820 nm. The respective dyes were excited at 445 nm. The excited state decay of the dye and the recovery of its fundamental state were monitored by the change in the absorbed continuous wave light. Satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio was obtained by averaging absorption spectra for 100–200 laser shots.


The synthetic scheme of the novel porphyrin sensitizers is illustrated in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 & 2 were synthesized by adopting procedures reported elsewhere in the literature. The crucial intermediate 3 was obtained by conducting a Sonogoshira coupling reaction between compounds 1 and 2 using Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI reagents. Compound 3 was deprotected with the help of tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution (TBAF) and further coupling reactions were carried out with respective bromo or iodo aromatic acids by using AsPh3 and Pd2(dba)3 reagents. Finally, the desired sensitizers were obtained by silica gel column chromatography purification. All of these sensitizers were fully characterized by elemental analyses, MALDI-TOF-MS, 1H NMR, IR, UV-visible, fluorescence spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods including spectroelectrochemical studies. The elemental analyses of all four sensitizers were found to be satisfactory (see Experimental section). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of LG15 showed a peak at m/z = 1576 (C102H10N6O6Zn6), LG16 at m/z = 1582 (C100H104N6O6Zn), LG17 at m/z = 1710 (C108H108N8O6Zn), and LG18 at m/z = 1769 (C109H107N9O6S2Zn) which was ascribable to their corresponding molecular ion peaks (see Fig. S1–S12, ESI). 1H NMR spectra of LG15–LG18 sensitizers are shown in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI).


For the newly synthesized porphyrin sensitizers, the optical properties were measured in THF solvent and the absorption spectra of LG17 & LG18 are depicted in Fig. 1. The corresponding wavelengths of the absorption maxima (λmax) and logarithm of molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the sensitizers are presented in Table 1. The new porphyrins exhibit an intense Soret band at around ∼460 nm and less intense Q bands (550–750 nm). The Soret band is an a1u(π)/eg(π*) electronic transition, allocated to the second excited state (S2), and less intense Q bands coined from the a2u(π)/eg(π*) electronic transition, attributed to the first excited state (S1). In LG15 and LG16 the absorption maxima of the Soret bands are found be at 459 and 457 nm, and the Q bands are found at 665 and 667 nm, respectively. The change of the auxiliary π-spacer phenyl group (LG15) to the thiophene group (LG16) has not much effect on the absorption maxima. Whereas in the case of LG17 and LG18, more redshift in both the Soret and Q band was observed due to incorporation of the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BDT) moiety as the π-spacer between the porphyrin ring and acceptor group, which explains the panchromatic behaviour of the BDT moiety. The drastic redshift in LG18 is predominantly due to the BDT moiety that we discussed earlier, heteroatomic (thiophene) π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group, suggesting efficient intramolecular charge transfer (CT) behaviour from the donor triphenylimidazole group (Fig. S13, ESI). The changes in the absorption spectrum are due to the elongation in π-conjugation and loss in symmetry is the significant strategy for broadening the light-harvesting area of porphyrin dyes. When compared to 5,10,15,20-(tetra phenyl)porphyrinato zinc(II) (ZnTPP), the present dyes show broadened and enriched ε values, due to the extended π-conjugation and non-planarity. The simulated absorption spectra of LG17 & LG18 obtained from TDDFT calculations are illustrated in Fig. 1. In addition to this, the optical study was performed by adsorbing LG15–LG18 sensitizers onto the surface of the TiO2 film (Fig. 2). The emission spectra of all four porphyrin sensitizers were measured in THF solvent at room temperature and Fig. 1 illustrates the representative emission spectra of LG17 & LG18. The corresponding emission maxima and quantum yields are presented in Table 1. In comparison with reference compound ZnTPP, the quantum yields of all four sensitizers are enhanced (Table 1). When compared to LG15 and LG16, the emission maxima of LG17 and LG18 show further red-shift, which is due to the incorporation of the BDT moiety between the porphyrin macrocycle and acceptor group. This indicates that the electronic coupling between the anchoring carboxylic acid group in LG17 and cyanoacrylic acid group in LG18 with the porphyrin ring was more effective. When all of the porphyrin dyes (LG15–LG18) adsorbed onto the 6 μm thick TiO2 layer the emission spectra were found to be quenched, as a consequence of electron injection from the singlet state of porphyrin into the conduction band of TiO2. The singlet state excited lifetimes of all four porphyrin sensitizers were measured in THF solvent (Fig. S16, ESI) and were found to be 0.86, 0.87, 1.67, and 1.77 ns for LG15, LG16, LG17, and LG18, respectively. When all of the four porphyrin dyes adsorbed onto the 6 μm thick TiO2 layer, the singlet excited lifetime was also found to be quenched. The singlet state energies (E0–0) of all four porphyrin sensitizers, calculated from emission and excited spectra, were found to be 1.87, 1.85, 1.81, and 1.76 eV for LG15, LG16, LG17, and LG18, respectively.

In order to evaluate the HOMO–LUMO levels of the present sensitizers, we measured redox potentials by adopting a cyclic voltammetry technique in THF solvent using a 0.1 M solution of TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte with an Fc/Fc+ couple as the internal reference. Fig. 3 illustrates the cyclic voltammograms of all four sensitizers and the corresponding redox values are presented in Table 1. Each sensitizer undergoes two reversible one electron oxidations and one quasi-reversible reduction. From Fig. 3, it is suggested that all four sensitizers have an oxidation potential at ∼0.66 V vs. SCE irrespective of the auxiliary acceptor. The oxidation of these sensitizers are more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple, which demonstrates effective regeneration of the sensitizer by the reduced redox couple. The excited state oxidation potential (EOX*) of the newly designed porphyrins was calculated using the equation EOX* = EOX − E0–0, and was found to be more negative than the TiO2 conduction band (−0.57 V vs. NHE), which demonstrates that the efficient injection of an electron from the excited dye to TiO2 is viable (Table 1). The active dye regeneration and electron injection on TiO2 in dye-sensitized systems are energetically favourable for the present dyes, which is evidently explained by an energy level diagram of the LG15–LG18 dyes (Fig. 4). The favourable band gap of LG17 and LG18 may efficiently inject an electron into the TiO2 conduction band and dye regeneration by taking an electron from the redox couple, which may favour high efficiency. The reduction potential of these porphyrin sensitizers was found to be ∼−0.95 V vs. NHE (see ESI).

Once the sensitizer becomes excited by absorbing the photons, there is an injection of an electron into the TiO2 from the excited state sensitizer and the sensitizer is oxidised. To gain further knowledge on the electrochemical properties of the oxidised species, spectroelectrochemical studies were performed under controlled oxidation potential. Fig. 5 illustrates the spectral changes of the LG18 dye at an applied potential of +0.94 V vs. NHE. From Fig. 5, it is observed that the absorption of the Q band at 695 nm gradually decreases in its intensity. The same trend was observed in the Soret band at 446 nm by a decrease in its intensity with bathochromic shift and the formation of a new band at 434 nm with an increase in its intensity. The oxidation of LG18 was clearly indicated by the formation of the isosbestic points at 440 and 615 nm, which tells us that there is formation of a single product. These distinctive deviations in the absorption spectra indicate the formation of the porphyrin cation. When the potential was changed to +0.2 V, there was no full recovery of the LG18 dye to its neutral form. This may be due to the degradation of the LG18 dye while it was standing in the prolonged spectroelectrochemical study. These characteristic changes indicate the formation of the porphyrin cation radical and are not metal centered. From all these aspects, one can say that the LG18 dye shows greater oxidative stability during spectroelectrochemical study, when compared to the standard Ru(II) sensitizer N719 under similar conditions, which is a pre-requisite during the operation of the photovoltaic device. The remaining porphyrin dyes also showed similar spectral changes and are presented in Fig. S19 (ESI).

The structural, electronic, and optical properties of the dyes LG15–LG18 were explained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations and were performed with a basic functional set at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The ground state optimized structures of LG15–LG18 including donor and acceptor moieties separated with a porphyrin ring through an ethynyl-π-bridge are presented in Fig. S18 (ESI). From these optimized structures, the three phenyl rings in the donor moiety give non-planarity to all of the porphyrin dyes. This leads to minimization of aggregation of the macrocycle in solution. Except for LG15, all of the dyes are non-planar in nature, due to incorporation of the heteroatomic thiophene moiety (LG16), and tethering of the BDT moiety between the porphyrin ring and phenyl carboxylic acid (LG17), and heteroatomiccyanoarylic acid (LG18).

The investigation of the HOMO and LUMO position and the electronic properties of the four porphyrin dyes were explained by using the B3LYP/6-31(d,p) method in THF solvent. Fig. 6 shows frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the LG15–LG18 dyes. The position of HOMO and LUMO in the present dyes explains the intramolecular charge separation by the electron transfer from donor to acceptor through the porphyrin framework. In LG15 and LG16, the electron population distribution of HOMO and LUMO is occupied partially on the donor, porphyrin and acceptor moieties and in LG17 and LG18 HOMO is occupied partially on the donor, porphyrin and acceptor moieties, and LUMO is occupied in the porphyrin macrocycle and acceptor moiety. For HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 the electron density is mainly on the porphyrin macrocycle in the case of LG15 and LG16, and in LG17 HOMO−1 it is present on the porphyrin ring only, but for LUMO+1 it is partially present on the porphyrin ring and more in the auxiliary acceptor. In HOMO−2 it is distributed mainly on the donor moiety, and in LUMO+2 it is located mainly on the acceptor group in the case of LG15 and LG16, but in LG17 it is fully present on the porphyrin ring, and in LG18 it is partially on the porphyrin and acceptor moieties. It is theoretically feasible that the electron transfer processes from the donor to acceptor group through the porphyrin macrocycle followed by the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. LG15 > LG16 > LG17 > LG18 is the order for the HOMO–LUMO gaps of these sensitizers. In addition to this, the TDDFT studies of these dyes were calculated by using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) for better understanding of the excited-state transitions with the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent with the M06-2X function. The experimental values are in good agreement with the obtained theoretical values. Singlet excited state properties of the dyes, like excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and theoretical absorbance, are listed in Table S2 (ESI).

All of the devices were fabricated by using standard mesoporous 8 μm thick TiO2 films and an acetonitrile based redox electrolyte (composed of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.1–0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP)) (Fig. S20 and S21, ESI). The meticulous fabrication method was described in our earlier studies.Fig. 7a depicts the photocurrent action spectra for LG15–LG18. The wavelengths of LG15 and LG16 showed two absorption maxima at ∼460 nm and ∼660 nm, which indicates the Soret and Q band absorbances. The wavelength at 460 nm showed an IPCE of 81% in LG15 and 68% in LG16 (Table 2). In the case of LG17 and LG18, the photocurrent action spectra were found to be at wavelengths of ∼500 nm and ∼700 nm with broad spectral response and both the Soret and Q bands were found to be merged. This is due to the integration of a BDT auxiliary group between the porphyrin ring and the anchoring group in LG17 and LG18 and the IPCE is at 80% and 82%, respectively (Table 2). These broad photocurrent action spectra may lead to a substantial increase in PCE. The onset wavelengths were red-shifted and extended up to ∼950 nm in the case of LG17 and LG18 and those of LG15 and LG16 were extended up to 800 nm. Fig. 7b describes the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of LG15–LG18 based DSSCs measured at simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in combination with a liquid electrolyte. The cell performance parameters such as open-circuit potential (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and energy conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. Among all the fabricated DSSCs, the phenyl π-spaced dye (LG15, JSC = 12.35 mA cm−2) showed enhanced JSC when compared to the thiophene π-spaced dye (LG16, JSC = 8.40 mA cm−2) and it may lead to the improved PCE in LG15 (η = 6.25%) compared to LG16 (η = 4.21%). This might be due to poorer electron injection from the excited state of LG16 than LG15 to the TiO2 conduction band, as this is evident in the IPCE spectra as well as in recombination. On the other hand, in the case of LG17 and LG18, the introduction of the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BDT) group between the porphyrin macrocycle and anchoring group resulted in a PCE of 10.11% in LG17 and 10.51% in LG18. The greater efficiency in LG18 compared to LG17 is due to the incorporation of the powerful electron withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid group, which leads to improved cell performance parameters in LG18 (JSC = 21.43 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.68 V, η = 10.51%). Thus, the order of power conversion efficiencies (PCE) is found to be LG18 > LG17 > LG15 > LG16. From these results one can deduce that efficient porphyrin sensitizers can be designed by combining highly effective non-planar donors with π-conjugators having heteroatoms through a significant auxiliary acceptor coupling with a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group.

The addition of TBP to the liquid redox couple electrolyte has a key role in the conduction band edge shift of the semiconductor and device performance. The TBP concentration in the redox electrolyte can be standardized by adding various concentrations of TBP and studying the photovoltaic performance. Fig. 8a exemplifies the representative IPCE spectra of the LG18 sensitizer using various concentrations (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 M) of TBP. The IPCE percentage for all of the four sensitizers is given in Table 2, which indicates the negative nature of TBP on the IPCE (see Fig. S20, ESI). The negative effect of TBP is also observed in the J–V curves for the LG18 sensitizer (Fig. 8b), with TBP concentrations in the 0.1–0.5 M range and its parameters summarised in Table 2. By increasing the TBP concentration the VOC values are highly increased in all sensitizers (see Table 2 and Fig. S21, ESI). As the concentration of TBP increases from 0.1 M to 0.5 M, JSC decreases and there is an effect on the PCE of all sensitizers. Therefore, the optimum concentration of TBP is 0.1 M in the redox electrolyte.

In order to further understand the effect of VOC with divergence in molecular structure of the newly designed porphyrin dye-based DSSCs, we adopted a charge extraction method (CEM) first to measure the relative conduction band position of TiO2. Fig. 9 exemplifies VOC as a function of electron density for DSSCs fabricated with the newly designed porphyrin sensitizers. Fig. 9 suggests that VOC linearly increases as a function of electron density for all DSSC devices. This result indicates that the dyes’ contribution to the band edge shift is similar as the plots for all dyes overlap with each other, in spite of having various auxiliary acceptors between the porphyrin macrocycle and anchoring group. Consequently, the VOC is more likely dependent on charge recombination reactions rather than the molecular structures of the sensitizers. Accordingly, VOC for all DSSCs having LG15–LG18 dyes should be attributed to the extent of charge recombination, which is ultimately related to the electron lifetime (τ) in TiO2. We adopted intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy to measure τ. Fig. 10 shows the electron lifetime (τ) as a function of VOC. At a certain electron density, τ follows the following order: LG15 > LG16 > LG17 > LG18, which is in agreement with the order of decreasing VOC observed in the DSSCs. It can be clearly seen that LG15 and LG16 with small π-spacers showed a longer electron lifetime than LG17 and LG18 with larger π-spacers. The longer lifetimes observed for the LG15 and LG16 cells compared to the lifetimes observed for those of LG17 and LG18 suggest that both LG15 and LG16 may form a compact dye layer on the TiO2 surface, which reduces the concentration of I3− in the vicinity of the TiO2 surface, and thus suppresses the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 film with I3−.


DSSC interfacial kinetics, including charge injection from the π* orbitals of the anchoring group to the titanium 3d-orbital dye regeneration, etc., is one of the crucial steps for the DSSC performances. For this, a good overlap of these orbitals is mandatory. We adopted nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectroscopy to investigate and compare the transient kinetics between dye regeneration kinetics by the electrolyte, among the dyes on one side and their respective DSSC performance parameters on another side. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis, considered as an ideal tool for investigating DSSC interfacial kinetics in a nano-to-microsecond time range, is seen as a complementary tool with the IMVS method (used above) which measures the decay lifetime of injected electron recombination with I3− in a millisecond time range and above. To be noted here, we used a high laser intensity sufficient to record a suitable transient absorbance decay rate as has been also observed by the Grätzel group.

The transient optical signals (or transient absorption signals ΔOD) in Fig. 11 represent the concentration of the bleached ground states of the dye sensitizer (negative ΔOD), following injection of electrons from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The transient absorption decays of the LG15–LG18 dyes on TiO2, as shown in Fig. 11, were fitted using a general exponential decay function, y(ΔOD) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3) + y0, where A corresponds to amplitude, τ1 denotes the dye excited state relaxation time (a few to hundreds of ns); τ2 denotes the decay time due to dye regeneration by I− (100 ns to 10 μs) and τ3 denotes the decay time due to recombination with electrons injected into TiO2 (100 ns to ms). A good approach has been developed for a quantitative comparison of the data for the different dyes, with and without electrolytes. We use, instead, the weighted average of logarithmic lifetimes from a bi-exponential fit to the data
where
Ai is the fractional amplitude of each component.

In the presence of an LiI/I2 redox couple electrolyte, the fitting of the decays clearly led to fast and suitable dye regeneration half-times (τ1/2) of 1.30, 1.22, 1.31 and 0.28 μs, which prove efficient dye regeneration by the electrolyte redox system of the above organic dyes, respectively. This, in turn, allows a good collection of photoinjected electrons into the external circuit as shown in the PV performance table (Table 2). Also, the highest performance of LG18 is demonstrated in Table 2 (highest current collected and higher power efficiency) where it shows fastest dye regeneration (τ = 280 ns) with I−. The fast dye regeneration measured proves a good overlap between anchoring groups and TiO2 conduction. Thus, much higher current density collected or power efficiency would originate mostly from the best spectrum absorption overlap.
In addition, Daeneke et al. have established that quantitative dye regeneration (theoretical regeneration yield 99.9%) can be achieved with a driving force of 20–25 kJ mol−1 (ΔE ≈ 0.20–0.25 V). Based on Fig. 4 above, all respective dyes present driving forces higher than 0.25 V, which is greater than the redox potential of I−/I3−. Thus, a much higher driving force (more than 0.25 V vs. vacuum) as for the LG15–LG18 dyes would not necessarily make a difference, since above 0.25 V the dye regeneration process is diffusion controlled. We noted also a higher LUMO for LG16 than for LG18 (Fig. 4). This has not necessarily affected the current collected as dye regeneration driving forces do. Electron density as shown in the IMVS study above exhibits the same linear increase in the electron density as a function of VOC, which indicates that the respective dyes have the same conduction band edge of TiO2. This demonstrates that above a certain threshold, having a higher driving force (LUMO – TiO2-CB) does not necessarily allow the fastest electron injection.

In order to obtain information about the thermal stability of these sensitizers, we performed a thermogravimetric analysis. It is known in the literature that porphyrins and their metallo-derivatives are thermally stable.Fig. 12 illustrates the thermal behaviour of the LG18 sensitizer, and it is clear that the sensitizer is stable up to 150 °C. An initial weight loss (5%) observed up to 100 °C is due to removal of moisture. The weight loss after 150 °C is attributed to the removal of the carboxyl group. A similar trend was also observed in the other sensitizers (see Fig. S22, ESI). From this thermal data, these dyes are highly durable for longstanding outdoor applications.


We have designed and synthesised four novel push–pull porphyrin dyes with triphenylimidazole as the donor, a porphyrin macrocycle as the π-spacer and either carboxylic acid or cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group. They were systematically investigated as sensitizers for DSSCs. The tuning of the HOMO–LUMO band gap leads to suitable absorption and electrochemical properties by varying the auxiliary acceptor groups. The incorporation of the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) moiety between the porphyrin core and anchoring group (LG17 and LG18) showed extended π-conjugation which alters the electronic properties. As a result the valley present between the Soret and Q band is filled in the IPCE and the onset of wavelength extended to 950 nm, which eliminates the use of co-sensitization. The introduction of an auxiliary acceptor with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD), thiophene moiety and cyanoacrylic acid results in great device performance, i.e., IPCE of 82% at both 492 and 700 nm, open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.68 V, short-circuit current density JSC of 21.43 mA cm−2, fill factor of 0.71 and a power conversion efficiency of 10.51% under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The thermal studies indicate that these dyes were stable up to 150 °C and suitable for rooftop applications. Finally, these results provide a fruitful base for further investigation, to achieve a PCE greater than 13% without using a co-sensitizer.
