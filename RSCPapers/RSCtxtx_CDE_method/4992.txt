A molecular donor of intermediate dimensions based on dithienogermole (DTG) as the central electron rich unit, coded as DTG(FBT2Th2)2, was designed and synthesized for use in bulk heterojunction, solution-processed organic solar cells. Under optimized conditions, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.1% can be achieved with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor semiconductor component.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells comprise an energy conversion technology that offers the potential to fabricate light-weight, cost effective and flexible devices via solution deposition techniques. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of conjugated polymer-based OPVs now surpass the 10% mark. Structurally-precise molecular donors provide certain advantages over polymeric counterparts, including absence of batch-to batch variations and higher levels of purity. These features have led to substantial progress in the development of solution processable high PCE small molecules (SMs) that balance morphology constraints, optoelectronic requirements, interfacial processes, and ease of solar cell fabrication.

Conjugated polymers with dithienogermole (DTG) structural units in the backbone have been designed, synthesized and used to fabricate solar cells with efficiencies of up to 8%. The excellent performance of DTG-containing polymers has been attributed to the larger size of the germanium atom, relative to carbon or silicon, which favors π-stacking interactions. However, only two reports show the utility of DTG for the design of molecular donors in small molecule solar cell. Of particular relevance is to understand how molecular variations impact film forming tendencies and general organization within photovoltaic active layers prepared with such materials. In this communication, we provide the design and synthesis of a novel molecule donor of intermediate dimensions with DTG core, coded as DTG(FBT2Th2)2, which showed remarkable long range π–π ordering and an excellent PCE of up to 9.1%. Structural characterization of thin films reveals long range ordering of DTG(FBT2Th2)2 crystallites, which extends across micron-sized length-scales.
The chemical structure and synthesis of DTG(FBT2Th2)2 is shown in Fig. 1. This molecule can be described by the generic architecture D–A–D–A–D′–A–D–A–D architecture, where D (and D′) and A correspond to electron rich and electron poor fragments covalently linked to form an electronically conjugated overall unit. The preparation of DTG(FBT2Th2)2 begins by the synthesis of intermediate 2via Stille cross coupling reaction between 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylgermole-2,2′-bithiophene (1) and 4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT-Br2). Compound 3 was prepared by modification of procedures previously reported in the literature. DTG(FBT2Th2)2 was obtained by coupling of compounds 3 and 2. The 1H NMR spectrum and mass determination via field desorption time of flight measurements of the product are consistent with the proposed chemical structure (ESI). The solubility of DTG(FBT2Th2)2 at 60 °C, on the order of 35 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene and chloroform, is sufficient to enable spin casting from solution.

Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption spectra of DTG(FBT2Th2)2 in chlorobenzene and as a thin film after thermally annealing at different temperatures. In thin-film, DTG(FBT2Th2)2 shows two peaks at 630 and 680 nm. As a thin film, the absorption spectrum exhibits an onset of absorption (λonset) at 770 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of approximately 1.62 eV. Thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, −5.17 eV) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, −3.4 eV), from which one can estimate a gap of 1.77 eV. Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the thermal transitions, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A melting temperature (Tm) of 259 °C is observed, together with a weak transition at 214 °C, the origin of which remains unknown, but may relate to a polymorph transition (Fig. S1, ESI).
Photovoltaic properties of DTG(FBT2Th2)2 as the donor semiconductor were evaluated in a BHJ configuration by incorporating PC71BM as an electron acceptor. All the devices were operated under an inert atmosphere under an illumination of 100 W cm−2. The device architecture comprised of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/DTG(FBT2Th2)2:PC71BM (100 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm). Active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene with 5% chloroform and 0.4% diiodooctane (DIO) solvent additive. Optimal performance was obtained at a 1:1 weight ratio of DTG(FBT2Th2)2:PC71BM after annealing to 80 °C.

Fig. 3(a) shows the current (J) voltage (V) characteristics of the champion DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM device. Under optimized conditions, the blend shows a PCE of 9.1%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 15.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 73%.
The average performance values from evaluation of multiple devices are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI). The temperature dependence of PCE is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). The average PCE of the optimized devices is 8.8%, with the lowest recorded PCE being 8.6%. The measurements are based on the data of over 60 devices. In addition, DTG(FBT2Th2)2:PC71BM devices show excellent diode quality as determined by J–V measurements, with a series resistance (Rs) of 1.1 Ω and a shunt resistance (Rsh) of 3.9 Ω (Fig. S4, ESI). Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM device. The EQE value is on the order of 80% over the wavelength range of 550–700 nm.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image the topographic features of thin films. The images of neat DTG(FBT2Th2)2 films, prepared under conditions identical to those used for device fabrication show a fiber-like structure that covers the entire surface (Fig. 4a). A relevant feature of the topography is the presence of gaps that limit the continuity of the film. Fig. 5a shows the AFM image of DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM blend with a 1:1 ratio. Film coverage becomes homogenous after blending. Such features are desirable for device fabrication in order to avoid contacts between charge collection electrodes. The presence of crystalline domains in DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM films was probed via X-ray diffraction techniques. As shown in the ESI (Fig. S5), scattering peaks are observed in the out of plane direction that are consistent with π–π stacking separated by 0.35 nm and alkyl-stacking with separation of 1.48 nm. These observations are consistent with crystalline domains of DTG(FBT2Th2)2, a feature that is associated with phase separation of donor and acceptor domains. Moreover, there does not appear to be a preferential orientation of the domains, relative to in-plane vs. out of plane organizations of the molecular frameworks.
The extent of π–π ordering was examined by dark-field transmission electron microscopy (DF-TEM) using an aperture that probes the π–π lattice spacing. A set of DF-TEM images of a DTG(FBT2Th2)2 film was taken at three different angles (60, 120 and 180°). Using this approach allows one to image the regions of the film that contain crystallites with preferred orientation according to different directions. The obtained dark-field images as a function of different angles are shown in Fig. 4b–d. Regions of long-range π–π stacking cover nearly the entire sample. The remarkable ordering can also be seen from selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b–d), where the π–π stacking is diffracted into two narrow spots with a d-spacing of ∼3.5 Å. It is worth noting that over the increased camera length (inset of Fig. 4c), no new features in the SAED pattern could be observed, and there was no change in the anisotropic characteristics of neat DTG(FBT2Th2)2. The combination of Fig. 4(b–d) is shown as the composite RGB image in Fig. 4e. It is also noticed that despite the poorly ordered film quality and the presence of pinholes, the DF-TEM images show excellent continuity of crystallites.
A similar DF-TEM analysis was carried out on the DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM blends that performed best within a device configuration (Fig. 5b–d). DF-TEM images of the blend show that π–π ordering with length scales of approximately a micrometer is still maintained. The RGB composite TEM image (Fig. 5e) provides a perspective of the general orientation and aspect ratio of the ordered crystallite domains. Given the dimensions of the DTG(FBT2Th2)2 oriented phases, it is reasonable that the PC71BM content in the blend is distributed within these domains in order to effectively the percolation needed for electron transport and to effectively quench DTG(FBT2Th2)2 excitons.
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new solution-processable small molecule donor material, namely DTG(FBT2Th2)2, by incorporating a Ge-core electron rich unit in the interior of the chromophore. DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM based devices exhibit very high PCE values, up to 9.1%, which is very high for a small molecule donor and highest among all the Ge-based small molecules reported so far. Film characteristics are improved upon addition of PC71BM, as determined by AFM imaging. Moreover, in the DTG(FBT2Th2)2/PC71BM blends, one observes that the DTG(FBT2Th2)2 crystallites have their orientations aligned along micron length scales. To what degree such morphology is responsible for the efficient light harvesting and charge collection remains unclear, particularly because not all relevant structural features within the blend are understood; for instance the relative distribution of donor and acceptor domains and the content of the film that remains mixed. Moreover, the exact contribution of different phases to PCE remains an area of debate. Despite these uncertainties, DTG(FBT2Th2)2 provides an excellent opportunity to further probe poorly understood organizational tendencies in semiconducting soft matter and displays the potential to provide better performance upon device optimization.
