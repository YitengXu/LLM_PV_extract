Open-circuit voltage (Voc), as a key parameter, plays an important role in determining power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). With the rapid development in OSCs based on small molecules, more and more attention has been paid to fabricate photovoltaic devices with high Voc values by designing novel small molecule materials, which has pushed the highest Voc values for single-junction OSCs based on small molecules as donors or acceptors to be 1.12 V and 1.36 V, respectively. In this review, recent advances with respect to photovoltaic materials applied in OSCs featuring high Voc values will be summarized from two aspects: small molecule donors and small molecule acceptors. Moreover, we will systematically discuss the relationship between molecular structures of small molecule materials and Voc values for OSCs, which will provide a guideline on the design of organic small molecule materials for obtaining photovoltaic devices with high Voc values.

Depending on attractive features of low weight, flexibility and low cost, organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn considerable attention and been regarded as a promising technology for future clean energy supplies. At present, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which consists of p-type organic semiconductors as the electron donor and n-type organic semiconductors as the electron acceptor, has been a popular architecture of the active layer for OSCs. The work process of an OSC can be divided into four steps: (1) excitons will be formed when the active layer absorbs solar photons. (2) Excitons diffuse to the interface between the electron donor and electron acceptor, where free holes and electrons will be produced. (3) Via the donor and acceptor channels, holes and electrons transfer to the anode and cathode respectively. (4) Holes and electrons are collected by the corresponding electrodes, generating the electrical power.

Power conversion efficiency (PCE), as a most important index for measuring the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, is determined by the short circuit current (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) according to the relation: PCE = JscVocFF/Pin. During the past decades, owing to the remarkable progress made in the design of photovoltaic materials, interface engineering, as well as device optimization, PCEs up to 17% have been realized for OSCs to date.
However, by means of recent developments, OSCs are not enough for realizing commercialization, mainly due to limitation of PCEs and condition of device fabrication. One of the major factors in limiting PCEs for OSCs is their low Voc values, which are under half of the incident photon energy generally. Increasing Voc values of single BHJ OSCs conduces to the improvement of PCEs for OSCs, and will provide potential for future commercialization of tandem OSCs by reducing the number of single-junction cells to simplify device processing and cost, and fabricating high-voltage tandem OSCs for solar-to-fuel applications, such as water photolysis.

V
oc represents the maximum voltage that a solar cell can provide to an external circuit, and researches directing at the improvement of Voc have been on the rise. It is found that numerous factors have influence on Voc for OSCs, and some of the important factors are listed below. (1) Film morphology: tuning microstructure to gain fine domain size and purity, will contribute to prolong the charge carrier lifetimes and reduce combination losses, increasing Voc values. (2) Molecular orientations: preferred orientations of donor and acceptor materials can help decrease the interfacial disorder, which leads to the enhancement in Voc value. (3) Charge transfer states (CT states): increasing the dielectric properties of active layers appropriately, is in favor of reducing the bind energy of CT states through delocalizing the CT states, improving Voc values. (4) Defect states and crystallinity: Voc values for OSCs can also be raised by enhancing crystallinity of the film and decreasing defects. Other than that, D/A interface area, light intensity, temperature and electrode work function also affect Voc (Fig. 1).
Substantial studies have shown that Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor in OSCs. So, decreasing the HOMO level of donor or raising the LUMO level of acceptor enables the enhancement of Voc for OSCs. In contrast to polymer materials, small molecule materials having easy adjustment of energy levels, tend to generate higher Voc values when applied in OSCs. Designing novel small molecules for improving Voc values of OSCs, has been a hot research area. Recently, the best Voc value for single-junction OSCs based on small molecule donors have reached 1.12 V, while single-junction OSCs based on small molecule acceptors have obtained the best Voc of 1.36 V. So, it is proper time to summarize recent developments in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on small molecules with high Voc values. In this review, we will place emphasis on how molecular design and modification of small molecule materials affect Voc values for OSCs, and introduce current advances in designing small molecule materials to gain OSCs with high Voc values from the following two aspects: (1) high open-circuit voltage OSCs based on small molecule donors, (2) high open-circuit voltage OSCs based on small molecule acceptors.

With the goal of tuning energy levels and reducing band gaps, organic small molecule donors containing electron push–pull structures, in which electron-rich (D) units and electron-deficient (A) units are linked with π-conjugated bridges, have been widely developed, as shown in Fig. 2. In the past decade, researchers have designed and synthesized various types of small molecule donor materials, for example, D–π–A, D–π–A–A′, A–π–D–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, etc. Excitingly, devices based on small molecule donors have exhibited PCEs above 11%, and better PCEs will be promisingly shown in the future. It is known that high Voc values can be achieved by introducing small molecule donors with deep HOMO energy levels into active layers. In order to increase Voc values of OPV devices, substantial efforts have focused on decreasing HOMO energy levels of donors by adjusting D moieties, A moieties, π-linkages and side chains on conjugated backbones. In this part, we will summarize recent advances in structural design and modification of small molecule donors for OPV devices with high Voc values, which will be discussed in details from four aspects, including the selection of electron-donating unit, the selection of electron-withdrawing unit, π-bridge modulation as well as substituent group and side chain engineering.


In the alternated D–A system, selecting appropriate electron-donating moieties is crucial in controlling energy levels, and thus has a positive impact on achieving better photovoltaic performances, including high Voc values.


In 2013, Yang et al. developed two asymmetrically substituted squaraines using diisobutylamino and 9-carbazyl as electron-donating end cappers in 1a and 1b respectively (Fig. 3). In comparison with 1a, molecule 1b showed a lower HOMO energy level (−5.46 eV vs. −5.06 eV) due to relatively weak electron-donating capability of 9-carbazyl (Table 1). So, a higher Voc (1.12 V vs. 0.75 V) was achieved by the device based on 1b:PC71BM blend film, which was the highest value of single BHJ OSCs based on small molecule donors at that time. Notably, introducing 9-carbazyl to replace diisobutylamino had no negative effect on Jsc. Much broader absorption bands of 1b led to a higher Jsc (5.81 mA cm−2vs. 5.40 mA cm−2) and in turn a higher PCE (2.34% vs. 1.54%).

Two other similar molecules based on asymmetrical squaraine derivatives (2a, 2b) were reported by Yang et al. in 2014 and 2015 respectively. By virtue of the superior electron-donating ability and smaller steric hindrance relative to those of 9-carbazyl, indoline was chosen as D unit in 2a and 2b, which aimed to reduce bandgaps and improve Jsc. As expected, 2a possessed a low bandgap of 1.43 eV and more planar conformation, resulting in a high Jsc of 10.35 mA cm−2. However, PCE of 2a-based device was restricted by the low Voc of 0.83 V. In order to obtain a higher Voc, a cyano group was attached to the end-capping unit of 2a to synthesize 2b. After a cyano substitution, the decreased electron-donating capability of D unit in 2b contributed to a lower HOMO energy level of −5.20 eV, allowing for an increased Voc of 0.93 V. Moreover, stronger dipole–dipole interactions were found in 2b, which should be responsible for a higher hole mobility. Consequently, a better PCE of 5.00% was obtained by 2b-based device.
In 2015, Sharma and co-workers reported three D–A type molecules (3a–3c), in which carbazole as the D unit was connected to the meso position of BODIPY by the ethynyl linkage. They found that molecular HOMO levels were affected by different electron-donating strength of carbazole moieties. With the weakest electron-donating ability of D unit among the three, 3b showed the lowest HOMO level of −5.62 eV and gave a higher Voc of 1.08 V compared with 3a (0.94 V) and 3c (1.04 V). Chang et al. synthesized two carbazole-based D–A type donors (4a, 4b) with dicyanovinylene or 1,3-indandione as electron-withdrawing group in 2017. Deep HOMO levels were observed in both 4a and 4b, so high Voc values (1.01 V, 0.97 V) were achieved by the vacuum-deposited devices based on above molecules.
Ting et al. synthesized two novel D–A–A′ type molecules (5a, 5b) consisting of nitrobenzoxadiazole as an A–A′ unit, ditolylaminophenyl or ditolylaminothienyl as the D unit by a one-step coupling reaction. Because of the weaker electron-donating ability of benzene, 5b exhibited a lower HOMO level of −5.31 eV than 5a, thus yielding a higher Voc of 0.97 V. In addition, a red-shifted absorption relative to that of 5b was shown in 5a, resulting from more effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) which benefited from superior electron-donating capability and well quinoidal character of thiophene, hence the Jsc (12.4 mA cm−2) of the device based on 5a was higher than 5b (10.2 mA cm−2). On the whole, when blended with C70, 5a and 5b all achieved PCEs of over 5%, which outperformed other NO2-containing small molecules reported at that time.

Chen and co-workers, employing dithienosilole, benzodithiophene (BDT), fluorene and carbazole as central groups respectively, synthesized a series of molecules (6a–6d) with A–D–A type structures and studied the effect of different electron-donating units on molecular properties and photovoltaic performances. The distinct HOMO levels and similar LUMO levels of these molecules demonstrated that the central donor units in A–D–A type molecules predominantly affected HOMO levels. With this series, fluorene and carbazole having weak electron-donating strength, provided 6c and 6d with deeper HOMO levels (−5.23 eV, −5.14 eV), as well as high Voc values (1.07 V, 0.97 V). The results demonstrated that introducing weak electron-donating units into A–D–A type molecules could be a promising way to achieve high Voc values. Molecule 7 involving substituted carbazole as an electron-rich unit and 2-(4-nitrophenyl) acrylonitrile as an end-capping unit was synthesized by Singh et al. Similarly, considering a low-lying HOMO level of −5.34 eV, a high Voc of 0.96 V was obtained for molecule 7.

By inserting two naphthodithiophene isomers between two thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole units respectively, Loser et al. constructed molecule 8a and 8b. The nonlinear naphthodithiophene core in molecule 8b showed stronger electron-donating capability owing to the inhibition of conjugation caused by the nonlinear shape, which elevated the HOMO level of 8b. So, diverse Voc values were obtained, with a Voc of 0.84 V for 8a and a Voc of 0.76 V for 8b.
A series of A–D–A type molecules (9a–9c), whose structures were composed of alkylsilylethynyl benzodithiophene as the weak electron-rich core and different electron-withdrawing end groups, were proposed by Ko and co-workers. These molecules showed similar HOMO levels around −5.15 eV, indicating that HOMO levels of A–D–A type molecules mainly correlated with electron-donating units. All devices fabricated from 9a–9c produced high Voc values around 1.0 V.
Low hole mobility of the blend film as a key factor limited the photovoltaic performance of devices based on squaraine. Accordingly, Kido and co-workers presented two A–D–A type squaraine-based electron donors (10, 11) and applied them in OSCs, realizing the improvement of photovoltaic properties successfully. Benefiting from the extended π-conjugation systems caused by the incorporation of large planar weak electron-rich core, molecule 10 and 11 attained low optical bandgaps (1.36 eV, 1.49 eV), high hole mobility up to 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and maintained low-lying HOMO levels (−5.15 eV, −5.20 eV) as well. Both of devices based on molecule 10 and 11 showed outstanding photovoltaic performances, including high Voc values of 0.92 V and 0.94 V. Furthermore, after thermal annealing (TA) treatments, PCEs of them could be improved to 7.41% and 7.05% respectively. Notably, 11-based OPV device achieved a lower energy loss of only 0.56 eV, which was the first proposed photovoltaic application based on small molecule obtaining an energy loss below 0.6 eV with a high PCE over 7% and a Voc beyond 0.9 V.
Compared to those conjugated electron-donating units with heteroatoms, arylene (Ar) hydrocarbons can be deemed as weaker electron-donating moieties owing to their higher aromatic resonance stabilization energies. So, choosing arylene hydrocarbons as D units for organic small molecule donors is an effective approach to decrease HOMO levels and thus to improve Voc values of OSC devices. In 2012, 12a and 12b, in which thiophene or phenylene as the central unit was flanked by two thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units, were reported by Jo and co-workers. Phenylene has weaker electron-donating ability than thiophene, which favored 12b a deeper HOMO level of −5.31 eV than 12a, yielding a higher Voc of 0.93 V for 12b in OSCs. Subsequently, on the basis of 12a and 12b, Lee et al. selected (E)-1,2-di(thiophen-2-yl)ethene (TVT) or naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT) as electron-rich moieties to synthesize 13a and 13b. The relatively high Voc of 0.82 V acquired from 13b-based device, was attributed to the deep HOMO level of 13b, which correlated with the relatively weak electron-donating strength of NDT. For exploring the effect of different linkage positions of the arylene hydrocarbons on photovoltaic performances of A–Ar–A type molecules, two other DPP-based A–Ar–A type molecules (14a, 14b) with different substituted anthracenes (An) as central units were synthesized by Zhu and co-workers. In contrast to the 9,10-anthracene centered molecule 14a, molecule 14b containing 2,6-anthracene exhibited a remarkable red-shifted absorption, a higher HOMO level and a higher hole mobility due to its better planarity and more extended conjugation system. As a result, a outstanding PCE of 5.44% was observed in the device based on 14b:PC71BM blend film by adding 1% DIO additive. Even though the 14a-based device showed a poor PCE, a high Voc of 0.97 V was achieved by means of its low HOMO level of 14a.
In 2016, Gao et al. used phenylene and naphthalene as the core respectively, to give two A–π–Ar–π–A type molecules, namely 15a and 15b. Interestingly, both molecules showed the same HOMO level of −5.11 eV, but a much higher Voc of 0.98 V was obtained by the device based on 15b than that of 15a (0.90 V). It could be explained by other factors affecting Voc, including film morphology. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images revealed that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the 15b/PC71BM blend film (0.77 nm) was smaller than that of 15a/PC71BM (1.08 nm), resulting in more D/A interfaces in the 15b/PC71BM blend film, which reduced the electronic coupling between 15b and PC71BM to suppress the charge-transfer band oscillator strength and thus improved the Voc. Recently, Zhu and co-workers designed a series of A–π–Ar–π–A type molecules (16a–16c) comprising different arylene hydrocarbons as central cores respectively, which aimed to investigate the influence of extending Ar cores from phenylene (Ph), naphthylene (Nap) to anthrylene (An) on photovoltaic properties. With increasing the conjugation degree of Ar units from Ph, Nap to An, red-shifted film absorption, high hole mobility and balanced carrier mobility were observed, indicating that enlarging Ar rings could be an productive way to improve photovoltaic performances. The best PCE of 5.11% was obtained by the device based on 16c after adding 2% DIO additive. In addition, All of three molecule had deep HOMO levels around −5.25 eV, leading to high Voc values of 0.97 V, 0.98 V and 0.95 V, respectively, for 16a–16c.

Similarly, introducing weak electron-donating moieties into D–A–D type molecules could decrease HOMO levels, resulting in high Voc values. For example, in 2015, Vybornyi et al. developed two D–A–D type molecules (17a, 17b) which thienoisoindigo as electron-withdrawing core connected different electron-rich units with acetylene linkages respectively. As excepted, 17b, comprising N-phenylcarbazole as end-capping groups, achieved a high Voc of 0.99 V, which benefited from its deep HOMO level induced by the elevated oxidation potential.


Introducing suitable electron-deficient groups into small molecule donors could be effective in fine tuning HOMO and LUMO levels simultaneously, which would help to achieve deep HOMO levels and low band gaps, resulting in higher Voc and Jsc values in photovoltaic devices potentially.


Isoindigo (ID), as a strong electron-withdrawing unit, was introduced into a D–A–D type small molecule 18 consisting of triphenylamine as end-capping groups by Yang and co-workers in 2013. A high Voc of 1.0 V was achieved by 18-based device, arising from the low HOMO levels of −5.32 eV. Regrettably, the low Jsc value and poor FF led to a inferior PCE of 0.61%. With the aim of identifying a correlation between the chemical structures and photovoltaic properties of OSCs, Detrembleur and co-workers reported two branched small molecules (19a, 19b) containing benzothiadiazole (BT) and ID as the central electron-withdrawing moiety respectively. The HOMO level of 19b bearing ID unit was 0.13 eV lower compared to that of 19a, deriving from stronger electron-deficient character of ID, which gave rise to a relatively high Voc of 0.87 V for the device fabricated from 19b. Whereas in the case of PCEs, the device prepared using 19a:PC71BM = 1:0.8 was superior to 19b, which was mainly ascribed to the higher hole mobility and better crystallinity of the film based on 19a. Interestingly, diverse changes of photovoltaic performances were observed in both devices upon CHCl3 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatments. An improved PCE from 0.80% to 1.39% was found in the 19b-based device owing to the optimal morphology, while the considerable phase separation in the film of 19a observed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement led to a worse PCE of 0.40% (Fig. 4).

In 2017, Archet et al. designed a small molecule donor by choosing borondifluoride complex as the strong electron-withdrawing core and triphenylamine (TPA) as the end-capping unit, namely 20, which was the first proposed photovoltaic donor material based on borondifluoride complexes of curcuminoid derivatives. By optimizing the ratios of donor to acceptor and choosing the suitable solvent, the device based on 20:PC61BM (35:65, w/w) gave the best PCE of 4.14%, with a high Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 9.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.42 when choosing chloroform as the solvent. The high Voc was mainly due to the deep HOMO level of molecule 20 and better film morphology which decreased bimolecular recombination losses.
To achieve an outstanding photovoltaic performance including high Voc, Jsc and FF simultaneously, Chen and co-workers, introducing 1,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]-dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) as the central core which had extended co-planar framework and strong electron-withdrawing capability, proposed a small molecule 21. A low-lying HOMO level of −5.11 eV, a broad absorption ranging from 300 to 800 nm in the film, as well as a desirable fibril network morphology, helped the device based on 21:PC71BM blend film realize an excellent PCE of 9.23%, along with a high Voc of 0.96 V and a Jsc of 14.59 mA cm−2 after the thermal-solvent annealing (TSA) treatment.

In 2017, Kudrjasova et al. synthesized a series of small molecules (22a–22c) based on thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz) with strong electron-withdrawing character. These molecules, especially for two asymmetrical molecules (22b, 22c) comprising bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl or dicyanophenyl as end-capping A unit, all showed deep HOMO levels, which should account for high Voc values of devices based on 22a–22c.

In order to maintain the deep HOMO level and decrease the bandgap, Wang and co-workers reported a small molecule 23b by attaching additional alkyl cyanoacetate as electron-accepting units to the end groups of molecule 23a. In comparison to molecule 23a (−5.27 eV, −3.23 eV), a similar HOMO level of −5.30 eV and a decreased LUMO level of −3.55 eV were shown in molecule 23b, which contributed to a lower bandgap of 1.73 eV, yielding a relatively better PCE of 2.87% with a high Voc of 1.05 V.
In 2015, two A–π–D–π–A type small molecules (24a, 24b) having ethylhexyl-thiophene substituted benzodithiophene (TBDT) with various electron-withdrawing end groups were proposed by Wei and co-workers, which aimed to probe the effects of end-capping units on photovoltaic properties. Molecule 24b, bearing stronger electron-deficient 3-oxoundecanenitrile rather than octyl 2-cyanoacetate, provided a deeper HOMO level and a red-shifted absorption relative to those of molecule 24a. While molecule 24a had a higher hole mobility, which was explained by its stronger electron coupling. Devices based on 24a and 24b gave similar PCEs of 6.4% by adding 0.4% DIO additive, and 24a showed a higher FF of 0.72, whereas 24b exhibited a higher Voc of 0.92 V and Jsc of 10.2 mA cm−2.
In 2017, Komiyama et al. designed two A–D–A type small molecules 25a and 25b, in which tetrathienoanthracene (TTA) as the central unit, indandione and 2-(1,1-dicyanooctylene)rhodanine (CNRo) as the end-capping unit respectively. With varying the terminal group from indandione to CNRo in the order of increasing electron-accepting character, a deeper HOMO level was exhibited in 25b, which correlated well with its photovoltaic property with a high Voc of 0.97 V.
In 2017, Sharma and co-workers reported two Zn–porphyrin-centered A–π–D–π–A type molecules, containing cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the π-linkage and rhodanine or dicyanovinylene as terminal acceptors, namely 26a and 26b respectively. Unlike 26a, 26b showed not only a lower HOMO level of −5.36 eV, but also a broader intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption band, which was associated with the stronger electron-deficient capability of dicyanovinylene. Without any optimized treatments, devices based on 26a and 26b gained high Voc values of 0.90 V and 0.98 V respectively, but poor PCEs. The PCEs of devices was further increased to 6.71% and 7.93% respectively by adding 3 v% DIO and CHCl3 SVA treatments to increase crystallinity of blend films and optimize the film morphology (Table 2).

A star-shaped molecule 27 based on BODIPY exhibited a high Voc of 0.94 V when blended with PC71BM in a ratio of 1:3 (w:w), resulting from a deep HOMO level of −5.62 eV. After the addition of 4% (v/v) pyridine in the blend solution, the best PCE of 5.29% was obtained due to the improvement of film morphology and crystallinity. Zhou et al. employed TPA as central moiety and strong electron-withdrawing rhodanine derivative CNRo as end units to synthesize a star-shaped molecule 28. A low HOMO level was shown in 28, resulting in a high Voc of 0.99 V.

Thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) with strong electron-withdrawing capability was widely used as an acceptor unit in organic photovoltaic materials to decrease energy levels without increasing bandgaps. In 2014, Choi et al. prepared two TPD-based molecules (29a, 29b) that comprised the same dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) donor unit but different alkyl-substituted positions. It was shown that different positions of alkyl substituents had almost no impact on HOMO levels and optical properties of 29a and 29b, thus allowing for similar Voc values around 0.93 V. However, diverse photovoltaic performances with a PCE of 6.00% for 29a and a PCE of 3.1% for 29b, were observed. They ascribed the higher PCE for 29a to the favorable face-on orientation and suitable phase separation of blend films. Kim and co-workers reported another TPD-based molecule 30, in which benzodithiophene (BDT) acted as a electron-donating core. Besides the effect of TPD units, the introduction of selenophenes could decrease HOMO level of molecule 30 in contrast to thiophenes. Considering the deep HOMO level of −5.34 eV, the device based on molecule 30 provided a high Voc of 0.92 V.


π-Linkage, as a crucial role, has a great influence on photoelectric and charge transport properties of small molecules, in turn, photovoltaic performances of OSCs. HOMO levels of small molecules could be efficiently modulated by inserting conjugated π-bridges with appropriate electronic property and length into electron push–pull structures, which is a promising approach for generating devices with high Voc.


In 2012, Seo reported two DPP-based small molecules 31a and 31b. The device based on 31a gave a poor Voc value of 0.47 V, while the Voc value of 31b-based device was further increased to 0.87 V by replacing the thiophene units which were attached to the DPP unit in molecule 31a with phenyl groups. In 2016, two molecules (32a, 32b) containing DPP as central cores were synthesized by Yang and co-workers, which improved the Voc value successfully by adopting the similar approach to that mentioned above in this paragraph. As phenyl ring has the weaker electron-donating capacity relative to thiophene, molecules comprising benzene as π-linkage would show deeper HOMO levels, thus allowing for higher Voc values for 31b and 32b (Fig. 5).

Cao and co-workers prepared two extended π-conjugated D2–A2–D1–A1–D1–A2–D2 type small molecules (33a, 33b) with narrow band gaps, containing DPP and difluorobenzothiadiazole as the A1 and A2 unit respectively, indacenodithiophene (IDT) and n-hexyl-substituted bithiophene as the D1 and D2 unit respectively. Both 33a and 33b showed a strong and broad optical absorption from 300 to 900 nm, because of the extended conjugated system. However, changing the groups next to the DPP core from thiophene to thiazole led to a significant decrease in molecular energy levels of 33b, which resulted from the increased electron-deficient character after introducing thiazole units. Owing to better photoelectric properties and more balanced charge carrier mobility, the BHJ device based on 33b gave an outstanding PCE of 7.00% with a high Voc of 0.88 V upon THF SVA treatments.
With the goal of investigating the effects of acetylene-incorporation on photovoltaic properties, Park and co-workers reported two DPP-based small molecules (34a, 34b) with or without acetylene as π-bridges in 2013. The electron-withdrawing character of triple-bond, endowed 34a a lower HOMO level of −5.72 eV than that of 34b (−5.51 eV). Additionally, a red-shifted and broader absorption was observed in 34a. Consequently, better photovoltaic performances were achieved by the device based on 34a, including a higher Voc of 0.87 V.
In 2014, our research group developed a series of novel D–π–A–π–D type small molecules (35a–35d), in which DPP as the electron-deficient core and TPA as terminal donor moieties were connected with different π-linkages. BHJ devices using 35a–35d as electron donors in combination with PC61BM as electron acceptors were fabricated, and the higher Voc values of 35c and 35d were correlated with their lower HOMO levels arised from the electron-withdrawing effect of acrylonitrile and acetylene linkages, elevating the oxidation potential. Compared to 35c and 35d, about 6 times and 2 times higher hole mobility (2.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was found in 35b. It could be explained by increased rigidity, better coplanarity and strong intermolecular interaction in 35b caused by vinylene π-linkages, which contributed to the best PCE of 3.76% among these devices.
For exploring the π-linkage effects systematically, in 2014, we reported a series of small molecules (36a–36d) based on different conjugated π-bridges, including benzene, styrene, 2-phenylacrylonitrile and ethynylbenzene respectively. 2-Phenylacrylonitrile and ethynylbenzene, depending on their electron-withdrawing character, deepened HOMO levels of 36c and 36d by increasing the oxidation potential, which resulted in high Voc values of 1.08 V and 1.03 V respectively. Furthermore, the introduction of 2-phenylacrylonitrile had a positive impact on improving the molecular planarity, leading to a higher hole mobility (9.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) observed in the device based on 36c. Later, our research group designed and synthesized two small molecules (37c, 37d) with ethynyl-linker, while two similar molecules (37a, 37b) without triple-bond were also synthesized as references to investigate their photovoltaic properties of BHJ devices. As expected, high Voc values were achieved by devices based on 37c and 37d. Especially, 37d-based exhibited a high Voc of 1.06 V, resulting from the synergistic effect of electron-withdrawing ethynyl-linker and weak electron-donating carbazyl units. Moreover, In contrast to 37a and 37b, apart from better optical properties with high molar extinction coefficient (ε), 37c and 37d containing ethynyl-linker also showed superior hole-transporting capacity, which should be responsible for high Jsc and FF of OSCs. As a consequence, devices based on 37c and 37d gave a better PCE of 3.21% and 2.10% respectively.
In 2015, A series of D–π–A–π–D type small molecules (38a–38d), having DPP as the core and fluorene or carbazole as the ending group, were reported by our research group. Ethynyl was chosen as the π-bridge in 38c and 38d to deepen molecular HOMO levels, thus improving Voc values for OSCs. The device based on 38c gave a increased Voc of 0.84 V compared to that of 38a (0.49 V). Similarly, a higher Voc value of 0.98 V was observed in 38d-based device than that of 38b (0.89 V).
In 2016, our research group selected ID as the central acceptor unit, TPA as terminal donor units and styrene or 2-phenylacrylonitrile as conjugated π-bridges, affording two small molecules (39a, 39b). OSCs based on blends of these molecules and PC61BM (1:2, w/w) exhibited high Voc values of 0.99 V and 1.06 V respectively. The increased Voc value for 39b-based device was mainly due to the much lower HOMO level originated from the electron-withdrawing effect of 2-phenylacrylonitrile. In addition, benefiting from higher hole-transporting ability, favorable film morphology and better crystallinity, the device based on 39b achieved an excellent PCE of 3.57% relative to that of 39a, which was the best performance for solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on ID–TPA at that time (Fig. 6).
Wong and co-workers developed a series of novel small molecules (40a–40d) comprising 1,2-di(2-thienyl)-ethene (TVT). By comparing 40a and 40b, a lower HOMO level and blue-shifted absorption edge were found in 40b owing to the incorporation of ethynyl-linkers. However, 40c and 40d with strong electron-withdrawing units as ending groups showed much lower HOMO levels (−5.40 eV, −5.41 eV) than 40b (−5.29 eV), which guaranteed high Voc values of 0.98 V and 0.99 V for devices based on 40c and 40d respectively.
Molecule 41a synthesized by Zhan and co-workers in 2013, in which centered BDT was surrounded by two thiophene flanked DPP as end-capping units, showed a Voc value of 0.89 V in OSCs. In 2016, Cao and co-workers designed molecule 41b by inserting ethynylene bridges between BDT and DPP units in 41a, resulting in an improved Voc value of 0.98 V.
In 2016, Sharma and co-workers synthesized 42a and 42b, by connecting two DPP units with vinyl or acetylene as π-linkages. Unlike vinyl-linkers, acetylene-linkers had electron-withdrawing character, decreasing the HOMO level of 42b, which led to a high Voc of 0.96 V for the 42b-based device. Recently, a ferrocene based small molecule 43 was first proposed by Sharma and co-workers. In molecule 43, ferrocene with strong electron-donating ability and DPP with strong electron-withdrawing character were chosen to increase ICT effect, while ethynyl as π-bridges was introduced to deepen the HOMO level. As expected, an intense band in the wavelength region from 500 nm to 650 nm and a low HOMO level of −5.34 eV were observed, and the low HOMO level should account for the high Voc of 0.98 V for the 43-based device. Finally, the OSC based on 43:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blend film achieved a outstanding PCE of 6.44% via TSA treatments.

The effect of the length of π-bridge on photovoltaic performances has been studied by numerous research groups. For instance, In 2012, molecule 44a having excellent optical absorption properties with a narrow bandgap of 1.69 eV was reported by Chen and co-workers, the device using 44a as the donor in a D–A ratio of 2:1 exhibited a PCE of 6.10% with a Voc of 0.92 V. Thereafter, Chen and co-workers synthesized molecule 44b by lessen the number of thiophene as π-linkers in molecule 44a, to further improve the Voc value to 1.02 V, which was explained by the declining HOMO level.

In 2013, Fu et al. proposed two molecules (45a, 45b) using either thiophene or bithiophene as π-bridges. Thiophene linked 45b showed slightly low HOMO level of −5.55 eV compared to 45a bearing bithiophene, which enabled 45b to obtain a higher Voc value of 0.97 V in OSCs. The device fabricated from 45b achieved the best PCE of 1.20% by annealing at 110 °C for 3 min and choosing MoO3 as the electron-blocking layer, while a poor PCE of 0.75% was observed for 45a owing to some aggregation and transformation between the conjugated system. Wang and co-workers reported a series of novel molecules (46a–46c) containing varying terminal oligothiophene lengths in 2013. With the number of ending thiophene groups increasing in the order of 46a, 46b and 46c, elevated HOMO level, broader absorption range as well as lower optical band gap were shown. Among devices fabricated from these three molecules, the highest Voc of 1.02 V was obtained for 46a incorporating one terminal thiophene unit, while the highest PCE of 3.90% was achieved for 46c having three terminal thiophene units. In 2015, 47a and 47b were designed by Wong and co-workers. The removal of thiophenes between BT units and TPA units contributed to a deeper HOMO level of 47a than that of 47b, and hence devices based on these molecules in combination with PC71BM offered Voc values of 0.93 V and 0.85 V respectively. Benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene (BTT2) as the electron-rich unit, was introduced into linear A–D–A type small molecules by Meng et al. for the first time in 2015. The synthesized 48a and 48b, in which BTT2 located in the middle and 3-ethylrhodanine as electron-deficient groups were linked with different numbers of thiophenes, were used to fully investigate the structure–property correlations for organic photovoltaic materials. Surprisingly, when applied in photovoltaic devices, 48a and 48b exhibited distinct photovoltaic performances, with a PCE of 0.15% for 48a having three thiophenes as π-bridges and a PCE of 2.21% for 48b bearing two thiophenes as π-bridges. Firstly, the desirable film morphology revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) was shown in 48b-based blend film, which facilitated the charge generation and reduced the charge recombination, thus resulting in a higher Jsc and Voc of 1.10 V. Secondly, a deeper HOMO level of 48b was another reason for the high Voc value. Moreover, benefiting from better crystallinity, the hole mobility of 48b-based film was two orders of magnitude higher than that of 48a. All these factors led to achieve a more outstanding PCE for 48b.
Three isoindigo (ID) centered molecules (49a–49c) with different numbers of thiophene-linkers were synthesized to probe the relationship between chemical structure and photovoltaic property by Detrembleur and co-workers in 2015. The decrease of the HOMO levels was observed with lessening the numbers of thiophene-linkers in the order of 49a, 49b and 49c, so devices made from 49b and 49c showed higher Voc values of 0.99 V and 0.96 V respectively relative to 0.87 V for 49a. After CHCl3 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatments, the 49c-based device acquired the highest PCE of 1.92% among devices fabricated from these molecules, resulting from the hole mobility as high as 3.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the most optimized film morphology (Table 3). In 2016, 50a and 50b featuring N-heteroacene with all thiophene substituents, were first reported by Zhang et al. Devices based on 50a and 50b all gave excellent PCEs around 5.00% and high Voc values above 1.00 V, which demonstrated the promising future of N-heteroacenes as electron donors for photovoltaic applications.

Liang et al. reported two isomeric molecules (51a, 51b) with different moiety sequences in 2014. In contrast to 51b having thiophene sandwiched between benzodithiophene (BDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT), 51a comprising BT attached to BDT had a slightly deeper HOMO level, and a higher hole mobility, which was explained by the better crystallinity. As a consequence, significant difference was observed in their photovoltaic performance. 51a achieved a PCE of 4.53% with a higher Voc of 0.89 V, whereas 51b gave a poor PCE of 1.58% with a Voc of 0.82 V.


Numerous researches have demonstrated that substituents and side chains on conjugated structures are able to exert significant influence on molecular property, and then photovoltaic performance for OSCs. For example, introducing substituent groups with different electronic effects into conjugated backbones can be an effective way to modulate optical and electrochemical properties for conjugated molecules. Furthermore, the length, shape and position of alkyl chains play a important role in controlling molecular solubility, crystallinity, miscibility with PCBM and film morphology. Recent progress in designing small molecule donor materials applied for photovoltaic devices with high Voc by substituent group and side chain engineering were summarized as follows.


In 2009, Nguyen and co-workers chose benzofuran as terminal groups to synthesize a DPP-based molecule 52a. The HOMO level of 52a could be stabilized by the electronegative oxygen atom in benzofuran, which resulted in a high Voc of 0.92 V for 52a. With a similar structure, 52b consisting of thiophene-2-carboxylate as end-capping groups rather than benzofuran was proposed by Chen and co-workers in 2013.52b had a deep HOMO level of −5.35 eV caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of the ester group, and thus a fairly high Voc of 1.02 V was achieved by the device based on 52b (Fig. 7).

In 2012, molecule 53a reported by Chen and co-workers, involving 2-ethylhexoxy substituted BDT placed at the core and 3-ethylrhodanine placed at the terminal with bioctylterthiophene as the π-linker, obtained the highest PCE of 7.38% when blended with PC71BM at that time. Later, they focused on achieving high Voc by decreasing HOMO level and designed the molecule 53b. In 53b, octyl chain with weaker electron-donating character was introduced to replace the 2-ethylhexoxy chain on the BDT unit, which contributed to a deeper HOMO level of −5.08 eV and a higher Voc of 0.98 V for 53b.
In 2015, Do et al. proposed two molecules based on substituted BDT as the central unit with different substitute groups.54b bearing the silylacetylene group showed a much lower HOMO level of −5.35 eV compared to hexyloxy substituted 54a (−5.09 eV), which was due to the less electron-donating nature of silylacetylene relative to that of hexyloxy. So, a higher Voc value of 0.98 V was obtained for 54b, while 54a gave a Voc value of 0.78 V.
Based on 53a, Chen and co-workers chose alkyl-thienyl chains instead of 2-ethylhexoxy chains on the BDT unit to synthesize the molecule 55a, which aimed to maintain the high Voc value and improve the Jsc value. As expected, resulting from the extension of conjugation system, 55a showed a more red-shifted absorption and a narrower optical band gap than 53a. The best PCE of 8.12% was observed when polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was add to the solution of 55a and PC71BM, which was mainly attributed to the increased Jsc value. In 2015, a sulfur atom was inserted into the alkyl-thienyl side chain by Li and co-workers to give 55b. In contrast to 55a, 55b had a lower HOMO level of −5.18 eV as well as a higher hole mobility of 3.21 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which correlated well with the higher Voc and FF. Excitingly, the BHJ device based on 55b gave an superior PCE of 9.20% with a high Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 13.45 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.71 without any extra optimal treatments.
Combining superiorities of both polymers and small molecules, two medium-sized molecules (56a, 56b) with different side chains on the central unit were reported by the research group of Peng in 2017. Both of two molecules have substituted BDT as the electron-rich core, naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) as the second electron-deficient unit, 3-ethylrhodanine as the terminal acceptor unit and terthiophenes as π-linkages used to bridge them. Excellent photoelectric and charge transport properties was observed in 56a and 56b, including a broad absorption range, deep HOMO levels and high hole mobilities up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, 56b bearing alkylthiothiophene chains showed lower HOMO level of −5.35 eV compared to 56a having alkyl-thienyl chains (−5.29 eV), which was caused by the additional sulfur atom with the ability of accepting π-electrons. When CS2 with a low boiling point was chosen as the processing solvent to control the molecular aggregation by shortening the drying process, the record PCEs of 10.02% and 11.53% were achieved by devices fabricated from 56a and 56b respectively, with a Voc of 0.89 V for 56a and a Voc of 0.93 V for 56b.
In order to explore the effect of side chains with different heteroatoms on photovoltaic performance, Zhu and co-workers introduced different substituents on the central core and proposed a series of molecules (57a–57c), which contained the BDT unit as the core, alkyl-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophenes as π-bridges and 3-ethylrhodanine as terminal moieties. With the heteroatom varying from O, C to S, decreased HOMO levels were observed, arising from increasingly upward oxidation potential. So, alkylthio-substituted 57c exhibited the lowest HOMO level of −5.15 eV among these molecules, thus leading to the highest Voc of 1.02 V. However, a poor film morphology restricted the charge transport, and thus the device based on 57c showed a inferior PCE of 4.05% upon CHCl3 SVA treatments. Notably, 57b with alkoxy chains achieved an excellent PCE of 8.68% under the same conditions of devices fabrication, benefiting from the better film morphology with “multi-length scaled” phase separation. 58a and 58b, comprising substituted naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (NDF) as the central unit and DPP as the end-capping units, were designed by Peng et al. By comparison with alkoxyphenyl substituted 58a, 58b having alkylthiophenyl chains showed a higher Voc of 1.00 V owing to the deeper HOMO level, which matched well with research results reported by Zhu's group.

Fluorination on polymers and organic small molecules has been widely developed. On the one hand, owing to the strong electron-withdrawing character of fluorine atom, the insertion of fluorine atoms into the conjugated backbone has been found to successfully decrease HOMO levels, thus improving Voc values of photovoltaic devices. On the other hand, the non-covalent interaction formed by fluorination, is conducive to the enhancement of intermolecular interactions, which will facilitate the exciton dissociation and charge extraction. In 2013, Zhou et al. reported two DPP centered molecules (59a, 59b), in which naphthyl units with or without a fluorine atom were located at the end. Unlike the non-fluorinated 59a, fluorinated 59b exhibited a lower HOMO level, as well as more red-shifted optical absorption in film caused by the better intermolecular stacking. As a result, 59b showed a relatively higher PCE of 3.15% with a Voc of 0.92 V after annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, while 59a attained a PCE of 2.61% with a Voc of 0.84 V. Two molecules (60a, 60b) based on BDT were synthesized by Li and co-workers in 2015. For 60b with fluorine stoms, a deeper HOMO level and higher hole mobility in the film were observed, thus allowing for the high Voc value and FF. when chose PDIN as the cathode interlayer and added 0.4% v/v DIO, the device based on 60b obtained more outstanding performance with a PCE of 5.42%, a Voc of 0.97 V and a FF of 0.64 compared to the PCE of 5.27%, a Voc of 0.91 V and a FF of 0.60 for 60a.

For the purpose of improving photovoltaic performance by rational molecular modification, Wang et al. designed a series of D1–A–D2–A–D1 type molecules (61a–61c) containing indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the central donor unit (D2), benzothiadiazole or difluorinated benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit (A) and hexyl-substituted bithiophene as the end-capping donor unit (D1). The molecule 61b, featuring the addition of two fluorine atoms on each benzothiadizole unit of 61a, had a more decreased HOMO level of −5.48 eV, which contributed to a much higher Voc of 0.99 V. In order to increase Jsc and FF, as well as maintain a high Voc, a thiophene spacer was inserted between the IDT unit and the difluorobenzo-thiadiazole unit to yield 61c. By comparing 61a and 61c, 61c gained the stronger absorption intensity in the range of 400–600 nm, a low-lying HOMO level and better charge transport properties. The device fabricated using 61c:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) gave a PCE of 6.8% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.62 with no extra treatments. After CH2Cl2 vapor annealing treatments for 50 s, the PCE for 61c rised to 8.1%, which was ascribed to the enhancement of FF from 0.62 to 0.76. In 2015, Our research group reported four novel molecules (62a–62d), which comprised benzothiadiazole with one or no fluorine atom as the electron-withdrawing core, TPA as the terminal units and thiophene or bithiophene as a portion of π-linkage. All of these molecules acquired high Voc values above 0.96 V, Especially for monofluorinated 62c bearing less thiophene units, with the highest Voc of 1.11 V. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of fluorination and the extended conjugated system, the device based on 62d achieved the best PCE of 4.86% among the four molecules.
In 2016, two molecules (63a, 63b) based on oligothiophene backbone, employing fluorine substitution or not, were developed by Peng and co-workers. When compared to 63a without fluorine atoms, 63b had a deeper HOMO level caused by higher oxidation potential and a slightly blue-shifted optical absorption. In addition, because of the non-covalent interaction existing in the conjugated backbone, the fluorination planarized the molecular structure, which should be in favor of the better molecular stacking, thus leading to a higher hole mobility for 63b (7.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 5.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). On the whole, fluorinated 63b outperformed 63a in terms of higher Voc, Jsc and FF. Later, Zhu and co-workers further studied fluorination effects by appending different number of fluorine atoms to the central units in two star shaped molecule (64a, 64b). With the fluorine atoms on each BT unit increasing from one to two, decreased HOMO levels were observed. As a result, 64b comprising difluorinated benzothiadiazoles showed a higher Voc of 1.01 V than 64a (0.96 V).

In 2013, a series of star shaped molecules (65a–65d) based on TPA with different alkyl chains, including methyl, ethyl, hexyl and dodecyl, were designed by Min and co-workers to reveal the structure–property relationships. It was found that different lengths of alkyl chains barely affect the optical absorption and molecular energy levels, nevertheless distinct photovoltaic performances were shown in devices made from these molecules. Except for the Voc, 65a bearing methyl chains achieved the best performance parameters in terms of Jsc, FF and PCE among the four molecules. This result was because that the reduced steric hindrance and enhanced intermolecular interactions, caused by methyl as the shortest alkyl chain, could facilitate the formation of better film morphology for charge separation and transport. Notably, 65d containing dodecyl exhibited the highest Voc of 1.00 V compared to the other three molecules, which was explained by the weak intermolecular interaction owing to the introduction of long alkyl chains. Molecule 66 was synthesized by replacing 2-ethylhexyl chains in 55a with bulk chains of 2-hexyldecyl. In accord with the result studied by Min's group, a higher Voc of 0.96 V was acquired by 66-based device under the same condition similar to that of 55a. In 2014, Deng et al., using octyl or hexyl placed on terminal groups, designed two BDT centered molecules (67a, 67b).67a with long octyl chains had a lower HOMO level of −5.19 eV than 67b with hexyl chains (−5.11 eV), bringing about a higher Voc of 0.94 V for 67a (Fig. 8).


Fullerene derivatives as popular electron acceptors, have been widely used in OSCs, which is attributed to their excellent charge transport properties, including high electron mobility and electron affinity. However, the further improvement of photovoltaic performance is limited by the drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, such as difficult modification in chemical structures and energy levels, poor optical absorption, and high cost of production and purification. In recent years, nonfullerene small molecule acceptor materials have attracted a lot of attention and developed rapidly. So far, photovoltaic devices based on nonfullerene small molecule acceptor have achieved a record PCE of 14.57%, which outperforms those employing fullerene acceptors. In contrast to fullerene counterparts, OSCs using small molecule acceptors with adjustable energy levels, have great potential in achieving higher Voc values. Moreover, different donor materials also affect Voc values of photovoltaic devices, as Voc is related to the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. So, in this section, recent research progress in structural design and modification of small molecule acceptors for OPV devices with high Voc values, will be summarized in six parts according to different donor materials employed in OSCs.


As a classical polymer donor material with a wide band gap, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), whose LUMO and HOMO level are around −3.0 eV and −5.0 eV respectively, shows attractive advantages, such as, low cost, easy synthesis and production in a large area, and outstanding charge transport properties.

In 2013, Hwang and co-workers chose 68a and 68b as acceptor materials for OSCs to compare the difference of their photovoltaic properties, owing to the formation of aromatic system of 68a and anti-aromatic system of 68b when accepting an electron respectively. For 68a, upon annealing at 70 °C for 10 min, a PCE of 2.28% and a high Voc of 1.07 V were observed in the photovoltaic device. The Voc value of 68a-based device, higher than those of PC61BM-based counterparts, was explained by the high-lying LUMO level of 68a. Whereas in case of 68b, the device exhibited no photovoltaic effect. Widely divergent electron mobilities were shown in blend films based on the two molecules (1.62 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 1.74 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1), which should be responsible for different photovoltaic effects. In 2015, a rubicene centered molecule, which has aromaticity after accepting two electrons, was reported by Chen et al. Benefiting from the high-lying LUMO level of −3.30 eV, the device fabricated from 69 gave a fairly high Voc of 1.22 V (Table 4).

Pei and co-workers introduced p-formylphenyl or methyl-ester on fluoranthene-fused imide unit and synthesized two molecules (70a, 70b). Both of them possessed similar energy levels, thus giving alike Voc values around 1.03 V. Nevertheless, a more twisted conformation of 70a induced an increase in miscibility with P3HT, and better film morphology with continuous interpenetrating networks, which contributed to a relatively higher PCE of 2.40%.
In 2013, the research group of Zhan designed molecule 71 by connecting two DPP units at the flank of the central dibenzosilole (DBS) unit. After solvent annealing with o-dichlorobenzene, an impressive enhancement in Voc from 0.84 V to 0.97 V was found in device based on 71 and P3HT, which was because of ordered molecular packing and reduced series resistance caused by “relaxation and self-organization of the molecules”. In 2014, the photovoltaic device based on molecule 72 which contained fluorene as central core rather than DBS unit, was fabricated by Bhosale and co-workers, affording a high Voc of 1.10 V. Molecule 73 studied by Chen's research group, is similar to molecule 72, except for the change of alkyl chains on the fluorene unit and addition of phenyls on the end-cappers. The twisted molecular structure endowed 73 appropriate energy levels which matched well with PC71BM and P3HT respectively, as well as favorable phase separation in blend film. So, both OSCs made from 73 as electron donor or acceptor attained PCEs of over 3%. In addition, when applying 73 as the acceptor material combined with P3HT, the device gave a considerably high Voc of 1.18 V. On the basis of molecule 72, Chen's research group synthesized molecule 74 with additional thiophene-2-carbonitrile units at the terminal to decrease LUMO level and optical bandgap. With respect to photovoltaic performances, an improved PCE of 2.37% and a slightly reduced Voc of 0.97 V, were obtained by molecule 74 compared to those of molecule 72. Zhan and co-workers utilized IDT unit instead of central fluorene unit of molecule 72, yielding molecule 75 with bipolar character. Especially, As a acceptor material applied in OSCs, molecule 75 gained a high Voc of 1.17 V. Some other DPP-based molecules with different central moieties were reported successively, showing high Voc values. For example, in 2014, Raynor et al. proposed molecule 76 containing benzothiadiazole at the core, with a Voc of 1.08 V. Phenyl or alkyl phenyl was used as central core to produce molecule 77a and 77b by Zhang et al., and Voc values of 1.10 V and 1.13 V were achieved by 77a-based and 77b-based devices respectively. Soon after, Bhosale and co-workers designed a carbazole centered molecule 78, which gave a Voc value up to 1.17 V (Fig. 9).
In contrast to linear molecules, multi-dimensional molecules with twisted configurations have been proved to inhibit excessive aggregation. In recent years, many research groups have reported various DPP-based multi-dimensional molecules for OSCs with high Voc values. In 2012, for the first time, a three-dimensional (3D) molecule 79 having triphenylamine as central unit, was proposed by Zhan and co-workers. When blended with P3HT, molecule 79 exhibited a PCE of 1.20% and a high Voc of 1.18 V. Chen and co-workers introduced spirobifluorene (SF) to replace triphenylamine, and changed alkyl chains attached to DPP arms, from 2-ethylhexyl, n-octyl to n-dodecyl, giving 80a–80c. They found that the branched 2-ethylhexyl in 80a can weaken the intermolecular interaction with P3HT and reduce intermolecular electronic coupling, thus achieving the highest Voc of 1.10 V within this series. Later on, phenyls were inserted on the end-cappers to construct molecule 81. Smaller aggregation in blend films acquired by cross-shaped molecule 81, facilitated the formation of finer phase separation than that of the corresponding linear molecule 73, which caused a lifted Jsc value of 8.29 mA cm−2 and maintained a high Voc of 1.14 V, resulting in a outstanding PCE of 5.16%. Recently, Chen and co-workers continued the study on four-dimensional molecule by appending fluorine atoms to end-capping phenyls of molecule 81. After the fluorination, the resulting molecule 82 obtained a deeper LUMO level, as well as a higher electron mobility, contributing to exciton dissociation and charge transport. But a little lower PCE of 4.42% was provided by molecule 82 than that of molecule 81, which was mainly arised from the decreased Voc of 1.04 V. In 2016, molecule 83, comprising the core of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and the arms of DPP, was synthesized by Rananaware et al., giving a high Voc of 1.18 V. By substituting central SF core in molecule 81 with TPE or biphenyl unit, Chen and co-workers prepared molecule 84a and 84b. TPE centered 84a, with a more extended conjugation backbone and a better crystallization feature, showed a relatively higher PCE of 2.49%, as well as a Voc of 1.16 V. In comparison, 84b exhibited a PCE of 1.18%, with a Voc of 1.11 V. In 2017, the research group of Bhosale presented a H-shaped molecule 85, incorporating 9,9′-bifluorenylidene moiety as the core and DPP groups as arms. Notably, molecule 85 provided a superior electron mobility of 2.40 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a high Voc of 1.17 V to yield a PCE of 5.42%.
Besides DPP-based small molecules, some other star-shaped molecules applied in photovoltaic devices with high Voc values, have been publicized. Four rhodanine or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine units were attached on the flank of the central spirobifluorene unit via thiophene π-linkers by Chen and co-workers. Both resulting molecules (86a, 86b) showed strong absorption with high absorption coefficients over 10−5 M−1 cm−1, high-lying LUMO levels, as well as fine interpenetrating network in the blend films benefited from their 3D structures. As a result, well PCE values around 4.50% and high Voc values above 0.90 V were acquired by the devices based both molecules.
In 2014, Kim et al. designed two linear molecules (87a, 87b) having carbazole or fluorene placed in the middle and rhodanine units located at the end. Their photovoltaic performances were fully investigated, which showed high Voc values of 1.03 V for 87a and 87b caused by their high-lying and comparable LUMO levels. In particular, 87b achieved a higher PCE of 3.08%, resulting from the higher EQE intensity and thus a higher Jsc value. In comparison with perylene diimide (PDI), perylene monoimide (PMI) has a uplifted LUMO levels due to the reduction of imide segments from two to one. Considering the aforementioned feature, a PMI-based molecule 88 was presented by Zhang et al. in 2015, giving a PCE of 2.30% with a high Voc of 0.98 V. Later on, naphthalimide (NI) unit was introduced in the molecule 89 by Zhan and co-workers to improve Voc value to 1.06 V (Fig. 10).
A series of small-molecule acceptors with A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type were synthesized by the research group of Zhou, to fabricate OSCs featuring high Voc values. In 2017, they designed a molecule 90, which contained IDT, BT and thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TD) as the D unit, A1 unit and A2 group, respectively. As the TD unit possessed weaker electron-withdrawing ability than rhodanine, molecule 90 showed a high-lying LUMO level relative to the counterpart with rhodanine, which contributed to a high Voc of 0.92 V and an outstanding PCE of 6.08% observed in 90-based devices. Later, benzo[1,2,3]triazole and quinoxaline, having weaker electron-deficient character than benzothiadiazole, were chosen to design small molecule acceptor materials by Zhou and co-workers, aiming to elevate the LUMO levels and in turn the Voc values. As expected, when blended with P3HT, the synthesized molecule 91a and 91b generated high Voc values of 1.02 V and 1.00 V respectively, along with PCEs of 5.24% and 4.03% respectively. On the basis of molecule 91a, they used 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine rather than rhodanine to synthesize two molecules (92a, 92b). Whether benzotriazole or methoxy substituted benzotriazole acted as the A1 unit, PCEs over 5% and Voc values over 0.90 V were acquired for corresponding devices.
Bhosale and co-workers, using tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) or tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) unit, designed two asymmetrical molecules (93b, 93c) with TPA as the donor moiety and chromen-2-one as the acceptor moiety, while molecule 93a was also synthesized as reference. Owing to the formation of cross-conjugation in molecular backbones induced by the insertion of TCNE or TCNQ, molecule 93b and 93c had much broader absorption range compared to 93a, which should account for their higher PCEs. Whereas 93a exhibited the highest LUMO level among these three molecule, thus leading to a highest Voc of 1.03 V.

In 2012, Hou and co-workers reported the polymer donor PBDB-T with a broad band gap, which showed a HOMO level around −5.23 eV and a LUMO level around −3.18 eV. Recently, the PCEs of OSCs based on PBDB-T have broken through 11%.

In 2017, an A–D–A type molecule 94, whose structure consisted of fluorene as the core, thiophene as the π-bridges and 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene) propanedinitrile (INCN) as the terminal units, was proposed by the research group of Chen, affording a high PCE of 7.11% with a high Voc of 0.98 V. Thereafter, they fused the central fluorene and lateral thiophenes in molecule 95a, to synthesize a ladder-shaped molecule 95b, which provided a more planar structure and thus resulted in an enhancement in effective conjugation. In comparison, 95b exhibited an elevated LUMO level, and a more red-shifted and complementary absorption. Other than that, suitable intermolecular aggregation controlled by “out-of-plane” chains in 95b, facilitated the formation of desirable film morphology. So, the photovoltaic device fabricated from 95b realized a superior PCE of 10.06%, as well as a high Voc of 0.94 V. Based on molecule 95b, they continued to modify the molecular structure by replacing benzenes in end-capping groups with naphthalenes to enlarge the conjugated system, yielding molecule 96. Not only was the high Voc of 0.94 V maintained, but its PCE was improved to 11.2% successfully as well, which was because of the increase in Jsc and FF, benefiting from the red-shift absorption and raised electron mobility of molecule 96 (Fig. 11).
Molecule 97 reported by Zheng and co-workers, which differs from molecule 94 in the introduction of N-containing heteroheptacene as the core, showed a high Voc of 0.96 V and a PCE of 6.23% when blended with PBDB-T. Soon after, they compared the effects of different alkyl chains on photovoltaic properties by designing two dithienonaphthalene-based molecules with hexyl (98a) or 2-ethylhexyl (98b) chain. Except for a higher Voc value, 98b outperformed 98a in terms of higher Jsc, FF and PCE, thanks to the satisfying film morphology for exciton dissociation, which suppressed bimolecular recombination and made charge carrier mobilities increased and more balanced. The research group of Chen used hexylphenyl substituents instead of alkyl chains on the central unit and afforded molecule 99a, while they added methyl, methoxyl or fluorine atom on the terminal units and gave molecule 99b–d. Molecule 99a–d all exhibited excellent PCEs more than 8%. In addition, high Voc values ranging from 0.94 V to 0.97 V was achieved by molecule 99a–99c, due to their high-lying LUMO levels.
Molecular modification on ITIC (100a) through employing thienyl-fused indanone as end-capping units, was utilized to synthesized molecule 100b by Hou and co-workers. They found that 100b owned an improved electron mobility, as well as a lifted LUMO level caused by the enhanced electron-donating effect of terminal groups. Accordingly, the Voc, FF, and thus PCE for 100b were higher relative of those of 100a, reaching a PCE of 11.4% with a Voc of 1.01 V and a FF of 0.71. In the same year, they selected four molecules (101a–101d) having different alkoxy substituents on the ending groups to explore structure–property relationships. Similar Voc values above 0.90 V were obtained for 101a–101d, but Jsc and FF values decreased with the length of alkoxy chain increasing, which derived from the increasingly poor film morphology induced by their worsening solubility in the order of methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and butoxy. Hence, molecule 101a bearing the shortest methoxy chain, gained the highest PCE of 11.6%.
In 2017, Chang et al. developed a 3D molecule 102 with a high absorption coefficient of 3.12 × 10−5 mol−1 cm−1, in which thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes as π-bridges were used to connect the central spirobifluorene unit and terminal 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile units. A high Voc of 0.96 V and PCE of 5.66% were attained by the device fabricated from molecule 102. Molecule 103b with a 3D structure, comprising thiophene annulations in the bay regions of perylene bisimide (PBI) units, was synthesized by Hou and co-workers. In contrast to 103a, the incorporation of sulfur atoms gave rise to an elevation of LUMO level, and endowed the PBI units of 103b better planarity, thus allowing for the improvement of charge transport properties. When applied in OSCs, 103b showed an excellent PCE of 6.17%, together with a high Voc of 0.95 V. whereas in case of 103a, an inferior PCE of 3.62% was observed (Table 5).

The research group of Hou systematically studied how the aggregation structures affected the electron donating and accepting performances of photovoltaic materials, and designed two A–D–A type molecules (104a, 104b) with different alkyl substitution positions. For ortho-substituted 104a, the best performing device was fabricated from PC71BM as the acceptor material, showing a PCE of 6.68% and a Voc of 0.97 V. While for meta-substituted 104b, the well-performing device was fabricated from PBDB-T as the donor material, affording a PCE of 5.89% with a Voc of 0.98 V. So, they concluded that, low steric hindrance could lead to compact π–π stacking, which made molecules act as electron donors. Nevertheless, molecules with high steric hindrance could act as electron acceptors.

PDBT-T1, having a wide bandgap of 1.85 eV and a deep HOMO level of −5.36 eV, was first proposed by Sun and co-workers in 2015, which attained a high PCE of 9.74% when combined with PC71BM.

Perylene bisimide (PBI) with superior planarity, has been a popular building block used to construct non-fullerene acceptor materials, because of its outstanding charge transport properties. But, the low-lying LUMO levels produced low Voc values below 0.9 V for PBI-containing acceptors. For the purpose of increasing Voc values, researchers inserted aromatic rings or heteroatoms including sulfur or selenium atoms into the bay position of PBI units, to elevate LUMO levels by means of the extension of conjugation systems and the electron-donating effect of heteroatoms. In 2015, the research group of Sun reported 105a and 105b, fusing S or Se atoms into the bay region of PBI units. Raised LUMO levels of −3.85 eV and −3.87 eV were acquired for 105a and 105b respectively, relative to that of their analogue without heteroatom–incorporation. Furthermore, the looser outmost electron cloud of selenium assisted to increase the non-covalent interaction of Se–Se, conducing to a higher electron mobility of 4.80 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and thus a FF of 0.70 for 105b. As a result, OSCs based on 105a achieved a PCE of 7.16% with a Voc of 0.90 V, and 105b-based device gave a better PCE of 8.42% with a Voc of 0.96 V. In 2016, they merged three PBI units with or without selenophene annulations into the central benzene ring, forming two 3D molecules (106a, 106b). In view of their suitable LUMO levels, high electron mobility and favorable aggregation and film morphology, both 106a and 106b realized high Voc values (1.00 V vs. 0.97 V), as well as high PCEs (9.28% vs. 8.28%). In 2017, TPA was chosen as the core to replace benzene ring in 106b and synthesized three 3D molecules (107a–107c). In accord with their previous researches, thiophene or selenophene annulated 107b and 107c exhibited higher Voc values of 1.00 V. Subsequently, they introduced thienobenzene into the bay positions of PBI units and probed the relationship between relative positions of thienobenzene and photovoltaic properties. It was found that 108b had a higher LUMO level than 108a, which arised from its more effective conjugation caused by the relatively better planarity, thus resulting in a higher Voc of 0.99 V for 108b. However, the considerable phase separation in blend film led to a lower PCE of 5.84% compared to that of 108a (6.71%) (Fig. 12).
In 2016, Zhan and co-workers developed two IDT centered molecules (109a, 109b), in which hexylphenyl or hexyl chains were attached on the IDT core. By varying side chains from hexylphenyl to hexyl, a red-shifted absorption and higher electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for 109b, benefiting from the more ordered molecular packing. So, the device made from 109b generated a promising PCE of 9.20%, but the decreased LUMO level was responsible for the reduced Voc value for 109b.

In 2013, Chen and co-workers reported a low-bandgap polymer with a HOMO level of −5.22 eV and LUMO level of −3.64 eV, namely PTB7-Th, which has been demonstrated to be an outstanding electron donor material and achieved PCEs above 10%.

Zhang et al. presented the molecule 110 by employing indenofluorene (IF) as the core and INCN as end-capping units. Depending on the proper LUMO level of −3.85 eV and strongly short-wavelength absorption which paired well with that of PTBT-Th, molecule 110 exhibited a moderate PCE of 6.56% and a high Voc of 0.92 V, when applied in photovoltaic devices. Two IDT-based molecules (111a, 111b) with hexylphenyl or hexyl chains, were designed by Zhan and co-workers, to compare the difference of photovoltaic performances. In conformity with the results of 109a and 109b, 111a containing hexylphenyl substituents showed a higher Voc of 0.99 V, while 111b with smaller steric hindrance gave a higher PCE of 8.7%. Later, owing to its low energy levels, molecule 112 was chosen as an “energy driver” to make the charge transfer more effective through increasing the driving force. The molecule 112 was added in the PTB7-Th/111a film with the amount of 1%, realizing a remarkable improvement in the PCE from 7.7% to 10.1%, along with a higher Voc of 1.03 V. Zhou and co-workers introduced malononitrile instead of rhodanine as the end-capping group in 91a, yielding the molecule 113. In spite of the deeper LUMO level than that of 91a, molecule 113 realized a high Voc of 1.05 V when blended with PTB7-Th having a deeper HOMO level relative to that of P3HT.
In 2016, Chen and co-workers fused two PBI units with the central indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) units to keep a planar backbone, affording a molecule 114, whose bulky hexylphenyl chains on the IDTT core were in favor of suppressing intermolecular overaggregation. The fused structure facilitated π-electron delocalization, thus endowing molecule 114 a high-lying LUMO level and high and balanced charge carrier mobilities, which accounted for the great PCE of 7.33% and the high Voc of 0.99 V. In 2017, Huang and co-workers reported a 3D molecule (115a) based on PBI-fused 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] (SCPDT). By comparison with its analogue 115b, in which four PBI units were linked to the SCPDT unit via C–C single bonds, 115a with a larger conjugated system had a red-shifted absorption and an elevated LUMO level of −3.70 eV. Benefiting from above superiorities, the device fabricated from 115a yield a higher PCE of 8.89% and a higher Voc of 0.90 V.

The research group of Bo reported a series of NI-based molecules, which had high-lying LUMO levels in the range between −3.61 eV and −3.47 eV and thus showed high Voc values in OSCs. Molecule 116a, was synthesized by connecting two NI moieties to the thiophene core, affording a remarkably high Voc of 1.30 V when combined with P1 as the electron donor material. Afterwards, they replaced the dodecyl chains in 116a with octyl chains, and changed the substrate temperature to control the film morphology and photovoltaic performance. Compared to the substrate temperature of 30 °C, heating the substrate at 45 °C helped the molecule 116b realize an improved PCE from 2.68% to 3.61% with an improved high Voc value from 1.25 V to 1.28 V, which was ascribed to the desirable film morphology caused by the decrease in domain size of 116b. Benzene was selected as the core to link two thiophene-flanked NI units, producing a molecule 117, which achieved a Voc of 1.04 V and a PCE of 2.78%. In 2016, they proposed three different alkyl-substituted molecules (118a–118c), in which two NI units were attached to an alkynyl bridge. It was observed that molecular crystallinity gradually turned weak with the length of alkyl chain increasing in the order of butyl, hexyl and octyl. 118b bearing medium hexyl chains exhibited appropriate aggregates in the blend film, therefore allowing for a higher PCE of 4.05% with a Voc of 1.06 V for the corresponding photovoltaic device. Then, they continued to modify molecular structure by means of diacetylene instead of acetylene as the core. By combining with P2 that had a deeper HOMO level than P1, the resulting molecule 119 provided a Voc of 1.07 V.

In 2015, Yan and co-workers employed molecule 120a or 120b as the acceptor material and P3 as the donor material, to fabricate the photovoltaic cells and investigate their performances. The difference between 120a and 120b, was an additional SF π-bridge with the electron-donating character in 120a, which lifted the LUMO level of 120a and suppressed intermolecular excessive aggregation. So, the device based on 120a attained a higher PCE of 6.3%, resulting from the superior Voc value of 0.98 V. Molecules 121a–121g, which consisted of two PBI units as end-capping groups and different central units, including thiophene, phenylene and thienothiophene, were reported by Hartnett et al. in 2016. These molecules were divided into two groups: unfused dimers (121a, 121c, 121f) and ring-fused dimers (121b, 121d, 121e, 121g). For ring-fused dimers, higher LUMO levels than those of unfused dimers were observed, thus resulting in their high Voc values. Compared to 121e and 121g with planar structures, twisted 121b and 121d showed better photovoltaic performance when blended with polymer P4, which was explained by the decreased geminate recombination induced by amorphous films, increasing electron mobilities. The above results demonstrated that, the formation of twisted structure through fusing ring could conduce to the improvement of photovoltaic properties for PBI dimers (Fig. 13).
In 2017, Bo and co-workers designed two alkylated carbazole-cored molecules (122a, 122b), which focused on the effects of different alkyl chains.122b with the linear octyl substituent offered a higher LUMO level, as well as a more compact molecular packing relative to 122a bearing the branched 2-ethylhexyl chain, facilitating the charge transport, and hence the better PCE of 4.64% with a higher Voc of 1.03 V was obtained.
Recently, the research group of Zhou modified the molecule 91a by displacing a sulfur atom of terminal rhodanine with a oxygen atom or a dicyanomethylene group, producing molecule 123a and 123c respectively. Decreasing the electron-withdrawing strength of end-capping group could endow the molecule a uplifted LUMO level, enabling increase of Voc values in OSCs, so 123a accomplished a remarkably high Voc of 1.29 V when combined with P6. However, the small LUMO–LUMO energy offset of 0.05 eV between 123a and P6 restricted the PCE to 0.26%. With raising the LUMO–LUMO energy offset, the charge transfer would be more effective, which assisted to achieve a higher PCE. Within this series, 123c with the lowest LUMO level and largest energy offset, attained the highest PCE of 8.25%, together with a Voc of 1.15 V. After the P6 was replaced with P7 having a lower HOMO level, OSCs based on 123c achieved an improved Voc of 1.20 V and a desirable PCE of 8.60%. Later, they used three benzotriazole-based polymers (P8a–P8c) as donor materials pairing with the dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene-cored molecule 124 respectively, to choose suitable donor/acceptor combination for improving photovoltaic performance of OSCs. By changing the polymer materials from P8a, P8b containing additional fluorine atoms to P8c with additional fluorine atoms and alkylthio chains, the devices based on 124 gave gradually increased Voc values and decreased Jsc values, resulting from the downshifted HOMO levels of polymer donors and HOMO–HOMO energy offsets of donor and acceptor. Consequently, the device for P8c:124 provided the highest Voc of 1.24 V, but a poor PCE of 3.84% among the three, which was due to the inefficient hole transfer caused by the small HOMO–HOMO energy offset. While the device fabricated from P8b:124 realized a balance of the high Voc value and Jsc value, thus giving the best PCE of 8.36% among the three. In 2018, Zhou and co-workers chose fluorene, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and rhodanine units to construct the first A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-containing acceptor 125. By means of the high-lying LUMO level of −3.61 eV, molecule 125 showed a high Voc of 1.05 V, when combined with P6 in OSCs. Molecule 126 proposed by Xie et al. in 2018, comprising IDT as the core and thienyl-fused indanone as end groups, gave a Voc of 0.93 V and an excellent PCE of 8.69% as well (Fig. 14 and Table 6).

In 2016, an unsymmetrical molecule 127, in which the DPP unit and TPA unit were linked with the TCNE unit as the π-bridge, was constructed by Sharma and co-workers. The complementary absorption and appropriate energy levels with P10, endowed molecule 127 a high Voc of 0.92 V and a moderate PCE of 3.90% in OSCs. In 2017, they inserted TCNE or TCNQ unit between TPA moiety and NI moiety, and synthesized two molecules (128a, 128b). Compared to 128a, much stronger electron-deficient TCNQ in 128b contributed to a broader absorption range, improving the Jsc value, and thus achieved a higher PCE of 6.11%. In the case of 128a, a relative high-lying LUMO level helped gain a higher Voc of 1.02 V. The above results were consistent with those of 93b and 93c reported by Bhosale and co-workers. Thereafter, they replaced TPA and NI unit with DPP and N-phenyl carbazole unit, yielding molecule 129a. On the basis of 129a, another N-phenyl carbazole unit was attached to the DPP unit to synthesize molecule 129b. It was found that their LUMO levels almost stayed constant, while 129b showed a elevated HOMO level and thus a reduced bandgap, which should be responsible for their similar Voc values around 0.90 V, and a higher Jsc of 13.78 mA cm−2 for 129b than that of 129a (10.56 mA cm−2). Moreover, the additional carbazole-incorporation provided 129b-based film with better crystallinity, improving the electron mobility, in turn, the FF. As a result, the device based on 129b realized a higher PCE of 7.19%.

Inspired by impressive progress of small molecule materials, more researchers have focused on constructing all-small-molecule OSCs without fullerene. On the one hand, small molecule donors show unique advantages compared to polymer donors, such as structural simplicity, definite molecular weight, easier purification and adjustable energy levels. On the other hand, small molecule acceptors generally have higher LUMO levels than fullerene acceptors, which will be in favor of achieving higher Voc values for all-small-molecule OSCs. In 2014, Li and co-workers utilized three electron-withdrawing units to design an acceptor material 130, which consisted of benzothiadiazole, oligothiazole and alkyl cyanoacetate.SM1 with a 3D structure reported by Ma et al., was selected as the donor material to blend with molecule 130, fabricating photovoltaic devices. Even though the PCE was poor, the Voc value was as high as 1.24 V. In 2016, Lee and co-workers manufactured OSCs by employing a IDT-based molecule 131 as the acceptor and SM2 as the donor, and fully investigated their photovoltaic performances. An outstanding PCE of 7.09% and a high Voc of 1.06 V were observed, resulting from matched energy levels, as well as the complementary absorption with maximal absorption peak of 572 and 689 nm in film, provided by SM2 and molecule 131 respectively. Furthermore, the device showed superior thermal stability, which only 30% reduction in the PCE was found when heated at 120 °C for 300 h, while the PCE of the corresponding device based on PC70BM declined by 60%. Molecule 132, in which thiobarbituric acid groups were connected to the central fluorene unit via thiophene bridges, was synthesized by Chen and co-workers in 2016. Owing to its high-lying LUMO level of −3.62 eV, molecule 132 gained a high Voc of 1.15 V when combined with SM3 as the electron donor. In 2017, Privado et al. prepared two thiophene functionalized DPP derivatives (133a, 133b) with rhodanine or dicyano-rhodanine as end-capping building blocks. Benefitng from the incorporation of strong electron-deficient dicyanomethylene on rhodanine units, 133b exhibited a red-shifted ICT absorption band and a larger LUMO offset for exciton dissociation. In addition, better molecular ordering and crystallinity revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), provided 133b with a higher electron mobility of 5.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of 133a (3.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Devices fabricated from SM4 as electron donor and 133a as electron acceptor gave a PCE of 6.98%, with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 11.04 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.62. As for 133b, an improved PCE of 7.76% was observed, together with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 12.15 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68, while the slightly low Voc value was related to the deeper LUMO level of 133b.


With the rapid development of OSCs, the Voc values of single-junction photovoltaic devices based on small molecules as donors or acceptors have improved to 1.12 V and 1.36 V respectively. In this review, we have summarized recent advances on small-molecule OSCs with high Voc values, and discussed how molecular structures of small molecule materials affect Voc values for OSCs. A few strategies of molecular design, which conduce to achieve OSCs having high Voc values, can be acquired.

Firstly, for small molecule donors, decreasing their HOMO levels by means of rational molecular design and modification, is a productive approach to increase Voc values for OSCs.
(1) Selecting weak electron-donating units and strong electron-withdrawing units constructs small molecule donors. Generally, electron-donating units in molecules mainly control HOMO levels, while HOMO levels will be lowered by introducing weak electron-rich units, such as fluorene, carbazole, benzodithiophene and arylene hydrocarbons. On the other hand, the incorporation of strong electron-deficient units will decrease HOMO and LUMO levels simultaneously, thus contributing to high Voc values for OSCs.
(2) Inserting π-bridges with electron-withdrawing nature (i.e., acrylonitrile, acetylene) or weakening electron-donating nature of π-bridges, and shortening the length of electron-donating π-linkages, are effective in the enhancement of Voc values, which is due to the reduction of HOMO levels of molecules.
(3) Substituents and side chains on conjugated structures are able to exert significant influence on molecular property, and thus Voc values of photovoltaic devices. Through employing electron-withdrawing substituents (i.e., fluorine atoms, cyano groups) or replacing stronger electron-donating substituents (i.e., alkyloxy) with weaker electron-donating substituents (i.e., alkylthiol), small molecule donors will show deeper HOMO levels, allowing for high Voc values for OSCs. In addition, molecules bearing long and branched alkyl chains have weak intermolecular interactions, and hence tend to obtain higher Voc values relative to those comprising short chains, when applied in OSCs.
Then, unlike small molecule donors, since the research of small molecule acceptors started relatively late, there are still no thorough principles to design small molecule acceptors for OSCs with high Voc values. However, the following strategies are certain:
(1) Decreasing electron-withdrawing character of structural units appropriately, is favor of elevating LUMO levels of acceptor materials, increasing Voc values of OSCs. For example, replacing indanone with thienyl-fused indanone, using a oxygen atom instead of a sulfur atom of rhodanine unit.
(2) Extending conjugation backbone by fusing rings, helps raise LUMO levels of molecules, which leads to improved Voc values of OSCs. Such as, inserting aromatic rings or heteroatoms including sulfur or selenium atoms into the bay position of PBI units, fusing the central fluorene and lateral thiophenes.
(3) In most cases, small molecule acceptors with 3D structures achieve high Voc values easily, when used in OSCs.
So far, OSCs based on small molecules with high Voc values over 1.00 V and high PCEs over 10% have been reported, but most of high-voltage devices provided PCEs below 8.00%. When we tune molecular energy level via molecular design, not only will the Voc change, but other parameters will as well, including Jsc. Therefore, one challenge we face is realizing a balance by means of molecular design and device engineering, which can make Voc improved and do not depreciate other performance parameters. For example, the molecule 100b reported by Hou and co-workers, gave a high Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 15.90 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.71 and a PCE of 11.40% when used in OSCs. As shown in above parameters, the moderate Jsc value has limited the further improvement of the PCE. If efficient molecular modification, and device engineering, such as the fabrication of ternary materials system and morphology optimization, can be performed to increase the Jsc value up to 20.00 mA cm−2 without sacrificing other parameters, the PCE will be over 14.00%. Finally, there is reason to believe that a significant breakthrough will be made in the fabrication of OSCs with high Voc values and PCEs in the near future.
