An effective way to enhance the efficiency of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is to insert suitable bridges (π) between donor units (D) and acceptor units (A) in D–π–A copolymers. This work is devoted to uncovering how the characteristics of a HT (the substituent groups via head- to-tail (HT) connection) bithiophene bridge with different substituent groups (R = H, CH3, OCH3 and CN) affect the ground state structure, electronic, optical and charge transport properties of D–π–A copolymers for improving the photovoltaic performance. Based on the D–π–A copolymer PPBzT2-CEHβ (P1) with a HT bridge of 3,4′-diethylhexyl-2,2′-bithiophene (π1), we designed six new copolymers (P2–P6′) by introducing six kinds of HT bridges. From the calculated results, the introduction of different substituent groups into the bithiophene-bridge can markedly affect the HOMO and LUMO levels, band gaps, light-absorbing efficiency and hole transport ability of the copolymers. In particular, the copolymer P6 combining the cyano and methoxyl groups into the bridge has remarkable electronic and optical properties and hole transport ability among all the copolymers P1–P6′, and it can be a candidate for donor materials of organic solar cells. We hope that the present results could provide a theoretical guidance for designing efficient donors in organic solar cells.

Over the past few years, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) offer great opportunities as renewable energy sources due to their lightweight, low-cost production, large-area and flexible photovoltaic devices. In general, the active layers of BHJ polymer solar cells are comprised of a phase-separated donor–acceptor blend layer with a p-type conjugated polymer as the electron donor, and an n-type fullerene derivative (PC61BM or PC71BM) as the electron acceptor. The working mechanism of donor–acceptor heterojunction solar cells includes four main steps: (1) the photo-excitation of the donor generates an exciton (a Coulomb-correlate electron–hole pair), (2) the exciton diffuses to the donor–acceptor interface, (3) the bound exciton dissociates at the donor–acceptor interface to form free charge (electron and hole), (4) free charge transportation in the active layer and collection by the electrodes.

As everyone knows, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an OSC (organic solar cell) is closely connected with the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF). Therefore, the most straightforward way to improve the PCE is to enhance Voc, Jsc and FF. In BHJ solar cells, Voc is in a relationship with the charge carrier mobility, light intensity as well as dissociation and decay rates of photo-induced electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the Voc is linearly dependent on the difference between the HOMO level of a donor and the LUMO level of an acceptor.Jsc is affected by the light-absorbing efficiency of the active layer, exciton transportation and dissociation at the D/A interface, and charge transportation in the photoactive layer as well as charge collection on the electrodes. FF is associated with two elements of the devices: the series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh), lower series resistance and higher shunt resistance lead to higher FF values. Besides, the morphology of the photovoltaic material also markedly influences the FF in the manufacturing process of the BHJ solar cell device. Therefore, an ideal donor material would possess suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels, a broad and strong absorption band in visible and near infrared regions to match the solar spectrum, high charge carrier mobility and high air-stability.
In the search for promising D–A donor copolymers for PSCs, much effort has been focused on the design and synthesis of new D and A building blocks. In comparison with inorganic semiconductors, a unique advantage of the conjugated copolymers is that their optoelectronic properties can be easily tuned by attaching functional substituents on the polymer main chains. For instance, Berson and co-workers studied the effect of carbonitrile and hexyloxy substituents on the performances of the alternated copolymer polythiophene in photovoltaic cells. Bredas and Heeger paid much attention to the effect of the functional substituents (electron-donating and electron-drawing substituents) on the electronic energy levels of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV). Huang and co-workers investigated how the alkoxy and carbonitrile groups affect the photoelectric properties of the PPV-based electroluminescent polymers. Those reports show that the electron-withdrawing groups will downshift the energy levels with the LUMO level more than the HOMO level, while the electron-donating groups will upshift the energy levels with the HOMO level more than the LUMO level.
There is already considerable research on the design and synthesis of new D or A building blocks, however, the studies focusing on the bridges between D and A units are insufficient, which provide a new idea to improve the performance of organic solar cells. For example, Wang and co-workers synthesized a series of conjugated D–π–A copolymers to investigate the effect of π-conjugated bridges on photovoltaic properties. They found that the π-conjugated bridges can markedly influence the molecular geometries and optoelectronic properties of these copolymers, and consequently directly affected the photovoltaic performances. Furthermore, Biniek and co-workers studied a series of copolymers with different numbers of thiophene bridges and found that PPBzT2-CEHβ (3,4′-diethylhexyl-2,2′-bithiophene as π-bridge) possesses larger Voc and Jsc, higher hole mobility and PCE than that of PTBzT2-CEHβ (3-ethylhexylthiophene as the π-bridge). However, up to now, few studies have concentrated on the effect of the π-bridges with different substituent groups (electron-donating groups or electron-withdrawing groups) between D and A segments on the ground state structure, electronic, optical and charge transport properties of D–π–A copolymers. Compared with the thiophene-bridge, the bithiophene-bridge has more substitution positions to facilitate introducing different substituents, which can adjust the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and energy gaps (Eg) of the copolymers. Herein, we focus on investigating the effect of a bithiophene-bridge with different substituent groups (R = H, CH3, OCH3 and CN) on the ground state geometry, optoelectronic and charge transport properties of D–π–A copolymers.
A series of questions will be put forward when a bithiophene-bridge with different substituent groups (R = H, CH3, OCH3 and CN) is inserted between D and A units in the polymer backbone. (1) What is the effect of the substituent groups on the ground state geometry, electronic, optical and charge transport properties of these copolymers as well as the photovoltaic performance? (2) Is it true whether the more the electron-donating groups or electron-withdrawing groups introduced into the bithiophene-bridge, the more it is beneficial to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells? It should be focused on. (3) How to make the copolymers have deep-lying HOMO energy levels and narrow band gaps, and high hole mobilities by introducing the substituents into the bithiophene-bridge? We introduce a series of different π-bridges, such as 2,2′-bithiophene (π2), 3,4′-dialkoxy-2,2′-bithiophene (π3), 2,2′-bithiophene-3,4′-dicarbonitrile (π4), 4′-alkyl-2,2′-bithiophene-3-carbonitrile (π5), 4′-alkoxy-2,2′-bithiophene-3-carbonitrile (π6) and 3′-alkoxy-2,2′-bithiophene-4-carbonitrile (π6′) to replace π1 (3,4′-diethylhexyl-2,2′-bithiophene) in PPBzT2-CEHβ (P1) for expounding the above-mentioned problems. Herein, our calculations are an attempt to provide a theoretical model for analyzing how a bithiophene bridge with different substituent groups between the donor unit and the acceptor unit influences the photovoltaic properties of PSCs.

In recent years, quantum chemical calculations provide a competitive alternative for the interpretation of experimental data and even offer predictability on the performances of novel materials, therefore, it can reduce the development cost of the new materials. Nowadays, the density functional theory (DFT) method has attracted much attention because this method can consider the electronic correlation very well and be applied to the organic macromolecular systems.

In this work, the ground state geometries of the oligomers (monomer and dimer) were fully optimized by DFT with B3LYP, PBE0, BHandHLYP and B1B95 functionals at the 6-31G** and 6-311G** basis sets. In order to simplify the calculations and reduce the computational costs, all the alkyl and alkoxy branched chains (in Fig. 1) were replaced by methyl and methoxyl groups, respectively, with little effect on the frontier molecular orbitals and optoelectronic properties, and the terminal groups of the repetitive units were saturated with hydrogen atoms. As shown in Table 1, the calculated HOMO energy level (dimer model) at the B1B95/6-311G** level (−5.05 eV for P1) agrees well with the experimental value of P1 (−5.04 eV). By contrast, the calculated HOMO energy levels with a smaller basis set (6-31G**) are listed in Table S1 (ESI). Based on the optimized ground state structure of the dimer model at the B1B95/6-311G** level, the electronic absorption spectra of the copolymer (P1) were calculated with TDDFT at the B1B95/6-311G** level in agreement with the experimental value. Therefore, the computations at the B1B95/6-311G** level are more appropriate for this system. The calculated vibrational spectrum in each molecule has no imaginary frequency, which implies that all the optimized structures are located at the minimum point of the potential surface. The LUMO level was taken from the sum of the HOMO level plus the TDDFT transition energy (S0 → S1, ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,TD) rather than from the unreliable KS (Kohn–Sham) LUMO eigenvalue. The cationic and anionic geometries of the oligomers were also optimized at the B1B95/6-311G** level. The intermolecular distance between two adjacent molecular segments was scanned using the M06-2X functional at the 6-31G** basis set. The correlative calculations of the transfer integral were also performed at the M06-2X/6-31G** level. In this paper, the spin-restricted DFT was adopted for the ground state geometries, whereas the spin-unrestricted DFT was used for the ion-state geometries. All the calculations were carried out with the aid of the Gaussian 09 package in the gas phase.

In order to investigate the effect of a HT bithiophene-bridge with different substituent groups (R = H, CH3, OCH3 and CN) on the ground state structure properties of the corresponding copolymers (P1–P6′), we deduced the ground state structure properties of P1–P6′ by investigating that of the corresponding monomers (M1–M6′). The main optimized geometry parameters of M1–M6′ are shown in Table 2. The optimized geometries of all monomers are listed in Fig. S1 (ESI). As shown in Table 2, the calculated dihedral angles (C1–C2–C3–S1/S1–C4–C5–C6/C7–C8–C9–C10/C11–C12–C13–C14/C15–C16–C17–S2) of M3 are less than the corresponding dihedral angles of M1, M2 and M4, meaning that the molecular backbone of M3 has better planarity than that of M1, M2 and M4. The possible reason is that the interactions of sulphur–oxygen (S–O) could result in the steric hindrance of the methoxyl group smaller than that of other substituents (H, CH3 and CN). The introduction of the methoxyl into M3 leads to a stronger conjugation effect and shorter bond lengths (C2–C3/C4–C5/C8–C9/C12–C13/C16–C17) in comparison to M1, M2 and M4. For M6 and M6′, the values of the bond length and the dihedral angle are different, although the substituent groups are the same in the bithiophene-bridge. This suggests that the substituent positions have a significant effect on molecular planarity.

In conclusion, the above-mentioned results show that: (1) the introduction of the different substituent groups into the bithiophene-bridge has a remarkable effect on the molecular conjugation effect and planarity, (2) the monomers (M3, M6) have better planarity and stronger π-conjugated effects in comparison to other monomers.

The analysis of the molecular orbitals of the copolymers is very important because the relative order of the occupied and virtual orbitals offers a reasonable qualitative indication of excitation properties and the ability of electron or hole transport. Herein, we focus on analyzing the HOMO and LUMO levels of the copolymers in the next section.

We calculated the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of all the copolymers on a dimer model by DFT at the B1B95/6-311G** level. From Fig. 2a and Table 3, for the copolymers of P1–P4, one can see that the HOMO levels are in the order P3 > P1 > P2 > P4, and their LUMO levels are in the sequence P1 > P3 > P2 > P4. Moreover, the energy gaps (S0 → S1) of those copolymers are in the order P3 < P1 < P2 < P4. These results clearly show that the introduction of the double CN groups into the bithiophene-bridge of P4 can significantly lower the HOMO/LUMO levels, and the HOMO level down-shifted more than the LUMO level in comparison with P2. This is not consistent with previous reports that the electron-withdrawing groups make the LUMO level down-shifted more than the HOMO level. As we can see from the electron density plots of P4 in Fig. 3, the CN groups involved in the HOMO orbital while it hardly participated in the LUMO orbital. This may be the reason of the above-mentioned result (for P4, the HOMO level reduced more than the LUMO level). However, compared with that of P2, the copolymers P1 and P3 in which the dual electron-donating groups (CH3/OCH3) were introduced into the bithiophene-bridge can observably increase the HOMO/LUMO levels, and reduce the energy gap, especially methoxyl. This result is consistent with previous reports that the electron-donating groups induce the HOMO levels up-shifted more than the LUMO levels.

It is interesting to note that the incorporation of cyano-group and methoxyl into the same bithiophene-bridge has a narrow energy gap (Eg) and lower-lying HOMO level. The values of HOMO/LUMO and energy gaps for P6/P6′ are in between P3 (methoxyl as substituted group) and P4 (CN as substituted group). Similarly, the values of HOMO/LUMO and energy gap for P5 are in between P1 (methyl as substituted group) and P4. Moreover, for P6/P6′, the HOMO/LUMO levels and the energy gaps are different, although the substituent groups are the same in the bithiophene-bridge. This result reveals that the substituent positions in the bithiophene-bridge greatly influence the electronic properties.
In order to investigate whether the π-bridge fragments of D–π–A donor copolymers make the above-mentioned changes (such as the variation of HOMO and LUMO levels), we separately calculated the energy levels (HOMO/LUMO) and energy gaps (see ESI, Table S2) of bridge fragments. As shown in Fig. 2b, for the four π-conjugated bridges (π1, π2, π3 and π4), the HOMO energy levels are in the order π3 > π1 > π2 > π4, and the LUMO values are in the sequence π1 > π3 > π2 > π4. We found that the variation of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1–P4 is in accordance with that of the four π-conjugated bridges. These results are also in accord with the previous reports that an electron-withdrawing group generally results in the decreasing of the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, while an electron-donating group usually leads to the HOMO/LUMO energy levels increase. Interestingly, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of π5 are in between the values of π1 and the values of π4 in accord with the above-mentioned results (the HOMO and LUMO values of P5 in between P1 and P4). Likewise, the HOMO and LUMO values of π6/π6′ are also in between π3 and π4. It shows that the π-bridges directly affect the electronic properties of the corresponding D–π–A copolymers. Moreover, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the copolymers can be controllably adjusted by introducing the electron-donating groups and electron-withdrawing groups into the bithiophene-bridge.
For P1, P2, P4, P5 and P6′, from the molecular orbital diagrams (see Fig. 3), the HOMOs are mainly delocalized on the electron-rich TT units and bridge units as well as the benzene ring of the inner electron-deficient units. For P3 and P6, the densities of HOMO are mainly delocalized in the middle of molecular chains (electron-rich TT units and bridge units). This result suggests that the introduction of different substituent groups into the bithiophene-bridge has a significant effect on the distributions of HOMO electron density. Moreover, for those copolymers (P1–P6′), the electron densities of LUMOs are mainly located on the electron-deficient units (BT). The electronic transitions (HOMO → LUMO) involving these orbitals are intramolecular charge transfer, where electrons should be moved from the electron-rich unit to the electron-deficient unit.

As is known to all, the PCE of an OSC is determined by three important factors: open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), and it can be written as PCE = (Voc × Jsc × FF)/Pin, where Pin is the light power incident on the device. Therefore, it is very meaningful to analyze the above-mentioned parameters for the improvement of the PCE of an OSC.


The Voc is a key parameter to evaluate the performance of organic solar cells. Generally, Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of a donor and the LUMO level of an acceptor. In this paper, PCBM (PC61BM) was selected as the electron acceptor with the LUMO energy levels of −4.2 eV. The Voc value of a polymer-PC61BM solar cell can be estimated from eqn (1)

(1)
where
e denotes the elementary charge, 0.3 V is an empirical value, and EPCBMLUMO represents the LUMO energy level (−4.2 eV) of the PC61BM. The calculated Voc (0.55 V) of PPBzT2-CEHβ (P1)/PC61BM solar cell from eqn (1) agrees well with the experimental data (0.63 V). By calculation, the Voc values of P1–P6′ are 0.55, 0.69, 0.02, 1.55, 0.94, 0.69 and 0.83 V, respectively. The calculated Voc values are in the sequence P4 > P5 > P6′ > P2 = P6 > P1 > P3. This result shows that the introduction of cyano-groups into the bithiophene-bridge of the copolymer can significantly increase the Voc, while the introduction of electron-donating groups into the bithiophene-bridge gives the opposite result.


For the PSCs, a polymer donor is a crucial component to absorb sunlight. The light absorption range of the polymer donor plays a very important role on the Jsc. Jsc can be expressed as

(2)
where Sun(
λ) is the number of incident photons with wavelength λ per unit area, φIQE(λ) denotes the internal quantum efficiency, and η(λ) stands for the light-absorbing efficiency of the active layer.

For the calculation of the light-harvesting efficiency (η(λ)), eqn (3) was used
η(λ) = 1 − 10−f
(3)
where
f denotes the oscillator strength of the polymer donors associated with λ. Here, we only considered the η(λ) at the absorbing band of the lowest transition absorption peak (S0 → S1). Eqn (2) and (3) clearly shows that strong and wide optical absorption can give high Jsc.

In general, the excitation processes of most copolymers often induce a charge separation which needs extended basis sets. The calculated electronic excitation energy, oscillator strength (f), light absorption efficiency and dominating configurations performed by the hybrid function B1B95 with the 6-311G** basis set are summarized in Table 4 (considering the first 20 excited states). The simulated absorption spectra of the investigated copolymers are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, these copolymers have two obvious absorption peaks in the visible and near-infrared regions, respectively. The strong electronic transitions (f > 0.5) of these copolymers in the visible region correspond to the transitions from HOMO to LUMO, HOMO − 1 to LUMO + 2, HOMO to LUMO + 2, and so on. Fig. 3 shows that HOMO is a π type orbital, and the LUMO exhibits a typical π* character. Therefore, the S0 → S1 electronic transitions (see Table 4) in these copolymers are assigned to π–π* type transition.

As can be seen in Table 4, the calculated absorption peaks (P1: 647, 451 nm) reproduce the experimental absorption peaks well (626, 471 nm). In Fig. 4, compared with P1, the maximum absorption peaks (S0 → S1) of P3, P6 and P6′ show a significant bathochromic shift of 273, 125 and 66 nm, respectively, but the maximum absorption peak of P4 shows a blue shift of 40 nm. The positions of the maximum absorption peaks of P2 and P5 are almost invariable in comparison with P1. Specially, among these copolymers, P6 has a stronger and broader absorption of S0 → S1 transition in comparison with P1. In Table 4, the calculated light absorption efficiencies are 0.9985 (P1), 0.9993 (P2), 0.9975 (P3), 0.9996 (P4), 0.9989 (P5), 0.9989 (P6) and 0.9990 (P6′), respectively. Through the above analysis of the absorption spectrum and the light-absorbing efficiency, P6 may obtain a higher Jsc than other copolymers.
What is the effect of the substituent groups on the optical properties of the copolymers? The calculated results show that the introduction of two strong electron-withdrawing groups (CN) into a bithiophene-bridge in P4 sharply increases the energy gap and leads to the significant blue shift of the maximum absorption peak in comparison with P2 (H as the substituent group). The reason for this result may be due to the strong electron-withdrawing groups leading to the energy levels downward with the HOMO level down-shifted more than the LUMO level. In contrast, the introduction of two strong electron-donating groups (–OCH3) into the bithiophene-bridge in P3 significantly decreases the energy gap in comparison with P2, which is responsible for the markedly bathochromic shift of the maximum absorption peak. That may be due to the strong electron-donating groups inducing the HOMO level to rise more than the LUMO level. However, the energy gap of P1, with the weak electron-donating CH3 as the substituent group, is almost equal to that of P2. Therefore, the results demonstrate that: (1) the strong electron-withdrawing group can increase the energy gaps of the copolymers to some extent, (2) the strong electron-donating group reduces the energy gap of the copolymers, and the weak electron-donating group has a little effect on the energy gap. Compared with the values of P6 and P6′, the positions of the substituents in the bithiophene-bridge have great influence on the optical properties. This may be due to the fact that the substituent positions of the bithiophene-bridge are able to affect the molecular backbone coplanarity to a large extent.

FF is one of the key parameters that influence the PCE of an organic solar cell. However, two factors (Rs and Rsh) can markedly influence the FF, and there is a very complicated interaction with each other among these factors. Generally, Rs (series resistance) stems from the bulk resistances of the active layer and electrodes, and the contact resistances between the active layer and electrodes.Rsh (shunt resistance) is derived from the current leakage induced by the pinhole in the cell, or the current leakage from the edge of the device. However, the accurate prediction of Rs and Rsh by theoretical calculation for organic materials is still a big challenge. Here, we only describe the FF under ideal conditions without Rs and Rsh, and the approximation can be expressed as:

(4)
where FF
0 is the fill factor of ideal solar cell (no Rs and Rsh), and the accuracy of this equation is νoc > 10. Here, νoc is the dimensionless voltage . In this expression, q is the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (298.15 K) and Voc is the open circuit voltage. Taking P1:PC61BM as the example, the Voc is about 0.55 V, then the νoc is 21.38. According to eqn (4), the calculated FF0 is 81.68%. By calculation, the FF0 of the corresponding copolymers (P2–P6′) are 84.47%, 20.79%, 91.66%, 93.24%, 84.47% and 93.24%, respectively. The calculated FF0 of designed copolymers are larger than P1 except P3. The result reveals that the values of the fill factor (FF0) have a clear correlation with the values of the open circuit voltage (Voc). However, the experimental FF0 value of P1:PC61BM is about 45%. Through comparison, the large error between the calculated value and experimental value from an ideal solar cell model suggests that there must be other losses in the practical solar cell. Now, the accurate expression of the fill factor is further developing.


In the BHJPSC, a high hole mobility for the donor contributes to the enhancement of the charge transport efficiency and the FF of the solar cell. In general, the incoherent hopping model and coherent band model are two typical types of carrier (hole–electron) motion in materials, which appear under different conditions. For instance, the latter is currently appropriate for rigid inorganic semiconductors which through the strong valence bonds interact with two different sites. However, the coherent band model may be invalidated by the dynamic structure disorder at a high temperature, implying that the former may be the predominant mechanism at room temperature. In this work we adopt a hopping model to describe the charge transport properties along the directions of the interchains in the donor polymer system. In order to calculate the hole mobility of P1–P6′, we adopt the Einstein relationship given as follows,

(5)
where
kB, T and e correspond to the Boltzmann constant, temperature and electronic charge, respectively, and D is the charge diffusion coefficient. For a d-dimensional system, D is defined as the ratio between the mean-square displacement and the diffusion time. Moreover, in a spatially isotropic system, the homogeneous diffusion coefficient D can be approximately evaluated using:

(6)
where
d is the spatial dimension, i represents a specific hopping pathway with ri being the hole hopping distance (intermolecular centre-to-centre distance). While,  is the relative probability for electron hopping to the ith neighbor. In this paper, when considering about only one neighbor, the diffusion constant along with a dimer can be simply defined as:

D = ½KCTr2
(7)
In this equation, KCT and r are the charge transfer rate and adjacent intermolecular distance (see Fig. S2, ESI and Table 5), respectively. Therefore, the intermolecular hole mobility is expressed as:
(8)
As shown in Table 5, P6 possesses the highest intermolecular hole mobility (5.172 cm2 V−1 s−1) among all the copolymers (P1–P6′). This result shows that the introduction of the cyano and methoxy groups into the bithiophene-bridge can significantly improve the hole mobility of the copolymer. Thus, in light of the ability of hole transport, the newly designed copolymer (P6) may have a large Jsc and FF, when applied to the organic polymer solar cells.

From eqn (8), one can see that the hole mobility is in a positive relationship to the charge transfer rate (KCT). Moreover, the charge (hole) transfer rate (KCT) is an important parameter used to evaluate the donor material for solar cell applications, and can be calculated by Marcus theory on a hopping model via the following equation:
(9)
where
λ is the reorganization energy, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (we set T = 298.15 K in our calculations), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and ν is the electronic coupling (charge-transfer integral) between the two adjacent species. According to eqn (9), a low reorganization energy and a large charge transfer integral result in a large charge transport rate (KCT). As shown in Table 5, the values of the hole transfer rates are in the order P6 > P3 > P6′ > P2 > P5 > P4 > P1. This is the reason for P6 possessing the highest hole mobility among all the copolymers (P1–P6′). From eqn (9), the two major parameters of λ (reorganization energy) and ν (charge transfer integral) are directly proportional to the intermolecular hole (electron) transfer rate. Thus, it is extremely essential to analyze the reorganization energy and the charge-transfer integral in the sections below.


Generally, the total reorganization energy consists of the inner reorganization (λint) and external reorganization energy (λext). Firstly, the rapid change in molecular structure determines the λint, as a charge is removed or added from a molecule. And then, the polarization effects induce variations that λext denotes in the surrounding medium. The calculated values of the λext in the medium (such as film) are much smaller than their internal counterparts (λint). In this case, the λext could be ignored. Therefore, we would mainly discuss about the λint in this paper. Moreover, a clear correlation between λint and the charge transfer rate has been reported in the previous papers. The inner hole reorganization energy (λh) and electron reorganization energy (λe) values can be calculated using eqn (10) and (11):

λh = [E+0 − E+] + [E0+ − E0]
(10)
λe = [E−0 − E−] + [E0− − E0]
(11)
where
E0 is the energy of neutral geometry, E+ (E−) denotes the energy of the cation (anion) in cationic (anionic) geometry, E0+ (E0−) represents the energy of the neutral structure at the cationic (anionic) state, and E+0 (E−0) stands for the energy of cation (anion) with neutral geometry, respectively. The calculated λh and λe values are listed in Table 4. The λh values of the investigated copolymers on a dimer model (0.185–0.278 eV) are smaller than that of the typical hole transport material N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methlphenyl)-(1,10-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (TPD) (λh = 0.290 eV), which implies that these copolymers may have higher hole transfer rates. Similarly, the λe values (0.097–0.141 eV) are smaller than that of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum(III) (Alq3) (λe = 0.276 eV), a typical electron transport material, which denotes that the investigated copolymers may have higher electron transfer rates.

For the copolymers (P1–P6′), their values of λh are 0.278, 0.221, 0.231, 0.193, 0.251, 0.185 and 0.204 eV, respectively, and their λe values are 0.141, 0.137, 0.103, 0.129, 0.121, 0.097 and 0.112 eV, respectively. For P2–P6′, their values of λh and λe both all are smaller than that of P1. This may be due to the poor coplanarity of P1 in comparison with other copolymers (P2–P6′). These results suggest that the introduction of different substituent groups (H, CH3, OCH3 and CN) into the bithiophene-bridge has a large effect on λe and λh of those copolymers. For the copolymers of P1–P6′, their λh values decrease in the following order: P1 > P5 > P3 > P2 > P6′ > P4 > P6, and their λe values are in the sequence: P1 > P2 > P4 > P5 > P6′ > P3 > P6. This shows that P6 has the best charge transfer property among all the copolymers. Moreover, the difference between λh and λe values of P6 is smaller than that of P1–P3, P5 and P6′. This reveals that P6 is more conducive to equilibrium transport for hole and electron in comparison with these copolymers. Therefore, the combination of the cyano-group and methoxyl in the bithiophene-bridge of the copolymer can significantly improve the charge transport ability.

As we all know, the charge transfer integral is notably affected by the intermolecular stacking way of polymers. This stacking can generate a large number of possible configurations in modeling any 3D organic conductor because of the multitudinous of the stacking way. However, a lot of reports demonstrated that the way of face to face π-stacking has a main contribution to the interchain charge transport for organic solar cells with a large orbital overlap which facilitates the increase of electronic coupling. Herein, we have qualitatively studied the charge transport properties of the copolymers with the orientation of face to face π-stacking between the adjacent molecules. The π-stacking distances (r) between the adjacent segments are listed in Table 5. In general, the charge coupling matrix element (charge transfer integral) of the adjacent segments can be estimated by the Marcus–Hush two-state model at room temperature. In this work, we only calculate the hole transfer integral, because the hole transfer integral is more important than the electron transfer integral for donors. And the transfer integral ν of the hole is given by the following equation:

(12)

E
HOMO−1 and EHOMO represent the energy levels of HOMO − 1 and HOMO of the interactive segment pairs, respectively. The stacking model of adjacent dimer fragments is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). Here, the values of νh could just make a qualitative comparison of the reported and designed polymer donors. As shown in Table 5, the new designed copolymers (except P4) exhibit larger νh in comparison with P1. Especially the νh of P3 and P6 attains 0.222 and 0.174 eV, respectively. Here, we only investigated the ideal intermolecular π-stacking models of all dimers in the face-to-face way. Up to now, it still has been a great challenge which predicts accurately the intermolecular π-stacking pathways from the perspective of theory for copolymer or macromolecule. In conclusion, the high νh of P3 and P6 may be due to the fact that their geometry structures with good planarity, which facilitates the interchain π stacking and electronic coupling.

Generally speaking, the polymer solar cells are based on the BHJ structure of a blend of donors and acceptors (fullerene derivative). Now, PC61BM/PC71BM (PC71BM, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) is extensively used as the acceptor in organic solar cells because of the advantages of high electron affinity, high electron mobility and good solubility in common organic solvents. In this study, PCBM (PC60BM) was selected as the electron acceptor with the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −6.0 eV and −4.2 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the differences of LUMO energy levels between those donors (P1–P6) and the acceptor of PC61BM are corresponding to 1.07, 0.99, 1.03, 0.19, 0.69 and 0.62 eV, respectively. All of them (except P4) are located above 0.3 eV, which can be beneficial to the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor.

For the sake of qualitative evaluation the performance of the designed copolymers, Scharber proposed a model that the LUMO level and the band gap of the donor copolymer can be used to predict the PCE of the BHJ solar cell. Lately, Ku has employed the Scharber diagram to predict the PCE of the solar cell made by donor and PC61BM. The results show that the predicted PCEs of the solar cells are in agreement with the reported experimental data. Next, we predict the PCE (∼3.3%) of P1 (using the calculated results of Eg,TD and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,TD) by the Scharber diagram, which agrees well with the experimental data (3.2%). As shown in Fig. 6, the predicted PCEs of the newly designed copolymers (P2, P3, P5 and P6) are ∼3.7% (P2), ∼0.6% (P3), ∼5.8% (P5) and ∼6.8% (P6), respectively. The PCE of P3 is so low due to its very small band gap. Among these copolymers, P6 possesses the narrow band gap and the deepest LUMO energy level, which exhibits the highest predicted PCE close to ∼7% when combined with the PCBM acceptor in organic solar cells. The result shows that our idea can be used to improve the performance of the D–π–A copolymers in the application of solar cells.

In conclusion, a vast number of calculations and parallel comparisons are used to elaborate the role of the π-bridge with different substituent groups in the performance of PSCs. According to the calculated results, the strong electron-donating group leads to the HOMO level up-shifted more than the LUMO level, while the electron-withdrawing group induces the HOMO level down-shifted more than the LUMO level. Furthermore, the weak electron-donating group (methyl) shifts the HOMO and LUMO levels upward to a similar extent. The calculated results also show that the substituent positions in the bithiophene-bridge have a significant effect on the ground state structure, electronic, optical properties and hole mobility of D–π–A copolymers. Interestingly, we found that the introduction of the electron-donating groups and electron-withdrawing groups into the same bithiophene-bridge can not only easily adjust the energy levels and energy gaps of the copolymers, but can also improve the charge transport properties and the photovoltaic performances. Therefore, the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing groups and strong electron-donating groups via a HT connection in the same bithiophene-bridge is an effective way to improve electronic, optical and charge transport properties as well as the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In our designed compounds, the copolymer (P6) has a deep-lying HOMO level, strong and wide light absorption, high light-absorption efficiency, the smallest hole reorganization energy and the largest hole mobility among all the copolymers. Especially the predicted PCE of the newly designed copolymer (P6) attains ∼6.8%. This study presents us with a design guideline for improving the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells.
