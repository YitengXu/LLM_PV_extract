In this work, for the first time we used two novel fused aromatic conjugated electron withdrawing moieties 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone, respectively, to design two non-fullerene acceptors and evaluated their viability in solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs). 9-Fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone were used as core electron withdrawing blocks in combination with another common strong electron accepting diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) end-capping group. The compounds 6,6′-(5,5′-(9-oxo-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (DPP-FN-DPP) and 6,6′-(5,5′-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (DPP-ANQ-DPP) were synthesized via a Suzuki coupling reaction and characterized completely. The new acceptors exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents and good thermal stability with 5% weight loss above 360 °C. DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP possess a broad absorption band at 300–700 nm with optical band-gaps of 1.75 and 1.71 eV, respectively. The use of different core acceptor building blocks resulted in a difference in LUMO and HOMO energy levels. Inverted OSC devices employing P3HT as the donor polymer and DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP as acceptors yielded quite high open-circuit voltages (VOC) of 0.85–0.98 V, benefiting from the relatively low-lying LUMO energy levels of the two acceptors. Among both, OSC devices based on DPP-FN-DPP as acceptor exhibits the highest performance with a VOC of 0.97 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 3.2 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 37%, and an overall power conversion efficiency of 1.2%.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered one of the most promising technologies for harvesting solar energy and converting it into electrical energy due to a number of reasons such as low-cost fabrication, being light-weight, mechanical flexibility, roll-to-roll production and the tunable chemical properties of the organic semiconducting photovoltaic materials. Over the past decade, researchers worldwide have been constantly exploring various novel aromatic conjugated building blocks for designing and synthesizing electron donors and electron acceptors for high performance OSC devices. So far, much of the research effort has been devoted to the design and synthesis of novel electron donor materials, whereas the development of electron acceptor materials has lagged behind. Fullerene and its derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are dominantly used as classical acceptors for OSCs due to their superior electron affinity, high electron mobility and appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. However, these conventional acceptors have some limitations including weak absorption in the visible region, poor photochemical stability in air, large electron affinity that can lead to low open-circuit voltages (VOC) and high cost. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative low-cost electron acceptors with desirable properties such as strong and broad absorption, high electron mobility, suitable energy levels appropriate for the electron donating materials used and good solubility. In recent years, great attention has been paid to strong electron-withdrawing dyes and intermediates such as perylene derivatives, isoindigo, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), benzothiadiazole, and other electron-withdrawing building blocks for the development of non-fullerene acceptors. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of some solution-processed, fullerene-free OSCs has rapidly increased to 8–11%. Still, there is a continuous search for novel, cost-effective fused aromatic building blocks or dyes by organic chemists to design and synthesize novel non-fullerene acceptors with the aforementioned desired properties. As per our knowledge, so far there is a no single report on the 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone fused aromatic conjugated moiety-based, non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs in the literature. 9-Fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinoneare are capable moieties for constructing novel electron acceptors due to their high chemical stability. The CO ketonic groups in their structures may support better π–π stacking, show enhanced absorption spectra in visible range due to n–π* transition; and tune LUMO energy levels matching with those of donor materials in OSCs. Furthermore, 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone are very cheap and the preparation of them is relatively simple. They can be easily incorporated into π-conjugated systems to study the structure–property relationship of new non-fullerene acceptors.

In this research work, we have used 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone conjugated central electron withdrawing groups for designing and synthesizing two novel small molecule acceptors namely 6,6′-(5,5′-(9-oxo-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (DPP-FN-DPP) and 6,6′-(5,5′-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (DPP-ANQ-DPP) where the strong electron-withdrawing DPP moiety has been used as a common end capping group. DPP is another great choice of moiety due to its straightforward synthesis, fused planar nature for better charge transportation, good photochemical stability and strong light absorption features. The combination of electron withdrawing DPP moieties at the end of 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone central core acceptors can push the LUMO level further down. In comparison with polymer semiconductor electron acceptors, small molecule acceptors have some benefits including ease of synthesis, high purity, a definite molecular structure, low variation between different batches and good reproducibility in device performance. The in-depth optoelectronic properties of these newly developed non-fullerene acceptors have been studied in detail using optical, thermal and photoelectron spectroscopic techniques in combination with theoretical investigations. Both DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP molecular acceptors showed good thermal stability, appropriate energy levels, and strong absorption. The photovoltaic and morphological properties of both acceptors and their blends with the donor polymer, P3HT, have been studied using current–voltage characteristics as well as measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) methods. Solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on DPP-FN-DPP exhibited a PCE of 1.2%, which is higher compared to that of 0.7% exhibited by BHJ OSCs based on DPP-ANQ-DPP. The initial set of results clearly indicates the promising potential of 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone fused aromatics for designing new non-fullerene acceptors and functional materials for organic electronics.

In this work, three different conjugated segments via DPP, 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone were chosen to design and synthesize new acceptor materials. In order to induce solution processability in the DPP core, first 2-butyloctan-1-ol was converted into 5-(bromomethyl)undecane (1) via bromination and then reacted with 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, which gave the soluble DPP derivative, 2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (2), in a good yield. This compound was further converted into its monobromo derivative 3-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (3) using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Commercially available 2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one and 2,6-dibromoanthracene-9,10-dione were converted into their respective bisboronic ester analogs 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-one (4) and 2,6-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)anthracene-9,10-dione (5) using bis(pinacolato)diboron reagent (Scheme 1). The target compounds 6,6′-(5,5′-(9-oxo-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (DPP-FN-DPP) and 6,6′-(5,5′-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (DPP-ANQ-DPP) were prepared under classical Suzuki coupling conditions using monobromo alkylated DPP and bisboronic ester analogs of 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone, respectively (Scheme 2). All the synthesis process and the purification procedures were well reproducible and gave relatively high yields. Both the newly developed acceptors are readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, etc., which allowed for the purification of these compounds by column chromatography. The purity of all the synthesized precursors as well as final semiconductors was confirmed by NMR (see ESI). Due to the excellent solution processability of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-FN-DPP, the fabrication of solution-processed small molecule OSC devices was readily realized.

The thermal stability of the two new electron acceptors was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1). The temperature of 5% weight loss was chosen as the onset point of decomposition (Td). The thermal decomposition temperatures were approximately 373 and 367 °C for DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP, respectively. We further investigated the thermotropic properties of the two compounds by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 2). DPP-FN-DPP exhibited a sharp endothermic peak at 182 °C and a broad exothermic peak at about 130 °C in the second heating–cooling cycle, which is attributed to a melting and crystallizing phase transition. By comparison, DPP-ANQ-DPP showed higher melting and crystallization points at 240 and 191 °C, respectively. These results indicate that DPP-ANQ-DPP has a more rigid structure than DPP-FN-DPP. In addition, DPP-ANQ-DPP, which carries two CO groups, has a much sharper exothermic peak than DPP-FN-DPP with one CO group, indicating faster or easier crystallization of DPP-ANQ-DPP. Both novel small molecules showed good thermal stability which prevents the morphological degradation in OSCs and other electronic devices.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP in dilute chloroform solutions and spin-coated thin films are shown in Fig. 3. The optical properties of the two compounds are summarised in Table 1. DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP exhibit absorption profiles in the ultraviolet (300–450 nm) and visible (450 nm to 800 nm) regions of the spectrum. The short wavelength absorption is attributed to the n–π* and π–π* transition. Strong absorption maxima with a broad absorption profile in the long wavelength region are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) associated with the common thiophene-flanked DPP end-capping groups and 9-fluorenone/9,10-anthraquinone cores. In chloroform solution, the maximum absorption peaks in the longer wavelength region of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP were 585 and 574 nm, respectively, implying a stronger conjugation effect between DDP terminals and the 9-fluorenone core in DPP-FN-DPP. Comparing with that of solution, the maximum absorption of DPP-FN-DPP in the thin film showed a large red-shift of about 22–68 nm at 607 and 653 nm. Moreover, DPP-ANQ-DPP in solid state had a maximum absorption at 605 nm and a low-energy shoulder band in the range of 650–700 nm. This means the molecules could be well arranged and aggregated in solid state due to the strong intra- and intermolecular interactions, which may facilitate charge transport. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP was estimated from the absorption edges in the UV-vis spectra of thin films at 1.75 and 1.71 eV, respectively.

There is a strong relationship between the energy levels of electron accepting materials and the parameter of the resulting solar cells; therefore it is necessary to determine the energy levels of the two small molecules. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP were measured using the photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) technique using the spin coated thin films of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was calculated by taking the difference between the HOMO value and optical bandgap. The measured HOMO/LUMO energies of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP were found to be −5.56/−3.81 eV and −5.7/−3.99 eV, respectively (Fig. 4). It is clearly that DPP-ANQ-DPP showed markedly deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels (ΔE = 0.14 and 0.11 eV) relative to those of DPP-FN-DPP. This is a consequence of the more electron-accepting behaviour of the 9,10-anthraquinone moiety due to the presence of two CO groups, which enhances the electron-deficient property of DPP-ANQ-DPP. Furthermore, the energy offset between the HOMO of P3HT (−5.2 eV) and those of the two compounds (>0.3 eV) or the LUMO of P3HT (−3.2 eV) and those of DPP-FN-DPP/DPP-ANQ-DPP (>0.6 eV) were sufficiently large for photoinduced hole/electron transfer.
In order to rationalize the performance of the new small molecules, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP and ωB97XD levels of theory using the 6-31g(d,p) basis set were performed. The effect of the chloroform solvent was included by using a polarized continuum model. Absorption spectra were computed using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). Calculations were done using the Gaussian 09 software. As shown in Fig. 5, the HOMO and LUMO of DPP-FN-DPP are delocalized along the entire backbone, whereas the HOMO of DPP-ANQ-DPP is much more localized around the terminal functionalized DPP and its LUMO is more localized on the 9,10-anthraquinone unit. The computed HOMO/LUMO energy levels of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP are −4.98 (−6.83)/−2.91 (−1.34) eV and −5.11 (−6.94)/−3.17 (−1.54) eV, using the B3LYP and ωB97XD functionals, respectively. Although the theoretical calculations do not give the exact HOMO–LUMO values compared to the experimental ones, they are very useful for studying the energy level trends based on the ionization potential of the donor and electron affinity of the acceptor. The absolute frontier energy levels, both global hybrid functional and range separated hybrid functional calculations (which are required in the case of excitations with significant charge transfer character which can be surmised from Fig. 5) predict lower orbital energies and a lower gap with ANQ, consistent with the experimental observation. The absorption peak maxima are computed at 504 nm for FN and 498 nm for ANQ (ωB97XD), confirming the slight redshift on the FN spectrum observed experimentally (Fig. 3). The excitations are predominantly HOMO-to-LUMO. The computed absorption spectra are given in the ESI. The dihedral angles between the thiophene ring and the two central building blocks 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone were 22.8° and 16.9°, respectively.
To demonstrate the potential application of new non-fullerene acceptors in OSCs, we fabricated solution-processable BHJ devices with the classical polymer P3HT as the electron donor and either DPP-FN-DPP or DPP-ANQ-DPP as the electron acceptor. An ‘inverted’ device architecture was adopted with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PEIE/P3HT:Acceptor/MoOx/Ag. Further details of the device structure and fabrication can be found in the Experimental section. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of optimized P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP and P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP devices with photovoltaic performance data summarized in Table 2. The optimal performance of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP devices was achieved with 2:1 and 1:2 (wt/wt) blend compositions, respectively, with dichlorobenzene used as the solvent. A post-annealing treatment at 120 °C for 5 minutes was found to be critical for optimum performance, with the performance of the as-cast and annealed solar cells compared in Fig. 6. Solar cell devices prepared with DPP-FN-DPP as the acceptor achieved a VOC of 0.97 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 3.2 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 37.2%, and a PCE of 1.2%.Moreover, the optimal efficiency of DPP-ANQ-DPP acceptor based devices was relatively low with a PCE of 0.7%, a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 2.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 38.7%. The lower VOC of devices based on DPP-ANQ-DPP is the result of the relatively low-lying LUMO energy level, because it is well known that the VOC of OSCs is approximately proportional to the different between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. However, it is notable that organic solar cells comprising new acceptors showed higher VOC values than PC61BM devices with the same donor polymers by around 0.2–0.4 V, benefiting from the relatively high lying LUMO of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP. Annealing of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP based devices leads to a 50–60% increase in JSC with essentially no change in VOC. In the case of the P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP cell, the FF increases with annealing from ∼30% to 37%, while for the P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP cell the FF decreases slightly with annealing.

In order to correlate the effect of thermal annealing on the optical properties of thin films of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP, we performed UV-vis measurements for the as-cast films and those thermally annealed at 120 °C for 5 min (see Fig. S8, ESI). After thermal annealing, both compounds show a slight blue-shift. However, the increase in JSC with annealing is reflected in the EQE spectra of the devices, which are presented in Fig. 6c. In general, the EQE spectra extend from 300 to 700 nm with a maximum EQE value of 22.8% at ∼550 nm and 13.7% at ∼570 nm for the DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP cells, respectively. Both the donor and acceptor contribute to the EQE spectrum with the low energy onset attributed to absorption by the acceptor which possesses a lower bandgap than P3HT. The DPP-ANQ-DPP-based device also has a slightly lower EQE onset than the DPP-FN-DPP-based device, consistent with the lower band-gap of DPP-ANQ-DPP. With annealing, there are some subtle changes in the shape of the EQE spectra of both DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP cells, which can be more clearly seen in the normalized EQE spectra of Fig. S9 in the ESI. These spectral changes are qualitatively similar to the changes seen in the optical absorption spectrum of blends (see Fig. S10, ESI), suggesting an underlying change in morphology/microstructure with annealing.
To examine the microstructure of P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP and P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP blends, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements have been performed. Fig. 7 shows the GIWAXS images of the as-cast and annealed blends; the GIWAXS images of the as-cast and neat films can be found in the ESI (Fig. S11). For the as-cast P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP film, strong Bragg reflections can be seen consistent with ordered P3HT crystallites (compare with neat P3HT GIWAXS patterns in Fig. S11, ESI). With annealing, there is little change in the scattering features of P3HT; however, new peaks at ∼q = 3 Å−1 and q = 6 Å−1 are seen which are attributed to the crystallisation of the acceptor. Annealed neat films of DPP-FN-DPP (see Fig. S11, ESI) show Bragg reflections at these q values which are assigned to lamellar stacking of the DPP-FN-DPP molecules. The lack of other Bragg reflections in neat DPP-FN-DPP films indicates that DPP-FN-DPP is not especially crystalline (at least in thin-films) with the observed DSC transitions likely associated with liquid crystalline order rather than three-dimensional crystalline order. The as-cast films of DPP-FN-DPP also show no scattering features indicating a weak tendency to crystallise. For the P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP blend, in contrast, there is only weak ordering of P3HT chains in the as-cast film, indicating that DPP-ANQ-DPP acceptor molecules hinder the crystallisation of P3HT. The as-cast film also shows no ordering of the DPP-ANQ-DPP acceptor. With annealing, more well-defined peaks appear due to both P3HT and DPP-ANQ-DPP ordering. With annealing the degree of ordering of P3HT chains becomes comparable to that in the P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP films (comparing the intensity of the (100) peak and accounting for the reduced P3HT content in the P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP blend, see Table S1, ESI). However, the P3HT crystallites are smaller and are more highly oriented, with a narrower orientational distribution of edge-on crystallites. Similar to the neat films of DPP-FN-DPP, neat DPP-ANQ-DPP films also show no order with annealing leading to the appearance of liquid crystalline peaks.
These GIWAXS results show that the subtle variation in the chemical structure of DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP can lead to very different interactions between the P3HT donor and the acceptor. DPP-FN-DPP appears to weakly interact with P3HT allowing the crystallisation of P3HT in the as-cast films, with annealing promoting ordering of the acceptor phase. In contrast, DPP-ANQ-DPP appears to inhibit P3HT ordering in the as-cast films with P3HT chains only ordering with annealing. The smaller and more highly oriented edge-on crystallites in the annealed P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP films may also inhibit out-of-plane hole transport which is likely to have a detrimental effect on the hole mobility of the donor phase and may account for the poor performance of P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP cells compared to P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP cells.
To examine the morphology of the blends, AFM and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements have been performed. The AFM measurements (Fig. 8) show a relatively smooth film topography in all cases evidencing a lack of coarse phase separation or small molecule crystallisation. While surface roughness does not appreciably change with annealing, there does appear to be a coarsening in the lateral size of surface features suggesting morphological evolution with annealing. The R-SoXS measurements (Fig. S12, ESI) reveal that the as-cast blends are relatively well-mixed with feature sizes <100 nm consistent with the AFM results. For the as-cast P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP blend a broad peak is observed at q = 0.12 nm−1 corresponding to a 50 nm domain spacing. With annealing, the scattering intensity increases with new features appearing at high q suggesting the purification of domains. The as-cast P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP blend is characterised by a broader distribution with the shoulder at q = 0.2 nm−1 corresponding to a domain spacing of ∼30 nm. With annealing, this shoulder shifts to lower q (larger real space size) but without a significant increase in scattering intensity.
As previously discussed, the lower performance of the DPP-ANQ-DPP blend compared to the DPP-FN-DPP one may be attributed to the sub-optimum microstructure with DPP-ANQ-DPP inhibiting the crystallisation of P3HT which – based on the study of other P3HT-based devices – is necessary for high performance. However, the low performance of P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP solar cells especially when compared to P3HT:PC61BM cells is not immediately obvious. Annealed P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP blends appear to possess a favourable microstructure with nanoscale crystalline domains. The low fill factor of P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP cells then is likely symptomatic of either poor charge separation efficiency or charge collection efficiency. With regard to the charge separation efficiency, the shallower LUMO of DPP-FN-DPP compared to PC61BM may result in insufficient driving force for charge separation. As DPP-FN-DPP is a new material, its charge transporting properties are yet to be established and a lower electron mobility compared to PC61BM could explain the low cell efficiency. Ongoing photophysical and device measurements will help to distinguish between these effects.

In conclusion, two new acceptors based on differing electron-withdrawing moieties 9-fluorenone and 9,10-anthraquinone as the central building block and DPP moieties as end groups namely DPP-FN-DPP and DPP-ANQ-DPP were synthesized via the classical Suzuki coupling reaction. Both materials displayed good solubility in organic solvents, high thermal stability and a broad range of absorption from 300 to 700 nm in both solution and thin film. The difference in electron affinity of the central cores leads to differences in the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the two acceptors. A higher lying LUMO energy relative to PC61BM helps to achieve a high VOC. Polymer solar cells based on the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PEIE/P3HT:Acceptor/MoOx/Ag were fabricated to investigate the potential application of new materials in solution processed OSCs. The device with DPP-FN-DPP as the acceptor achieved the highest performances with a VOC of 0.97 V, JSC of 3.2 mA cm−2, FF of 37.2%, and PCE of 1.2%. The lower efficiency of the DPP-ANQ-DPP-based cells was attributed to a sub-optimal morphology with DPP-ANQ-DPP molecules inhibiting the crystallisation of P3HT chains.


All staring materials were purchased commercially as analytical reagents and used directly without any further purification. Compound 2,7-bis-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (4) was prepared according to the literature. The synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy performed on a Varian-400 spectrometer. The melting point of the compounds was measured by using Gallenkamp melting point apparatus. The elemental analyses of the synthesized compounds were carried out on an Elementar Vario macro/micro elemental analyser. Thermal analysis was performed using a Pegasus Q500TGA thermogravimetric analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted under nitrogen using a Chimera instruments Q100 DSC. The sample was heated at 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 300 °C. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Carry50 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements were conducted using an AC-2 photoelectron spectrometer (Riken-Keiki Co.).


The following synthesis was based on a modified literature procedure. Triphenylphosphine (26.23 g, 0.1 mol) was dissolved in DCM (200 mL) under argon for 15 minutes. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the addition of bromine (7.2 mL, 0.14 mol). After 2-butyloctan-1-ol (18.63 g, 0.1 mol) was added dropwise via an additional funnel over 30 minutes, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature overnight under argon. The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was extracted with an excess amount of hexane. Hexane was evaporated and the resulting crude yellow oil was purified on a silica gel column eluting with hexane. The title compound was isolated as a colourless oil (23.75 g, 95.3%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 3.45–3.44 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H), 1.61–1.56 (m, 1H), 1.28 (m, 16H), 0.92–0.87 (m, 6H).


3,6-Di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (3.0 g, 9.99 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (5.53 g, 40.0 mmol) were added to a dry 250 mL three-neck round flask and kept under vacuum for 30 minutes and then anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (120 mL) was added under argon to the above mixture. The mixture was allowed to heat up to 120 °C under argon for 1 hour. Then, 5-(bromomethyl)undecane (8.72 g, 35.0 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was further stirred for 24 hours at 120 °C. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, water and chloroform were added. The aqueous phase was extracted with 100 mL of chloroform three times and the combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using toluene as eluent to obtain the pure target product as a purple solid powder (3.31 g, 52%). Mp: 112 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 8.87–8.85 (dd, J1 = 4.0 Hz, J2 = 1.2 Hz, 2H), 7.63–7.61 (dd, J1 = 5.2 Hz, J2 = 1.2 Hz, 2H), 7.28 (m, 2H), 4.02–4.01 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 1.90 (m, 2H), 1.29–1.20 (m, 32H), 0.83 (m, 12H).

The mixture was then heated at 84 °C for 48 hours under argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with DCM, washed with water and brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent, the reaction mixture was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (chloroform:hexane = 1:1). This pale yellow powder was then washed with hexane to afford the title compound (2.94 g, 78%).

Devices were fabricated with an ‘inverted’ architecture as follows: ITO/ZnO/PEIE/Active Layer/MoOx/Ag. ITO-coated glass slides were sequentially sonicated in acetone and 2-propanol for ten minutes, followed by UV-ozone treatment for ten minutes. The zinc oxide precursor was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (220 mg) in 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol to form a 0.1 M solution. Ethanolamine (61 mg) was added as a stabilizer and the solution was stirred at 60 °C overnight under ambient conditions. A 0.4% PEIE solution was prepared by dissolving 40 mg PEIE in 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol. Both solutions were filtered before use and spin cast under ambient conditions. ZnO (4000 RPM) and PEIE (5000 RPM) films were annealed at 200 °C for thirty minutes and 120 °C for twenty minutes, respectively. The substrates were then transferred to a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere where active layers were spin cast to form films with thicknesses of 39 and 75 nm for P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP and P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP systems, respectively. P3HT (Mw = 60000 Da) was purchased from Rieke Metals and used as received. A 2:1 weight ratio of P3HT:DPP-FN-DPP was determined to be optimal, while a 1:2 ratio for P3HT:DPP-ANQ-DPP resulted in the best devices. Both systems were cast from 20 g L−1 solutions in dichlorobenzene. Immediately after films were deposited, the substrates were transferred to a hotplate where they were annealed at 120 °C for five minutes. 12 nm of molybdenum oxide followed by 100 nm of silver were then vacuum evaporated onto the substrates using an Angstrom Engineering Covap vacuum evaporator. A mask was used to produce eight identical pixels per substrate (4.5 mm2 active area each) during evaporation. Prior to characterization, devices were fitted with edge clips and encapsulated by epoxy and glass.

A Photo Emission Tech model SS50AAA solar simulator (calibrated using a silicon reference cell with a KG3 glass filter) was used to produce simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 spectrum) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated using a silicon reference cell with a KG3 filter (PV Measurements Inc.) Current voltage characteristics were acquired using a Keithley 2635 source meter. The EQE of working pixels was subsequently measured as a function of wavelength using a spot size less than the active area of the pixel. A monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130) was used to disperse light from a tungsten filament (Newport 250 W QTH). Prior to measurement, the system was calibrated using a photodiode (Thorlabs FDS-100CAL) placed at the device testing position.

GIWAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS/WAXS beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. 11 keV electrons were used with scattering patterns recorded on a Dectris Pilatus 1M detector. The incident angle of the X-ray beam was close to the critical angle of the polymer film but below the critical angle of the substrate, minimizing the background signal from substrate scatter. The X-ray exposure time was 3 s such that no film damage was identified. The sample-to-detector distance was calibrated using a silver behenate sample. The results were analyzed by using an altered version of NIKA 2D based in IgorPro.

AFM measurements were carried out on a Veeco Nanoscope V atomic force microscope (AFM) using the ScanAsyst mode.
R-SoXS measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source. Films were floated in deionized water, followed by transferring onto 100 nm SiN2 windows. The X-ray energy of 284.0 eV was chosen by calculating the scattering material contrast between PBDTTT-EFT and PC71BM. Scattered photons were collected by a Princeton PI-MTE in-vacuum CCD detector with 27.6 μm × 27.6 μm pixels. Two scattering patterns were collected at 30 mm and 150 mm sample-to-detector distances, respectively, and combined in software. Two-dimensional scattering patterns were reduced to one-dimensional profiles by using a customized version of NIKA.
