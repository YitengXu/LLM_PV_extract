Preparing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films by deploying vacuum-based methods, which are widely used for industrial thin-film deposition, is expected to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. In comparison with solution processes, vacuum-based deposition methods could provide some unique benefits for producing high-quality thin films, such as providing the ability to precisely determine the thickness of the film, producing a pinhole-free morphology, and high reproducibility. However, in the “two-step” method of preparing an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, the PbI2 films deposited using thermal evaporation are too dense to react with the organic component, leaving residual PbI2 in the perovskite. To address this issue, we developed a new doping strategy to help the crystal growth of Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx perovskites in the vapor–solid reaction process. By introducing a moderate amount of SrI2 into the PbI2 layer, we successfully enhanced the reactivity of PbI2 and improved the crystallinity of these perovskites. As a result, the perovskite solar cell based on such Sr-doped Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx films achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.66%. The device, without being encapsulated, maintained 95% of its initial PCE in an air atmosphere after 60 days. Moreover, the champion large-area (5 × 5 cm2) solar module exhibited a PCE of 13.92%, indicating the favorable uniformity of the Sr-doped Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx film.

In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted enormous attention due to their extraordinary optical and electronic properties. Due to these unique features, such perovskite materials are considered to be promising candidates for various optoelectronic devices, especially for solar cells. To date, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved for an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cell (PSC) is 25.2%, which is competitive with commercial silicon solar cells. Moreover, PSCs are easy to synthesize, and hence the costs of producing such PSC devices might be expected to decrease to a greater extent than might the costs of producing silicon solar cells. However, this record performance as well as most other demonstrations of PSC advances have resulted from tests on small devices (active area < 1 cm2). Therefore, the development of large-area PSCs modules is the next big step that must be achieved in order to commercialize such cells. Since organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films could easily be prepared via solution processes, several solution-based techniques including doctor-blade coating, slot-die coating, soft-cover deposition and spray coating have been developed to fabricate large-area perovskite films. For these solution-based techniques, methylammonuim lead iodide (MAPbI3) is the preferred perovskite material because of its ease of use in the fabrication of large-area films. However, the MA cation displays intrinsic thermal stress instability, rendering devices based on MAPbI3 perovskite susceptible to being degraded in actual working environments in which the temperature changes. Recently, CsxFA1−xPbI3−xBrx mixed-cation perovskites have, due to their superior long-term stability, attracted the interest of many researchers. Such MA-free perovskites need high annealing temperatures of up to 150 °C in order to endow them with a favorable thermal tolerance at temperatures below 85 °C. Considering the required temperature of the damp heat test (1000 h at +85 °C and 85% RH), CsxFA1−xPbI3−xBrx mixed-cation perovskites are more likely to pass the ICE standard for thin film solar cells (ICE 61646) in comparison with MA-containing perovskites. Huang and co-authors employed doctor-blade coating to prepare large-area perovskite films with and without the MA cation. MA-containing perovskite films exhibit a high average PCE exceeding 20%, much higher than that of MA-free perovskite (13.87%). Obviously, solution-based techniques are yet to be developed for the deposition of high-quality, MA-free organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.

Vacuum- or vapor-based deposition methods have been widely used in the thin-film coating industry for tens of years. These methods offer some unique benefits, not offered by solution processes, for high quality thin-films. These benefits include the ability to precisely determine film thickness, high uniformity and good compactness. Since as early as the late 1990s, vacuum thermal evaporation has been employed to fabricate layered organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite thin films in a stoichiometrically controlled manner. In recent years, the use of dual-source thermal evaporation to obtain high-quality MAPbI3−xClx, FAPbI3 and MAxCs1−xPbI3 perovskites has also been reported. However, this co-evaporation method could still not be used to effectively deposit large-area films because of the mismatch between the deposition rates of the organic and inorganic components, as well as the serious contamination to the high-vacuum system caused by the MAI or FAI. To address this issue, various vapor–solid reaction methods in the form of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have been explored to obtain large-area perovskite films. In our previous work, we employed thermal evaporation to deposit a CsBr/PbI2 composite film, and then reacted it with FAI/FACl vapor to obtain a large-area CsxFA1−xPbI3−xBrx perovskite film. After optimizing the conditions, the as-prepared PSCs achieved champion PCEs of 17.29% in a small device and 12.24% in a large-area module. Despite 12.24% being a record PCE for MA-free PCSs fabricated using the vapor–solid reaction method, the gap between the PCE of the large-area module and that of the small single device was too large to meet our expectations. After all, scale-up and large-area preparation should constitute the main advantage of such a vapor–solid reaction method.
Actually, regardless of how uniform the evaporated PbI2 film is, it is difficult to homogenously transform the PbI2 into perovskite in FAI vapor. Similar to the case of sequential printing process, a compactly deposited PbI2 film is also not suitable for the conversion to perovskite in a vapor–solid reaction. The dense and pinhole-free PbI2 layer would hinder the diffusion of the organic component, leaving residual PbI2 at the bottom of the film. Increasing the reaction time may eliminate the amount of residual PbI2 accumulating during the solution process. However, such increasing of the reaction time is not an ideal option for the vapor–solid reaction method since the PbI2 film exists in three possible phases, depending on the amount of FAI deposited, and since a long reaction time could also facilitate the formation of an “oversaturated” phase of perovskite. Thus, another solution is required to implement the fabrication of high-quality, large-area perovskite films using the vapor–solid reaction.
In the work described in this report, a new strategy was developed to enhance the conversion of compact PbI2 to perovskite in FAI vapor. By introducing a moderate amount of SrI2 into the PbI2 film, we successfully increased the rate of conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. After optimization, high-quality Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx perovskite films with large grain sizes were obtained via the vapor–solid reaction. Small PSCs based on these Sr-doped Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx perovskite films achieved a record-breaking PCE of 17.66%. Moreover, large-area PSC modules (5 × 5 cm2) were also fabricated and a champion PCE was reached of 13.92%, i.e., showing only a 21% PCE loss in the scale-up process. Though the PCE device needs to be further improved, these vacuum- and vapor-based techniques show favourable compatibility with the current solar cell industry. In addition to their scalability, these perovskite deposition methods offer advantages such as the avoidance of using toxic organic solvents and the ease of combining their products with commercial solar cells (silicon, CdTe, CIGS, etc.) in the form of tandem devices. Hence, we believe our research on the growth of perovskite crystals in a vapor–solid reaction process to be of great importance for efforts at commercializing PSCs.

Sr-doped perovskite films were prepared using a vapor–solid reaction method. As illustrated in Fig. 1, CsBr, SrI2 and PbI2 were first deposited, in sequence, using thermal evaporation. Then, various CsBr/PbI2 composite films with different amounts of SrI2 were reacted with FAI/FACl vapor in a tube furnace at 160 °C. The FAI/FACl vapor was generated from a FAI/FACl composite film, which was pre-deposited on a glass substrate using ultrasonic spray coating. After about 1 h of the solid–vapor reaction, the color of the composite films gradually changed in color from bright yellow to dark brown, indicating the formation of perovskite. By controlling the evaporation thickness of SrI2, we obtained a variety of Sr-doped Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx perovskite films, with SrI2 thicknesses of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 nm, respectively.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were taken of these samples to investigate the influence of SrI2 on the crystal growth. In the top-view images (Fig. 2), each of the Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx films show a compact and uniform morphology. In the control sample without SrI2 (Fig. 2a), the perovskite crystals exhibit a small average grain size of around 400 nm. The morphology of the sample with a 1 nm-thick layer of SrI2 in the film was observed to be similar to that of the control sample (Fig. 2b). However, when the thickness of SrI2 layer was increased to 2 nm, significantly larger grains appeared, with average dimensions of ∼600 nm (Fig. 2c). And when the thickness of the SrI2 layer was increased further to 4 nm, even larger perovskite crystals appeared, with average dimensions of over ∼800 nm (Fig. 2d). But when we further increased the content of SrI2, the grains became smaller (Fig. 2e and f). To identify the doped SrI2 in the perovskite crystal, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on these samples. As shown in Fig. S1, the binding energy of the Pb 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 signals appeared at around 138.57 and 143.45 eV, corresponding to the Pb2+ cation. A slight shift towards lower binding energy was observed both from the Pb 4f and I 3d spectral signals when a 4 nm-thick layer of SrI2 was added to the film. In order to verify the direction of this shift, we deliberately increased the thickness of the SrI2 layer from 30 to 120 nm. As shown in Fig. S1c and d, the shifting of the peaks became much more significant. Generally, the shifting of the peaks suggested that the incorporation of Sr2+ could change the chemical environments around these elements. And when 30 nm of SrI2 was added to the film, the characteristic Sr 3d peaks at 134.51 and 136.35 eV emerged (Fig. S1c, inset). Due to the lower electronegativity of Sr (0.95) than of Pb (2.33) and resulting weaker bonding energy of the Pb–I bond than of the Sr–I bond, the incorporation of Sr would lead to the peak shifting towards lower binding energies.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to identify the crystal structure of the films. As shown in Fig. 3a, the film without SrI2 exhibited obvious diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.1°, 28.6° and 32.1°, which were attributed to, respectively, the (101), (220) and (222) crystal planes of black FA-based perovskite. Also, a small peak at 2θ = 12.7° was observed, indicating the presence of residual PbI2 (diffraction of (001) crystal plane) in the film. Interestingly, as the thickness of the SrI2 layer was increased, the intensity of the PbI2 peak at 2θ = 12.7° gradually decreased, and at the same time the intensity of the perovskite peak at 2θ = 14.1° increased little by little. The sample with the 4 nm-thick SrI2 layer showed the strongest perovskite peak, and a weak PbI2 peak. As the thickness of the SrI2 layer was further increased (to 8 and 16 nm), the PbI2 peak totally disappeared, indicating a pure phase of perovskite. But this inclusion of excess SrI2 also coincided with a reduction of the peak intensity at 2θ = 14.1° and judging from this result apparently caused poor crystallization of the perovskite. We further compared the surface morphologies of the PbI2 films with 0, 4 and 120 nm thick layers of SrI2 (Fig. S2). With the 120 nm thick layer of SrI2 on the bottom of the film, the PbI2 film exhibited much smaller grains than did the pure PbI2. Hence, despite the lack of any significant change observed from the 4 nm SrI2/PbI2 sample, we still believe that a small amount of SrI2 could also to some extent affect the crystallization of PbI2. And as a result, the vapor–solid reaction process was concluded to have promoted the transformation of PbI2 to an FA-based perovskite.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the samples are presented in Fig. 3b. Generally, the spectra of all of the films showed each an absorption edge at ∼810 nm, which is characteristic of FA-based perovskite. The film with the 4 nm thick layer of SrI2 showed the strongest absorption over the wavelength range 650 nm to 750 nm. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were taken of the perovskite/glass samples to further understand the non-radiative recombination process for these films (Fig. 3c). Clearly, without a quenching layer, the intensity of the peak at ∼780 nm increased significantly as the SrI2 layer thickness was increased from 0 nm (bare) to 4 nm, but then declined as the thickness was increased further. The enhanced PL intensity can be attributed to the improved crystallinity of the perovskite. Moreover, inspection of the normalized PL spectra (Fig. 3d) showed a blue shift as the thickness of the SrI2 layer was increased, manifesting a lower trap density in the Sr-doped films.
To investigate the effect of SrI2 on the photovoltaic performance, PSCs with a planar SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture were fabricated. A distribution diagram of photovoltaic parameters of 6 batches of PSCs based on the perovskite doped with different amounts of SrI2 is shown in Fig. S3, and the detailed parameters of the corresponding champion devices are summarized in Table S1. The control, i.e., without SrI2 doping, presented a PCE of 14.6%, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.66 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.055 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.670. As the SrI2 content was increased, the PCE value of the device exhibited an upward trend first and then declined. When the thickness of the SrI2 layer was 4 nm, the device showed a record-breaking PCE of 17.66% with a Voc of 1.021 V, Jsc of 21.94 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.789 (Fig. 4a). The improvement in Jsc was checked by acquiring incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx device doped using the 4 nm-thick layer of SrI2 displayed a high IPCE value of ∼80% over the whole wavelength range 450 nm to 780 nm (Fig. 4b). The integrated current density of the device was 21.20 mA cm−2, in agreement with the Jsc derived from the J–V curve. The steady-state output current density of the champion device was also measured at the maximum power point (0.84 V). The device showed a stable PCE of 15.71% with a current density of 21.94 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the champion module with 6 sub-cells connected in series (see Fig. 4d, inset) achieved a high PCE of up to 13.92%, showing only a loss of 21% of PCE in the scale-up process. The long-term stability levels of the modules without encapsulation were determined in ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. S4, after being stored in ambient conditions for over 40 days without being encapsulated, the module based on the Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx perovskite film doped using the 4 nm thick layer of SrI2 maintained >95% of its initial PCE value. However, the module without SrI2 doping lost ∼40% of its performance.

In summary, we demonstrated that, by adding a moderate amount of SrI2 into a thermal-evaporated PbI2 layer that the conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite in FAI/FACl vapor could be promoted. The as-prepared Cs0.24FA0.76PbI3−xBrx perovskite film with a 4 nm thick layer of SrI2 showed a favorable film quality with large grain sizes and low trap-state density. PSCs based on such films achieved a champion PCE of 17.66% with a high FF of up to 0.79. Moreover, the large-area PSC module exhibited a promising PCE of 13.92%, with an aperture area of 16.07 cm2. Despite the large-area module still having suffered a 21% PCE loss in the scale-up process, we believe that this SrI2-doping strategy could provide new opportunities for high-performance perovskite solar modules fabricated using the vacuum- and vapor-based deposition method.


FTO glasses were first etched by using a femtosecond laser (Universal Laser Systems, VLS2.30), and the glasses were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, and anhydrous ethanol, respectively. A mass of 5 g of urea, a volume of 100 μL of thioglycolic acid, and a volume of 5 mL of hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) were sequentially dissolved in 400 mL of deionized water, and then SnCl2·2H2O powder was added to this solution to obtain a solution of 12 mM SnCl2·2H2O that was stored in a refrigerator for use. The as-cleaned FTO glass was soaked in a diluted form of this SnCl2·2H2O solution (2 mM) for 4 h at 70 °C and then washed with deionized water and dried by using a gas gun. Then, the substrates were annealed at 180 °C for 1 h on a hotplate. CsBr, SrI2 and PbI2 were deposited sequentially on UV-light-processed SnO2 substrates by performing thermal evaporations. Specifically, a 30 nm-thick layer of CsBr was deposited at a rate of 0.4 Å s−1. Then SrI2 films, with a different thickness for each different sample, were deposited at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1. On the top of the SrI2, a 280 nm-thick layer of PbI2 was deposited at a rate of 5 Å s−1. Then, the samples were transferred into a CVD furnace and made to react with FAI/FACl vapor generated from an FAI/FACl composite film (3:1 in wt%) that had been pre-deposited on the glass substrates by performing ultrasonic spray coating. For the vapor–solid reaction, the tube furnace was first washed with N2. Then, the tube furnace was heated up to 160 °C and left at this temperature for 60 min during which time the SrI2/CsBr/PbI2 composite films were gradually transformed into the Cs0.24FA0.76Pb1−xSrxI3−yBry perovskite. The sample films were then cooled down. Then, volumes of 25 μL of a spiro-OMeTAD solution (73 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 18 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), 29 μL FK209 (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine in 1 mL chlorobenzene) were spun on the perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 60 nm-thick layer of Au was evaporated on the top of spiro-OMeTAD as the back electrode to complete the device. The method used to fabricate the large-area perovskite solar modules was similar to that used to fabricate the small ones.


X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained by using a PL microscopic spectrometer (Flex One, Zolix, China). UV measurements were taken using a UV-Vis spectrometer (lambda 750S, PerkinElmer). The morphologies and compositions of the samples were investigated by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Zeiss Ultra Plus). The J–V curves of these PSCs were acquired using a Keithley 2400 source meter at room conditions. The light source was a solar simulator (Oriel 94023 A, 300 W) to match AM 1.5 G. The intensity of the light was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a standard silicon reference solar cell (Oriel, VLSI standards). The active areas of small-size PSCs and PSC modules were 0.16 cm2 and 16.07 cm2, respectively.
