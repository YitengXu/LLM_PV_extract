We demonstrate effective structural control of various electron-donating moieties containing bithiophene (BT) and naphthalene derivatives with 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene in a regular terpolymer system and compare the properties of these polymers with those of the three binary copolymers PDPPNp, PDPPBT, and PDPPFBT. PDPPBF and PDPPNF were successfully synthesized to be diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based terpolymers. The optical and electronic properties of these regular terpolymers could be precisely controlled by introducing three different components in the repeating units. A polymer solar cell (PSC) made of PDPPNF, which contains naphthalene as a weak donating unit, had a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.77 V, resulting from a relatively deep HOMO energy level. In contrast, PDPPBF bearing BT, which is an example of a relatively strong electron-donating unit, had a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc = 13.44 mA cm−2) than that of PDPPFBT. Therefore, improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) was possible in a PSC made of PDPPBF containing the electron-donating bithiophene unit in the terpolymer backbone. However, the improved internal morphology, as characterized by AFM and TEM, was the primary contributor to the enhanced PCEs (i.e., 6.38% and 6.39% for PDPPBF and PDPPNF, respectively).

Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers have received much attention as suitable p-type materials for use in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells due to strong absorptivity in the wavelengths characteristic of solar emissions, high charge carrier mobilities, suitable energy level matching with n-type molecules (e.g., fullerene derivatives), and crystalline morphologies with molecular orientations that enable optimum transport of charge carriers to the corresponding electrodes. Consequently, much effort has been devoted to the design and optimization of new photoactive materials; in particular, attempts have been made to improve the open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit current densities (Jsc), and fill factors (FF) of these materials by varying their compositions in BHJ-solar cells.

In BHJ-type polymer solar cells (PSC) containing soluble fullerene derivatives, the conjugated p-type polymers are of intrinsic importance to increase Jsc, Voc, and FF in order to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). First, to obtain a high Voc, the p-type polymers must have deep HOMO energies because Voc is directly proportional to the gap between the HOMO and LUMO of the p-type polymer and the n-type molecule, respectively.
Concerning the optimization of Jsc, the p-type polymers must have intrinsically low bandgaps (Eg), and this can be achieved by simultaneously incorporating donor and acceptor moieties into the polymer backbone. Additionally, to facilitate charge transport and charge separation, the combined p- and n-type materials must have a large interfacial area while maintaining a favorable nano-scale crystalline domain size. However, a trade-off problem is often encountered; that is, a deep HOMO level of the p-type polymer and its low Eg are difficult to achieve by structural design. Therefore, various structural changes to the backbone of D–A conjugated polymers have been attempted based on the structure–property relationships to optimize the polymer properties for enhancing the PCEs of PSCs.
Among many attempts to optimize the polymer structure in order to achieve high PCEs, terpolymer systems have been studied intensely to gain an understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure and photovoltaic (PV) properties of PSCs. Terpolymers, which are composed of three different monomeric units in the polymer backbone, are promising candidates as efficient p-type molecules because the addition of a third component to D–A alternating copolymers can fine-tune the properties of the resultant polymer such as the energy levels and the morphology of the blend film made of p- and n-type semiconducting materials.
In our previous report, new regular and random diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based terpolymers (i.e., Reg-PBDPPT and Ran-PBDPPT, respectively) bearing DPP as an electron deficient unit and 2,2′-bithiophene and (E)-1,2-di(thiophen-2-yl)ethene as electron donating units were synthesized and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. Although PSC devices based on terpolymers can have high Jsc values, their PCE values are still low because of their inherently low Voc values. Therefore, new polymer structures that avoid these problems must be developed to form devices with much higher PCEs.
One of the efficient methods to direct the semiconducting properties is to use fluorinated aromatic rings. These are known to have a pronounced effect on the energy levels of the corresponding polymers. Additionally, the C–F bonds in the polymer backbone promote strong electrostatic interactions between the polymer chains. Because of these factors, PSCs based on polymers containing fluorinated bithiophenes show significantly enhanced Jsc, Voc, and FF, and as a consequence, high PCEs.
Also, we previously found that an isoindigo-based (IID) copolymer formed with 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (FBT) as the fluorinated moiety showed a highly increased Voc of 1.01 V compared to the non-fluorinated IID-based copolymer (Voc = 0.87 V).
In this study, we synthesized two DPP-based terpolymers containing two typical donating units, naphthalene or bithiophene, and 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (FBT), which was used as the fluorinated aromatic unit. The physical properties and PSC device performances of these terpolymers were investigated. Introduction of bithiophene into the backbone of a D–A copolymer results in high crystallinity and in improved electron donating ability and charge transport performance. In contrast, the polymer containing naphthalene units had a low-lying HOMO energy because naphthalene is a weak donor. Additionally, PDPPNp and PDPPBT, two binary copolymers that contain naphthalene and bithiophene, respectively, were also synthesized as control polymers. Compared with the PSCs with D–A alternating copolymers, the terpolymer-based PSCs PDPPBF and PDPPNF showed much improved PCEs of 6.38% and 6.39%, respectively. Therefore, our regular terpolymer system is a promising candidate for PSCs made with fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors with improved performance.


1H NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 MHz Varian Mercury spectrometer as a solution in deuterated chloroform containing tetramethylsilane as a standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CDCl3). The contents of elements (C, H, N, and S) in the synthesized compounds were measured using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) elemental analyzer.

The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Agilent GPC 1200 series) using a polystyrene standard in o-dichlorobenzene (T = 80 °C), which was used as the eluent.
To measure UV-vis absorption spectra, thin films of the five polymers were prepared on glass substrates by spin coating using chloroform solutions of the polymers (0.7 wt% in CHCl3). The absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and as spun-cast films were recorded on a HP 8453 photodiode array UV-vis absorption spectrometer.
The oxidation properties of the five polymers were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using an eDAQ EA161 potentiostat. Polymer thin films were fabricated by drop-casting on a Pt wire using a chloroform solution. The electrolyte solution was 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in freshly distilled acetonitrile. The reference electrode was composed of Ag/AgCl, while the counter electrode was prepared with a platinum wire (diameter = 0.5 mm, scan rate = 5.0 mV s−1).
To characterize the topography of the polymer surface, atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Advanced Scanning Probe Microscope, XE-100, PSIA) was used. Polymers and PC71BM blend films were prepared in the same way as those used for the corresponding device fabrication.
Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were carried out at the PLS-II 9A ultra-small angle X-ray scattering beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (energy = 11.04 keV, wavelength (λ) = 1.123 Å, 2θ = 0–20°). The scattering vectors qxy and qz are the components parallel and perpendicular to the film surface, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured with a Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (FEI Inc.) operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV.

Indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol in sequence for 10 min each. For conventional polymer solar cells, a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P 4083) thin film was spin-coated (4000 rpm for 40 s) on the surface of ITO patterned glass after UV-ozone treatment for 20 min onto the substrates. For conventional PSCs, the PEDOT:PSS layer was thermally annealed at 155 °C for 15 min, and the measured thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was ∼40 nm. For inverted solar cells, a ZnO thin film was prepared on the surface of ITO patterned glass, which was treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. The ZnO layer was thermally annealed at 200 °C for 1 h, and the measured thickness of the ZnO layer was ∼50 nm.

The preparation of the two different configurations of PSCs shares the following common steps. The donor and acceptor material blends had a blend ratio of 1:1.5. These were dissolved in chloroform with 3 vol% diphenylether (DPE) and stirred overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The photoactive layer (120 nm) was spin-coated with the blended solution on the top of the ZnO (or PEDOT:PSS) layer. Subsequently, to form a conventional PSC, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited onto the photoactive layer using a thermal evaporator at a pressure of about 10−6 Torr to produce an active area of 0.04 cm2 using shadow masks. For inverted PSCs, the anode was composed of MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm); and the anode was deposited onto the photoactive layer using the same evaporation method as above. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used to investigate the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics in the dark and under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, which was generated using a solar simulator (Oriel, 1000 W). An AM 1.5 filter (Oriel) and a neutral density filter were used to adjust the desired light intensity. The incident light intensity was measured with a calibrated broadband optical power meter (Spectra Physics, Model 404).

The hole and electron carrier mobilities were determined using the modified Mott–Gurney equation.

The device configuration of hole-only devices was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (100 nm) and the electron-only devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). The polymer–PC71BM solution (15 mg mL−1) in chloroform containing 3 vol% DPE as an additive was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s under ambient conditions. After spin-coating the solution, the blend film was dried and LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) or Au (100 nm) was deposited on the top of the blend film under vacuum.

All reagents used to synthesize the desired products were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Acros Organics, and TCI. Some chemicals used for specific reactions were purified when required.

The synthetic procedures for monomers and polymers are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. PDPPFBT was synthesized by the introduction of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (FBT) as a fluorinated donating unit. Additionally, we successfully synthesized two alternating regular terpolymers, PDPPBF and PDPPNF, to compare the properties of these with those of the three D–A alternating copolymers PDPPNp, PDPPBT, and PDPPFBT.

To prepare the two kinds of terpolymers, the monomers (M2 and M4) were synthesized from mono-brominated DPP, 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, and 2,6-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxabrolan-2-yl)naphthalene. M2 and M4 were prepared through typical Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling and Suzuki coupling reactions, respectively. Then, the monomers M3 and M5, used for polymerization, were prepared by the bromination of M2 and M4, respectively, with NBS.
Synthetic procedures for all these polymers are shown in Scheme 2. PDPPNp was synthesized by Suzuki coupling and the other polymers were prepared by Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reactions. All polymers were purified by precipitation in methanol and Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane, and chloroform, successively. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) measured by GPC were 109.2, 162.6, 148.4, 161.9, and 65.0 kDa for PDPPNp, PDPPBT, PDPPFBT, PDPPBF, and PDPPNF, respectively (T = 80 °C in o-dichlorobenzene). Although polymers containing 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene are known to be poorly soluble compared with those bearing non-fluorinated bithiophene moieties, the five conjugated polymers show good solubility in chlorinated solvents (e.g., chloroform and trichloroethylene) as well as halogenated aromatic solvents (e.g., chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene etc.)

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solutions and film states and the cyclic voltammograms (CVs), in film states, of five DPP-based polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and S1. The resulting parameters are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectra of the five polymers displayed dual absorption bands at 350–500 nm and at 500–900 nm. The band at the short wavelength is typically due to π–π* transitions and the other band at the long wavelength is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units in the polymer backbone.

Compared to the absorption spectrum of the PDPPFBT copolymer, that of PDPPNF was blue-shifted upon the introduction of naphthalene, which is a weak donating group, into the backbone. In contrast, the spectrum of PDPPBF was slightly red-shifted from that of PDPPFBT due to bithiophene, which is a good electron-donating group. Both spectra of terpolymers PDPPBF and PDPPNF are positioned between those of the two copolymers (PDPPBT and PDPPNP with PDPPFBT), respectively.
We found that the absorption range of terpolymers can be effectively tuned by varying the composition of the units of the terpolymer backbone. In addition, the thin films of all polymers had broader absorption bands than those in solution as was evidenced by larger full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and this broadening is due to stronger intermolecular interaction between polymer backbones (see Table 1). Furthermore, the absorption coefficients of the two terpolymer films are higher than those of the other copolymers, and this might be beneficial for absorbing the solar emission in PSCs.
The optical bandgap energies of the three D–A alternating copolymers were 1.60, 1.67, and 1.40 eV for PDPPNp, PDPPBT, and PDPPFBT, respectively, and the optical bandgaps of the terpolymers PDPPBF and PDPPNF are 1.42 and 1.51 eV, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, the regular terpolymer has bandgaps of intermediate energy, formed by combining the DPP acceptor and two different donors in one repeating group; therefore, using this method, the energy can be tuned precisely. The HOMO level measured by CV was −5.41 eV for PDPPFBT based on its onset oxidation potential, and this energy is low due to the presence of the electron withdrawing F-substituent in bithiophene. The HOMO energies of the terpolymers are −5.35 and −5.39 eV, respectively, which indicates that the addition of fluorinated bithiophene into the PDPPFBT backbone increases the electron-withdrawing character of PDPPBF. In the case of PDPPNF, the HOMO level was located between those of PDPPNp and PDPPFBT.

The optimized PSC devices were fabricated with an inverted structure (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag), where the active layer was fabricated with a blend solution of polymer and PC71BM in chloroform. The optimal weight ratio of donor and acceptor was 1:1.5 with 3 vol% of diphenylether (DPE) as a solvent additive. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the inverted PSCs are shown in Fig. 3, and the results of conventional PSCs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al) are also shown in Fig. S3. The device parameters obtained from PSCs are summarized in Table 2 for inverted PSCs and in Table S1 for conventional PSCs.

Although the PDPPFBT-based PSC had a higher Voc of 0.77 V, resulting from the presence of 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene, compared to PDPPBT (Voc = 0.61 V), the value of Jsc for PDPPFBT was limited to 8.08 mA cm−2. The Voc of the PDPPBF terpolymer was measured to be 0.70 V, which is between those of PDPPBT and PDPPFBT, and this is because the HOMO of PDPPBF lies between those of PDPPBT and PDPPFBT. The Jsc value of PSCs made of terpolymers increased to 13.44 mA cm−2 compared to that of copolymers (i.e., Jsc = 11.33 mA cm−2 for PDPPBT and Jsc = 8.08 mA cm−2 for PDPPFBT). Consequently, the PDPPBF terpolymer displayed a much improved PCE value (η ≈ 6.34%), which is higher than those of PSCs made of copolymers (η ≈ 4.70% for PDPPBT and 4.47% for PDPPFBT).
In the case of a PDPPNF-based PSC, the Voc value is almost comparable to those of PSCs made of PDPPFBT and PDPPNp copolymers because of their similarly deep HOMO energy levels. However, because of the higher FF value, the PCE of PSCs comprising PDPPNF was much larger, and this will be discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 3b and d. PDPPFBT has a poor light-harvesting behavior in the long wavelength region (λ = 600–900 nm), as was expected due to the relatively low absorption coefficient (α) in Fig. 1b. However, when BT and Np were combined with 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene into the building block for terpolymers, PDPPBF and PDPPNF, relatively high EQEs were observed in the long wavelength region (i.e., λ = 700–800 nm). This is the crucial factor necessary for a higher Jsc value in the corresponding PSCs. Therefore, we conjecture that the well-optimized nano-phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM crystallites was effectively achieved by a moderate degree of molecular demixing. This explanation will be supported by observing the surface topography of the active layer by AFM and the internal morphology with transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Aside from the morphological issues affecting the PV performances, the charge transport properties of holes and electrons are important factors governing the Jsc and FF. To probe the charge-transport behaviors of active layers, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, and the results are presented in Fig. 4 and S4 and Table 2. The μe values for the five polymers were quite similar (1.88–5.36 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the presence of an identical DPP moiety. They displayed μh values in the range of 1.02 × 10−5 to 6.46 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Accordingly, the μh/μe ratio for PDPPNF was significantly low (1.96), which implies that the charge transport of electrons and holes was well balanced. A small ratio correlates with increased FF based on the value of PSCs containing PDPPNF films (FF = 76%).
A deeper understanding of the charge recombination behavior in the PSCs can be obtained by analyzing the light-intensity dependence of Jsc of the PVs, which is regarded as one of the determining factors influencing the FF value of PSCs. It has already been suggested that Jsc is related by a power-law dependence to light power Plight (Jsc ∝ Plightα), where the power-law component (α) should be unity when the bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers is highly suppressed. As shown in Fig. 4c, the theoretically fitted α value is 0.91 for PVs based on PDPPBF, while PVs based on PDPPNF showed a remarkably higher α value of 0.98. This result suggests that bimolecular recombination was significantly suppressed in PSCs composed of PDPPNF. The quenching of charge recombination also correlates well with the higher charge carrier mobilities of the devices mentioned above and could contribute partially to the higher FF of 76.78% for the PSC with PDPPNF.
To gain more evidence for the effect of the internal morphology of the polymer and acceptor material blends in the PDPPBF:PC71BM and PDPPNF:PC71BM devices, 2D GIWAXS was employed and the results of the PDPPFBT:PC71BM, PDPPBF:PC71BM, and PDPPNF:PC71BM blend films are illustrated in Fig. S5a–c. Compared with the PDPPNF:PC71BM blend film, a predominant face-on orientation of PDPPBF polymer chains is visible in the PDPPBF:PC71BM blends. Face-on orientations of polymer chains are more favorable for efficient exciton diffusion/charge transport and dissociated charge collection in PSC electrodes vertically. Therefore, this result confirms that the face-on orientation of polymer chains in films blended with PDPPBF is due to its high rigidity compared to PDPPNF.
The surface and internal morphologies of the active PV layers were observed using AFM and TEM to understand in more detail the improved performance of the terpolymers compared to those of the three copolymers. The morphology of the material is an important factor that can prevent exciton diffusion, giving rise to low Jsc values and poor PCE values. The surface morphology of the PDPPFBT blend film with PC71BM was observed to have coarse dispersive domains compared with those of terpolymers (Fig. 5b and c). On the other hand, very fine nano-phase morphologies were observed for terpolymer films, which might result in favorable exciton diffusion and dissociated charge transport.

PDPPBF and PDPPNF terpolymer films show well-formed fibril-like structures; these facilitate exciton diffusion to the interface of the polymer and PC71BM; therefore, we expect better exciton dissociation in this polymer than in other copolymers (PDPPNp, PDPPBT, and PDPPFBT) (Fig. 5d–f and S6). In particular, the TEM image of the terpolymer PDPPBF shows a finer and denser texture and better defined nano-phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM crystallites than that of PDPPNF.
In summary, the incorporation of two different donating units into the DPP-based terpolymer backbone provided an efficient means of (1) tuning the optical and electrochemical properties and (2) optimizing the BHJ morphology, resulting in optimal performances of the PSCs.


PDPPFBT, bearing fluorinated bithiophene as the donating units, was synthesized. Fluorinated donating units were used to decrease the HOMO energy levels, allowing the relatively high-lying HOMO energy levels of the DPP accepting units to be overcome. However, the performance of devices fabricated with PDPPFBT was poor, having a PCE of 4.47% and a low Jsc value (8.08 mA cm−2).

To improve the internal morphology and tune the energy levels efficiently, a terpolymer system was employed to alter the structure of PDPPFBT copolymers. As additional donating units, we selected bithiophene and naphthalene as examples of strongly and weakly donating units, respectively. As a result, PDPPBF containing both bithiophene and fluorinated bithiophene showed a much increased Jsc (13.44 mA cm−2), resulting in a high PCE (η ∼ 6.38%). Furthermore, PDPPNF also showed improved performance (PCE = 6.39%) of PVs with high Voc (0.77 V) and FF (76.78%) when using the regular terpolymer system. The various donating units were included in the building block of terpolymers, resulting in enhanced device properties for PVs compared with those of conventional D–A copolymers.
