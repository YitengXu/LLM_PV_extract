Semitransparent organic solar cells (OSCs) have great potential for vehicle-integrated and building-integrated photovoltaics with their rapidly increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). For these purposes, the efficiency of semitransparent OSCs at an adequate transparency should be further increased. In this work, a ladder-type dithienonaphthalene-based acceptor (DTNIF) with a high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level is used as a third component material for ternary OSCs which show increased PCEs with enlarged values in open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor. Consequently, outstanding PCEs of 16.73% and 13.49% are achieved for the corresponding opaque and semitransparent ternary OSCs, respectively. The efficiency of 13.49% for the semitransparent OSCs at an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 22.58% is the highest reported to date, to the best of our knowledge. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance semitransparent OSCs at high AVT values by using an excellent third component acceptor material.

Although the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of opaque organic solar cells (OSCs) has exceeded 17%, the trade-off relationship between the average visible transmittance (AVT) and light-harvesting ability of OSCs inhibits the PCE improvement of semitransparent OSCs (STOSCs). Herein, a ladder-type dithienonaphthalene-based acceptor (DTNIF) with a high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level is used as a third component material for ternary STOSCs. The best-performance ternary STOSC yields an outstanding PCE of 13.49% with an AVT of 22.58%, which is a record high PCE reported to date. Meanwhile, the ternary STOSCs exhibit improved stabilities as well as better colour perception in comparison with the corresponding binary STOSCs. This work affords an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance STOSCs with the aid of a suitable third component material.


In the past two decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their advantages of solution processability, light weight and semi-transparency. As an important extention towards real applications, semitransparent OSCs (STOSCs) have attracted increasing attention because they can potentially be integrated with see-through elements such as colorful buildings and automobile windows to generate electric power. There are two key parameters, namely the average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), to evaluate the performance of STOSCs. Although the best PCE of opaque OSCs has reached more than 17%, the PCE of the best-performance STOSC with an AVT around 22% is lagging far behind due to the trade-off between the AVT and the PCE. To achieve high PCEs at a certain AVT, minimized absorption intensities in the visible region are required for the active layer materials, interlayers and electrodes. Therefore, researchers have devoted their efforts to developing new active layer materials with weak absorption in the visible region but intense absorption in the near IR region. For instance, Zhan et al. reported a narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (FNIC2) for STOSCs with a best PCE of 9.51% at an AVT of 20.3%. Bai et al. reported the use of new interface materials and optical coupling to fabricate STOSCs with a PCE of 12.88% at an AVT of more than 20%. Despite these efforts, the best PCE of STOSCs with 22% AVT is still less than 13%, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, new strategies to fabricate STOSCs with improved PCEs and high AVTs are still needed.

Recently, the ternary blend strategy was demonstrated to be effective to improve the photovoltaic performance of opaque OSCs. For example, Wei et al. reported that the incorporation of a small molecule donor material of p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM host blend may form an alloy and increase the crystallinity of the ternary blend film. Thus, the best-performance ternary device based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM:p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 exhibited a PCE of 10.5%, which is higher than that of the binary device based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM (9.2%). At the same time, non-fullerene acceptors were often used as the third component material to modulate the morphology of the active layer. Chen et al. reported that the use of non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F as the third component not only broadened the absorption range of the device, but also served as a morphology-adjusting material to inhibit excessive aggregation of the other non-fullerene acceptor (IXIC-4Cl), thereby leading to favorable phase separation of the resulting ternary active layer. Therefore, the best-performance ternary OSC based on PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F:IXIC-4Cl achieved a high PCE of 14.96%. In one of our recent studies, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTF) was introduced as an efficient third component acceptor in the binary blends of J71:ITIC and PM6:Y6 to achieve ternary PSCs with improved PCEs of 12.35% and 16.53%, respectively. The incorporation of BTF not only can enhance the light-harvesting of the active layer, thereby increasing the short-circuit current (JSC), but also can help to improve the crystallinity, charge transport and exciton dissociation of the active layer, thereby leading to enhancements in both the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Thus, the ternary blend strategy is also expected to increase the PCEs of STOSCs when suitable third component materials are used.
Our group recently developed a ladder-type dithienonaphthalene-based acceptor (DTNIF) which showed a PCE of 8.73% when paired with a wide bandgap copolymer of PBDB-T. Despite the moderate PCE for the DTNIF-based binary device, the good crystallinity and high-lying LUMO level of DTNIF would be beneficial for improving VOC as well as the active layer morphology of the resulting ternary OSCs. In this context, DTNIF is incorporated as a third component material in the benchmark binary active layer of PBDB-TF:Y6 to fabricate high-performance ternary OSCs. The resulting ternary devices show increased values in JSC, VOC and FF. Thus, the best-performance opaque ternary OSC shows a much higher PCE of 16.73% compared to that of the binary OSC based on PBDB-TF:Y6 (15.31%). The improved photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the complementary absorption and better active layer morphology with improved and more balanced charge transport in the ternary devices. More importantly, the incorporation of DTNIF as the third component leads to high-performance ternary STOSCs which can deliver an outstanding efficiency of 13.49% at an AVT of 22.58%, representing the best PCE to date for STOSCs with AVTs above 20%.

For the ternary devices, two acceptor materials (Y6 and DTNIF) and one donor material (PBDB-TF) are used for the active layer and their chemical structures are presented in Fig. 1a. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of neat PBDB-TF, DTNIF, and Y6 films are shown in Fig. 1b. The polymer donor PBDB-TF exhibits an absorption band ranging from 400 to 700 nm. Meanwhile, Y6 displays a broad absorption band in the range of 600–930 nm, and DTNIF has a stronger absorption band in the range of 550–750 nm. Obviously, the absorption bands of the three materials are complementary, which is in favor of enhanced light-harvesting of the ternary blend active layer. Furthermore, the absorption spectra of the blend films with different blend ratios were also obtained (shown in Fig. S1, ESI). As the content of DTNIF increases, the absorption intensity of the blend film in the range of 600–700 nm gradually increases. It is found that the PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF blend film with a weight ratio of 1:1.1:0.1 shows a relatively broad and flat absorption band in the range of 300–930 nm, which may lead to an increased JSC value.

To explore the energetic interaction of the three components, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments of the blend films were performed. As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI), the intensities in the PL spectra (excited at 580 nm) for the two binary blend films are much lower than that of the neat PBDB-TF film. By contrast, the PL of the ternary blend film is more completely quenched (99.6%), indicating more efficient electron transfer in the ternary active layer in comparison with that in the binary active layers (91.2% for PBDB-TF:Y6 and 94.6% PBDB-TF:DTNIF). Similarly, compared with the neat Y6 film, the ternary blend film exhibits a dramatically reduced PL intensity when excited at 800 nm (Fig. S2b, ESI). These results reveal that there is efficient charge transfer in the ternary blend system. Fig. 1c and d depict the device structure and energy levels of the active layer materials and other components used for the ternary device. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PBDB-TF is −5.56 eV. The LUMO level of DTNIF (−3.92 eV) is slightly higher than that of Y6 (−4.10 eV), but it is exactly located in between the LUMO energy levels of PBDB-TF (−3.50 eV) and Y6. Thus, the third component material (DTNIF) can play a bridging role in the cascade electron transfer, which can reduce the energy loss during the exciton dissociation. Moreover, the incorporation of DTNIF can provide an additional channel for electron transfer, which is beneficial for the increased charge generation of the ternary blend.

In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the binary and ternary blend systems, OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Ag (Fig. 1d), where PEDOT:PSS and PDIN are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) and 2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthrax[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H) tetraone, respectively. The total weight ratio of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) was fixed at 1.0:1.2, while the acceptor ratio between DTNIF and Y6 was varied. All the active layers with a thickness of ∼100 nm delivered the best device performance when they were spin-coated from their chloroform solutions. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the binary and ternary OSCs based on PBDB-TF:Y6 (1.0:1.2, w/w), PBDB-TF:DTNIF (1.0:1.2, w/w) and PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF (1.0:1.1:0.1, w/w), respectively. Their device parameters are summarized in Table 1. At the same time, the device parameters of the binary OSCs based on PBDB-TF:DTNIF and PBDB-TF:Y6 fabricated under different conditions are provided in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI). The device parameters of the ternary devices fabricated under different conditions (additive amount, annealing temperature/time, and blend ratio) are shown in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI).

The optimized binary OSCs based on PBDB-TF:Y6 exhibited a PCE of 15.31% with a VOC of 0.849 V, a JSC of 25.26 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.36%, which is generally consistent with the results previously reported. When DTNIF was incorporated as the third component (10 wt%), the optimal ternary organic solar cell based on PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF delivered a significantly improved PCE of 16.73% with a VOC of 0.858 V, a JSC of 26.40 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.80%. By contrast, the best-performance binary OSC based on PBDB-TF:DTNIF showed a much lower PCE of 7.31% but with a higher VOC of 1.01 V. One can find that the ratio of DTNIF incorporation affected the performance of the ternary OSCs significantly (Table S4, ESI). As shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S3a (ESI), with the increasing content of DTNIF, VOC of the ternary OSCs gradually increased. It is known that VOC is mainly determined by the energy level offset between the HOMO of the donor material and the LUMO of the acceptor material. Thus, the introduction of DTNIF with a high-lying LUMO level into the PBDB-TF:Y6 binary system is beneficial for improving VOC of the resulting ternary OSCs. Using an appropriate blend ratio of DTNIF, improved values in both JSC and FF were achieved probably due to the improved active layer morphology and broadened absorption spectrum (Fig. S1 and S3b, ESI). The best ternary OSC based on the active layer with another blend ratio (1.0:1.0:0.2, w/w) also exhibited an increased PCE of 15.63% (VOC = 0.870 V, JSC = 25.18 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.41%) compared with that of the binary device. However, when the weight ratio of DTNIF increased further, the PCE of the ternary device began to decline. It can be attributed to the fact that excessive DTNIF may be unfavorable for optimal phase separation, thereby reducing the FF and JSC values, and eventually reducing the PCE of the resulting devices (Fig. 2e). To study the device repeatability of the ternary OSCs, 30 individual devices were fabricated and measured to provide the PCE distribution histograms (Fig. 2c). The PCEs of both the binary and ternary devices conform to Gaussian distributions with good repeatability and small standard derivations.
Besides, we also investigated the stability of the binary and ternary OSCs in air after simple device encapsulation. As depicted in Fig. S4a (ESI), the normalized PCE of the ternary PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF device after air exposure for 600 h can still maintain 73.1% of its initial value. Whereas, the PCE of the binary device based on PBDB-TF:Y6 can only retain 61.3% of its initial value, which suggests the improved shelf stability of the ternary device. At the same time, the ternary device also showed better photo-stability and thermal stability than the binary device (Fig. S4b and c, ESI). These results further indicate that the addition of DTNIF not only can increase the PCE of the ternary device but also can improve the device stability.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the binary and ternary OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2b. In general, the ternary device based on PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF (1.0:1.1:0.1, w/w) exhibited a slightly enhanced average EQE compared to the binary device based on PBDB-TF:Y6, which agrees with the larger JSC value for the former one. The increased EQEs in the wavelength range of 350–550 nm for the ternary device in comparison with those for the binary device could be related to the enhanced absorption of the ternary active layer with the DTNIF incorporation. However, the increased EQEs of the ternary device in the long wavelength range could be attributed to the improved morphology with the DTNIF incorporation. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra for the best-performance PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF-based, PBDB-TF:Y6-based, and PBDB-TF:DTNIF-based devices are 25.08, 24.03 and 12.19 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values in the J–V measurements within 5% errors.

To explore the influence of the third component DTNIF on the exciton dissociation probability in the devices, the saturation current density (Jsat) and charge separation probability (P(E,T)) of the binary and ternary devices were investigated. Fig. 3a shows the relationship curves of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) for the devices based on PBDB-TF:Y6, PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF, and PBDB-TF:DTNIF. Note that Jph is defined as Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under the standard light illumination and the dark, respectively.Veff is derived from V0 − Va, where V0 represents the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. The P(E,T) values for the devices based on PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF, PBDB-TF:Y6, and PBDB-TF:DTNIF are calculated as 99.9%, 98.4% and 87.9%, respectively. The improved P(E,T) value for the ternary device indicates that the incorporation of DTNIF as the third component is beneficial to promote the exciton dissociation rate, thus contributing to the larger JSC value of the ternary device.

Apart from exciton dissociation, charge recombination is another important factor that can directly affect the device performance. Therefore, we studied the dependence of both VOC and JSC on varied light intensity (Plight) of the devices to investigate the charge recombination kinetics. The relationship of JSC dependent on Plight can be described as: JSC ∝ Pαlight, where α refers to the exponential factor, which can be calculated from the slope of the log(JSC)−log(Plight) fitting curve. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, the ternary PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF-based device holds a higher α value of 0.996, while the two binary devices based on PBDB-TF:Y6 and PBDB-TF:DTNIF have lower α values of 0.986 and 0.911, respectively. The α value closer to 1 for the ternary device suggests that the incorporation of the third component (DTNIF) could weaken the bimolecular recombination in the device, thereby leading to the higher JSC and FF values of the resulting OSC. Meanwhile, the curve of VOCversus logarithm of Plight (VOC ∝ lnPlight) can be fitted to estimate the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the three devices. In general, a device dominated by bimolecular recombination has a slope close to 1 × kT/q (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge), whereas a device dominated by trap-assisted recombination has a slope close to 2 × kT/q. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF-based ternary device exhibits a slope of 1.18kT/q, which is much lower than that of the binary devices based on PBDB-TF:Y6 (1.27kT/q) and PBDB-TF:DTNIF (1.37kT/q). These results reveal that the trap-assisted charge recombination is suppressed and bimolecular charge recombination is dominant in the ternary OSC. It should be noted that the reduced trap-assisted charge recombination could be attributed to the improved molecular order as well as the closer π–π stacking distance of the ternary blend.
In order to know the impacts of the DTNIF incorporation on the charge transport of OSCs, hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities under dark conditions were further investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The device configurations for hole-only and electron-only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. By measuring the SCLC, their hole- and electron-mobilities were evaluated, and the results are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI) and Table 1. The PBDB-TF:DTNIF blend showed relatively low μh and μe of 1.62 × 10−4 and 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. For the binary blend based on PBDB-TF:Y6, the μh and μe values increased to 2.10 × 10−4 and 1.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Interestingly, when a small amount of DTNIF was added to the host PBDB-TF:Y6 blend film, the hole and electron mobilities of the resulting ternary blend were improved to 2.55 × 10−4 and 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. At the same time, the PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF ternary blend had a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.02 compared to the host PBDB-TF:Y6 blend, which has a μh/μe ratio of 1.13. The increased and more balanced charge transport is favorable for obtaining a higher FF of the PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF-based ternary device in comparison with the binary counterpart.

To achieve favorable film morphology in the active layer is an indispensable condition for high-performance OSCs. Thus, the film morphologies of the binary and ternary blends were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the ternary PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF (1:1.1:0.1, w/w) blend film exhibits a smaller surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.81 nm than that of the binary PBDB-TF:Y6 blend film (1.13 nm) and the binary PBDB-TF:DTNIF blend film (1.34 nm), indicating the excellent miscibility of DTNIF with the PBDB-TF:Y6 host blend. The phenomenon of reduced RMS roughness for the ternary blend as compared to the host blend has also been observed in other blend systems. In addition, an obvious fibril structure can be observed from the ternary blend film compared with the binary blend film (Fig. 4d–f), which is in favor of efficient exciton dissocation and charge trasportation in the corresponding OSCs.

Furthermore, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to evaluate the effect of the DTNIF incorporation on the molecular packing and crystallinity of the blend films. The GIWAXS patterns are depicted in Fig. 5 and the related parameters are summarized in Table S5 (ESI). Notably, the binary PBDB-TF:Y6 blend film displays a preferential face-on orientation, with a (100) lamellar stacking diffraction peak located at qxy = 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane direction and a (010) π–π stacking peak at qxy = 1.71 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction. Thus, the interlamellar spacing and π–π stacking distance were calculated to be 20.93 and 3.67 Å, respectively. Moreover, estimated by the Scherrer equation, the coherence lengths (CLs) for the (010) and (100) diffraction peaks are 2.29 and 5.40 nm, respectively. After the incorporation of DTNIF (10 wt%) as the third component, more pronounced diffraction peaks were observed, and the CLs of the (010) and (100) diffraction peaks increased to 2.58 and 6.96 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, a decreased π–π stacking distance of 3.61 Å was observed for the ternary blend film in comparison with the π–π stacking distance of 3.67 Å for the binary blend. These results indicate that DTNIF can act as a crystallizing agent to enhance the crystallinity of the PBDB-TF:Y6 blend and thus improve the charge transport, which has been confirmed by the SCLC measurements discussed in the previous section. The enhanced crystallinity together with the closer π–π stacking distance is beneficial for the suppressed charge recombination of the ternary blend, thereby leading to the increased JSC and FF values of the corresponding ternary devices.

Considering the high performance of the ternary devices, it is expected to develop their STOSCs with high PCEs at high AVT values, which are important for real applications. Here, a series of STOSCs with controlled thicknesses of the Ag anode were fabricated by using the optimized ternary PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF blend system. Fig. 6a and b show the J–V characteristics and transmittance spectra of the ternary STOSCs, and their detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. With an active layer thickness of 90 nm, ternary STOSCs with anode thicknesses of 20, 15, and 10 nm showed impressive PCEs of 14.50%, 13.49% and 12.14%, respectively. The related AVTs for the ternary STOSCs are 19.78%, 22.58% and 25.89%, in the same order. EQE spectra for the corresponding ternary STOSCs are also provided in Fig. S6 (ESI). It can be found that when the thickness of the Ag electrode gradually decreases, the VOC, JSC, FF and EQE values of the devices decrease, which agrees with the corresponding transmission spectra (Fig. 6b). The gradually decreasing values of VOC, JSC and FF for semitransparent OSCs with decreasing Ag electrode thickness are mainly attributed to the reduced film quality of the ultrathin Ag electrode. Because high transmittance will reduce the effective photon capture of the devices, there is a trade-off between the large transmittance and high PCE. It should be noted that the best-performance ternary STOSC in this work can achieve both a high PCE of 13.49% and a large AVT value of 22.58%. To reconfirm the accuracy of the record-high PCE, we sent an optimized device with 15 nm Ag to Fujian Metrology Institute (National PV Industry Measurement and Testing Center) in China for certification. They obtained an average PCE of 13.43% (Fig. S7, ESI). For comparison purposes, the PCEs and AVT values of several types of efficient binary and ternary STOSCs reported in recent years are shown in Fig. 6c and Table S6 (ESI). As shown in Fig. 6c, to the best of our knowledge, 13.49% represents the highest PCE reported so far for all STOSCs with AVTs over 20%, showing that the ternary PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF system is promising for high-performance STOSCs.

In addition to the efficiency and transmittance, the color perception of STOSCs is also a critical factor in practical applications. The tristimulus value (X, Y, Z) and color coordinates (x, y) on the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram were calculated from the transmission spectra to evaluate the transparency perception of these STOSCs, which is specifically intended to reflect the human visual color perception. As shown in Fig. 6d, the color coordinates of the ternary STOSCs with Ag of 20, 15, and 10 nm thicknesses are (0.263, 0.263), (0.264, 0.267), and (0.266, 0.273), respectively. It could be observed that the ternary STOSC with Ag of 10 nm thickness exhibits color coordinates closer to (0.332, 0.343) of the AM 1.5G solar spectrum because of its higher AVT. Interestingly, although the AVT of the binary PBDB-TF:Y6 semitransparent device (19.92%) is slightly higher than that of the ternary STOSC (19.78%) with 20 nm-thick Ag, the color coordinates of (0.246, 0.252) for the binary STOSC obviously deviate from the AM 1.5G solar spectrum (0.332, 0.343) compared with the ternary semitransparent device (Fig. S8a and b, ESI). In addition, a photograph was taken through the STOSC with Ag of 15 nm thickness (inset of Fig. 6d), which demonstrates the good visible light transparency of this type of ternary devices. These results suggest an effective ternary blend strategy for high-performance STOSCs with good color perception by incorporating DTNIF as a third component acceptor material.

In summary, high-performance opaque and semitransparent ternary OSCs have been successfully fabricated by incorporating the non-fullerene acceptor of DTNIF as a third component material into the binary PBDB-TF:Y6 system. Due to the higher-lying LUMO energy level of DTNIF than that of Y6, the VOC values of the ternary devices based on PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF are enhanced in comparison with those of the binary devices based on PBDB-TF:Y6. Morphological results suggest that the incorporation of DTNIF can also enhance the crystallinity and reduce the π–π stacking distance of the active layer, thereby leading to enhanced and more balanced charge transport. As a result, the best-performance ternary OSC based on PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF delivered a significantly enhanced PCE of 16.73% with simultaneously increased JSC, VOC and FF values (VOC = 0.858 V, JSC = 26.40 mA cm−2, and FF = 73.80%) in comparison with the binary device based on PBDB-TF:Y6 (PCE = 15.31%, VOC = 0.849 V, JSC = 25.26 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.36%). More importantly, an excellent PCE of 13.49% with a high AVT of 22.58% was achieved for the best-performance ternary STOSC based on PBDB-TF:Y6:DTNIF. Furthermore, the ternary STOSC showed improved color perception compared to the binary STOSC. The record high PCE of 13.49%, the improved color transparency perception, and the high AVT above 20% for the STOSCs make them promising candidates when integrated with see-through elements such as automobile windows. These results suggest an effective strategy to achieve highly efficient and stable ternary OSCs as well as their high-performance semitransparent devices by the incorporation of a suitable third component material into the traditional binary active layer.
