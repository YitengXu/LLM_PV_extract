In this contribution, a series of conducting polyfluorenes (PF) are introduced to improve interface adhesion and boost charge extraction of the TiO2 electron transport layer of inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). After employing poly (9,9-dihexylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PDF), poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)] (PDFBT), and poly[(4-(5-(7-methyl-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl) thiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PFTBT) as capping layers, interfacial coherence improvement and energy loss decrease are both achieved, facilitating charge transfer from the active layer to the TiO2 layer. The optimized contact, enhanced electrical conductivity, and reduced internal resistance contribute to increased short-circuit current density and fill factor, leading to an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5.72% up to 7.97%. The employment of the PF capping TiO2 buffer layer provides a promising approach to develop high efficiency PSCs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for application in photo-to-electron conversion due to considerable potential for the acquisition of low-cost, printable, flexible, and lightweight photovoltaic devices. Although device performance has been steadily enhanced in recent years, unbalanced charge transfer and energy loss still extensively exist, which severely affect device efficiency. Hence, further improvement via balancing charge transport and minimizing energy loss in PSCs remains imperative. Generally, energy loss directly originates from reflection, transmission, exciton recombination, and mismatching energy alignment. In order to overcome these problems, new conjugated polymers and device structures have been developed to improve the performance of PSCs. Particularly, an inverted device structure using a robust buffer layer and a high work-function metal electrode (e.g. Al, Ag, and Au) has also been developed. To maintain device stability and accelerate charge transfer, inorganic interfacial layers such as zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2), and molybdenum oxide (MoO3) have been used as the buffer layers between active layer and electrode to decrease charge carrier quenching and recombination. However, the poor contact and energy barrier at the organic/inorganic interface of polymers and metal oxides impede charge transfer, resulting in low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Furthermore, the intrinsic inorganic interfacial defects and poor surface electrical conductivity of sol–gel processed metal oxides even deteriorate electron extraction. To overcome these interface issues, the interlayer between the inorganic buffer layer and organic active layer was reengineered using different methods including conjugated polyelectrolyte, self-assemble molecule of the dipole, and neutral fullerene derivative methods. The interfacial modification utilizing highly electrical conductive polyfluorene (PF) materials to improve electron transport is rarely reported and needs to be further investigated.

In this study, an organic/inorganic composite buffer layer was explored via employing a conducting PF capping layer on the TiO2 film. The utilization of poly(9,9-dihexylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PDF), poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1′,3}-thiadiazole)] (PDFBT), and poly[(4-(5-(7-methyl-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl) thiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PFTBT) boosted electron transfer from the excited organic molecules to the electron transport layer, which dramatically improved device performance. The surface morphology and work function were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy. It was found that the PF capping layer improved interfacial adhesion between the TiO2 and active layer, and matched energy level alignment was achieved, which consequently reduced the energy loss and promoted charge transport. The results prove the effect of PF as an efficient interfacial molecular layer for PSCs.

In our study, a TiO2 electron transport layer was prepared using tetrabutyl titanate [Ti(OC4H9)4] via a sol–gel method. The procedure for the preparation included the dissolution of 10 mL of Ti(OC4H9)4 in 100 mL of C2H5OH with a purity of 99.8%, which was used as a solvent, followed by adding 10 mL CH3COOH, 10 mL of acetylacetone, and eventually 10 mL of de-ionized water. The mixture was stirred for 30 min before each reagent was incorporated at room temperature.


PCDTBT and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech Inc. and Lumitec Corp. PDF, PDFBT, and PFTBT were from Aladdin Inc, and were used without purification. First, ITO coated glass was successively cleaned using acetone, ethyl alcohol, and deionized water. The TiO2 solution was spin-coated onto pre-cleaned ITO glass at a speed of 3000 rpm for 20 s, to ensure uniformity, and then annealed for 2 h at 450 °C in a muffle furnace. The thus-prepared film was composed of anatase TiO2. The thickness of the TiO2 layer was measured using a Woollam M2000UI spectroscopic ellipsometer, and the film thickness was about 30 nm. Next, PDF, PDFBT, and PFTBT were separately dissolved in tetrahydrofuran solvent having a concentration of 1000 ppm and spin-coated on top of the TiO2 thin film at 4500 rpm, 3000 rpm, 2000 rpm and 1000 rpm, respectively, and then annealed at 80 °C for 10 min in air. Then, PCDTBT and PC71BM (1:4 by weight) were dissolved in 1, 2-dichlorobenzene and spun-coated on top of the pre-coated PF layer at 2000 rpm for 20 s to form the active layer. Finally, the 4 nm thin MoO3 buffer layer and 100 nm Ag electrode were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 10−5 Pa. The device structure is shown in Fig. 1a, as well as the molecular structure of PDFBT, PDF, and PFTBT in Fig. 1b–d, respectively.

After fabrication, the devices were illuminated at 100 mW cm−2 by a 150 W solar simulator with AM 1.5G filters (PV measurements). The illumination intensity was determined by a NREL-calibrated silicon solar cell with KG-5 colour filter. All the electrical measurements were carried out in air at room temperature. The active area of the device irradiated by light was defined as 6.4 mm2 using a photomask (2 mm × 3.2 mm); therefore, no extra current outside the defined area was collected. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with a Keithley 2601 source measurement unit. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed in air using a PV Measurements QEX7 system. The morphologies of the PF films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (Dimension Icon Scanasyst). The thicknesses of the PF layer and evaporated layers were recorded with a Woollam M2000UI Spectroscopic Ellipsometer and verified by AFM. The impedance spectrum was recorded at 1 V in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz (CHI 760) by HP Hewlett Packard 4248A.

To clarify the effect of the PF capping layer on the PSCs, the performance of the devices with three types of polymers was optimized by adjusting film thickness and interface morphology, and the detailed photovoltaic properties of the devices were investigated. Corresponding J–V characteristics of all the optimal cells are shown in Fig. 2a, and the data of PDFBT based device were the optimal results which were selected from four values of thickness as well as the choice of PDF and PFTBT. The detailed photovoltaic data of all the devices are summarized in Table 1, and all values are typical averages of 40 devices. It can be seen that the control device prepared from the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend with TiO2 buffer layer exhibits a relatively ordinary performance including a Jsc of 12.73 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.855 V, and an FF of 52.52%, leading to a PCE of 5.72%. After incorporating a PFTBT capping layer on the TiO2 film, Jsc and FF increased to 13.46 mA cm−2 and 57.24%, respectively, yielding an enhanced PCE of 6.66%. Similarly, the performance of the optimal device with a PDF layer also increased, which included a Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 and an advanced FF of 55.52%, resulting in a PCE of 6.72%. Encouragingly, the PDFBT based device indicated a noticeable PCE enhancement up to 7.97% because of the greatly increased Jsc of 14.53 mA cm−2 and improved FF of 61.88%. Compared to the control devices, the values of Voc for the optimized devices had only a little variation. It is well known that the Voc of PSCs mainly relies on the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of electron donating polymers and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of electron accepting fullerene derivatives, as well as the work function of the two electrodes, which is independent of device structure, buffer layer, and internal morphology. Thus, the incorporation of the PF layer in PSCs had little influence on the values of Voc. To deeply explore the operating mechanism of the PF on device performance, the dark J–V properties of all devices were tested and are shown in Fig. 2b. The PSCs with the PF interfacial capping layer possessed smaller leakage current at negative voltage and low positive bias, which significantly passivated the interface and decreased charge recombination, leading to an increase in the diode rectifying ratio for PSCs. In addition, the dark current in the forward bias region rapidly rose, revealing an increased charge transport. Enhanced dark J–V characteristics reflected the increased extraction of charge carriers from photoactive layers to TiO2 layer, and thereby enhanced device performance. Moreover, J–V characteristics of the process devices are displayed in Fig. 3, the complete parameter comparison of control and optimized devices including Voc, FF, Jsc, and PCE are displayed in Fig. 4, and the optimized devices achieved comprehensive advantages. In order to further investigate Jsc improvement, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement of the control and optimized PSCs was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. For the devices with PFTBT, PDF, and PDFBT capping layers, IPCE increased over a broad wavelength range from 350 to 650 nm; the maximum IPCE values for these devices are 64%, 67%, and 72%, respectively, which are in accord with the photocurrent results. For polymer solar cells, the photocurrent enhancement is usually ascribed to improved light trapping. To verify the PF layer effect on light harvesting, the absorption spectra of the completed devices with TiO2 and TiO2/PF layers were observed and are shown in Fig. 5b. After the TiO2 buffer layers were modified by the PF capping layer, a substantial enhancement of absorption in the range of 350 to 700 nm was observed for the TiO2/PF based devices (with the same active layer thickness of 100 nm). Particularly, we observed a pronounced increase in the region of 350–500 nm, which may be ascribed to optical interference and/or decreased interface-optical-losses.

To deeply understand the effect of the PF layers on exciton generation and dissociation, Fig. 5c reveals the influence of PF layer on photocurrent density (Jph) – effective voltage (Veff). Herein,
Jph = JL − JD
(1)
Veff = V0 − Vapp
(2)
where
JL and JD are the current density under illumination and in dark, V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Vapp is the applied bias voltage.Fig. 5c clearly displays that Jph linearly increases in the low Veff range and saturates at high Veff. Ideally, all the photogenerated excitons could dissociate into free electrons and holes, and the separated charge carriers were totally collected by electrodes in the high Veff region. Hence, the saturation current density (Jsat) was only limited by the absorbed incident photons. The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) can be obtained from eqn (3) below,

Jph = eGmaxL
(3)
where
e is the electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 C) and L is the thickness of the active layer film (100 nm). The calculated Gmax of the control device was 7.87 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 12.596 mA cm−2), while the optimized devices with PF layers exhibited a Gmax of 9.375 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 15.0 mA cm−2) for the PDFBT device, 8.83 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 14.133 mA cm−2) for the PDF device, and 8.75 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 13.999 mA cm−2) for the PFTBT device, respectively. As a result, an increased Gmax was achieved after the PF films were incorporated, indicating that the enhanced charge extraction was beneficial for exciton dissociating into free charge carriers.

To directly unravel the role of the interfacial layers on exciton dissociation and charge transport, a Kelvin probe system (KP 6500 Digital Kelvin probe, McAllister Technical Services Co., Ltd) was used to measure absolute values of vacuum work function of the PF thin films, and the Au film with a work function of 5.1 eV was selected to be a criterion. As presented in Fig. 6, the work functions are 3.8 eV for PDF, 4.2 eV for PDFBT, and 4.3 eV for PFTBT, which can form a gradient with that of TiOx (4.6 eV). Particularly, the work function of PDFBT appropriately matches with the LUMO of TiO2 and PCBM, which distinctly decreases built-in potential and minimizes contact resistance. Consequently, the work function modulation facilitates interface energy barrier decrease and interface passivation, resulting in the improved charge transport from the active layer to the TiO2 layer (Fig. 6b and c).
To probe the influence of the PF capping layer on surface topography, the surface morphology of the TiO2/PF films was investigated. Fig. 7 presents the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the pristine TiO2, TiO2/PDF, TiO2/PDFBT, and TiO2/PFTBT films. The corresponding root mean square (RMS) of 0.36 nm was obtained for TiO2 layer (Fig. 7a), and RMS of TiO2/PDF (Fig. 7b), TiO2/PDFBT (Fig. 7c), and TiO2/PFTBT (Fig. 7d) films was 3.21 nm, 4.12 nm, and 2.65 nm, respectively. The enlarged RMS provided effective interface contact and interfacial adhesion between the TiO2 and active layers, and also improved charge transfer at the active layer interface, and thus a higher photocurrent and PCE could be observed.
Surface wettability affects the way in which the subsequently deposited organic solution assembles on the interface of another material, and this can change the density of the interfacial trap and recombination center as well as the active sites for electron transport. Therefore, the water contact angles of different substrates were measured using a Contact Angle Tester. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the bare TiO2 substrate shows a water contact angle of 34.07° (Fig. 8a), while the PF-modified TiO2 shows an increased water contact angle of 103.54° (PDF), 107.47° (PDFBT), and 105.23° (PFTBT). Importantly, the PF layer, which is oil-soluble, will increase the hydrophobic capacity compared to the TiO2 film, which has an alcohol-soluble character, resulting in a improved contact with the active layer. Hence, the hydrophobic surface induced by PF modification is more compatible with the hydrophobic active layer solution than the hydrophilic TiO2, which is helpful in forming a homogeneous topographical surface.
It is worth noting that parasite resistance is an unavoidable factor for practical solar cells. Series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are introduced into the equivalent model to account for energy losses. Usually, Rs stems from the bulk resistance and the contact resistance of the active layer and electrodes. Rsh derives from the current leakage induced by the pinhole and the edge of the device. Taking the parasite resistances into consideration, the equivalent circuit equation for the J–V characteristic can be expressed by eqn (4):
(4)
and the dark
J–V characteristic with the Shockley diode is modeled as eqn (5):

(5)
where
q is the electron charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, Js is the reverse saturation current density, and n is the ideal factor. To further understand the origin of the increased Jsc, the relevant diode parameters including Rs and Rsh of the devices without and with PF capping layers were estimated from the slopes of the J–V curves of PSCs and are summarized in Table 1. The improved dark current characteristic indicated a larger Rsh and a decrease of Rs or contact resistance. Reduced internal resistance could prevent the current from leaking and reduce the bimolecular recombination, resulting in the increase of Jsc and FF. The impedance spectra were also measured to further reveal the internal resistance of the inverted PSCs without and with PF capping layer. The Nyquist curves of the impedance for the inverted PSCs were measured under open-circuit voltage conditions in air with a frequency from 20 Hz to 1 MHz using a HP Hewlett Packard 4248A. The imaginary part and real part in the Figure mapping, occurring as a semicircle in the coordinate axes, is related with the omega. The data of the center coordinates of the circle formulate (x = R1 + Rr/2, y = 0), and R1, Rr and Cμ can be given by the following equations:

(6)
OA = Rs = R1
(7)
AC = Rrec
(8)
Cμ = 1/ωBR
(9)
i0 = RT/nFRrec
(10)
The capacitance
Cμ is attributed to the depletion region chemical capacitance due to connecting to the carrier storage. The Rs was introduced as Rs = R1 + R0. In the simplified circuit diagram for the actual blending system of PSCs, Rs = R1, which can be obtained from the simplified model. Efficient interfacial modification usually leads to decreased Rs (Fig. 9a); Rs values of the PF-based devices distinctly decrease from 1011 Ω (control device) to 701 Ω (PDF), 352 Ω (PDFBT), and 918 Ω (PFTBT), respectively. The decreased contact resistance reduces energy potential and accelerates charge transport within PSCs, leading to a Jsc enhancement.

To confirm the reduced internal resistance and enhanced electrical conductivity of PSCs, the J–V characteristic of the diodes with the structures of ITO/TiO2/Ag and ITO/TiO2/PF/Ag were investigated. As shown in Fig. 9b, the different slopes of J–V curves present different electrical conductivities of TiO2 and TiO2/PF films. The electrical conductivity is calculated by the following equation:
(11)
where
σ is the electrical conductivity, G is the conductance, which can be derived from the slope of the J–V curve, d is the thickness of the thin film, and A is the device area. The thicknesses of TiO2, TiO2/PDF, TiO2/PDFBT, and TiO2/PFTBT were 30, 35, 36, and 35 nm, respectively, which are as same as those used in the optimized devices; the calculated electrical conductivities were 4.73 × 10−4 S m−1, 6.6 × 10−4 S m−1, 6.7 × 10−4 S m−1, and 5.5 × 10−4 S m−1, respectively. These results proved that the PF capping layer can enhance electrical conductivity of the cathode buffer layer and facilitate charge transport through the TiO2/PF layer to the TiO2 layer and are in good agreement with impedance spectra.

Furthermore, charge carrier mobility plays an important role on charge collection of electrodes; electron-only devices were fabricated, and the charge carrier mobilities were also investigated. The configuration of electron-only devices is ITO/TiO2/PF/PCDTBT:PC71BM/BCP/Ag, where the BCP was used as a hole-blocking layer. The dark J–V characteristics of single-electron devices were measured and fitted using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model and the Mott-Gurney law that included field-dependent mobility. Fig. 9c shows the J–V characteristics of the electron-only device measured at a driving voltage range of 0–8 V. The results indicated that the Jsc values of all the doped devices were larger than that of the control device, and they were well in agreement with the photocurrent results. Therefore, the devices with PF capping layers possessed better capacity for electron transport. In order to make a realistic evaluation of the enhancement of charge transfer, the electron mobilities were calculated. At a typical applied voltage of 1.0 V, corresponding to an electric field of 105 V cm−1 across the bulk of a 100 nm active layer, the apparent electron mobilities increased from 5.54 × 10−5 to 1.07 × 10−4, 1.41 × 10−4, and 1.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. After incorporating the PF capping layers, the electron mobilities were remarkably enhanced. Larger carrier mobilities mean that electrons are transported to the electrode more quickly, which reduces current losses via recombination. The introduction of PF capping layer provides an effective interface for electron transfer, which enables the formation of percolation pathways for electron transport, thus reducing the effects of space charge formation and mitigating charge recombination.
In conclusion, a series of conducting PF capping layers were employed to improve the performance of inverted PSCs, and the device efficiency was increased from 5.72% to 7.97%. The utilization of the PF capping layer can apparently improve the energy level alignment and increase roughness of the TiO2 surface, which provide effective interface contact and interfacial adhesion between the TiO2 and active layers. The facilitated charge transport and minimized contact resistance reduced the energy barrier, resulting in a higher photocurrent. This study paves a facile way to enhance device performance of inverted PSCs.
