Three new ferrocenyl oxadiazoles, viz. (E)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(2-ferrocenyl-ethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (D2), (E)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2-ferrocenyl-ethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (D3) and (E)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-[5-(2-ferroceneylethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole (D4) derived from (E)-3-ferrocenylacrylic acid (D1) having phenolic or nitro anchors, have been synthesized and characterized using microanalyses and relevant spectroscopic techniques. UV-Vis spectroscopic studies indicate that with respect to ferrocene, the electronic absorption bands of the new compounds are bathochromically shifted up to 600 nm with a concomitant enhancement in their intensities. All four compounds have been used as photosensitizers in TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The photovoltaic performances and charge transport properties (EIS spectra) of these compounds were studied to appraise their dye performance. All four compounds displayed good photovoltaic performances. However, compounds D2 and D4 displayed superior performance, which might be due to the better electronic communication between the ferrocenyl moiety and the six membered aromatic ring with their –OH/NO2 anchors having five membered oxadiazole spacers, as well as the high dye loading of these compounds on the TiO2 surface, which suppresses charge recombination, prolongs electron lifetime, and decreases the total resistance of DSSCs. The assembly fabricated using D4 performed better with an overall conversion efficiency η of 4.70%, Jsc of 10.33 mA cm−2 and Voc of −0.712 V.

During the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been attracting enormous attention from the scientific community as they offer an edge over the conventional photovoltaic devices because they are light weight, colored and flexible and have established power conversion efficiencies of 11.4% to 14.3%. The key components in DSSCs are sensitizers, which play a crucial role in DSSCs as they control the light harvesting and charge separation properties. In addition, the structure of sensitizers can be modified to enhance the molar extinction coefficient as well as the solar light harvesting capacity. This objective can be accomplished through modifications in the chromophore and anchoring groups, which can therefore improve the photocurrent and efficiency of DSSCs. Several metal based sensitizers, viz. Ru-based dyes, Zn porphyrins and pervoskites, have shown remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, their high cost, especially the Ru-based dyes, limits their practical implementation.

To resolve this issue, several organic dyes possessing versatile structures have been employed as sensitizers in DSSCs. Organic dyes composed of triphenylamine (TPA) donors and different π-conjugated linkers such as aromatic and heteroaromatic moieties with cyanoacrylic acid as an anchoring/acceptor group were best suited to enhance the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs.
In recent years, we have been continuously working to develop ferrocene and its derivatives as possible photo-sensitizers that can be used in DSSCs. In our pursuit to develop potential ferrocene based sensitizers, we have reported the light harvesting properties of the homo- and heteroleptic complexes of ferrocenyl dithiocarbamates and their organomercury(II) derivatives. We also worked on ferrocene dithiocarbamate and dithiocarbonate as anchors in DSSCs. In addition to these sulphur derivatives, π-conjugated derivatives of ferrocene and biferrocene with different anchors have been reported by our group. Recently, we deployed 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene appended Ni(II) dithiolates as sensitizers but they displayed modest photovoltaic efficiencies due to an unfavourable charge transfer direction. Mishra et al. reported ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine based donor–acceptor dyes for dye sensitized solar cells. Sirbu et al. found that DSSCs fabricated using a trisubstituted ferrocene-based porphyrin derivative with a Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte resulted in only modest conversion efficiency. Cariello and co-workers designed some ferrocenyl based dyes and investigated the effect of π-conjugation on the conversion efficiency. The choice of using ferrocene derivatives as sensitizers is down to the well-defined reversible one-electron redox process and electron donating properties. The formal reduction potential of the ferrocenyl group depends on the nature of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring. The redox potential can be tuned to obtain the desired potential for a specific application.
In continuation of our development program for photosensitizers composed of ferrocene, we found that oxadiazole derivatives that exist in four regioisomeric forms (two 1,2,4-isomers, if asymmetrically substituted, a 1,3,4-isomer, and a 1,2,5-isomer) can be used as luminescent materials as well as sensitizers in DSSCs. Their electron withdrawing effects have been utilized to develop charge-transfer species. In addition to common oxadiazoles connected with aromatic rings, ferrocenyl derivatives of oxadiazoles have been reported. These ferrocenyl oxadiazoles have been investigated for DNA binding assay and antimicrobial activity. Although the biological properties associated with ferrocenyl based oxadiazoles are reported, to the best of our knowledge, the applications of ferrocenyl oxadiazoles as sensitizers in DSSCs have not been reported. In the expedition of new ferrocene based sensitizers, we have synthesized three new ferrocenylethynyl-substituted oxadiazoles and tested their ability as sensitizers in DSSCs. The results of these investigations are presented herein.

The ferrocenecarboxaldehyde was condensed with malonic acid in refluxing pyridine/piperidine following the Knoevenagel–Doebner reaction procedure to produce (E)-3-ferrecenylacrylic acid (D1) in moderate yield (Scheme 1). The condensation of (E)-3-ferrecenylacrylic acid with aromatic acid hydrazides yielded the desired ferrocenyl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, viz. (E)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(2-ferrocenyl-ethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (D2) and (E)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2-ferrocenyl-ethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (D3) (Scheme 1). In order to obtain (E)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-[5-(2-ferroceneylethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole (D4), the hydrazide was prepared using a three step process, starting with the synthesis of amidoxime by treating 4-nitro benzene nitrile with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and aqueous sodium hydroxide ethanol at room temperature for 15 h. Thereafter, amidoxime was condensed with ethyl oxalyl chloride, employing DIPEA as a base, in tetrahydrofuran at 0 °C and the reaction mixture was refluxed for ∼2 h, giving the corresponding 1,2,4-oxadiazole. Hydrazinolysis of the ester in ethanol by the action of aqueous hydrazine at room temperature for 1 h yielded 3-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole-5-carbohydrazide. The obtained final product was condensed with (E)-3-ferrecenylacrylic acid similar to 2 and 3 to get (E)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-[5-(2-ferroceneylethen-1-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole (4) (Scheme 2).


The sensitizers were characterized via FTIR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as high resolution mass spectrometry. The purity and composition of all sensitizers were assessed via1H NMR spectroscopy, which displayed well resolved signals that integrated well into the corresponding hydrogens (vide infra). In the 13C NMR spectra for dyes D2–D4, the resonances lying in the region ∼δ 140–165 ppm correspond to the oxadiazole ring. The IR spectra of the four dyes show bands arising at ∼3070 cm−1, which can be assigned to νC–H. Dye D1 displays a band near 1668 cm−1, which corresponds to νCOOH. In D2, the band at 3490 cm−1 can be ascribed to νOH. The bands arising at 1610 (D1), 1604 (D2), 1631 (D3) and 1641 cm−1 (D4) are because of νCC. In D3 and D4, bands at 1519 and 1523 cm−1 correspond to ν(NO2)asymm. for D3 and D4, respectively, while bands appearing at 1338 and 1350 cm−1 can be attributed to ν(NO2)symm. for D3 and D4, respectively. Also, in all the dyes, bands at ∼1450–1490 cm−1 and ∼1260 cm−1 correspond to the presence of the oxadiazole ring. In addition, the band at ∼490 cm−1 may arise because of the stretching vibration from the Fe-Cp ring.

The perspective view of dyes D1 and D4 is presented in Fig. 1. The X-ray structures for both the sensitizers indicate that the exo-cyclic double bond lying in the vicinity of the ferrocenyl moiety acquires an E configuration. In the case of D1, the dihedral angle between the plane formed by five membered Cp rings and the olefinic carbon center is 3.38°. In the case of D4, two oxadiazole rings are exactly planar while the dihedral angle between the 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring and the six membered ring is 1.93°. The dihedral angle between the Cp ring and 1,3,4-oxadiazole unit is 6.13°. This indicates that D4 is a highly planar molecule and can offer excellent electronic communication between ferrocenyl and nitro-aromatic entities. Further, the composition of these sensitizers has been confirmed with the aid of HRMS experiments (vide infra).
The electronic absorption spectra for the sensitizers were recorded in dichloromethane solution (Fig. 2), and they display absorption maxima in the visible region ranging between 470 and 500 nm. This band arises due to the d → d transition (assigned to 1E1g ←1A1g). In comparison to D1, which is the base unit of the sensitizers, the band is red shifted in dyes D2, D3 and D4. The bathochromic shifting may be accredited to extensive conjugation between the ferrocenyl moiety and the six membered aromatic ring with anchoring groups via the olefinic moiety and the oxadiazole linkage. This leads to a strong electronic communication between ferrocene and the aromatic fragment to which the anchors are attached. This spectral feature prompted us to deploy these molecules as potential sensitizers in DSSCs.
The electronic absorption spectra of the dyes recorded on a TiO2 film (Fig. 3) show slight broadening in the maxima range with minor bathochromic shifts that may arise because of aggregation of the dyes or electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. Also, the IR spectra of the dyes after adsorption on the TiO2 film displayed perceptible shifting of ν(CO)asymm. from 1668 cm−1 to ∼ 1637 cm−1 in D1. In D2, the band at 3490 cm−1 corresponding to νOH disappeared and a new band ascends at ∼3392 cm−1. Slight shifting of ν(NO2)asymm. from 1519 cm−1 to 1502 cm−1 and ν(NO2)symm. from 1338 cm−1 to 1314 cm−1 in the case of D3 and shifting of ν(NO2)asymm. from 1523 cm−1 to 1506 cm−1 and ν(NO2)symm. from 1350 cm−1 to 1320 cm−1 in the case of D4 have been observed. These results indicate binding of dyes by –COOH, –OH and –NO2 groups, respectively, on the TiO2 film.

To assess whether electrons can be injected by dyes D1–D4 in the conduction band of the TiO2 nanoparticulate, we have performed density of states (DOS) calculations on (TiO2)30, dyes D1–D4 and dye + (TiO2)30 systems. The results of these calculations are presented in Fig. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 reveals that in comparison to the DOS of the (TiO2)30 cluster, the DOS of the dyes shows clearly localized states, which are all occupied (Fig. 4). In the case of dye + (TiO2)30, the DOS plot clearly indicates the core states, valence band (VB), and conduction band (CB). The fundamental valence band in (TiO2)30 is located at the energy levels roughly between −10.0 eV and −8.2 eV, and the conduction band is located starting from −4.6 eV. The DOS plot for the (TiO2)30 cluster displayed a clear separation between the VB and the CB without any gap states (Fig. 4). The adsorption of the dyes onto the nanoparticle surface introduces occupied states at the lower part of the nanoparticle band gap, extending the valence states from around −8.2 eV to −5.6, −5.3, −5.5 and −5.5 eV for D1@(TiO2)30, D2@(TiO2)30, D3@(TiO2)30 and D4@(TiO2)30, respectively (Fig. 5). Based on the DOS plots (Fig. 5), it can be inferred that lower energy electrons are excited from VB energy levels approximately between −8.2 and −5.6 to −5.3 eV for dye@(TiO2)30 and then transferred to CB states above −4.6 eV. Based on the DOS plot, the minimum inter-band excitation energy lies in the range of 0.7–1.0 eV for the dye@(TiO2)30 systems. The results of the DOS indicate significant electronic coupling between the LUMO of the dyes and the CB of TiO2, which facilitates the electron injection from photo-excited dyes into the conduction band of the TiO2 nanoparticle.


Upon further evaluation of the thermodynamic feasibility of dye regeneration and electron transfer from the photo-excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, the position of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels has been estimated electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 6). From cyclic voltammetry, it was inferred that dyes D1–D4 were highly active towards photoredox processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in a three-electrode cell on an electrochemical workstation using a Pt disc as a working electrode and Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) as a reference electrode in dichloromethane containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate. The electrochemical parameters for the dyes are summarized in Table 1.

From Table 1, it is apparent that the excited-states of the dyes are sufficiently negative (−2.16 to −1.96 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in ACN) as compared to the conduction band edge of TiO2 (–0.75 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in ACN), which ensures an energetically favourable electron injection from the photo-excited dye to TiO2 and that the ground states of the dyes are more positive (+0.545 to +0.460 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile), which suggests a thermodynamically sufficient driving force for the regeneration of the dyes (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the energy level diagram (Fig. 7) for the four dyes shows a favourable excited-state oxidation potential with respect to the TiO2 conduction band. This would ensure better electron transfer, electron collection, which results in higher photocurrent, and better cell efficiency while a favourable ground-state reduction potential ensures the dye regeneration capability.

To study the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs fabricated with the D1–D4 dyes, the J–V curves were recorded (Fig. 8). The DSSC parameters such as Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), η and the maximum values of IPCE are summarized in Table 2. The highest cell efficiency η (4.7%) was found in the case of the D4 dye, although the incorporation of two oxadiazole units serving as π-bridging groups in D4 caused a slight decrease in Voc (0.712 V) as compared to D3 composed of only one oxadiazole unit (Voc of 0.736 V). Jsc was observed to increase significantly from 7.85 to 10.33 mA cm−2 going from D3 to D4 upon incorporation of an additional oxadiazole unit leading to a higher efficiency in D4 probably resulting from better electron separation. Dye D2 shows the second highest efficiency among all dyes due to the –OH group, which offers better anchorage on the TiO2 surface, thereby leading to a maximum photon absorption for current conversion (Table 2).

Fig. 9 presents the IPCE spectra of the DSSCs photosensitized by dyes D1–D4, which were recorded in the region of 400–700 nm. The results of the IPCE measurements are consistent with the results of the current–potential curves. A close resemblance was observed between the electronic absorption spectra of the dyes and their respective IPCE spectra, except for a minor red shift of ca. 3–4 nm. This confirms the sensitization of the photocurrent by the dyes. The strong blue light absorption by the I−/I3− redox couples present in the electrolyte has been considered to decrease the IPCE value in the shorter wavelength region, resulting in the slight red shift in the bands in the IPCE spectrum. The DSSC assembly with dye D4 showed a maximum IPCE value of 58% at 500 nm. The trend of IPCE maxima in decreasing order is D4 > D2 > D3 > D1, which is in good agreement with the photocurrent of the respective dyes.
Previously, in our quest for the synthesis of ferrocene based dyes to be used as sensitizers in DSSCs, we have synthesized ferrocenyl dithiolate complexes with no specific anchoring groups. These dyes acted as photosensitizers through remote sensing or physical adsorption on the TiO2 surface and have a spectral response in the range of 400–440 nm. Our recent investigation using phenylmercury(II) methylferrocenyldithiocarbamates with –OH linkers showed enhanced photovoltaic performance. To overcome the anchoring problem, we designed π-extended ferrocenes with a variety of anchoring groups, which provided better anchorage than the previous dyes and gave better results, which enabled us to enhance the spectral response in the visible region beyond 450 nm. With the ferrocenyl oxadiazoles reported herein we succeeded in extending the spectral response into the visible region up to 600 nm. The presented results are encouraging and clearly indicate that the photovoltaic parameters of ferrocenyl oxadiazoles as photosensitizers are akin to the state-of-the-art N719 dye and these ferrocenyl oxadiazole dyes with some fine tuning may become promising candidates for the realization of DSSC assembly with good-cell performance.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful analytical tool to investigate the electron transport properties at DSSC interfaces and their correlation with the performance at their open circuit potential (OCP) over a frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz under 1.5 AM. There are different processes that occur in the cell under illumination: the transfer of electrons from dyes to the conduction band of TiO2, transportation of electrons through the TiO2 system and their reaction with I3−. At the same time, I− is oxidized to I3− (dye regeneration) at the counter electrode. The Nyquist and Bode plots for the dye (D1–D4) sensitized cells are shown in Fig. 10a and b, respectively. The presence of two semicircles in the Nyquist plots can be attributed to charge transfer reactions at interfaces as the appearance of the first smaller semicircle is ascribed to charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The second larger semicircle in the middle frequency region stands for the charge transfer processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface at the bias applied voltage. The semicircle diameter for the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface decreases as the charge transfer resistance decreases upon illumination of the cell.

The decreasing trend in charge transport resistance in the middle frequency region is D4 > D2 > D3 > D1, which follows the same trend as the photocurrent results obtained from the ferrocene oxadiazole based DSSCs. The decreasing trend of recombination rates is D1 > D3 > D2 > D4, which supports the higher Voc values for D2, D3 and D4. The Bode phase plots (Fig. 10b) have been obtained to determine the effective lifetime (teff), which explains further the higher Voc values of the dyes by electron lifetime. The value of the frequency for dyes D1, D2, D3 and D4 is 47.32, 32.65, 39.23 and 23.06 Hz, respectively, with effective life times of 3.36, 4.87, 4.05 and 6.90 ms, respectively. These results have been obtained using the following equation
teff = 1/2πf
where the frequency (
f) corresponds to the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak in the Bode phase plot. The lowest electron lifetime in the case of D1 in comparison to the other dyes could explain the lowest Voc value for the D1 sensitized cell. The highest performance of the D4 based cell is due to the presence of two oxadiazole spacer units as π-linkers, which provides better electronic communication to inject electrons efficiently into the conduction band of TiO2 as well as the lowest electron transport resistance value, which acts as a driving force for the highest Jsc and Voc values for D4.


Intensity modulation photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity modulation photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) studies of DSSCs are important to determine the electron lifetime (τn) and electron transit time (τd). The parameters τn and τd are important as they imply the recombination lifetime of electrons in the electrolyte and transport lifetime of the photo-generated electrons within the photoanode film. Fig. 11 displays the results of IMVS and IMPS investigations for D1–D4 based cells. The IMVS study indicates that the back reaction between the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and I3− in the electrolyte is mainly responsible for charge recombination in DSSCs thereby resulting in a decline in electron lifetime as well as poor device performance. The IMVS and IMPS results show a lower electron lifetime (τn) and higher transport time for the D1 based cell in comparison to the rest of the three dyes with the oxadiazole spacers. These results are in agreement with the results of EIS measurements. This probably happens due to the strong aggregation of the D1 dye on the TiO2 surface owing to its large dipole moment. The cells based on dyes D2, D3 and D4 show lower recombination than the D1 based cell. The reason is that these dyes possess auxiliary acceptor units (oxadiazole units) in the D–π–A skeleton, which are responsible for improved electron lifetimes in the devices. This leads to the enhanced charge separation and electron injection from the dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. Amongst the three ferrocenyl oxadiazole based dyes, the D4 based assembly shows the highest photocurrent and cell efficiency as it contains two oxadiazole spacer units that result in efficient charge separation and lower recombination rates. Therefore, the cell performance can be enhanced by introducing suitable linkers and π acceptor groups that facilitate the lowering of the energy barrier and recombination rates, which thereby stimulate superior electron transport as well as high charge collection efficiency.


The presented investigation shows that ferrocenyl oxadiazole dyes with phenolic and nitro anchoring groups can be utilized as donor type sensitizers. By using these dyes, the spectral response of a wide band gap TiO2 electrode can be extended well into the visible region (up to 600 nm wavelength). The photo-action spectra for the DSSCs fabricated using these compounds provide strong evidence for their sensitization effect on the TiO2 photoanode. We have succeeded in achieving a maximum of ∼61% of cell efficiency compared to the N719 dye using these ferrocenyl oxadiazole dyes. Looking into the techno-economic aspects of these ferrocene oxadiazole based dyes, they could be a serious alternative for the N719 dye. We have also shown that incorporation of an extra oxadiazole spacer between the six membered aromatic ring with the anchoring group and the ferrocenyl moiety improved the electronic communication operating from the ferrocenyl fragment to the six membered aromatic ring, which in turn improved the photovoltaic parameters of the device. Broadening and enhancement in the spectral response into the visible region, down to a suitable anchoring group and electron communication properties associated with the ferrocenyl oxadiazole systems, make them an attractive candidate for enhancing the cell efficiency in DSSCs.


All chemicals and reagents were commercially available and used without further purification. Ferrocene carboxaldehyde, malonic acid, TBTU, 4-hydroxybenzhydrazide, 4-nitrobenzhydrazide, 4-nitrobenzonitrile, N,N′-diisopropylethylamine, ethyl oxalyl chloride, and hydrazine hydrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich while the remaining chemicals were purchased from TCI chemicals.


Elemental analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer 240 C, H, N analyzer. Infrared spectra were recorded using KBr pellets on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER Avance III FTNMR spectrophotometer. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million using TMS as an internal standard. The electronic absorption spectra in dichloromethane solution were recorded using a SPECORD 210 PLUS BU UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemistry was carried out using a Pt working electrode, a Pt rod counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a working electrode. All electrochemical experiments were carried out in dichloromethane. In all cases, TBAP (0.1 M) was used as a supporting electrolyte. After each experiment, the reference electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple, which was found to be at 0.55 V. The photoelectrochemical performance, including the short-circuit current (Jsc, mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (Voc, V), fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η), was determined from the J–V curve obtained by using a digital Keithley 236 mm under irradiation of white light from a 1000 W/HS Xenon arc lamp with a 100 mW cm−2 light intensity of 1.5 AM. The maximum output power (Pmax) was obtained by choosing a point on the J–V curve corresponding to which the product of current (Jmax) and voltage (Vmax) is maximum. The power conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF) were evaluated using the following relations:
Here,
Jsc, Voc and Iinc are short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit potential and intensity of incident light, respectively.

To avoid spurious light reflections and refractions, a black mask was used for the cell on the illuminated side and also used to cover the side area of the cell, which largely contributed to the cell response and led to erroneous interpretation. The reproducibility and reliability of the results were confirmed by creating three cells of each sensitized photoanode and keeping all structural and photovoltaic characterization identical. The active area of the cells was 0.25 cm2.
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by using a 300 W Xe lamp light source joined to a monochromator (Oriel). A reference Si photodiode calibrated for a spectral response was used for the monochromatic power-density calibration. From the values of Jsc and the intensity of the corresponding monochromatic light (Iinc), the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated at each excitation wavelength (λ) using the following relation:
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CH 660C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a two electrode configuration. The photoanode was used as a working electrode and the Pt electrode was used as a counter electrode. The electron transport properties were investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a 10 mV alternative signal in the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz. Electron transport time and electron lifetimes were measured by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) with the same electrochemical workstation (CH 660C electrochemical analyzer). The electrochemical workstation is equipped with a red LED source (635 nm), which is used as a light source for the above studies. The photovoltage response of the cells was studied in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 kHz. The cell was illuminated with sinusoidal modulated light containing 10% of the DC component. IMPS and IMVS were performed at different bias light intensities.

The TiO2 photoanodes were prepared using a highly transparent TiO2 paste (Titanium-HT, Dyesol) by spreading on a conducting glass plate (15 Ω cm−2, Pilkington, USA) by using a doctor's blade technique. The prepared thin films were annealed at 450 °C for half an hour in air with the heating rate of 4 °C min−1. The dyes were adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface by immersing the TiO2 photoanode in dichloromethane solutions of the dyes for 12 h. Thereafter, un-adsorbed dye was washed out using dichloromethane and then anhydrous ethanol. A platinum counter electrode was prepared by the deposition of Pt catalyst PT1 paste (purchased from Dyesol) on another conducting glass and annealing at 400 °C for half an hour in air with a heating rate of 4 °C min−1.


The sandwich type DSSCs were assembled by placing the platinum catalyst-coated counter electrode on the dye coated TiO2 film in a face to face manner and then the assembly was sealed on three sides by using spacer SX1170-60, 50 μm (Solaronix) and leaving one side open for the injection of electrolyte solution. The iodide electrolyte solution (the electrolyte was composed of 0.05 m iodine, 0.5 m LiI, and 0.5 m 4-tert-butypyridine in acetonitrile) was placed at the edges of the plates. The liquid was drawn into the space between the electrodes by capillary action. After filling the electrolyte, the open side of the cell assembly was sealed with the help of araldite and the contacts were made using copper wire and silver paste followed by araldite for sealing the contacts.


Compound (E)-3-ferrocenylacrylic acid (D1) was prepared in accordance with the previously reported procedure. Ferrocene carboxyaldehyde (0.512 g, 2 mmol) and malonic acid (0.311 g, 2.99 mmol) were added and dissolved in 2 mL of freshly distilled pyridine followed by addition of 1–2 drops of piperidine. The resulting solution was refluxed at 108 °C with stirring for 6 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere during which the evolution of CO2 stopped. The obtained reaction mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature followed by washing with 2 N HCl and thereafter extracted with 5% NaOH 3–4 times. The sodium hydroxide extracts were combined and acidified with 6 N HCl. A brick-red precipitate was formed upon complete acidification, which was collected by filtration and washed with distilled water thoroughly to remove traces of acid, and finally the residue was dried under vacuum.

Intensity data for D1 were collected at 150(2) K on a Rigaku Xcalibur, EosS2 single crystal diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). For D4, a Rigaku Supernova Dual, EosS2 system was used with monochromated Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). Unit cell determination, data collection and data reduction were performed using the CrysAlisPro software. An empirical absorption correction using spherical harmonics was employed. The structures were solved using SHELXT and refined by a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 (SHELXL-2018/3). All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were placed onto calculated positions and refined using a riding model.

Note: the entire molecule is disordered over two sites in the ratio of 1:1. Due to the proximity of the two parts that overlap in most cases, ADP restraints had to be applied for all atoms and geometric constraints for the C-ring atoms. The crystal did not diffract well at high angles, which leads to weak high angle data, which explains the high R-value. In addition, the structure was refined as a 2-component twin 180.0° rotation along the 6. 0. −1 reciprocal lattice direction.

In order to ascertain the nature of electronic transition in ferrocenyl oxadiazole, compound density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. Optimized molecular geometries were calculated using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional. The MDF10 basis set for Fe and the 6-31G** basis set for other atoms were used for geometry optimization. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programme. The TiO2 cluster(TiO2)30 + D1–D4 system was optimized by using the 3-21G* basis set and the initial geometry was taken from the relaxed geometry of the (TiO2)30 cluster and D1–D4.
