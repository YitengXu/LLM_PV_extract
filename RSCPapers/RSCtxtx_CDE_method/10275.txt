Two new conjugated polymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and alkyl-benzotrithiophene (alkyl-BTT, P1), or acyl-benzotrithiophene (acyl-BTT, P2) were synthesized by a Stille cross-coupling reaction. The polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption as well as electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. Compared to the alkyl-BTT-based polymer (P1), the acyl-BTT-based polymer (P2) displayed a lower optical bandgap and a lower HOMO energy level. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) also confirmed that P2-based devices possessed better photovoltaic properties than those of P1-based devices. The optimized photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an active layer of a blend P2 and PC71BM using 2 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive, and a PCE of 4.20% was obtained, with a Voc as high as 0.96 V under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 with a solar simulator.

Research on conjugated polymers for polymer solar cell (PSC) applications has attracted much attention in recent years because PSCs have a potential to generate electricity from sunlight at low cost. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type PSCs based on blending of electron-donating conjugated polymers and high-electron affinity fullerene derivatives such as PCBM have become the most successful device structure for PSCs so far. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the product of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) divided by the incoming light power density. The proved design rules for donor conjugated polymers in PCBM based BHJ devices are as follows: a deep HOMO level for high Voc and a low bandgap for large solar photo harvest. Therefore, to pursue high PCE, many new low bandgap conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized, and encouraging progress has been made with PCE of PSCs approaching 8% in the past few years. Benzodithiophene (BDT) has proved to be one of the most useful donor moieties for high performance photovoltaic devices with PCBM acceptors. BDT has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure, and hence tight and regular stacking can be expected for the BDT-based conjugated polymers. In order to increase the size and electronic density of the aromatic building block, the benzotrithiophene (BTT) was designed with inspiration from BDT by fusing three thiophene units to a central benzene core instead of two. Recently, BTTs have emerged as a class of attractive building blocks for the design of various types of organic semiconductor materials. BTT has high co-planarity and extended π-conjugation which are beneficial for promoting intermolecular π-stacking and charge transport.

In this paper, two new conjugated polymers based on BDT and alkyl-BTT (P1), or acyl-BTT (P2) were synthesized by a Stille cross-coupling reaction. The optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of polymers were investigated. The acyl-BTT-based polymer (P2) displayed a lower optical bandgap and a lower HOMO energy level than those of the alkyl-BTT-based polymer (P1). PSCs also confirmed that P2-based devices possessed better photovoltaic properties than those of P1-based devices. PSC device studies on P2 showed a high Voc of 0.96 V and a PCE of 4.20%. The combination of a broad optical bandgap (2.07 eV), high Voc (0.96 V) and high PCE (4.20%) has made the acyl-BTT-based polymer (P2) a promising material for the application in tandem solar cells.

The synthetic routes for monomers and polymers are illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. Monomer 1–6 (ref. 20) and 7 (ref. 27) were synthesized according to the literature. In order to obtain good solubility, the branched 2-hexyldecyl and (2-hexyldecyl)oxy groups were introduced into the BTT and BDT core, respectively. The solubilizing side chain was incorporated by Friedel–Crafts acylation from 2,3-dibromothiophene, and then the resulting ketone compound was changed into a trithiophene compound through the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The trithiophene compound was subsequently ring-closed oxidatively with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) to form acyl-functionalized BTT, which was easily converted to dibromo-acyl-BTT monomer 6 with NBS in DMF at about 50 °C. The acyl-functionalized BTT was reacted through a Huang-Minlon modification, followed by lithiation and bromination to afford the dibromo-alkyl-BTT monomer 5 in a moderate yield. Finally, conjugated polymers P1 and P2 were synthesized by a Stille cross-coupling reaction in the presence of tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3) as a catalyst and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-toly)3) as a ligand. The crude polymers were purified by precipitating in methanol and washing with methanol and petroleum ether by Soxhlet extraction for 24 h each to remove oligomers. Then the residues were extracted with hot chloroform for another 24 h. After concentrating the chloroform solvent under reduced pressure, the polymers were obtained by precipitating in methanol. The polymers showed good solubility in solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene at room temperature. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to verify the structure of polymers. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of the polymers were 28.2 kDa and 38.5 kDa with the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 1.89 and 2.17 for P1 and P2, respectively. The NMR and GPC plots are shown in the ESI.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in dilute chloroform solution and as thin films cast from chloroform are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1. P1 showed a maximal absorption peak (λabsmax) and an absorption band-edge (λabsonset) at 534 nm and 571 nm in chloroform solution while λabsmax and λabsonset of the solid film were located at 539 nm and 581 nm, respectively. P2 showed λabsmax and λabsonset at 540 nm and 580 nm in chloroform solution while those of solid films were located at 542 nm and 597 nm, respectively. Compared to the solutions, the corresponding absorption peaks of P1 and P2 films were slightly red-shifted by about 2–17 nm, which indicated the ordering of the molecules or the π–π* interchain interaction in the solid thin films. The spectra of P2 were red-shifted compared with those of P1. Moreover, P2 had a new absorption band around 360 nm, which is most likely attributed to the π–π* transition of acyl-functionalized BTT chromophores in the polymer chain. The λabsonset of the P2 thin film showed a red-shift of 16 nm compared with that of the P1 thin film. This red-shift showed that P2 had a better conjugated structure than P1. The extended conjugated structure resulted in a relatively small Eoptg through the reduction of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level or raising of the HOMO energy level. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) were calculated from the absorption edges of solid state films. Accordingly, the Eoptg was calculated to be 2.13 eV and 2.07 eV for P1 and P2, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammograms of P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. 2. The potentials were referenced to Ag/Ag+. The redox Fc/Fc+ was assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV in a vacuum. The redox Fc/Fc+ was measured under the same conditions as those of polymer samples and was located at 0.1 V related to the Ag/Ag+ electrode. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The onset oxidation potentials (Eoxonset) of P1 and P2 were located at 0.81 V and 0.90 V, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were at −5.51 eV and −5.60 eV, which were calculated according to the equation: HOMO = −(Eoxonset + 4.70) eV. The LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were at −3.38 eV and −3.53 eV, which were calculated from the Eoptg and HOMO energy levels of the polymers, respectively. The two polymers possessed deep HOMO energy levels. It was well known that the Voc of polymer solar cells was closely related to the gap between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the electron acceptor material in the BHJ structure, and therefore the synthesis of a new polymer donor material with a deep HOMO energy level was the key to obtain high performance polymer solar cells. Deep HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were desired for achieving higher Voc in BHJ PSCs and made P1 and P2 promising candidates for use as polymer donor materials. It is worth noting that HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P2 were slightly lower than those of P1, which might be caused by the electron deficient acyl-groups in P2 side chains. The similar results had been reported from acyl polymers in the previous literature.


Polymer solar cells devices with polymer P1 and P2 as electron donors and PC61BM (or PC71BM) as an electron acceptor were fabricated. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. Solar cell devices were characterized under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 with a solar simulator. Different polymer/PC61BM weight ratios, such as 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 have been investigated to optimize the photovoltaic properties. The corresponding photovoltaic performances of devices with different ratios are summarized in Table 2. The polymer/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:3 showed the best device performances. At a 1:3 weight ratio of polymer/PC61BM, the device with P1/PC61BM as the active layer gave an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 1.67 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 65.9%, and resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.00%. The device with P2/PC61BM as the active layer exhibited a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 3.55 mA cm−2, an FF of 49.3%, and resulted in a PCE of 1.48%. Control over the morphology was crucial for the performance of BHJ solar cells. Several processing additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) could be used for morphology optimization. According to our previous work, a small amount of DIO (2 vol%) was chosen as a processing additive to optimize the device performance. The results are listed in Table 2. For P1/PC61BM (1:2), the addition of DIO (2 vol%) increased the Jsc from 1.69 mA cm−2 to 3.45 mA cm−2, slightly improved the FF from 60.3% to 67.9%, and resulted in a higher PCE of 2.00%. For P2/PC61BM (1:2), the addition of DIO (2 vol%) increased the Jsc from 2.39 mA cm−2 to 5.05 mA cm−2, slightly decreased the FF from 57.6% to 48.1%, and resulted in a higher PCE of 2.29%.

In this work, the PC71BM was selected as the electron acceptor to optimize the device performance because PC71BM had electronic properties similar to those of PC61BM but possessed a much stronger absorption in the visible region, which could improve the absorption of the donor material. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices based on the P1 (or P2)/PC71BM blend with a DIO additive (2 vol%) are presented in Fig. 3 and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 2. With the selection of PC71BM as the electron acceptor, the P1 based device had an average PCE of 2.50%, a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 5.14 mA cm−2, an FF of 57.7%. For the P2/PC71BM devices, PCEs up to 4.20% were observed with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 8.19 mA cm−2, an FF of 53.6%. The significant increase of Jsc and PCE was attributed to the improvement of the complementary absorption of PC71BM and charge separation in BHJ. From the device results, it was known that choosing PC71BM as the electron acceptor and using DIO as a processing additive played important roles in improving the photovoltaic performance.
To evaluate the photo-response of polymers and calibrate the Jsc data, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on P1/PC71BM and P2/PC71BM processed with the DIO additive are displayed in Fig. 4. The P2 based device showed a higher EQE value than that of the P1 based device in the region of 300 to 700 nm. This may result from more efficient light absorption of P2 in the region and better morphology of the P2/PC71BM active layer. The Jsc and PCE values could be calculated by integrating the EQE data with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum. For the P2/PC71BM based device with a processing additive system, which had the highest PCE value in this work, the calculated Jsc was 7.97 mA cm−2 and the calculated PCE was 4.10% using the Voc and FF values obtained from J–V measurements. The Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve was about 2.4% error compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves.

The morphology played an important role in the photovoltaic performances. Proper morphology was necessary not only for exciton dissociation, but also for charge transport to the respective contact. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the morphology of the active layer. AFM topography and phase images were measured on films cast from the polymer/PC71BM blend with a 2 vol% DIO processing additive. As shown in Fig. 5, the P1/PC71BM blend film displayed a higher surface roughness than that of the P2/PC71BM blend film. Moreover, the P1/PC71BM blend film displayed relatively large phase separations, which led to poor exciton dissociation efficiency and a relatively low Jsc. The P2/PC71BM blend film exhibited fine domains and no large phased separation could be found. The results indicated that P2/PC71BM with DIO had excellent film-forming properties. The morphology of P2/PC71BM with DIO was of benefit for the exciton dissociation and charge transportation, and therefore, the Jsc and PCE of the P2/PC71BM device reached 8.19 mA cm−2 and 4.20%, respectively.


In summary, two new conjugated polymers based on benzotrithiophene and benzodithiophene were designed and synthesized. The two polymers possessed deep HOMO energy levels, which resulted in high Voc in PSC devices based on these polymers. Polymer P2 with electron deficient acyl-groups displayed the lower HOMO energy levels and better photovoltaic performances than those of P1 with alkyl-groups. The photovoltaic performances of polymers-based devices could be effectively optimized by using PC71BM as an electron acceptor and DIO as a processing additive. Polymer P2 based devices achieved a PCE of 4.20% and a Voc of 0.96 V. The broad optical bandgap, high Voc and high PCE made this new polymer a good candidate for OPV applications in tandem solar cells.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus 400 MHz machine. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were performed on a Waters Series 1525 gel coupled with a UV-vis detector using tetrahydrofuran as an eluent with polystyrene as standards. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model λ 20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were conducted under nitrogen in a deoxygenated anhydrous acetonitrile solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M), using a CHI 660D electrochemical analyzer. A platinum-disc electrode was used as a working electrode, a platinum-wire was used as an auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode was used as a reference electrode. The polymer thin film was coated on the platinum-disc electrode and ferrocene was used as a reference. Tapping atomic force microscopy (AFM) was obtained using a Veeco Multimode V instrument.


Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, isopropyl alcohol and acetone, and the organic residue was further removed by treating with UV-ozone for 15 min. ITO substrates were spin-coated with a thin film about 40 nm of PEDOT:PSS and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. A blend of polymer and PCBM was solubilized in chloride solvent with or without DIO, filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter, spin-coated at different rpm (1500 rpm for CF and 700 rpm for CB and ODCB) for 40 s, 0.6 nm of LiF (0.1 A s−1) and 100 nm Al (2 A s−1) layers were then thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 72.5 mm2). The current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) Digital source meter under one sun of simulated air mass 1.5G (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport Stratford, Inc., 94023A). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a Jobin-Yvon Triax 180 spectrometer, a Jobin-Yvon xenon light source, a Merlin lock-in amplifier, a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR 570 low noise current amplifier.
