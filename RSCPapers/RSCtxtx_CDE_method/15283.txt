Polymer acceptors with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) building blocks have demonstrated great potential in achieving excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs). Currently, most of the A–D–A building blocks are composed of benzene-fused end groups, while other aromatic-fused terminal groups are rarely reported, which makes material diversity fall behind. Herein, a newly designed polymer acceptor with thiophene-fused end groups, namely PIDTC-T, is synthesized, which works well with PM6 in all-polymer OSCs based on their combination (PCE = 8.35%), indicative of its good compatibility with PM6. Critically, efficient liquid additive-free OSCs have been realized by doping PIDTC-T as involatile solid additive into the PM6:Y6 blend, achieving a remarkable PCE of 16.76% compared to the original 15.87%, along with better shelf life, photostability and thermostability. A similar achievement is obtained in as-cast PM6:Y6 devices. The mechanistic study reveals tuned morphology, complementary absorption spectra and adjusted composition distribution in devices, leading to higher mobility and suppressed recombination, which concurrently contribute to the improved photovoltaic performance of PM6:Y6 system. Our work can be considered meaningful as it helps in enriching material for polymer acceptors and fabricating stable and efficient OSCs without liquid additives.

Organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization requires efficient and stable products, which can be realized by the continuously developing photovoltaic materials and evolving device engineering. Inspired by Y6 (ref. 13), a revolutionary non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), many projects concentrated on obtaining higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) which pushed it towards 18% . Moreover, the stability of OSCs experienced a long term but rapid progress during this episode.

Polymers are considered stable and stretchable, both of which are ideal features for OSCs. Thus, producing compatible polymer acceptors to cope with well-developed high-performance polymer donors is a reasonable and promising direction. Traditional polymer acceptors based on naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide building blocks have been mainstream for decades. Recently, polymerized acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structural materials have come into the view of researchers because of their great potential in boosting excellent PCE, most of which, however, are connected small molecules with benzo-fusing based terminal groups, resulting in the lack of material abundance. In the A–D–A type small molecules, those with thiophene-fused end groups were intensively developed, and in comparison with benzene-fused end groups, thiophene-fused end groups show enhanced intermolecular interaction, indicative of the possibility for polymerization to be used for pursuing greater performance of state-of-the-art OSCs.
In our study, we synthesized a polymer acceptor PIDTC-T with thiophene-fused ending-group IDTC-C16 as a building block, and as a result it exhibits comparable energy level distribution and UV-vis absorption with PM6, a typical efficient polymer donor, which is further proven by corresponding all-polymer OSCs, whose optimal devices displayed an acceptable PCE of 8.37%. Encouraged by such good compatibility, we subsequently used PIDTC-T as an involatile solid additive and added it into the PM6:Y6 blend in order to fabricate efficient OSCs w/o liquid additive, e.g. 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), which is acknowledged of being beneficial to the stability and reproducibility of devices. Satisfactorily, the optimal PM6:Y6 with PIDTC-T (2% weight ratio) demonstrated an obvious improvement in PCE (16.76%), from 15.87% (w/o any additive), facilitated by simultaneously enhanced short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), while the open circuit voltage (VOC) was maintained. Shelf-life stability, photostability and thermal stability of these novel materials appeared to be distinguishably better than a pure binary system. Related characterizations revealed that stronger absorption, rationalized blend morphology and redistribution of composition in the film are responsible for the elevated photovoltaic performance. Similar improvement was also observed in as-cast PM6:Y6 devices.

The synthetic details of PIDTC-T are elaborated in ESI, and its chemical structures are shown together with those of PM6 and Y6 in Fig. 1a. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction between IDT-CHO and CPTCN-Br was employed to prepare IDTC-C16-Br, and then the target polymer PIDTC-T was synthesized via Stille coupling reaction between IDTC-C16-Br and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene. Devices are all made in conventional form of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag, whose schematic is shown in Fig. 1b. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to evaluate the energy level distribution of acceptor materials in this study, and Fig. 1c shows their measurement curves. The calculated values of highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level are −5.99 and −4.05 eV for PIDTC-T and −5.72 and −4.00 eV for Y6, respectively.


Fig. 1d illustrates PIDTC-T's UV-vis absorption spectra in a diluted chloroform solution and neat film. The absorption curve of the solution demonstrates two peaks at 648 and 704 nm, respectively, which are redshifted to 666 and 734 nm in the pure film; moreover, those of PM6 and Y6's pure films are also displayed together, which clearly addresses the complementary profiles of these three materials. As shown in Fig. 1e, the absorption curves of blend films based on PM6:Y6, PM6:PIDTC-T and PIDTC-T doped PM6:Y6 (2% weight ratio) exhibit consistent features as indicated in previous analysis, that slightly added PIDTC-T enhances PM6:Y6's absorption in the region from approximately 650 to 800 nm. Attractively, the 350–450 nm region of the doped film is also enhanced. Therefore, a strong insinuation that using PIDTC-T as n solid additive would increase the JSC of PM6:Y6 system is obtained.
Then, we concentrated on analyzing device results. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the champion devices for each blend are presented in Fig. 2a, and related indexes are calculated and summarized in Table 1. The PM6:PIDTC-T-based all-polymer OSCs exhibited a medium-level PCE of 8.35%, together with a VOC of 0.815 V, a JSC of 16.19 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.3%, which confirmed that this novel polymer acceptor matches well with PM6. As for the PM6:Y6 blend processed without any additive, the champion efficiency was achieved as high as 15.87%, with a VOC of 0.848 V, JSC of 25.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.1%. Apparently, additive-free PM6:Y6 devices are not at the same level with other high-performance systems. With the PIDTC-T doping ratio of 2% in mass, the PM6:Y6-based OSCs successfully boast a greater PCE of 16.76%, pushed up by greater JSC (25.50 mA cm−2) and FF (77.6%), synergistically. This result is also higher than that of PM6:Y6 with 0.5% vol CN in our previous work, listed in Table 1. To make sure the credibility of current values, monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency measurements (IPCE) were carried out, and their spectra are shown in Fig. 2b, along with calculated values in Table 1. The calibrated JSC values of these measurements are 15.64, 24.70 and 25.00 mA cm−2, respectively, which indicates that the errors of measurement results are controlled within 3%. The slightly higher efficiency in a long wavelength region (800–900 nm) is attributed to the PIDTC-T-containing PM6:Y6 blend, instead of pure PM6:Y6-based OSCs, which seems to be contradictory to their UV-vis absorption profiles. This might be caused by lower optimal thickness and higher charge generation and collection efficiency of the PIDTC-T-containing PM6:Y6 blend. Not only was the instantaneous PCE of device improved by adding PIDTC-T but also its stability was increased owing to the polymer acceptor's inherent advantages. As drawn in Fig. 2c–e, PM6:Y6-based devices maintain 87.2% efficiency on average after 125 h, while those of all-polymer solar cells and PM6:Y6-doped PIDTC-T are 92.3% and 91%, respectively. The efficiencies under light soaking are 81.2%, 84.4% and 83.1% for the samples, respectively. The thermostabilities of all-polymer cells and PIDTC-T added PM6:Y6 are 69.4% and 62.9%, both greater than that (40.5%) of pure PM6:Y6, after being annealed at 150 °C for 20 h. The average values of PCE variations are listed in Tables S1–S3.

The relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was measured to assess the efficiency of exciton generation and charge collection.Jph refers to the difference between the current value under illumination and dark current. Subsequently, Veff is defined as the gap between V0 (when Jph is equal to 0) and Vappl (applied voltage). Assuming all excitons are separated when the external voltage is high enough, we can obtain the value of the saturation current density (Jsat), and the ratio of JSC/Jsat and Jmax/Jsat represent exciton generation and charge collection efficiency, whereas Jmax means the current density at the maximal output point. These parameters are listed in Table S4. The charge collection efficiency of PM6:PIDTC-T all-polymer devices is only 70.3%, which is consistent with its low FF. The additive-free PM6:Y6 blend displays a 92.9% dissociation efficiency and a 83.3% collection efficiency, and those of films with solid additive PIDTC-T are 94.2% and 87.0%, respectively. Therefore, our predictions are substantiated by this investigation.
In the next step, the recombination analysis is performed through plotting VOCvs. Plight and JSCvs. Plight curves to gain a more in-depth understanding of charge collection, where Plight refers to the incident light intensity. The slope of the VOC and the logarithmic value of Plight is expressed as nkT/q, in which q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the thermodynamic temperature. Usually the n value locates at the interval from 1 to 2. The n value being close to 1 indicates bimolecular recombination (Rbm) and shows a dominant effect, while the trap state-induced recombination (Rt,s) is weak, and vice versa when n is nearly 2. As presented in Fig. 3a, the slope of PM6:PIDTC-T is obviously higher than that of the PM6:Y6 host system-based OSCs, and the calculated value of n for this all-polymer blend is 1.84, implying Rt,s is the main impacting factor instead of Rbm. The n value of the PM6:Y6 film is 1.23 w/o additive and 1.11 for the PIDTC-T doped system, insinuating that introducing a little amount of this polymer is helpful to decrease the trap state in active layers. As a supplement, we fitted the tails of the EQE spectra, which can provide the estimated value of the Urbach energy (EU) for each system. The EU values of PM6:PIDTC, PM6:Y6 and PM6:Y6:PIDTC are 42.77, 30.47 and 29.36 meV. These results imply that the energetic disorder of the PM6:Y6 blend was reduced by incorporating PIDTC-T as an additive, and thus weakened the band tail state and trap state, which agree with the phenomenon in JSCvs. Plight curves. Fig. 3b provides JSCvs. Plight curves, where the slope S of JSC and Plight's logarithmic values represent Rbm's degree. For the all-polymer composed film, the S value is fitted to be 0.873, which is obviously lower than that (S = 0.957) of the PM6:Y6 blend, and the polymer-doped blend exhibits a 0.972 S value. These results prove that adding PIDTC-T can suppress the Rbm as well.
Previous studies revealed that suitably enhanced mobilities in films can suppress the nongeminate recombination; therefore, motivated by this we chose a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to evaluate it. Calculation formulas and device fabrication details are offered in ESI. The hole mobility (μh) of a pure PM6:Y6 binary active layer is 6.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron mobility (μe) is 3.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thence, the μh/μe is equal to 1.80. By adding 2% of PIDTC-T in mass to the host system, the blend exhibits increased and more balanced mobilities, (μh = 7.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 4.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh/μe = 1.65). As for PM6:PIDTC-T based devices, μh and μe come up to the highest value of 9.54 × 10−4 and 4.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, but a least mobility balance appears for the ratio is equal to 2.06. Appropriately increased mobility in the PM6:Y6 (2% PIDTC-T) system is probably beneficial to the charge transport. In contrast, the high and unbalanced mobility of the PM6:PIDTC-T blend leans to induce more electron–hole pairs due to morphology defects.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was utilized to investigate the molecular morphological features of the films. In Fig. 4a, obtained two dimensional (2D) patterns of both pure and blend films are displayed, along with the corresponding intensity profiles given in Fig. 4b and c. PIDTC-T exhibits bimodal molecular orientation with a strong edge-on lamellar (100) peak located at qz = 0.28 Å−1 (d = 22.44 Å) and a relatively weak face-on lamellar peak in the IP direction. The π–π peaks appear in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions at q = 1.64 Å−1 (d = 3.83 Å). As for blend films, the sharp (100) and (010) peaks along the OOP direction of the PM6:PIDTC-T blend film are contributed by PIDTC-T and the (100) peak in the IP orientation is induced by PM6, respectively, in accordance with peak positions in pure films. The CCL is 102.7 Å for the OOP (100) peak but a relatively small CCL value (15.7 Å) for the π–π stacking peak. Adding this polymer acceptor as a solid additive, the ternary blend film maintained the scattering pattern of binary PM6:Y6 films, further verifying its incorporation in small amounts to be essential of the additive. Furthermore, the phase separation information was also explored via the grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) technique. The scattering from pure and intermixing phases is a fitted fractal-like network and Debye–Anderson–Brumberger models, respectively. Computed values can be found in Table S2, while cut-line profiles are plotted in Fig. S6. The pure phase domain size (2Rg) of the all-polymer PM6:PIDTC-T film is about 16.6 nm, while its amorphous intermixing phase is as large as 69.2 nm, which suggests too great of a mixing phase that is detrimental to the charge transport with much bimolecular recombination. This finding is consistent with the much lower photocurrent and FF. The pure phase domain sizes for the binary PM6:Y6 blend film and ternary blend film are 26.1 nm and 21.3 nm, respectively, while the intermixing domain sizes are 53.2 nm and 42.1 nm, respectively. The polymer additive successfully shrinks the domain sizes in the ternary film, which benefits the exciton diffusion and charge transport via depressed recombination, leading to increased JSC and FF, and thus higher device performance.
The surface wettability of neat and blend films through using contact angle measurement was also performed. As presented in Fig. S1, the water's contact angles are 103.07°, 108.17° and 102.76° for PIDTC-T, PM6 and Y6 neat films, respectively. Therefore, the PM6 film is more hydrophobic than Y6 and PIDTC-T. The PM6:Y6 blend film possesses a water contact angle of 107.47°, manifesting a similar hydrophobia to pure PM6 film. Hence, there is probably a high proportion of PM6 at the surface, and thus in the upper part of the film, which is a disadvantage for the charge transport and collection for devices with the conventional structure. In contrast, the water contact angle of PM6:PIDTC-T is 102.88°, indicating a very low content of PM6 appears at the film surface. The polymer acceptor-doped PM6:Y6 system displays a similar angle with all-polymer based film, supporting that the incorporation of PIDTC-T significantly reduces the PM6's distribution at the film's surface.

In general, we successfully attempted on synthesizing a polymer acceptor based on thiophene-type end-group small molecules, which affords a medium-level PCE coping with PM6. This enables a more efficient and stable PM6:Y6-based OSC as a solid additive without volatilization, which is potentially beneficial to device reproducibility, proposed in a previous study. After systematic investigation photovoltaically and morphologically, it is believed that our newly designed polymer acceptor PIDTC-T leads to reasonable phase separation, increased and more balanced mobilities, suppressed recombination, complemented absorption and redistributed composition in active layers, boosting efficiency. This research delivered a new-type polymer acceptor and combined material innovation and device engineering, paving an avenue towards high-performance and stable OSCs, and thus demonstrates potential for further development.
