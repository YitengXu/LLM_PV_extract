Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from the issues of poor reproducibility and inferior stability despite their considerable increase in efficiency. Here, we demonstrate planar PSCs with simultaneously improved device characteristics and stability by introducing a cross-linkable [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD) into CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x perovskites. The cross-linkable merit of C-PCBSD can enhance the crystallization of perovskites and address the issue of low electron extraction efficiency. In addition, the anti-solvent network of C-PCBSD facilitates the sequential solution process and prevents washing by the solvent used in the upper layer. The C-PCBSD network resisted the moisture incursion and protected the interfaces from erosion, and it passivated the voids or pinholes generated in the bulk active layer. As a result, an outstanding PSC with a power conversion efficiency of 17.21% is achieved with evidently improved cell stability.

In recent years, organometallic halide perovskite-based solar cells have rapidly become a focal point of the photovoltaic community due to their incredible achievement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20%. Despite the high efficiency, many fundamental questions remain unclear and need to be addressed at both the material and device levels. For example, unbalanced electron and hole diffusion lengths in the perovskites hamper the further improvement of PCEs in PSCs. Uncontrolled film morphology associated with bad crystalline quality of the perovskites results in low efficiency and poor reproducibility of the device performance. In addition, the inferior stability may delay the progress of PSCs towards commercialization since the highest-efficiency PSCs based on present deposition techniques exhibit short device lifetimes. Some efforts on device structure, additive and interface engineering have been carried out to address these issues. For example, perovskites and fullerene derivatives were blended to balance the charge extraction, reduce the hysteresis and recombination loss, and improve the device fill factor. Alkyl phosphonic acid ω-ammonium chloride was used to crosslink the perovskite crystals, resulting in considerable increase in both the device efficiency and stability. It should be noted that chlorobenzene (CB) or o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), which were used as the solvent of the PCBM or Spiro-OMeTAD, has the potential risk of washing out the fullerene derivatives in the perovskite-absorbing layer. Therefore, developing solvent-resistant and facile film-processing methodologies, which may resolve the intrinsic issues such as charge extraction efficiency, crystallinity and stability in PSCs, is an efficient route to achieve high-performance PSCs with long-term stability.

[6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD) is a PCBM-based n-type material with a dendron containing two styryl groups functionalized as thermal cross-linkers. The anti-solvent, cross-linked PCBSD (C-PCBSD) has been utilized successfully in polymer solar cells with not only superior device characteristics but also remarkable long-term stability. Preparation of perovskite film based on the one-step deposition technique often suffers from an uncontrollable active layer with various morphologies and invariably contains defects such as voids or pinholes in the bulk perovskite films. Herein, we report the synthesis of planar structure perovskite solar cells by blending perovskite materials (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x) with the cross-linked fullerene (C-PCBSD) to realize high-performance PSCs. C-PCBSD can act as the electron acceptor in the composites of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x: C-PCBSD to solve the problem of low electron extraction. More importantly, the high-quality and pinhole-less thin film of perovskites is formed with the help of the cross-linkable network of PCBSD. It effectively suppressed the shunt resistance and leakage current. As a result, the cross-linked PCBSD-based PSCs showed a tremendously enhanced PCE of 17.21%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.98 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.81 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77%. In comparison, the conventional CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x-based planar PSCs showed a PCE of 12.59%, with Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 18.67 mA cm−2, and FF of 71%. Furthermore, the devices based on cross-linked structure were found to retain remarkable long-term stability compared to the control devices.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PVP AI 4083) was purchased from Heraeus (Germany). Methylamine (CH3NH2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.99%), HI (99%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Ltd. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and Bphen were purchased from Nichem Fine Technology Co. Ltd (Taiwan). Cross-linkable [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD) was synthesized according to our previous report.


The perovskite precursor solution containing C-PCBSD was prepared as follows. CH3NH3I (256 mg), PCBSD (varied mass) and 149 mg PbCl2 were dissolved in 1 ml DMF (1 ml) mixed solvent with stirring overnight at 60 °C in the glove box. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 8 h and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before use. The pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrate with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω sq−1 was coated with PEDOT:PSS under 4500 rpm/40 s followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min in air. Then, the sample was moved to the glove box for further layer deposition. Perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm/40 s in the glove box. The annealing was carried out by heating from 60 to 100 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/10 min and then kept at 100 °C in the nitrogen glove box. PC61BM (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) and Bphen were coated subsequently with room-temperature annealing. Finally, the device was moved out of the glove box and transferred to a vacuum chamber under 2 × 10−6 Torr for Ag electrode evaporation. The active area of each device is 7.25 mm2.



J–V characteristics of perovskite solar cells under 1 sun illumination were obtained using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under Air Mass (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained from a Quanta 200 FEG. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted using PANalytical (Empyrean) equipment. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were performed at the BL14B1 beam line of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using X-ray with a wavelength of 0.6887 Å. Two-dimensional (2D) GIXRD patterns were acquired by a Mar 3450 mounted vertically at a distance of ∼442.745 mm from the sample with a grazing incidence angle of 0.2° and an exposure time of 10 s. The 2D GIXRD patterns were analyzed using the FIT2D software and displayed in scattering vector q coordinates. The absorbance of the perovskite films was measured with an UV/vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The transmission IR spectra were recorded from a Bruker Vertex 80v FTIR spectrometer in air. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurement was performed using a system combining a xenon lamp, a monochromator, a chopper, and a lock-in amplifier together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. The electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was obtained using an IM6e Electrochemical Workstation (ZAHNER, Germany) with alternating current amplitude of 10 mV. Steady-state photo-luminescence (PL) measurements were acquired using Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer with a 532 nm pulsed laser as excitation source at room temperature. UPS analysis measurements were done using an unfiltered He I (21.2 eV) gas discharge lamp and a hemispherical analyzer.


Perovskite solar cells based on a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (280 nm)/PC61BM (50 nm)/Bphen (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (Fig. 1a) were fabricated to demonstrate the role of cross-linked PCBSD in realizing high-performance solar cells. PEDOT:PSS is selected as a hole extraction layer by its sufficient charge dissociation and extraction in the planar-structured solar cells. Solution-processed Bphen is utilized as an interfacial layer that can flatten the cathode interface effectively.Fig. 1b shows a schematic illustration of two neighboring grain structures of perovskites in which the gaps are filled by the C-PCBSD molecules.


Composite active layers were prepared and deposited on PEDOT:PSS using one-step spin-coating of a mixture of CH3NH3I, PbCl2 and PCBSD. CH3NH3I and PbCl2 were mixed in a fixed molar ratio of 3:1. PCBSD was blended at varied ratios for optimization. The control CH3NH3I:PbCl2 precursor solution had a bright and aurantiaceous color. Upon introducing.

PCBSD, the solution gradually became brownish-black (Fig. S1 in ESI). The optimized blending mass of PCBSD was found to be 6 mg ml−1 based on the device performance measurements (Fig. S2 and S3, and Tables S1 and S2 in ESI). Since the in situ cross-linking of PCBSD has to be realized by the thermal cross-linkers of two styryl groups, a continuous heating at 100 °C for 6 hours was found to be the best annealing condition for the formation of anti-solvent C-PCBSD, as shown in Fig. S4. In addition, C-PCBSD molecules distributed homogeneously in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD bulk films, which was confirmed by the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) detecting especially the carbon element content mapping (Fig. S5 in ESI).
CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD active layers evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed obviously different surface morphologies. Representatively, Fig. 2a and b show the SEM cross-sectional images of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD film, respectively. The control CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x perovskite films demonstrate good quality with large grain sizes (∼500 nm). However, large voids or pinholes exist in the films, which may cause short-circuit paths during cell operation. The large leakage current originating from these voids or pinholes was also detrimental to the device performance. Notably, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD films show good surface coverage over the entire substrate. C-PCBSD-based composite films were more compact and denser, and they had larger grain sizes (∼1 μm) compared with control CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x perovskite films. Fewer large voids were observed in the composite films. This suggests that the large voids were filled owing to the infiltration of C-PCBSD into the bulk CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film during the annealing process. Especially, the C-PCBSD formed continuous domains in the composite films, which lowered the short-circuit probability and suppressed the leakage current in the practical devices. Fig. 2c shows the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) transmittance spectra of cross-linked PCBSD thin film with thickness of 50 nm. The vibrational stretching of the vinyl groups at 1622 cm−1 in the PCBSD almost vanished after 6 h heating at 100 °C, which indicates that the cross-linking of PCBSD was realized in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD films under the same annealing condition. The inset of Fig. 2c is the FTIR spectra of the PCBSD precursor and cross-linked PCBSD thin film after heating at 160 °C for 30 minutes. Fig. 2d presents the absorption spectra of the stacked films of PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x (280 nm) and PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (280 nm). Compared with the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film, obvious absorption enhancement is observed in almost the entire visible-light region for the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD film, which probably originates from the contribution of C-PCBSD and its impact on the improved surface coverage and more uniform crystal formation of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x. The results explain the intensively enhanced short-circuit current density in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD active layer-based PSCs (Fig. S2 and S3 in ESI).


Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics of pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (6 h annealing) active layer-based PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The key cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control device based on pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x has a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.67 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V, a fill factor (FF) of 71%, and a resulting PCE of 12.59%, which are comparable with previously reported values. In contrast, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD composite-based devices exhibit very obvious improvements in both Jsc and FF. With optimization, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (6 mg ml−1)-based perovskite solar cells present the best performance with PCE of 17.21%, Jsc of 22.81 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.98 V, and FF of 77% as shown in Fig. 3b. The reproducibility of the device performance was also evaluated by characterizing over 30 cells. Fig. 3c shows a histogram of the PCE parameters in these devices. The lower relative standard deviation illustrates the better reproducibility of the improved performance in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (6 mg ml−1)-based PSCs compared with the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x-based ones. For comparison, J–V characteristics of the pristine (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x), CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM (6 mg ml−1) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (6 mg ml−1)-based PSCs are placed together as shown in Fig. 3d. Corresponding incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of three devices are shown in Fig. 3e. Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectra with the AM 1.5G solar photon flux generates the current densities of 17.93, 21.28 and 22.14 mA cm−2, respectively. The CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM (6 mg ml−1)-based device presents improved performance with PCE of 15.50%, Jsc of 22.05 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.95 V, and FF of 74%. As reported, PCBM plays a critical role in improving the quality of the active layer with large grains and fewer grain boundaries, which result in obviously enhanced Jsc and FF. In present case, Jsc and FF also were increased from 18.67 to 22.05 mA cm−2 and from 71% to 74%, respectively. By replacing PCBM with C-PCBSD, Jsc and FF were further increased to 22.79 mA cm−2 and 77%, respectively.

Furthermore, the J–V curves of three devices with forward and reverse scan directions were recorded (Fig. 3f) to investigate the photocurrent hysteresis phenomenon. The control device presented a large current hysteresis, which causes a large difference between the PCE of 12.59% (forward scan) and the PCE of 10.06% (reverse scan) (Table S3 in ESI). The CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM (6 mg ml−1)-based device showed a reduction in hysteresis relative to the control device. The PCE of 14.66% in reverse scan direction was close to the 15.29% in the forward scan direction. The photocurrent hysteresis is reported to originate from several issues such as the charge traps of low-quality perovskite films, ferroelectric properties of the perovskites, and/or the ion electromigration in perovskites. Actually, PCBM is homogeneously distributed throughout the active layer at perovskite grain boundaries. The introduction of PCBM in the active layer can assist the growth of high-quality perovskite films with largely reduced defects or charge trap sites, which results in suppression of the photocurrent hysteresis. Noticeably, the J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (6 mg ml−1)-based device exhibited nearly no current hysteresis regardless of the scan directions. It suggests that cross-linkable PCBSD played a more important role than PCBM in improving the film quality of the perovskite active layer.

To deeply understand the underlying mechanism of improved device performance in cross-linkable PSCs, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM, and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD films were characterized as shown in Fig. 4a. The PL intensity of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x: C-PCBSD and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM composite films are much weaker than the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x films. This indicates that efficient electron extraction takes place in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD composite film rather than in the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film, which confirms the role of C-PCBSD as the “electron acceptor”. However, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM composite films are not sufficient for the charge separation of excitons. As a result, an additional layer of PCBM film was deposited on top of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD composite films. The similar result coincides with Wu and co-workers' recent report.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the internal series resistance (Rs) in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD-based PSCs. Fig. 4b shows the Nyquist plots of both devices in the dark at an applied voltage of 0.95 V. An equivalent circuit model for the perovskite solar cells is shown in the inset of Fig. 4b. The fitted equivalent circuit model is composed of series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (RCT), which form a parallel circuit with capacitor C. The detailed parameters of the equivalent circuits in two devices are summarized in Table S4 in ESI.RCT is found to be decreased from 1269 Ω (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x-based device) to 861 Ω (CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD-based device).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were further measured to investigate how the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x perovskites was influenced by the blending of cross-linkable PCBSD. Fig. 4c shows the XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD films with same annealing condition at 100 °C in 6 hours. Both pristine and composite films exhibit almost the same diffraction peaks as the previously reported ones. Nevertheless, a small difference in the XRD patterns between the two films is still recognizable. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4c, a signature peak at 12.65°, which originates from the (001) diffraction peak of PbI2, was observed in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x sample. The absence of PbI2 phase in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD suggests a complete reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I when blending with C-PCBSD. Real-time diffraction in two samples based on a fast two-dimensional (2D) area detector combined with a high-brightness synchrotron X-ray source was carried out to obtain the detailed crystal texture and coarsening. The PbI2 phase (001) diffraction peak also appeared in the 2D grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) profile of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film as shown in Fig. 4d. From the 2D GIXRD profiles, the diffraction spots in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD composite film (Fig. 4e) are sharper and weaker than those in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film. The azimuthally integrated intensity plots along the direction of the outside surface (azimuth angle of 90 degrees in the 2D GIXRD) of the corresponding GIXRD patterns of the two films demonstrated that the (110) and (220) peaks in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD film are significantly higher than those in pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film (Fig. S6 in ESI). Fig. 4f shows the azimuthally integrated scattering intensity of corresponding GIXRD patterns along the ring at q = 10 nm−1, which is assigned to the (110) plane of corresponding perovskite structures, where q is the scattering vector (q = 4πsin(θ)/λ). Obviously, the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD sample has a smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) at the azimuth angle of 90°. In addition, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD film also exhibits preferential in-plane (azimuth angle of 90°) and out-of-plane (azimuth angle of 180°) orientations with sharp peaks, which is beneficial for carrier transport and collection. These observations indicate that CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD has a preferred orientation parallel to the substrate and a higher crystal quality. We ascribe the high-quality crystallization as one of the main factors for improved device performance.
Generally, annealing is also an efficient method to assist the film crystallization. Annealing time-dependent XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM (6 mg ml−1) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x: PCBSD (6 mg ml−1) films were recorded (Fig. S7 in ESI) to figure out the origin of better perovskite crystallinity. There were no large changes in the XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBM sample when varying the annealing time from 2 h to 6 h. In contrast, the crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBSD sample improved with annealing time over 3 h. With enough annealing, the cross-linking of PCBSD was realized by the thermal cross-linkers of two styryl groups. In all, cross-linkable PCBSD molecules in the active films can fill the pinholes and vacancies between perovskite grains, which will result in improved film coverage and more uniform perovskite films. This indicates that the improved crystallinity of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:PCBSD is mainly ascribed to the cross-linked blends by C-PCBSD.

In addition, degradation of the perovskite solar cells is mainly associated with the decomposition of the perovskite active layer due to corrosion by moisture that can intrude into the perovskite active layer through the degraded top electrode and with the leakage current caused by the formation of hot spots in the bulk or at the interface. Actually, cross-linkable PCBSD can produce a robust and adhesive film network with sufficient solvent resistance. Therefore, C-PCBSD-based PSCs are expected to demonstrate improved cell stability. Fig. 5a shows the stability tests of pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD composite-based perovskite solar cells without any encapsulation in ambient environment (humidity of 40% ± 5%). Obviously, the C-PCBSD device presents a better stability than that based on the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x. After 180 h, the PCE only decreased to 84.6% of the initial value (from 16.9% to 14.3%) in the C-PCBSD-based device, whereas it decreased to 52.1% of the initial value (from 12.1% to 6.3%) in the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x-based cell. Most probably, the anti-solvent network of C-PCBSD facilitates the sequential solution process and prevents washing by the solvent used in the upper layer. The C-PCBSD network is assumed to resist moisture incursion, resulting in improved cell stability. Fig. 5b presents the XRD patterns of aged (180 h) CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x films with and without C-PCBSD. The (001) diffraction peak of PbI2 at 12.65° appeared in both samples due to the decomposition of the perovskites after a long time of reaction with the water molecules. Interestingly, the intensity of the (001) peak of PbI2 in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD composite film was obviously lower than that in the pristine CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x film, which proves the role of C-PCBSD in resisting the water incursion. The appearance of large amounts of PbI2 decomposed from CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x worsens the absorption of the perovskites (Fig. S8 in ESI), resulting in poor device performance with low efficiency and unstable reliability. Furthermore, the cross-sectional SEM images of the aged (180 h) devices were recorded and are shown in Fig. 5c and d. In the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x-based reference device, many voids appeared because the interface between the perovskite layer and the PCBM layer was seriously deteriorated. In contrast, good interface condition was observed because the C-PCBSD network could resist the moisture incursion to prevent erosion of the interfaces and to passivate the voids or pinholes generated in the bulk active layer. In addition, cross-linkable PCBSD is assumed to prevent the phase separation of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x films, similarly to organic solar cells according to the morphological aging evaluations of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:C-PCBSD (6 mg ml−1) film samples (Fig. S9 in ESI). We attributed it as another possible factor for the improved cell stability.


We have demonstrated planar PSCs with simultaneously improved device performance and stability based on a one-step solution-processable strategy by blending cross-linkable PCBSD and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x. The anti-solvent network of C-PCBSD facilitates the sequential solution process and avoids washing by the solvent used in the upper layer. The C-PCBSD network could resist moisture incursion, thus preventing erosion of the interfaces and passivating the voids or pinholes generated in the bulk active layer. The cross-linkable merit of C-PCBSD can address the issue of low electron extraction efficiency, enhance the crystallization of perovskites, and improve the stability of the PSCs. The promising approach provides a simple route for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable planar bulk heterojunction perovskite solar cells.
