Inverted-type CH3NH3PbI3 flexible perovskite solar cells (FPeSCs) with improved flexibility were prepared by incorporating a polymeric electron conductor, poly([N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (PNDI-2T), into small-molecule electron conductor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor films with different compositions (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100) were employed in PeSCs. The 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T film showed slightly improved power conversion efficiency (average η of 30 samples = 16.59 ± 1.13%, best = 18.4%) compared with PCBM film (average η of 30 samples = 16.49 ± 1.15%, best = 17.8%), as well as similar electrical conductivity and electron mobility, and lower absorption loss. Similarly, inverted planar FPeSCs of 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T films showed improved performance (average η of 20 samples = 13.91 ± 0.84%, best = 15.4%) compared with PCBM (average η of 20 samples = 13.04 ± 0.97%, best = 15.0%). Furthermore, the 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T inverted planar FPeSC films showed significantly improved flexibility compared with PCBM-based devices, due to the entangled polymeric PNDI-2T matrix relieving stress on the PCBM domains.

Electricity is the safest, most convenient energy form for use in modern life. However, electricity has primarily been generated by burning fossil fuels, resulting in CO2 emissions that have created environmental problems, such as global climate change. Therefore, solar cells are promising candidates to replace conventional fossil fuels because they generate electricity by directly converting clean and sustainable solar energy into electric energy.

Crystalline Si solar cells have been used for power generation. However, this method remains more expensive than using fossil fuels due to the expensive vapor processing required. Furthermore, the demand for flexible and portable power generation systems for smart phones, tablets, notebook PCs, and wearable PCs is increasing as technology develops. Light, flexible, and portable power generation systems, such as flexible solar cells, thermoelectric devices, and piezoelectric devices, have received much attention. Among them, flexible solar cells seem promising candidates for flexible and/or portable power generation systems.
To improve flexible solar cells, thinner device architectures and more flexible materials are needed. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (O–IHPe) materials seem to be ideal light absorbers because of their strong absorptivity (due to a direct bandgap), high open circuit voltage (caused by a small exciton binding energy), long charge-carrier diffusion length (resulting from shallow trap formation), and low temperature solution processing (<150 °C). Furthermore, the efficiency of glass-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (O–IHPeSCs) recently surpassed 20% under one-sun conditions (100 mW cm−2), as reported by Kojima et al. for liquid junction CH3NH3PbIX3 (MAPbX3, X = Br and I) perovskite-sensitized solar cells.
Since Kumar et al. reported an efficiency of 2.62% for flexible perovskite solar cells (FPeSCs) composed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/ZnO rod/MAPbI3/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au, extensive studies have reported more efficient and flexible FPeSCs. Liu et al. reported an efficiency of 10.2% for PET/ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag FPeSCs, Shin et al. reported a 15.3% efficiency for polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)/ITO/Zn2SnO2/MAPbI3/polytriarylamine (PTAA)/Au FPeSCs, and Heo et al. recently reported a 15.6% efficiency for PEN/ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/PTAA/Au FPeSCs. Furthermore, Kim et al. showed that the efficiency of PEN/ITO/TiOx/MAPbI3−xClx/Spiro-MeOTAD/Ag FPeSCs remained stable at 12.2%, even after a 1000-cycle bending test with a 10 mm bending radius. However, these normal (n–i–p)-type FPeSCs are known to have relatively poor device stabilities because the ZnO electron conductor has poor chemical stability toward perovskite and hole conductors, such as PTAA and spiro-OMeTAD, that contain corrosive/hygroscopic additives, such as tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI).
In terms of device stability and current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis with respect to the scan direction, Heo et al. claimed that inverted (p–i–n)-type planar PeSCs are more desirable than normal-type PeSCs if the latter do not solve the unbalanced flux issue of electrons and holes for J–V hysteresis reduction and the remove corrosive/hygroscopic additives from the hole conductor. Docampo et al. reported 6.5% efficiency for inverted-type FPeSCs composed of PET/ITO/poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/MAPbI3−xClx/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/TiOx/Al. You et al. also reported an efficiency of 9.2% for PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/Al FPeSCs. Furthermore, inverted-type FPeSCs have better flexibilities than their normal-type counterparts due to using organic electron and hole conductors.
PCBM small molecules have mostly been used as electron conductors in inverted-type FPeSCs, although fully covering the top-surface of the perovskite layer in a very thin layer by spin-coating is relatively difficult compared with polymeric n-type electron conductors, due to the absence of chain entanglement and heat treatment changing their morphology and crystallinity. Therefore, we have introduced poly([N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (PNDI-2T) as a polymeric n-type electron conductor into molecular electron conductor PCBM and assessed the resulting photovoltaic properties. We observed significant improvements to the photovoltaic properties and flexibility of inverted-type FPeSCs compared with devices based on PCBM alone.


Fig. 1 shows the physical properties of PCBM and PNDI-2T electron conductors. Fig. 1(a) shows the molecular structures of PCBM and PNDI-2T, while Fig. 1(b) shows the absorption spectra of PCBM:PNDI-2T films of different composition ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100). PCBM showed stronger absorption than PNDI-2T at 300–360 nm and 420–550 nm-wavelength, while PNDI-2T absorbed more strongly in other wavelength regions. The grazing incident technique is often used to determine crystallite orientation, size, and degree of crystallinity. Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray (GIWAX) scattering images of qxyvs. qz for PCBM:PNDI-2T films with different compositions. From these results, both out-of-plane (Fig. 1(c)) and in-plane (Fig. 1(d)) GIWAX scattering spectra were obtained for the PCBM:PNDI-2T films. Pure PCBM molecular electron conductor film showed 3D ring patterns with no preferred orientation. However, pure PNDI-2T polymeric electron conductor film preferred a face-on orientation, showing strong (100) and (200) lamellar peaks in the in-plane direction and π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction. This implied that PNDI-2T film had better crystallinity and long-range ordering than the PCBM film.

To determine the electrical conductivity (σ0) of the electron conducting films, we deposited approx. 50 nm-thick PCBM:PNDI-2T films with different composition ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) by spin-coating PCMB:PNDI-2T in dichlorobenzene (15 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The measured current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, shown in Fig. 1(e), were determined using the following equation:
I = σ0AVd−1
(1)
where
A is measured sample area (0.16 cm2) and d is sample thickness (50 nm). From the I–V graph slopes, we calculated σ0 of the PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conducting films, with composition ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 giving σ0 of 0.0158, 0.0153, 0.0133, 0.0111, and 0.0089 mS cm−1, respectively, as summarized in Table 1. These results, which had a similar order of magnitude, implied that the efficiency of inverted-type PeSCs was not significantly deteriorated by increasing the PNDI-2T content in PCMB:PNDI-2T films. Furthermore, the electron mobilities of the PCBM:PNDI-2T films were calculated by fabricating electron-only devices with device architecture ITO/ZnO/PCBM:PNDI-2T/LiF/Al using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The electron mobilities of the PCBM:PNDI-2T films with content ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 were 2.60 × 10−4, 2.08 × 10−4, 1.29 × 10−4, 2.63 × 10−5, and 2.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI).

To understand the changes in electrical properties of PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor films with different compositions, we investigated their morphologies, as shown in Fig. 2. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topologies (Fig. 2(a–e)) and phase images (Fig. 2(f–j)) of the PCBM:PNDI-2T films indicated that the 75:25 sample had the roughest topology (rms roughness = 3.14 nm) and largest domains with continuous morphology, whereas the 50:50 and 75:25 samples had apparent sea-island morphologies. The effect of increased PNDI-2T content on morphology and phase separation was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 2(k–o). TEM images showed clear phase separation between the PCBM small-molecule and PNDI-2T polymer materials. Pure PCBM (Fig. 2(k)) and PNDI-2T (Fig. 2(o)) films had a single phase, while their mixed films exhibited PCBM domains (dark gray regions) and PNDI-2T domains (bright gray regions). As PNDI-2T content increased, the size of the PCBM domains gradually decreased, as shown in Fig. 2(l–n). This dramatic change in PCBM:PNDI-2T film morphology might be due to the different surface energies and crystallinities of the two materials. The PCBM domains in 75:25 and 50:50 samples were submicron scale (>100 nm), such that electrons seemed to be transported through each PCBM and PNDI-2T domain, because the thickness of the PCBM:PNDI-2T film in the device was ∼60 nm.

Fig. 3(a) shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional image of ∼200 nm-thick ITO/∼50 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS/∼400 nm-thick MAPbI3/∼60 nm-thick PCBM:PNDI-2T (25:75)/LiF (∼0.5 nm)/Al (∼100 nm) as transparent electrode, hole-transporting layer (HTL), perovskite light-absorber, electron-conducting layer (ETL), and counter electrode, respectively. Fig. 3(b) shows the corresponding band energy diagram of inverted-type MAPbI3 PeSC. Upon illumination, external light enters the inverted-type MAPbI3 PeSC through the ITO transparent electrode and is then gradually absorbed by the MAPbI3 light absorber. When the light passes the MAPbI3 layer, most of the light is absorbed by the MAPbI3 layer but the unabsorbed light passes through the PCBM:PNDI-2T ETL while it is partially absorbed by the PCBM:PNDI-2T layer because the ∼400 nm-thick MAPbI3 layer cannot fully absorb the light from ∼500 nm to ∼800 nm-wavelength region and the thickness of MAPbI3 layer is restricted by the charge carrier's diffusion length to guarantee the efficient charge collection. The light is then reflected by the metal electrode layer and re-absorbed by the PCBM:PNDI-2T/MAPbI3 layer. The MAPbI3 layer generates free charge carriers or loosely bonded excitons by light absorption due to the small exciton binding energy (∼2kT ≈ 50 meV, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature). The generated electrons (holes) are then transferred/transported into PCBM:PNDI-2T ETL (PEDOT:PSS HTL).

Fig. 4(a–e) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of inverted-type MAPbI3 PeSCs containing a PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conducting layer with different compositions. Their photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 1. The inverted-type MAPbI3 PeSCs containing 100:0 PCBM:PNDI-2T exhibited a 1.11 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), 20.8 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density (Jsc), 77.1% fill factor (FF), and 17.8% power conversion efficiency (η) under forward scan conditions, and a 1.11 V Voc, 20.9 mA cm−2Jsc, 78.4% FF, and 18.2% η under reverse scan conditions (average η of 30 sample = 16.49 ± 1.15%). The device containing 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T exhibited slightly better efficiency (1.11 V Voc, 20.8 mA cm−2Jsc, 77.7% FF, and 17.9% η under forward scan conditions and 1.11 V Voc, 20.9 mA cm−2Jsc, 79.3% FF, and 18.4% η under reverse scan conditions; average η of 30 sample = 16.59 ± 1.13%). As the PNDI-2T content was further increased in the PCBM:PNDI-2T mixed film, device performance gradually decreased, as shown in Fig. 4(c–e) and Table 1. The 50:50 PCBM:PNDI-2T sample showed 16.3% η under forward scan conditions and 16.8% η under reverse scan conditions (average η of 30 sample = 14.92 ± 1.09%), the 25:75 PCBM:PNDI-2T sample had 14.9% η under forward scan conditions and 15.4% η under reverse scan conditions (average η of 30 sample = 13.22 ± 1.07%), and the 0:100 PCBM:PNDI-2T sample exhibited 13.7% η under forward scan conditions and 14.3% η under reverse scan conditions (average η of 30 sample = 12.60 ± 1.00%). The insets in Fig. 4 are the average device efficiency and deviation of 30 samples for each PCBM:PNDI-2T composition. Fig. 4(f) shows EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectra of inverted-type MAPbI3 PeSCs with different PCBM:PNDI-2T compositions, indicating that the EQE value gradually decreased as the PNDI-2T content in the PCBM:PNDI-2T film increased over 25%. The Jsc values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra were 20.5, 20.7, 20.3, 20.0, and 19.5 mA cm−2 for 100:0, 27:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 0:100 PCBM:PNDI-2T, respectively. The decrease in Jsc with increased PNDI-2T content might be attributed to the increased absorption by PNDI-2T, as shown in Fig. 1(c), because EQE can be determined using the following equation:
EQE = ηlhe × ηed × ηcs × ηcc
(2)
where
ηlhe, ηed, ηcs, and ηcc are the light harvesting efficiency, exciton diffusion efficiency, charge separation or charge injection efficiency, and charge collection efficiency, respectively. In this case, ηed ≈ 1, because MAPbI3 generates free charge carriers or loosely bonded electron–hole pairs at room temperature. Therefore, the generated excitons tend to be easily dissociated to charge carriers by thermal ionization. In contrast, the slightly improved EQE of 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T compared with 100:0 PCBM:PNDI-2T might be associated with the absorption of PCBM at 420–600 nm being reduced by substitution with PNDI-2T, which had a weak absorption at 420–600 nm, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI).

Based on the above experimental results, we fabricated inverted-type FPeSCs with PCBM:PNDI-2T (100:0, 75:25, and 0:100) to investigated whether the photovoltaic properties and flexibility of inverted-type FPeSCs could be improved by introducing PNDI-2T as a polymeric hole conductor. Fig. 5 shows J–V curves and EQE spectra of PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM:PNDI-2T (100:0, 75:25, and 0:100)/LiF/Al FPeSCs. The photovoltaic properties of the inverted-type MAPbI3 FPeSCs with PCBM:PNDI-2T (100:0, 75:25, and 0:100) electron conductor are summarized in Table 2. Similar to the ITO glass-based inverted-type MAPbI3 PeSCs with PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor, the 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T device exhibited the best efficiency, 1.09 V Voc, 18.4 mA cm−2Jsc, 74.2% FF, and 14.9% η under forward scan conditions and 1.09 V Voc, 18.5 mA cm−2Jsc, 76.4% FF, and 15.4% η under reverse scan conditions (average η of 20 sample = 13.91 ± 0.84%), while the 100:0 sample gave 14.6% (forward scan), 15.0% (reverse scan), and 13.04 ± 0.97% (average η of 20 sample) and the 0:100 sample gave 11.5% (forward scan), 12.0% (reverse scan), and 10.74 ± 0.71% (average η of 20 sample). The EQE spectra of the samples also showed a similar tendency to those of ITO glass-based devices.

To compare the flexibilities of inverted-type MAPbI3 FPeSCs containing 100:0, 75:25, and 0:100 PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductors, we compared their stabilities against bending curvature radius (Fig. 6(a)) and bending cycles (Fig. 6(b–d)). The η of these inverted-type MAPbI3 FPeSCs were measured after bending to different curvature radii, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Overall, inverted-type MAPbI3 FPeSCs containing polymer PNDI-2T electron conductor exhibited better stability against bending radius than FPeSCs with PCBM as the electron conductor. The inverted-type MAPbI3 FPeSCs containing PNDI-2T electron conductor also exhibited better stability under repeated bending cycles than FPeSCs with PCBM alone, as shown in Fig. 6(b and c).
Changes in morphology of inverted FPeSCs containing PCBM:PNDI-2T caused by bending curvature radii and bending cycles were compared by optical microscopy during the bending test (Fig. 7). The detailed microscopy images of the PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor films, with respect to bending curvature radius (12, 8, and 4 mm) and number of bending cycles (0, 150, and 300 cycles), are shown in Fig. S4–S6 (ESI). The results show significant differences in fracture responses with different bending curvature radii and numbers of bending cycles. Pure PCBM electron conductor film showed sharp cracks over the entire film surface with reduced bending curvature radius. The 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T film exhibited fewer cracks than pristine PCBM film, while pure PNDI-2T film showed no severe cracks. Accordingly, the mechanical stability was greatly enhanced by introducing polymeric PNDI-2T electron conductor into the small-molecule PCBM electron conductor.

To prepare the MAPbI3 perovskite solution, MAI (methylammonium iodide) was first synthesized by reacting methylamine (50 mL, 40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical Co. Ltd) with hydriodic acid (50 mL, 57% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with vigorous stirring. A solid residue was obtained by evaporating the solvent using a rotary evaporator at 50 °C for 1 h. This white solid was dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at room temperature to obtain pure MAI. A 40 wt% MAPbI3 perovskite solution was prepared by mixing MAI powder and PbI2 (Aldrich) in a 1:1 molar ratio in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL, Aldrich) at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of hydriodic acid (100 μL, 57% in water, Aldrich).


To prepare inverted MAPbI3 planar hybrid solar cells, filtered PEDOT:PSS (Clevios, Al4083) was coated on a clean ITO glass substrate by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s and drying at 150 °C for 20 min. A 40 wt% MAPbI3/DMF solution containing hydriodic acid (100 μL per 1 mL MAPbI3/DMF solution) was then spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 200 s and dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 2 min. A PCBM:PNDI-2T layer (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) was deposited on the MAPbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate by spin-coating PCBM:PNDI-2T in dichlorobenzene (15 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm for 60 s. PET/ITO substrates were used for flexible devices. After spin coating PEDOT:PSS on PET/ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s, the samples were dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 20 min. The active area was fixed at 0.16 cm2. All device fabrication steps, except LiF (∼0.5 nm)/Al (∼100 nm) deposition and measurement, were conducted in air with relative humidity kept below 35%.


Absorption spectra of PCBM:PNDI-2T films (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) on glass substrates were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. A SOETECH SV-35 video microscope system was used to analyze the electron conductor film surface morphology during the bending test. AFM measurements were obtained using a scanning probe Multimode III instrument with a tapping mode size of 2 × 2 μm2. TEM images of samples were obtained at 200 kV under low dose conditions with a TECVAIG2-T-20S electron microscope. Each sample was characterized using several images (at least 10) over 2–3 sections per grid to ensure that the analysis was based on a representative region of the sample.


The electron mobilities of PCBM:PNDI-2T films (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) were measured with the SCLC method, using equation J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where J = current density, εr = polymer dielectric constant, ε0 = permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), L = film thickness, and V = Vappl − Vbi − Vr (Vappl = applied bias, Vbi = built-in potential due to the difference in electrical contact work functions, and Vr = the voltage drop across the electrodes due to contact and series resistance). The electron device structure was ITO/ZnO/PCBM:PNDI-2T/LiF/Al. Dark J–V measurements (0−5 V range) were fitted in space charge limited form.


2D-GIWAX measurements were recorded on PLS-II in a vacuum at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, South Korea, using the 3C beam line. Samples were prepared on silicon substrates under optimized device fabrication conditions to ensure results were comparable with device performance. The monochromatic X-ray beam (λ = 0.1651 nm) was irradiated through samples at an incident angle of 0.11–0.14° for 5–10 s. The scattered X-ray patterns were recorded with a charge coupled device (CCD) detector (Rayonix SX165).


Current density–voltage curves were measured using a solar simulator (Peccell, PEC-L01) with a potentiostat (IVIUM, IviumStat) under one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G) and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards). J–V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a 0.16 cm2 metal mask. To measure the hysteresis of J–V curves, the forward and reverse scan rates were set to 10 mV·200 ms−1 as the standard condition. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a power source (ABET, 150 W xenon lamp, 13014) with a monochromator (DONGWOO OPTRON Co., Ltd, MonoRa-500i) and potentiostat (IVIUM, IviumStat).


In summary, we have prepared efficient MAPbI3-based inverted planar PeSCs by coating a PNDI-2T polymeric electron conductor with a PCBM small molecular electron conductor and studying the morphological, crystalline, optical, and electric properties of the electron transport layer and their effect on device performance. Among the different PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor film compositions tested (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100), 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T gave electrical properties comparable to pure PCBM, but with enhanced mechanical stability caused by the dispersion of PCBM domains in the entangled polymeric PNDI-2T matrix. This allowed electrons to pass through each domain and relieved mechanical stress on the PCBM domains. The improved mechanical stability and similar electrical properties of 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor compared with pure PCBM facilitated the fabrication of efficient inverted-type FPeSCs with enhanced flexibility. The best device efficiencies for FPeSCs composed of PCBM:PNDI-2T electron conductor films were 15.0% for 100:0 (average η of 20 samples = 13.04 ± 0.97%) and 15.4% for 75:25 (average η of 20 samples = 13.91 ± 0.84%). ITO glass-based inverted PeSCs gave results similar to 75:25 PCBM:PNDI-2T samples (average η of 30 samples = 16.59 ± 1.13%, best = 18.4%) and pure PCBM samples (average η of 30 sample = 16.49 ± 1.15%, best = 17.8%). Incorporating polymeric electron conductors into small-molecule electron conductors could be a promising strategy for synergistically utilizing both their advantages to fabricate FPeSCs with improved reproducibility, efficiency, and chemical and mechanical stabilities.
