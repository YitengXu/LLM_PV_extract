A self-assembled monolayer of 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is prepared on the top of a mesoporous TiO2 electron transfer layer. Through the full characterization of PABA-SAM modified TiO2 and the above-prepared perovskite layer with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), contact angle and photoluminescence, it was clear that the introduction of the SAM improved the interfacial compatibility and therefore the quality of the perovskite, thus leading to fewer traps, better carrier transport and good energy matching between the TiO2 layer and the perovskite layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite device with interfacial modification was enhanced to 10.58% compared with that of the device without SAM.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with optically active methylammonium lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X is I, Cl or Br) have attracted much attention since they were firstly reported by Miyasaka et al. in 2009. They have outstanding properties of appropriate bandgaps, long charge carrier diffusion length and lifetime, high absorption coefficient, low cost and solution processability. It is exciting that the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 20.1% within only 6 years. In order to obtain high efficiency of PSCs, efforts including film fabrication optimization, perovskite structure modification, and interfacial control have been made. One-step solution processing, two-step sequential deposition, and vapor assisted solution process are the main methods in the formation of perovskite crystalline structure. These preparations of perovskite films resulted in various degrees of surface coverage and crystal quality which are crucial for high efficiency in PSCs. In addition, various device configurations, such as planar heterojunction solar cells (without mesoporous TiO2 layer), mesoporous device (with n-type mesoporous metal oxide scaffolds), and hole transfer layer-free PSC, have already been investigated.

Interfacial engineering is identified as an efficient approach for improving device performance in the diverse device architectures of PSCs. In an optoelectronics light illumination induces the formation of free charge carriers. The excited free electrons and holes transfer across the n-type and p-type semiconductors and are collected by corresponding electrodes, respectively. During transport, the free charge carriers can be captured or recombined inevitably due to the existence of traps and defects. Besides the internal imperfection of absorption and transfer layers, the interfacial defects also have non-ignorable effects on charge loss. In organic solar cell (OPV) and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), surface modification on TiO2 is well-known as an effective method to improve the device performance. Through the chemical interaction between the interfacial molecule and surface bonds of the inorganic metal oxide, the modified surface is attached, thus leading to different growth modes of organic semiconductors. Moreover, the interfacial modification can significantly promote electron injection, enhance electron transfer and reduce the charge recombination. In this regard, the interfacial modification in perovskite solar cells which use metal oxide as electron transport material has been investigated. Ogomi and co-workers have introduced HOCO-R-NH3+I− as an anchoring group on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 to tune the perovskite crystal growth and retard the charge recombination. As other examples, C60-substituted benzoic acid, organic silane, 3-aminopropanioc acid and glycine were self-assembled onto the surface of TiO2 or ZnO to serve as an interfacial layer, and the performance of the devices were all improved.
Considering that the carboxylic group is easily chemically bonded to TiO2, and the amino group as a growth site of the crystal of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite favours large crystal formation, and phenyl backbone has the π-conjugated structure and benefits easy electron transport, we assembled a monolayer of 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) which possesses three components onto mesoporous TiO2 surface and discussed the effect of this interfacial layer on the perovskite solar cell performance. The TiO2 surface exhibits significantly improved hydrophilicity after PABA modification. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite grown onto the modified TiO2 layer using two-step sequential method shows fewer traps and enhanced crystallinity than that without PABA modification. These changes facilitate the charge transport and reduce charge recombination, contributing to the increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc). As a result, the device with PABA modification displays a highest efficiency of 10.58% which is higher than the solar cell without interfacial modification (9.63%).

Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (thickness = 1.6 mm, sheet resistance < 15 ohm per square) was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd. Lead iodide (PbI2) (purity ≥ 99.999%), methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) (purity ≥ 99%), titanium isopropoxide, titanium dioxide (TiO2) paste, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) (purity ≥ 99.5%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium (purity ≥ 99%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (purity ≥ 98%) were obtained from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd. Au particles (purity ≥ 99.999%) were provided by Beijing Zhongnuo New Materials Co., Ltd. All solvents and 4-aminobenzoic acid (purity ≥ 99%) were got from J&K Scientific, Ltd (China) unless indicated. All the chemicals were directly used without further purification.


FTO substrate was firstly etched using 2 M HCl solution and then cleaned subsequently with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol by using ultrasonication for 20 min, respectively. The clean FTO substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 15 min before use. Titanium isopropoxide (738 μL), HCl (2 M, 70 μL) and isopropanol (10 mL) were mixed and stirred to prepare the precursor of compact TiO2 (cTiO2) layers. The solution was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s and then baked at 500 °C for 60 min. A mesoporous TiO2 (mTiO2) layer was then deposited by spin-coating the TiO2 paste (mixed with ethanol at 1:4 mass ratio) at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 550 °C for 30 min. The TiO2-coated FTO substrate was immersed into the 0.2 mM solution of 4-aminobenzoic acid in ethanol for 24 h to introduce a self-assembly monolayer (SAM) on the titania surface. Then the film was rinsed adequately in ethanol and dried under a flow of N2. The mesoporous TiO2 films with or without modification were infiltrated with PbI2 by spin-coating a hot PbI2 solution (stirred at 70 °C, 462 mg mL−1 in N,N-dimethylformamide) at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Subsequently, CH3NH3I solution (stirred at room temperature, 40 mg mL−1 in isopropanol) was immediately spin-coated onto the as-prepared PbI2 layer at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Then the perovskite film was formed by annealing on a hotplate at 100 °C for about 5 min. Above the perovskite film is a hole transport layer which was made by spin-coating the stock solution of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorebe (spiro-OMeTAD) (72.3 mg), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LI-TFSI) (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile, 17.5 μL) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (28.8 μL) in 1 mL chlorobenzene at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Au electrode with the thickness of 80 nm was thermally deposited in vacuum to form the cathode.


Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were performed on Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer with a wavenumber resolution of 8 cm−1 in the range 400–4000 cm−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired using a PHI 5300 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (250 W, 14 kV). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples were measured on a Horiba FluoroMax®-4 spectrofluorometer. Contact angle measurements were performed on a Solon SL150 contact angle goniometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern data for 2θ values were collected with a Bruker AX D8 Advance diffractometer with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on a JEOL JSM-6701F field-emission SEM at an accelerating voltage of up to 30 kV.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) data were acquired with a Keithley 2400 source-meter unit. The light J–V curves were measured under illumination with a Newport-Oriel (Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator, 94043A) AM 1.5G light source operating at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Oriel reference cell (91150 V) and verified with a NREL calibrated, filtered silicon diode (Hamamatsu, S1787-04). The active area as defined shadow mask is ∼0.04 cm2. For the electrical measurement, the J–V curves were obtained in the air through reverse (1.2 V → −1.2 V) or forward scan (−1.2 V → 1.2 V) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.

Fig. 1 shows the schematic structure of mesoporous perovskite solar cell. FTO acts as the electron collecting electrode and the Au as the hole collecting electrode. The device employs TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD as electron and hole transport materials, respectively. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited onto the compact titania layer to enhance carrier transport. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was prepared using two-step process. A thin PABA interfacial modification layer was inserted between the mesoporous TiO2 surface and the perovskite. The possible connective mechanism may be that the carboxylate oxygen atoms on PABA molecule are reacted with the metal ions of TiO2 to form carboxylate–metal bonds. The –NH2 group of the PABA is expected to be incorporated into the surface of PbI2 layers in order to anchor the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.

FTIR spectrum was measured to specify the formation of the PABA-SAM monolayer as shown in Fig. 2(a). On the curve of TiO2/PABA sample, the peaks below 1000 cm−1 correspond to the absorption of TiO2. The newly appeared absorption peaks at 1628 cm−1 and 1408 cm−1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric vibration of CO of the carboxylate group bonded to TiO2, respectively. The frequency difference between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations (Δ = 1628 cm−1 − 1408 cm−1 = 220 cm−1) suggests that the binding mode of PABA on the TiO2 surface belongs to monodentate linkage, as shown in Fig. 1(b). A broad peak in the 3200–3600 cm−1 region can be attributed to –OH of the unbonded carboxyl group and the –NH2 group. The peak at 2338 cm−1 belongs to the vibration absorption of CO2. Owing to the low amount of adsorbed self-assembly PABA monolayer, some relatively weak characteristic peaks cannot be seen clearly. Furthermore, XPS measurement was also carried out to detect the PABA molecules, as shown in Fig. 2(b). In contrast to TiO2, TiO2/PABA shows a binding energy at 399 eV which is attributed to N 1s of the –NH2 group on the PABA molecule. These results indicated that the PABA SAM was successfully introduced onto the TiO2 surface.

As well-known, the charge traps and defects, greatly related to the crystallinity and grain size, are generally observed in the perovskite films. The photoluminescence (PL) technique is one of the effective methods to examine such charge trap states. In our studies, the photoluminescence spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films on bare TiO2 and PABA-modified TiO2 substrates were excited at 450 nm, as displayed in Fig. 3. Both two films display PL emission at around 775 nm. However, the perovskite film which was formed on modified TiO2 substrate exhibits relatively stronger intensity than that grown on bare TiO2. The increased PL intensity of the sample with PABA-monolayer modification can be attributed to the reduced traps and defects in the perovskite crystalline structure. The decreased traps and defects inhibit the electron and hole recombination to some extent. The lower traps and defects of the perovskite grown on the modified TiO2 were due to the increased crystallinity which is verified from XRD in the following section.


The formation of perovskite film is known to be sensitive to the surface properties of the substrates. So we investigated the hydrophilic nature of TiO2 surface before and after modification. The contact angles of three individual TiO2 and PABA-modified TiO2 film samples are listed in Table 1, respectively. The average contact angles of water on the TiO2 layer decrease from 39.1° to 21.9° after PABA modification, suggesting the greatly improved wetting property, which is beneficial for the growth of perovskite crystals.

For highly efficient perovskite solar cell, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with good crystalline properties is very important. In order to investigate the influence of PABA modification on the crystallinity of perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured and the result was shown in Fig. 4. The peaks at 14.15°, 28.38°, 31.84°, 40.57°, 43.23° are assigned to (110), (220), (310), (224) and (314) crystal planes of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure, respectively, which are consistent with the literature report. It can be seen that CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite grown on the PABA-monolayer treated TiO2 substrate exhibits notably enhanced diffraction peak intensity, especially the peak at 14.15° (110), which indicates increased crystallinity with fewer low-dimensional defects. This can be explained by that the inserted PABA molecule increased the miscibility between inorganic metal oxide and perovskite through passivating the surface of TiO2, thus leading to favourable growth of CH3NH3PbI3. Furthermore, the peak at 14.15° (110) reflection shows especially strong intensity which indicates an increase of the preferential orientation of the perovskite crystals. The enhanced crystalline intensity with PABA modification would improve the device performance of PSC, which will be discussed below. In addition, the peak at 12.61° is ascribed to the (001) diffraction of residual PbI2 crystals, indicating the incomplete conversion to perovskite, which is inevitable in two-step procedure.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of PABA SAM on the morphology of perovskite films which was characterized by field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals grown on PABA modified TiO2 substrate are relatively larger than the sample without SAM modification, which are beneficial for charge transport in perovskite film. The SEM images can directly indicate that the TiO2 surface covered with PABA interfacial layer would favour the growth of perovskite crystal.


To examine the effect of PABA self-assembled monolayer on perovskite device performance, current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics are measured. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of the optimal devices with forward and reverse scan directions under AM 1.5G sunlight irradiation and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best perovskite solar cell without modification under reverse scan exhibits a short-circuit current density of 20.07 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.51, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.63%. In contrast, after PABA modification, the best device exhibits a PCE of 10.58% with Jsc of 22.29 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 V and FF of 0.52, which is superior to the performance of the former. In addition, the standard errors of photovoltaic performance with more than eight individual cells were listed in Table S1 to demonstrate the reproducibility of perovskite device.

In our work, according to the above experimental results, the improved efficiency mainly results from the increased value of Jsc (from 20.07 to 22.29 mA cm−2). Such increased Jsc can be attributed to the reduced traps and improved morphology of the perovskite film after PABA modification. In addition, as the function of PABA which modified TiO2 in the hybrid TiO2/P3HT photovoltaic cell, the PABA SAM works similarly (as shown in Fig. 1(b)), that is, the bonding of PABA SAM onto the TiO2 surface can induce the dipole moment directing from the TiO2 to perovskite, thus leading to enhanced charge transport over the interface. It comes to conclusion that the performance enhancement in the work is explained by the mechanisms (a), (b) and (c).

In this work, we have investigated the performance of perovskite solar cells through inserting a self-assembled monolayer 4-aminobenzoic acid between mesoporous TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3. The existence of PABA monolayer is characterized by using FTIR and XPS measurements. The surface of TiO2 with modification shows good wetting property, benefiting the compatibility between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2. The insertion of PABA monolayer results in the reduced traps and defects of the crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. After PABA modification, the perovskite also presents the enhanced crystallinity compared with CH3NH3PbI3 grown above the unmodified TiO2. The FTO/TiO2/PABA monolayer/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au device displays a highest efficiency of 10.58% which was higher than the solar cell without interfacial modification (9.63%). The interfacial modification can be used as a facile and effective method to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.
