Platinum complex was introduced in low ratios (0, 1, 1.5, and 5 mol%) as the third monomer in the conjugated backbone of well-known donor polymer PTB7-Th using a random terpolymer molecular design approach. All polymers showed similar absorption behavior and comparable HOMO/LUMO energy levels due to the small amount of Pt complex used. When blended with PC71BM in polymer solar cells, the power conversion efficiency was enhanced to 8.45% (obtained by the device based on PTB7-ThPt1.5 containing 1.5 mol% Pt) compared with 7.92% for the control PTB7-Th. Notably, the apparently low molecular weight of PTB7-ThPt1.5 (Mn/Mw: 46/70 kg mol−1) compared with that of PTB7-Th (Mn/Mw: 62/97 kg mol−1) ensured a more convincing comparison. Using a combination of physical measurements, such as optoelectrical characterization, grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS), and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence, the efficiency enhancement was contributed by the higher hole mobility, less bimolecular recombination, and a more efficient slow charge separation process.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention as a potential photovoltaic technology due to their simple fabrication, low cost, light weight, flexibility, and large-area mass production. Donor–acceptor-type conjugated copolymers utilizing the electron push–pull concept, which consist of alternating linked electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units along the polymer chain, have attracted much attention in high-performance BHJ PSCs. Their solubility, film-forming properties, absorption range, bandgaps, HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and charge transport properties can be facially tuned by reasonable molecular design with the appropriate combination of donor and acceptor structural units. Although a huge number of donor and acceptor units have been reported, only a few D–A alternating copolymers have exhibited power conversion efficiencies over 9% in polymer/fullerene or polymer/polymer single junction photovoltaic devices. The further development of new D–A alternating copolymers appears to be restricted by the challenging multi-step syntheses used for new donor or acceptor units, which may lead to higher costs and are not suitable for large-scale production.

Recently, a new structural design strategy of random terpolymers has been found to be an effective approach for designing new conjugated polymer materials. Unlike conventional D–A alternating copolymers, terpolymers comprise three different monomeric units as repeating groups in the conjugated polymer backbone. Judicious selection of the newly involved third monomer plays a key role in fine-tuning the physical and optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. Normally, two architectures employed for random terpolymers are D1–A–D2–A, by utilizing two donor units for copolymerization with one acceptor unit, and A1–D–A2–D, using two acceptor units and one donor unit. For example, in our previous work, replacing 25 mol% of expensive acceptor monomer 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate with a 34-fold cheaper bithiophene monomer as the third donor in well-known D–A conjugated copolymer PTB7-Th. This afforded a new terpolymer, PTB7-Th-T2, that exhibited a PCE of 8.19%, which was slightly higher than that of control PTB7-Th (7.89%) under the same device fabrication conditions. Using two electron-deficient 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole-based monomers and one electron-rich benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-containing monomer to form the random terpolymer, the PCE of the polymer/PC71BM BHJ device was increased from 4.9% (Th00) and 6.9% (Th100) with the two alternating copolymers, to 8.0% for terpolymer Th25.
Few random terpolymers with PCE values over 8% have been successfully obtained. To date, the reported third monomers, classified either as electron-donating (D) or accepting (A) units for terpolymers, have mostly been pure organic components. However, other third monomers, such as organometallic complexes, have scarcely been applied in random terpolymers for high efficiency BHJ PSCs. Representative examples are limited to zinc porphyrin derivatives, which were incorporated into the D–A conjugated backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) containing PBT-DPP or difluorobenzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole-based PTh4FBT, and a cyclometalated heavy metal iridium complex linked to the PTB7 polymer backbone through an ancillary ligand.
In this work, we adopted the terpolymer approach by embedding a heavy metal Pt complex at various low ratios into the famous donor polymer PTB7-Th using the cyclometalated main ligand. Using 1.5 mol% PyTPAPtacac as the third monomer for random polymerization, Pt containing PTB7-ThPt1.5 exhibited the best PCE of polymer/PC71BM blended BHJ devices. Under the same device fabrication condition, an increased PCE with an average value of 8.25% was obtained for PTB7-ThPt1.5 compared with 7.81% for PTB7-Th. In particular, the molecular weight of PTB7-ThPt1.5 (Mn/Mw: 46/70 kg mol−1) was much lower than that of control PTB7-Th (Mn/Mw: 62/97 kg mol−1), which further indicated the successful terpolymer strategy for enhancing PCE by introducing extremely low ratios of Pt complexes as the third monomer. Through optical and electrical investigations, the positive effect could be ascribed to a higher hole mobility, reduced bimolecular recombination, and more efficient slow charge separation process.

As shown in Scheme 1, all terpolymers were feasibly synthesized via random Stille coupling polycondensation among the three monomer compounds, 2-ethylhexyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate, (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane), and dBrTPAPyPtacac. Synthetic details are provided in the Experimental section. For comparison, Pt-free control polymer PTB7-Th was also prepared. The as-synthesized Pt-containing terpolymers PTB7-ThPtx (x = 1, 1.5, and 5, Scheme 1) were named according to the monomer feed ratio of the Pt complex (1, 1.5, and 5 mol%) for polymerization. It should be noted that the real Pt content in the final terpolymer was slightly lower than that of the corresponding feed ratio. No meaningful information was obtained regarding the Pt content, except in PTB7-ThPt5 with a feed ratio as high as 5 mol%, which was similar to literature reports. However, the Pt element in PTB7-ThPt1 and PTB7-ThPt1.5 was traced using plasma emission spectrometry. The Pt loading for PTB7-ThPt5, measured using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), was 0.74 ± 0.11 wt%, which was lower than theoretical 1.07 wt% loading. Owing to the planar configuration of the cyclometalated Pt complex, TPAPyPtacac was embedded into the polymer backbone through two phenyl rings in the triphenylamine (TPA) of the cyclometalated main ligand. This was different from our previous work with polyhedral (dfppy)2Ir(dbm) complex linked through dibenzoylmethane (dbm) ancillary ligand to the PTB7 chain for maintaining the linear structures of the conjugated polymer backbone.

The polymer structures were characterized by a combination of 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, which were in good agreement with the predicted values. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of each polymer was measured using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at 120 °C using polystyrene as standard. PTB7-ThPt1 containing only 1 mol% of Pt monomer showed a comparable molecular weight to the control Pt-free PTB7-Th, as shown in Table 1, with the Mn/Mw estimated to be 57/114 and 62/97 kg mol−1, respectively. Further increasing the Pt monomer ratio to 1.5 and 5 mol% gradually reduced the molecular weight, with PTB7-ThPt1.5 and PTB7-ThPt5 found to have Mn/Mw values of 46/70 and 26/40 kg mol−1, respectively.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers. From the TGA curves in Fig. S1, the Pt-based terpolymers exhibited good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) in the range 372–382 °C (Table 1), which was comparable to the 370 °C reported for Pt-free copolymer PTB7-Th, and the literature reported values of ∼383 °C.

UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Pt-containing terpolymers and the control PTB7-Th in dilute CHCl3 solution and the thin-film state are shown in Fig. 1, with their absorption properties summarized in Table 1. The maximum absorption peaks in the solid film were slightly red-shifted compared with in solution. All polymers exhibited similar absorption behavior in the range 300–800 nm. The short wavelength absorption bands (300–400 nm) were attributed to the π–π* transitions within the aromatic monomer, while the long wavelength absorption bands (>500 nm) were originated from intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions between the electron donating and accepting segments. As the real Pt content in terpolymers was even lower than the dBrTPAPyPtacac monomer ratio for polymerization, the absorption features of the Pt complex were negligible due to the extremely low content. However, the absorption bands at ∼300 nm, which were partially assigned to the triphenylamine-centered n–π* transition for polymer PTB7-ThPt5, exhibited the highest intensity, indicating the highest content of cyclometalated TPA-containing Pt complex. Almost identical optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.53–1.56 eV were calculated for all polymers from the corresponding absorption edge at film state. Furthermore, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2) for different polymers were determined from −5.29 to −5.39 eV and −3.42 to −3.50 eV (Table 1), respectively, suggesting little difference in the energy levels (<0.1 eV) by incorporating small amounts of Pt complex.


To investigate the influence of chemically embedded Pt complex as a donor polymer on the photovoltaic performance, BHJ polymer solar cells with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor polymer PTB7-ThPtx:PC71BM/PDIN/Al were fabricated, where poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and PDIN was used as the anode and cathode interface materials, respectively. The active layer comprising the optimized donor at an acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w) was spin-coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution containing 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. The photovoltaic performance, including current density–voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, is shown in Fig. 3, with the corresponding key device data summarized in Table 2 using an average of over 18 devices. As shown, the control PTB7-Th-based device exhibited an overall average PCE of 7.81%, with a maximum value of 7.92%, with a corresponding open-circuit voltage (VOC), short current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of 0.81 V, 14.98 mA cm−2, and 0.65, respectively. By increasing the third monomer ratio of Pt complex from 0 to 1.5 mol% in terpolymers, the average device PCE increased from 7.81% to 8.25%. PTB7-ThPt1 containing a 1 mol% Pt monomer ratio exhibited a comparable molecular weight and increased PCE relative to the control Pt-free PTB7-Th-based device, with a maximum PCE value of 8.31%. The highest PCE of 8.45% was obtained for the PTB7-ThPt1.5-based device, with corresponding VOC, JSC, and FF values of 0.80 V, 16.21 mA cm−2, and 0.65, respectively. Notably, the molecular weight (both Mn and Mw) of terpolymer PTB7-ThPt1.5 (Mn/Mw: 46/70 kg mol−1) was significantly lower than that of the control copolymer PTB7-Th (Mn/Mw: 62/97 kg mol−1). It has been widely reported that a higher PCE can be achieved at higher polymer molecular weights. Therefore, the increased PCE of PTB7-ThPt1.5 compared with the control PTB7-Th in this work indicated that the terpolymer approach of introducing an extremely low ratio of heavy metal Pt complex as the third monomer was successful. However, further increasing the Pt monomer content to 5 mol% caused the PCE to drop significantly to an average value of 7.11%, as demonstrated by the lowest JSC of only 13.50 mA cm−2. This might be ascribed to introducing too much of the poor charge transport Pt complex as the third monomer, which dramatically reduced the polymer molecular weight and charge transport properties of the polymer.

Fig. 3b shows the EQE curves for PTB7-ThPtx (x = 0, 1, 1.5, and 5) based photovoltaic devices to verify the measured JSC values. All devices showed a broad and strong absorption in the range 350–750 nm. The maximum EQE approached 72% at ∼630 nm for the PTB7-ThPt1.5 device. In the range 600–750 nm, the EQE for devices using PTB7-ThPt1.5 containing 1.5 mol% Pt complex as the donor material exhibited the highest values, followed by 1 mol% Pt complex-based PTB7-ThPt1, control PTB7-Th, and 5 mol% Pt complex-based PTB7-ThPt5. The measured JSC values of the BHJ PSC devices were well-matched with the values calculated from integrating the EQE curves (within 5% error), which confirmed the accuracy of the measured PCE.
Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) of the polymer/PC71BM blended films was carried out to investigate possible structural changes in the series of Pt complex-containing terpolymers compared with the control PTB7-Th. The two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding scattering profiles in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions for representative blended samples with or without Pt content are shown in Fig. 4. At first glance, no significant differences were found among the pattern properties for all samples, with similar peaks becoming clearer in the 1D profile either in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, which originated from the extremely low ratio of Pt complex in the PTB7-Th polymer backbone. However, after further careful observation, the pattern intensities for the broad peak at q ≈ 1.37 Å−1, which corresponded to the aggregation of PC71BM, gradually reduced with increasing Pt content in the polymer backbone, with PTB7-ThPt5/PC71BM blends containing 5 mol% Pt exhibiting the lowest intensity, indicating the least aggregation of PC71BM. In contrast, the arc-like scattering arising from Bragg diffraction with qy ≈ 0.33 Å−1 corresponded to (100) lamellar stacking of the series polymer of PTB7-Th and PTB7-ThPtx. Similarly, PTB7-ThPt5/PC71BM blends displayed the lowest intensity, indicating reduced lamellar stacking. Meanwhile, as previously reported, the intensity of the (010) face-on π–π stacking peak with qz ≈ 1.6 Å−1 for PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends was significantly weaker than that of pure PTB7-Th film due to PC71BM destroying the crystallinity of PTB7-Th. Furthermore, the introduction of Pt complex into the terpolymers further reduced the originally weakened π–π stacking peak in PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends, with this peak even disappearing in the PTB7-ThPt5-based film, indicating the poorest molecular packing in the donor polymer, which was attributed to it having the lowest molecular weight and the introduction of excess Pt complex. It is suggested that the conjugation of a third monomer to PTB7-Th destroyed the essential symmetry and integrity of the polymer backbone, leading to slightly reduced molecular stacking of the donor polymers and the aggregation of PC71BM.
To give more insight into the enhanced PCE resulting from the terpolymer approach using the Pt complex, the hole mobilities of the active layers for the PTB7-ThPtx/PC71BM blends were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Au. As shown in Fig. 5a, the hole transport mobilities (μh) of the PTB7-Th and PTB7-ThPtx/PC71BM (x = 1, 1.5 and 5) blends were estimated to be 1.36 × 10−3, 2.68 × 10−3, 5.3 × 10−3, and 4.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PTB7-ThPt1.5 blends, containing 1.5 mol% Pt complex, showed the highest hole mobility, followed by PTB7-ThPt1 and PTB7-Th. PTB7-ThPt5, which had the highest Pt content and the lowest molecular weight, demonstrated the poorest charge transport properties. These trends in hole mobility for the polymer/PC71BM blends were in good agreement with the PCE values of the BHJ PSCs.
We further studied the light intensity (P) dependencies on the short-circuit current density (JSC) to determine non-geminate recombination losses in the devices. Generally, the relationship between JSC and light intensity follows the formula JSC ∝ PS. If all free carriers were swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, S should be equal to 1, while S < 1 indicated some extent of bimolecular recombination. The S values calculated from the JSC–P curves in Fig. 5b for the series polymer PTB7-Th and PTB7-ThPtx/PC71BM (x = 1, 1.5 and 5) blended BHJ devices were determined to be 0.947, 0.944, 0.990, and 0.975, respectively. The value of the PTB7-ThPt1.5-containing device was the closest to 1, indicating more efficient carrier transport and largely suppressed bimolecular recombination, which was in good agreement with its highest PCE values.
To further investigate the influence of the Pt complex on the PCE of polymer/fullerene BHJ PSCs, picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) was conducted to compare the PL decay dynamics (Fig. 6). Ultrafast coherent long-range charge separation and the slower charge separation process via multiple hopping steps between localized states due to morphology and disorder have been reported to determine the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices. All PL dynamics exhibited biexponential decay. The fast picosecond decay channel was similar for all blends, and might result from the dissociation of charge-transfer state excitons at the polymer/fullerene D–A interface, while the longer decay channel of several hundred picoseconds was possibly due to the effective radiative lifetime of PC71BM. Compared with the control polymer PTB7-Th, the relative contribution of the slow decay process (>40 ps) was enhanced for terpolymer PTB7-ThPt1 and PTB7-ThPt1.5 blends, with specific performance presented at the reduced PL intensity at longer picosecond time, which might be explained by a reduced average PC71BM domain size that would allow more singlet excitons to reach the heterointerface during migration. This more efficient slow charge separation process is beneficial for photovoltaic device performance. However, the PTB7-ThPt5/PC71BM blends exhibited the slowest longer PL decay, which suggested it had the poorest slow charge separation process. As demonstrated by the GIWAXS study, PC71BM aggregation was mostly reduced, and the somewhat amorphous state of PC71BM in PTB7-ThPt5/PC71BM blends greatly reduced the singlet exciton transport.


1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 using tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. The molecular weight of the polymers was estimated by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 120 °C with polystyrenes as the internal standards. UV-Visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2500 recording spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were carried out using F-4600 Fluorescence spectrophotometer. The amount of Pt (in wt%) was measured and analyzed by EDS using a scattering electron microscope (JSM-7600, Japan). Plasma emission spectrometry was conducted using a PerkinElmer Optical Emission Spectrometer Optima 7000 DV. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CHI voltammetric analyzer, in a 0.1 mol L−1 solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile, at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The conventional three-electrode configuration consisted of a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl wire pseudo-reference electrode with ferrocenium–ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) as the internal standard (vacuum energy level, −4.8 eV). HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the equations EHOMO = −(Eonset (ox) + 4.8) eV, and ELUMO = −(Eonset (red) + 4.8) eV, respectively. All solutions were deoxygenated by bubbling with nitrogen gas for a few minutes prior to electrochemical measurements.

PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer/PDIN/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide and PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate). PDIN serves as a cathode interlayer and can lower the work function of the electrode, allowing metals with higher work functions (such as Al) to act as the cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was deposited by spin-coating on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass using a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron PVP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 4000 rpm and subsequently dried at 150 °C for 15 min in air. The device was then transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active blend layer of the polymer and fullerene derivative was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer with the ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w) in o-dichlorobenzene. The PTB7-ThIrx/PC71BM blended active layer was formed by spin coating with o-DCB solution containing 10 mg mL−1 of polymer and 15 mg mL−1 of PC71BM. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the o-DCB solutions in a 3% volume ratio and stirred before use. A solution (total of 25 mg mL−1) of polymer/PC71BM blends was subsequently spin-coated (1000 rpm) on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (approx. 100 nm thick). The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured using a Proflometer (Ambios Tech. XP-2). The methanol solution (containing 0.2% acetic acid) of PDIN at a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, affording a PDIN layer approx. 14 nm thick. An aluminum (approx. 100 nm) layer was subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the PDIN layer under vacuum (approx. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4.7 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source-Measure Unit. Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator (model, Newport 94023A) with a 450 W xenon lamp, and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. IPCE was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, Taiwan). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.


GIWAXS measurements were carried out using the SAXS/WAXS beamline of the Australian Synchotron. The substrates were cleaned silicon wafers and the polymer films were spin-coated using the same preparation method as for the device active layer. Samples were analyzed using an X-ray energy of 11 keV and incident angles ranging from Ω = 0.02–0.35 in 0.005 increments, which allowed signal optimization near the critical angle of the polymer film, but below the critical angle of the substrate. Data from GIWAXS experiments were analyzed using a customized version of NIKA 2D based in IgorPro software.


Hole mobility was measured using the space–charge limited current (SCLC) method. The device structures were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au for hole-only devices. SCLC mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation
where
J is the current density, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer material (usually 2–4 for organic semiconductors, with a relative dielectric constant of 4 used herein), ε0 is the permittivity of empty space, μ is the hole or electron mobility, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the internal voltage in the device, calculated using V = Vapp − Vbi, where Vapp is the voltage applied to the device, and Vbi is the built-in voltage resulting from the relative work function difference between the two electrodes (in hole-only and electron-only devices, Vbi values are 0.2 V and 0 V, respectively).


For time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, the laser source was a Coherent Libra regenerative amplifier (50 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) seeded by a Coherent Vitesse oscillator (50 fs, 80 MHz). Laser pulses with an 800 nm wavelength were produced by the regenerative amplifier, while 400 nm wavelength laser pulses were obtained with a BBO doubling crystal. The laser pulses (400 nm, circular spot, 2 mm diameter) were directed at the films. Emissions from the samples were collected at a backscattering angle of 150° by a pair of lenses into an Optronis Optoscope streak camera system with an ultimate temporal resolution of ∼10 ps.


In conclusion, we have introduced a heavy metal Pt complex in various low ratios (0, 1, 1.5, and 5 mol%) as the third monomer for polymerization through a cyclometalated main ligand. The PTB7-ThPt1.5-based BHJ PSCs containing 1.5 mol% Pt exhibited an enhanced PCE of 8.45% compared with that of the control copolymer PTB7-Th (7.92%) even with a much lower molecular weight. Increasing the Pt content to 5 mol% reduced the polymer molecular weight, decreased polymer packing, and greatly reduced the aggregation of PC71BM, resulting in reduced charge transport and a lower final PCE of the photovoltaic device. Through a combination of physical investigations, the improved PCE of PTB7-ThPt1.5 was ascribed to comprehensive impact factors, such as higher hole mobility, less bimolecular recombination, and a more efficient slow charge separation process. Our work demonstrated the feasibility of using the terpolymer approach to increase the PCE of polymer solar cells by introducing heavy metal complexes as the third monomer to existing highly efficient conjugated photovoltaic polymers.
