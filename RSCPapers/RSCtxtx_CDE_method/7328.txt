Target-tilted room temperature sputtering of aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) provides transparent conducting electrodes with sheet resistances of <10 Ω □−1 and average transmittance in the visible region of up to 84%. The properties of the AZO electrode are found to be strongly dependent on the target-tilting angle and film thickness. The AZO electrodes showed comparable performance to commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. OPV devices containing a bulk heterojunction active layer comprised of poly(3-n-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and an AZO transparent conducting electrode had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 2.5% with those containing ITO giving a PCE of 2.6%. These results demonstrate that AZO films are a good alternative to ITO for transparent conducting electrodes.

The development of alternative transparent conducting electrodes to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) is necessary to meet the rapid developments in organic optoelectronics including application in solar cells and light-emitting diodes, and the predicted future scarcity of indium. The bench mark for any new electrode is the performance of commercial ITO (UV-visible transmission (T) > 80% & sheet resistance (Rsh) <20 Ω □−1) with an added requirement of room-temperature processing. However, it is important to note that glass, which is the most widely used substrate, has ∼9–10% loss in UV-visible transmission due to Fresnel reflection (air–glass interface) and absorption losses. Thus electrodes on glass should have a maximum transmission of around 90% in the visible region (400–800 nm) unless they also form an anti-reflection coating. Surprisingly, there are reports in which transparent conducting electrodes have optical transmittances of >90%. Such reports must be viewed with caution since the electrode materials in question have refractive indices greater than glass and hence do not form anti-reflection coatings.

Evolving strategies for ITO electrode replacement include: oxide based sandwich structures with metallic mid layers; carbon, metal nanowire networks; binary or ternary oxides; and graphene. The main contribution to transmission loss (absorption) in transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrodes are the dopants in the host oxide matrices, oxygen vacancies, interstitial defects, and free carriers [e.g., aluminium in zinc oxide for aluminium zinc oxide (AZO)]. Recently, Kim et al. reported the increase in optical transmission through defect passivation in AZO by co-doping fluorine (F) and hydrogen (H). This led to better performing organic photovoltaic (OPV) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices compared to conventional ITO-electrode controls. The underlying principle of increasing the transmission was the replacement of oxygen sites with other anions in the valence band of the host oxide to improve the carrier mobilty and optical transmittance without disturbing the carrier concentration in the conduction band. However, first-principle calculations on the F doped ZnO system reveal that these dopants cannot be activated at room temperature, and therefore the electrodes were prepared at 150 °C and annealed at 300 °C post deposition. Thus, a room temperature method for fabricating TCO electrodes with optoelectronic properties equivalent or superior to ITO is still a challenge.
AZO continues to be a system of considerable interest due to the abundance of aluminium and zinc relative to indium. Approaches to the preparation of AZO electrodes have included solution and vacuum deposition methods. For example, preparation of AZO by aqueous solution processing has been reported by Hagendorfer et al. The AZO electrodes formed had a thickness of 2 μm, and a sheet resistance in the range 25 to 40 Ω □−1, and transmission of 75% to 85%. They achieved these optoelectronic characteristics by activating the dopants with UV light at ∼80 °C. Another promising technique for AZO deposition is pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The advantage of PLD lies in the creation of a very dense plasma by interaction of a high energy pulsed laser beam with the target material leading to denser, higher mobility films. Using PLD Franklin et al. reported the best sheet resistance for AZO electrodes thus far (17 Ω □−1) and T ∼75–85%. The films had a thickness of 620–680 nm and were deposited at 150 °C. Although the PLD method can give AZO with good optoelectronic properties, it is not easily scaled for large area deposition and the films often contain particulates, which can lead to shorting of devices.
Recently, facing target sputtering (FTS), in which two targets are facing each other in the sputtering chamber and the substrate is situated in a plane perpendicular (above or below) to the targets, has been used to deposit TCOs. The advantage of this technique is that by keeping the targets face-to-face, a dense plasma can be created while at the same time bombardment of the substrate by the high energy plasma species is reduced. This method thus has the potential to enable electrode fabrication at low temperatures with good optoelectronic properties as the carrier mobility is improved due to the high density of the plasma. Using FTS Jeong et al. reported room temperature deposited AZO on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with a sheet resistance of 45 ± 9 Ω □−1 and a transmission of 85% for a 300 nm thick film. Additionally, an AZO electrode was reported by Jung et al. that had a sheet resistance of 30 Ω □−1 and a transmission of 90% in the visible region. The film was again grown by FTS at room temperature but in this case it was deposited on polycarbonate (PC) and was 300 nm thick. However, while the optical properties of these materials were acceptable, the sheet resistances were still higher than that of commercial ITO. Furthermore, FTS systems have a high material wastage which needs to be improved to reduce target consumption.
In this manuscript we report AZO electrodes deposited at room temperature with very low sheet resistance (<10 Ω □−1) and high average transmission (>80%, in the visible region). To the best of our knowledge, this is the best sheet resistance and transmittance combination for room temperature grown AZO thus far. The optimised AZO electrodes were achieved by controlling the target tilt with respect to the plane of the substrate while depositing the films. Furthermore, we show that OPV devices incorporating these electrodes exhibited comparable performance to that obtained using commercial ITO.

The AZO electrodes were prepared using an AJA International magnetron sputtering system. The sputtering target used for the deposition was a 4′′ diameter circular ceramic target [ZnO (99.999%) doped with 2 wt% Al2O3 (99.99%)] purchased from AJA international, USA. In situ glass substrate (Cat-I Glass, Illinois, USA) cleaning was done in an argon plasma (30 mTorr, 70 Watt radio frequency) for 5 min prior to the AZO electrode deposition. The base pressure in the chamber was kept at 1 × 10−7 Torr. The distance between the substrate and the target was 15 cm and the substrate-holder was rotated at a constant speed of 20 rpm during sputtering. No external substrate heating was used for the electrode deposition during or post deposition. Deposition was carried out at 1 mTorr of argon pressure (based on studies reported by Treharne et al.,) and with a 200 Watt radio frequency power supply. The thickness of the electrodes was measured in two ways: in situ quartz crystal monitor (in-built with the AJA sputtering system), and ellipsometry after deposition.

A variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam WASE VB-400) was used to analyze thicknesses, refractive index, and extinction coefficients of the electrodes. Tauc–Lorentz and Drude dispersion models are applied to fit the psi/delta ellipsometry data for extracting the optical constants. A mean square error (MSE) of <5 with the fitting models implies that the extracted fitting parameters are accurate. A UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrophotometer (Cary 5000) was used to measure the optical transmission of the films which was corrected for the substrate (glass) absorption/reflection losses (∼9–10%). The mean, maximum and minimum values of transmission were calculated for the visible wavelength range 400 nm to 800 nm. The sheet resistance was measured using a KeithLink probe-measurement setup [Keithley (Model No: 2100) 6-1/2 digital measurement multimeter]. Carrier type and concentration, mobility and conductivity were measured using an Ecopia HMS-3000 Hall measurement system (0.56 Tesla magnetic field strength) in a van der Pauw geometry at room-temperature. Gold paste (99.999% purity) was used to make 4 contacts on the electrode edges so that the contact resistances could be neglected. The Ohmic behavior of the Au contact to the AZO electrodes was confirmed prior to the Hall measurements by observation of the linear variation in the I–V curves. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the AZO films were collected on a Bruker Advance D8 X-ray Diffractometer equipped with a LynxEye detector, Cu tube (Cu Kα = 1.5418 Å) and operated at 40 kV with a 2θ scan range of 20–80°. The surface morphology, cross-sectional images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were performed using a Jeol JSM-7100F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with an accelerating voltage of 1 keV. The surface roughness of the films was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Asylum research MFP 3D) in contact mode.

The optical field distributions and short circuit current under AM1.5G solar illumination were modeled using a Matlab code developed by Burkhard et al. based on a transfer matrix method described by Pettersson et al. For these simulations optical constants (refractive index and extinction coefficients) of all the materials in the structure are required (Fig. S2, ESI). Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements of AZO on silicon wafers were performed to determine the optical constants of the AZO films.


Pre-patterned ITO substrates (Xinyan Technology Ltd) were prepared for device fabrication using a multi-step cleaning process. First, the substrates were washed with Alconox in de-ionized water, rubbing with a lint free swab. The substrates were then rinsed several times with de-ionized water and ultra-sonicated in the same for 5 minutes. This was followed by consecutive ultra-sonication in acetone and 2-propanol for 10 minutes each. The substrates were dried using a nitrogen gun. 10 nm of MoOx (Sigma Aldrich) was deposited using a vacuum thermal evaporator at a base pressure of ∼10−6 mbar onto the cleaned ITO and AZO electrodes. For the photoactive layer, a blend of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) was prepared by mixing equal amounts of individual solutions of P3HT (Merck, w = 94 kDa, PDI = 1.9) and PCBM (American Dye Source) in dichlorobenzene (DCB) (anhydrous grade). Both individual solutions had a concentration of 30 mg (mL)−1. The P3HT:PCBM solution was then filtered (0.22 μm PTFE filter, Membrane Solutions) and spin-coated (500 rpm for 3 s, then 1400 rpm for 17 s) on top of AZO/MoOx or ITO/MoOx. The films were then annealed on a hot plate at 60 °C for 20 minutes. Finally, 100 nm of Al was deposited using a thermal evaporator at a pressure of ∼10−6 mbar to complete the device structure. The devices had an active area of 0.2 cm2, which was defined using a shadow mask. Post fabrication, the devices were annealed on a hot plate for 2 minutes at 180 °C.


The device characteristics were tested using an Abet Triple-A (Abet Technologies) solar simulator as the light source. The solar mismatch of the xenon lamp (550 W Oriel) spectrum was minimized using an AM1.5G filter. The light intensity of ≈100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G was calibrated using a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) certified standard silicon photodiode (2 cm−2), with a KG5 filter. A Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit was used for the current density–voltage (JV) measurements. JV characteristics were measured for at least five devices in each category. A PV Measurement, Inc QEX7 setup, which was calibrated with an NREL certified photodiode and operated without white light bias and chopped and locked in the small perturbation limit, was used for recording the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the best devices in each category. The average of difference between short circuit current density from JV measurements and integrated current density from IPCE was within 10%.

All fabrication steps and testing of devices were done in a class 1000 cleanroom. Except for cleaning of the ITO substrates, all other steps of device fabrication and testing were done in an inert environment (MBraun glove box, O2 < 0.1 ppm; H2O < 0.1 ppm). The evaporations were done using a thermal evaporator integral to the glove box.

The development of the room temperature sputter deposited AZO electrodes was performed in two stages. First, the target-tilt angle was optimized to achieve the best combination of sheet resistance and transmittance, and then second, using the best target-tilt angle the optoelectronic properties were fine-tuned by varying the thickness of the AZO films. To reiterate, it is important to note that all the electrodes used in this study were prepared at room-temperature without using any heat treatment during deposition, such as substrate-heating, or thermal annealing post deposition. A schematic of the target–substrate geometry is shown in Fig. 1a, demonstrating the target tilt angles with respect to substrate plane and plasma profile distribution.


When the target tilt was varied from 16.2° to 38.8° the deposition rate of AZO was found to increase linearly from 2.4 to 4.8 nm min−1 with a constant target-sputtering power, which indicates significant changes in the density of the incoming plasma from the AZO target onto the substrate. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of these films, as shown in Fig. 1c, it can be seen that the films had a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. The film growth had a preferential c-axis orientation along the (002) plane perpendicular to the substrate, with values of 2θ that are lower than the ZnO bulk (002) diffraction line at 34.5°. The lower 2θ values for the AZO films are a result of intrinsic stress developed at the glass–AZO film interface during the sputtering process. For cases of films on glass (h/H ≪ 1, where H and h are substrate and film thicknesses, respectively), the intrinsic stress is mainly due to the non-equilibrium film-growth conditions and not due to temperature or lattice mismatch. In general, any redistribution of matter on the substrate will result in film stress, since the film is constrained by the substrate. In addition, for films grown from the Al-doped zinc oxide ceramic targets used in this work, Al3+ incorporation into the film should not be neglected since it also influences the crystal lattice constant and therefore changes 2θ. From Fig. 1c it can be seen that the aluminium ion (Al3+) concentration in the resultant AZO films increases with increasing target tilt angle (from 16.2° to 38.8°) as a result of the increase in the deposition rate. If the Al3+ (52 pm ionic radius) ions present in the film completely replaced the Zn2+ (72 pm) sites, the resultant AZO crystal lattice constants would be expected to be reduced leading to a smaller interplanar spacing and, according to Bragg's law, 2θ should shift to higher values. However, this is not seen in the AZO films shown in Fig. 1c and due to the fact that the AZO films grown at room temperature do not have sufficient activation energy for the Al3+ to replace the Zn2+ in the lattice but instead the Al3+ cations reside in the films as interstitial ions. Therefore, the lower 2θ values observed for the AZO films formed with increasing tilting angles signifies that the stress was caused predominantly by the interstitial Al3+ and not interstitial Zn2+ or oxygen vacancies.

We further investigated the stress in the films using a biaxial strain model, with the estimated stress developed in the plane of the AZO film shown in Table 1.

Negative values of stress correspond to compressive stress and positive values correspond to tensile stress in the film. The AZO films prepared at different target tilting angles showed compressive stress except for the films prepared at an angle of 20.8° (Table 1). The difference for the case of the 20.8° films is mainly due to the relatively high film thickness (362 nm), which may be larger than the critical thickness where compressive stress converts to tensile stress due to the crystal coalescence. The greater film thickness of the AZO deposited with a tilting angle of 20.8° is also evident in the higher peak intensity value in the XRD spectra (Table 1) compared to all other films. Typical behaviour of the average film stress as a function of film thickness shows a transition from compressive to tensile and then to relaxed states. Tensile stress is seen in AZO films with higher thickness (>400 nm) and this will be further discussed later. Fig. 1b shows optical transmission spectra of AZO films versus variation in the target tilt angle. The wavelength position of the interference fringes for each of the films is due to the different optical thicknesses of the AZO.
The transmission spectra and electrical parameters for the AZO films formed using different target tilt angles are shown in Fig. 1b and Table 1, respectively. Hall-effect measurements showed n-type conductivity for all the films. The carrier (electrons) concentration of the films was found to decrease with increasing target-tilt angle and it is not surprising that the optical band gap also followed the same trend. Band-gap variation with respect to the carrier density is very well understood for doped semiconductors, and arises mainly from band gap renormalisation effects above the Mott critical carrier density limit, which is 3.68 × 1018 cm−3 in the case of ZnO. The carrier concentration of all the AZO films in this study showed values above the Mott limit (Table 1) and there is an increase in electron carrier concentration in the AZO films with a decrease in the target tilting angle. In the AZO of this work, the increase in electron carrier concentration can be correlated to the amount of donors: oxygen vacancies (predominantly), and Al3+ and Zn2+ interstitials present inside the films.
Similar to the trend for carrier concentration, the Hall-mobility also increased with the decrease in target tilt angle. It is well known that the mobility of carriers in TCOs is mainly related to macroscopic (grain boundaries, surface roughness) and microscopic (ionized donors, neutral impurities) imperfections in the films. For the AZO films the decrease in mobility with increased target tilt angles can be directly correlated to both the stress (estimated from the XRD data as discussed earlier) and surface roughness. Surface roughness values for AZO films extracted from modelling of thickness data showed increased roughness with larger target tilt angles (Table S2, ESI). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the AZO films formed using different target tilt angles are shown in Fig. 2.
The combined effect of increased carrier concentration and mobility values with a smaller target tilt angle resulted in a major improvement in the sheet resistances, which decreased from 544 to 25 Ω □−1. These results are consistent with earlier reports by Treharne et al. where the sheet resistance and Hall-mobility improved with smaller target tilt angles. However, in the work by Treharne et al. the electrodes were deposited at 150 °C to achieve a low sheet resistance.
From the preceding discussion it can be clearly seen that the target tilt angle is a first order parameter for the preparation of AZO films by sputtering. Improved optoelectronic properties are observed at lower target tilts, e.g., AZO deposited with a tilt angle of 16.2° had a sheet resistance of 25 Ω □−1. However, we found that using such a small target tilt angle gave rise to large variations in the sheet resistances across a film due to film non-uniformity. To this end we found that a target tilt angle of 20.8° gave sufficient uniformity and appropriate sheet resistance and therefore this was chosen as the optimized target-tilt angle for the film thickness studies.

The sheet resistance, Rsh, of a film is inversely proportional to the film thickness (t) and is given by , where ρ and σ are the resistivity and conductivity of the film, respectively. Therefore, it would be expected that a thicker AZO film would give a lower sheet resistance. On the other hand, a thicker coating also implies less transparency according to the equation, T = e−αt, where T is the optical transmission and α is the optical absorption coefficient. The two parameters, T and σ, are dependent on carrier concentration. Decreased T is expected for increased carrier concentration where the main contributors are Al3+ dopants in the lattice, and Al3+ and Zn2+ interstitials. However, for the AZO grown at room temperature the main electron donor contribution comes from oxygen vacancies and therefore importantly the optical absorption is less sensitive to film thickness. In Table 1, a 362 nm thick AZO film deposited with a target tilt of 20.8° resulted in sheet resistance of 40 Ω □−1. Upon increasing the thickness of the AZO film we found it was possible to reduce the sheet resistance to below 10 Ω □−1 (Table 2) without significant loss of optical transmission (Fig. 3).

Variation in the AZO thickness from 400 nm to 1000 nm resulted in a change in the sheet resistance from 30 to 8 Ω □−1 with only a 4% drop in the mean transmission in the visible spectral region (84% to 80%). The electrical parameters from Hall-effect measurements are given in Table 2 and to our knowledge these are the best optoelectronic parameter combinations yet reported (sheet resistance and optical transmission) for the room-temperature grown AZO electrodes.
The improved sheet resistance with increased thickness of the electrode as shown in Table 2 does not have a significant influence on carrier density and mobility once the films are thicker than 500 nm. This arises from the fact that there is insignificant variation in average crystallite size (Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI), calculated from the XRD study) and also comparable grain size features (see the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images, Fig. 4) for the AZO films of different thicknesses.
The carrier densities across each of the films were essentially the same (of order of 1020 cm−3) indicative of similar deposition conditions in all cases. Tanaka et al. observed the same saturation behavior in the electrical properties for thicker AZO films prepared by PLD.

A convenient and accepted tool to compare the optoelectronic properties of transparent conducting electrodes is using a figure of merit (FOM). FOMs (ϕJ) for the AZO electrodes were calculated using the equation defined by Jain et al.:

(1)
where
σ is the DC electrical conductivity, α is the optical absorption co-efficient, Rsh is the sheet resistance, T is the optical transmission and R is the reflection of the TC electrode. R can be neglected as a variable since all oxide transparent electrodes have similar reflection coefficients across the visible region and eqn (1) reduces to:

(2)
 Normally, when calculating an FOM, the optical transmission at a single wavelength is used. For example, in the literature, the transmission at 550 nm (
T550) is often taken for this calculation, but depending on the application T550 is not always a good indicator of the ‘true’ transmission. For example, for the OPV devices of interest in this work neither a single wavelength nor a simple average of the transmission spectrum over a given range of wavelengths is suitable. For OPV applications it is best to weight the average of the transmission by the solar photon flux G(λ) in order to evaluate the relative quantity of solar photons that will pass through the electrode into the photoactive junction. The solar-weighted transmission (WT(λ)) is calculated using eqn (3), where G(λ) is the wavelength-dependent AM1.5G solar flux, T(λ) is the wavelength-dependent electrode transmission, and λ1 and λ2 are chosen to correspond to the spectral response of the OPV device. FOMs for the AZO electrodes calculated using eqn (2) and (3) are given in Table 2 for λ1 and λ2 of 350 nm and 800 nm, respectively. The FOM of the AZO electrodes were found to be sensitive to the sheet resistance, with the low sheet resistance AZO electrodes having higher FOMs than ITO.

Fig. 3b shows that the mean transmission in the visible region of AZO electrodes is better for thinner films. However, from Table 2, the sheet resistance of the electrodes is found to be superior with thicker AZO films. This trade-off between transmission and sheet resistance is very typical for transparent conducting thin films. To test the optoelectronic properties of the AZO electrodes (400–1000 nm in thickness) OPV devices using a bulk heterojunction blend of poly(3-n-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the active layer were fabricated. A schematic of device structure is shown in the inset of Fig. 5a.

To optimize the device efficiency, the OPV devices were modelled to achieve maximum short circuit current density (Jsc) by varying the thickness of the active layer. An optical-only model was used and the Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE) was assumed to be 100%. This does not affect the optimization process but over-estimates the current uniformly across the spectral response. Fig. 5a shows the short circuit current density for different thicknesses of P3HT:PCBM and AZO films. It was found that independent of the thickness of the AZO electrodes, the maximum Jsc was achieved with an ∼100 nm thick P3HT:PCBM active layer. Modelled absorption profiles for devices with a 100 nm thick P3HT:PCBM layer are shown in Fig. 5b. The number of fringes in the absorption spectra increases with increasing thickness of the AZO layer as the number of optical cavity modes increases for devices with thicker electrodes. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best OPV devices with optimized P3HT:PCBM active layer thickness for each AZO thickness are shown in Fig. 5c. The highest and averages of efficiency, Jsc, open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) for each set of devices are given in Table 3. For comparison, data for an optimized OPV device on commercial ITO are also included.

From Fig. 5c, it is seen that the J–V curves of devices for all AZO thicknesses are similar. This is also seen in the averages of the performance parameters given in Table 3. Efficiency, Jsc, Voc and FF remain the same within error (standard deviations) across all thicknesses of the AZO electrodes. The reduction in average optical transmittance, (Fig. 3b) with higher AZO electrode thickness is compensated by improved electrical properties (Table 2), and therefore, the efficiency remains essentially the same up to an AZO thickness of 1000 nm. The efficiency of the best OPV devices with an AZO electrode reached ∼98% of the best efficiency of the reference ITO device and ∼94% on average. The slightly better efficiency of the ITO device mainly arises from a higher Jsc. The other critical parameters (Voc, FF) are very similar between the AZO and ITO based devices (Table 3). The higher Jsc of the ITO device is easily explained by the broader and slightly higher incident photon quantum yield (IPCE – or External Quantum Efficiency) profile of ITO devices as shown in Fig. 5d. The IPCE spectrum for ITO is higher at lower wavelengths relative to the AZO electrodes, as expected, because the band gap of ITO is ∼3.5 eV (350 nm) whereas AZO has a band gap of ∼3.1 eV (400 nm) as shown in (Fig. 3a). The Jsc calculated by integrating the convolution of the IPCE and AM 1.5 solar spectrum showed ∼10% higher Jsc for ITO devices compared to AZO devices, which agrees closely with the difference in the Jsc measured under white light (Table 3, ∼9% difference in Jsc between ITO and AZO 500 nm based devices). This observation validates our solar cell measurements.

The target tilt angle has been identified as an important parameter to achieve state-of-the-art optoelectronic properties of AZO TCO electrodes deposited by the industrially viable magnetron sputtering technique. By varying the target tilt angle the best yet reported optical–electrical combination properties for AZO electrodes has been achieved. The room temperature deposited AZO electrodes had Rsh reduced from 30 to 8 Ω □−1 as the thickness was increased from 400 nm to 1000 nm, with only a 4% drop in the transmission (84% to 80%) in the visible region. Futhermore, application of the AZO electrodes in OPV devices successfully demonstrated that their performance is comparable to devices that use commerical ITO. These results demonstrate the applicability of room temperature grown AZO electrodes as an alternative to ITO in organic optoelectronic device applications.
