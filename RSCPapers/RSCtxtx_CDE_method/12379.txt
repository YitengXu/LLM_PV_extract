In this paper, we successfully synthesized anatase TiO2 hierarchical microspheres (S0), anatase TiO2 sub-micro hollow mesospheres (S50), anatase TiO2 single crystal hollow nanoparticles (S100), nanoparticles (S250) and (S500) by using different amounts of hydrofluoric acid (HF) versus titanium n-tetrabutoxide (TBT) and acetic acid (AcOH). The structure and morphology of the as-prepared materials were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The DSSCs (dye-sensitized solar cells) based on anatase single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (S100) as a photoanode showed an efficient power conversion efficiency of 8.94% along with a current density of 17.39 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 778 mV, which is higher than the DSSCs based on S0 (8.10%), S50 (8.57%), S250 (7.25%) and S500 (6.12%). The high performance of S100 as a DSSC is attributed to their hollow structure which might help to harvest more light, higher light scattering and trapping abilities and comparatively higher surface area. Therefore, we can expect that our materials are promising for assembling superior photoelectrodes for future preparation of highly-efficient DSSCs and may lead to applications for energy storage, water splitting, catalysis, and gas sensing.

As devices used for harvesting favorable and clean energy, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become a hot topic of great interest since Grätzel's pioneering work in 1991. An efficiency of 13% for dye-sensitized solar cells has been achieved very recently, which make them nearly able to be produced commercially. During their power generation process, light energy is harvested by the organic dye molecules which are adsorbed on the surface of a titanium dioxide (TiO2) photoanode, resulting in the production of electrons that are inserted into and drawn out from the network of TiO2. A redox couple (usually iodide/triiodide) in the form of an electrolyte solution regenerates the charged dye molecules, while electrons from the external circuit then reduce the iodide ions at the platinum counter electrode.

The properties of DSSCs, such as recombination, light collection, electron transport and dye-loading which highly depend on the crystal size and shape of anatase TiO2 nanomaterials, have received keen interest and play a tremendous role in improving the performance of DSSCs. Nanoparticles (NPs) having large sizes have a lower surface area but a higher light scattering ability and a longer electron diffusion length, while smaller NPs have poor light scattering capacity and shorter electron diffusion length but a larger surface area. For example, it was concluded by Cao et al. that samples with diameters of 20 nm and 10 nm were showing worse performance than the sample having a diameter of 15 nm. Similar results were found by Yang et al. about nanorods that are 17 nm wide and 120 nm long, which were showing better results than 15 nm wide and 50 nm long and 25 nm wide and 150 nm long nanorods. Therefore, for efficient absorption of light and light-scattering capability, the size, shape and surface area should be studied in-depth for nanomaterials.
In order to solve these problems, the focus of the researchers turned toward synthesizing materials with high light scattering and low recombination abilities, such as nanofibers, hierarchical structural materials, core/shell materials, and micro-sized particles. Among them, the hollow structures have drawn much attention because of their high specific surface areas, low density and relatively good performance in photovoltaic devices. Although many efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of TiO2 hollow spheres, hollow nanotubes and hollow boxes, to the best of our knowledge, single crystal hollow nanoparticles have not been discussed systematically due to their unique growth procedures.
Herein, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we synthesize novel anatase TiO2 hollow single crystal nanoparticles in the range of 20–60 nm with a controlled crystal structure, along with anatase TiO2 hierarchical microspheres and sub-micro hollow mesospheres by simply controlling the reaction conditions, combined with calcination. Subsequently, the obtained samples were fabricated to make photoanodes for DSSCs. Due to their hollow structure that may help to trap more light, high surface area for anchoring large amounts of dye molecules and higher light scattering and harvesting abilities, a clear improvement in Jsc and power conversion efficiency was observed for the hollow single crystal nanoparticle (S100)-based film compared to its other counterparts.

Fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO, ∼7 ohms per square, 2.2 mm thick) glasses were bought from Pilkington. Titanium n-tetrabutoxide (TBT, 99%), ethanol (99.7%), titanium tetrachloride (99.0%), tert-butyl alcohol (99.5%), iodine (I2, 99.99%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99.99%), 4-tertbutylpyridine (4-TBP, 96%), 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII, 98%), and ethyl cellulose were purchased from Aladdin. Valeronitrile (99%) and acetonitrile (99.8%) were from Alfa Aesar. Acetic acid (AcOH, 99%), hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40% v/v) and terpineol were obtained from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory. Guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN, 99.0%) was bought from Aldrich and N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate) was purchased from Solaronix. All of these chemicals and solvents were used as received without any extra refinement.


Materials with diverse morphologies were synthesized through a facile, template-free, one-step modified hydrothermal method. Typically, 1.5 mL of TBT was added slowly into 35 mL of AcOH to form a white solution via vigorous magnetic stirring, followed by dropping different amounts of HF (0 μL for S0, 50 μL for S50, 100 μL for S100, 250 μL for S250 and 500 μL for S500). After keeping under continuous stirring for 30 minutes, the above mixture was subsequently transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed and kept in an oven at 120–220 °C for 1–24 h. Then, the products were collected as a white powder by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and finally dried at 80 °C overnight. In order to get a highly crystalline and pure anatase TiO2 phase, all powders were calcined for 3 h at 500 °C.


Various composite pastes were prepared by following the doctor-blade method as described below. In detail, 1.0 g of each sample powder, 10 mL of ethanol, 0.4 g of ethyl of cellulose, 3.0 g of terpineol and 0.2 mL of AcOH were homogeneously mixed. After grinding for 45 minutes and dispersing via ultrasonic treatment for 15 minutes, viscous TiO2 pastes were obtained. Before washing with acetone, ethanol and water for 15 minutes each, FTO glasses were cut into 2.5 × 1.5 cm pieces and finally dried under an argon gas flow. To prepare the DSSC photoanodes, the FTO plates were coated with a layer of TiO2 paste. The coated electrodes were heated in an air atmosphere sequentially at 125 °C for 15 min, at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min in a muffle furnace. The thickness of the films was controlled by the concentrations of TiO2 pastes and the number of printing. Prior to the fabrication of the DSSCs, the electrodes were submerged into a 40 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 minutes at 70 °C, then washed thoroughly with ethanol and water, followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 minutes. After cooling down naturally, TiO2 films were sensitized by soaking in a 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in tert-butanol/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) for 16 h. Finally, the sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes were rinsed with acetonitrile to remove the physically adsorbed dye molecules.


A solution of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in terpineol was coated on a well-cleaned FTO glass and then heated for 30 minutes at 420 °C to prepare a Pt-based counter electrode. After that, the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode was buckled on the Pt-coated counter electrode in a sandwiched form to fabricate a DSSC. The electrolyte used in this study was based on I−/I3−, consisting of 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.5 M 4-TBP and 0.1 M GuSCN in a solution of valeronitrile/acetonitrile (volume ratio is 15:85). The active cell area is 0.16 cm2.


The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, in the range of 10° to 80° in 2θ, were obtained with a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15408 nm) operated at 200 mA and 50 kV. The structural and morphological features of the as-prepared materials were studied with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta, operated at 20 kV) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010, operated at 200 kV). A D-100 profilometer (KLA-Tencor) was used to measure the thickness of the coated TiO2 films. The amount of adsorbed dye on the photoanodes was determined by desorbing the dye from the composites into a 0.1 M NaOH solution, and measuring the absorption spectra of the resulting solution using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2500). The same instrument (Shimadzu, UV-2500) was also used for the measurement of diffuse reflectance spectra. The transmittance spectra were obtained by using an Enlitech's QE-R system based on an integrating sphere. A Keithley model 2400, equipped with a digital source meter and a solar light simulator (Oriel, model: 94041A), was used to measure the current–voltage properties of the DSSCs under illumination of a one Sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2). Prior to the measurements, the light intensity of the simulated incident light was calibrated to AM 1.5 G using a standard Si solar cell (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, USA). A wavelength range between 400 nm and 800 nm was used as a function in the Enlitech's QE-R system to obtain the EQE spectra of the DSSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on an Electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research, VerasSTAT 3-400) in the dark, with the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and an applied voltage of −0.7 V. Impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model with Z-view software. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was investigated on an Autosorb-iQ2-MP (Quanta chrome Instruments US). The intensity-modulated photocurrent spectra (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectra (IMVS) under the frequency range from 100 KHz to 0.1 Hz were obtained on an Electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner) equipped with a source supply (Zahner, PP211).



Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the TiOF2 precursor before and after calcination at different temperatures. The results indicate that all diffraction peaks of TiOF2 disappear and new diffraction peaks ascribed to the anatase TiO2 phase appear. It was found that the TiOF2 starts changing at around 300 °C, and completely turns into the TiO2 phase when the temperature reaches 500 °C. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared powders prepared with different amounts of HF and annealed at 500 °C for 3 hours. It can be seen that all the diffraction peaks are indexed perfectly to the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272), indicating that pure anatase TiO2 has been successfully synthesized by this facile and template-free hydrothermal method combined with a post calcination process. The XRD peaks of all samples are very sharp, proving all the samples are highly crystalline, which will eventually improve the photovoltaic performance. Meanwhile, the peaks become narrower with increasing hydrothermal temperature and reaction time, which suggests that raising the hydrothermal temperature and prolonging the reaction time are favorable for TiO2 crystal growth (Fig. S1).

The structural and morphological characteristics of the acquired TiO2 samples are shown in the form of SEM and TEM images. The morphology of the as-prepared TiO2 single crystal hollow nanoparticles (S100) can be seen in the SEM images in Fig. 2a and b and in the TEM images Fig. 2c and d, with the samples having a diameter varying from 20 to 25 nm. Looking carefully at the enlarged SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2b and d, respectively, box-like particles of nearly uniform sizes with compact and smooth surfaces can be observed. The hollow structure that enhances their light trapping properties can be confirmed from the TEM image (Fig. 2d), where we can clearly see the bright centres and dark edges of the particles. The cavity size in the box is around 10 nm. Further, it can be seen that these particles are monodisperse and arranged in the shape of a porous network without any agglomeration, which increase their surface area on one side and make them rough on the other side, which are beneficial to adsorb more dye, to allow free motion of the electrolytic solution and to increase their light scattering ability. Fig. S2 shows the SEM images of the powders (S100) obtained with different hydrothermal temperatures, while Fig. S3 shows the SEM and TEM images of the samples prepared with different hydrothermal times. It can be seen clearly that the crystal size of the particles increases with increasing temperature and reaction time that are absolutely in agreement with XRD results. To clearly observe the morphology and confirm the phase structure of the products, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) for selected samples was performed. The image (Fig. 2e) clearly shows the crystal planes of (011) and (002) with d-spacings of 0.352 and 0.475 nm, respectively, which indicates the high crystallinity of the hollow nanoparticles. The single-crystalline nature of the hollow nanoparticles can be confirmed from selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns as shown in Fig. 2f.

Fig. 3 shows SEM images of materials synthesized with different amounts of HF as a capping agent (S0, S50, S250 and S500, respectively). Without HF, hierarchical microspheres with a diameter of 3–5 μm and relatively uniform sizes, composed of well-defined nanosheets, forming a flower-like morphology, were formed (Fig. 3a). When 50 μL HF was added, the materials evolved to hollow spheres with a size of 500 nm, assembled with several hollow nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). However, the hollow spheres collapsed when more HF was used, resulting in the agglomeration of the nanoparticles, as seen in Fig. 3c and d. Hence, the material's morphologies and grain sizes are significantly dependent on the hydrothermal temperature, reaction time and HF concentration.

The hydrothermal preparation of TiOF2 at 160 °C in the presence of TBT, AcOH and HF is composed of several steps. In the start of the reaction, C4H9OH and unstable complexes of titanium acetate (CH3COO)xTi(OC4H9)4−x−yFy (eqn (1)) are formed. Subsequently, AcOH reacts with C4H9OH and, through a slow esterification reaction, water is released (eqn (2)). Then, the formation of TiOF2 occurs as a result of simultaneous hydrolysis and non-hydrolytic condensation reactions among the intermediate products, (eqn (3) and (4)).

Ti(OC4H9)4 + xCH3COOH + yHF → (CH3COO)xTi(OC4H9)4−x−yFy + (x + y)C4H9OH
(1)
C4H9OH + CH3COOH → CH3COOC4H9 + H2O
(2)
−TiF2 − OR + H2O → TiF2 − OH + ROH (R = C4H9 or CH3CO)
(3)
−TiF2 − OR′ + −TiF2 − OR′′ → 2TiOF2 + R′OR′′ (R′ = H or CH3CO; R′′ = H or C4H9)

A temperature-induced solid-phase oriented rearrangement process takes place when the TiOF2 precursor changes into anatase TiO2 hollow nanostructures. With increasing calcination temperature, the corners and edges of the TiOF2 cubes start transforming first due to the high surface energy. A thin layer of anatase TiO2 forms on the surface of the TiOF2 precursor as a result of this gradual transformation, followed by the conversion of more TiOF2 inside the cube into TiO2. As the reaction proceeds, the transfer of TiO2 from its high-density central area to the lower density outer shell occurs. Finally, all the TiOF2 precursors transform to anatase TiO2, resulting in the formation of hollow structures. It is revealed that the as-prepared TiOF2 precursor is converted to the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272) through an annealing process (see the XRD results in Fig. 1a).

In order to explore the photovoltaic performance of the synthesized anatase TiO2 materials as photoanodes for DSSCs, 18 μm thick electrodes of each sample were prepared and were tested under standard AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 4b shows the typical J–V (current density versus voltage) plot for concentration-based and Fig. S4a and c for temperature and time-dependent samples, respectively. In Tables 1, S1 and S2, all the obtained parameters related to photovoltaic performance, such as the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), comparative PCE and fill factor (FF), along with the adsorbed amount of dye, are listed. The DSSCs made of anatase single crystal hollow nanoparticles (S100) depict a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.94% which is ∼5% higher than S50 (8.57%), ∼11% than S0 (8.10%), ∼24% than S250 (7.25%) and ∼46% than S500 (6.12%). This improvement in PCE can be ascribed to a higher value of Jsc (17.39 mA cm−2 for S100) than 15.99 mA cm−2 for S50, 15.61 mA cm−2 for S0, 15.15 mA cm−2 for S250 and 11.72 mA cm−2 for S500, comparatively higher dye loading, and enlarged surface area (69.54 m2 g−1 for S100 against 63.89 m2 g−1 for S0 and 55.67 m2 g−1 for S50). Moreover, the higher Jsc for S100 can be because of the hollow structure of the particles and the inter-particle voids, which may help to harvest more light by efficient scattering and recollecting.

To know about the spectral responses of the synthesized materials, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured. The resulting spectra for different HF concentration-based samples are shown in Fig. 4c, different temperature-based samples in Fig. S4b and time-based samples in Fig. S4d. The results illustrated that S100-based DSSCs show an enhanced value of quantum efficiency at both long and short wavelengths compared to others. This enhanced light absorption of S100 can be attributed to their large surface area and better light scattering and harvesting effects. From these results, it can be assumed that our sample may be used for the full solar energy spectrum and that they are entirely consistent with the current density results. The somewhat decreased values of FF for all samples can be because of the film thickness (18 μm), which hinders the electrolyte/electrode interfacial interaction and produces a high number of defect states. On the other hand, a thicker TiO2 film can adsorb more amount of molecular dye, which can result in an increased amount of light harvesting. To quantitatively evaluate the quantities of loaded dye, a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution was prepared and all the samples were immersed into it to desorb the adsorbed molecules of dye. After calculating the concentrations from UV-vis absorbance measurements (Fig. S5), the data of the samples were summarized and are shown in Tables 1, S1 and S2.
Long-term stability is a serious problem for dye-sensitized solar cells. Therefore, we have inspected the stability of the S100-based DSSCs under accelerated testing in a solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2 intensity. Values for Voc, FF, Jsc and PCE were recorded for over 500 h (21 days). All parameters showed an enhancement during the initial 100 h, which may be due to the filling of electrolyte into the inner mesopores of TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5, on the whole duration (500 h) of the light soaking test, the Jsc and PCE have shown a decrease by about 14% and 22%, respectively, from their original values. In contrast to that, Voc and FF increased by 1% and 2%, respectively. The gradual decrease in efficiency was mainly correlated with the decline of Jsc. The small increase in Voc and FF can compensate the loss of Jsc to some extent but with a minor contribution, compared to the negative effect of Jsc. Still, this results in an almost constant efficiency during light soaking. As a consequence, the efficiency first increased before 100 h and then remained nearly constant for the remainder of the 500 h period.
To investigate the light-scattering efficiencies of the given photoanodes, diffuse reflectance of samples was measured. Fig. 6a illustrates that S100 showed higher light reflectance than S0, S250 and S500 but lesser than S50. The highest light reflectance of S50 might be due to its hollow structure and bigger size, which can reflect comparatively more light than that of smaller hollow particles. In addition, light reflectance of S100 prepared at 160 °C for 6 h is better than the other reaction conditions (Fig. S6a and c). As a whole, generation of robust optical confinements and greater light scattering occur. These can contribute to increase light harvesting efficiency and thus boost the photocurrent density of S100. Furthermore, transmittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out to know about the light trapping abilities of these films (18 μm thickness). As displayed in Fig. 6b, films made of S100 exhibit lesser transmittance than that of S0, S250 and S500 films but comparatively higher than S50, which was expected too. The higher light scattering and light trapping abilities of the S100 film are because of its hollow structure and average size (size dependent results can be seen in Fig. S6b and d for the samples of S100 obtained at different temperatures and for different times). Besides, the film consists of numerous void spaces among the particles which results in multi-reflection and thus trapping of more light than the others with solid structures.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis was done to understand the kinetics of the photoelectrochemical and electrochemical processes in DSSCs. The Nyquist plots of the cells made of the above-mentioned TiO2 are given in Fig. 7, S7a and S7b for concentration-, temperature- and time-dependent samples, respectively. The resistance values are summarized in Tables S3–S5. The smaller semicircles, in the high-frequency range, show the charge transfer resistance (R1) at the electrolyte/counter-electrode interface and the larger semicircles, in the lower frequency range, show the electron recombination resistance (R2) at the electrolyte/TiO2 photoanode interface. In the Nyquist plots, the larger radius of the bigger semicircles indicates slower charge recombination at the electrolyte/photoanode interfaces, which means the superior ability of the charge transport and longer electron lifetime. The R2 values drop considerably from 176.36 Ω for S50 to 152.09 Ω for S0, and then further decrease to 121.98 Ω, 83.97 Ω and 72.38 Ω for S500, S250 and S100-based DSSCs, respectively, showing a more rapid recombination rate within DSSCs fabricated with the latter photoanodes with nanomaterial structures. This is due to the enhanced surface area of nanomaterial films that provides more trapping sites in the redox electrolyte for charge recombination with I3−. The smallest value of R2 (72.38 Ω) for S100 cells can be mainly accredited to the high germination density of the hollow nanoparticles, which in turn offers a large number of interfaces among themselves, and thus producing frequent boundaries and defects for unpredicted charge recombination. The gradual decrease in the values of R2 (from 176.36 Ω to72.38 Ω) is in agreement with the continuous decline in Voc (from 796 to 778 mV), as shown in the J–V results.
Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were further used to investigate the possible dissimilarity in the electron transport time and charge recombination properties of the DSSCs based on S100 and other related photoanodes, under varying incident light intensities, which are supposed to directly affect the current density, open-circuit voltage and efficiency. The equation τd = 1/2πfd was used to calculate the transport time from IMPS and τr = 1/2πfr was used for the calculation of the recombination time from IMVS, where τd and τr show the electron transport time through the films of photoanodes and recombination with the electrolyte, respectively, while fd and fr represent their respective minimum frequencies.Fig. 8a and b illustrate the electron transport time (IMPS) and recombination times (IMVS), respectively, for the DSSCs made up of the aforementioned photoanodes as a function of light intensity. It was observed that as the light intensity increases, a decrease in the values of τd and τr occurs for all samples. A longer transport time (increased τd) and a faster recombination rate (decreased τr) were found for hollow nanoparticle-based devices (S100) than those of the other samples. Assuming that within S50, S0, S500, S250 and S100 the electron transfer pathway (ETP) is present, the S50 should possess the most direct ETP to facilitate electron transport. While for the S100, a long ETP is expected due to the smaller sizes of nanoparticles that create many boundaries, trapping sites, and defects that result in a complicated network and thus make it hard for injected electrons to reach the electrode. All these results are also absolutely consistent with EIS results.
As a whole, the increased value of the power conversion efficiency for DSSCs based on S100, compared to their S0-, S50-, S250- and S500-based films, can be attributed to their higher light scattering and trapping abilities that result in enhanced light utilization efficiency and light harvesting efficiency, which have been confirmed by the above given UV-vis diffuse reflectance and transmittance spectroscopy measurements. The synergistic effects of the greatly maximized surface area for anchoring massive quantities of dye molecules further support the increasing PCE. Consequently, the aforementioned anatase TiO2 single crystal hollow nanoparticles are excellent materials to be used as photoelectrodes in DSSCs.

In summary, single crystal hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (S100) were synthesized by using TBT, acetic acid and HF via a one-step, template free, facile hydrothermal method, combined with a calcination process. After comparing with the S0, S50, S250 and S500 based-photoanodes, DSSCs with S100 were found to have a higher power conversion efficiency of 8.94%, accompanied by a photocurrent density of 17.39 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 778 mV and an adsorbed dye amount of 127 nmol cm−2. These enhancements can be attributed to their hollow structures that may help to trap more light, to the comparatively higher surface area to adsorb more dye and to maximize the light harvesting efficiency, and a higher light scattering ability of about 93% at a wide range between 400 nm and 800 nm. Therefore, we believe that our synthesized materials with such parameters are extremely suitable for future preparation of highly-efficient DSSCs.
