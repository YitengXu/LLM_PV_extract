Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their combined advantages of high efficiency and good flexibility (bendability). Here, we address the latest technology and future prospects of flexible hybrid PSCs. Flexible PSCs consist of a flexible substrate, transparent electrode, electron (or hole) conductor, perovskite, hole (or electron) conductor, and electrode layer. Among these layers, the flexible substrate and transparent electrode are critical bottlenecks for achieving high efficiency and super flexibility, since flexible polymer substrates exhibit lower transmittance than rigid glass substrates due to a higher overall refractive index and an inherently brittle transparent conducting oxide (TCO). Therefore, we mention the research background of flexible PSCs in the introduction and review their technological advancement with regard to flexible substrates and transparent electrodes in the main text. In addition, we briefly discuss the upscaling issues and the material costs of flexible PSCs for their commercialization.

Ever since its commercialization, electricity has been the optimal and safe form of energy for powering commonly used electrical appliances such as TVs, refrigerators, lighting, computers and so on. In addition, solar energy is an abundant, clean, and sustainable source that can be converted to electricity through photovoltaic devices. As the 4th industrial revolution proceeds, the demand for distributed and independent power sources for smart phones, tablets, IoTs (Internet of Things), vehicles, and wearable devices has continued to grow at a rapid rate. Consequently, research studies on the development of flexible, foldable, and even stretchable solar cells have also surged, but are still several steps away from commercial application.

In particular, hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently gained great interest because of their unique properties such as a high absorption coefficient due to a direct bandgap, small exciton binding energy, formation of shallow traps due to ionic crystal characteristics, ambipolar charge transportability, convenient bandgap tunability through composition and structure modification, and low temperature solution processability. Ever since Kojima et al. reported liquid junction hybrid perovskite-sensitized solar cells, intensive studies have been performed and the certified record efficiency of a small device has increased to over 22% under 1 sun conditions (AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2). So far, the performance of most high-efficiency unit cells and modules has been demonstrated on rigid glass-based substrates.
One characteristic that largely distinguishes PSCs from the currently commonly employed silicon solar cells is their applicability as flexible (bendable) devices. The advantage of PSCs is that the perovskite thin-films can be deposited on flexible substrates at low/mild temperatures with relative ease through vapor deposition or solution processing, and simultaneously deliver a potentially high power conversion efficiency (PCE). This allows further fabrication upon the transparent polymer substrates, which suffer significant deformation above critical temperatures of 150–180 °C due to their inherently low glass transition temperatures. Alternatively, metal substrates and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) free substrates also show good agreement with perovskite materials in processing a flexible device.
Other challenges of importance that we discuss are the low performance of large PSC modules and the current absence of a large-scale manufacturing process, which are also active areas of ongoing research. Despite such challenges, flexible PSCs show promising potential for commercialization. Flexible conductive polymer films and metal substrates can theoretically be fabricated at a lower cost than their conductive glass counterparts. Thus, developing perovskite photovoltaic module technology may enable a massive volume and product throughput that can contribute to industrial cost savings by fast web-based roll-to-roll manufacturing. Additionally, in practice, the PCE of the flexible PSCs reported to date is much lower than that of glass-based PSCs. However, the PCE values reported so far can be considered very promising since they are significantly better than those of other new technologies such as organic photovoltaics and dye-sensitized solar cells, for which the highest PCEs range from 11 to 14%. In addition, curved cells showed a higher total electrical energy produced per unit of surface occupied, compared to flat cells. These results give rise to a wide array of applications for PSCs, including building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), vehicle integrated photovoltaics (VIPVs), and portable and wearable devices. In this review, we aim to provide insight into current progress in the development of flexible PSCs.

Recently, flexible PSCs have been rapidly gaining attention for research with regard to two major categories, distinguished by the use of either polymer film or metal foil as the substrate, and have demonstrated PCEs ranging from 2.6% to 18.3%. Here, light weight and flexibility are the key characteristics of interest where a bending radius down to millimeters is possible. These features offer an ideal choice for harvesting energy through portable devices as well as for applying an energy source to a curved surface, such as BIPVs or an energy source for solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Polymer films such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are widely used as transparent and lightweight substrates for photovoltaic applications. In order to function as transparent conductive electrode (TCE) substrates, the polymer substrates are coated with TCOs such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide or aluminium doped zinc oxide. The sheet resistance of the polymer/ITO substrate (10–15 Ω sq−1) is similar to that of the glass/TCO substrate (7–15 Ω sq−1) and the polymer/ITO substrate maintains fair transmittance in the visible spectrum. However, although polymer/ITO substrates display fair transparency and conductivity, the substrate may be damaged during the repeated bending process due to the brittle characteristic of ITO, hence increasing the substrate resistance and leading to the formation of cracks in the active layer. In addition, a low temperature manufacturing process must be developed (<150 °C) in order to fully employ PET or PEN films as a substrate.
On the other hand, metal substrates such as titanium and copper can bypass such limitations due to their physical and thermal durability. However, another problem emerges where metal substrates require a translucent top-contact because of their opacity. As such, choosing between polymer or metal substrates strongly affects the fabrication process for the device. Furthermore, flexible PSCs can be categorized as having normal (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) type structures, where n, i, and p represent the n-type electron conductor, intrinsic perovskite, and p-type hole conductor, respectively. For a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art technology, we will first discuss basic n–i–p and p–i–n type PSCs on polymer substrates, and then discuss additional topics involving metal substrates and TCO-free studies using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and carbon-based TCEs.

In a conventional n–i–p type PSC as shown in Fig. 1(a), the layer deposited on the TCO is denoted as the electron transport layer (ETL). Titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin dioxide (SnO2) are wide bandgap metal oxide semiconductors and ideal candidates for the ETL due to their appropriate energy levels. TiO2 and ZnO exhibit conduction bands at about 4–4.2 eV from the vacuum level, enabling efficient electron injection from the perovskite. Among the above candidates, the ZnO ETL was the first to be recognized as a potential substrate for flexible PSCs due to its low temperature processability.

Kumar et al. reported that the combined effects from a ZnO compact layer and ZnO nanorods produced a PET-based PSC with a low PCE of 2.6%, while emphasizing the success of low temperature deposition technology. Afterwards, Liu et al. performed ZnO thickness-control on a flexible CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) PSC to achieve a PCE of 10.2% at a ZnO thickness of 25 nm under 1 sun. In order to further improve the efficiency of ZnO ETL based flexible PSCs, ZnO sputtering on flexible ITO/willow glass substrates and antireflection coating on the backside were performed by Tavakoli et al., increasing the maximum PCE to 13.1% as shown in Fig. 1(b). Recently, Park et al. fabricated a MAPbI3 flexible PSC on a roll-to-roll (R2R) sputtered ITO film on a colorless polyimide (CPI) substrate (60 nm) to achieve 15.5% PCE as shown in Fig. 1(c). To date, the highest efficiency obtained for polymer substrate/ZnO ETL-based flexible PSCs was 15.6% as shown in Fig. 1(d). The high electron conductivity of ZnO provides a balance between the electron and hole fluxes within the device, and thus the device shows photovoltaic characteristics without J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and scan rate. However, ZnO is vulnerable to reaction with the perovskite layer due to its poor chemical stability, thus entailing the need to search for more suitable materials in order to improve long-term stability.
Recent research has been steered towards a method of depositing TiO2 compact layers at low/mild temperatures. A recent study by Giacomo et al. discussed using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to deposit a compact TiO2 layer at a mild temperature (150 °C) which showed excellent hole blocking, thus achieving an 8.4% PCE for a flexible PSC with a 250 nm thick TiO2 layer. Kim et al. achieved a PCE of over 12% by depositing compact TiOx layers with ALD at temperatures below 80 °C. Using another method, Qiu et al. developed a compact, pinhole-free TiO2 layer using an electron beam to achieve a PCE of 13.5% as shown in Fig. 1(e). Ameen et al. proposed a method which uses a metal sputtered Ti film (100 nm) as the compact layer within the PSC after oxidation in high temperature air to provide effective and improved charge extraction. Yang et al. achieved a 15.1% PCE for flexible PSCs by adopting amorphous TiO2 optimization, and using sputtering and vapor deposition techniques for the perovskite. These results suggest that the oxygen vacancies present in the amorphous film lead to deeper Fermi levels for the anatase counterpart and provide a beneficial effect in charge extraction. Very recently, Mali et al. fabricated an optimized flexible PSC with a 15.88% PCE by varying the TiO2 thickness via RF sputtering. Jeong et al. achieved a 16.01% PCE for flexible PSCs by depositing a compact Nb-doped TiO2 layer on a PEN substrate through UV treatment. To overcome the limitations on heat-sensitive substrates, Das et al. performed rapid photonic curing using infrared radiation and thus greatly improved the PCE from 1.8% to 8.1%. As photonic curing induces in situ crystallization/annealing, an alternative strategy is to crystallize the ETL material before deposition. Mixing TiO2 nanoparticles with a sol gel precursor and casting is an effective method for depositing a crystalline TiO2 layer at low temperatures. A flexible PSC manufactured by Dkhissi et al. using this method showed a PCE of 12.3%. Shin et al. fabricated a Zn2SnO4 ETL at low temperature (<100 °C) which showed excellent hole-blocking/electron-injection behaviour with a low refractive index, resulting in a 15.3% efficiency for flexible devices as shown in Fig. 1(f). This latter property reduces reflections at the ITO interface and increases light harvesting, thereby increasing short-circuit current density (Jsc). The flexible n–i–p type PSC results reported so far are summarized in Table 1.

The p–i–n structure of a PSC consists of a compact hole transport layer (HTL) on the TCO substrate as shown in Fig. 2(a). For this type of flexible PSC architecture, PEDOT:PSS is typically used as the HTL and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is used as the ETL, since both layers are easily treated in solution and do not require high temperature treatment.

Docampo et al. reported a PCE of 6.4% for a flexible PSC composed of PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/TiOx/Al as shown in Fig. 2(b). Roldán-Carmona et al. achieved a 1.04 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), 14.3 mA cm−2Jsc, 47% fill factor (FF), and 7% PCE by fabricating a flexible PSC composed of PET/Al doped zinc oxide (AZO)/Ag/AZO/PEDOT:PSS/poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (poly-TPD)/MAPbI3/PCBM/Au as shown in Fig. 2(c). You et al. improved the PCE to 9.2% by fabricating a PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/Al device structure. However, the efficiency was lower than that of the PSCs fabricated on a rigid glass/ITO substrate (11.5%). Chen et al. proposed an interesting method to integrate small amounts of NH4Cl in the perovskite solution to reduce the thermal budget. This method allowed room temperature crystallization of perovskite films with a 6.7% PCE on flexible substrates.
Furthermore, the PEDOT:PSS surface can be modified to improve charge extraction and efficiency. This modification may promote the growth of the perovskite, which grows directly on top of the HTL. For example, a self-assembled monolayer of 3-aminopropanoic acid (C3-SAM) on PEDOT:PSS induced a much smoother film compared to the original film, thereby resulting in a relative 20% increase in PCE as shown in Fig. 2(d). Recently, Zhang et al. produced a flexible PSC using ∼20 nm NiOx instead of PEDOT:PSS, mainly for use as the HTL as shown in Fig. 2(e). The structure of the PSC device in this study was PET/ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/C60/Bis-C60/Ag and showed a 14.53% PCE without hysteresis. It should be noted that the NiOx layer was deposited by spin coating without further thermal or UV treatment. They also demonstrated fairly good reproducibility of said device. Several researchers have focused on other materials such as surfactant modified C60 or TiOx to be used in the top interface to improve device performance.
Deposition of the ETL is also possible through thermal evaporation, as demonstrated by Chiang et al. In this case, PCBM showed more desirable properties than C60 as the ETL, and a bathocuproine (BCP) hole-blocking layer was deposited on the PCBM layer to further improve efficiency. However, while deposition via thermal evaporation is a widely used process for most flexible p–i–n type PSCs, it is incompatible with large-scale roll-to-roll production. Due to this limitation, other methods for improving flexible PSCs were actively sought. Recently, Heo et al. greatly improved the repeated bending stability of p–i–n type flexible PSCs by introducing poly([N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene bis-(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (PNDI-2T) polymeric electron transporting materials (ETM) into small molecule PCBM ETM and attained a 15.4% PCE. Bi et al. proposed a method for optimizing the morphology of the perovskite film on the PET/ITO substrate to improve flexible PSC performance. They improved the PCE to 18.1% on flexible PET/ITO substrates through compositional engineering and solvent annealing to form larger perovskite crystalline grains as shown in Fig. 2(f).
On the other hand, Luo et al. developed a new flexible counter electrode to replace the conventional metal electrode by fabricating a SnO2-coated cross-stacked super-aligned carbon nanotube (SnO2@CSCNT) counter electrode on a flexible PET substrate/NiO/Al2O3-perovskite. They achieved a 10.5% PCE for the flexible devices. They also found that the SnO2@CSCNT-based inverted PSC had a significantly improved stability than a standard inverted PSC with an Ag metal electrode. All the aforementioned results pertaining to the performance of flexible p–i–n type PSCs are summarized in Table 1.


In lieu of polymer substrates, metal substrates provide unique advantages such as high barrier properties, high conductivity, and the ability to withstand high temperature processing. However, in order to use a metal substrate, a flexible transparent conducting electrode (TCE) must be fabricated without damaging the perovskite layer.

Lee et al. fabricated a flexible PSC structure of Ti metal substrate/mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/ultra-thin Ag film as shown in Fig. 3(a). They suggested optimized conditions for using the semi-transparent Ag film as the top TCE and obtained a maximum PCE of 6.15% with a 12 nm-thick Ag transparent electrode. In addition, they also proposed a method of improving the efficiency by depositing ITO on the ultra-thin Ag top TCE. The optimized device structure was Ti substrate/blocking TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (1 nm-thickness)/ITO as shown in Fig. 3(b) and it exhibited a maximum PCE of 11.01%. The top electrode was fabricated by depositing a 1 nm-thick Ag layer on the spiro-OMeTAD HTL and subsequent deposition of ITO on the spiro-OMeTAD/Ag layer. The Ag/ITO provided excellent conductivity and high transmittance which significantly improved the PCE of Ti metal substrate-based flexible PSCs.
On the other hand, Troughton et al. formed a mp-Al2O3 insulating scaffold layer instead of a mp-TiO2 ETL and formed a flexible TCE by laminating a nickel metal mesh embedded in a PET substrate on Ti metal substrate/TiO2/mp-Al2O3/MAPbI3−xClx/spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS with a transparent conductive adhesive interlayer as shown in Fig. 3c. The TCE was made of nickel mesh embedded in a PET film, and covered with a pressure-sensitive adhesive mixture of PEDOT:PSS for conductivity and compatibility with PSCs. This simple lamination ensured excellent electrical contact for the fabricated device, and resulted in a 10.3% PCE. Wang et al. developed a TiO2 nanotube layer that can be used as a porous ETL by anodizing titanium foil. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used for the top electrode. They built a flexible PSC with an 8.3% PCE by fabricating the following structure: Ti electrode/TiO2 nanotube/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD + CNTs as shown in Fig. 3d. Furthermore, Xiao et al. increased the device efficiency by using TiO2 nanowire (NW) arrays and TiO2 nanoparticles within the ETL on the Ti foil. As a result, they achieved a PCE of 13.1%. Very recently, Heo et al. achieved a 15.0% PCE by laminating a Ti metal substrate/anodized TiO2/perovskite/poly-triarylamine (PTAA) with bi-layer graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) TCE as shown in Fig. 3(e).
Apart from using a titanium substrate, research studies focusing on copper foil substrates have also been conducted. Recently, Nejand et al. demonstrated low-cost PSCs using Cu foil instead of Ti foil as shown in Fig. 3(f). They constructed a flexible device of the structure Cu metal substrate/CuI/MAPbI3/ZnO/Ag NWs and achieved a 12.8% PCE. All the photovoltaic properties of metal-based flexible PSCs are summarized in Table 1.

During repeated bending tests on the TCO substrate (PET/ITO or PEN/ITO) of a flexible PSC device, its sheet resistance sharply increases due to the brittleness of the TCO layer, thus deteriorating the performance of the device. Hence, an interesting advancement of flexible PSCs was demonstrated through the fabrication of a TCO-free device, and brought forth the concept of super flexible PSCs. Dianetti et al. produced an inverted type PSC using a PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) TCE instead of an ITO TCE on a PET substrate as shown in Fig. 4(a). The best TCO-free flexible PSC exhibited a 0.75 V Voc, 15.8 mA cm−2Jsc, 41% FF, and 4.9% PCE. Although its PCE was relatively poor, the device exhibited super flexibility maintaining its original PCE value even after 100 bending cycles at radii down to 3 mm. This result is the first demonstration of the excellent mechanical stability of TCO-free substrate-based flexible PSCs. Park et al. used a Norland Optical Adhesive 63 (NOA63) substrate to fabricate a device capable of recovering to its original shape even after the complete wrinkling of the PSC as shown in Fig. 4(b). They achieved a PCE of 10.8% using a PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) TCE on the flexible NOA 63 substrate. Jeon et al. fabricated nitric acid treated single-walled carbon nanotubes as the TCE on a PET substrate by a direct- and dry-transfer technique as shown in Fig. 4(c) and achieved a 5.38% PCE. Zhang et al. used nitric acid treated PEDOT:PSS as both the cathode and anode TCE for tandem solar cells and also obtained a 10.3% PCE for TCO-free flexible PSCs.

Subsequent research studies have recently reported on the performance of two-dimensional graphene as the TCE for PSCs composed of carbon materials. Graphene electrodes are formidable candidates as TCEs for flexible PSCs because of their capability of rendering an entire surface pinhole-free, as opposed to Ag NWs, metal meshes, and CNTs, and also because they demonstrate high transmittance of visible light, excellent flexibility, and excellent chemical stability. Yoon et al. reported a 16.8% PCE with an inverted type TCO-free flexible PSC using a molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) doped single layer graphene/PEN substrate, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Their flexible devices were shown to retain more than 90% of the initial PCE after 1000 repeated bending cycles and 85% even after 5000 bending cycles, with a radius of curvature of 2 mm. Recently, Heo et al. reported a highly flexible, high-performance PSC with an adhesion promoted AuCl3-doped graphene TCE as shown in Fig. 4(e). Notably, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was coated between the PET flexible substrate and the graphene TCE to form covalent bonds, minimizing damage to the graphene electrode even after repeated bending. As a result, the flexible FAPbI3−xBrx PSC based on the PET/APTES/AuCl3-graphene substrate showed a maximum PCE of 17.9% with excellent bending stability, retaining more than 77% of its original PCE after 1000 outer bending cycles at a radius of curvature of 4 mm. Afterwards, Heo et al. further improved the efficiency to 18.3% by using bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (TFSA)-doped graphene as the TCE for a flexible PSC as shown in Fig. 4(f). Unlike the MoO3 and AuCl3 p-type dopants, the TFSA dopant does not exhibit absorption in the visible light region and so they could improve the Jsc of the flexible PSC. This device also exhibited great bending stabilities as it retained ∼85% of its original PCE after 5000 bending cycles at a radius of curvature of 12 mm. The photovoltaic properties of TCO-free flexible PSCs are summarized in Table 1.

Most flexible PSCs reported so far have only been produced as small-area devices. However, there have also been reports on flexible large-area modules. When upscaling from small-area devices to large modules, the following requirements must be met: the development of (i) large area coating techniques, (ii) patterned deposition or post patterning processes, and (iii) optimized cell and interconnect design. Large area flexible modules were first demonstrated by Giacomo et al. using an n–i–p type mesoporous architecture. In the fabrication of efficient large modules, they incorporated slightly altered techniques such as laser patterning for the precise etching of the ITO, careful ALD of the compact TiO2 layer, and UV-treated screen printing of the mesoporous layer. Subsequent procedures closely mirrored that of small device fabrication. As a result, they achieved up to 3.1% PCE on 5.6 × 5.6 cm PET substrates. Meanwhile, Hwang et al. focused on slot die coating as a large-area fabrication method, and introduced the concept of flexible module fabrication through roll to roll (R2R) processing as shown in Fig. 5(a). On a 100 cm2 substrate as shown in Fig. 5(b), the module was reported to output a very low efficiency. Alternatively, Hu et al. recently created a module of 6 small-scale PSC devices and achieved a high average PCE of 12.32% using twenty-four active areas of 1.01 cm2 each. With this module, they successfully demonstrated a wearable module while simultaneously charging electronic devices under irradiation. However, the performance of large scale flexible PSCs is still vastly inferior to that of rigid devices, as can be seen by the 18.84% average PCE for a rigid substrate based module of the same design reported by Hu et al. Other methods of large-scale fabrication have also been suggested, albeit not yet fully explored. For example, Yang et al. discussed the feasibility of the blade-coating technique under ambient conditions in the fabrication of large-area perovskites. Schmidt et al. also investigated the R2R processing of large-area devices with an inverted structure and a printed back electrode. As a result, their large-area flexible PSC device exhibited a PCE below 5%. To date, the highest certified efficiency of a flexible perovskite single-junction large-area module currently is 11.7 ± 0.4%, as reported by Green et al. Toshiba Corporation fabricated this module through a two-step bar-coating process. The total area of their module was 703 cm2, which is currently the world's largest high-performing flexible PSC module.

However, glass-based rigid substrates still display superior performance to their flexible counterparts. For example, Li et al. achieved a certified PCE of 19.6% by fabricating a large-area (active area > 1 cm2) PSC device on a glass/FTO-substrate. This is a value yet to be achieved by large-area flexible PSC devices. As such, although large-area cells currently output low efficiency, the ongoing development of such production processes is a crucial objective for current research.

In order to achieve widespread commercialization, solar cells must be able to provide low cost, long-term stability, flexibility, transparency, and easy integration characteristics. The most widely used Si solar cells provide long-term stability and high efficiency, but their applications are limited by their rigidness and opacity. Next generation solar cells such as organic solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells have advantages of low cost, transparency, and simple processing, but they exhibit relatively low efficiency (PCE = 10–13%) and poor long-term stability. Meanwhile, PSCs can be printed on flexible substrates and also exhibit transparency, compared to silicon solar cells, but their long-term stability still remains a challenge to be addressed. In addition, industry costs are unpredictable due to the current absence of a large-scale production facility, so we roughly estimated the material cost and compared the device cost of polymer/TCO, metal, and TCO-free substrate-based hybrid flexible PSCs in Table 2.

Polymer/TCO substrate based PSCs

– Normal structured (n–i–p) flexible PSC (PET/ITO/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD): 35.30–60.75 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode, barrier function, sealant)
– Inverted structured (p–i–n) flexible PSC (PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM): 33.53–62.29 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode, barrier function, sealant)
Metal foil based flexible PSC (Ti-foil/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD): 50.30–51.75 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode, sealant)
Graphene-TCE based flexible PSC (PET/graphene/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM): 40.53–47.29 $ per m2 + α (counter flexible TCE, barrier function, and sealant)
The costs for polymer/TCO substrate-based flexible PSCs are based on normal (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) types. For example, the material costs of normal (PET/ITO/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD) and inverted (PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM) structured flexible PSCs are 35.30–60.75 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode, barrier function, and sealant) and 33.53–62.29 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode, barrier function, and sealant), respectively. Additionally, materials for a metal foil based flexible PSC (Ti-foil/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD) cost 50.30–51.75 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode and sealant), while the material cost for flexible PSCs based on a graphene-TCE substrate (PET/graphene/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM) is 40.53–47.29 $ per m2 + α (counter flexible TCE, barrier function, and sealant). Most of the cost calculations were performed based on bulk material costs from Sigma-Aldrich. After directly consulting with Sigma-Aldrich Korea Ltd., the bulk costs were estimated to be approximately 70% of the total amount when considering the materials listed in Table 2. In addition, it is worth noting that the proposed costs may potentially be an overestimation due to possible distribution costs applied by Sigma-Aldrich, which is not the actual manufacturer of said materials. This can be corrected when large-scale direct suppliers of the listed materials may emerge in the future. With regard to material cost, inverted type flexible PSCs have the potential to demonstrate lower cost than their normal type counterparts. This is because cheaper HTL materials such as PEDOT:PSS and ETL materials such as naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives can be used for inverted type devices, while they cannot be used for normal type devices because of orthogonal processability. Recently, Im et al. reported that such HTL and ETL materials have excellent photo-stability and device performance. In addition, to pass the damp heat test for commercialization, in which there must be less than 10% degradation of the initial efficiency after storing the PSC at 85 °C/85% relative humidity for 1000 h, additional barrier layers and encapsulation processes are required because moisture and oxygen molecules can penetrate through the polymer substrate and/or cracked polymer/TCO substrate.
On the other hand, metal substrate based flexible PSCs such as Ti-foil/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD exhibit a material cost of 50.30–51.75 $ per m2 + α (top-counter electrode and sealant), comparable to that of polymer/TCO substrate-based PSCs. Also, they don't require an additional barrier layer since the metal substrate itself exhibits good barrier properties against moisture and oxygen invasion. However, they require the additional development of a top-counter TCE in order to compensate for the opacity of the metal substrate.
Unlike polymer/TCO and metal substrate-based flexible PSCs, graphene-TCE based flexible PSCs are capable of super flexibility due to the absence of brittle TCO. In addition, while the current market price for PET/graphene substrates is generally very high, ranging from ten to hundred thousand USD per m2, a much cheaper alternative was found to be provided by Charmtron Co. Ltd. While it is not yet in the commercialization stage for PET/graphene films, a price of 17–20 $ per m2 will be proposed by the time commercialization will have been achieved. However, Charmtron Co. Ltd. claims to be able to supply PET/graphene films with high sheet resistance (<200 ohm per sq), but this is expected to be overcome through a doping process. As a result, using the cheaper alternative, prices for PET/graphene substrate based PSCs such as PET/graphene/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM will range from 40.53–47.29 $ per m2 + α (counter electrode, barrier function, and sealant), which strongly compares to those of the other device architectures mentioned above.
A more comprehensive cost analysis of flexible PSCs may require further consideration of the total manufacturing costs, which include investment, overhead and labor costs. However, since the overall manufacturing processes for the aforementioned flexible PSCs are expected to be similar throughout, the cost competitiveness is expected to be more dependent on the material cost.

We introduced recent development trends for flexible PSCs. To date, flexible PSCs have been categorized by whether the device is based on a polymer/TCO, metal, or TCO-free substrate. So far, the n–i–p type polymer/TCO substrate-based flexible PSCs have shown a maximum PCE of 16.01%, while p–i–n type devices have shown a maximum PCE of 18.10%. However, polymer substrate-based flexible PSCs are limited by thermal deformation during fabrication, so metal substrates have been introduced to overcome this barrier. Currently, the highest achieved PCE for flexible PSCs based on metal substrates is 15.00%. Meanwhile, most TCO-free flexible PSCs make intensive use of graphene electrodes and their useful properties, and have achieved a PCE up to 18.3%. Despite the achievements with small devices, large modules do not yet show satisfying results. In addition, due to the absence of a large-scale manufacturing process, it is currently difficult to provide a detailed cost analysis for flexible PSCs. In response, we roughly estimated the material cost and compared the device cost of polymer/TCO, metal, and TCO-free substrate-based flexible PSCs.

Hence, we would like to suggest our own perspective of further studies for the commercialization of flexible PSCs. To advance toward commercial applications of flexible PSCs, we should consider efficiency, stability, and cost. While the PCE of rigid PSCs has reached over 22%, flexible PSCs still exhibit lower efficiency values. This is because the transmittance of a rigid glass/FTO substrate is higher than that of flexible PET/ITO and the reflectance of a glass/ITO substrate is lower than that of PET/ITO, all due to the smaller refractive index of glass (n = ∼1.52 at λ = 589 nm)/FTO (n = 1.46–1.5 at λ = 589 nm) than PET (n = ∼1.64 at λ = 589 nm)/ITO (n = 1.8–1.84 at λ = 589 nm). The transmittance through a flexible PET/ITO substrate is effectively reduced by 10–15% when compared to glass/FTO substrates, thereby also lowering the maximum Jsc of the flexible PSCs. Some methods of overcoming this problem are to develop a new flexible substrate with a low refractive index or a new optical design of flexible substrate/TCE such as an OMO (oxide/metal/oxide) TCE, or a cheap anti-reflection layer such as single layer low-reflection coating. To date, the polymer/OMO TCE substrate has been intensively studied to enhance transmittance, sheet conductivity, and flexibility simultaneously.
Unlike rigid glass, the polymer substrate has weak barrier properties against moisture and oxygen invasion, so providing enhanced barrier properties to the polymer substrate is also much needed. The sandwich-structured rigid PSCs have sufficient stability as long as the device is encapsulated under 20% relative humidity in air. Thus, protection of the perovskite layer against moisture invasion through the top and side surfaces of the substrate is most crucial. Accordingly, to enhance the stability of flexible PSCs, it is better to improve the barrier properties of flexible substrates as close to the TCE as possible, such as by independently controlling each oxide layer's composition in the OMO film. Potential candidates for the top oxide layer are SnO2 or doped SnO2 for the ETL, NiO or doped NiO for the HTL, and Al2O3, SiO2, or multiple oxide layers as the barrier for the bottom oxide layer. Concurrently, we should also consider the composition of the metal layer to ensure the long-term stability of flexible PSCs, since the conductivity of the OMO film is also dependent on the metal layer. In case the top oxide layer is cracked due to severe deformation or repeated fatigue, the metal layer must be chemically inert to the perovskite layer. Ag can potentially react with iodide to form AgI, which will greatly degrade its conductivity. Therefore inert metals such as Cu, Mo, and Ni or mesh type metals may need to be considered as potential candidates.
The most expensive components of flexible PSCs are the conductive substrate, ETL, and HTL. Currently, the cost comparison of conductive substrates is in the order metal < conductive polymer substrates ≈ polymer/graphene, when considering the barrier properties. If a flexible PSC device is installed on an already bent surface such as a vehicle body or a building, which does not bring about severe repeated deformation, a TCO may be preferred as the TCE and barrier layer. Accordingly, metal substrate-based flexible PSCs on a TCO will be preferred in order to produce cost-effective and stable flexible PSCs. On the other hand, if we can develop a conductive polymer substrate with sufficient barrier properties, the polymer substrate-based flexible PSCs can also be commercialized in the near future.
The choice of bendable willow glass and flexible metal substrates is not limited by processing temperature, but flexible polymer substrates cannot be processed at high temperatures. The processing temperature of PET and PEN must be below their critical temperature of 150 °C, whereas CPI can be processed at over 150 °C due to its higher glass transition temperature (Tg). As such, temperature limitations seem to hinder further development of polymer substrate-based flexible PSCs, but research on low-temperature processable ETMs and HTMs will be the key to steering towards high performance flexible PSCs. Parallelly, it is also greatly challenging to develop high temperature processable polymer substrates with good barrier properties, high transmittance, and low cost.
Aside from the cost of flexible conductive substrates, the material selection for ETLs and HTLs is also largely dependent on the device structure, when considering orthogonal processability. In order to deposit multiple layers through solution processing, the previously deposited layer must not be soluble in the subsequent solution. Generally, since perovskite materials are soluble in aprotic polar solvents, the ETL and HTL materials should not be soluble in said solvents. In addition, in order to create a uniform thin-film layer of perovskite upon the ETL for n–i–p (or HTL for p–i–n) type devices, the preceding ETL (HTL) must exhibit a higher surface energy to sufficiently wet the perovskite solution. A hydrophilic surface has higher surface energy than a hydrophobic surface, so a metal oxide ETL (HTL) or an orthogonally processable organic ETL (HTL) such as new cross-linkable materials and PEDOT:PSS is desirable for n–i–p and p–i–n type devices, respectively.
By considering the above requirements, an n-type metal oxide nano-sol such as SnO2, doped SnO2, TiO2, and doped TiO2 nano-sol is applicable as the ETL, and p-type organic materials cheaper than spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA are applicable as the HTL for n–i–p type flexible PSCs. Meanwhile, a p-type metal oxide nano-sol such as NiOx, doped NiOx, MoOx, and VOx or p-type organic materials such as PEDOT:PSS and modified PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, and new n-type organic materials such as NDI derivatives which are cheaper than PCBM as the ETL can be considered for p–i–n type flexible devices. In conclusion, the further development of proper substrates, ETLs, and HTLs will be closely followed by the mass-production of flexible PSC devices via solution processing methods such as roll to roll, slot-die coating, bar coating, spray coating, and 3D printing processes in the near future.
