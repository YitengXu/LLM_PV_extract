With respect to the successes from symmetric small molecules, asymmetric ones have recently emerged as an alternative choice. In this paper, we present the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of four asymmetric small molecule donors. The benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) end in the asymmetric push–pull CNR–DPP–BDT (CNR = octyl-2-cyano-3-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylate, DPP = diketopyrrolopyrrole) was tailored from hydrogen (H) to thiophene (T), 2-hexylbithiophene (HTT), and CNR, respectively, obtaining M1, M2, M3, and M4. In this order, the donor–donor interactions are enhanced with an increase of intermolecular forces, such as π–π-stacking and van de Waals forces, which enhances aggregation of the donor molecules. In parallel, the molecular dipolarity (|μ|) increases in this order from 5.39 D to 6.26 D, 6.34 D, and 6.92 D, respectively, gradually deviating from the value of PC71BM (5.01 D). The increase in the donor-to-PC71BM doplarity difference acts as another factor for enhancing the donor-to-PC71BM phase-separation. The donor/acceptor domain sizes increase from M1 (10 nm) to M2 (20 nm) and M3 (50 nm), and even formation of island-like mesostructured PC71BM aggregates (200 nm) for M4, corresponding to declined short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) as well as hole mobility (μh) from M1 to M4. This work reveals that control over the terminal moieties of asymmetric small molecules can be an important factor in tailoring photovoltaic performance.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) based on conjugated small molecules are flourishing in the community of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) because of the well-defined molecular structure with their definite molecular weights having no batch-to-batch variations, in comparison to their polymer counterparts. Encouragingly, great progress has been made in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for small molecule-based OSCs. Recently, small molecule-based OSCs with PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as electron-acceptor materials have achieved PCEs of >9% for single-junction devices and 10.1% for tandem devices, which are comparable to their polymer counterparts. The rapid advance of small-molecule-based OSCs can be largely attributed to the judicious design of the molecular structures. The mainstream design motifs for the small molecules involve a combination of the electron-rich (donor (D)) and the electron-deficient (acceptor (A)) units in a symmetric manner, e.g., A–D–A or D–A–D, producing a solution-processed molecule with strong light-harvesting ability, suitable energy levels, as well as desirable aggregation behaviors.

Breaking the symmetric A–D–A or D–A–D type small molecules leads to formation of the asymmetric D–A type donor molecules. The symmetric molecules normally have a small dipolarity value, while the symmetry breaking results in the occurrence of molecular dipolarity. So far, it has been well shown that the symmetric molecule donors, albeit their dipolarity is small and even zero, can lead to fabrication of high-efficiency OSCs with a PCE of >9%. However, the influences of molecular dipolarity on the photovoltaic property of asymmetric small molecule OSCs are rarely studied. Since the molecular dipole moment is a factor regulating the molecular aggregation behavior, it is therefore a factor affecting the optoelectrical properties. For example, it was demonstrated that the mobilities of conjugated molecules or molecular-doped polymers decreased when their permanent dipole moments increased due to the random internal fields caused by the dipole moments. Again, reports pointed out that some asymmetric nonlinear materials, with large dipole moments, might aggregate in an antiparallel style to minimize the net dipole moments. Recently, it has been demonstrated that dipolar D–A molecules, for example, merocyanine and p-DTS(BTTh2)2, tend to self-assemble into centrosymmetric (antiparallel) dimers, thus effectively eliminating the molecular dipole moments at the supramolecular levels. Following this clue, several dipolar D–A molecules, based on squaraine, merocyanine, triphenylamine, and oligothiophene have been reported for OPV applications, with PCEs varying from 1–6%.
For a highly efficient device, the phase-separated nanostructures such as the packing ordering, donor-to-acceptor interfaces, and domain sizes, are essential to the exciton migration/dissociation and charge transportation/collection. Structural tailoring on donor materials is known as an effective method to regulate the phase separated nanostructures. For the symmetric small molecules, tailoring involves backbone modification and side chain/end-capped unit tailoring. Recently, conjugated backbone end-capping groups have been demonstrated to have a structural role in manipulating the film morphology and photovoltaic properties. For asymmetric D–A molecules, structure tailoring usually involves an adjustment in the molecular dipolarity, which affects the molecular assembly, orientation and film morphology, and thus, the photovoltaic parameters. For example, Wurthner et al. reported a series of dipolar merocyanine dyes with regulated packing styles from tailored structures and dipole moments. They found that the stair-like slipped stacks with J-type excitonic coupling favored charge transport and improved the performance and hole mobility of OSCs. Roncali et al. manipulated the open-circuit voltage (Voc) by desymmetrizing the A–D–A structures, which lead to a different packing arrangement as the Voc was related to the molecular orientation and donor-to-acceptor nanostructure interfaces.
In this context, we designed four asymmetric molecules to systemically study the effects of terminal groups in asymmetric small molecules on the photovoltaic property. We selected CNR–BDT–DPP (CNR = octyl-2-cyano-3-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylate, DPP = diketopyrrolopyrrole and BDT = benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene) as the model D–A backbone and capped the DPP end with CNR, which is a polar electron-withdrawing unit, while the BDT end was capped with hydrogen (H), thiophene (T), 2-hexylbithiophene (HTT), and CNR, obtaining M1, M2, M3, and M4 (Scheme 1), respectively. We selected the four unilateral end-capped units considering the different dipolarity (H < T < HTT < CNR), which was expected to afford various overall molecular dipolarities. In addition to the dipole–dipole interactions, the introduction of the terminal moiety, e.g., the thiophene unit on M2, the alkylated bithiophene on M3, and the CNR units on M4, increases the intermolecular forces, such as π–π stacking and van der Waals forces, with respect to M1, which increases both the D–D and D–A interactions. The structure–property relationships studied herein provides valuable information for the designing of efficient asymmetric small molecule donors.


Scheme 2 shows the synthetic routes to M1–M4. In general, two kinds of reactions, namely, the Stille coupling (i) and Knoevenagel condensation (ii), were alternately applied to the synthetic processes. Firstly, starting material 1, prepared according to literature methods, was subjected to the Stille coupling reaction (i) with dibrominated DPP (2), producing compound 3. Then, the Knoevenagel condensation (ii) was applied to 3 and 4, affording intermediate 5. The stannyl compounds 6–9 were synthesized according to our previous work.M1 and M3 were obtained via a one-step Stille coupling reaction (i) using 5 with 6 and 8, respectively. M2 was obtained by a two-step Stille coupling reaction (i) from 5, whereas M4 was produced by a Stille coupling (i) and a Knoevenagel condensation reaction (ii), respectively, from 5. M1–M4 were fully characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, TOF-mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. All four molecules are soluble in commonly used organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, and ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), ensuring good solution-processability for photovoltaics fabrication.


Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of M1–M4 in dilute chloroform solutions and in solid-state films. The relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, in chloroform solutions, strong absorption bands located at 500–750 nm are found, which have been ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from donating units to the electron-deficient DPP core. Similar ICT bands were also observed in our previous reports on symmetric DPP-based molecules. From M1 (λsolm = 627 nm), M2 (λsolm = 632 nm) to M3 (λsolm = 637 nm), the ICT peaks are a little red-shifted due to the introduction of electron-donating thiophene and bithiophene end groups. M4 exhibits stronger absorption than the other three molecules.

The solid-state film absorption spectra of the four molecules (Fig. 1b) present more broadened and more red-shifted absorption than those measured in solution and two absorption peaks appear for all four molecules. All of these suggest formation of J-type π–π interactions in the solid state. Formation of J-type aggregation usually gives a red-shifting absorption with respect to the molecular state. The two peaks are both red-shifted as the end-cap is changed from H to T, HTT, and CNR. The gradual red-shifting of the absorption indicates the displacement is different for the four molecules. The π–π stacking distance, the different distortional order between the end-cap and DPP–BDT skeleton, and the different dipole moments are all factors affecting the displacement between conjugated π-electrons (vide post). M1, M2, M3, and M4 show absorption edges of 813 nm, 840 nm, 852 nm, and 860 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.53 eV, 1.48 eV, 1.46 eV, and 1.44 eV, respectively.

Fig. 2a demonstrates the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of M1–M4, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. All oxidation processes are quasi-reversible. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels are estimated from the onset potential of reduction and oxidation processes, according to the empirical equation of LUMO = −(Eonset(red) + 4.4) eV and HOMO = −(Eonset(ox) + 4.4) eV, respectively. The data are shown in Table 1. The four molecules have close LUMO levels, about −3.65 eV. This is consistent with the calculations from the density function theory (DFT) approach. As shown in Fig. S1, the LUMO is predominantly located on the T–DPP–T section for all four molecules. The HOMO energies estimated from CV tests are −5.14, −5.19, −5.20, and −5.27 eV, respectively for M1, M2, M3, and M4. As shown by the DFT calculations, the HOMO is distributed over the conjugated CNR–DPP–BDT skeleton for all four molecules, and the contributions from the end-caps are involved. As we turn to the molecular structures shown in Scheme 1, the end-caps are covalently joined to the electron-donating BDT end. It is rational that adjusting the end-cap on the BDT end can lead to a change in the HOMO energy of the molecule, while the LUMO level can be kept nearly unchanged. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of M1–M4 estimated from CV tests are depicted in Fig. 2b.

Bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices were prepared using M1, M2, M3, and M4, as donor materials and PC71BM as the acceptor material with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al under an AM 1.5 simulated solar light at 100 mW m−2 (AAA grade). PEDOT:PSS is poly[3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrenesulfonate)]. The blends were spin-coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solutions and the active area of the device was 6 mm2. A series of device optimizations, e.g., screening of donor/PC71BM weight ratios and selecting of additive contents, were conducted and shown in Table S1, in which the highest PCEs under different conditions were given in color and the average PCEs, derived statistically from ten cells were offered for reference. The donor/PC71BM weight ratios were firstly screened and the optimum ratio was found to be 1:1 (w/w) for all four devices. Then, based on the best donor/PC71BM weight ratio of 1:1, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a solvent additive to improve the device performance. Table 2 gives the photovoltaic properties from champion cells and Fig. 3 shows the current-density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best four molecules-based cells.

The four molecules (M1–M4) declared different open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.82, 0.74, 0.67, and 0.78 V, respectively. As known, Voc is related to the gap of the donor HOMO and the acceptor LUMO and is also influenced by the nature of the donor-to-acceptor nanostructure interfaces that determine the volume density of the charge-transfer (CT) states and the coupling between the CT state and the ground state, and the metal–organic interfacial contacts. Considering the similar HOMO levels of the four molecules and the same device structure, the different Voc suggests different interfacial structures and/or energy of the CT state in the four donor/PC71BM blends.
Comparing the champion results of the four molecules, M1 and M2 exhibited high fill factors (FF) of 61.7% and 62.3%, respectively. When the unilateral end-capped unit was changed to HTT for M3, the FF decreased to 58.4%. Finally, M4, end-capped with CNR, displays an even lower FF of 42.0%. The short circuit current density (Jsc) varied as the unilateral end-capped units changed. M1 exhibited a Jsc of 7.06 mA cm−2. After end-capped with T and HTT, M2 and M3 afforded a slightly inferior Jsc of 6.65 mA cm−2 and 6.45 mA cm−2, respectively. Whereas M4, end-capped with dipolar CNR, exhibited an apparently decreased Jsc of 2.76 mA cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and blended-film absorption spectrum of M1 and M4 were tested for comparison. As shown in Fig. S2, for M1–PC71BM, the EQE curve exhibits a broad response from 350–800 nm, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption profile, corresponding to the related high Jsc. For M4–PC71BM, the EQE response is weak, with a maximum monochromatic EQE below 5%, leading to the inferior Jsc.
We tested the hole mobilities (μh) of the four champion devices using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S3) with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au.M1 and M2 exhibited hole mobilities of 1.60 × 10−4 and 1.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Whereas M3 and M4 showed decreased μh of 3.90 × 10−5 and 6.00 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

The samples for X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were prepared by spin-coating M1–M4 in o-DCB solutions (5 mg mL−1) onto pre-cleaned silica substrates. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of M1–M4 and Table 3 summarizes the d-spacing of the corresponding diffraction angles, derived from the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = λ (herein, λ = 1.5418 Å). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, M1 and M2, with conjugated terminals, exhibited strong first-order diffraction peaks (100) and higher order assembly (200 and 300), as well as an obvious π–π stacking diffraction (010) peak with dπ–π = 3.58 Å and 3.53 Å, respectively, indicating the ordered three-dimensional assembly for M1 and M2. M3, terminated with HTT, showed strong (100), (200), and (300) diffractions, but weakened π–π stacking diffraction signals. Finally, M4, bilateral end-capped with CNR, not only showed reduced (100), (200), and (300) diffractions, but also an ambiguous π–π stacking diffraction signal, indicating the weak molecular assembly order. M1 (dπ–π = 3.58 Å) and M2 (dπ–π = 3.53 Å) also showed smaller π–π stacking distances than those for M3 (dπ–π = 3.66 Å) and M4 (dπ–π = 3.60 Å), which is consistent with the declining μh value trend.

In order to probe the underlying causes affecting the packing order from the molecular level, density function theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level were conducted to study the optimized conformations of the four donor molecules. The input files for calculations were constructed according to the crystal structure data of DPP. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the alkyl chains were reduced to methyl groups for avoiding computational load. θ1, θ2, and θ3 denote the dihedral angles of CNR–DPP and DPP–BDT, and BDT-end-capped units, respectively. For M1, as shown in Fig. 5a, the backbone presented good planarity, with both θ1 = θ2 = 2°. After end-capping with T, HTT, and CNR, to the BDT terminal, a twisted angle of 27°, 23°, and 49°, respectively, emerged between the backbone and the end-capped units (Fig. 5b–d), reducing the backbone planarity. For M3, end-capped with HTT, there is also a torsional angle of θ4 = 15° between the two thiophene moieties. For M4, in addition to the large angle of θ3 = 49°, θ1 and θ2 were also enlarged, indicating its poor backbone planarity. The torsional disorderliness along the HTT and CNR cap-ended molecules can lead to enlargement of the π–π stacking distance compared to the H and T end-capping molecules.

Electrical performance of a solar cell is comprehensively associated to the exciton migration/dissociation and charge transportation/collection, all of which are determined by the phase separated nanostructures, e.g., packing order and domain size. As presented in the TEM images (Fig. 6a–d), the bright regions can be attributed to the donor domains while the dark regions represent the PC71BM domains due to its high electron scattering density. From the blended film of M1–PC71BM, a fibrillar structure with phase sizes of 10 nm for both donor and acceptor domains was found, which was close to the exciton diffusion length (typically, 10 nm). The M2–PC71BM system showed the interpenetrated network structures with increased phase size of 20 nm for both donor and PC71BM domains. For the M3–PC71BM, the phase domains increased to about 50 nm. Finally, the M4–PC71BM afforded island-like phase separation with a PC71BM domain size of 200 nm. The AFM images displayed the same trend for domain sizes from M1 to M4, as shown in Fig. S4.

The different phase sizes of M1–M4 were associated with the differences in the D–D, D–A, and A–A interactions. As the end-capping units go from H to T, HTT and CNR, the π–π-interactions increased with the introduction of the end-capping π-system. In parallel, the decoration of the alkyl-chain on the HTT and CNR end introduced van der Waals forces, e.g., dispersion, induction, and orientation forces. Both the enhanced π–π-interactions and van der Waals forces assisted the aggregation of the donor molecules.
Also, the dipolarity of the donor molecules would be altered by the end-capping units, which can adjust the D–A interactions. In order to evaluate the contributions from the dipole interactions, we conducted DFT calculations to estimate the dipole moments of organic molecules. Herein, we calculated the internal dipole moments of M1–M4 and PC71BM (Fig. 7), respectively, based on gas phase DFT. As the polarity of the end-capped units increased, the dipole moments (|μ|) gradually elevated from M1 (|μ| = 5.39 D), M2 (|μ| = 6.26 D), M3 (|μ| = 6.34 D), to M4 (|μ| = 6.92 D). The dipole moment of PC71BM was calculated to be 5.01 D. We noticed that from M1 to M4, the dipole moment values deviated gradually from that of PC71BM.
The experimental dipole moments of M1, M2, M3, and M4 were tested in solution (ESI). As shown in Table S4, the ground dipole moments of M1, M2, M3, and M4 were tested to be 1.89 D, 3.14 D, 3.19 D, and 3.79 D. In general, the experimental dipole moments show increasing trends from M1 to M4, which were consistent with the theoretical results. Otherwise, the experimental dipole moments were general lower than the calculated results, presumably due to the influence of solvents.
As demonstrated in the previous studies on the asymmetric non-linear optical materials, dipolar molecules tend to aggregate in an antiparallel style to minimize the dipole moments. Recently, a similar point was considered for other kinds of asymmetric donor molecules in OPV devices. Following similar considerations, we proposed an aggregating model (Fig. 8) to elucidate the contributions of the dipolar interactions to gradual increases of the domain size from M1 to M4. As it is established that the asymmetric push–pull dyes tend to assemble to antiparallel dimers to minimize the dipole moments, we also speculated that the four asymmetric molecules tended to assemble into antiparallel dimers in the solid state (Fig. 8a). There is a special case that when the donor dipolarity is similar to that of PC71BM, the two molecules are expected to form a supramolecular dimer. When the dipolarity of donor and PC71BM has an obviously discrepancy, formation of the donor-to-PC71BM dimers becomes disfavored in the solid state (Fig. 8b). For M1 blended with PC71BM, the M1-to-PC71BM dimers were expected due to their close values of the dipole moments (5.39 D vs. 5.01 D), which contributes to the smallest phase size (10 nm) among the four systems, as schematically shown in Fig. 8c. From M2 (|μ| = 6.26 D), M3 (|μ| = 6.34 D) to M4 (|μ| = 6.92 D), as the dipole moments increased and deviated from that value of PC71BM (|μ| = 5.01 D), formation of the donor-to-PC71BM dimers becomes increasingly disfavored, leading to a larger and larger phase size and a smaller and smaller interface area (Fig. 8d).
In addition to the contributions from the intermolecular interactions involving dipole–dipole interactions, the donor–PCBM domain size was again associated with the features of the end-capping units. For example, the conjugated end of M1 and M2 may be beneficial for improving the donor–PC71BM compatibility, in comparison to the alkyl end of M3 and M4, as observed previously.
The intermolecular forces, such as dipolar, π–π stacking, and van der Waals forces (including dispersion, induction, and orientation) forces were the driving forces for molecular aggregation. This work demonstrated that the D–A dipolarity difference was a factor in tuning the D/A domain size by judiciously designing asymmetric small molecules.

We have successfully synthesized four asymmetric molecules based on the BDT–DPP backbone, in which the DPP end was capped with octyl-2-cyano-3-(thiophen-2-yl) acrylate (CNR), while the BDT end was capped differently with hydrogen (H, M1), thiophene (T, M2), 2-hexylbithiophene (HTT, M3), and CNR (M4), respectively. By using PC71BM as an acceptor, the solar cells showed a decreased fill factor (FF), hole mobility (μh), Jsc and PCE from M1 to M4. XRD tests and DFT calculations revealed the decreased packing order from M1 to M4 due to the declined backbone planarity. TEM images showed the increased phase sizes from M1 (10 nm), M2 (20 nm), M3 (50 nm) to M4 (200 nm). The decreasing phase size and solar cell performance were attributed to the enhanced intermolecular forces such as the π–π stacking, van der Waals forces, and the dipolar interactions. We found that the elevated dipole moments of the four asymmetric molecules were 5.39 D, 6.26 D, 6.34 D, and 6.92 D, respectively, which deviated gradually from the value of PC71BM (5.01 D), acting as a factor contributing to the phase size differences. Our work on the structure–performance studies demonstrated that tailoring the end-capped units was valuable in designing efficient asymmetric small molecule donors.


All of the starting materials and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and were used without further purification, unless otherwise stated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl under nitrogen before use. Starting materials 2 and 7 were purchased from Suna Tech Inc. Synthesis and identification of compound 6, 8, and 9 were reported in our previous work.


The representative procedure for the Stille coupling reaction (i): stannyl compound 1 (1 eq.) and brominated compound 2 (1 eq.) were dissolved in dry toluene (20 mL) and degassed with N2 for 10 min. Pd(PPh3)4 was added and the solution was degassed with N2 for another 10 min. The mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 12 h under a N2 atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water (50 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL).
