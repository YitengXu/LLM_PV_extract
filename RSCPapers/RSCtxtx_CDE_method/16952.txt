Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have the potential to compete with mesoporous PSCs due to their comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and their preparation, which can be achieved via similar processes to those of flexible or tandem PSCs. However, the severe current–voltage hysteresis that occurs in PSCs is still a big issue, attributable to trap-induced charge recombination and ion migration. Herein, we develop a universal strategy combining interface (PMMA:C60) and grain boundary (PTABr) engineering to effectively eliminate the hysteresis of planar PSCs by finely tuning the electron transport layer/perovskite interface and perovskite film morphology (grain size and grain boundary). Microstructure and spectral characterization, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and photoelectric measurements reveal that this ingenious combination of the two engineering approaches effectively reduces the trap sites and enlarges the perovskite grain size, leading to negligible hysteresis and high performance PSCs based on various compositional perovskites including MAPbI3, Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.99%, 19.82%, 21.41% and extra-low hysteresis indices of 0.011, 0.007, 0.005, respectively. This work demonstrates a universal strategy by which to fabricate high efficiency and negligible hysteresis PSCs regardless of perovskite composition.

Nowadays, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread attention as one of the most promising types of next-generation solar cell, due to their impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) by the cost-effective solution process. The intrinsic optoelectronic attributes of perovskites, such as high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, low exciton binding energy, and tunable band gap, have led to an increase in the PCE from 3.9% up to 25.2%.

To date, of the PSCs which have been certified to have ultra-high PCEs, almost all have been manufactured with a mesoporous electron transporting layer (ETL). However, mesoporous PSCs usually require a high-temperature manufactured TiO2 crystalline layer, which does not meet the requirements of low-cost and flexible device application. Compared with mesoporous PSCs, sandwiched n–i–p planar PSCs have attracted great attention as one of the most promising alternatives, owing to their simplicity and low-temperature fabrication. Several strategies have been suggested to upgrade the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs in terms of PCE, open circuit voltage (Voc), and stability against humility and illumination, however, the severe hysteresis that occurs in planar PSCs as a result of their low-temperature solution-treated oxide ETLs (e.g. SnO2 and ZnO) limits their true performance. Recent reports have ascribed the major origins of this hysteresis to charge trapping and detrapping processes that occur at the interfaces and ion migration through perovskite absorbers. Ion migration is reported to dominate at the grain boundaries. Therefore, both reduction of trap-assisted nonradiative recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and the optimization of the grain size of perovskite film are indispensable in eliminating hysteresis.
A large number of defects at interfaces are a crucial reason for hysteresis in devices. Theoretical and experimental evidence has revealed that under-coordinated Pb (Pb2+) makes up the presiding recombination-trap sites at the interface of ETL/perovskite. The passivation of under-coordinated Pb (Pb2+) to decrease the trap sites is proposed to be effective in promoting the photoelectric performance in terms of efficiency and stability as well as hysteresis of the final devices. Lewis bases such as thiophene, pyridine, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP), poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT), graphene, fullerenes and their derivatives, have been reported as passivation materials to reduce the charge state of Pb2+ defect ions, thereby suppressing charge trapping and eliminating hysteresis. As an example, a universal passivation strategy of using PMMA:PCBM on both sides of the perovskite has been introduced into mesoporous PSCs, resulting in an efficiency of 20.80% (stabilized) and negligible hysteresis. However, it is difficult to prepare compact, dense and large-grain-sized perovskite films deposited on a highly hydrophobic PMMA:PCBM (∼70° contact angle) layer, and thus PMMA:PCBM is hardly used as a passivation layer in planar PSCs. C60 has been widely used as an ETL in planar PSCs, and more importantly, the moderate hydrophilicity of C60 (∼40–50° contact angle) makes it suitable for use in polar perovskite precursor solutions, thereby meaning that high-quality perovskite films can be prepared with high repeatability on oxide ETLs with the same formulation. Moreover, C60 possesses a much higher electron mobility (1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity (2.3 × 10−3 S cm−1) than those of PCBM (6.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.2 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively), which could compensate for the non electron conductivity of PMMA.
Additionally, high-quality perovskite film with a low density of grain boundaries is a prerequisite for fabricating high-efficiency PSCs. To obtain high-quality perovskite film, various additives such as PCBM, PbI2 (ref. 33) and lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) have been used to enlarge the grain size of perovskites and reduce grain boundaries, decreasing the carrier recombination sites and the consequent hysteresis. Additionally, post-treatment is also one of the effective approaches that has been used to passivate grain boundaries, in which additives (e.g. PTABr, PTAI, methylammonium bromide (MABr), formamidinium bromide (FABr) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GUTS)) are covered on the perovskite film, accompanied by the enlarging of the perovskite grain size from the nanometer-to the micron scale. This leads to a low density of grain boundaries in the perovskite film, and a mitigated hysteresis effect in the device. Taking effectiveness into consideration, it is desirable to combine interface and grain boundary engineering to simultaneously reduce the trap sites at the interface of the ETL/perovskite and control the perovskite film morphology in planar devices to eliminate hysteresis and make further progress in terms of the device photoelectric performance.
Herein, we develop a universal strategy combining interface and grain boundary engineering to effectively eliminate the hysteresis in planar PSCs, using electron conductive and moderately hydrophilic PMMA:C60 to passivate recombination-active defects at the electron transporting layer (ETL)/perovskite interface and phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) to obtain a large grain size (∼l μm), less grain boundary, and dense perovskite film. Furthermore, superior electron transport, as well as the moderate hydrophilicity of the PMMA:C60 layer, were proved from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoelectric measurements. Such a universal strategy was found to be efficient in improving the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs regardless of the perovskite composition, leading to the achievement of high PCEs of 18.99%, 19.82%, 21.41% and extra-low hysteresis indices of 0.011, 0.007, 0.005 for MAPbI3-, Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3- and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3-based planar PSCs, respectively. This work provides a universal strategy for eliminating hysteresis and releasing the potential efficiency of planar-architecture PSCs.

Trap-assisted charge recombination at the interface of the ETL/perovskite is the main factor behind the hysteresis in PSCs. Recently, much progresses has been reported on the passivation of recombination-active defects with PMMA:PCBM, however, this research was mainly focused on the high-temperature processing of TiO2 mesoporous-structured PSCs. Considering the high electron mobility as well as moderate hydrophilicity of C60, herein, we explore the potential of the passivation layer in planar PSCs by replacing PCBM with C60. The real-time contact angles of PMMA:PCBM and PMMA:C60 with water were measured to be 74.4° and 40.5°, respectively (Fig. 1a and b). The morphological properties of the perovskite film were further analyzed from SEM and AFM measurements. When the perovskite precursor solution is deposited on top of a PMMA:PCBM passivation layer (Fig. 1c), a large number of pinholes can be clearly observed in the perovskite film owing to the non-wetting (non-polar) properties of PCBM. Some pinholes are deep enough to allow direct connection between the hole transport material (HTM) and ETL, which can lead to shunt-leakage paths that reduce the fill factor (FF) and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The PMMA:C60 passivation layer with moderate hydrophilicity enables the uniform spread of the perovskite precursor over the substrates. As a result, the quality of the perovskite greatly improves when substituting PCBM with C60, and a smooth, dense and pinhole-free perovskite film is obtained (Fig. 1d). AFM measurements were carried out to gain information on the surface roughness in the perovskite layer (Fig. 1e and f). The root-mean-square (RMS) values of the surface roughness of perovskite films were found to be 39.90 and 27.15 nm when deposited on the PMMA:PCBM and PMMA:C60 layers, respectively. The reduction in surface roughness suggests that the perovskite film deposited on PMMA:C60 is smoother and more uniform. The AFM and SEM characterization results show that the PMMA:C60 passivation layer may decrease the number of the shunt-current pathways between the HTM and the ETL.

The perovskite films on top of the PMMA:PCBM and PMMA:C60 passivation layers was then assembled into devices to evaluate their photovoltaic performance and explore the effects of the PMMA:PCBM and PMMA:C60 interlayers on the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs. PSCs were fabricated with ITO/SnO2/PMMA:C60 or PMMA:PCBM/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structures. For comparison, PSCs without any passivation layer were also prepared as control devices. Fig. S1 and S2 and Table S1 show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves as well as the related photovoltaic parameters of the involved PSCs measured in the reverse scanning direction. The control PSC exhibits a PCE of 16.60%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.54%, respectively. As predicted, the passivation device based on PMMA:PCBM with an optimum concentration of 1.0:3.0 mg mL−1 exhibits a lower PCE (16.25%) than that of the control device. Even worse, its FF value is lower than 60%, probably due to the severe shunt-current induced by the pinholes in the perovskite film. In contrast, the optimum concentration (1.0:1.0 mg mL−1) of the PMMA:C60-based PSC leads to a higher PCE of 18.81%, with a Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 22.47 mA cm−2 and FF of 76.93%. The increased FF values of the device again illustrates the fact that PMMA:C60 is more favorable in promoting the spread of the polar perovskite precursor solution, enabling the growth of a dense and pinhole-free perovskite layer. We attribute the improvement in the FF and PCE values to the excellent passivation effect of PMMA:C60 on the SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface. Photovoltaic parameters based on different passivation layer Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 devices are summarized in Table 1. The cell with pure PMMA exhibits a lower PCE compared to the control cell, owing to the huge series resistance of non-conducting PMMA. The cell with pure C60 shows increased Voc and PCE values relative to those of the control cell, because C60 passivates the grain boundaries of the perovskite and reduces the defects/trap states at perovskite interfaces. However, the Voc and PCE values are lower than those of the optimum PMMA:C60-based PSC, indicating the superior passivation effect of PMMA:C60. In Fig. 2a, the gap between the forward and reverse J–V curves of the control device is huge, showing obvious hysteresis. The phenomenon of hysteresis is very common in planar PSCs, attributable to lots of trap sites located at the ETL/perovskite interface. For the PMMA:PCBM device, the gap between the forward and reverse J–V curves decreases, suggesting the passivation effect of PMMA:PCBM (Fig. 2b). When substituting PCBM with C60, the forward and reverse J–V curves basically coincide (Fig. 2c). For better comparison, the hysteresis index (HI) was calculated to quantify the hysteresis level according to the following equation: . The HI of the control device was calculated to be 0.102, because under-coordinated Pb (Pb2+) acts as dominant recombination-defect sites at the ETL/perovskite interface. Note that the HI of the PMMA:C60-based device dramatically decreases to a low value of 0.022. The reduction in the hysteresis can be attributed to the excellent passivation of PMMA to effectively reduce trap sites at the ETL/perovskite interface. Like other Lewis-base polymer passivation materials, PMMA can reduce the recombination centers of the Pb2+ defects at the ETL/perovskite interface, effectively decreasing non-radiative recombination and the consequent hysteresis. We provided more evidence for the passivation mechanism of PMMA in the form of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It can be seen from Fig. S3 that the peak characteristic of that of the CO bond in the pure PMMA film appears at 1732 cm−1, negatively shifting to 1724 cm−1 after the addition of PbI2. This shift in the peak associated with the CO bond indicates the molecular-level interaction between PMMA and PbI2, which shows the same results as those detailed in a previous study on polymer materials. In addition, oxygen atoms with negative electrostatic potential (yellow) (Fig. S4) can interact with the Pb2+, resulting in a negative shift in the CO bond peak, as shown in the FTIR spectra. Fig. S5 demonstrates the significant adsorption effect between PMMA and the Pb2+ defects. The distance between the O and Pb atoms at the adsorption site is shortened (Table S2), and the CO bond length at the defect surface also slightly lengthens due to the interaction of Pb–O. Therefore, PMMA effectively passivates under-coordinated Pb atoms at the ETL/perovskite interface via the carbonyl (CO) group with negative electrostatic potential. More data is discussed in the ESI in detail.

The hysteresis and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs are not only related to trap-assisted charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface, but also ion migration occurring at the grain boundaries of the perovskite film. Although an interface passivation engineering approach can mitigate the trap states, it cannot effectively reduce the density of grain boundaries. In general, increasing the grain size and passivating the grain boundaries are effective methods to reduce the density of grain boundaries. As shown before, the grain size of a Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 film deposited on PMMA:C60 passivation layer is less than 200 nm, with a high density of grain boundaries, which is the reason for the residual hysteresis effect in previous J–V curves. PTABr was introduced to post-treat the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 film. Fig. 3a–c show the morphologies of Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 films treated with PTABr ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg mL−1. The grain size of the perovskite with 0.5 mg mL−1 PTABr is 200–500 nm, with plenty of discernable grain boundaries, which suggests that such PTABr concentration is not good at promoting significant grain growth. Surprisingly, when the PTABr concentration increases to 1.0 mg mL−1, the grain size of the perovskite enlarges to 0.5–1.0 μm and a pinhole-free Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 film with a low density of grain boundaries can be observed. This significant increase in the grain size of perovskite crystals mainly originates during the Ostwald ripening process, in which two steps, including the dissolution of small-sized crystals because of the higher surface energy as well as the subsequent formation of large-sized crystals with lower surface energy, are involved. When the PTABr concentration further increases to 2.0 mg mL−1, a coarse perovskite film with some small nanocrystals and pinholes can be discerned again. All the perovskite films are black α-phase without any impurities, as revealed from the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3d, indicating that PTABr post-treatment does not change the crystal structure of the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite. The magnified XRD patterns of the (101) lattice plane are provided in Fig. S6, showing that the XRD diffraction peak positions shift positively upon increasing the amount of PTABr, attributable to a small amount of Br/I ion exchange. Moreover, UV-Vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (SS-PL) spectra of the PTABr-treated perovskite film both slightly blue-shift (Fig. 3e and f), originating from Br/I exchange reaction on the surface. According to previous work, the post-treatment with PTABr starts from the perovskite surface and a small number of PTA+ functional groups terminate on the perovskite surface. Thus, PTA+ does not incorporate into the perovskite lattice (A-site), and exists as a passivating cation to improve the perovskite quality.
Based on the above PMMA:C60-modified device, we adopted PTABr to post-treat the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite film via grain boundary engineering, with the aim of further reducing the hysteresis of PSCs. Target solar cells with a structure of ITO/SnO2/PMMA:C60/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 (PTABr)/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were fabricated. In addition, a schematic diagram of the device structure as well as a cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC are shown in Fig. S7a and b.J–V curves and the related photovoltaic parameters of the doubly-modified Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 PSCs with different amounts of PTABr and the best-performing device (target) are presented in Fig. S8, Table S3,Fig. 2d and Table 1, respectively. The best target cell with the optimum concentration of PTABr (1.0 mg mL−1) achieves a high PCE of 19.82 (19.68)% with a Voc of 1.09 (1.09) V, Jsc of 22.98 (22.99) mA cm−2 and FF of 78.94 (78.40)%, measured under reverse and forward scanning (RS and FS), as well as a negligible hysteresis index of 0.007. This hysteresis index is much lower than that of the control device. In contrast, the PSCs based on 0.5 and 2.0 mg mL−1 PTABr exhibit lower PCEs, which is consistent with the changes in morphology. We also tested the steady-state PCE of the control and target devices (Fig. S9b). Notably, the steady-state PCE enhances from 16.30% (control device) to 19.67% (target device), almost close to the PCE measured from J–V curves. These results suggest that the 1.0 mg mL−1 PATBr solution can induce Ostwald ripening to recrystallize the small grain size perovskite films to a large grain size. Treatment with PTABr concentrations that are too high can only induce a Br/I exchange reaction and cannot affect the grain growth of PSCs or significantly increase the PCE. Therefore, a strategy combining interface passivation with grain boundary engineering is effective for producing high performance PSCs with negligible hysteresis.
To further confirm the universality of our interface passivation and grain boundary engineering, two more PSCs with different compositions of perovskite films (MAPbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3) were fabricated, and the related J–V, I–T as well as external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are provided in Fig. S11, Table S4 and Fig. 4. Note that the concentration of PTABr for MAPbI3- and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3-based PSCs was optimized to be 1.0 mg mL−1 (Fig. S11 and Table S4). The surface morphologies of the MAPbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3 films are captured in Fig. S10 without and with post-treatment with PTABr solution. As seen from Table 2, the best MAPbI3 control cell PCE is 16.32 (14.01)% with a Voc of 1.03 (0.99) V, Jsc of 21.94 (21.95) mA cm−2, FF of 71.87 (64.51)% with RS (FS) and huge hysteresis is observed. Note that the target cell shows increased PCE with a value of 18.99 (18.79)% with RS (FS) and negligible hysteresis. As expected, the photovoltaic performance (including the PCE and hysteresis) of MAPbI3-based PSCs is also greatly improved upon implementing the interface passivation engineering and grain boundary engineering approach. As a consequence, a champion PCE of 21.41 (21.31)% with RS (FS) was achieved by the Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3 target cell, with negligible hysteresis (HI = 0.005). The stabilized PCEs of the control and target devices are shown in Fig. 4b and e. The steady-state PCEs are 18.57% and 21.21% for the MAPbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3 target devices, respectively. Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control and target PSCs with two kinds of perovskite are shown in Fig. 4c and f. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are 22.62 and 23.53 mA cm−2 for the MAPbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3 target devices, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values extracted from the J–V curves. Based on the above photovoltaic as well as SEM results, it can be deduced that the synergistic effect of interface passivation engineering and grain boundary engineering can effectively alleviate the serious hysteresis issues in planar PSCs, regardless of the difference in perovskite composition.

Generally, a deviation exists in the process of the artificial dropwise addition of the anti-solvent, therefore making it a challenge to achieve high-quality perovskite films and PSCs with high repeatability. To quantify the reproducibility of the performance of the PSCs, we fabricated 20 cells for each condition (control, PMMA:C60, PTABr, target) and separately show these in Fig. 5. The average PCEs of the control, PMMA:C60, and PTABr groups are 15.88%, 17.53%, 18.42% with standard deviations of 0.42, 0.41, 0.31, respectively. In the target cells, the reproducibility is greatly improved with an average PCE of 19.30% and a smaller standard deviation of 0.28. It is clear that the improved PCE can be attributed to the improvements in the Voc and FF.
To reveal the origins of the negligible hysteresis and improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs with interface passivation engineering and grain boundary engineering, steady-state photoluminescence (SS-PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and photoelectrochemical measurements were recorded. Fig. 6a shows the SS-PL of the control (ITO/SnO2/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3) and target (ITO/SnO2/PMMA:C60/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 (PTABr)) films. The PMMA:C60 passivation layer between the SnO2 and perovskite reduces the PL intensity, meaning a more efficient electron injection process with respect to the control SnO2/perovskite interface. TRPL spectra of the control and target films are shown in Fig. 6b, fitted using a double exponential rate law to study the carrier lifetime and interfacial charge transport properties. The average lifetimes (τavg) of the control and target films were estimated to be ∼23.75 and ∼18.33 ns, respectively (Table S5). The reduced lifetime for the target film indicates efficient electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2, which can prevent the accumulation of excess capacitive charge and negligible hysteresis. These results further confirm that the PMMA:C60 passivation layer can reduce trap sites and nonradiative recombination at the interface, leading to an enhancement in the Voc. Improved charge transfer can also be verified from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements (Fig. 6c). The M–S plot of capacitance versus frequency was measured at 10 kHz. The space charge density is inversely proportional to the fitting linear slope of the M–S curve, meanwhile the built-in potential (Vbi) can be derived from the intercept on the X-axis. The high capacitance value of the control device is related to the relentless accumulation of charge carriers at the ETL/perovskite interface. The reduced capacitance of the target device indicates that the process of charge trapping and detrapping is suppressed, which can be attributed to the PMMA:C60 passivation layer. Furthermore, the Vbi value based on the target device (1.01 V) is greater than that of the control device (0.97 V), which explains the higher Voc observed for the target device. This would facilitate the charge extraction processes, and is in agreement with our TRPL analyses.
Ion migration is related to the defects in the perovskite film, hence the trap density of the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 films based on the control and target device were investigated via space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) tests. As shown in Fig. 6d, the ohmic contact and trap fill regions can be evidently observed in the logarithmic plot of the I–V characteristics. In the SCLC model, the density of trap states can be roughly estimated based on the equation , where e, nt, d, ε and ε0 are the electron charge, trap density, device thickness, dielectric constant and dielectric constant of the perovskite material, respectively. The Vtfl values are 0.87 and 0.67 V for the control and target devices, respectively. The trap density was calculated to be 7.01 × 1015 cm−3 for the control device and 5.60 × 1015 cm−3 for the target device. The reduction of trap density can attribute to the smooth, pinhole-free perovskite film with enlarged grain size and passivation of grain boundaries. Thus, the SCLC measurements confirm the formation of a high-quality perovskite film treated with PTABr, which led to a higher PCE and FF of the corresponding PSC, provide evidence to support our findings from the PL and M–S measurements.
To investigate the interface charge transfer and recombination processes, we measured the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) based on the control and target device.Fig. 6e shows the Nyquist plots of the control and target device with an applied bias voltage of 1.1 V close to the Voc under dark conditions and the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S12. The semicircles in the low and high frequency regions can be assigned to recombination resistance (Rrec) and contract resistance (Rco), respectively. Compared with the control device (41.9 Ω), the Rco of the target device is reduced to 24.6 Ω (Table S6), promoting electron transfer at the ETL/perovskite interface in the target device. Meanwhile, the Rrec of the target device is 1642.0 Ω, greater than that of the control (507.7 Ω). The greater Rrec value means that the charge recombination is efficaciously inhibited. Additionally, the variations in Rrec as a function of the applied voltage are shown in Fig. S13.Fig. 6f displays the Nyquist plots of the control and target devices measured under illumination conditions, with the equivalent circuit displayed in Fig. S14. In Table S7, the contract resistance of the target device (Rco = 309.6 Ω) is lower than that of the control device (Rco = 458.9 Ω). The recombination resistance of the target device (Rrec = 5368.8 Ω) is much greater than that of the control device (Rrec = 3054.0 Ω), further demonstrating that the charge transport is improved and carrier recombination is inhibited in the target device. Thus, the photoelectric measurement results verify that interface passivation and grain boundary engineering lead to a high-performance planar PSC with negligible hysteresis due to decreased trap-assisted charge recombination and improved electron transfer.
Long-term stability is a key issue, especially for planar PSCs. We, therefore, traced the stability of the unpackaged control and target devices at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S15a, the PCE of the control device degrades gradually and retains ∼80% of its highest value after 500 h. The target PSC shows excellent long-term stability and retains 95% of its initial PCE after being aged for 500 h. Moreover, the target cell also exhibits excellent anti-humidity stability when exposed to atmospheres with a relative humidity of 20–80% for 1000 h (Fig. S15). Such excellent air environment stability is attributed to the compact PMMA:C60 passivation layer, in which the crosslinked network of PMMA protects the device from the influences of oxygen and moisture.

In summary, we demonstrate a universal strategy combining interface passivation and grain boundary engineering to eliminate hysteresis and enhance photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs, regardless of perovskite composition. The PMMA:C60 passivation layer enables the formation of a smooth, dense and pinhole-free perovskite film, hence reducing charge accumulation and recombination losses at the trap sites at the ETL/perovskite interface. Post-treatment with PTABr significantly enlarges the grain size and reduces the density of grain boundaries of the perovskite film. The synergistic effects of both approaches promote the PCEs up to 18.99%, 19.82%, 21.41% and greatly reduce the hysteresis with HI values of 0.011, 0.007, 0.005 for MAPbI3-, CsFAPbI3- and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3-based devices, respectively. Our work provides an effective and universal strategy by which to circumvent the I–V hysteresis in planar PSCs.


All chemicals were used without further purification. ITO glass substrates (15 Ω cm−2) were purchased from ShenZhen South China Xiang Science & Technology Company Limited. SnO2 colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion), CsI (99.999%), and PbI2 (99.9985%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. C60 and PCBM were acquired from Luminescence Technology Corp. FAI was purchased from Great cell Solar Materials. DMSO (99.7%), chlorobenzene (99.8%) was purchased from J&K Chemical. Spiro-OMeTAD (>99%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. CsI (99.999%), PbI2 (99.9985%), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.95%), acetonitrile (99.8%), and IPA (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr, 98%) was purchased from 3A chemical.

The ITO/glass substrate was washed carefully with ethanol, deionized water and isopropanol, respectively, and eventually treated using an ultraviolet-ozone surface cleaning instrument for 20 minutes. Deionized water was used to dilute a 15 wt% SnO2 colloidal dispersion to 2.67 wt%. A spin coater was set up (3000 rpm, 30 s) to spin-coat a SnO2 solution on ITO/glass substrates, then the SnO2 was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. A spin coater was set up to spin-coat a PMMA:C60 (1:1 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) passivation layer on the ITO/SnO2 substrates by spinning at 5000 rpm for 30 s, then the PMMA:C60 was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Three different compositions of perovskite films (MAPbI3, Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 and Cs0.15FA0.75MA0.1PbI3) were prepared by dissolving 1.2 M FAI, MAI, CsI and PbI2 in DMSO solvent at 60 °C overnight. For the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 solution, the mass of FAI was 175.3 mg, CsI was 46.8 mg and PbI2 was 553.2 mg. After that, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated via a two-step program (first at 1000 rpm for 10 s, second at 6000 rpm for 30 s). After 24 seconds into the second step, 150 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped on the substrate, then perovskite films were annealed at 130 °C for 3–5 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. 100 μL of PTABr (1 mg mL−1 in IPA) was dropped on the perovskite films, which were then annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. Then, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated (2500 rpm, 30 s) on top of the perovskite layer, made up of 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (520 mg LiTFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, 70 nm of the Ag top electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum.

The perovskite film morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-6701F) and atom force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Metrology Nanoscope III-D). The crystallinity of the perovskite films was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/max 2500 VB25/PC). Absorption spectra of the perovskite films were examined using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. SS-PL and TR-PL measurements were carried out using a photoluminescence spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments) with an excitation wavelength of 470 nm. FTIR spectroscopy measurements were recorded using a commercial FTIR system (Bruker Vertex 70v) in transmission mode. The J–V curves were measured under AM 1.5 G sunlight with 100 mW cm−2 light output using a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A class, America, calibrated by a Newport reference cell) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The effective area of the PSC was 0.04 cm2. The IPCE spectra were obtained using an Oriel model QE-PV-SI system equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. All SCLC tests were measured at room temperature under dark conditions. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on a Zahner electrochemical work station set to a frequency of 106 Hz in the dark state, with the bias voltage set to 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1 V. The EIS setting frequency under illumination was 106 Hz, and the bias voltage was set to 1.1 V.


First-principle calculations related to the electronic properties of PMMA molecule were performed using the DMol3 code. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in combination with the double numerical basis sets (DNP) was used to calculate nonlocal gradient corrections to the correlation and exchange energies. All electrons were included in the calculation. The SCF convergence accuracy was set to 1.0 × 10−5 Ha. The convergence thresholds for energy, force, and displacement were set as 2.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.004 Ha Å−1, and 0.005 Å, respectively. We used a 0.005 Ha smearing on electronic orbital occupancy and the global orbital cut-off was set as 3.3 Å, simultaneously. For other parameters, the default settings were used. The isosurface display degree of the electrophilic Fukui Function was 0.05.

In addition, periodic DFT models performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP.5.4.1) were used to study the passivation mechanism of the PMMA monomer molecule on the surfaces of bulk PbI2. The reparameterized Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (revPBE) form functional with GGA was used to calculate nonlocal gradient corrections to the correlation and exchange energies. The energy cut-off of the expansional plane waves was set to 450 eV. The electron–ion interactions in the core region were described using Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials with real space projection operators. A 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling in the surface Brillouin zone was performed for the surfaces and a vacuum layer of 20 Å was set to avoid interactions between the periodic structures. For accuracy, the density of states (DOS) was calculated at a k-point of 5 × 5 × 1. Geometric optimization was performed using a 4-layer PbI2 model of 96 atoms, with the bottom two layers being fixed. Structural optimization carried out at a tight convergence of 0.01 eV Å−1 on the forces with the wave functions converged to 1 × 10−5 eV. In order to accurately describe the dispersion interactions between the adsorbate and the surface, all calculations were performed using the Rutgers–Chalmers van der Waals Density Functional (vdW-DF) method, which can provide a certain reliability for studying the adsorption process.
