In this review, we aim to explore the structure–property relationships of a library of Y-series non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), their current advances, and present systematic (chemical modification) understanding, which have led to the development of effective electron acceptors for use in organic solar cell (OSC) applications. NFAs are a new field, where Y-series acceptors a have greater performance than other NFAs. Herein, we review the representative identities of the active layers of Y-series NFAs and their corresponding morphology, which can be tuned by adjusting various structural parameters such as their center donor core, side chains, and terminal acceptor end groups. This review focuses on various processing techniques including thermal annealing and special additives, solvents, and process conditions used to improve the efficiency of organic Y-series NFAs toward highly efficient and stable OSCs. We also highlight the opportunities made possible by the Y-series NFAs by outlining the challenges and future development directions of OSCs.

The development of energy from renewable sources to replace traditional fossil energy remains relevant in the 21st century. Although there is an abundance of clean energy sources, they all come from solar energy. Accordingly, the economically feasible silicon-based solar cells have emerged, which covert solar energy into electricity. Organic solar cell (OSC) research was in its infancy when fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM, PC71BM, and ICBA were utilized as electron acceptors. Subsequently, achievements from experiments were key to making OSCs an established technology. Similar to fullerene-OSCs, highly dynamic high-charge-carrier materials are critical for efficient thick-film non-fullerene acceptor organic solar cells (NFA-OSCs), which are also important as photoactive materials. However, NFA-based OSCs are more effective in comparison to fullerene-based OSCs in terms of achieving greater power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). There has been a drastic improvement in the synthesis of organic small-molecular NFAs in the last few years. Desirable molecules should possess the following characteristics: (1) strong and wide absorption across the wavelength range of 400–850 nm, (2) high molar extinction coefficient (εmax), (3) narrow band gap and energy levels consistent with the donor material, achieving a high Voc, (4) high electron mobility, and (5) high solubility.

Standard NFAs, such as those possessing an extended multi-fused electron-rich core with two electron-deficient portions on the opposite sides, tend to have high efficiency. One type of acceptor developed with electron-deficient units includes rylene diimide (and derivatives), indacenodithiophene (IDT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT). Significantly, the development of high-performance OSCs has undoubtedly been realized with the use of IDT-functionalized n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors. However, the fact that n-OS star acceptors possess much higher electron mobility and lower optical band-gaps appears to have been overlooked or underestimated. To fulfil the new PCE goal of above 20% and the commercialization of OSCs, development and coupling with Y-family organic NFAs are necessary. In this review, we examine the use of benzothiadiazole (BT) units to build electron-deficient donor–acceptor–donor (DADs) core-based structures that are optimized for operation in OSC applications. The use of a DAD-fused core can result in a relatively planar structure, instead of a twisted one, and thus reduce wave function distortion in the system, facilitating the movement of electrons from the donor to the acceptor. It should be noted that thermal annealing and solvent vapor treatment can be employed to decrease the radiative recombination, charge generation and transport.
Herein, we focus on summarizing the latest developments in Y-series electron acceptors and their effects on light absorption, optical band-gaps, energy levels, and film morphologies. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells hold enormous potential to challenge traditional photovoltaic technology in an era where NFAs are rapidly developing. In this perspective, we focus on the design and development of the three molecular sections that make up these molecules, i.e., the center donor core, side chain, and end groups, which are highlighted as the main principles of molecular design. Lastly, the photoelectric characteristics, photovoltaic performance, and film shape of these molecules are introduced. It is possible to achieve the production of highly efficient small molecular organic NFAs if they possess a variety of physical and optical properties that can be altered by making structural alterations to their chemical architectures, which are described in detail below. Finally, new ways to advance OSCs will be suggested, bringing new possibilities to the table.

OSCs with a sandwich structure contain electrodes, light active layers and interface layers. A breakthrough was the advent of OSCs with the donors and acceptors blended in a single active layer. The properties of the active layer greatly impact the performance of OPVs. OSCs provide excitons with a shorter diffusion distance and a lower recombination probability, which can improve their performance. Three parameters decide the PCE of OSCs including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF).

In general, OSCs are built using a transparent electrode and a back electrode, each creating a separate junction. To facilitate the flow of mobile charge carriers, a single-junction cell device can be made in either a standard or inverted orientation. A hole-carrying substance (p-type) is blended with an electron acceptor (n-type) to form a BHJ device. In optoelectronic devices, the optoelectronic behavior involves five essential steps including absorption of photons, diffusion of excitons, separation of charges, transport of charges, and collection of charges. To construct the resultant active layer, two distinct electrodes, commonly ITO as the anode and aluminium as the cathode, are used in a sandwich structure (Fig. 1A and B). In the conventional–structural solar cell, the free holes are collected by the transparent electrode. Conversely, in the inverted solar cell, the free holes and mobile electrons are collected. Extensive testing has been conducted over the years to determine the best possible configurations for maximizing light-harvesting, current collection and excitation migration transfer.
Following the example set by the BHJ design, the OSC structure has now become an extremely popular and widely accepted architecture. In the functioning of a BHJ, the system follows a chain of consecutive mechanisms. When a photon is absorbed, an exciton (an electron–hole) is created at the material-enriched regions. Excitation of the electron occurs when the freshly produced exciton migrates to the donor–acceptor interface and transfers energy to the electron. An exciton is generated in the initial stage of the reaction. Subsequently, charge transfer states known as polaron pairs are formed, and thus the free charge carriers may be entirely discharged. The free charge carriers diffuse into the active layer materials, and then diffuse through the electrodes to the ends of the circuit, thereby creating an electric current. It is critical that all these processes function correctly for the solar cell to be more efficient. Thus, there has been enormous effort devoted to the creation of novel materials, processing methods, and device design. Many reports have covered the various developments in BHJ-OSCs and related fields in modern literature. As a result of developing higher performance novel donor and acceptor materials and better quality charge transport layers, such as the hole transporting layers (HTLs) and electron transporting layers (ETLs), the efficiency of OSCs has increased incrementally. The inserted charge transport layers enhance charge extraction, which results in an increase in overall efficiency and suppresses the leakage currents that arise owing to opposing charge movement. The charge transport layers have a substantial impact on the long-term stability of OSCs.

Conjugated compounds that have linked conjugated polymers (π) play a major role in a wide range of products, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), thin-film organic transistors, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The enormous development in the field of OSCs over the last five years has drawn significant attention to this developing technology for the capture of renewable energy. Also, the advancement of polymer donors has made them a major component in bulk hetero-junction layers because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and their outstanding processability for film deposition. Therefore, a comprehensive review is necessary to discuss their molecular design, aggregation behavior, and photovoltaic properties. The development of polymer donors that complement the absorption spectrum of specific acceptors will keep the quantum efficiency limit high. The efficiency of BHJ solar cells has been improved with the use of wide band-gap/near infrared (WBG/NIR) polymer donors. WBG/NIR donor materials have a distinct chemical composition, giving them advantageous rheological and morphological characteristics, where they minimize energy loss during charge production. This allows the more flexible adjustment of the optical band-gap, energy levels, and charge transport properties compared to the conventional wide band-gap (WBG) polymer (P3HT: poly(3-hexylthiophene)).

The molecular packing (crystal structure and morphology) of a polymer donor influences its optoelectronic characteristics and controls the photovoltaic processes and overall PCE of OSC devices. In this study, we identify polymer donor materials that enable the fabrication of high-performance non-fullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSCs). From a donor polymer perspective, there are numerous suitable fullerene-matching polymer donors, which can be used in the near future. Some of these polymers are as follows (1) polythiophene derivatives; (2) copolymers based on benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT); (3) copolymers based on benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD); and (4) copolymers based on benzotriazole (BTz).Tables 1–3 list the device parameters of the pertinent NFA-OSCs, while Fig. 2 depicts the chemical structures of the donor materials.
Improvements in the chain length and regiochemistry of BDT and TT were key to the success of the PTB polymer, especially in BDT substitutions of S with Se and in the inclusion of side chains in the TT and BDT units. DTP-based polymers exhibit increased carrier mobility, making them suitable for use in NIR solar cells, and thereby improve the device performance. A significant achievement in the fabrication of OSCs emerged with the discovery of PTB7-Th. Conjugated polymers are often defined by alternating electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units connected by a π-bridge or less common, without a bridge. Many different D–π–A conjugated polymers have been developed in the past few years and successfully conjugated with various acceptor materials. Numerous conjugated A units have been employed for the production of conjugated polymers thus far, for example, BDD (benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dine), BT (benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione), DPP (diketopyrrolopyrrole), Qx (quinoxaline), BTA (benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-diamine), PhI (phthalimide), and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), and others.
However, there have been limited studies on the development of BT-based copolymers as NF OSC donors. The BTz unit, which features an extra site to connect a solubilizing alkyl chain, is produced when the sulphur atom in the BT unit is replaced by nitrogen. Fortunately, this type of polymer exhibits great performances by working in combination with NFA devices that have small bandgaps. Given that the importance of BTz-based copolymers is increasing in the NFA-OSC research field, it has become necessary to evaluate the benefits of using these polymers. In addition to the success of J51, comprehensive systematic side chain engineering has been performed on copolymers based on bithienyl-BDT and FBTz to further improve polymer donors for use in NF OSCs, leading to a series of wide-bandgap polymers such as J52, J60, J61, J71, and J91.
The success of this investigation proved that a side chain method may be effective to improve the photovoltaic performance of donor materials when combined with NFAs. Herein, we emphasize the crucial balance among the band-gap, aggregation, and photovoltaic characteristics of the donor material in the different sections. The use of WBG polymer donors has considerably enhanced the PCE of OSCs (Fig. 3). The link among the donor polymer structure, properties and cell performance for a given acceptor is very complicated, including multiple aspects, but is crucial for the creation of high-performance polymer donors, which can help achieve high PCEs. All these polymers have been proven to be much better than their traditional counterparts in NFA solar cells. Herein, we present a set of useful guiding concepts and methodologies for the design and processing of novel polymer donors to create high-performance OSCs.

In the case of fullerene acceptors (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM), it has been historically found that their isotropic transmission and strong electron affinity consistently bring them to the forefront. Due to the fast advancement in OSCs at the beginning of the 21st century, organic photoactive materials (particularly new-emerging organic NFAs) have greatly benefited OPV cells. Recently, numerous organic small molecular NFAs have had a big influence on the performance of OSCs due to their acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type fused-group. Given that the charge mobility, film morphology, and other criteria are important in these advanced NFAs, significant research efforts have been devoted to investigating A–D–A type NFAs. An electron-rich central core D unit (for example, indacenodithiophene (IDT), indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), and benzodithiophene (BDT)) is utilized in A–D–A-type NFAs. Many scientists and researchers have agreed that the chemical structures of the D and A units can influence the degree of energy, absorption coefficient, and shape of the resulting NFAs. This means that to improve the performance of the device, it is essential to critically consider the design of new acceptors. The majority of A–D–A NFAs have poor NIR absorption, which decreases the efficiency of solar radiation conversion.

The new Y-series NFAs, which are more commonly known as Y6, have contributed greatly to the recent advances in OSCs, with their PCE rocketing from 11% to almost 17% during the last year. Non-covalent interactions, such as H-bonding, allow additional chances for inter- and intramolecular coordination, such as on a planar molecule, for a merged “D” and “A” unit to have longer conjugation lengths via the utilization of fused “D” and “A” unit spacer units. After a long period, A–DA′D–A-type Y-series acceptors (such as Y6) are bringing OSCs one step closer to becoming commercially available. Understanding the reasons that Y6 gives rise to high PCEs is important because it will allow the future development of more advanced and versatile NFA designs, help identify logical adjustment guidelines for new material cores, and help designs progress to large-scale processing. The developing Y6 acceptors are not as well studied as earlier generations of ITICs but it is considered that Y6 acceptors have worse light absorption, higher electron mobility in the ambient environment, low internal reorganization energies, and improved OSC operating endurance (Fig. 4). Other advanced, cutting-edge, and specialized design concepts that have been applied in current OSCs include those for adjusting the electron energy levels and aggregation behavior in solar cells. One of the benefits of Y-series NFAs is that their features can be simply altered via chemical modification of either their terminal A unit or alkyl side chain.

In this section, we focus on the introduction of nitrogen-bridged fused centre cores devoid of electrons, such as benzothiadiazole, benzotriazole, and quinoxaline, and the effect of their presence on the outcomes. A C2 symmetric A–DA′D–A structure based on a fused core containing a nitrogen atom in the pyrrole motif is an ideal match for an NFA. The high-performance Y-series NFAs for solar applications that are needed for nuclear families are designed by utilizing this molecular design process. The higher hole transfer driving power in the PBDB-T/Y1-4F combination results in a significantly longer charge transfer lifetime than that in three other blends. In addition, the charge transfer state decays rapidly in 10 ns, which is consistent with the weak Jsc observed. Moreover, it has been determined that the central core of organic SMAs has a much greater impact on the photovoltaic efficiency of the side chains and end groups. Benzotriazole-based conjugated compounds are frequently employed as building blocks for increasing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of single-component luminous materials. To accomplish this, benzotriazole is employed to make an A–DA′D–A unit, which is a nonoxidizing core with an electron deficit. To improve both the physical and chemical properties of photovoltaic materials, numerous molecular design principles have been discovered and refined over time (Fig. 5). Also, the ladder-type core design, which has shown significant improvement in the case of PCE and cost, is a notable improvement. Because of the incorporation of heteroatoms, such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and selenium (Se), these strands may be customized to various lengths. Consequently, Y6 has become a prominent molecular design tool, which is implemented several notable techniques. At the tail end of the central core, the Y6 side chains are more soluble than that on the exterior, and they also aid in reducing the number of conformational isomers. Thus, to create a finely tuned set of devices, it is a revolutionary design technique to place benzotriazole in the electron-donating core, close to the D–A molecule, with the purpose of optimizing the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. NFA (Y6) molecules have varying energy levels due to their various processing conditions and deposition techniques, which only determine their optoelectronic characteristics (Fig. 6A and B).

In 2017, Feng et al. developed a D–π–A–π–D-type ladder multi-fused BTz core based on a popular electron acceptor. Adjacent thiophene and benzotriazole were consolidated into one entity to shift the absorption coefficient in the visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) region. A strategy has been used to establish the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of BZIC of −3.88 eV, while sustaining a multi-fused BTz and INCN. According to the results of photoaging tests, binary and ternary OSCs degrade at different rates. Burn-in loss of roughly 50% of the original PCE was seen in the binary OSCs of PFBDT-8ttTPD:IT-4F and PFBDT-8ttTPD:Y6 within the first 50 h of operation for each of these systems. This high burn-in loss in efficiency was largely due to the severe degradation of the Jsc and FF. In contrast, both ternary OSCs of PFBDT-8ttTPD:IT-4F:PC71BM and PFBDT-8ttTPD:Y6:PC71BM exhibited long-term photostability without burn-in loss for up to 500 h. Similarly, Liu et al. found that conjugated (PBDB-T-H) polymers, which contained three distinct end groups (i.e., Br-, OMe-, and T), had similar absorption spectra and crystallinity, but very different photovoltaic performances in NFA-OSCs (Y6). The Jsc and FF of the PBDB-T-H-based cells were higher than that of the functionalized polymer-based cells. Thus, the fact that the Br and T units contributed to the exponential increase in the additive effect can be witnessed here. It was determined that the addition of F and S atoms to the thiophene side chain had no influence on the photovoltaic performance using three Qx-based p-type polymers, i.e., PE61, PE62, and PE63, to which they were applied. For holes, the device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, while for electrons, it was ITO/TiOx/active layer/Al. PE61, PE62, and PE63 all had a rise in e and h, which went from 1.40 × 10−4 and 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.15 × 10−4 and 1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Because of the increased charge carrier mobility in the PE62- and PE63-based devices, the photovoltaic performance was greatly improved. Surprisingly, when matched with the fused ring electron acceptor (FREA) Y6, the chlorine-free PTBT-based OSCs demonstrated a negligible PCE of 3.88%, while PTBT-Cl demonstrated a respectable PCE of 12.31%, with a concurrently increased Jsc of 23.73 mA cm−2 and FF of 62.53%.
A novel imide-functionalized quinoxaline (QI) moiety was used as the central building block in two new NFAs, namely QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl. The P2FEHp-based QIP-4Cl device exhibited an efficiency of 13.3% and impressive Voc of 0.94. Additionally, where the non-chlorinated solvent 2-methoxyethanol (2-MeTHF) resulted in a better film morphology, PS1 had better light harvesting, energy levels, and morphology as a blend. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency ranks among the highest values recorded for electron acceptors based on quinoxaline that have a fused ring structure in binary OSCs. PE2 can be considered to have a down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), higher crystallinity, and bigger and more powerful π–π stacking than J52-FS, and thus PE2:Y6 delivered a better performance (Voc = 0.83 V, Jsc = 23.23, and FF = 0.70) than that of J52-FS:Y6 (Voc = 0.83 V, Jsc = 22.92, and FF = 0.57). Researchers are working on developing and synthesising weak core-fused semiconductors with an electron-deficient acceptor, Y5. In the wavelength range of 700–900 nm, they are highly absorbent, with an extinction value of 1.24 × 10−5 cm−1 and electron mobility of 2.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Alternatively, the systems fabricated with thermal-treated PM6:TPQx-6F demonstrated a PCE of 14.62% because of the simultaneously improved Jsc and FF. The most significant origin of the higher performance of this device compared to its TPQx-4F counterpart is the more homogenous phase separation and increased dissociation efficiency of the fluorinated substitution TPQx-6F. Changes in the PBDB-TF/Y6 vertical phase separation reduced the bottom surface roughness and improved the electronic contact between the device electrodes as a result of the vertical migration of Y6 towards the BHJ film top surface. This characteristic feature was beneficial for efficient transmission and charge collection when the donor polymer (PBDB-T-2F) is blended with a small HOMO energy offset. Surprisingly, annealing did not alter the molecular orientations, film crystallinity, R-SoXS size, and relative average phase purity, and increased the electronic contact between the device electrodes.
With an increase in the low molecular weight fraction (LMWFs), the PCE of PM6:Y6 dropped from over 15% to 5% due to the decline in Jsc and FF values caused by the reduced charge transport, greater bulk trap densities, lower competition factors, and impaired charge generation efficiencies. However, compared to the PM10Si and PM30Si-based films, the blend film of PM20Si:Y6 demonstrated a more suitable phase state, preferable molecular orientation, and more balanced hole and electron transport. Owing to the asymmetric molecular design strategies, three representative molecular conformations for Y6-type NFAs were obtained by regulating the lateral thiophene orientation of the fused core. Consequently, the OSCs fabricated with PM6:BP4T-4F, PM6:BP5T-4F, and PM6:ABP4T-4F showed a high PCE of 17.1%, 16.7%, and 15.2%, respectively. Y18-ID was designed and synthesized with BTz as the A unit and hexyl-1H-indole (ID) rather than just the traditional 2-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) as D the unit. To achieve a PCE of 15.25%, the solvent vapor annealing (SVA)-treated P:Y18-ID-based OSCs used in this study achieved a lower energy loss of 0.51 eV compared to the untreated ones. A new non-fullerene acceptor called Y21, bearing an asymmetric electron-deficient-core (DA′D) and fluorinated dicyanomethylene derivatives, was constructed with the use of DA′D and fluorinated dicyanomethylene derivatives as flanking groups. Consequently, it differs from being perfectly C2 symmetric and its molecular geometry becomes asymmetric.
The highest possible PCE of the halogenated thiophene-substituted polymer donor OSCs was 15.05% for PFBDT-8ttTPD:Y6 and 11.12% for PClBDT-8ttTPD:IT-4F. The results revealed that PBDT-Cl:Y6 had decreased trap density and enhanced charge carrier abilities, in addition to a lower recombination rate, which led to the conclusion that the recombination behavior is slowed and the exciton lifetimes are extended. BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F worked well in conjunction with the wide-band-gap polymer donor P2F-Ehp containing an imide-functionalized BTz moiety, where a PCE of nearly 16% was achieved with P2F-Ehp:BTPTT-4F due to the sophisticated blend film morphology optimization. It was found that after 500 mixing cycles, the normalized PCEs for PM6-Mw:Y6 and PDI PM6-Mw:Y6 retained 30–50% of their initial performances. With an increase in Mw or PDI, flexible devices continuously exhibit improved mechanical stability. Additionally, blends with high molecular weight (MW) PM6 polymers tend to have better photo-oxidation stability and mechanical and storage stabilities than other PM6-Mw:Y6 systems. The 16.42% PCE obtained from the active layer in a single-junction OSC was attributed to the proper balance between crystallinity and miscibility afforded by FE-T.
The light absorption profiles and charge carrier mobility of polymers can be greatly affected by the location of the fluorine atom, according to theoretical calculations and wide-angle X-ray scattering data. Consequently, the planar polymer PTzBI-dF showed a substantially higher power conversion efficiency of 16.8% when paired with NFAs (Y6) than its twisted counterpart PTzBI-pF. In the latest PTzBI-dF devices, the ternary method yielded a milestone efficiency of 17.3%, indicating the strategic utility of modifying the sites of halogen substitution in conjugated polymers to facilitate their inclusion in highly efficient OSCs. The mass production of roll-to-roll processing, such as in flat-roll production, can be difficult given that it takes a long time for the material to cool after the annealing process. Additionally, SVA treatment of chloroform-impregnated device parts will boost the π–π stacking of D18 and the acceptors, which will help to improve the device performance. The molecular morphology can be modified with a simple but effective molecular design process without affecting the polymer absorption or energy levels according to research findings. This technique can address the molecular packing and aggregation features. Consequently, the Y6-based active layers and the associated physical processes of devices can be further optimized, resulting in an increase in FF and PCE, respectively. The comparison of the PCE and FF of the PM6-Tz20 OSC with that of the PM6-based OSC showed that the former had much better results. The PCE of the champion increased to 17.6% by using Ag (220 nm) as a cathode instead of Al, which increased the photocurrent (100 nm). A two-step sequential deposition process was created to regulate the morphology of the active layer. After forming a polymer fibril structure in the first stage of the polycondensation process, the second step was introducing an NFA into the fibril mesh, resulting in a high efficiency of 16.5%. When a new thiophene-thiazolothiazole (TTz) ratio was implemented, this created a modulation of the energy level, where an increase in the voltage level was discovered, which was possible because of the higher Voc achieved. Moreover, it had limited miscibility with the acceptor at the surface, owing to the tuning of the surface energy. The Urbach energy of sulfur (Y6) is significantly lower, at about 20.4 meV. Additionally, Y6Se is considerably more absorbent, exhibits greater electron mobility, and has better intrinsic photostability. This Urbach energy (20.4 meV) for Y6Se is incredibly close to that of several inorganic/hybrid alternatives. The PCE of D18:Y6Se solar cells at around 17.7% is impressive compared to the best values in the literature and also for no post-treatment D18:Y6Se solar cells in the literature (Table 1).

The research and design of active materials such as NFAs and promoters has seen a surprising evolution within a short time, but their use has led to the creation of new issues regarding the photophysical processes that occur in OSCs, which are related to the exciton diffusion and separation processes at the acceptor–donor interface. Recently, researchers have discovered that more efficient non-fullerene OSCs can be fabricated in terms of power. OSCs using fullerene as the acceptor receive charges more easily than the new style of OSCs, which separates and generates charges with less driving pressure. A new set of highly regarded Y acceptors is ideal for designing terminal A groups to allow the “end-to-end” stacking of the electron transport channels, such as those recently identified, which in turn opens up many possibilities for the modification of molecular structure to improve the performance of non-fullerene OSCs. Additionally, the optical characteristics of NFAs with different polymer donors, including the OPV device parameters are listed in Table 2. Terminal engineering is more versatile than core engineering and alkyl chain engineering, which can influence the energy levels, absorption, shape, and charge dynamics.

A range of electron acceptors can take advantage of strong electron-pulling effects, but improved electron-catalyzed action can also aid in decreasing the energy levels, shifting the absorption and intensity, and increasing the extinction coefficients. Industry in the future will depend on photovoltaic devices, notably in relation to efficiency and reliability. It was found that π-bridges may be used to enhance the functionality of NFA-based OSCs. Other commonly used π-bridge units are alkoxyl or alkylthio thiophene, selenophene, and cyclopentadithiophene. The alternating groups on the components of this conjugated molecule are known to reduce the overall planarity of the molecule. When functional group modifications are performed on highly conjugated electron-deficient molecules, it is possible to create new compounds that are inspired by the Y series through capping the functional group alterations. Halogen atoms may change the characteristics of materials, such as their absorbance and energy levels, by introducing a chemical reaction that results in a greater number of halogen atoms being present. When adding a halogen to electron-accepting units, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects and band-gaps of non-fullerene tiny molecule acceptors are enhanced, while the charge transfer losses are reduced. Although it is acknowledged that fluorine is commonly employed as the lowest electron-withdrawing group, it is notably utilized when changing the donor or acceptor properties of donor and acceptor materials. In addition to helping molecules align more planarly, fluorine is utilized to enhance intermolecular interactions. Even though tiny molecules in a study were found to incorporate fluorine in the non-conjugated units of the central core, the performance of the device was lower than that of the OSCs with conjugated fused rings. To achieve a high-quality performance, the most utilized method is the creation of a photoactive layer material and the construction of a device that can resist mechanical stress.
Although there have been recent advancements in Y-series non-fullerene acceptors, which have aided the creation of more efficient OSCs, research in this area has stalled. The creation of novel non-fullerene acceptors with an A–DA′D–A type structure (NFAs) may stimulate more study into how non-fullerene acceptors function in OSCs (Fig. 7). The study by Cheng et al. on the narrow-band-gap acceptor Y1 (based on the novel donor moiety BZPT) sparked interest in the potential application and development of Y1 acceptors in the near future.
To expand the Y-series NMR analyzers (BTP-1, BTP-2, BTP-3, and BTP-4V), Yan's team placed vinylene bridges between a Y-series core fused structure and a non-halogenated group at the end of the molecule. The bandgap of this series of NFAs was dramatically smaller with a red shift of just about 1020 nm, which incorporated vinylene π-bridges. Hole-only and electron-only systems with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend film/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/blend film/PNDITF3N/Al architectures were tested. With the dark J–V curves of these devices as a guide, we were able to accurately determine the charge carrier mobility. It was found that the PBDB-T/BTP-1V blend film had the most evenly distributed mobilities among the three PCE10/BTP-2V, PCE10-BTP-3V and PCE-10-BTP-4V blend films. This is a major factor in the high Jsc and FF values of the devices, which can be attributed to the balanced mh–me ratio of 0.93 in the PBDB-T/BTP-1V blend film. A change in the chemical composition of the “A” unit has an effect on the photo-physical properties of NFAs, also resulting in a change in their electrochemical and photovoltaic properties (Fig. 8A and B).
Although little interest has been paid to the bromination of OSCs, this idea is an avenue of study that is worth considering. Fluorine and chlorine atoms also have comparable noncovalent interactions and electron-withdrawing ability. The brominated acceptors BTIC-BO-4Br and BTIC-2Br-m had the length of their alkyl chains adjusted and the number of bromine substituents changed. However, new research has the potential to result in the development of superior brominated materials that may increase the performance of organic solar systems. The hole and electron mobilities of the devices (ITO/ZnO/PBDB-TF:acceptors/PDINO/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-TF:acceptors/MoO3/Ag) based on BTIC-4Br, BTIC-BO-4Br, and BTIC-2Br-m with PBDB-TF were as follows: 4.8 × 10−5/1.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.4 × 10−4/4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.9 × 10−4/1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The expansion of the conjugate length may have led to this improvement. According to Zhang et al., two new NFAs with bromine moieties, BZIC-2Br and Y9-2Br, are capable of facilitating light harvesting and reducing the bandgap. The terminal fluorine of the end-group of this molecule is identical to the terminal fluorine of another similar compound. The acceptor was constructed using pyrrolobenzotriazole (BTA based) as the core, which has very high electron mobility together with a very broad absorption wavelength range of 800 nm to 1200 nm. Using an existing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene/benzotriazole covalent connection, the researchers developed a multi-fused benzotriazole-based NIR-active NFA design method, which was found to be easily applied (Y1 and Y2). The novel fusion system made up of benzotriazole is a fantastic example of the NFO design influence.
The Y10 band-gap has been improved to 1.35 eV and its absorption band is in the range of 600 to 900 nm. Moreover, the FF and Jsc values of the corresponding devices with post-treatment were reported to be higher when CN additives and TA treatment were applied, resulting in a homogeneous and nanophase segregated crystalline structure. The terminal groups BTTPC and BTTPC-Br were developed in 2019 to manufacture electron acceptors, which were described by Qin et al. as using both thiophene and bromine units to form aromatic moieties. The distribution of the final exciton dynamics is influenced by the modification of the conjugation length. Faster hole transfer at the interface between the two new acceptors (BTTPC-Br and BTTPC) occurs when the HOMO offset is smaller than that of the Y5 system. The alterations in exciton dynamics are mainly attributed to the structural modification of the terminal aromatics with the electron-rich thiophene, given their similar absorption and mix shape, as well as molecular orientation. With the PBDB-T polymer donor, devices based on BTTPC achieved a PCE of 14.51%, while the devices based on BTTPC-Br achieved a good Jsc of 24.71 mA cm−2 and PCE of 15.22%. A novel family of hybrid OSC materials has been created with a short hole transfer of just a few nanometers, consisting of a single-chlorinated thieno- or beryllium-containing NFA (BTCT-2Cl) paired with PM6. This new material can achieve an efficiency of 15.5%. Further examination of the scattering profiles revealed that PM6:Y6 processed with CF:CB co-solvent has a greater overall scattering than that handled with CB solvent alone. As a result of this investigation, we concluded that the choice of processing solvents enables the D/A interfacial area to be altered and the aggregation of molecules fine-tuned, ultimately affecting the ordering of big crystals. It has been demonstrated that the CF:CB co-solvent may reduce molecular aggregation and crystallization, thereby generating a more balanced phase separation and higher phase purity. Furthermore, the co-solvent technique that was used in two other high-performance PM6-Ir1:BTP-eC9 and PM6:N3 systems was also verified. Unlike Y6, TPT10 has a monobromine substitution rather than a bifluorine substitution, and has a lower LUMO of −3.99 eV and a higher HOMO of −5.52 eV. These OSCs have a high Voc of 0.92 V, but a lower PCE of 9.24% due to the fact that both the PTQ10 donor and TPT10 acceptor have a negative EHOMO. This is because the TPT10 acceptor has a higher-lying ELUMO (3.99 eV), while the PTQ10 donor has a lower-lying EHOMO (0.03 eV). Although the EHOMO value between the donor PTQ11 and acceptor TPT10 is zero, a TPT10-based OSC using PTQ11 as the donor exhibited a high PCE of 16.32%, higher Voc of 0.88 V, higher Jsc of 24.79 mA cm−2 and even higher FF (74.8%). Comparing PTQ10 and PTQ11, PTQ11 has better molecular crystallization and hole transport properties. It is evident that the donor and acceptor absorption quantum efficiencies have greatly improved throughout a wide wavelength range, from the donor and acceptor absorption in binary devices to that in ternary devices. This enables the most efficient OSCs to achieve an efficiency of 17.03%. For the large-scale manufacture of commercial OSCs, a number of critical criteria exist, where one is avoiding the use of non-halogenated solvents (OSCs). Although the present state of the art OSCs (PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl) are mostly made using halogenated solvents due to their better solubility and shape, they may still be made with no solvents. Thus, it is a significant part of this study to create unique and simple procedure that are demonstrated to work for non-fullerene acceptors to ensure that their crystal size is optimal. Furthermore, a new record-high PCE of 17.33% was reached, which is significantly higher than solvent processing in the past using halogen-free solvents. With a third component, it was shown to be possible to overcome these problems using an absorbance spectrum, LUMO level range, and bandgap that are all within the range of the donor and acceptor components. It is likely that the lower crystallinity of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:ITCC blends is responsible for their lower electron and hole mobilities (3.3 × 10−4 and 5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) and lower FFs than that of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blends. We found a link between chemical structure and bulk morphology using molecular electrostatic potential distributions. This research demonstrated that altering the functional groups has a significant impact on both the molecular orientation at the D–A interface and the domain purity of the blend. It is beneficial to increase the D–A interaction to generate more charges. However, low domain purity and enhanced charge transformation due to hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. The efficiency of OPV cells can be boosted by fine-tuning the bulk morphology, which provides a balance between charge generation and recombination. In 2021, researchers used state-of-the-art NFA systems to conduct a multidimensional investigation and determine the relationship among molecular structures, morphological traits, macrophysical parameters, and gadget performance. An asymmetric terminal design was also shown to be efficient in terms of balancing all the criteria for a high level of efficiency. Increased electron mobility is achieved by reducing the distance and increasing the molecular packing strength of the alkyl side chain; hence, increasing the FF. Consequently, the OPV based on the developed asymmetric acceptor BTP-S9 with a shorter alkyl side chain attained the optimal PCE of 17.56% with a high FF of 78.44%. This was accomplished by acquiring the most benefits possible from the molecular structure and the macroscopic components involved. Obviously, the terminal engineering of Y-series NFAs can have a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance. Also, it is essential to investigate the correlation between the molecular structural factors and excited dynamics of OSCs, which may help address the limits of the OSC performance.

Studies on a variety of Y6 derivatives revealed that their solar cell efficiency gains exceed typical values, even when under direct sunlight irradiation. However, Y6 has several structural features that still need to be investigated. To acquire a better understanding of how its structure is related to its performance, simpler derivative-building approaches are employed. One of the great advantages of OSCs is that they offer easy solution processability, enabling large-area production with scalable printing methods at an affordable cost. In addition, due to the extensive consumption of solution during the spin-coating process and given that it is not possible to mass-produce large volumes of the solution, it is unsuitable for large-scale manufacture. Consequently, the use of OPV materials in large-area manufacturing processes needs to be considered to realize better energy conversion efficiency and important to balance the charge transfer and solution processability (Fig. 9).

For the fabrication of BHJ solar cells, recently researchers have focused on the creation and understanding of soluble organic small molecules. Currently, most Y-series NFA modifications focus on side-chain enhancements but it is equally appealing to innovate their terminals. To improve the solubility of Y-series NFAs, alkyl chains are added to the third position of the left and right thiophene rings connected to the IC terminals. Moreover, the alkyl chains on both sides are beneficial for conformational stability and reduce the energy disorder. Simple but powerful, side chain engineering is a way to adjust the molecular structure of the acceptor Y series, given that it allows the length and branch chain number of the side chain to be controlled, thereby affecting the crystallinity of the active layer.
There are some side-chains connected to the core “D” unit, but they are never attached to the ring “A” to prevent stacked rings. To increase the solubility, the use of side-chains is expected, which utilize a donor core or other processing procedures to solubilize the solution during purification. The number of side chains of organic molecules, regardless of the type of molecule, is related to the number of fused rings that make up the core. Alkyl side chains are comparable to alkyl substituents because they influence the intermolecular interactions and molecular orientation. We propose a simple technique to revise the A–DA′D–A core, making it distinctive by changing its Y-series electrochemical and photovoltaic properties (Fig. 10A and B). The progress is magnificent, but several alterations to the DA′D core have gone unmentioned. According to the rule for OPV design, the following details emerge: Y1-4F coupled with the PBDB-T-F fluorinated polymer donor design rule achieved a champion PCE of 14.8%. For a second system, an identical technique was employed, and it was found that the resulting PCE of 15.9% proved that our strategy is viable.
This description pertains to a chlorine-based NFA with greater optical absorption and higher voltage than a fluorine-based molecule. After the team led by Cui Hou published the preparation of nonfluorinated NFAs, BTP-4Cl, which had a lower-bandgap halogen, it was discovered that fluorine had replaced Y6 (herein named BTP-4F). The OPV cells constructed utilizing the same polymer donor PBDB-TF had a high performance, with active areas of 0.09 and 1 cm2. Also, simpler ways to understand their structural-performance connections and the mechanisms that drive them are being deployed. High-performance oscillators can benefit from their simplicity. Acceptor side chain engineering is easy to implement yet highly helpful for getting very efficient OSCs. The longer Y18-DMO chain has a single short branch chain, while the shorter 2-ethylhexyl chain has two short branches. Chen et al. developed and created photovoltaic devices that were treated using a solution. Following SVA treatment, an optimum solution with a PCE of 14.18% was obtained, resulting in enhanced exciton production, which raised the Jsc and FF and balanced the charge transport. Using the low-bandgap HD-4Cl, Xu et al. synthesized and developed an NFA with alkoxy groups. HDO-4Cl was chemically altered to boost the electron affinity (EA) level by 180 meV and change the absorption spectra by 100 nm (180 mV, spectrum shift by 100 nm). An impressive PCE of 23.4% was achieved by the HDO-4Cl-based cells in a simulated indoor environment irradiated with warm LED light (2700 K, 1000 Lux), while the PCE of the HD-4Cl-based devices was only 19.9%. Compared to devices made using halogenated solvents, the best PCE of the cells (16.1%) was produced with tetrahydrofuran (THF) processing, which is a small fraction of a percent off from that of the devices treated in other solvents. N3-4Cl is a new NFA obtained from pyrrole N-position alkyl side chains after they are substituted with third branched position side chains. Another aspect to consider is that for a good optimization technique, many parameters must be balanced, resulting in the greatest PCE of 16.5% for the PM6:N3-4Cl devices, showing that adjusting the side chains is an effective method for optimizing Voc and aggregation, thereby increasing the device performance. One more advantage of PM6:N3-4Cl-based films is that they create a controlled morphology, which results in high and balanced charge mobility in the blends, allowing for very high and balanced forward force. The higher hole transfer driving power in the PBDB-T/Y1-4F mix resulted in a significantly longer charge transfer lifetime than that in three other blends. In addition, the charge transfer state decayed rapidly within 10 ns, which is consistent with the weak Jsc observed. BTP-4Cl-12 offers balanced solution processability and aggregation characteristics, which are both important when using the blade-coating technique for optimal processing. The composition of the blend film with PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl-12 has a good morphology, aiding in better carrier transport and charge recombination reduction in the OSC.
Improved charge transport was achieved in the related devices as a result of the improved lamellar stacking of the recently synthesized acceptor with alkyl chains that had been replaced with BTP-4F-12. The improved processability of the acceptor allowed us to achieve PCEs of over 14% based on the T1:BTP-4F-12 combination using a variety of environmentally friendly solvents, such as o-xylene, 1,2,4-TMB, and THF. Incredibly, the THF-processed OPV cells achieved a PCE of 16.1%, which is nearly identical to that of the devices manufactured using halogenated solvents. A high PCE of 14.4% was maintained at a 1.07 cm2 active area even when the blade coating approach was applied. In this case, a Y6-based dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole core was used to create and manufacture non-fullerene acceptors by replacing the beta position of the thiophene unit with branched alkyl chains. Changing the alkyl chain length completely changed the molecular packing behavior of the non-fullerene acceptors, resulting in enhanced charge transmission in thin films. Placing bulky branching substituents at the thiophene beta position was considered because of its close proximity to a major stacking event. The 2-butyloctyl side chain of L8-BO provides greater structural order, which aids in the development of an optimal multi-length-scale morphology, resulting in high carrier production, reduced charge recombination, and balanced charge transport. There has been significant progress in the development of high-efficiency NFAs due to the single-junction OSCs based on L8-BO, exhibiting a PCE of 18.32%, FF 81.5%, and Eloss of 0.55 V.
Furthermore, to achieve effective performances, OPV cells must maintain their steady form when the active area of the device is increased. Despite the presence of alkyl side chains, the modified molecules should exhibit a comparable absorption, energy levels, and other electrical properties. Branched side chains, such as those in alkyl NFAs, are associated with intramolecular conformation locking and may exert additional influence on this process. Alternatively, alkyl chains are found on the major components and the main chain functional groups. The solubility of the aromatic-fused rings increases and their entanglement is avoided when branched side chains are introduced in the core of Y14 to enhance the A–D–A-type small molecule acceptors (Fig. 10). This is essential in terms of commercialization based on small molecular organic NFAs for OSC manufacturing using large-area production technologies because it gives significant scientific knowledge.

Y-Series NFA devices have had a significant impact on device efficiency. The greater achievements and more frequent breakthroughs show that Y-series NFA versions can break the dominant position of A–D–A cored derivatives in the area of OSCs, and therefore have emerged as promising candidates for future industrialization. The findings of this study should be useful in a variety of research endeavors because they provide thorough guidance and understanding of the Y-series. Specifically, it will assist the development of novel materials and the application of their newly acquired knowledge. Y6 acceptors have been explored for use in OSC designs that can give a record-breaking level of efficiency. In this review, molecule/chemical structures (Y-family molecules) were studied to see how they may be used to construct donor core units, termination groups, and side chains, which are important for molecular stacking. For the formation of effective non-fullerene acceptors, the rapid growth of electron-deficient chromophore groups is vital. Y-family derivatives have excellent optical and electrochemical properties and exceptional film-forming ability, including advances in molecular design such as core moiety, end groups, and spacers. This study provided an overview of the current advances in the field of solution-processed Y6 and the variations in its synthesis. If the different processing conditions that affect the BHJ morphology evolution is comprehensively considered, it will be easier to understand the connections between the microstructure properties. Y-series NFA research and development focus on the exploration of new electron-deficient cores with improved photovoltaic performances.


A–DA′D–A NFA (A–DA′D–A) molecular design, photovoltaic performance and core designs with center donor component engineering were all factors that we began to examine and analyze. The ability of the acceptor to take electrons is directly influenced by the central donor groups, which boosts the optoelectronic characteristics and photovoltaic performance of the acceptor. The energy levels and molecular packing of electron-deficient cores are typically more diverse. Three alternative electron-deficient core types, i.e., benzotriazole, benzothiadiazole and quinoxaline, have been investigated and developed in recent years in the development of Y-series NFA substrates. Compared to benzothiadiazole and quinoxaline, the molecular orbital limits of benzotriazole are higher because it contains an extra nitrogen atom, which donates an electron.

Another point that should be considered is the extremely efficient optical and electrochemical properties of highly appropriate terminal acceptor functional groups, which we discussed in the second half of this review. Additionally, the electron-attracting actions of halogen atoms and the increase in halogen atoms (such as F, Cl, Br, and I) and aliphatic chains in the terminal acceptor groups result in the lower energy of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), therefore improving the optical and electronic characteristics of molecules and making the electrical qualities of OSC devices better. After π-conjugated backbone attachment, the end groups aid in absorption, electron acceptor characteristics, and overall performance of a molecule as an acceptor.
Longer alkyl chain lengths improve the OPV mix film shape, improving the charge carrier mobility and PCE. By reducing the band gap of the acceptor molecule LUMO level, the absorption can be increased. Alkyl or aromatic groups can be used in molecular engineering to boost the acceptor performance of a molecule. We presented a complete summary of the different chemical acceptors that can boost BHJ solar cells. Modifications to Y-series molecules based on core engineering, alkyl chain engineering, and terminal engineering have been examined and documented, which can affect their molecular shape. Y-series NFAs exhibit different molecular packing tendencies than their ITIC (IDT) family counterparts, resulting in various mixed morphologies and unique chemical structures. The information acquired clearly indicated and confirmed the prospect of supplying various classes of photovoltaic devices as an appropriate option to the next generation of optoelectronic systems, which may help us understand and build long-term, solution-processed, future OSC applications.

Compared to other molecule types (ITIC, IDT, etc.), Y-series molecules have superior performances as developed OSCs acceptors. However, despite the fact that these benefits are invaluable, it is impressive to obtain real-life usage with further advancements in the types of molecules and the processing circumstances. We anticipate that these advancements will contribute to an increase in efficiency, stability, and production. Although these advantages are worthwhile, achieving them in practice is challenging because they require additional improvements in efficiency, stability, and productivity. These achievements are notable, but the resolved problems should not be forgotten. It is expensive to make Y-series NFA and Y6 is difficult to commercialize given that it requires a ten-step synthesis. An appropriate end groups are necessary in the modification of Y-serious acceptor molecules for commercial applications. Developing synthetic tools and processing methods that are environmentally sustainable will be a very challenging task. Also, donor polymers and NFAs need to be developed, which are important in achieving the design. The production of polymers made from BDTs is not efficient, which increases their price. Also, the Y series molecules are sensitive to external sources (heat, moisture, oxygen, and sunlight) because they are made up of numerous fused aromatic rings. More attention to the materials in the active and interface layers, as well as the manufacture of devices, can help make the outlook for OSCs brighter. Solving these difficulties is not only contingent on the molecular design of the active layer materials, but also on the development of novel interlayer and electrode materials and the use of device engineering. We think that the commercialization of OPVs with low cost, high efficiency, strong stability, and environmental friendliness will be within reach once these challenges are addressed concurrently. We believe that this review will give detailed insight into the links between the structure and behaviour of cells among the polymer donors and a collection of helpful guiding principles and techniques for the design and processing of Y-family NFAs for new polymer donors to achieve high-performance OSCs.
