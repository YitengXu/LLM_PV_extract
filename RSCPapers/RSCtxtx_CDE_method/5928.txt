This contribution describes recent progress in the design, synthesis and properties of solution-processible star-shaped oligomers and their application in organic photovoltaics. Even though alternative chemistry has been used to design such oligomers, the most successful approach is based on a triphenylamine donor branching center, (oligo)thiophene conjugated spacers and dicyanovinyl acceptor groups. These are mainly amorphous low band-gap organic semiconductors, though crystalline or liquid crystalline ordering can sometimes be realized. It was shown that the solubility, thermal behavior and structure of such molecules in the bulk strongly depend on the presence and position of alkyl groups, as well as on their length. The photovoltaic properties of solution-processed molecules of this type are now approaching 5% which exceeds those of vacuum-sublimed devices. The design rules and future perspectives of this class of organic photovoltaic molecules are discussed.

Organic photovoltaics is a fast growing area of science and technology due to possibility to create light weight large area flexible solar cells, which can be produced by low cost printing or roll-to-roll techniques. The technology is based on organic semiconductors, either π-conjugated polymers or small molecules, capable of efficient light absorption in the visible spectral range with the creation of excitons. However, opposite to inorganic solar cells, charge separation in organic solar cells (OSC) leading to a photovoltaic effect takes place on the interface between the electron donor and the electron acceptor organic semiconductors. In order to maximize this interface area, “bulk heterojunction” OSCs, consisting of a phase-separated mixture of donor and acceptor organic semiconductors were suggested. In the case of the solution-processing of organic semiconductors, which is considered to be a cost-effective alternative to expensive high vacuum processing techniques, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is formed by the spontaneous phase separation of organic semiconductors during solvent evaporation. For the creation of the most efficient BHJ OSC, typical dimensions of the donor and the acceptor phases should be on the order of 10–20 nm, that is comparable to the exciton diffusion length. Moreover, these phases have to be highly interconnected to allow electrons and holes separated on their interphase to reach the electrodes and give a photocurrent. That is why the morphology of bulk heterojunctions plays a crucial role on the performance of BHJ OSCs. The ability to control the morphology depends first of all on the chemical structure of a particular organic semiconductor, its solubility and the compatibility of the two types of organic semiconductors used in the BHJ. Therefore, the design of novel solution-processible organic semiconductors is a important for the creation of highly efficient BHJ OSCs. Further improvements to the morphology and hence the efficiency of BHJ OSCs can be made by including various additives during solution processing, like 1,8-octanedithiol or 1,8-diiodooctane, or by different post-treatment techniques, like thermal or solvent vapor annealing. Introduction of special interfacial layers into the device structure of the OSC, which help optimize the electronic and electrical properties between the interfaces of the light-harvesting active layer and charge-collecting electrodes, can further improve the efficiency.

Nowadays it is accepted that theoretically the efficiency of BHJ OSCs can reach as high as 10% in single junction structures and 15% in tandem devices. Recent achievements in organic photovoltaic material design, morphology optimization and device architecture showed fast progress towards these values: power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7–9% was reported for solution-processed single junction BHJ OSCs and above 10% for tandem structures. It is noteworthy that in all these high efficiency organic photovoltaic devices, a soluble fullerene derivative, PC71BM, was used as the acceptor and different low band gap small molecules or polymers served as the donor organic semiconductors. The design of the latter is based on the concept of incorporation of different donor and acceptor units into the structure of the oligomeric or polymeric molecule, which allow tuning of their HOMO and LUMO levels, leading to a narrow band gap. This means that the less than 1.9 eV reported for the “standard” organic semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT, is widely used in organic photovoltaics. Although the record efficiencies of BHJ OSCs based on small molecules and polymers are comparable now, a clear advantage of the small molecules is their exact molecular structure, absence of any polydispersity and different chain ends, which lead to less batch to batch variations during their large scale synthesis and easier purification process. Among the small molecules used as donor materials in organic photovoltaics one can distinguish two different classes: linear and star-shaped molecules. The first class is widely investigated, which already led to impressive PCE values of the BHJ OSC devices based on them, mentioned above. The star-shaped molecules seems to be less researched and it is worth considering them in detail in this paper based on recent achievements made in our group in order to outline the design rules leading to the most efficient star-shaped molecules for organic photovoltaic devices and the future perspective of this class of materials.

The first star-shaped molecule, properties of which were checked in OSCs, was planarized star-shaped oligothiophene 1 reported by Roncali et al. (Fig. 1). Under light illumination at 77 mW cm−2 irradiation intensity, a bilayer OSC, prepared by vacuum evaporation of 1 as the donor and N,N′-bis(tridecyl)perylenedicarboxyimide (DP13) as the acceptor, showed an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, short circuit current (Jsc) of 1.35 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.51, which gives an overall PCE of 0.77%. This value itself was not very high, albeit it was significantly better compared to a similar device made from its lineal analogue 2, containing a central core and just one arm of the star, which under the same conditions showed only a PCE of 0.04%. This difference in behaviour was explained by the different orientation of the linear and the star-shaped compounds in thin films, supported by X-ray and UV-Vis optical spectroscopy investigations. The linear oligomer 2 has a preferential vertical orientation of the molecules onto the surface of the substrates, while the star-shaped compound 1 has a preferential horizontal orientation, which is more favourable for absorption of the incident light.

Similar conclusions were made after investigation of a series of quaterthiophene-based multipods 3–5 with linear and branched terminal alkyl groups (Fig. 1). It was found that multipods with branched 2-ethylhexyl groups 4 and 5 showed better photovoltaic characteristics in solution-processable BHJ OSCs, as compared to multipod 3 with linear hexyl groups: PCE = 0.9% and 0.27% vs. 0.05% were reported (Table 1). In all of these devices one of the multipods served as a donor and soluble fullerene derivative PC71BM as an acceptor organic semiconductor. This behaviour was attributed not only to improved solubility and morphology of multipods 4 and 5, but also to a different orientation of their molecules relative to the surface of the substrate: star-shaped multipod 3 with linear end groups tended to have a vertical orientation, while its analogue 4 with branched end groups tended to have a more horizontal orientation. It was subsequently confirmed by X-ray analysis, which showed 22 and 55 degrees inclination of the quaterthiophene groups in the multipods 3 and 4, respectively, in their unit cells.

Since the orientation of the chromophores in the space seems to be very important for the efficiency of photovoltaic devices, the other type of star-shaped molecules – tetrahedral oligothiophenesilanes 7–9 – seem to be very promising. Under any orientation of such molecule in the space, some the oligothiophene groups orient more or less horizontally to the surface of the cell. This leads to efficient light harvesting in the region of the spectral match of the oligothiophene and the solar light (Table 1). Moreover, the non-planar structure of these molecules makes them highly soluble in normal organic solvents like chloroform, toluene, THF, etc. The first oligothiophenesilane 7 was reported by Roncali et al. Bilayer heterojunction solar cells prepared from 7 as a donor material and DP13 as an acceptor material showed a high Voc of 0.99 V, reasonably good FF of 51%, but a low overall PCE of 0.2% mainly due to a low Jsc of 0.36 mA cm−2. However, a clear advantage of the star-shaped structure over its linear analogue, α-hexylterthiophene 6, was demonstrated: a similar device prepared with 6 as a donor showed reduced photovoltaic characteristics with a PCE of only 0.04% . In the same work terthiophenesilane 7a, which has an n-hexylthiole instead of n-hexyl end-capping group, leading to a somewhat higher solubility, was reported. In combination with a PC61BM acceptor it was used as a donor in a solution-processed BHJ OSC device, which showed an improved Jsc of 1.13 mA cm−2, but an only slightly higher PCE of 0.29% mainly due to a reduced fill factor to 24%.
Our group was able to synthesize soluble oligothiophenesilanes 7–9 with different conjugation lengths ranging from three to five conjugated thiophene rings. Since solubility in this series of star-shaped molecules decreased with increasing conjugation length, it was necessary to use branched 2-ethylhexyl end-capping groups for quinquethiophenesilane 5 to make it soluble. The efficiency of solution-processible BHJ OSCs prepared from compounds 7–9 as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor improved with increasing conjugation length: from 0.6% for 7 to 1.4% for 9 (Table 1). A major improvement comes from the short circuit currents, which lay in the range 2.9–6.0 mA cm−2 with a clear tendency to increase for higher conjugation lengths of the donor, implying the improved efficiency of the light absorption for more conjugated molecules. Interestingly, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches values above 20% in a broad wavelength range from 380 to 580 nm for quaterthiophenesilane 8 and above 30% in the region between 400 and 500 nm for quinquethiophenesilane 9, i.e. in the region of efficient light absorbance of these two donor compounds, with a clear impart of the acceptor absorbance. Further improvements of the PCE are possible with donor molecules possessing a lower band gap than those of the oligothiophenes considered above.
A fruitful approach to the preparation of low band gap star-shaped molecules is based on the usage of triphenylamine (TPA) donor branching core and different accepting groups located in the arms of these molecules. The first such molecules were reported by Roncali et al. (10 and 11 in Fig. 2). They contained α-hexylterthienyl or 3′,4′-ethylenedioxy-5′′-hexyl-5-terthienyl groups, respectively. A bilayer OSC obtained by spin-coating of 10 or 11 donor material followed by vacuum evaporation of a C60 acceptor showed, however, low PCE values, 0.32 and 0.14% respectively (Table 2). BHJ OSCs prepared from spin-coating of a mixture of the TPA-based donor molecule 12 having three (2-thienylethen-2-yl)-2-thienyl groups and PC61BM acceptor showed similar photovoltaic behaviour with PCE = 0.41%. The similar TPA-based molecule 13 with pyrenylimide-quaterthienyl arms reported by Cremer and Bauerle, albeit has a significantly lower optical band gap of 2.01 eV, in BHJ OSCs with a PC61BM acceptor showed a PCE of 0.25%. In fact, this molecule has several optical transitions, the shortest of which (at 429 nm) can be attributed to the conjugated quaterthiophene-phenylene system, while the longest (at 520 nm) to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the TPA-donor group to a pyrenylimide acceptor group. A similar situation was identified for the TPA-molecule 14 with dicyanovinyl (DCN) acceptor groups by Roncali et al. Initial efforts showed a PCE of 1.02% for a bilayer device with 14 as a donor and C60 as an acceptor. Further optimization of the device structure led to an increase in its efficiency to PCE = 1.85%. More elongated TPA–DCN molecules with bithienyl (15) or bithienylethenyl (16) conjugated spacers were reported by Jing Zhang et al. BHJ OSCs with 15 or 16 as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor showed a PCE of 1.4 and 3.0%, respectively. To make them soluble, 3-hexylthienyl instead of thienyl groups was used. The star-shaped oligomer 16 had a remarkable shift in the absorption edge of 78 nm compared to oligomer 15, leading to a narrow band gap of 1.65 eV vs. 1.83 eV (Table 2). A combination of a good solubility (18 g L−1) with a narrow band gap of 16 is the most probable factor, which leads to a record PCE in this series of the star-shaped oligomers. Comparable results were obtained by the same group for the TPA star-shaped molecule 17 with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–dicyanovinyl arms. BHJ OSC with 17 as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor showed a PCE of 1.63%. Replacing PC61BM by PC71BM led to an increase in the PCE to 2.87% due to a wider absorption spectra of PC71BM. The good solubility of 17 was governed by the presence of two hexyl groups at each thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit.

One of the other strong donor groups is benzothiadiazole, which was also used in the design of TPA-based donor–acceptor molecules. Yongfang Li’s group reported the synthesis of star-shaped molecule 18 with benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazolvinylene arms. Its 1:3 mixture with PC61BM led to a BHJ OSC with a PCE of 0.61%. Elongation of these arms with two 3-hexylthienyl units (19) and further with ethynyltriphenylene (20) units led to lowering of the band gap from 2.04 to 1.88 and 1.76 eV, respectively (Table 2). BHJ OSCs prepared from 19 or 20 with a PC71BM acceptor led to an improved PCE of 1.90 and 1.23%, respectively. Attaching just a 3-hexylthyenyl unit to 18 led to molecule 21, which in a mixture with a PC71BM acceptor showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 2.39%. Alternative elongation of benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazolvinylene arms with an ethylene-triphenylamine group (22) led to a BHJ OSC with a PCE of 1.33% using a PC61BM acceptor and with a PCE of 3.37% using a PC71BM acceptor. Direct linking of the benzothiadiazole-ethylene-triphenylamine arm to a TPA core in star-shaped molecule 23 allowed a PCE of 3.14%, using a PC71BM acceptor. Interestingly that simple incorporation of a benzothiadiazole unit between the TPA core and α-hexylterthiophene arm in 24 allowed further improvement of the photovoltaic properties in the BHJ OSC: to PCE = 2.34% using a PC61BM acceptor and to PCE = 4.3% using a PC71BM acceptor.
Thus, nowadays there is quite a lot of different TPA-based star-shaped molecules used in organic photovoltaic applications, the most efficient of which includes strong dicyanovinyl or benzothiadiazole units. However, a systematic investigation of the influence of their molecular structure on their photovoltaic performance has not yet been reported. Moreover, the photovoltaic properties of different molecules were measured in different device architectures, with different acceptors or donor:acceptor ratios, but this does not allow for their direct comparison. Below we compare a series of TPA-based star-shaped molecules with different conjugation lengths and solubilizing alkyl chain ends, N(TPA-nT-DCN-Alk)3 and the molecule without alkyl groups, N(TPA-2T-DCN)3 (Fig. 3). Their optical, electrochemical, photovoltaic and thermal properties, as well as bulk structure, measured under identical conditions, should allow for the elucidation of rules for the design of the most efficient structures of star-shaped molecules for organic photovoltaic applications.

The chemical structures of all TPA-based star-shaped molecules under consideration are presented in Fig. 3. A general scheme of the synthesis of the molecules with terminal alkyl chains, N(TPA-nT-DCN-Alk)3, is outlined in Fig 4a. Their preparation consists of six steps. The first step includes preparation of oligothienyl ketones with different numbers of conjugated thiophene rings by acylation of the magnesium derivatives of oligothienyl bromides with the corresponding alkanoyl chlorides. The second step requires preparation of the protected ketones in order to use them on the third stage of the reaction, which includes formation of their lithium derivatives followed by the reaction with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (IPTMDOB) for the preparation of pinacol boronic esters. In the fourth step, a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between the organoboron compounds prepared and tris(4-bromophenyl)amine is carried out to obtain the star-shaped precursors with protected ketone groups. Then the simple treatment of their solutions in THF with hydrochloric acid under reflux led to precipitation of the poorly soluble star-shaped ketones in high yields (95–99%). The successful substitution of three carbonyl groups with dicyanovinyl functions was required to elaborate and to optimize the conditions of the Knövenagel condensation. As a result, all TPA-based molecules, N(TPA-nT-DCN-Alk)3, were synthesized in high reaction yield (90–95%) via the Knövenagel condensation between trifunctional ketones and an excess of malononitrile under microwave heating, using pyridine both as a base and as a solvent. Microwave heating for the last reaction step was found to decrease both the reaction time and the amount of by-products compared to conventional heating.

Synthesis of the star-shaped molecule without alkyl groups N(TPA-2T-DCN)3 was carried out in four steps using the synthetic approach developed earlier by Roncali et al. for similar molecules (Fig. 4b). It should be noted, however, that synthesis of the same molecule via a scheme of protection/deprotection of carbonyl groups was done recently in 5 steps with 37% overall yield starting from 2,2′-bithiophene-5-carbaldehyde. In this work it was obtained in 52% overall yield by an alternative technique. In the first step 2-(2,2′-bithien-5-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (26) was synthesized by the reaction between IPTMDOB and 2′-bithien-5-yl magnesium bromide, prepared in situ from 5-bromo-2,2′-bithiophene (25) and magnesium, in a 97% isolated yield. A Suzuki cross-coupling between 26 and tris(4-bromophenyl)amine gave star-shaped precursor 27 in a 90% yield. A Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of compound 27 led to tris[4-5-formyl-2,2′-bithiyenyl]amine 28 in a 90% yield. Finally, N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 was obtained in a 60% isolated yield by the Knövenagel condensation reaction of compound 28 with an excess of malononitrile in pyridine under microwave heating. The purity and molecular structure of all precursors and the final molecule was proved by 1H-, and IR, spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and MALDI-TOF (see Experimental section and ESI, Fig. S1–S4).

The optical properties of the seven TPA–DCN molecules synthesized were investigated both in dilute solutions and in thin films. Fig. 5 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of dilute solutions of these star-shaped small molecules in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and thin films doctor bladed on quartz substrates. The corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 3. It should be noted that all of these compounds are soluble in polar organic solvents, like THF, chloroform, ODCB, etc. An estimation of their solubility was made by dissolving the compounds in ODCB (1 mL) until relevant molecules remained undissolved at room temperature and filtering the complete solution obtained through a 0.25 μm PTFE syringe filter. Immediately after filtration the solution was quickly and quantitatively transferred (500 μL) into another glass bottle of known mass, the solvent from the filtrate was evaporated and the residue was weighed. After the solubility of the relevant material was calculated. It was found that the solubility decreases with elongation of the arm conjugation length, when going from 1T to 2T and 3T-containing molecules, but it significantly improves with increasing the alkyl chain length or even adding methyl groups to the DCN groups. As a result, a reasonable compromise between the conjugation length and the alkyl chain end can be found to realize solution-processable star-shaped molecules.

Onsets of the absorption spectra of these molecules in solution (Fig. 5a) are clearly grouping in three locations, corresponding to the different conjugation lengths of the arms of the molecules: (1) at 560 nm for the 1T-containing molecule N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3, (2) at ca. 603 nm for the 2T-containing molecules N(Ph-2T-DCN-Alk)3 and (3) at 615 nm for the 3T-containing molecule N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3. The absorption edge of the 2T-containing molecule without alkyl ends N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 lies at 611 nm, that is in between the second and the third cases, indicating a small influence of the alkyl substituents at dicyanovinyl groups on the optical properties. The absorption spectra of the five 2T-containing molecules in solution show similar absorption peaks and regions, exhibiting strong visible absorption peaks at ca. 382 nm (with molar extinction coefficients Kext = 31700–49600 M−1 cm−1) and ca. 517 nm (with 2–2.5 times higher Kext = 77800–105000 M−1 cm−1), as can be seen in Fig. 5a. The absorption peak at 382 nm in the short wavelength region corresponds to the π–π* transition. And the visible absorption peak at 517 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transition between the triphenylamine (TPA)-2T donor unit and the dicyanovinyl (DCN) acceptor unit. Compared to the five 2T-containing molecules, the absorption peaks of the 1T-containing N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 are significantly blue-shifted to 363 nm and 495 nm. Their molar extinction coefficients are 35800 M−1 cm−1 and 85500 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Probably, the shorter oligothiophene π-bridges linkage between TPA and DCN increases torsional interactions and reduces the strength of the ICT transition, which determines the band gap of the molecules under consideration. The optical band gaps of the 2T-containing molecules N(Ph-2T-DCN-Alk)3 in solution are 2.05–2.06 eV, it is somewhat smaller (2.03 eV) for N(Ph-2T-DCN)3, while the corresponding band gap of N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 is significantly larger, 2.22 eV. Considering these reasons, the shorter wavelength region peaks red shift from 363 nm/382 nm to 416 nm for N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3, which is attributed to the stronger localized π–π* transition arising from the longer oligothiophene π-bridge lengths. The peak at 416 nm has a remarkably high Kext = 96800 M−1 cm−1, while the ICT transition of this molecule at 522 nm has the highest Kext = 158000 M−1 cm−1 in the whole series of molecules under consideration. In addition, the similar absorption peaks for N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 in solution comparing with the 2T-contining molecules suggests that the longer oligothiophene π-bridge lengths of star-shaped molecules have no obvious influence on the ICT transition.
Comparative analysis of the solution and thin films' photophysical properties revealed that absorption spectra of these molecules become broader and their absorption peaks are significantly red-shifted, as shown in Fig. 5b and Table 3. Broadening the absorption peaks is accompanied by decreasing their absorption coefficients, especially of the long wavelength ICT transitions (at 502–560 nm) – they decrease by 1.3–1.5 times. However, changes in the short wavelength π–π* transitions are much smaller: their molar extinction coefficients Kext changes just by 10%, and these changes can have either direction (increasing or decreasing in Kext). Such changes in the Kext make the absorption of these molecules in a thin film more smoothly distributed throughout the whole absorption spectra compared to their solution. The most significant changes can be seen for the onsets of the absorption spectra of these molecules in films (Fig. 5b). As in the case of solutions, they can also be grouped in three cases, albeit somewhat different than those in the solutions: (1) at ca. 600 nm for the 1T-containing molecule N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3, (2) at ca. 630–650 nm for the 2T-containing molecules N(Ph-2T-DCN-Alk)3 with ethyl, hexyl and decyl groups and (3) at ca. 670–700 nm for the 2T-containing molecules N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 and N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3, as well as for the 3T-containing molecule N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3. The absorption spectra of N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 is broader than those of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3, and even more than those of the other three 2T-containing molecules with the longer alkyl terminal chains. These results indicate that there are strong intermolecular interactions leading to aggregation in the N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 and N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3 films. It is likely that the long alkyl terminal chains could increase steric hindrance and torsional interactions between the DCN groups and 2T-bridges and shorten the conjugated length of each branch in the molecule. Interestingly, the absorption peak of N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 is negligibly shifted between solution and film. This may be attributed to the weak aggregation and intermolecular interactions of the molecules in the solid state. In addition, due to the decreased branch conjugation length and poor electronic communication between the TPA and DCN units, 1T-containing N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 exhibits a high solid state optical band gap of 2.08 eV, while it is significantly lower (1.80 eV) for its 2T-homologue N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3 and 1.78 eV for 2T-containing star without alkyl groups N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3. The other 2T-containing molecules with longer alkyl groups have somewhat larger optical band gaps of 1.92–1.95 eV in the solid state due to weaker interactions between the molecules. Finally, compared to the N(Ph-2T-DCN-Hex)3, the absorption intensity of N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 in the shorter wavelength region is higher, illustrating that a longer oligothiophene π-bridge effectively releases the distortion induced by the hexyl terminal chains. Higher conjugation of the arms in N(Ph-2T-DCN-Hex)3 leads to a rather low optical band gap in the solid state (1.85 eV). It is noteworthy that optical band gaps in the solid state are ca. 0.10–0.26 eV smaller than those in the solution, indicating different aggregation of the molecules in the solid state.
The electrochemical properties of seven star-shaped molecules under consideration and their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CVA). From the values of the standard formal reduction potentials (φred) and the standard formal oxidation potentials (φox), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these compounds were calculated as presented in Table 3, according to the equations of LUMO = −e(φred + 4.40) (eV) and HOMO = −e(φox + 4.40) (eV). The results revealed that the measured LUMO energy levels of these seven molecules are very close, suggesting that the incorporation of various oligothiophene π-bridges and alkyl terminal chains has little effect on the LUMO level differences. However, it is interesting to note that the HOMO energy levels are significantly different due to the effect of the π-conjugated bridges with various electron donating characters. Owing to the strong electron-donating terthiophene units as π-bridges, N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 exhibits a high HOMO energy level of −5.26 eV. And it is 0.34 eV higher than that of N(Ph-1T-DCN-Hex)3 (−5.60 eV) because of its relatively weak electron-donating thiophene bridges. In addition, the HOMO energy levels of the other four 2T-bridge based molecules with various alkyl terminal chains are in between the HOMO energy levels of N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 and N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 and similar, as shown in Table 4.

It should be noted that only the HOMO energy level of N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 can be estimated from the CVA measurements, since this compound shows a reversible formal oxidation potential at +0.77 V, but irreversible reduction. This gives the value of HOMO of this compound as −5.17 eV – the highest in the series of compounds under consideration. It is 0.15 eV higher as those for its methyl analogue N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3, indicating less oxidation stability of the former, which can be attributed to the easy oxidation of the liable proton at the dicyanovinyl groups. A similar trend can be observed, when comparing HOMO energy levels of N(Ph-1T-DCN)3 (compound 14 in Table 2) and N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3, which were estimated to be −5.48 and 5.60 eV, respectively, giving a difference of 0.12 eV. Moreover, for all alkyl-substituted stars N(Ph-nT-DCN-Alk)3 both oxidation and reduction potentials are reversible, while the reduction of their proton-containing analogs, N(Ph-1T-DCN)3 and N(Ph-2T-DCN)3, was found to be irreversible not only in this work, but also in the literature. Thus, the presence of alkyl substituents at dicyanovonyl groups makes N(Ph-nT-DCN-Alk)3 stars not only more oxidation stable, but also makes their reduction reversible due to stabilization of anion-radicals by alkyl groups, that can positively influence the stability of organic photovoltaic devices made from these compounds.

Thermal stability, phase behaviour and structure of the series of TPA–DCN star-shaped molecules were investigated by TGA, DSC, and X-ray diffraction in small and wide angles (WAXS and SAXS). The results obtained are summarized in Table 5. TGA data (see Table 5 and Fig. S5) indicate that all of these compounds are thermally stable and demonstrate a temperature of 5% decomposition (Td) above 370 °C both under an inert atmosphere (under nitrogen) and under normal conditions (in the presence of oxygen and water vapours). The temperature of decomposition, Td, is diminished with increasing alkyl chain length, which could be explained by the decomposition of the aliphatic tails.

DSC analysis revealed that both the methyl-containing molecules N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 and N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3 as well as those without alkyl groups N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 can be crystalline at the first heating, but they become amorphous after melting, as can be seen on the cooling and the second heating scans (Fig. 6). Such behaviour was used for simplification of the dissolution of these molecules, since amorphous phases dissolve much faster and easier than the crystalline ones. Interestingly, the melting temperatures of N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 and N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 are the same, 276 °C, but their melting enthalpies differ by more than three times: 81.1 vs. 27.8 J g−1. However, it should be noted that the latter compound is only partly crystalline and shows both a glass transition and melting peak on the same first heating DSC curve. This can be explained by its low solubility, leading to fast solidification during solvent evaporation. Both the melting temperature and enthalpy of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3 are lower compared to its 1T-containing analogue N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3. Glass transition temperatures for the whole series of compounds investigated tend to increase when increasing the conjugation length of the molecule, but decrease when increasing the alkyl chain length, even though the appearance of a methyl group increases it compared to the non-alkyl analogue. This tendency is the reverse of the solubility trends discussed above. Heat capacity changes at the glass transition are quite close for all the compounds investigated and lies in the range of 0.21–0.29 J g−1 K−1.
X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the conclusions made from the DSC data. WAXS patterns of all three crystalline compounds – N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3, N(Ph-2T-DCN)3, and N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3 – reveal a number of narrow reflections, unequivocally confirming the presence of highly crystalline domains (Fig. 7a), while non-crystalline compounds showed only a diffuse halo (Fig. 7b). Crystal packing of the molecules of compound N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 were recently resolved. It forms a triclinic crystal lattice with parameters a = 11.47 Å, b = 18.17 Å, c = 18.30 Å, and α = 98.3°, β = 52.2°, γ = 130.7° (Fig. 8a). Similar crystal packing can be expected for the other two crystalline star-shaped molecules, however their crystal lattice is not yet resolved. The temperature behaviour of N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 is presented in Fig. 9a. Glass transition manifests itself in the disappearance of the first of two diffuse halos and in the growth of a new reflection at s = 0.227 nm−1.
The star-shaped compound with the longest alkyl group, N(Ph-2T-DCN-Dodec)3, showed a changed shape of the amorphous halo compared to the other disordered compounds in Fig. 7b. Moreover, its SAXS patterns are characterized by a wide small-angle reflection corresponding to d-spacing of 30.3 Å (Fig. 9b, curves 1–3). With increasing temperature, the mesophase reflection of this compound shifts to wider angles, the d-spacing was decreased to 29.5 Å at 60 °C. This change corresponds to the thermal expansion coefficient β = 6.6 × 10−4 K−1 which is rather common for liquid crystalline materials and is due to the shrinking of alkyl end chains. With increasing temperature a transition to the isotropic phase is observed near 100 °C. Mesophase order was not restored on cooling. Unfortunately structural data is not enough for the unambiguous identification of the mesophase formed in the as-received samples of compound N(Ph-2T-DCN-Dodec)3. However some remarks could be made. According to the results of molecular modeling, the radius of the molecular disc of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Dodec)3 is 26.5 Å provided the alkyl chains are in extended conformation, which coincides, with great precise, with the diameter of columns calculated from the observed small-angle reflection d-spacing. This supramolecular aggregate formed by twelve molecules is shown in Fig. 8b. Their arms are shifted relative to each other by several degrees providing π–π stacking between neighboring arms of different molecules forming a helical aggregate. However, as wide reflections as well as higher orders of a 10 columnar reflection are not observed, this interpretation is open for further studies.
In contrast to the crystalline N(Ph-2T-DCN)3, and to the amorphous N(Ph-2T-DCN-Hex)3, which does not reveal any reflections in the SAXS patterns (Fig. 9c, curve 1), N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 at room temperature is characterized by a set of three reflections with the ratio of corresponding d-spacings d12:d22:d32 = 1:3:4 (Fig. 9c, curve 2). They can be indexed by a 2D hexagonal columnar phase with a cylinder diameter D = 23.7 Å. Moreover, a wide halo is observed at s = 0.16 Å−1. Its origin relates to the Fourier transform of a single cylinder of columnar mesophase. With the temperature increasing, mesophase reflections of compound N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 shift to small angles, the diameter of the columns increased to 23.9 Å at 120 °C (Fig. 9c, curve 3). Such a change corresponds to the thermal expansion coefficient β = 1.3 × 10−4 K−1. As the diameter of the molecular envelope is 30.6 Å, substantial correlation between the relative positions of the molecules in neighbouring molecules should be suggested (Fig. 8c). There is no order in the packing of the molecules along the column axis (because of the absence of diffraction maxima on the wide-angle X-ray scattering patterns), as well as no ordering between the neighbouring columns, summarizing that the pattern of molecular packing is irregular in each transverse section due to the steric necessity of mutual packing of long π-conjugated bridges, while column centres form 2D hexagonal lattice. Appearing steric limitations lead to the azimuthal irregularities in stacking of the molecules along the column, as every molecule should adjust its position not only with its top and bottom neighbours inside the cylinder, but with its side neighbours as well. The columnar mesophase formed in the samples of N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 looks to be very promising for directed charge transport along the columns as the oligothiophene fragments of neighbouring molecules are arranged to allow the best π–π stacking. However, an alignment of the columns is needed for the good semiconductor properties to manifest.
Thus, one can observe the tendency of the star-shaped compounds with short arms and short aliphatic tails to form crystalline structures. Moreover, it was shown before that for the compound to form a liquid crystalline mesophase, optimal combination of the rigid core and soft side chains should exist, which is the case for N(Ph-2T-DCN-Dodec)3 and N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3, but not the case for N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3, N(Ph-3T-DCN-Et)3 or N(Ph-2T-DCN-Hex)3.

To study the effects of the oligothiophene π-bridge length as well as alkyl terminal chain length on the photovoltaic properties of the star-shaped molecules, bulk heterojucntion organic solar cells (OSCs) with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TPA-based molecules: PC70BM (1:2, wt%)/Ca(15 nm)/Ag(80 nm) were fabricated. The best current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 10a and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 6. As expected, OSCs based on these small molecules show relatively high Voc (>0.9 V), due to their low-lying HOMO energy levels. Encouragingly, OSCs based on N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 with thiophene bridges exhibited a high Voc up to 1.08 V. In contrast, OSCs based on N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 with terthiophene bridges showed a lower Voc of 0.93 V, which are consistent with their HOMO level variations. In addition, the other four 2T-bridge based molecules with various alkyl terminal chains exhibited the expected Voc of 0.98 V, as shown in Table 6. However, the device based on N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 without alkyl terminal chains showed a low Voc of 0.92 V, which may be attributed to poor film quality. Following this reasoning, a significantly low Jsc of 6.54 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 38.4% are observed for the N(Ph-2T-DCN)3:PC70BM device. In these seven molecule systems, the N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3:PC70BM device exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.72% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 8.87 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54.3% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. When increasing the terminal alkyl chain length, the photovoltaic performance of the relevant 2T-bridge based systems gradually decreased, as shown in Table 6. These results suggest that the introduction of methyl terminal chains instead of the relatively long alkyl chains can enhance the intermolecular interactions, charge separation and transportation, charge carrier lifetime and consequently improving the photovoltaic performance. However, despite this the device based on N(Ph-1T-DCN-Me)3 with thiophene bridges exhibited a high Voc of 1.08 V, the Jsc (5.97 mA cm−2) and FF (35.6%) showing a significant drop due to the poor film quality and charge transport. In addition, compared to the N(Ph-2T-DCN-Hex)3:PC70BM device, the N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3:PC70BM device showed a higher PCE of 3.96% with a slightly lower Voc of 0.93 V. This suggests that subtly extending the π-bridge length in star-shaped molecules can represent an interesting method for the effective modulation of the device performance at a moderate cost. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding devices is shown in Fig. 10b. And the integrated EQE agrees well with the Jsc of the various devices mentioned above.

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a “Bruker WP-250 SY” spectrometer, working at a frequency of 250.13 MHz and utilising CDCl3 signal (7.25 ppm) as the internal standard. In the case of 1H NMR spectroscopy, the compounds to be analysed were taken in the form of 5% solutions in CDCl3. The spectra were then processed on the computer using ACD Labs software.

Mass-spectra (MALDI) were registered on the Autoflex II Bruker (resolution FWHM 18000), equipped with a nitrogen laser (work wavelength 337 nm and time-of-flight mass-detector working in reflections mode). The accelerating voltage was 20 kV. Samples were applied to a polished stainless steel substrate. Spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode. The resulting spectrum was the sum of 300 spectra obtained at different points of the sample. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) (Acros, 99%) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) (Acros, 99%) were used as matrices.
Elemental analysis of C, H, N elements was carried out using a CHN automatic analyzer CE 1106 (Italy). A settling titration using BaCl2 was applied to analyze sulphur. The spectrophotometry technique was used for Si analysis. The experimental error for the elemental analysis is 0.30–0.50%. The Knövenagel condensation was carried out in a microwave “Discovery”, (CEM corporation, USA), using a standard method with the open vessel option, 50 watts.
Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in dynamic mode in 30 ÷ 900 °C interval using the Mettler Toledo TG50 system equipped with a M3 microbalance allowing the measurement of the weight of samples in a 0–150 mg range with 1 μg precision. Heating/cooling rate was chosen to be 10 °C min−1. Every compound was studied twice: in air and under a nitrogen flow of 200 mL min−1. DSC scans were obtained with a Mettler Toledo DSC30 system with a 10 °C min−1 heating/cooling rate in the temperature range of +20 to +290 °C. A nitrogen flow of 50 mL min−1 was used.
Absorption profiles were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Lambda-35 absorption spectrometer from 350 to 1100 nm. The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CVA). The measurements were carried out in the 1,2-dichlorobenzene–acetonitrile (4:1) mixture of solvents using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. The glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode. Potentials were measured relative to a saturated calomel electrode.

X-ray diffraction patterns in small and wide angle scattering regions were recorded by a S3-Micropix system (Hecus company), CuKα-radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å with Xenocs Genix source (voltage and current – 50 kV and 1 mA respectively). A Pilatus 100K detector was employed, as well as a linear PSD 50 M gas detector (Ar–Me mixture at 8 × 105 Pa). A collimation system Fox 3D with Kratky collimation slits of 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm width was used, allowing stable measurements in a wave vector range from s = 0.003 Å−1 to s = 1.9 Å−1 where s = 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle. To get rid of the scattering of X-Rays on air molecules, the Goebbel mirrors and scattering path are vacuumed at pressures 2.6 ÷ 5.0 Pa. Exposure times were from 600 to 5000 s providing the high reliability of scattering data. The temperature behavior of samples was studied using a Joule attachment in the temperature range of 23°C to 300°C. Transmission X-ray diffraction patterns at wide angles were also recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance powder diffractometer (CuKα-radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å, Vantec 2D detector). The Accelrys Materials Studio® program set was employed for molecular modeling of the compounds studied. We used two sets of potentials, which allow taking into account non-covalent interactions: COMPASS (Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies) and UFF (Universal Force Field). The COMPASS set is suitable for modeling isolated molecules and condensed phases of mainly organic, polymeric and of some inorganic compounds, it also allows parameterization of the partial charges and valency ab initio with subsequent system optimization.


All of the devices were fabricated in the normal architecture. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated by doctor-blading on indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrates (from Osram). These substrates were cleaned in toluene, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. After drying, the substrates were bladed with 50 nm PEDOT:PSS (HC Starck, PEDOT PH-4083). Photovoltaic layers, consisting of three different small molecules and PC71BM in 1:2 wt% ratios were dissolved at different concentrations in ODCB and bladed on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, a calcium/silver top electrode of 15/80 nm thickness was evaporated. The typical active area of the investigated devices was 10.4 mm2. The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured under AM1.5G irradiation on an OrielSol 1A Solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). The EQE was detected with a Cary 500 Scan UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer under monochromatic illumination, which was calibrated with a mono-crystalline silicon diode. Absorption profiles were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Lambda-35 absorption spectrometer from 350 to 1100 nm.

Star-shaped oligomers present an emerging class of small molecules for efficient solution-processable organic photovoltaics. The most prospective approach for the design of such molecules is based on the “weak donor – strong acceptor” concept, similar to those used in the synthesis of low band gap copolymers. In the case of star-shaped molecules the most successful weak donor is triphenylamine, which serves also as a convenient branching centre. Successful strong acceptors include benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazol and dicyanovinyl groups, which can be attached to the triphenylamine core either directly or via conjugated spacers from 2,5-thiphene or 1,2-vinylene units or their combination. Dicyanovinyl (DCN) groups seem to be more synthetically viable, however, typically they contain a liable imide proton –HCC(DCN), originating from the aldehyde precursors, which can be easily oxidized. To avoid this drawback, we have developed a convenient synthetic approach, which allows using a ketone precursor in the Knövenagel condensation, to form stable alkyl derivatives of the dicyanovinyl groups.

Thus, alkyl groups, used also for increasing the solubility of the small molecules, can influence their stability, morphology and structure in the bulk. It was found that adding methyl groups to dicyanovinyl acceptor units of the TPA-based star-shaped molecules decreases the melting points, but increases the melting enthalpy. These findings indicate that methyl end-capped molecules have stronger interactions in the bulk structures, leading to improved charge carrier mobilities and better photovoltaic performance. Comparison of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3 and N(Ph-2T-DCN)3 shows that the presence of methyl groups in the molecule can lead to more than a 2 times increase in PCE: from 2.31 to 4.76%, when the BHJ OSCs were made under identical conditions. Such a strong effect is a result of improving all the parameters influencing the PCE: open circuit voltage increases from 0.92 to 0.98 V, short circuit current – from 6.54 to 8.87 mA cm−2, and fill factor – from 38.4 to 54.3%. Enlarging the open circuit voltage can be related to lowering the HOMO energy level of the donor star-shaped molecule by 0.15 eV – a side effect of the improved oxidation stability. An improved short circuit current can be explained by higher crystallinity and hence improved charge carrier mobility. Improving the fill factor can be related to a better morphology of the bulk heterojunction in the case of methyl end-capped molecules.
Increasing the alkyl chain length leads to suppressing the crystallinity and lowering the glass transition temperatures of the molecules. This fact positively influences the solubility, but decreases the short circuit current and fill factors in BHJ OSCs, thus lowering the overall PCE to 3.47–2.87%. Nevertheless, the ethyl group in N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3 seems to be a good compromise between the crystallinity and the solubility. This star-shaped compound is soluble not only in the chlorinated solvents, like most conjugated oligomers and polymers, but also in more environmentally friendly solvents, like benzaldehyde, that allow the preparation of BHJ OSCs from green solvents with PCE = 3.6%. Moreover, this compound shows good PCE values up to 3.9% in the inverted structures of BHJ OSCs, which are more stable under normal conditions compared to the the standard ones. Finally, interface engineering of the devices based on this donor molecule and PC71BM acceptor improves the PCE up to 5.4%.
Further increasing the alkyl chain length led to a very interesting effect – N(Ph-2T-DCN-Dodec)3 forms a columnar ordering of the molecules. If it were not long dielectric dodecyl groups, it would lead to a record high PCE. Even stronger ordering was observed for N(Ph-3T-DCN-Hex)3 molecules – they form a 2D hexagonal columnar mesophase. This factor definitely influences the performance of the BHJ OSC based on this molecule, for which the PCE approaches 4%.
Further improvements in the efficiency of the BHJ OSCs based on star-shaped molecules are foreseen due to the design of more flattened TPA–DCN molecules capable of forming an ordered 2D hexagonal columnar mesophase, and ordering of these phases in the devices. In addition, improved interfaces in BHJ OSCs of N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3 (ref. 31c) could lead to even higher performance for its methyl analogue N(Ph-2T-DCN-Me)3.
