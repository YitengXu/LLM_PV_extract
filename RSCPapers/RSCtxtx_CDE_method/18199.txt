The role of additives in spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport material (HTM) has been found to be vitally important for achieving decent photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Four spiro-OMeTAD recipes with controlled concentrations of additives are studied in the context of PSCs. It is found that a small change in the concentration of additives results in a huge difference in the overall power conversion efficiency, which stems from the distinct charge extraction process in PSCs. Furthermore, the effect of the third additive, a cobalt complex (FK102, Co(III)TFSI), on the carrier density and charge recombination in PSCs is extensively investigated. It is found that the presence of the cobalt additive can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs via the suppression of charge recombination at the interface of the perovskite layer and the HTM layer, which leads to a more than doubled power conversion efficiency.

Newly emerged perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn intense attention from both the scientific community and the industrial community due to the amazingly fast development of this young photovoltaic tehnology. To further promote the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, it is necessary to develop a deeper understanding of the role of each component in PSCs. As a matter of fact, researchers have been working on each individual interface, such as the electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite layer, and hole transport layer (HTL). In particular, new hole transport materials (HTMs) have been synthesized and applied in PSCs. Still PSCs that use the amorphous organic p-type semiconductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as the HTM give the most competitive efficiency. Meanwhile, it should be noted that pristine spiro-OMeTAD without dopants results in poor performance. As a result, dopants such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt and tert-butylpyridine (tBP) have been widely used to dope spiro-OMeTAD. In general, it is found that p-dopant LiTFSI significantly increases the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD, while tBP acts as a recombination blocking agent by modifying the conduction band edge of the TiO2 mesoporous layer in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSCs). Recently, it has been found that tBP can affect the morphology formation of the perovskite film in PSCs.

The Co(TFSI) complex tris(1-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol)cobalt(III) tris(hexafluorophosphate) (FK102) used as the third additive in spiro-OMeTAD was first reported in ss-DSCs by Grätzel's group in 2011. The cobalt additive can effectively increase the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD via chemical oxidization of spiro-OMeTAD to spiro-OMeTAD+ owing to its higher redox potential than that of spiro-OMeTAD. A higher Voc is observed in ss-DSCs with a cobalt complex because of a down-shift in the Fermi level of spiro-OMeTAD towards the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level due to increased hole concentration in the organic matrix. It should be noted that the p-doping mechanism of LiTFSI salt is very different from that of cobalt salt. Abate et al. reported that the oxidization of spiro-OMeTAD involves consumption of Li+ in the presence of oxygen that leaves free holes in the organic matrix. In addition, the different p-doping mechanisms also indicate that in the absence of the cobalt complex the concentration of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD or the hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD varies with the consumed Li+ ions in the organic matrix. However, in the presence of the cobalt salt, the concentration of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD is controlled by the initially added amount of cobalt salt, and affected by accessible Li+ ions. As a result, “dark soaking” is reportedly not as necessary for devices with cobalt additives as the system without the cobalt additive. In 2014, Badia et al. reported an iridium complex as the third additive in spiro-OMeTAD, and they investigated its performance in PSCs in comparison with spiro-OMeTAD with and without cobalt additives. They found that the presence of metal complexes as additives decreases the recombination rates. However, they didn’t discuss the influence of metal complexes on carrier density or capacitance at interfaces in PSCs and the correlation between recombination resistance and capacitance in the system. In solar cells, it is normally found that an increase in chemical capacitance that accounts for the density of electronic states in the system leads to a decrease in recombination resistance because the higher the charge density, the more likely the occurrence of recombination.
Here, in this work, comparisons are made between PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD HTM with and without a cobalt complex as the dopant. I investigate how the difference in the p-doping mechanism affects the recombination resistance and charge accumulation at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. From impedance spectroscopy, it is found that a small adjustment of the concentrations of two dopants, LiTFSI and tBP, can effectively suppress the charge recombination in the system. In addition, recombination resistance exhibits a linear decrease against the chemical capacitance at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Moreover, the recombination resistance of devices with the cobalt dopant is increased by approximately one order of magnitude compared to devices without cobalt, which leads to a more than doubled fill factor and a significant enhancement in Voc.

PSCs using TiO2 as an electron transport layer (ETL), MAPbI2.85Br0.15 as a perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport layer (HTL) are prepared as described in the Experimental section. To eliminate the hysteresis phenomenon in the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curve of PSCs, a TiO2 mesoporous layer is employed in all PSCs discussed in this work. Four recipes of spiro-OMeTAD that have been reported by four advanced groups are studied here. Part of the goal of this work is to find out why one recipe works better than the other one, and to provide guidance to researchers when they search for a right HTM recipe for their system. Fig. 1a illustrates the four spiro-OMeTAD recipes. Briefly, recipes 1–3 do not contain the cobalt dopant. Recipe 4 is recipe 3 with the addition of the cobalt complex. Fig. 1b displays the JV curves of PSCs. “Rep_N” refers to PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD of recipe N (N = 1, 2, 3, 4). “Re” and “Fw” stand for the reverse scan (scanning from open-circuit to short-circuit) and forward scan (scanning from short-circuit to open-circuit), respectively. Fig. 1b and c show that Rep_1 has the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) and Rep_3 has the lowest efficiency. But the photovoltaic performance of Rep_3 is significantly improved after the addition of the cobalt complex (Rep_4). Fig. 1c shows the differences in PCE (black, square), short-circuit current density, Jsc (red, circle), open-circuit voltage, Voc (blue, upward triangle), and fill factor, FF (pink, downward triangle), in PSCs using the four spiro-OMeTAD recipes. It presents that the efficiency follows a similar trend to the Jsc, Voc and FF that decrease gradually from Rep_1 to Rep_3. However, after the addition of the cobalt salt into Rep_3, Rep_4 presents a strong increase in Voc and FF with a similar value in Jsc. Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs given in Fig. 1c.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is employed in this work to investigate the influence of the p-type cobalt dopant on the internal physical process in PSCs. Fig. 2 illustrates the Nyquist plots of Rep_1 as an example of PSCs that do not contain the cobalt dopant. Fig. 3 illustrates the Nyquist plots of Rep_4 for PSCs that contain the cobalt dopant. All the IS measurements are performed under 0.1 sun illumination at a series of forward biases from 0 V to 0.9 V. A lower light intensity is chosen for this study to avoid the fast degradation in the efficiency of PSCs that are normally observed under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination. It should be noted that only a small degradation in the efficiency of PSCs is observed after constant illumination at 0.1 sun. The comparison of the photovoltaic performances of PSCs before and after IS measurements can be found in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI). The 0.1 sun light intensity was achieved by inserting a neutral light intensity filter in front of the 1 sun AM1.5G spectrum.

Fig. 2 and 3 show that both the real and imaginary parts of the impedance response decrease with the forward bias. This is because when the solar cells are measured at certain bias, the Fermi level of TiO2 is fixed to that bias. Increasing the forward bias uplifts the Fermi level of electrons in TiO2 towards the conduction band. As a result, the system becomes more and more conductive as the bias increases, which results in a decrease in impedance.
The equivalent circuit used to fit the IS data is given in Scheme 1a. It can be seen that the equivalent circuit is composed of two capacitors in parallel. Cbulk refers to the geometric capacitance of the bulk perovskite layer and R1 refers to the transport resistance of the perovskite layer. Cμ refers to the chemical capacitance of the TiO2/perovskite interface and R2 refers to the recombination resistance at the TiO2/perovskite interface. The validity of the equivalent circuit has been discussed somewhere else. It can be seen that the equivalent circuit in Scheme 1a does not consider the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. This is because the Helmholtz layer capacitance, CH, at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface is normally much larger than the chemical capacitance, Cμ, formed at the TiO2/perovskite interface. In the equivalent circuit given in Scheme 1b, the two interfaces are represented by two capacitors in series. As a result, the overall capacitance is dominated by the interface that has a much smaller capacitance. In this case, it is the chemical capacitance, Cμ, at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Thus, Scheme 1b can be simplified into Scheme 1a. It is presented as one semi-circle in the low frequency range in Nyquist plots in Fig. 2 and 3. However, as will be discussed below, when the capacitances of the two interfaces are equivalent to each other, it will be hard (i) to identify them in the Nyquist plot where it occurs frequently when only one semi-circle is observed, and (ii) to distinguish them from each other even if in some cases two semi-circles are observed, because the two capacitors are connected in series.
The chemical capacitance, Cμ, and recombination resistance, R2, extracted from the low frequency semi-circle in Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4. The geometric capacitance, Cbulk, transport resistance, R1, and dielectric relaxation time, τ1, of the bulk perovskite layer extracted from the high frequency semi-circle in Nyquist plots can be found in Fig. S6 (ESI). Fig. 4a shows that Rep_3 has the highest chemical capacitance. As discussed by Bisquert et al., chemical capacitance is proportional to the density of electronic states in the system. As a result, the high chemical capacitance observed in Rep_3 indicates a higher charge density in the system, which leads to more recombination occurring in the system. The smallest recombination resistance is observed in Rep_3, as shown in Fig. 4b. The electron lifetime, τ2, calculated from R2Cμ is plotted as a function of bias in Fig. S7 (ESI). It can be seen that the electron lifetime in Rep_3 is much smaller than those of Rep_1 and Rep_2 due to the severe recombination in Rep_3. As discussed above, the chemical capacitance and recombination resistance refer to the TiO2/perovskite interface. Therefore, the adjustment in the concentrations of dopants in the HTM can directly affect the charge accumulation and recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface as well. In fact, this is not surprising. It is reported that fluorescence quenching is observed in the perovskite film measured from time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) when an effective hole selective layer is coated with the perovskite/ETM. This means that when holes in the perovskite layer can be effectively extracted at the perovskite/HTM interface, electrons accumulated at the ETM/perovskite interface would be decreased accordingly. More interestingly, from Fig. 4, it can be seen that after the addition of the cobalt complex as the third dopant in Rep_3, Rep_4 exhibits an enhancement in recombination resistance and electron lifetime with a decrease in chemical capacitance.
The correlation between recombination resistance and chemical capacitance is further analyzed. Fig. 5a displays that all PSCs without the cobalt complex behave similarly, where the recombination resistance, R2, exhibits a linear decrease as the chemical capacitance increases. However, it is not the case for PSCs that contain the cobalt complex. In contrast, the recombination resistance, R2, shows a small positive slope in the linear fitting as the chemical capacitance increases. This phenomenon is further confirmed by the data extracted from IS measurements under 1 sun illumination. Fig. 5b displays the correlation between the recombination resistance and chemical capacitance of Rep_2 (red, circle) and Rep_4 (pink, downward triangle) extracted from the impedance response measured at 0.1 sun (open symbols) and 1 sun (filled symbols). It shows that for Rep_2 the chemical capacitance is increased while the recombination resistance is decreased when the incident light intensity increases from 0.1 sun to 1 sun. This is easy to understand because a higher light intensity means a higher concentration of photo-generated charge carriers in the system; thus the chemical capacitance is increased, which leads to more chances of recombination and a decrease in recombination resistance. In contrast, it is observed in Rep_4 (Fig. 5b) that the recombination resistance is slightly enhanced as the light intensity increases. Interestingly, under both 0.1 sun and 1 sun illumination, the recombination resistance in Rep_4 exhibits a tentative increase as the chemical capacitance increases. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first time that this interesting phenomenon has been observed in PSCs. This rare phenomenon indicates that something is changed in the physical process of PSCs and it requires that the equivalent circuit that is used to interpret the IS data be re-examined.
As discussed above, when the Helmholtz layer capacitance, CH, at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface is reduced to a similar value of the chemical capacitance of the TiO2/perovskite interface, the overall surface capacitance, Cs, will be contributed by two parts, rather than being dominated by one. Therefore, Cs can be expressed as:
Cs−1 = Cμ−1 + CH−1
(1)
It is proposed that the Helmholtz layer capacitance, CH, at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface could be significantly reduced by the addition of the cobalt complex. Thus, the recombination resistance R3 in parallel with CH increases. As mentioned above, the difference in the semi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes in the system is increased with the addition of the cobalt complex, and results in a higher Voc. As a result, it is expected that the recombination of electrons back transferred from the TiO2 conduction band to the valence band of the perovskite would be enhanced due to a higher driving force. Therefore, the recombination resistance R2 would be reduced. Based on this hypothesis, the overall surface capacitance, Cs, of Rep_4 is expected to be smaller compared to the chemical capacitance, Cμ, of Rep_3. This expectation is confirmed by the data shown in Fig. 4a, where a smaller capacitance in Rep_4 is observed. Furthermore, the overall surface recombination resistance, Rrec, that accounts for the summary of R2 and R3 is observed to be enhanced from Fig. 4b. Moreover, when the overall surface capacitance, Cs, of Rep_4 increases, the overall recombination resistance shows a tendency to increase slightly due to the trade-off between the recombination resistance R2 at the perovskite/TiO2 interface and the recombination resistance R3 at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Therefore, this hypothesis is supported by the data in Fig. 4 and it helps in interpreting the interesting phenomenon (unusual correlation between recombination resistance and surface capacitance and light intensity) in Rep_4, as observed in Fig. 5. It is believed that this exceptional correlation between recombination resistance and surface capacitance contributes to the significantly enhanced fill factor in Rep_4, compared to the other PSCs without the cobalt additive (Table 1).
The impact of the cobalt complex on the stability of PSCs is also examined. After fabrication, samples are stored inside a nitrogen-filled glove box in the dark, and only taken out for the measurement. Fig. 6a compares fresh and one-week aged samples of Rep_3 and Rep_4. It can be seen that the chemical capacitances of the aged samples of both Rep_3 and Rep_4 are increased when measured under 1 sun illumination. The data in Fig. 5b indicate that compared with the fresh samples the aged samples are not that efficient with regard to charge extraction. The photovoltaic performances of the aged samples of both Rep_3 and Rep_4 are given in Fig. 6b. Furthermore, Fig. 6a shows that the recombination resistance Rrec in the aged samples of Rep_4 holds a similar trend against the chemical capacitance to the fresh samples. Moreover, it is also noted that the recombination resistance Rrec in the aged samples of Rep_4 is decreased to about half of its initial value. However, the recombination resistance Rrec that is equal to R2 in the aged samples of Rep_3 is slightly increased compared with that of the fresh samples. Consequently, it is observed that the efficiency of the aged samples of Rep_4 is degraded much more rapidly than Rep_3 (Table 2). It should be noted that the average PCE of Rep_3 is higher for the aged samples than the fresh samples. This is because some devices that have a relatively good efficiency on day 1 JV measurement show a slight decrease in efficiency on day 7 JV measurement, while other devices that exhibit a poor efficiency on day 1 JV measurement show a decent enhancement on day 7 JV measurement. Therefore, the cobalt complex as the third dopant in spiro-OMeTAD does not help in improving the stability of PSCs in the context of this work. Interestingly, Burschka et al. observed an enhancement in stability for cobalt additive containing ss-DSCs. This could be because they sealed their devices using epoxy before the stability test. Similar to this study, without sealing the devices, Badia et al. also observed a severe decrease in the efficiency of PSCs that contain cobalt complexes compared to the reference samples.

In summary, it is observed that in PSCs that contain a cobalt dopant in spiro-OMeTAD HTM, the overall recombination resistance shows a tentative growth as the surface charge capacitance increases. In contrast, a negative linear correlation between the recombination resistance and charge capacitance is observed in cobalt dopant-free PSCs. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first time that this unusual phenomenon in PSCs stemming from the influence of the cobalt dopant has been reported. It is believed that, in the presence of the cobalt dopant, the Helmholtz layer capacitance, CH, at the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface can be significantly reduced to a similar level of chemical capacitance at the TiO2/perovskite interface, which leads to a new equivalent circuit proposed in this study for the interpretation of the IS data. Finally, from the stability test, it is found that, without encapsulation, PSCs without the cobalt dopant showed better stability than devices with the cobalt dopant.


2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) used in this study was purchased from Lumtec. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and the Co(III)TFSI complex tris(1-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol)cobalt(III) tris(hexafluorophosphate) (FK102) were purchased from Dyesol. Titania (TiO2) paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was purchased from Solaronix. Pre-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received.


Pre-patterned FTO glass was cleaned by ultrasonication in warm soap water, acetone, and isopropanol, respectively, for 10 min before use. A TiO2 compact layer (∼30 nm) was spin-coated from a sol–gel solution prepared by diluting titanium isopropoxide (97%, Sigma Aldrich) in isopropanol, and then calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. A TiO2 mesoporous layer (∼200 nm) was spin-coated from diluted commercial TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix) in isopropanol, and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The MAPbI2.85Br0.15 perovskite precursor was prepared by adding 170 mg of MAI, 415 mg of PbI2, and 36.7 mg of PbBr2 in 1 ml of anhydrous DMF, and then kept stirring at 70 °C until a transparent yellowish solution was formed. Before use, the room temperature perovskite solution was filtered (0.45 μm filter, Sigma). For the deposition of perovskite films, methods given in the ref. 39 were adopted. More specifically, MAPbI2.85Br0.15 perovskite films (∼153 nm) were prepared by spin-coating the above solution at 6k rpm for 30 s, while N2 purge was introduced at 5 s after starting spin-coating, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. It is worth noting that the film thicknesses of the TiO2 compact layer, TiO2 mesoporous layer, and MAPbI2.85Pb0.15 perovskite film are all measured using atomic force microscopy (see more details in the Characterization section). After the deposition of the perovskite layer in an ambient atmosphere, all samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box, where a spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited. Recipe 1: 1 ml of spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 79.65 mg of spiro-MeTAD in anhydrous chlorobenzene (CBN) to 16.5 μl of LiTFSI (bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt, 99.95%, Sigma) out of 520 mg ml−1 stock solution in acetonitrile, and 29.3 μl of tBP (4-tert-butylpyridine, 96%, Sigma). Recipe 2: 1 ml of spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 83.2 mg of spiro-MeTAD in anhydrous chlorobenzene CBN to 15 μl of LiTFSI out of 520 mg ml−1 stock solution in acetonitrile, and 38.8 μl of tBP. Recipe 3: 1 ml of spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 75 mg of spiro-MeTAD in anhydrous CBN to 17.5 μl of LiTFSI out of 520 mg ml−1 stock solution in acetonitrile, and 28.8 μl of tBP. Recipe 4: 1 ml of spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 75 mg of spiro-MeTAD in anhydrous chlorobenzene CBN to 17.5 μl of LiTFSI out of 520 mg ml−1 stock solution in acetonitrile, 28.8 μl of tBP and 29 μl of FK102 out of 300 mg ml−1 stock solution in CBN. A spiro-OMeTAD layer was prepared by spin-coating the above solution at 4k rpm for 30 s. Then all samples were taken out of the glove box and kept inside a desiccator in the dark. The dark oxygen-soaking time was controlled to be 20 hours. Finally, Au of 80 nm was thermally deposited on top as the metal contact.


The film thicknesses of the TiO2 compact layer, TiO2 mesoporous layer and MAPbI2.85Br0.15 perovskite layer were measured on an Asylum MFP-3D-Bio atomic force microscope (AFM). Photovoltaic measurements were performed with a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT 128N). The light source is a xenon arc lamp. An AM1.5 global filter was used to simulate 1 sun at 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was calibrated with a certified reference Si cell system (Oriel Reference Solar Cell and Meter). The active area of PSCs was 0.36 cm2, and an aperture area of 0.21 cm2 was confined by a mask applied during the JV measurement. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed at 0.1 sun and 1 sun at forward biases from 0 V to 0.9 V using an FRA2 integrated with the PGSTAT 128N. Each impedance measurement was recorded at frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz in equally spaced logarithmic steps. Neutral intensity filters were used to adjust the incident light intensity.
