We demonstrate effective morphology control of a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with a lead(II) thiocyanate additive. The perovskite crystal size is remarkably enlarged from the nanometer to the micrometer scale with only 3% Pb(SCN)2 in solid perovskite films. Large-sized perovskite crystals enable effective enhancement of the carrier lifetime, which eventually leads to the overall improvement of the device performance of perovskite solar cells.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted a great deal of research attention since the noticeable device performance demonstration in 2009. The general chemical formula of a hybrid perovskite is AMX3, where the A site is the organic cation, the M site is the metal cation and the X site is the halogen anion. Such a hybrid crystal structure demonstrates superior optoelectronic properties, including optimal band-gap (∼1.5 eV), high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length (∼1 μm) and high carrier mobility (∼25 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, these properties are widely tunable with various elements positioned at A, M and X, such as methyl ammonium iodide, formamidinium iodide, lead(II) iodide, lead(II) chloride, etc.

It is now well-recognized that the perovskite film morphology is crucial for the optoelectronic properties of high performance solar cells. A uniform and dense film morphology with a large crystal grain size is generally beneficial to the overall device performance. To date, many different approaches have been exploited for this purpose, including substrate pre-heating (∼190 °C) and the use of organic halide additives, such as methyl ammonium chloride and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Unfortunately, these approaches commonly require high temperature treatment, which is generally undesirable for effective continuous processing, particularly on flexible polymer substrates. Moreover, organic additives have revealed marginal effects on the film morphology.
Recently, pseudohalide-based perovskites have emerged as alternatives to conventional lead halides. A pseudohalide is an analogue of a halide comprising of multi-atoms, including a nitrogen instead of a halogen, which shows similar characteristics to original halide materials. Incorporation of a pseudohalide instead of a conventional lead halide is known to enhance moisture tolerance and radiative recombination efficiency, due to the stable crystal structure caused by the strong interaction between Pb2+ and pseudohalide anions. Obviously, different interactions between halogen or pseudohalogen anions and Pb2+ may cause morphological variation. However, the role of a pseudohalide in the perovskite film formation still remains unclear.
In this work, we first report the control of perovskite film morphology with a pseudohalide additive based on low-temperature processing. Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) composed of methyl ammonium iodide and lead(II) iodide is used as the principal light absorbing layer, while lead(II) thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) is used as the pseudohalide additive. SCN anions are partly substituted for I anions, resulting in a CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x perovskite. Notably, along with the concentration of the Pb(SCN)2 additive, the crystal grain size is dramatically increased from the nanometer to the micrometer scale (∼150 nm to ∼5 μm), which is due to the retarded perovskite crystal nucleation caused by the Pb(SCN)2 additive. The significant increase in short circuit current density is attributed to the large grain size, which governs the overall power conversion efficiency of solar cells. Our approach proposes an efficient route for the large grain growth of perovskite crystals up to the micrometer scale without high temperature treatment.


Fig. 1(a)–(e) present the morphological variation of perovskite films with different amounts of the Pb(SCN)2 additive, ranging from 0 to 0.18 mol. Notably, Pb(SCN)2 effectively enlarges the crystal grain size, as summarized in Fig. 1(f). When the Pb(SCN)2 concentration is over 0.1 mol, micrometer-scale grains are observed. Although the magnified SEM images show large grains with small grains in films with the Pb(SCN)2 additive (ESI, Fig. S1), the average grain size reaches up to 5 μm with 0.15 mol Pb(SCN)2. Cross-sectional SEM observation confirms a highly crystalline CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x perovskite structure throughout the entire film thickness of ∼300 nm (ESI, Fig. S2). Furthermore, the surface roughness of perovskite films is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (ESI, Fig. S3 and Table S1). Increased surface roughness is observed in films with the Pb(SCN)2 additive compared to that without Pb(SCN)2. However, the solar cell performance is unaffected by the surface roughness (Fig. 3(b)).

A CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite follows the general chemical formula AMX3, where A is cornered CH3NH3+, M is Pb and X are body-centered I anions which occupy six anion sites. This crystal structure is described in Fig. 1(g). It is noteworthy that a CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x perovskite has a nearly same crystalline structure as a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite except for the X sites. Some of the SCN anions in Pb(SCN)2 are partly substituted in place of I anions. Fig. 1(g) confirms the existence of SCN anions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), where a distinguishable –SCN peak near 2100 cm−1 is clearly observed. This shows that the Pb(SCN)2 additive is successfully included in the perovskite crystalline structure. The partially substituted SCN anions effectively influence the perovskite film morphology: ∼150 nm sized grains of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite are enlarged up to ∼5 μm.
We compares the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-deposited perovskite precursor film with and without a Pb(SCN)2 additive. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the as-coated pure CH3NH3PbI3 film without an additive. Noticeably, the transparent as-deposited film turns brown after 20 min at room temperature, due to the phase transition from the intermediate phase (under 10 degrees) into the perovskite phase. By contrast, the precursor film with a Pb(SCN)2 additive remains in the transparent state after 20 minutes, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Although a small perovskite (110) peak is observed after 20 minutes, a large part of the precursor film consists of the intermediate phase, indicating a significantly retarded crystallization process.
In general, the principal parameters affecting the crystal grain size are the crystal nucleation and growth rates. If the nucleation rate is relatively faster than the growth rate, relatively small grains will be formed. Fig. 2(c) and (d) depict the Gibbs free energy diagrams as a function of the nuclei radius. In the case of CH3NH3PbI3, the energy barrier for nucleation is relatively low, as is well-recognized. Thus, numerous nuclei are formed and smaller grains are grown (Fig. 2(c)). By contrast, the Gibbs energy for nucleation with a Pb(SCN)2 additive can be significantly higher due to the chemical heterogeneity effect, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Accordingly, relatively less nuclei are formed, which results in large size grain growth.
The solar cell performance is evaluated by utilizing inverted type planar structures shown in Fig. 3(a). We sequentially deposit a PEDOT:PSS layer (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), hole transport layer), a perovskite without and with a Pb(SCN)2 additive (light absorbing layer), PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, electron transport layer) and Ca/Al (cathode) on an ITO substrate (indium tin oxide, anode). Fig. 3(b) presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics as a function of Pb(SCN)2 concentration. The corresponding solar cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells without an additive exhibit an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.49 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 72.93% and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.08%. As shown in Fig. 3(b), Jsc significantly varies with Pb(SCN)2 concentration, which agrees well with the crystal grain size increase (Fig. 1(f)). Fig. 3(c) presents the absorbance spectra of perovskite films with different concentrations of Pb(SCN)2, where no significant difference is observed. Therefore, the increase in Jsc is mainly attributed to the enhancement of the electrical properties of the CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x film with enlarged grains and less grain boundaries.Fig. 3(d) compares the time-resolved photoluminescence of the perovskite films with and without 0.15 mol Pb(SCN)2 additive. The carrier lifetime is increased from 101.9 ns to 155.4 ns, with large grains and less grain boundaries, signifying reduced photo-generated charge carrier recombination.Fig. 3(e) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite solar cells. Obviously, the Pb(SCN)2 additive brings out effective enhancement of the overall EQE. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) confirms again the better photo-generated charge carrier collection in CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x perovskite solar cells (Fig. 3(f)). However, when an excessive amount (0.18 mol) of the Pb(SCN)2 additive is added, EQE decreases along with the formation of an inhomogeneous film morphology.

We compares the crystallinity of the perovskite film as a function of Pb(SCN)2 concentration (ESI, Fig. S4) based on XRD measurements. Although the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the perovskite (110) plane decreases with the amount of the Pb(SCN)2 additive, the remaining PbI2 is observed at 12.8° due to the non-stoichiometric composition of organic and inorganic precursors with excess Pb(SCN)2. To improve film homogeneity, the amount of the organic precursor is increased to convert PbI2 to perovskite. Fig. 4(a) shows the XRD pattern of the perovskite film with an additional 0.3 mol organic precursor. The PbI2 crystal peak is notably diminished while maintaining the perovskite peaks and film morphology (Fig. 4(a), inset) which results in an increase in Jsc. Hysteresis of solar cells with 0 mol and 0.15 mol Pb(SCN)2 is measured with a scan rate ranging from 35 mV s−1 to 120 mV s−1 (ESI, Fig. S5 and S6 and Table S2). Negligible hysteresis characteristics are observed regardless of the presence of a Pb(SCN)2 additive, indicating that the electron and hole flux is well balanced despite the enlargement of grains with the Pb(SCN)2 additive. Eventually, the best solar cell performance of the homogeneous perovskite film is 11.6% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 17.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.5%, as shown in in Fig. 4(b).

We have demonstrated the notable enhancement of perovskite crystal grain size under a low temperature process using a pseudohalide lead salt, Pb(SCN)2, as an additive. The retarded crystal formation caused by the pseudohalide additive induces grain size enlargement from ∼150 nm to ∼5 μm. The perovskite film with large grains improves the overall solar cell performance as well as the carrier lifetime. Therefore, the best PCE of a CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x perovskite solar cell is increased by about 90% compared to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. Our approach proposes a facile method for the crystal grain size control of an organic–inorganic perovskite film at low temperature. Such an effective method for morphology control should be generally useful for many different perovskite-based devices, including light-emitting diodes, lasers, and thin film transistors.
