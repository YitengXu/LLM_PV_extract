In this work, we successfully synthesized SnS2 nanoparticles, a hollowed-out netty MoS2 (nMoS2) nanostructure, a flower-like MoS2 (fMoS2) nanostructure, an nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure, and an fMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure via a simple and facile hydrothermal process. We used powder X-ray diffractograms to verify purity and crystalline phases of the as-prepared samples. Additionally, the structures and morphologies of as-prepared components were checked by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled with this original heterostructure as a counter electrode (CE) displayed a splendid power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.63% along with stable catalytic performance for triiodide reduction. This is better than other DSSCs including: SnS2 CE (6.67%), nMoS2 CE (5.78%), fMoS2 CE (5.37%), and fMoS2@SnS2 CE (7.08%). According to our experimental results, we believe that the outstanding performance of nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructures for a DSSC is because of their characteristic crystal structure, which may contribute to playing a heterogeneous and synergistic effect between the active materials, optimize dispersity of the samples, avoid recombination of electron–hole pairs to accelerate velocity of triiodide reduction, and enhance stability in a I3−/I− electrolyte. Hence, the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure can play a better role in DSSCs with excellent performance and superior stability as an efficient CE.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a reproducible and environmental-based energy source, play a significant role in academic circles owing to their low cost, convenient manufacturing technology, environmental friendliness, and relative high photoelectric efficiency since the contributions of O'Regan and Grätzel. In view of this, the DSSC is likely to become the next generation of solar cells. Generally, a DSSC typically consists of a photoanode made of porous TiO2 which is loaded with dye molecules, an electrolyte containing I3−/I− redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE) attached with electrocatalysts. It is important that the counter electrode usually reveals a unique effect for conductivity and the catalyzer, in which it can connect the external circle by collecting electrons and it can also play a catalytic role in the reduction reaction of I3− from the TiO2 photoanode.

Platinum has attracted lots of attention as a CE due to its prominent performance. However, it is not only the most expensive component in DSSCs but also is easy to be disabled during the electrolyte reaction of the I3−/I− redox couple. As a result, it becomes imperative to solve these problems. One strategy is to explore Pt-free catalysts for CE materials with characteristics such as low cost and high catalytic activity. Another is to replace the N719 dye or electrolyte such as Kenji Kakiage et al. assembled in a DSSC with a Pt CE and F:[Co(phen)3]3+/2+ electrolyte; this combination displayed high PCE of 13.8% that exceeded the DSSC with the I3−/I− electrolyte (11.2%).
What we devoted our research efforts to was to design and fabricate a characteristic crystal structure and apply it as counter electrodes of DSSCs, in which we attempted to use a common strategy to try to find a relatively outstanding counter electrode material. Fortunately, many Pt-free materials have been prepared and much research has been done for DSSCs, such as transition metal oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and carbides. Among these materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a two-dimensional (2D) structure, known as graphene analogues, which would make them attractive in electronic, optical, and chemical fields. Tin disulfide and molybdenum disulfide, as typical members of TMDs, have demonstrated great potentials for DSSCs which depend on their environmental-friendly properties, excellent chemical stability, and low cost nature. Tin disulfide (SnS2) has been researched with gas sensors, photocatalysts, and anode materials having high electrocatalytic activities. For the application of CEs for DSSC, Chen et al. successfully synthesized SnS2 that yielded a 5.14% PCE with a hydrothermal process and Yang et al. prepared SnS2 nanoparticles and use them as a CE with a good PCE of 6.30%. Nevertheless, due to its relatively weak electrical conductivity, SnS2 CEs have never been able to complete the task very well. A few-layer MoS2 has received considerable attention owing to its edge-controlled catalytic properties and is considered to be an efficient co-catalyst. Due to its bandgap tunability nature, MoS2 also has proven to be a replaceable candidate for graphene. Hence, MoS2-based catalysts have been extensively employed in Li-ion batteries, hydrogen evolution reactions, transistors, and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Recently, we had researched MoS2 under the modification of amorphous carbon and applied them as CEs for DSSCs; these displayed fantastic performance. Typically, S. Jiang et al. developed 3D MoS2 nanoflakes on a graphene aerogel and a DSSC with a CE of the MoS2/GA hybrid revealed a higher PCE of 4.39%; more than pure MoS2 (2.2%) and Pt (7.2%). Hence, although SnS2 and MoS2 show relatively good catalytic activity in many reports, few studies about the MoS2@SnS2 heterostructure have been reported for DSSCs. Also, some papers report enhanced performance of DSSCs through the formation of heterostructures including Zn2SnO4@SnO2, MoS2@SnO2, SnO2@SnS2, and MoS2@WS2.
Herein for the first time, we report synthesizing a morphology-controlled molybdenum disulfide loaded on a tin disulfide (MoS2@SnS2) heterostructure as efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs, where the MoS2 renders an efficient co-catalyst that can play synergistic effects with active SnS2 nanoparticle, as well as an electron collector which can anchor SnS2 nanoparticles to facilitate redox reactions with their abundant edge-plane active sites. Experimental results revealed that these novel nanostructures exhibited high photovoltaic conversion efficiency, in which nMoS2@SnS2 CE played the best PCE of 7.63%. It should be mentioned that we only focused on the design and fabrication of the CEs with equipment including a TiO2 photoanode, N719 dye, and electrolyte. These all were purchased from commercial markets for this work.

SnS2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a solvothermal method with SnCl4·5H2O, CH3CSNH2, and ethylene glycol. Step 1: 4 mmol CH3CSNH2 was dispersed in 70 mL ethylene glycol and stirred for 5 minutes. Step 2: 1 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O was dispersed in this solution. Step 3: ultrasonication for 5 min and stirred for 20 min. After that, a clean 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave plus an electric-heated drum wind drying oven was prepared to accommodate the mixed solution, into which the solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave was kept at 200 °C for 12 h. After the Teflon-lined autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the resulting yellow precipitate was collected by high speed centrifugation at 6000 rpm and alternately washed with absolute ethanol and distilled water for several times. Finally, the as-prepared yellow samples were dried at 60 °C for 12 hours.

To synthesize the fMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure, 2.5 mmol SnS2 was dissolved in distilled water, placed in 20 mL PEI solution (2 g L−1), sonicated, and stirred for 30 min. Then, 2.5 mmol thiourea was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water in another beaker and stirred for 10 minutes. Before ultrasonic decomposition, this solution was stirred for 20 min and then 1 mmol of MoO3 was added to it. Finally, these two solutions were mixed together for 30 min under magnetic stirring. The following steps are similar to the synthesis of SnS2 nanoparticles. In particular, the aforesaid hydrothermal treatment describing “200 °C for 12 h” should be replaced by “180 °C for 24 h” in this part. To obtain the final sample, the as-prepared sample must be annealed at 700 °C for 5 h under the protection of argon.
The nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructures were synthesized from thioacetamide and molybdenum trioxide in 70 mL distilled water under a hydrothermal treatment “200 °C for 24 h”. Excepting for this, the process of the experiment was similar to the previous fMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure. The synthesis process of MoS2@SnS2 nanocomposites is illustrated in Scheme 1. In particular, the pure fMoS2 and nMoS2 samples can be obtained without the PEI solution and existence of SnS2 nanoparticles.

The CEs were made by mixing 0.05 g samples with 0.013 g PEG20000 in an agate mortar and stirred in about 1.5 mL absolute ethyl alcohol until a fluid mixture formed. By using a scalpel and 3 M transparent adhesive tape, the premier CEs could be obtained on the FTO with a suitable thickness and an area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. After drying naturally, the final CEs could be obtained by heating at 400 °C for 1 h under the protection of argon.

A sandwich DSSC device typically consists of sandwiching an electrolyte between a porous TiO2 anode and an as-prepared CE. The TiO2 anodes were purchased with an area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2, and were sensitized by immersing into a 0.50 mmol ethanol solution of N719 dye for about 20 h at an indoor temperature. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the TiO2 anode and counter electrode, in which 0.6 M 1-propy1-2, 0.5 M LiI, 3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-buylpyridine in acetonitrile solvent was filled. The CEs include pure SnS2, fMoS2, fMoS2@SnS2, nMoS2, nMoS2@SnS2, and commercially available Pt.
Just like Scheme 2, the energy band structure was displayed, in which MoS2 shows a higher CB edge and higher VB edge than SnS2. (I) Under illumination, SnS2 and MoS2 can be excited and produce photo-generated electron–hole pairs. (II) The electrons can be excited from the VB to the CB and the holes will exist on the VB level naturally. (III) Even though the electrons and holes are easy to recombine, the MoS2@SnS2 heterostructure will play a remedial role. When SnS2 is contacted with MoS2 to form an I-type heterostructure, the photo-generated electrons on the CB level of MoS2 can easily flow to the CB of SnS2. Instead, the holes on the VB level of SnS2 can also flow to the CB of MoS2. This heterostructure can not only provide the electrons and accelerate velocity of the triiodide reduction, but also decrease the probability of the recombination of electron–hole pairs, resulting in an enhanced catalytic reaction of I3− and I−. The band structure of XS2 (X = Mo, Sn) is cited from papers and the picture of the XS2 (X = Mo, Sn) CE is from the cross-section SEM image of a sample.

Scheme 2 described the working principle of the DSSCs, in which the detail process includes three parts: (I) the photons were absorbed by N719 dye, which leads to the existence of electrons and holes, which then were motivated from HOMO in VB to LUMO in CB. (II) The electrons were immediately transferred to the external circuit through the CB of TiO2. (III) These electrons then transferred into the XS2 (X = Mo, Sn) CEs to facilitate the I3− reduction through the interface of CE and the electrolyte.

A Rigaku D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer (XRD 6000, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) can characterize the crystallographic structure and phase purity of the as-synthesized samples with the CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC-PHI Inc., Japan) analysis was measured on an ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100SX, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4800, Japan) were characterized to display the microstructures of samples. The former was in a process of the MAG1 mode and performed at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, and the latter was carried out at an acceleration voltage of 1 kV and in a process of blend modes (secondary electron and back scattered electron). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were carried out by a digital source meter (Keithley 2410, Shanghai Photoelectricity Device Company, China), implemented by using a solar light simulator under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and AM 1.5. To investigate the chemical stability and catalytic activity of the CEs of samples, cyclic voltammetry tests were conducted using a three-electrode system in a solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNERZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation using an impedance measurement unit at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 106 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. Tafel polarization curves also were performed this way. In particular, EIS and Tafel measurements were all implemented under room temperature.



Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of SnS2 and MoS2@SnS2 heterostructures. Dominant peaks at about at 2θ of 15.1°, 28.2°, 32.2°, 50.1°, 52.5°, 63.1°, and 70.3° are unambiguously indexed as the (001), (100), (101), (110), (111), (004), and (113) crystal planes of SnS2 (JCPD card, No. 23-0677). Meanwhile, all the diffraction peaks of MoS2 were indexed as a pure flower-like or netty structure in good agreement with the reported data (JCPD card, No. 37-1492). For XRD patterns of the as-prepared fMoS2@SnS2 and nMoS2@SnS2, all the diffraction peaks matched with corresponding data of SnS2 and MoS2. From the XRD patterns, no other characteristic peaks corresponding to any impurity were obtained.

To further investigate the chemical composition and valence states of samples, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were generated, and the spectra of nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructures are displayed in Fig. 2. Fig. 2d shows the XPS survey spectrum, which verifies the presence of Sn, Mo, and S elements. XPS peaks for C 1s, O 1s, and O 2s were at 284.8 eV, 540 eV, and 25 eV, which are attributed to adventitious carbon from the XPS instrument. A typical high resolution XPS spectrum of Sn 3d is shown in Fig. 2a, in which two peaks at 486.8 eV and 495.3 eV are assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively, which is a characteristic of Sn4+ in SnS2. Similarly, in Fig. 2b, two peaks at 228.7 eV and 232.5 eV are attributed to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, which is a characteristic of Mo4+ in MoS2. Fig. 2c shows the XPS spectrum of the S 2p region, which can be fitted into two peaks: S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, which appear at 161.7 eV and 162.8 eV, respectively. The XPS results further confirmed the coexistence of SnS2 and MoS2 in the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructures, which agrees well with the XRD results.
The morphologies of pure SnS2, MoS2, and MoS2@SnS2 heterostructures are characterized with SEM and TEM. Fig. 3a and b show the TEM images of porous SnS2 nanoparticles. In the case of pure SnS2, round and plate-shaped nanoparticles with a size of 80 nm were observed. Their high crystalline properties were also confirmed by their crystalline lattice direction. Fig. 3c and d show the TEM images of fMoS2 and nMoS2; these flower-like and netty structures had been observed, respectively. Due to the flower or hollowed-out netty structure, fMoS2 or nMoS2 possess a large specific surface area. When SnS2 was added, more SnS2 nanoparticles are spread uniformly on the surface of MoS2. A mixture of irregular nanoparticles with various shapes could be observed on the surface of the MoS2 flower-like structure and MoS2 netty structure from Fig. 3e and f. Also, from Fig. 3e–h (TEM, and SEM images of fMoS2@SnS2 and nMoS2@SnS2), the heterogeneous and synergistic effect makes the characteristic structure more efficiently and robustly visible, which can be proved in relevant tests.
Furthermore, as shown in the HRTEM images of Fig. 4a and b, the edge-planes of SnS2 nanoparticles are embedded in the surfaces of MoS2. The interlayer distances between the SnS2 nanoparticles from Fig. 3 are about 1.74 Å, 1.82 Å, 1.96 Å, and 3.16 Å, matching with the reported spacing between the (111), (110), (003), and (100) basal planes of SnS2. From these images, the lattice fringes of MoS2 could be found and the lattice spacing of 2.7 Å, which just corresponds to the crystal face (100) of MoS2 (JCPD card, No. 37-1492). Hence, we could further confirm that the as-prepared samples were pure and reliable.

In the hydrothermal process, CH4N2S and CH3CSNH2 played a key role and lead a series of reactions in aqueous solution. First, TAA and CH4N2S generated H2S through a hydrolysis process, which could not only introduce the S element but also play a key role of reducing agent to change MoO3 to MoS2. The reaction process can be summarized as the following equations:

CH3CSNH2 + H2O → CH3CONH2 + H2S
(1)
CH4N2S + H2O → CO2 + NH3 + H2S
(2)
Sn4+˙ + S2− + H2O → SnS2 + OH− + SO42−
(3)
MoO3˙ + S2− + H2O → MoS2 + OH− + SO42−
(4)
Under a relatively high temperature, eqn (3) and (4) can bring formation of SnS2 and MoS2 as sediments.
In order to investigate the mechanism to synthesize the different morphologies of fMoS2 and nMoS2, temperature-dependent (Fig. 5 and 6) and reagent-dependent (see comparison between Fig. 5 and 6) experiments were performed with other conditions kept fixed. In Fig. 5 and 6, the increasing temperatures from 140 °C to 200 °C were tested with thiourea and thioacetamide, respectively.
At 140 °C, irregular aggregations were obtained from Fig. 5a, which may be due to relatively low temperature causing ionic concentrations to be low, which then reduced the rate of reaction and formation of crystal particles. As a result, stable crystal particles were obtained because crystal nuclei were formed slower than crystals and, at the same time, particle sizes of the products could be larger and the products could be uneven. With an increase of reaction temperature, the rate of reaction and formation of crystal particles accelerated due to high surface energy. As revealed in Fig. 5b, after a process of oriented-growth and self-assembly, the flower-like MoS2 structures were preliminarily formed. When the temperature increased to 180 °C as in Fig. 5c, the MoS2 maybe faced optimal conditions and chose to grow in a relatively uniform and blooming way (Fig. 5e). As the temperature continued to increase to 200 °C, the outline of flower-like MoS2 turned blurry and the connection between the flowers was also reduced (Fig. 5d). As a comparison, the conditions in Fig. 6 were performed with thioacetamide from 140 °C to 200 °C, in which the hollowed-out netty structure could be seen. Unlike CH4N2S, the CH3CSNH2 reacted with H2O to form H2S and CH3CONH2, as confirmed by eqn (1) and (2), which was a circular crystal that was soluble in water and anhydrous ethanol. Although the intermediate product of acetamide (CH3CONH2) could not participate in the reaction of the formation of nMoS2, it could be dispersed in the aqueous solution to influence the reaction of MoO3 and H2S to influence the morphologies of MoS2. The growth of nMoS2 is more likely to aggregate a large area of active sites and form an interconnected gridding.
In particular, the structure of nMoS2 was more uniform and stable only when the temperature reached 200 °C (Fig. 6d and g). In Fig. 5a–d and 6a–d, the flower-like and netty structures are displayed, respectively. These indicate that temperature could play a non-obvious role in synthesis of the structure and formation of the crystal, while maybe it could have a small effect on the size and dispersion.
On the other hand, we could investigate the effect of the sulfur source in the formation of crystal by comparing Fig. 5 and 6. It was evident that the morphology features and crystal structures were different from sulfur sources through corresponding to the information in Fig. 5a–d and 6a–d, respectively. fMoS2 was synthesized via the thiourea with the flower-like structure, while nMoS2 with a netty structure was synthesized by thioacetamide.
In order to reveal the proposed formation mechanism for fMoS2 and nMoS2 nanocrystals, we tried to simply simulate the formation of morphologies in Scheme 3. First, MoO3 and CH4N2S or CH3CSNH2 was reacted and produced nucleation. Then, the particles were agglomerated to form bulky agglomerates, which were then oriented to grow on the surface of the agglomerates. As the reaction progressed, due to the oriented growth, which led to mutual compression, a handful of outline flower-like and netty structures occurred and these structures were optimized and plentiful after the self-assembly process under the corresponding conditions.

In order to test photoelectric conversion performance, the samples were applied as CEs (Fig. 7). The fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (η) of the solar cells could be calculated using the following equations:

(5)
(6)
where
Voc is the value of open-circuit photovoltage, Pin is the incident light power, short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the current density (Jmax), and the current voltage (Vmax), respectively.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves can be found in Fig. 7, in which the DSSCs are based on SnS2, fMoS2, fMoS2@SnS2, nMoS2, and nMoS2@SnS2. When the as-prepared nMoS2@SnS2 CE is used as a CE, the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor are 15.99 mA cm−2, 0.73 V, and 65%, respectively. Even though Pt displayed a PCE of 7.38%, the as-prepared nMoS2@SnS2 exhibited a higher PCE (7.63%); the results justify that the nMoS2@SnS2 CE possesses a preeminent photovoltaic performance due to its unique character, which exceeds other CEs under the same conditions. This figure also displays PCEs of samples of fMoS2@SnS2, fMoS2, nMoS2, and SnS2 with 7.08%, 5.37%, 5.78%, and 6.67%. The other corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

To further check the electrocatalytic activities of CEs for I3− reduction, cyclic voltammetry tests were available by using a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 (Pt as CE, various CEs as working electrodes and an Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode). Fig. 8 shows the CV curves of SnS2, fMoS2, fMoS2@SnS2, nMoS2, and nMoS2@SnS2 electrodes in an I3−/I− system. From Fig. 8, the oxidation (3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−) and reduction (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) peaks can be found, which corresponds to the photovoltaic property of CEs. The oxidation peak of ‘nMoS2@SnS2’ CE is higher, and the reduction peak is lower than Pt CE. Also, the values of Epp of nMoS2@SnS2 CE are 0.273 V, which is smaller than other samples' Epp values including a Pt CE (0.294 V) for the DSSC. The details of other samples can be seen in Fig. 8 and the inserted ‘Epp’ figure. The relationship of Epp values about Pt, SnS2, fMoS2, fMoS2@SnS2, nMoS2, and nMoS2@SnS2 is: ‘nMoS2@SnS2 < Pt < fMoS2@SnS2 < SnS2 < nMoS2 < fMoS2’, which matches the relationships of these PCEs (Fig. 7). This consequence indicates that nMoS2@SnS2 is the best electrocatalyst toward the reaction of the redox couple with the lowest Epp values and highest PCE, which can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the synergistic effect between nMoS2 and SnS2 for the nMoS2@SnS2 electrode.

CV curves of 30 cycles were scanned to verify chemical stability of the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure from Fig. 9, in which no apparent shifts or reduction in peaks was observed, indicating that the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure CE is stable in this electrolyte.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) can explain electron conductivity and interfacial charge transfer by symmetrical CEs separating with the electrolyte.

Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 10, in which the left arc represents the Rct values that symbolize charge-transfer resistance and the right arc (at low frequency) represents ZN values that may corresponded to the diffusion of I3−/I− in the electrolyte. Rs values are found on the intersection between the left arc and the real axis that correspond to series resistance of the electrolyte and electrodes. Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 10 and the EIS parameters are summarized in Table 1, in which the Rct values for SnS2, fMoS2, fMoS2@SnS2, nMoS2, nMoS2@SnS2, and Pt electrodes are 2.61 Ω cm2, 9.23 Ω cm2, 0.85 Ω cm2, 4.83 Ω cm2, 0.32 Ω cm2, and 0.61 Ω cm2, respectively. The nMoS2@SnS2 nanocomposite possesses the lowest Rct value of 0.32 Ω cm2, indicating that the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure has the highest electrocatalytic performance for I3− reduction, which may be due to the heterogeneous synergistic effect, in which the netty structure of MoS2 can disperse SnS2 nanoparticles and, at the same time, this heterogeneous structure can be helpful for the contact between active sites and the redox couple. Moreover, the as-obtained CEs, all displayed larger ZN, showed the slower diffusion velocity of the I3−/I− in the electrolyte than the Pt CE. Usually, a superior catalytic activity for I3− reduction means an excellent photovoltaic performance in DSSCs. Depending on the result of Rct, the catalytic activity of nMoS2@SnS2 CE was better than Pt CE, which proves nMoS2@SnS2 is an excellent CE. Customarily, an outstanding CE always has a smaller Rct and a smaller ZN, while the ZN of the nMoS2@SnS2 of this work was larger than the Pt CE. The same case has occurred in our previous work and other papers.
With the same electrolyte, all CE cells were subjected to other conditions that were kept fixed; the difference of the ZN could be attributed to many factors including the thickness, adhesion, particle size, features of the crystal, and so forth. The difference of ZN in this work could be due to the poriferous structure, morphologies, and thicker layer of the as-obtained CEs rather than the Pt layer, which is exhibited in Scheme 4. Giving an example of SnS2 and fMoS2, the I3−/I− of SnS2 would be easier to diffuse than fMoS2, as confirmed by the smaller ZN, which may be due to the tiny and thin crystal structure of SnS2, as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 3a and b. Also, due to the Pt CE of our work, which was purchased with a uniform Pt layer on FTO, we only fabricated the as-obtained CEs by the knife-coating procedure. When the electrolyte was injected in two identical CEs, it easily penetrated the CE materials, which would impede diffusion of I3−/I− in the electrolyte thus increasing the ZN, as confirmed by the larger ZN. On the other hand, the Pt layer was homogeneous and pyknotic, which was difficult to penetrate and was helpful for the diffusion of I3−/I−, as shown in Scheme 4.
To elucidate the results more accurately, the process of Tafel polarization measurements with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was the same as the EIS. Fig. 11 shows Tafel curves for the SnS2, fMoS2, fMoS2@SnS2, nMoS2, and nMoS2@SnS2 CEs. The slope of cathodic branches of the Tafel polarization curve corresponds to the value of the exchange current density (J0), which is proportional to the catalytic capacity about the reduction reaction toward triiodide. The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can be acquired according to the intersection of cathodic branch and Y-axis, which can assess the diffusion coefficient of the I3−/I− redox couple. As we can see from Fig. 11, the J0 of as-prepared CEs conform to the rule of nMoS2@SnS2 > Pt > fMoS2@SnS2 > SnS2 > nMoS2 > fMoS2, which are also the relationships about Jlim with CEs, which are closely associated with Rct according to eqn (7) and (8),

where
R, T, n, F, D, and l symbolize the gas constant, temperature, number of electrons transferred in the reduction reaction, Faraday constant, diffusion coefficient of I3−, and spacer thickness, respectively.

According to eqn (7) and (8), nMoS2@SnS2 CE has the highest J0 Value or Jlim value, which indicates that nMoS2@SnS2 CE, displayed with the lowest Rct value at the interface between electrolyte and electrode, accelerates the I3− reduction and electron transfer rate between I3−/I− at the active sites of the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure, and results in the lowest Epp value. In particular, the electrochemical activity of pure SnS2 or MoS2 was relevant to an increase in the number of catalytically active edge sites. Therefore, nMoS2@SnS2 CE has many edge sites due to MoS2 rendering an efficient co-catalyst that can play synergistic effects with active SnS2 nanoparticles as well as an electron collector, which can anchor SnS2 nanoparticles to facilitate redox reactions by abundant edge-plane active sites.

In summary, MoS2@SnS2 heterostructures were successfully prepared by a facile three-step synthetic process. Depending on a series of tests, the pure fMoS2, nMoS2 and SnS2 CEs displayed relatively weak electrocatalytic performance. So, we wanted to introduce a novel MoS2@SnS2 heterostructure to remedy the insufficient members to improve the performance for DSSCs based on the CEs.

Depending on the results of our research, the nMoS2@SnS2 heterostructure shows an outstanding catalytic capacity with an elevated PCE and perfect chemical stability. The PCE of nMoS2@SnS2 CE is 7.63%, which is higher than that of counter parts of Pt (7.38%). The nMoS2@SnS2 CE heterostructure played plentiful key roles in a DSSC due to specific crystal structures: (I) as the active site, the SnS2 nanoparticle is easily attached and it can play a synergistic effect with the MoS2. (II) The netty MoS2 acted as an excellent electrochemical conductor and efficient co-catalyst that accelerated the movement of electrons at the interfaces of the MoS2 and SnS2 nanoparticles. (III) A heterogeneous effect can not only provide the electrons but also decrease the probability of recombining electron–hole pairs, resulting in an enhanced catalytic reaction of I3− and I−. (IV) nMoS2@SnS2 with a hollowed-out netty structure can strengthen the connections between active sites and electrolyte, leading to promotion of charge-transfer rate due to a large catalytic surface area.
In brief, according to the results of a series of measurements, the nMoS2@SnS2 CEs revealed outstanding chemical stability and even better performance than a Pt CE under the same conditions. This means that an nMoS2@SnS2 nanocomposite can play an active role for DSSCs as a better candidate for CEs.
