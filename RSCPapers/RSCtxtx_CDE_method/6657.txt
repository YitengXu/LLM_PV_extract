A small push–pull compound involving a methyl-diphenylamine donor block connected to a dicyanovinyl acceptor group through a 2,5-thienyl spacer has been synthesized (1). Comparison with a reference compound containing a triphenylamine block (2) shows that the replacement of a phenyl group by a methyl group has limited effects on the electronic properties of the molecule but induces major changes in the structure and electronic properties of the resulting material such as a ∼0.30 eV reduction of the optical band gap and fifty-fold increase of the hole-mobility. Results of X-ray diffraction on single crystals show that the replacement of a phenyl by a methyl group results in a change from head-to-tail to face-to-face arrangement of the dipolar molecules in the crystal. A preliminary evaluation of the potential of the new compound as a donor material in basic bilayer cells of 0.28 cm2 with C60 as the acceptor reveals a ca. 33% increase of the power conversion efficiency compared to the reference compound.

Triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives are intensively investigated as hole-transporting materials for organic light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells (OSCs) as well as building blocks for the design of metal-free sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Recently, the chemistry of active materials for OSCs has witnessed an increasing interest for donor materials based on molecules. Research in this field is motivated by the advantages of well-defined chemical structures in terms of reproducibility of synthesis and purification, tuning of the electronic properties and analysis of structure–property relationships. In this context, triarylamine derivatives that combine strong electron-donor properties and high hole-mobility have attracted particular attention. Thus, in the past few years, various classes of molecular architectures involving TPA units have been developed as donor materials for OSCs.

Recently, solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells based on molecular donors with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) comparable to those obtained with the best polymer-based devices (∼10%) have been reported. These high performances are the result of a multi-disciplinary research effort in which device optimization, replacement of C60 by C70 derivatives acceptors, control of interfacial morphology by additives or solvent annealing are combined with new donor structures. Whereas these high efficiencies have been obtained with rather complex molecular architectures requiring multi-step syntheses, the development of active materials by simple and scalable syntheses compatible with future industrial production appears as a useful complementary approach to the optimization of PCE. In this regard, it is worth noting that PCEs of ∼7.0% have been achieved with single-junction cells based on molecular donors of small and simple structure.
Due to our continuing interest in the design of donors of simplified structure, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of structure–properties relationships in small push–pull systems based on triarylamine donor blocks. In this context, compound 2 in which a TPA unit is connected to a dicyanovinyl acceptor via a thienyl spacer (Scheme 1) has been selected as the reference system and starting platform for various structural manipulations of the molecular structure. This approach pursues the double objective of (i) optimizing the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the donor material and (ii) better understanding the structure–property relationships in this class of molecules. Such structural variations involve e.g. partial covalent rigidification of the structure, modulation of the internal charge transfer, drastic size reduction, or substitution of TPA by various aromatic substituents.
As part of a systematic analysis of the introduction of aliphatic substituents into the TPA donor block, we report here on the remarkable effects of the replacement of a phenyl ring of the TPA group of compound 2 by a methyl group on the electronic and photovoltaic properties of the resulting donor material 1.

Compound 2 was prepared as already reported. The synthesis of compound 1 is depicted in Scheme 1. N-Methylaniline 6 was reacted with 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene in the presence of sodium t-butoxide and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)-dipalladium(0) to give the bromo compound 5 in 30% yield. A Stille coupling of 5 with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene in toluene with tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium as the catalyst gave compound 4 (yield 42%). Vilsmeier formylation of 4 led to the formation of carboxaldehyde 3 in 80% yield and the target compound 1 was finally obtained in 85% yield by Knoevenagel condensation of aldehyde 3 with malonodinitrile.

The melting point of compound 1 (203 °C) is noticeably higher than that of compound 2 (127–129 °C) which gives a first indication about possible stronger intermolecular interactions. Fig. 1 shows the structure of a single crystal of 1 grown by slow evaporation from a chloroform solution. The molecule adopts a quasi-planar conformation from the inner benzene ring to the dicyanovinyl group (DCV) with a small dihedral angle of 4.20° between the DCV group and the adjacent thiophene and 1.88° between thiophene and the linked benzene ring. Comparison with compound 2 shows that the removal of an external phenyl ring leads to an increase of the dihedral angle between the outer and inner phenyl rings (69° vs. 61.2° and 64.8° for compound 2). An interesting feature of the crystal structure of compound 1 is that the replacement of a phenyl by a methyl group produces a modification of the molecular packing from the head-to-tail arrangement often observed for strongly dipolar push–pull molecules, (and in particular compound 1,) to a co-facial arrangement (Fig. 1 bottom).
The cyclic voltammogram of compounds 1 and 2 recorded in 0.10 M Bu4NPF6/CH2Cl2 shows a reversible one-electron oxidation wave peaking at (Epa) = 1.06 and 1.05 V for compounds 1 and 2 respectively and an irreversible reduction process with Epc at −1.10 V (see Fig. S3, ESI). These data lead to estimated HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.93 and −4.02 eV for 1vs. −5.96 and −4.02 eV for 2 (Table 1). These results show that the replacement of a phenyl ring by a methyl group has practically no effect on the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of the molecule.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of compounds 1 and 2 in solution and as thin films spun-cast on glass from chloroform solutions. The solution spectra of both compounds are quite similar with a first band in the 350–400 nm region followed by a main absorption band due to an internal charge transfer. Compared to 2, the absorption maximum (λmax) of 1 is slightly blue shifted (498 nm vs. 500 nm) (Table 1), while the molecular absorption coefficient (ε) decreases from 27000 to 18300 M−1 cm−1. Until now, we have no explanation for this decrease of ε. The quite similar λmax values of the two compounds confirm that the modification of the TPA block has negligible effect on the electronic properties at the molecular level.
In contrast, comparison of the absorption spectra of films of the two compounds reveals considerable differences. For compound 2 the passage from the solution to the solid-state leads to a 23 nm red shift of λmax and to a broadening of the absorption band with an increase of FWHM from 90 to 120 nm. The intercept of the tangent of the long wavelength absorption edge with the horizontal axis leads to an estimated band gap (Eg) of ∼2.00 eV. For compound 1 the spectrum of the film presents a first shoulder at ∼560 nm followed by a λmax at 607 nm. The spectrum is considerably broader than that of 2 with FWHM increasing from 120 to 180 nm while Eg decreases from 2.00 to 1.72 eV. The energy difference between the two maxima (0.20 eV) is larger than what is generally observed for a vibronic structure (0.16–0.18 eV) suggesting that the low energy band could be related to molecular aggregation in the solid. This hypothesis is supported by the time-dependent changes of the absorption spectrum of a film. As shown in Fig. 2, the spectrum recorded immediately after spin casting is very similar to the solution spectrum and it progressively undergoes a red shift accompanied by the development of a new band around 620 nm.
These results show, in agreement with crystallographic data, that the replacement of a phenyl ring by a methyl strongly affects the molecular organization in the solid. Although it is clear that the large reduction of the band gap and broadening of the absorption spectrum are caused by strong intermolecular interactions, the face-to face stacking observed in the crystal, typical of H-aggregates, could be expected to lead to a blue shift of the absorption spectrum. The fact that the opposite effect is observed suggests that the molecular packing is different in the crystal and in the films. The spontaneous evolution of the solid-state spectrum could be interpreted by changes of molecular packing with a progressive change from H to J aggregates. Anyway, this unusual behaviour clearly underlines the need for further detailed structural investigations.
From the point of view of photovoltaic conversion, the combined effects of reduced band gap and broader absorption spectrum result in a significant improvement of the light-harvesting properties of the material which may lead to improved efficiency compared to compound 2.
In order to confirm this hypothesis, compound 1 has been subjected to a preliminary evaluation as the donor material in basic bi-layer planar hetero-junction cells. Circular cells of 28 mm2 active area were fabricated by deposition of ca. 20 nm thick films of the donor on ITO substrates pre-coated with 40 nm thick films of PEDOT:PSS. The substrates were then introduced into a vacuum chamber, a 30 nm thick layer of C60 was deposited by thermal evaporation under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar and the devices were completed by deposition of a 100 nm aluminium electrode. Each substrate contains two circular cells and each batch typically involves eight substrates (sixteen cells). Since films of compound 1 can be prepared by solution-processing as well as by thermal evaporation under vacuum, bi-layer cells have been fabricated with donor layers prepared using the two techniques. After fabrication the cells were subjected to ten minutes of thermal treatment at 80 °C. This thermal treatment produces a major reorganization of the material as shown by the large changes in the optical spectrum of the cells (see Fig. S4, ESI).
The cells based on the donor films spun-cast from chloroform solutions (5 mg mL−1) give a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.34 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V which combined with a fill factor (FF) of 0.46 lead to a PCE of 2.92% (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This value is higher than that obtained for compound 1 under the same conditions (2.50%) due to better FF and Jsc values. The results for the cells based on the vacuum-deposited donor show a further improvement of Jsc and FF to 7.0 mA cm−2 and 0.52 respectively leading to an increase of PCE to 3.30% (Fig. 3). A decrease of Voc from 0.88 to 0.80 V is observed between the cells based on the spun-cast and vacuum deposited layers of donor 1. These results are consistent with the differences observed between the UV-Vis absorption spectra of films deposited using the two techniques which reveal a red shift of λmax and increase of the relative intensity of the aggregation band for the vacuum deposited film (Fig. S5, ESI). On the other hand, the decrease of Voc values suggests that the deposition technique affects the D/A interfacial dipole, possibly due to differences in the orientation of donor molecules at the D/A interface; further work is needed to clarify this point. The PCE of the vacuum deposited cells value ranks among the highest obtained so far for our standard simple bilayer cells with C60 as the acceptor and no cathode buffer layer. On the basis of the 4.0% efficiency obtained with a cell based on an active layer of 2 co-evaporated with C60, these first results suggest that that there is still much room for progress for optimized devices.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cell based on donor 1 shows a first peak at ca. 360 nm corresponding to the contribution of C60 followed by a broad band with a maximum of ca. 60% (Fig. 4). The two sub-components of the absorption spectrum are clearly apparent and the shape of the band nicely matches the absorption spectrum of the film.

In order to complete these results and better understand the origin of the higher efficiency of 1, the hole-mobility (μH) of the two donors has been determined using the space-charge current limited method using the Mott–Gurney law. Hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor/gold were fabricated using spun-cast films of 1 and 2 of 120–150 nm thickness. Under these conditions hole-mobility (μH) values of 1.0 × 10−5 and of 5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were measured for compounds 2 and 1, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI). This fifty-fold increase of μH appears to be consistent with the more effective molecular packing suggested by crystallographic and optical data.

A small donor–acceptor system in which the one external phenyl ring of the TPA block is replaced by a methyl group has been synthesized. This modest structural modification has little influence on the electronic properties of the molecule but strongly affects the structure and electronic properties of the solid-state material. Results of X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy suggest that a tighter molecular packing resulting from the smaller size and reduced steric demand of the molecule lead to stronger intermolecular interactions. These interactions produce at the same time a strong reduction of the band gap and a large increase of hole-mobility resulting in a significant improvement of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. It is clear that the large and unexpected effects of this simple structural modification on the structure and electronic properties of the material pose many intriguing questions which will require further detailed investigations on the structure and electronic properties of the material. However, in view of the high current interest for triarylamines for the design of active materials for OSCs, metal-free sensitizers for DSSCs and hole-transporting materials, these preliminary results can already open interesting perspectives for future development in these various fields.

Indium-tin oxide coated glass slides of 24 mm × 25 mm × 1.1 mm dimensions with a surface resistance of 10 Ω □−1 were purchased from Kintec company. Part of the ITO layer was etched away with 37% HCl. The ITO electrodes were then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath (successively Deconex from VWR international GmbH), distilled water (15.3 MΩ cm−1), acetone, ethanol and distilled water again for 10 min each and dried in an oven at 100 °C. The dried electrodes were then modified by a spun-cast layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP. AI 4083, HC-Starck) filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane just prior to use. Spin-casting was achieved at 5000 rpm (r = 10 s, t = 60 s), and the electrode was then dried at 130 °C for 15 min. Films of donor materials (ca. 20 nm) were spun-cast under atmospheric conditions from chloroform solutions containing 5 mg donor per mL. After film deposition the devices were introduced into an argon glovebox (200B, MBraun) equipped with a vacuum chamber and a 30 nm film of fullerene C60 (99+%) (MER Corporation) and a 100 nm thick aluminium electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the donor film under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar through a mask defining two cells of 6.0 mm diameter (0.28 cm2) on each ITO electrode. Each batch typically involves four substrates (eight cells).

The J vs. V curves of the devices were recorded in the dark and under illumination using a Keithley 236 source-measure unit and a home-made acquisition program. The light source was an AM 1.5 Solar Constant 575 PV simulator (Steuernagel Lichttecknik, equipped with a metal halogen lamp). The light intensity was measured by a broad-band power meter (13PEM001, Melles Griot). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a halogen lamp (Osram) with an Action Spectra Pro 150 monochromator, a lock-in amplifier (Perkin-Elmer 7225) and a S2281 photodiode (Hamamatsu).
Hole-mobilities have been determined by the space-charge current limited method using the Mott–Gurney law on hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor/gold using spun-cast films of donors 1 and 2 of 120–150 nm thickness (see Fig. S6, ESI).
