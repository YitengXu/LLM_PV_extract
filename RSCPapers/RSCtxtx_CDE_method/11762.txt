Two types of core–shell and core–mantle–shell supramolecules were designed based on grafted-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and poly[benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien)naphthothiadiazole] (PBDT-DTNT) chains and employed in the active layers of PBDT-DTNT:phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) solar cells to stabilize the morphology and performance. These nano-hybrids were composed of CNT-g-poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (PDDT)/PBDT-DTNT and CNT-g-polyaniline (PANI)/PBDT-DTNT precursors, respectively. The overall diameter of the core–shell and core–mantle–shell nanostructures ranged within 85–95 and 110–120 nm, respectively. In contrast to the pure CNTs (3.55%), the pre-designed core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures considerably affected the photovoltaic characteristics and efficiencies of 4.83 and 6.71% were acquired, respectively. From the pure CNT-based photovoltaics towards the core–shell and core–mantle–shell modified systems, the slopes of decreasing curves of short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) versus aging time became slower, proving higher stability in the well-functioning photovoltaic devices. The core–mantle–shell nanostructures not only largely phase separated and absorbed at more red-shifted wavelengths, but also further stabilized the device morphology and performance. Within 1 month aging, the characteristics of (9.69 mA cm−2, 52%, 0.57 V, 2.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 806 Ω cm2 and 2.87%) and (12.74 mA cm−2, 64%, 0.64 V, 8.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 9.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 543 Ω cm2 and 5.21%) were retained for the core–shell and core–mantle–shell based systems, respectively.

In parallel with power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancements as a key parameter in polymer solar cells (PSCs), the stability must be taken into account because of its direct relation with the device lifetime. The PSC stability depends on interface material issues, the photodegradation of organic materials, and the morphological stability of the blends. The first two issues could be tackled by optimizing the fabrication technologies, while the last one is induced by the internal driving force known as phase segregation. Despite the fact that prominent efficiencies have been acquired with morphology control techniques, the optimal morphology is a metastable state. Appropriate phase separation is necessary for exciton dissociation, while excessive phase segregation will decrease the interface area and increase the exciton recombination, and thereby will have a negative impact on the device performance. The morphology of active layers became more unstable when the environmental temperature was higher than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymers. Lin et al. explored the morphological possibilities of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers afforded by low drying temperatures in the film-forming process with the purpose of attaining both high efficiency and stability in solar cells.

Some strategies such as decreasing the crystallinity of polythiophenes, constructing densely distributed P3HT nanofibers, adopting amorphous fullerene electron acceptors, reducing the polymer regioregularity, introducing compatibilizers, functionalization of side chains, cross-linking,etc. have been employed to stabilize the morphology in BHJ solar cells. Through adopting extra phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) molecules as a morphology regulator, a stable efficiency over 16.7% was obtained. Very recently, highly efficient and stabilized quaternary organic photovoltaics were designed by optimizing the active layer morphology. Stable semitransparent photovoltaics with 12.37% efficiency were also reported by Hu et al. High structural stability under thermal treatment was also introduced via efficient ternary organic photovoltaics by minimizing the energy loss. Alternatively, the use of nanoparticles in the active layer to create a stable morphology has been demonstrated by several groups via grafting of polymer chains on silicon or silica nanoparticles and the use of various nanoparticles such as quantum dots, ZnO, TiO2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) mixed with the polymer. Furthermore, fused systems are more stable, while side chains, especially those attached in quaternary positions or at hetero atoms, promote degradation. The side chains are often the preferred points of attack for reactive oxygen species, resulting in the degradation of the conjugated structure. Several investigations have thus focused on the possibility of removing the side chains once the active layer has been deposited. This has been accomplished using two different approaches with either thermocleavable or acid-cleavable side chains. Alloy-like stable ternary polymer solar cells have been also developed with over 17.2% efficiency.
Two types of core–shell and core–mantle–shell supramolecules were designed on the basis of grafted-CNTs and poly[benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien)naphthothiadiazole] (PBDT-DTNT) chains and employed in the active layers of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells to stabilize the morphology and performance. The core (CNT)–mantle (polyaniline (PANI))–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures not only largely phase separated and absorbed at stronger red-shifted wavelengths, but also further stabilized the device characteristics. The corresponding pristine and pure CNT modified photovoltaic cells were also fabricated to further investigate the impact of the pre-developed nano-hybrids on the system function and stability.

The procedures of synthesis steps for the demanded materials including CNT-g-poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (PDDT), CNT-g-PANI, and PBDT-DTNT for preparation of the supramolecular nanostructures are reported in the ESI. The synthesized materials were deeply characterized through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) analyses.


The synthesized PBDT-DTNT polymer chains (Mn = 50 kDa and the dispersity = 1.95) were dissolved in dichlorobenzene (DCB) (100 °C, 3 h) and then added to the pre-dispersed CNT-g-PDDT precursors in dimethyformamide (DMF) (60:40 v/v% for DCB:DMF). The resulting system was subjected to stages of sonication (60 °C, 7 h) and crystallization (30 °C, 2 days) to afford the core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nano-hybrids. To design the core–mantle–shell supramolecules based on CNT-graft-PANI and PBDT-DTNT, the constituents were dispersed/dissolved in a mixed solvent of DCB:DMF (60:40 v/v%) and the dissolution and stirring steps were then performed. A dissolution step was conducted at 100 °C for 2 h. The resultants were subsequently transferred to the sonication (60 °C for 7 h) and crystallization (30 °C for 2 days) stages. Notably, the weight ratio of PBDT-DTNT to CNT-g-PDDT and CNT-graft-PANI and the concentration were 9:1 and 0.12 wt%, respectively.


Active layer solutions consisting of the host PBDT-DTNT and PC71BM precursors as well as the third components including CNT, core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT), and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures were spin-coated onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Sigma-Aldrich) modified indium tin oxide (ITO, sheet resistance of 10–15 Ω per square) glass to yield 350 nm films (surface profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-500)). The weight ratios were 1:1 in the binary and 1:1:0.5 in the ternary active layers with an overall concentration of 20 mg mL−1. Afterward, a LiF interfacial layer (1 nm) and Al electrode (100 nm) were thermally evaporated onto the device under a vacuum below 2 × 10−4 Pa. Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization was conducted on a computer-controlled measurement unit from Newport under illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Pd) and electron-only (Al/active layer/Al) devices were also fabricated and the carrier mobilities in the active layers were determined.


In the current work, two types of CNT-based supramolecules were designed and utilized in order to manipulate the active layer morphologies and stabilize the performances of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the typical CNT, core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures are displayed in Fig. 1(a), (b), and (c), respectively. The pristine CNTs as the cores of the nanostructures possessed a diameter and length in the range of 10–20 nm and of about 20 μm, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), the surface of the CNTs was covered by the PBDT-DTNT conjugated chains to fabricate the core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) supramolecules. These nano-hybrids were composed of CNT-g-PDDT and PBDT-DTNT precursors. The overall diameter of the core–shell nanostructures ranged on average between 85 and 95 nm. Owing to the larger electron density of the PBDT-DTNT polymer chains with respect to the CNT seeds, the former regions were darker. On the other hand, the crystallization of PBDT-DTNT chains onto the CNT-g-PANI seeding agents reflected the core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures. As shown in the TEM image of Fig. 1(c), the PANI middle layer was brighter than the PBDT-DTNT outer layer and the total diameter of the prepared supramolecule was about 110–120 nm. The schemes of the core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nano-hybrids are illustrated in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. Furthermore, the chemical structure of PBDT-DTNT is presented in Fig. 2(c).

The three types of morphology mediators including the pure CNT, core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) composed of CNT-g-PDDT/PBDT-DTNT, and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) composed of CNT-g-PANI/PBDT-DTNT constituents were used in the active layers of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells. The current study was categorized into two sections. In the first section, the nanostructures in question were added to the active layers of pristine PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM photovoltaics to investigate their impacts on the morphology and efficiency. In the second section, the roles of the added nanostructures in stabilizing the corresponding cells were brought into consideration during air aging processes. The typical solar cell structure with constituents of an ITO anode, a PEDOT:PSS anodic buffer layer, different active layers, a LiF cathodic buffer layer and an Al cathode is reported in Fig. 2(d).
UV-vis (Lambda 750) measurements were employed to study the optical characteristics. UV-vis spectra recorded for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM, PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:CNT, PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) films are presented in Fig. 3(a). The peaks of PC71BM agglomerates were detected approximately at 338 nm for all systems. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) for PBDT-DTNT in the pristine PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM thick films were 398, 473, 719 and 754 nm. For the systems modified by the CNT and CNT-based nanostructures, a low-intensity peak was also observed at 230–242 nm because of the presence of CNTs. The λmax values for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:CNT and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) thick films were (406, 489, 730 and 771 nm) and (421, 499, 741 and 782 nm), respectively. Moreover, the λmax values for the core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nano-hybrids were located at 424, 512, 751 and 790 nm. Prominent peaks for the interactions between the CNT and PANI precursors also appeared at 221 and 280 nm. Notably, the peak intensities were the highest in the core–mantle–shell modified active layers. The core–shell and pure CNT nanostructures were the second and third best-functioning modifiers, which led to the stronger and more red-shifted absorbance. The weakest absorbance was detected for the pristine PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM photovoltaic layers, as displayed in Fig. 3(a).
The current–density–voltage (J–V) curves of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells and those modified by the CNT, core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT), and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures are presented in Fig. 3(b). The data details are also tabulated in Table 1. The short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Voc) and PCE were equal to 9.56 mA cm−2, 58%, 0.62 V and 3.44%, respectively, for the unmodified PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells. The addition of pure CNTs into the active layers of the above-mentioned photovoltaics insignificantly improved the cell features, i.e., Jsc = 9.72 mA cm−2, FF = 59%, Voc = 0.62 V, and PCE = 3.55%. In contrast to the pure CNTs, the pre-designed core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) supramolecules considerably affected the photovoltaic characteristics and efficiencies of 4.83 and 6.71% were acquired, respectively. The Jsc, FF, and Voc values for these systems were (11.80 mA cm−2, 62%, and 0.66 V) and (13.90 mA cm−2, 69%, and 0.70 V), respectively. In fact, the pre-developed supramolecules composed of grafted CNTs and PBDT-DTNT chains were capable of modifying the morphology of the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM active layers and, consequently, improving the performance.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM; Nanoscope V) topographic images of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM (Fig. 4(a)), PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:CNT (Fig. 4(b)), PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) (Fig. 4(c)) and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) (Fig. 4(d)) active layers are exhibited in different parts of Fig. 4. The corresponding root mean square (RMS) values are also tabulated in Table 1. As anticipated, the photovoltaics with the higher cell features showed the larger phase separation. The most intense phase separation belonged to the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) active layers, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The core–shell and pure CNT nanostructures also led to higher phase separation than that detected for the pristine PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM active layers. That is to say, the larger diameters of the core–mantle–shell nano-hybrids compared with the core–shell ones assured more intense phase separation. Owing to the complicated chemical structure of PBDT-DTNT chains, their assembly onto the grafted CNTs did not develop thick supramolecules. Hence, the double coating of CNTs with the PANI and PBDT-DTNT conjugated polymers was a suitable idea for the preparation of nano-hybrids with larger diameters. Moreover, the pre-designed core–shell and core–mantle–shell nanostructures as the crystallization seeds further promoted the arrangement of the PBDT-DTNT chains, and thereby larger phase separation was detected. As another point, although the PANI grafts completely covered the surfaces of the CNT precursors, the PDDT grafts were only attached at a few points onto the CNTs. Therefore, the former supramolecules were denoted as core–mantle–shell and the latter ones were designated as core–shell. The RMS values of the pristine active layers and those modified by the pure CNT, core–shell, and core–mantle–shell nanostructures were equal to 0.72, 0.74, 0.81 and 0.95 nm, respectively.
In parallel with the improved photovoltaic characteristics, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were also elevated. The μh and μe pairs increased from (3.5 × 10−4 and 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM to (4.0 × 10−4 and 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:CNT, to (8.9 × 10−4 and 4.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and finally to (9.2 × 10−3 and 3.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) based hole-only and electron-only devices.
In the second section of this research, the air stability of the fabricated solar cells was investigated within 1 month in 5-day intervals. The variations in the Jsc, FF, Voc and PCE parameters versus the aging time are plotted in Fig. 5(a), (b), (c) and (d), respectively. Furthermore, the hole and electron mobility drops are presented in the bar graphs of Fig. 6(a) and (b) for the pristine and CNT-modified systems as well as those manipulated by the core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) supramolecules, respectively. Data details are also tabulated in Table 1. The trends of the photovoltaic characteristics were all decreasing in parallel with the elapsing aging time, but with distinct slopes. The steepest reductions were detected for the unmodified PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells, as shown in different parts of Fig. 5. From the pure CNT-based photovoltaics towards the core–shell and core–mantle–shell modified systems, the slopes of the decreasing curves became slower, proving higher stability in the well-functioning photovoltaic devices. For the unmodified cell, after 10, 20, and 30 days of aging, the cell features reached (8.64 mA cm−2, 55%, 0.58 V and 2.76%), (7.50 mA cm−2, 49%, 0.51 V and 1.87%), and (6.05 mA cm−2, 41%, 0.42 V and 1.04%), respectively. The corresponding data for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:CNT systems were equal to (8.86 mA cm−2, 55%, 0.59 V and 2.87%), (7.93 mA cm−2, 51%, 0.53 V and 2.14%), and (6.54 mA cm−2, 44%, 0.46 V and 1.32%) within 10-, 20-, and 30-day air exposure, respectively. The μh and μe values also dropped with the air aging and reached (7.3 × 10−8 and 9.4 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1) and (8.4 × 10−8 and 9.9 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the pristine and CNT-modified devices within 1 month air aging, respectively.
In a forward step, the pre-designed supramolecules, in particular the core–mantle–shell ones, further stabilized the morphology and performance of the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM photovoltaics. The device efficiency was reduced to 4.62% (11.49 mA cm−2, 61%, and 0.66 V), 4.15% (10.98 mA cm−2, 60%, and 0.63 V), 3.42% (10.37 mA cm−2, 55%, and 0.60 V) and 2.87% (9.69 mA cm−2, 52%, and 0.57 V) after the 5, 15, 25 and 30 day air aging processes, respectively, for the DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) solar cells. The best stabilized devices were fabricated on the basis of the core–mantle–shell nano-hybrids. The core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures not only largely phase separated (Fig. 4(d)) and absorbed at more red-shifted wavelengths (Fig. 3(a)), but also further stabilized the device morphology and performance. In more detail, within 10, 20, and 30 days of aging, the Jsc, FF, Voc, μh, μe and PCE reached (13.60 mA cm−2, 68%, 0.69 V, 4.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.38%), (13.24 mA cm−2, 67%, 0.67 V, 8.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.94%), and (12.74 mA cm−2, 64%, 0.64 V, 8.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 9.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.21%), respectively.
Beside the photovoltaic characteristics, morphological stability was observed in the pre-developed supramolecule based solar cells. As above-mentioned, the photovoltaic and morphological stabilities were more prominent in the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) devices. Fig. 7 and Table 1 report the RMS alterations versus aging time for different types of systems. In the active layers prepared based on the pre-designed core–shell and core–mantle–shell nano-hybrids, the arrangements of donor polymer chains and acceptor PCBM molecules were more ordered and stable, that is why the absorbance, morphological, and photovoltaic features were improved. In fact, the pre-developed supramolecules acted as suitable seeding agents in the photoactive layers and thus more coherent morphologies were developed, leading to more stable photovoltaic devices. The RMS values decreased from 0.95 nm for the as-fabricated PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core–mantle–shell cells to 0.88 nm after 1 month aging. This RMS drop increased from 0.07 nm for the core–mantle–shell modified photovoltaics to 0.11 nm (from 0.81 to 0.70 nm) for the core–shell based systems. Towards the less-stabilized solar cells, i.e., PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:CNT (RMS drop = 0.19 nm) and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM (RMS drop = 0.22 nm), the RMS drop increased, which was a fingerprint of low-stabilized active layer morphologies.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data for all devices are fitted using a simple circuit with charge transfer resistance (Rtr) and the parallel subcircuit simulates the contact between the active layer and top electrode (Rs). The Nyquist plots were drawn in dark conditions as Z′ (real cell impedance) versus −Z′′ (imaginary cell impedance). The Rtr values of all photovoltaic devices upon fabrication and during the aging process are reported in Table 1. The impedance responses recorded from the unmodified and modified solar cells upon fabrication and after 15 and 30 days of aging are also presented in Fig. 8(a–d). Although the Rtr values increased versus aging time in all types of photovoltaics, the well-stabilized ones demonstrated a smaller enhancement rate. The Rtr values within 0, 10, 20 and 30 days of aging were equal to (673, 798, 893 and 956 Ω cm2) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM, (644, 763, 839 and 921 Ω cm2) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:pure CNT, (521, 610, 711 and 806 Ω cm2) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and (303, 345, 421 and 543 Ω cm2) for the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) photovoltaics. Consistent with the morphological, optical, and photovoltaic measurements, the EIS analysis also proved that the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) supramolecules were the best candidates for stabilizing the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells.
The respective external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were also detected for the organic devices upon fabrication and after 10, 20, and 30 days of air aging. EQE spectra of the photovoltaic cells having the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM, PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:pure CNT, PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) active layers within 0, 10, 20 and 30 days of aging are reported in Fig. 9(a–d), respectively. The intensity and red-shift of the EQE spectra were increased in the well-modified systems such as those manipulated by the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM:core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures. In addition, in parallel with the time elapsing, the quality of the EQE spectra decreased. That is to say, the pre-designed core–shell and core–mantle–shell nano-hybrids prevented the EQE properties from further plummeting in either the as-prepared or air-aged devices.

The three types of morphology mediators including pure CNTs, core (CNT)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nano-hybrids composed of CNT-g-PDDT/PBDT-DTNT, and core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) supramolecules composed of CNT-g-PANI/PBDT-DTNT were used in the active layers of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells. The overall diameter of the core–shell and core–mantle–shell nanostructures ranged within 85–95 and 110–120 nm, respectively. The core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) nanostructures not only largely phase separated (RMS = 0.95 nm) and absorbed at more red-shifted wavelengths, but also further stabilized the device characteristics. Within 1 month aging, the characteristics of (9.69 mA cm−2, 52%, 0.57 V, 2.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.87%) and (12.74 mA cm−2, 64%, 0.64 V, 8.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 9.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.21%) were retained for the core–shell and core–mantle–shell based systems, respectively. Moreover, towards the less-stabilized solar cells, the RMS drop increased. According to the morphological, optical, photovoltaic and electrochemical analyses, the core (CNT)–mantle (PANI)–shell (PBDT-DTNT) supramolecules were the best candidates for stabilizing the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM solar cells.
