Triphenylaminochalcone-cored dendrimers decorated with anthracene and pyrene at the periphery have been synthesized by a convergent methodology using a click chemistry approach and characterized from spectral data and elemental analyses. All the dendrimers show excellent optical and electrochemical properties. Higher generation dendrimers exhibit better power conversion efficiency than lower-generation dendrimers when used as additives in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

Conjugated organic supramolecules have attracted considerable research interest in recent years, owing to their potential applications in fluorescence imaging, chemo sensors and as optical power limiting materials and active gain media for light-emitting devices. Anthracene is one of the most common fluorophores, possessing good aggregation behaviour due to its unique chemical and electron-rich structure, and a low electronic band gap and strong blue fluorescence which lead to blue emission in OLEDs. Anthracene-containing polymers have attracted much attention owing to their interesting photophysical and optoelectronic properties and possible applications for photovoltaics and organic field-effect transistors.

Among the polycyclic aromatic units such as fluorene, anthracene and pyrene, pyrene has the best charge carrying mobility, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and excellent thermal stability. Pyrene and its derivatives tend to aggregate, resulting in red-shifted emission and low PLQYs in the solid state, and this can be suppressed by introducing bulky groups and star-shaped structures. The pyrene moiety with appropriate structural modification has been widely studied in various areas of chemical biology as a fluorophore.
Organic molecular assemblies can function as alternate potential low-cost additives for solar energy conversion and have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in flat panel displays due to outstanding advantages such as self-emission and operating at low voltage with high brightness. Triphenylamine and its derivatives have an important place in DSSC research as molecules with multiple functions, most notably electron donation when linked with a sensitized dye and hole transport.
In recent years a new class of macromolecules known as dendrimers has received tremendous interest in various areas such as solar cells, light harvesting systems, catalysis, molecular encapsulation and also in medical fields. We report herein the synthesis of triphenylaminochalcone cored demdrimers 1–10 decorated with pyrene and anthracene surface units by a convergent strategy via click chemistry. The photophysical, electrochemical and Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) properties of the synthesized dendrimers 1–10 have been also focused on in the present investigation (Fig. 1).

Terminal alkynes were prepared by esterification of bile acids 11 and 12 using excess propargyl alcohol and a catalytic amount of para-toluenesulfonic acid to give the propargyl esters 13 and 14 in good yields, which on further treatment with 1.0 equiv. of bromoacetyl bromide at 0 °C in the presence of K2CO3 in chloroform for 4 h afforded the propargylated monobromoacetyl bile acid derivatives 15 and 16 in 92% and 89% yields, respectively (Scheme 1).

The dendritic bromides 19, 20, 21 and 22 were converted into the dendritic azides 23, 24, 25 and 26 in 88%, 90%, 89% and 87% yields using NaN3 in DMF at 60 °C for 12 h (Scheme 1).
The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 23 showed singlets at δ 0.60, 3.82, 5.03, 6.53 and 7.12 for C18-Me, –CH2N3, O-methylene, N-methylene and triazole protons respectively in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons.

Similarly, the structure of the dendritic azides 24, 25 and 26 was confirmed from spectral and analytical data.
Reaction of 1.0 equiv. of 3,5-bis(propargyloxy)benzyl chloride 27 with 2.1 equiv. of each of the dendritic azides 23, 24, 25 and 26 under Cu(I)-catalysed click reaction conditions gave the second generation dendritic chlorides (G2-Cl) 28, 29, 30 and 31 in 87%, 84%, 86% and 81% yields, respectively, which on further reaction with NaN3 in DMF at 60 °C afforded the second generation dendritic azides (G2-N3) 32, 33, 34 and 35 in 75%, 78%, 80% and 80% yields, respectively (Scheme 2).
The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 34 showed singlets at δ 0.55 and 4.80 for C18-Me and –CH2N3 and the two different O-methylene and N-methylene protons appeared at δ 5.09, 5.11, 5.21 and 6.22 and the two different triazole protons appeared at δ 7.37 and 7.76 in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons.

Similarly, the structure of dendritic azides 32, 33 and 35 was confirmed from spectral and analytical data.
Synthesis of the bis(propargyloxy)triphenylaminochalcone core 38 starts from commercially available triphenylamine (TPA). Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of triphenylamine gave 4,4′-diformyl triphenylamine 36 in good yield. Claisen–Schmidt condensation of 1.0 equiv. 4,4′-Diformyl triphenylamine 36 with 2.1 equiv. of 4-(propargyloxy)acetophenone 37 using ethanol as solvent and 10% sodium hydroxide as the base gave the corresponding bispropargyloxy triphenylamine chalcone 38 in 83% yield (Scheme 3). Reaction of 1.0 equiv. of the triphenylamine chalcone core unit 38 with 2.1 equiv. of each of the azides 17 and 18 in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%) and sodium L-ascorbate (10 mol%) in a mixture of THF/water (3:1) at room temperature for 12 h gave the dendrimers (G0) 1 and 2 in 80% and 78% yields, respectively (Scheme 3).
The 1H NMR spectrum of dendrimer (G0) 1 showed singlets at δ 5.08 and 6.54 for O-methylene and N-methylene protons and trans olefinic protons appeared at δ 7.38 (J = 15.3 Hz) and δ 7.73 (J = 15.6 Hz) respectively in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons.

Similarly, the structure of compound 2 was confirmed from spectral and analytical data.
A similar technique was adapted for the synthesis of the first generation dendrimers 3, 4, 5 and 6. Reaction of 1.0 equiv. of the triphenylamine chalcone core unit 38 with 2.1 equiv. of each of the dendritic azides 23, 24, 25 and 26 under Cu(I) catalyzed click reaction conditions generated the first generation (AB2-type) dendrimers (G1) 3, 4, 5 and 6 in 74%, 80%, 80% and 85% yields, respectively (Scheme 3). The 1H NMR spectrum of dendrimer (G1) 5 showed singlets at δ 0.55, 5.09, 5.12, 5.30 and 6.21 for C18-Me, O-methylene and N-methylene protons respectively in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 5 showed signals at δ 51.5, 56.5, 61.1 and 72.0 for O-methylene and N-methylene carbons and the carbonyl carbons appeared at δ 164.8, 173.0 and 187.7 in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF-MS) of compound 5 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 2213.98 [M + Na]+. Further the structure of compound 5 was also confirmed from elemental analysis. Similarly, the structure of compounds 3, 4 and 6 was confirmed from spectral and analytical data.
Further, synthesis of the second generation anthracene and pyrene based triazole dendrimers 7, 8, 9 and 10 was achieved via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition through a click chemistry approach which is summarized in Scheme 3. The reaction of 1.0 equiv. of the triphenylamine chalcone core unit 38 with 2.1 equiv. of each of the dendritic azides 32, 33, 34 and 35 under Cu(I) catalyzed click reaction conditions gave the second generation dendrimers (G2) 7, 8, 9 and 10 in 76%, 79%, 74% and 77% yields, respectively (Scheme 3). The 1H NMR spectrum of dendrimer (G2) 9 showed singlets at δ 0.43, 4.98, 5.10, 5.28 and 6.06 for C18-Me, O-methylene and N-methylene protons and the triazole protons appeared at δ 7.54 in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 9 showed signals at δ 51.3, 56.4, 60.8 and 71.8 for O-methylene and N-methylene carbons and the carbonyl carbons appeared at δ 164.8, 172.9 and 187.5 in addition to the signals for the other aliphatic and aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF-MS) of compound 9 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 4203.53 [M + Na]+. Further the structure of compound 9 was also confirmed from elemental analysis. Similarly, the structure of compounds 7, 8 and 10 was confirmed from spectral and analytical data.


Fig. 2a shows UV-vis absorption spectra of dendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 recorded in DCM (1 × 10−6 M) and the absorption maxima are listed in Table 1. The anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 show a strong absorption band near 437 nm which corresponds to n–π* transitions due to the presence of the triphenylamine moiety and the remaining three peaks are shoulder peaks in the range of 351–389 nm due to anthracene units in the periphery. Though the λmax values of anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 remain almost constant, the absorption intensity increases with increasing dendrimer generation. Especially, the second generation anthracenodendrimers 7 and 8 show the highest absorption due to the presence of more anthracene chromophores in the dendrimer probably increasing the intensity of the signal, which is otherwise known as the valence effect in dendrimer chemistry.

Fig. 2b shows the fluorescence spectra of anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 in DCM (1 × 10−6 M) and the fluorescence parameters of the dendrimers are summarized in Table 1. The anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8, when excited at 378 nm, exhibited emission bands at 643, 634, 637, 637 and 636 nm respectively, due to the presence of anthracene units in the periphery. The fluorescence intensity of the zeroth generation dendrimer 1 is high with a small red shift compared with first and second generation dendrimers 3 and 4, and 7 and 8. This may be due to the fluorescence quenching of bile acids present in the first and second generation dendrimers 3 and 4, and 7 and 8.
The optical properties of the pyrenodendrimers 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 are listed in Table 2. The absorbance spectra were recorded in DCM (1 × 10−6 M) and are shown in Fig. 3a. The pyrenodendrimers show one strong absorption band near 437 nm which corresponds to n–π* transitions due to the presence of the triphenylamine moiety and the remaining four peaks are shoulder peaks in the range of 267–345 nm due to pyrene units in the periphery. Though the λmax values of pyrenodendrimers 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 remain almost constant, the absorption intensity increases with increasing dendrimer generation. Especially, the second generation pyrenodendrimers 9 and 10 show the highest absorption intensity due to the presence of more pyrene units and the addition of the triphenylamine central core unit.

Fig. 3b shows the fluorescence intensity of the pyrenodendrimers 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 when recorded in DCM (1 × 10−6 M) and the fluorescence parameters are summarized in Table 2. The pyrenodendrimers 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10, on excitation at 344 nm, exhibited emission bands at 635, 635, 634, 634 and 632 nm, respectively, due to the presence of pyrene units at the periphery. The fluorescence intensity of the zeroth generation dendrimer 2 is high with a small red shift compared with first and second generation dendrimers 5 and 6, and 9 and 10. This may be due to the fluorescence quenching of bile acids present in the first and second generation dendrimers 5 and 6, and 9 and 10.

The redox behaviour of dendrimers 1–10 was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 (1 × 10−3 M) at room temperature at a scan rate of 60 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammograms of the dendrimers 1–10 are obtained with glassy carbon as the working electrode with Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. CV studies were carried out on solutions of the substrates (1 mM) in CH2Cl2 using tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. All the synthesized dendrimers exhibited an electrochemical response in cyclic voltammetry; the redox potentials are listed in Table 3.

The cyclic voltammograms of anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 are shown in Fig. 4a. The irreversible oxidation potential for the anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 was observed at 1.54, 1.34, 1.28, 1.27 and 1.15 V, respectively, and the reversible reduction peaks were observed at −1.28, −1.38, −1.28 and −1.33 V for the anthracenodendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8, respectively, except for dendrimer 1. Dendrimers 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 showed a gradual decrease of Epc from 1.54 to 1.34, 1.28, 1.27 and 1.15 V and the Epa values of anodic potentials were the same upon increasing dendrimer generation. From zeroth to second generation dendrimers, the cathodic peak potential is shifted to a slightly more positive potential and in the anodic peak potential there is no change due to more anthracene units and the addition of the triphenylamine core unit. The cyclic voltammograms of pyrenodendrimers 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 are shown in Fig. 4b. The irreversible oxidation potential for the dendrimers 5, 6, 9 and 10 was observed at 1.32, 1.42, 1.46 and 1.46, respectively and the reversible reduction peaks were observed at −1.30, −1.56, −1.26 and −1.30, respectively. Dendrimer 2 exhibited only two reduction peaks at −0.51 and 0.78. For the first and second generation dendrimers, the cathodic peaks were shifted to a slightly higher positive potential and the anodic peaks were shifted to a slightly more negative potential due to the presence of the triphenylamine core unit and the greater number of pyrene units.

In an attempt to improve the solar cell performance, studies were carried out to examine the role of the electrolytic solution in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In general, various nitrogen containing heterocycles such as aminopyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrolidinopyridine, and pyrrolidinoethylpyridine have been used as additives to drastically increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the electron donating properties of the nitrogen lone pair. Hence, we have designed and synthesized a new series of electron rich anthracene and pyrene based dendrimers 1–10 and employed them as additives for DSSCs. The photovoltaic performance data of the short-circuit current (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor and the energy conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. As seen in Fig. 5 (I–V curves of DSSCs), the device performance, such as the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc), is enhanced with anthracene and pyrene units and also with the triphenylamine core unit. While comparing the efficiency of fabricated DSSCs using anthraceno and pyrenodendrimers the efficiency and Voc increase relatively due to the introduction of pyrene groups, in particular in the second generation dendrimer 10. Among the tested dendrimers, second-generation dendrimer 10 displayed the largest Voc (900 mV) and Jsc (12.6 mA cm−2) values and the highest efficiency is 8.5% (Table 5 and Fig. 5b). From the results it is clear that as the dendritic generation increases the power conversion efficiency (η) also increases.

In conclusion, dendrimers with anthracene and pyrene as the surface and triazole as the bridging unit were synthesized in good yields by a convergent synthetic strategy using a click chemistry approach. UV studies of the synthesized dendrimers indicate that as the number of anthracene and pyrene units increases, the absorption coefficient also increases, and hence the light absorbed by the dendritic antennae increases with an increase in the dendrimer generation. In the cyclic voltammogram studies, as the dendritic generation increases from zero to second generation, the cathodic peak potential is shifted to the less positive potential side which might be due to the presence of more anthracene and pyrene units. Further, the DSSC performance also increases as the number of anthracene and pyrene units increases with the increase in the generation of dendrimers. Dendrimers 9 and 10 exhibited better power conversion efficiency (η) values of 8.0 and 8.5%, respectively, when used as additives in DSSCs.

All chemicals and solvents were purchased commercially and used as such without further purification. All melting points were determined using a Toshniwal melting point apparatus by the open capillary tube method and are uncorrected. ESI-MS spectra were measured on a JEOL DX-303 mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer CHNS 2400 instrument. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (ACME, 100–200 mesh). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 300 MHz instruments. Chemical shifts are given in parts per million, and J values are in hertz. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Fluoromax 4 (Horiba JobinYvon) spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Xe-150 W lamp.


To a solution of propargyl ester (1 mmol) in dry CHCl3 (20 mL), anhydrous K2CO3 was added. To this mixture, bromoacetyl bromide (1 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. After the completion of the reaction, water (5 mL) was added and it was extracted with CHCl3 (2 × 75 mL). The chloroform layer was separated and washed with saturated NaHCO3 (5 mL) and brine (100 mL). The chloroform layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The chloroform layer was filtered and evaporated completely. The crude product was purified by column chromatography with 20% ethyl acetate in hexane as the eluent to give the corresponding monobromoacetyl derivative.


To the solution of the corresponding bromide/chloride (1 equiv.) in dry DMF (10 mL), sodium azide (1.5 equiv.) was added and stirring was continued at 60 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated and extracted with CHCl3 (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (100 mL) and saturated NaCl (aq.) (3 × 100 mL), dried over Na2SO4. Solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography (SiO2), using the eluent as mentioned under each compound.


A mixture of a polypropargylated derivative (1.0 equiv.), an azide functionalized compound (1.2 equiv. per azide functional unit), CuSO4·5H2O (0.3 equiv.), and sodium L-ascorbate (0.3 equiv.) was stirred at room temperature for 18 h in a 3:1 mixture of THF/water. After confirming the completion of the reaction with TLC, chloroform (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and it was washed with water (10 mL), and brine (10 mL).
