Magnesium tetraethynylporphyrins bearing four electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP; Mg-TEP-DPP4) units were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling, and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. The energy levels were effectively tuned by DPP with or without electron-withdrawing end-caps. Importantly, all the Mg-TEP-DPP4 molecules have broad absorption bands across the visible and near-infrared regions. The time-dependent excited state features of Mg-TEP-DPP4 and their kinetics were investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with multiwavelength and global/target analyses of time-resolved spectra. Importantly, the charge-separated state was demonstrated to undergo recombination within 253 ps in benzonitrile. Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells fabricated with Mg-TEP-DPP4:PC61BM exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 7.40% after solvent vapor annealing, which enabled balanced charge carrier transport, reduced charge recombination, and favorable charge separation and collection.

Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years because of the favorable characteristics of solution-based processes. In particular, single-layer small-molecule materials have achieved impressive improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 10%, and have the advantages of well-defined chemical structures, simple synthesis, easy purification, and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. In nature, the chlorophyll of plants contains a porphyrin ring that plays a key role in oxygen release and energy storage. Porphyrins also have high extinction coefficients (ε), and their photophysical and electrochemical properties can be easily modified by the substitution of functional groups at both the beta and meso positions. Recently, porphyrins with conjugated ethynyl linkers at the meso-positions have garnered considerable interest because they can easily extend the absorption spectrum into the near-infrared (NIR) region when a suitable donor–acceptor (D–A) system is constructed. The solar spectrum extends well into the NIR region, but most of the various OSC devices reported to date do not absorb light beyond 800 nm, which is a huge waste of solar energy and results in low PCE.

Various materials have been developed to achieve broad absorption in the visible and NIR regions by the strategy of using porphyrin as the core and two ethynyl-conjugated electron-deficient units as end groups. Among these works, Peng and co-workers achieved a PCE in excess of 8% from a small-molecule donor based on a Zn-porphyrin core with two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units as end groups. In addition to structures with ethynyl linkers, Langa, Sharma, and co-workers built analogous structures with thienylenevinylene linkers between Zn-porphyrin and 3-ethylrhodanine (RHA) or dicyanovinylene to achieve excellent PCE of 7–9%. Dimeric porphyrins conjugated with DPP or RHA units displayed broader absorption in the NIR region and gave PCE of about 8%. Since 2012, our group has also employed the ethynyl linker strategy with a tetraethynyl structure to maximize the conjugation effect, and investigated substituent effects of the aryl group. To date, these porphyrin systems with extended conjugation have been extensively developed and are promising for future commercial applications.
Star-shaped molecules with three or four extensions of the conjugated system based on triphenylamine, trithiophene, benzodithiophene, indacenodithiophene, tetraphenylethylene, and spirobifluorene cores also perform very well in organic photovoltaics. However, star-shaped molecules based on porphyrins have been rarely reported as electron donor or acceptor materials. To our knowledge, the only example was reported in 2017 by Li and co-workers, who developed a Zn-porphyrin tethered to four perylene bisimide (PDI) units as a powerful non-fullerene acceptor. We are interested in exploring whether this type of material can be used as general donor materials. Star-shaped porphyrins have the following merits. First, strong and broad light absorption in the visible and NIR regions is possible with the D–(π–A)4 or D–(π–A1–A2)4 structure, resulting in enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and red-shifted UV-visible absorption, which is beneficial for better light-harvesting and higher short-circuit current density (JSC). Second, a narrower band gap decreases energy loss (Eloss = Eg − qVOC), which is important in realizing high PCE. Third, star-shaped porphyrins have favorable intermolecular interactions and aggregation behavior, where solvent molecules such as pyridine coordinated to the metal (II) center to powerfully suppress excessive aggregation and promote the ordered arrangement of molecules in blended films. Fourth, their planar configuration contributes to intermolecular π–π stacking, leading to high carrier mobility. At the same time, some inherent problems of star-shaped porphyrins must be considered, including adequate solubility and morphological control. It is also worth noting that, as a nature-inspired small-molecule electron donor, magnesium porphyrin has some particular advantages. Owing to the light Mg atom at its metal center, it has a longer singlet excited state lifetime than that of the analogous zinc tetraethynylporphyrin. Furthermore, the central Mg atom promotes high solubility owing to its susceptibility to coordinating solvents such as THF and pyridine, which is beneficial for synthesis and device fabrication.
Taking the above into consideration, here we constructed large π-conjugated molecules bearing four DPP units tethered via ethynyl linkers to the magnesium porphyrin core. This type of star-shaped magnesium tetraethynylporphyrin (Mg-TEP) typically has a narrower band gap and broader Soret and Q bands in its absorption spectrum in comparison with porphyrins with two DPP units. We also systematically investigated the time-dependent excited state features and kinetics of this compound by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with multiwavelength and global/target analyses of time-resolved spectra. In this work, Mg-TEPs tethered to four DPP units with RHA end-caps exhibited broad absorption over a wide range, with a band extending up to 1000 nm, and had low-lying energy levels close to those of fullerene derivatives. As such, we obtained a series of general donor materials like Mg-TEP-DPP4, which were successfully applied in BHJ OSCs giving a maximum PCE of 7.40% (Fig. 1).

Mg-TEPs conjugated with four electron-deficient DPP units were synthesized in good yield by Sonogashira coupling with monobrominated dithienyl DPP with or without electron-withdrawing end-caps (BrTh-DPP-ThX, X = H, CHO, and RHA, Scheme 1). Here, we synthesized BrTh-DPP-Th-RHA by the strategy of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) with 3-ethylrhodanine (RHA) as end-caps, which is reported by Zhan and co-workers in 2016. We also used two different alkyl groups on the DPP nitrogen atoms, namely, 2-ethylhexyl (2-EH) and methoxybutyl (MOB), in order to improve the solubility and control the morphology of the products. We expected that the solubility would be sufficiently improved by the alkyl groups in addition to coordination of solvent molecules to the central Mg atom. In previous studies, triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) groups were used as solubilizing and protecting groups in trans positions around the Mg-TEPs core. In the present study, we used not only TIPS groups as solubilizing groups, but also TMS groups as protecting groups for the synthesis of the target molecules. We first prepared Mg-TEP-TIPS2-TMS2 (1, Mg-TEP-TIPS2-TMS2 magnesium(II) 5,15-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-10,20-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)porphyrinate) by our previously reported method and removed the TIPS and TMS groups simultaneously by treatment with nBu4NF to obtain a tetra-terminal alkyne, Mg-TEP-H4 (2, magnesium(II) 5,10,15,20-tetraethynylporphyrin). Then, we prepared the target molecule Mg-TEP-DPP4 (3a) by Sonogashira coupling with monobrominated DPP, using Pd2(dba)3/PPh3/CuI as catalyst, and THF/triethylamine as solvent. After stirring for 24 h at 90 °C, 3a was obtained in a fair yield of 60%. The CHO–, and RHA– end-caps were used to tune the morphological and electronic effects. 3b–d were synthesized by the same deprotection and Sonogashira coupling strategy. Compounds 3a–d were air-stable black solids.

Compounds 3a–d were sparingly soluble in THF, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, pyridine, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and CHCl3, and moderately soluble in toluene and CH2Cl2. They were fully characterized by 1H NMR and high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. When chloroform-d1 was used for NMR analysis 3a–d, we observed peak broadening due to intermolecular interactions. To avoid this complication, the chemical structure of 3a was confirmed by high-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded in tetrachloroethane-d2 with 1% pyridine-d5 at 100 °C. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 3a (Fig. S20), one singlet signal at 9.61 ppm was observed for the porphyrin core. In addition, one multiplet at 8.85 ppm, three doublets at 8.80, 7.85, 7.71 ppm, one doublet at 7.73, and one triplet at 7.33 ppm were all assigned to the thienyl groups. The methylene groups on the nitrogen atoms appeared at 4.15–4.00 ppm as two doublets. The signals for other alkyl protons were located at 0.88–2.13 ppm.
Prior to any further experiments, we performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to evaluate the thermal stability of 3a–d. The results showed weight loss of 5% at 306.2, 211.7, 210.3, and 242.4 °C for 3a–d, respectively (Fig. 2 and S1–S3), demonstrating stability for photovoltaic cell applications.


Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of 3a–d. For reference, the Q band of Mg-TEP-Ph4 is typically observed around 700 nm, while DPP shows absorption features in the range of 560 nm (Fig. S15). In 3a–d, the Q band was shifted into the NIR region (800–1000 nm) and had much stronger intensity. From this, we conclude that there was enhanced intramolecular charge transfer between the electron-donating porphyrin and the electron-accepting DPP units. For example, two strong absorption peaks were observed at 587 and 781 nm for 3a. To exclude aggregation, the absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded as a function of concentration (Fig. S16 and S17). Importantly, from linear correlations we conclude no appreciable aggregation within our concentration range from 4.98 × 10−8 to 4.44 × 10−6 M.

Such strong absorption in the NIR region suggests a significant redistribution of charge density from the porphyrin core to the peripheral DPP units. Compared with 3a, the electron-withdrawing nature of the CHO group in the DPPs of 3b is reflected in the red-shifted Soret and Q bands (λmax = 613 and 799 nm, respectively). Furthermore, the presence of the strong electron-withdrawing RHA groups in 3c induced a further red-shift of these bands (λmax = 646 and 853 nm, respectively) and effectively enhanced the intensity compared with another reference porphyrin, Mg-TEP-TIPS2-TMS2 (Fig. S8). The absorption onset for 3c was shifted all the way to just short of 1000 nm, which is meaningful for OSC applications from the viewpoint of maximum light-harvesting. For 3d, because of the MOB groups of 3d, its Soret and Q bands were slightly blue-shifted (λmax = 589 nm and 779 nm, respectively) compared with those of 3a.
We examined the electrochemical properties of 3a–d by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 4) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV, Fig. S6 and S7). Four reversible reductions and an irreversible oxidation were observed for 3a. Due to the limited solubility and complicated structure of 3b–d, no clear reductions or oxidations were noted. Of relevance are the HOMO and LUMO energies and the corresponding band gaps, which were calculated on the basis of the DPV results (Table 1). The HOMO–LUMO gap of 3a is 1.63 eV (CV, Fig. 4), which is much smaller than the gap for porphyrins with two DPPs. The small band gap of 3a is rationalized based on extension of the porphyrin π-system via conjugation to the four electron-accepting DPP units. This results in much stronger charge transfer character. In fact, the data shown in Table 1 indicate that the band gap is tunable by the electron-accepting character of the DPP units. In addition, we measured the ionization potential (IP) for solids of 3a–d in air by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (Table 1): −5.21 eV for 3a, −5.35 eV for 3b, −5.27 eV for 3c, and −5.06 eV for 3d.

a Values were determined by DPV. Measurements were performed in THF solution containing TBAPF6 (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte at 25 °C with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Glassy-carbon, platinum wire, and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential was measured versus Fc/Fc+.

The spectral changes, which are associated with the one-electron oxidation and reduction, were further examined in spectroelectrochemical experiments (Fig. S12). Upon oxidation, 3a gave rise to minima at 600 and 785 nm, accompanied by maxima at 668 and 840–1300 nm. Reduction resulted in minima at 420, 600, and 775 nm, accompanied by maxima at 490 and 820–1100 nm.
The fluorescence spectrum of 3a has a peak at 801 nm in anisole and 806 nm in benzonitrile (PhCN) (Fig. S13). Comparing the fluorescence spectra of 3a in anisole and PhCN for solutions of matching optical density at 480 nm indicates fluorescence quenching of 36% in PhCN. Additionally, the Lippert–Mataga plot suggests an increase in dipole moment in the fluorescent excited state compared to the ground state (Fig. S19). This all together leads to the involvement of a charge-transfer state in the fluorescent deactivation of 3a. In time-resolved fluorescence experiments, the fluorescence lifetimes were determined to be 0.71 and 0.57 ns for 3a in anisole and PhCN, respectively. A similar trend was observed for 3d with fluorescence lifetimes of 0.63 ns in anisole to 0.53 ns in PhCN.
By femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with multiwavelength and global/target analyses of time-resolved spectra, the time-dependent excited state features and kinetics were investigated (Fig. 5 and 6). Notably, transient absorption experiments show only minor changes as the concentration of 3a is increased (Fig. S18). For this, the R-package TIMP and the graphical user interface GloTarAn were used. Upon photoexcitation of 3a in PhCN at either 480 (Fig. S14) or 775 nm (Fig. 5 and 6), the differential absorption spectra were dominated by the formation of a transient at a delay of 2 ps featuring minima of 445, 600, and 800 nm together with the broad transient in the 900–1500 nm range (Fig. 5). This transient decays on a timescale of about 2000 ps (Fig. 6a). At first glance, some resemblance with the results of spectroelectrochemical reduction and oxidation of 3a is noted, where the minima reflected the one-electron reduction of 3a, while the maxima in the NIR reflected the one-electron oxidation of 3a. A closer look, however, reveals subtle differences.
Multiwavelength analyses indicate the presence of four different components in the excited state decay (Fig. 5). Thus, to gain a clearer understanding, we applied a four-species kinetic model for data fitting (Fig. 7). Based on the conclusions drawn from the steady-state absorption and fluorescence experiments and accounting for the Mg-TEP-Ph4 results, the first species, which evolves upon excitation from the ground state, is assigned to a short-lived (<1 ps) excited charge-transfer state. The second species is likely an excited charge-transfer state reached by solvent relaxation and possible also vibrational relaxation. Evidence for the relaxation is a significant broadening of the transient species (Fig. 6b). At this stage, we infer a competitive deactivation through radiative deactivation of the excited charge-transfer state with a lifetime of 558 ± 3 ps back to the ground state, on the one hand, and transformation into a charge-separated state, on the other hand. Note the excellent agreement with the fluorescent lifetimes derived in time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. This charge-separated state is the third species, with its signatures at 500 and 700 nm, along with the broad transient in the NIR feature at 900–1150 nm. Its lifetime of 9.8 ± 1 ps is consistent with the process of charge delocalization across the four peripheral DPPs to form the fourth species. The spectroscopic similarities between the third and fourth species further support these assignments. The ground state is recovered within 253 ± 1.4 ps.

To elucidate the electronic structure of 3a–d, we performed theoretical calculations for 3a–c. The optimized structures (3a′–c′) are shown in Fig. 9 and S35. Optimizations were carried out with the Gaussian09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. We used isobutyl groups instead of 2-ethylhexyl groups for clarity. The calculated values are listed in Table S7. As shown in Fig. 9, the extended π-conjugation of 3c′ it is nearly planar.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 3a′–c′ listed in Table 2 were used to calculate the band gaps, which decreased in the order of 3a′ > 3b′ > 3c′ and agree well with the absorption spectra. Among 3a′–c′, 3b′ has the deepest HOMO while the HOMO and LUMO of 3c′ are slightly higher and lower, respectively, than those of 3b′. As a consequence, the band gap of 3c′ is the smallest. The calculated HOMOs and LUMOs of 3a′–c′ are shown in Fig. 10. Overall, the HOMO distributions are not notably different. In stark contrast, the LUMOs of 3b′ and 3c′ extend to the end-caps (CHO and RHA) on the peripheral substituents. We infer that this causes the LUMOs of 3b′ and 3c′ to have lower energy than the LUMO of 3a′. These electron-withdrawing end-caps also have a noticeable effect on HOMO energy levels and, hence, on the band gaps.

We fabricated solution-processed BHJ OSCs with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC61BM/PNDIT-F3N/Ag (ITO = indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS = poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) under AM 1.5 illumination, 100 mW cm−2. The device performance was initially explored by mixing 3a with PC61BM at different ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:2 in chlorobenzene (CB) solution and applying the blended films at different thicknesses of 90–130 nm (Table S1 and S2). As shown in entry 1 of Table 3, when processed without any post-treatment, the optimized device provided a PCE of 5.80% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.75 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.35 mA cm−2, and a low fill factor (FF) of 47.45%. In this devise, the suitable D–A ratio was 1:1.5 and thickness was 110 nm.

To further improve PCE, we examined the use of pyridine as an additive, thermal annealing (TA), and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) of the photoactive layer. Pyridine addition and thermal annealing did notably enhance performance in 3a-based devices (Table 3). Pyridine addition presumably improves PCE by increasing the interfacial area in BHJ films and suppressing excessive aggregation in the active layer by coordinating to porphyrin. In this case, however, we suspect that pyridine addition resulted in insufficient phase separation of the blended film.
When SVA treatment with tetrahydrofuran was applied for 20 s, the PCE of 3a devices increased to a highest value of 7.40%, with slight increase in JSC from 16.35 to 16.42 mA cm−2, a notable increase in FF from 47.45% to 62.24%, and a minor decrease in VOC from 0.75 to 0.73 V. We surmised that SVA was useful for achieving better phase separation in the blended films, as shown in Fig. 11. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the films treated with SVA had surface morphologies distinctly different from those of the as-cast films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was 2.68 nm for the as-cast BHJ film and 1.37 nm for the SVA-treated BHJ film. Thus, SVA is critical for the formation of smaller nanoscale domains and smoother films, both of which are facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport. It has been reported that charge generation and extraction are closely related to FF, which will be discussed in detail below. For 3d, performance was lower, with a PCE of 2.71%, VOC of 0.67 V, JSC of 9.40 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.43 (ESI, Table S5). We attribute this difference in performance to solubility, which appeared to be improved by the 2-ethylhexyloxy group in 3a.
Compounds 3b and 3c have conjugated CHO and RHA end-caps. Overall, broader and red-shifted absorption is correlated with stronger intramolecular charge transfer and greater expansion of π-system conjugation. However, the 3b:PC61BM and 3c:PC61BM devices performed poorly, with PCE of less than 1% (Table S5). Energy-level mismatch relative to PC61BM plays a role. In our CV measurements in THF, we found a LUMO level of −3.95 eV, which is lower than that of PC61BM (−3.80 eV) (Fig. 8). This is undesirable for charge separation between electron donors and acceptors.

J–V curves for the devices made with as-cast and SVA-treated films are presented in Fig. 12, and detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S4. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the 3a:PC61BM devices with optimized blended films are shown in Fig. 13. For both type of devices, photocurrent generation evolves throughout the 300–900 nm region and agrees well with the absorption spectrum. Overall, the EQEs in the regions of 350–600 nm and 700–820 nm slightly increased when SVA was used. EQEs are higher than 50% in the 450–590 nm and 760–840 nm regions, with a maximum value of 65% at around 585 nm. Consistent with the absorption spectra, which extended to the long wavelength region, the offset of the EQE spectrum of devices based on 3a reached 1000 nm. The JSC values obtained by integrating the EQE curves of the as-cast and SVA-treated 3a:PC61BM devices were 15.74 and 15.88 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well (less than 4% errors, Table S4) with the measured values for the corresponding devices.
To better grasp the impact of SVA on the efficiency of charge generation and extraction, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) in the devices. Jph is defined as Jph = Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight and Jdark are the photocurrent densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively; Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and V is the applied voltage. The Jphversus Veff plots are shown in Fig. 14. Under low Veff conditions up to 0.6 V, Jph of both as-cast and SVA-treated device increases nearly linearly with increasing Veff, and became saturated at Veff above 2 V. Such high Veff is strong enough to suppress carrier recombination and promote transport of carriers to the electrodes. The saturation current densities (Jsat) were 19.25 and 17.25 mA cm−2 for the as-cast and SVA-treated 3a devices, respectively. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) is given by Jph/Jsat and was calculated as 84.9% and 95.2% for the as-cast and SVA-treated 3a devices under the conditions of JSC. In short, SVA is likely to increase the charge dissociation probability, which increases FF and contributes to better device performance.
We next investigated the effect of SVA on charge transport by measuring hole and electron mobilities in bulk heterojunction films of 3a:PC61BM by space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Hole and electron devices were fabricated with configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/3a:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/3a:PC61BM/PFN/Al, respectively. The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S11. Prior to SVA, the hole mobility was 1.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility was 2.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with μh/μe of 0.67. After SVA, the hole and electron mobilities increased to 3.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.97 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with μh/μe of 1.07. The hole mobility improved significantly, while the electron mobility only slightly increased. Most importantly, the μh/μe value almost became 1, indicating that the charge transport was more balanced. This is vital for reducing charge recombination and improving charge collection efficiency.
Insights into the charge recombination mechanism can be obtained from the slope β in the relationship of VOC ∝ βlnPlight. For a β that equals to kT/q, the main recombination mechanism is bimolecular, whereas a β of 2kT/q indicates monomolecular recombination (k, Boltzmann constant; T, temperature; and q, elementary charge). As shown in Fig. 15a, devices based on as-cast 3a have a slope of 1.29kT/q. After SVA, the slope is 1.08kT/q, which shows that, although the monomolecular recombination still occurs, bimolecular recombination is the main mechanism after SVA treatment. Charge recombination was further investigated by examining the dependence of JSC on light intensity (Plight), which are proportional to each other: JSC ∝ Plightα. The extent of bimolecular recombination is defined as the index α. When α is close to 1, bimolecular recombination is almost totally suppressed, while a value smaller than 1 suggests the occurrence of bimolecular recombination in the device. The α values were 0.95 and 0.97 for the devices with as-cast and SVA-treated films, respectively. In other words, SVA assists in reducing the bimolecular recombination probability and in improving FF (Fig. 15b).

In summary, a star-shaped small molecule electron donor Mg-TEP-DPP4 has been designed and synthesized in order to maximize the expansion of π-conjugation via four ethynyl linkers connected with four electron-deficient DPP units. Mg-TEP-DPP4 exhibited broad absorption bands across the visible and NIR regions, a narrow band gap, and suitable HOMO and LUMO levels for OSCs with the commonly used PC61BM electron acceptor. Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that vibrational relaxation was followed by charge separation and charge delocalization before the occurrence of charge recombination. We surmise four DPP units can stabilize the excited state through this charge delocalization, which is beneficial for effective polaron formation and improving performance. An important feature for device applications is that planar structure of Mg-TEP-DPP4 assists in π–π stacking after SVA. After SVA, the blended films have a better morphology, balanced charge carrier transport, reduced charge recombination, and favorable charge collection. All of these aspects contribute to the high PCE of 7.40%. This PCE value is fair among OSCs and future improvements are needed, but star-shaped Mg-TEPs conjugated with four DPP units were successfully prepared and applied in OSCs as donor materials. Although Mg-TEP-DPP-CHO4 (3b) and Mg-TEP-DPP-RHA4 (3c) were ultimately unsuccessful designs, these negative results provide insights into the influence of solubility and frontier orbital energy level matching when using this end-capping strategy. We believe that Mg-TEP-DPP4 is valuable for the development of effective donor materials, and these efforts are now under way in our laboratory.

In absorption spectroscopy, UV/vis spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometers. The data were collected with the software UV WinLab using a slit width of 2 nm and a scan rate of 480 nm min−1. Steady-state fluorescence studies were carried out with a FlouroMax®-3 spectro-fluorometer (Horiba Scientific). Fluorescence lifetimes were determined through the TCSPC technique using a Fluorolog 3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The sample was excited with a NanoLED-405 from Horiba with excitation wavelength 480 nm, and the signal was detected by a Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier (type R3809U-50). All measurements were conducted in cuvettes under argon atmosphere. The time profiles were recorded at 805 nm. The fluorescence lifetimes were best fitted by a single exponential decay. Femtosecond transient absorption studies were performed using transient absorption pump/probe detection system (HELIOS, Ultrafast System). The laser pulses were generated by a Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier fs system (CPA-2110, Clark MXR) operating at 1 kHz (output 775 nm, 150 fs pulse width, energy around 400 nJ). For the 775 nm excitation wavelength, the laser output was used directly. Excitation pulse of 480 nm wavelength was generated by a NOPA; bandpass filters with ± 5 or ± 10 nm were used to ensure low spectral width and to exclude 775 and 387 nm photons. All measurements were conducted in 2 mm quartz cuvettes under argon atmosphere. Obtained data were treated with the multi-wavelength and global/target analysis. In case of the multiwavelength analysis the kinetics were fitted either mono- or multi-exponential.


The patterned ITO substrates were cleaned by sonicating for 15 min in surfactant water, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were then dried using a N2 gun and subjected to 15 min UV/O3 treatment. Next, a filtrated PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al4083) solution was deposited on the substrate via spin-coating (3000 rpm for 30 s) followed by thermal annealing in air for 10 min at 120 °C. These devices were carried to the glovebox and the active layer was deposited in the N2 atmosphere. A 30 mg mL−1 solution of porphyrin derivatives 3a and PC61BM in chlorobenzene with 1% pyridine (v/v) was prepared with a 1:1.5 w/w donor/acceptor ratio. The solution was allowed to keep at 80 °C for 1 hour in the nitrogen atmosphere. The films were prepared by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of active layer was ∼120 nm. The substrates were transferred into a vacuum chamber. All devices were deposited LiF (0.6 nm) and then Al (80 nm). The active area (0.04 cm2) was defined by the geometric overlap between Al and ITO.
