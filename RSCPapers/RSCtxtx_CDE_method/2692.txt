In this work, α- and β-position naphthalene substituents as side chains on asymmetric BDT were used as donor building blocks to build wide bandgap (WBG) donor materials (PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1) with fluorinated benzotriazole (T1) as the acceptor unit. The two co-polymers were used to build polymer solar cells (PSCs) with PC71BM or ITIC acceptor material. In ITIC acceptor material based devices, the PαNBDT-T1 co-polymer with a larger dihedral angle between main backbone and naphthalene ring achieved a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.60% with improved short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) compared with PβNBDT-T1, which was ascribed to the excellent morphology of the blended film. The open circuit voltage (VOC) was also maintained at a decent level upon introducing these naphthalene rings due to their high ionization potential and low electron density. Interestingly, for PC71BM based devices, the two polymers show a reverse situation compared with an ITIC system. The PβNBDT-T1 with a small dihedral angle between the main backbone and naphthalene rings shows a slightly higher performance than PαNBDT-T1. However, in the PC71BM system, both polymers did not exhibit ideal optical performance due to their unmatched absorption spectrum. These phenomena indicate that the asymmetric BDTs have great potential towards achieving high optical performance with non-fullerene acceptor materials.

Over the past few decades, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with advantages of low weight, low-cost and roll-to-roll printing, have made great progress in improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Nowadays, the common structure of BHJ PSCs comprises an n-type acceptor material (typically fullerene derivative) and p-type conjugated polymer as the donor material. Fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), have played a leading role as electron acceptors due to their high electron mobility and have been successfully applied as electron acceptors in PSCs. Despite the remarkable success of fullerene derivatives when used as common acceptors, for example their PCEs have surpassed 10% by molecular design and device engineering, their drawbacks are also obvious such as poor absorption of incident solar energy, limited tunability of electronic energy levels and high production costs. Compared to fullerene derivative acceptors, fullerene-free acceptors have attracted much attention with impressive advantages such as being easy to synthesize and exhibiting ideal absorption in the visible-light region and easily adjustable energy levels. The most widely researched fullerene-free acceptors are perylenediimide (PDI) and N2200. Currently, the most famous fullerene-free acceptor is ITIC, which has recently achieved a prominent breakthrough in photovoltaic performance. The PSCs of ITIC derivative based devices have already reached over 12%.

Besides n-type acceptor materials, p-type conjugated polymer donors are also not to be ignored. Currently, most fullerene-free PSCs are based on a symmetrically modified one-dimension (1D) or two-dimension (2D) benzodithiophene (BDT) moiety used as the electron-donating building blocks. Recently, we designed a symmetry-breaking strategy to combine the advantages of both 1D and 2D symmetric BDTs and constructed high-performance photovoltaic materials. In this type of structure, one of the impressing advantages was that it can trigger a modulation of the preferential ordered microstructure and form optimized molecular stacking, which match well with the fullerene acceptors. However, it was undefined if the strategy was efficient for fullerene-free acceptors, such as ITIC.
Very recently, we designed and synthesized two polymers based on α- and β-naphthalene as substituents on the asymmetric BDT unit and investigated the effects of the different extended conjugated orientations and intermolecular π–π interactions on the JSC and VOC values. As a result, the polymer based on the β-position linked naphthalene resulted in the asymmetric BDT exhibiting excellent photovoltaic performance with a PCE up to 9.80% in fullerene-based PSCs.
Considering the features of the two forms of naphthalene group, we synthesized two co-polymers based on asymmetrical BDT units with the α- and β-position of the naphthalene rings used as the donor building blocks and the well-known fluorinated benzotriazole as the acceptor building blocks. Then, we further studied the relationship between the donor/acceptor material blends and solar cell performance. As a result, both polymers matched well with the absorption spectrum of ITIC and exhibit decent optical performance in the ITIC system. In addition, Hou and co-workers reported that the dihedral angle between the BDT and conjugated side groups plays an important role in affecting the absorption bands, HOMO levels, crystallinities, and aggregation sizes of the polymers. We also investigated the effect of the dihedral angles between the naphthalene rings and BDT main backbone on the optical performance of the device. Interestingly, the PαNBDT-T1 based devices show high PCEs around 9.60% with a significantly higher VOC, slightly higher JSC and FF compared with PβNBDT-T1. However, in the PC71BM system, both polymers did not exhibit ideal optical performance due to their unmatched absorption spectra. PβNBDT-T1 shows a relatively higher PCE of 4.78% (with higher JSC = 9.77 mA cm−2 and FF = 66.09%) than the 3.41% PCE observed for PαNBDT-T1 (with lower JSC = 7.52 mA cm−2 and FF = 57.35%). In addition, we found that the co-polymer with a larger dihedral angle between the naphthalene rings (α form) and BDT could form a better blending morphology with ITIC, while the co-polymer with the smaller dihedral angle (β form) could form a better blending morphology with PC71BM. These phenomena indicated that weaker intermolecular stacking PαNBDT-T1 co-polymers can achieve high optical performance in the ITIC system. Overall, this study provides useful information on asymmetric BDT among the chemical structures, film morphologies, and photovoltaic properties of fullerene-free polymer solar cells.

The synthetic route and molecular structures of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 are shown in Scheme 1. The two polymers were synthesized via Stille polymerization using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as catalysts with a high yield. The crude products were purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, n-hexane, chloroform and chlorobenzene (CB) as the eluent. The structures of the two polymers were characterized by elemental analysis. PαNBDT-T1 shows better solubility than PβNBDT-T1, which is due to the bigger dihedral angle between the side chain and main backbone. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and PDI of the two polymers were obtained using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent. The Mn of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 were 75.4 K and 78.6 K with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.65 and 1.70, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to characterize the thermal stability of the polymers. The TGA results reveal that the temperatures with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PβNBDT-T1 and PαNBDT-T1 were 300 °C and 340 °C, respectively, which indicate that the thermal stability of the polymers was good enough for PSC applications. The data are shown in Table 1.

In order to further research the optoelectronic properties of the PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 polymers, density functional theory (DFT) was used with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level of theory to gain insight into their geometries. The alkyl side chain was replaced with methyl groups to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. S1, the dihedral angles between the naphthalene rings and BDT unit of PβNBDT-T1 and PαNBDT-T1 are 58.27° and 75.25°, respectively, which can improve the solubility of the two polymers. The naphthalene rings side groups in PαNBDT-T1 will result in stronger steric hindrance and then hamper the interchain π–π interactions. In addition, we can see that both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the two polymers are evenly distributed along the conjugated backbones. The energy levels simulated by the DFT calculations coincide well with the data obtained from the cyclic voltammograms.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 recorded in CB solution and spin-cast film at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1a, respectively, and the detailed absorption data, including the absorption maxima and band edges in solution and film, are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers show a strong absorption at 400–650 nm, which can match the absorption spectrum of the ITIC. The two polymers show similar absorption characteristics both in solution and as a film. The absorption edge (λonset) and absorption band maxima (λmax) of PβNBDT-T1 were red-shifted 16 nm and 11 nm, respectively compared to those of PαNBDT-T1. Moreover, both polymers show a strong 0–0 peak (λ0–0) and a weak 0–1 peak (λ0–1) charge transfer transition absorption, implying strong inter-chain aggregation. To study the aggregation behaviour of the two polymers in solution, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 in dilute chlorobenzene solution (10−5 M) were tested from room temperature to 100 °C (Fig. 1b and c). As the temperature increased, the change in the UV-vis absorption spectra indicated that the defined vibronic structures were gradually weakened, accompanied by a blue-shift in the main absorption. As a result, the intensity ratio of I0–0/I0–1 between λ0–0 and λ0–1 was used to further estimate the degree of aggregation. When the temperature increased from room temperature to 100 °C, the I0–0/I0–1 values decreased almost linearly. As shown in Fig. S2, the two polymers exhibit an obvious difference. For PαNBDT-T1, the I0–0/I0–1 value was less than 1 when the solution was heated to 60–70 °C, indicating that the stronger aggregation was already broken. In contrast, PβNBDT-T1 exhibits higher I0–0/I0–1 values at the same temperatures, indicating that the stronger aggregation still existed in the solution. Even when the temperature was increased to 100 °C, the aggregation was not completely broken. This indicates that PβNBDT-T1 shows stronger intermolecular stacking than PαNBDT-T1. The Eoptg of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 are 1.95 eV and 1.90 eV calculated by the equation Eoptg = 1240/λ, respectively, obtained from the λonset values of film absorption.


The HOMO energy levels of the two polymers were measured using cyclic voltammetry in a three-electrode system, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1 and described in Fig. S3. Both polymers show lower HOMO energy levels due to the introduction of the low electron density naphthalene moiety, which can ensure a decent VOC value for the PSC device. As a result, PαNBDT-T1 exhibited a deeper-lying HOMO level of −5.40 eV than PβNBDT-T1 at −5.32 eV, suggesting the higher VOC of PαNBDT-T1 PSC device. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy levels were calculated using the following empirical formulas: ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.8 − E1/2(Fc/Fc+)), where Ered is the onset reduction potential. The LUMO levels of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 are −3.64 and −3.59 eV, respectively, which are higher than those of ITIC (−3.78 eV) and provide a sufficient driving force for exciton separation. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference was 0.39 V vs. SCE.


BHJ-PSCs devices with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties using PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 as the donor materials and ITIC/PC71BM as the acceptor material. The solvent chlorobenzene was chosen for processing because it easily dissolves PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1, and it has a high boiling point, which could form a better nanoscale morphology in the photoactive layers. It is well known that thermal annealing and additives may be helpful for the nano-scaled phase separation of the polymer and acceptor blends. Herein, we also used these two methods to obtain the best optical performance device. Additives did not have a positive effect in this work. We fabricated photovoltaic devices using various donor and acceptor weight ratios to optimize the device PCEs (Table S1), and the data for the optimum device are shown in Table 2. In the ITIC system, both polymers showed good PSCs performance with a D:A ratio of 1:1.5 by weight using chlorobenzene as the solvent. PαNBDT-T1 shows significantly higher PCEs (9.60%) with desirable VOC = 0.87 V, JSC = 18.53 mA cm−2 and FF = 59.63% than PβNBDT-T1. The larger dihedral angle between the side chain and BDT unit is beneficial for an appropriately longer π–π stacking distance to gain a higher VOC, while the higher JSC and FF benefit from the uniform film morphology. In the PC71BM system, the better film morphology of PβNBDT-T1 and PC71BM is beneficial towards achieving higher JSC and FF values. Moreover, we selected high performance co-polymers based on two-dimensional symmetric BDT units and fluorinated benzotriazole with non-fullerene and fullerene acceptors for comparison (Table 2). In addition, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the most optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and the photovoltaic performance summarized in Table 2. The JSC calculated for AM1.5 irradiation by integrating the EQE spectra was consistent with the JSC obtained from the J–V curve. Both polymers exhibited an ideal absorption between 400 and 700 nm in the ITIC system. However, the two polymers exhibit poor absorption in the PC71BM system and lower PCEs due to the lower matching between the absorption spectrum of the polymers and PC71BM. In the ITIC system, the EQE of PαNBDT-T1 was slightly better than PβNBDT-T1 due to the higher absorption value in the range 400–750 nm, which indicates a better JSC and reflects a much better photo-response.

The donor photon energy loss was calculated using the equation Eg − eVOC, where Eg is the optical band gap and the VOC was obtained from the corresponding optimum solar cell device fabricated with ITIC and PC71BM. In addition, the Eg − eVOC values of PβNBDT-T1 and PαNBDT-T1 were calculated and are shown in Table 2. The Eg − eVOC value of PαNBDT-T1/ITIC was 1.08 eV, which was close to other previously reported fluorine substituted benzotriazole derivative based PSCs materials, such as J51 (1.19),J52 (1.23),J61 (1.04), and PBDTTS-FTAZ (1.07). This implies that the polymer may show good photovoltaic performance in analogy with polymers with the same backbone.
As we all know, charge-transport behaviour of the active layers is also a crucial factor to impact the JSC and FF values. To further investigate the photovoltaic properties, the hole (μh) was characterized via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, using the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/MoO3/Al, while the μe was measured by the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al. The current density was calculated by J = 9εμV2/(8L3), where ε represents the dielectric constant of the metal, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device (V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes), and L is the thickness of the active layer. In the ITIC system, the calculated μh values of the PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 based devices were 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the corresponding μe were 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. S4. The lower μh/μe of PαNBDT-T1 (1.24) was consistent with the higher JSC and FF values observed compared to PβNBDT-T1 (2.08).
To investigate the exciton generation and charge collection behavior, the photocurrent density (Jph)–effective voltage (Veff) data were used to gain the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss). The Jph is the difference in light and dark current density, and the Veff is defined as V0 − Vappl. V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage. The Pdiss of devices under short circuit conditions based on PαNBDT-T1:ITIC, PβNBDT-T1:ITIC, PαNBDT-T1:PC71BM and PβNBDT-T1:PC71BM were 95%, 86%, 89% and 83%, respectively. This result suggests that, for the PαNBDT-T1:ITIC based devices, both the processes of dissociation of photo-generated exciton into free charges and the charge collection near the electrodes are more efficient than the others. Moreover, the light intensity dependent J–V curves were also characterized. From the VOC–Plight curves (Fig. 3b), all the photo-generated carriers recombine within the device under open-circuit conditions. The slope of the VOCversus light intensity curve is equal to 1 × kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge and T is temperature in kelvin; the main energy loss mechanism is bimolecular recombination. Moreover, the slope equals to 2 × kT/q, which is dominated by Shockley–Read–Hall recombination (monomolecular recombination) attributed to trap-assisted recombination. Herein, for the PαNBDT-T1:ITIC, PβNBDT-T1:ITIC and PβNBDT-T1:PC71BM based devices, the slopes yielded 1.05 × kT/q, 1.15 × kT/q and 1.44 × kT/q, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination was the main energy loss mechanism in the three devices. However, the slope of the device based on PαNBDT-T1:PC71BM was 1.73 × kT/q, and the result suggested that monomolecular recombination plays a dominant role in this condition rather than bimolecular recombination. In addition, we used light intensity-dependent photocurrent measurements to investigate the charge recombination behavior of the optimized device (Fig. 3c). The correlation between JSC and light intensity follows a power law dependence on the light intensity. According to the formula JSC ∝ Plights, where the slope (s) of both PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 should be equal to 1, the bimolecular recombination in both the devices is negligible in the ITIC system. According to the negligible monomolecular recombination and absent bimolecular recombination, the devices based on PβNBDT-T1:ITIC (S ∼ 1) and PαNBDT-T1:ITIC (S ∼ 0.99) have the best optical performance in this work. However, the slopes of PαNBDT-T1:PC71BM (S ∼ 0.90) and PβNBDT:PC71BM (S ∼ 0.92) based devices deviate from 1, which was particularly observed in the PαNBDT:PC71BM based device, indicating the occurrence of some degree of severe bimolecular recombination resulting in the decreased device efficiency.

As we all know, the JSC and FF are important parameters for PSCs, which are affected by the charge carrier mobility of both the donors and acceptors, and the charge extraction capability. The JSC and FF are also closely related to the blend morphology of the acceptor materials and co-polymer donor materials. To further investigate the nanoscale morphologies of PαNBDT-T1 and PβNBDT-T1 with the ITIC or PC71BM blend films, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the nanomorphology of both blend films. The TEM images of the blends are shown in Fig. 4. As can be observed from the images (a and c), the blend based on PαNBDT-T1:ITIC showed a uniform phase separation compared to PβNBDT-T1:ITIC, which gained a higher FF because the larger dihedral angle between the BDT unit and naphthalene ring could help to break the ITIC aggregation. As shown in the TEM images (b and d), the blend based on PβNBDT-T1:PC71BM showed obvious fibril-like polymer aggregations, which were beneficial for exciton diffusion and charge transport. This is the main factor for the higher JSC and FF observed. The different optimal blending manner of PC71BM and ITIC is the key factor in forming the totally different morphologies.


In summary, α- and β-position naphthalene substituted asymmetric BDTs were used to build appropriate wide band-gap conjugated polymers with a fluorine substituted benzotriazole derivative. We built PSC devices based on the two co-polymers and PC71BM or ITIC. As a result, the optimal devices based on the PαNBDT-T1/ITIC blend showed better optical PCEs (9.60%) with higher JSC and FF than PβNBDT-T1 (6.73%). However, in the PC71BM system, PβNBDT-T1 showed a better optical performance than PαNBDT-T1.

PαNBDT-T1, with weaker intermolecular stacking, is suitable for ITIC to build an excellent blend film morphology, which contributes to the high PSC performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of asymmetric BDTs with non-fullerene acceptor materials to achieve high PSC performance.

The BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC or (polymer:PC71BM)/PFN/Al. Patterned ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. Next, the ITO substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 20 min. After that, the PEDOT/PSS layer was spin-coated on the top of the ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 35 s and dried at 120 °C for 20 min under an argon atmosphere. Then, the active layers were spin-coated onto the treated ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate using a chlorobenzene solution with different blend ratios of polymer and PC71BM/ITIC. The blend solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. Then, the pre-solubilized PFN interlayer material was spin-coated onto the active layer and finally, Al was thermally evaporated under a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa on top of the active layer. The area of the device was 0.1 cm2. All the fabrication processes were carried out inside a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere.


The molecular weight (Mn) and PDI were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis on an ELEOS system using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a SDT-Q600 analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The J–V characteristics of the PSC device were measured on a Keithley 2420 source measurement apparatus under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The UV-vis spectra were obtained using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were measured on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode system: a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in acetonitrile used as the electrolyte. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the photovoltaic devices were measured on a Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. The J–V curve was measured on a xenon lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters as the light source. The SCLC was measured by taking the current–voltage in the range of 0–5 V and fitting the results to a space charge limited form. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a HITACHI H-7650 electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.


All starting chemicals were purchased from J & K as analytically pure grade and used without any further purification. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were used after distillation from sodium/benzophenone under an argon atmosphere. Compound T1-Br, (4-(naphthalen-2-yl)-8-((2-octyldodecyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) and (4-(naphthalen-1-yl)-8-((2-octyldodecyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) were synthesized according to the literature. The synthetic routes used for the two polymers are shown in Scheme 1 and the synthesis details are described below.


Compounds T1-Br monomer (77.46 mg, 0.12 mmol), αNBDT-Sn monomer (112.63 mg, 0.12 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (4.0 mg), and P(o-tyl)3 (8.0 mg) were added to a flame-dried and nitrogen-filled two-neck flask (25 mL). After adding toluene (7 mL), the mixture was heated to 115 °C and stirred overnight. Then, after cooling to room temperature, the solution was dropped into methanol. The raw product was collected by filtration and purified by Soxhlet extraction with hexane, acetone, dichloromethane and chloroform. Then, the remaining solid was dropped into methanol again. The product was collected and dried overnight under vacuum at 40 °C to give a black solid (96.66 mg, 73.45%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C68H85F2N3OS4: C 72.49%, H 7.60%, found: C 71.98%, H 7.86%. GPC: Mn = 75.4 KDa, PDI = 1.65, Td = 340 °C.


The synthesis was the same as described for the PαNBDT-T1 polymer. A black solid was obtained (85.77 mg, 65.18%). Elemental analysis calcd (%) for C68H85F2N3OS4: C 72.49%, H 7.60%, found: C 71.55%, H 7.47%. GPC: Mn = 78.6 KDa, PDI = 1.70, Td = 300 °C.
