Light scattering layers can play an essential role in the transport characteristics of charge carriers and the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Perovskite oxide materials have recently attracted considerable attention as light scattering materials due to their optical and structural properties. Herein, we synthesized TiO2–CoTiO3 composites with a facile room temperature sol–gel procedure for use as a light scattering layer in the photoanode of DSSC devices. TiO2–CoTiO3 composites were applied as monolayer photoanodes and bilayered films on a nano-TiO2 photoactive layer. Microstructural investigations of the composite photoanodes showed a bimodal texture consisting of CoTiO3 coarse and TiO2 fine particles. CoTiO3 containing photoanodes exhibited a higher light scattering property and lower dye adsorption amount compared to the control pristine TiO2 electrode. Photovoltaic metrics of fabricated DSSC devices with different contents of CoTiO3 in mono- and bilayered configurations were recorded under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight, suggesting that the photovoltaic performance of the devices improved in the presence of the TiO2–CoTiO3 scattering layer. Interestingly, no considerable difference in photovoltaic operation of CoTiO3 in the mono- and bilayered configurations was achieved (i.e., photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.46% and 7.67% for mono- and bilayered devices, respectively). However, their PCEs are about 80% higher than that of the control device without the light scattering layer.

Invented by Grätzel et al. in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) provide a technically and economically viable alternative to present day p–n junction photovoltaic devices. DSSCs are attractive because they are made of cheap materials that do not need to be extensively purified and can be printed at low cost. They are unique devices compared with almost all other kinds of solar cells in that electron transport, light absorption and hole transport are each handled by different materials in the cell. The sensitizing dye in a DSSC anchors on a wide-bandgap semiconductor such as TiO2, SnO2 or ZnO. When incident light is absorbed by a sensitizing dye molecule, the photo-excited electron rapidly injects to the conduction band of the semiconductor, which carries the electron to the anode. A redox couple, usually composed of iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), then reduces the oxidized dye back to its neutral state and transports the positive charge to the platinized counter-electrode. Nanoparticulate pure and doped-TiO2 with metallic and non-metallic elements such as Co, Zr, Nb, Cr, N, and C as the preferred photoanode material play a key role in DSSCs owing to their unique photoelectric characteristics and high specific surface area, for loading dye molecules. However, they suffer from a poor light harvesting efficiency limited by the poor light scattering property in the visible light region due to the fine particle size. In fact, light scattering in DSSC devices is achievable by large particles with diameters comparable to the wavelength of the incident light. Mono- and bilayered configurations are two main approaches to improve this property. Submicrometer size particles were incorporated in the nanocrystalline photo-absorbing film (monolayer) and/or introduced as a separate scattering layer on the nanocrystalline film (bilayer). Both mono- and bilayered approaches have been proved effective for efficient utilization of the solar spectrum and enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). A bilayered structure photoanode consists of an underlying light-absorbing layer and a coarse film as a light scattering layer on the top. The scattering layer is normally composed of rutile-TiO2 or ZrO2/TiO2 particles with a size of around 400 nm, which are mixed with small anatase-TiO2 particles acting as a binder, and is placed on top of the mesoporous TiO2 working electrode film.

Metal titanate based oxides in the form of MTiO3 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn) are semiconducting perovskite materials with unique properties and potentially have wide industrial applications as photocatalysts, gas sensors, electronic components, and pigments. The optical and photovoltaic properties of these oxide perovskites make them interesting candidates for a light scattering component in DSC devices. We observed such light scattering properties previously in TiO2–BaTiO3 composites where both mono- and bilayered approaches have been investigated as a function of the BaTiO3 content. It was found that CoTiO3 has suitable electronic band structure, large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and good stability. It belongs to the ilmenite structures where both Co and Ti prefer octahedral coordination with alternating cation layers occupied by Co and Ti alone. Moreover, CoTiO3 is chemically and thermally stable and can be applied in high-temperature environments. The optical bandgap of CoTiO3 (∼2.25 eV) is narrower than that of TiO2 (∼3.20 eV for anatase phase), so CoTiO3 appears green in color, differing from the white TiO2. It has strong optical absorption in the visible light region. Basically, the colored semiconducting materials can selectively absorb visible light. The absorbed photon energy can promote the electron transition and the formation of electron–hole pairs. This phenomenon has recently been reported when a red metallic oxide was used as a photocatalyst. Thanks to the unique photochemical and physical properties of CoTiO3, it has also been widely used as a magnetic recording medium, catalyst, gas and humidity sensor, photocatalytic oxidizer and high-k dielectric ceramic. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study on the performance of CoTiO3 as a light scattering layer in the photoanode of DSSCs has been reported so far.
In the present work, we synthesized a TiO2–CoTiO3 composite by a facile sol–gel procedure at room temperature. It was used in the DSSC's photoanode to improve the light scattering and electron transport properties. Photoanodes were made as a separate monolayer and bilayer film on a nano-TiO2 photoactive layer. In both cases, the impact of CoTiO3 content on the incident light scattering and photovoltaic performance of the DSSC devices was investigated.

CoTiO3 particles were prepared by an aqueous particulate sol–gel route reported previously. The first step was the preparation of a stable sol of TiO2. The water–acid mixture with a weight ratio of HCl:H2O = 0.04:3.35 was stabilised at 70 °C. 0.03 mol of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) with a purity of 97% (Aldrich) was added, forming a thick white precipitate, which gradually peptised for 2 h to form a clear sol. The desired amount of CoCl2·6H2O with a purity of 99.9% (Fluka) was dissolved in TiO2 sol at room temperature and stirred for 60 min to obtain a CoTiO3 sol. CoTiO3 particles were prepared by drying the sol at 70 °C, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h in air.


TiO2 nanoparticles with a pure anatase phase were prepared by a combination of sol–gel and hydrothermal methods based on our previous work, using TTIP as the titanium precursor and 1-octanol with a purity of 99% (Merck) as the solvent. TTIP was dissolved in 1-octanol to form a 0.55 M transparent precursor solution. Deionised water was added into the above solution, with a molar ratio of [H2O]:[Ti] = 3.3:1, to form the TiO2 sol. The prepared sol was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 4 h. The collected products (i.e., anatase-TiO2 nanoparticles) were washed with ethanol and deionised water several times and dried at 25 °C.


Different TiO2–CoTiO3 pastes with various percentages of CoTiO3 particles (0–30 wt%) were prepared based on a homemade formulation. We prepared mono- and bilayered DSSC devices, in which their photoanodes respectively consisted of only a photoactive layer and photoactive plus light scattering layers. Structural characteristics of these two different configurations are given in Tables 1 and 2. For monolayer photoactive films, TiO2–CoTiO3 pastes with various contents of CoTiO3 were spin-coated on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. In addition, some TiO2–CoTiO3 photoanodes with an optimized content of CoTiO3 (i.e., 20 wt%) were prepared with different film thicknesses (Table 1). The prepared pastes were also employed to fabricate bilayered photoanodes containing an underlying pure anatase-TiO2 porous film with a thickness of 14 μm as a photoactive layer and different TiO2–CoTiO3 films as scattering layers on the top, as given in Table 2. All deposited films were annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere. Post-treatment with 0.04 M TiCl4 solution was applied to the newly annealed electrodes, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min.

In order to sensitize the photoanodes, the resulting electrodes were soaked in 0.5 mM N719 (Solaronix) solution for 18 h under dark conditions. Counter electrodes were made by drop-coating of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg Pt in 1 ml ethanol) on clean FTO substrates and then heat-treatment at 400 °C for 30 min. To assemble the final DSSC device, a platinum electrode was placed over the dye-loaded photoanode electrode, and the edges of the cell were sealed with a sealing sheet (SX 1170-60, Solaronix). The iodide/triiodide based redox electrolyte was injected into the cell through the small hole and sealed with a small square of sealing sheet. The redox electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M dimethyl propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine in acetonitrile.

X-ray diffraction plots were recorded by using a PHILIPS-PW1730 instrument, Netherlands, operating at 30 kV and 10 mA at 2θ of 20–80° (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). The cross-sectional and surface graph of the films and microstructural figures of the synthesized powders were imaged by using a field emission scanning electron microscope, FE-SEM, Mira 3-TESCAN, Czech Republic. Diffuse reflectance of TiO2 and BaTiO3 samples and their corresponding optical bandgap estimation were carried out using a UV-visible spectrometer, AVASPEC-2048-TEC, Netherlands. A BaSO4 disc was used as a reflectance standard in the DRS experiment. Specific surface area and pore size distribution of the particles were measured by a BELSORP MINI II analyzer, Japan, with N2 absorption–desorption isotherms, applying the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equations at 77.35 K. The adsorbed N719-dye molecules on the photoanodes were spectroscopically determined by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (6705 JENWAY; JENWAY, Staffordshire, UK) after forced dye desorption into an aqueous solution of 0.1 molar NaOH and compared with respect to the macroscopic geometric area of the electrodes. Photoelectrical metrics of the DSSC devices were characterized using a Zahner Cimps pcs solar simulator (Zahner, Kronach, Germany). It should be noted that each batch included five devices and the average values were reported. The light intensity was set at one sun (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) under ambient conditions with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.


Structural evolution of TiO2 and CoTiO3 particles was characterized by XRD and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that all sharp peaks corresponding to hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles originated from the anatase crystal structure with the strongest peak located at 2θ = 25.3°. However, the XRD pattern of the synthesized CoTiO3 particles shows a mixture of cobalt titanate and cobalt oxide (Co3O4) phases. The reported theoretical bandgap energies of both CoTiO3 and Co3O4 phases are lower than that of anatase-TiO2. Therefore, the presence of cobalt phases may improve the photovoltaic characteristics of TiO2–CoTiO3 based DSSCs by enhancing electron injection.

The average crystallite sizes were calculated to be 8 and 42 nm for TiO2 and CoTiO3, respectively, based on the Scherrer equation

Fig. 2 displays adsorption–desorption isotherms of N2 gas and pore size distributions for nanostructured TiO2 and large particulate CoTiO3. For TiO2 nanoparticles, we can observe a gradual gas desorption at the pressure below the saturation pressure. However, the adsorbed gas exhausted more rapidly from the CoTiO3 sample with lower relative pressure. This means more capillary condensation of nitrogen gas within the mesoporous scaffold of TiO2 and the presence of finer pores, compared with CoTiO3 particles (as shown in Fig. 2, inset). In addition, TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit a high inner surface area (SBET) of 96.32 m2 g−1 that is much larger than that for the CoTiO3 sample, SBET = 47.495 m2 g−1. The significant difference between the inner surface area and porosity of two particles indicates that the TiO2 photoanode can provide a perfect porous scaffold for sensitizer loading; however, it is limited by the CoTiO3 particles.
In order to study the impact of CoTiO3 particles on the light scattering property of the TiO2 film, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analysis of mono- and bilayered photoanode electrodes was conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 3a. The TCo20 and T/TCo15 photoanodes exhibited higher light scattering properties than the pristine TiO2 monolayer electrode. This beneficial effect can be related to the unique morphology of the CoTiO3 particles with large mirror-like facets. Moreover, the surface–surface connection between polyhedral particles rather than the point–point connection may trap the photons and return them into the system. Fig. 3b shows the optical bandgap energy difference between the TiO2 nanoparticles and CoTiO3 particles based on the Tauc model, which was determined by an extrapolating linear region of the plots of the transformed Kubleka–Munk function versus the energy of exciting light.
The Kubelka–Munk function, F(r), allows the optical absorbance of a sample to be approximated from its reflectance according to the following equation
(2)
It is estimated that the optical bandgap energies of TiO2 nanoparticles and CoTiO3 particles are 3.1 eV and 2.6 eV, respectively. The higher diffuse absorption and reflectance property of CoTiO3 under visible light irradiation is expected to improve the utilization of the light harvesting in the DSSCs.
We used a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) to study the microstructure of the synthesized powders used as the major component of the photoanodes. As shown in the FE-SEM micrographs of Fig. 4, the average particle sizes for pure anatase-TiO2 and CoTiO3 particles were 25–30 nm (Fig. 4a) and 2–4 μm (Fig. 4b), respectively. It is evident that the TiO2 nanoparticles with a narrower size distribution and a larger specific surface area have good potential for the active layer of a DSSC photoanode as the dye adsorption scaffold. Furthermore, the large CoTiO3 particles are good candidates for the scattering layer of DSSCs due to their unique octahedral morphology with large mirror-like facets that can improve the visible light scattering.
Top-view and cross-sectional FE-SEM images of photoanode electrodes made of TiO2–CoTiO3 binary oxides with various contents of CoTiO3 are shown in Fig. 5. Compared to pristine synthesized powders (Fig. 4), the preparation processing of paste formulation as well as the heat treatment had no influence on the morphology and average size of both TiO2 nanoparticles and CoTiO3 particles. The pristine TiO2 photoanode contains 30 nm nanoparticles (Fig. 5a) and has a thickness of around 14 μm (Fig. 5b). The surface morphology of the TCo20 monolayer and T/TCo15 bilayered electrodes (Fig. 5c and e) shows a uniform texture of 30 nm TiO2 nanoparticles and 2–4 μm CoTiO3 polyhedrals. The thickness of the TCo20 monolayer film was also around 14 μm (Fig. 5d), whereas it was about 17 μm for the T/TCo15 bilayered film (Fig. 5f).
The amount of adsorbed N719-dye on different photoanodes was spectroscopically determined by UV-vis absorption. Dye-loaded photoanodes were immersed in a NaOH solution (0.1 molar in water) for dye desorption and their UV-vis absorption spectra are compared in Fig. 6. It seems that the density of adsorbed N719 sensitizer dye on the monolayer photoanode surfaces is considerably affected by the CoTiO3 content and film thickness (Fig. 6a and b). If we recall the large average particle sizes of CoTiO3 from the SEM graphs (Fig. 4 and 5), we can conclude that the overall specific surface area of the photoanode would decrease with increasing CoTiO3 contents, resulting in a decrease in dye-loading. Here it is noteworthy that there are usually some pores in the film with bimodal texture, consisting of coarse and fine particles, which may improve its dye adsorption. On the other hand, these pores can act as surface defects and create some electron traps, decreasing the photocurrent density of the corresponding DSSC photoanode.Fig. 6b shows the direct dependence of the adsorbed dyes as a function of the photoanode thickness.
It was expected that a thicker mesoporous scaffold can expose a larger specific surface area to anchor a higher population of dye molecules. However, there is essentially no difference between the N719-dyes exuded for various bilayered photoanodes (Fig. 6c), suggesting the same values of dye-loading. It can be stated that dye adsorption of a bilayered photoanode is mainly controlled by the nano-TiO2 photoactive layer compared to TiO2–CoTiO3 scattering layers.
Photovoltaic performance of CoTiO3 particles as a light scattering component in mono- and bilayered photoanodes of DSSC devices was investigated. Fig. 7a shows J–V curves of monolayer DSSC devices with various contents of CoTiO3 in a 14 μm-thick photoanode matrix, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. Interestingly, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices was increased by the introduction of CoTiO3. As VOC is dependent on the difference between the Fermi-level of the photoanode's semiconductor and redox potential, we can conclude that CoTiO3 causes a negative shift of the semiconductor Fermi-level. Such energy-level displacement is consistent with the obtained results by DRS analysis, suggesting a lower bandgap energy of CoTiO3 compared to TiO2 (see Fig. 3b). However, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the DSSC devices exhibited a different trend as a function of a CoTiO3 content, first increasing with an increasing amount of CoTiO3 up to 20 wt% and then decreasing with further increasing CoTiO3. This can be related to the opposite contributions of CoTiO3 particles to incident light scattering and dye adsorption, the two main factors determining the photocurrent density of the cell. The scattering effect of the incident light improved by introduction of CoTiO3 particles with a content of up to 20 wt% (see Fig. 3a), leading to a higher JSC. However, the dye absorption decreased with a further increased CoTiO3 content (see Fig. 6a), resulting in less excited electrons, reduced electron injection to the conduction band of the TiO2/CoTiO3 semiconductors, and eventually a rapid decrease in JSC. Therefore, the highest PCE of 5.37% was achieved for the TCo20 device. Fig. 7b and Table 3 show the impact of film thickness on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices containing TCo20 monolayer photoanodes. As the thickness of the photoanode increased, VOC decreased slightly, probably due to the higher surface energy states and more rapid charge recombination. On the other hand, an enhanced light absorption was achieved by a larger internal surface area of the photoanode film due to higher concentration of absorbed dye molecules, leading to an improvement of JSC. A photoanode thickness of 17 μm was found to be optimal for the photovoltaic performance. In addition, when the photoanode film was too thick (ca. 20.1 μm), the fill factor (FF) of the corresponding curve decreased, due to an increase in the internal resistance of the DSSC device.

Fig. 7c and Table 3 summarize the photovoltaic performance of bilayered DSSC devices in which the scattering layers of TiO2–CoTiO3 with various contents of CoTiO3 were deposited on the underlying TiO2-nanoparticle photoactive layer. The total thickness of the photoanodes was kept constant at ca. 17 μm, as optimized for the monolayer DSSC devices, in which approximately three-fourths belonged to the underlying pristine TiO2 layer, and one-fourth to the supernatant scattering layer (as shown in Fig. 5f). We observed that the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices was enhanced in the presence of a bilayer TiO2–CoTiO3 scattering film. Furthermore, JSC increased for all CoTiO3 contents, with no decrease in VOC, indicating a constant Fermi-level of the photoanode. However, the FF of the cells decreased due to the higher thickness of the photoanode in a bilayered configuration, leading to an increase in internal resistance of the device. Nonetheless, the overall PCE of the devices with a bilayer scattering film was enhanced. The highest PCE value of 7.67% was achieved by using the TCo15 scattering layer, which is 85% higher than that of the pristine TiO2 device and also 3% higher than that of the best monolayer DSSC device with 20 wt% CoTiO3 in a 17 μm-thick TiO2 photoanode.

TiO2–CoTiO3 composites were introduced as a light scattering component in monolayer and bilayered photoanodes of DSSC devices. The structural and optical characterization of the CoTiO3 containing photoanodes revealed higher light scattering, lower inner surface area, lower amounts of dye-loading and optical bandgap narrowing, compared to those of the pristine TiO2 photoanode. Microscopic graphs showed a unique octahedral morphology with large mirror-like facets for CoTiO3 particles, improving the visible light scattering. The photovoltaic metrics of the fabricated DSSC devices were remarkably affected by incorporating CoTiO3 particles. In the cases of monolayer photoanodes, the highest PCE of 7.46% was observed for the photoanode with 20 wt% CoTiO3 and an optimized thickness of 17 μm. In bilayered photoanodes, the highest PCE of 7.67% was achieved by the electrode containing an underlying layer composed of pure nano-TiO2 and a TiO2-15 wt% CoTiO3 scattering layer on the top, thanks to its higher JSC and VOC.
