A series of novel polythiophene derivatives comprised of alternating structures of N-alkylated thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (nTPD, n = number of carbon atoms from 11 to 18 in alkyl chains) and pristine thiophene were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction between 2,5-dibromo- or 2,5-diiodo-nTPD and 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene. The effect of alkyl side-chain structures at the N-atom of TPD on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties has been investigated systematically. In addition, these properties were compared with a widely used polythiophene derivative, i.e., poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Optical bandgaps of the obtained polymers PnTPDTs estimated from absorption and fluorescence spectra were 1.8–2.1 eV, which were comparable or smaller than that of P3HT (2.0 eV). HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PnTPDTs were determined by electrochemical and optical measurements. The HOMO levels are −5.4 to −5.7 eV, which are lower than that of P3HT (−5.2 eV). The photovoltaic properties of the devices consisting of PnTPDT (n = 11, 12, 13, 18) with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were investigated. The short-circuit currents (JSC) in the PnTPDT:PCBM devices were relatively low and varied significantly with alkyl side-chain structures (0.81–2.29 mA cm−2), whereas the open-circuit voltage (VOC) values were higher by 0.1–0.2 V than that in the P3HT:PCBM device. The P12TPDT:PCBM device exhibited the photocurrent generation exceeding wavelength of 750 nm, but the power conversion efficiency was found to be moderate (0.75%).

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted much attention as a promising renewable energy source due to their potential for flexibility, low-cost, lightweight, and large-area processability. The most successful device structure for high performance OPVs is based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure consisting of an interpenetrating network of electron donor and acceptor materials. In polymer-based BHJ solar cells, conjugated polymers are used as electron donor materials, and fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are commonly employed as electron acceptor materials. As a prototypical electron-donating material, a polythiophene derivative, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has been widely investigated in polymer BHJ solar cells, and remarkable progress has been made in understanding the device physics as well as improving the device efficiency.BHJ solar cells with a photoactive layer comprising a mixture of P3HT and PCBM have revealed relatively high device performance with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 4–5%. However, the relatively large bandgap of P3HT (∼2.0 eV) limits the fraction of the solar spectrum that can be harvested, and the relatively small difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT (donor) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene derivative (acceptor) results in a decrease in the open circuit voltage (VOC) (∼0.6 V). As an electron-donor component in a photoactive layer of OPVs, the conjugated polymers should possess the LUMO energy level higher than −3.9 eV to have sufficient driving force for the electron transfer from the excited state of the polymers to the acceptor, i.e., PCBM. In addition, the HOMO energy level of the polymer should be around −5.4 eV to absorb a large fraction of the solar spectrum as far as possible and to enlarge the VOC. Note here that HOMO and LUMO levels of P3HT are −3.2 and −5.2 eV, respectively. In addition, since 3-hexylthiophene is an asymmetrical molecule, there are three relative orientations when the two thiophene rings are coupled at α-positions; head-to-tail (2–5′), head-to-head (2–2′), and tail-to-tail (5–5′). The regioselectivity should be controlled carefully, since the high regioregularity with the head-to-tail manner (>90%) is known to afford high optical density and charge carrier mobility, which are important factors for attaining the high power conversion efficiency of 4–5% in the P3HT-based devices.

A fascinating approach to the polymers fulfilling the above requirement is to synthesize conjugated polymers with an alternative donor–acceptor (D–A) system containing fused aromatic rings. This strategy allows the polymers to adopt a more rigid and planar backbone, thereby enhancing effective π conjugation, preventing chain-folding, and lowering the bandgap. Recently, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units with electron-accepting substituents such as ester and fluoride disclosed excellent potential for the application to OPVs, affording power conversion efficiencies more than 7% by combination with electron-donating benzodithiophenes (BDT). The tendency of TT units to form quinoidal structure enhances the planarity of the backbone structure. In addition, the intramolecular charge transfer interactions between the electron-donating BDT and electron-accepting TT yielded the broad absorption and appropriate energy levels in the resulting D–A low bandgap polymers. However, synthesis of the copolymer PBDTTT is not straightforward because TT-based monomers have synthetic difficulties owing to its high reactivity at the 1- and 3-positions. On the other hand, imide-fused thiophene (thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, TPD) containing conjugated polymers have also demonstrated excellent photovoltaic properties as electron donors for OPVs. Several groups independently reported the D–A conjugated copolymer of BDT and TPD (PBDTTPD); Leclerc and coworkers described the first example of PBDTTPD-based OPVs exhibiting high η values of up to 5.5% using a large active area of 1 cm2. Fréchet and coworkers attained the maximum η value of 6.8%, which is one of the highest η values ever reported for the low bandgap polymer-based BHJ solar cells. Since TPD can also gain some stabilization energy by forming a quinoidal thiophene–maleimide structure, it is also possible to afford a polymer with low bandgap. Most recently, various donor units including dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene were combined with TPD, which have allowed to achieve high η values of up to 7.3%.
To realize better device performance in OPVs, it is also of pivotal importance to control the film morphology, which is affected significantly by the structure of side-chains as well as the backbone. In the previous reports on the TPD-based polymers, straight alkyl chains and alkyl chains with short branches at 2-position, e.g., n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups, were used as substituents on the N-atom. However, in spite of the excellent utility of TPD as an electron-accepting unit in D–A low bandgap polymers, the effect of alkyl side-chain structure on the N-atom has yet to be systematically investigated. In this report, we describe the synthesis of novel D–A conjugated copolymers consisting of unsubstituted thiophene as an electron-donating unit and TPD as an electron-accepting unit. Various alkyl side-chains with straight or branched structures were introduced at the N-atom of TPD units. Pristine thiophene was selected as donor unit here because of its facile accessibility and compact structure that can reduce the steric repulsion with carbonyl groups of the neighboring TPD units to extend the π-conjugation length. We expected that the resulting polythiophene derivatives, PnTPDT (n = number of total carbon atoms in the alkyl side-chain, Scheme 1), would have lower HOMO energy levels as well as narrower bandgaps than P3HT as a result of the electron-deficient fused-imido groups. Note here that the symmetric structures of TPD and pristine thiophene make PnTPDT regioisomer-free, in contrast to P3HT. The optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of PnTPDT were investigated in detail and compared to those of P3HT. More importantly, the effect of alkyl side-chain structures at N-atom of TPD was studied systematically to better understand the relationship between the molecular structure and photovoltaic properties.


1H NMR spectra were obtained with a JEOL JNM-EX400 NMR spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-470 Plus spectrometer using KBr pellets. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were carried out on a SHIMADZU Prominence equipped with JAIGEL-3HAF (Japan Analytical Industry) column using chloroform as an eluent after calibration with standard polystyrene. Purifications by preparative GPC were conducted by LC-908 equipped with JAOGEL-3H, 4H (Japan Analytical Industry) columns using chloroform as an eluent. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were carried out with an Asylum Technology MFP-3D-SA in the AC mode. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted with a SHIMADZU TG-60 under flowing air at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was made on a DSC 822e (Mettler) at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectra were measured on a SHIMADZU Biotech AXIMA-CFR with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as a matrix. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded with a SPEX Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA). Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured by using a CEP-2000 (Bunkoh-Keiki). A time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method was used for the fluorescence lifetime measurements in the nanosecond and subnanosecond time-scale and the time resolution was ∼80 and 110 ps (FWHM) for the excitation wavelength 648 and 483 nm, respectively.

Electrochemical measurements were made using an ALS 630a electrochemical analyzer. Redox potentials of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as a supporting electrolyte. An ITO working electrode coated with polymer films, a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M in acetonitrile) reference electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode were employed. Decamethylferrocene/decamethylferrocenium (+0.15 V vs.NHE) was used as a standard for all measurements.

All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality, purchased commercially and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. 1,3-Dibromo- or 1,3-diiodo-5-alkylthieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (nPDT-X2; n = number of total carbons in the alkyl side-chain, X = Br or I) and 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene (T(SnBu3)2) were synthesized according to the literatures. Synthetic details of nPDT-X2 are described in the ESI.


The polymers, PnTPDT (n = 11, 12, 13, 18), were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction (Scheme 1).


A dried Shrenk tube was charged with 1,3-diiodo-5-alkylthieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (12TPD-I2; 30 mg, 0.052 mmol), T(SnBu3)2 (38 mg, 0.057 mmol), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (3.7 mg, 0.0053 mmol) and distilled toluene (1 mL) in an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 72 h. The cooled mixture was subsequently poured into methanol and the black precipitate was collected on a membrane filter. The product was washed with methanol and hexane. Purification by preparative GPC yielded the polymer as a black product (5.6 mg, 27%).

The organic solar cells were fabricated as follows.Indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 5 Ω ☐−1 (Geomatec) was used. The substrates were sonicated consecutively with acetone and ethanol for 10 min. After blow-drying and UV-ozone treatment, the substrates were spin coated at 4000 rpm with poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP AI 4083) and dried with a hot plate at 200 °C for 10 min. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, an active layer of polymer:PCBM (American Dye Source, Inc.) film was formed by spin coating a solution of polymer:PCBM mixture on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS. The spin-coating was conducted at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm from chloroform solution (5 mg mL−1) for P12TPDT:PCBM and at 2500 rpm from chlorobenzene solution (15 mg mL−1) for P18TPDT:PCBM, P11TPDT:PCBM, and P13TPDT:PCBM. Then, a TiOx layer was prepared by spin coating an ethanol solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 2000 rpm and then leaving for 30 min under ambient atmosphere. The titanium(IV) isopropoxide was hydrolyzed to yield the TiOx layer. Finally, an Al (The Nilaco Corporation) layer was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (5 × 10−3 Pa) to yield the layered device structure (denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/TiOx/Al). Schematic illustrations of the top and side views of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/TiOx/Al device are depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI). Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured under ambient atmosphere and simulated solar light, air mass (AM) 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2).


We have prepared the novel copolymers consisting of N-alkylated TPD and pristine thiophene, PnTPDT, with four different alkyl side-chains of n-dodecyl (n = 12), n-octadecyl (n = 18), 1-pentylhexyl (n = 11), and 1-hexylheptyl (n = 13). P12TPDT and P18TPDT have less bulky straight side-chains with different lengths, while P11TPDT and P13TPDT bear alkyl branched side-chains, i.e., alkyl chains branched at the 1-position, which are bulkier than the straight alkyl chains and the alkyl chains with a small branch at the 2-position used in the previous studies. These substituents were chosen to investigate the effect of the length and the steric hindrance of alkyl side-chains on the various characteristics of the polymers such as optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties as well as molecular weights. The copolymers were synthesized viaStille coupling starting from TPD dibromide or diiodide with distannylated thiophene as outlined in Scheme 1. After washing with methanol and hexane, the resulting polymers were purified by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to remove low molecular weight materials. The chemical structures of the polymers were confirmed by 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of P12TPDT and P18TPDT with straight alkyl side-chains were estimated by GPC analysis using polystyrene standards as calibrants, and found to be relatively high; 87000 (polydispersity index (PDI) = 4.1) for P12TPDT and 39000 (PDI = 1.5) for P18TPDT (Table 1). The degrees of polymerizations are ca. 220 for P12TPDT and ca. 80 for P18TPDT, respectively. On the other hand, the estimated Mn values of P11TPDT and P13TPDT with branched alkyl side-chains were 2700 and 4300, respectively (Table 1), which are much lower than those of P12TPDT and P18TPDT. The degrees of polymerizations are ca. 7 for P11TPDT and ca. 10 for P13TPDT, respectively. The polycondensation reaction may be hindered by the large steric hindrance of the branched alkyl side-chains. All the polymers, except P12TPDT, showed sufficient solubility in a wide range of common organic solvents including chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene to yield uniform thin-films on glass substrates by a spin-coating method. P12TPDT was soluble in chloroform but only partially soluble in other solvents such as toluene and chlorobenzene. The relatively short alkyl side-chain with linear structure may be insufficient for solubilization of the copolymer with the high molecular weight. Solid and solution samples of the polymers were stable in air for more than several months in the ambient atmosphere.

The thermal properties of PnTPDTs were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the results are listed in Table 1. All the polymers were thermally stable with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 420 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. No distinct glass transition was observed up to 350 °C in their differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the second heating and cooling runs. The high-thermal stability of the obtained polymers prevents the degradation of active layers applied in OPVs.


Fig. 1 displays absorption spectra of PnTPDT (n = 11, 12, 13, 18) and P3HT in chloroform solutions and of their film states spin-coated on glass plates. The main optical properties are listed in Table 2. The chloroform solutions of all polymers reveal broad absorption bands covering the visible region accompanied by the π–π* transitions of the polymers (Fig. 1a). The introduction of the electron-deficient imido group to the polythiophene backbone resulted in the wider absorbance of PnTPDT than that of P3HT. It should be stated here that the absorptions of P11TPDT and P13TPDT at longer wavelength from 650 to 750 nm are poor compared to those of P12TPDT and P18TPDT in chloroform (Fig. 1a). The low molecular weights of P11TPDT and P13TPDT may limit the effective conjugation length in the main chain of P11TPDT and P13TPDT. In the film state, the absorptions of PnTPDT are largely red-shifted (Fig. 1b) compared to those in solution. These bathochromic shifts are ascribed to the interchain associations and π–π stackings of these polymers in the solid states. However, such a trend in P3HT is larger than that in PnTPDT, implying the more intensive intermolecular interaction and ordering of the polymer chain in the P3HT film than the PnTPDT films. The red shifts of absorption wavelengths from the solution state to the film state are large for P11TPDT and P13TPDT with branched alkyl side-chains compared to P12TPDT and P18TPDT with straight alkyl side-chains. The high molecular weights of P12TPDT and P18TPDT with straight alkyl side-chains may already induce a certain degree of packing even in the diluted chloroform solution. It should also be noted here that the absorption edges of PnTPDT (750–800 nm) films are comparable or even more red-shifted relative to that of PBDTTPD film (ca. 750 nm).

Fig. 2 depicts the photoluminescence spectra of PnTPDT and P3HT in chloroform and in the film states. P12TPDT and P18TPDT exhibited red-shifted emission peaks in comparison with P11TPDT and P13TPDT, which also reflects difference in the effective conjugation length. The fluorescence lifetimes of the PnTPDT films were also measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique at emission peaks with excitation at 648 nm. The decays of all the polymers were analyzed by a major component with a fluorescence lifetime (τ) of 0.2–0.3 ns (97, 97, 89, and 85% for P12TPDT, P18TPDT, P11TPDT, and P13TPDT) and a minor component with τ = 0.6–0.8 ns (Table S1, ESI). The fluorescence lifetimes of PnTPDT are longer than that of P3HT in both chloroform and film (τ < 0.1 ns), but the degree of the fluorescence quenching of P3HT in the film state relative to the solution is larger than that of PnTPDT (Table S1). Moreover, such a trend in P11TPDT and P13TPDT is suppressed compared with that in P12TPDT and P18TPDT. These results suggest that the order of the degree of intermolecular interaction in the film states is P11TPDT ≈ P13TPDT < P12TPDT ≈ P18TPDT < P3HT, which may be rationalized by the order of the steric hindrance of the alkyl side-chains in the polymers: the branched alkyl side-chains of P11TPDT and P13TPDT < the long straight alkyl side-chains of P12TPDT and P18TPDT < the short straight alkyl side-chain of P3HT. Such packing states in the PnTPDT polymers would have a large impact on the device performance in BHJ solar cells, taking into account that the formation of ordered nanostructure is essential for efficient hole transport of conjugated polymers (vide infra).
From the middle point of the steady-state absorption and emission peaks calculated in an energy unit, the optical bandgaps (Egopt) of the polymer films are determined to be 1.79 eV for P12TPDT, 1.81 eV for P18TPDT, 2.09 eV for P11TPDT, and 1.91 eV for P13TPDT (Table 2). As expected, the Egopt values of P12TPDT and P18TPDT films are lower than that of P3HT (∼2.0 eV) owing to the intramolecular charge transfer interaction, whereas the bandgaps of P11TPDT and P13TPDT with low molecular weights are rather comparable to that of P3HT.


Fig. 3 illustrates the cyclic voltammogram of PnTPDT films on ITO electrodes in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M n-Bu4N+PF6− as a supporting electrolyte and decamethylferrocene as an internal standard. P12TPDT shows one quasi-reversible reduction peak with an onset at −1.01 V vs.Ag/AgNO3 and one irreversible oxidation peak with an onset at 0.68 V vs.Ag/AgNO3. From the onset of the first oxidation and reduction potentials, the energy levels of HOMO and LUMO for P12TPDT are estimated to be −5.4 and −3.7 eV, respectively, given that the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 reference is −4.6 eV under vacuum (Table 2). The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO for P18TPDT are also estimated to be −5.4 and −3.5 eV, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The electrochemical bandgaps (Egec) are 1.7 eV for P12TPDT and 1.9 eV for P18TPDT, which largely match the optical bandgaps (Egopt) of P12TPDT (1.79 eV) and P18TPDT (1.81 eV). It has been well recognized that the LUMO energy level of the donor must be positioned above that of the acceptor (i.e., PCBM) by at least 0.3 eV to facilitate electron transfer from the donor excited state to the acceptor. The LUMO levels of P12TPDT and P18TPDT are higher by 0.6 and 0.8 eV than the LUMO of PCBM (−4.3 eV), which is sufficient to undergo the photoinduced charge separation in the blend films. In addition, the HOMO levels of both P12TPDT (−5.4 eV) and P18TPDT (−5.4 eV) are lower than that of P3HT (−5.2 eV) as a result of the introduction of the electron-deficient imido groups. This is advantageous to improve VOC values, which is known to depend on the difference between the HOMO energy level of donor and the LUMO energy level of acceptor. As the HOMO levels are below the air oxidation threshold (ca. −5.2 eV), the copolymers should show sufficient air stabilities. On the other hand, the onset reduction potentials of P11TPDT and P13TPDT are −1.18 and −1.20 V vs.Ag/AgNO3, both of which correspond to the LUMO level of ca. −3.6 eV (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Unfortunately, the HOMO levels of these copolymers could not be determined electrochemically, since their oxidation peaks and onsets were obscure. Thus, the HOMO levels estimated from the LUMO and optical bandgaps are −5.7 eV for P11TPDT and −5.5 eV for P13TPDT. Fig. 4 summarizes the energy levels of PnTPDTs, P3HT, and PCBM with buffer layers and electrodes used in the OPV devices, demonstrating that all new polymers are good candidates as donor materials.


The photovoltaic properties of PnTPDT were investigated using BHJ-type OPV devices with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PnTPDT:PCBM/TiOx/Al, where the active layer was sandwiched between the hole transport (PEDOT:PSS) and hole blocking (TiOx) layers. For the polymers P18TPDT, P11TPDT, and P13TPDT, active layers of the polymer:PCBM were spin-coated from chlorobenzene (CB) solutions (1:1 (w/w)) with concentrations of 15 mg mL−1. Because of the low solubility of P12TPDT in CB, chloroform was used to obtain a film of P12TPDT:PCBM (1:1 (w/w)) with concentrations of 5 mg mL−1. Fig. 5 illustrates the current–voltage characteristics of the OPV devices under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and η are summarized in Table 3.

Both the P12TPDT- and P18TPDT-based devices possess a VOC of 0.71 V, which is higher than that of the P3HT-based devices (0.60 V). This can be explained by the low HOMO levels of P12TPDT and P18TPDT due to the electron-withdrawing imide groups. Moreover, the P11TPDT and P13TPDT-based devices revealed further improved VOC values of 0.80 and 0.85 V, respectively. Although their oxidation potentials are uncertain, the LUMO levels comparable to those of P12TPDT and P18TPDT and the relatively wide bandgaps suggest the lower energy levels of the HOMO for P11TPDT and P13TPDT (Fig. 4). Although the relatively low JSC values of the PnTPDT-based devices lead to the low η values in comparison with those of the corresponding P3HT and PBDTTPD-based devices, the P12TPDT-based device shows the best performance among the PnTPDT-based devices (η = 0.75%, JSC = 2.29 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.71 V, FF = 0.46). Taking into account the comparable VOC and FF values, the variations of the JSC values crucially affect the η values for the P12TPDT, P18TPDT, P11TPDT, and P13TPDT-based devices.

Fig. 6 displays photocurrent action spectra of the PnTPDT:PCBM-based devices as well as the absorption spectra of the PnTPDT:PCBM blend films prepared under the same conditions as for the device fabrications. The absorption edges of the PnTPDT:PCBM films on ITO/PEDOT:PSS were similar to the single-component PnTPDT films on glass plates, suggesting no significant impact of PCBM on the polymer-chain orderings. All the photocurrent action spectra largely parallel those of the corresponding absorption spectra. In accordance with the difference in JSC values, the P12TPDT-based device exhibits higher IPCE values in a broad range covering from 300 to 750 nm than the other devices. The photocurrent response of the P12TPDT-based device in the long wavelength region of 700–750 nm is consistent with the narrow bandgap of P12TPDT film compared to the P18TPDT, P11TPDT, and P13TPDT films. It is noteworthy that the P18TPDT:PCBM film possessed low absorbance relative to the other films. The long octadecyl side-chain in P18TPDT can improve the polymer solubility in organic solvents, but simultaneously makes the separation distance between the polymer main chains larger. Thus, it would be difficult to fabricate a densely packed P18TPDT:PCBM film that leads to high absorbance as well as high charge-transporting ability. Although the comparable light harvesting efficiency of the P12TPDT:PCBM, P11TPDT:PCBM, and P13TPDT:PCBM films is in the visible region, the small molecular weights of P11TPDT and P13TPDT and bulky branched alkyl side-chains may hinder the effective interchain interaction for the hole transportation within the film, resulting in the lower JSC values than P12TPDT.
To gain better insight into the factor for the low JSC values of the PnTPDT-based devices compared to the P3HT-based devices, the surface morphology of the PnTPDT:PCBM film was accessed by AFM measurements (Fig. 7). The film morphology was quite rough compared to the blend film of P3HT and PCBM exhibiting the high η value.PnTPDT and PCBM were separated into islands with a domain size much larger than the exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm) in the photoactive layer. The poorer charge separation efficiency due to the small interfacial area of the polymer–PCBM boundaries may also lead to the lower JSC values than those for the P3HT:PCBM (Fig. S2, ESI) and PBDTTPD:PCBM devices. The AFM image of the P12TPDT:PCBM film reveals the rather smooth morphology without showing separated islands, which are different from the other AFM images. Such unique morphology may be associated with the more mixed state of P12TPDT and PCBM in the film and/or more intimate intermolecular interaction between the main chains of P12TPDT with the less bulky alkyl side-chain with the moderate length, leading to the highest device performance in the PnTPDT:PCBM devices.

We have successfully synthesized novel polythiophene derivatives PnTPDT consisting of alternating structures of imide-fused thiophene with various alkyl side-chains and pristine thiophene with no substituents. The alkyl side-chain structures at the N-atom of TPD were found to have a large impact on the optical and photovoltaic properties as well as the molecular weights of the resulting polymers. The optical bandgaps of P12TPDT and P18TPDT with large molecular weights are narrower than those of P11TPDT and P13TPDT as a result of the longer effective conjugation length of P12TPDT and P18TPDT. The HOMO energy levels of all PnTPDT are in the range of −5.4 to −5.7 eV, which are lower than that of P3HT (−5.2 eV) due to the electron-deficient imide groups. Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PnTPDT:PCBM/TiOx/Al. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) values in all devices were higher by 0.1–0.2 V than that in the P3HT:PCBM device. The P12TPDT-based device with straight dodecyl side-chain gave the best performance with a η of 0.75%, a VOC of 0.71 V, a JSC of 2.29 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.46. The JSC value of the P12TPDT-based device is higher than the devices with the other PnTPDT, and the photoresponse in the long wavelength region of 700 to 750 nm is prominent compared to the P3HT as well as other PnTPDT films, reflecting the narrow bandgap of the P12TPDT film. Although the power conversion efficiencies of the PnTPDT:PCBM-based devices are still moderate, the photovoltaic properties of the polythiophene derivatives with electron deficient-imide groups may be improved by modulating the side-chain structure as well as the device structure. Thus, the results obtained here, especially the effect of alkyl side-chain structures at the N-atom of TPD, will provide valuable information on the rational design of TPD-based polymers for high-performance organic electronics including organic solar cells.
