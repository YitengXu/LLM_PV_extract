Presented in this work is the application of a new silver(I) complex [Ag(POP)(Bphen)](BF4) (denoted AgPOP) to provide a means for down-shifting incident ultraviolet (UV) light into the visible range for PTB7-based organic solar cells. The synthesis, material, and optical characterisation of the AgPOP with PTB7 are reported. This material was applied to the OPV light-incident surface without the need for a host polymer. The luminescent down shifting layer serves two purposes. Firstly it improves the photocurrent of the OPV, and thus the efficiency through enhancement of the UV spectral response of the device. This is corroborated by external quantum efficiency data showing enhanced performance at UV wavelengths. Secondly, the AgPOP layer reduces the effect of degradation that originates from UV exposure, which leads to enhanced lifetime.

Luminescent down-shifting (LDS) materials have been widely used in photovoltaics (PVs) to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE). These materials absorb photons at wavelengths where the PV responds poorly (typically less than 400 nm) and re-emit photons at longer wavelengths, where the spectral response of the PV is much greater. LDS materials were first proposed in 1979 by Hovel et al. and whilst the potential for efficiency enhancement via LDS has been reported in a wide range of PV technologies, there are a limited number of reports that have been carried out on organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Currently one of the highest performing OPVs in literature, based on an inverted geometry using poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}[3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]) (PTB7) polymer, has reached a PCE of 9%. Further efficiency enhancements are still desirable and one method to obtain this could be by improving their short-wavelength response through the application of an LDS. In addition to the lower efficiency when compared to inorganic PVs, one further limitation for the commercialisation of OPVs is their poor long term stability. The causes of instability are numerous and complex and are induced or accelerated by a range of environmental effects such as oxygen, water and ultraviolet (UV) exposure, with the latter leading to photo-oxidation of active layers or polymer chain scission. This makes the technology unsuitable for outdoor applications unless a UV filter is applied. Therefore the application of an LDS onto an OPV could actually serve two purposes; firstly, the LDS would be able to absorb short-wavelength light (λ < 400 nm), for which the OPV cells exhibit low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and re-emit it at a longer wavelength (λ > 540 nm), where the EQE is much higher. Secondly, the LDS could remove the incident UV light, which is known to lead to increased OPV degradation.

A number of LDS materials have been investigated in solar cells including luminescent quantum dots, luminescent dyes and graphene quantum dots. Another possibility is to use metal complexes such as the mixed copper(I) complex [Cu(POP)(phen)](BF4) which contains bisphosphino-phenyl ether (POP) and phenanthroline ligands (phen), which are known to exhibit high absorption in the UV and photoluminescence in the visible range. Recently, a similar complex was prepared by replacing copper(I) by silver(I) which lead to a heteroleptic complex [Ag(I)(POP) (phen)].
In this paper, we report the preparation of a new silver(I) complex with POP ligand and bathophenanthroline (Bphen) ligand (AgPOP) and investigate its application as an LDS for OPVs. As this complex exhibited an absorption range of 250–400 nm and re-emission at 583 nm, this was applied to an OPV based on the PTB7 polymer, as the peak EQE of this material system overlaps closely with the emission of the AgPOP. The synthesis and characterization of PTB7 as a donor active layer is also reported. The application of the LDS layer leads to an increase in the PCE from 3.66 to 3.76%. Finally, the lifetime for a LDS-based OPV cell under illumination for 180 hours was studied. The LDS AgPOP not only enhanced the PCE but also operated as a UV filter to protect the photoactive materials from degradation. The time to drop to 20% of its initial value (t20%) was improved by 44%. To our knowledge, this is the first report that an LDS can operate as both a UV filter and performance enhancing layer for an OPV cell.

Silver tetrafluoroborate AgBF4 (100 mg, 0.513 mmol) and bis[(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (POP) (276 mg, 0.513 mmol) were dissolved in CH3Cl/MeOH (5:1) and stirred for 1 h, after which bathophenanthroline (4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, Bphen) (171 mg, 0.513 mmol) was added. This reaction mixture was stirred under argon at room temperature for 1 h, before the mixture was evaporated and the complex [Ag(POP)(Bphen)]BF4 (AgPOP) was obtained in 78% yield as a solid yellow powder, which formed colourless crystals by slow evaporation from CHCl3. 1H NMR (400 MH, CDCl3, δ): 6.88 (m, 4H), 7.05 (t, J = 7 Hz, 2H), 7.21 (m, 16H), 7.34 (m, 6H), 7.56 (m, 10H), 7.69 (d, J = 5 Hz, 2H), 7.98 (s, 2H), 8.91 (d, J = 5 Hz, 2H) ppm. 31P{1H} NMR (162 MHz, CDCl3, δ): −6.62 (2d, 1J31P,109Ag = 419 Hz, 1J31P,107Ag = 362 Hz) ppm.

2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (215 mg, 0.278 mmol) and 2-ethylhexyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,2-c]thiophene-2-carboxlate (131 mg, 0.278 mmol) were dissolved in 3.2 mL p-xylene and 0.8 mL dimethylformamide in a 25 mL Schlenk tube. Tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (16 mg, 0.014 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 5.5 hours. Then 0.5 mL 4-bromoanisole was added and reacted for an hour. The resulting mixture was precipitated into a mixture of methanol (80 mL)/37% HCl aqueous solution (1 mL). The precipitate was washed by Soxhlet extraction with ethanol for one day followed by a further day with methylethylketone, and then extracted with CHCl3. The solution was filtered through a thin silica gel column and finally re-precipitated into methanol. This was collected by filtration and the solid was dried in vacuum to yield a deep blue powder (205 mg, 98% yield). GPC: Mn = 41200 (Mn/Mw = 2.55).


OPV devices were initially prepared in a clean room environment using indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (Rs = 16 Ω per square) that were first cleaned using deionised water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic cleaner, then treated in a UV-ozone reactor with oxygen plasma for 10 minutes. A layer of zinc oxide film was deposited on ITO/glass substrate in a sputtering system (Leybold Univex) with a pressure of 4 × 10−6 Pa and at room temperature. A sintered ceramic sputter target with ZnO was used as the source material. All sputter targets for metal oxide depositions were sourced from Fourteen Technology, Anglesey, UK and possess a purity level of 99.99%. No further purification was needed. The sputter power and Ar flow rate were 100 W and 15 sccm, respectively. The distance between sputter target and substrate was around 8 cm. In order to make the films uniform, the substrates were kept spinning during the sputtering. A layer of ZnO was deposited at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1, to give a final thickness of 20 nm. Active layer blends using PTB7 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (C71-PCBM) with weight ratios 1:3 were prepared and mixed with chlorobenzene solvent with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1. Prior to coating, the blend was allowed to dissolve for 24 hours on a hot plate stirrer and filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. Samples were transferred into a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox ([O2], [H2O] < 1 ppm), where the active layer was applied by spin-casting from a 60 °C solution (1500 rpm for 60 seconds). No annealing of the active layer was conducted. Finally, thermal evaporation of the cathode was performed through a shadow mask and consisted of 10 nm of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and 100 nm of silver (Ag) to define an active area of 0.5 cm2.

Devices were checked for initial performance prior to lifetime testing. An average of 6 devices was used to ensure any changes were statistically reliable. The measurement system used to characterize the devices consisted of a Newport solar simulator with 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 G output (calibrated using a silicon reference cell from RERA in the Netherlands) and a Botest GmbH SMU for taking I–V measurements. The devices were then placed under the solar simulator for light soaking. Devices were kept at open circuit in between measurements and I–V measurements were made every 30 minutes. This was conducted in accordance with ISOS-L-2 standards. Whilst the temperature of the cells was not controlled, it was measured and stayed relatively constant during the testing at 40 °C ± 5 °C. Devices were measured for 180 hours or until the PCE reached 10% of its initial value.
EQE measurements were also conducted to investigate the general trend in EQE change with the LDS AgPOP. The EQE equipment is based around a Bentham monochromator (with 1 nm resolution) and an SRS lock-in amplifier. The light source is a xenon quartz bulb with an output spectrum from 370 nm to 1000 nm and the EQE measurements were taken every 2 nm over a range of 375 nm to 920 nm. A silicon photodiode (Thorlabs SM1PD1A) was used to make the reference measurement.
The LDS layer was mixed with CHCl3 (50 mg mL−1). The films were formed by doctor blading, with a final thickness measured at ∼1500 nm. The doctor bladed layers were dried at room temperature for one hour. UV-vis and transmission were measured with UV-vis-NIR (UV-3600 SHIMADZU), the photoluminescence was measured with Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscope (AFM) characterisation was undertaken using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIa.

The new silver complex [Ag(POP)(Bphen)](BF4) (AgPOP) was prepared according to a recently described procedure. The AgPOP complex was obtained with a high yield by the reaction of POP with stoichiometric quantities of Bphen and silver tetrafluoroborate AgBF4 (Scheme 1).

This compound was a solid yellow powder, luminescent under UV light as shown in the picture in Scheme 1. The complex AgPOP was characterized in solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy (ESI Fig. S1). The 31P{1H} NMR spectra (ESI Fig. S2) in CDCl3 displays two doublets centred at δ = −6.62 ppm because of the coupling of the equivalent phosphorus atoms with both the 107Ag (1J = 362 Hz) and 109Ag (1J = 419 Hz) nuclei (for 107Ag and 109Ag, the natural abundance are 48.2 and 51.8%, respectively). The X-ray structure for a similar AgPOP complex revealed that POP and phen formed a chelate complex with the silver(I) cation, which is in a distorted tetrahedral AgPPNN coordination environment. Irrespective of the metal, it has been already demonstrated that the ether O atom of the POP ligands are always at a nonbonding distance from the metal centres (>3.2 Å). In our case, it seems that the Ag central ion, in contrast to the Cu central ion, is unable to accommodate the POP and the phen substituted with bulky substitutions in position 2 and 9. This is most probably due to the larger size of the Ag ion, which prevents a chelating between the two nitrogen atoms and the Ag metal.
Only a few of the analogous silver(I) mixed ligand derivatives have been effectively prepared so far. Recently, investigations on luminescent silver(I) complex [Ag(dppb)2]BF4 have demonstrated that these type of complexes exhibit a high emission in solid state and it was selected for the fabrication of light-emitting devices. To the best of our knowledge, the application of silver(I) complexes as LDS for photovoltaic cells has not been reported.
To characterise the LDS layer, AgPOP in CHCl3 (50 mg mL−1) was added to the light-incident surface of the OPV cell by doctor blading and allowing the CHCl3 to evaporate at room temperature. An AFM image of the AgPOP film was taken and is shown in Fig. 2a. The surface roughness was measured at 0.60 nm showing that the AgPOP film forms a homogenous and smooth surface topography of 1500 nm in thickness. It is interesting to note that the silver(I) complex forms a colourless crystalline film after slow evaporation. The film exhibit a strong yellow luminescence under UV lamp exposure at λ ≈ 360 nm (Fig. 1) as well as high optical transmittance of ∼98% in the visible range (Fig. 2b). In addition, UV and PL measurement of the AgPOP film (Fig. 2c) demonstrated that the ligand-centered UV spectral features and the broad metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) bands in the 350–450 nm spectral window are typically similar to heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes containing 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and POP ligands. The MLCT absorption band of Ag(I) complexes containing a POP unit occurs at a higher energy. This is probably a result of the presence of electronegative phosphorus atoms as coordinative units, which tend to disfavor the electron donation to the phen ligand by the Ag(I) ion, leading to an energy increase of MLCT transitions. The higher intensity of the MLCT absorption bands of AgPOP is related to the presence of substituents in the 4,7 position of the phenanthroline ligand. The complex exhibit emission bands attributable to deactivation from MLCT excited levels (the luminescence spectra is shown in Fig. 2c.

PTB7 has been synthesised via Stille coupling reaction using the palladium complex catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 as shown in Scheme 2. Molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymer were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as an eluent and polystyrene standards and results are summarised in Table 1 and Fig. S3 in the ESI. PTB7 obtained from Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst showed low molecular weight of Mn = 41 k. This molecular weight is lower than in other reports but should be adequate for OPV fabrication as it possesses good solubility in chlorobenzene and compatibility with C71-PCBM in solution and film.

The optical and electrochemical properties of the polymer was examined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results are summarised in Table 1, Fig. S4 and S5. PTB7 in CHCl3 solution shows an absorption maximum (λmax) at 666 nm, with the absorption spectra in thin film and solution showing no difference. HOMO and LUMO levels in PTB7 were estimated to be −5.08 and −2.95 eV, respectively.
The PTB7 was prepared with C71-PCBM as active layer materials at a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 using chlorobenzene as the solvent. This blend was coated by spinning onto the ITO/ZnO electrode for the fabrication of the inverted cell ITO/ZnO/PTB7:C71-PCBM/MoO3/Ag. The performance was optimized; it was observed that the ratio of 1:3 with spin-coating at 1500 rpm and annealing at room temperature leads to a maximum efficiency of 3.66%. This efficiency is lower than the previously reported maximum for this material, which is equated to the different device structures and different optimum conditions. In particular, we did not use processing additives, as these are known to increase the degradation in OPVs.

Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PTB7:C71-PCBM both with and without the AgPOP LDS. For devices fabricated without the LDS, the average short-circuit current density (Jsc) was measured at 8.79 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) at 0.67 V, fill factor (FF) at 0.62, leading to a PCE of 3.66% ± 0.04%. The LDS was then applied and the short-circuit current density was measured at 9.20 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage at 0.67 V, fill factor at 0.61, leading to an increased PCE of 3.76% ± 0.02%. The Voc and FF remained unaffected; however, Jsc shows a measureable increase from 8.79 to 9.20 mA cm−2 when the LDS is applied. As this increase in PCE primarily as a result of Jsc increased, this implies that the improvement seen is as a result of increased photocurrent, arising from the LDS material. EQE measurements were performed in order to understand the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced cell efficiency. Based on the data in Fig. 3b, the presence of the AgPOP LDS provides an obvious EQE enhancement in the UV range. This enhancement is in agreement with the J–V characteristics and can be attributed to UV down-conversion, leading to an increase in visible light into the OPV active region, and thus an increase in the photocurrent.


Lifetime stability tests were carried out under continuous AM1.5 G illumination at 1 sun measured for 180 hours (Fig. 4) for non-encapsulated devices with and without AgPOP, with the temperature on the cell measured at 40 °C ± 5 °C. Overall, the device fabricated with the AgPOP LDS exhibited improved stability with the measured time to reach 20% of its initial value (t20%) recorded at 118 hours for the device with AgPOP and 82 hours for the device fabricated without AgPOP.

We observed similar degradation curves in the Voc plots for both devices (Fig. 4a) showing that decreased UV irradiation in the device with the AgPOP LDS had no impact on the Voc degradation. An exponential decrease is observed due to the rise in cell temperature which has been reported a number of times in other experimental results due to high temperature. As these stability tests were measured using a solar simulator without the control of the cell temperature, the temperature rise was 15 to 45 °C, leading to this decrease in Voc.
The Jsc (Fig. 4b) of the device with AgPOP peaks at 50 hours then decreases until 180 hours. This increase can be explained by a red-shift in the emission of the AgPOP due to the temperature increase. This leads to improved overlap of the emission of the LDS with the absorption of the active layer. However, due to poor literature we are unable to elaborate on this effect. FF (Fig. 4c) seems to be stable for both devices but the PCE (Fig. 4d) decreases reaching 15% and 3% of initial values at 180 hours for the devices with and without Ag(POP), respectively. This difference is significant in that the AgPOP not only behaves as a luminescent-down shifter but also as a UV filter.

We have described a novel Ag(I) complex with an interesting luminescent-down shifting performance and the first PTB7 inverted OPV cell made with Ag(I)-phenanthroline complex as LDS. The PTB7 was also synthesized, characterized and tested for solar cell performance. The results show that by application of an LDS material, an increase in the performance of the device containing Ag(POP), namely, an increase of 0.41 mA cm−2 in the photocurrent, an enhancement in PCE from 3.66 to 3.76%, an improvement in the UV region of the EQE.

The level of PCE increase is small and one of the primary reasons for this is the level of UV light from an AM1.5 G spectrum is low. Based on the Standard Reference Spectra are (ASTM G-173-03), UV energy accounts for only 7% of light incident from the sun (AM1.5D). As not all of the down-shifted light is directed towards the active layer, there is only likely to be a maximum of 3.5% relative increase in OPV performance. When considering the standard spectra, it worth noting that 47% of light is based in the infrared region and if this can be converted using luminescent up-shifting, a much greater increase can be achieved. However, this paper shows that an LDS can offer both a small increase the efficiency of an OPV, whilst also inhibiting degradation that arises from UV irradiation.
