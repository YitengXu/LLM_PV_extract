A dense and homogenous flat wide-bandgap (1.75 eV) CH3NH3PbI2.1Br0.9 perovskite film was prepared via a facile halide exchange route. The planar-heterojunction solar cell shows an optimal power conversion efficiency of 12.67% with negligible current hysteresis due to the film's large grains and vertically oriented grain boundaries.

Organolead trihalide perovskite-based solar cells as a new kind of photovoltaic (PV) technology have drawn exceptional attention in the past few years owing to their increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost in terms of the raw materials and device fabrication. Organolead trihalide perovskites are a key part in solar cells. Investigations have revealed their rather outstanding optical and electrical properties including high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion lengths, and ambipolar charge transport, which are vital for highly performing solar cells. Furthermore, another attractive feature is their bandgap tunability ranging from about 1.55 to 2.28 eV via appropriate halide substitutions. These properties highlight the potential applications of organolead trihalide perovskites for high-efficiency tandem solar cells in conjunction with the state-of-the-art PV technologies.

The most important aspect of designing tandem solar cells is to select light absorption materials with suitable bandgaps to optimize solar spectrum harvesting. In particular, for inexpensive two-cell tandem modules, Si or bandgap-tunable III–V semiconductors are preferred for the bottom cell, and the top-cell material should have a bandgap of 1.75–1.80 eV. Various designs have been tried, for example, by employing one-step spin-coated MAPbI2Br with a bandgap of ∼1.77 eV, Zhang et al. realized a device with a PCE of 6.64%. Wang et al. also prepared MAPbI2Br based solar cells but with TiO2/Al2O3/carbon architecture and a PCE of 11.03% was achieved. However, all these devices had mesoscopic structures, which is difficult to incorporate (especially for a top cell) into tandem devices compared with planar cell structures. Initial work mainly focused on mesoscopic devices as planar perovskite solar cells require high-quality perovskite films with uniform substrate coverage, but reported methods for realizing high-quality MAPbI3 films can not yield MAPbI3−xBrx films of similar quality. For example, Huang et al. synthesized MAPbI2.4Br0.6 films via a solvent annealing-induced interdiffusion method which gives high-quality MAPbI3 films. Yet, devices made with the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 film showed relatively low PCE, which was attributed to high trap densities due to inferior film quality. A layer of spun fullerene derivatives on the perovskite layer was required to passivate the traps and boost the device performance, which partly warps the device structure. When using MACl as a precursor to MAPbI2Br to realize a planar device, as reported by Zhu et al., the MAPbI2Br formed a nanosheet-like morphology, which contains more grain boundaries and intragranular defects. Thus, developing a facile synthetic approach for preparing high-quality MAPbI3−xBrx films with the bandgap within 1.75–1.80 eV would facilitate the development of perovskite-based tandem cells.
In this communication, we present a facile and effective halide exchange route to grow a dense and homogenous flat MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film with wide bandgap of 1.75 eV by topologically transforming an interdiffusion grown MAPbI3 film. This MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film comprises large grains and vertically oriented grain boundaries, thus significantly reducing the nonradiative recombination and improving the dissociation properties of charge carriers. Planar-heterojunction solar cells based on this high-quality wide-bandgap film show an optimal PCE of 12.67% with negligible current hysteresis, which is much better than that of the device employed interdiffusion grown MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film with the same bandgap.

Fig. 1(a) schematically shows the process for preparing MAPbI3−xBrx films via the halide exchange route. Firstly, the MAPbI3 parent film was fabricated by the solvent annealing-induced interdiffusion method. The film was then dipped into 5 mg mL−1 MABr solution in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for a fixed duration to realize halide exchange. Finally, the film was baked at 95 °C for 15 min (details can be found in ESI). We found that the absorption of the as-fabricated perovskite film shows a continuous blue shift with increasing halide exchange time (Fig. 1(b)) indicating the successful incorporation of Br into MAPbI3. The absorption blue-shift can be easily ascribed to the variation of bandgap (Eg). The corresponding Eg values were estimated using the Tauc equation, which show a logarithmic relationship with halide exchange time (Fig. 1(c)). All the above results indicate that the bandgap of MAPbI3−xBrx can be controllably tuned by varying the halide exchange time. When the halide exchange time is 120 s, a MAPbI3−xBrx film with a bandgap of 1.75 eV can be obtained, which perfectly meets the requirement for top-cell materials in tandem solar cells. Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the MAPbI3 film prepared by solvent annealing-induced interdiffusion, and the MAPbI3−xBrx film with the bandgap of 1.75 eV. It can be seen that the parent MAPbI3 film shows major diffraction peaks of an orthorhombic perovskite, which is verified by the dominant diffraction peaks at 14.08°, 28.40°, and 31.86°. For the MAPbI3−xBrx sample, all the XRD peaks shifted to larger diffraction angles, and only one single phase existed, further indicating the successful incorporation of Br into MAPbI3. Also, all the diffraction peaks match the cubic Pm3m perovskite phase, which agrees with previously reported results for MAPbI3−xBrx films with the same bandgap. Based on previously reported results on the relationship between composition of halides in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films and bandgap values, the chemical formulae of the obtained MAPbI3−xBrx film with bandgap 1.75 eV was identified to be MAPbI2.1Br0.9.
After determining the halide exchange time to realize a MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film with a suitable bandgap of 1.75 eV (hereinafter abbreviated to HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9), we further investigated the morphology of the obtained film. For comparison, we also prepared a MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film with the same bandgap via the solvent annealing-induced interdiffusion method reported by Huang et al. (hereinafter abbreviated to SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9).Fig. 2(a) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9. It can be seen that the surface is fully covered and exhibits a dense-grained uniform morphology with grain sizes ranging from 300 nm to 1 μm. In addition, large oriented-crystalline grains and vertically aligned grain boundaries were clearly identified from a typical cross-section SEM image of the film. Such film morphology is quite similar to the parent MAPbI3 film prepared by the same process, as revealed in Fig. S2 (ESI). In contrast, the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film also has full surface coverage, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Yet the film is composed of randomly accumulated nanorod-like structures, which decreases uniformity, as well as simultaneously increasing the grain boundaries and defects in the film. The morphology difference between the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film and the parent MAPbI3 film is mainly attributed to the CH3NH3Br precursor altering the nucleation kinetics of the film, which is consistent with previous reports. The surface roughness of the films was further investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as given in Fig. 2(b) and (d). From the 3D topographic images, we can see that HE-MAPbI3−xBrx has a much smoother surface compared with the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film. The calculated root mean square roughness is 18 nm for HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 and 56 nm for SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9. Therefore, the halide exchange process provides full surface coverage, large grain size, and a homogenous flat MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film with a bandgap of 1.75 eV. The film quality is far superior to those for the interdiffusion grown MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films, which weaken the nonradiative recombination of charge carriers in PV devices.

Fig. 3(a) gives the XRD patterns of HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 and SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films. It is clear that the diffraction peaks of (100) and (200) lattice planes of the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film are stronger than those of the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film, which reveals both the improvement of the film crystallinity and the growth of the grains. The normalized absorption spectra of the fabricated HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 and SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films are shown in Fig. 3(b). It can be seen that MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films obtained by the two different methods possess similar light absorption properties, with a strong absorption ranging from 400 nm to ∼710 nm. Comparable absorption intensity in 400–500 nm is observed, but the absorption of the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film is slightly higher than in the range 550 nm to 710 nm. The stronger light absorption may be related to the high film quality of the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film or the thickness difference of the films (410 ± 5 nm for HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9, 390 ± 8 nm for SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9). Fig. 3(c) gives the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples. An obvious emission peaks at around 700 nm is observed for both samples, which is consistent with their bandgap value. In addition, compared with the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film, the PL intensity decreases significantly for the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film. With the same surface coverage, the reduced PL intensity can be attributed to better electron injection into the TiO2 layer from the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film. We performed time-resolved PL decay measurements to understand the differences of charge extraction and transport in HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 and SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 3(d). The two decay curves are fitted with a two-component exponential decay function containing a fast decay and a slow decay processes. The fast decay process is generally considered to be the result of the quenching of free carriers in the MAPbI2.1Br0.9 domains through injection into TiO2, and the slow decay process to be the result of radiative recombination. As summarized in the inset of Fig. 3(d), the lifetime value of fast decay for HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 is smaller and the corresponding weight fraction of fast decay is higher than those for SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9. These results effectively confirm the excellent charge dissociation properties of the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film.
To understand the advantage of the halide exchange route, we fabricated planar-heterojunction solar cells with the device structure of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI2.1Br0.9/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD)/Ag, as schematically shown in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b) gives the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of typical devices with HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 and SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films under simulated AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which were measured at forward scan (FS, from short-circuit to open-circuit under the forward bias voltage) and reverse scan (RS, from open-circuit to short-circuit under the forward bias voltage) with a 50 ms scan delay time. Under RS, the device with SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 gave a short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE of 16.88 mA cm−2, 1.01 V, 0.52, and 9.55%, respectively. Under FS, the corresponding performance parameters were 16.89 mA cm−2, 0.98 V, 0.49, and 8.11%, respectively. These results indicate that the device with the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film has inferior performance including low PCE and serious current hysteresis. In contrast, under RS, the device with the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film showed the Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE to be 18.19 mA cm−2, 1.01 V, 0.69, and 12.67%, respectively. Under FS, the performance parameters were extremely close to those for the device under RS, indicating the negligible current hysteresis of the device with HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film. To further determine the more real PCE of the fabricated device, the photocurrent value was record as a function of time at a forward bias near its maximum output power point. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to approximately 13.30 mA cm−2 at 0.66 V for the device with the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film, yielding stabilized PCE around 8.78%. In contrast, for the device with the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film, the photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to about 15.62 mA cm−2 at 0.79 V, yielding stabilized PCE around 12.34%. Clearly, the device with the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film has superior performance compared with the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 device. The excellent PV properties of the device with the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film are largely related to the high film quality of HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9, which significantly reduces the nonradiative recombination and improves the dissociation property of charge carriers. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the fabricated devices was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the photocurrent generation started at around 710 nm, in agreement with the estimated bandgap of the MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films. The device using the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film exhibited an IPCE below 65%, yet the device with HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 gave a remarkable improvement of photocurrent over the whole region, indicating its better photoelectric conversion characteristics. All the above results indicate that the halide exchange route for realizing dense and homogenous flat MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films with a bandgap of 1.75 eV can be a facile way to fabricate large-bandgap perovskite solar cells with excellent performance, thus facilitating the development of perovskite-based tandem cells.
In summary, a facile and effective halide exchange method was presented to prepare dense and homogenous flat MAPbI2.1Br0.9 films with a wide bandgap of 1.75 eV as the light absorber layer in planar-heterojunction solar cells for tandem cell applications. Compared to the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film which had randomly accumulated nanorod-like structures, the HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film had large grains and vertically oriented grain boundaries. The planar-heterojunction solar cell based on the high-quality HE-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film shows an optimal PCE of 12.67% with negligible current hysteresis, which is much better than that of the device employed by the SA-MAPbI2.1Br0.9 film with the same bandgap.
