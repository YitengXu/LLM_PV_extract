Two donor–acceptor alternating polymers of bis(octylthio)thienyl benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTTs) and fluorinated benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (fBT) or 5-dodecylthienyl-6-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole were designed for organic photovoltaic applications. The polymers displayed strong absorptions in the range of 300–650 nm and bandgaps of ∼1.60 eV. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells of PBDTTs-fBT and (6,6)-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blends exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.27%. Experimental results and theoretical modelling were correlated to reveal the impact of substitution on fluorinated BT on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting polymers.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) adopting bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have drawn great attention due to their potential in solution-processing and fabrication of low cost, lightweight, and flexible devices. The sandwich-structured BHJ cells feature an active layer composed of polymer donor and fullerene/non-fullerene like acceptors. Dramatic progress has been made for BHJ type PSCs from the combined effort of material and device innovation. Especially in the development of new device architectures to promote the performance of devices such as inverted, ternary blended and tandem structures. The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of PSCs have been pushed from 8% to over 10% within three years. However, the design of ideal polymer donors remains a challenge to achieve both high open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factors (FF). They must possess, at least, the following characteristics, such as good solubility, a broad absorption band, and appropriate energy levels for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), because these properties are closely related to the abovementioned key parameters of BHJ solar cells.

Recently, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely explored as a donor unit in the design of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers for BHJ cells due to its lower HOMO energy level and broader UV-Vis absorption properties. The high hole mobility endowed by BDT units is also advantageous for PSCs application, as indicated by a hole mobility up to 0.81 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the single crystal transistor for BDT-based small molecules. A large spectrum of BDT donating units have been developed bearing different substituents, such as alkyl, alkylthio and alkylthienyl. In particular, the conjugated polymers based on thienyl substituted BDT have shown good potential in BHJ devices. The bis(dialkylthienyl) benzodithiophene based polymer PBDTTs-FID exhibited a PCE of 7.04% in BHJ cells.
Among the large number of acceptor (A) units explored, dithienyl-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) has attracted great attention for its energy level properties in D–A polymers. Especially the introduction of fluorine atom onto dithienyl-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), as it could increase the PCE of DTBT-based polymer solar cells. The improvement was attributed to an optimal morphology of the active layer, likely due to fluorine substitution. The impact of fluorination on BT was further elaborated by associating a BDT motif as a weak donor and 5,6-difluorinated or non-fluorinated BT groups. The introduced fluorinated side chain was found to greatly affect the morphology, processability and device efficiency due to intermolecular interactions, even though the polymers shared similar bandgaps. In light of the ever-increasing interest in developing 2-dimensional (2D) aromatic fused ring structures to fine-tune energy levels and facilitate regular π–π stacking of polymer backbones, the impact of the mono-fluorinated BT ring on optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the resultant polymers was further examined with polymers containing non-substituted or conjugated side chain substituted BT as the accepting motif.
In this study, we have designed and synthesized two new polymers by alternating mono-fluorinated benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (fBT) or dodecylthienyl substituted BT (fTBT) as acceptor units with bis(4,5-bis(octylthio)thienyl substituted BDT (BDTTs) as donor units. The BDTTs motif was chosen as a weak donor unit because bis(octylthio) possesses a strong electron-donating capacity and thienyl substitution helps to improve hole mobility, lower the HOMO level and broaden the absorption band. The thermal, optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymer were systematically studied. The best BHJ device was fabricated from PBDTTs-fBT with PC71BM as the active layer and showed a maximum PCE of 6.27%, with a Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V and a FF of 60.5%.

As shown in Scheme 1, bis(4,5-bis(octylthio)thienyl substituted BDT M1 was synthesized with a two-step protocol. The lithiation-promoted coupling between 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione 2 and 2,3-bis(octylthio)thiophene afforded 3 as a key intermediate, and its tin reagent was readily prepared to afford M1 in 85% yield. The synthesis of dodecylthienyl substituted BT (fTBT) based M2 was first explored with a three-step route, wherein Stille coupling and bromination were involved. Starting from 5-bromo-6-fluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 8, the selective Stille couplings with different thiophene tin reagents afforded 5-(5-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-6-fluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 10 with an overall yield of 32%.

With 2-D structured BDT donating monomer M1 and BT accepting monomer M2 in hand, the alternating polymer PBDTTs-fTBT (Scheme 2) was readily prepared using a palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerisation coupling at high yield (ca. 82%). The reference polymer PBDTTs-fBT, with a non-conjugated side chain substituted BT accepting motif, was also prepared in 78% yield with mono-fluorinated DTBT M3. The detailed synthesis of both 5-bromo-6-fluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 8 and M3 is described in the ESI.
The as-prepared polymers exhibited good solubility in chloroform, dichlorobenzene and toluene. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT were determined to be 12.5 kDa and 20.6 kDa, respectively (Table 1). The corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) of PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT was 3.80 and 4.25, respectively. PBDTTs-fTBT presented the highest Mn due to the existence of solubilising alkylthienyl side chains. The thermal property of the two polymers were investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown by the TGA traces in Fig. S1, good thermal stability was observed for both polymers, indicated by the high Td (temperature corresponding to 5% weight loss) of 357 °C and 372 °C for PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT, respectively. Good thermal stability endows the polymers with great potential for their application in optoelectronic devices.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in both chloroform solutions (∼10−5 M) and solid films are shown in Fig. 1a, with the wavelengths of absorption maximum (λmax) summarized in Table 1. Clearly, the polymers display similar features for absorption bands in solution and as a solid film in Fig. 2. Polymers PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT solutions in chloroform exhibit quite similar absorption profiles, wherein a strong absorption band in the range of 300–650 nm is observed with λmax peaking at 585 and 577 nm, respectively. In contrast, PBDTTs-fTBT exhibits an 8 nm blue-shifted absorption band in comparison to PBDTTs-fBT, due to the introduction of alkylthienyl into fBT. The polymer films present wide absorption bands in the range of 300–650 nm with a λmax peaking at 598 for PBDTTs-fBT and 597 nm for PBDTTs-fTBT. BDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT thus exhibited 13 nm and 20 nm red-shifted absorption bands when transferred from their solution to films, indicating strengthened conjugation in the solid state. Looking closely at the optical results of PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT, one finds that the introduction of an alklythienyl substituent to the BT core leads to a ∼10 nm blue-shifted absorption spectra, mainly due to the expanded conjugated system and the electron-donating effect of the thienyl group. In comparison to PBDTTs-fBT, PBDTTs-fTBT shows a more red-shifted absorption when transferred from solution to film, suggesting the enhanced steric hindrance over the 2D conjugated BT moiety when substituted with aromatic functionality.
The wavelength of absorption onset (λonset) of the polymer films were determined as 788 nm and 730 nm for PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT, respectively. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) can be estimated to be 1.57 and 1.69 eV for PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT (Table 1), respectively. The two polymers possess favorable absorption spectra and Eoptg, adumbrating the ordered polymer chains and densely packed side chains in solid state, which should be helpful to get higher photovoltaic results.
Electrochemical properties of the as-prepared BDT polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1b). The two polymers underwent an irreversible oxidation, similar to other BDT based D–A polymers. The onset potential for oxidation (Eoxonset) was observed to be 1.11 V and 1.08 V for PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT, respectively. With Eoxonset in hand, the HOMO levels of the two polymers could thus be calculated (Table 1). The LUMO levels of the two polymers were further calculated to be −3.94 eV for PBDTTs-fBT and −3.79 eV for PBDTTs-fTBT using the equation of LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg (eV). The result indicated the deep HOMO levels (≤−5.0 eV) of these 2D conjugated bis(alkylthio) BDTT polymers would be beneficial for obtaining a high Voc in BHJ solar cells.
Looking closer at the data for the two polymers in Table 1, the mono-fluorinated BT core with the alkylthienyl substituent proved to be less effective in lowering both LUMO and HOMO energy levels, due to the incorporated aromatic moieties decreasing the planarity to induce less effective π-electron delocalized conjugated systems. Compared with fTBT and DTBT, fBT maintained lower energy levels and a wider absorption region due to the electron-accepting nature and low steric hindrance of a single fluorine group.
To further reveal the differences between these two polymers in terms of electronic structures and HOMO/LUMO levels, the theoretical models of the two polymers were simulated. To simplify the calculation, the long alkyl or alkylthio groups were substituted by methyl or methylthio, respectively. Two repeat units of polymers were selected instead of the whole D–A polymer backbone. The optimal geometries and electronic structures of the polymers were simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.
As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMOs of all polymers are extensively delocalized and the electron density of the LUMO is mainly localized on the electron-accepting fBT or fTBT units. The energy levels of HOMO/LUMO were calculated to be −4.97/−3.06 and −4.93/−2.96 eV for PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-FTBT, resepectively. The corresponding bandgaps were calculated to be 1.91 eV and 1.87 eV for the two polymers. Although the calculated results have some differences with those obtained from CV, the HOMO trend and bandgap is consistent with experimental measurements, i.e., higher energy levels and larger bandgaps were observed for PBDTTs-fTBT due to the existance of bulky donating side-chains.
The photovoltaic potential of our as-prepared polymers were explored using a conventional single-layer device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/LiF (5 nm)/Al (or Ag) (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Blended films of polymer:PC71BM spin-coated from the different solutions with 3% DIO acted as the photoactive layers. The effect of THF annealing on the photovoltaic performance of polymer/PC71BM (1:2) solar cells was first investigated with blended films spin-coated from chloroform solutions with the addition of 3% DIO. As summarized in Table 2, PBDTTs-fBT/PC71BM (1:2) device showed the best device performance with the active layer annealed by THF vapour for 30 s. A PCE of 4.02% was obtained, with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 8.62 mA cm−2 and a FF of 51.9%. Surprisingly, THF annealing was found to result in increased FF but decreased Jsc for the devices. PBDTTs-fTBT/PC71BM (1:2) devices, however, only showed a highest PCE of 1.29% with 60 s THF annealing. However, PBDTTs-fTBT:PC71BM based solar cells exhibited higher Voc (0.94 V) but lower Jsc than PBDTTs-fBT based ones. The inverse dependence of device Voc with donor polymer's HOMO level is consistent with Thompson's findings. In this case, the less ordered, more amorphous donor materials with structures that hindered the intermolecular π–π* interactions produced lower Jsc and therefore higher Voc values. The increased hindrance with the introduction of alkylthienyl into fBT hindered the π–π* transition along the PBDTTs-fTBT main chain.

Due to the promising performance of PBDTTs-fBT/PC71BM (1:2) devices with THF annealing (30 s), further optimization included the screening of processing solvents (chlorobenzene: CB, or 1,2-dichlorobenzene: o-DCB), varying the weight ratio of polymer/PC71BM blend, and adjusting the thickness of active layers. Among the three solvents explored, PBDTTs-fBT/PC71BM devices processed from o-DCB demonstrated the best performance, with PCEs over 5% obtained at different processing conditions. The maximum PCE of 5.12% was achieved for the PBDTTs-fBT/PC71BM (1:2) device. Interestingly, without THF annealing, the devices contributed a further improved PCE of 5.29%. It is evident that different processing solvents may have varied solubility for the PBDTTs-fBT/PC71BM blend, resulting in different morphologies in the active layer, which is essential for improving the PCE of solar cells. The film thickness of the active layer on the performance of devices was also studied by increasing the rotation speed of the spin-coater. When compared with the photovoltaic performance of active layers spin-coated at 2000 rpm (5.12% PCE) to those at 1000 rpm (4.91% PCE), one can find that thicker blended films could significantly improve the FF of solar cells and therefore the photovoltaic properties of the devices.
The effect of the weight ratio of PBDTTs-fBT/PC71BM (1:1, 1:2, or 1:3) on the device performance was also investigated, with the photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2. It is evident that the optimized weight ratio of polymer:PC71BM blends varied with processing conditions. For devices processed from CB solutions with the addition of 3% DIO at 1000 rpm, PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM (1:2) devices contributed the highest PCE of 4.98%, with active layers annealed with THF for 30 s. For PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM devices processed from o-DCB + 3% DIO; however, the 1:1 weight ratio remained as optimum. Moreover, the devices that contributed a high PCE of 5.41% without THF annealing possessed a high Jsc of 11.6 mA cm−2.
To improve the performance of PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM (1:1) devices, a Ag cathode with a lower work function (WF, −4.7 eV) was used to replaced Al (WF: −4.3 eV). The devices with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM (1:1)/PFN (5 nm)/Ag were fabricated and processed from o-DCB solution with the addition of 3% DIO. Without THF annealing, these devices obtained the highest PCE of 6.27% with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 60.5% (Fig. 3). Compared with devices using the Al cathode, the devices using Ag exhibited greatly enhanced FF, thus resulting in the highest PCE. Importantly, devices with the Ag cathode were found to exhibit better stability compared to those with the Al cathode.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves of the best performing PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT devices are plotted in Fig. 4, which are also used to verify the measured Jsc values. PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM(1:1)/PFN/Ag devices processed using o-DCB + 3 vol% DIO exhibited a high photo-current response in the region of 300–750 nm. With a maximum IPCE of 60.8% peaking at 590 nm, the PBDTTs-fBT device exhibited a broad photo-response of over 55% in the range of 400–700 nm, suggesting a highly efficient photo conversion process and balanced charge transport in the devices. Although PBDTTs-fTBT:PC71BM devices presented much lower IPCE values than PBDTTs-fBT devices, broad response ranges covering 300–700 nm were obtained. The IPCE values of PBDTTs-fTBT-based devices were observed to be lower than those of PBDTTs-fBT devices, which agreed with its lower Jsc values compared to PBDTTs-fBT based devices. The Jsc of PBDTTs-fBT calculated from the integral of IPCE curves is consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves in the Fig. 3.
To obtain some insight for the high Jsc of PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM devices, the hole mobility of the blended films with a device structure of ITO (120 nm)/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM (1:2)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm) was determined using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. A hole mobility of 9.94 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained and the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (J–Veff) curve is illustrated in Fig. S2. This hole mobility is relatively high among 2D-conjugated BDT based polymers. This high hole mobility of polymer donors has significant impact on the devices’ PCE, working-life and integration.
To reveal the biggest difference in the photovoltaic properties of the two as-developed polymers, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphological properties of polymer:PC71BM (1:2) blended films spin-coated from a CB solution without THF annealing. Nanoscale phase separation was observed for both PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM (1:2) and PBDTTs-fTBT:PC71BM blend films (Fig. 5).
The relatively large (100–300 nm) globular clusters assigned to PC71BM domains were observed in PBDTTs-fTBT:PC71BM blended films, implying poor uniform distribution of PBDTTs-fTBT and PC71BM. However, the phase images of PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM films showed obscure interfaces between the two phases with uniform domain sizes for the dispersed PC71BM phase. The polymer:PC71BM blended films show a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.28 and 1.69 nm in the topography for PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT, respectively. The big difference in film morphology indicates that the PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM blend had better solubility in CB solution with 3% DIO compared to PBDTTs-fTBT:PC71BM. Importantly, under the same processing conditions, PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM blended films exhibited much improved miscibility between PBDTTs-fTBT and PC71BM, leading to the formation of a closely interpenetrating networking of fibrous phases. Obviously, the more homogenous and self-organized morphology with continuous interpenetrating network found for PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM films is attributed to the relatively higher FF and Jsc of PBDTTs-fBT based PSCs.
From the abovementioned correlation study between the optical, hole transport, morphological properties and photovoltaic performance of PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fTBT, one can find the reasons attributed to the higher PCE of PBDTTs-fBT. The main reason is ascribed to the lower Jsc of PBDTTs-fTBT/PCBM devices due to the increased hindrance of alkylthienyl into fBT, hindering the π–π* transition along the PBDTTs-fTBT main chain. Second, PBDTTs-fTBT exhibit a ∼10 nm blue-shifted absorption band compared to PBDTTs-fBT due to the expanded conjugation along the alklythienyl substituent on BT and the electron-donating effect of thienyl group. Third, according to the AFM images, PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM blended films exhibited much improved miscibility between PBDTTs-fTBT and PC71BM, leading to the formation of too closely interpenetrating networks of fibrous phases.

In conclusion, we have developed two novel polymers containing a bisalkylthio 2D-BDT donating core and a fluorinated BT (fBT or fTBT) accepting unit. The as-prepared PBDTTs-fBT and PBDTTs-fBT polymers exhibited strong absorptions in the range of 300–650 nm and bandgaps ∼1.6 eV. The structure–property correlation study reveals that substitution on the accepting moiety can fine-tune the optoelectronic properties of the polymers. The preliminary investigation on PSCs showed the highest PCE of 6.27% from PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM (1:1) blended films after screening and optimising annealing time, processing solvent and weight ratio of the active layer. The introduction of bisalkylthio to 2D-BDT endowed all polymers with high Voc (0.85–0.94 V). Moreover, polymers with alkythienyl substituted fBT exhibited low Jsc and FF due to the hindrance of the substituent. Our results show that the bisalkylthio 2D-BDT unit and fBT unit were good choices for constructing high photovoltaic D–A polymers. The present study provides an insight on the structure–property relationship of 2D-BDT based conjugated polymers and opens an avenue to develop a new library of fluorinated BT based polymers with high structural diversity for optoelectronic applications.

The reaction was then heated at 50 °C for 3 h. Compound 2 (0.8 g, 3.63 mmol) was rapidly added and the reaction was stirred for 2 h at 50 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was added Sn2Cl·2H2O (0.688 g, 3.63 mmol) in 20 mL HCl (10%) and stirred for another 2 h. Finally, the mixture was poured into ice water (100 mL) and extracted with ether. The combined organic phase was washed with water and brine before drying over anhydrous Mg2SO4 and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography with hexane/dichloromethane (10:1 v/v) as the eluent to afford the title compound 3 as a light yellow solid (2.19 g, 65%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 7.65 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.51 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.37 (s, 2H), 2.97 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 8H), 1.74 (dd, J = 21.9, 7.3 Hz, 8H), 1.58 (s, 8H), 1.52–1.40 (m, 8H), 1.40–1.18 (m, 36H), 0.92–0.84 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 140. 49, 138.96, 136.77, 136.41, 133.23, 130.24, 128.08, 123.36, 123.03, 37.55, 34.93, 31.83, 29.72, 29.39, 29.20, 28.81, 28.64, 22.66, 14.11.


Compound 3 (1.86 g, 2.00 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (50 mL) and purged with nitrogen for 15 min. The mixture was cooled to −78 °C and n-BuLi (1.83 mL, 2.4 M in hexane) was added. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. After cooling again to −78 °C, the reaction mixture was added with trimethyltin chloride (4.79 mL, 1 M).

The D–A polymers were synthesized via Still-coupling reaction. Typically, to a Schlenk tube was added with M1 (0.2 mmol), M2 or M3 (0.2 mmol), dry toluene (9 mL) and dimethylformamide (1 mL). After purging the mixture with N2 for 0.5 h, Pd2(dba)3 (17.0 mg, 0.01 mmol, 5%) and P(o-tolyl)3 (12.1 mg, 0.04 mmol, 20%) were added quickly under N2 flow. The reaction mixture was heated at 105 °C for 48 h. Then, 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (0.1 mL) and 2-bromothiophene (0.1 mL) were added at an interval of 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL) and filtered. The collected precipitate was Soxhlet-extracted with methanol, acetone and hexane for 12 h each. The residue was washed with chloroform for 24 h. The chloroform fraction was concentrated. The final product was re-precipitated from methanol and dried in vacuo. The yield and 13C NMR results of the two polymers are listed as follows:


PBDTTs-fBT: purple black solid (195 mg, 78%). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 140.09, 139.50, 139.26, 138.30, 137.04, 136.89, 133.53, 130.04, 33.69, 35.02, 31.86, 29.70, 29.28, 28.91, 22.67, 14.10.

PBDTTs-fTBT: purple black solid (246 mg, 82%). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 140.24, 137.32, 136.95, 133.58, 130.32, 124.57, 37.90, 37.68, 35.01, 31.91, 31.84, 29.68, 29.33, 22.67, 14.10.

PSCs devices were prepared with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (1:1, 1:2, or 1:3, w/w)/PFN(5 nm)/Al (or Ag). The device fabrication was carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box. First, indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were sonicated consecutively in deionized water, acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol. Then, the thin film (40 nm in thickness) of PEDOT/PSS was spin-coated on ITO glass substrates before baking at 150 °C for 10 min in air. Polymer:PC71BM blends as active layers were then spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT/PSS layer from their solutions (concentration, 8 mg ml−1) in chloroform (CB or o-DCB) with 3% DIO at 1000 (or 2000) rpm for 2 min. The spin-coated glass was annealed at 80 °C for 0 (or 30, 60) s. The interlayer material PFN (5 nm) was then deposited under high vacuum. Finally, the Al (or Ag) layer was evaporated onto the blended films using a shadow mask under 1 × 10−4 Pa to define the active area of the devices as ∼0.16 cm2, which became a top anode to complete the device fabrication. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS was determined by a surface profiler (Dektak 150, Veeco), whereas the thickness of PFN (or LiF) was monitored by a gold crystal oscillator. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and PCE were determined using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under 1 sun of simulated air mass 1.5 G solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel model 91192) at room temperature. The intensity of solar simulator illumination was calibrated by monocrystalline silicon reference cells (Hamamatsu S1133, with KG-5 visible color filter), and determined by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The hole mobility of the PBDTTs-fBT:PC71BM(1:2) blended film was measured by the SCLC method. The morphology of the active layers was observed with AFM on a multimode Nanoscope IIIa instrument.
