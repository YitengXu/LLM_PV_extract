A new alternating polymer P(BDTSi–DFBT), poly(4,8-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole), was prepared via Stille polymerization. The determined absorption maximum and optical band-gap (Eg) of P(BDTSi–DFBT) were 590 nm and 1.74 eV, respectively. The calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of P(BDTSi–DFBT) were −5.45 eV and −3.71 eV, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that P(BDTSi–DFBT) is a crystalline polymer. The binary-polymer solar cells, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO/Al, made from P(BDTSi–DFBT) gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.02% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.68 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 53%. Conversely, the ternary-polymer solar cells, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (0.8:0.2:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO/Al, made with a synthesized medium band-gap P(BDTSi–DFBT) and low band-gap PTB7-Th, offered a maximum PCE of 10.05%, with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71%.

Organic solar cells (OSCs), fabricated via solution-processed printing techniques using a blend of electron-donating polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives or π-conjugated organic small molecules have attracted great interest as promising low-cost, lightweight, and large-area devices on flexible substrates for solar-to-electrical energy conversion. The conventional binary-polymer solar cells (PSCs) made from polymer and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) offered a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼11%. On the other hand, ternary-PSCs, made from a wide- or medium band-gap polymer 1, a low band-gap polymer 2, and PC70BM, gave an improved PCE of ∼12%. Recently, OSCs made by using a blend of polymer and π-conjugated organic small molecules have also displayed an impressive PCE of over ∼13%. It is well documented that the properties of the π-conjugated material used on the photoactive layer of solar cell devices (PSCs and OSCs) are crucial determining factors of the device performance. Therefore, a new efficient π-conjugated material, such as electron-donating polymers and electron-accepting organic small molecules, is required to further enhance the performance of PSC and OSC devices. We have been interested in preparing a new polymeric donor material, because an efficient polymeric material is required for all three types of solar cells mentioned above.

The literature suggests that the electron-deficient benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) derivatives are promising building blocks to prepare efficient polymeric donor materials for solar cell applications. The broad absorption in the entire visible part of the solar spectrum and the relatively high PCE achieved for BT-based polymers have motivated researchers to tune the photo-physical properties of BT-based polymers via side or main chain engineering. Consequently, various electron donor and acceptor units were inserted into the BT backbone. Interestingly, the substituents on the 5 and 6th positions of BT and the 4th position of the thiophene attached to BT greatly alter the properties and photovoltaic performance of the resulting BT-based polymers. Among them, the fluoro substituent is found to be the best choice for the 5 and 6th positions of BT, and alkyl groups are more suitable for the 4th position of the thiophene attached to BT to obtain high energy converting BT-based polymers. Consequently, we chose 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DFBT) as an electron accepting unit to prepare new donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers for PSCs. Several studies have shown that the DFBT-based polymers offer a maximum PCE of over 10% in binary-PSCs.Fig. 1a shows the different positions of the BT derivatives for an easy and clear understanding.
On the other hand, the rigid and planar structured benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is an efficient electron rich unit used to prepare high energy converting D–A polymers. Many D–A polymers incorporating BDT and DFBT units have been reported for PSCs. These careful studies suggest that the substituents on the 4th and 8th position of the BDT unit significantly affect the properties of the resulting polymers. The 4- and 8-positions of the BDT unit are also shown in Fig. 1a. For example, the 4,8-alkoxy-substituted BDT unit offered a relatively low band-gap and a highly crystalline polymer when it was copolymerized with the DFBT derivative compared to that of the 4,8-thienyl-substituted BDT unit. As a result, a large difference was observed in their photovoltaic performances. The chemical structure of the respective DFBT-based polymers P(BDT–DFBT) and P(BDTT–DFBT) are shown in Fig. 1b.
It is widely known that the bulky triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) on acene derivatives improves the solubility, oxidative stability, and crystallinity of π-conjugated materials, as well as the π-orbital overlap between π-conjugated molecules. Consequently, the 4,8-triisopropylsilylethynyl-substituted BDT (BDTSi) derivative was copolymerized with a variety of electron-deficient units, such as benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (BO), diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP), quinoxaline (QX), benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTz), thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT), and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) derivatives, and explored in PSCs. However, the combination of BDTSi and DFBT has not yet been studied, though DFBT is a more promising acceptor unit than the above-mentioned acceptor units. Here, we report the synthesis, optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the new polymer, P(BDTSi–DFBT), containing BDTSi and DFBT.

We obtained the required chemicals and reagents from Sigma-Aldrich. A Varian Mercury Plus spectrometer (300 MHz) was used for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on the Agilent 1200 Infinity Series separation module. The JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer and a CH Instruments Electrochemical analyzer were used to obtain the absorption spectrum and cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the polymer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses were performed on an XPert-MPD (Philips, Netherland) with a sealed proportional counter and an X'celerator PSD for the high speed data collection detector. The XRD and SAXS instruments were calibrated using a standard silicon crystal. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of the wavelength in the wavelength range of 300 to 1000 nm using a xenon lamp as the light source, and the calibration was performed by using a silicon reference cell. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed using Seiko instruments SPI 3800N-SPA 400 and Hitachi H-7500, respectively.


The PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM/Al. The pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate was dried overnight in an oven. A 40 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-cast from an aqueous solution onto an ITO-coated glass substrate. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the photoactive layer. A solution containing a mixture of P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) in chlorobenzene (CB):1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) at a volumetric ratio of 97:3 (CB:DIO) was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer. The film was then dried for 30 min at RT in a glove box. Subsequently, an aluminum (Al, 100 nm) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of approximately 3 × 10−6 Torr. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSC devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The solar cell performance was determined using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) using a Peccell (PEC-L01) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated by comparing the solar simulator spectrum with the AM 1.5 spectrum at RT.


A solution of BDTSi (0.26 g, 0.30 mmol) and DFBT (0.22 g, 0.30 mmol) in chlorobenzene (15 mL) was purged well with argon for 20 min. Pd2(dba)3 (7 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (15 mg) were then added in one portion. The entire mixture was stirred and refluxed for 18 h under an argon atmosphere. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to RT and then added dropwise into vigorously stirred methanol (200 mL). The precipitates were recovered by filtration, and the crude polymer was extracted with methanol and acetone for 24 h with a Soxhlet apparatus. The pure polymer P(BDTSi–DFBT) was obtained as a deep blue solid. Yield (0.30 g, 91%). Anal. calc. for C62H82F2N2S5Si2: C, 67.10; H, 7.45; N, 2.52; S, 14.45. Found: C, 66.21; H, 6.87; N, 2.12; S, 13.93.


The monomers, 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTSi) and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DFBT), were prepared as shown in Scheme 1. The Stille copolymerization between BDTSi and DFBT using the procedure described in the Experimental section resulted in the new polymer P(BDTSi–DFBT). The synthetic route for the synthesis of P(BDTSi–DFBT) is outlined in Scheme 1. Polymer P(BDTSi–DFBT) exhibited excellent solubility in most common chlorinated organic solvents like chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and dichlorobenzene (DCB). The determined weight average molecular weight (Mw), number average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity for P(BDTSi–DFBT) were 4.30 × 104 g mol−1, 2.22 × 104 g mol−1 and 1.93, respectively.



Fig. 2a presents the absorption spectra of P(BDTSi–DFBT) solution in CB together with its thin film. As shown in Fig. 2a, the polymer P(BDTSi–DFBT) in solution and the film state exhibited a broad absorption band between 300–700 nm, with the maximum absorption at 586 nm and 595 nm, respectively. We could not see any big difference in the absorption spectra of P(BDTSi–DFBT) except for the shoulder peak at 650 nm. The relatively increased shoulder peak in the film suggests that the inter-chain interactions between the P(BDTSi–DFBT) chains are comparatively better in film than solution. The calculated optical band gap (Eg) is 1.74 eV. It is worth noting that P(BDTSi–DFBT) exhibited a slightly higher band-gap and blue-shifted absorption maximum compared to that of the structurally similar DFBT-based polymers, P(BDT–DFBT) and P(BDTT–DFBT), which contain 4,8-alkoxy or thienyl-substituted BDT units. Cyclic voltammetry analysis was performed with P(BDTSi–DFBT) and the corresponding cyclic voltammogram (CV) is shown in Fig. 2b. The estimated onset oxidation potential (Eox,onset) values for P(BDTSi–DFBT) and standard ferrocene were 1.17 V and 0.52 V, respectively. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energy levels of P(BDTSi–DFBT) were calculated using the following standard equations: EHOMO = [−(Eox,onsetvs.Ag/AgCl − Eferrocenevs.Ag/AgCl) − 4.8] eV and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of P(BDTSi–DFBT) were −5.45 eV and −3.71 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the HOMO level of P(BDTSi–DFBT) was found to be deeper (0.12–0.14 eV) than that of P(BDT–DFBT) and P(BDTT–DFBT) (HOMO ≈ −5.31 eV and −5.33 eV). A deeper HOMO level is favorable to get a higher Voc when the respective material is used as an electron material in PSCs.


The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses were performed with P(BDTSi–DFBT) to study the nature of P(BDTSi–DFBT). The XRD and SAXS patterns of P(BDTSi–DFBT) are shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the XRD pattern for P(BDTSi–DFBT) exhibited several peaks at 2θ ≈ 14.18°, 18.02°, 24.17° and 39.14°, as well as in the SAXS pattern at 2θ ≈ 3.75° and 5.45°. The presence of these peaks confirms that P(BDTSi–DFBT) is a crystalline polymer. It is worth noting that the DFBT-based polymers, P(BDT–DFBT) and P(BDTT–DFBT), incorporating alkoxy- or thienyl-substituted BDT units, showed only two peaks at 2θ ≈ 4° and 24° in their XRD pattern; on the other hand, P(BDTSi–DFBT) displayed several peaks. These results proved that triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents significantly alter the crystallinity of the resulting polymer compared to that of the frequently used alkoxy and thienyl substituents. The calculated in-plane spacing between polymer backbones (d1 and d2-spacings) of P(BDTSi–DFBT) is 23.54 Å and 16.20 Å. In contrast, the estimated p-stacking distances, d3–d6-spacings, for P(BDTSi–DFBT) are 6.24 Å, 4.92 Å, 3.68 Å and 2.30 Å.



Fig. 4. shows the PSC device structure (a), the energy level diagram (b), the current–voltage (J–V) curves (c) and the incident photon to the current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (d) of the PSCs prepared by using a P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blend. The device made with 3 vol% DIO displayed an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.02% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.68 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 53% compared to that of the device made without additives (PCE ≈ 1.01%, Voc ≈ 0.68 V, Jsc ≈ 4.58 mA cm−2, and FF ≈ 32%). As seen in Fig. 4d, both devices made with and without 3 vol% DIO showed quite a broad IPCE response from 300 nm to 720 nm. However, the maximum IPCE values significantly increased when the device was processed with DIO. The IPCE responses for the device made without any additives were over 20% in the range of 350–620 nm, with a maximum IPCE of 27% at 410 nm, while the device made with 3 vol% DIO showed an increased IPCE maximum of 67% at 410 nm, with the responses found to be over 50% in the range of 360–650 nm.

The dissimilar performances of the PSC devices are attributed to the difference in the surface morphology of their photoactive layers. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the films processed using the P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blend with and without 3 vol% DIO are shown in Fig. 5. The films processed without additives showed a uniform size of cluster formation between the polymer and PC70BM. However, the cluster formation was significantly decreased with the use of 3 vol% DIO. The root mean square (RMS) values of the films made with and without 3 vol% DIO were found to be quite similar. The 3D topology images reveal that the grain size notably altered when the film was processed under different conditions, such as with and without 3 vol% DIO. Overall, the film processed with DIO shows better morphology for efficient carrier transport than the film processed without DIO. We think that the high crystalline nature of P(BDTSi–DFBT) could be a possible reason for the high roughness obtained. The TEM images presented in Fig. 5 firmly support our argument. The dark color observed on the TEM image arises from PC70BM and the white color is related to P(BDTSi–DFBT). In this instance, the PC70BM aggregation was clearly observed for the film made without DIO and a much-improved nanoscale network between P(BDTSi–DFBT) and PC70BM was observed for the film made with 3 vol% DIO.
The overall PCE for P(BDTSi–DFBT) is comparable with that of P(BDTT–DFBT) but lower than that of P(BDT–DFBT). The maximum PCE reported for P(BDTT–DFBT) and P(BDT–DFBT) was 4.46% (Voc ≈ 0.68 V, Jsc ≈ 11.87 mA cm−2, and FF ≈ 55%) and 8.30% (Voc ≈ 0.78 V, Jsc ≈ 15.38 mA cm−2, and FF ≈ 69%), respectively. The P(BDTSi–DFBT)-based device showed reasonable Voc values compared to those of the P(BDT–DFBT)- and P(BDTT–DFBT)-based devices. However, the lower Jsc and FF limit on the P(BDTSi–DFBT)-based device resulted in a performance within 5.1%. The device made with a lower concentration of P(BDTSi–DFBT) gave a relatively higher FF (≈58%) but the Jsc value was significantly lower (∼8.50 mA cm−2) and consequently, there was no improvement in the PCE. We think that the blue-shifted absorption and the relatively high RMS value might be the reasons for the moderate performance of P(BDTSi–DFBT). Nevertheless, the photovoltaic parameters obtained for P(BDTSi–DFBT) are quite similar to those of the DFBT-based polymers incorporating 2D π-conjugated BDT units.

The high crystallinity of P(BDTSi–DFBT) allows its application as a co-absorber along with the low band-gap PTB7-Th in ternary-PSCs. A recent study suggests that the addition of the highly crystalline π-conjugated small molecule p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 to the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blend resulted in an improvement of the absorption, crystallinity and the face-on orientation of the ternary blend. Consequently, the Jsc and FF of ternary-PSCs are considerably enhanced, and the overall performance of ternary-PSCs greatly increased compared to binary-PSCs made from p-DTS(FBTTH2)2:PC70BM and PTB7-Th:PC70BM blends. In this instance, the use of crystalline P(BDTSi–DFBT) along with the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blends is also expected to improve the PCE of binary-PSCs prepared from the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blend. The chemical structure (a), the energy level diagram for the materials used for ternary PSC fabrication (b), and normalized absorption spectra of P(BDTSi–DFBT) and PTB7-Th (c), and the J–V curves (d) and IPCE spectra (e) of the ternary PSCs prepared using PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (at various ratio) + 3 vol% DIO blends are shown in Fig. 6.

As indicated in Fig. 6c, the polymers P(BDTSi–DFBT) and PTB7-Th showed better complementary absorption between 300 and 800 nm. In addition, the HOMO levels of P(BDTSi–DFBT) and PTB7-Th (see Fig. 6b) are found to be similar and therefore expected to have better charge transport in the ternary systems. A recent study indicated that the matched HOMO levels of the two donor polymers are favorable to get a high FF, via the improved carrier mobility, and PCE for ternary-PSCs. Consequently, combined effects such as improved absorption via complementary absorption, and high carrier mobility via the improved crystallinity, are expected for the ternary-PSCs made from the PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM blend. The photovoltaic parameters obtained for the ternary-PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The ternary-PSC made with the 0.8:0.2:1.5 wt% blend offered a maximum PCE of 10.05% with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71%. The overall PCE of ternary-PSCs is 20% higher than that of the binary-PSCs (PCE ≈ 8.49%, Voc ≈ 0.76 V, Jsc ≈ 16.43 mA cm−2, and FF ≈ 68%) made from the PTB7-Th:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO blend. Interestingly, all three parameters such as Voc, Jsc, and FF notably improved when P(BDTSi–DFBT) is added to the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blend.

XRD and SAXS analyses were performed for the polymer films prepared using a chloroform (5 mg/0.5 mL) solution containing PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT) (0.8:0.2 wt%) and P(BDTSi–DFBT) with the aim of studying the variation in the crystallinity of the ternary blend films compared to their corresponding binary blend films. The corresponding XRD and SAXS (insert) patterns are shown in Fig. 7. The comparison suggests that P(BDTSi–DFBT) is highly crystalline compared to PTB7-Th. It is very clear that the intensities of the peaks (at 2θ ≈ 24°, 18° and 14°) are considerably increased for the film made using the PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT) blend compared to the film made only from PTB7-Th. Also, a sharp characteristic peak at 2θ ≈ 18°, which comes from P(BDTSi–DFBT), is observed for the film made from the PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT) blend. The SAXS patterns for the polymer films also exhibit a similar trend. High-intensity peaks for the film made from the PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT) blend compared to the film made using only PTB7-Th were observed with XRD. Overall, the crystallinity of PTB7-Th is found to be notably improved with the addition of P(BDTSi–DFBT), which is expected to be favorable to acquire better photovoltaic performances.
To get insight into the morphological modifications of the films processed from ternary blends compared to that of the films made from binary blends, we examined the surface morphology of the films made from PTB7-Th:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO and PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (08:0.2:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO blends using AFM and TEM. The corresponding AFM and TEM images of these films are shown in Fig. 8. The AFM images suggest that the morphology of the films processed with binary and ternary blends are very similar. No notable changes are observed in the AFM images. However, the surface roughness of the film processed with the ternary blend is slightly higher than that of the film prepared using a binary blend. Sometimes, higher roughness is favorable to get a better charge collection via an improved contact between the active layer and electrode. According to the TEM images shown in Fig. 8, the nanoscale network between the ternary blend (PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM) is found to be better than the network between their corresponding binary blend (PTB7-Th:PC70BM). As seen in the figure, the dark areas, which refer to PC70BM, are somewhat visible for the film made using the PTB7-Th:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO blend, but the visibility of the dark areas is much lower for the film made from the PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (08:0.2:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% DIO blend. Overall, we think that the inclusion of the crystalline P(BDTSi–DFBT) in the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blend improves the morphology, which is favorable for better charge transport. Consequently, the improved crystallinity and morphology of ternary blends offer enhanced photovoltaic performance compared to binary blends.

The Stille polymerization of the di-stannyl derivative of 4,8-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and the di-bromo derivative of 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole resulted in a new polymer P(BDTSi–DFBT). The estimated Eg, and HOMO and LUMO levels of P(BDTSi–DFBT) are 1.74 eV, −5.45 eV and −3.71 eV, respectively. Several peaks appear in the XRD and SAXS patterns of P(BDTSi–DFBT) indicating that it is a crystalline polymer. The binary-PSCs made with the P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + 3 vol% blend offered a PCE of 5.02% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 11.68 mA cm−2 and a FF of 53%. However, the ternary-PSCs made with a blend of PTB7-Th:P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM (0.8:0.2:1.5 wt%) gave a maximum PCE of 10.05% with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 17.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71%. This study confirms that the crystallinity of the benzodithiophene–benzothiadiazole copolymer is greatly improved by inserting the triisopropylsilylethynyl group on the 4- and 8-position of the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit. The high crystallinity of P(BDTSi–DFBT) was found to increase the surface roughness of the film made with the P(BDTSi–DFBT):PC70BM blend via solution processing. Consequently, P(BDTSi–DFBT) exhibited moderate photovoltaic performance in binary-PSCs. However, the inclusion of crystalline P(BDTSi–DFBT) in the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blend was found to significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of the resulting ternary-PSCs.
