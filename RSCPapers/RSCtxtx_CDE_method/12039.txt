Two new non-fullerene (NF) acceptors, namely BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M, were rationally designed to optimize the energy levels and optical bandgap. BDTIT-M is derived by changing the end-group of NFBDT into slightly weak DCI-M, and BDTThIT-M is obtained by adding two conjugated thiophene side-chains into a ladder-type core of BDTIT-M. By incorporating with the polymer donor PBDB-T, BDTIT-M based organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a higher PCE of 11.31% compared to that of NFBDT based cells, which is mainly attributed to the increased VOC and FF. A higher PCE of 12.12% with a small energy loss of ∼0.588 eV is achieved compared with BDTThIT-M based OSCs, benefiting from the elevated LUMO level, narrowed bandgap, and enhanced absorption coefficient and electron mobility of BDTThIT-M compared with BDTIT-M. The combination of a methyl-modified end-group and conjugated side-chain should be an efficient strategy to elevate the LUMO and HOMO levels with different amplitudes for realizing simultaneous improvement in VOC and JSC.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) as a promising renewable energy technology have aroused widespread attention due to their unique merits of low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and multitudinous raw materials. It is well known that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is proportional to product of the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). Since VOC is lower than the optical bandgap divided by electron charge (q) due to the inevitable energy loss (Eloss) during excited state relaxation, exciton dissociation and charge recombination. Generally, JSC improvement is always accompanied by a sacrifice of VOC by extending photon harvesting in a long wavelength range. Intensive efforts have been devoted to minimize Eloss to achieve the best possible trade-off between JSC and VOC for efficient PCE. The Eloss is usually defined as Eloss = Eg − qVOC, where Eg is the lowest optical bandgap among the used donor and acceptor components. Over the past two decades, fullerenes and their derivatives as the commonly used electron acceptors have achieved considerable progress, while the Eloss is still much larger than that of state-of-the-art c-Si or perovskite solar cells (0.40–0.55 eV). Yan and coworkers reported a PCE of 11.7% for fullerene based OSCs with an Eloss of ∼0.816 eV. There is plenty of room for PCE improvement if Eloss can be efficiently reduced. Compared with fullerene acceptors, non-fullerene (NF) acceptors exhibit facile energy level modulation, high photochemical stability and strong photon harvesting in the visible light range. It is encouraging that NF based OSCs generally show relatively small Eloss compared with fullerene based OSCs, exhibiting rapid development with PCEs exceeding 12%. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of NF acceptors can be finely adjusted to simultaneously improve VOC and JSC, while achieving a small Eloss by matching the energy levels of the donor and acceptor, as well as optimizing phase separation.

Recently, Chen and coworkers reported a novel NF acceptor (NFBDT) based on a heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) unit, which has a narrower Eg relative to the famous NF acceptor ITIC, leading to a red-shifted photon harvesting range. Employing poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) as the donor, NFBDT based OSCs achieved a higher JSC than that of ITIC based cells, while VOC was dramatically decreased due to the reduced LUMO level. Inspired by the NF acceptor IT-M, a derivative of ITIC, the end-group of NFBDT is replaced by methyl substituted 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCI-M) to synthesize BDTIT-M. The BDTIT-M based OSCs achieved a higher PCE of 11.31% than that of their counterpart NFBDT based OSCs, which is mainly attributed to the increased VOC and FF. It is highlighted that BDTIT-M based OSCs exhibit the smallest Eloss of 0.647 eV among the OSCs with PBDB-T as the donor and different acceptors, ITIC (0.691 eV), IT-M (0.660 eV), and NFBDT (0.672 eV). It is well known that the incorporation of 2D-conjugated side-chains into benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based polymer donors can effectively regulate absorption, HOMO/LUMO levels and the molecular π–π stacking degree. Two conjugated thiophene side-chains were incorporated into BDTIT-M to form BDTThIT-M, resulting in an elevated LUMO level and slightly reduced Eg relative to BDTIT-M. The BDTThIT-M based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 12.12% with a small Eloss of ∼0.588 eV and FF of 0.714, which should be a case in point for exhibiting PCEs beyond 12% with an Eloss less than 0.6 eV.

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic procedures of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M NF acceptors. BDTThIT-M is derived from BDTIT-M by adding two conjugated thiophene side-chains into the donor core of BDTIT-M. The detailed synthetic processes are shown in the ESI. The Stille coupling reaction between compound 1a (or 1b) and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate was conducted to form compound 2a (or 2b). Then, compound 2a (or 2b) went through a double nucleophilic addition reaction, and the double hydroxyl intermediate without further purification was subjected to an acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction to receive the donor core (compound 3a or 3b). Two formyl groups were introduced (compound 4a or 4b) and finally were end-capped with DCI-M to gain BDTThIT-M and BDTIT-M. The two NF acceptors exhibit excellent solubility in commonly used solvents, ensuring the essential requirements of solution-processed OSCs.
The molecular structures of the two acceptors and polymer donor PBDB-T are displayed in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectra of neat BDTIT-M, BDTThIT-M and PBDB-T films as well as the absorption coefficient of acceptors in dilute chloroform solution are presented in Fig. 1b. The two NF acceptors have complementary absorption with the donor PBDB-T. BDTIT-M in solution shows an absorption peak at 700 nm with an absorption coefficient of 1.79 × 105 M−1 cm−1. BDTThIT-M in solution exhibits a slight red-shifted absorption peak at 710 nm with an enhanced absorption coefficient of 2.57 × 105 M−1 cm−1 compared with BDTIT-M. The absorption peak of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M in the film state is red-shifted to 730 nm and 738 nm compared with that in the solution state due to the intensive intermolecular π–π stacking. The Eg of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M is about 1.55 eV and 1.53 eV according to the absorption onset of neat films. The electrochemical properties of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M were investigated by the cyclic voltammetry method (Fig. S1). The LUMO levels of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M can be estimated from the reduction potentials and HOMO levels can be calculated according to EHOMO = ELUMO − Eg. The LUMO (−3.82 eV) and HOMO (−5.35 eV) levels of BDTThIT-M are slightly higher than the LUMO (−3.85 eV) and HOMO (−5.40 eV) of BDTIT-M, which could be attributed to the electron-donating nature of the conjugated thiophene side chain. The measured results are consistent with the calculated results of density functional theory (DFT). As revealed in DFT calculation (Fig. S2), two conjugated thiophene side-chains of BDTThIT-M are almost perpendicular to the molecular plane, which slightly affects the distribution of frontier molecular orbitals. The σ-inductive interaction between thiophene and the BDTThIT-M backbone is stronger than that of hydrogen, resulting in elevated LUMO and HOMO levels with different amplitudes and a slightly narrowed bandgap. The electron mobility of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method based on the electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al (Fig. S3). The electron mobility (∼2.13 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of BDTThIT-M is slightly higher than that (∼1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of BDTIT-M, suggesting the enhanced π–π stacking of BDTThIT-M due to the conjugated thiophene side-chains. Based on the above experimental results, the optical, electrochemical parameters and electron mobility of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M are summarized in Table 1. A series of OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al were fabricated with PBDB-T as the donor (D) and BDTIT-M or BDTThIT-M as the acceptor (A), the energy levels of the used materials are shown in Fig. 1c. The parameters of the D:A doping ratio, the DIO additive and annealing treatments were optimized to obtain highly efficient OSCs. The detailed experimental results of OSCs under different optimized conditions are illustrated in Fig. S4 and Table S1. The optimized experimental conditions are the D:A doping ratio of 1:1 (wt/wt), with 0.75 vol% DIO additive and the active layers with annealing treatment at 100 °C for 5 min.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs with BDTIT-M or BDTThIT-M as the acceptor were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 2a. The key photovoltaic parameters of our OSCs and NFBDT based OSCs reported by Chen's group are summarized in Table 2. The BDTIT-M based OSCs achieved a PCE of 11.31%, with a VOC of 0.903 V, a JSC of 17.56 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.713. For BDTThIT-M based OSCs, the PCE reached 12.12% with a higher VOC of 0.942 V, a higher JSC of 18.03 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.714. The increased VOCs are mainly attributed to the elevated LUMO levels of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M compared with that of NFBDT. The increased JSC should be attributed to the red-shifted absorption peak and the enhanced absorption coefficient of BDTThIT-M. The FFs of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M based OSCs are larger than 71%, suggesting the ideal phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport and collection. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M based OSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE values of BDTThIT-M based OSCs are slightly higher than those of BDTIT-M based OSCs in the spectral range from 700 nm to 800 nm, which can be well explained using the absorption spectra of PBDB-T:BDTThIT-M and PBDB-T:BDTIT-M blend films (Fig. S5). Meanwhile, the EQE values of BDTThIT-M-based OSCs are slightly higher than those of BDTIT-M based OSCs in the spectral range from 450 to 650 nm, which corresponds to the strong photon harvesting range of PBDB-T. This means that the utilization efficiency of excitons on PBDB-T in OSCs with BDTThIT-M as the electron acceptor is larger than that in OSCs with BDTIT-M as the electron acceptor, which can be demonstrated by the relatively large exciton dissociation charge collection efficiencies. By integrating the EQE spectra of the corresponding OSCs, the calculated JSCs are 17.03 mA cm−2 and 17.57 mA cm−2 for BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M based OSCs, respectively. The calculated JSCs are slightly less than the measured JSCs with errors less than 3%, which are mainly ascribed to the performance decay of cells without encapsulation for EQE measurements.

To exhibit the repeatability of this experiment, the PCE distribution histogram of two kinds of OSCs was accounted according to 50 samples prepared from different batches, as described in Fig. 2c. The average PCEs of BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M based OSCs are approximately 11.00% and 11.87%, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the 100 OSCs are shown in Fig. S6. The photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of the optimized OSCs were investigated, as shown in Fig. 2d. The key parameters extracted from Jph–Veff curves are listed in Table 3. Here, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under AM 1.5 G light illumination and JD is the current density under dark conditions. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage for Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. It is generally assumed that all photogenerated excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers and efficiently collected by individual electrodes at high Veff. The saturated current density (Jsat) should be mainly determined by the maximal exciton generation rate (Gmax). As a result, Jsat = qLGmax, where L is the thickness of the active layer. The Gmax value of 1.19 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for BDTThIT-M based OSCs is higher than 1.16 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for BDTIT-M based OSCs, which can be well explained by the absorption spectra of blend films (Fig. S5). It is evidently observed that Jph rapidly approaches the saturated state at a relatively low Veff (∼0.5 V) for the two kinds of OSCs, suggesting efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport and collection. The probability of exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection can be estimated by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively. Under short circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat value of 94.65% for BDTThIT-M based OSCs is slightly higher than that of 94.11% for BDTIT-M based OSCs. Under maximal power output conditions, the Jph/Jsat value of 82.46% for BDTThIT-M based OSCs is also higher than that of 81.62% for BDTIT-M based OSCs. The relatively large exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection efficiencies in BDTThIT-M based OSCs can well explain the high EQE values in the spectral range from 450 nm to 650 nm. The charge mobility in the blend films were measured by the SCLC method (Fig. S7 and Table S2). A balanced charge carrier mobility can be obtained in both kinds of OSCs with relatively high FF values, which can be further confirmed from the small series resistance and large shunt resistance of the corresponding OSCs.

It is well known that the morphological features of blend films strongly influence the performance of OSCs. The morphologies of the active layers were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 3. It is apparent that both kinds of blend films exhibit a quite uniform and smooth surface. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of PBDB-T:BDTIT-M and PBDB-T:BDTThIT-M blend films are approximately 2.05 nm and 2.51 nm (Fig. 3a and b), respectively. The fibrous features can be clearly observed from the corresponding phase images, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The distinctive flocculent and fibrillar structure can also be seen from the TEM images of PBDB-T:BDTIT-M and PBDB-T:BDTThIT-M blend films (Fig. 3e and f), respectively. The bi-continuous interpenetrating network structure is well developed in the two kinds of blend films, which is beneficial to improve exciton dissociation and charge transport for achieving high JSC and FF. Meanwhile, charge recombination can be efficiently decreased in the optimized active layers for obtaining less Eloss. In fact, the Eloss in OSCs should include three kinds of losses, including intramolecular Eloss due to the relaxation of excited states, intermolecular Eloss for exciton dissociation at donor/acceptor interfaces and the Eloss due to charge carrier recombination.
Assuming an average EQE of 80% and a FF of 0.75, the PCE versus Eg and Eloss can be evaluated for guiding materials synthesis and the optimized match of D/A, as shown in Fig. 4a. If the Eloss can be adjusted to a typical value of 0.6 eV, the PCE of NF based OSCs may exceed 15% by using narrowband materials with an Eg of 1.4–1.6 eV. In fact, the Eloss should be much larger than the calculated value according to the optical bandgap and VOC of NF based OSCs because the energy of absorbed photons is much larger than the optical bandgap of materials. The large Eloss may induce the complicated processes to decrease the performance of NF based OSCs. Here, we summarized the relationship of PCE, EQE and FF dependence on the Eloss based on more than 50 NF based OSCs with PCEs higher than 8%, as shown in Fig. 4b–d. Obviously, there is a great challenge to improve the performance of NF based OSCs by reducing the Eloss. Most of efficient NF based OSCs also suffer from an Eloss of about 0.6–0.7 eV, although reducing Eloss should be an efficient strategy to improve the performance of NF based OSCs. In this work, BDTThIT-M based OSCs achieved a PCE of 12.12% with a small Eloss of ∼0.588 eV, which should be among the highest PCE values of NF based OSCs with an Eloss less than 0.6 eV. The relatively high performance should be attributed to the balanced charge mobility and well developed morphology, which can be further confirmed from the high EQEmax of 78% and FF of 0.714. More efforts on reducing Eloss should be made on materials design and morphology optimization.
In conclusion, two new NF acceptors, BDTIT-M and BDTThIT-M, were rationally designed and successfully synthesized to elevate the LUMO and HOMO levels with different amplitudes by introducing methyl-modified end-groups and conjugated thiophene side-chains. The BDTIT-M based OSCs achieve a higher VOC than that of NFBDT based OSCs, demonstrating the feasibility of LUMO level modulation via methylation end-groups. Furthermore, VOC and JSC can be simultaneously improved due to the elevated LUMO level, narrowed bandgap, and enhanced absorption coefficient and electron mobility of BDTThIT-M with two conjugated thiophene side-chains. Meanwhile, the morphology of active layers can be well developed due to the acceptor with two conjugated thiophene side-chains, resulting in balanced charge carrier mobility and relatively high FF. The BDTThIT-M based OSCs achieved a champion PCE of 12.12% with a small Eloss of ∼0.588 eV, which might offer an efficient strategy for designing new donor and acceptor materials to achieve the optimized trade-off between JSC and VOC.
