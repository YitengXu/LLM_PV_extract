Doubly open-ended TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays decorated with a few nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles (sNP@NT hybrid structure) were prepared and used as charge-collecting photoelectrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on the NT array surfaces increased the dye loading on the sNP@NT-based DSCs by 9% compared to the undecorated NT-based DSCs, thereby enhancing the light harvesting capabilities. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the sNP@NT-based DSC prepared with 11 μm thick NT arrays was 10.0%, which constituted a 47% improvement over the corresponding NT-based DSCs (which displayed a 6.8% PCE). Despite having a dye loading level that was 22% lower than the dye loading level in the conventional TiO2 NP-based DSCs, due to the limited internal surface area, the PCE of the sNP@NT-based DSC was 28% greater than that of the conventional TiO2 NP-based DSC (8.1% PCE) prepared with a light scattering layer. The high charge collection efficiency of the NT array and the good photovoltaic performance set a new record for efficiency among NT-based DSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been widely investigated in academia and industry as next-generation photocells. DSCs may be prepared through simple fabrication processes at low costs, and they provide high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The photoanode of a typical DSC is prepared from a dye-coated optically transparent film composed of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and a platinum counter-electrode arranged in a sandwich configuration. The inter-electrode space is filled with a liquid electrolyte. Although the TiO2 NPs provide a large internal surface area for anchoring large amounts of dye and maximizing the harvesting of incident light, photoinduced electrons generated in the NP film undergo random diffusive transport through the disordered film architecture. The charge collection properties of such films are poor. Recently, highly ordered TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays were examined as an alternative electron transport material because they can increase the electron collection through direct charge pathways; however, the amount of dye that could be loaded into a NT-based film for light harvesting in a NT-based DSC was much lower than that in a NP-based DSC due to the lower surface area.

The PCE obtained from a DSC can be estimated through the equation: PCE = (JSC × VOC × FF)/Pin, where JSC is the short circuit current density (mA cm−2), VOC is the open circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor, and Pin is the input power. VOC is primarily determined by the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode under illumination and the redox potential of the I3−/I− couple. FF is governed by the electron transport properties through the electrolyte and the catalytic properties of the counter electrode. Therefore, a higher JSC could yield a better PCE for a given crystalline TiO2 electrode, liquid electrolyte, and Pt counter electrode. The JSC value is typically estimated from the equation:JSC = q × ηlh × ηinj × ηcc × Io, where q is the fundamental charge of an electron, Io is the intensity of the incident light, ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency from an excited dye molecule into the TiO2 conduction band, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency of the injected electrons. We demonstrated that the NT-based DSC yielded an ηcc exceeding 95%, 15% greater than that observed for the NP-based DSC. Assuming that the ηinj values were similar in both DSCs, the JSC value in the NT-based DSC could be improved by increasing the ηlh value. This may be achieved by increasing the dye loading value on the larger photoanode surface area.
The use of thicker NTs could be a way to increase the dye loading, but injected electrons have a longer pathway in thicker NTs, undergoing numerous charge recombination events with oxidized species in electrolytes. This is resulted in the decreased JSC as well as VOC. Alternatively, modifications of the NT surface such as controlling the morphology of the NTs, altering NT walls, or fabricating NT/NP hybrid structures have been widely investigated. These methods are useful for increasing the NT surface area; however, controlling the NT morphology by, for example, decreasing the tube diameter usually shortens the tube length. Alteration of NT walls, such as introducing double walls or creating bamboo-type NTs, requires complex fabrication processes and provides low PCE (2.96%). NT/NP hybrid structures, in which the NT walls are decorated with small NPs, may be readily obtained from Ti(OH)4 prepared from TiCl4 in water. Most NT/NP hybrid photoanodes are based on singly opened NT arrays that include a barrier layer in the bottom region of the NT arrays. The barrier layer can disrupt the flow of electrolytes to the inside of the tube and can reflect the near-UV light. The barrier, therefore, reduces the efficiencies of NT-based DSCs and yields relatively low PCEs of 3.8–7.56%. We recently reported a method for selectively etching the aligned doubly open-ended TiO2 nanotubes. The amorphous doubly open-ended TNTs were easily transferred to an FTO substrate to fabricate front-illuminated DSCs. We demonstrated that the NT-based DSC provided a better PCE than the NP-based DSC mainly by improving the efficiency of ηcc, which increased VOC, despite a dye loading in the NT-based DSCs that was 20% lower than in the NP-based DSCs. The decoration of the small TiO2 NPs on the aligned doubly open-ended TiO2 NTs (denoted sNP@NTs) may increase the dye loading on the photoanode and improve JSC by increasing ηlh. Here, we report the development of a highly efficient DSC prepared using sNP@NTs consisting of doubly open-ended TiO2 NT arrays decorated with NPs a few nm in size. The sNP@NT-based DSCs prepared with NT arrays only 11 μm thick exhibited a PCE exceeding 10.0%, higher than the PCEs obtained from conventional DSCs prepared with scattering layers (a 21 μm thick DSC yielded a PCE of 8.1%).

All anodization experiments were carried out in ethylene glycol solution containing 0.25 wt% NH4F and 0.3 vol% distilled water at room temperature. TiO2 NT arrays were prepared by anodization of Ti foil (99.7%, 0.25 mm, Aldrich) in a two electrode electrochemical cell with carbon sheets as the counter electrode. Before anodization, Ti foil was ultrasonically washed with acetone, ethanol, and distilled water. The anodization process was divided into two steps. At the first step, the Ti foil was anodized at 60 V for 120 min, and the resulting sample was ultrasonically washed with ethanol to remove the electrolyte and debris, followed by annealing at 250 °C for 2 h. The annealed sample was anodized again under the same anodizing conditions for a short time (5–10 min). After these two steps, the anodized sample was immersed in 33 wt% H2O2 solution. After ca. 5 min, the NT arrays with a closed bottom were separated from the Ti foil, and the closed bottom layer of TiO2 NT arrays became opened with increase immersing time. After the etching process, doubly open-ended TiO2 NT arrays were washed with ethanol and dried in air.


The as-prepared TiO2 NT membrane was adhered onto the fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate using viscous TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) paste, which was printed onto FTO glass by the doctor-blade technique. The fixed TiO2 NT on the NP film was annealed at 550 °C for 30 min, followed by immersion in 0.03 mM (Bu4N)2Ru(dcbpyH)2-(NCS)2 (N719 dye) solution for 24 h. The TiO2 electrode was rinsed with acetonitrile in order to remove physically adsorbed dyes. The dye-absorbed TiO2 electrodes were sandwiched together with a Pt-coated FTO glass counter electrode using a 60 μm thick-hot-melt spacer. The electrolyte, 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v%), was introduced into the space between the sandwiched cells.


X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2200/PC) was employed for crystal phase identification. The angle range examined was 20–80 degree at the theta–2theta scan mode.


A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S 4800) was utilized for morphological and structural characterization.


The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (69920, 1 kW Xe lamp with an optical filter, Oriel) to determine open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (as a reference) equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG-5, Schott). The voltage step and delay time for the measurement were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively.


UV-Vis spectrophotometry (using an Optizen POP spectrophotometer) was used to measure the adsorbed dye amount onto the TiO films, and dye detached by immersing a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution for 30 min, followed by measuring the absorbance of the resulting solution.


The impedance values of DSCs having different electrodes were measured using a computer-controlled potentiostat (SP-200, BioLogic) under dark conditions. The frequency range examined was 0.005 Hz to 100 kHz at room temperature, and the impedance spectra were recorded at potentials that varied from −0.66 to −0.72 V with a voltage amplitude set at 10 mV. The photo-injected electron life time was calculated from the middle frequency (fmin, τrec = 1/2πfmin) of Nyquist spectra. The recorded spectra were fit to an appropriate simplified circuit (Model S1) using the Z-fit software provided by BioLogic.

The IPCE spectra were plotted as a function of wavelength under a constant white light bias of approximately 5 mW cm−2 supplied by an array of white light emitting diodes using a power source with a monochromator (Zahner GmbH) and a multimeter and chopped at approximately 5 Hz.



Fig. 1 illustrates the process used to fabricate an sNP@NT-based DSC. Noncurling, freestanding, large-area aligned doubly open-ended TiO2 NTs were prepared using a simple selective etching process. The process is described in detail in Fig. S1, and the properties of the TiO2 NTs have been reported previously. The amorphous freestanding doubly open-ended TiO2 NTs were transferred to the FTO substrate with a 2 μm thick TiO2 NP film (binding layer). The amorphous TiO2 NT film electrode was then annealed at 550 °C for 30 min, which transformed the layer to a crystalline anatase phase (see the XRD data of Fig. S2). The film was then immersed in a 0.2 M acidic Ti(OH)4 aqueous solution prepared by adding TiCl4 to water and heated at 70 °C for 60 min to induce the formation of TiO2 NPs a few nm in size on the surfaces of the TiO2 NTs. After the decoration step, the electrode was re-annealed to create small anatase TiO2 NPs.

An HR-SEM image of the cross-section of a double-layered NT membrane, detached from the Ti foil, is shown in Fig. 2a. The thin 2nd bottom layer (1 μm) was selectively removed using a simple selective etching process (Fig. 2b) to provide aligned doubly open-ended TiO2 nanotubes (amorphous TiO2 NTs) with average pore sizes of 110 nm and 60 nm on the top and bottom surfaces (Fig. S3). The diameter of the top surface exceeded that of the bottom surface; thus, contact between the top surface and the electrode allowed the TiO2 NPs to easily enter the inner tube walls and fill the interfacial gap to provide good electrical connections between the NTs and the NPs (see the dotted line shown in Fig. 2c). The NT surfaces were clearly decorated with TiO2 NPs a few nm in size (sNP@NT) after immersion in a 0.2 M acidic Ti(OH)4 aqueous solution (Fig. 2e), side view shown in Fig. 2f. The raw NTs are shown in Fig. 2d for comparison. Fig. S4 also shows well-decorated inner sides with the small TiO2 NPs. The small TiO2 NPs increased the dye loading and enhanced the electrical contact between the NT arrays and the NPs.
We first optimized the length of the NTs and investigated the effects of the thickness on the photovoltaic performances of DSCs prepared using NT layers with a variety of thicknesses (11–27 μm). The electrodes were sensitized with the dye molecules by immersion in a 0.3 M ethanolic solution of (Bu4N)2Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2 (N719 dye) for 24 h. The TiO2 electrode and semi-transparent Pt-coated FTO (fluorinated tinoxide) counter electrode were sandwiched together using 60 μm thick hot-melt Surlyn spacers. A liquid electrolyte solution composed of 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) was introduced between the sensitized and counter electrodes using a syringe. The photovoltaic parameters of the NT-based DSCs are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) properties of the NT–DSCs under AM 1.5 solar front illumination. As the length of the NTs increased, the JSC value increased from 13.7 (11 μm) to 17.6 mA cm−2 (27 μm). The JSC value did not increase significantly for layer thicknesses beyond 14 μm, which gave a JSC value of 16.9 mA cm−2. The JSC value depended mainly on the quantity of dye adsorbed onto the NT surfaces, which was measured by detaching the dyes from the electrodes in a 0.1 M KOH solution and measuring the solution dye concentration using UV-Vis spectrophotometry (Fig. S5 and S6). As mentioned, JSC was strongly related to ηinj (JSC = q × ηlh × ηinj × ηcc × Io). The value of ηinj could be influenced by the energy gap between the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the quasi conduction band (CB), as well as by the dye adsorption mode or the presence of aggregation on the TiO2 electrode surfaces. In this study, the values of ηinj did not vary because the NT preparation and dye sensitization steps were performed under identical conditions. Therefore, JSC was expected to be proportional to the light harvesting ability of the dyes and the quantity of dye adsorbed onto the electrodes (ηlh). The increase in JSC was not correlated with the increase in the quantity of dye adsorbed onto the electrodes. The value of ηcc strongly influenced the photoinduced electron loss mechanisms caused by recombination of the electrons and I3− in the electrolyte.
The highest PCE (8.2%) for a JSC = 16.9 mA cm−2, a VOC = 0.710 V, and a FF = 0.680 was obtained from a DSC prepared with a 14 μm thick NT layer. Interestingly, the VOC values gradually decreased from 0.752 (11 μm) to 0.680 V (27 μm) as the NT layer thickness increased. This trend was ascribed to the relative drop in JSC in the thicker NT layers, as described by the equation: VOC = (nkT/q) × ln(JSC/JS). Here, n is the device ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in units of Kelvin, q is the fundamental charge, and JS is the saturation current density. As the length of the NTs increased, the rate of recombination between photoinduced electrons and I3− species or cationic dyes increased, even though the light harvesting properties increased.
We next fabricated sNP@NT-based DSCs using 14 μm thick NT layers (prepared using a 60 min immersion time) to achieve a highly efficient solar cell (Table 2). UV-Vis spectrophotometry measurements revealed that the quantities of N719 dye adsorbed onto the NT electrode were 22% lower than the values obtained from the NP electrodes (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, the quantity of dye loaded onto the sNP@NT-based DSC was 9% higher than that of the NT electrode, indicating that the TiO2 sNPs were introduced onto the surface of the doubly open-ended NTs. Fig. 4b shows a comparison between the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) properties of the sNP@NT-based DSC and the NT-based DSC. As mentioned above, the PCE of the NT-based DSC was 8.2%, with JSC = 17.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.710 V, and a FF = 0.680. This value was slightly greater than the value (7.3%) obtained from a conventional NP-based DSC prepared with an identical thickness (16 μm) mainly due to a larger VOC value in the NT-based DSC (0.710 V vs. 0.687 V). Considering that the dye loading onto the NT-based DSC was 22% lower than that of the NP-based DSC, the JSC in the NP-based DSC was expected to exceed the value obtained from the NT-based DSC; however, the JSC values obtained from the NP and NT-based DSCs were similar, indicating the presence of a dominant photoinduced electron loss mechanism, which decreased VOC and JSC in the NP-based DSC.

After decorating the surfaces of the doubly open-ended NTs with small NPs, the PCE of the sNP@NT-based DSC improved to 9.2%, with a JSC of 19.6 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.686 V, and a FF of 0.680. This PCE was 12% greater than that of the NT-based DSC (8.2%). The JSC value increased from 17.1 to 19.6 mA cm−2 (a 14% increase). This improvement over the corresponding NT-based DSC arose mainly from the higher degree of dye loading on the NT surface. The VOC of the sNP@NT-based DSCs decreased to 0.686 V compared to the value (0.710 V) obtained from the NT-based DSCs. As discussed above, the photoinduced electron loss mechanism remained dominant in the 14 μm thick NT layer. Therefore, the presence of additional dye molecules adsorbed onto the surfaces of the small NPs did not significantly increase the value of JSC. In turn, the photoinduced electron loss mechanism slightly reduced VOC in the sNP@NT-based DSC.
The resistance to recombination (Rrec) between sNP@NT and I3−, obtained using EIS measurements at −0.69 V in the dark (Fig. 4c), was 232 Ω, slightly smaller than the value measured between NTs and I3− (286 Ω); however, both values were much greater than the Rrec between NPs and I3− (84 Ω).
The PCE (9.2%) of the sNP@NT-based DSCs was even greater than the PCE of a conventional NP-based 5 μm thick DSC prepared using a 400 nm thick TiO2 scattering layer (denoted SL@NP-based DSC) and an active layer with an identical thickness (16 μm), which displayed JSC = 19.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.678 V, FF = 0.622, and provided a PCE = 8.1%. It should be noted that this PCE exceeded that obtained from the NP-based DSC (7.3%) due to the scattering effects, consistent with the results reported by others.
We further improved the PCE of the sNP@NT-based DSC by introducing a thinner NT layer (11 μm thickness). The sNP@NT-based DSC (11 μm NT) provided a JSC = 19.8 mA cm−2, with a maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) value of 94.3% (Fig. S7), a VOC = 0.745 V, and a FF = 0.678, resulting in an estimated PCE of 10.0%. These improvements were mainly ascribed to the larger VOC value compared to the value obtained from the sNP@NT-based DSC (14 μm NT, Fig. 5). Frank et al. reported that the theoretical maximum PCE of the N719-sensitized cell employing the triiodide/iodide redox couple is 14.3% with the values for the fill factor ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 and VOC ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 V, and this value would be achieved with no recombination reactions on the surfaces of TiO2/dye/electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4c and our previous report, NT based DSCs show higher recombination resistance and charge collection efficiency than those of NP based DSCs, thus the resulting PCE of NT based DSCs could be more close to the theoretical maximum PCE of DSCs compared with conventional NP based DSCs. It should be noted that more decoration of the NTs with TiO2 NPs a few nm in size (80 min versus 60 min in sNP@NT) did not effectively improve the PCE (Fig. S8), most likely due to dominant recombination reaction on the surfaces of the small TiO2 NPs (Fig. S9).

We demonstrated the preparation of a highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cell using a doubly open-ended TiO2 NT array decorated with TiO2 NPs a few nm in size. The small NPs were readily introduced by immersing the NT array in a Ti(OH)4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 60 min. The front-side illuminated sNP@NT-based DSC exhibited a greatly enhanced PCE of 10.0% (a 47% improvement over the PCE of the NT-based DSCs). This PCE exceeded that of the conventional SL@NP-based DSCs (8.1%). The improved PCE in the sNP@NT arose from both a larger surface area with a higher dye loading (thus, enhanced light-harvesting ability) and a low electron transfer resistance (thus, a slower recombination reaction). This approach is being extended to the preparation of iodine-free solid state DSCs with various sensitizers and hole transporting materials.
