The impact of various polymeric compatibilizers, including end-functionalized P3HTs and diblock copolymers containing P3HT, on the structure and function of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunctions is presented. Careful analyses of small angle neutron scattering curves provide a measure of the miscibility of PCBM in P3HT, the average PCBM domain size, and the interfacial area between PCBM and the P3HT-rich phase in the uncompatibilized and compatibilized systems. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) also provides information regarding the changes in the crystallinity of P3HT due to the presence of the compatibilizer. Results show that most compatibilizers cause the domain sizes to decrease and the P3HT crystallinity to increase; however, some cause an increase in domain size, suggesting that they are not effective interfacial modifiers. The correlation of morphology with photovoltaic activity shows that the decreased domain size, increased crystallinity and increased interfacial area do not always result in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE). It appears that the introduction of an insulating molecule at the PCBM:P3HT interface as a compatibilizer results in a decrease in PCE. Thus, the presence of the compatibilizer at this interface dominates the photovoltaic activity, rather than the morphological control.

Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept have attracted significant interest for sustainable solar energy conversion due to their low cost, flexibility, ease of processing, and straightforward thin film formation. There are three consecutive steps in the conversion of solar energy to electricity in BHJ solar cells: the generation of excitons by photon absorption, the dissociation of excitons at the donor–acceptor interface into free charge carriers, and the transport of electrons and holes to the electrodes. Excitons can only travel a short distance (∼10 nm) before they recombine; thus, to facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport, an ideal morphology of BHJ active layers that contain phase separated nanodomains that are ∼10 nm has been suggested. Based on this model, significant effort has been made to control and optimize the morphology of BHJ active layers by adjusting the donor–acceptor ratio, by the application of thermal and vapor annealing, and by processing with additives.

Another approach to control the morphology of BHJ active layers is to use diblock copolymers as biphasic compatibilizers. P3HT and PCBM phase separate at compositions that are used in OPV active layers; however, compatibilizers have the ability to moderate the domain sizes in a phase separated mixture and adjust the rate of phase segregation. For instance, Frechet et al. reported that incorporating donor–acceptor (P3HT-b-PCBM) block copolymers as compatibilizers in P3HT:PCBM mixtures modifies the phase separation behavior between donor and acceptor phases, resulting in an improvement of the device structure and stability. Wudl et al. synthesized a diblock copolymer comprised of P3HT as a donor and C60 as an acceptor, and found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the resultant BHJ increased 35% with addition of 5 wt% of this diblock copolymer as a compatibilizer. Jo and coauthors used similar P3HT-b-C60 copolymers as compatibilizers and demonstrated a decrease of domain size in P3HT:PCBM mixtures with the addition of a small amount of P3HT-b-C60. The presence of the compatibilizer also decreases the rate of domain size coarsening and thus may improve the long-term stability of devices. Similarly, a P3HT-based triblock copolymer was introduced into a P3HT:PCBM active layer by Tsai et al., and devices exhibited a PCE of 4.4% with the addition of 1.5 wt% of this triblock copolymer. Chen et al. used P3HT-b-PEO to compatibilize donor–acceptor interfaces, showing that at low loadings of P3HT-b-PEO, the domain size decreases due to the polar interaction between the methyl ester of PCBM and the EO repeat units.
However, little work has been done to accurately determine the morphology of the active layer of BHJ solar cells with compatibilizers. Moreover, there is no report on the impact of the compatibilizers on the specific interfacial area (S/V) in conjugated polymer:fullerene blends. This is surprising, as the amount of donor–acceptor interfacial area is a critical parameter because an increase of S/V will increase the probability of exciton dissociation and thus the amount of charge carriers produced. This shortage of detailed morphological characterization may be attributed to the limited contrast between the carbon-based conjugated polymer (donor) and carbon nanoparticle fullerene derivatives (acceptor) when optical, X-ray- or electron-based probes are used, which may lead to ambiguity in the identification of the resultant structure. Fortunately, neutron scattering provides significant contrast between the two components in this system, providing a technique that provides access to detailed structural and morphological information.
In the present work, several additive modifiers, including end-functionalized P3HT and diblock copolymers, have been synthesized, and the impact of these different compatibilizers on the thermal properties, morphology, and structure of P3HT:PCBM mixtures has been examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). These experiments provide quantifiable measures of the specific interfacial area and miscibility of amorphous PCBM in amorphous P3HT with and without compatibilizers, allowing these structural parameters to be correlated with photovoltaic properties of the resultant active layers.

[6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from Nano-C and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was purchased from Rieke Metals (Sepiolid P200, Mw = 25000 g mol−1, PDI = 1.6, regioregularity, ∼98%). Both were used without further purification. Compatibilizers used in this study were synthesized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and include poly(3-hexylthiophene) end-capped with 3-pyridine (P3HT-3Py, Mn = 6600 g mol−1, PDI = 1.2, regioregularity, >95%) or with 2-pyridine (P3HT-2Py, Mn = 8000 g mol−1, PDI = 1.2, regioregularity, >95%), and a diblock copolymer of P3HT and poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HT-b-PEO). A diblock copolymer of P3HT and poly(methyl methacrylate) (P3HT-b-PMMA) was purchased from Polymer Source. The chemical structures of the compatibilizers are presented in Scheme 1. Mixtures of P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8; wt/wt), which are denoted as P3HT:PCBM when uncompatibilized, were produced by co-dissolving P3HT, PCBM, and the compatibilizer in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). Solutions were then deposited dropwise on a gently heated (ca. 110 °C) 11 mm diameter quartz disk window to accelerate drying. This procedure yields solid disks around 1 mm thick on top of quartz windows. All the samples were dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight to affect the removal of residual ODCB. The characteristics and abbreviations of the samples studied in the present work are listed in Table 1.

DSC studies were carried out using a TA Instruments temperature modulated DSC (TA Q1000). Indium was used as a standard for temperature and heat flow calibration. The heat capacity was evaluated with respect to a sapphire standard. Measurements were performed at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 with dry nitrogen gas purged into the DSC cell at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1. In our scans, endotherms are presented with downward deflection.

To determine the percent crystallinity of P3HT at a given temperature, the as-cast sample was heated to 300 °C at 10 °C min−1. The crystallinity, Wc, is obtained from eqn (1):
(1)
where Δ
Hm is the measured heat fusion of P3HT and ΔHf is the heat fusion of 100% crystalline P3HT. ΔHf has been reported to be 99 J g−1 by Nandi and Malik and this value is often cited. Recently, Saalwachter and coauthors reported that ΔHf is more accurately determined to be 37 J g−1. We use both ΔHf values in the following analysis, where each value is presented separately as Wc99 and Wc37, respectively.


The SANS experiments were completed on the General Purpose SANS instrument at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The raw data were corrected for scattering from the empty cell, detector dark current, and detector sensitivity. The corrected data were then normalized to an absolute scale using a Porasil-A standard. By evaluating the slope of IQ4versus Q4 at high Q (Q = 4π/λsin θ, where λ is the neutron wavelength and θ is the scattering angle), the contributions from incoherent scattering and thermal density fluctuation are eliminated, yielding the absolute coherent scattering.


Solutions were prepared by dissolving P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8) in ODCB at a total solid concentration of 20 mg mL−1. To fabricate the compatibilized active layers, the compatibilizer was added to the P3HT:PCBM solution at a level of 1%. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were first washed with detergent and then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The cleaned ITO substrates were subsequently treated with UV-ozone for 20 minutes. Filtered PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P 4083) was then spin cast on the UV-treated ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 40 s. After baking the PEDOT:PSS films in air at 140 °C for 20 minutes, the photovoltaic layer P3HT:PCBM/compatibilizer was spin cast at 900 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 20 minutes under vacuum. The active layer films created by these protocols have thicknesses of ∼80 nm. Finally, to create the OPV device, 15 nm Ca and 80 nm Al was thermally deposited through a shadow mask. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a computer-controlled Newport system under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2.


The DSC thermograms from all of the P3HT:PCBM blends incorporating various compatibilizers are presented in Fig. 1 and S1 in the ESI. A single glass transition temperature, Tg, is observed during heating for all the blend samples. This Tg is associated with the glass transition of the miscible phase of amorphous P3HT and amorphous PCBM and ranges from 31.1 °C to 40.1 °C for different compatibilizer samples, as shown in Table 2. The Tgs of pure P3HT and pure PCBM are 12.1 °C and 131.2 °C, respectively, as reported by Zhao et al. According to Zhao et al., the single Tg observed for the blend suggests that P3HT and PCBM are fully miscible at all compositions. However, as seen in Fig. 1, there is no glass transition observed in the DSC of the pure PCBM which indicates that the glass transition of PCBM is too broad or small to be observed by DSC. Therefore, the observance of a single Tg from DSC cannot be used as evidence of miscibility, as a PCBM-rich phase may exist and undergo a glass transition but may not be observed in the DSC experiment. Double melting peaks of PCBM are observed in the pure PCBM sample, as has been reported previously and ascribed to multiple crystal structures of PCBM.

The melting temperature (Tm) of P3HT in the different blend samples varies from 200.8 °C to 207.3 °C as shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 2. No melting peak of PCBM crystals was observed for all the samples. The ΔHm and the calculated P3HT crystallinity based on the two reported ΔHf values, Wc99 and Wc37, are also presented in Table 2. When the diblock copolymers and functional P3HTs are added, the crystallinity ranges between 20 and 28% (assuming ΔHf = 37 J g−1) or significantly less (7–10%) if ΔHf = 99 J g−1 is used, with most samples exhibiting an increase in P3HT crystallinity with increasing compatibilizer concentration. Fig. S1 presents the cooling scans acquired for each of the samples at a rate of at 10 °C min−1 from 300 °C to 100 °C. The crystallization temperatures, Tc, resulting from these cooling processes are also presented in Table 2.
The SANS curves of the P3HT:PCBM blends without compatibilizer and blends compatibilized with 1% P3HT-b-PMMA and 1% P3HT-b-PEO are presented in Fig. 2, and curves for all other samples are shown in Fig. S2. A peak at Q ∼ 0.39 Å−1 is observed in each SANS curve, which corresponds to the P3HT lamellae d100 peak, with a d spacing of 1.73 nm. Fig. 3 and S3 show the Lorentz-corrected scattering (IQ2vs. Q) of the samples, which accentuates the correlation peak at Q ∼ 0.02 Å−1 that corresponds to the long period of the P3HT lamellae, which is the average distance between two adjacent lamellae. This correlation peak is clear in the uncompatibilized P3HT:PCBM sample (P3HT:PCBM) and in the samples compatibilized by the P3HT end-capped with 2-pyridine (P3HT-2Py), and those compatibilized with the P3HT-b-PMMA and the P3HT-b-PEO diblocks at 1 and 5%. The position of the peak and the corresponding long period (2π/Q) of these samples are presented in Table 3, which shows that the long period of the samples compatibilized by P3HT-2Py (1% and 5%) increases over that of the pure P3HT:PCBM mixture, while that of the samples compatibilized with P3HT-b-PMMA and P3HT-b-PEO decreases. The samples compatibilized with P3HT-3Py exhibit a very weak correlation peak, indicating less lamellar ordering upon addition of these compatibilizers. This is in agreement with the DSC results, which indicate that these samples also exhibit the smallest amount of crystalline P3HT of the compatibilized samples.

Our recent neutron scattering results clearly indicate that P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8) thin films do not exist as a two-phase structure, but as three phases comprising P3HT crystals, a pure amorphous PCBM phase, and a miscible phase of amorphous P3HT and amorphous PCBM. The data reported here are analyzed similarly, but to quantitatively analyze the SANS curves, the scattering length density (SLD) of each phase is required, which requires knowledge of the chemical composition and density of the phase. The density of crystalline P3HT is reported to be 1.12 g cm−3, but the density of amorphous P3HT is not reported. The density of amorphous P3HT is approximated as 90% of the crystalline density or 1.01 g cm−3. The scattering length density, b, of crystalline P3HT and amorphous P3HT are then calculated to be bP3HT,c = 0.69 × 10−6 Å−2 and bP3HT,a = 0.62 × 10−6 Å−2, respectively. The density of crystalline PCBM formed by casting from ODCB is reported to be 1.67 g cm−3. Following the same assumption that ρamorphous = 0.9ρcryst, the SLD of amorphous PCBM is calculated to be 4.4 × 10−6 Å−2, which agrees with the published values and our neutron reflectivity results. From these values, the SLD of the miscible P3HT:PCBM phase, bM, can be determined:
bM = bP3HT,a(1 − FB) + bPCBM,aFB
(2)
where
FB is the volume fraction of PCBM in the P3HT:PCBM miscible phase. FB has been reported to be ∼20%, which results in a scattering length density of the miscible phase, bM = 1.38 × 10−6 Å−2.

In the neutron scattering experiments, the measured scattering intensity is a sum of the scattering between the P3HT crystal and the PCBM pure phase, between the P3HT crystal and the miscible amorphous phase, and between the PCBM pure phase and the miscible phase. The contribution of each phase pair to the total scattering is proportional to the square of the difference of the scattering length density of the two phases, (bi − bj). Examination of the scattering length density contrast (SLDC) of these three pairs clearly shows that the contrast between the P3HT crystals (0.69 × 10−6 Å−2) and the P3HT:PCBM miscible phase (1.38 × 10−6 Å−2) is very small relative to the contrast between pure PCBM (4.4 × 10−6 Å−2) and either P3HT-containing phase (or a mixture of the two). Moreover, the SLDC between PCBM and P3HT crystals can be approximated as equal to the SLDC between PCBM and the miscible PCBM/P3HT phase. Based on this analysis, the scattering is dominated by the structure of the pure PCBM phase. Hence, the size, interfacial areas, and scattering length density contrast values that are reported refer to those of the PCBM-pure phase dispersed in a P3HT-rich phase. It is important to emphasize that this P3HT-rich phase is actually a mixture of P3HT crystals distributed among a miscible mixture of amorphous P3HT and PCBM, but this mixture can be represented as a single phase because the SLDs of the crystalline P3HT and the P3HT:PCBM miscible phase are similar.
In order to complete the analysis, the SLD of the P3HT-rich phase (bp) must be estimated and then used in fitting the absolute scattering intensities to models to extract the size and composition of the phases. There are three components in the P3HT-rich phase; crystalline P3HT (ϕP3HT,c), amorphous P3HT (ϕP3HT,a) and amorphous PCBM which is dissolved in the amorphous P3HT (ϕPCBM,m). Note that these three fractions are defined relative to the whole sample, not just to the P3HT-rich phase. The percent crystallinity of P3HT that is obtained from DSC is a mass fraction, while the volume fraction is required in SANS analysis. The volume fraction of crystalline P3HT in the whole sample (ϕP3HT,c) can be obtained from the mass fraction with eqn (3),
(3)
where
Wc is the mass fraction of crystalline P3HT in the whole sample which is determined by DSC and shown in Table 1. ϕPCBM is the volume fraction of PCBM and WPCBM is the mass fraction of PCBM in the whole sample, which are 36% and 45% respectively in these samples. The ϕPCBM value is based on the composition of the mixtures, a density of 1.03 g cm−3 for P3HT, and a sample that is 20% crystalline. The assumption that P3HT is 20% crystalline is based on the DSC results with ΔHf = 37 J g−1. Given that the densities of crystalline and amorphous P3HT are similar, any error in percent crystallinity will not significantly impact the results of the analysis presented below. In this analysis, the density of amorphous PCBM is estimated to be 1.52 g cm−3, a value based on its reported SLD.

Similarly, the volume fraction of amorphous P3HT in the whole sample (ϕP3HT,a) is determined with eqn (4),
ϕP3HT,a = 1 − ϕPCBM − ϕP3HT,c.
(4)
Here
ϕPCBM = 36% and ϕP3HT,c is determined with eqn (3). Finally, the volume fraction of PCBM that is dissolved in the amorphous P3HT (ϕPCBM,m) relative to the whole sample can be readily calculated if the ratio of PCBM to P3HT in the amorphous region of the P3HT-rich phase is known. This ratio is FB/(1 − FB), where FB is the volume fraction of PCBM in the amorphous P3HT:PCBM miscible region. ϕPCBM,m can then be calculated with eqn (5),

(5)
Thus the SLD of the P3HT-rich phase (bp) can be determined from the weighted average of the SLD of each component in that phase, as shown in eqn (6):
(6)
Combining eqn (4)–(6), we find that
(7)
This quantification of scattering contrast provides the relationships necessary to quantitatively analyze the SANS curves to provide significant insight into the structure of these mixtures, as well as the verification of the model presented. Pursuant to this, the size of the domains that give rise to the scattering are determined for all the samples by fitting the measured scattering intensity to the Debye–Bueche equation, which is shown in eqn (8).
I(Q) = I0/(1 + Q2ξ2)2
(8)
Here
ξ is the correlation length of the system and I0 is the zero-angle scattering intensity. The results of this analysis for the pure P3HT:PCBM mixture as well as for the compatibilized blends are shown in Fig. 4 and S4, which plot I(Q)−1/2 as a function of Q2, and correlation lengths ξ are tabulated in Table 3. As ξ is a measure of the average domain size of the P3HT-rich phase and the pure PCBM phase, increases or decreases in domain sizes with addition of a compatibilizer are represented in ξ. The uncompatibilized sample has a correlation length of 253 Å, while the sample compatibilized with the P3HT-PEO diblock at 1% (P3HT-b-PEO-1) has the smallest ξ of 113 Å. The blend compatibilized with 3-pyridyl terminated P3HT chains at 5% (P3HT-3Py-5) has the largest ξ of 313 Å. Therefore, these results indicate that the P3HT-b-PMMA and P3HT-b-PEO diblock copolymers are very effective at compatibilizing the P3HT:PCBM phase separated system, decreasing domain sizes by ∼45 to 60%. This behavior of the P3HT-b-PEO diblock copolymer agrees with previous results from X-ray scattering. One might also predict that this decrease in ξ will result in improved exciton dissociation, as the donor–acceptor heterojunctions are much closer together, which should minimize recombination. While the sample compatibilized by the 2-Py end-capped P3HT shows a modest decrease in domain size, the samples that are compatibilized with the 3-Py end-capped P3HT exhibit an increase in domain sizes, which may be anticipated to be counter-productive to effective exciton dissociation.

To further quantify the impact of the addition of the compatibilizers to the morphology, the specific interfacial area, S/V, is determined from the measured scattering curves. S/V is a direct measure of the amount of interface between the pure PCBM phase and the P3HT-rich phase and can be calculated from eqn (9):
S/V = 4ϕ1ϕ2/ξ
(9)
Here
ϕ1 is the volume fraction of the P3HT-rich phase and ϕ2 is the volume fraction of the pure PCBM phase. Utilizing the fact that ϕ1 + ϕ2 = 1,

ϕ1 = ϕC + (1 − ϕPCBM − ϕP3HT,c) + (1 − ϕPCBM − ϕP3HT,c) × FB/(1 − FB)
(10)
In
eqn (10), the first term is the volume fraction of crystalline P3HT in the whole sample; the second term is the volume fraction of amorphous P3HT in the whole sample; and the last term is the volume fraction of PCBM that is dissolved in amorphous P3HT. S/V can be determined by combining eqn (3), (9), and (10) and by using ξ values along with the assumption that FB = 20%, since FB has been reported to be near 20%. The resulting S/V values are listed in Table 4. Unfortunately, this calculation requires a priori knowledge of ΔHf, and thus S/V values based on both reported ΔHf values are presented in Table 4.

Porod analysis of the two-phase structure quantifies the scattering length density contrast between the two phases, which in turn provides insight into the extent of P3HT and PCBM mixing in the miscible amorphous phase. In the Porod analysis, at high Q, I(Q) ∼  where the Δρ is the scattering length density contrast between the two phases. Therefore, a plot of IQ4 as a function of Q2, as shown in Fig. 5 and S5, can be fit to a straight line where the intercept, A, is related to the SLDC between the PCBM phase and P3HT-rich phase as
A = 2π × (Δb)2 × S/V
(11)
The result of this analysis provides a value for Δb that is denoted ΔbE, the experimentally determined scattering length density contrast between the P3HT-rich phase and the pure PCBM phase. Rearranging eqn (11) gives
(12)
Thus, ΔbE can be calculated with eqn (12) using the experimentally determined A, where the values of A and ΔbE are presented in Table 4 for all of the samples studied. Meanwhile, the theoretical SLDC between these two phases, ΔbT, can be determined from a mass balance on the sample:
ΔbT = bPCBM,a − bp
(13)
where
bp is defined in eqn (7), and bPCBM,a = 4.4 × 10−6 Å−2. Therefore, ΔbT can be readily determined for all samples using eqn (3) and (7) and the assumption that FB = 20%, which is estimated from our previous work. Inspection of ΔbE and ΔbT shows that they do not agree, which indicates that the assumption that FB = 20% is incorrect. However, FB can be accurately determined for each sample by using eqn (12) and (13), which leads to

(14)

F
B, the miscibility of amorphous PCBM in the P3HT amorphous phase, can be determined by combining eqn (3), (7), (9), (10) and (14), which results in a set of equations where FB is the only unknown. These values of the miscibility of PCBM in the amorphous P3HT phase, FB, are shown in Table 5 with the corresponding SLDC value, which does depend on the value chosen for ΔHf. For the uncompatibilized P3HT:PCBM sample, FB is 24% and 30%, when ΔHf = 99 J g−1 and 37 J g−1 are used, respectively. Note that miscibilities reported in previous studies correspond to the miscibility of PCBM in the P3HT-rich phase (which includes both crystalline and amorphous P3HT), rather than in the amorphous P3HT only. Thus, the miscibility of PCBM in P3HT as presented in Table 5, defining the level of miscibility of PCBM in amorphous P3HT, is commensurate with previous studies that estimate this miscibility limit to be ∼20%. This level of PCBM miscibility in amorphous P3HT remains nearly constant for all the compatibilizers except for the 1 and 5% P3HT-b-PEO block copolymer samples, where the amount of PCBM dispersed in the P3HT amorphous matrix is 5–6 vol% lower. This decrease of FB for the P3HT-b-PEO-1 and P3HT-b-PEO-5 samples may be due to sequestration of PCBM by the block copolymer driven by polar interactions between the EO repeat units and the methyl ester of PCBM resulting in the decrease in the miscibility of PCBM in P3HT.

The S/V of all the samples can also be re-calculated using the refined FB values, and these are reported in Table 5. The results from this more precise analysis suggest that the amount of PCBM that is found to disperse in the P3HT increases modestly, but this increase does not translate into a significant change in the amount of interfacial area between the pure PCBM phase and the P3HT-rich phase; S/V still varies from ∼2.5 to 6.5 × 10−3 Å−1S/V and the trends among the compatibilizers remain the same.
For this information to be the most useful, these structural changes must be correlated with the OPV function. With this in mind, the photovoltaic properties of the P3HT:PCBM mixtures with different compatibilizers were measured, and the results are shown in Table 6 and Fig. 6. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) remains nearly constant for all of the samples, though it decreases slightly when the pyridyl-terminated P3HTs are used to compatibilize the P3HT/PCBM blends; however, the short circuit current densities for the samples compatibilized with the end-functionalized P3HT (P3HT-2Py-1 and P3HT-3Py-1) are significantly larger than that measured for the P3HT:PCBM blend. Trends or trade-offs are not as clear for the samples compatibilized with the block copolymers (P3HT-b-PMMA-1 and P3HT-b-PEO-1): the device compatibilized with P3HT-b-PMMA-1 shows very little change in JSC or VOC compared to that of the pure P3HT:PCBM sample, but the P3HT-b-PEO-1 sample exhibits a modest increase in JSC and a decrease in VOC. The results presented in Table 6 also show that while the fill factor (FF) decreases with the addition of compatibilizers, which may be attributed to an increase of series resistance, devices compatibilized with the pyridyl-functionalized P3HT compatibilizers exhibit an improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE), while those compatibilized with the diblock copolymers exhibit decreased PCEs.

The morphology of the active layer in an OPV device dramatically impacts its photovoltaic performance. The excitons that are formed must have a pathway to a donor–acceptor interface to dissociate efficiently and connected conduits for charge transport to the electrodes. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the neutron scattering of P3HT:PCBM mixtures with different compatibilizers offers unprecedented insight into the thermodynamics and structure of these additive-modified BHJ thin films. The results and analyses show that the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM mixtures changes with the addition of compatibilizers, as represented through changes in the specific interfacial area, S/V, and correlation length, ξ. It is crucial to understand the precise changes that occur upon compatibilizer addition, as these parameters are intimately linked to the generation and dissociation of excitons, and the transport of the free charges to the electrodes.

The increase of the amount of interfacial area between the PCBM and the P3HT-rich phase provides more opportunity for exciton dissociation. The generated exciton must dissociate into free charges before it recombines, where this dissociation occurs most readily at the donor–acceptor interface. The free charges can then transport to the electrodes if sufficient transport channels exist. Therefore, the presence of interfacial area between the P3HT and PCBM is crucial to allow efficient exciton dissociation and a reduction in exciton recombination. In general, the addition of a compatibilizer shows an increase in the interfacial area between the PCBM and the P3HT-rich phase, which is conducive to more effective exciton dissociation. In particular, the sample that is compatibilized with 1% P3HT-b-PEO increases the interfacial area by more than a factor of two; both diblock copolymers show an increase in interfacial area, commensurate with smaller domain size. Samples compatibilized with 3Py end-functionalized P3HT show a significant decrease in the interfacial area between PCBM and P3HT, which should inhibit exciton dissociation. It is worth noting that the S/V determined by this analysis follows the same trend as 1/ξ because ϕ1 and ϕ2 do not change much with the addition of compatibilizers.
The change in structure manifest in S/V, however, can be beneficial or detrimental to photovoltaic performance. A decrease in domain size may increase the propensity of the exciton to find an interface to allow exciton dissociation, however the presence of the compatibilizer at the P3HT:PCBM interface may limit the exciton dissociation at the interface, particularly if the compatibilizer has poor transport properties. Also, a smaller domain size may result in loss of connectivity of donor or acceptor domains throughout the sample, resulting in trapping of charges that prevents their transport to the electrodes.
Moreover, previous studies ascribe the increased efficiency of P3HT:PCBM active layers with thermal annealing to an increase in P3HT crystallinity, which results in improved hole transport. It is reasoned that the increase in charge carrier mobility is due to an increase of the in-plane π–π stacking of P3HT, allowing charges to move easily from one grain to another. The crystallinity of the samples that are compatibilized with block copolymers (P3HT-b-PMMA-1 and P3HT-b-PEO-1) are 24% and 28% (assuming ΔHf = 37 J g−1) respectively, which are levels of crystallinity greater than that of uncompatibilized P3HT:PCBM (21%). Hence, the increase of crystallinity of P3HT in the samples that are compatibilized with block copolymers should facilitate hole transport.
Similarly, the samples that are compatibilized with block copolymers (P3HT-b-PMMA-1 and P3HT-b-PEO-1) exhibit a significant decrease in domain size, which corresponds to an increase in S/V, which should increase the propensity of the exciton to find an interface for dissociation, provide more pathways connecting the “streams” to the “rivers”, and should facilitate charge transport. However, the systems that are compatibilized with block copolymers actually show a lower PCE than the uncompatibilized sample. As mentioned in the Introduction section, there are three consecutive steps in the conversion of solar energy to electricity in BHJ solar cells: the generation of excitons by photon absorption, the travel of excitons to the donor–acceptor interface and dissociation into free charge carriers, and the transport of electrons and holes to the electrodes. The structural studies show that the morphology improvements should result in a higher probability that excitons reach an interface and that the increased crystallinity should improve hole transport. One explanation for the observed decrease in PCE is that the dissociation of excitons at the donor–acceptor interface is altered by the compatibilizers. The presence of a non-conductive block in the diblock copolymers at the donor–acceptor interface appears to inhibit exciton dissociation at the interface and increases the series resistance, resulting in a decrease of PCE.
The addition of the 2-Py end-functionalized P3HT as a compatibilizer shows a different relationship between morphology alteration and OPV activity. This sample shows a decrease in domain size with addition of the compatibilizer, a commensurate improvement in S/V, and an increase of crystallinity of P3HT from 21% to 24% (assuming ΔHf = 37 J g−1), both of which suggest improved probability of diffusion of excitons to a donor–acceptor interface and facilitated charge transport to the electrodes. For this sample, the improved morphological changes do translate to improved photovoltaic activity, with an increase of JSC and PCE. One of the advantages of using end-functionalized P3HT as a compatibilizer is that there is no insulating block, such as the PMMA or PEO blocks present in the block copolymers studied. Therefore, the improvement in the morphology combined with a design (absence of an insulating block) that does not limit the exciton transport and/or dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface results in an improvement of the PCE is an important hallmark of the pyridyl-terminated P3HTs. It is interesting to note that the system that is compatibilized with the 3-Py end functionalized P3HT shows little change in the domain size, S/V, and crystallinity, but its addition results in an increase in PCE. One interpretation of this result is that the presence of 3-Py end functionalized P3HT at the donor–acceptor interface facilitates the exciton dissociation, resulting in an increase of JSC and PCE.

The small angle neutron scattering curves of mixtures of P3HT and PCBM that are compatibilized by end-functionalized P3HT or diblock copolymers are carefully analyzed to provide detailed structural information of the BHJ thin films, and the resultant structural changes are correlated with their photovoltaic activity.

The SANS analysis demonstrates that the presence of the compatibilizers alters the average domain size and the specific interfacial area between the pure PCBM and P3HT-rich phase in these P3HT:PCBM mixtures. Aspects of the morphology are significantly improved with addition of the block copolymer or 2-Py end functionalized P3HT, exhibiting an increase in crystallinity and specific interfacial area and decreasing the domain size. The domain size, interfacial area or crystallinity of the 3-Py end-functionalized P3HT samples however exhibits very little change.
Correlation of these results with the photovoltaic performance of these bulk heterojunctions as OPV active layers indicates that these morphological changes do not necessarily lead to the creation of bulk-heterojunction structures with improved photovoltaic activity. For instance, samples with smaller domain size, more crystallinity, and increased interfacial area between phases exhibit a decrease in power conversion efficiency if the compatibilizer contains an insulating block (i.e. diblock copolymers), while samples that are modified with molecules that have good charge transport (i.e. end-functionalized P3HT) exhibit improved power conversion efficiencies regardless of the morphological changes.
Thus, there appear to be clear trade-offs when the impact of the compatibilizer at the donor–acceptor interface is considered: the ability to reduce domain sizes is generally beneficial, but the impact on the change in the photophysics of the active layer with the interfacial modifier must also be considered. The results presented here suggest that an insulating block in the compatibilizer is detrimental to performance, ostensibly because it hinders exciton transport to the interface and/or its dissociation by increasing series resistance. This effect seems to be more important in determining the power conversion efficiency of the resultant BHJ than morphological alterations in crystallinity, interfacial area, or domain size.
