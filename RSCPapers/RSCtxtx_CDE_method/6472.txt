Unsymmetrical squaraine dyes (CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2) with carbazole thiophene donor units were synthesized, characterized and used as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These squaraines exhibited intense absorption in the near IR-visible region of the solar spectrum both in solution and on TiO2 surface. The LUMO level of the parent sensitizer (CTSQ-2) was positioned at a potential much close to the conduction band of TiO2 resulting in lack of enough driving force for electron injection which was modulated by structurally changing the donor carbazole moiety (CTSQ-1), pushing the LUMO more positive thereby enhancing the driving force. Theoretical calculations were carried out in order to have a better understanding of the electron density distribution in CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2. Electron injection dynamics in CTSQ-1 was studied in detail by changing the Li+ concentration and its effects on photovoltaic parameters were discussed with the help of JV, IPCE, lifetime and EIS measurements.

Renewable energy technologies will need to play a bigger role in the future than they do today in order to circumvent climate change and fossil fuel depletion. One answer to global warming is to replace and retrofit current technologies with alternatives that have comparable or better performance, but do not emit carbon dioxide. Solar energy technologies are poised for significant growth in the 21st century. Photovoltaic solar electricity can deliver and is delivering clean, reliable, on-demand power in current markets worldwide. There is a large future market demand for solar photovoltaics; the projection for 2050 varies nearly two orders of magnitude from ca. 100 GW annum−1 to nearly 10 TW annum−1. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are attracting much attention in comparison with conventional Si photovoltaics due to their ease of fabrication, low cost, higher efficiencies and short energy payback time.

In DSSCs, sensitizers play a vital role which lead to extensive research in developing new dye molecules to harvest the entire visible and NIR region of sunlight, of these ruthenium polypyridyl complexes proved to be the most successful ones giving consistent efficiencies above 10%. In spite of all these advantages the relatively higher cost and scarcity of Ru metal along with the exhibited absorption limited to the visible range necessitates the need for sensitizers that can absorb in the NIR region. A way to increase the power conversion efficiency is by employing dyes that have panchromatic absorption along with high molar extinction coefficients.
Metal free organic dyes proved to be alternative sources for the metal bound sensitizers owing to their higher molar absorption coefficients, tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties, ease of structural modifications and cost effectiveness. Grätzel et al. recently reported 13% efficiency for a Zn porphyrin dye (SM 315) with an alternate Co(II/III) redox shuttle. Among the metal free dyes squaraines are well known for intense absorption in the NIR region and flexibility for synthetic modifications. Most of these dyes were synthesized by the condensation of squaric acid with various kinds of aromatic and heterocyclic compounds. A range of squaraine dyes, both symmetrical and unsymmetrical, have been reported as efficient sensitizers for DSSCs. Alex et al. in 2005 initiated the studies on unsymmetrical squaraine dyes and showed that the unidirectional electron flow from the donor to the acceptor is more promoted in unsymmetrical squaraines than symmetrical squaraines where the excited state electron density used to get localized more on the cyclobutene ring. Recently Grätzel's group reported 7.3% efficiency for a particular class of unsymmetrical squaraines.
In the present paper, we report the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic performance of two unsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers. These dyes are characterized by a carbazole thiophene donor unit and an indolium acceptor unit. Further, a carboxylic acid moiety is used as an anchoring group to bind these dyes to the TiO2 surface. Carbazole moieties are proved to be efficient electron donor groups for enhancing the light harvesting capability of sensitizers in metal containing and metal free DSSCs. A spacer incorporated between the carbazole donor and an acceptor unit can further increase the molar extinction coefficient of these systems. For the dyes reported here, a squaraine moiety is used as a spacer between the carbazole thiophene donor and an indolium acceptor thereby reaching molar absorptivities better than metal complex dyes.
The parent squaraine dye CTSQ-2 co-sensitized with the triphenylamine dye (TPD) was reported by Gräf et al. in 2013 for the application in solid state DSSCs which gave an efficiency of 2.43% using spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transporting material. CTSQ-2 with an excited state much close to the TiO2 conduction band leaves little driving force for electron injection in DSSCs (Scheme 2). Surprisingly a slight modification of the peripheral carbazole by removing the tertiary butyl groups increased the driving force by 90 mV for the novel CTSQ-1 dye giving an overall better performance in comparison to CTSQ-2. The effect of electron injection was monitored using current–voltage (J–V), incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), lifetime and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements through judicious modulation of the conduction band edge by having various Li+ concentrations in the electrolyte. Increased Li+ concentration will result in a downward shifting of the TiO2 conduction band edge resulting in better injection and decreased open-circuit voltage. Theoretical calculations were carried out to have a detailed understanding of the ground and excited state electron density distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of carbazole thiophene donor appended unsymmetrical squaraine dyes in liquid state dye-sensitized solar cells.

FTO obtained from Dyesol were prepared for TiO2 deposition by a stepwise cleaning procedure using detergent, distilled water, acetone and isopropanol by sonication and finally by UV-O3 treatment and TiCl4 deposition which was done by immersing electrodes into a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with distilled water and ethanol. The photoanodes were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling, transparent TiO2 paste having a particle size of 20 nm was deposited followed by annealing at 125 °C for 10 min. TiO2 paste consisting larger TiO2 particles (ca. 400 nm, Dyesol) was coated on top of the first layer and annealed at 125 °C for 10 min. This was followed again by TiCl4 treatment and annealing. The electrodes were then put into programmed heating at 325 °C for 15 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 30 min and slowly cooled down to room temperature and electrodes were immersed into a squaraine dye solution in a CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) mixture with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (10 mM) and kept at room temperature for 15 h. Counter electrodes were prepared by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of Pt in 1 mL ethanol) on FTO plates having pre-drilled holes and cleaned using the same procedure as for photoanodes, the only difference being washing done by using acidified ethanol (0.1 N HCl in ethanol). The dye adsorbed TiO2 electrodes and Pt counter electrodes were assembled with hot press using a 25 μm surlyn spacer. The space in between both the electrodes were filled with a liquid I−/I3− electrolyte which was composed of various compositions of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), lithium iodide (LiI), iodine (I2), guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tbp) in acetonitrile. The drilled holes were sealed with a microscopic cover slide and surlyn to avoid electrolyte leakage. Three cells were fabricated for each condition and the cells were measured after keeping them for 12 h in the dark.

The photovoltaic performance of the fabricated DSSCs was measured using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Newport Instruments, USA) equipped with a source meter (Keithley 2400) at 25 °C. The IPCE measurement of the devices was performed under a DC mode using a 250W xenon lamp coupled with a Newport monochromator. A monochromatic beam was continuously irradiating on the sample and the current was measured using a Keithley 6430 source meter. A NIST calibrated Si photodiode was used to find the incident power spectral response of the light. The J–V properties of cells were measured using a square shade mask with an active area of 0.25 cm2 (without the mask, the active area is 0.36 cm2). The power of the simulated sunlight was calibrated by using a reference Si photodiode supplied by Newport instruments. Open circuit voltage (Voc) decay measurements are done at an open circuit. The cell was in the dark at the beginning of the measurement, and then the lights were turned on until the voltage got stabilized, followed by switching the light off and recording the decay of photovoltage. Lifetime data were transformed from the voltage decay part of the measurement through previously reported methods. The EIS measurements of DSSCs were carried out using a micro Autolab (μ3AUT70904) equipped with a FRA mode under forward bias in the dark. The measurements were performed in a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV.

The synthetic details with molecular structures for both squaraine sensitizers (CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2) are represented in Scheme 1. In order to facilitate efficient electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 and to have a better adsorption on the semiconductor surface both squaraine dyes were designed in such a way to have a carboxyl group positioned on the indolium acceptor part. Even though carbazole was used as an efficient electron donor in metal-free organic dyes and metal complex dyes, their use as a suitable donor in unsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers for DSSCs has not been much explored. So we designed and synthesized two unsymmetrical squaraine dyes appended with carbazole thiophene (CTSQ-1) and substituted carbazole thiophene with electron donating tertiary butyl groups on the peripheral carbazole unit (CTSQ-2) for the application in dye-sensitized solar cells. In both these dyes the carbazole linked thiophene unit functioned as the electron donor component whereas an N-carboxyethyl quarternized indolium moiety acted as the electron acceptor part. The chemical structure of CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 differ only in their substitution at the 3,6 positions of the carbazole moiety.

For the synthesis of CTSQ-1, initially, carbazole and 2-bromothiophene were made to undergo a C–N coupling reaction using (±)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane and CuI as catalysts in 1,4-dioxane to form 9-(thiophene-2yl)-9H-carbazole. Squarylium chloride was synthesized by refluxing squaric acid with thionyl chloride in benzene and a catalytic amount of DMF. The C–N coupled product 9-(thiophene-2yl)-9H-carbazole was made to react with squarylium chloride in the presence of benzene for 6 h resulting in the formation of semisquaryl chloride, which was followed by hydrolysis using triethylamine and 2N HCl to form semisquaraine. The second precursor for squaraine (5-carboxy-2,3,3-trimethyl-1-ethyl-3H-indolium iodide) was prepared by Fisher Indole synthesis using p-phenyl hydrazine benzoic acid and isopropyl ketone in the presence of glacial acetic acid using sodium acetate as a base to form 2,3,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-5-carboxylic acid. Indole acid, thus obtained, was alkylated by treatment with ethyl iodide in the presence of dry acetonitrile to form 5-carboxy-1-ethyl-2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium. Squaraine reaction was then carried out by condensation between carbazole thiophene semisquaraine and alkylated indolium acid using a benzene/butanol (1:1) mixture to form CTSQ-1. For CTSQ-2 the procedure followed was exactly the same as that of CTSQ-1, the only difference being Friedel–Crafts alkylation carried out in order to substitute the peripheral carbazole ligand with tertiary butyl groups. The squaraine dyes formed were purified by column chromatography using a 3% methanol/dichloromethane mixture couple of times until the squaraine dyes are completely pure. Each step of the above reactions was fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass data (Fig. S9–S17, ESI).

The absorption spectra of CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 in a CH2Cl2 solution are shown in Fig. 1(a), and the characteristic data are summarized in Table 1. Both the dyes exhibited intense and sharp absorption in the visible-NIR region ranging from 500–700 nm. For CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2, the absorption maxima in DCM were found at 605 nm (ε = 31800 M−1 cm−1) and 637 nm (ε = 56858 M−1 cm−1) respectively. The red-shift in the absorption spectra of CTSQ-2 in comparison to CTSQ-1 happens since the electron donating tertiary butyl groups on the peripheral carbazole donor stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) thereby reducing the energy gap. The absorption spectra of both squaraine sensitizers in solution and on the TiO2 film are compared in Fig. 1(b). The absorption spectra of both dyes on TiO2 electrodes are broad which clearly shows the increased interaction between the dyes and TiO2. It is quite apparent from Fig. 1(b) that there is a blue-shift in the absorption maxima which is mainly due to the deprotonation between the carboxylic acid and TiO2 semiconductor. The dyes exhibited fluorescence emission at 666 nm for CTSQ-1 and 688 nm for CTSQ-2 in DCM (Fig. S3, ESI). Lifetime decay plots for CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 in DCM are given in Fig. S6 (ESI).

The electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry in order to gain more understanding on ground and excited state potentials of CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 sensitizers and to evaluate the possibility of photoelectron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 and regeneration of the oxidized ground state of squaraine dyes by the electrolyte (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI). The measurements were performed in a DCM solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using Ag/AgCl reference electrode that was calibrated with ferrocene. All the potentials measured were converted to NHE considering Fc/Fc+ to be +0.765 V vs. NHE in DCM. To bring about efficient charge separation, the ground state oxidation potential of dyes should be more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (0.40 V vs. NHE) to have efficient regeneration, and the excited state oxidation potential of dyes should be more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2, Ecb (−0.5 V vs. NHE) to have efficient injection. The ground state oxidation potentials Eox correspond to the HOMO levels and were, respectively, 1.19 V and 1.21 V for CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 (Table 1). The excited state oxidation potentials can be calculated from the values of ground state oxidation potential and the zero-zero band gaps (E0–0) determined by the intersection of absorption and emission spectra in DCM (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI). The estimated E0–0 is 1.93 V and 1.86 V for CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 respectively. Subsequently the excited state oxidation potentials for CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 calculated from Eox − E0–0 are −0.74 V and −0.65 V vs. NHE respectively. The excited state levels were only slightly more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) resulting in a diminished driving force for electron injection from the excited state of squaraine dyes into the conduction band of TiO2.


To have a deeper insight into the geometrical structures and electronic properties of CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the M06/6-311G(d,p) level using a Gaussian 09 program. The electron distribution of both the HOMO and LUMO levels are given in Fig. 2. The HOMO for both CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 are delocalized over the carbazole thiophene and central cyclobutene core whereas the LUMO orbitals are distributed over the thiophene ring, cyclobutene core and indolium acceptor unit. The charge transfer in both CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 is less efficient since the electron density in the LUMO for both dyes are not concentrated on the acceptor part but distributed over a wider range of π-spacers. For efficient electron injection to happen from the excited state dyes to the conduction band of TiO2, the LUMOs should be distributed as close as to the anchoring groups in order to have efficient overlap with the titanium 3d orbitals that will instigate electron injection. The optimized geometry with bond lengths are given in the ESI (Fig. S8). CTSQ-2 with electron donating t-butyl groups resulted in a decrease of the carbazole thiophene bond length. The dihedral angles between the carbazole and thiophene units are quite similar for both the dyes with 50° for CTSQ-1 and 47° for CTSQ-2 while the rest of the π-conjugated portion of the dye is coplanar. This suggests that both CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 possess similar geometrical features, and the carbazole moiety is mainly responsible for maintaining an overall non-planar geometry of these dyes.


The photovoltaic properties consisting of a short-circuit current density (Jsc), an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), a fill factor (FF) and a total power conversion efficiency (μ) of solar cells fabricated with TiO2 photoelectrodes sensitized with CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 having I−/I3− as the electrolyte is summarized in Table 2. The J–V characteristics and IPCE spectra of devices are illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (b) respectively. Under the same fabrication conditions DSSCs based on CTSQ-1 showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.94% with Jsc = 8.42 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.53 V and FF = 0.65 under AM 1.5 irradiation. CTSQ-2 sensitized solar cells fabricated under similar conditions with the same electrolyte composition (EL1) displayed a relatively lower photovoltaic efficiency of 2.23% (μ) with Jsc = 6.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.52 V and FF = 0.64 which is mainly attributed to the lower Jsc value. The IPCE spectra also exhibited a similar trend with CTSQ-1 having comparatively better performance than CTSQ-2. It is quite obvious from Scheme 2 that in both the squaraine sensitizers the LUMO levels are placed at potentials much closer to the conduction band edge of TiO2. It is legitimate that the injection of excited electrons from the sensitizers into the conduction band of TiO2 is expected to be incompetent leading to lower IPCE maxima for both CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2. Out of which CTSQ-1 having the LUMO positioned 90 mV more negative to CTSQ-2 exhibited better current density and IPCE performance that is justifiable based on increased driving force for electron injection.

In liquid state DSSCs, Li salts are usually added to have a tunability of the Fermi level in such a way to enhance the injection driving force. The effect of electron injection is followed in detail for CTSQ-1 by varying the Li+ concentration in the electrolyte. As the concentration of Li+ in the electrolyte increases that will tentatively push the conduction band edge more positive leading to enhanced driving force for electron injection as reported by O'Regan and Durrant which will ultimately result in getting a better current density and IPCE profile. As shown in Fig. 3(a), when we systematically increased the Li+ concentration from 0.1 M to 1 M the current density got elevated from 8.42 mA cm−2 to 10.21 mA cm−2, but the net efficiency decreased as a result of voltage drop since photovoltage is measured as the difference of the Nernst potential of the electrolyte and the Fermi level of the semiconductor which is pushed more positive later by higher Li+ concentration resulting in voltage drop. The IPCE data obtained (Fig. 3(b)) also complimented this argument.
The IPCE can be expressed in terms of light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency (Φing), regeneration efficiency (ηreg) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) as given by eqn (1).
IPCE (λ) = LHE (λ) × Φing × ηreg × ηcc

Table 2, by having the same dye (CTSQ-1), the same semiconductor (TiO2) and the same electrolyte (I−/I3−) we can assume that the LHE, ηreg and ηcc to be unity. The change in IPCE can thus be tracked directly to the change in injection driving force, which is modulated by pushing the conduction band edge more positive by having more Li+ concentrations in the electrolyte. From the IPCE spectra given in Fig. 3(b), it is visible that as we change the electrolyte from EL1 to EL3 the IPCE maximum increased by almost 10–15%. This shows that even though CTSQ-2 has a better absorption profile in comparison to CTSQ-1, the former dye is injection limited, which ultimately resulted in a lower photovoltaic performance.

The IPCE spectra with varying amounts of LiI displayed that as the concentration of Li+ increases there is more broadening of the spectra at the higher energy region that might be due to the formation of H-aggregates as observed in the solution state with similar kinds of systems. H-aggregation involves a plane to plane alignment that is dominated by molecules having less steric effects. More detailed insight into the effect of aggregation on photovoltaic parameters is outside the scope of the current paper and will be reported in detail elsewhere. State of the art squaraine sensitizers reported by Grätzel et al. used an electrolyte composition given as EL4 having only 0.05 M LiI and 0.25 M tbp. The presence of tbp resulted in shifting of the conduction band edge to more negative potentials thereby impeding electron injection from CTSQ-1 to the semiconductor ensuing lesser current density and lower IPCE values (entry 4 in Table 2). A commercial electrolyte from Dyesol (EL5) was used for comparison (entry 5 in Table 2) which gave very poor performance in comparison to homemade electrolytes with the squaraine sensitizers, which might be due to the presence of excess tbp as explained for EL4 (Fig. S7, ESI). Since squaraine sensitizers are reported to exhibit aggregation at higher concentration we fabricated devices with CTSQ-1 where the concentration of the dye solution was taken to be 0.05 M (entry 6 in Table 2), half the concentration of that of the best performing devices using the electrolyte composition EL1 which resulted in a Jsc of 5.90 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.52 V, FF of 0.68 and a net efficiency of 2.11% which is less than the performance of devices fabricated under similar conditions using 0.1 M of the dye solution (entry 1 in Table 2) which is attributed to lesser dye loading (Fig. S7, ESI). This shows that aggregation is not playing significant roles in the photovoltaic performance of solar cells fabricated using CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 sensitizers.
The electron lifetime plots for both CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 are given in Fig. 4(a). CTSQ-2 with peripheral t-butyl groups was expected to prevent recombination to a better extent than CTSQ-1, but the results obtained (Fig. 4(a)) displayed better lifetime for CTSQ-1 in comparison to CTSQ-2. CTSQ-1 with a higher LUMO level resulted in better injection thereby preventing recombination and having a better lifetime.

Fig. 4(b) shows the electron lifetime plots for CTSQ-1 in four different electrolytes with variable Li+ additive compositions. It is discussed already from J–V and IPCE data (Fig. 3) that increasing the concentration of Li+ in the electrolyte will result in shifting of the conduction band edge more positive thereby improving the driving force for electron injection. This shift of the conduction band edge and surface states closer to the redox potential of the electrolyte leads to more recombinations and reduced lifetime for devices having higher Li+ concentration. Kopidakis et al. had already reported that intercalation of Li+ into the nanocrystalline TiO2 will result in increased charge recombinations thereby resulting in decreased lifetime. The lifetime shown in Fig. 4(b) decreased in the order EL3 < EL2 < EL1. This is also supported by the drop in photovoltage on moving from EL1 to EL3. For devices fabricated with higher tbp concentration (EL4, entry 4 in Table 2) the conduction band edge was displaced to more negative potentials thereby preventing recombinations resulting in better lifetime and photovoltage.
EIS analysis of CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 sensitized DSSCs were performed in order to elucidate the interfacial charge recombination process in DSSCs based on these dyes under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 5(a) the major semicircle for each dye in the EIS Nyquist plot corresponds to the resistance of electron transport at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface which implies the resistance of recombination between electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and oxidized I3− species in the electrolyte. The larger the semicircle, slower the recombination kinetics. It is evident from the Nyquist plot that CTSQ-2 even with terminal tertiary butyl groups exhibited lesser recombination resistance that is most likely due to the lower driving force for electron injection. This trend is consistent with the lifetime plots and Voc values of the cells. In bode plots (Fig. 5(b)), the peaks at middle frequency are associated with the charge transfer resistances at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The electron lifetime are correlated with the reciprocal of the peak frequency for middle-frequency peaks. The peak for CTSQ-2 is right shifted compared to CTSQ-1 exhibiting a lower electron lifetime. Overall, based on the above results we believe that carbazole thiophene can be used as an efficient donor for unsymmetrical squaraine dyes but its excited state energetics need to be modified in such a way to have enough driving force for electron injection. This leaves further space for improvement by having more electron withdrawing units at the peripheral carbazole group. Detailed investigation of injection kinetics using a femtosecond laser along with studies on the effect of Li+ concentration on the electron diffusion length and TiO2 band gap state distribution using EIS measurements are currently under investigation.

In conclusion, we have synthesized two unsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers incorporating carbazole thiophene (CTSQ-1) and t-butyl substituted carbazole thiophene (CTSQ-2) as electron donor units linked to an indolium acceptor and applied in DSSCs. It has been demonstrated that we can readily tune the LUMO energy levels of these unsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers by modifying the substituent on the peripheral carbazole unit. Both CTSQ-1 and CTSQ-2 exhibited intense absorption in the visible-NIR region. Best devices gave a power conversion efficiency of 2.94% for CTSQ-1 and 2.23% for CTSQ-2 sensitized solar cells using an I−/I3− redox electrolyte. Even though carbazole thiophene is an excellent donor unsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers having this donor resulted in lack of enough driving force for electron injection. A mere modification of the peripheral carbazole unit helped in improving the injection driving force. CTSQ-1 with better excited state energetics is having higher injection driving force and is more successful in preventing recombinations compared to CTSQ-2, which is evident from lifetime and EIS measurements leading to better solar cell performance for CTSQ-1 compared to CTSQ-2. Even though CTSQ-1 performed better than CTSQ-2 the lack of excited state electron density distribution near to the anchoring group coupled with the lack of enough driving force for electron injection resulted in efficiencies lower than that of state of the art unsymmetrical squaraine dyes.
