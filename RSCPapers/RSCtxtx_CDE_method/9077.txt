A new electron-acceptor, thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT), is designed for the first time to construct donor–acceptor copolymers with bithienyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) as an electron-donor unit for polymer solar cells (PSCs). Compared with their analogous polymers, which contain a similar conjugated backbone but with the benzotriazole (BTAZ) unit as the acceptor, the BTAZT-based polymers show evident red-shifted absorption with narrower optical band gaps due to the fusion of the thiophene moiety onto the BTAZ unit to further stabilize the quinoid structure of their conjugation backbones. Furthermore, two types of side-chain groups, the alkylcarboxyl group (in PBDTT-BTAZT-1) or alkylcarbonyl group (in PBDTT-BTAZT-2), are introduced to adjust the energy levels and modulate the solubility of the PBDTT-BTAZT based polymers. It is found that the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the alkylcarboxyl group relative to that of the alkoxycarbonyl group at the α-position of the fused thiophene can further reduce the HOMO energy level to enhance the open voltage (Voc) in the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based device. PSC devices based on these two polymers as electron-donating materials and a fullerene derivative (PC71BM) as an electron-accepting material are fabricated, and device optimization with additives (DIO or NMP) to modify the morphologies of the active layers and cathode buffer layers (PDIN or PDINO) to modify the cathode interlayers is investigated. The best PCE of approximately 7% is obtained for the PBDTT-BTAZT-1 based device with the DIO additive and PDIN-modified cathode interlayer. Notably, its optimal short circuit current density reaches 14.41 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest values ever reported in BTAZ-based PSCs with a PCBM acceptor. The best PCE of the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based device also reaches 6.16% with the NMP additive and PDINO-modified cathode interlayer.

Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn continuous attention due to their light-weight, low-cost and promising application in the production of large-area and flexible photovoltaic devices. In recent years, PSCs have experienced great progress in their power conversion efficiencies of up to 11–12%, which is attributed to the successful and powerful molecular design strategy of D–A (donor–acceptor) copolymers as electron-donating materials mixed with electron-accepting materials (such as PCBM) to build the active layer in PSC devices. Through rational structural modification of donor and acceptor units, their molecular energy levels, absorption spectra and optical band gaps as well as solubility in organic solvents and morphologies in the solid state can be appropriately tuned and regulated, which is very important to improve the photovoltaic performances of PSCs. Therefore, the design of novel donor and acceptor building blocks has always been one of the most important research works to build D–A polymers for highly efficient PSCs. Thus far, several types of electron acceptors, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), benzothiadiazole (BT), quinoxaline (Qx), benzotriazole (BTAZ) and benzodithiophenedione (T1), have been developed to construct conjugated polymers in PSCs with excellent photovoltaic performances.

As an acceptor (A), benzotriazole has moderate electron-withdrawing ability, and thus it can be used to build medium or wide band-gap conjugated polymers. Generally, BTAZ based polymers show absorption spectra in the region of 300–700 nm, which is not very efficient for sunlight harvesting and thus promoting the photocurrent. It has been proven that stabilizing the population of the electronic quinoid state can reduce the band gap of D–A conjugated systems, which is an effective strategy to make full use of the sunlight and thereby improve the photocurrent in PSCs. For example, Yu designed a thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene (TT) unit via the fusion of a thiophene ring into another thiophene unit connected in the backbone that successfully promoted the quinoid population of the thiophene backbone to reduce the band gap of polymers. In addition, the introduction of electron-withdrawing side-chains, such as carboxyl groups, on the TT unit can also lower the HOMO energy level of the polymers. Using this strategy, Hou et al. demonstrated that the substitution of the carboxyl group by ketone or sulfonyl groups onto the TT unit can modulate the HOMO level of the PTB-7 series polymers and greatly improve their photovoltaic performances with higher open-circuit voltages (Voc) and PCE.
Recently, our group designed a novel acceptor, thiophene fused benzothiadiazole (BTT), to build D–A copolymers for highly efficient PSCs. By fusing a thiophene ring at the side of the BT unit, the quinoid population of the D–A conjugation backbone can be promoted due to the aromaticity of the fused thiophene unit, which effectively broadens the absorption spectra and promotes the short circuit current density (Jsc). In this study, we design another new acceptor, the thiophene fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit, to build D–A copolymers for PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1, in which the aromaticity of the side-fused thiophene can stabilize the quinoid structure of the conjugated backbone and strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer to extend the absorption band for efficient light harvesting, thus improving the photocurrent of PSCs. Herein, we present the synthesis of the BTAZT unit and two corresponding D–A copolymers with BTAZT as the acceptor and BDTT as the donor, in which two different electron-withdrawing side-chains, the alkoxycarbonyl group or alkylcarbonyl group, are introduced at the α-position of the side-fused thiophene ring. We also investigate the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the polymers, and the photovoltaic performances of their PSC devices in detail.

In order to extend the absorption spectrum and regulate the energy levels of BTAZ-based D–A polymers for better photovoltaic performances, we consider modifying the structure of the benzotriazole (BTAZ) unit by fusing a thiophene ring at the side of the BTAZ unit, in which the quinoid population of the conjugated backbone can be stabilized because of the aromaticity of the side-fused thiophene ring. This structural modification will strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer and reduce the optical band gap, and thus effectively harvest the sunlight and improve the photocurrent of PSCs. At the same time, an electron-withdrawing group, such as an alkoxycarbonyl or alkylcarbonyl group, as a side-chain introduced onto BTAZT can improve its solubility and partially reduce its HOMO energy level. Generally, better solubility is conducive to increase the molecular weight of polymers with better solution processability, and the lower HOMO energy level of the electron-donating materials is thought to enhance the Voc of their PSCs.

The proposed synthetic routes for the BTAZT unit and two polymers are shown in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. The detailed synthetic procedures for BTAZT-1, BTAZT-2, PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and PBDTT-BTAZT-2, as well as some intermediate compounds, are presented in the ESI.
To fuse a thiophene ring with an alkylcarbonyl side-chain onto the BTAZ unit, S-(4-ethyl-2-oxooctyl)ethanethioate (VIII-3) was synthesized, as shown in Scheme 1. Initially, acetyl chloride was reacted with the Grignard reagent of 3-(bromomethyl)heptane to produce 3-ethylheptan-2-one (VIII-1), followed by bromination of VIII-1 with Br2 to yield 1-bromo-3-ethylheptan-2-one (VIII-2), which was converted to VIII-3 by nucleophilic substitution with potassium ethanethioate. 5-Bromo-2-(2-ethylhexyl)-6-methyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (VIII-5) was obtained according to the literature by the oxidation and cyclization of 4-bromo-5-methylbenzene-1,2-diamine with NaNO2 and then the alkylation of VIII-4. Benzylic bromination was implemented by treating VIII-5 with NBS and AIBN (azodiisobutyronitrile) to yield VIII-6. The key intermediate VIII-7 was obtained by the treatment of VIII-6 with AgNO3. Afterwards, the fusion of the thiophene ring onto the benzotriazole unit to yield thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) derivatives, BTAZT-1 (VIII-8) and BTAZT-2 (VIII-9), was easily performed by the cyclization of VIII-7 with 2-ethylhexyl 2-mercaptoacetate and S-(4-ethyl-2-oxooctyl)ethanethioate (VIII-3), respectively. The thiophene-substituted BTAZT derivatives (VIII-12 and VIII-13) were obtained via the Stille coupling of tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane with dibrominated VIII-10 or VIII-11, which were obtained by the bromination of VIII-8 or VIII-9 with Br2. Finally, the bromination of VIII-12 or VIII-13 with NBS gave VIII-14 or VIII-15 as monomers. All the compounds were characterized via NMR, MS and elemental analysis.
The two polymers, PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and PBDTT-BTAZT-2, were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction of (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (BDTT) with the BTAZT monomers (VIII-14 or VIII-15) (shown in Scheme 2). The number average molecular weights of the polymers determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were over 30 kg mol−1 due to their improved solubility. The corresponding results are shown in Table 1. The thermal stability of the polymers was measured via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). They show much high thermal stability with 5% weight loss beyond 380 °C (see Fig. S1 in the ESI).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and PBDTT-BTAZT-2 in a diluted chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, these two polymers show similar absorption spectra with three absorption bands (band I, 300–400 nm; band II, 400–500 nm and band III, 500–800 nm). The absorption bands in the 300–500 nm region could be assigned to the π–π* electron transition of the localized conjugated backbone. The other strong and broad absorption band occurring above 500 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient is attributed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Compared with their analogues based on BTAZ with a similar conjugation backbone, the absorption spectra are greatly red shifted, which can be attributed to the fact that the fusion of the thiophene ring stabilizes the quinoid structure and strengthens the ICT. In addition, due to the stronger electron withdrawing ability of the carbonyl group compared to that of the carboxyl group, the ICT absorption maximum of PBDTT-BTAZT-2 is slightly red-shifted by about 20 nm compared with PBDTT-BTAZT-1.


Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and PBDTT-BTAZT-2 in thin films. From solution to the solid state, their absorption is evidently red-shifted. Different from the absorption in solution, these two polymers exhibit similar absorption spectra in the solid state; however PBDTT-BTAZT-1 exhibits a slightly higher absorption coefficient than PBDTT-BTAZT-2, which indicates that PBDTT-BTAZT-1 can absorb and harvest sunlight more efficiently in the solid state. Their optical band gaps are estimated to be 1.65 and 1.63 eV, respectively, from the absorption onset edges (PBDTT-BTAZT-1 of 753 nm and PBDTT-BTAZT-2 of 759 nm) of the thin films, which are much narrower than those of the BTAZ-based copolymers with a similar conjugated backbone previously reported, indicating that they would absorb and harvest sunlight more effectively in the visible region, which is conducive to improve the photocurrent for their PSCs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed to estimate the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and PBDTT-BTAZT-2. The CV curves are shown in Fig. 4, and the detailed electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. It is found that the HOMO energy level is slightly higher than that of the BTAZ-based polymer with a similar conjugated backbone due to the fusion of thiophene onto the BTAZ unit. For these two polymers, PBDTT-BTAZT-2 exhibits lower lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels than PBDTT-BTAZT-1 owing to the stronger electron-affinity of the carbonyl group than the carboxyl group. The lower HOMO energy level is beneficial for enhancing the Voc of the PSC devices.

Conventional solar cell devices were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performances of PBDTT-BTAZT polymer-based devices. Optimized performances were obtained by adjusting the blend ratio of polymer/PC71BM and changing the thickness of the active layer as well as using DIO (1,8-diiodooctane) or NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) as additives to optimize the morphologies of the active layers. The relevant current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the polymer solar cells are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 2. First, the weight ratio of the polymer, as the electron donating material (p-type semiconducting material), to PC71BM, as the electron accepting material (n-type semiconducting material) (p/n ratio), was optimized. It is found that the optimized p/n ratio for PBDTT-BTAZT-1 is about 1:1 and for PBDTT-BTAZT-2 is about 1:2. At the optimal p/n ratio, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PBDTT-BTAZT-1 based device reaches 5.79% with a Jsc of 13.74 mA cm−2, FF of 58.2%, and Voc of 0.72 V. As expected, the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 (with the carbonyl side group) based PSC device shows a slightly higher Voc of 0.75 V than PBDTT-BTAZT-1 (with the carboxyl group) based device because of its lower HOMO energy level relative to that of PBDTT-BTAZT-1. However, the Jsc of the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based device is only 10.00 mA cm−2, which is smaller than that of PBDTT-BTAZT-1 (Jsc = 13.74 mA cm−2), and thus its best PCE of 4.51% is also lower than that of PBDTT-BTAZT-1.

Generally, some high boiling point solvents can be used as a processing additive to optimize the morphology of the active layers in PSCs to improve their photovoltaic performances. In this study, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) were chosen as the solvent additives to optimize the morphology. It is found that the DIO additive is helpful for improving the performances of the BTAZT-BDTT-1 based devices. When 1% DIO was added, the fill factor (FF) of the PBDTT-BTAZT-1 based device reached 64.3%, which was larger than that (58.2%) without DIO. Therefore, the PCE the PBDTT-BTAZT-1 based device was increased to 6.32%, although its Jsc of 13.65 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.72 V were slightly lower than those of the device without DIO. However, the DIO additive had no effect on the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based devices. Then, NMP as an alternative additive was used for the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 based devices. Using 3% NMP as a solvent additive, the PCE of PBDTT-BTAZT-2 increases to 5.04% with a Voc of 0.76 V, FF of 65.6% and Jsc of 10.09 mA cm−2. The influence of the additive concentration on device fabrication is presented in detail in the ESI (Table S2). In addition, it is found that the devices of the two PBDTT-BTAZT polymers exhibit comparable fill factors, which may be attributed to their comparable hole-mobilities of 7.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and PBDTT-BTAZT-2, respectively, as measured using the space charge limit current (SCLC) method (shown in Fig. S5, ESI).

Fig. 7a–d show the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the PBDTT-BTAZT polymer/PC71BM blend film as the active layer in the corresponding PSC devices with or without the additive. As can be seen in Fig. 7a and c, the effect of the DIO additive can be clearly visualized from the AFM images for the PBDTT-BTAZT-1/PC71BM blend film. Without DIO, the composite film exhibits microscale phase separation with a root mean square (RMS) value of 0.45 nm, which is not beneficial for efficient exciton separation. When DIO was added to the blend, the RMS value of the PBDTT-BTAZT-1/PC71BM blend film increased to 3.33 nm. The larger RMS value suggests proper aggregation of the donor/acceptor domains, which is conducive to improve the exciton dissociation and carrier collection efficiency. Thus, the FF was greatly increased from 53% to 63%, and the best PCE reached 6.32%. As for PBDTT-BTAZT-2, the RMS value for the PBDTT-BTAZT-2/PC71BM blend film was only about 0.42 without NMP (Fig. 7b). After the addition of the NMP additive, the RMS value increased to 0.51 nm. Although the increment of the RMS value is limited, the morphology of the nanoscale phase-separation seems to become more dense and orderly, and thus the FF of the PSC device is also greatly improved (from 55% to 64%) and the best PCE reaches 5.04% (with NMP).
Recently, two easy-accessible small-molecules based on a perylene diimide core with an amino (PDIN) or amino N-oxide (PDINO) terminal substituent (Fig. S6, ESI) have been successfully developed by Zhang et al. to modify the cathode in PSCs. In this study, PDIN and PDINO are also applied trying to modify the cathode interlayer and further improve the performance of the devices. The corresponding photovoltaic performances of the PSCs based on the PBDTT-BTAZT polymers modified by different electron extraction layers are summarized in Table S4 in the ESI. After optimization, the devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/PDIN/Al for PBDTT-BTAZT-1 and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/PDINO/Al for PBDTT-BTAZT-2 show the best PCE. The relevant current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the polymer solar cells are shown in Fig. 6 and 8, respectively, and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. As shown, PBDTT-BTAZT-2 exhibits an increased PCE of 6.16% with a Jsc of 12.53 mA cm−2, FF of 65.8%, and Voc of 0.75 V by using the PDINO-modified cathode interlayer. At the same time, when PDIN was used to modify the cathode interlayer, PBDTT-BTAZT-1 exhibits the best PCE of 6.95%, with a Jsc of 14.41 mA cm−2, FF of 64.3% and Voc of 0.75 V. Particularly, the Jsc of 14.41 mA cm−2 is one of the highest Jsc values among the BTAZT-based polymers with a PCBM acceptor.
The different Jsc values for the two polymers in the PSCs were identified using the EQE curves, as shown in Fig. 8. PBDTT-BTAZT-1 shows a photo-response in the range of 300–800 nm and its EQE is further improved with the modification of the cathode interlayer by PDIN, where a relatively high EQE over 60% is observed. Compared with PBDTT-BTAZT-1, PBDTT-BTAZT-2 exhibits a lower photo-response in the range of 300–800 nm, particularly, in the range of 500–750 nm. However, the modification of the cathode interlayer by PDINO can certainly strengthen the photo-response in the 500–750 nm region, and thus the EQE and Jsc are greatly improved.

In this study, a thiophene fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit has been designed as a new acceptor to build D–A copolymers with an alkoxycarbonyl side-chain (PBDTT-BTAZT-1) or an alkylcarbonyl side-chain (PBDTT-BTAZT-2) for PSC application. By fusing a thiophene ring onto the benzotriazole (BTAZ) unit, the quinoid population of the conjugation backbone can be stabilized and the intramolecular charge transfer can be strengthened. In contrast to the BTAZ-based polymer with a similar conjugated backbone, the PBDTT-BTAZT polymers exhibit more broadened absorption bands with smaller optical band gaps, which improve their sunlight harvesting capability. In addition, the introduction of a weak electron-withdrawing flexible group (such as alkoxylcarbonyl or alkylcarbonyl group) into the fused thiophene ring could partially modulate the HOMO–LUMO energy level, which is conducive to the enhancement of Voc. Through optimization with the addition of DIO or NMP additives and the modification of the cathode layer with PDIN or PDINO, the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs are greatly improved. The best PCE of approximately 7% is obtained for the PBDTT-BTAZT-1 based device using PDIN as the cathode interlayer. Notably, its Jsc reaches 14.41 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest values ever reported in BTAZ-based PSCs with a PCBM acceptor. The best PCE of the PBDTT-BTAZT-2 device also reaches 6.16%. Our results confirm that the strategy of fusing a thiophene ring on traditional acceptor units is an effective way to regulate their energy levels and absorption spectra, and thus improve their photovoltaic performances in PSC devices. Moreover, our results suggest that the newly developed thiophene fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) is a promising acceptor for the construction of semiconductors for PSC applications.
