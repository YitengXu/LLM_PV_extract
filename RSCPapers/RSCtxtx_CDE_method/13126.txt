A series of polymers based on 6-(2-thienyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (TTI), a new electron-rich unit for organic photovoltaics, was synthesized. By replacing the six-membered benzene ring of the carbazole with an electron-rich five-membered thiophene ring, an enhanced ICT effect between the electron-rich group and the electron-deficient group is expected to result in improved π-electron delocalization, low band gap and increased light-harvesting ability of the OPVs. The TTI unit, with a fused rigid backbone, has an efficient structure for the ICT effect and for tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels to generate a low band gap. As electron-deficient units, 4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT-h), 2-dimethyl-4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2H-benzimidazole (DTMBI) and 3,6-di(2-thienyl)-2,5 dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) were introduced by using Stille polymerization. PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP have low band gaps and show absorption up to 849 and 948 nm, respectively. The highest PCE was achieved with the device fabricated from a PTTIDTBT-h:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) blend with 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) as an additive. The device demonstrated a Voc value of 0.81 V, a Jsc value of 8.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.51, giving a highest power conversion efficiency of 3.35%.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have been steadily explored as a substitute for amorphous silicon solar cells by utilizing the advantages of flexibility, low cost and light weight, and the possibility of large area fabrication. For the practical commercialization of this technology, it is necessary to adapt diversified new tactics for processing conditions, device architectures and polymer structures. In the design of electron donors with polymeric structures, ideal properties such as a broad absorption range with a low band gap, high hole mobility, and optimized morphology should be improved for the better performance of the device. The push–pull type of conjugated polymers, using electron-rich and electron-deficient units, has been successfully constructed to induce intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) for the improvement of absorbance in the longer wavelength region. Planar π-conjugated building blocks have been used for this type of conjugated polymer, since π-electron delocalization and charge transfer can be facilitated. Even though quite a few electron-rich moieties, such as benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene, carbazole and dithienothiophene, have been incorporated in low band gap polymers for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), exploiting a new electron-rich moiety is a significant issue for the improvement of the ICT. In this paper, 6-(2-thienyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (TTI) is reported for the first time as an electron-rich unit (Scheme 1) for OPVs. In TTI, one of the benzene rings of carbazole is substituted with thiophene. By replacing the six-membered benzene ring of the carbazole with an electron-rich five-membered thiophene ring, increased planarity between the electron-rich group and the electron-deficient group, leading to the enhancement of the ICT effect, is expected to result in improved π-electron delocalization, low band gap and increased light harvesting ability of the OPVs. When coupled with electron-deficient units, such as 4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT-h), 2-dimethyl-4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2H-benzimidazole (DTMBI) and 3,6-di(2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP), the TTI unit is expected to have a stronger electron-donating ability compared to the carbazole unit, which could lead to more efficient low band gap polymers. In this paper, we report the synthesis of novel polymers combining new electron-rich TTI unit with three electron-deficient units, 4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (PTTIDTBT-h), 2-dimethyl-4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2H-benzimidazole (PTTIDTMBI) and 3,6-di(2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (PTTIDPP) (Scheme 1). All of the polymers led to red-shifted absorption as compared to the corresponding polymers with carbazole units, such as P(2,7C-HDTBT), PCDTMBI and DBTCz-Me (see Scheme S1). The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by fabrication of polymer solar cells with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Al.


All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or TCI, and used without further purification. Solvents were purified by normal procedure and handled under a moisture-free atmosphere. 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (2), 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethyhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (4), and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (8) were synthesized using similar reported methods.



1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Gemini-300 (300 MHz) spectrometer and the chemical shifts were recorded in ppm units with TMS as the internal standard. Flash column chromatography was performed with Merck silica gel 60 (particle size 230–400 mesh ASTM) with ethyl acetate/hexane or methanol/methylene chloride gradients unless otherwise indicated. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted using Merck 0.25 mm silica gel 60F pre-coated aluminum plates with fluorescent indicator UV254. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer under electron impact (EI) conditions in the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu). The molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. Thermal analyses were carried out on an SDT Q600 under a N2 atmosphere with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1, at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Busan). The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Varian 5E UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers were obtained using a Wona-WPG100 at room temperature in a three-electrode cell under an Ar atmosphere at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, with Pt wire as the counter electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode, and 0.1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. The AFM instrumentation consisted of a Veeco NanoScope AFM and standard silicon cantilever (Veeco; tip radius, 8 nm; normal spring constant, 21–78 N m−1; scan rate, 2.0 Hz) at ambient conditions (in air, 20 °C).


The FETs were fabricated on heavily doped n-type silicon (Si) wafers each covered with a thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer with a thickness of 200 nm. The entire Si substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in acetone and isopropyl alcohol successively, dried over 2 hours in a dry oven at 100 °C, and then subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 30 min. The active layer was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm. Prior to active layer deposition, the SiO2 surfaces were treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to make the surface hydrophobic. All solutions were of 10 mg ml−1 concentration in chlorobenzene. The thickness of the deposited films was about 60 nm. Prior to deposition of source drain electrodes, the films were dried at room temperature for 30 min. Source and drain electrodes using Au were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The thickness of source and drain electrodes was 50 nm, and the channel length (L) and channel width (W) were 50 μm and 3.0 mm, respectively. Electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200). All fabrication and measurement processes were carried out in a glove box filled with N2. The mobility (μ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime:
Isat = (μWCi/2L)(VGS − VT)2,
where
Ci is the capacitance per unit area of 15 nF cm−2 and VT is the threshold voltage.


Solar cells were fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate with the following structure: ITO-coated glass substrate/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate was first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-cast from an aqueous solution to form a film of 40 nm thickness. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the active layer. A solution containing a mixture of polymer:PC71BM in chlorobenzene solvent with a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The film was dried for 30 min at room temperature in the glove box. Then, an aluminum (Al, 100 nm) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of about 3 × 10−6 Torr. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. Solar cell performance was measured with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated by comparison of the solar simulator spectrum with the AM 1.5 spectrum at room temperature.

The general synthetic routes toward the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. 4-Bromo-2-nitroaniline (1) was iodinated using potassium iodide to give 4-bromo-1-iodo-2-nitrobenzene (2). Compound 2 was coupled with tributyl(2-thienyl)stannane in tetrahydrofuran (THF) using dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) to give 2-[2-nitro-4-(2-thienyl)phenyl]thiophene (3). Compound 3 was cyclized using triphenyl phosphine to give 6-(2-thienyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (4).

Table 1 summarizes the polymerization results including molecular weights, PDIs, and thermal stabilities of the copolymers. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of 20000, 110000 and 13000 with PDI (poly dispersity index, Mw/Mn) values of 1.3, 3.5 and 1.9 were determined by gel permission chromatography (GPC) for PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, respectively.

The thermal properties of the polymers were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA data for the polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1. The TGA data shows that PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP are thermally stable with only about 5% weight loss in air at temperatures (Td) of 427, 421 and 407 °C, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed good thermal stability with glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 97, 97 and 94 °C, respectively. The high thermal stability of the resulting polymers prevents the deformation of the polymer morphology and is important for organic photovoltaic applications.

The solution was prepared using CHCl3 as a solvent and the thin film by spin-coating on quartz plates from the solution of CHCl3. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers as solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 2. The solution of PTTIDTBT-h presents two absorption bands with maximum peaks at 409 and 561 nm. The PTTIDTBT-h thin film shows two broad absorption bands with peaks at 423 and 594 nm. The maximum absorption peaks of PTTIDTMBI present two strong absorption peaks at 459 and 720 nm in CHCl3 solution. The PTTIDTMBI thin film shows absorption bands with maximum peaks at 446 and 682 nm. The maximum absorption peaks of PTTIDPP appear at 418 and 697 nm in CHCl3 solution. The maximum absorption peaks in solid thin films are at 430 and 759 nm. The short-wavelength absorption peaks have been ascribed to a delocalized excitonic π–π* transition in the polymer chains and the long-wavelength absorption peaks attributed to the ICT effect between the electron-rich TTI unit and electron-deficient units, DTBT-h, DTMBI and DPP. Comparing the long-wavelength absorption peaks of PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, the peak for the PTTIDTMBI solution is relatively red-shifted, but PTTIDPP shows a red shifted peak in the case of the thin film, caused by the more favorable intermolecular interactions. The copolymers PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, all with TTI units, show more red-shifted absorption peaks compared to the corresponding polymers with carbazole units in place of the TTI, P(2,7C-HDTBT), PCDTMBI and DBTCz-Me, caused by the higher ICT effects.

The electrochemical properties of the polymers were determined from the band gaps estimated from the absorption onset wavelengths and the HOMO energy levels, which were estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV). CV was performed with a solution of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) (0.10 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. A platinum electrode (∼0.05 cm2) coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode. Pt wire and an Ag/AgNO3 electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (calibrated from the Fc/Fc+ redox system) was 4.8 eV below the vacuum level.

The CV spectra are shown in Fig. 3, and the oxidation potentials derived from the onsets of electrochemical p-doping are summarized in Table 2. The oxidation onset potentials (Eox) were determined as the position where the oxidation current starts to differ from the baseline. HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated according to the empirical formula (EHOMO = −([Eonset]ox + 4.8) eV) and (ELUMO = −([Eonset]red + 4.8) eV), respectively. The polymers PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP exhibited absorption onset wavelengths of 734, 852 and 948 nm in solid thin films, which corresponds to band gaps of 1.69, 1.46 and 1.31 eV, respectively, lower than those of the corresponding carbazole series, P(2,7C-HDTBT), PCDTMBI and DBTCz-Me, 2.01, 1.64 and 1.57 eV, respectively. The polymers exhibit irreversible processes in an oxidation scan. The oxidation onsets of the polymers PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP were estimated to be 0.51, 0.40 and 0.29 V, which correspond to HOMO energy levels of −5.31, −5.20 and −5.09 eV, respectively. The reduction potential onsets of the polymers, PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP are −1.14, −1.03 and −1.09 eV, which corresponds to LUMO energy levels of −3.66, 3.77 and 3.71 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps, calculated from cyclic voltammetry data, are about 1.65, 1.43 and 1.38 eV. The optimized geometry and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G (2d, 2p) level of theory using the Gaussian 03 package, as shown in Fig. 4. The HOMO and LUMO surfaces were plotted using GaussView version 4.1. To simplify the calculations, the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. The minimum energy conformations of the TTI based polymers were calculated from density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP/6-31G (2d, 2p) model and are represented in Fig. 4. As shown in the HOMO and LUMO distributions of the polymers, the LUMO orbitals of the polymers are mostly localized on the electron withdrawing groups. In contrast, the HOMO orbitals are fully delocalized throughout the polymer backbones. In addition to this, the calculated conformations of the polymers show relatively small torsion angles between TTI and the electron-deficient units. The polymers, PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, show torsion angles of 31.5°, 2.45° and 16.9°, respectively, between the electron-rich and electron-deficient units. In the case of PTTIDTBT-h, the dihedral angle between the thienyl group and the TTI unit is larger than the others due to steric hindrance caused by the alkyl substituents on the thienyl group. This alkyl group of PTTIDTBT-h was introduced since the compound showed very low solubility without it. All of the polymers show nearly planar conformations, which is beneficial to intrinsic π–π stacking and ICT (Fig. 5).

The field-effect carrier mobilities of the polymers were measured by fabricating thin film field-effect transistors (FETs) using the top-contact geometry. Fig. 6 shows the FET transfer characteristics of the polymer devices of the OTS-modified SiO2 substrate. The hole mobilities of the polymers were calculated from the transfer characteristics of the OFETs, as shown in Fig. 6 (see Table S1). The field-effect hole mobilities of PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP are 3.56 × 10−3, 3.30 × 10−4 and 3.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

Compared with PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, PTTIDTBT-h, with better efficiency, has greater hole mobility. The photovoltaic cells were fabricated by spin-coating BHJ films from chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solutions of polymer:PC71BM. PC71BM, as the electron-accepting component, has been widely used in OPV devices. Typical J–V characteristics of the devices with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Al under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are depicted in Fig. 7 and in the ESI (Fig. S2–S4). The photovoltaic parameters for all the polymers, including open circuit validates (Voc), short circuit current densities (Jsc), fill factors (FFs), and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are summarized in Table 3 and in the ESI (Table S2). To find the optimum composition ratios of the active layers, the photovoltaic devices were fabricated using different donor–acceptor composition ratios such as 1:1 and 1:3. The highest PCEs of the devices fabricated using PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDPP and PTTIDTMBI were found to be 3.14, 1.44 and 1.30%, respectively. Of the CV results summarized in Fig. 3, PTTIDTBT-h showed a lower HOMO energy level, leading to a higher open-circuit voltage. The performances of the fabricated photovoltaic devices are summarized in Table 3. For PTTIDTBT-h:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:3 in ODCB, the device showed a Voc value of 0.79 V, a Jsc value of 7.68 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.44, giving a PCE of 2.70%. The device based on PTTIDTBT-h with CB showed a PCE of 3.14% with a Voc value of 0.81 V, a Jsc value of 8.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.47. When PTTIDTBT-h was treated with various additives, almost the same values were observed, except in the case of using 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT). With ODT additive, the PCE was increased to 3.35% with a slightly increased FF value (0.51) and the same Voc (0.81 V) and Jsc (8.19 mA cm−2) values. The device fabricated using a blend of PTTIDTMBI:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:1 in CB exhibited a Voc of 0.58 V, a Jsc of 2.75 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.48, and a resulting PCE of 0.76%. Even though the Voc (0.57 V) and FF (0.40) were slightly lowered for the devices processed with ODCB solvent, the increase in Jsc (6.36 mA cm−2) led to enhancement of the PCE from 0.76% to 1.44% for the PTTIDTMBI:PC71BM-based solar cells. Attempts using various additives on the PTTIDTMBI:PC71BM did not show any positive effect. For PTTIDPP:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:1 in CB, the device showed a Voc value of 0.49 V, a Jsc value of 4.85 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.42, giving a PCE of 1.00%. When using the alternative solvent ODCB with PTTIDPP, the device showed a Voc value of 0.49 V, a Jsc value of 6.01 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.44, giving an increased PCE of 1.30%. When using poly difunctional polyglycidyl epoxide (DPE) as an additive, the device showed a Voc value of 0.45 V, a Jsc value of 7.08 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.41, giving a slightly increased PCE of 1.33%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the photovoltaic devices from polymer:PC71BM blends are presented in Fig. 7 and in the ESI (Fig. S2–S4). The EQE spectra of the PTTIDTBT-h show maxima of 48.2% at 466 nm in ODCB and 61.8% at 409 nm in CB. In the case of PTTIDTMBI, they show 15.4% at 368 nm in CB and 37% at 398 nm in ODCB. For PTTIDPP, they show 25.3% at 432 nm in CB and 41.1% at 382 nm in ODCB. The enhanced efficiency of PTTIDTBT-h results from the higher IPCE values between 300 and 700 nm, as compared to the cases of other polymers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies revealed the morphology of the blend films (polymer:PC71BM = 1:1 w/w or 1:3 w/w), as shown in Fig. 8, where the images were obtained in a surface area of 2.0 × 2.0 μm2 by the tapping mode. Samples of the polymer:PC71BM blends were prepared using procedures identical to those used to fabricate the active layers of the devices. The AFM images were recorded using films prepared under identical conditions to the device preparation. The AFM image of PTTIDTBT-h, with 2% ODT, exhibits a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.21 nm. In comparison, PTTIDTMBI without additives exhibits a RMS value of 1.52 nm, and PTTIDPP with DPE exhibits a RMS value of 1.98 nm. The smoother surfaces, without large domains caused by the addition of the additives, improve the interpenetration in the network for optimal charge generation and transport.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized push–pull-type low band gap polymers based on a novel electron-rich unit, 6-(2-thienyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (TTI). By replacing the six-membered benzene ring of the carbazole with an electron-rich five-membered thiophene ring, calculation of the torsion angles shows that, in the case of PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, the dihedral angles between the thiophene group of the TTI unit and the next thiophene are significantly smaller than those of the benzene group of the TTI unit and the next thiophene. The higher planarity caused by the lower dihedral angles will be favorable for enhancement of the ICT effect. As electron-withdrawing units, we introduced DTBT-h, DTMBI and DPP to yield PTTIDTBT-h, PTTIDTMBI and PTTIDPP, respectively. All of the polymers have good solubilities in THF, CHCl3, CB, ODCB and toluene. Due to the efficient electron donating ability of TTI, all the polymers have low band gaps 1.31–1.69 eV lower than those of the corresponding carbazole series, P(2,7C-HDTBT), PCDTMBI and DBTCz-Me, (1.57–2.01 eV). Out of the series, PTTIDTBT-h has a deep HOMO energy level of −5.31 eV, leading to the higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 0.81 V. The device fabricated with a PTTIDTBT-h:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) blend demonstrated a Voc value of 0.81 V, a Jsc value of 8.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.47, giving a PCE of 3.14%. When using ODT as an additive, the PSC with PTTIDTBT-h:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) demonstrated a Voc value of 0.81 V, a Jsc value of 8.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.51, giving the highest PCE of 3.35%.
