A series of two-dimension-conjugated D–π–A copolymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) or benzodifuran (BDF) as the donor unit, benzothiadiazole (BT) as the acceptor unit and thiophene as the π-bridge, were designed and synthesized for application as donor materials in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The polymers include PBDTT-BT based on BDT with a thiophene side chain, PBDTF-BT based on BDT with a furan side chain, PBDFT-BT based on BDF with a thiophene side chain and PBDFF-BT based on BDF with a furan side chain. The replacement of some of the thiophene rings in the donor unit with furan rings influences the UV-vis absorption spectra, electronic energy levels and band gaps of the copolymers. The HOMO levels of the copolymers based on BDF are ca. 0.1 eV up-shifted in comparison with that of the polymers based on BDT. While the furan side chain makes the LUMO level shift downwards a little. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs based on the polymers as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor reached 1.85% for PBDTT-BT, 2.88% for PBDTF-BT, 4.42% for PBDFT-BT and 2.60% for PBDFF-BT. The results indicate that the replacement of thiophene rings by furan rings in the 2-D-conjugated BDT unit significantly influences the photovoltaic properties of the copolymers.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively studied in recent years, due to their potential applications in large area, lightweight and flexible photovoltaic panels. Great effort has been devoted to the design and synthesis of new conjugated polymer donor materials and new fullerene derivative acceptor materials for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs, and over 7% power conversion efficiency (PCE) values have been reported by several research groups.

Broad absorption with narrower bandgap, relatively lower HOMO energy levels and higher hole mobility are pursued in the molecular design of high efficiency polymer donor materials. D–A copolymerization has been proven to be an efficient way to meet the requirement. Many donor and acceptor building blocks have been used in the design and synthesis of efficient D–A copolymer photovoltaic materials. Among various donor units in the D–A copolymers, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), with a symmetric and planar conjugated structure, is the most important donor unit in constructing high efficiency polymer donor materials. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF), which is similar to BDT with its two thiophene rings replaced by two furan rings, was also introduced to polymer donor materials recently. In addition, the two-dimension-conjugated (2-D-conjugated) BDT unit with thiophene conjugated side chains is superior to the BDT unit with alkoxy side chains. For the acceptor units, benzothiadiazole (BT) has been widely used in high efficiency D–A copolymer photovoltaic materials in PSCs.
In this study, we designed and synthesized four 2-D-conjugated D–π–A copolymers based on BDT or BDF with thiophene (T) or furan (F) conjugated side-chains as donor units, BT as the acceptor unit and thiophene as the π-bridge, for investigating the effect of replacing thiophene units with furan units in the BDT donor unit on the photovoltaic properties of the copolymers. The four polymers include PBDTT-BT based on BDT with a thiophene side chain, PBDTF-BT based on BDT with a furan side chain, PBDFT-BT based on BDF with a thiophene side chain and PBDFF-BT based on BDF with a furan side chain, as shown in Fig. 1. The PSCs based on the 2-D-conjugated copolymers as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor demonstrated the power conversion efficiencies of 1.85% for PBDTT-BT, 2.88% for PBDTF-BT, 4.42% for PBDFT-BT and 2.60% for PBDFF-BT, indicating the significant influence of the replacement of thiophene rings by furan rings in the 2-D-conjugated BDT unit.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer. Absorption spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by GPC method, using polystyrene as a standard. TGA was performed on a PE TGA-7. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation with a Pt disk coated with the polymer film, Pt wire and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution.


Polymer solar cell devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated under the conditions as follows: After spin-coating a 30–50 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) onto a pre-cleaned indium–tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate, the polymer:PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated. The concentration of the polymer–PC71BM (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4, weight ratio) blend solutions used in this work for spin-coating active layer was 10 mg mL−1 (according to the polymer weight) and dichlorobenzene was used as the solvent. The thickness of the active layer was ∼110 nm. The devices were completed by evaporating Ca/Al metal electrodes with an area of 4 mm2 defined by masks. Testing was done in N2 under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter.


We used a hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au for the hole mobility measurement, based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model. According to the following equation:

(1)
Where
μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the characteristic field, J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, L is the thickness of the polymer layer, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V). Hole mobility was calculated from the current–voltage measurement of the hole-only device according to the equation.


The synthesis route of the monomers and corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. It is important to note that the alkyl side chain of the polymers plays a critical role in determining the solubility and photovoltaic performance of the polymers. In this work, the thiophene π-bridge in the main chain of the polymers with different alkyl (hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl) chains was used in the synthesis of the D–π–A copolymers. It was found that the thiophene π-bridge with a hexyl chain led to poor solubility of the copolymers. Thus the thiophene with a 2-ethylhexyl side chain was chosen as the π-bridges in the copolymers. Polymers PBDTT-BT, PBDTF-BT, PBDFT-BT and PBDFF-BT were all synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization. Thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The four polymers have good thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures at 331, 334, 386 and 312 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, the thermal stability of these polymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs.


The absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution and spin-coated films on quartz substrates are shown in Fig. 3. Table 1 summarizes the optical data, including the absorption peak wavelengths (λabs), absorption edge wavelengths (λonset) and the optical band gap (Eoptg). The absorption spectra of the polymers in the solid film were obviously red-shifted in comparison with their solution absorption, indicating intermolecular interactions existing in the solid state. All the four polymer films show broad absorption covering the wavelength range from 300 nm to ca. 740 nm. The absorption edges of the four polymer films are at 739 nm for PBDTT-BT, 728 nm for PBDTF-BT, 738 nm for PBDFT-BT and 771 nm for PBDFF-BT, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.67, 1.70, 1.68 and 1.61 eV respectively.

The onset oxidation potential (Eox)/onset reduction potential (Ered) of PBDTT-BT, PBDTF-BT, PBDFT-BT and PBDFF-BT are 0.55/−1.37, 0.53/−1.17, 0.37/−1.32 and 0.40/−1.11 V vs. Ag/Ag+ respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential according to the equations:
HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV)
(2)
LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV)
(3)
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are also listed in Table 1 for clear comparison. The HOMO levels of PBDTT-BT, PBDTF-BT, PBDFT-BT and PBDFF-BT are −5.26, −5.24, −5.08 and −5.11 eV respectively. The HOMO energy levels of ca. −5.10 eV for PBDFT-BT and PBDFF-BT are similar to that of the corresponding copolymers based on BDT with alkoxy side chains. Obviously, the HOMO levels of the copolymer based on BDF are ca. 0.1 eV up-shifted in comparison with that of the polymers based on BDT. In comparison with the effect of the thiophene and furan conjugated side chains on the LUMO energy levels of the 2-D-conjugated polymers, obviously, the furan side chain makes the LUMO level downwards shifted. The LUMO energy levels of the polymers are all located within a suitable range (from −3.34 to −3.60 eV, see Table 1) and are >0.3 eV higher-lying than that of PC71BM (ca.−3.91 eV), thus, efficient excitons dissociation could be expected to occur in their corresponding PSCs.
The influence of the replacement of the thiophene ring in the BDT unit with furan on the HOMO energy levels of the copolymers could be explained as follows. The five-member ring of furan shows less steric hindrance to adjacent units, because the diameter of the oxygen atom is smaller than that of the sulfur atom. The copolymers based on the BDF unit possess an even better planar structure and thus a better conjugated backbone than that of the copolymers based on the BDT unit. Therefore, the bandgap of the copolymers based on BDF is decreased and their HOMO energy level could be up-shifted.

To investigate the effect of furan replacement of the thiophene rings in the 2-D-conjugated copolymers based on the BDT unit on the photovoltaic properties of the copolymers, bulk heterojunction PSC devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer: PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The active layers were spin-coated from a dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution of polymer:PC71BM blend. The weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM was adjusted from 1:1 to 1:4, and the optimized condition was 1:1. Fig. 5(a) shows the current density–voltage curves of the PSCs based on the blends of polymer:PC71BM under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and Fig. 5(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs.

The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. For the PSCs based on PBDTT-BT, PBDTF-BT and PBDFT-BT, the Voc slightly decreased from 0.88 to 0.85 to 0.79 V, corresponding to the up-shift of the HOMO energy level from −5.26 to −5.24 to −5.08 eV for the three polymers. The Jsc increased from 5.83 to 8.41–8.82 mA cm−2. The Jsc of the PSC based on PBDFF-BT is 5.84 mA cm−2, which is relatively low in comparison with the broad absorption of PBDFF-BT. Although having a relatively lower Voc, PBDFT-BT exhibited the highest PCE of 4.00% of all the four polymers. It should be mentioned that the Jsc of 5.83 mA cm−2 is almost the same as that of a similar copolymer PBDT-DTBT reported by Wang et al. The great increase of the Jsc to 8.41–8.82 mA cm−2 respectively for PBDTF-BT and PBDFT-BT indicates that the replacement of the thiophene rings to furan rings in the conjugated side chain or BDT unit improves the photovoltaic performance of the copolymers significantly.

In order to further improve the PCE of the devices based on PBDFT-BT, the effect of adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive was studied. The highest PCE of the PSCs based on PBDFT-BT with 3% DIO additive reached 4.42% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 9.94 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.9%. Its current density–voltage characteristics and EQE spectra are also shown in Fig. 5.
To further analyze the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, the hole mobilities of the polymers in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au. Fig. 6 displays the ln(JL3 V−2) versus (V L−1)0.5 curve for the measurement of the hole mobility of the copolymers. The hole mobilities of the polymers calculated using eqn (1) are 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 9.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, for PBDTT-BT, PBDTF-BT, PBDFT-BT and PBDFF-BT, respectively. Obviously, the higher PCE of the PSC based on PBDFT-BT should be as a benefit of the higher hole mobility and broad absorption of PBDFT-BT and the lower PCE of PBDTT-BT could be related to the lower hole mobility of the polymer.
We also checked the effect of the morphology of the active layers on the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Fig. 7 shows the AFM images of the active layer surfaces. The average surface roughness (Ra) of the AFM topographic images was 0.38 nm, 0.46 nm, 0.43 nm and 0.96 nm for the blends of PBDTT-BT:PC71BM, PBDTF-BT:PC71BM, PBDFT-BT:PC71BM and PBDFF-BT:PC71BM respectively. The phase images of the films of PBDTT-BT:PC71BM, PBDTF-BT:PC71BM and PBDFT-BT:PC71BM show uniform donor–acceptor interpenetrating networks with appropriate domain sizes. But the domain sizes of the donor–acceptor interpenetrating network in the PBDFF-BT:PC71BM active layer are too big, as shown in Fig. 7(h). Probably, the lower Jsc of the OSC based on PBDFF-BT:PC71BM in comparison with its broad absorption is due to the poorer morphology of the active layer.

In summary, we designed and synthesized four 2-D-conjugated D–π–A copolymers PBDTT-BT, PBDTF-BT, PBDFT-BT and PBDFF-BT based on BDT or BDF with thiophene (T) or furan (F) conjugated side-chain as the donor units, BT as the acceptor unit and thiophene as the π-bridge. These polymers showed lower energy bandgaps, good solubility in common organic solvents and good thermal stability. The copolymers based on BDF possess a lower bandgap and broader absorption, but a higher HOMO energy level. The PCE of the PSCs based on the polymers as the donor and PC71BM as acceptor with a donor–acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 reached 1.85% for PBDTT-BT, 2.88% for PBDTF-BT, 4.42% for PBDFT-BT and 2.60% for PBDFF-BT, respectively. Obviously, PBDFT-BT based on the BDF unit with thiophene conjugated side chains shows the best photovoltaic performance, which could be as a benefit of the broad absorption and higher hole mobility (9.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of PBDFT-BT. These results indicate that BDFT (BDF with thiophene conjugated side chains) is a promising new donor unit in constructing high efficiency D–π–A copolymer donor materials for PSCs.
