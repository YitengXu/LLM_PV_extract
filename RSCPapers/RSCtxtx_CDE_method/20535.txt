Three structurally identical polymers, except for the number of fluorine substitutions, namely PF0, PF1 and PF2, are designed and synthesized, in order to investigate the impact of fluorination on the thermal stability of polymer solar cells. Devices based on the three polymers can retain ∼90% of their initial efficiency, after annealing for 30 days at 100 °C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a series of novel materials achieving such long-term device thermal stability at high temperature have been reported. Accelerated aging tests show that device thermal stability ranks in the following order: PF2 > PF0 > PF1. Our findings demonstrate that PF2, with two fluorine substitutions and featuring regio-regularity, has the strongest ability to preserve the morphology, which endows the PF2 blend with a relative slow rate of morphological deterioration. In contrast, the morphology of mono-fluorinated PF1 shows the poorest thermal stability, which is ascribed to the regio-random characteristic induced by mono-fluorination. This work discloses the synergistic effect of fluorination and regio-regularity on device thermal stability for the first time, and systematically elucidates the “structure-thermal stability” relationship, which provides a guideline for designing materials with high device thermal stability.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their unique advantages: flexibility, low-cost fabrication, light-weight construction and roll-to-roll (R2R) processing. High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability are still the two key issues that have to be addressed, aiming at the commercialization of PSCs. Recent research efforts have made great strides in the innovation of novel materials and fabrication technologies, and the PCE of lab-scale devices has reached over 10%. However, the long-term stability of PSCs has lagged far behind.

It is now recognized that the stability of PSCs depends on interface material issues, degradation of organic materials and the morphological stability of the active layer. While the first two issues could be solved by optimizing fabrication technologies, the last one which is induced by an internal driving force (phase separation) is hardly improved by means of extrinsic technologies. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer of PSCs requires an optimal morphology with specific nano-scale phase separation and an interpenetrating network for exciton dissociation and charge collection. Unfortunately, the optimized morphology turns out to be a metastable state and readily moves towards a thermodynamic equilibrium state. The donor component (polymer) continues to further crystallize or form better packing, while the acceptor component (usually [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) tends to develop into large aggregates or clusters or even single crystals, especially after prolonged exposure to heat. Therefore, it is crucial to stabilize the optimal BHJ morphology.
Although novel low band gap materials with impressive device performance have been intensively reported, the thermal stability of the corresponding devices is unsatisfactory or has rarely been investigated. For instance, devices based on several typical high-performance low band gap materials, such as PTB7 and PTB7-Th, are generally very sensitive to thermal stress due to their morphological instability upon annealing. Numerous efforts have been directed toward developing different strategies to stabilize the BHJ morphology, such as the introduction of compatibilizer and cross-linkers and other techniques. Although these approaches are effective in improving the thermal stability of PSCs, most of them require multiple-step synthesis or complex optimization processes and suffer from the drawback of poor initial device performance. Therefore, it is urgent to develop facile and effective strategies to enhance the thermal stability of high-performance PSCs.
Fluorination on the polymer backbone has shown great advantages: (1) lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the conjugated polymers, which could improve the open-circuit voltage of the device; (2) increasing the dipole moment (Δμge) between the ground and excited states of the polymer, which could suppress the charge recombination, accounting for the increment of the short-circuit current density and fill factor; (3) enhancing the inter/intra-molecular interaction of polymers, leading to high charge carrier mobility. Fluorination on the polymer backbone has become one of highly employed tools in tailoring the molecular structure to achieve high performance PSCs, and most of the record-making devices are based on fluorinated materials. Notably, the introduction of different numbers of fluorine atoms would inevitably change the structural symmetry of repeat units, leading to a regio-regular or random polymer structure, which is crucial for photovoltaic properties. Our previous work has demonstrated that rational optimization of the molecular structure is a straightforward and efficient strategy for enhancing device thermal stability without sacrificing its PCE. Therefore, it is worthwhile to systemically investigate the influence of fluorination and regio-regularity originated from the fluorination on device thermal stability. With respect to the design strategy for enhancing device thermal stability, it is highly desirable to construct the structure–function relationship between fluorination and device thermal stability.
In this work, a series of novel copolymers of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based materials, with identical structures except for the number of fluorine substitutions, namely PF0, PF1 and PF2 (Scheme 1) were designed and synthesized, aiming at revealing the effect of fluorination and regio-regularity on device thermal stability for the first time. Thermal stability tests showed that devices based on the three polymers could maintain ∼90% of the initial efficiency after annealing for 30 days at 100 °C, corroborating the impressive long-term thermal stability. The accelerated aging tests displayed that the PCE loss ratios were 27%, 33% and 19% for PF0, PF1 and PF2, respectively, after annealing for 120 h at 130 °C. Our findings demonstrated that the interpenetrating networks of difluorinated PF2 were the most resistant against thermal annealing, which could facilitate the retention of the optimal morphology. In contrast, the morphology of mono-fluorinated PF1 showed the poorest thermal stability, which was ascribed to the regio-random characteristic of the polymer. This work provides a novel strategy for improving device thermal stability, which would be a general methodology to design materials with high device thermal stability.

The synthetic procedure of PF0, PF1 and PF2 is shown in Scheme 1. High temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to measure the molecular weight by using trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 140 °C, and the results showed that the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were 28 kDa/1.90, 22 kDa/1.60 and 24 kDa/1.66 for PF0, PF1 and PF2, respectively. Since the three polymers possessed similar molecular weight, no particular effect of molecular weight on photovoltaic properties and device stability was to be considered. No thermal transitions were observed from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements for all the polymers (Fig. S1). The decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2) was 390 °C, 394 °C and 403 °C for PF0, PF1 and PF2, respectively.

The solution and thin film UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers are shown in Fig. 1a and b. All the polymers displayed a similar profile in solution and the solid state and exhibited broad absorption in the range of 300–700 nm, featuring two distinct absorption peaks at 350–500 nm and 600–700 nm. The shorter wavelength peak was assigned to the localized π–π* transitions, while the lower energy band corresponded to the internal charge transfer (ICT). The absorption peaks in films were slightly red-shifted relative to those in solution, suggesting the enhancement of polymer stacking in the solid state. The absorption onsets of films were 725 nm, 730 nm and 708 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.71 eV, 1.70 eV and 1.75 eV for PF0, PF1 and PF2, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to determine the HOMO energy levels of these films. According to the equation EHOMO = −(0.48 + Eonsetox) eV, where Eonsetox is the onset oxidation potential versus Ag/Ag+ (Fig. S3), the HOMO energy levels of PF0, PF1 and PF2 were calculated to be −5.29 eV, −5.39 eV and −5.48 eV, respectively. The results clearly demonstrated that fluorination on the backbone could effectively lower the HOMO levels, which was in accordance with previous reports. The detailed parameters of the molecular weight, thermal and optical properties and HOMO levels of the three polymers are summarized in Table 1.

The photovoltaic properties of the three polymers were investigated with the conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The polymer:PC71BM blend films were fabricated by spin-coating from o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution, with the film thickness of ca. 100 nm. The detailed optimization process is provided in the ESI (Table S1). Obviously, the polymer and PC71BM weight blend ratio (D/A, w/w) was optimized to be 1:1. Thermal annealing (TA) was demonstrated to be a useful post-treatment method for promoting the device performance. Upon annealing, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) were all improved drastically, which was attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of the polymer and better contact between the active layer and electrode. For all polymers, the highest PCEs were achieved under the condition of annealing for 10 min at 130 °C. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The optimal devices based on PF2 gave the highest PCE of 6.55% among the three polymers, with Voc = 0.86 V, FF = 65.25% and Jsc = 11.67 mA cm−2. For PF0 and PF1, the optimal efficiencies were 5.70% (Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 11.76 mA cm−2, and FF = 65.46%) and 6.29% (Voc = 0.80 V, Jsc = 11.85 mA cm−2, and FF = 66.23%), respectively. It was obvious that the gradually increased PCE mainly arose from the increment of Voc, which benefited from the decrease of the HOMO energy levels. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 2b and all devices exhibited a relatively high photo-to-current conversion efficiency of 50–60% in the range of 450–700 nm. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves were consistent with those obtained from the J–V curves (within 5% deviation), indicating the high accuracy of the device measurement. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2.

Device thermal stability played a crucial role in both device fabrication and practical application. Herein, thermal annealing on the photoactive layer was carried out prior to the deposition of the cathode, so that the influence of other factors except for operation temperature on the morphology and performance was eliminated. All the device thermal stability testing was carried out under the same conditions.

The annealing temperature was chosen to be 100 °C, which was still much higher than the reference temperature (85 °C). Annealing time-dependent normalized PCE profiles are shown in Fig. 3a. After annealing for 30 days, the device performance of PF0 and PF2 only decreased from 5.62% and 6.45% to 5.18% and 5.85% (Fig. S4), with PCE loss ratios of 8% and 10%, pointing to their outstanding device thermal stability. And the PF1 device also exhibited relatively strong thermal stability and preserved 85% of the initial efficiency (PCE loss ratio: 15%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a series of novel materials achieving long-term thermal stability of 30 days at such a high temperature in PSCs have been reported. It is noteworthy that these devices would present much better thermal stability if tested at the reference temperature of 85 °C.
In order to more clearly reveal the differences in device thermal stability produced by the molecular structure, a higher annealing temperature of 130 °C was applied in the accelerated aging tests, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S5. As shown in Fig. 3b, the performance of all devices decreased at different levels along with the annealing time. Among all the devices, the PF2 device exhibited the best thermal stability, and the efficiency gradually reduced from 6.45% to 5.21% (PCE loss ratio: 19%) after annealing for 120 h. In contrast, the PF1 device showed the poorest thermal stability and the PCE dropped sharply to 4.99% at 48 h, and further decreased to 4.13% (PCE loss ratio: 33%) at 120 h, mainly due to the decrement of the FF and Jsc (Fig. S6). The PF0 device exhibited moderate thermal stability, and the PCE could still be retained at 73% of its initial efficiency (PCE loss ratio: 27%). In addition, the thermal stability of PTB7-Th, one of the most promising candidates exhibiting record PCE, was characterized as a reference, and the results are shown in Fig. 3b. Unfortunately, the PCE of the PTB7-Th device decayed from 7.99% to 3.13% (PCE loss ratio: 60%) after annealing for 48 h at 130 °C (Fig. S7). The poor thermal stability of the PTB7-Th device implied that it was of urgency and importance to improve the device thermal stability. These results demonstrated that devices based on the three polymers possessed remarkable thermal stability and ranked in the following order: PF2 > PF0 > PF1.

The device structure and testing process conditions were uniform for all the polymers. Thus, it was reasonable to speculate that the differences in device thermal stability most likely arose from the structural variety of polymer chains. Taking into account that these polymers possessed a similar backbone except for the number of fluorine atoms, the “structure–property” relationship was supposed to be closely related to two factors: fluorination and regio-regularity. On the one hand, fluorination on the backbone could facilitate the inter/intra-molecular interaction of polymer chains, which would be beneficial for the crystallinity of polymers. On the other hand, the asymmetric structure of the mono-fluorine substituted acceptor unit could afford the regio-random characteristic of the polymer backbone, which prejudiced the ordering degrees of polymers. Thus, the crystallinity of polymers was synergistically affected by fluorination and regio-regularity. Polymers with high crystallinity preferentially crystallized during the film-forming process, which made the interpenetrating networks of the polymer component thermally resistant and the diffusion of PCBM was consequently restricted. Therefore, devices based on difluorine substituted PF2 showed the best thermal stability, while PF1 exhibited the poorest device thermal stability, which could be explained by the conjecture that the effect of regio-random characteristic played a more important role than fluorination in this case.

It has been reported that the lowest energy peak in the UV-vis spectrum is often indicative of the structural ordering of the conjugated polymers in the BHJ. Therefore, the variation of crystallinity can be quantified by the relative absorption coefficient Δα at the lowest energy peaks, following the equation of Δα = (αt − α0)/α0, where α0 and αt correspond to the absorbance coefficient before and after annealing for t hours. The lowest energy peaks located at 670 nm, 670 nm and 650 nm were observed for PF0, PF1 and PF2, respectively (Fig. S8). The annealing time-dependent Δα values are shown in Fig. 4a. After annealing for 120 h at 130 °C, the Δα values of PF0 and PF1 blend films underwent a significant increase of 9% and 10%, respectively. The changes of Δα indicated that the crystallinity of both PF0 and PF1 gradually increased. In contrast, a small increase of Δα (∼6%) was observed for the PF2 blend film. The smallest increment of the crystallinity of PF2 was ascribed to the synergy of fluorination and regio-regularity. These results were also in accordance with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization (Fig. S9). For both PF0 and PF1 blend films, the intensity of the (100) peaks increased along with the annealing time, among which the PF1 blend film showed a greater increment. Conversely, no obvious increment of the (100) peak intensity was observed for PF2 in the blend film. The crystallization process of polymers is inevitably accompanied by the diffusion and aggregation of PCBM molecules, resulting in a morphological shift from nano-scale phase separation to sizable phase separation. As a result, the optimal morphology of the PF1 blend film deteriorated much more easily and the corresponding device performance decreased sharply. In constrast, the morphological deterioration of PF2 was greatly suppressed and the device thermal stability was thus enhanced.
In the optimal BHJ, the process of exciton dissociation is highly efficient due to the large interfacial area between the polymer and PCBM domains, and the photoluminescence (PL) intensity is rather weak. However, continuous thermal annealing could propel the optimal morphology to form bulky domains of the donor and acceptor larger than the exciton-diffusion length, which decreases the exciton dissociation efficiency, leading to the enhancement of the PL intensity. Thus, morphological variation of the blend films could be evaluated by comparing the changes of the PL intensity, i.e. ΔI = (It − I0)/I0, where I0 and It are the PL intensities before and after annealing for t hours, respectively (Fig. S10). As illustrated in Fig. 4b, after annealing for 120 h at 130 °C, the PL intensities of PF0 and PF1 were enhanced 1.8 and 2.6 fold, respectively, suggesting the decrease of the exciton dissociation efficiency. As a result, the excess excitons decayed through radiative relaxation and the probability of charge recombination likely increased. The distinct decrement of Jsc for PF1 devices was in accordance with the diminution of the interfacial area between the polymer and PCBM domains. In comparison, the PL intensity of PF2 blend films was only increased by 1.3 times, revealing that the blend could maintain the efficiency of exciton dissociation at a high level after the annealing treatment. The results implied that the optimal BHJ of the PF2 blend exhibited the strongest thermal resistance and inhibited the formation of large phase separation, which ultimately resulted in outstanding device thermal stability. Charge carrier mobility was also determined to evaluate the percolation networks of these blend films before and after annealing. The hole and the electron mobility were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S11) and the changes of normalized hole and electron mobility as a function of annealing time are shown in Fig. 5. All the pristine blend films displayed comparable hole mobility, with the value of 2.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF0, PF1 and PF2, respectively. After annealing for 120 h at 130 °C, the hole mobility of the PF1 blend dropped by an order of magnitude, while PF0 and PF2 blends showed 4 fold and 2 fold decrements, respectively. This result suggested that the PF2 blend had the strongest capacity of preserving the percolation network for charge transfer. The electron mobility of the PF0 and PF2 blends reduced by one order of magnitude. However, the electron mobility of PF1 almost decreased by two orders of magnitude. The considerable reduction of the hole and electron mobility of PF1 as compared with that of PF0 and PF2 was related to its regio-random characteristic produced by mono-fluorination. The reduction of the hole and electron mobility of PF1 inhibited charge carriers transferring to the corresponding electrodes in time. As a result, the probability of non-geminate recombination consequently increased, leading to the drop of the FF and Jsc. These results further revealed that the percolation network of the PF2 blend was relatively much more thermally resistant than that of PF0 and PF1, which gave rise to the remarkable device thermal stability.
A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was employed to gain a deep insight into the morphological structure of pristine films. Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates that the three blend films of these polymers exhibited uniform nano-scale phase separation and well-defined fibrillar interpenetrating networks. This optimal morphological structure served as a nano-frame to “lock” the PCBM domains, prolonging the pathways for PCBM molecules to diffuse and aggregate, which could be the origin of excellent device thermal stability at high temperature. Intriguingly, the clearest nano-fibers of PF2 demonstrated in Fig. 6c benefited the robust interpenetrating networks, which accounted for the strongest device thermal stability.
An optical microscope (OM) was used to investigate the morphological evolution as a function of annealing time at 130 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, all the blend films underwent gradient deterioration and PCBM aggregations or crystals with different sizes were gradually formed along with the annealing time. Among the blends, the PF1 blend showed the most morphological instability and large PCBM aggregations were easily formed when exposed to thermal stress. After annealing for 48 h, pronounced PCBM aggregations were readily developed and continued to grow up to several micrometres when the annealing time was prolonged up to 120 h. The large PCBM aggregations could lead to the diminution of the interfacial area between donor and acceptor components, as well as to the attenuation of efficient bicontinuous pathways for charge carriers. Thus the efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge carrier mobility decreased, resulting in the dramatic decrease of the Jsc, FF and PCE. For PF0 and PF2 blends, the morphological deterioration was efficiently postponed. The PCBM aggregations of the PF0 blend with a much smaller size than those of the PF1 blend became visible at 48 h. During the following thermal annealing, the density of PCBM aggregations increased slowly, while the size almost remained unchanged. By comparison, the PF2 blend displayed smaller size PCBM aggregations at 72 h of annealing, and no further significant deterioration was observed in the subsequent thermal tests. These findings indicated that the difluorinated and regio-regular structure of PF2 guaranteed the good preservation of the optimal morphology, leading to remarkable long-term thermal stability of the corresponding device.

In conclusion, three low band gap polymers, with an identical structure except for the number of fluorine substitutions on the backbone, namely PF0, PF1 and PF2, were designed and synthesized, in order to study the impact of fluorination and regio-regularity on device thermal stability. Devices based on the three polymers maintained ∼90% of the initial efficiency after annealing for 30 days at 100 °C, which is the first time that such long-term thermal stability in PSCs has been realized. Accelerated aging tests showed that the PCE loss ratio was 27% for PF0, 33% for PF1 and 19% for PF2. Further study disclosed that the difluorinated and regio-regular PF2 showed the strongest ability to stabilize the optimal morphology and suppress the diffusion and aggregation of PCBM. In contrast, the blend film of mono-fluorinated PF1 showed the poorest morphological stability. Overall, these results clearly demonstrated the synergetic effect of fluorination and regio-regularity on the long-term thermal stability of PSCs. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular design strategy aiming at enhancing device thermal stability, which is meaningful for the future practical applications of PSCs.

PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto a pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass (Lumtec, 10 Ω sq−1) with the thickness of 30 nm and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The active layer was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution (total concentration: 20 mg mL−1) on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, with the film thickness of ∼100 nm. Then, Ca (30 nm) and Al (100 nm) layers were thermally evaporated on the top of the active layer, under high vacuum (<10−4 Pa). The shadow mask area was 0.09 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) using a SAN-EI ELECTRIC XEC-300M2 solar simulator. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were detected under monochromatic illumination (sofn 7ISW301 monochromator equipped with a sofn 7ILT250 lamp) and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a certified monocrystalline silicon diode.


The testing devices were fabricated under the same preparation conditions described in Device fabrication. The freshly prepared films were heated at 100 °C or 130 °C on a hot plate for different periods of time in a N2-filled glovebox. Then, the devices were quenched to room temperature on top of a metal surface, before Ca (30 nm) and Al (100 nm) layers were thermally deposited.

UV-vis measurements were carried out. The absorption coefficients of each thin film under various conditions were calculated by normalizing the absorbance to film thickness. The thickness of each thin film was measured by using a profiler (D-100 Stylus Profilometer, KLA Tencor). X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were obtained using a Bruker D8 Discover Reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. The samples were scanned in detector scan mode across a range of 2θ = 2–30°, with a step size of 0.05° and an accounting period of 5 s per step. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed with a HITACHIF-4600 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon light source and Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier tube (PMT), with an excitation wavelength of 610 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Optical microscopy (OM) investigations were carried out by using a Carl Zeiss A1m microscope equipped with an infinity 4-11 digital camera from Lumenera Corporation, Canada. The hole and electron mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, following the Mott–Gurney square law, ln(I/V2) = 0.89β(V/L)1/2 + ln(9με0εS/8L3), where I is the current, V is the applied voltage, β is the field activation factor, L is the thickness of the polymer film, μ is the mobility, ε is the permittivity of free space, ε0 is the relative permittivity, and S is the area of the polymer film. Notably, the surface roughness was significantly enhanced after annealing for a long time, which made it difficult to determine the exact film thickness and calculate the carrier mobility. Thus, the pristine film thickness was used to semi-quantitatively evaluate the values and the variation trend of carrier mobility along with the annealing time. The measurement of hole and electron mobility was conducted in the dark on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source-measure unit.
