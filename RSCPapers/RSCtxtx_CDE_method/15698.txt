Corannulene derivatives were used in organic solar cells for the first time. Using Cor-PI and Cor-NI as acceptors, we achieved power conversion efficiencies up to 0.32% and 1.03%, suggesting potential applications of these fullerene segments as non-fullerene acceptors.

Corannulene is a bowl-shaped fragment of fullerenes and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), which manifests unique electronic properties with varying functionalization, other than those of planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as pyrene or perylene. Since the first synthesis of corannulene in 1966, considerable efforts have been made to investigate their functionalization strategies, properties, and applications for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), liquid crystals, molecular tweezers, dendrimers, polymers, bottom-up synthesis to uniform-diameter, single-chirality carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Recent studies suggest that corannulene and other geodesic polyarenes (such as sumanene and cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene) can be used as electron acceptors. In particular, the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on corannulene can improve its electron-accepting ability. Nonetheless, corannulene derivatives have never been demonstrated to be applicable as electron acceptors in organic electronic devices.

Because of their large electron affinity, high electron mobility and possible multi-dimensional charge transport resulting from the spherical shape, fullerenes and derivatives thereof [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM and PC71BM, for instance) have been the dominant electron acceptors in solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of which have exceeded 10%. Nonetheless, fullerenes also have disadvantages such as weak absorption in the visible spectrum and difficulties in accessing energy levels through chemical modifications due to the lack of resonance effects. Fullerenes often have low open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to their low LUMOs. Hence, the development of non-fullerene acceptors with easy access, varying energy level alignments, and wide possibilities of functionalization is desired. Current small-molecule acceptors in BHJ solar cells are still limited with a few PCEs exceeding 2%, leaving it important to develop alternative high-performance acceptor structures. The structural correlation of corannulene with fullerene derivatives may partly facilitate its multi-dimensional charge transport and thus lead to better device performance. The recent production of corannulene in kilogram scale also facilitated its applications.
Electron-withdrawing groups enhance electron-accepting abilities, for example, as in trifluoromethyl, annulated C4F8, and fused imide. To achieve satisfactory device performance, the acceptor molecules in BHJ solar cells need to have appropriate energy level alignments and effective film forming properties. In this work, we introduce electron-withdrawing n-hexylphthalimide (PI) and n-hexylnaphthalimide (NI) to the corannulene core to lower the LUMO level, as supported by DFT calculations (Fig. 1). N-Hexyl was chosen to ensure sufficient solubility and film forming properties of the resulting compounds. Because of the steric hindrance induced by the neighbouring aromatic protons, the dihedral angle between the corannulene core and imide moieties of Cor-PI and Cor-NI is large (B97D/Def2-TVPP calculated values 37.2° and 52.2°, respectively, ESI, Fig. S4), which may lead to better miscibility with P3HT. Calculations also show that bowl depths and bowl-to-bowl interconversion barriers in the functionalized analogues do not significantly change from those of the parent corannulene (Table S1). These derivatives are presented as the first applications of bowl-shaped fragments of fullerene as electron acceptors in BHJ solar cells. Blended with poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) donors, the devices provided PCEs of 0.19% for pristine corannulene. Introduction of electron-withdrawing groups to the corannulene core results in an increase in PCE to 0.32% for Cor-PI and 1.03% for Cor-NI.
As illustrated in Scheme 1, using standard Suzuki coupling, 1-bromocorannulene (Cor-Br) was treated with n-hexyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phthalimide and n-hexyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)naphthalimide to give Cor-PI and Cor-NI. The two products were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to evaluate the thermal behaviours of Cor-PI and Cor-NI, both showing good thermal stability with Td at 360 °C and 396 °C, respectively (ESI, Fig. S2).
The optical properties of Cor, Cor-PI and Cor-NI were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fig. S1). The absorptions of Cor, Cor-PI, Cor-NI, PI and NI in chloroform are shown in Fig. 2 and S3. Due to the introduction of PI and NI, the onset absorption wavelengths of Cor-PI and Cor-NI are significantly red-shifted compared with corannulene. The optical band gaps of Cor-PI and Cor-NI have been estimated to be 3.20 eV and 3.04 eV, respectively, from the onset absorption. Both Cor-PI and Cor-NI show absorption of the corannulene core at about 288 nm.Cor-NI showed a slight bathochromic shift compared to Cor-PI due to a longer effective conjugation of Cor-NIvs.Cor-PI (Fig. S5). PI and NI both showed absorption below 370 nm. The absorption of Cor-PI and Cor-NI from 330 nm to 400 nm was attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption, which partly depends on the groups attached to the corannulene core. Hence, changing the groups attached to corannulene is a convenient way to tune the absorption of corannulene derivatives.
Cyclic voltammograms of Cor, Cor-PI and Cor-NI were performed in DMF (Fig. 2). Cor-PI and Cor-NI both showed two reversible reduction peaks. The LUMO levels of Cor-PI and Cor-NI are −3.10 eV and −3.24 eV with a −0.45 eV (calc. −0.50 eV) and −0.59 eV (calc. −0.80 eV) decrease compared to that of corannulene, respectively. The LUMO levels of Cor-PI and Cor-NI are both more than 0.4 eV higher than that of PCBM, which may lead to higher Voc. The experimentally determined LUMO levels of PI and NI are −3.01 eV and −3.18 eV (see ESI, Fig. S3), which are close to those of Cor-PI and Cor-NI. As confirmed by computational analysis, the LUMOs are primarily localized on the imide moieties (Fig. 1). The HOMOs of Cor-PI and Cor-NI are delocalized on both the corannulene and imide moieties (Fig. S5). The data of UV-vis absorption, CV and calculated orbitals energies are summarized in Table 1. The abovementioned data established the ability to tune the optical properties and energy levels of acceptors by functionality on corannulene.

To evaluate the potential of corannulene derivatives to function as electron acceptors in BHJ solar cells, we fabricated and characterized devices using P3HT as the donor and Cor, Cor-PI or Cor-NI as the acceptors (Fig. 3). The donor/acceptor weight ratio in P3HT and corresponding materials are 1:1 with the total concentration of 20 mg mL−1. Power conversion efficiency (PCE), short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 2. Cor-PI and Cor-NI achieved PCE values of 0.32% and 1.03%, respectively. This is the first example illustrating corannulene derivatives as acceptors in organic solar cells. With nearly the same LUMO levels, which are considerably higher than that of PC61BM, Cor-PI and Cor-NI both showed evidently high Voc values of 0.83 V and 0.82 V, respectively (PCBM: about 0.6 V with P3HT as donor). Although Cor has a higher LUMO level, the charge separation is so insufficient that loss of Voc is significant. As shown in the J–V curve, blends of Cor-PI and Cor-NI exhibited quite different Jsc under the same fabrication conditions, which might be attributed to the distinct phase separation of the two blends.

To confirm the accuracy of the measurement of Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was also investigated. The integration value of EQE spectra is in accordance with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves. With the exception of the difference of two blends, the two EQE spectra show absorption peaks attributed to acceptors and to donors, thus exciton separation occurs from both D to A and from A to D in this system. EQE of devices based on Cor-NI reached 20–25% over the entire absorption range, whereas that of devices based on Cor-PI only reached around 5%. This indicates that devices based on Cor-PI show poor ability in the conversion of photons to current, and devices based on Cor-NI, with a slightly different structure, show a relatively enhanced ability to generate photocurrent.
To further understand the difference in device performance of the two molecules, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to detect the morphology of the blends (Fig. 4). Although Cor-NI is non-planar, the crystallization trend is still good. As estimated from the height image of AFM, the roughness of the blends made of Cor-PI is 10.2 nm, whereas that of the blends made of Cor-NI is as high as 36.6 nm. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the crystal domain area in Cor-NI/P3HT is considerably larger than that in Cor-PI/P3HT. Cor-NI/P3HT presents the best device performance with a relatively larger crystal domain, far beyond the optimal distance (10–20 nm) reported in previous work. We hypothesize that the larger crystal domain resulted from better crystallization of both donor and acceptor materials, thus causing the great roughness of the film.
To evaluate carrier transportation, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to test electron mobilities. The device configuration is ITO/ZnO/Cor-PI or Cor-NI:P3HT/LiF/Al. The steps before electrode evaporation were the same as in the device fabrication process. Electron mobilities of Cor-PI and Cor-NI were determined to be 1.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Cor-NI possessed high electron mobility, two orders of magnitude higher than that of Cor-PI, which clearly explained the distinct device performance of the two compounds.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that corannulene derivatives can be used as non-fullerene acceptors in solution processed BHJ solar cells, and the experiments provide the highest PCE of 1.03%. With PCE values over 1%, it is of great interest to further develop corannulene-based organic semiconductors. Further modifications of the corannulene core and the device fabrication are in progress.
