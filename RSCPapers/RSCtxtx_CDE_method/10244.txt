Efficient electron donors, phenothiazine (PTZ)/phenoxazine (POZ) substituted imidazolium (IMI) and benzimidazolium (BIMI) iodide solid organic ionic conductors (SOICs) possessing good thermal stability and high conductivity are synthesized. The high conductivity arises due to the presence of the effective electron donor moiety PTZ/POZ and hence, these SOICs were used as single component solid electrolytes in solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ss-DSSCs). The ss-DSSC devices operate proficiently without any post-treatment to dye loaded TiO2 and additives in the electrolyte matrix. The presence of unsaturation and hetero-atoms in PTZ/POZ is responsible for the hole mobility and enhancement in light harvesting properties. Hence, when SOICs were excited along with a metal-free sensitizer, SK 1,the higher LUMO levels of SOICs increased the total electron injection in the TiO2 interface with the electrons of SK 1. Under illumination of solar light (100 mW cm−2 with an AM1.5G filter), ss-DSSCs with POZ substituted IMI and BIMI as single component solid electrolytes showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 5.7%, which is quite comparable with the conventional imidazolium/benzimidazolium salt based liquid electrolytes and SK 1 sensitizer. The ss-DSSC devices with all four SOICs exhibit good long-term stability (∼1000 h) under 1 sun illumination and ambient humidity conditions. The present report paves the way for the development of single component solid organic ionic conductors having high electronic conductivity and better light harvesting ability as well as thermal stability.

As next generation promising photovoltaic devices, Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) have drawn great interest since their first report by O'Regan and Gratzel. Further, the high power conversion efficiency, low production cost, facile fabrication processes and environmental friendliness of DSSCs made them more popular. Typically, DSSCs are constructed using dye sensitized nano-structured TiO2 as the photoanode, a counter electrode (usually Pt) and the redox electrolyte I−/I3− filled between the electrodes. The electrolyte is one of the important components of DSSCs as it participates in charge transfer and dye regeneration process. Additionally, the electrolyte has a great influence on the overall power conversion efficiency. A DSSC with 13% overall power conversion efficiency has been reported with volatile organic liquid electrolytes, but volatility and leakage of liquid organic solvents hamper their outdoor commercial applications.

In view of this, considerable efforts have been made to replace the organic solvent based electrolytes with solid state materials. All solid state and quasi-solid DSSCs are potential candidates for replacement of liquid electrolytes. However, the poor conductivity and pore filling of porous titania by the electrolyte lowers the photovoltaic parameters including the photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of solid-state DSSCs (ss-DSSCs). Therefore, it is still a challenge to design novel solid state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, thermal stability and good pore filling capacity for efficient ss-DSSCs.
Imidazolium based ionic conductors have been used extensively and are the most popular materials as liquid and solid electrolytes. However, due to the unavoidable leakage problem, liquid imidazolium based conductors are less preferable for long-term operation of DSSCs. Therefore, DSSCs for practical applications involving solid state IMI (imidazolium iodide) with high conductivity are indispensable. Moreover, for high PCE and photovoltage in ss-DSSCs, it is essential to have a bulkier cation in the solid electrolyte, which can block the TiO2 surface more effectively compared to a small cation. Wang and co-workers modified the small cationic imidazolium based organic conductor by functionalizing it with hydroxyethyl and ester groups which provided effective ionic mobility through three dimensional channels. Alkyl substituted imidazolium and pyrrolidinium based di-cationic solid ionic conductors with I2 and a DMPII (1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide) additive also exhibited more than 6% PCE. Midya et al. explored carbazole–imidazole cation based organic solid electrolytes with iodide and thiocyanate anions and achieved nearly 3% PCE. Usually, the reported ionic conductors without any additives suffer from poor conductivity, thus ss-DSSCs based on them show lower performance. However, the conductivity and performance of a device are significantly enhanced by doping of LiI or iodine. A single component ionic conductor based on N-substituted propargyl IMI was explored in ss-DSSCs and the observed high conductivity and efficiency of the device were mechanistically supported by Grotthuss relay type charge transfer.Table 1 summarizes recent reports on solid organic ionic conductors as electrolytes (with and without additives) in ss-DSSCs. From the table it is revealed that majority of the reports showed poor PCE values in the absence of additives like LiI, tert-butyl pyridine, ionic liquids etc. However, multicomponent solid ionic conductors generate complexity, which is not preferable for tuning of components in devices. Hence, a single component organic ionic conducting material with a large cation, good hole transfer capacity and higher PCE is still in demand.

Herein, we have designed and synthesized novel phenothiazine (PTZ)/phenoxazine (POZ) substituted benzimidazolium iodide (BIMI)/imidazolium iodide (IMI) based SOIC electrolytes. Due to the larger size and good electron donating (hole transporting capacity) properties, the PTZ/POZ substituted IMI/BIMI cation increases dye regeneration. Due to internal charge transport it absorbs the visible spectrum of light (∼430 nm) that overlaps with the carbazole based sensitizer SK 1 (Scheme 1) and this supports the enhancement of total electron injection in the TiO2 conduction band, which resulted in an increase of the overall performance of the devices. The presence of the PTZ/POZ unit with a hexyl group enhances the solubility and prevents the crystallization of the solid state ionic conductor. As a consequence, these single component solid ionic conductors based DSSCs exhibit PCE of about 5.7% under illumination of solar light (100 mW cm−2).

Transparent conducting glass (FTO, 12 Ω, Solaronix, SA, Switzerland) and Meltronix tape (25 μm and 60 μm) were used as the substrate and sealant, respectively, for the fabrication of the ss-DSSC device. Phenothiazine (≥98%), phenoxazine (97%), o-phenylene diamine (99.5%), (E)-1,2-ethenediamine (≥96%), imidazole (≥99%), benzimidazole (98%), nano-crystalline TiO2 semiconductor (<20 nm, 99.7%, anatase), ethyl cellulose (90.2%) and α-terpineol (90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (India) and used as received. Methyl iodide (99%, Loba-chemie, India) and ethanol (KUC, India) were purified using the standard process. The metal-free organic sensitizer, SK-1 was prepared as per our previous report.


10-Hexyl-10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde [1] and 10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine-3-carbaldehyde [2] were synthesized as per the process reported in the literature and their general structures are shown in Scheme 2.


1 g (2.5 mM) of compound [1] and 0.73 g (1.8 mM) Na2S2O3 were added to dimethyl formamide (5 ml), then 0.34 g (4.6 mM) of ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD) was slowly added to the above mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 min and then refluxed at 95 °C for 20 h. At the end of the reaction, the entire reaction mass was poured into aqueous solution of saturated NaCl and washed with water. The final product was separated out by adding an organic solvent to the aqueous phase. After purification by silica gel column chromatography, 85% yield of the intermediate of SJE 1 (compound [3]) was achieved. Further, 1 g of compound [3] was dissolved in 20 ml THF followed by the addition of 1.2 equivalent of methyl iodide in an RBF. A yellowish color was observed and the reaction mass was refluxed for 24 h. The separated viscous oily (yellowish) layer of THF was decanted and 30 ml of DCM was added to it followed by the addition of 3 ml of water. KHCO3 was slowly added under stirring, which resulted in the evolution of CO2. Carbonate was added until CO2 evolution stopped. The white mass obtained was filtered and the DCM layer containing the product was allowed to evaporate. The resulting compound was taken in a 100 ml RB flask and dissolved in THF (20 ml) along with one equivalent of methyl iodide and refluxed at 90 °C overnight. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography. The final product was washed with diethyl ether (four to five times) to remove any unreacted reactant, which yielded the ionic conductor SJE 1 as a solid-state dark brown compound (0.76 g, 75% yield).

To prepare the working electrodes for ss-DSSCs, FTO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in a detergent, deionized water, and alcohol and were dried in a nitrogen stream. After this treatment they were coated with a buffer layer of TiO2 using spin-coating followed by calcination at 450 °C. A dense TiO2 film (9 μm) composed of a TiO2 nanoparticle layer was obtained by the doctor blading method. The XRD measurement and SEM image of thick nanoporous TiO2 photoanode films are given in Fig. S1 (ESI). The XRD pattern confirmed the anatase phase of TiO2 and the SEM image provided the thickness of TiO2 film (9 μm). The resultant film was calcined at 450 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 and after cooling, the electrode was dipped in 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 25 min at 50 °C followed by heating at 450 °C for 25 min. After cooling up to 70 °C, the electrode was dipped into 50 mM SK-1 solution (EtOH:EDC, 1:1) overnight to complete the sensitization. The counter electrode was prepared by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 (50 mM in IPA:EtOH) on the FTO and then fired at 450 °C for 30 min. The dye loaded TiO2 working electrode and Pt-coated counter electrode were separated using a hot-melt Surlyn film and sealed by pressing them under heat. A solution of solid electrolytes in methoxypropionitrile (MPN) was injected into the interior space of the cell from the two predrilled holes on the counter electrode and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for at least 4–5 h to remove the organic solvent. The same process was repeated 3–4 times to ensure that the TiO2 porous film was filled with a compact layer of the solid ionic conductor. The thickness of the SOIC in the ss-DSSC was varied by changing the thickness of Surlyn film used as the sealant. The fabricated cells were stored in the dark to carry out I–V, impedance and other photovoltaic measurements. It was confirmed that the active area of 0.25 cm2 was fixed in all the ss-DSSC devices.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 MHz NMR instrument in DMSO-d6 as the solvent. UV-Vis spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrometer from Shimadzu, Japan. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a TGA-2000 S system (SDT600, TA Germany) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Hole mobility in the solid ionic conductor has been investigated according to the process reported in the literature. In brief, a ∼35 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was made on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) deposited by the spin coating technique, which was then heated at 100 °C for 20 min. The solution of SOICs in chlorobenzene was spin coated at 1700 rpm and this film was covered by Al as back contact of device. The J–V characteristics of the device were measured with a Keithley 2450 source measure unit. Raman spectra were collected by using an RFS 100/S FT-Raman spectrometer with a Nd:YAG laser source and Ge diode detector. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using Solartron 1260 + 1287 interfaces and data were analyzed using CorrView and Zplot software (Scribner's Associates Inc.). Impedance data were collected with a sweeping frequency from 120 kHz to 0.1 Hz having an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The diffusion coefficient of I−/I3− in the different electrolytes was determined by the EIS method. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) for solid electrolyte was recorded by sandwiched them between two Pt-coated conducting glass (FTO). The thickness of electrolyte was 25 μm and scan rate was 50 mV s−1. CV in the dissolved liquid was carried out using a three-electrode system in which a Pt disk, Pt wire and non-aq. Ag/Ag+ served as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, and a TBAPF6 supporting electrolyte with a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated ss-DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2450 digital source meter controlled by a computer scan rate of 10 mV s−1. A solar simulator (PET 80AAA, USA), with 500 W xenon lamp with AM1.5G filter served as the light source. The intensity of illuminated light was 100 mW cm−1 calibrated with standard NREL. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was recorded using a Newport Oriel IQE-200, where a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp was used as the light source. The thickness of films was ascertained by performing cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM, LEOS-440i). Emission spectra were recorded using Ocean Optics Instruments, USA, with 405 nm excitation wavelength.


A detailed synthesis protocol of all four organic ionic solid conductors (SJE 1 to SJE 4) is presented in Scheme 2. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds along with the intermediates were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and mass spectroscopy (Fig. S2–S7, ESI).

All compounds possess melting points > 100 °C. Fundamentally, the thermal stability of solid organic ionic conductors (SOICs) is an important factor for their possible application as an electrolyte in ss-DSSCs. Fig. 1 shows thermogravimetric analysis curves of the SOICs, SJE 1 to SJE 4.
The TGA curves were recorded under a nitrogen flow from room temperature, 20 °C, to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All ionic conductors exhibited one stage decomposition behaviour with stability temperature at about 170 °C, which is quite comparable to/better than other reported organic solid ionic conductors (please see Table 1). This indicates that all SOICs are thermally stable and suitable for solar cell applications. Along with thermal stability, ionic conductivity is also a critical factor for the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Therefore, the ionic conductivity of the PTZ/POZ based organic ionic conductors with IMI/BIMI was characterized by the EIS technique. The Nyquist plots of the electrolytes are given in Fig. S8 and the intercept of the inclined line on the real axis at high frequency was considered as the bulk resistance. The ionic conductivities of SJE 1 to 4 were calculated from the following equation and the values are summarized in Table 2.
(1)
where
σ = conductivity in mS cm−1, Rs = resistance of electrolytes, l = thickness between two symmetric electrodes and A is the active surface area of the electrode. A perusal of conductivity data presented in Table 2 shows that POZ donor-substituted IMI/BIMI displays higher conductivity values compared to PTZ donor-based electrolytes. Surprisingly, the ionic conductivity of these SOICs is almost 10 fold higher than that of alkyl substituted imidazolium iodide based organic ionic crystals with and without additives. The higher conductivity observed in additive-free (I2, LiI etc.), PTZ/POZ substituted IMI/BIMI may originate from charge transfer from the closely packed iodides in the absence of iodine, by the Grotthuss type mechanism. The presence of iodine in the SOIC due to contamination or oxidation was checked by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S9). The Raman spectra of SJE 1 to 4 confirm the presence of iodine or triiodide in small quantities. Hence, it might be possible that the shorter distance between iodides in ionic organic conductor results into Grotthuss type bond exchange mechanism in the presence of trace amount of triiodides. Alternatively, there is an equal possibility of contribution from strong electron donating groups, PTZ/POZ as charge carriers. To check this charge carrier behaviour, hole mobility measurements for ionic conductors SJE 1 to 4 were carried out by fabricating hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SOIC/Al). The hole mobility was calculated from the space charge limited current (SCLC) by eqn (2):

(2)
where
J = current density, εr = dielectric constant of the material (normally taken to be 3 for organic semiconductors), ε0 = vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μ = hole mobility, V = applied bias and L = film thickness. The hole mobility data for all SOICs are given in the last column of Table 2.

The hole mobility value increases from 1.64 × 10−5 to 2.85 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 when PTZ (SJE 1) was replaced with POZ (SJE 2) on the benzimidazolium cation (Fig. S10). This trend continues in the case of imidazolium based SOICs (SJE 3 & 4). The higher hole mobility capacity of the POZ substituted benzimidazolium/imidazolium cation is attributed to the good electron donating power compared with PTZ. Hence, POZ contributes predominantly to the overall enhancement in the conductivity of SJE 2 and 4. To determine the contribution from the electron donating moieties, with POZ as hole carriers, hole mobility measurements for intermediates [4] and [6] (before I− salt formation), corresponding to SJE 2 and SJE 4 respectively, were carried out. Hole mobility values for SJE 2 and 4 (2.85 × 10−5 and 2.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) as well as their respective intermediates (1.43 × 10−5 and 1.40 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) with subtle differences were obtained. This observation concretely provides confirmation that the introduction of iodide ion enhances the hole mobility character along with conductivity in POZ/PTZ substituted BIMI/IMI SOICs.
To investigate the interfacial compatibility of solid electrolytes and catalytic activity of the Pt-counter electrode, CV was carried out in symmetrical Pt-cell geometry. The solid electrolytes (SJE 1–4) were sandwiched between two Pt-electrodes. Clear redox peaks were observed for all the four SOICs and are depicted in Fig. 2. The upper and lower peaks in the figure are attributed to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3− and I3−/I− respectively.
POZ substituted IMI/BIMI based electrolytes (SJE 2 and 4) have two fold higher peak current densities (40 μA cm−2 and 35 μA cm−2) than the values for PTZ substituted IMI/BIMI based electrolytes (SJE 1 and 3). As imidazolium/benzimidazolium cations and Pt-electrodes are identical for all the cases, the larger peak current for POZ based electrolytes (SJE 2 and 4) confirms faster charge transfer than that of PTZ based electrolytes (SJE 1 and 3). The level of the peak current is characteristic of the catalytic activity of the Pt-electrode toward the electrolyte and the charge transfer rate. Faster charge transfer in POZ based electrolytes is attributed to a smaller interlayer distance and as a consequence, POZ based solid electrolytes exhibit higher conductivity than PTZ-based ones. These results are in good agreement with the conductivity and hole mobility data that confirm the role of the donor moieties, POZ and PTZ.

ss-DSSCs with all four SOICs, SJE 1–4, as single component electrolytes were fabricated. The thickness of active layers, dye sensitized TiO2 and SOIC in the ss-DSSC device is measured from the cross-sectional SEM image (with a 25 μm spacer) (Fig. 3 and S1(b)). SEM image confirms 9 μm and 2 μm thickness of the sensitized TiO2 layer and SOIC layers respectively.

The ss-DSSC devices were evaluated under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) and dark conditions. The photo-current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solid state electrolytes based devices with the metal free organic sensitizer SK 1 are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are depicted in Table 3.

The ss-DSSCs with POZ substitution (SJE 2 and 4) in the solid electrolyte produced ∼5.7% efficiencies which are quite high compared to PTZ based devices. Moreover, the observed higher photocurrent densities in ss-DSSCs based on POZ substituted solid ionic conductors (SJE 2 and 4) are attributed to the higher conductivity and hole mobility compared to PTZ substituted SOICs. The observed Voc values are promising as additives like TBP (tert-butyl pyridine) and iodine were not used, otherwise these additives are used for the improvement of Voc. Moreover, solid electrolytes composed of the imidazolium cation exhibit higher Voc than benzimidazolium cation based devices. This is because of the energy level difference between the TiO2 conduction band and redox potentials of electrolytes.
Here IMI based electrolytes show more positive redox potential than BIMI electrolytes (Table 2) and it is completely reflected in the Voc performance of all devices.
In order to see the actual effect of POZ/PTZ substitution on BIMI/IMI based solid electrolytes, the ss-DSSC device with pristine benzimidazolium iodide as an electrolyte was also fabricated (note: IMI based ss-DSSC was not fabricated due to its original liquid state). This device with BIMI (without PTZ/POZ) showed very poor efficiency (please see the ESI, Fig. S11, η = 1.35(±0.5)%, Jsc = 7.26(±0.3) mA cm−2, Voc = 0.491(±0.1) V and FF = 42(±1.2)%). The efficiency obtained from POZ substituted BIMI/IMI is much higher than that obtained from unsubstituted SOICs. As mentioned in Table 1, our reported PCE values of ss-DSSCs are better than other devices based on various SOICs in the absence of additives. Additionally, it is comparable with the DMPII/MIBI based electrolytes in the presence of additives with N719 as the sensitizer. It is worth mentioning that the SK 1 based DSSC with a typical liquid electrolyte (0.5 M TBP, 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, in acetonitrile) and a ZnO semiconductor exhibited PCE of 4.7% (Jsc = 12.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.629 V and FF = 61.2%), which is quite comparable with POZ substituted IMI based ss-DSSCs under similar conditions without any additives. Moreover, this PCE is also higher than that involving spiro-OMeTAD without any additives and post-treatments. The thickness of SOICs in ss-DSSC devices is governed by the thickness of the spacer used for sealing the device. The above photovoltaic parameters were obtained with a 25 μm thick spacer (the actual obtained thickness of SOICs is ∼2 μm). In order to see the effect of thickness of the solid electrolyte on photovoltaic parameters, a ss-DSSC with a 60 μm spacer (net thickness of the SOIC is ∼5 μm) was fabricated.
Fig. S12 shows the J–V characteristics of DSSCs with the best performing SJE 2 and 4 SOICs having a thickness of ∼ 5 μm. The obtained photovoltaic parameters are depicted in Table 3. From the data it is revealed that the photocurrent density and PCE monotonically decrease with an increase in the thickness of the SOIC layer. The Voc values show a marginal difference, while noticeable decreases in Jsc were observed. This drop in Jsc values is due to the longer ionic diffusion path in the 60 μm thick spacer compared with the 25 μm thickness. Such observations are common in the case of solid state electrolytes based ss-DSSCs.
The IPCE curves with solid state UV-vis spectra for the devices with the best efficiencies (SJE 2 and 4) are depicted in Fig. 5. The POZ substituted solid ionic conductor SJE 4 along with SK 1 absorbs visible light in the range from 350 nm to 650 nm. Hence, we observed an increment in IPCE values of the cell with SJE 4 and SJE 2 compared to the unsubstituted benzimidazolium based ss-DSSC with the SK 1 sensitizer. The IPCE particularly at around 450 nm increased from ∼30% to 62%, when POZ was introduced on the benzimidazolium moieties (Fig. 5(a)). This increase in IPCE (∼32%) is mainly attributed to presence of the good electron donor moiety, POZ in BIMI/IMI which governs enhancement in conductivity. As IPCE is a signature of light harvesting, electron injection, dye regeneration and charge collection, the noticeable enhancement of IPCE should be attributed to the enhancement in the light harvesting property of the dye because of the efficient electron donor POZ group. To visualise the synergetic effect of SK 1 and POZ donor substituted IMI/BIMI, the solid state UV spectra were taken for dye sensitized electrodes with and without the layer of SJE (Fig. 5(b)). The figure clearly indicates the overall increment in absorbance (∼65 nm) which might be responsible for higher PCE values in ss-DSSCs. The UV-vis spectra of pure SK 1 and SJE 1–4 in acetonitrile are given in Fig. S13 and confirm the better overlapping of absorbance maxima between SK 1 and SJE 4.
Similar trends, i.e., red shift in absorbance maxima, broadening of absorbance peaks and increase in absorbance intensity were noticed in the absorbance-emission spectra (ESI, Fig. S14) of the sensitizer in the presence of all SOICs. In order to understand the clear role of the POZ/PTZ group, the HOMO and LUMO levels (Scheme 3) of POZ/PTZ based imidazole/benzimidazole intermediates without the introduction of I− and the redox potential of solid ionic conductor SJE 4 (Table 2) were determined from CV, UV-Vis spectra and computational (DFT) calculation (please see Fig. 6 and S14 and Table S1). As shown in Scheme 3, the LUMO levels of POZ/PTZ substituted IMI/BIMI intermediate moieties are located just above the LUMO of SK 1 and conduction band of TiO2. Hence, the presence POZ/PTZ in IMI/BIMI enhances the electron injection capacity of SK 1 in the titania photoanode. The result indicates that the introduction of highly electron reach donor groups, POZ/PTZ, enhances the conductivity as well as light harvesting properties of dyes significantly, which is mainly responsible for the better solar cell performance of the ss-DSSCs based on ionic conductors SJE 2 and 4.
Further, to understand the effect of POZ/PTZ substitution on BIMI/IMI, CV study for SJE 1–4 was carried out in the liquid phase and the voltammograms are shown in Fig. 6(a). For comparison, CV curves of the pure dye, intermediate of (before I− salt formation) BIMI and SJE 2 are given in Fig. 6(b). The solid organic ionic conductor (SJE 2) in the solution form shows three reversible redox processes.
Out of these three oxidation peaks, the first two are attributed to the BIMI salt (see Fig. 6), while the third peak at about 0.5 V vs. Ag/Ag+ corresponds to the presence of the electron donor moiety POZ. The HOMO level (1.05 V vs. NHE) is calculated from the CV curves, which is higher than the HOMO of SK 1; this indicates that POZ based SJE 2 has efficient hole extraction capability along with ionic diffusion through I−. However, the calculated LUMO level of the SJE 4 intermediate (−1.53 V vs. NHE) allows sufficient offset to the LUMO level of SK 1 (−0.78 V vs. NHE). This not only inhibits the electrons from SK 1 but also facilitates electron transfer at the interface when organic solid ionic conductors were excited (Scheme 3). Hence, all these results support the higher power conversion efficiency of ss-DSSC devices based on POZ substituted BIMI/IMI without any additives.
To investigate the interfacial charge transfer and recombination dynamics at the TiO2 photoanode and solid ionic conductor, EIS was used.Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plots of ss-DSSCs with solid ionic conductors SJE 1–4 measured under −0.7 V bias. In the Nyquist plot, three typical semicircles are observed.
The inset of Fig. 7 shows the equivalent circuit diagram used to fit the impedance spectrum and the parameters obtained from the fitted Nyquist plots are given in Table 4. The first arc which is attributed to the Rct at the platinum/electrolyte interface is a depressed semicircle, which is clearly visible upon magnification (inset of Fig. 7).

The fitting of the second arc yielded Rrec and CPE-P (a component of CPE) and the value of CPE-P is associated with the surface roughness and porosity of the photoelectrode. The charge transfer resistances, Rct, at the counter electrode are quite comparable for all the ss-DSSC devices with solid ionic conductors. However, a subtle difference in the Rrec values has been noticed. Rrec obtained from the middle frequency semicircle reveals the electron recombination at the photoanode and electrolyte interface. Among all the devices, higher values of Rrec were observed for devices based on SJE 2 and 4. This indicates that the recombination of electrons between the SK 1 sensitized TiO2 electrode and solid electrolytes is hindered. This observation is in good agreement with the noticed PCE trend, SJE 1 < SJE 3 < SJE 2 < SJE 4.
The effective electron lifetime, τn, of all ss-DSSC devices was determined by OCVD (Open Circuit Voltage Decay) measurement. In general, the OCVD method often uses kinetic parameters, which contains useful information on the rate constant of the electron transfer process in ss-DSSCs. This method involves turning OFF cell illumination in the steady state while monitoring the subsequent decay of open circuit voltage, Voc (Fig. 8(a)) The rate of Voc decay is proportional to the charge recombination rate. Thus, the electron life time can be calculated according to the following equation:
(3)
where
KBT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, and dVoc/dt is the derivative of Voc.

The electron lifetime (τn) as a function of Voc (V) is plotted in Fig. 8(b). The plotted curves show a linear relationship on a logarithmic scale, which indicates that the charge recombination reaction has a first order dependence on the electron concentration of the photoanodes.
A perusal of Fig. 8, the devices with POZ substituted benzimidazolium (SJE 2)/imidazolium (SJE 4), shows the longest electron life times. However, on changing the cation from imidazolium (SJE 4) to benzimidazolium (SJE 2) with POZ, the electron lifetime remains nearly unchanged, and for a given cation POZ substitution increases the electron lifetime. This indicates that donor moieties have significant influence on the conductivity and PCE compared to unsubstituted cations. Hence, SJE 2 and 4 based devices with extended electron lifetimes influenced the improvement of Voc and Jsc.
These results support the conclusion drawn in the previous discussion. The long-term stability of the outperforming ss-DSSC devices (with SJE 2 and SJE 4) was investigated under the illumination of 1 sun light (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 9 depicts the variation of Jsc, FF, Voc and PCE% as a function of time (h) for DSSCs with SJE 2 and 4, and demonstrates that the devices are stable for about 1000 h. The reasons behind the stability are (i) elimination of leakage problem due to solid electrolytes and (ii) photostability of SOICs. To study the photostability, solutions of SOICs in acetonitrile were irradiated under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G filter) and variation in absorbance as a function of time was monitored by UV-vis spectra (please see Fig. S15, ESI). From the figures, it is obvious that the photostability of the SOICs is responsible for the stability of the ss-DSSCs.

A novel kind of effective donor (PTZ/POZ) substituted BIMI/IMI based solid ionic conductors are designed, synthesized and applied as electrolytes in ss-DSSCs. The influence of PTZ/POZ introduction in BIMI/IMI on the electrochemical properties and ss-DSSC device performances was investigated. Because of unsaturation and the presence of hetero-atoms, POZ/PTZ possesses light harvesting and hole transporting properties, which resulted in increase in the conductivity of SOICs. As a result, in ss-DSSC devices the HOMO and LUMO levels of solid conductors are situated in such a way that they hinder the back electron transfer from the sensitizer to the solid electrolyte and facilitate effective electron injection in the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode. As a consequence, ss-DSSCs with POZ substituted (SJE 2 and SJE 4) SOIC, as a single component solid electrolyte, produced PCE of about 5.7%, which is quite comparable with that of conventional liquid electrolytes in the presence of various additives. In addition, a long-term stability study shows that the devices are very stable under continuous light soaking for about 1000 h. The present study of the high conductivity single component electron donor moieties containing solid ionic conductors paves the way for a new design of cost-effective highly conducting electrolytes for ss-DSSCs.
