A series of four quadrupolar (Donor)2Acceptor-acid (D2A) sensitizers, based on two acceptor cores (dibenzophenazine (DBP) or dithienophenazine (DTP)), were synthesized and their optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties were investigated. 4-Hexyl-thien-2-yl groups were employed as donor units, to produce regioisomers depending on their connecting position to the core. This architectural design leads to the investigation of the structure–property relationships of the dyes, both in solution and upon integration in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Within sets of regioisomers, frontier orbital levels and absorption properties differed, but the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs were similar. When examining the effect of the core, the electronic properties (absorbance, LUMO level) predicted a more favourable electron injection for the DTP systems. However, the open circuit voltages are ∼100 mV greater for the DBP systems.

In the quest to provide sustainable and affordable energy conversion systems, solar panels have garnered considerable interest. Inorganic based solar cells can reach efficiencies above 30% but the high temperatures and the strong vacuum required during manufacturing represent a large disadvantage. Organic solar cells are valuable in terms of processability, flexibility and aesthetics; however the “promised land” of commercially-profitable efficiency (PCE > 15%) has not yet been reached. Developed in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a hybrid system composed of metal complex or π-conjugated organic dyes adsorbed onto mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) films. These hybrid solar cells are an interesting approach, and new materials are leading to devices with efficiencies ranging from 10 to 15%, with the use of perovskite cells.

Organic dyes have been widely studied due to their ease of synthesis and purification, their use of cheap, non-metallic starting materials, and their great ability to absorb light. Most of the sensitizers that have been developed usually feature a donor–(π-bridge)–acceptor structure. Triphenylamine, coumarin, and indoline are examples of electron donating building blocks that provide highly stable and performing devices. In spite of the large availability of donating groups, the portfolio of acceptors remains fairly short. During our search for acceptor structures, we came across a previous report on dibenz[a,c]phenazine (DBP) derivatives, which demonstrated their high light absorptivity and their suitable frontier orbital energies levels for application in DSSCs. As systems with extended π-electrons and small reorganization energy represent a good route to enhance charge separation lifetimes, DBP is an interesting choice as a fused D–A core for organic dyes.
Recently, we have developed quadrupolar D2A sensitizers; based on carboxylic acid functionalized internally fused donor–acceptor dithienophenazine (A) cores flanked by thiophene donors (D). Upon investigation of their optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties, we demonstrated that these dyes were suitable for electron injection into TiO2, and we established that increasing the number of external thiophenes from two to six units enhances the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the short circuit current (Jsc) by 60 mV and of 4 mA cm−2, respectively.
In this study, we further explore the structure–property relationships of these quadrupolar D2A sensitizers by investigating the influence of the nature of the acceptor “cores”. Dithienophenazine (DTP) and dibenzophenazine (DBP) units were chosen as candidates for the cores, as shown in Fig. 1. To note, preliminary characterization of the DTP dyes have been reported by our group previously.
As illustrated by the structures in Fig. 2, two external thiophene units were covalently attached to the core at two different positions for DBP, and using two isomers for DTP; leading to a set of four isomeric structures. These isomers are either linear (L), where the conjugation is continuous along the donor units, or branched (B), where the conjugation extends through the acceptor (see red highlighted bonds in Fig. 2). Fig. 2 also presents photographs of the dyes in solution in which the colors can be linked to the absorption and emission spectra, as discussed later in this report. Using a combination of computational, electrochemical and spectroscopic methods, we show that the optical and electronic properties vary with the nature of the core, and the isomerism of the systems. We also evaluate the photophysical properties of the excited states. After integrating the sensitizers into DSSCs, we observe that the core affects the open circuit voltage, while only having a minor effect on the short circuit current.

All starting materials and reagents were purchased from known commercial sources, and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. Acetonitrile and toluene were taken from a solvent purification system box. Starting compounds 1,2b,4,6 and 8 were synthesized as described in the literature. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Mercury 300, Gemini 300, Bruker 400 or on an Inova 500. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solvent peaks. Some compounds had limited solubility, due to the formation of three-centered H bonding, which precluded the acquisition of 13C NMR spectra. High-resolution mass spectrometry was performed by the spectroscopic services in the Chemistry Department of the University of Florida with an Agilent 6210 TOF, a Finnigan MAT 95Q Hybrid Sector or a Bruker APEX II FTICR. FTIR measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One FTIR outfitted with a LiTaO3 detector. Melting points were taken with a VWR Melt-Temp digital apparatus and are reported without further corrections.


Each geometry optimization was carried out in the gas phase using the B3LYP† and B3PW91† hybrid functionals and 6-31G(d) basis set. Frequency calculations were used to characterize the stationary point obtained. TDDFT was performed at the B3PW91/6-31G(d)//B3PW91/6-31G(d) level of theory given the better correlation of the frontier orbital energies to the experimental results than those obtained using B3LYP (vide infra). The spectra were simulated with a Doppler broadening, and the full width at half maximum was of 8. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 software package†, and the orbitals were represented using the Chemcraft 1.6 program with 0.03 e bohr−3 chosen as the isodensity value.


Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry experiments were performed using an EG&G Princeton Applied Research model 273A potentiostat–galvanostat in an argon filled dry box. The solutions were made from 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), previously recrystallized from ethanol, in freeze–pump–thawed benzonitrile as the supporting electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a platinum flag as the counter electrode, a Ag/Ag+ (containing 10 mM AgNO3 in 0.5 M TBAPF6–ACN) as the reference electrode and a platinum button purchased from Bioanalytical Systems as the working electrode. Scans were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple, taken to be 5.12 eV below vacuum.


UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 (Varian) spectrophotometer. Steady state emission spectra were recorded on a spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International and rectified using correction factors generated with a primary standard lamp. Fluorescence lifetimes were determined on a Picoquant FluoTime 100 time-correlated single photon counting instrument. Concentrations of solutions were kept low (O.D. ∼ 0.2) to avoid excimer formation. Absorption and emission spectroscopy measurements were made in 3 mL quartz cuvettes containing 2 mL of freshly prepared oligomer solutions in toluene. Transient absorption measurements were conducted on a home-built apparatus, using a Continuum Surelite II Nd:YAG II-10 laser for excitation and Princeton PI-Max intensified CCD camera coupled with a spectrograph as detector, and the probe source was a Perkin-Elmer LS1130-3 pulsed xenon lamp. Excitation energies were ∼ 6–7 mJ per pulse. Spectra were recorded in a 12 mL quartz flow cell containing 10 mL of oligomer solution in toluene. The optical density (355 nm) was adjusted to 0.7 and the solutions were purged with argon for 30 min prior to transient absorption measurements. The initial delay was 70 ns, and the camera time step increments were 4 μs each. Singlet oxygen emission was determined on a PTI near-infrared emission spectrometer equipped with an InGaAs detector. Singlet oxygen quantum yields were determined from plots of 1O2 emission intensity as a function of the optical density of sensitizer at 337 nm using terthiophene (ΦΔ = 0.70) as the actinometer.


The TiO2 sol was prepared according to a literature procedure, and the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode and platinum cathode were prepared according to the literature. Two holes (1 mm diam.) were drilled into the FTO/platinum glass cathodes for electrolyte solution injection. A solution of 0.2 mM of dye in DMF was stirred overnight, and the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in the solution for 36 h. After rinsing with DMF and acetone to remove the unbound dye, the electrodes were placed under vacuum for 2 h for further drying. The dried electrodes and platinum cathodes were sealed together with Surlyn (Solaronix Meltonix 1170-25). Electrolyte solution containing 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-(n-propyl)imidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in butyronitrile was injected into the sealed device. For incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) characterization, an Oriel Apex monochromator illuminator (100 W xenon lamp) coupled with a 1/4 m Oriel Cornerstone spectrometer was used to illuminate the cell with monochromatic light. The photocurrent response was recorded under short circuit conditions at 10 nm intervals using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with an energy meter (S350, UDT Instruments).


To a round-bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar and a condenser, was added the diketone (1 equiv.), ethyl-3,4-diaminobenzoate (1.2 equiv.), ethanol 200 proof (150 mL g−1 of diketone) and 1 mL of acetic acid. The resulting mixture was brought to reflux for 2 hours, and allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting solids were filtered, rinsed with plenty of methanol and air dried to give the corresponding products.

As presented in Scheme 1, 2,7-dibromophenanthrene-9,10-dione (1) was condensed with ethyl-3,4-diaminobenzoate (2a) or 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (2b) to afford the corresponding compounds 3a and 3b in excellent yields (91–96%). Compounds 3a and 3b were coupled with 4-hexyl-2-trimethylstannyl-thiophene via Stille coupling to afford DBP-L and its subsequent acid DBP-La in moderate yields (41–50%). The same conditions were used in the synthesis of the branched isomer and its corresponding acid derivative, DBP-B and DBP-Ba, with yields of 90–91% for the condensation and 53–66% for the Stille coupling.

Similarly, the synthesis of DTP-L, DTP-La, DTP-B, and DTP-Ba was carried out via a condensation with 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid or ethyl-3,4-diaminobenzoate followed by Stille coupling with 4-hexyl-2-trimethylstannyl-thiophene (Scheme 2). The yields were moderate (90–98% for the first step and 45–62% for the second step).
Because of their good solubility in organic solvents, the ethyl ester protected dyes were used for optical and spectroscopic characterizations. Carboxylic acid derivatives, being less soluble, were used for adsorption onto TiO2 nanoparticles and characterization of IPCE and J–V responses.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to gain insight about the geometric and electronic properties of the DBP and DTP family of sensitizers. Hexyl substituents on the thiophenes were omitted to simplify the calculations. Illustrations of the frontier orbitals for compounds DBP-L and DBP-B are presented in Fig. 3 and in Fig. S1 for DTP-L and DTP-B. For all compounds, the LUMO is a π* orbital delocalized across the quinoxaline moiety (Fig. 3, top). For the HOMOs, a minimal change in the structure produces a noticeable overall change: the wave function is delocalized along the thiophene donor framework for the linear isomers (L) (Fig. 3, bottom left) and delocalized through the entire molecule for the branched isomers (B) (Fig. 3, bottom right).

When comparing the DBPs with the DTPs, the nature of the core negligibly influences the LUMO orbital density: both families have a similar orbital shape centered on the acceptor core. For the HOMO, more electron density is observed on the nitrogen of the core of DTP-L compared to DBP-L, but the electron density is mainly delocalized across the donors. There is a greater difference when comparing the HOMOs of the B systems: for DTP-B, there is an obvious contribution of the sulphur atoms that is absent in DTP-L (Fig. S1, bottom right); for DBP-B, a larger contribution of the acridine moiety to the orbital density is noted.
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were performed in the gas phase to characterize the nature of the vertical transitions. The computed properties of the excited states agree well with the empirical results, particularly concerning the simulated and empirical UV-visible profiles (Fig. S2). In Table 1, column 3 represents the energies associated with peak transitions observed in toluene and column 4 summarizes the calculated vertical transition energies. The similarities found between these values (with differences varying between 0.04 eV to 0.20 eV) and the good correlation found between extinction coefficients (column 2, Table 1) and oscillator strengths (column 5, Table 1) validate the parameters used for our calculations. For all dyes, the low energy transitions are predominantly HOMO → LUMO transitions.

UV-visible spectra in toluene show strong and well defined bands at 290–350 nm and 400–440 nm for DBPs and at 340–400 nm and 480–520 nm for DTPs (Fig. 4). Higher energy bands are attributed to local π–π* transitions and lower energy bands correspond to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) type of transition with π–π* character. For DTP-B compounds, the absorption peak coalesces at 480 nm. This is similarly observed by Meyer et al. and corresponds to two transitions: HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO. When comparing isomers, the extinction coefficients in the ICT region are higher for the B compounds. This can be correlated to the better overlap of the frontier orbitals (Fig. 3). When comparing cores, the DTPs are red-shifted compared to the DBPs, due to the stronger donating ability of the thiophene unit. As a result, this simple benzene to thiophene alteration permits the absorption of less energetic (by 0.3 eV) photons.

All compounds show fluorescence, with maximum emissions at 432 nm (DBP-B, quantum yield: 0.29), 500 nm (DTP-B, quantum yield: 0.04), 540 nm (DBP-L, quantum yield: 0.16) and 630 nm (DTP-L, quantum yield: 0.16). These results correlate well with the colours and fluorescence intensities observed in the photos of the dyes under UV light in Fig. 2. Interestingly, DTP-B has the lowest fluorescence quantum yield of the series of sensitizers, highlighting the efficiency of the non-radiative compared to the radiative relaxation in this compound. A competition between intersystem crossing (ISC) and internal conversion (IC) in the DBP systems was observed previously, and it is likely to be the case in our family of compounds. To verify this, we carried out transient absorption spectroscopy studies and oxygen sensitization experiments to evaluate the nature of the various excited state decay pathways. This will be discussed in subsequent sections.

While all dyes showed reversible reductions, they exhibited irreversible oxidations, as the production of the cation radical leads to dimerization or oligomerization processes. Because of the poor solubility of the dyes in propylene carbonate and acetonitrile, measurements were carried out in benzonitrile, which conveniently has a wide electrochemical window. Fig. 5 presents the differential pulse voltammograms, and illustrates that the reduction potentials range from −1.8 V to −1.4 V vs. Fc/Fc+. The corresponding cyclic voltammograms are illustrated in Fig. S3. The electron affinities of series B are 0.2 eV lower than the corresponding L isomers, following the trend of the LUMO energies from DFT calculations. When comparing the cores, the DTPs have a lower reduction potential than the DBPs.

Due to the irreversibility of the oxidation process, the HOMO energies were calculated by subtracting the optical energy gap, obtained via UV-visible spectroscopy, from the reduction potential, acquired by electrochemistry. As pointed out by Brédas, this approximation ignores the exciton binding energy built into the optical gap, so the quantitative energy levels bear a margin of error.
In Fig. 6, we present a direct comparison of the experimental and calculated energy levels, and the corresponding data is gathered in Table S1. The LUMO levels are higher than the TiO2 CB and the HOMO levels are deeper than the redox potential of the iodine–triiodide couple, showing the thermodynamic plausibility for an electron transfer to the metal oxide and regeneration of the neutral species of the dye upon photoexcitation. As expected, some variations from calculations and experiments are seen. We used two hybrid functional sets, B3LYP and B3PW91. Both are known to overestimate the LUMO levels of molecules having donor–acceptor character and Brédas and others suggested using a long range correction functional to counter this issue.
Interestingly, the values obtained with the B3PW91 functionals are closer to the empirical values than those obtained with B3LYP suggesting that, for these fused donor–acceptor systems, the non-local correlation functional provided by Perdew–Wang matches the experiments closer than the correlation functional provided by Lee, Yang and Parr. Both functionals show similar trends for HOMO values, and the trends are more mixed for the LUMO values. Overall, the LUMO values are close for each dye, implying that the LUMO is governed by the acceptor functionality. For the HOMO, the energies have a larger variation, highlighting the importance of the substituent and the pattern of substitution of the sensitizers.


Table 2 compiles the fluorescence, ISC, and IC rates (kf, kISC, and kIC, respectively) – computed using the fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yields – and the singlet and triplet lifetime values. Fluorescence decays for the dyes were measured in toluene solutions, and in each case the decays were well fit by a monoexponential (first order) model. All of the dyes exhibit moderately efficient fluorescence with quantum yields in excess of 10%, except for DTP-B. Moreover, the L isomers have longer fluorescence lifetimes than the B isomers; this trend is similar to that observed in previous studies on DBP derivatives.

In thiophene-based conjugated oligomers, photoexcitation produces a singlet excited state which undergoes moderately efficient ISC to generate a long-lived triplet excited state. Consistent with this general behaviour, the singlet oxygen measurements indicate that ISC is efficient in the DTB and DTP compounds. Thus, to probe the triplet excited state further, nanosecond transient absorption (TA) studies were carried out in degassed toluene solutions, and the resulting difference absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 7.
All of the compounds exhibit TA extending through the visible region (λex = 355 nm), with pronounced ground state bleaching for the B series. The comparatively long transient lifetimes (4–7 μs) and presence of oxygen-induced quenching suggest that the TA signal is due to the triplet–triplet absorption. The amplitude of the TA signal observed for DTP-L is considerably weaker compared to the other compounds. This agrees with the singlet oxygen yield measurements (ΦΔ), and implies that the triplet yield is low for DTP-L.
The rate of ISC assumes that the efficiency of triplet–triplet energy transfer from the chromophore to the ground state O2 is 100%. In general, the radiative rates vary from 107 to 108 s−1, which is consistent with the charge-transfer nature of the lowest singlet states. In all systems, the yield of triplet formation is superior to all other possible relaxation paths from the singlet manifold, assuming that Kasha's rule holds true. This confirms the previous hypothesis of Estrada and Neckers, stating that the photophysics of DBP derivatives is largely dominated by the phenazine functionality, which itself undergoes ISC with remarkable efficiency (kISC ∼ 1012 s−1). As seen previously, the exception to this group of chromophores is DTP-L, which presents a dominant IC. Judging by the redox potentials, the closest redox gap exhibited by this molecule is likely to favour a charge separation notwithstanding the low polarity environment.

The carboxylic acid derivatives DBP-La, DBP-Ba, DTP-La and DTP-Ba were adsorbed onto mesoporous TiO2 films from DMF solution. To allow for the comparison of the cell performance with the different sensitizers, one set of conditions (solvent, electrolyte and additives) was tested. In this fundamental study, we did not seek to optimize the conditions by meticulously exploring the effects of solvent, electrolyte and additive on the cell performance, and thus, cell results should be viewed as being “unoptimized.” Standard deviations for the devices parameters, presented in Table S2, show the reproducibility of our measurements. In this setting, the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the N3 dye is 3.3%. Incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) under monochromatic illumination, and current–voltage (J–V) response under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm2) were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 8. The IPCE tracks the absorption spectrum of the sensitizers as observed by solution UV-visible spectroscopy. DTP-L and DTP-B are red shifted compared with the other sensitizers. DBP-B has the highest IPCE of 50% at 425 nm. For the current–voltage response, two effects can be seen. The first one is the effect of the nature of the core on the Voc. The DTP series have Voc of ∼420 mV while the DBP series have a Voc of ∼500 mV. The Voc is determined by the potential difference between the Fermi-level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. A rise in Voc can be attributed to a shift of the TiO2 CB, to the surface blocking caused by a different dye loading, or to a different electrolyte–dye interaction. In our case, given the similar structure of the dyes and the uniform conditions used, we speculate that the variation in the Voc is most likely due to the shift of the TiO2 CB. This is supported by numerous empirical and theoretical studies that relate the sensitizer structure with the TiO2 CB shift. These studies report that a sensitizer with stronger donor units improve both the electrostatic and charge transfer effect on the TiO2 surface, hence raising the TiO2 CB and ultimately, the Voc. In our study, we show that the nature of the acceptor unit matters. In these D2A sensitizers, the acceptor DTP core is a more electron-rich system; however, the resulting Voc is smaller than with the DBP core. When examining the short circuit current (Jsc), the L systems exhibit lower values than the B systems. This slight increase has been seen in our previous study and can be correlated with the IPCE data, where the B systems have a higher overall IPCE than the L systems.


A thorough study of quadrupolar D2A sensitizers has been carried out, both in solution and upon integration into DSSCs. The nature of the acceptor moiety was changed from dithienophenazine to dibenzophenazine. This slight change induces a noticeable change in the solution optoelectronic properties. The nature of the core impacts the photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties: in solution, the DTPs have a smaller energy gap, a higher HOMO, greater fluorescence and non-radiative rate constants. When integrated into DSSCs, the Voc is ∼80 mV greater for the DBPs, and this change is likely due to an increase of the TiO2 CB. Interestingly, when comparing isomeric sensitizers, they also present different optoelectronic properties: the branched dyes have a higher overlapping of the frontier orbital density, a smaller injection barrier for injection into TiO2 and a greater ISC access. Upon integration into DSSCs, the IPCE curves differ, and this change can be directly correlated to the overlap of the frontier orbital density, overall influencing the Jsc to a small extent. The fill factors are independent of the isomer used. We have shown in this study that the fine-tuning of sensitizers is important for the fundamental understanding of the properties, and the photovoltaic results.

The outlook for using the quadrupolar (donor)2acceptor motif to design sensitizers for DSSC appears bright. While the overall DSSC performance in the present study is below the state of the art, the DSSC work reported here was on unoptimized cells, and without the use of additives or scattering TiO2 layers which are known to improve the overall power conversion efficiency. It is likely with such cell improvements the dyes reported here will give substantially higher PCE. Nonetheless, the concepts developed here give considerable insight into possible pathways for improving on the (donor)2acceptor motif. First, this work shows clearly that the DTP series absorbs at generally longer wavelengths compared to the DBP congeners; this is likely due to the higher HOMO level for the DTP dyes. Thus, it seems likely that by adding stronger donors onto the DTP-L or DTP-B cores will lead to further increase in their visible and near-infrared light harvesting properties. Second, as noted above, the DBP dyes give a higher Voc. While the specific origin of this effect is not clear, it may be possible to take advantage of the DPB core again by substitution of stronger donor moieties onto the DPB-L or DPB-B cores to increase the HOMO level leading to a red-shift of the primary visible absorption bands. These improvements will be explored in future work and will be reported in forthcoming communications.
