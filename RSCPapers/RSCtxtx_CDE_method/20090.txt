In the present study, new peripheral substituted Zn(II) and Cu(II) phthalocyanine derivatives (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc) bearing bulky aromatic triphenylamine groups were synthesized as alternative hole-transporting materials (HTMs). The structures of the new phthalocyanine derivatives (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc) were illuminated by various spectroscopic techniques such as mass spectrometry and 1H, and 13C-NMR. After structural analysis, their photophysical properties in solution and the solid phase were examined by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Using p-ZnPc and p-CuPc as HTMs, highly stable perovskite-based solar cells with the structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/p-ZnPc and p-CuPc/Ag have been developed and characterized. It was observed that our devices with p-ZnPc as the HTM maintain over 93% of the initial performance for more than 960 h under atmospheric conditions (22–27 °C) with 35–45% relative humidity. In addition, some strategies such as using various methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) blend ratios between 1:0.4 and 1:1.8 were employed to test the effect of the blend ratios on the long term stability of the perovskite-based solar cells. Our findings demonstrated that the spin-coated p-ZnPc based HTM demonstrated competitive power conversion efficiency and exhibited superior stability without encapsulation compared to commonly used HTMs.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising for use as a renewable energy source due to their high mobility, unique optoelectronic properties, and simple fabrication by solution-processing methods. Although perovskites initially demonstrated a power conversion of 3.8% in 2009, today the power conversion values have reached 25%. However, the instability problem observed in many PSCs under normal operating conditions (under 1 sun illumination at 27 °C and without UV filtration) is one of the main barriers to the successful commercialization of such devices. More recently, it was shown that the stability of the PSCs can be improved by different strategies such as by selecting appropriate hole transport materials (HTMs), by choosing appropriate electron transport layers, by solvent engineering, and optimizing the PSC encapsulation process. As one strategy for cost-effectiveness, choosing a suitable hole transport layer seems to be the most effective way to solve the instability problem in PSCs. In recent years, many research groups expended a considerable amount of attention on developing novel HTMs, and it has been proven that the stability in PSCs can be enhanced by modifying the HTM and perovskite interface. Therefore, considerable effort has been put into the process of HTM optimization in terms of stability and efficient semiconducting properties. Aside from cuprous oxide, copper(I) thiocyanate, and nickel oxide, triarylamine-based materials such as, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) have been widely utilized as HTMs in PSCs. However, both spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA need dopants such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (t-BP) to further improve the device performance and stability because of their low hole mobility and conductivity. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that these dopants absorb moisture from the air and thus shorten the life of the perovskite layer. Therefore, various dopant-free HTMs have been investigated to improve the stability of PSCs.

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) have been extensively used as an HTM in PSCs due to their high hole mobility, as well as excellent thermal, chemical, and photostability. Hence, it is of great importance to explore alternative and dopant-free HTMs with comparable or even superior properties relative to the widely used HTM, spiro-OMeTAD, and PTAA. More recently, a solution-processed tin Pc film has been successfully employed as HTM showing improved stability after 30 days in ambient air. It was reported by Ahmad and co-workers that Cu(II)Pc (tOctPhO)8CuPc (1) with 4-tert-octylphenol-substituted groups as the HTM in mixed PSC devices exhibited superior stability when compared to classical HTMs. Two tetra-alkyl (tetra-methyl and tetra-ethyl)-substituted Cu(II)Pc derivatives were employed as dopant-free HTMs in planar perovskite solar cells by Xu et al. It was reported that the alkyl substituents led to the enhancement of hydrophobicity, which was more favourable for long-term stability in PSC-based devices. All of the studies, as summarized above, on the long-term durability of perovskite solar cells focus on the storage period. Studies on the stability of PSCs under real operating conditions are quite limited.
Electron donor arylamine units reduce charge carrier mobility in arylamine-based compounds. Thus p-type dopants are needed. Also, these units reduce the charge extraction rate in the perovskite because of preventing the close contact between the perovskite and the HTM due to the conjugated structure and propeller conformation of arylamine units in HTMs. Arylamine groups like triphenylamine (TPA) are a well-known electron donor and have been widely used in small-molecule-based HTMs with electron-donor ability, suitable hole-transporting property, and high stability. Nevertheless, there is limited study on MPc-based HTMs having TPA substituted groups. In particular, Feng and co-workers showed that the PSCs using peripherally tetra TPA substituted CuPc (OMe-TPA-CuPc)-based HTMs exhibited a PCE of 19.7.
According to the literature, triphenylamine substituents on the Pc ring bring remarkable hole-transport properties, high thermal and chemical stabilities. In this work, the Pc ring was molecularly tailored by adding four TPA groups at the peripheral position through the oxygen atoms. To improve the solubility in common solvents as well as the hydrophobic quality a tert-butyl unit was appended as an alkyl group to TPA. In this respect, tetra-4-(bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino)phenoxy-substituted Cu and ZnPc derivatives (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc), were synthesized. The structures of the compounds are shown in Fig. 1. The optical and electrochemical properties of these compounds were characterized. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the p-ZnPc, and p-CuPc as HTMs on the long-term stability of PSCs under real operating conditions. For this purpose, PSCs were fabricated with and without a HTM to analyse the role of HTMs and explore the effect of using different materials on the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. It should be mentioned here that, as far as we know, there are no reports on the stability of PSCs under real operating conditions employing p-ZnPc, and p-CuPc as HTMs.

All solvents, reagents, and chemicals were of a reagent grade quality and obtained commercially from Sigma Aldrich, abcr, Fluka, and Merck. The infrared spectra were recorded between 4000 and 650 cm−1 using a PerkinElmer Spectrum100 FT-IR spectrometer with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory featuring a zinc selenide (ZnSe) crystal. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) measurements were performed on a Bruker Daltonics MicrOTOF. 1H NMR and 13C NMR experiments were performed using three different spectrometers; 400 MHz Varian and 400 MHz Bruker Avance II and Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometers with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard and chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm, in THF-d8, CDCl3, and DMSO-d6. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of solutions were recorded using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian, USA). Fluorescence lifetimes (τ) were measured by the Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) method using a NanoLED 570-LH (λexc = 510 nm) and a Horiba Jobin Yvon SPEX FLUOROLOG-3 spectrofluorometer (FL3-2IHR) equipped with a standard air-cooled R928 PMT detector. 3D-Fluorescence excitation–emission matrix analysis was performed using a TCSPC module. The slit width was selected as 5 nm and the pathlength was 1 cm for all experiments which were performed at room temperature. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV 2600 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry measurement (SWV) studies were performed using a Gamry Interface 1010 E potentiostat/galvanostat, ZRA model.


4-(tert-Butyl)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (3) and 4-(bis(4-(tert-butyl) phenyl)amino)phenol (4) were synthesized following the literature and the characterization data are given in ESI Fig. S1–S8.


4-(Bis(4-(tert-butyl) phenyl)amino)phenol (4) (500 mg, 1.33 mmol), 4-nitrophthalonitrile (230 mg, 1.33 mmol) and 5 mL of dry DMF were added to a reaction flask in an Ar(g) atmosphere. After stirring for 15 minutes, 735 mg (5.32 mmol) of K2CO3 was slowly added to the reaction mixture in portions and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. After the reaction was completed, it was poured into a water-ice mixture and precipitated. It was filtered using vacuum filtration equipment and purified with silica column chromatography using a 100:1 DCM:EtOH elute. Yield 89% (595 mg), yellow, C34H33N3O, molecular weight 499.66 g mol−1.

General procedure: A mixture of PN (300 mg, 0.60 mmol), anhydrous metal salts (Zn(OAc)2), (55 mg, 0.30 mmol), CuCl2, (41 mg, 0.30 mmol) and penthanol (1 ml) was added to a reaction flask and stirred until dissolution. Then 200 μL of DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) were added, heated and stirred for 24 h under reflux conditions in an Ar(g) atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, ethanol (100 ml) was added to the mixture, and the solid part separated with the centrifuge. Finally, the product was isolated by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:EtOH 1:1).

The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) techniques and carried out on three-electrode systems, using Pt disk (3 mm) as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. The measurements were carried out in 0.1 M NBu4PF6 (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate) as the supporting electrolyte in DCM media at 25 °C, and the solution was purged with N2(g) for 15 min before the measurements were taken. The ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+) was used as an internal standard to calculate the HOMO/LUMO energy level at −4.8 eV.


During the fabrication of PSCs investigated in this study, patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide glasses (FTO) and a methylammonium iodide (MAI) lead iodide (PbI2) blend were used as the substrate and the active layer, respectively. The FTO was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone (for 10 min), DI-water (for 5 min), isopropyl alcohol (for 10 min), and then again DI-water (for 10 min), and dried under nitrogen gas. 0.2 M SnO2 precursor solution was prepared from tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O) in ultra-pure ethanol, and then spin-coated on the patterned FTO coated glass substrates at 3200 rpm for 40 s. Then, SnO2 films were heat-treated at 140 °C for 20 min to ensure that a dense electron transport layer (ETL) was formed. A mixture of MAI and PbI2 containing different ratios of PbI2 (ranging from 0.0 to 1.8) was used as the active layer in the fabricated devices, to systematically investigate the effect of the PbI2 in the blend on the long-term stability of the devices under real operating conditions. During this study, the MAI ratio was kept constant at 1.0. Precursor solutions for the perovskite layer were prepared by mixing the appropriate amounts of MAI and PbI2 in DMF:DMSO = 3:1 (vol%) and deposited on the ETL by a spin coating method. Afterward, the perovskite layer was heat-treated at 95 °C for 50 min. Hole transport material solutions (p-CuPc, p-ZnPc, and spiro-OMeTAD) were deposited by the spin coating method obtaining similar thicknesses of ∼60 nm on active (perovskite) layers. Finally, silver (Ag) electrodes as the cathode were thermally evaporated under high vacuum conditions (<10−5 mbar) on the HTM. We also fabricated a PSC using spiro-OMeTAD and a HTM as references. Characterization of the fabricated devices was performed by current density (J) versus applied voltage measurements using a Keithley 2400 source meter for (V) and a solar simulator (ENLITECH, which was calibrated with NREL). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded in air with monochromatic incident light in the range of 300–800 nm wavelength.


The three-step synthesis of the phthalocyanine precursor PN is depicted in Scheme 1. First, 1-bromo-4-(tert-butyl)benzene (1) was subjected to a 2-fold Buchwald–Hartwig reaction with 4-methoxyaniline (2) to afford the desired compound 3. The subsequent treatment of compound 3 with boron tribromide in chloroform provided the demethylation product 4. Finally, 4-(4-(bis(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)amino)phenoxy)phthalonitrile (PN) was prepared by reacting 4-nitrophthalonitrile with 4-(bis(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)amino)phenol (4). All spectral data support the chemical structure of 3, 4, and PN (Fig. S1–S12).

Pc derivatives (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc) were obtained by reacting the phthalonitrile derivative (PN) with the corresponding dry metal salts (zinc(II)acetate and copper(II)chloride) using a catalytic amount of DBU in the presence of 1-pentanol under an Ar(g) atmosphere (Scheme 1). The isolated solid green products were soluble in most common organic solvents such as CHCl3, CH2Cl2, DMSO, DMF, acetonitrile, toluene, and THF.
Identification of the Pc compounds was performed through FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy along with mass spectrometry. All spectral data were consistent with the expected chemical formulas for the newly synthesized compounds. The FT-IR spectra showed the characteristic infrared stretching vibrations for the aliphatic C–H and aromatic C–H stretching around 3040 and 2950 cm−1, respectively. At the same time, the presence of CN stretching vibrations observed at 2230 cm−1 for PN compound supports the occurrence of this synthesis, while its disappearance after phthalocyanine synthesis supports the synthesis of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc structures (Fig. S9, S13, and S17). The mass spectra of PN, p-ZnPc, p-CuPc were obtained by the MALDI-TOF technique using DIT (dithranol) matrix media and the proposed structure was confirmed (Fig. S10, S14, and S18). The molecular ion peaks were observed at m/z: 499.659 [M]+ for PN, 2064.959 [M] + for p-ZnPc and m/z: 2066.50 [M]+ for p-CuPc (Fig. S3, S10, S14 and S18, respectively). The 1H and 13C NMR studies were carried out to characterize compounds in CDCl3 and THF-d8. The 1H NMR spectra of 3, 4, PN, and p-ZnPc are shown in Fig. S3, S7, S11, and S15, respectively. The integrations and chemical shifts of aliphatic and aromatic protons were obtained conveniently. The chemical shift of tert-butyl groups was at around 1.36 ppm, that of aromatic C–H was between 7.34 and 6.71 ppm, and that of aromatic C–H was located close to nitrile groups between 7.41 and 8.11 ppm. The chemical shift of aromatic C–H of the phthalocyanine ring shifted downfield as expected between 9.12 and 7.75 ppm. In the p-ZnPc spectra, the peak shift of tert-butyl groups is a doublet instead of a singlet, and the peaks in the phthalocyanine ring split and differentiate more than expected, which is due to the structure being a mixture of isomers. Similarly, some peaks were slotted instead of singlets obtained in the 13C NMR spectra. The peak shifts of carbon atoms with different chemical environments were in harmony with the proposed structures (Fig. S4, S8, S12 and S16).

Electrochemical measurements were performed on a Pt disk working electrode against a non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ reference electrode in DCM medium at a concentration of 0.5 mM, including 0.1 M NBu4PF6 as the supporting electrolyte in a N2 atmosphere. All potential values were reported versus the SCE reference electrode to be compatible with the literature. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at different scan rates at 50–500 mV. Square wave voltammograms were studied with a pulse size of 100 mV and a frequency of 25 Hz. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of p-CuPc and p-ZnPc were calculated using the HOMO level of the (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The CV and SWV voltammograms of p-CuPc and p-ZnPc are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S19, respectively. The half-wave potential values of O2, O1, R1, and R2, the differences between the first oxidation and reduction potentials (ΔE1/2), HOMO–LUMO energy levels, and calculated electrochemical band gap (ECVg) are presented in Table 1.

p-CuPc and p-ZnPc give similar responses that cause slight potential differences. As shown in Fig. 2, p-CuPc gives two reduction couples and one oxidation couple R2 at −1.38 V, R1 at −1.01 V, O1 at 0.65 V, and O2 at 0.91 V, respectively. p-ZnPc gives similar values of reduction and oxidation couples R2 at −1.38 V, R1 at −1.01 V, O1 at 0.65 V, and O2 at 0.83 V (Fig. S19). Oxidation and reduction processes in non-polar, non-coordinating DCM media occurred at the phthalocyanine ring since Cu and Zn metals are electro-inactive centers. Such behaviour is typical of phthalocyanines, where only the ring is involved in the redox exchanges. ΔE1/2 values of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc (1.56 V and 1.66 V) give the band gap in inactive metal-centered MPc's, which describes the energy required for an electron to move from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). E1/2 and ΔE1/2 values determined as peak-to-peak separations are consistent with the studies reported in the literature.
The solid state optical bandgaps (Esldg) of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc have been investigated with diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and the calculation details are given in the ESI. The calculated Tauc plot values were plotted as a graph, and the first linear part of the plot was extrapolated to the x-axis. The first jump at about 1.73 eV and 1.71 eV for p-ZnPc and p-CuPc, respectively (Fig. 3b), corresponds to the S0–S1 transition band of the Pc core at 550–700 nm Fig. (3a).
When the optical band gaps (Esldg) estimated from DRS data for solid Pc, and electrochemical band gap values were compared, there seem to be some differences between them. It was shown that the electroactive and photoactive centers of both Pc derivatives (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc) were different from each other. This charging process can be advantageous for photovoltaic applications.

The extensive evaluation of the photophysical and optical properties of the Pcs derivatives was investigated by UV-Vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and 3D-fluorescence spectroscopy. Absorbance and fluorescence spectra were recorded with different solvents such as THF, DMF, CH2Cl2, and toluene, and the solvent and concentration effects on the absorption behaviour of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc were evaluated (Fig. 4a and d, Fig. S20 and 23). The obtained data are depicted in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2. Absorption spectra of compounds (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc) (Fig. 4a and d) are typical of metallated phthalocyanines. Both compounds showed an intense Q-band around 677 nm and a typically broad Soret band with a maximum of around 380 nm. Absorption spectra of p-ZnPc behaved similarly in different solvents such as CHCl3, DMF, THF, and toluene. A decreased intensity of the Q-bands of p-CuPc derivative (Fig. 4d) was observed in THF and toluene, respectively, indicating an increasing level of aggregation of samples (Fig. 4d).

The tetra-substituted p-ZnPc and p-CuPc have bulky aryloxy groups such as 4-(bis(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)amino)phenol and these bulky groups protrude upwards or downwards from the Pc plane because of structural constraints. Thereby the bulky groups prevent cofacial stacking. Thus the p-ZnPc and p-CuPc have monomeric species in THF for the studied concentration ranges.
Upon excitation, p-ZnPc showed fluorescence emission around 686 nm, varying in intensity. The fluorescence emission spectrum mirrored the absorption spectrum with a small Stokes shift of 194 cm−1 in THF, which demonstrated insignificant structural changes of the molecule in its excited states (Table 2). The fluorescence excitation spectrum resembled the corresponding absorption spectrum, which confirmed that the observed emission originated from a particular compound and that the p-ZnPc is in monomeric form. As expected, almost no fluorescence was observed for the p-CuPc compound due to the paramagnetic Cu(II) metal ion (Fig. 4e). The fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) of p-ZnPc was determined to be 0.22 by the absolute method using an integrating sphere.
The 3-dimensional-excitation emission matrix (3D-EEM) is a measurement technique becoming more widely used in the field of fluorescence spectroscopy which is a 3D scan, resulting in a contour plot of excitation wavelength vs. emission wavelength vs. fluorescence intensity. As known, fluorometers provide important absorbance and colour information for all non-fluorescent molecules which can be a crucial part of an extensive multi-component molecular recognition, since they by definition, measure fluorescence. The 3-D fluorescence spectra of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc in THF are shown in Fig. S22 and 24. Three typical fluorescence peaks of p-ZnPc could be easily found in its three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum, and were in accordance with those observed in the three-dimensional fluorescence contour map (Fig. 4c). Also, the 3D fluorescence contour map of p-ZnPc shows three different fluorescence signals as well as a very strong emission (Em) 350–500 nm with excitation (Ex) 300–400 nm, a strong Em 600–720 nm with Ex 300–400 and medium Em 600–720 nm with Ex 600–700 which could be attributed to triphenylamine-like and Pc-like fluorescence for two peaks, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4e. Although p-CuPc is a non-fluorescent molecule, the 3-D fluorescence spectrum of p-CuPc showed just one fluorescence peak as a strong Em 350–500 nm with Ex 300–400 nm related to triphenylamine substituted groups (Fig. 4f, and Fig. S24). Two typical fluorescence peaks could be easily found in the 3D-EEM spectrum of unsubstituted ZnPc, and were in accordance with those observed in the 3D fluorescence contour map (Fig. S25a). But there is no fluorescence in the 3D-EMM contour map of unsubstituted CuPc. This indicates that the strong emission bands of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc at 350–500 nm are brought about by triphenyl amine substituted groups on the Pc macrocycle.
The photophysical properties of the Pcs are strongly influenced by the presence and nature of the central metal ion. Complexation of Pc derivatives with transition metals gives metallated Pc compounds with short triplet lifetimes (in the ns range). Generally, closed-shell or diamagnetic metal ions are selected as central metals, because their Pc complexes create both high triplet yields and long fluorescence lifetimes (τt). The measurement of the fluorescence lifetime of p-ZnPc is shown in Fig. S21.p-ZnPc exhibits a bi-exponential behavior. The short-lived component features a τf of fewer than 0.27 ns (detection limit) and is responsible for 54% of photons emitted; the long one has a τf of 2.93 ns and assumes 46% of emission.

For HTMs, hole mobility and charge transport mechanism are two figures of merits for their suitability in PSCs. It has been proven that space charge limited current measurement is a powerful technique for determining the hole mobilities in an HTM but is accompanied by significant errors, resulting in neglecting of the diffusion current. Hole mobilities of the HTMs were determined by applying an improved space charge limited current measurements, in which a diffusion-related voltage term was included to neglect diffusion-related currents. In this case, the J–V relation can be expressed as,

J is the current density, V is the applied voltage, ε is the permittivity, d is the thickness of an organic layer, and Vγ is diffusion-related voltage. By fitting the experimentally obtained J–V curves to equation eqn (1), the extracted charge carrier mobilities were obtained as 2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 3.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for p-ZnPc, p-CuPc, and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Our finding indicates that the hole mobility for p-ZnPc is slightly lower than that spiro-OMeTAD, but it has the same order magnitude.

To optimize the architecture and the process, the effect of the blend ratio of MAI and PbI2 on the measured current density (J) and voltage (V) characteristics of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/Pc/Ag structures has been investigated. For comparison, PSC devices without HTM and with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM were also fabricated and characterized under the same conditions. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the measured J–V characteristics of these devices.
The detailed photovoltaic performance parameters such as short circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and power conversion efficiencies are summarized in Table 3 as a function of the MAI:PbI2 blend ratio.

At first, it should be noticed here that nearly the same type of MAI:PbI2 blend ratio dependence was observed with p-CuPc as the HTM, except the magnitude of the photovoltaic performance parameters (Table 3). Close investigation of Table 3 indicates that all photovoltaic parameters of the devices investigated (FTO/SnO2/perovskite/p-ZnPc/Ag, FTO/SnO2/perovskite/p-CuPc/Ag, FTO/SnO2/perovskite/Ag, and FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag) increase with the MAI:PbI2 blend ratio at the beginning and then began to decrease when the MAI:PbI2 blend ratio is greater than 1.0:1.4. As a result of this investigation, it was decided that the optimal blend ratio is 1.0:1.4. Therefore, in the second stage of this study, we focused on FTO/SnO2/perovskite/p-ZnPc/Ag and FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structures.
One of the most interesting results extracted from Table 3, and focused on this work, is the larger VOC and JSC in devices with the HTM (spiro-OMeTAD or p-ZnPc as HTM) when compared to devices without the HTM. The average VOC and JSC of the p-ZnPc differ from these HTM free devices by 0.31 mV and 4.98 mA cm−2, respectively.
In summary, incorporating any HTM (spiro-OMeTAD or Pc) contributes to improved device performance. It is also clear that the photovoltaic conversion efficiency obtained with the p-ZnPc as the HTM is lower than that of the reference device based on spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, which exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.91/%. In agreement with previous work, considering that the replacement or incorporation of the HTM in perovskite-based solar cells has a significant effect on the photophysical properties of the devices and thus also on the photovoltaic behavior. Different open-circuit voltages observed in PSCs fabricated by using different HTM can be mainly attributed to the relative HOMO level, recombination rate as well as density of states disorder. As is known from previous studies in the literature, photo-induced quasi-Fermi level splitting in the active layer (perovskite layer in our case), which is the origin of the VOC, approaches the difference in HTM HOMO and ETM LUMO energy levels. This relation can be rationalized by considering that the open-circuit voltage is the applied voltage where the amount of photogeneration is equal to the amount of the recombination rates. Shockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination, which is deeper in energy, is proportional to charge carrier concentrations in the interfaces of the active layer. After the filling of contacts’ depletion layer, electron or hole concentrations increase, which takes place when the Fermi level splitting in the active layer and approaches the difference in HTM HOMO and ETM LUMO energy levels, which leads to a bigger built-in voltage, allowing the solar cell to reach a higher open-circuit voltage. It should also be noted that there is research work claiming that the photovoltage in perovskite-based solar cells depends on the morphology of the perovskite layer and the selected contact electrode rather than the HOMO level of the HTM. On the other hand, the higher short-circuit current density in devices using the HTM can be attributed to the charge extraction and transport efficiency in HTM-PSCs. By considering that the short-circuit current density in a perovskite-based solar cell is the maximum current extracted under zero applied voltage, it can be concluded that the short-circuit current density depends mainly on the generation rate, electron, and hole diffusion lengths. These findings are consistent with the literature. To further investigate the device performance and carrier dynamics transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were performed on CsPbI2Br PSCs in which a tin phthalocyanine (SnPc) film was used as the HTM by Gao and Wu et al. It was proven by these workers that, under short circuit conditions, the SnPc based PSCs exhibit faster photo-current decay time than that of reference devices without the SnPc HTM. This observation predicts that the charge extraction and transport in the SnPc based PSC are more efficient when compared with devices without SnPc, which is an indication that the short-circuit current density can be improved by using a Pc film as the HTM. Another important conclusion drawn from the examination of the data in Table 3 is that the photovoltaic performances of these devices, such as open-circuit voltage, short circuit current, and power conversion efficiency, differ depending on the blend ratio of MAI and PBI2, and the maximum performance was obtained for the blend ratio of MAI and PbI2 1.0:1.4. The results obtained show that the conversion of MAI to MAI3 increases with the increase of the PbI2 ratio reaching a maximum at the 1.0:1.4 blend ratio. It can also be concluded that the coverage of the ETM by the active layer is completed avoiding possible contacts between the ETM and HTM that could create nondesired charge transfer pathways. As can be clearly seen from the examination of Table 3, the photovoltaic efficiency of both p-CuPc and p-ZnPc based devices is low. Cho et al. synthesized zinc phthalocyanine compounds bearing amines as the HTM in perovskite solar cells. It was reported that compounds bearing electron-donating groups have high HOMO–LUMO levels. Therefore, the observed low PCE was attributed to the shunt path between the perovskite layer and the silver electrode.
The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for complete devices with and without HTMs were recorded to understand the role of the HTM more clearly. Fig. 6 shows the IPCE spectra and the corresponding integrated JSC of the p-CuPc, p-ZnPc, and spiro-OMeTAD based PSC devices.
It is clear from Fig. 6 that the value of the measured IPCE decreases up to ∼750 nm after reaching a maximum value at ∼550, which is in accordance with the absorption feature of the MAPbI3 perovskite active layer. The integrated short-circuit current densities from the IPCE spectra for p-CuPc, p-ZnPc, and spiro-OMeTAD based devices were 9.66 mA cm−2, 11.35 mA cm−2, and 16.16 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in line with the JSC values obtained from the J–V characteristics (see Table 1).
Another electrical method extensively used for the characterization of photovoltaic devices is impedance spectroscopy. The impedance spectra of the complete devices were also studied to get more insight into the recombination mechanisms occurring in the fabricated devices. The Nyquist plot of the best performing perovskite devices with the p-ZnPc, p-CuPc, and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs is presented in Fig. 7.
All the devices were tested under dark with a 0 V applied bias. In general, the main arc in the low-frequency region is related to the charge recombination resistance (Rrr) at the interface. It is obvious that the perovskite solar cell using the p-ZnPc HTM exhibits a much larger recombination resistance than the reference cell using the spiro-OMeTAD and p-CuPc. The observed relatively high Rrr value suggests that the cell using the p-ZnPc should have a much lower carrier recombination rate at the interface between p-ZnPc and perovskite than the cell using the spiro-OMeTAD and p-CuPc HTMs. It also indicates a more effective hole transport/collection for the p-ZnPc based device. This result can explain the higher FF obtained from the J–V measurement for the device using p-ZnPc as a HTM.
To investigate the stability of the devices, we fabricated PSCs using different HTMs for the stability test and further investigated. The stability test was performed in an atmosphere with humidity about 35%–45% and temperature of 22–27 °C. The variation of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency as a function of time is shown in Fig. 8 (for 10:1.4 blend ratio based devices). Fig. 8 clearly shows that the PSC using the p-ZnPc exhibits excellent long term stability, maintaining about 93% of its initial PCE after 960 h.
The decreased performance can be mainly attributed to the degradation of the perovskite film due to no encapsulation, leading to a lower Jsc. However, for the PSC using the spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, the PCE decreased from 6.91% to 4.18% afer 960 h. It was reported that spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a low hole mobility and it should be doped with TBP and LiTFSI dissolved in acetonitrile to improve its conductivity. LiFTSI is very easily deliquescent in air and TBP and acetonitrile can corrode lead halide perovskites. On the other hand, Pcs is a very stable material and exhibits relatively high hole mobility even without any additives. Therefore, the p-ZnPc can significantly improve the stability of the perovskite solar cells.

Peripheral tetra-4-(bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino)phenoxy-substituted zinc and copper phthalocyanines (p-ZnPc and p-CuPc) have been synthesized as a new type of stable high-efficiency hole transfer material in perovskite based solar cells. A blend of methyl ammonium iodide and lead iodide in different proportions was used as the perovskite layer. In order to investigate the effect of the MAI:PbI2 blend ratio on the device performance, a series of photovoltaic devices with the architecture of FTO/SnO2/MAI:PbI2/p-CuPc, p-ZnPc/Ag fabricated and characterized. The results indicated that the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of these devices exhibited a strong MAI:PbI2 blend-ratio dependence. The maximum power conversion efficiency was obtained using p-ZnPc based devices, as 5.81%, with a blend ratio of 1.0:1.4 under standard AM 1.5 illumination. The role of p-ZnPc and p-CuPc as HTMs in the long term stability of the PSCs by using the perovskite-based solar cells was also investigated. It was demonstrated that the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was improved by applying Pcs, as compared with the cell device in the absence of the HTM. The best-performing device with p-ZnPc as the HTM exhibits a PCE of 5.81% with JSC of 11.42 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.85 V. It was also demonstrated that the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was improved by applying Pcs, as compared with the device in the absence of a HTM. The present work emphasizes that solution-processable p-ZnPc and p-CuPc hold great promise as a class of alternative HTMs that can be further explored for efficient and stable PSCs in the future.
