Molecular engineering of electron donors and acceptors for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells is critical to develop novel materials with improved power conversion efficiency. Here, the non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F combined with an electron donor, P2F-EHp, were taken as a representative system to theoretically study the effects of the fusion of thienyl into the backbone of NFAs. On the basis of extensive quantum chemistry calculations, it was found that fusing thienyl into the backbone elevated the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, reduced the gap between the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, decreased the dipole moment, enhanced the light absorbance and generated red-shifts in the absorption bands. The data for the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes indicate that fusing thienyl into the backbone of the electron acceptor modifies the excitation character of the donor/acceptor complexes, increases the charge transfer (CT) excitation energy and the number of local excitation and CT hybridized low-lying excited states, amplifies the CT rate, reduces the exciton dissociation rate, and dramatically suppresses the charge recombination (CR) rate, leading to better performance of BTPTT-4F. However, the poorer performance of BTPT- 4F can mainly be attributed to its larger dipole moment and faster CR rate.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are regarded as one of the most promising devices for converting solar radiation energies due to their advantages such as environmental friendliness, solution processing, low cost, light weight, flexibility, and mass and large-area production. The most important component in OSCs is the heterojunction composed of electron donor and acceptor materials, which has a decisive influence on the photoelectric performance of the device. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type OSCs have made great progress because of their merits, such as higher exciton dissociation (ED) efficiency and lower charge recombination (CR) rate. For electron acceptor materials in BHJs, fullerenes and their derivatives have been demonstrated to be effective acceptors for OSCs during the past several decades due to their special cage-like structures, which favor electron delocalization. However, the recognized limitations of fullerenes and their derivatives as electron acceptors include the scarcity of chemical structure modification, difficult energy level tunability, morphological instability, high cost, and weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions. Fortunately, non-fullerene acceptors (NFA) were invented and developed as substitutes for fullerene-based acceptors because of their more flexible synthesis and energy level adjustability as well as their low cost and better stability. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction and tandem cells based on NFAs reached 16% and 17%, respectively.

One of the main methods for pursuing higher PCE of OSCs with NFA is to modulate the material properties by molecular engineering (morphologies, energy levels, etc.). Molecular engineering refers to the modification of a chemical structure at the molecular level, including the modification of side chains, substitutions and backbones. Side chain modifications usually involve applying different moieties as substitutes, varying substitution positions and lengths, and changing the type and number of branches. Molecular modifications by substituents include introducing different atoms/moieties at different positions. The backbone modifications add π fragments, such as thiophene and/or benzene, to extend the length of the π-conjugate framework. Among these strategies, the conjugate backbone plays a critical role to determine the photoelectronic properties of the molecule, and the substitutions are mainly reflected in the effects on the molecular energy levels and electron transfer; meanwhile, side chain engineering can affect morphological characteristics such as the interface molecular orientation, aggregation and packing pattern.
Extension of the conjugation of the backbone can effectively adjust the optical and electronic properties of NFA materials in OSCs, including their energy levels, excitations, and charge carrier mobilities. To accomplish this, three typical routes are commonly adopted, including extension of the conjugate bridge, end-group and core-unit in the backbone. For the extension of the conjugate bridge, based on the acceptor IDTO-T-4F, Liu et al. synthetized another NFA IDTO-TT-4F by substituting thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in conjugate bridges between the donor and acceptor parts in IDTO-T-4F, and the PCEs of OSCs fabricated using the IDTO-T-4F/PBDB-T and IDTO-TT-4F/PBDB-T heterojunctions were 12.6% and 10.1%, respectively. To extend the end-groups of NFA, Feng et al. reported FDNCTF by introducing benzene rings into the end-groups on both sides of FDICTF; they obtained a similar open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a smaller short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) with the electron donor PBDB-T. In an interesting example of extending the core-unit in the NFA backbone, Fan et al. adopted P2F-EHp as an electron donor and synthetized NFA BTPTT-4F by fusing two thienyls functionalized with C11H23 alkyl chains into BTPT-4F; the PCEs of the fabricated devices were drastically different (1% and 16%, respectively). The molecular structures of BTPT-4F, BTPTT-4F and P2F-EHp are presented in Fig. 1. Apparently, the molecular structures of BTPTT-4F and BTPT-4F are quite similar. However, it is still not well understood why a slight change of the molecular structure results in such a remarkable difference in PCE.
In this work, to understand the different performance of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F in OSCs, based upon density functional theory (DFT) calculations adopting the long range corrected functional with optimally tuned range separation parameters combined with solid environmental effects, we extensively investigated the geometries, electronic structures and excitation properties of BTPT-4F, BTPTT-4F, P2F-EHp and their model complexes P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F as well as the electron process rates at their heterojunction interfaces.

For the NFA monomers BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F (also called Y6) and the electron donor P2F-EHp (considering the computational cost, two repeat units are usually contained in model systems of organic photovoltaic heterojunctions), the geometries of the monomers were optimized at the ωB97XD/CEP-121G* level and in the solid phase. Previous studies have shown that the ωB97XD/CEP-121G* level is suitable for the calculation of such large conjugated molecular systems. Meanwhile, the solid-phase environment was simulated using the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) method combined with the solute electron density (SMD) model. The static and dynamic dielectric constants of the monomers and donor/acceptor complexes required for the solid phase calculations were approximated as 4.0 and 3.3, respectively, which are typical values of organic photovoltaic materials.

Donor/acceptor complexes are usually applied as the heterojunction interface models of OSCs. The acceptor/donor complexes P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F constructed with one donor and one acceptor molecule contain 471 and 519 atoms, respectively, which leads to huge computational cost. Considering computational feasibility, the alkyl chains of the original monomers were replaced by methyl groups (R1–R6 labeled in Fig. 1) and then adopted to construct donor/acceptor complexes that contain 309 and 321 atoms for P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F, respectively. This simplification is reasonable because the alkyl side chains do not contribute to the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) of the BTPT-4F, BTPTT-4F or P2F-EHp monomers (see Section 3.2), suggesting that the alkyl side chains do not take part in excitation-related processes. Because the donor/acceptor heterojunction interface configurations in the actual systems are very complicated, including face-on, edge-on, end-on and many other configurations, the configuration of the donor/acceptor complexes in this work adopted the end-group π–π stacking modes. This configuration was evidenced by the molecular dynamics simulations for the similar system DRTB-T/IT-4F heterojunction interface, and it can be understood from the large steric hindrance of the central core side chain. Other molecular dynamics simulations for PBDB-T/ITIC, PBDB-T/IT-OM, IT-OM-2, and ITIC acceptor also support the end-group π–π stacking interface configuration. The geometries of the donor/acceptor complexes were optimized at the same level as those of the monomers.
For the excited state calculations, the TDDFT results of the long-range corrected hybrid functional with the optimally tuned range separation parameter ω are in good agreement with the results of experiments. The method of tuning the range separation parameter ω is described in our previous work. The optimally tuned ω values for the monomers and complexes in the solid phase were 0.002 and 0.001 Bohr−1, respectively. These results are on the same order as those obtained from other complexes we studied earlier. The quite small tuned ω results from the effects of solid-state electronic polarization and the screening of the electrostatic electron–hole interaction. The quantum chemistry calculations in this work with DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods were performed using the Gaussian 09 package. In addition, Multiwfn software was used to calculate the densities of states, charge density differences (CDD), charge transfer distances (Δd) and transferred charges (Δq) of the donor/acceptor complexes to characterize their excitation properties.
The rates of the electron transfer processes, including photo-induced charge transfer, ED and CR, at the donor/acceptor interface were calculated by Marcus's semiclassical method with the following formula:

As shown in Fig. 1, the BTPT-4F molecule contains a central backbone unit based on 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), acting as the electron donor moiety (noted as D1), and the units at both ends of the backbone unit are electron acceptor moieties (noted as A1). Unlike BTPT-4F, the BTPTT-4F molecule contains the BT-core-based fused-unit dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT, noted as D2) as an electron donor moiety. For the electron donor P2F-EHp, it contains the electron donating moiety of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT, noted as D3) and the electron withdrawing moiety of pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione (TzBI, noted as A2), exhibiting ⋯D–A–D–A⋯ character (D and A indicate donor and acceptor, respectively).


Fig. 2 shows the optimized geometries of the monomers in the solid phase. Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI give the details of the bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles of the monomers. Analysis of the bond lengths and bond angles of the acceptors BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F reveals that except for the bond angle difference of about 12° (bond angles 5–6–7 and 8–9–10, see Table S1 in the ESI) induced by fusing thienyl, the differences in the corresponding bond lengths and angles of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F are smaller than 0.01 Å and 2°, respectively. Selected dihedral angles are indicated in Fig. 2, and the corresponding values are given in Table 1. For the side chains bonded with N in the acceptor BTPTT-4F, two –C4H9 branches are located on both sides of the backbone, which has been confirmed to be the most stable configuration by theoretical calculations at the ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p) level. The longer side chains lead to an increase in steric hindrance, which can alter the packing pattern. The θ1–θ6 values of both acceptors are close to 180°, indicating that fusing thienyl into the backbone of BTPT-4F does not change the coplanarity of the backbone, which facilitates the electron delocalization. Due to the different lengths of the side chains connected by N in the backbone, the dihedral angles θ7 and θ8 are quite different between BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F. As for the donor P2F-EHp, the values of θ1 to θ7 embody the poor coplanarity of the backbone; this can be attributed to the absence of fused heterocycles or aromatic fused rings in the backbone, leading to flexible structures.

The energy level alignments are presented in Fig. 3. The highest occupied MO (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO) energies are labeled in the figure. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of P2F-EHP, BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F are 2.97, 2.42, and 2.32 eV, respectively. The data indicate that fusing thienyl into the backbone elevates the HOMO and reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap by about 0.10 eV, which agrees well with experimental results (0.11 eV) measured by cyclic voltammetry. Meanwhile, compared with that of BTPT-4F, the HOMO energy increases in BTPTT-4F, which is consistent with the conclusion obtained by extending the conjugate length in experiments; this may lead to a decrease of its ionization potential.
Molecular electric dipole and quadrupole moments determine the intermolecular interactions in organic materials and thus affect the molecular aggregation and regioregularity of their morphologies. The calculated electric dipole and quadrupole moments of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F are listed in Table S3 in the ESI. The data suggest that BTPT-4F has a larger dipole moment and smaller quadrupole moment than BTPTT-4F. The larger dipole moment of BTPT-4F (12.25 Debye) causes stronger intermolecular interactions; this results in large aggregates or grains, as was confirmed by experiments. Furthermore, the morphology with large aggregates/grains of BTPT-4F reduces the D/A interface, leading to ineffective D/A contact and charge separation at the heterojunction interfaces.
The data of the excitation properties are listed in Table 2, including the excitation energies, excitation wavelengths, excited state characters (ESC), oscillator strengths and main transition configurations. The calculated excitation energies for the first singlet excited states (S1) of BTPT-4F, BTPTT-4F and P2F-EHp are 1.90, 1.83 and 2.39 eV, respectively. A comparison of the S1 excitation energies indicates that the conjugation extension achieved by fusing thienyl into the backbone generates a 0.07 eV reduction of the S1 excitation energy, which is very close to the experimental effects on the optical band gap (0.11 eV). In addition, the small difference of the theoretical λmax (2.39 eV) from that of the experiment (550 nm, 2.25 eV) supports the reasonability of the dimer repeating unit of P2F-EHp as a representative of the original polymer P2F-EHp.

The MOs of the monomers associated with the main transition configurations are presented in Fig. 4. Table S4 and Fig. S3 in the ESI list more details of the excited states and MOs. It can be found from Fig. 4 that BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F share similar MO distributions. H, H−2 and L of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F are delocalized throughout the whole backbone, and the central unit (D1 and D2 of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F, respectively) dominates H−3, H−1 and L+4, whereas L+1, L+2 and L+3 are mainly contributed by the A1 moieties at both ends of the BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F molecules (here, H and L represent the HOMO and LUMO, respectively). Meanwhile, it should be noted that in addition to local excitations (LE), there are two types of intramolecular CT excitations (D1/D2 → A1 and A1 → D1/D2). For example, the excited states S2–S6, S8 and S10 of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F are intramolecular CT involving D1/D2 → A1, while the S9 state is another type of intramolecular CT involving A1 → D1/D2. Overall, most of the excitations of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F in visible region exhibit intramolecular CT character. As for the donor P2F-EHp, the main transition configuration of S1 is H → L. As shown in Fig. 4, the HOMO and LUMO distributions of P2F-EHp show different extents of relocation (supporting CT) and orbital overlap (indicating LE); therefore, the S1 excitation of P2F-EHp is a hybrid state of LE and CT. The S2–S10 states of P2F-EHp are similar to the CT excitation involving D3 → A2. S5 and S6 as well as S7 and S8 of P2F-EHp are quasi-degenerate states. Intramolecular CT excitation facilitates the reduction of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, facilitating the dissociation of excitons.
Fig. S3 (ESI) shows the simulated absorption spectra of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F. It can be found that BTPTT-4F has stronger light absorption capability than BTPT-4F in the range of 370–570 nm. Therefore, fusing thienyl into the backbone can enhance the light absorbance and generate red-shift of the absorption bands due to the excitation energy reduction of the S1 state.

The optimized structures of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes are given in Fig. 5 (including the top view and side view). Selected bond lengths and bond angles of the complexes are given in Table S2 and Fig. S2 in the ESI. The major dihedral angles are labeled in the figure, and the corresponding values are given in Table 3. In most cases, the corresponding geometric parameters of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes are quite similar. The differences in the corresponding bond lengths and angles are in the range of 0.01 Å and 2°, respectively. The distance between the donor and the acceptor in the complexes can be described by two parameters. One is the distance between the geometric centers of the donor and acceptor; these values are 19.647 (P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F) and 20.988 Å (P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F). The other is the stacking distance between the oxygen atom in the A1 moieties of the acceptor and the sulfur atom in the D3 moiety of the donor (the corresponding moieties are labeled in Fig. 1), which are 3.650 and 3.594 Å for the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes, respectively, consistent with the calculated binding energies (1.370 and 1.378 eV, respectively). The dihedral angles θ8–θ13 (see Table 3) support that the quasi-planar backbones of the acceptors are well maintained in the donor/acceptor complexes. Compared with P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F, the remarkable increase of the dihedral angle θ4 in the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex is favorable for enhancing charge delocalization and improving the charge transport properties.

The HOMOs and LUMOs of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes are also presented in Fig. 3. It can be found that the HOMOs and LUMOs of the complexes are in good agreement with the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, respectively. This suggests that the weak non-bonding intermolecular interactions between the donor and acceptor do not significantly impact the electronic structures and that the simplification of the alkyl chains in the original donor and acceptor with –CH3 groups in the complexes is reasonable. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes (2.07 and 2.15 eV, respectively) indicate that the effects of fusing thienyl into the backbones of the complexes are different from those of the monomers. This may be caused by different electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor in these complexes. Furthermore, compared with the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complex, fusing thienyl into the backbone increases the density of states of the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex, which is presented in Fig. S5 in the ESI.
Five low-lying singlet excited states of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes, including the excitation energies, wavelengths, oscillator strengths, excited state characters and main transition configurations, are listed in Table 4, and the involved MOs are shown in Fig. 6. Based upon the analysis of the transition configurations and MOs, it should be noted that for both complexes, the LEs with lower excitation energies occur in the NFA acceptor, indicating that the light absorption in the visible region with longer wavelengths is dominated by the NFA. This is quite different from heterojunctions based on fullerene-based acceptors, where the light absorption is mainly contributed by the electron donor via LE, corresponding to Frenkel exciton formation. Meanwhile, it can be found that for the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complex, S2 is LE in the acceptor, and the others are CT excited states. In contrast, for the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex, in addition to the CT state S3, the other excited states are the hybridized CT and LE in the acceptor. Hence, fusing thienyl into the backbone of the electron acceptor modifies the excitation character of the donor/acceptor complexes and increases the LE/CT hybridized low-lying excited states. The hybrid states usually possess larger oscillator strengths relative to the CT state, corresponding to higher transition probability and light harvesting efficiency; this is favorable for improving JSC. Furthermore, in terms of Blancafort's method for calculating electronic coupling, the larger oscillator strength of the hybridized state enhances the electronic coupling among excited states. Also, the hybridization of LE and CT has been shown to be beneficial in promoting charge generation and reducing non-radiative voltage losses.

To further clarify the excited state character, the CDDs for selected states of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes are given in Fig. 7, and the CT distances Δd and the transferred charges Δq are listed in Table 5. The tiny Δq of the S0 → S2 transition for the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complex supports its LE character, which is in line with the results of the transition configuration and related MOs. The Δq values of the other transitions for P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complexes are close to one electron, demonstrating their CT character. The Δq of the S0 → S3 transition for P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes is also close to one electron, supporting CT excitation, whereas the Δq of the other low-lying excited states for the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex range from 0.30 to 0.68 e, underling the hybridization of LE and CT. Furthermore, the Δd values of the S0 → S3 transition for both complexes are close to the geometric center distances between the donor and acceptor, highlighting the long range CT from the donor to the acceptor at the organic heterojunction interface.

The lowest CT excitation energies of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F are 1.69 and 1.77 eV, respectively. According to the empirical formula qVOC = E(1CT1) − (0.6 ± 0.1 eV) between the open-circuit voltage and the lowest singlet CT excitation energy, the higher CT energy of the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F heterojunction is favorable for a larger VOC, which has been proved by experiment. In addition, the exciton binding energy (Eb) was calculated using the fundamental gap minus the optical gap, where the fundamental gap is the difference between the ionization energy and the electron affinity of the donor/acceptor complex. The fundamental gap is often approximated as the HOMO–LUMO gap. Because the first excited state includes several transition configurations, the HOMO–LUMO gap is no longer suitable for approximating the fundamental gap. We replaced the HOMO–LUMO gap by the weighted average orbital gap to approximate the fundamental gap, and the weight is the percentage of the corresponding orbital pairs in the transition configurations. For example, the transition configurations of the first excited state of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F include H−1 → L (2.2107 eV, 43.41%), H−1 → L+1 (2.5630 eV, 6.8%), H → L (2.0662 eV, 43.97%) and H → L+1 (2.4185 eV, 4.57%), where the corresponding orbital gaps and percentages are shown in parentheses; hence, the calculated weighted average orbital gap is 2.1397 eV. Similarly, the weighted average orbital gap is 2.2279 eV for the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex. Therefore, the calculated Eb values of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes are 0.4528 and 0.4582 eV, respectively.

It should be noted that unlike the OSC heterojunctions based on fullerene derivatives as acceptors, because the low-lying excitation of the D/A complexes based on NFAs include the LE of the NFA, the ED process should be DA* → D+A−. Therefore, based on formulas studied earlier, the calculation methods of the reorganization energy (considering the relaxation of the acceptor excitation), free energy change (considering the adiabatic excitation energy of the acceptor), and electronic coupling (the orbital couplings are the HOMO orbitals of both D and A) in the ED process were modified in this case. The computational method of electronic coupling for the CT and CR processes use the generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) model.


Table 6 lists the internal and external reorganization energies (λin and λext), free energy changes (ΔG), electronic couplings (V), and rate constants (k) of the CT, ED and CR processes. In the CT, ED and CR processes, the reorganization energies of the complex P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F were 0.66, 0.55, and 0.61 eV, respectively, which are 0.08, 0.10 and 0.07 eV larger than those of the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex. Because the λext value obtained by calculation is almost the same, the main difference between the reorganization energies of the two complexes is reflected in λin. Table S6 in the ESI shows the energy of each relaxation process for calculating the reorganization energy according to the potential energy surface method. The P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex has a smaller λin, which is derived from the smaller relaxation energy of its acceptor BTPTT-4F due to its more rigid structure induced by fusing thienyl into the backbone.

In terms of the computational method for the free energy changes, it is necessary to know the Coulomb interaction energy between the initial and final states of the electron transfer process. In this work, the Coulomb interaction energy was approximated as the exciton binding energy. The data required to calculate the free energy changes are given in Tables S5 and S6 in the ESI. Accordingly, combined with λin, the calculated free energies of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F in the CT process are −1.0328 and −0.9609 eV, respectively. In the ED process, ΔG of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complex is −0.3506 eV, and the corresponding value is −0.0528 eV for the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex. The free energy changes of the CR processes are −1.7350 and −2.0381 eV for the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes, respectively. According to the computational method, the difference in the free energy changes for the ED and CR processes can be mainly attributed to the smaller electron affinity of BTPTT-4F.
Tables S7 and S8 in the ESI list the parameters required to calculate the electronic couplings of the two complexes. In the CT and CR processes, the electronic coupling of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complex was 259 meV, which is less than that of P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F (783 meV). Unlike the CT and CR processes, the electronic coupling of the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F complex during the ED process was 22 meV, which is larger than that of the P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complex (17 meV). According to the GMH model of calculating electronic couplings for the CT and CR processes, the larger electronic coupling of P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F results from its large transition dipole moment μtr and first excitation energy as well as the smaller dipole moment difference Δμ between the ground state and the first excited state.
The CT, ED and CR rates of the two complexes are given in Table 6. The CT rates of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F are 1.76 × 1014 and 1.20 × 1015 s−1, respectively, the ED rates are 5.15 × 1012 and 2.35 × 1011 s−1, respectively, and the CR rates are 3.53 × 106 and 1.06 × 10−1 s−1, respectively. Comparing the electron transfer rates of the two complexes, it can be found that the ED rate of P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F is slower than that of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and the rate of the CT process is faster than that of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F; this is mainly caused by its larger CT coupling and smaller ED coupling. It can be drawn from eqn (1) that the rate is mainly determined by two factors, V and |ΔG + λ|; this explains why in the CR process, although the electronic coupling of 0.7834 eV of P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F is larger than that of P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F (0.2592 eV), its CT rate is significantly slower. Hence, by adding thiophene to the core-unit of the acceptor, the rates of the ED and CR processes of the complex can be reduced and the CT rate can be increased.
The short-circuit current density JSC of OSCs can be determined using the following formula:
(2)
where
q and η (λ) are the charge and light absorption efficiency, respectively, while ηED, ηCS and ηCC are the exciton diffusion and dissociation efficiency, charge separation efficiency and charge collection efficiency, respectively. Finally, S(λ) is the number of photons given by the solar spectrum over all frequencies. The complex P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F has a higher light absorption efficiency and smaller charge recombination efficiency, which will lead to high charge separation efficiency, resulting in larger short-circuit current density; this is consistent with experiments.


In summary, we extensively investigated the geometries, electronic structures and excitation properties of BTPT-4F, BTPTT-4F, P2F-EHp and their model complexes P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F as well as the electron process rates at the heterojunction interfaces.

The comparison of BTPT-4F and BTPTT-4F supports that fusing thienyl into the backbone elevates the HOMO, reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap, lessens the dipole moment, enhances the light absorbance and generates red-shifts of the absorption bands. The data for the P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F and P2F-EHp/BTPTT-4F complexes indicate that fusing thienyl into the backbone of the electron acceptor modifies the excitation character of the D/A complexes, increases the CT energy and the number of LE/CT hybridized low-lying excited states, amplifies the CT rate, reduces the ED rate, and dramatically suppresses the CR rate (∼7 orders), leading to the better performance of BTPTT-4F. However, the main reasons for the poorer performance of BTPT-4F can be attributed to its larger dipole moment and faster CR rate.
Our work clarifies the reasons for the quite different PCEs of these two complexes. It may provide some theoretical perspectives for designing novel electron acceptor materials for OSCs.
