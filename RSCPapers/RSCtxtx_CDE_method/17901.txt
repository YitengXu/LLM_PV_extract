In this paper we present the synthesis and characterization of two novel copolymers obtained from a bithiophene unit carrying octylsulfanyl side chains and thienothiophene units substituted with keto (PK) or ester (PE) groups. Their structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties were investigated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), NMR, UV-visible-NIR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). They possess good solubility in common organic solvents, filmability, proneness to form π-stacks, moderate solvatochromism, good thermal stability and low band gap energy. They were tested as donor materials in combination with [70]PCBM (electron acceptor) in bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells. The geometry of the devices is: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:[70]PCBM/Ca/Al. The external quantum efficiency curve of the best device, realized using a blend of PK:[70]PCBM, 1:2 weight ratio, shows a broad response from 350 to 1000 nm. The power conversion efficiency under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination is greater than 1%.

More cost-efficient organic materials for photovoltaics are strategically important and objects of active research worldwide, as an alternative to inorganic ones. Semiconducting conjugated polymers are a class of organic materials with several advantages like flexibility in handling and preparation. Their molecular properties can be tuned using both different sequences of base units (phenylenevinylene, thiophene, benzodithiophene, thienothiophene, etc.), to build the backbone of polymers, and a variety of substituents. This approach permits fine adjustment of their characteristics such as solubility, electronic absorption maximum and absorption width, and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies.

An important polymer material for organic solar cells is the regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 7% have been demonstrated using this polymer as an electron donor material coupled with functionalized fullerenes as electron acceptors. The polymer–fullerene blend is typically sandwiched between two electrodes having different work functions. Actually, in the most promising structure, the blend material is obtained by mixing donor and acceptor species with nanoscale phase separation: this structure is called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) and offers a high density of heterojunction interfaces in the device.
The performance of a photovoltaic cell is characterized by the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF). Higher values of these three parameters yield larger PCE. In a polymer–fullerene solar cell, the Jsc is a function of the energy gap of the photoactive donor polymer. To enhance the efficiency of light conversion to electricity, one of the fundamental goals in designing organic photovoltaic materials is the harvest of photons of high wavelength to gain an important portion of the solar spectrum. Therefore, polymers with low band gaps (compared to P3HT), which can efficiently harvest the energy of the solar spectrum, are attractive to improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaics. Such materials are also interesting for tandem solar cells where two or more single cells absorbing in a complementary wavelength range are stacked together.
Since the band gap of a polymer is related to the difference between the energy positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels, when the band gap is lowered, a shift in one of these levels or both is also present. The increase in the HOMO level can produce also a decrease in the Voc of the device because the maximum Voc of BHJ solar cells, with ohmic contacts, is related to the difference between the HOMO of the electron donor and the LUMO of the electron acceptor. This implies that the use of a low band gap polymer does not guarantee to achieve a better PCE in the corresponding device, and several low band gap polymer photovoltaic systems show efficiencies much lower than their wide band gap counterparts.
Some interesting thienothiophene-co-thiophene polymers, able to absorb at high wavelength and characterized by wide absorptions, have been reported by Liang et al. This work prompted us to explore the effects of the molecular properties of alternating thienothienyl and bithienyl units in the polymeric backbone. Here we report on the synthesis and characterization of two novel copolymers based on thienothiophene and bithiophene units, namely poly[1-(thieno[3,4-b]thien-2-yl)nonan-1-one-alt-4,4′-bis(octylsulfanyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] (PK) and poly[octyl thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-alt-4,4′-bis(octylsulfanyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] (PE). 2-Acyl and 2-alkoxycarbonyl substitutions were employed for thienothiophene and 4,4′-bis(octylsulfanyl) substitution for bithiophene to improve the electron-acceptor and electron-donor characters of the two building blocks. The structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties of PK and PE were investigated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), NMR, UV-visible-NIR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). These materials were tested as electron donors in BHJ polymer solar cells (PSCs) with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) as an electron acceptor. The PSC devices were characterized by external quantum efficiency (EQE) and current–voltage (I–V) measurements under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination.

All air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were performed under argon with dry glassware. All reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Acros and used as received unless otherwise indicated.

Then a butyllithium solution (1.6 M in hexanes, 0.76 mL) was dropwise added with prolonged stirring at the same temperature for 1 h. A solution of trimethyltin chloride (1 M in hexane) was slowly added with prolonged stirring for 5 h at −78 °C, then overnight, after switching off the cooling. A disodium hydrogenphosphate/sodium dihydrogenphosphate buffer (pH = 7) was added to quench the reaction and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was eliminated under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by chromatography on Al2O3 with petroleum ether as eluent, to give 0.32 g (83%) of a brownish-green oil.

Anal. calcd for C15H18Br2O2S2: C, 48.13; H, 4.85; found: C, 48.25; H, 4.92.

In an argon purged Schlenk tube, 0.50 g (0.64 mmol) of 1 and 0.29 g (0.64 mmol) of 3 in 30 mL of toluene and 3 mL of DMF were placed. The solution was degassed by argon bubbling under vacuum for 10′ then 0.1 g (0.09 mmol) of Pd(PPh3)4 were added and the bubbling prolonged for another 20′. The temperature was slowly raised to 110 °C and the mixture was stirred for 56 h. After cooling to room temperature, 100 mL of methanol were added and the polymer thus precipitated was collected by filtration in a cellulose Soxhlet thimble, washed with methanol and n-hexane and dissolved in chloroform. After evaporation of the solvent, 0.326 g (68% yield) of a brown solid were obtained.

FT-IR (KBr, νmax, cm−1): 3073, 2955, 2925, 2854, 1713, 1532, 1471, 1436, 1339, 1305, 1276, 1246, 1202, 1135, 1069, 1042, 820, 799, 747, 723.

GPC was carried out on samples dissolved in THF, after filtration through a Teflon® septum (0.20 μm pore size), with a Hewlett–Packard system equipped with a Hewlett–Packard 5 μ mixed PLgel column and a diode-array UV detector using THF as the eluent with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at rt. The GPC system was calibrated with a series of monodisperse polystyrene standards. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance400 operating at 400.13 and 100.61 MHz, respectively, using standard pulse sequences. UV-visible-NIR spectra were recorded with Perkin–Elmer Lambda Bio 20 and Lambda 19 UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometers. FTIR spectra were recorded with a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum One. TGA was recorded with a Hi-Res TGA 2950 Thermogravimetric analyzer. CV measurements were performed both with a CHI 660A Electrochemical Workstation and an AUTOLAB PGSTAT 20. A three electrodes electrochemical cell configuration was adopted. A 0.1 mol L−1n-tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, >99%, Sigma) in acetonitrile (ACN) solution was used as the base electrolyte. The working electrode was obtained by drop casting: a freshly polished Glassy Carbon (GC both from Metrohom and HTW was used; the GC surface was mechanically polished with emery paper, then with 0.05 μm alumina, Buehler, followed by a 5 minutes sonication cleaning in water) electrode was prepared by casting one drop of a 0.1 mg mL−1, in CH2Cl2, polymer solution onto the working electrode and allowing it to dry. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. A silver wire was used as a quasi-reference electrode, whose stability was checked (at the end of each measurement session) with respect to the ferrocene/ferrocenium reversible redox couple. In the following all potential values are referenced to the Ag/Ag+. A large number of screening experiments were carried out varying both the dosing of the drop casting as well as the drying time. Films obtained repeating three times a sequence of a single drop cast application followed by 15 minutes drying allowed for the best CV reproducibility. We estimate that our reduction and oxidation potentials are affected by a 30 mV absolute error, i.e. ±15 mV error. The electrochemical cell is de-areated with argon for 15 minutes before any measurement session.


The polymer solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:[70]PCBM/Ca/Al. The ITO coated Corning® Eagle 2000 glass substrates, purchased from Delta Technologies, LTD, with a sheet resistance lower than 15 Ω □−1 were first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropanol, and subsequently dried in an oven. After a selective etching of a part of the ITO to define the front electrode, films of PEDOT:PSS, purchased from HC Starck (Clevios P Al 4083) were spin coated at 5000 rpm, after passing through a 0.45 μm filter. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was 30 nm measured using a mechanical profilometer. The samples were dried for 60 min at 140 °C in air. PK or PE and [70]PCBM were then dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3 weight ratios. 1,8-Diiodooctane (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) with a 0.3% volume ratio was then added to the solutions and stirred before use. The solutions were spin coated at 600 rpm on the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. The active layer thickness (measured using a mechanical profilometer) was around 100 nm. The Ca electrode (20 nm) capped with Al (100 nm) was thermally deposited on the active layer by thermal evaporation in an ultra-high vacuum (10−7 mbar) using a shadow mask to define the active area of the device (35 mm2). All the PSCs were characterized in air and without encapsulation by means of EQE and I–V measurements performed in the dark and under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. I–V light characteristics were measured with a Keithley 236 source measure unit (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, USA). The voltage ramp rate, controlled by a PC program, was 10 mV s−1 from positive to negative potential. Simulated AM 1.5G white light illumination was provided by a class “AAA” Wacom Solar Simulator, Model WXS155S, equipped with two lamps (xenon and halogen) and its intensity was calibrated using an unfiltered mono-Si reference cell (certified by European Solar Test Installation – ESTI) for 1 sunlight intensity of 100 mW cm−2. All the photovoltaic properties were recorded in ambient air at room temperature (∼25 °C).


The synthesis of PK and PE was carried out through Stille coupling between 5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-4,4′-bis(octylsulfanyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (1) and 1-(4,6-dibromothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)nonan-1-one (2) and between 1 and octyl 4,6-dibromothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (3), respectively, in the presence of a palladium catalyst according to Scheme 1.

Both PK and PE are soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene and THF and possess a good filmability.
The stannylated comonomer 1 was obtained starting from 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(octylsulfanyl)-2,2′-bithiophene through lithium/bromine exchange and reaction with trimethyltin chloride. The dibrominated comonomers 2 and 3 were synthesized starting from 3,4-dibromothiophene as reported in Scheme 2.
4-Bromo-3-thienylcarboxaldehyde 4, obtained from 3,4-dibromothiophene through lithium/bromine exchange and reaction with DMF, was reacted with ethyl mercaptoacetate in the presence of CuO nanopowder to give ethyl ester 5, according to ref. 16, which is the common intermediate for the obtainment of both 2 and 3. Ester 5 was transformed into Weinreb amide 6, with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine in the presence of isopropylmagnesium chloride, then the amide was reacted with 1-octylmagnesium bromide to give the 1-nonanone derivative 7 that was finally dibrominated to 2. The route passing through ethyl mercaptoacetate and Weinreb amide (directly obtained from an ester) represents a safer alternative with respect to that previously reported for the obtainment of 2-acylthieno[3,4-b]thiophenes since it avoids the use of a highly carcinogenic reagent, i.e. chloromethyl methyl ether.
As for 3, a three steps procedure was used. Ethyl ester 5 was brominated to 8, hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid 9 and then esterified with octanol to 3.

The molecular weights of PK and PE were estimated by GPC. Weight-average molecular weight, Mw, number average molecular weight, Mn, and polydispersity are reported in Table 1.

1H NMR spectra of PK and PE in CDCl3 (Fig. 1) show very broad lines in the aromatic region, which extend from 8.5 to 5.5 ppm, and less broad signals in the aliphatic one. Broad lines are due to fast relaxing, slowly moving species formed in solution by aggregation of polymeric chains, probably in π-stacks.
These aggregates are absent in much longer polythiophenes containing only the 4,4′-bis(alkylsulfanyl)bithienyl unit, and can be attributed to a consequence of the presence of alternated thienothienyl units in the polymer backbone. Signals from the aliphatic chains are highly overlapped, especially for PK, for which also CH2CO and CH2S signals can be distinguished only by 2D NMR experiments, such as HSQC or TOCSY (Fig. S1a and S2a, ESI). In the HSQC spectrum two broad H,C correlations centered at 3.0/39.1 ppm and 2.9/36.9 ppm permit CH2CO and CH2S signals to be resolved and assigned, on the basis of the carbon chemical shifts, respectively. Similarly, in the TOCSY spectrum, the two H,H correlations 3.0/1.8 ppm and 2.9/1.7 ppm allow detection of signals of the β methylenes of each chain. Spin–spin relaxation times of aromatic protons were too short to permit detection of the directly bonded carbons of the polymeric backbone through the HSQC experiment.
Nevertheless, the NOESY (Fig. S3, ESI) experiment permits the downfield component of the aromatic broad hump (δ > 7.3 ppm) to be attributed to thienothienyl protons (since it shows the Overhauser effect with the downfield broad component centered at 3.1 ppm of CH2CO signals) and the upfield one (δ < 7.3 ppm) to the thienyl protons (since it shows the Overhauser effect with the upfield broad component centered at 2.8 ppm of CH2S signals) in π-stack aggregates.
As for PE, CH2O and CH2S are readily distinguished directly from their different chemical shifts (4.46 and 2.93 ppm, respectively) in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 1b). Starting from these two resonances, the other protons belonging to the two spin systems were assigned through a TOCSY experiment (Fig. S2b, ESI), and carbons through a HSQC experiment (Fig. S1b, ESI). The NOESY spectrum confirms the attribution of aromatic signals below 7.3 ppm to thienyl protons, since a cross-peak is detected between these and CH2S protons, whereas no appreciable Overhauser effect is observed in PE between aromatic signals above 7.3 ppm and OCH2 protons of the ester group.
For both polymers NMR measurements revealed the presence of terminal CH2–CH2–CH3 units shielded and deshielded with respect to the principal ones. Even though they are not easily attributable to alkylsulfanyl or acyl chains, these shielded and deshielded terminal CH2–CH2–CH3 units indicate that the end parts of some alkyl chains are partially embedded in aggregates. Deshielded terminal chains should be localized mainly close to the polymer backbone plane, whereas the shielded ones should be mainly localized above or below the polymer backbone plane.
The UV-visible spectrum of PK features an unstructured band in chloroform, with a maximum at 651 nm (Fig. 2) and a shoulder at 830 nm, attributable to the formation of aggregates, appears. After addition of a poor solvent (methanol), the maximum moves to 673 nm and the shoulder enhances. The film cast from chloroform solution displays a maximum at 693 nm and the shoulder becomes even higher. A second absorption is present in all spectra around 450–470 nm.
Maxima of UV-visible-NIR spectra of PE are slightly red-shifted with respect to those of PK: PE absorbing at 674 nm in chloroform, at 707 nm after addition of methanol to chloroform and in film cast from chloroform on glass (Fig. 2). The absorption at λ below 500 nm is lower than that of PK.
The optical band gap, obtained by the onset of the UV-visible-NIR absorption bands in films, is 1.31 eV for both polymers. It compares well with the optical band gaps reported for copolymers formed by alternated alkyl 2-carboxylatethieno[3,4-b]thienyl and thienyl units. The bandwidth of absorption of both polymers (about 300 nm) is intermediate between that reported for the copolymers containing thienothienyl and thienyl units in 1:1 and 1:3 ratios. The band gap observed for PK and PE is lower than that reported for alternated polymers containing thienothienyl and benzodithienyl units.
The thermal stability of the polymer was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 3. The TGA reveals that, in the inert nitrogen atmosphere, the onset point of the 5% weight loss temperature (Td) is 320 and 330 °C for PK and PE, respectively. These results indicate that the polymers have a good thermal stability, and they are stable enough for the application in PSC devices.

Fig. 4 shows the CV curves recorded on a polymer thin film of PK and PE (the relevant thin films are obtained by drop-casting on glassy carbon electrodes from a 1 mM chloroform solution). The average film thickness is found to be in the 1 to 3 μm range (determined by AFM scratch measurements).
The PK and PE CV curves show some common features, which also resemble the electrochemical results obtained in the case of previously examined thiophene-based polymers. Remarkably, the redox processes underlying the CV measurements are different in nature for the cathodic (showing a certain degree of reversibility) and anodic regimes (oxidation involves some irreversible process to occur, likely associated with the further electrochemical oxidation of thiophene moieties).
In the cathodic regime, the forward scan CV curves (E = 0.00 V the initial potential) feature a sharp current peak (negative doping), which can be assigned to a single-electron reduction process (the reduction peak potentials are −1.38 and −1.35 V for PK and PE, respectively). The backward CV curve of PK shows a peculiar (almost triangular) oxidation peak, found 100 mV more positive than the reduction potential.
The charge associated with the oxidation process (which can be calculated by integrating the peak current as a function of the potential, in fact: E(t) = Eini + νt, where Eini is the CV initial potential, ν is the scan rate in V s−1, and t is the time) allows determination of the (oxidation peak)/(reduction peak) charge ratio, which for PK is 3/4. The backward CV curve of PE is more regular and similar (in shape) to curves already found in the oxidation regime (backward curve), with an oxidation/reduction peak area ratio close to unity. Thus, the redox process underlying the negative doping, for PK and PE, appears as a quasi-reversible (in fact closer to irreversibility than to reversibility) single-electron transfer process. In the oxidation regime (positive doping), the PK electrochemical behaviour is characterized by the appearance of a wide and sloppy oxidation peak (forward scan), whose maximum can be tentatively found at about 1.45 V. As a whole the oxidation processes show a noticeable irreversible character (PK and PE). This is definitively proved by the large difference in the oxidation/reduction peak area ratio: the backward peak area (reduction), found at +0.75 V, is less than 20% of the forward (oxidation) peak area. By and large the same behaviour, in the oxidation regime, is found also for PE.
The analysis of CV curves allowed the determination of the onset oxidation and reduction potentials: oxidation onset values +0.40 and 0.37 V, reduction onset values −1.10 and −1.16 V, for PK and PE respectively (onset redox potentials are taken where the CV curve deviates from the baseline). HOMO (EHOMO), LUMO (ELUMO) and band gap (ECVg) energies (Table 2) can be estimated on the basis of the following relationships:EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4), ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4), ECVg = e(Eox − Ered). Calculated values are in eV units.
HOMO and LUMO energies are very close to those reported for copolymers formed by alternated alkyl 2-carboxylate thieno[3,4-b]thienyl and unsubstituted or alkyl substituted thienyl units. On the other hand, HOMO energies of PK and PE are higher than those reported for alternated polymers containing thienothienyl and benzodithienyl units, indicating a stronger electron-donor character of the bis(octylsulfanyl)bithienyl unit with respect to the benzodithienyl one.

We studied the performance of PK and PE as electron donors in polymer–fullerene solar cells. Since the PK and PE have limited absorption under 600 nm (Fig. 2), we used [70]PCBM as an electron acceptor. This fullerene has a stronger and broader absorption compared to [60]PCBM and it can partially compensate for the limited absorption of the donor polymer in the visible part of the spectrum. Since the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is related to the number of absorbed photons, the use of [70]PCBM can improve the current output of the corresponding polymer–fullerene devices. This enhancement can benefit also the PCE of the solar cell because it is directly proportional to the Jsc. Indeed, in the last year it has been shown that devices realized using [70]PCBM as an electron acceptor have a higher Jsc compared to the ones based on the analogous [60]PCBM, due to the increase of absorption.

We fabricated photovoltaic cells according to the procedure reported in the Experimental part. The geometry of the device is: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PX:[70]PCBM/Ca/Al (X = K, E). The photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating of the blend solution of PX:[70]PCBM (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 w/w) dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, in which both copolymers show good solubility, on an ITO/PEDOT:PSS patterned substrates. The thickness of all the blends is in the range of 100–120 nm. The active area of the cells is 0.35 cm2. All the devices were prepared under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and characterized in air, without encapsulation, by EQE and I–V measurements performed in the dark and under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2).

Fig. 5 shows the I–V curves of the devices characterized under simulated light (AM 1.5G). The corresponding Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table 3. The device fabricated using a blend of PK:[70]PCBM with a weight ratio of 1:2 exhibited a value of Voc of 454 mV, Jsc of 4.82 mA cm−2 and FF of 51%, and the resulting PCE of 1.1%. The Voc of all the devices is quite low: this effect can be ascribed to the position of the HOMO level of PK and PE as confirmed by the electrochemical measurements. Since the Voc depends on the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor, there is room to increase it using a fullerene derivative with a higher LUMO level (but still suitable for the charge transfer from the donor polymer). Moreover, the Voc of the PK based devices is greater than the corresponding PE ones because the HOMO level of PK (Table 2) is deeper.

The [70]PCBM weight ratio affects the photovoltaic parameters of the investigated solar cells: this depends on the balance between the absorbance and the charge transporting ability of the active layer. In addition, since [70]PCBM contributes substantially to the absorption of the blend film, a greater amount of fullerene can improve also the matching between the response of the device and the solar spectrum.

Fig. 6 shows the EQE spectra of the best PSC based on PK:[70]PCBM (1:2 w/w) and PE:[70]PCBM (1:1 w/w) blends and under the illumination of monochromatic light. The devices show a broad response range from 350 to 1000 nm and the EQE is greater than 20% between 450 and 650 nm. Considering that the absorption of both polymers is maximum at 660–680 nm, there is a substantial contribution from [70]PCBM to the photocurrent generation. The value of the Jsc obtained through integration of the EQE over the wavelength range is in good agreement with the one measured from the I–V curve for both blends.

Since morphology is known to have a strong relationship with efficiency, topographical characterization of active layers was undertaken. AFM micrographs of PK slowly cast from chloroform on mica (Fig. 7) reveal grains of micrometric size on a rather flat surface. At higher magnifications the flat regions show a fine texture formed by not homogeneous overlapped sheets 3–6 nm thick. AFM micrographies of PE slowly cast from chloroform on mica (Fig. 7) show that this polymer forms surfaces more grainy than those obtained from PK, with a different organization, formed by structures with a diameter around 300 nm that here and there protrude for a few nanometers. These structures seem to be formed by vertical columns, arranged around an inner hole about 100 nm large.

The surface topography is different for polymers in blend with [70]PCBM and spin coated on an ITO/PEDOT:PSS surface (Fig. 8). In this case we observed grainy films with good intermixing of the polymer and fullerene components, characterized by uniform surfaces. The smooth roughness observed for all the samples indicates that phase separation between the tested polymers and [70]PCBM occurred. The average structures are smaller in the case of PK:[70]PCBM blends (30 × 60 nm vs. 50 × 80 nm for PE:[70]PCBM blends). As a consequence, the performance of the PK:[70]PCBM based devices is better in terms of FF and PCE.

The synthesis, structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties of alternating thienothiophene-bithiophene copolymers PK and PE were investigated. A new synthetic route to the 2-acylthienothienyl unit of PK, avoiding the use of chloromethyl methyl ether in favour of a Weinreb amide intermediate, was proposed.


PK and PE possess good solubility in common organic solvents, filmability, proneness to form π-stacks and moderate solvatochromism. The alternation of 2-substituted thienothienyl and bis(alkylsulfanyl)bithienyl units produces polymers absorbing at high wavelengths and wide absorption bandwidths. From CV measurements HOMO, LUMO and band gap energies were estimated.
Their good thermal stability (up to 320 °C) permits their use in PSC devices and PK and PE have been used as donor materials in BHJ PSCs, in combination with [70]PCBM. The EQE curve shows a broad response from 350 to 1000 nm and the best device (realized using a blend of PK:[70]PCBM 1:2 weight ratio) reached a PCE of 1.11% under a simulated solar spectrum (under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G).
AFM micrographs show that the small difference in monomer structure leads to substantial modifications in film morphology, as far as pristine polymers are concerned. Blending with PCBM produces BHJ films with similar features but different roughness, which is probably due to a diverse supramolecular architecture, and can account, together with the higher absorbance around 500 nm, for the higher PCE observed for PK with respect to PE blends.
