The poisonous metal lead (Pb) is one of the key limiting factors for the large-scale industrial application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we replaced some of the lead iodide (PbI2) with strontium iodide (SrI2) in the precursor solution to prepare Pb-less perovskite films and fabricate mesoscopic solar cells via the antisolvent-assisted single step method and the two-step spin-coating method. The effect of Sr substitution on the film formation and photovoltaic properties of perovskites was illuminated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analyses. The results show that, in the antisolvent-assisted single step method, Sr substitution has an impact on the formation of the intermediate phase, resulting in a lower coverage and an increased defect density of perovskite films. When the Sr content rises from 0 to 5 mol%, the device's power conversion efficiency (PCE) decreases from 15.22% to 6.37%. In the two-step spin-coating method, a moderate amount of SrI2 can change the chemical composition of the PbI2 precursor, resulting in less PbI2 and a decreased defect density in perovskite films. When the Sr content is 10 mol% in the PbI2 solution, the solar cell exhibits a considerable PCE of 15.52% under AM 1.5G solar illumination.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials like MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) have been one of the research hotspots due to their high absorbance in visible light, narrow bandgap, high carrier mobility and low exciton binding energy, and the PCE of the solar cell based on this kind of perovskite material has risen from 3.8% to 22.1% in the past few years. However, poisonous Pb2+ is one of the key limiting factors for the commercialization of PSCs in the future. Generally, the chemical formula of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite compounds is defined as ABX3, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent the monovalent organic cation (CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+) and the bivalent metal cation (Pb2+, Sn2+), respectively, and ‘X’ represents the halide ion (Cl−, Br− or I−). The crystal structure of perovskites is determined by the tolerance factor t:

(1)
where
rA, rB and rX represent the radii of three kinds of ions, respectively. If 0.81 ≤ t ≤ 1.11, the crystal structure of the compound is a 3-D perovskite structure. According to this law, some eco-friendly metal ions such as Sn2+, Ge2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Co2+ and Eu2+ may replace Pb2+ in perovskites. Since Sn2+ and Ge2+ could be oxidized to tetravalent ions easily, the crystal structure of the Sn2+- or Ge2+-containing perovskites is not stable, which leads to poor photovoltaic performance of the device. The introduction of Ca2+ could increase the PCE of solar cells, but the substituted Pb content is only 1 mol%.

Among the nontoxic bivalent metal ions, the radius of Sr2+ (118 pm) is closest to the radius of Pb2+ (119 pm); so the introduction of Sr2+ may induce a negligible change in the lattice constant. In addition, first principles calculation has predicted that strontium halide and lead dihalide have a similar bonding pattern. Therefore, so far, much work has focused on the effects of Sr doping on PSCs. Sessolo and coworkers added a certain amount of SrI2 into a perovskite precursor solution containing Pb(Ac)2 (lead acetate) and MAI (molar ratio = 0.73:2.19) to fabricate planar solar cells. Because the perovskite surface could be passivated by the enrichment of Sr in the form of Sr(Ac)2, when the Sr doping content was 2 mol%, the fill factor (FF) reached 85%, and the device's PCE exceeded 15%. Chen and coworkers introduced SrCl2 as an additive into hole-conductor-free fully printable mesoscopic PSCs, and they found that SrCl2 could incorporate into MAPbI3, resulting in the formation of CH3NH3PbI3(SrCl2)x perovskites, which are high-quality perovskites with better crystallinity, lower defect density and high pore filling in the mesoporous structure. As x = 0.1, the device achieved a PCE of 16%. In these two reports, the introduction of Sr improved the photovoltaic performance of devices, but Sr dopants were used as additives, which means that the amount of Pb in the film is not reduced. Shai et al. replaced part of the PbI2 with SrCl2 in a two-step perovskite preparing procedure to fabricate planar solar cells. In their work, the introduction of Sr increased the exciton binding energy and trap density of the perovskites, which had a negative impact on device performance. When the SrCl2 content was 5 mol%, due to the up-shifted conduction band edge energy level of the perovskite, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) increased, and the efficiency could hold at 16.3% with a negligible drop. Wu et al. investigated the influence of Sr and Ba doping on the planar PSCs by preparing the precursor solution with SrI2 (or BaI2), PbCl2, and MAI in a certain proportion. As a result, the PCEs decreased because of the reduced coverage of perovskite films with increasing Sr or Ba content. When the substituted content of Pb was 10 mol%, the PCEs of Sr- and Ba-doped devices were 0.5% and 9.7%, respectively. In these two studies, we find that Sr substitution weakened the photovoltaic performance of PSCs despite the increased Voc and thermal stability in the former report. Moreover, there is no consensus about the effects of deposition methods of perovskites and device structures on the Sr-contained PSCs.
In the various structures of PSCs, the mesoscopic architecture (Fig. 1) is very popular, and many highly efficient PSCs are based on it. In the mesoscopic architecture, a 100–200 nm mesoporous layer is beneficial for the film formation of perovskites, and the bulk contact between perovskites and the mesoscopic scaffold can enhance light scattering which makes for stronger light harvesting. Furthermore, the mesoporous layer, as the electron transport material, can improve the electron collection efficiency because of the high specific surface area. Naturally, the perovskite layer in mesoscopic solar cells should be thinner than that in planar solar cells, namely, less Pb is needed in the mesoscopic architecture. Therefore, it is believed that the mesoscopic architecture is more eco-friendly for the commercialization of PSCs. Nevertheless, Sr substitution has been seldom applied to mesoscopic PSCs until now. Bai et al. used SrI2 as a substituent to replace some PbI2 in the fabrication of mesoscopic solar cells based on the single step deposition method. However, the film formation of perovskites could not be effectively controlled, and when the SrI2 content was 10 mol%, the PSC only had a PCE of 1.97%.
In this paper, we chose the mesoscopic architecture to fabricate Sr-substituted solar cells via antisolvent-assisted single step deposition and two-step spin-coating deposition, and studied the effect of Sr substitution on the film formation and photovoltaic properties of perovskites. The SEM and XRD analyses demonstrate that, in the antisolvent-assisted single step method, Sr substitution has a negative impact on the formation of the intermediate phase, and the coverage of perovskites decreases with the increase of the SrI2 content. Meanwhile, the results of steady PL and TRPL measurements indicate that the introduction of Sr increases the defect density of the perovskites. Therefore, the device's PCE decreases dramatically. However, in the two-step spin-coating method, the characterization results show that a moderate amount of SrI2 substitution can change the chemical component of the PbI2 precursor, resulting in less PbI2 and lower defect density in the perovskites. For this device, a considerable PCE of 15.52% is obtained when the SrI2 content in PbI2 solution is 10 mol%.

Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation.


F-Doped SnO2 (FTO) glasses (TEC-14, NSG) were treated by ultrasonic cleaning with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol in turn. Then, the FTO glasses were put into a UV Ozone (UVO) cleaner for 20 min ozone treatment. To prepare the TiO2 blocking layer, 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) solution was spin-coated on an FTO substrate at 2000 rpm for 20 s, which was heated at 120 °C for 10 min. Afterwards, 0.3 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s. After heating at 120 °C for 10 min, the substrate was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 paste was spin-coated on the blocking layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s, where the pristine paste (18NRT, Dyesol) was diluted in ethanol (mass ratio = 1:5.5). After drying at 100 °C for 5 min, the substrate was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min to remove the organic components.


In the process of the antisolvent-assisted single step method, 1.3 mmol CH3NH3I (99.5%, Xi'an p-OLED Corp.), 1.3(1 − x) mmol PbI2 (99.9%, Xi'an p-OLED Corp.) and 1.3x mmol SrI2 (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05) were dissolved in a 1 mL mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethyl formamide (DMF) (3/7, v/v) to prepare different Sr-substituted perovskite precursor solutions. 80 μL of perovskite solution was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 substrate in a two-step program at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. 200 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the substrate 5 s prior to the end of the program. The substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.

A two-step spin-coating deposition was performed in ambient air (16 ± 2 °C, RH = 20 ± 5%). SrI2 and PbI2 were dissolved according to a certain proportion in a mixture of ACN (acetonitrile) and DMSO (3/7, v/v) at 80 °C to make 1 M Pb1−xSrxI2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) solution. The hot Sr-substituted PbI2 precursor solution was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film (preheated at 45 °C) at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form the PbI2 precursor film. After spinning, 200 μL of CH3NH3I solution (150 mg CH3NH3I and 15 mg CH3NH3Cl (99.9%, Xi'an p-OLED Corp.) in 10 mL isopropanol) was loaded on the PbI2 precursor film for 60 s. Then the substrate was spun at 5000 rpm for 10 s and dried at 105 °C for 10 min.

60 μL of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99.5%, Xi'an p-OLED Corp.) solution (72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, 80 nm of gold was thermally evaporated on the spiro-OMeTAD-coated film.


The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were measured in ambient atmosphere using an electrochemical workstation (CHR660C, CH Instruments). The cells were illuminated using a 500 W xenon light source equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (WXS-90L2, Wacom) at a calibrated intensity of 100 mV cm−2, as determined by a calibrated Si solar cell. The active area of the cell was defined as 0.09 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Dmax-2500, Rigaku Japan) to analyse the crystal phase of the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images were recorded using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Supra 55, ZEISS Merlin). Steady photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained with a lifetime and steady state spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for all the devices were performed using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, EnliTech Taiwan). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer (TU-1901, Beijing Persee). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS ULTRADLD, Kratos Japan).


In single step deposition, antisolvent dropping is a common method to boost the film formation of perovskites. In this method, PbI2 and MAI are dissolved in a mixture of DMSO and DMF (or γ-butyrolactone) to prepare perovskite precursor solution. During the spin-coating process, the antisolvent (chlorobenzene, methylbenzene, diethyl ether or ethyl acetate) is dripped on the rotating substrate, and the “MAI-PbI2-DMSO” intermediate phase crystallizes quickly and forms a compact film. After annealing, the intermediate transforms to perovskites. Sr and Pb are in the different main groups in the periodic table of elements, and Sr has a lower electronegativity than Pb. In addition, Sr2+ has a higher coordination number than Pb2+. Consequently, SrI2 should have an impact on the formation of the “MAI-PbI2-DMSO” intermediate phase. First, the SEM images of different Sr-substituted perovskite precursor films and perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2. The pristine perovskite precursor is in the form of a tight arrangement of unordered grains (Fig. 2a). When SrI2 is introduced (Fig. 2b–f), rod grains and pinholes appear in the films, and film coverage reduces with increasing Sr content. Similarly, in Fig. 2g, the perovskite film without Sr is fully covered on the mesoporous substrate. With Sr content increasing, the amount of pinholes increases and the holes become larger (Fig. 2h–l). It is noteworthy that when the Sr content is over 2 mol%, the coverage of the perovskites decreases quickly.

To further investigate the effect of Sr substitution on the crystal structure of perovskite films, XRD experiments were conducted for different Sr-substituted intermediates and perovskite films, and the XRD spectra are displayed in Fig. 3. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, there are four chief peaks at 2θ of 6.6°, 7.3°, 9.3° and 25.4° for all the samples, which belong to the diffraction of (002), (021), (022) and (151) crystal faces of the “MAI-PbI2-DMSO” intermediates, respectively. When the Sr content increases, the intensities and height ratio of the former three diffraction peaks show a notable change, and impurity peaks appear at 10° and 10.7° for the Sr-substituted perovskite precursor films (Fig. 3b). This suggests that Sr substitution can change the crystal growth orientation of intermediates, which may account for the morphology change of perovskite precursors (Fig. 2a–e). In Fig. 3c, three strong diffraction peaks of all the samples at 2θ of 14.1°, 28.5° and 31.9° are attributed to the diffraction of (110), (220) and (310) crystal faces of perovskites, respectively. Moreover, Sr-substituted perovskites have stronger diffraction signals than the pristine perovskite. The observation indicates that the introduction of Sr does not change the crystal lattice of the MAPbI3 compound, but the perovskite crystallinity is improved.
Afterwards, mesoscopic solar cells were fabricated to investigate the effect of Sr substitution on the devices’ photovoltaic performance. The J–V curves of different Sr-substituted devices recorded under standard AM1.5G solar spectrum illumination conditions are displayed in Fig. 4, and Table 1 summarizes the corresponding J–V parameters. Among all the devices, the pristine PSC has the highest PCE of 15.22%. After SrI2 is included, Voc and FF decrease obviously with the increasing Sr content. Notably, when the Sr content is over 2 mol%, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) also decreases. According to the J–V curves, the PCE can be expressed by the ratio of the maximum electrical power (Pmax) to the total incident power (Pin) (eqn (2)). In consequence, the PCE of Sr-substituted PSC decreases with the increase of the Sr content and exhibits a more notable reduction as the Sr content is over 2 mol%. In order to verify the repeatability of the formed cells, we fabricated 6 batches of devices and performed the J–V measurements under the same conditions, and the statistics of J–V parameters are illustrated in Fig. 5. Then the tendency agrees well with the results in Table 1.

For PSCs, a low coverage of perovskite layers will lead to the direct contact between the electron-transporting layer and hole-transporting layer, which can induce a severe recombination of carriers. Thus, the device has a poor efficiency. According to the SEM images (Fig. 2), when the Sr content is more than 2 mol%, the coverage of perovskite films decreases dramatically. Consequently, the devices’ PCEs are below 9%. However, when the Sr content is less than 2 mol%, the FF and Voc still decrease despite the high coverage of perovskite films. To understand the deeper difference brought by Sr substitution, steady PL and TRPL measurements were performed for the perovskite films with 0–2 mol% Sr substitution. As shown in the steady PL spectra (Fig. 6a), every sample has an emission peak at around 770 nm, and the PL intensities of Sr-substituted films are lower than that of the pristine perovskite film, indicating a more non-radiative recombination in the Sr-substituted film. In the TRPL spectra (Fig. 6b), Sr substitution accelerates the attenuation of perovskite layers’ PL signals. The PL decay curves were fitted to a bi-exponential function:
(3)
where
y0 is the constant; τ1 is the lifetime of the fast component (the lifetime of carriers at the perovskites’ surface and crystal boundaries), ns; τ2 is the lifetime of the slow component (the lifetime of carriers in the perovskites’ grains), ns; and B1 and B2 are the relative amplitudes of the fast component and slow component, respectively.Table 2 gives the fitting results. According to the integration of the fast component (the product of B1 and τ1) and the integration of the slow component (the product of B2 and τ2), the relative contribution Ai (eqn (4)) of the two components and the mean carrier lifetime τmean (eqn (5)) are obtained. The value of τmean reflects the defect state of perovskites.

(4)
τmean = A1τ1 + A2τ2
(5)
As shown in
Table 2, the pristine perovskite film has a longer mean carrier lifetime of 102.30 ns than Sr-substituted perovskite films. When the Sr content is 2 mol%, the mean carrier lifetime decreases to 28.08 ns. Since the accelerated attenuation of photoluminescence signals is ascribed to the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination at defects, the Sr substitution increases the defect density of perovskites prepared by the antisolvent-assisted single step method. Furthermore, a higher defect density will lead to a lower quasi-Fermi level and a reduced carrier mobility, which decreases the Voc and FF of devices. Therefore, the Sr-substituted PSC has a lower PCE. With SrI2 substitution having an unsatisfactory impact on the formation of intermediates, resulting in a low coverage of perovskite films, the antisolvent-assisted single step deposition could not meet the requirement of reducing Pb content by more in the fabrication of PSCs. So, a two-step spin-coating deposition is utilized in the following section.

The two-step spin-coating method is one of the basic preparation technologies for perovskite films. In this method, the PbI2 film is deposited on the substrate, followed by reacting with MAI via a solution-process or evaporation process. Here, we dissolved PbI2 in a DMSO and ACN mixture (v/v, 7/3) and obtained the PbI2 precursor film by spin-coating the hot solution. Then MAI solution (containing 10 wt% MACl) was spin-coated on the PbI2 precursor film. After annealing, the compact perovskite film was obtained. Then the precursor solutions in which SrI2 replaced different mole percentages of PbI2 were used to prepare the Sr-substituted perovskite films. Fig. 7 shows the morphologies of different Sr-substituted PbI2 precursors and perovskite films. As seen in Fig. 7a, the pristine PbI2 precursor film is in the form of rod grains and amorphous matters bonded with each other, and there are some little pinholes in the film. Compared with the flat morphology of the PbI2 film, this rough morphology is beneficial for the reaction between PbI2 and MAI. Then the corresponding pristine perovskite displays a large grain size (Fig. 7f). When the Sr content is 5 mol%, the PbI2 precursor takes on a dendritic structure (Fig. 7b). 10 mol% and 15 mol% Sr-substituted PbI2 precursors have similar microstructures like rods growing on a layer (Fig. 7c and d). When the Sr content reaches 20 mol%, a uniform film appears (Fig. 7e). We speculate that this transformation is caused by the change in the chemical component in PbI2 precursor solution. Here, the Sr content seems to have a negligible influence on the films’ coverage (Fig. 7g–j). Even though Sr substitution is increased to 20 mol%, the perovskite film still has a high coverage on the mesoporous substrate. However, the grain size of perovskites decreases and grain boundaries become obscure once SrI2 is added into the precursor solution.

The XRD spectra of different Sr-substituted PbI2 precursor films and perovskite films are illustrated in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8a, there are two chief peaks at 2θ of 9.3° and 9.8° for the pristine PbI2 precursor film, which confirms the existence of the PbI2·DMSO adduct. With increasing Sr content, the intensities of the two peaks decrease, and new peaks appear at around 5.4° and 10.6°. It appears that the introduction of SrI2 changes the chemical component of the PbI2 precursor. Just like the perovskite films prepared by the antisolvent-assisted single step method, the three strong peaks at 14.1°, 28.5° and 31.9° are attributed to the diffraction of (110), (220) and (310) crystal faces (Fig. 8b), and the peak intensity of perovskites deceases with the increase of the Sr content. The observation indicates that the introduction of Sr into the PbI2 solution has little effect on the crystal structure of perovskites, but it seems to reduce their crystallinity. In addition, there is a diffraction peak at 2θ of around 12.7° representing the remaining PbI2 in the pristine perovskite film. The peak height decreases as the Sr content is 5 mol%, and when the Sr content is over 10 mol%, the peak of PbI2 disappears. It suggests that the unreacted PbI2 reduces with increasing Sr content.
Based on these Sr-substituted perovskites prepared by the two-step spin-coating method, mesoscopic solar cells were fabricated to investigate the effect of Sr substitution on the device's photovoltaic performance. Fig. 9 and Table 3 show the results of J–V measurements. When the Sr content in PbI2 solution is 10 mol%, the Jsc, Voc and FF of PSCs are higher than others’, and the PCE reaches 15.52%. Compared with the pristine PSC, when the Sr content is 5 mol% or 15 mol%, the device's efficiency shows a slight decrease. However, the 20 mol% Sr-substituted PSC has a lowest PCE of 1.61%. The statistics of 6 batches of devices’ J–V parameters is shown in Fig. 10, and the trend of J–V parameters with the increasing Sr content in PbI2 solution coincides with that shown in Table 3. In fact, even if the Sr content in PbI2 solution is 15 mol%, the solar cell still has an acceptable PCE of around 12%. In addition, hysteresis phenomena still exist in all the as-prepared devices. For instance, the 10 mol% Sr-substituted PSC shows a lower PCE obtained with the forward scan than with the reverse scan (Fig. S1 in the ESI). This may be attributed to the TiO2 electron-transporting materials or deposition method. Thus, the deposition method and cell structure need to be optimized in further work.

The EQE spectra of the different Sr-substituted devices are shown in Fig. 11. It is observed that the pristine perovskite film has a higher EQE in the short wavelength region than the Sr-substituted ones (Fig. 11a). In the long wavelength region, the EQEs of the 5 mol% and 10 mol% Sr-substituted devices are higher than that of the pristine one. Consequently, when the Sr content is no more than 10 mol%, the integrated current density changes little (Fig. 11b). However, when the Sr content is over 10 mol%, the integrated current density decreases due to the reduced EQE. The UV-visible absorption spectra and the corresponding Tauc plots are displayed in Fig. S2 in the ESI. It appears that Sr substitution has little impact on perovskite's bandgap but can enhance its absorbance.
To identify the existence of Sr, XPS and EDX measurements were carried out for the pristine and 10 mol% Sr-substituted perovskite films. The right-shift of I 3d and Pb 4f signals in the XPS spectra (Fig. S3 in the ESI) and the uniform distribution of Sr shown in EDX elemental mapping images (Fig. S4 in the ESI) indicate that Sr replaces Pb in the perovskite crystal lattice successfully. Then steady PL and TRPL measurements were performed to study the effect of Sr substitution on the dynamics of carriers in perovskite films. In the PL spectra (Fig. 12a), each sample has an emission peak at a wavelength of around 770 nm, and the PL intensity increases with the increase of the Sr content first and then reduces. When the Sr content in PbI2 solution is 10 mol%, the perovskite film has the highest PL intensity. Correspondingly, with increasing Sr content, the PL decay of the perovskite film becomes slower first and then faster (Fig. 12b). The 10 mol% Sr-substituted perovskite film has the slowest PL decay. These observations demonstrate that the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination decreases in the 10 mol% Sr-substituted perovskite film, in line with the XPS result in the ESI. The fitting results of PL decay curves fitted to the bi-exponential function (eqn (3)) are summarized in Table 4. Obviously, the mean carrier lifetime of the perovskite film reaches the highest value of 198.68 ns at the Sr content of 10 mol% and then decreases to 25.89 ns at the Sr content of 20 mol%. In consequence, the 10 mol% Sr-substituted perovskite film has the lowest defect density, indicating that the least recombination of photo-generated carriers happens in the film. Therefore, the device based on the 10 mol% Sr-substituted perovskite film possesses higher Voc and FF than others.

In summary, we prepared the Pb-less perovskite films with different amounts of SrI2 substitution and fabricated the mesoscopic solar cells based on the antisolvent-assisted single step method and two-step spin-coating method. Then the effect of Sr substitution on the film formation of perovskites and photovoltaic performance of PSCs was discussed. The SEM and XRD analyses show that, in the antisolvent-assisted single step method, SrI2 substitution can change the morphology of perovskite intermediates, resulting in a lower coverage of the perovskite film. Meanwhile, the steady PL and TRPL results demonstrate that the introduction of SrI2 can increase the defect density of the perovskite film, leading to a lower Voc and FF for PSCs. Therefore, when the Sr content is 5 mol%, the PSC only exhibits a PCE of around 6%. In the two-step spin-coating method, the results show that a moderate amount of SrI2 may change the chemical component of the PbI2 precursor, which is beneficial for the reduction of PbI2 remnant and defect density in perovskite films. When the Sr content in PbI2 solution is 10 mol%, the PSC exhibits a higher Voc and FF and exhibits a PCE of 15.52% under AM 1.5G solar illumination. However, further effort is required to study the chemical component of the Sr-substituted PbI2 precursor in the two-step procedure, which may give us a deeper understanding of the effect of preparation methods on the perovskites’ photovoltaic performance.
