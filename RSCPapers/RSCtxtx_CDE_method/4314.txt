We modified phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) for use as a stable, efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PCBM containing a surfactant Triton X-100 acts as the ETL and NiOX nanocrystals act as a hole transport layer (HTL). Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images showed that surfactant-modified PCBM (s-PCBM) forms a high-quality, uniform, and dense ETL on the rough perovskite layer. This layer effectively blocks holes and reduces interfacial recombination. Steady-state photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses confirmed that Triton X-100 improved the electron extraction performance of PCBM. When the s-PCBM ETL was used, the average power conversion efficiency increased from 10.76% to 15.68%. This improvement was primarily caused by the increases in the open-circuit voltage and fill factor. s-PCBM-based PSCs also showed good air-stability, retaining 83.8% of their initial performance after 800 h under ambient conditions.

In recent years, significant progress has been made towards the development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organometallic tri-halide absorber materials, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased dramatically from 3.8% to 22.1%. Besides the development of perovskite absorber materials and processing techniques, various structures of PSCs have been explored, including meso-structure and n–i–p or p–i–n type planar structure. Although meso-structured PSCs with TiO2 layers have achieved over 20% PCE, complex processes including high-temperature sintering (>450 °C) have limited the scale-up manufacture and also eliminated the potential for tandem and flexible substrate applications. Among the alternative device structures, p–i–n type planar PSCs, or “inverted” PSCs, are attracting more attention since they show much less hysteresis behavior in the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves than n–i–p type planar PSCs due to the passivation effect of fullerene derivatives deposited on the perovskite. The inverted PSCs have a typical structure of a transparent conductive oxide/hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL)/metal electrode. Recently, NiOX nanocrystals (NiOX NCs) synthesized via a chemical precipitation method have been successfully applied for the HTL of the inverted PSCs instead of the commonly used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). A colloidal dispersion of the synthesized NiOX NCs is used as a precursor for the solution processing of HTL without any post-treatment to achieve crystallinity. The appropriate alignment of the valence band of NiOX with that of the perovskite enables us to obtain high open circuit voltage (VOC). Additionally, the device with a NiOX NC HTL could show better long-term stability compared to the device with hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS. As such, inverted PSCs based on NiOx NCs are a promising avenue to realize highly efficient PSCs with low-temperature processing, no hysteresis, and good stability.

Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is generally used as the ETL in state-of-the-art inverted PSCs due to its high electron mobility and solubility in non-polar solvents. However, owing to the limited solubility and the low viscosity of a PCBM solution, it is difficult to form uniform, defect-free PCBM films on perovskite layers. Moreover, the aggregation behavior of PCBM induces poor surface morphologies, leaving parts of the perovskite surface uncovered. This results in charge recombination where the perovskite and metal electrode are in contact. To avoid this undesirable shunt path and facilitate the electron transport, many studies employed an interlayer (e.g., Ca, LiF, fullerene, organic functional molecules, polymers, and metal oxides) between the PCBM layer and the metal electrode. However, it requires additional processing of thermal evaporation or spin-coating, and may also suffer from instability and inadequate reproducibility of the interlayer. As an alternative, modifications of PCBM with additives have been investigated to improve its morphological and electrical properties. Previously, several polymers such as polystyrene (PS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polyethylenimine were utilized as additives to PCBM, but so far the use of organic small molecules is quite limited.
Herein, we first report a surfactant-modified PCBM (s-PCBM) with Triton X-100 for use in ETLs of NiOX-based inverted PSCs. Nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 was added to a PCBM solution to produce a thick and ultrasmooth PCBM layer. The surfactant improved the ETL performance by reducing interfacial charge recombination and enhancing electron transport. The PSC with s-PCBM achieved an optimal PCE of 16.08%, in comparison with 11.53% for the reference device. Our devices also show good stability in an ambient environment due to the inorganic HTL and the moisture-resistant ETL, maintaining a relative efficiency of over 80% of the initial value after 800 hours of exposure.


Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of the device and the s-PCBM ETL used in this work. The perovskite layer was sandwiched with an NiOx HTL and a PCBM ETL to form a p–i–n structure. We prepared the NiOX NCs using a chemical precipitation method described in a previous report. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. S1 confirms that sub-10 nm nanocrystals were synthesized successfully. The HTL was fabricated by spin-coating a NiOx NC-dispersed solution and no further post-treatment was performed. The light absorber was then deposited onto the HTL. Due to its excellent light absorbing capability and long carrier diffusion length, we selected mixed-cation–anion perovskite (FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3) as the light absorber. The ETL composed of PCBM and a small amount of surfactant (∼5 wt% with respect to PCBM) was deposited by spin-coating. The nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 is miscible in the PCBM solution due to its amphiphilic structure, which includes a hydrophilic polyethylene oxide chain and an aromatic hydrocarbon group. Finally, a 60 nm-thick Au top electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation to complete the device fabrication.

We investigated the photovoltaic performance of PSCs depending on varied ETLs. The PSCs were fabricated with four ETLs of PCBM and s-PCBM with varied surfactant concentrations (1, 3, and 5 wt%). The characteristic J–V curves of the devices with each ETL are plotted in Fig. 2a, and the related photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. By the addition of 1 wt% Triton X-100 to the PCBM solution, VOC and FF improved, and consequently the average PCE increased significantly from 10.76 to 14.17%. We increased the average PCE further, to 15.68%, by adding 3 wt% Triton X-100 to the PCBM solution. The optimal amount of Triton X-100 was determined to be 3 wt% of PCBM; the maximum PCE obtained was 16.08%, as shown in Fig. 2b. A higher surfactant concentration reduced the efficiency of the device owing to the insulating nature of Triton X-100. Additionally, the optimum spin rate for ETL deposition was determined through optimization experiments and the results are provided in the ESI (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 2c confirm that the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the device with s-PCBM was higher than that with pristine PCBM. In particular, the spectrum of the PSC with s-PCBM (3 wt%) showed a broad plateau around 80% in the range of 400–800 nm and the integrated JSC was 20.51 mA cm−2. These results show that the ETL performance was improved by the incorporation of Triton X-100, which might help to balance the charge-carrier transport within the device.

We also fabricated PSCs using PEDOT:PSS instead of NiOX and obtained J–V characteristics for these PSCs with PCBM and s-PCBM ETLs. Although the VOC of the PEDOT:PSS-based devices was relatively low in comparison with the VOC of those containing NiOX NCs, the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS-based PSC with the s-PCBM ETL was 13.99%, which is higher than the PCE of the reference device (11.31%). The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of these devices are presented in Fig. S3.
The hysteresis behavior as a function of the scanning direction for J–V characterization, i.e., the so-called J–V hysteresis, is an important indicator of a device's actual performance and stable power output. It is generally known that TiO2-based planar structured devices exhibit a significant hysteresis. This can be reduced by using inverted structures since PCBM can passivate the trap states on the surface of the perovskite layer. Our PSCs with PCBM and s-PCBM ETLs exhibited negligible hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 2d and e. We gathered further evidence of the reliability of the devices by measuring the steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power point under illumination. The photocurrent of our s-PCBM-based PSC rose instantaneously when first exposed to light, and then remained stable over the following 200 s of light exposure (Fig. 2f). The stabilized current density was 18.43 mA cm−2 when the applied bias was 0.85 V. The calculated PCE was 15.66%, which is consistent with the photovoltaic parameters obtained from J–V measurements.
To investigate the effects of Triton X-100, we examined the cross-sectional SEM images of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/HTL/perovskite/ETL samples. We could not identify a distinct PCBM layer when the ETL was made from pristine PCBM (Fig. 3a). This was due to the limited solubility and low viscosity of the PCBM solution. The s-PCBM formed distinct layers on the perovskite surface in the presence of more than 3 wt% of Triton X-100. The layer thicknesses of s-PCBM containing 3 and 5 wt% Triton X-100 were 50 and 60 nm, respectively. The addition of Triton X-100 increased the viscosity of the PCBM solution, and the perovskite layer was covered completely by s-PCBM. This s-PCBM layer prevented contact between the perovskite and the Au electrode, thus ensuring that charge recombination did not occur at the perovskite interface.
We further investigated the effect of Triton X-100 on the morphology of the ETL by examining the SEM and AFM images of the surface of the perovskite films, with and without coatings of the ETLs. The SEM images in Fig. S4 show the surfaces of a raw perovskite film and an ETL-covered perovskite film. The surface of the perovskite film deposited on NiOX NCs was densely packed with 200–400 nm crystallites without any pinhole. After coating the ETLs, the surfaces were smooth and the grain boundaries of the perovskite crystals were blurred. However in the AFM topographic images, there were visible differences in surface roughness (Fig. 4a–e). The uneven crystallites made the surface of the raw perovskite film rough, with a root mean square (RMS) value of 14.36 nm. As indicated by the reduction in the RMS value to 4.55 nm, the surface became smoother after it was coated with PCBM. The addition of Triton X-100 made the ETL surface smoother and reduced the RMS values to 3.99, 3.36, and 2.02 nm when the concentrations were 1, 3, and 5 wt%, respectively. The increased viscosity of the s-PCBM solution facilitated the formation of a uniform layer, as shown in the cross-sectional SEM image of Fig. 3. As a result, Triton X-100 in the ETL improved the interfacial contact at the metal electrode by creating a uniform, ultra-smooth layer. This reduced the current leakage at the interface, which enhanced the VOC of the PSC.
We measured the I–V characteristics of the FTO/PCBM and s-PCBM/Au configurations as shown in Fig. 5a to investigate their charge transport properties. The direct current (DC) conductivity (σ0) can be determined from the I–V plot using the equation I = σ0Ad−1V, where A is the active area and d is the thickness of the sample. The active area was 0.09 cm2 and the thicknesses of PCBM and s-PCBM films were adjusted to 40 nm and verified using the AFM profile system (Fig. S6). The calculated conductivities of PCBM and s-PCBM films were 2.12 × 10−3 and 2.68 × 10−3 mS cm−1, respectively. Although Triton X-100 is insulating, the incorporation of the surfactant could induce a better morphology of the PCBM film and result in higher conductivity. It indicates that Triton X-100 positively affects the electrical properties of PCBM along with its film morphology. Therefore, it is expected that the photo-generated charge carriers are more efficiently transported from the perovskite layer to the Au electrode through s-PCBM.
In order to compare the charge extraction efficiency of the ETLs, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded for the glass/NiOX/perovskite/PCBM and s-PCBM configurations (Fig. 5b). The addition of Triton X-100 to PCBM blue-shifted the PL peak from 767 nm to 761 nm. This shift indicates that s-PCBM with an improved film morphology reduced the surface trap states on the interfaces of the perovskite layer. What's more, the PL intensity of the sample with s-PCBM was largely quenched compared to that with pristine PCBM, implying a less radiative recombination of photo-generated electrons due to enhanced electron extraction from the perovskite absorber.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to further characterize the charge carrier transfer in the devices. Nyquist plots for the devices were plotted at a bias of 0.8 V under dark conditions and fitted using an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 5c). The charge transfer resistance (RCT), corresponding to the arcs, were calculated using EIS modeling. We obtained 15.68 and 4.03 kΩ for the devices with PCBM and s-PCBM, respectively. A smaller RCT value indicates efficient charge carrier transport; so less energy was lost during the charge transport process in the device. As all of the characteristics of the PSCs were held constant apart from those of the ETL, we attributed the low RCT of the s-PCBM-based device to improved charge transport through the ETL. The result of the EIS analysis further supports the improved electron transport performance of the s-PCBM. An illustration in Fig. 5d shows that the inclusion of Triton X-100 minimized interfacial recombination and enhanced the electron transport performance by facilitating the formation of a thick and uniform PCBM layer. Thus, we obtained good photovoltaic parameters and PCEs from s-PCBM-based PSCs.
Apart from the increased PCE, the modification of the PCBM ETL with Triton X-100 affects the device stability as well. We tested the air-stability of the PSCs with PCBM and s-PCBM ETLs under ambient conditions, at a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 30 ± 5%, over 800 h, as shown in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b and c and Table 2 show the J–V curves and related photovoltaic parameters of the devices before-and-after the air-stability test. After a month-long exposure to air, the relative efficiency of the device with the PCBM ETL degraded to 51.6% of its initial value, whereas the device with s-PCBM ETL maintained the relative efficiency of 83.8%. We attributed this result to the fact that the thicker ETL on the perovskite layer provided effective moisture protection.

In summary, we demonstrated an efficient ETL for inverted PSCs by modifying PCBM with a surfactant (Triton X-100). The surfactant added to a PCBM solution improves the interfacial properties of the ETL and accelerates electron transport from the perovskite absorber to the electrode. Having optimized the concentration of Triton X-100, we obtained a PSC with a maximum PCE of 16.08% with no current hysteresis. Moreover, as the ETL effectively blocks moisture permeation, the air-stability of our device was significantly improved. The procedures described in this study provide an efficient method for preparing reliable, high-performance ETLs for inverted PSCs.


Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, >99%) and PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution were purchased from Lumtec. PbI2 (99.9985%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, CH(NH2)2I) and methylammonium bromide (MABr, CH3NH3Br) were acquired from Dyesol.


PCBM was dissolved in chlorobenzene to the concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and was stirred for 60 min. Triton X-100 was added to the PCBM solution with different weight percentages with respect to PCBM (1, 3, and 5 wt%) and stirred for 60 min. The homogeneously mixed surfactant-modified PCBM (s-PCBM) solution was filtered using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter (pore size: 0.45 μm) and used as an electron transport material for perovskite solar cells.


The PSCs were fabricated on patterned, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 (Pilkington). FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially in deionized (DI) water, acetone, and 2-propanol for 60 min using an ultra-sonication bath. A NiOX hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited by spin-coating a NiOX nanocrystal (NC) dispersion solution at 3000 rpm. NiOX NCs were synthesized according to the procedures reported elsewhere. Briefly, 0.05 mol of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) was dispersed in 20 mL of DI water. Then 6 mL of NaOH solution (10 mol L−1) was slowly dropped into the solution to obtain a large amount of precipitation and stirred for 30 min. The precipitate was washed with deionized water three times, and dried at 80 °C. The obtained cyan powder was then calcined at 300 °C for 2 h (ramping rate: 5 °C min−1) to produce a black NiOX powder. The obtained NiOX NCs were dispersed in DI water to 15 mg ml−1 concentration. A perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 172 mg of FAI, 22 mg of MABr, 507 mg of PbI2, and 73 mg of PbBr2 in 1 mL of DMF/DMSO (v/v = 4/1) mixed solvent, and stirred at 60 °C. The perovskite precursor solution was spun-cast at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 25 s on the pre-heated substrate at 40 °C, under a N2 atmosphere. During the second spin-coating step, 0.3 mL of chlorobenzene was dripped onto the center of the substrate to promote perovskite film crystallization. After the whole spin-coating process, the substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 20 min to form FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 films. The electron transport layer was spin-coated from a PCBM solution (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) or as-prepared s-PCBM solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 60 nm-thick Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of the fabricated device was 0.09 cm2.

For PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, a HTL was formed by spin-coating a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution at 5000 rpm on a FTO substrate, and annealed at 125 °C for 20 min. Further fabrication procedures were the same as those for the NiOX-based PSCs.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired using an Park NX10 (Park Systems) and analyzed with XEI AFM data analysis software. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM 2100 (JEOL). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a JSM-6701F (JEOL). Photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite samples were recorded using an LS 45 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were measured by Zive Labs (Wonatech). The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using an I–V tracer (MP-160, Eko Instruments) under standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination from a 500 W xenon lamp, calibrated with a KG5-filtered Si reference cell (K801, McScience Inc.). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was acquired from 350 nm to 850 nm using a K3100 IPCE Measurement System (McScience Inc; chopping frequency of 4 Hz, without bias light and 10 nm step wavelength).
