A series of new water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) poly[(9,9-bis((N-(4-sulfonate-1-butyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-N-phenyl-4,4′-diphenylamine)] (PFNSO-TPA), poly[(9,9-bis((N-(4-sulfonate-1-butyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFNSO) and poly[(9,9-bis((N-(4-sulfonate-1-butyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PFNSO-BT), comprising identical sulfobetaine zwitterionic groups on their side chains but different conjugated main chain structures, were designed and developed as interface modification materials to improve electron collection in bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs), and to improve electron injection/transporting in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). The resulting WSCPs possess integrated advantages of excellent alcohol processability, interface modification functions and mobile ion free nature. The relationships between the WSCPs main chain structures and properties (including optical/electrical properties and interface modification functions in resulting devices) were investigated systematically. In PSCs, it was found that the WSCPs interface modification properties led to varying differences, but all of them can boost the photovoltaic performances of PSCs; encouragingly, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.74% could be achieved. In PLEDs, the interface modification functions of the WSCPs strongly depend upon their conjugated main chain structures. The WSCPs should possess suitable energy levels to match well with the light-emitting layer (EML), even though the electron injection from metal cathode was efficient. Our results show promising potentials of WSCPs as interface modification layers in organic/polymer optoelectronic devices, and provide new insights for the development of new interface modification materials in the future.

In recent years, water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) have attracted considerable attention due to their promising application potential in organic optoelectronic devices and chemo-/bio-sensors. WSCPs usually comprise π-electron delocalized conjugated main chains and highly polar pendant groups, in which their conjugated main chains control the intrinsic optoelectronic characteristics, and the highly polar pendant groups endow them with good solubility in high polarity solvents. The unique solubility of WSCPs offers them many advantages for applications in optoelectronic devices. For example, WSCPs can be processed from environmental-friendly solvents (such as water, alcohols etc.), which is desirable for industry applications. Moreover, solution-processed multilayer devices, which are critical for a better device performance, can be easily realized by depositing different layers with orthogonal solvents. Most importantly, it has been found that the highly polar pendant groups of WSCPs endow them with excellent interface modification functions. In polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), WSCPs can greatly enhance the electron injection from high work-function metal cathodes, which in turn leads to the realization of high-efficiency all-printable PLEDs. Afterwards, it was demonstrated that WSCPs also worked well as interlayers in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Besides PLEDs and PSCs, WSCPs have also been successfully extended to other optoelectronic devices, such as organic thin film transistors and light-emitting transistors.

For their versatile applications in optoelectronic devices, many efforts have been paid to the development of new WSCPs interlayer materials. Device physics studies on the working mechanism of these materials also have been performed. For examples, many types of highly polar pendant groups (such as cationic, anionic, zwitterionic and neutral highly polar pendant groups) and conjugated main chain building blocks (such as fluorene, carbazole, triphenylamine, thiopheneetc.) have been used to build WSCPs interlayer materials. Device physics studies indicated that the notable interface modification function in PLEDs and PSCs could be attributed to interface dipole formation between the WSCPs interlayer and the electrode, while the movement of the counterions were also found to play an important role on the excellent electron injection properties of conjugated polyelectrolyte-based interlayers in PLEDs. It was proposed that the interface dipole was created by the interaction between the highly polar pendant groups of WSCPs and the electrodes, which also has been observed among non-conjugated polymer surfactant interface materials, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), DNA, and insulating polymers containing simple aliphatic amine groups and so on. However, the understanding of the effect of the main chain on the interface modification functions of WSCPs remains limited. Besides, WSCPs interlayer exhibited some anomalous properties which are different from traditional organic semiconductors. For example, WSCPs with electron-rich main chains (such as polyfluorene, polycarbazole and polythiophene), which have been previously considered as typical p-type semiconductors, behaved very well as interface modification layers for cathodes in PLEDs and for electron-collecting electrodes in PSCs.
Herein, in order to get a better understanding of the effect of the main chain on the interface modification functions of WSCPs, a series of new WSCPs, poly[(9,9-bis((N-(4-sulfonate-1-butyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(N-phenyl-4,4′-diphenylamine)] (PFNSO-TPA), poly[(9,9-bis((N-(4-sulfonate-1-butyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFNSO) and poly[(9,9-bis((N-(4-sulfonate-1-butyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PFNSO-BT), which contain identical pendant zwitterionic groups (sulfobetaines), but different conjugated main chains were designed and synthesized as interface modification materials in PSCs and PLEDs (see Scheme 1a). Zwitterionic groups were used as pendant groups because conjugated zwitterionic polyelectrolytes, which combine the advantages of good interface modification function, mobile-ions-free nature and good water/alcohol solubility simultaneously, are very promising interfacial materials. Among the three resulting WSCPs, PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO have electron-rich main chains and low electron affinities, while PFNSO-BT has an electron-deficient conjugated main chain and an electron affinity as high as that of poly[2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (F8BT). The optical/electrical properties and interface modification functions of the designed WSCPs were investigated. In PSCs, all WSCPs showed efficient modification functions for electron-collecting electrode, and thereby leading to improved performances in solar cells. Based on the highly efficient photovoltaic blend of poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothithieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7) and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (see Scheme 1b), a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.74% was obtained. However, when used as interlayers in PLEDs, the resulting device performances strongly depend on the main chain structures of WSCPs. When green emitter phenyl-substituted poly(phenylenevinylene) (P-PPV) (see Fig. 1b) was used as emitting layer (EML), the PLEDs with electron-deficient PFNSO-BT interlayer exhibited much poorer device performance compared to those devices based on electron-rich PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO interlayers. Further study revealed that PFNSO-BT also exhibited good efficient electron injecting/transporting capability when F8BT was applied as the EML, due to the minimized energy barrier between the EML and PFNSO-BT interlayer. These studies showed that, besides pendant polar groups, the nature of the conjugated backbone is also critical for the development of new interface modification materials in the future for high performance solution processed multilayer organic optoelectronic devices.

The chemical structures and synthetic routes of the target WSCPs are demonstrated in Scheme 2. The diboronic ester monomers (M1, M3 and M4), and dibromide monomers (M2 and M5) were synthesized according to the previously reported methods. The three amino-containing precursor polymers (PFN-TPA, PFN and PFN-BT) were synthesized by common Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling polymerization with equivalent molar ratios of diboronic ester monomer and dibromide monomers. The neutral precursor polymers were readily soluble in chloroform, but cannot be dissolved in highly polar solvents. The chemical structures of the three neutral precursor polymers were verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the standard and chloroform as the eluent are 5.3 kg mol−1 (with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.8) for PFN-TPA, 44.5 kg mol−1 (with a PDI of 2.3) for PFN and 10.5 kg mol−1 (with a PDI of 2.5) for PFN-BT, respectively.

Conversion of the three amino-containing precursor polymers to the resulting zwitterionic WSCPs (PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT) was achieved by treating them with an excess of 1,4-butane sultone in chloroform–methanol solvent mixture under reflux for 5 days in argon atmosphere to guarantee complete quaternization. The chemical conversions from neutral polymers to WSCPs were verified by 1H NMR. The proton signals corresponding to the methyleneamino and methylamino groups (–CH2N and –NCH3) of neutral amino-containing polymers in CDCl3 were located around 2.20–2.03 ppm. After treating with 1,4-butane sultone, all signals for the methylene and methyl adjacent to the nitrogen atoms shift to lower field region (2.99–2.47 ppm). Additionally, the proton signals in the range of 3.19–3.10 ppm corresponding to the methylene adjacent to the sulfonate group (SO3−) emerged. The zwitterionic side chains endow the resulting WSCPs good solubility in high polarity solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), thus offering an opportunity of fabricating multilayer organic optoelectronic devices by solution processing without interface mixing/erosion, since the adjacent organic active layer is usually deposited from non-polar organic solvents. Moreover, the zwitterionic groups on the side chains would afford these polymers good high work-function metal electrodes modification functions. The main differences in chemical structures of the resulting WSCPs are their conjugated main chains. PFNSO-TPA has a typical p-type semiconductor featured conjugated main chain and is the most electron rich among the three WSCPs in this study. PFNSO has also a p-type conjugated main chain as is typical for polyfluorenes, but it is somewhat less electron-rich than PFNSO-TPA. On the contrary, PFNSO-BT possesses an electron-deficient conjugated main chain and a high electron affinity as that of the well known conjugated polymer F8BT. It is worth pointing out that GPC measurements of the resulting WSCPs were not conducted considering the polymer aggregation on the column fillers induced by the ionic groups on the polymer side chains. Nevertheless, it can be reasonably speculated that the resulting WSCPs would have almost unchanged polymerization degrees as their neutral precursor polymers, since the quaternizations were carried out under mild conditions.

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the three resulting WSCPs in the solid state are illustrated in Fig. 1, and relevant data are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectra of PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT peak at 393, 404 and 463 nm, respectively. Noticeably, PFNSO-BT exhibited two distinct absorption bands in the range from 300 to 600 nm, indicating the existence of π–π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer interaction at the same time along PFNSO-BT, due to its push–pull structural feature. As shown in Fig. 1b, PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT exhibited PL peaks at 455, 433 and 558 nm, respectively, in the solid state. It is noted that PFNSO-BT exhibited a pronounced red-shift and much broader PL emission with respect to PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO. The onsets of the absorption spectra of PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT in thin films are at 446, 431 and 521 nm, respectively. The optical band gaps (Eg) of PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT were thus calculated to be 2.78, 2.88 and 2.38 eV, respectively, according to their onsets of the absorption spectra of the polymers in the solid state. Clearly, incorporating different conjugated units drastically changed the band gaps of the resulting WSCPs.

The energy levels of the resulting WSCPs were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using a platinum electrode and an Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode as the work electrode and reference electrode, respectively, in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon atmosphere. The CV curves are presented in Fig. 2. The onset voltages of oxidation process for PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT were observed to be 0.81, 0.89 and 0.96 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT were thus calculated to be −5.29, −5.37 and −5.44 eV, respectively, using the ferrocence value of 4.8 eV below the vacuum as the internal standard. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers were estimated to be −2.51, −2.49 and −3.06 eV for PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT, respectively, from their HOMO energy levels and Eg. The energy levels of the resulting WSCPs were consistent with those of their neutral analogues reported in literature. Clearly, introducing electron-withdrawing BT units onto the polyfluorene main chain effectively reduced both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the resulting polymers. In principle, the deeper LUMO and HOMO energy level of electron-deficient polymer PFNSO-BT would be beneficial for improving its electron-injection/-collecting ability and hole-blocking ability, respectively.

To investigate the electron collecting/transporting properties of the resulting WSCPs, bulk-heterojunction PSCs with device architecture of ITO|PEDOT:PSS|PTB7:PC71BM|interlayer|Al were fabricated and tested. PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from One-material Chemscitech and Aldrich, respectively, and used as received. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P AI4083) was obtained from H.C. Starck Clevios. The chemical structures of PTB7 and PC71BM, as well as the device configuration are shown in Scheme 1b. The 5 nm WSCPs layer was spin-coated on top of a bulk-heterojunction active layer from methanol solution to form an interlayer. For comparison, a control device without interlayer was also fabricated and tested. The J–V curves of the solar cells measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are illustrated in Fig. 3a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters including short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE estimated from J–V curves are listed in Table 2. A typical control device with a bare Al electrode exhibited a PCE of 5.03%, with a Voc of 0.55 V, a Jsc of 16.33 mA cm−2 and an FF of 56.3%, which is consistent with those reported in previous literature. After inserting a thin layer of WSCPs, the resulting PSCs exhibited much enhanced performances, benefiting from the improvements of Voc and FF simultaneously. The PCE values were increased to 7.51, 8.74 and 6.61% for typical PSCs with PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT as interlayer, respectively. The Voc of PSCs was enhanced from 0.55 V for a bare Al device to 0.71 V for PFNSO-TPA|Al device, 0.73 V for PFNSO|Al device and 0.65 V for PFNSO-BT% device, respectively. The FF of PSCs was increased from 56.3% for a bare Al electrode device to 62.1% for PFNSO-TPA|Al device, 73.1% for PFNSO|Al device and 61.1% for PFNSO-BT device, respectively. The changes in Jsc were negligible for the PSCs upon the incorporation of WSCPs as interlayer, agreeing with the previous report in which a neutral WSCP was used to modify the interface between the PTB7-based active layer and the Al electrode. The experimentally measured Jsc values were extremely close to the integrations of corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. S1 in ESI and Table 2). Moreover, the control device involved the deposition of methanol on top of active layer followed by a sequence of steps identical to those for the WSCPs devices also fabricated and tested to rule out possible influences caused by methanol solvent. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, the methanol-treated devices delivered increased Voc and FF values, and thereby higher PCEs. Nevertheless, the enhancements were not as high as those of WSCPs-modified devices. Hence, the enhancement in performances after WSCPs deposition should be due to the combined effects of methanol and WSCPs themselves. The statistical data (average values and standard deviations) of photovoltaic performances calculated from seven devices for each kind of PSCs are also listed in Table 2, which proved that the enhancements of device performances upon WSCPs deposition were statistically effective and reproducible.

It is interesting that the three WSCPs showed different interface modification capacities. Especially, PFNSO-BT showed relative poor interface modification functions among the three WSCPs, which was contradictory to our initial expectation. The device with a PFNSO-BT interlay demonstrated a Voc of 0.65 V, which is significantly lower than those of the devices with the other two WSCPs interlayer (0.71–0.73 V). According to the J–V characteristics of the devices acquired in the dark (Fig. 3b), the device with PFNSO-BT interlayer showed a turn-on voltage of about 0.7 V, while it is about 0.9 V for the PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO devices. This suggests that the built-in potential across the device, which is the upper limit of the attainable Voc in PSC, of the PFNSO-BT device is lower than those of PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO devices. In the range from 0.3 to 0.9 V, the leakage current of PFNSO-BT device was much higher than those of the other two WSCPs-based devices, agreeing with the relative low FF of the PFNSO-BT device. It should also be noted that the PFNSO-based device showed lowest leakage current in the range from 0.3 to 0.9 V and smallest series resistance (Rs) of 4.4 Ω cm2 (Table 2), leading to highest Voc and FF.
To get a more insightful understanding on the enhancements of device performances upon the incorporation of WSCPs, the apparent charge transporting abilities of the devices upon the incorporation of WSCPs were evaluated by measuring J–V characteristics of single charge carrier devices and fitting the results using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S2, ESI). Apparent hole mobilities of 4.2 × 10−5, 3.6 × 10−5, 1.0 × 10−3, 1.1 × 10−3 and 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been determined for the bare Al device, methanol-rinsed devices, and the devices with PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-TPA interlayer, respectively. Apparent electron mobilities of 2.9 × 10−4, 2.1 × 10−4, 2.2 × 10−4, 2.2 × 10−4 and 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been determined for the bare Al device, methanol-rinsed devices, and the devices with PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-TPA interlayer, respectively. In other words, all WSCPs can enhance apparent hole mobilities across the devices, but have little influence on electron mobilities of the devices. Note that similar phenomena were also observed in PSCs with a neutral WSCP interlayer. The increased apparent hole mobilities upon the incorporation of WSCPs may contribute to the FF improvement of the devices.
The surface morphologies of PTB7:PC71BM layers upon the deposition of WSCPs were tracked by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S3, ESI). The surface of PTB7:PC71BM was relatively smooth and homogeneous, with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.835 nm. The methanol-rinsed surface remained smooth (RMS roughness of 1.814 nm) and homogeneous. After the incorporation of WSCPs on top of PTB7:PC71BM, the surfaces were slightly rougher but were still homogeneous, with RMS roughness of 2.258, 2.245 and 2.254 nm for the surfaces covered with PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT, respectively. Clearly, the surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM layers after the deposition of different WSCPs have similar roughness and morphologies, suggesting that the terminal zwitterionic groups endow the three resulting WSCPs with similar film-formation abilities and similar miscibilities with the PTB7:PC71BM layer, in spite of their different conjugated main chains. Moreover, zwitterionic WSCPs would be better candidates as cathode interlayers in practical application of PSCs compared to traditional cationic or anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes, taking into account their mobile ion free nature.

To investigate the electron injecting/transporting properties of the resulting WSCPs in PLEDs, multilayer PLEDs with the device configuration of ITO|PEDOT:PSS|P-PPV|interlayer|Al were fabricated and tested, where the efficient green emitter P-PPV (see Scheme 1b) was purchased from Canton OLEDKING Optoelectronic Materials Co. Lit. PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT with thickness of 10 nm processed from methanol solutions were used as the cathode interlayer, respectively. For comparison, a bare Al cathode control device, and the device prepared from the washing of methanol on top of the emissive layer (EML) followed by a sequence of steps identical to those for the WSCPs devices were also fabricated. Fig. 4a compares current density (J) and brightness (L) vs. voltage (V) characteristics between both the control devices and the devices using different Al cathode interlayers, and Fig. 4b demonstrates the luminance efficiency (LE) vs. J characteristics of the devices. Relevant device parameters are summarized in Table 3. Fig. S4 (ESI) demonstrates the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the PLEDs. All PLED devices exhibited similar EL spectra, indicating that recombination zones are all inside the P-PPV layer and there is no energy transfer between the EML and the WSCPs interlayer. Clearly, the bare Al cathode device demonstrated very poor performance with a LE of 0.17 cd A−1 and a luminance of 66 cd m−2 at a current density around 35 mA cm−2, due to the poor electron injection from the Al cathode to P-PPV. By using the most electron rich PFNSO-TPA as Al cathode interlayer, the device exhibited a more than 20 times increased LE of 6.1 cd A−1 and luminance of 2343 cd m−2 at a current density around 35 mA cm−2 compared with the bare Al cathode device. The turn-on voltage (Von) of the device was also drastically decreased from 8.8 V for the bare Al cathode device to 3.1 V for the PFNSO-TPA|Al cathode device. Moreover, the PFNSO|Al device exhibited a somewhat better performance than the PFNSO-TPA|Al device. The PFNSO|Al device showed a LE of 10.8 cd A−1 and a luminance of 3882 cd m−2 at a similar current density, which is 40 times higher than that of the bare Al cathode device. The maximum brightness of PFNSO-TPA|Al and PFNSO|Al devices reached 4183 and 5700 cd m−2, respectively, which is much higher than that obtained from the bare Al device (950 cd m−2). Furthermore, Von for the PFNSO|Al device was decreased to 2.8 V. Notably, the performances of the PFNSO|Al device were even comparable to those of a Ba|Al device. These results clearly indicate that the electron injection barrier of the Al cathode in PLEDs could be effectively decreased and thereby the electron injection from the Al cathode to the P-PPV emission layer could be effectively improved by using p-type WSCPs as cathode interlayer, which is also consistent with literature reports. Interestingly, PFNSO-BT, which possesses an electron-deficient main chain and high electron affinity, similar to that of F8BT, exhibited unexpectedly poor electron injecting/transporting ability. The PFNSO-BT|Al cathode device only delivered a LE of 0.5 cd A−1 and a luminance of 175 cd m−2 at a current density of 35 mA cm−2, which were close to those of a bare Al cathode device and methanol-washed control device. Moreover, the PFNSO-BT|Al cathode device exhibited the slowest brightness increase in L–V characteristic with highest Von of 4.8 V, which is close to that of methanol-washed control device. Besides, the LE–J characteristic also proved that PFNSO-BT|Al cathode device delivered the poorest performance.

Since all of the resulting WSCPs (PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT) contain identical zwitterionic groups on side chains, the differences of their interface modification functions should be attributed to their different conjugated main chain structures. To get a more in-depth understanding of these phenomena, photovoltaic measurements were conducted to determine the built-in potential across the devices. It is widely accepted that the formation of a positive dipole in the metal cathode–EML interface due to the interaction between the polar groups on the polymers and the high work-function metals, and consequently leading to the decrease of the electron injection barrier, is the main work mechanism of WSCPs as cathode interlayer in PLEDs.Voc, which corresponds to the built-in potential across the junction and the electrodes, can be used to reflect this change in PLEDs. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, Voc increased from approximately 1.35 V for the bare Al cathode device and methanol-washed device to approximately 1.55 V for the PFNSO-TPA|Al cathode device, and further to 1.75 V for the PFNSO|Al cathode device. These results indicated the decrease of the barrier height for electron injection and thereby leading to a more balanced injection of electrons and holes in related PLEDs by incorporating a thin layer of electron-rich WSCPs (PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO). Obviously, the observation in Voc persuasively explains the improvement of device performances of PFNSO-TPA|Al cathode device and PFNSO|Al cathode device with respect to that of the bare Al cathode device. The insertion of PFNSO-BT between Al cathode and EML also led to increased Voc (1.5 V), although the enhancement was somewhat less significant than those of the PFNSO-TPA|Al and PFNSO|Al devices. It is indicative that the electron injection barrier between Al electrode and EML can be decreased by inserting a thin layer of PFNSO-BT. Thus, there are some other factors that restrict the performance of PFNSO-BT|Al devices.
One possible reason for the poor device performance of PFNSO-BT is that the electron injection from PFNSO-BT layer to P-PPV layer was impeded, although the electron injection from the Al electrode to the PFNSO-BT layer was efficient. As shown in Scheme 3, the energy barrier between LUMO energy levels of P-PPV and PFNSO-BT is 0.26 eV, while there is no energy barrier for electron injection from the PFNSO-TPA layer or PFNSO layer to the P-PPV layer. It was thus speculated that PFNSO-BT would also be a good electron injection material for PLEDs that use materials with deeper LUMO levels as EML. To verify this hypothesis, F8BT, which possesses an identical conjugated main chain and similar energy levels as that of PFNSO-BT, was used as EML to fabricate PLED devices with different interlayers. F8BT was synthesized in our lab. Clearly, there is no energy barrier for electron injection from the PFNSO-BT layer to the F8BT layer (see Scheme 3) since they have the same conjugated main chains. The J–L–V characteristics and LE–J characteristics of F8BT-based PLEDs using different WSCPs as interlayer and control devices are demonstrated in Fig. 6. Relevant device parameters are listed in Table 4.

As we expected, all the WSCPs exhibited effective interfacial functions. At a current density of 35 mA cm−2, the bare Al electrode device and methanol-washed devices exhibited LE of 0.16 and 0.041 cd A−1, and luminance of 68 and 15 cd cm−2, respectively. After inserting WSCPs as Al cathode interlayer, the resulting PLED devices exhibited substantially decreased Von of 2.8 V for all WSCPs. At similar current density, the LE was enhanced to 1.88 cd A−1 for the PFNSO-TPA|Al device, 3.28 cd A−1 for the PFNSO|Al device, and 2.23 cd A−1 for the PFNSO-BT|Al device, respectively. Clearly, the performances of PLEDs using F8BT as EML were increased more than two orders of magnitude after the insertion of WSCPs as Al cathode interlayer, whether the WSCPs have electron-rich or -deficient main chains. The photovoltaic measurements also confirmed the effective interfacial functions of all the WSCPs when the energy barrier between the EML and cathode interlayer can be eliminated. As shown in Fig. 7, Voc was increased from approximately 1.2 V for the bare Al cathode device and methanol-washed device to around 1.7 V for WSCPs modified devices, indicating all WSCPs were beneficial for enhancing the built-in potential across the PLED devices and thereby for achieving more balanced injection of electrons and holes in PLEDs. In short, it was found that PFNSO-BT can also serve as an effective cathode interlayer in PLEDs, if the energy barrier between cathode interlayer and EML can be eliminated. These results indicate that the energy barrier between EML and cathode interlayer is also a critical factor that should be considered for the development of new interface modification materials for PLEDs in the future.

In conclusion, a series of new WSCPs (PFNSO-TPA, PFNSO and PFNSO-BT), comprising identical sulfobetaine zwitterionic groups on the side chains but different conjugated main chains were designed and developed as electrode interfacial materials to improve the electron collecting/transporting and electron injection/transporting in PSCs and PLEDs, respectively. The chemical structures, optical properties and energy levels of the WSCPs were characterized in detail. The resulting WSCPs possess the integrated advantages of excellent alcohol solubility and mobile-ion-free nature, which are desirable for fabricating efficient and stable organic optoelectronic devices by an orthogonal solution processing method. The relationships between the polymer main chain structure and interface modification functions were systematically investigated in bulk-heterojunction PSCs and fluorescent PLEDs. In PSCs, it was found that the WSCPs interface modification properties led to small differences, but all of them can boost the photovoltaic performances of PSCs. Encouragingly, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.74% was achieved. However, considerable differences of interface modification functions were observed when the WSCPs were employed as cathode interlayers in PLEDs. It was found that the electron-deficient PFNSO-BT, which possesses the same conjugated main chain as F8BT and high electron affinity, exhibited negligible electron injecting/transporting function in PLEDs when P-PPV was used as EML. Nevertheless, PFNSO-BT, in addition to PFNSO-TPA and PFNSO also exhibited efficient electron injecting/transporting function in PLEDs when the material with deeper LUMO was used as EML, due to the elimination of the energy barrier between the EML and cathode interlayer. Our study suggested that the selection of conjugated main chains, in addition to pendant polar groups and/or counterions, is also critical for the development of interfacial materials for high performance solution processed multilayer organic optoelectronic devices in the future.
