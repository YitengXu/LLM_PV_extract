The current Si-based photovoltaic devices require high-quality raw materials and intricate processing techniques to construct complex device structures; further improvement in efficiency and a drastic decrease in cost are thus highly desired to promote their extensive applications. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study on high-efficiency graphene/Si nanoarray Schottky junction solar cells. Besides the Si nanowire (SiNW) array, a Si nanohole (SiNH) array was first used for the device construction since it showed the advantages in terms of larger effective junction area while enhanced light absorption is retained. It was found that surface charge recombination as well as graphene conductivity and work function played important roles in determining the solar cell performance. By suppressing the surface recombination with appropriate surface passivation, together with the careful control of the graphene layer number and the doping level, we found that the device performance can be significantly improved. Eventually, by inserting a thin conducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron blocking layer between Si nanoarrays and graphene films, maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.71% and 10.30% were demonstrated for the devices based on SiNW and SiNH arrays, respectively, as a result of reduced carrier recombination in the anode. The PCEs demonstrated in this work are the highest values achieved thus far for the graphene/Si nanoarray solar cells. The present results suggest great potential of the graphene/Si nanoarrays as high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic devices.

Graphene based transparent electrodes have attracted considerable attention due to their extraordinary properties superior to the conventional transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxide (ITO) in terms of higher transmittance, better mechanical flexibility, and lower sheet resistance. By combining silicon (Si) and graphene, a new type of Schottky junction solar cell has recently been developed. In such a device, sunlight could easily penetrate the graphene film and reach the Schottky junction, and the electron–hole pairs excited in Si are separated by the built-in electric field, resulting in photocurrent. Evidently, the use of the graphene/Si Schottky structure can avoid the complex fabrication process for Si p–n/p–i–n junction formation in the traditional Si solar cells, and also facilitate light absorption as well as carrier separation and transport. Therefore, graphene/Si hybrid solar cells may offer a new strategy for fabricating low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Much attention has been paid to the study of graphene/Si Schottky solar cells. For instance, Li et al. reported the few-layer graphene (FLG)/planar Si Schottky junction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.65%, and the PCE was enhanced to 4.35% by employing the graphene doped with HNO3. Graphene/planar Si solar cells were also studied by Miao and co-workers and showed an efficiency up to 8.6%. Oxidation of the Si surface and modification of graphene with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TFSA) were suggested to be the keys to improving the device performance.

It is known that Si nanostructure arrays have much enhanced light absorption capability owing to the strong light trapping effect; 5–10 μm thick Si nanoarrays are capable of absorbing most of the incident light. Recent progress also demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the Si nanoarrays from the growth/etching substrate to foreign flexible substrates. Therefore, there is great potential to fabricate light-weight and high-efficiency flexible solar cells from the Si nanoarrays. In light of this, solar cells based on graphene/Si nanostructure arrays have been intensively investigated recently. Fan et al. demonstrated a PCE of 2.86% from FLG/Si nanowire (SiNW) array solar cells. Feng et al. further investigated the solar cells based on the Si-pillar-array and revealed an efficiency of up to 4.35%. We also illustrated that the efficiency of monolayer graphene (MLG)/SiNW array solar cells could be increased to 2.15% by filling the interspace of SiNW arrays with graphene suspension. In addition, our work on graphene nanoribbon (NR)/multiple SiNW junctions also showed an efficiency of 1.47%. However, it is worth noting that the small effective Schottky junction areas (the flat graphene films only contact with the tips of SiNWs), the strong surface carrier recombination due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of Si nanostructures, and the low sheet conductivity of graphene were considered the major factors that limit the performance of the graphene/Si nanoarray solar cells and further optimization of the devices is much demanded.
Herein, we report the construction and systematic device evaluation of graphene/Si nanoarray (SiNW and Si nanohole (SiNH)) Schottky junction solar cells. SiNH arrays were first used since they can enable much larger effective junction area and better support to the graphene film as compared with SiNW arrays, while retaining the capability of high light absorption. Through surface passivation with methyl-termination and additional Pt nanodots (PtNDs) modification, charge recombination velocity at the Si nanoarray surface was shown to reduce remarkably, leading to a substantial improvement in device performance. The effects of the graphene layer number as well as the doping level of graphene sheets were revealed. Eventually, by coating the Si nanoarrays with a thin poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) layer, which served as an electron blocking layer, the carrier recombination at the junction interface was further suppressed and a maximum PCE of over 10% was obtained for the graphene/Si nanoarray solar cells. Our results demonstrate that the graphene/Si nanoarray structures have great potential for low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell applications.

Vertically aligned SiNW arrays were prepared uniformly over a large-area by using an Ag-assisted chemical etching method. Briefly, an n-type Si wafer (1.5 × 1.5 cm2, resistivity 4–7 Ω cm−1, and thickness 500 μm) with a 300 nm thick SiO2 insulating layer was used as the substrate. The surface of the SiO2/Si substrate was first protected by adhesive tape with an opening window of 2 × 2 mm2, which defined the effective work area of the solar cell. The SiO2 insulating layer within the window was then removed by the buffered oxide etch (BOE) solution. Afterwards, the substrate was immersed in an aqueous solution of HF (5 M) and AgNO3 (0.02 M) for 15 min at room temperature. The SiNW array was fabricated in the window region through chemical etching and the length of SiNWs could be rationally controlled by adjusting the etching time. After cleaning in deionized water for 5 min, the SiNW array was then dipped into a diluted HNO3 solution to dissolve residual silver.


SiNH arrays were prepared in an electrolyte solution of HF: C2H5OH with the volume fraction of 2:1 via electrochemical etching. Similar to the synthesis of SiNW arrays, a SiO2 (300 nm)/n-Si (resistivity 4–7 Ω cm−1) substrate with a 2 × 2 mm2 opening window was used. After etching at 40 mA current for 4 min in the electrolyte solution, the substrate was taken out and then dipped into a diluted NaOH solution (5 M) for 15 s to remove the amorphous Si layer formed on the inner walls of SiNHs.


The hydrogen-terminated Si (denoted as H-Si) nanoarrays were obtained by immersing the as-prepared SiNW and SiNH arrays into an aqueous HF (5 M) solution with gentle shaking for 10 min, followed by cleaning in deionized water for 1 min. The H-Si nanoarrays were then dried by a stream of nitrogen gas and immediately transferred into a glovebox. As for the preparation of methyl terminated Si (denoted as CH3-Si) nanoarrays, a two-step process was employed according to the previous reports. Firstly, the H–SiNW and H–SiNH arrays were immersed in a saturated PCl5 solution in chlorobenzene for 50 min at 90 ± 10 °C under N2 protection in the glovebox to transform the Si–H bonds to Si–Cl bonds. The Cl-terminated Si nanoarrays were then rinsed sequentially with chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran three times. Then the nanoarrays were treated with CH3MgCl (1 M) solution in tetrahydrofuran for at least 8 h at 70 ± 10 °C and rinsed with tetrahydrofuran. The CH3-termination was formed in this process. After removing from the glovebox, the nanoarrays were further dipped in deionized water for 10 min, and rinsed sequentially with acetone and ethanol. In order to deposit PtNDs on the surface, the Si nanoarrays were submerged in an electrolyte consisting of H2PtCl6 (5 mM) and LiClO4 (100 mM) in ethanol. A Pt plate was employed as the counter electrode. A bias voltage of 0.8 V was applied between the Si substrate and the Pt electrode for 3 min, and PtNDs were uniformly coated on the surface of Si nanoarrays. In this work, a P3HT conductive polymer layer was adopted as the blocking layer for preventing the electrons transport from the Si side to graphene and consequently reducing the carrier recombination in the anode. P3HT was first dissolved in chlorobenzene (2.5 mg ml−1) and then spin-coated onto the Si nanoarrays at 3000 rpm for 1 min. After that, the Si nanoarrays were baked in a nitrogen protection environment at 150 °C for 30 min.


The large-area MLG films were prepared at 1000 °C by using a mixed gas of CH4 (40 sccm) and H2 (20 sccm) by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method with 25 μm thick Cu foil as the catalytic substrate. After growth, the MLG films were spin-coated with 5 wt% polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in chlorobenzene, and then the underlying Cu foil was removed in Marble's reagent solution (CuSO4–HCl–H2O = 10 g:50 ml:50 ml). The resulting MLG films were cleaned in deionized water for 5 min.


The morphologies of Si nanoarrays were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI/Quanta 200 FEG). The structures of P3HT-coated SiNWs were detected using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). The components of P3HT-coated Si nanoarrays were analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attached to TEM and SEM. The absorption spectra of the Si nanoarrays and the transmittance of the FLG films with different stacking layer numbers were detected by a spectrometer (PerkinElmer/Lambda 750) equipped with an integrating sphere. The MLG films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Jobin Yvon/Labram HR800) with a laser (wavelength 633 nm) beam size of 2 μm. The sheet resistances of FLG films were measured by a digital four-probe tester (JG/ST-2258A).


To construct the graphene/Si nanoarray Schottky junction solar cells, the Ti/Au (5 nm/50 nm) electrode, which served as the electrical contact for graphene, was first deposited on the SiO2/Si substrate via high-vacuum electron-beam evaporation. Then, the PMMA-supported MLG films were directly transferred onto the top of Si nanoarrays. After drying at 100 °C for 10 min, the residual PMMA on the MLG film was removed by acetone. This process could be repeated several times to fabricate the device with the FLG film. In this work, FLG films consisting of 1–5 MLG layers were fabricated to evaluate the effects of the graphene layer number on device performance. The indium–gallium (In–Ga) alloy was then pasted on the rear side of the Si substrate to achieve ohmic contact to the substrate. The photovoltaic characteristics of the graphene/Si nanoarray Schottky junction solar cells were evaluated using a Keithley 2612 source meter in the ambient environment. A Newport 91160 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used to generate simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The irradiation intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a Newport standard Si solar cell 91150.


N-type SiNW arrays utilized in this work have a NW length of ∼10 μm and a diameter of tens to hundreds of nm (Fig. 1a), and the SiNH arrays are typically several hundreds of nm in hole diameter, and ∼10 μm in hole depth (Fig. 1b). As compared with the planar Si, both the SiNW and SiNH arrays exhibit much higher light absorption in the wavelength range from 400 to 1200 nm (Fig. 1c). The absorbance of the SiNH array is close to that of the SiNW array in the visible light range, while it is even higher in the near-infrared range. Previous work suggested that the existence of surface states could enhance the near-infrared absorption of Si nanostructures. From Fig. 1a and b, it is clear that the side walls of the SiNHs are much rougher than the surface of SiNWs. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the enhanced absorption of the SiNH array in the near-infrared range is attributed to the denser surface states on it. The Raman spectrum taken on the MLG film is mainly composed of two sharp peaks (Fig. 1d), i.e., a 2D-band peak at ∼2695 cm−1 and a G-band peak at ∼1583 cm−1. The intensity ratio of I2D:IG ≈ 3, along with the weak D-band scattering at ∼1345 cm−1, indicates a high crystal quality of the MLG film.



Fig. 2a shows the schematic illustration of a typical graphene/SiNW array solar cell. Notably, the device exhibits excellent rectifying behavior by virtue of the formation of a Schottky junction between the pristine MLG film and the H–SiNW array, as shown in Fig. 2b. From the low-magnification SEM in the inset of Fig. 2b, the area of the SiNW array covered by the MLG film has a darker contrast. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the device shows pronounced photovoltaic characteristics with open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of 0.16 V, 1.38 mA cm−2, 0.358, and 0.08%, respectively. HNO3 doping on graphene is widely used to improve its p-type conductivity. Therefore, in this work, the device was exposed to HNO3 vapor for 3 min to dope the MLG film. After doping, the device shows a better performance with VOC of 0.25 V, JSC of 5.09 mA cm−2, FF of 0.366, and PCE of 0.47%. We note that the HNO3 doping not only contributes to a higher JSC, but also results in a larger VOC because the work function of the MLG film can be increased by about 0.13 eV after HNO3 doping. Although the device performance has been significantly improved after doping, it is still lower than those previously reported and hard to meet the requirements for practical applications. The severe surface carrier recombination arising from the large surface-to-volume ratio of the SiNWs is considered to be an important reason. In fact, it is reported that the H-Si surface has a high surface recombination velocity up to 500 ± 140 cm s−1. To address this issue, the SiNW surface was further terminated with methyl groups to decrease the surface recombination velocity in this study because of the low recombination velocity of 45 ± 7 cm s−1 for the methyl-terminated Si.Fig. 2d shows the photovoltaic characteristics of the device fabricated from the CH3–SiNW array, revealing a remarkable improvement in the device performance. JSC increased to ∼5.56 and ∼10.85 mA cm−2 for the CH3–SiNW array before and after MLG doping, respectively. Correspondingly, the PCE value further increased to ∼0.42% before HNO3 doping and ∼1.01% after doping, manifesting the importance of the surface passivation for improving device performance.

Conductivity and work function of graphene are important factors that limit the performance of graphene/Si solar cells. Although graphene should in principle have higher conductivity than ITO, the difficulty in obtaining large-area single crystal graphene and the existence of grain boundaries and defects in the graphene films usually lead to inferior conductivity of graphene sheets. While the MLG allows a high light transmission into the junction, it has a large series resistance for effective carrier transport. On the other hand, the MLG possesses a work function in the range of 4.5–4.7 eV, which is much lower than ITO (5.1 eV) and may lead to a low junction barrier with n-Si. However, by taking advantage of FLG films, conductivity as well as work function of graphene could be effectively improved. In light of this, the role of the graphene layer number in the device performance was further studied. Fig. 3a plots the relation of the FLG/CH3–SiNW device performance as a function of the FLG layer number. It is seen that the device performance improves with the increase of the MLG layer number, and an optimized layer number of 4 is revealed. This result is in good agreement with previous investigation on the organic solar cells with stacked graphene films as anodes. The increase in FF and JSC could be attributed to the increased sheet conductivity of the FLG film, as shown in Fig. S1a in ESI. The sheet resistance of MLG is 590 Ω sq−1 and 397 Ω sq−1 before and after HNO3 doping, respectively, in contrast to 179 Ω sq−1 and 102 Ω sq−1, respectively, for 4-layer FLG. In the meantime, VOC increases from 0.31 V for the MLG to 0.43 V for the 4-layer FLG because the work function of the FLG films prepared by the layer-by-layer transfer tends to increase as the layer number increases. It is also noted that the device performance starts to decline when the layer number is higher than 5, which should be a result of the reduced optical transparency of thicker FLG films. From Fig. S1b in ESI, it is seen that the transmittance of a MLG film is higher than 95%, while it is lower than 82% for a 5-layer FLG film. The PCE of the device with a 4-layer pristine FLG is about 1.15%, which is nearly 3 times that with a MLG film. After doping with HNO3 vapor (Fig. 3b), the devices can maintain the same tendency as that before doping; however, the PCE for the 4-layer FLG device is further enhanced by about 3 times to ∼3.38% (Fig. 3c). From the above observations, it is clear that both the layer number and the HNO3 doping play important roles in determining the sheet conductivity as well as the work function of graphene and consequently the device performance.
To further assess the effect of HNO3 doping, the device performance of the 4-layer FLG/CH3–SiNW array was evaluated at varied HNO3 doping time, as shown in Fig. 3d. It is revealed that JSC and PCE increase immediately after 1 min doping, and reach their maximums for 3–4 min doping. However, further prolonging the doping time leads to a slight decrease in the performance, which might be due to the destruction of the –CH3 surface passivation layer by the strong acid.
Although the –CH3 surface passivation is demonstrated to be highly effective to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the graphene/SiNW array solar cells, the –CH3 modification can hardly provide full coverage to the SiNW array surface and many pinholes may be left. As a result, the surface recombination can still take place at the pinhole areas. In previous reports, Pt nuclei only formed via electrochemical deposition at the hole parts (uncovered parts) in the attached organic layer on alkyl- or methyl-modified n-Si. By replacing the hydrogen bonds with PtNDs in the pinhole areas, the velocity of surface recombination can be further decreased. In light of this, additional PtNDs modification on the surface of the CH3–SiNW array was carried out to ensure effective passivation of the pinhole areas, as shown in Fig. 4a. Significantly, the solar cell based on the CH3(Pt)–SiNW array with the 4-layer FLG film exhibited much better photovoltaic performance; VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE increased to 0.45 V, 20.81 mA cm−2, 0.464, and 4.34%, respectively, before HNO3 doping, while these parameters were further enhanced to 0.48 V, 23.50 mA cm−2, 0.607, and 6.85%, respectively, after HNO3 doping for 3 min.
To further understand the underlying physical mechanism of the device performance enhancement by surface modification, Fig. 4b illustrates the energy band diagram of the graphene/SiNW Schottky junction with different Si surface modifications. It is known that surface modification can remarkably change the surface electron affinity of SiNWs. The offset of surface electron affinity for the CH3–SiNWs and CH3(Pt)–SiNWs could be as high as +0.35 and +0.65 eV, respectively, while it is −0.12 eV for the H–SiNWs with respect to the SiNWs without surface modifications. Therefore, the built-in electric field was greatly strengthened in the CH3(Pt)–SiNW array device, as compared with the H–SiNW array device. This suggestion is consistent with our experiment results; the CH3(Pt)–SiNW array exhibits the highest VOC value of 0.45 V among the devices tested before HNO3 doping (Table 1). On the other hand, the surface energy band bending caused by the –CH3 and PtNDs modifications can also enhance the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the radial direction of SiNWs; the holes will accumulate on the NW surface while electrons in the NW core, preventing the carrier recombination. As a result, the lifetime of the minority carrier (holes) in the SiNWs will be remarkably prolonged, giving rise to an increased photocurrent.

The graphene/SiNW array solar cells show a PCE of up to 6.85% upon structure optimization, which is significantly higher than previous results. Nevertheless, when we look into the device structures of graphene/SiNW array solar cells, it is seen that the graphene film can only come into contact with the tips of SiNWs. Since the total area of the SiNW tips is estimated to be only ∼40% of the whole Si substrate surface area, the effective junction area for electron–hole pair separation is small. In addition, the top surface of the SiNW array is not even and the SiNWs tend to aggregate together at the tips, which may result in a poor contact of the graphene film with the SiNW array and consequently a low JSC for the device. On the basis of these considerations, SiNH arrays instead of SiNW arrays were constructed as well in this work. The graphene/Si contact area for the SiNH array is increased to ∼70% of the whole surface area of the Si substrate. As shown in Fig. 1c, the SiNH arrays have comparable or even higher light absorption as compared with SiNW arrays. Moreover, in contrast to the SiNW arrays, in which NWs are fragile and easily cracked, the SiNH arrays also possess superior mechanical robustness. Fig. 5a shows the schematic illustration of a graphene/SiNH array solar cell, which has the same configuration as that of the SiNW array counterpart. From Fig. 5b, it is noted that the graphene/SiNH array also exhibits excellent rectifying behavior in the dark, similar to that of the graphene/SiNW array device. By systemically examining the effects of HNO3 doping, surface modification, and layer number of the FLG film on the device performance (Fig. 5c and d and 6), it is found that most of the experiences gained from the FLG/SiNW array devices could be applied to the FLG/SiNH array counterparts. The 4-layer FLG/CH3–SiNH array shows an optimized performance of VOC 0.45 V, JSC 38.79 mA cm−2, FF 0.438, and PCE 7.65% after HNO3 doping (Fig. 6a). We note that JSC in this device is remarkably higher than that in the SiNW array counterpart, and is very close to the best value (42.7 mA cm−2) achieved on the conventional single crystalline Si solar cells. The substantial increase in JSC could be attributed to the enlarged effective junction area of the SiNH array.

In Fig. 6b, however, it is noted that surface modification of SiNH arrays with PtNDs results in a deterioration of device performance. In this case, the PtNDs have a large chance to be modified on the top surface of the SiNH array and then directly come into contact with the graphene film. The formation of graphene/PtNDs/Si contact may decrease the Schottky barrier height between graphene and the SiNH array, leading to a large current leakage (ESI, Fig. S2a) and consequently small VOC and JSC. In contrast, for the SiNW array, the graphene film only is in contact with the tips of SiNWs and therefore much fewer PtNDs exist at the graphene/SiNWs interface. The strong built-in electric field for the CH3(Pt)–SiNW array can even lead to a reduction of the leakage current (ESI, Fig. S2b), being opposite to the case of the CH3(Pt)–SiNH array. Although the modification with PtNDs seems to not work well for the SiNH arrays, the larger effective junction area of SiNH with the graphene film and the resulting high JSC still guarantee their improved device performance.

The stability of a solar cell is critical for its practical applications. In this work, we further studied the stability of the graphene/Si nanoarray devices by storing them in air and then detecting their performances again after one week. The results are summarized in Table 2. Notably, the devices do not exhibit any visible degeneration after one week, revealing the sound stability of the graphene/Si nanoarray solar cells.

Fig. 7a illustrates the energy band diagram of the graphene/Si nanoarray solar cells. A built-in electric field is created by the Schottky barrier to separate the photogenerated electron and hole pairs in Si nanoarrays to yield a photocurrent (solid lines in Fig. 7a). In addition, it represents a barrier to electrons so that the recombination at graphene (anode) is reduced (dashed line in Fig. 7a). However, we note that the Schottky barrier height (Φb) is relatively low (∼0.6 eV) for the graphene/Si junction. This may result in a large current leakage and consequently a high reverse-bias saturation current density. The attendant results are the decrease of VOC,JSC as well as FF because of the small value of shunt resistance in the circuit, hindering the promotion of PCEs. In this work, a thin P3HT layer was employed to serve as the effective electron blocking layer between graphene and Si nanoarrays. P3HT layers were spin-coated onto the surfaces of the Si nanoarrays, forming an inorganic–organic core–shell structure, as disclosed by the TEM/SEM investigations (Fig. 8, S3 and S4 in ESI). The strong C signals at the top and side surfaces of the SiNW/SiNH arrays verify the uniform coating of P3HT layers on the nanoarrays. The thickness of the P3HT layer is optimized to be 10 nm to facilitate the effective transport of holes from Si to graphene. From the energy band diagram of the graphene/P3HT/Si nanoarray shown in Fig. 7b, it is seen that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, 3.2 eV) of P3HT is much higher than the conduction band minimum (EC) of Si (4.05 eV), while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, 5.1 eV) is very close to the valence band maximum (EV) of Si (5.17 eV). Therefore, the EC-LUMO offset could present a large barrier for electron transportation from Si to the anode, confining the electrons in Si. Meanwhile, the small EV-HOMO offset presents a negligible barrier, which would not block the traveling of photogenerated holes form Si to the graphene anode. Fig. 9a and c display the schematic illustrations of the graphene/P3HT/SiNW array solar cell and the graphene/P3HT/SiNH array solar cell, respectively. As expected, dark current versus voltage (I–V) tests indeed revealed the reduction of the current leakage due to the existence of a P3HT blocking layer (ESI, Fig. S5). Photovoltaic characteristics of the 4-layer FLG/P3HT/CH3(Pt)–SiNW array and 4-layer FLG/P3HT/CH3–SiNH array solar cells are depicted in Fig. 9b and d, respectively, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Notably, with the aid of a P3HT electron blocking layer, the PCE of the 4-layer FLG/CH3(Pt)–SiNW array solar cell was remarkably enhanced from 6.85% to 8.71%, while the PCE of the 4-layer FLG/CH3–SiNH array solar cell was enhanced from 7.65% to 10.30% after HNO3 doping. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 10.30% is the highest value reported for the graphene-based solar cells to date. This value is also higher than that previously reported on the P3HT/SiNWs hybrid solar cells (5.9%), in which metallic electrodes such as Cu were usually used as the transparent anodes. The low optical transmittance of the metallic electrodes could be responsible for the lower efficiency. This speculation is also confirmed by the measurements on the P3HT/SiNW(SiNH) array hybrid heterojunction solar cells (ESI, Fig. S6), in which graphene films were replaced by 13 nm Au. As expected, lower efficiencies of 5.53% and 7.14% were investigated for the SiNW and SiNH based hybrid solar cells, respectively. On the other hand, graphene/Si solar cells based on planar Si were also studied for comparison, as shown in Fig. S7 in ESI. We note that the graphene/planar Si solar cells exhibit inferior performance compared to their Si nanoarray counterparts. The above results unambiguously demonstrate the important roles of the Si nanoarrays as well as graphene in achieving high-efficiency heterojunction solar cells. It is expected that the performance of the graphene/Si nanoarray solar cells could be further enhanced by means of passivating/modifying the Si nanoarray surface with more efficient methods, increasing the effective Schottky junction area, and reducing the sheet resistance of the graphene layer and so on.


In summary, we demonstrated two types of high-efficiency graphene/Si nanoarray Schottky junction solar cells in this work. Devices based on SiNH arrays were illustrated to be superior to those built on SiNWs in terms of larger effective junction area at the comparable light absorption capability. By performing appropriate surface passivation/modification on the Si nanoarrays, together with the careful control of the graphene layer number and the doping time, maximum PCE values of 8.71% and 10.30% were achieved for the SiNW array and SiNH array based photovoltaic devices, respectively. The devices also exhibited excellent stability in air and remained stable after one week's storage in air. Owing to the simple device architecture and outstanding device performance, the graphene/Si nanoarrays are expected to have great application potential in the new photovoltaic devices.
