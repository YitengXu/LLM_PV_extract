Recently, organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their extremely high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Not only does the performance of PSCs depend on the material properties of the device involved, but also it is dramatically affected by the nature of their interfaces present, which highly affect the carriers' extraction, transport and recombination. Therefore, interface engineering, a novel approach towards high-performance PSCs, has attracted increasing interest. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the study of PSC interfaces, which have resulted in improved device performance.

Energy shortage is one of the major challenges facing the 21st century. Currently the majority of energy sources are produced from fossil fuels, which lead to severe environmental pollution, such as fog and haze. Accordingly, the search for clean and environmentally friendly energy sources is of exceptional importance. Of the available renewable and clean energy sources, solar energy is the most abundant. Therefore, harnessing solar energy efficiently is a good solution for addressing the energy problem.

In the past decades, photovoltaic technology that directly converts sunlight energy into electric energy on the basis of the photovoltaic effect has attracted tremendous research attention. Substantial effort has been focused on seeking promising candidates to improve the PCE and considerable progress has been made from organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, thin-film solar cells to dye-sensitized solar cells. Recently, by virtue of their appropriate and direct band gap, small exciton binding energy, and well-balanced ambipolar charge transport properties, earth-abundant organolead halide perovskites are considered outstanding candidates for application in solution-processed, low cost, highly efficient photovoltaic devices.
The general chemical formula of perovskite absorber materials is AMX3, where A is a large organic cation (typically CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+), M is a divalent metal cation (typically Pb2+, Sn2+), while X anions are halides (Cl−, Br−, I−). The ideal cubic crystal structure of perovskite has the M cation in 6-fold coordination, surrounded by an octahedron of anions (MX6), and the A cation in 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination. It is interesting to note that methylammonium (MA = CH3NH3+)-based halide perovskite materials (Fig. 1) go through structural phase transitions with temperature, with the molecular motion of the MA along the C–N axis and/or in regard to the crystal axis.
In 2009, Miyasaka and co-workers reported the first lead halide perovskite sensitized solar cell with a modest PCE of 3.8%. However, these cells were unstable due to the use of iodide/triiodide redox liquid electrolyte. In 2012, Park and Grätzel et al. developed solid-state mesoscopic heterojunction PSCs by employing the spiro-MeOTAD (99%) as the hole transport material (HTM) yielding a PCE of 9.7%. Snaith et al. reported a meso-superstructured solar cell, based on a highly crystalline perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) absorber, which showed a PCE of 10.9%. Seok et al. combined the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) as the light-harvesting unit in a bilayer solar-cell architecture, and obtained a certified PCE of 17.9%. Presently, a certified efficiency of 20.1% perovskite-based solar cells has been obtained, demonstrating the feasibility of these materials for highly efficient solar cells.
To date, there are various film deposition methods for the fabrication of PSCs: one-step precursor solution deposition, two-step sequential deposition, dual-source vapor deposition and vapor-assisted solution process, two-step spin-coating in situ intercalation, anti-solvent post-treatment, solvent–solvent extraction (SSE), drop-casting, slot-die casting and gas-assisted post-treatment. A perovskite solar cell is typically composed of a transparent electrode, a metal electrode, a light harvesting perovskite layer sandwiched between the HTM and the electron transport material (ETM). There are a variety of structures in PSCs including mesoscopic nanostructured (TiO2, Al2O3, etc.) solar cells, planar heterojunction (p–i–n and n–i–p) solar cells, and HTM-free and ETM-free solar cells as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2 schematically shows the work mechanism of solid state PSCs. The cell's working principle involves the following processes: the perovskite material produces the carriers (electrons and holes) after absorbing light. The electron is separated from the hole, and then it is injected into the ETM and migrates to the anode. Subsequently, the electron passes through the external circuit to the cathode. At the same time, the hole transfers into the HTM, then migrates to the cathode, at which they encounter and recombine. Carrier extraction and injection occur at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) or hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces and the ETL or HTL/electrode layer interfaces, respectively. Therefore, the properties of these interfaces influence the device performance dramatically. Similarly when it goes to a cell, not only does the performance of solar cells depend on the molecular properties of the cell components involved, but also it is dramatically affected by the nature of the interfaces present. As a matter of fact, it is well recognized that interface modification is an efficient way to achieve high-performance solar cells, since it can improve the open-circuit voltage and eliminate the photocurrent hysteresis, etc. Therefore, interface engineering has become a significant approach to fabricate high-performance PSCs. Recently, there have been many reports that focused on the modification of the device interfaces, such as ETL/metal electrode interfaces, ETL/perovskite interfaces, and ETL/transparent electrode (ITO) interfaces. It is said that HTL/perovskite interfaces have an important influence on the device performance. In addition, modification of perovskite/metal electrode interfaces can lead to a higher PCE.
Despite some progress in the investigation of interfaces, a deeper understanding of interface phenomena and exploration of novel interface modification techniques are still required for the sake of improving the overall performance. In this review, we limit ourselves to summarize recent progress of the materials and technologies associated with interfacial engineering instead of focusing on interfacial theory and charge dynamics for PSCs, which were recently reviewed elsewhere. We hope that interfacial engineering of PSCs attracts more attention in order to promote the development of this type of solar cell.

Energy level alignment at the interfaces, to a great extent, affecting device parameters, is critical for the optimization of the device. Proper matching of the electronic energy level of adjacent layers is necessary to obtain high power conversion efficiency. Only when electrons are extracted from the perovskite into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the ETL while holes are transferred to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the HTL can the device operate efficiently. The ETL (also called hole-blocking layer) is needed to prevent the holes generated in the perovskite layer from reaching the cathode, as this would short-circuit the cell. The band offset between the ETL/perovskite is a key factor for carrier recombination at the interface. Suitable offset (∼0.2 eV) can ensure the efficient injection of electrons from perovskite to the ETL. When the LUMO of the ETL is much lower than that of the perovskite, the Voc will decrease, while a much smaller offset will induce remarkable carrier recombination. Similarly, the HOMO of the HTM should be a little higher than that of the perovskite to efficiently extract the holes and block the electrons. In addition, the two electrodes should facilitate better charge transfer from the adjacent layers and their work functions should match the energy levels of the adjacent layers. The energy levels for the commonly used materials in PSCs are shown in Fig. 3. Rationalization of the function and performance of PSCs has been based mostly on device energy diagrams derived from energy values of the isolated components. It is worth mentioning that mismatching energy levels between adjacent layers can be adjusted through surface modification.


Improving the electron extraction and injection is an important approach to enhance the efficiency of PSCs. These two major processes, electron extraction and injection, occur at the ETL/perovskite layer interface. Therefore, the properties of this interface have an important influence on the device performance. And much effort has been devoted to the modification of the ETL/perovskite interfaces.

Rapid extraction of the photo-induced carriers is necessary to enhance the charge collection efficiency. The ETL/perovskite interface has a key influence on electron extraction. To ensure efficient electron extraction, a suitable ETL has to be compatible with the perovskite absorber. Introduction of an additive between the ETL and perovskite layer is a common approach for interface modification. PCBM was introduced to modify the surface of the ETL (ZnO) in the device structure of ITO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag. Ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to investigate the electronic structures of ZnO and ZnO/PCBM. With regard to the ZnO/PCBM ETL, the CBM of ZnO/PCBM is located between ZnO and that of perovskite, so much more favorable energy-level alignment occurs at the interfaces, facilitating cascade charge extraction. In addition, the Voc which is usually determined by the energy-level offset between the quasi Fermi levels of the ETL and HTL adjacent to the perovskite absorber was further enhanced relatively to those of bare ZnO-based devices.
For PSCs, faster electron injection is always desirable for competing with carrier trapping and even thermalization/cooling, because a large amount of the converted photon energy is wasted in the above processes. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were introduced as an ultrathin layer between perovskite and TiO2 (Fig. 4a), achieving a significant PCE improvement from 8.81% to 10.15%. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy was used to investigate the role of the ultrathin GQD layer in the device. They found that much faster electron extraction with the presence of GQDs (90–106 ps) than without their presence (260–307 ps) happened, namely, GQDs can act as an ultrathin glue to enhance the electronic coupling and as a superfast electron funnel to efficiently mediate the electron transfer from the absorber to the acceptor. So it can significantly enhance the electron extraction from perovskite to TiO2. Ogomi et al. introduced HOCO-R-NH3+I− between the porous TiO2 and perovskite (Fig. 4b), observed that electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 became faster after HOCO-R-NH3+I− was inserted at the interface between TiO2 and perovskite.

Carrier recombination is detrimental to the device performance. Weak recombination at the interfaces will lead to high Voc in the PSCs. Therefore, suppression or reduction of carrier recombination through appropriate interfacial engineering for the perovskite-based solid hybrid solar cells is very important for achieving high efficiency. Ogomi et al. found that carrier recombination could be suppressed by inserting the HOCO-R-NH3+I− anchor group between the ETL/perovskite layer. They investigated the charge recombination dynamics between electrons in TiO2 and holes in perovskite by using nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectroscopy. For perovskite/TiO2 without HOCO-R-NH3+I−, no TA signal could be observed. This indicated that the recombination time between electrons injected into TiO2 and holes in perovskite was less than 1 μs (the TA signal appeared is typically longer than μs in the time scale). For perovskite/TiO2 with HOCO-R-NH3+I−, however, a TA signal could be observed clearly, which disappeared in around 10 μs. This result suggested that the as-inserted HOCO-R-NH3+I− between TiO2 and perovskite could greatly suppress the recombination of the electrons in TiO2 and holes in perovskite. So the introduction of HOCO-R-NH3+I− can enhance the device performance.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) can be used to investigate the charge recombination processes by extracting the recombination resistance (Rrec) from its measurements in PSCs. Charge recombination processes can be revealed by the features observed in the low-frequency region in the IS spectra, and the Rrec can be obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots in this region. Taking Lee and his co-workers' work as an example, they obtained the Rrec values of the PSCs with ZnO and ZnO/PCBM at different applied voltages under 1-sun illumination (Fig. 4c). The cell with ZnO/PCBM showed higher Rrec values (lower recombination rate) than those of the device with only ZnO at low applied bias, suggesting that the interfacial modification could suppress the surface charge recombination greatly. They also found that bulk charge recombination, which corresponded to the higher Rrec values obtained at high applied bias, could be decreased by the interfacial modification of ZnO.
Han et al. introduced an organic silane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) in the device structure of FTO/TiO2/ZrO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon to modify the interface between the ETL and perovskite. The introduction of the silane SAM can achieve a larger built-in potential, which contributes to the separation of photogenerated carriers and the suppression of electrons from TiO2 to CH3NH3PbI3. At the same time, the device with the silane SAM obtained a longer charge-carrier lifetime, which is conducive to hole transport through the perovskite/ZrO2 layer before reaching the carbon back contact. So the silane SAM can help to suppress the carrier recombination. An effective way of controlling the charge recombination is to change the electrical properties of the wide band gap semiconductors by coating the nanoparticle surfaces. MgO was successfully introduced by being spin-coated onto the mesoporous TiO2 layer to suppress charge recombination. Transient photovoltage decay data demonstrated that the recombination time for MgO-coated TiO2 nanoparticle-based PSCs was about three times longer than that of the TiO2 nanoparticle-based device. The longer recombination time was responsible for enhancing the Voc and FF of MgO-coated TiO2 nanoparticle-based PSCs.
Besides the mentioned above, there are some other interfacial modifications between the ETL/perovskite interface layer. For example, the introduction of C60-substituted benzoic acid self- assembled monolayer (C60SAM) on the surface of both the mesoporous and compact TiO2 can enhance the Voc and FF comparison to the bare TiO2–perovskite solar cells, further improving the PCE of the device. Li et al. introduced 3-aminopropanoic acid SAM (C3-SAM) between the sol–gel ZnO and perovskite layers. It led to significant improvement both in the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and in alignment of the interfacial energy level, enhancing the PCE from 11.96% to 15.67%. It is also reported that yttrium was introduced to modify TiO2 with the aim of improving the electron transport properties. Additionally, the modification can also control the growth of the crystal due to the enhancement of the compatibility to the perovskite materials and contribute to a higher PCE.

The widely used inverted PSC structure is the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/ETL/metal electrode. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is often used as the ETL. The ETL/metal electrode layer interface has a key influence on electron collection of the metal electrode from the ETL. Introducing suitable interfacial materials to modify the interfaces of the ETL and the metal electrode is an important approach to improve PSC performances. Seok and his co-workers introduced a thin LiF layer (0.5 nm) between the PCBM and the Al electrode in the cells. The insertion of the LiF layer can contribute to the improvement in both the FF and Jsc, compared to those of a device without a LiF layer. In organic solar cells, the introduction of LiF had already been reported. This modification could generate a dipole moment across the interfaces that can reduce the energy barrier between PCBM/Al leading to the improvement of electron migration from the PCBM to the LiF/Al. By inserting the LiF interlayer and choosing the optimal thickness of the PCBM layer, they fabricated highly efficient devices with a PCE of 14.1% (Jsc of 20.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.866 V, and FF of 78.3%) under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 irradiation.

It is also reported that an amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) was introduced to modify the interface between the ETL and the metal electrode. The modified interface can reduce the leakage current at the cathode, because compared to the dark current density of the devices with the bare Al cathode under reverse bias, it is about one order of magnitude smaller with the PN4N/Al bilayer cathode. In addition, it has been reported in polymer solar cells that the interfacial modification of the insertion of PN4N can eliminate the trap states at the PCBM/metal electrode interface, leading to the reduction of recombination of charges at the cathode interface and reduce the injection barrier between the PCBM and the metal electrode and then lead to an improvement of electron transport in the device. This modification resulted in a remarkable enhancement of PCE from 12.4% to 15.0%. Besides, photocurrent hysteresis was insignificant, which might be attributed to the improved cathode interface modified by PN4N.
Zhang et al. introduced ZnO or perylene-diimide (PDINO) layers to modify the PCBM/Ag interface. Both ZnO and PDINO layers can effectively modify the PCBM/Ag interface and improve the Voc. A high PCE > 13% is achieved in PDINO-based devices compared with that of ZnO-based devices. PDINO plays a key role, on one hand, providing the desired electronic levels for electron extraction, producing uniform films with favorable collection, and low series resistance, on the other hand, successfully preventing Ag ions from diffusing to the semiconductor interface during evaporation. In addition, PDINO-based devices also show a higher stability relative to those of devices with PCBM/Ag and PCBM/ZnO/Ag cathodes (Table 2).

Bathocuproine (BCP) is often used as an electron transporting or hole blocking layer in organic light emitting diodes, organic photodetectors and organic photovoltaic devices due to its fabulous electron mobility and poor hole mobility. It was also introduced as a hole blocking layer between double fullerene layers and the metal electrode in PSCs, besides, with the aim of reducing the damage of the fullerene layer followed by metal deposition. There are also fullerene and its derivative that were introduced to modify the interface between the ETL and the Ag electrode. Both are conducive to the improvement of the device performance.

The ITO can be used both in a normal architecture and an inverted structure, therefore, its role can switch from collecting holes to electrons. The work function of ITO (4.6 eV) makes it possible for it to collect either holes or electrons depending mainly on the contact properties of the coating layer on top of the ITO surface. In the inverted structure, it is coated with a high work function layer (PEDOT:PSS) which collects holes. In the normal structure, it is generally coated with a compact n-type metal oxide (TiO2) which could prevent direct contact between the ITO and HTM. As for the latter, a Schottky barrier exists at the ITO/TiO2 interface, which may lead to adverse effects on the device. However, this can be improved by modifying the electron energy level matching between the ITO and the TiO2, and more precise control over the doping level in the TiO2. Yang et al. introduced a solution of polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) in methoxyethanol (∼0.1% by weight) forming an ultrathin layer on the ITO surface. The introduced molecular dipole interactions successfully reduced the work function of ITO from 4.6 eV to 4.0 eV.

Only if achieving optimized interface energy level alignment between ITO and perovskite light absorber and preventing direct contact between the ITO and the HTM, a compact n-type metal oxide is not necessary for a normal structure. An exceptional approach to modify the ITO was reported in perovskite solar cells. Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) solution was used to modify the ITO surface, as shown in Fig. 5. Cs2CO3 did not form a continuous compact film but discontinuous islands on the ITO surface. This modification tuned the surface work function, leading to an optimized interface energy level alignment between ITO and the perovskite light absorber, accordingly, facilitating the electron collection efficiency from the perovskite layer to the ITO substrate and leading to higher device performance.

The function of an HTL is to block electrons and transport holes. The hole extraction, which is an important process in PSCs, occurs at the HTL/perovskite layer interface. Highly efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface helps to improve the device performance owing to the depletion of holes within the perovskite film, limiting opportunities for charge recombination. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve successful electron blocking and efficient hole extraction by interface engineering between the HTL and the perovskite interface. In addition, trap states at the perovskite surface can generate charge accumulation and lead to recombination losses in the device. Meanwhile, native dipoles occurring at the organic–inorganic interface, between the HTL and the perovskite layers, would contribute to the hysteresis. Thus, eliminating or reducing trap states through interface modification is conducive to the device performance.

As we all know, hole traps exist on the surfaces of three dimensional (3D) CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films. The hole traps resulting from the under-coordinated halide anions on the surface of the perovskite crystal will lead to a significant accumulation of charge at the perovskite/hole transporter heterojunction. Consequently, the introduction of an external material to saturate the under-coordinated halide anions is an efficient approach to reduce charge recombination. Snaith et al. have done pioneering work to introduce iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) through supramolecular halogen bonding donor–acceptor complexation to passivate perovskite surface hole trapping states. This engineering inhibited charge recombination and led to fast and efficient charge extraction. The best PCE of the IPFB-treated devices increased from 13.0% to 15.7% (Fig. 6a).
There are under-coordinated ions at the crystal surfaces and also at the grain boundaries between individual perovskite crystals. The under-coordinated Pb atoms in the perovskite crystal can be passivated via coordinate bonding between the sulfur atom in thiophene or the nitrogen atom in pyridine. The treatment between the HTL and the perovskite interface with the Lewis bases, thiophene and pyridine can result in a significant decrease in the rate of nonradiative recombination in perovskite films and increase the efficiency of PSCs from 13% to 15.3% and 16.5%, respectively (Fig. 6b). The instability of PSCs mainly arises from the CH3NH3 group (in CH3NH3PbI3) which is vulnerable to moisture. This can be ameliorated by changing the hydrophilic nature of the perovskite surface to a hydrophobic one. Dodecyltrimethoxysilane (C12–silane) as an amphiphilic molecule comprises hydrophobic long alkyl chains and electrophilic trimethoxysilane groups, which can change into Si–OH to bond I− in the perovskite surface. The introduction of this interlayer between the HTL and perovskite can make the surface of the perovskite more resistant to moisture, meanwhile, function as an electrically insulating barrier, reducing interfacial charge recombination losses in perovskite solar cells, resulting in an increase in FF and Voc.

The HTL is a very important component in PSCs, however, there is an HTL-free cell device that has been reported. It was demonstrated that the perovskite material itself can transport holes. A Schottky contact exists at the perovskite/metal electrode interface in HTM-free PSCs. Therefore it is required to develop suitable methods to modify the perovskite/metal electrode interface in order to improve the device performance.

As a wide band gap organic semiconductor, N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenyl benzidine (TPB) has been widely used in OLEDs. Recently, it has been introduced into PSCs. The HOMO energy level of TPB (−6.0 eV) is lower than the valence band edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV). Therefore, TPB is not suitable as the hole conductor for its mismatched band alignment in the band structure. However, the introduction of a thin TPB layer can increase the recombination resistance, which may help to reduce the dark current and lead to the improvement in Voc. In other words, the TPB layer can well suppress the electron recombination at the back Schottky contact and improve the device performance.

Great progress has been made in PSCs in the past six years. However, to realize practical applications, further efforts to improve the overall device performance including high efficiency, excellent stability, low cost, and nontoxic absorber materials are still required. There is much room to improve the photovoltaic performance of the organolead halide perovskite-based solar cells by interface engineering.

Featuring a bandgap of 1.45 eV, FAPbI3 has the potential to achieve higher performance than MAPbI3. The highest PCE is based on the FAPbI3 material which is crystallized into large-grained films through the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide molecules intercalated in PbI2 with formamidinium iodide. There is scarcely any report about interfacial engineering in FAPbI3-based PSCs. Therefore, it will attract increasing attention to improve the FAPbI3-based device performance by interfacial engineering. Moreover, the long-term stability of PSCs is a pressing, unsolved question. The reported longest time of device stability so far is about 2000 h under temperatures of 80–85 degrees celsius. This is far from practical application. The stability of interfaces between adjacent layers is an important factor. From this point, interface engineering would be an effective approach to improve the stability of the device.
To date, most attention has been paid to the modification of the ETL/metal electrode interface and ETL/perovskite interface. Further investigations of the perovskite/HTL interface and HTL/electrode interface are still required. As has been pointed out by Johansson and co-workers, the efficiencies can be primarily determined by recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface. Hole transport materials are currently the bottleneck for the realization of cost effective and stable devices. Although it was shown that without using a HTL a high PCE of 10% can be achieved, the use of an additional HTM layer significantly improves the device performance. Recently, Miyasaka et al. pointed out that the interface between the FTO and TiO2 compact layer is one of the origins to hysteresis in planar heterojunction PSCs. More efforts, therefore, need to be focussed on this interface to reduce hysteresis and enhance performance.
In conclusion, with a deeper understanding of interface phenomena and exploration of novel interface modification approaches, interface engineering is expected to drive further development of PSCs. We expect that higher efficiency will be obtained after more research work on the interfaces of PSCs.
