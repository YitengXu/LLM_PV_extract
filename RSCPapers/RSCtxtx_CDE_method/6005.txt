A combination of squaraine-based dyes (SPSQ1 and SPSQ2) and a ruthenium-based dye (N3) were chosen as co-sensitizers to construct efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. The co-sensitization of squaraine dyes with N3 enhanced their light-harvesting properties as a result of the broad spectral coverage in the region 350–800 nm. The co-sensitized solar cells based on SPSQ2 + N3 showed the highest short circuit current density of 17.10 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.66 V and a fill factor of 0.73, resulting in the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.2%, which is higher than that of the dye-sensitized solar cells based on the individual SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 dyes. The high power conversion efficiency of SPSQ2 + N3 was ascribed to its good light-harvesting properties, which resulted from its broader incident photon current conversion spectrum than that of the individual dyes. The high electron life time and electron recombination, which were the main causes of the higher efficiency of the device, were successfully analysed and correlated using transient absorption spectrometry and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectrometry.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising sources of renewable energy as a result of their relatively high performance and inexpensive production costs, uncomplicated molecular tuning, intense absorption wavelengths and ease of fabrication in various colours. For more than two decades ruthenium-based dyes were the only candidates for DSSCs as a result of their strong metal to ligand charge transfer transition and power conversion efficiency (PCE) >11%. However, ruthenium-based dyes have a number of disadvantages, such as the absence of absorption in the near-IR region (NIR), low molar extinction coefficients and high-cost, tedious purification methods. In this context, porphyrins, phthalocyanines and many metal-free organic dyes such as indoline, triarylamine, dithieno-fused heterocycles and squaraine dyes have been developed to harness photons in the NIR region. However, it is difficult to synthesize organic dyes covering a broad absorption range over the whole UV-visible–NIR region. The use of a photo anode (TiO2 electrode) in a solution containing two or more dyes with complementary absorption is referred to as co-sensitization and has been shown to be a more promising way to obtain a broad spectral response over the UV-visible–NIR region for use in DSSCs.

In principle, co-sensitization requires the complementary absorption of two or more dyes and a good understanding of the molecular orientation, size and shape of the dyes. Grätzel and co-workers showed that the co-sensitization of metal-containing dyes and metal-free dyes of different molecular sizes allowed a better surface coverage, yielding a high short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) and resulting in a high PCE. Zhu and co-workers also tested this model using two different organic dyes with different molecular sizes and achieved a high PCE of 10.4%. Pauporté and co-workers used indoline-based organic dyes for co-sensitization and improved the PCE as a result of the enhancement of the light-harvesting properties of the co-sensitized solar cell. Porphyrin dyes or ruthenium-based dyes used as co-sensitizers with complementary absorbing small molecules showed the highest the PCE of 10–13%, which was attributed to the broad incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and produced a high JSC and high PCE.
Squaraine dyes have attracted much attention as a result of the simple synthetic protocols for symmetrical and asymmetrical squaraine dyes. Squaraine dyes are promising NIR co-sensitizers as a result of their high molar extinction coefficients and absorption at longer wavelengths, which produces broad IPCE conversion, leading to a high PCE. Grätzel et al. reported a stepwise co-sensitization procedure based on a squaraine dye (SQ1) with JK-2 and improved the PCE from 4.2 to 7.4% for DSSCs based on liquid electrolytes and from 3.8 to 6.4% for DSSCs based on ionic liquid electrolytes. The PCE was further increased to 8.7% by coating an Al2O3 layer onto a photo anode sensitized with JK-2. Rapid co-sensitization is a simple method of improving the PCE; Holliman et al. used SQ1 and N719 dyes for co-sensitization and achieved a high PCE of 7.9%. Wang and co-workers achieved a PCE of 6.5% using squaraine dyes with triple dye sensitization; the wide IPCE was >70% in the range 400–700 nm. So far the highest PCE for co-sensitized squaraine dyes with N3 as a co-sensitizer achieved a PCE of ca. 8.1% as a result of a remarkable enhancement in both the JSC and VOC values. Chen and co-workers improved the PCE from 6.7 to 9.8% for co-sensitized solar cells based on a squaraine dye (YR6) and a phenothiazine dye (PT3) in a molar ratio of 25:1 and attributed this to the minimized aggregation of the squaraine dye on the photo anode by co-adsorption of the twisted PT3 dye. We used the NIR-absorbing SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 dyes to co-sensitize solar cells with N3 dye, which has complementary absorption. The co-sensitized devices based on SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3 showed enhanced IPCE spectra, which led to a higher JSC than the individual organic dyes (SPSQ1 and SPSQ2). The enhanced spectral response can be explained by the complementary absorption of the squaraine dyes and the N3 dye (Fig. 1).

The absorption spectra of the SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 dyes (Fig. 2a) in a solution of dichloromethane (DCM) showed absorption maxima at 651 nm (ε = 2.01 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and 692 nm (ε = 1.59 × 105 M−1 cm−1), respectively.Fig. 2b shows the absorption spectra on TiO2 film for SPSQ and N3 and the co-sensitized dyes (SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3) in an equimolar solution. N3 absorbs between 450 and 600 nm, which is complementary to the absorption of the SPSQ dyes, which show absorption in the region 600–750 nm. This clearly indicates that N3 is suitable for use as a co-sensitizer with SPSQ dyes to obtain a broad spectral response in the solar region of the spectrum. Hence the absorption of SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3 covers a broad spectral range from 300 to 750 nm. As dyes with a longer wavelength of absorption over a wide spectral region are essential in obtaining a better photovoltaic performance of the DSSC, these dyes might be suitable for constructing DSSCs and may result in a higher PCE for co-sensitized solar cells. The co-sensitized dye SPSQ2 + N3 had a stronger red-shifted absorption than SPSQ1 + N3 and the isolated N3 dye and was better matched with the solar flux, which might result in better light-harvesting in photovoltaic applications.


Electrochemical investigations of the redox potentials and spectroelectrochemical measurements of the associated changes in the visible–NIR absorption spectra provided information about the possible charge transfer states that formed on optical excitation. The cyclic voltammograms of SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 in DCM showed two irreversible oxidation waves at 0.59 and 0.84 V and 0.67 and 0.90 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. In DSSCs, the sensitizer promotes an electron to the excited state by absorbing a photon and then injects the excited electron into the semiconductor on an ultra-rapid time scale. We carried out a spectroelectrochemical study to gain an insight into the electronic properties of the oxidized species of the squaraine sensitizers.Fig. 3 shows the spectral changes in SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 under an applied potential. During the controlled potential oxidation of SPSQ1 at 0.80 V, the absorption peak at 670 nm reduced in intensity with the formation of isosbestic points at 580 and 685 nm, indicating that oxidation resulted in a single product. These characteristic changes indicated the formation of the squaraine cation radical. Similar spectral changes were also observed for SPSQ2 at an applied potential 0.88 V vs. Ag/AgCl. No further change was observed in either sensitizer at an applied potential of 1.10 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In both sensitizers, the original absorption spectra were retained after the removal of the applied potential.


The co-sensitization approach improves the PCE as a result of the larger JSC value, which is attributed to the broad spectral coverage of the solar spectrum. The current–voltage (J–V) plots and IPCE of the DSSC devices sensitized by SPSQ1, SPSQ2, N3, SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3 using mesoscopic TiO2 photo anodes under AM 1.5 illumination conditions are shown in Fig. 4 and the data are presented in Table 1.

The DSSC devices based on the isolated SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 dyes showed a poor performance with PCE values of 2.98 and 3.95%, respectively, which were attributed to their lower JSC values of 6.51 and 7.94 mA cm−2, respectively. The lower PCE values of these dyes were attributed to the partial coverage of the solar spectrum in the range 300–550 nm, with a maximum IPCE of 60% at 340 and 550–750 nm and a maximum IPCE >70% at 660 and 690 nm, which were well matched with the absorption spectra of the respective dyes. However, the co-sensitized dyes SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3 showed higher JSC values of 15.60 and 17.10 mA cm−2, respectively. As the energy levels of the dyes play a major part in the generation of the photocurrent, the high LUMOs of the two dyes (−3.43 and −3.68 eV) and N3 (−3.77 eV) thermodynamically facilitate the injection of an electron for both the isolated and co-sensitized dyes and produce larger JSC values. The significant increase in JSC was in good agreement with the IPCE values at 350–700 nm and produced impressive PCE values of 7.20% for SPSQ1 + N3 and 8.20% for SPSQ2 + N3, which are 42 and 48% higher than the values for the isolated SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 dyes. These combinations of co-sensitized dyes showed interesting IPCE spectra covering a wide range of the solar spectrum from 350 to 750 nm with >60% of the IPCE; the squaraine peak at wavelengths >700 nm was responsible for more of the increase in the PCE than the N3 dye.
The increase in the light-harvesting ability of the co-sensitized dyes is a result of the adsorption of the dyes onto TiO2via different carboxylic acid and cyanoacrylic acid adsorption sites. As the anchoring sites for mesoporous TiO2 are unique for each adsorbed dye, this suggests that SPSQ2 and N3 favour adsorption–dispersion on the photoanodic film. The DSSCs sensitized with SPSQ1, SPSQ2 and N3 single-dye systems had VOC values of 0.627, 0.670 and 0.650 V, respectively. SPSQ1, when co-sensitized with N3, showed a VOC value of 0.635 V (SPSQ1 + N3), which is lower than that of N3 alone, whereas the VOC value (0.656 V) of SPSQ2 + N3 was higher than that of the N3 dye.

As the dynamics of dye regeneration by electrolytes is crucial in the performance of DSSCs, nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectrometry (LP920) was used to study the kinetics of dye regeneration by the electrolytes. To obtain a full picture of the transients events, namely the bleaching of the neutral dye and the formation of the oxidized dye, the photo-induced differential absorption spectra (ΔOD) were recorded immediately after the laser pulse (545 nm) excitation of the SPSQ1 dye adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 5a) and the SPSQ2 dye adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 5b).

Broad peaks centred around 720 (SPSQ1) and 780 nm (SPSQ2) were observed for both dyes adsorbed on TiO2. These peaks correspond to the absorption of the respective oxidized dyes (as seen with N719) observed in the spectroelectrochemical studies (Fig. 3), although electrons photo-injected into the TiO2 semiconductor may also have a small contribution (the contributions of the excited state absorption and luminescence of both dyes can also be neglected). Bleaching of the respective ground states of the dyes around 660 (SPSQ1) and 700 nm (SPSQ2) had very small ΔOD amplitudes compared with those of the corresponding oxidized dyes, which means the latter had high extinction coefficients (the number of bleached dye molecules should equal the number of oxidized molecules). The decay lifetimes of the bleaching of ground states are usually measured as the lifetime of dye regeneration. Because of their very small amplitudes, the decay lifetimes for the formation of oxidized dyes (both representing the same decay lifetimes) were measured instead.

Fig. 6 shows the time needed for the complexes SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 in the corresponding oxidized dyes to regenerate the neutral dye by a reduction process from the LiI/I2 redox species present in the electrolyte. This experiment was compared with the regeneration time for the N3 dye under the same experimental conditions. The fitting of the decay profiles observed for the transient absorption signal in the presence of an electrolyte resulted in regeneration times of 30.2, 17.8 and 1.7 μs for the SPSQ1, SPSQ2 and N3 dyes, respectively. The rate of dye regeneration (SPSQ1, SPSQ2 and N3) was observed to be of the same order as the photocurrent density (Table 1) generated from devices using SPSQ1, SPSQ2 and N3. The much lower energy values of the HOMO levels of SPSQ1 and SPSQ2 implies a higher driving force for electron replenishment to regenerate the neutral dye. This trend was confirmed for the dyes SPSQ1 and SPSQ2.
The kinetics of regeneration of the mixed SPSQ + N3 dyes is an average of the kinetics of the separate N3 and SPSQ dye regeneration kinetics. The decay lifetime for the regeneration of the mixed SPSQ2 + N3 dye was expected to lie between the faster decay of the N3 dye (1.7 μs) and the slower decay of the SPSQ2 dye (17 μs). In a separate measurement, the decay of the mixed dye was found to be about 12 μs. The best performance of the cell cannot be related to the new average dye regeneration lifetime and depends greatly on the effect of the complementary spectral overlap.

To understand the difference in the VOC values observed for the DSSCs based on the SPSQ1, SPSQ2 and N3 single dyes and the SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3 co-sensitized dyes, the relative conduction band positions and electron lifetimes in the DSSCs were investigated. We first measured the relative conduction band position of TiO2 by means of a charge extraction method (CEM).

As shown in Fig. 7a, the DSSCs sensitized with both single and co-sensitized dyes showed a similar linear increase in electron density as a function of VOC, indicating that these cells had the same conduction band edge of TiO2 regardless of the different molecular structures and co-sensitization. As the conduction band edge was not influenced by these dyes, the difference in the VOC must be a result of charge recombination, which is related to the electron lifetime (τ). IMVS was used to measure τ and Fig. 7b shows the relationship between τ and VOC for DSSCs sensitized with SPSQ1, SPSQ2, N3, SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3. It is clear that at a fixed VOC the lifetime increases in the order SPSQ1 < SPSQ1 + N3 < N3 < SPSQ2 + N3 < SPSQ2, which is in agreement with the order of the increasing VOC values observed in the DSSCs. The longest lifetime observed for the SPSQ2 cell suggests that the SPSQ2 dye sufficiently suppressed the recombination of electrons with I3− in the TiO2 film. In the SPSQ2 cell, the dyes were most probably arrayed in a regular manner and formed blocking layers on the TiO2 surface that suppressed the recombination of electrons. The longer lifetime of SPSQ2 + N3 compared with that of SPSQ1 + N3 suggested that the robust SPSQ2 dye sufficiently suppressed the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 layer with the I3− redox electrolyte.

We used co-sensitized photoanodes containing squaraine-based metal-free organic dyes (SPSQ1 and SPSQ2) and a ruthenium-based dye (N3) to fabricate DSSCs. The co-sensitized dyes SPSQ1 + N3 and SPSQ2 + N3 showed better PCE values of 7.20 and 8.20%, respectively, than the individual SPSQ1 (2.98%), SPSQ2 (3.95%) and N3 (7.13%) dyes. The superior performance of the co-sensitized DSSCs was attributed to the complementary absorption of the squaraine dyes and N3 dye covering a broad spectral range from 350 to 700 nm, which enhanced the JSC and PCE values. Transient absorption studies showed that the time needed for the regeneration of the co-sensitized dyes was between the times needed to regenerate the individual organic dyes used for the co-sensitization of the photoanode. This complementary absorption and the resultant high JSC values were responsible for superior PCE of the co-sensitized dyes and the selection of suitable dyes for co-sensitization may lead to more promising PCEs in co-sensitized solar cells at lower production costs.


A UV-visible spectrophotometer was used to record absorption spectra in DCM solution and for the TiO2 films. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using a PC-controlled CH Instruments Model CHI 620C electrochemical analyser with 1 mM asymmetrical squaraine sensitizers in dichloromethane (DCM) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was glassy carbon; a standard calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode and platinum wire was used as the auxiliary electrode. After the cyclic voltammogram had been recorded, ferrocene was added and a second voltammogram was measured. The optical thin layer electrochemical studies were carried on using Maya 2000 Ocean Optics software using a DT-MINI-2-GS, UV-visible–near-infrared Lightsource instrument. Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature using an optically transparent thin layer electrochemistry technique in dry DCM containing a supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate in a 2 mm thick quartz cuvette.


An Edinburgh Instruments Model LP920 nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectrometer was used together with a Continuum Nd-YAG laser (Surelite; 10 Hz repetition rate; FWHM 5 ns) through a Surelite optical parametric oscillator. The dye-sensitized TiO2 samples with and without electrolyte were subjected to 6 mJ cm−2 flash photolysis. The respective dyes were excited at 545, 510 and 635 nm to obtain homogeneous absorption profiles throughout the dye-sensitized TiO2 layers. The excited state decay of the dye and the recovery of the fundamental state were monitored by changes in the absorbed continuous spectrum. A satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio was obtained by averaging the absorption spectra for 100–200 laser shots.


The TiO2 photoanode was prepared as reported previously. A fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass substrate with a resistance of ca. 10 ohm−2 was used. A screen-printed double-layer TiO2 film (8 + 5) μm in thickness (0.25 cm2 cell area) with a 8 μm transparent layer of TiO2 particles (ca. 20 nm in diameter) and a 5 μm scattering layer of TiO2 particles (ca. 400 nm in diameter) was prepared. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 1 h. The thickness of the films was measured with a Surfcom 1400A surface profiler (Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd). A 0.2 mM solution of dye in 1:1 v/v acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol was used to coat the TiO2 film for both the single- and mixed-dye DSCs. The TiO2 films were immersed in the dye solutions and then stored at 25 °C for 15 h. To assemble each cell, each dye-coated TiO2 film and a platinum-coated conducting glass were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame at 100 °C. An electrolyte consisting of a mixture of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was used in each cell.

The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a black metal mask with an area of 0.25 cm2 under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10; Wacom Denso Co., Japan). The IPCE spectra were measured with monochromatic incident light with 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in the direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki).

To obtain the photovoltaic response induced by the modulated light, the intensity-modulated photovoltage spectra were measured with a potentiostat (Solartron 1287) equipped with a frequency response analyser (Solartron 1255B) under open circuit conditions based on monochromatic illumination (420 nm) controlled by a Labview system. The modulated light was driven with a 10% AC perturbation current superimposed on a DC current in a frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz. The CEM was performed with the same monochromatic light source. The solar cell was illuminated at an open circuit condition for 5 s to attain a steady state and then the light source was switched off when the device simultaneously switched to a short circuit condition to extract the charges generated at that light intensity.
