Advances in organic photovoltaic technology for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) towards the theoretical maximum require efficient light-absorbing polymers, a high alignment-level of selective contacts, and an easy manufacturing process with low cost to reach them. The halide salts constitute a highly promising class of materials that can produce better selective contacts in solar cells for improving the PCE. In this article, we demonstrate and report the use of a haloid salt in organic solar cells utilized as an interlayer. The haloid salt is deposited on top or below of polyfluorene polymer (PFN) layer and after it is placed on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO). Thermal evaporation of LiF layers is carried out to deposit ultrathin films of 0.5 nm to 0.8 nm thickness. As a photoactive layer we use the low-bandgap PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM bulk-heterojunction. Among the different architectures analyzed we obtained a PCE of 11.00%, with an outstanding fill factor of FF = 73.5%, which is among the best reported for solar cells. This new stacking of a halide salt with polyfluorene materials could find use in fully exploiting the potential of various halide systems, and also opens up new opportunities to improve OSCs with a view to achieving record efficiencies.

Organic solar cells now have increased efficiencies and stability that allow them to be used in the first commercial applications. Recently, power conversion efficiency (PCE) values over 10% for single junction devices have been reported. Yet, the challenge to close the gap between experimental PCE values and the theoretical efficiency predicted for standard measurement conditions remains. In most cases, advances in PCE values for organic solar cells have been achieved by using new low bandgap polymer materials, re-engineering the interface between the electron extraction layer and the polymer active layer using transition metal oxides, halide salts and organic materials, or the incorporation of additives to fine tune the bulk heterojunction nanomorphology of the photoactive layer.

In organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) the use of halide salts is very much to control the band alignment in the device structure to improve charge injection. For example, sodium fluoride (NaF), calcium difluoride (CaF2), magnesium difluoride (MgF2), and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) have been used in device structures. Likewise, thin halide salt (THS) layers have been proposed to be used as a buffer interlayer for organic solar cells (e.g. lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide (Li[CF3SO2]2N), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3), and lithium fluoride (LiF)) to increase the device performance. However, the interface between the halide layer and polymer layer acting as a selective contact in polymer based organic solar cells is not well understood.
Herein, we report the increase in the PCE of inverted organic solar cells (i-OSCs) made from a low bandgap polymer, chemical name: poly(2-ethylhexyl 6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-3fluorothienol[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate)-(PBDTTT-EFT), in combination with the electron acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl (PC70BM) by just the careful modification of the interfacial electron transport layer (ETL). The polymer poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) and LiF are used as the selective organic electron transport layer (ETL) and halide salt, respectively.
The proposed device structure was indium tin oxide (ITO)/ETL/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/vanadium oxide (V2O5)/silver (Ag). Five types of configurations for the ETL have been studied: PFN/LiF (type I), LiF/PFN (type II), PFN (type III), LiF (type IV), and without an ETL (type V) as a control reference structure. The LiF layer is deposited by a thermal evaporation method with controlled layer thicknesses from 0.5 nm to 0.8 nm. In all the above mentioned device structures we analyzed the ITO work function and the PCE under standard measurement conditions.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured for all organic solar cells in the dark and under illumination under AM 1.5G light conditions and were used to extract the parameters of the photovoltaic device. The devices' optical properties such as incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), absorbance and reflectance are measured for the best organic solar cells in order to understand the optical-intensity distribution characteristics of placing a PFN/LiF interface layer close to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and how this limits the PCE in the polymer organic solar cell architecture. Charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were applied to i-OSCs in order to know how the charge density is influenced by the ultrathin LiF layer and the charge carrier lifetime. Last but not least, a simple diode model is used to fit the J–V curves in order to understand all the physical mechanisms present in the organic photovoltaic devices (OPV).

First, the ETL structures type I (ITO/PFN/LiF) and type II (ITO/LiF/PFN) were prepared and optimized. Thereafter, type III (ITO/PFN), type IV (ITO/LiF) and type V (ITO/without ETL) were prepared too.


In order to optimize the thin LiF layer in both architectures, four different thicknesses of 0.5 nm, 0.6 nm, 0.7 nm and 0.8 nm were deposited and identified as A, B, C, and D, respectively. In each group, there are four structures. Fig. 1A and B illustrate the cell configuration used for the type I-X and type II-X structure.

The J–V curves were recorded for type I and type II solar cells (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the improvement in the efficiency parameters as a function of thin LiF layer thickness from 0.5 nm to 0.8 nm for both types of devices. The parameters of the solar cells were extracted from the J–V curves under one-sun illumination (Fig. 1C and E) and in the dark (Fig. 1D and F) from type I and type II device groups, respectively. The parameters obtained from J–V curves were short-circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH).

Among types I-A, I-B, I-C and I-D, the best group was type I-B with a high PCE of 11% (average 10.62% from twenty devices) with a LiF layer thickness of 0.6 nm while among types II-A, II-B, II-C and II-D, the best group was type II-D with a PCE of 10.32% (average 9.96% from twenty devices) with a LiF layer thickness of 0.8 nm. LiF layers with different thicknesses were deposited by thermal evaporation (see the Experimental section).
The LiF layer deposited before or after the PFN buffer, in combination with the variation of the layer thickness makes all performance parameters of the cells become very sensitive. The maximum JSC was measured for type I-B and type II-D structures with values of 19.05 mA cm−2 and 18.76 mA cm−2, respectively. For the VOC we have values between 0.779 V (type II-C) and 0.787 V (type I-B) and the FF is in the range from 71.13% (type II-A) to 73.5% (type I-B), which are among the best reported values for organic solar cells with such high photocurrents. The statistical distribution of each performance parameter (i.e. JSC, VOC, FF and PCE) for type I and type II architectures is shown in ESI Fig. SI1.
The RS was identified as a second parameter that is influenced by the LiF layer thickness. As expected, we have found an increase of RS when the LiF layer thickness increases. We would like to mention that the RS values were independent of the position of the LiF interface layer, which is in good agreement with previous work.
Finally yet importantly, shunt resistance, RSH, variations from 366 Ω cm2 to 1 kΩ cm2 were measured in both sets of photovoltaic devices. The statistical distribution of RS and RSH are shown in Fig. SI1. Overall, the type I interface layer structure is better than the type II one regarding their performance parameters.

Three ETLs were configured to manufacture the device: type III (ITO/PFN/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag), type IV (ITO/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag) and type V (ITO/without ETL/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag). The manufacturing processes of the structures are given in the Experimental section.

The J–V characterizations of type III, type IV and type V i-OSCs architectures under light and darkness are shown in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. Optimized J–V curves type I-B and type II-B were also included in the same graphs, whose purpose is to compare with the previous ones. Table 2 shows a summary of the performance parameters of all solar cells as a function of the different configurations of the ETLs. The statistical distribution (i.e. average, median, and lower and upper limits of the experimental data obtained) is shown in the ESI.

The type I-B group with the ITO/PFN/LiF stack showed the best performance parameters giving a JSC of 19.05 mA cm−2 (average 18.68 mA cm−2), VOC of 0.787 V (average 0.784 V), FF of 73.50% (average 72.58%) and PCE of 11.0% (average 10.62%). For the type V group, without the ETL, we recorded lower performance parameters such as a JSC of 18.60 mA cm−2 (average 17.77 mA cm−2), VOC of 0.694 V (average 0.683 V), FF of 61.95% (average 59.13%) and PCE of 8.0% (average 7.22%).
These results point out that the interlayer ITO/PFN/LiF displays very efficient electron collection, which we attributed to a fine band alignment as we aim to demonstrate later in this work. Moreover, we would also like to point out that the light harvesting also increases in these modified devices with less reflection losses. Optical assessment of the device structure to prove that our hypothesis is correct is also described later in this work.


Fig. 3 shows the energy band diagram of the five device structures where the effective work function (Φeffect) of the electron selective contact was obtained as reported elsewhere. In our study, the Φeffect values of each structure were ITO/PFN/LiF ∼ −3.78 eV (type I), ITO/LiF/PFN ∼ −3.83 eV (type II), ITO/PFN ∼ −4.11 eV (type III), ITO/LiF ∼ −3.87 eV (type IV) and ITO ∼ −4.42 eV (type V). The work function of the V2O5/Ag hole selective contact was determined using an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Kelvin probe to be −5.32 eV in good agreement with the reported literature values.

On the one hand, when a metal is in contact with an organic semiconductor material (p-type or n-type) a potential drop (ΦB) occurs in the interfacial region resulting in the formation of a Schottky or an ohmic contact.
If the metal work function is lower than the LUMO energy level of the n-type polymer, an ohmic contact is formed. Reports about the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTTT-EFT declare values from approximately −5.24 eV to −5.67 eV and from −3.54 eV to −3.81 eV, respectively while the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PC70BM are reported from −5.80 eV to −6.10 eV and from −4.00 eV to −4.3 eV, respectively. Therefore, the type I-B, type II-B, type III and type IV structures form an ohmic contact with a ΦB of 0.52 eV, 0.47 eV, 0.19 eV, and 0.43 eV, respectively.

Φ
B values were taken from ref. 38. To determine the ΦB value we used a Simulator Silvaco/ATLAS in combination with the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) model approach. The simulator involves Poisson's continuity equations and Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics where the quasi-Fermi levels and a list of parameters were considered for the simulations. Finally the modeled J–V curves are obtained and fitted to the experimental ones. The extracted parameters are analyzed (i.e. ΦB, work function, mobility, etc.) and from that it is determined if the contact is an ohmic contact or not.
On the other hand, if the metal work function is higher than the LUMO energy level of the n-type polymer, a Schottky contact is formed. The type V structure that was manufactured without an ETL has shown a Schottky contact ΦB of 0.15 eV. In this interface the electron charge carriers are being blocked due to the Schottky contact formed between the LUMO energy level of PC70BM and the metal effective work function of ITO, see ref. 38. Moreover, it is likely that due to the lack of an electron selective contact to efficiently extract the electrons, an increase in the carrier recombination process occurs at the contact and, thus, a decrease in JSC would be expected too.
Overall we observed that when the interfacial ETL is optimized, the JSC reaches its maximum value.

First, we measured the absorbance for all different layers (Fig. 4). In the UV-visible spectrum, we see that the absorbance of the ITO layer showed a peak centered at ∼480 nm. For the LiF layer with 0.6 nm thickness, the UV-vis spectrum is constant from 835 nm to 350 nm and thereafter shows an increase in the UV region at values <350 nm. The UV-visible spectrum of the ITO/PFN stack showed a shoulder at 400 nm and meanwhile the peak of the pristine-ITO absorption was red-shifted from 480 nm to 530 nm which is due to the absorption of PFN deposited onto the ITO layer. In the case of ITO/PFN/LiF the absorbance was similar to that of ITO/PFN due to the fact that the LiF layer is extremely thin.

Subsequently, the absorption range for the PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM active layer is broader and it is from 350 nm to 800 nm where the first maximum peak groups that are located at 474 nm, 635 nm and 705 nm are attributed to the electron donor polymer and the peaks at 375 nm appertain to the electron acceptor fullerene material, being consistent with the results shown elsewhere.
Following the same order of analysis, the stacks ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM and ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5 have nearly the same UV-vis spectrum like the PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM layer, only that the peaks located at 635 nm and 705 nm were 8.65% and 6.46% less pronounced than for the active layer. Finally, the stack ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5 in the range from 335 nm to 438 nm has more absorbance, which is due to the absorbance of the V2O5 layer.
Moreover, the absorption increment at 375 nm was 10.52% higher than that for the ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM stack. Second, the reflectance spectra were obtained using an integrated sphere, as can be seen in Fig. 4B–D. In this analysis we have considered two ways to irradiate the stack of layers. The first way of light irradiation was through the TCO and the second way was through the stack of layers as can be seen in Fig. 4B and D, respectively.
Analyzing the final structure with the stack ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5 when the incident light was transmitted through the TCO, four maximum peaks are displayed in the spectrum, which are located at 328 nm, 401 nm, 520 nm and 780 nm with reflectance intensities of 17.2%, 9.6%, 15.07% and 22.0%, respectively.
The reflectance points located at 363 nm, 436 nm, 624 nm and 780 nm are attributed to the PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM active layer. In contrast, the position of the peak located at 520 nm is due to all the contributions of the PFN, ITO and V2O5 layers being more predominant compared to the reflectance of the ITO layer as shown in Fig. 4B.
When the light beam is incident on the stack of layers, we observed four maximum peaks located at 318 nm, 395 nm, 515 nm and 800 nm with reflectance intensities of 21.3%, 15.0%, 13.9% and 25.8%, respectively.
In general, when the light beam is incident on the material layers, the equivalent reflectance spectrum is notably incremented. This is due to an enhancement effect that each layer offers obtaining refractive index (nindex) and extinction coefficient (kec) equivalents for the structure.
Finally, reflectance characterization of one structure including the metallic contact (in this case the type I-B structure ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag) was carried out. As can be seen in Fig. 4B in the region between 500 nm and 720 nm the device stack has lower reflectance values, which is optimal for light absorption on the photoactive layer. Moreover, the reflectance spectrum located from 770 nm to 835 nm is higher in intensity due to the silver metal.

Fig. 5A compares the Incident Photon to Current Efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the different device structures. Fig. 5A shows the first group of devices with the stack ITO/PFN/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag.
We would like to mention that LiF was deposited with thicknesses of 0.5 nm, 0.6 nm, 0.7 nm and 0.8 nm and tagged as type I-A, type I-B, type I-C and type I-D structures, respectively. For each structure there is a strong correlation of the D/A interface area with the IPCE, the power conversion efficiency, short circuit current density and fill factor. The IPCE of type I-A, type I-B, type I-C and type I-D structures which almost have the same intensities at 520 nm is 81.9%, 88.7%, 83.1% and 81.8%, respectively. The integration of the IPCE with the sun-simulated light spectrum AM 1.5 G of the type I-A, type I-B, type I-C and type I-D structures results in photocurrent values of 18.65 mA cm−2, 19.00 mA cm−2, 18.23 mA cm−2 and 18.05 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental JSC measured.

Fig. 5B shows the second group of devices with the stack ITO/LiF/PFN/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag. Again, the LiF was deposited with thicknesses of 0.5 nm, 0.6 nm, 0.7 nm and 0.8 nm. The IPCE for type II-A, type II-B, type II-C and type II-D structures has also similar values at 520 nm of 85.2%, 83.6%, 87.0% and 86.8%, respectively. The estimated JSC after integration of the IPCE spectra with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum gives us values of 18.48 mA cm−2, 18.00 mA cm−2, 18.98 mA cm−2 and 18.74 mA cm−2, respectively, and again the values are in perfect agreement with the experimental JSC measured.

Fig. 5C shows the third group of devices: type I-B (ITO/PFN/LiF (0.6 nm)/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag), type II-B (ITO/LiF (0.6 nm)/PFN/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag), type III (ITO/PFN/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag), type IV (ITO/LiF/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag) and type V (ITO/without ETL/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag). The IPCE for type I-B, type II-B, type III, type IV and type V structures at the wavelength of 520 nm was 88.7%, 83.6%, 83.5%, 76.7% and 78.5%, respectively. The JSC values obtained by integrating under the IPCE curve for the type I-B, type II-B, type III, type IV and type V structures are shown in Fig. 5D which were 19.00 mA cm−2, 18.00 mA cm−2, 18.37 mA cm−2, 18.12 mA cm−2 and 18.58 mA cm−2, respectively, which strongly support the values obtained from the J–V characteristics. The IPCE is strongly modified according to the type of ETL used in the range from 350 nm to 550 nm.
Finally, Fig. 5E–I show the morphology obtained by AFM in tapping mode for each interface-structure with values of average roughness of ITO/PFN/LiF ∼ 1.29 nm (type I), ITO/LiF/PFN ∼ 1.54 nm (type II), ITO/PFN ∼ 1.82 nm (type III), ITO/LiF ∼ 2.75 nm (type IV) and ITO ∼ 2.48 nm (type V), respectively.
In the ESI is given an analysis of VOC, FF, RS and RSH for each structure manufactured and the modeling of experimental J–V curves using the standard equation of the cell. It also shows that the linear regions of logJ–V curves under darkness (see Fig. SI5) can be used to determine the RS and RSH when the cells are forward biased.

Photoinduced transient optoelectronic techniques (see the Experimental section for further details) have also been employed to evaluate the charge carrier density and lifetime in order to find a relationship between the interfacial recombination processes and the device efficiency. Such time-resolved techniques have been successfully employed in efficient dye sensitized solar cells and in OPV as a powerful tool to quantify the principle losses due to charge carrier recombination.

Fig. SI10A shows that the charge density grows exponentially with the applied light bias (photoinduced VOC) to the same extent for each type of cell and refers to the charges accumulated within the bulk of the device. The recombination dynamics have been measured using transient photovoltage (TPV) and the results (Fig. SI10B) show clearly that the contact configuration does not significantly affect the recombination processes of the device, giving very similar lifetimes for the same charge density under 1 sun illumination.

In summary, inverted organic solar cells were manufactured using PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM as the active layer and LiF (halide salt) with PFN (organic material) was used as the ETL. Five configurations of cells were manufactured and analyzed. The architectures obtained were ITO/PFN/LiF/active-layer/anode-contact (type I), ITO/LiF/PFN/active-layer/anode-contact (type II), ITO/PFN/active-layer/anode-contact (type III), ITO/LiF/active-layer/anode-contact (type IV) and ITO/without-ETL/active-layer/anode-contact (type V). Vanadium oxide/silver (V2O5/Ag) was used as an anode-contact for all the devices in this contribution. Lithium fluoride was deposited by thermal evaporation and its thickness was optimized to be 0.6 nm. Current–voltage characteristics and optical measurements were applied for all photovoltaic devices. The results provide direct evidence which shows that the i-OSC with the ITO/PFN/LiF (type I-B structure) configuration gives the highest performance parameters of PCE ∼ 11.00%, JSC ∼ 19.05 mA cm−2, VOC ∼ 0.787 V, FF ∼ 73.50% and RS ∼ 0.63 Ω cm2. On the other hand, the i-OSC with the ITO/LiF/PFN (type II-B) configuration gives the performance parameters of PCE ∼ 10.24%, JSC ∼ 18.07 mA cm−2, VOC ∼ 0.783 V, FF ∼ 73.12% and RS ∼ 0.70 Ω cm2. The structure type II-B shows a small decrease of 6.9% in PCE due to an increase of 11% in the RS regarding type I-B devices. All seem to indicate that the increment and decrement of the RS originated at the interface between the ITO with LiF/PFN and ITO with PFN/LiF for type II-B and type I-B structures, respectively. The ITO in contact with the ultrathin LiF layer deposited by thermal evaporation leads to the formation of clusters on the ITO and they create a surface no homogeneous. To resolve the layer uniformity problem, a PFN material was used and deposited on the LiF surface. Interesting results of devices with the configuration ITO/PFN (type III) without the LiF layer, ITO/LiF (type IV) without the PFN layer and ITO/without the ETL show the performance parameters of PCE ∼ 10.42%, 9.11% and 8.00%, JSC ∼ 18.39 mA cm−2, 18.15 mA cm−2 and 18.60 mA cm−2, VOC ∼ 0.785 V, 0.770 V and 0.694 V, FF ∼ 72.17%, 65.22% and 61.95% and RS ∼ 0.71 Ω cm2, 3.39 Ω cm2 and 2.37 Ω cm2, respectively. The highest RS and decrease of PCE obtained for devices with the stack ITO/LiF is attributed to the bad quality of contacts formed at the interface of both materials given as an answer for high charge recombination and the leakage current increment. For devices without the ETL, the PCE fell by 27% regarding the type I-B structure. These results suggest that with or without the additional layer on the previously deposited films the RS is substantially modified and affects the FF parameter.

It has been shown that the experimental J–V characteristics of the five structures can be modelled using the standard electrical circuit of the solar cell and both curves are in good agreement. The values extracted from the model (i.e. J0, n, RS, and RSH) were related to the physical mechanisms of charge transport and the conductivity of each device according to the type of ETL and are governed inside the device. The experimental values of VOC and FF were modelled as a function of J0 and parasitic resistances, respectively, showing an excellent approximation. We have seen that at a low equivalent work function and low J0 high VOC and high PCE are reached. Optical effects such as absorbance, reflectance and IPCE were analyzed for all devices. The IPCE values are in the range of ∼83% to 88% at a wavelength of 520 nm for the first three structures. The increase in PCE is due to reduced series resistances compared to recombination losses as suggested by photoinduced measurements.
Most notably, this is the first study to our knowledge to investigate the effect of ETLs on the photovoltaic devices using a halide salt in combination with organic materials as the buffer layer. We conclude that the type of stack configured using LiF, PFN or combination of these materials depending on its position in relation to the metal contact can or cannot have a favorable influence on the extraction or injection of the charge carriers toward the metallic contact, because it can result in better or worse interfacial contacts (i.e. increase or decrease of the contact resistances) and is also dependent on factors such as the quality of the materials, the fabrication process, layer thickness, technology and even how the solar cells are characterized. The use of other halide salts to fabricate solar cells offers a simple, promising route to improve the performance parameters which opens up new possibilities for use in new polymers for manufacturing OSCs.

Poly(2-ethylhexyl 6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-3fluorothienol[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate) (PBDTTT-EFT or also named PTB7-TH or PCE10) and poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) materials were purchased from One-material Company with Mw ∼ 114.00 kg mol−1 and Mw ∼ 44.5 kg mol−1, respectively. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl (PC70BM) with Mw ∼ 1031.0 g mol−1 was purchased from Solenne BV. Patterned indium thin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were purchased from PsiOTec Ltd. High-purity (99.99%) silver (Ag) wire was obtained from Testbourne Ltd. Vanadium oxide (V2O5) and lithium fluoride (LiF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.


Inverted devices were based on the structure of ITO/electron buffer layers (EBFLs)/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag. The inverted photovoltaic devices were fabricated on patterned ITO glass substrates which were cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol and then rinsed with deionized H2O. Different EBFLs were deposited on top of the pre-cleaned ITO substrate creating five structures being PFN/LiF, LiF/PFN, PFN, LiF, and without an EBFL and tagged as type I, type II, type III, type IV and type V structures, respectively. The PFN polymer material was dissolved using methanol in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid (2 μL mL−1) and its solution (concentration, 2 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the previously deposited layer at 3500 rpm for 60 s to get 10 nm. LiF was deposited by thermal evaporation in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (5 × 10−7 mbar) at a rate of 0.01 kÅ s−1 to get layer thicknesses of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 nm deposited on type I and type II structures. LiF in a type III structure was only deposited with the optimized layer that was 0.6 nm. The PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM active blend with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (CB:DIO = 97:3 by volume) to get 25 mg mL−1 of the total solution and left stirring overnight. The blend solution was deposited on top of the EBFL layer by spin coating at 800 rpm for 30 s, obtaining the thickness of 100 nm. Afterwards, the anode layer was deposited consisting of 5 nm of V2O5 and 100 nm of Ag by thermal evaporation in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (5 × 10−7 mbar) at a rate of 0.05 kÅ s−1 and 0.1–0.4 kÅ s−1 on top of the active layer, respectively. The active area of the device was 0.09 cm2 as defined by the geometric overlap between ITO and Ag. No further annealing was done on the solar cells after the evaporation of metallic contacts.


The absorbance and reflectance spectra were measured at room temperature with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer using an integrating sphere. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under light and darkness of the devices were measured at room temperature using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit in combination with a solar simulator (Abet Technologies model 11000 class type A, Xenon arc), automatically controlled with a computer. Appropriate filters were used to reproduce the AM 1.5G spectrum. A light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) was applied to test the organic solar cell devices under illumination. The light intensity was calibrated with an NREL certified monocrystalline silicon photodiode. All the film thicknesses were measured using a Dektak 150 surface profilometer. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured illuminating the device through the light source from a tungsten filament (Newport 250 W QTH) through a monochromator (Oriel Corneston 130). Light intensities of less than 1 mW cm−2 were used with short-circuit current recorded (condition, V = 0 V) using a Keithley 2635 source measurement unit. The system was calibrated by placing a calibrated photodiode in the device in the test position.

CE was used to determine the distribution of charge carrier densities (n) in devices under different conditions of light and voltage. The general CE procedure is to leave the device under open circuit conditions while illuminating at different intensities. Then, the device is shorted while simultaneously turning off the light, and the resulting discharge current transient through a small external load resistor is measured. The desired illumination intensity is achieved with a white light LED ring from LUXEON® Lumileds connected to a DC power supply and a TGP110 function generator that allows the LEDs to reach a background illumination up to 1 sun on the ITO side of the device. The LEDs were typically turned on for approximately 100 ms so that they could reach steady state conditions. The LEDs have a rise/fall time of <100 ns. After the light is switched off and the circuit is temporarily closed, charges are forced to pass through a TDS 2022 oscilloscope from Tektronix© that records the drop in voltage across a resistance of 50 Ω.
In TPV measurements, the devices are connected to the 1 MΩ input terminal of a Tektronix© TDS2022 oscilloscope and the background illumination was obtained from a ring of 6 white LEDs from LUXEON®. The small perturbation (5 mV) was applied through a light pulse (N2 laser nominal wavelength, 50 ns pulses). The charge recombination rate was calculated for illumination intensities ranging from 0.1 sun to 1 sun.
