A 4-octyloxy-carbazole-2,7-diyl unit was newly developed, and was combined with dithienylbenzothiadiazole derivatives by using the Suzuki-coupling reaction to synthesize good processable donor-π-acceptor type copolymers. The monosubstitution at the 4-position of carbazolylene was not only effective to solubilize the narrow band gap copolymers in usual organic solvents but also could greatly improve their processability for device fabrication. All the polymers maintained the fundamental properties of carbazole–dithienylbenzothiadiazole copolymers such as good thermal stability, a narrow band gap of about 1.8 eV, a polymer interchain distance of 16–17 Å, a π-stacking distance of 3.5–4.1 Å and hole mobilities of 8.6 × 10−4–5.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. A bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic device composed of the fluorinated copolymer and fullerene (PC70BM) with the active layer thickness of about 100 nm exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.4% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.6 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.56 and an open circuit voltage of 0.670 V. This polymer based device could sustain its photovoltaic performance even at a larger thickness of the active layer of about 200 nm, i.e. a PCE of 4.50% with a Jsc of 14.44 mA cm−2. The maximum incident photon to current conversion efficiency of this device was 80% at about 530 nm, which was the highest among other carbazole-copolymer-based devices.

Poly(carbazole-2,7-diyl)s have been investigated as light emitting materials for organic light-emitting diodes due to their high quantitative fluorescence quantum efficiency, good solubility in organic solvents and superior EL performance. Recently, carbazole derivatives have been gaining much attention as donor-building blocks for donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) narrow band gap copolymers for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). According to the D-π-A strategy, carbazole based narrow band gap copolymers have been developed by incorporating various strong electron-accepting units to improve the photovoltaic performance. Above all, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) shown in Fig. 1 is one of the most successful D-π-A type copolymers because of its low energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and high stability against oxidation. It has been reported that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PCDTBT based BHJ solar cells with the standard device architecture was 4.6%, which could be improved by controlling the morphology of the active layer. However, despite the outstanding high PCE, PCDTBT has a rather low hole mobility (μh) and a large band gap (Eg) compared to typical narrow band gap copolymers that exhibited high photovoltaic performance, which led to the unfavourable small short-circuit current density (Jsc). According to the D-π-A strategy, introduction of a stronger electron-accepting unit, such as benzobisthiadiazole, [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline and naphthobisthiadiazole, than 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole is one of the powerful methods to construct narrower band gap polymers. Meanwhile, these thiadiazole based copolymers are hardly soluble in common organic solvents because of strong intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains into which effective solubilizing side chains could be hardly introduced. Due to their poor solubility, weight average molecular weight (Mw) values of D-π-A type copolymers composed of carbazole and [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline used for OPVs were only less than 5100 Da, although these polymers showed a sufficiently narrow Eg of about 1.1 eV. Therefore, the development of a carbazole unit which can enhance the solubility of the polymer in organic solvents is necessary in order to obtain good soluble D-π-A type narrow band gap copolymers composed of thiadiazole derivatives. As one of the approaches for solubilizing polymers, introduction of alkyl chains into 3,6-positions of carbazole has been reported. Poly(3,6-dimethyl-9-alkyl-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)s were sufficiently soluble in organic solvents such as THF, CH2Cl2 and CHCl3, whereas the modification at 3,6-positions resulted in reducing π-conjugation along the main chain due to the large steric hindrance and widened Eg of the polymers. Under these circumstances, we consider that modification at the 4-position of carbazole is an approach to improve the solubility of the polymers without large steric hindrance, which allows one to obtain processable narrow band gap copolymers consisting of various thiadiazole derivatives by overcoming the drawbacks of PCDTBT.

In this paper, we designed a novel 2,7-dibromocarbazole monomer with an octyloxy side chain at the 4-position, and synthesized two D-π-A type conjugated copolymers, poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-4-octyloxy-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5-diyl] (PCOC8-TBT) and poly[9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-4-octyloxy-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(thiophene-2-yl)-5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5-diyl] (PCOC8-TBTF1) as shown in Fig. 1, to confirm the fundamental properties and characteristics of photovoltaics.


1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL JNM-ECS 400 at a resonance frequency of 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C in CDCl3. IR spectra of the polymers were recorded on a NICOLET iS5 FT-IR (Thermo Scientific). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the polymers were measured on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer and a U-3100 (HITACHI) spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) of the polymers was recorded on a FP-6500 (Jasco) spectrofluorometer. The elemental analyses of C, H, and N were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the polymers in the solid state was performed under argon at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a Seiko EXSTAR7000. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of drop-cast polymer films were carried out using a Rigaku MiniFlex600. The number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of the chloroform soluble fraction of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) calibrated with polystyrene standards using chloroform as an eluent at room temperature. The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) using an AC-3 spectrometer (Riken Keiki). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement of the surface morphology of samples was conducted on a Nanocute (SII NanoTechnology Inc.) in tapping mode.

PCOC8-TBTF1 was synthesized from M1 (110 mg, 0.140 mmol) and M3 (66 mg, 0.140 mmol) in the same way adopted for PCOC8-TBT. After cooling to room temperature, the polymeric products were precipitated from methanol. The precipitates were successively extracted with methanol, acetone, hexane, chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) by Soxhlet extraction. The oDCB extract was again precipitated from methanol.

The device structure of a glass/Au gate electrode/parylene-C insulator substrate was prepared according to a previously reported procedure. The parylene-C layer was deposited with thickness ranging from 1248 to 1504 nm. The dielectric capacitance of the insulating layer per unit area ranged from 2.27 to 1.88 nF cm−2. The solutions of the polymers in oDCB were spin-coated onto the parylene-C layer. The substrate was transferred to a glovebox and was dried for 10 min at 110 °C. The source and drain Au electrodes (40 nm) were deposited on the polymer films through shadow masks (channel length = 75 μm, channel width = 5 mm). The transfer characteristics (measured at a drain voltage of −100 V) of the OFETs based on PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 were measured using a Keithley 2636A System source meter.


The BHJ solar cells were fabricated in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The patterned ITO (conductivity 10 Ω per square) glass was precleaned by ultrasonication in acetone and successively in ethanol. The precleaned ITO glass was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber. A thin layer (40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO at 3000 rpm and air-dried at 110 °C for 10 min on a hot plate under a N2 atmosphere. The solutions of the polymers and PC70BM at various blending ratios in oDCB were subsequently spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS. The BHJ layers were dried at 110 °C for 10 min. LiF (1 nm) and Al (80 nm) were deposited on the BHJ layer with conventional thermal evaporation at the chamber pressure lower than 5 × 10−4 Pa, which provided the devices with an active area of 5 × 2 mm2. The thicknesses of BHJ and PEDOT:PSS layers were measured using an automatic microfigure measuring instrument (Surfcorder ET200, Kosaka Laboratory Ltd). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using an ADCMT 6244 DC voltage current source/monitor under an AM 1.5 solar-simulated light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Pin) (OTENTO-SUN III, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd). The PCEs of solar cells based on the polymers were determined by the equation PCE = (Jsc × Voc × FF)/(Pin). These organic photovoltaic (OPV) parameters were calculated at the average of the measured results of more than three OPV cells. The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured using an SM-250 system (Bunkoh-Keiki Co., Ltd).


The optimized geometries of C-TBT, COC1-TBT and COC1-TBTF1 as models of PCDTBT, PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 were calculated by density functional theory (DFT), which are shown in Fig. 2. The dihedral angles between the carbazole and the thiophene units of C-TBT, COC1-TBT and COC1-TBTF1 were 27.52°, 28.10° and 27.72°, respectively, and were almost the same. Thus, it is considered that the alkoxy group at the 4-position of carbazole does not induce large torsion between the carbazole and thiophene units. In addition, the dihedral angle between the thiophene and benzothiadiazole units of COC1-TBTF1 was 1.02°, which is smaller than that of COC1-TBT. Generally, the planar conformation of the polymer backbone contributes to expand π-conjugation and facilitate π-stacking, which is favorable to achieve narrow band gap and high carrier mobility. It has been reported that the fluorinated oligothiophene exhibited the small dihedral angle (less than 1°) between the neighboring thiophene units probably due to the inductive effect of fluorine. Similarly, several theoretical and experimental studies have shown that fluorinated dithienylbenzothiadiazole units favour planar conformation. Therefore, it is expected that fluorine at the benzothiadiazole unit could contribute to take planar conformation of PCOC8-TBTF1.


A route for the syntheses of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 is shown in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was synthesized from 2-fluoro-4-bromoiodobenzene in the presence of t-BuOK by nucleophilic substitution of 1-octanol. Lithiation of 1 followed by monoborolation selectively yielded 2. The Suzuki coupling reaction between 2 and 2,5-dibromonitrobenzene in a 1:1 ratio yielded precursor 3, which was cyclized by a ring closure reaction to form 4. An alkylation of the nitrogen position of 4 with 9-heptadecane p-toluenesulfonate yielded 5, which was successively diborolated in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 to give the key monomer M1. PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 were obtained over 80% yields by Suzuki coupling from the corresponding monomers. After polymerization, the terminal tails of the polymers were capped with a phenyl group.


PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 were highly soluble in common organic solvents such as oDCB and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. For example, 2 mg of PCOC8-TBT was fully soluble in 0.2 ml of oDCB, whereas 2 mg of PCDTBT (Mn = 15.0 kg mol−1) was not completely soluble in 0.2 ml of oDCB at 40 °C. This superior solubility is due to the alkyl side chain at the 4-position of the carbazole unit. Mn and polydispersity (Mw/Mn) were 14.7 kg mol−1 and 1.2 for PCOC8-TBT and 9.1 kg mol−1 and 1.1 for PCOC8-TBTF1, respectively. Note that these molecular weights are the data for soluble parts of the respective polymers in chloroform at room temperature. TGA of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 showed that temperatures of 5 wt% loss were 405 °C and 401 °C, respectively (Fig. 1S in the ESI), which are almost the same as that of PCDTBT.


Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 with a reference data of PCDTBT, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The absorption maximum (λmax) of PCOC8-TBT in oDCB was observed at 558 nm, which was almost the same as that of PCDTBT. Assuming that PCOC8-TBT takes a conformation similar to PCDTBT as shown in Fig. 2, it is apparent that the octyloxy group at the 4-position of the carbazole unit slightly affects the magnitude of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). On the other hand, PCOC8-TBTF1 in oDCB showed a photoabsorption band over a range of longer wavelengths compared to PCOC8-TBT and PCDTBT, which could be attributed to stronger ICT effects and higher planarity of the thiophene–benzothiadiazole unit. In the film state, PCOC8-TBT showed λmax originated in ICT and absorption onset (λonset) at 593 and 673 nm, respectively, which were almost the same values as those of PCDTBT (λmax of 581 nm and λonset of 652 nm). In contrast, the thin film of PCOC8-TBTF1 exhibited a larger bathochromic shift compared to PCOC8-TBT and a pronounced peak with λmax at 641 nm, which is probably due to π–π stacking of the polymer backbone. As a result, PCOC8-TBTF1 showed a narrower Eg of 1.76 eV compared to PCOC8-TBT (Eg = 1.84 eV). In fact, similar absorption peaks attributed to π–π stacking have been observed in many conjugated polymers, especially in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). It is noted that a fluorinated PCDTBT consisting of carbazole and 5-fluorodithienylbenzothiadiazole reported previously has exhibited a shorter λmax at 573 nm without any shoulder band in the longer wavelength region. Thus, in addition to the planar conformation of PCOC8-TBTF1 predicted by the theoretical calculation as shown in Fig. 2c, the octyloxy side chain at the 4-position of the carbazole might contribute to form π–π stacking of the polymer backbone with the assistance of noncovalent attractions.

Fig. 4 shows the PL spectra of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1. The emission maxima (λmax) of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 in oDCB were observed at 688 and 711 nm, and the fluorescence quantum yields (ϕPL) were 0.52 and 0.34, respectively. Compared to these PL data, PCOC8-TBT and PCC8-TBTF1 in the film state showed redshifts of λmax of about 34 nm and 15 nm and ϕPL values of 4.3 × 10−2 and 2.0 × 10−2. The ϕPL values of these polymer films were somewhat higher than that of P3HT (ϕPL < 1 × 10−2).

XRD analyses were performed to investigate the structural order of the polymers in the film state. Two diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 5.27° and 21.3° (d1 = 16.7, d2 = 4.16 Å) for PCOC8-TBT and 2θ = 5.37° and 24.9° (d1 = 16.4 Å, d2 = 3.57 Å) for PCOC8-TBTF1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. The former diffractions correspond to the interchain distance between the polymer backbones separated by the side chains while the latter peaks correspond to the π-stacking distance between the planar polymer backbones. Interestingly, the interchain distances of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 were almost the same as that of PCDTBT (2θ = 5.26°, d1 = 16.7 Å), although the additional side chain was present at the 4-position of the carbazole unit. This result suggests that the octyloxy side chain at the 4-position of poly(2,7-cabazole) does not interfere with the side chain packing of the polymers in the interdigitated interchain space. On the other hand, PCOC8-TBTF1 showed a significantly smaller π-stacking distance of 3.57 Å compared with those of PCOC8-TBT and PCDTBT (2θ = 21.7°, d2 = 4.08 Å), indicating that the polymer backbone of PCOC8-TBTF1 takes a planar conformation in the solid state. These results support that the additional shoulder band at 641 nm in the absorption spectrum of PCOC8-TBTF1 shown in Fig. 3b was attributed to π–π stacking of the polymer backbone.


The EHOMO values of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 were estimated from their onset of photoelectron spectra in the atmosphere (Fig. 2S in the ESI), and the results are summarized in Table 1. The EHOMO of PCOC8-TBT was estimated at about −5.15 eV, which was higher than the EHOMO of PCDTBT (−5.35 eV). The strong donating ability of the octyloxy group at the 4-position of carbazole brings about the shallow EHOMO. This result is in accord with the tendency to shallow EHOMO of the polymers with alkoxy groups. Unexpectedly, PCOC8-TBTF1 exhibited a higher EHOMO of −4.99 eV than that of PCOC8-TBT, although it has been recognized that introducing a fluorine group is one of the effective way to deepen the EHOMO of the polymers. The shallow EHOMO of PCOC8-TBTF1 is probably due to the π–π stacking of the polymer backbone, which simultaneously narrows the Eg and shallow the EHOMO. The energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 estimated from their Eg and EHOMO were situated at −3.31 and −3.23 eV, respectively, which are sufficiently higher than the ELUMO of PCBM (−4.3 eV). Accordingly, it is expected that charge separation could occur at interfaces between the polymer and PCBM.


BHJ solar cells were fabricated by spin coating of oDCB solutions of the polymers containing PC70BM on an ITO glass coated with PEDOT:PSS. The BHJ layer was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min, and LiF (1 nm) and Al (80 nm) were successively deposited on the BHJ layer to make the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/LiF/Al. The Jsc, open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 based devices were investigated by measuring the J–V curves under an AM 1.5 solar-simulated light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. Typical results are summarized in Table 2 and the J–V curves for the PCOC8-TBT:PC70BM (1:4) and PCOC8-TBTF1:PC70BM (1:4) based devices are shown in Fig. 6.

Firstly, the photovoltaic characteristics of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 based BHJ OPVs with the active layer thickness of less than about 100 nm were investigated. When the composition ratio of PCOC8-TBT to PC70BM was 1:3, the average PCE (PCEav) of five OPV cells with the active layer thickness of 79 nm was 3.3% with a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.82 V and FF of 0.44. The PCEav increased to 4.0% when the composition ratio was changed to 1:4, which is due to the increase of Jsc and FF. Accordingly, the continual route for electrons and holes to reach the electrodes was formed by optimizing the ratio of PCOC8-TBT and PC70BM mixtures. On the other hand, the BHJ OPV consisting of PCOC8-TBTF1 and PC70BM (1:3) with an active layer thickness of 97 nm showed a PCEav of 4.5% with a Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.666 V and FF of 0.57, which was almost the same as PCEav of the device with the blending ratio of 1:4. In comparison with PCOC8-TBT, the BHJ OPV consisting of PCOC8-TBTF1 exhibited higher Jsc and FF, which led to higher PCEav. However, Voc was still low, which could be due to the high lying EHOMO of PCOC8-TBTF1. In addition, these results are comparable to the optimized performance of PCDTBT based devices with the same architecture characterized by the relatively high Voc and rather low FF (PCEopt = 4.57%, Jsc = 10.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V and FF = 0.51, active layer thickness = 70 nm).
In order to investigate the values of Jsc and FF of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 based BHJ OPVs, surface morphologies of spin-coating films of the polymer:PC70BM (1:4) blends with the thickness of less than about 100 nm were observed by AFM. Both the AFM topographic images in Fig. 7 show refined morphologies without pronounced phase separations on the microscale. The BHJ structure must have a comparable nanoscale structure to be an effective solar cell since the exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors is only about 10 nm. Accordingly, efficient charge separation of excitons at the interfaces between the polymer and PC70BM is expected to occur in these blend films with phase separation on the nanoscale.
To gain more insight into the different performances between the devices based on PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1, the effect of carrier mobility was investigated. The μh of the polymers were measured by the method of OFETs, and these transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. 8. The OFETs based on these polymers exhibited typical p-type semiconductor behaviours with good linear and saturation characteristics. The μh of these polymers were calculated from the slope of the plot of the square root of the drain current versus the gate voltage, and PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 showed μh of 8.6 × 10−4 and 5.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with on/off ratios of 1.3 × 104 and 2.4 × 104, respectively. It is considered that the π–π stacking effect observed for PCOC8-TBTF1 shown in Fig. 3 and 5 might contribute to enhancing the charge transport. The low hole mobility is responsible for increasing the recombination of separated charges and series resistance in an active layer of BHJ OPVs, which lead to low Jsc and FF. Thus, the higher Jsc and FF of the BHJ devices using PCOC8-TBTF1 are ascribed to the higher μh than that of PCOC8-TBT.
Since BHJ OPVs that can constantly work with high PCE without depending on the thickness of the active layer are desired for practical application, the effect of the active layer thickness on the performance of PCOC8-TBT and PCOC8-TBTF1 based devices was investigated. The device consisting of PCOC8-TBT and PC70BM (1:4) with the active layer thickness of 104 nm showed a PCEav of 2.8%, which is lower than that of the device with the active layer thickness of 77 nm as listed in Table 2. It has also been reported that the PCE of the PCDTBT based OPV decreased from 4.22% to 3.43% by making the BHJ layer thicker from 80 to 100 nm. The decrease in PCEav is mainly caused by the lowering Jsc and FF, which might be ascribed to increased collection losses of the generated charge carriers by increasing the charge recombination and series resistance in the thicker active layer. Thus, a low μh of electron-donating conjugated polymers often limits the thickness of the active layers in BHJ OPVs. However, PCEav of the OPV devices using PCOC8-TBTF1 were maintained even though the thickness of the active layer increased up to about 200 nm as listed in Table 2. When the active layer of PCOC8-TBTF1:PC70BM (1:4) device was thickened from 102 to 206 nm, FF decreased from 0.56 to 0.481 whereas Jsc increased from 11.6 to 14.44 mA cm−2. Consequently, these changes led to the improvement in PCEav from 4.4 to 4.50% (Fig. 6). This improvement is mainly due to the increase of the absorbed amount of photons by making the active layer thicker. Additionally, the higher μh of 5.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCOC8-TBTF1 than PCOC8-TBT and PCDTBT (μh = 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) must allow the PCOC8-TBTF1 based BHJ OPV to maintain its performance even in the thick active layer.
Lastly, the ratio between the number of signal electrons and the number of all the incident photons at a given wavelength for the BHJ devices of PCOC8-TBT:PC70BM (1:4) and PCOC8-TBTF1:PC70BM (1:4) were measured, and their IPCE curves are shown in Fig. 9. These devices were found to show efficient sensitization over the whole visible light region. The PCOC8-TBTF1 based device with the active layer thickness of 102 nm displayed higher IPCE response (maximum IPCE = 68%, Jsc = 11.6 mA cm−2) than that of PCOC8-TBT (maximum IPCE = 65%, Jsc = 9.9 mA cm−2), which is due to the narrower Eg and the higher μh of PCOC8-TBTF1. The PCOC8-TBTF1:PC70BM device with the thickness of 206 nm exhibited maximum IPCE of 80.36% (Jsc = 14.44 mA cm−2) at 530 nm, and IPCE covered over 70% in the range of 370–600 nm, which is higher than that of PCDTBT based BHJ OPVs, e.g., it has been reported that the PCDTBT based device using TiOx as an optical spacer showed the maximum IPCE of at most 70% (PCE = 6.1%, Jsc = 10.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.88 and FF = 0.66). These results demonstrated that the PCOC8-TBTF1:PC70BM device can efficiently convert absorbed photons into current over a range of visible light.


PCDTBT is a typical D-π-A type copolymer composed of the carbazole and dithienylbenzothiadiazole (TBT) units, and has exhibited a PCE of OPV over 7%. However, the low solubility of PCDTBT in organic solvents has caused limitation of polymer design and synthesis, which leads to stagnation of the OPV performance. Improvement of the solubility by retaining the characteristic features of PCDTBT must break through the stagnation on the performance of the PCDTBT based devices. An idea of developing a solubilizing donor unit was a starting point of this work, and it was decided to synthesize an N-alkylcarbazole-2,7-diyl unit with a substituent at the 4-position that must serve as the solubilizing part. The DFT calculation supported that the 4-substituted carbazole could construct a planar D-π-A copolymer as well as PCDTBT.

An N-(1-octylnonyl)-4-octyloxycarbazole-2,7-diyl unit was successfully synthesized by the stepwise method for the first time, and it was polycondensed with the TBT unit to obtain PCOC8-TBT. Similarly, PCOC8-TBTF1 having a fluoro group at the 5-position of TBT was also synthesized. The fundamental properties of PCOC8-TBTs were examined and compared with those of PCDTBT. PCOC8-TBT showed better solubility while its extension of π-conjugation and polymer structures evaluated by UV-Vis and XRD analyses were comparable to those of PCDTBT as expected. Furthermore, it was revealed that PCOC8-TBTF1 had superior characteristics with the narrower band gap (Eg = 1.76 eV) and higher hole transportability (μh = 5.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to PCDTBT and PCOC8-TBT, which could be interpreted by the closer π–π stacking of the polymer backbones with higher coplanarity.
All the BHJ solar cells fabricated with PCOC8-TBTs and PC70BM exhibited good photovoltaic performances showing PCEav in the range of 2.8–4.5%. Especially, the PCOC8-TBTF1 based OPV device could maintain its photovoltaic performance, or rather, improve in PCEav from 4.3% to 4.5%, when the active layer was made thicker from ca. 100 to 200 nm. This result could be ascribed to the higher IPCE of over 70% in the whole visible light region and the higher Jsc value of over 14 mA cm−2 observed in the thicker device. Hence, it is concluded that the additional introduction of a substituent at the 4-position of the carbazole unit was proved to be effective to obtain processable carbazole-based semiconducting polymers which could exhibit the characteristics and functions required for high performance organic devices.
