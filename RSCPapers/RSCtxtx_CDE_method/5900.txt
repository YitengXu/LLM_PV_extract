An annealing-free hole transport layer based on oxygen deficient molybdenum oxide (MoO3−x) nanosheets was developed for polymer solar cells. It showed performance comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS. For better hole extraction, graphene oxide (GO) was introduced to form a GO/MoO3−x bilayer as a hole transport layer to further improve the device performance.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their low cost and roll-to-roll fabrication. Now the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single- and triple-junction PSCs has reached 10.8% and 11.8%, respectively. The device performance depends not only on photoactive materials, morphologies, and device architectures, but also on the interfacial layers (ILs). ILs, including hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs), are utilized to optimize energy level matching at the electrode/active layer interface, facilitating charge carrier extraction. For the conventional bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a common HTL, but its acidity and hygroscopicity cause device degradation. Therefore, transition metal oxides with high work function and good ambient stability were used to replace PEDOT:PSS. Among them, solution-processable oxygen deficient molybdenum oxide (MoO3−x) is particularly interesting, mainly due to its high conductivity and high work function. Choy et al. and Vasilopoulou et al. reported MoO3−x and hydrogen molybdenum bronzes as HTLs for PSCs, respectively. However, these HTLs require thermal treatments up to 190 °C, which are not suitable for the fabrication on plastic substrates. Many reports emphasized the high work function of MoO3−x for efficient hole extraction at the HTL/organic interface, while the hole-extraction barrier at the ITO/HTL interface has rarely been discussed and addressed. On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have been used as HTLs in PSCs. MoO3 can also be exfoliated into 2D nanosheets. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in MoO3 nanosheets endows them with better properties. The charge carrier mobility of 11 nm thick MoO3−x nanosheets was measured to be as high as 1100 cm2 V−1 s−1. Here, we report solution-processable MoO3−x nanosheets and GO/MoO3−x bilayers as HTLs for PSCs. Using annealing-free MoO3−x HTLs, P3HT:PC61BM or PThBDTP:PC71BM solar cells (Fig. S1) showed performances comparable to those of PEDOT cells. To deal with the hole-extraction barrier at the ITO/HTL interface, an ultrathin (<2 nm) layer of less defective GO prepared at a low temperature (ESI) was inserted between ITO and MoO3−x, forming a GO/MoO3−x bilayer HTL (Scheme 1), and the device performance was improved, better than that of the cells with MoO3−x or PEDOT:PSS HTL.

MoO3−x nanosheets were prepared via a facile two-step process, including liquid exfoliation and irradiation. The nanosheets were thoroughly characterized (Fig. S2–S5). They have lateral dimensions of several tens of nanometers to ∼150 nm, and thicknesses less than 4 nm, indicating that each nanosheet consists of less than 3 layers (the thickness of single layer α-MoO3 is ∼1.4 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicate that the atomic ratio of Mo and O in MoO3−x is about 1:2.75.
AFM images of an ITO surface before and after spin-coating with the dispersion of MoO3−x nanosheets (2 mg mL−1) are shown in Fig. S6. The MoO3−x film has a smaller RMS roughness of 1.98 nm than that of the surface of bare ITO (2.69 nm). It has a transmittance comparable to that of a PEDOT:PSS film and its transmittance at long wavelengths (>629 nm) is even higher than that of the latter (Fig. 1a). The optical bandgap (Eopt) of the MoO3−x film can be obtained according to Tauc's formula by plotting (αhν)1/2 against hν (Fig. 1b, where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the photon frequency).Eopt was evaluated to be about 3.1 eV by extending the linear portion of the plot to the photon energy axis.
The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the MoO3−x film are shown in Fig. 1c (secondary-electron cut-off region) and Fig. 1d (valence band edge region). Fig. S7 shows the whole UPS spectrum. The high binding energy cut-off was found to be 15.8 eV (Fig. 1c), corresponding to a work function of 5.4 eV. The valence band maximum is at 2.9 eV below the Fermi level (Fig. 1d), indicating an ionization energy (IE) of 8.3 eV. Notably, there are gap states around 2.1 eV below the Fermi level. The electron affinity (EA) of MoO3−x was estimated to be 5.2 eV. Accordingly, the energy level diagram of MoO3−x is illustrated in Fig. 2 and S8.
To evaluate the function of the MoO3−x HTL in PSCs, P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with a structure of ITO/HTL/P3HT:PC61BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The effects of the MoO3−x film thickness and annealing temperature on device performance were studied (Tables S1 and S2). The optimized thickness of the MoO3−x film is about ∼7 nm. The cells with the as-prepared or annealed MoO3−x films showed comparable performances, suggesting that annealing is not necessary. J–V curves of the best devices are shown in Fig. 3a and the performance parameters are listed in Table 1. MoO3−x cells gave a PCE of 3.72%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.62 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.95 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 67%, and these values are close to those of PEDOT cells (PCE = 3.70%, Voc = 0.64 V, Jsc = 8.78 mA cm−2, and FF = 66%). The good device performance possibly resulted from the gap states of MoO3−x. The high conductivity of the MoO3−x film might account for the low series resistance (Rs, 9.3 Ω cm2). When the MoO3−x HTL was applied in PThBDTP:PC71BM solar cells, a PCE of 7.52% and a Jsc of 12.36 mA cm−2 were obtained (Fig. 3b and Table 1). This performance is also comparable to that of PEDOT cells.

The hole-extraction barrier at the ITO/MoO3−x interface (Fig. 2a and S8a) might cause insufficient hole extraction, non-negligible charge carrier recombination and/or current leakage. To address this issue, a GO layer was inserted between the ITO and MoO3−x films, forming a GO/MoO3−x bilayer as the HTL (Fig. S6e and f). The GO/MoO3−x bilayer on ITO (Fig. S6g and h) showed a surface morphology similar to that of a single MoO3−x film on ITO (Fig. S6c and d) with a slightly increased RMS roughness (2.09 nm). This is possibly due to the wrinkles of GO sheets. The LUMO and HOMO levels of GO were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S9 and Table S3). The work function of GO (4.9 eV) is located between those of MoO3−x (5.4 eV) and ITO (4.7 eV) (Fig. 2b and S8b), forming a favorable energy level gradient for fast and efficient hole extraction and transport. By using GO/MoO3−x HTLs, P3HT:PC61BM solar cells gave an enhanced PCE of 4.08% with Voc (0.63 V), Jsc (9.12 mA cm−2) and FF (71%) higher than those of the cells with MoO3−x HTLs (Fig. 3a and Table 1). The extremely high FF (71%) resulted from the high shunt resistance (Rsh, 2289.3 Ω cm2) of the device, confirming that the GO interlayer improved hole extraction and suppressed charge recombination and current leakage. PThBDTP:PC71BM cells with GO/MoO3−x HTLs gave a decent PCE of 8.05%, better than those of MoO3−x and PEDOT cells. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of solar cells with different HTLs are shown in Fig. S10.
The stabilities of unencapsulated P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with GO/MoO3−x and PEDOT:PSS HTLs were studied. The cells were stored in a N2 glovebox after measurements. GO/MoO3−x cells retained 70% of their initial PCE after 40 days (Fig. 4). In contrast, PEDOT cells retained 30% of their initial PCE after 10 days, and the cells did not work after 40 days. The acidity of PEDOT:PSS led to fast device degradation.
In summary, MoO3−x nanosheets were prepared via solution processing and used as HTLs in PSCs. The performances of MoO3−x cells are comparable to those of PEDOT cells. GO was inserted between ITO and MoO3−x to form a favorable energy level gradient for fast and efficient hole extraction and transport. With GO/MoO3−x HTLs, P3HT:PC61BM and PThBDTP:PC71BM solar cells gave good PCEs of 4.08% and 8.05%, respectively. GO/MoO3−x HTLs also help to improve the stability of P3HT:PC61BM cells. This work demonstrates the potential of GO/MoO3−x HTLs in developing highly efficient PSCs.
