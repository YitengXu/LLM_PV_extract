ZIF-8 polystyrenesulfonate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS) is prepared and used as the alternative counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on I−/I3− and Co2+/Co3+ redox mediators. It is found that incorporation of ZIF-8 in PEDOT:PSS results in boosting the catalytic activity and charge transferability of the ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composite toward the reduction of I3− and Co3+ redox mediators compared with pristine PEDOT:PSS. The assembled DSSCs based on the (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composite CE in iodide-based cells yield 7.02% photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) which is comparable to that of the conventional platinum CE (PCE = 7.24%) and better than that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS (PCE = 4.00%) CE. In addition, the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE shows a PCE of 6.84% for cobalt-based DSSCs which is comparable to that of Pt (PCE = 7.56%).

Since 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted attention as promising alternatives to the traditional silicon solar cells due to their low cost, flexibility, relatively high conversion efficiency and simple manufacturing processes. A standard DSSC is comprised of mesoporous TiO2 loaded with dye as photoanode, an electrolyte containing a redox couple, usually iodide/tri-iodide (I3−/I−), and a counter electrode (CE). The CE collects electrons from the external wires and catalyzes the redox reduction of I3− for regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules. Although Pt is the conventional CE used in DSSCs, the high cost and corrosion in the presence of iodide electrolytes still remain challenges to large-scale application. Although different materials including conducting polymers, carbon materials, alloys, and transition metal compounds have been utilized as promising alternative CEs in DSSCs, the synthesis of these materials usually requires toxic solvents, high temperature, and sometimes inert atmospheric conditions. Therefore, low-cost materials with simple preparation methods are urgently needed. Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a porous crystalline material with high surface area and high thermal and chemical stability have attracted attention in different applications such as hydrogen uptake, catalysis, CO2 conversion, supercapacitors, and DSSCs. The zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is a famous subclass of MOFs composed of tetrahedrally coordinated metal ions and organic ligands. Although calcination of ZIFs in an inert atmosphere has been successfully applied to prepare amorphous carbon derived from ZIFs with a high surface area and high efficiency comparable or superior to Pt CE, such high temperature limits the application in flexible substrates, as well as consumes time and energy during preparation, which reflects on the total cost of the DSSCs. Therefore, we used ZIF-8 without calcination as CE in DSSCs. Conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS was used as a conductive binder and the obtained slurry was coated on a conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate via spin coating. In this work, ZIF-8 is applied for the first time as CE in cobalt electrolyte DSSCs. Based on the high surface area of ZIF-8 and high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, as well as the simple and low-cost preparation method of ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composite CEs, the total performances of the assembled DSSCs based on iodine and cobalt electrolytes are comparable to that of traditional Pt–DSSCs.


ZIF-8 was prepared according to previous literature. In brief, 1.62 mg of zinc nitrate hexahydrate dissolved in 80 mL of methanol was mixed with 80 mL methanolic solution of 2-methylimidazole (1.05 g) under magnetic stirring. The mixture was kept at room temperature overnight without any stirring. The prepared white powder was collected by centrifugation, washed at least three times with methanol and finally subjected to drying at 80 °C overnight.


ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS nanocomposites were prepared by mixing (1, 3 and 5 wt%) ZIF-8 powder and 6% of ethylene glycol (EG) in PEDOT:PSS solution. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. All CEs were prepared by spin-coating the obtained ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composites onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate (3 cm × 3 cm) at 2000 rpm for 30 s and finally treated for 60 min at 100 °C. The detailed steps for ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE formation are described in the ESI (Scheme S1). For simplicity, ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composites with 1, 3 and 5% of ZIF-8 are named as (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS, (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS and (5%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS, respectively. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by thermal decomposition of 10 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol at 380 °C for 30 min.


TiO2 photoanodes were prepared as previously reported. The details are in the ESI. The DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the photoanode and the CE using a surlyn spacer (Solaronix) with 25 μm thickness. The active area of the cell was 0.16 cm2. Two different liquid electrolytes in acetonitrile as a solvent were prepared: (i) the iodine-based electrolyte consists of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and (ii) the cobalt-based electrolyte consists of 0.2 M Co(bpy)3(TFSI)2, 0.06 M Co(bpy)3(TFSI)3, 0.05 M LiTFSI, and 1 M TBP. The prepared electrolytes were injected into the DSSCs. The symmetrical cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) were filled with the same electrolytes as used in the full DSSCs.


The surface morphologies of the prepared CEs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM 7100F, Zeiss Ultra Plus). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profile of the obtained ZIF-8 nanopowder was recorded on an X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker) with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm). Raman spectra were obtained using a Lab-RAM, Aramis Raman spectrometer with Ar-ion laser, λ excitation = 632.8 nm, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed on BX FTIR, Perkin-Elmer. N2 gas adsorption/desorption experiments were conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 system to determine the specific surface area of the prepared ZIF-8 based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. The pore size distribution of ZIF-8 was obtained from the desorption branches of the isotherms. The roughness of the CEs was obtained by using a profiler meter.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded on a three-electrode system using a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. Ag/Ag+ was used as a reference electrode, platinum as a counter electrode and the as-prepared electrodes were used as the working electrodes in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiTFSI, 5 mM LiI and 0.5 mM I2 electrolyte at 50 mV s−1 scan rate. The cobalt system consisted of 0.05 M Co(bpy)32+, 0.05 M Co(bpy)33+, and 0.1 M LiTFSI at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance measurements of dummy cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) were carried out on an Ametek 1260 EIS instrument equipped with a frequency response analyzer. Impedance spectra were recorded in the frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz by applying a sinusoidal 10 mV AC amplitude at an equilibrium potential (0 V) under dark conditions. The obtained impedance spectra were analyzed using Z-view software, fitted with an equivalent electric circuit. Tafel polarization plots of the symmetric cells were recorded on the electrochemical workstation at 10 mV s−1 scan rate. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs were recorded using a Newport solar simulator, USA (450 W Xe source) with a Keithley 2400 source meter under irradiation (AM 1.5G, 0.1 W cm−2, light radiation intensity). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell.


From the XRD patterns of ZIF-8 crystals (Fig. S1, ESI), it can be clearly observed that all peaks of ZIF-8 are well matched with the reported literature. FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1a) of ZIF-8, PEDOT:PSS and (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS samples were recorded to confirm the composite formation. For ZIF-8, the vibrational bands at about 1675 and 1585 cm−1 are assigned to the CC stretching mode of the imidazole ring and CN stretch modes, respectively. Additionally, the bands at 3135 and 2989 cm−1 are attributed to the aromatic and the aliphatic C–H stretching of imidazole, respectively. The FT-IR spectra of the PEDOT:PSS polymer are similar to the previously reported literature. Although all peaks of PEDOT:PSS in the ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composite are clearly observed, the bands at 3135 and 2989 cm−1 of ZIF-8 are dispersed, due to the synergetic effect of ZIF-8 in PEDOT:PSS. To further investigate the structure of the prepared ZIF-8 and its composite with PEDOT:PSS, Raman spectra (Fig. 1b) were recorded. For ZIF-8, a group of peaks are observed at 689 cm−1 (Imdz ring puckering), 697 cm−1 (ring puckering + C–H out of plane bend), 1150 cm−1 (νC–N), 1190 cm−1 (νC–N + N–H wag), 1186 cm−1 (νC–N), 1466 cm−1 (C–H bending of methyl), and 1515 cm−1 (νC–C) which match well with the previous report. For the ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composite, the peaks at 1434 cm−1 due to the symmetrical stretching vibration of (νCC) and at 1370 cm−1 (νC–C) of PEDOT:PSS are clearly observed. The peaks centred at 1500 and 1550 cm−1 have been associated with the (νCC) asymmetric stretching vibrations that correspond to thiophene rings in the middle and at the end of the chains, respectively. All peaks of ZIF-8 are suppressed in the composite, confirming the synergetic interaction between ZIF-8 and PEDOT:PSS. The prepared ZIF-8 shows a BET surface area of 1592.27 m2 g−1 as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI).


While the PEDOT:PSS CE (Fig. 2a) exhibits a highly compact layer with an average surface roughness of 36 nm from SEM images, the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE (Fig. 2b) exhibits a similar morphology with an average roughness of 50 nm. On increasing the ZIF-8 content as in the (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE, a three-dimensional network film with an average roughness of 577 nm was obtained. Enhancement of roughness is favorable for increasing the catalytically active sites for redox reaction and for reducing the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. On further increasing the content of ZIF-8 as in (5%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2d), the obtained film displayed an agglomerated surface which could restrict the diffusion of ions, which is unfavorable for catalytic reactions. The cross-sectional FE-SEM images of PEDOT:PSS and ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CEs showed that the deposited films display good adhesion with the FTO substrates and the average thickness of PEDOT:PSS, (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS, (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS and (5%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS films is about 94, 530, 585 and 630 nm respectively.


From cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the I3−/I− redox shuttle (Fig. 3a), two pairs of redox peaks were observed for all the prepared CEs: the more negative peaks represented by eqn (1) and the more positive ones represented by eqn (2):

I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−
(1)
3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−
(2)
As the main function of the CE is to catalyze the reduction of I3−, we will focus on the redox reaction represented by eqn (1). Usually, the peak current density (Jpc) and peak–peak separation (Epp) are used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the CE toward the reduction of I3−.Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of the ZIF-8–PEDOT:PSS CEs. For comparison, PEDOT:PSS and Pt electrodes were also evaluated. From the summarized data in Table 1, it can be noticed that the Jpc of PEDOT:PSS (−0.55 mA cm−2) gradually increased with the addition of ZIF-8 and the maximum value was −0.92 mA cm−2 for (3%) ZIF-8–PEDOT:PSS. In addition, with increasing ZIF-8 content, Epp greatly decreased and reached 203 mV, which is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (611 mV) and that of Pt (258 mV). On further increasing the ZIF-8 content as in (5%) ZIF-8–PEDOT:PSS, a lower catalytic activity was observed as revealed by Jpc decreasing to −0.68 mA cm−2 and Epp increasing to 335 mV. Such lower activity can be mainly attributed to the damage of the conductivity of the film due to the insulating nature of the ZIFs. The ratio of Jox/|Jred| is usually used to evaluate the reversibility of the redox reaction which plays an important role in the catalytic activity. As shown in Table 1, the Jox/|Jred| ratio of the (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE is 1.41, which is lower than that of the Pt CE (1.61). The higher Jpc, lower Epp and lower overpotential loss demonstrate that the (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS electrode has better catalytic activity with respect to I3− reduction. Furthermore, to evaluate the electron-transfer reaction between CEs and the electrolyte, CV curves of the (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE for the reduction of I3− at different scan rates were recorded (Fig. S3a, ESI). From Fig. S3b (ESI), the peak current density shows a linear relationship with the scan rate, implying that the cathodic and anodic redox reactions are diffusion-limited for the transport of iodide species toward the counter electrode in the cells. The electrochemical stability of the prepared CEs toward the reduction of I3− was also investigated. The (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE was subjected to consecutive CV measurements at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI), no noticeable changes in the redox peak current density of the tested electrode were observed after 20 cycles. In addition, there was no change of shape of the tested electrode, revealing excellent electrochemical stability and strong adhesion on the FTO glass substrate.

The electrocatalytic activity and the interfacial electrochemical properties of the as-prepared CEs were studied by EIS measurements using symmetric cells. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 3b) show that Pt dummy cells show two semicircles and PEDOT:PSS and ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS exhibit three semicircles, which can be attributed to the porous nature of these CEs. The recorded Nyquist plots were fitted by the equivalent circuits which are shown in Fig. S5(a and b) (ESI) and the related parameters are summarized in Table 1. From the Randles circuit, the intercept on the real axis at high frequencies (100 kHz) represents the series resistance (Rs) which arises from the square resistance of the FTO glass substrate and external wires and conductivity of the CEs. The high-frequency arc (between 100 Hz and 10 kHz) arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE). Typically, the catalytic activity of the CE has an inverse relation with Rct toward the reduction of the redox couple. The lower the Rct, the faster the electron transfer from the surface of the CE to the electrolyte, thus less the interfacial recombination rate. The Nernst diffusion impedance of redox couple transport in the electrolyte between the two electrodes is observed in the low-frequency range of 1–10 Hz. From Table 1, the Rct value of PEDOT:PSS (34.3 Ω) greatly reduces upon adding ZIF-8 and reaches 3.8 Ω for (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS, which is close to that of Pt (3.19 Ω), revealing lower interfacial recombination. A further increase in the content of ZIF-8 as in (5%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS results in an increase in the Rct value, which may be attributed to the agglomeration of ZIF-8 nanoparticles, restricting the electron transfer. Based on the similarity of the diffusion layer in symmetric cells, the decrease in the Nb values of ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS results from higher catalytic activity, whereas (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS exhibits the lowest values owing to faster diffusion of the redox couple in the electrolyte. From the Bode diagram (Fig. 3c), the higher frequency peak assigned to the Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface has a relation with f according to eqn (3):

(3)
where
f is the peak frequency.

This peak shifts to higher frequency upon adding ZIF-8 crystals as shown in Fig. 3c, indicating lower charge transfer resistance. It is well known that the generated photoelectrons pass through the external circuit to reduce I3− at the surface of the CE, and thus the electron lifetime (τ) of photoelectrons at the CE/electrolyte interface plays a critical role in the total performance of DSSCs. The shorter the lifetime, the lower the recombination rate. The relationship [τ = 1/2πf] was employed to calculate τ. It can be noticed from Table 1 that the τ values of PEDOT:PSS (23.52 μs) gradually diminished upon adding ZIF-8 crystals, and the value of (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS is 3.18 μs which is much lower than that of Pt (14.19 μs). To further estimate the catalytic activity of different prepared CEs, Tafel polarization plots were recorded. From Fig. 3d and Table S2 (ESI), a higher exchange current density (J0) was obtained by adding ZIF-8 crystals to PEDOT:PSS, revealing the lower charge transfer resistance according to eqn (4):
(4)
where
R is the gas constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the electrons involved in the reaction (n = 2).

Moreover, the diffusion limited current density (Jlim) can be determined from the diffusion zone (|V| > 400 mV) of the Tafel plot, which is correlated with the diffusion coefficient of the redox species according to eqn (5):
(5)
where
Dn is the diffusion coefficient of I3−, l is the thickness of the diffusion layer and C is the concentration of I3−.


D
n can also be determined by the Randles–Sevcik theory.Jred = Kn1.5ACDn0.5ν0.5, where Jred is the peak current density, K is 2.69 × 105, A is the active area of the dummy cell and ν is the scan rate for the CV curves.
From Table 1, upon adding ZIF-8 crystals the Dn of PEDOT:PSS is gradually enhanced and the highest value is 8.45 × 10−6 for (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS, implying the highest diffusion of ions.

The J–V characteristic curves of the assembled DSSCs with the iodine-based electrolyte are shown in Fig. 3(e and f) and the related parameters are given in Table 1. Although the performance of PEDOT:PSS-DSSCs (4.00%) is lower than that of Pt–DSSCs (7.23%), the addition of small portions of ZIF-8 to PEDOT:PSS results in higher efficiency and the DSSC with (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.02% close to that of the Pt–DSSC. The lower efficiency of DSSCs with the PEDOT:PSS CE can be mainly attributed to its lower surface area and relatively poor catalytic activity, and the higher performance of cells based on ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS arises from the higher Voc (open-circuit voltage), Jsc (short-circuit current density), and FF (fill factor). The enhanced Jsc results from the high electrocatalytic activity owing to lower Rct and diffusion resistance which agrees with the above morphological and electrochemical analysis.


Although (I−/I3−) is the most used redox shuttle in DSSCs, there are various limitations for large-scale applications including corrosion of metal CEs, absorption of visible light, and significant loss of open circuit voltage and short circuit current density. A lot of redox couples such as the (Co2+/Co3+) complex, TEMPO, (Br3−/Br−), and (T2−/T−) have been successfully employed as alternative redox couples in DSSCs. Among them, the (Co2+/Co3+) complex redox couples received great attention due to their unique merits such as low corrosiveness toward metallic CEs and higher redox potential which are suitable for commercial DSSCs. Herein, for the first time ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composites were employed as CEs in DSSCs based on the (Co2+/Co3+) complex redox couple to investigate their photovoltaic performance.


While the conversion efficiency of the assembled DSSCs with the PEDOT:PSS CE is 5.77%, the addition of a small portion of ZIF-8 to PEDOT:PSS enhances the overall efficiency and the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS based cell shows the highest value (6.84%). Such high conversion efficiency results from the higher electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of the Co3+ ions, which will be discussed below.


To evaluate the catalytic activity of the prepared CEs toward the reduction of Co3+ ions, CV performance was systematically studied as mentioned in the iodine-based electrolyte section. As shown in Fig. 4a and from the summarized data in Table 2, all ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CEs exhibit higher Jsc comparable to both PEDOT:PSS and Pt CEs, suggesting higher catalytic activity of the ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS film toward the reduction of Co3+. Such an enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the surface roughness which favorably enhances the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode surface. While (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS shows the best catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−, (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS exhibits higher catalytic activity toward the (Co2+/Co3+) redox reaction in terms of increasing Jsc and lowering Epp, as well as a Jox/|Jred| ratio which is close to 1. A further increase in the ZIF-8 content results in lower catalytic activity, indicating that the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS composite CE exhibits the best catalytic activity toward the reduction of Co3+. The decrease in catalytic activity in 3% and (5%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CEs mainly results from the agglomeration of ZIF-8 nanoparticles which limits the diffusion of cobalt ions as well as decreases the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS polymer. A linear relationship between the peak current density and the scan rates was observed (Fig. S7, ESI), suggesting that the cathodic and anodic redox reactions are diffusion-limited for the transport of cobalt species toward the counter electrode in the cells. The electrochemical stability was also investigated by the consecutive CV test as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI).

From the Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells as shown in Fig. 4(b and c), it can be noticed that PEDOT:PSS and ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS symmetric cells show three semicircles and the Pt based cell shows two semicircles. The cell with PEDOT:PSS electrodes shows a large Rct (28.18 Ω) compared to ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CEs, and the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE exhibits the lowest Rct value (11.55 Ω), revealing higher catalytic activity. This is also confirmed by the τ factor which plays an important role in the reduction of Co3+ at the CE surface. The τ value for (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS (2.70 μs) is superior to that of the Pt CE (31.78 μs), implying an excellent catalytic activity toward the reduction of Co3+. Additionally, the relatively large slope of the cathodic branch of the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE compared to the PEDOT:PSS CE in Tafel plots (Fig. 4e) demonstrates that the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE has superior electrocatalytic performance toward Co3+ reduction. Based on the excellent electrochemical characterization, low cost and low preparation temperature, it can be suggested that, ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CEs can be applied in commercial DSSCs in both I3− and Co3+ redox shuttles.


In conclusion, ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CEs were synthesized via a spin coating method at low temperature and employed as CEs for both iodine and cobalt electrolyte based DSSCs. The electrochemical analysis displays that ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS possesses high electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of both I3− and Co33+. The prepared DSSC with the (3%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE exhibits a high conversion efficiency of 7.02% for iodide-based DSSCs, while the (1%) ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS CE shows an efficiency of 6.84% for cobalt-based DSSCs, both of which are comparable to that of Pt-based DSSCs. The high efficiency, room temperature processing and the high catalytic activity of the prepared CEs suggest that ZIF-8/PEDOT:PSS is a promising candidate for replacing the expensive and rare Pt-based CE to realize large-scale application.
