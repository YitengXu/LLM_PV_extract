Fused-pyrrole spacer groups have been exploited for the first time computationally to improve the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Known dye 1 (TPA-TTAR-T-A) containing tetrathienoacene as a spacer group has achieved 10% efficiency, which is comparable to that of ruthenium complex dyes. The DFT study reveals that fused-pyrrole as a spacer in dye 3 can augment the efficiency of DSSCs and can perform better than dye 1. The pyrrole ring possesses lower resonance energy (21.0 kcal mol−1) than the commonly used thiophene (29–34 kcal mol−1) spacers. The higher conjugative effect of fused-pyrrole rings influence the short-circuit current density (Jsc), including driving force of electrons (ΔGinjection) and singlet excited state lifetime (τ). Further, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), which depends on dipole moments (μnormal) and number of electrons transferred from the dye to the TiO2 surface (Δq), are also influenced with such conjugative effects. The calculated λmax (539 nm) and ΔGinjection (−1.82 eV) of dye 3 is much higher than the dye 1 (λmax = 497 nm and ΔGinjection = −1.28 eV). The calculated results show that the singlet excited state lifetime of dye 3 (2.2 ns) is higher than the dye 1 (1.7 ns). Dye 3 should have better Jsc value than 1 as the obtained ΔGinjection, τ and λmax values are higher in the former case. The DFT calculations also suggest that the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 3 would be higher than 1 and hence can augment the efficiency of the designed dye 3. The study was extended with tetrapyrrolobenzothiadiazole spacer groups (dyes 6 and 8) which are also shown to be promising candidates to improve the efficiencies of DSSCs. Importantly, the tendency of aggregation of dyes can also be prevented by introducing bulky groups in the fused-pyrrole ring which can also help to enhance the efficiency of designed dyes relative to reported dyes. The exploration of novel sensitizers with fused-pyrrole spacer groups would provide potential candidates for DSSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) technology has attracted considerable attention during the past two decades for new generation photovoltaic devices to provide electricity. The mostly used silicon-based cells, although efficient, are also very expensive. On the other hand, DSSCs can be made more affordable in comparison to those of conventional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaics. In DSSCs, the dyes play a critical role i.e., to determine the light harvesting properties, interaction with the semiconductor/redox couple and charge carriers. Various molecular sensitizers have been developed to achieve high power conversion efficiency. Sensitizers possessing ruthenium-complexes and Zn-porphyrin dyes have shown significantly higher efficiencies, which provide PCEs of 12.5–13.0% when employing a Co(II/III) redox shuttle as the electrolyte system. To broaden our understanding of DSSCs function and performance limitations, metal-free organic photosensitizers have attracted great attention owing to their modest cost, ease of synthesis and modification, large molar absorption coefficients, and also satisfactory stability. Nonetheless, the performance of DSSCs based on metal-free organic dyes has lagged behind those using traditional metal organic dyes due to their high recombination losses and lower open circuit voltages (Voc).

The design of dyes demands consideration of multiple optoelectronic properties, such as band gap modulation, optical absorption coefficient, as well as dye aggregation, morphology and assembly on TiO2 photoanode. Organic dyes are commonly constructed with donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) frameworks because of their efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties and other requirements. For further improving the photovoltaic efficiency it is necessary to the tailor the band gap energy, broaden the molecular absorption spectrum and increase the charge carrier mobility. Reports reveal that minor changes in the D–π–A structure can change the photophysical, electrochemical properties of the dyes.
Therefore, the design of molecular sensitizers depends on the appropriate selection of donor group and anchoring group to achieve better efficiency of solar cells. The choice of anchoring group also plays an important role in the efficiency of the DSSCs. The comparison of anchoring groups such as carboxylic groups and phosphonic acid has been documented where high symmetry of the anchoring group was highlighted to augment the efficiency of solar cells. Metal containing organic dyes have been examined with the modulation of anchoring groups, role of bridge dipole and redox active centers. Further, the role of the linker used in such metal containing dyes was also explored. Increases in the length in the π-bridge hampered the efficiency of DSSCs. Efforts have been made to prepare D–π–A dyes with various donors such as coumarin, carbazole, triphenylamine, diphenylamine, phenothiazine, indoline, azacyclazine and fluorenylamine. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that dyes containing an N-annulated indenoperylene electron donor achieved very high efficiency. We have also reported on the role of donor groups to improve the efficiency of DSSCs. It is also reported that the steric effect of the electron donor groups plays an important role in the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes.
For this class of dyes, the focus has been to modulate the π-conjugated spacer units which help the charge transfer from the ground to excited state and to increase light absorption. Heterocycles and their derivatives are used as π-bridges in the dyes due to their excellent conjugated structures. Thiophene systems such as oligothiophenes, thiophene-vinylenes and fused thiophenes have been exploited to achieve enhanced efficiencies. Moreover, a large number of conjugated groups such as carbazole, fluorene and spirobifluorene, have also been used as π-bridges. Extended bridges induce advantages that lead to smaller band gaps for extended light absorption and better matching with the energetics of the I−/I3− redox shuttle and thereby improve the DSSCs charge transfer characteristics. The thiophene group has been proved to be a good π conjugated spacer to increase light harvesting efficiency by inducing a bathochromic shift and strengthening the intensity of absorption, as well as being an excellent constitutional unit commonly used in high performance carrier transport materials. Recently, selenophene and tellurophene were also studied as π spacers in polymer solar cells. Thiophenes as π-conjugated spacer units has been extensively used in DSSCs, however, we note that this five-membered heterocyclic ring is more aromatic than pyrrole; the resonance energy calculated for thiophene is 29–34 kcal mol−1 and for pyrrole is 21.0 kcal mol−1. The lower resonance energy of the latter suggests that the pyrrole unit would be more amenable to facilitate the charge transfer from the ground state to the excited state and to increase light absorption i.e., one of the important properties to achieve higher efficiency for DSSCs. This information prompted us to exploit fused-pyrroles as π-conjugated spacer units to design D–π–A dyes for DSSCs.
There are a few reports on the use of pyrrole as a π-bridge in DSSCs. Diketopyrrolopyrrole has been used in polymer solar cells due to its high fluorescence quantum yield and high thermal stability. However, pyrrole as π-spacer unit in DSSCs is less explored. In this article, we have exploited three heterocycles (tetrathienoacene, a fused thiophene–pyrrole containing ring system and tetrapyrroloacene) as π-bridges in DSSCs. We have computationally examined the optical properties and photovoltaic performances of the dyes attached to such π-spacer units. The tetrathienoacene and fused thiophene–pyrrole containing ring systems have been experimentally tested for their efficiency. The designed tetrapyrroloacene π-bridges should have better efficiency in DSSCs than the tetrathienoacene and fused thiophene–pyrrole units with same donor groups and can be an alternative choice of π-spacer.

It is well known that the energy conversion efficiency (η) of a solar cell device is determined by the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and incident solar power on the cell (Pinc).

(1)
In DSSCs,
Jsc can be expressed as:

(2)
where LHE(
λ) is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength. Here LHE is expressed as LHE = 1–10−f where f is the oscillator strength. The term Φinjec is the electron injection efficiency and ηcollect denotes the charge collection efficiency. The term Φinjec is related to the driving force ΔGinjection of electrons injecting from the excited states of dye molecules to the semiconductor substrate. It can be expressed as:

ΔGinjection = Edye* − ECB
(3)
where,
Edye* is the oxidation potential of the excited dye and ECB is the reduction potential of the semiconductor conduction band (ECB, −4.00 eV). Edye* can be expressed as:

Edye* = Edye − λmax
(4)
where
Edye is the redox potential of the ground state of the dye and λmax is the energy of ICT. Thus Jsc value will be increased with increasing the LHE and ΔGinjection value.

As for Voc in DSSCs, can be determined by the following equation (eqn (5)):
(5)
where,
q is the unit charge, ECB is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor substrate, kBT is the thermal energy, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, NCB is the density of accessible states in the conduction band, and Eredox is the electrolyte Fermi level. The term ΔECB is the shift of conduction band edge of the semiconductor when the dyes are adsorbed on the substrate and it can be expressed as:

(6)
where,
μnormal is the dipole moment of the individual dye perpendicular to the semiconductor surface. The term γ is the surface concentration of the dye. The terms ε0 and ε denote the vacuum permittivity and dielectric permittivity, respectively. It is clear from eqn (5) and (6) that larger the μnormal of a dye and nc in the conduction band, the higher will be Voc.

All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program. The geometries of all the dyes 1–8 before and after binding to TiO2 were fully optimized via B3LYP in tetrahydrofuran solvent (dielectric constant, ε = 7.42). We used the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for C, H, O, N, S atoms, and effective core potential (ECP) LANL2DZ basis set for Ti atom, for geometry optimization. All the structures were fully optimized with default convergence criteria. This method could provide reasonable geometry with much lesser computational cost and it is comparable to the geometry optimized in MP2. The oxidation potentials were calculated at CPCM-B3LYP/B3LYP/6-311G** level of theory using the optimized dyes. TiO2 bound dyes were also used to perform the dipole moment calculation at the CPCM-B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The TiO2 surface has generally been mimicked with the cluster models to reduce the computational cost. (TiO2)8 has been employed as a cluster model to calculate the properties of the semiconductor anchored dye molecules. There are reports where larger clusters have also been examined. One of the large clusters, Ti38O76, used in a similar study showed a calculated band gap close to the experimental band gap (3.20 eV). Recently, for the bare Ti38O76 cluster, a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.78 eV has been computed, with a TDDFT lowest transition of 3.20 eV. The HOMO–LUMO gap calculated with the same level of theory for the (TiO2)8 cluster is 3.69 eV which is similar to that of the Ti38O76 cluster. These results qualitatively suggest that the (TiO2)8 model can mimic the properties of the semi-conductor TiO2 surface. In this study, we have employed (TiO2)8 as a cluster model. Further, we have also extended our study with the slightly larger (TiO2)10 cluster model to examine the results obtained with (TiO2)8 (Table S1, ESI). The optical absorption spectra of the reported dyes [TPA-TTAR-T-A (dye 1), DTP3 (dye 5) and DTP4 (dye 7)] at the ground-state optimized geometries for the 30 lowest singlet–singlet transitions were calculated using TD-DFT calculation. All the TD-DFT calculations were performed in a conductor-like polarized continuum model (CPCM) model in dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran solvent. To check the reliability of the theoretical method, seven DFT functionals were used to predict the excitation energies on the basis of the optimized ground state geometries, including B3LYP/6-31+G*, M062X/6-31+G*, ωB97XD/6-31+G*, BP86/6-31+G*, PBE0/6-31+G* MPW1K/6-31+G* and CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* functionals. Compared to computational absorption spectra with experimental data (Table 1) of D–π–A type dyes [TPA-TTAR-T-A (dye 1), DTP3 (dye 5) and DTP4 (dye 7)] similar to our discussed dyes, the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* method is found to be the most reliable level for the prediction of absorption spectra, and it was used as the TDDFT functional in the following calculations.

The π-conjugated bridge is considered to be one of the key factors for the enhanced performance of D–π–A structure DSSCs. The appropriate choice of π-spacers between the donor and acceptor groups is essential for efficient light harvesting and to reduce the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. In order to screen the excellent π-conjugated bridges of triphenylamine and phenothiazine derivative dyes, we have designed a series of metal-free organic dyes based on the reported dyes [TPA-TTAR-T-A (dye 1), DTP4 (dye 5) and DTP3 (dye 7)]. The reported dye TPA-TTAR-T-A exhibited ∼10% efficiency, which is a high value for a metal-free organic dyes. Tetrathienoacene is used as a π-spacer in dye 1 (Fig. 1). Thiophene or thienothiophene bridges are commonly used in DSSCs because of their electron transfer ability and remarkable efficiencies. The highly efficient TPA-TTAR-T-A dye containing tetrathienoacene as spacer group can be used as an alternative spacer group to the commonly used thiophene or thienothiophene. We have replaced the X2 and X4 sulfur atoms in the tetrathienoacene spacer group with the NH group i.e. thiophene is replaced by pyrrole group (dye 2, Fig. 1). The sulfur, nitrogen-heteroacene is then studied as an alternative π-spacer. Efforts are underway to prepare S,NH-heteroacenes that can be extended up to the decacene level. Furthermore, we have replaced all the thiophene units with pyrrole units as π-spacers in this study (dye 3, Fig. 1). In the next series we have replaced the thiophene group of the reported spacer group dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTPBT, dye 5) with pyrrole groups (dye 6, Fig. 1). The lower resonance energy for the pyrrole unit compared to the thiophene would help to augment the electron transfer and optical properties and hence can function as a better dye system for DSSCs. The advantage of the pyrrole moiety as a spacer in D–π–A systems is that this moiety hinders the dye aggregation, which significantly influences the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of dyes, which is not possible with thiophene π-spacer groups.


The geometries of the dye molecules (Fig. 1) calculated with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory showed some interesting trends in their geometrical properties. The π-conjugated group serves as a bridge for the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the D–π–A dye systems. The bonds between D/π-spacer and A/π-spacer give an account of the interactions within themselves. Shorter lengths of bridging bonds benefits the ICT in the D–π–A molecules. The selective bond lengths d1, d2, d3 and d4 of the studied dye molecules (Scheme 1) are shown in Table 2. The calculated bond lengths of dyes 1–4 revealed that the d1 single bond length is relatively shortened with introduction of fused-pyrrole moiety in the spacer group (Table 2). The d1 bond length of dye 1 is longer than the dye 2 (Table 2). The d1 bond length shortened significantly in dye 3 in this series (Table 2). The presence of the fused-pyrrole moiety facilitates the conjugation of electrons and increases the –CC– double bond length (d3) and decreases the C–C single bond lengths (d2, d4). The fused-pyrrole nitrogen atom not only participates in the conjugation but also donates its lone pair of electrons and helps in the conjugation. Enhanced conjugation is observed for dyes 6 and 8 relative to their corresponding dyes 5 and 7, respectively (Table 2). The degree of conjugation can favour the ICT process, which is an important factor to influence the performance of dye molecules in DSSCs.

The intramolecular charge transfer behaviour is governed by the energy gaps of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), which are responsible for the absorption spectrum for the studied systems. Typically, smaller energy gaps lead to longer absorption wavelength. As shown in Fig. 2, for the investigated dyes (1–8), the HOMO orbital is localized over the D–π–A part whereas the LUMO orbital is localized over the π–A part. The FMOs suggest that all the dyes have strong D–π–A character. The energy levels of HOMOs and LUMOs were examined to evaluate the electron injection driving force in these cases. It has been shown that the HOMO levels of the studied dyes are sufficiently lower than the redox potential of I−/I3− (−4.80 eV) which ensure the restoring of electrons from the electrolyte (Fig. 3). Further, all dyes have the ability of electron injection property to the conduction band of TiO2 as the LUMO levels are above the conduction band. For dyes 1–4, the calculated HOMO energy levels suggest that the dye 1 possesses a relatively higher energy level compared to the systems containing pyrrole units. The HOMO energy levels are in the order: dye 1 (−6.43 eV) > dye 2 (−6.11 eV) > dye 3 (−5.54 eV) < dye 4 (−5.75 eV). Therefore, restoring the electron from the electrolyte would be better facilitated with fused-pyrrole units as π-spacer groups. The rise in the LUMO levels with the use of fused-pyrrole units in the π-spacer group would facilitate the electron injection process. The LUMO energy levels are in the order: 1 (−2.11 eV) > dye 2 (−1.90 eV) > dye 3 (−1.42 eV) < dye 4 (−1.44 eV) (Fig. 3). The tripyrroloacene as π-spacer unit with biphenyl amine as a donor group (dye 4) also lowered the HOMO–LUMO energy gap compared with dye 1. This result further infers that even a smaller number of fused-pyrrole units as π-spacers can augment the efficiency of DSSCs. The dyes 5–8 containing dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole as spacer group also showed that the HOMO and LUMO energy gaps can be tuned appropriately using fused-pyrrole units to enhance the λmax (Fig. 3).

The experimental and calculated absorption spectra of dyes 1, 5 and 7 are summarized in Table 1. The computed absorption spectra for such dye molecules can be evaluated against the experimental λmax. The calculated absorption spectra of the reported dyes 1 (λmax = 497 nm), 5 (λmax = 500 nm) and 7 (λmax = 504 nm) at CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* level are in good agreement with their experimental values: [1 (λmax = 490 nm), 5 (λmax = 505 nm) and 7 (λmax = 512 nm)]. The CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory is superior over other methods used in this study (Table 1). Thus, we have calculated the absorption maximum of the designed dyes using CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory (Table 3). As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3, the order of maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of dyes 1–4 is 1 (497 nm) < 2 (529 nm) < 3 (539 nm) > 4 (518 nm); the λmax of dye 2 is red shifted by about 32 nm compared to dye 1. The results indicated that the λmax of dye 2 is red-shifted by the introduction of two –NH groups on the spacer of tetrathienoacene of dye 1. The higher conjugation and lower HLG also supports the red-shifted absorption spectra of dye 2 relative to dye 1 (Fig. 2 and Scheme 1). Furthermore, tetrapyrroloacene containing dye 3 exhibited the highest value of λmax (539 nm) in the series. The bond lengths indicated that dye 3 has better conjugation than dyes 1 and 2 (Table 2). The lower HLG value of dye 3 than for dyes 1 and 2 also supports the red shifted absorption spectra (Fig. 3). Dye 4, containing the tripyrroloacene, which is a lower homologue of tetrapyrroloacene, also shows a red shifted absorption by 21 nm relative to the reported dye 1 (Table 3). The study was further extended with dyes 5–8. The λmax values of dyes 6 and 8 also exhibited red-shifted values relative to their corresponding dyes 5 and 7, respectively (Table 3).

To seek out the relationship between the replacement of sulfur atoms with –NH groups and the efficiency, we have calculated the electron injection efficiency (ΔGinjection), light harvesting efficiency (LHE), excited state lifetime (τ), dipole moment (μnormal) and number of electrons transferred from dyes to the TiO2 surface (Δq). From eqn (2) (Computational section) it is clear that the Jsc value of a dye increases with increasing the LHE and ΔGinjection value. The excited state lifetime (τ) of the excited state can be a useful factor to estimate the efficiency of electron injection. A dye with a longer lifetime in the excited state is expected to undergo charge transfer more easily and so can enhance the Jsc value. The excited state lifetimes of the dyes can be evaluated using the equation τ = 1.499/fE2, where E is the excitation energy of the different electronic states (cm−1) and f is the oscillator strength of the electronic state. The results of all the examined dyes are presented in Table 4. The LHE values of dyes 1–4 are similar (0.99). The ΔGinjection of dyes 1–4 are −1.28, −1.37, −1.74 and −1.82 eV, respectively. The calculated results suggest that the ΔGinjection values obtained with the tetrapyrroloacene spacer group is much higher than for the corresponding reported dye 1. Nonetheless, even the lower homologue of tetrapyrroloacene, i.e. tripyrroloacene spacer group, also provided a better ΔGinjection value than the dye 1. The other studied dyes 5–8 also demonstrated the same trend as observed for dyes 1–4. The earlier reports, in combination with experimental and computational studies, corroborate similar findings where the smaller difference in ΔGinjection values reflects on quite different energy conversion efficiencies. From Table 4 it is observed that excited state lifetime of dye 4 is highest in the series. Thus the introduction of –NH groups also facilitates the lifetime/ΔGinjection which can enhance the Jsc value and efficiency of the designed dye.

There is a correlation between the dipole moment (μnormal), Δq and Voc. From the formulas (5) and (6) (Computational section), it is obvious that a dye with larger μnormal and Δq will induce a significant variation of Voc. The calculated μnormal and Δq are given in Table 5 and results on binding with (TiO2)8 are shown in Fig. 5. The calculated results showed that dye 3 has much larger Δq than the reported dye 1 (Table 4). Furthermore, dye 3 also has much higher μnormal value than dye 1. Thus, it can be predicted that dye 3 should have better Voc than dye 1. The calculated results also suggest that dye 4 should have a higher Voc than dye 1. The same trend was also observed for 5–6 and 7–8 dye systems. Nonetheless, it is important to mention that increasing bridge lengths can also dampen the efficiency of DSSCs. The experimental uncertainties with slow recombination process, unwanted consequence of excited state injection from sensitizers with bridging units can sometimes be counter-productive. The computational predictions guide to design new materials for effective use, however, the final outcome of such results can only be realized with experimental preparations.

The spacer groups in dye molecules can play a pivotal role to modulate the energy levels and absorption spectra to influence the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. In this work, we have reported computationally a series of metal-free organic dyes based on a D–π–A skeleton, which would improve the efficiency of DSSCs. The reported dye (TPA-TTAR-T-A, dye 1) containing tetrathienoacene as a spacer group already shows very high efficiency (10%). We have employed fused-pyrrole as spacer units in the designed dye molecules, which can narrow the HOMO–LUMO energy gap compared to thiophene spacer groups as the resonance energy is lower in the former case. The calculated maximum absorption wavelength of dye 3 containing a fused-pyrrole moiety (539 nm) is much longer than for dye 1 (497 nm). Even with a lesser number of pyrrole units as spacer group, i.e. dye 4, can also exhibit a much longer maximum absorption wavelength (518 nm) than 1. The calculated parameters such as electron injection driving force (ΔGinjection) and singlet excited state lifetime (τ) are closely connected with the short-circuit current density (Jsc). The DFT results show that the electron injection driving force (ΔGinjection) is more favoured in the case of dyes 3 and 4 (−1.82 and −1.74 eV) than for 1 (−1.28 eV). Thus, it is expected that dyes 3 and 4 may have better short-circuit current density values than dye 1. It is also found that the parameters related to open-circuit photovoltage such as dipole moments (μnormal) and number of electrons transferred from the dye to the TiO2 surface (Δq) of dyes 3 and 4 have larger values than for dye 1, and that can contribute to the efficiency of DSSCs. The tetrapyrrolobenzothiadiazole spacer group used in dyes 6 and 8 also shows similar trends to augment the efficiency of DSSCs. The importance of fused-pyrrole units as spacer groups in the D–π–A skeleton was also seen in preventing aggregation of the dye molecules in solution so as to improve the efficiency of DSSCs. The –N–H proton of the fused-pyrrole unit can be suitably substituted with bulky groups to prevent the aggregation process of dye molecules, which is absent in thiophene spacer groups. These designed metal-free organic sensitizers with fused-pyrrole spacer units would be worth examining with simple donor systems such as arylamine as potential candidates for DSSCs. This study shows the promise to employ fused-pyrrole rings as an alternative choice for typically used fused-thiophene rings.
