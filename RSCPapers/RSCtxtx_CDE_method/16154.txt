The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite-based solar cells has already exceeded of 22% due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the long-term ambient air stability as the Achilles' heel of such promising photovoltaic materials has to be solved for commercialization. Herein, a facile method that partially substitutes B-site Pb2+ by Bi3+ was suggested to enhance moisture tolerance and photovoltaic performances for FAPbI3. The partial incorporation of Bi in FAPbI3 tuned a more favourable tolerance factor and suppressed the phase transition from black perovskite phase to yellow non-perovskite phase at room temperature. The solar cells based on the incorporation of 5 mol% Bi3+ compounds achieved a substantially improved PCE of 17.78%, which is much higher than that of the controlled device with pure FAPbI3 (13.02%). Moreover, the optimal solar cell showed remarkable stability, maintaining 62.38% of the initial PCE without encapsulation for 1000 h under ambient conditions at 25 °C with relative humidity of 30%. This work further demonstrated the possibility of substituting Pb2+ by non-equivalent elements, thus opening the door for further developments of such promising materials.

Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite materials have attracted great interest as the most compelling candidates for next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as excellent ambipolar charge mobility, long carrier lifetime, small exciton binding energy, and suitable band gap as a light absorber with high absorption coefficient. Within a few years, the PCE of perovskite-based solar cells have improved rapidly from 3.8% to a recent world record value of 22.1%. Among the various hybrid halide perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) has been widely investigated as a light absorber in solar cells. However, it has been reported that MAPbI3 easily forms hydrated perovskite phases and eventually decomposes to PbI2 when exposed to moisture. Further, MAPbI3 has to undergo a reversible phase transition between tetragonal and cubic symmetry in a temperature range between 54 and 57 °C. In addition, it cannot withstand temperatures above 85 °C due to the volatility of organic cation MA+. As an alternative, purely inorganic cesium lead trihalide perovskites have exhibited excellent thermal stability when used as a light absorber in solar cells. However, it is quite challenging to apply inorganic cesium lead trihalides to photovoltaic devices. For instance, CsPbBr3 does not have an ideal band gap (2.30 eV) for photovoltaics as MAPbI3 (1.55 eV) does, which means it is unable to absorb light of long-range wavelength. Although the desired black perovskite (α-phase) CsPbI3 has a more suitable band gap of 1.73 eV, it is only stable at temperatures above 300 °C. When temperature drops to room temperature, this α-phase will degrade to undesired yellow non-perovskite (δ-phase) rapidly because of phase instability. Compared to MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, another organic lead perovskite HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3), using FA+ as a replacement for MA+ or Cs+, successfully forms an efficient perovskite with smaller Eg (1.53 eV), enhancing the light absorbance and bringing about higher solar light harvesting efficiency. Although FAPbI3-based solar cells have better thermal stability than MAPbI3-based ones and better photovoltaic performance than those using inorganic perovskite materials, FAPbI3-based solar cells suffer from moisture stability issues due to the hygroscopicity of the organic cation FA+. In addition, much like pure CsPbI3, pure FAPbI3 also lacks structural stability at room temperature and a photoactive perovskite (α-phase, which is thermodynamically stable only above 160 °C) can convert to a photoinactive, non-perovskite (δ-phase) polymorph below the phase transition temperature under ambient conditions in a few days.

In order to improve the stability of perovskite materials, a facile method that partially replaces or substitutes A-site cations by different cations in the perovskite crystal lattice has been suggested. For instance, the phase stability and photostability of conventional lead-based perovskites can be greatly improved by mixing the A-site cation with FA+, MA+, Cs+ or Rb+. However, it remains largely unknown whether partially substituting Pb2+ with an alternative metal species at the B-site would influence material photoelectric properties and photovoltaic performance. Bismuth (Bi) as an element located adjacent to Pb in the periodic table shows a very similar electronic structure and ionic radius to Pb2+. Recently, the introduction of Bi3+ in lead-perovskite films has been reported to significantly affect the crystalline phase and optoelectronic properties. Particularly, Ahmed L. Abdelhady et al. have proved that partially replacing Pb2+ in MAPbBr3 by nonequivalent Bi3+ can narrow the band gap and improve electrical conductivity. Our previous work has also shown that the incorporation of Bi3+ into CsPbBr3 can extend the absorption edge and increase the conductivity by electronic doping.
Herein, we investigate the incorporation of Bi3+ in FAPbI3 to improve the conversion efficiency and stability of solar cells for the first time. By tuning the stoichiometric ratio of Bi3+ in FAPb1−xBixI3 (0 < x ≤ 0.5), where parts of Pb2+ is substituted by Bi3+, excellent stability as well as improved light absorption and electrical conductivity have been obtained. A substantially improved PCE of 17.78% (incorporation of 5 mol% Bi3+) in a planar heterojunction device based on this system has been achieved compared with 13.02% achieved in a controlled device with pure FAPbI3, which is mainly attributed to increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Moreover, the optimal solar cell shows remarkable stability for 1000 h under ambient conditions at 25 °C with relative humidity (RH) of 30%, maintaining 62.38% of the initial PCE without encapsulation, suggesting Bi3+ is a promising mixing cation alternative to Pb2+ at the B-site for an efficient and moisture-stable absorber of perovskite solar cells.

Bismuth iodide (BiI3, 99%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.9%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All salts and solvents were used as received without any further purification.


The controlled α-FAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by fully dissolving 0.01 mol FAI and 0.01 mol PbI2 in 10 mL solvent obtained by mixing DMSO and DMF (3:7, v/v). Bi3+-incorporated FAPbI3 perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by fully dissolving 0.01 mol FAI and 0.01 mol mixture of PbI2/BiI3 (molar ratios of BiI3 in the mixture ranged from 5 to 50 mol%) in 10 mL solvent obtained by mixing DMSO and DMF (3:7, v/v). Then, the precursor solutions were stirred at 70 °C for 12 h.


First, a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (sheet resistance of 8 ohm per square) was ultrasonically cleaned by detergent, deionized water, and acetone for 20 min sequentially, and then treated with a UV/O3 cleaner for 15 min. Then, a uniform dense TiO2 layer was deposited on the FTO glass substrate by spin coating 0.15 mol L−1 titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in butanol at 3500 rpm and repeating the process twice, and then sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the perovskite film was deposited on the compact TiO2 layer by two-step spin coating of the as-prepared precursor solution at 800 rpm for 10 s and 3500 rpm for 25 s. During the second step, diethyl ether was dripped on the rotating film 15 s before the end of the process. The spin-coated film was annealed at 180 °C for 15 min to form the perovskite film. Afterward, the final film was covered by the hole transporter spiro-MeOTAD. 0.167 g spiro-MeOTAD was dissolved in 1.00 mL chlorobenzene, and 0.0103 g LiTFSI and 0.0298 g tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were used as additives and then the solution was deposited by spin-coating at 5500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Au electrode was deposited on top of the device through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation under ca. 5 × 10−5 Torr vacuum condition.


Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The surface morphology and elemental compositions were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Quanta 250FEG) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on an RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under dark condition by using a potentiostat (Solartron 1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1255B) with the frequency ranging from 0.05 to 106 Hz. Absorption spectra were measured with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The PL spectra of the films were obtained at room temperature using a steady-state lifetime spectrofluorometer (Varian Cary Eclipse) with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm. The current–voltage characteristic curves were measured under standard AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-90L2, Wacom). The effective area of the cell was calculated as 0.09 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask.


The controlled α-FAPbI3 film and the Bi-incorporated FAPb1−xBixI3 (0 < x ≤ 0.5) films were all fabricated under ambient conditions (with controlled humidity <50%) by applying a typical one-step deposition method (see Experimental section for details).

As shown in Fig. 1a, the controlled α-FAPbI3 film is black, which is consistent with the typical black phase of FAPbI3 reported previously. The color of Bi-incorporated FAPb1−xBixI3 films changed gradually from dark brownish to bright orange with the concentration of Bi3+ increasing from 2.5 mol% to 50 mol%, suggesting the black phase perovskite gradually reduced in the films. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the δ-FAPbI3 film, controlled α-FAPbI3 film and FAPb1−xBixI3 films with different Bi content. The XRD patterns of the δ-FAPbI3 film exhibited a strong peak at 11.7° and 22.2°, corresponding to typical P63mc with a hexagonal non-perovskite structure. The XRD patterns of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film exhibited peaks at 13.92°, 19.76°, 24.35° and 28.09°, which are attributed to (110), (200), (202) and (220) diffraction planes of α-FAPbI3, respectively, corresponding to the typically black cubic perovskite phase as previously reported. Upon substituting Pb with 5% of Bi, the peaks of black α-FAPbI3 in the XRD patterns became sharper and enhanced without other impurities. As x increased beyond 0.1, δ-FAPbI3 started to appear again in the film and the peaks at 11.7° and 22.2° corresponding to the non-perovskite structure FAPbI3 became obvious. The appearance of δ-FAPbI3 again in the film may be caused by the excessive Bi-doping resulting in severe lattice mismatch and increase in non-uniform stress on the film, leading to the unstable perovskite phase transforming into the non-perovskite phase at room temperature. Furthermore, the (110) peaks of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film and the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI. We can observe a slight peak shift toward wider angles in the XRD of the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film compared to that in the pristine α-FAPbI3 film, which could be correlated with a significant decrease in lattice parameters due to incorporation of the smaller Bi cation in FAPbI3. For further studying the influences of mixing Bi in FAPbI3 on its crystalline properties, Fig. S2 shows the photographs and corresponding XRD patterns of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film after heating for 10 min at different temperatures. The controlled α-FAPbI3 film began to form the α-phase at 140 °C and completely darkened at 180 °C, while the black α-phase of the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film began to be formed at 120 °C and completely darkened at 160 °C. This demonstrated that the Bi-mixed perovskite has a lower phase transition temperature compared to pristine FAPbI3, which implies that partially substituting Pb2+ with Bi3+ in the perovskite crystal lattice could cause the cubic phase FAPbI3 to be more favorably formed after solvent evaporation. The elemental compositions of the target films were confirmed by elemental analyses through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the compositions of these films are approximate to the precursor solutions (Fig. S3). Notably, although the ratios of metal (Pb/Bi) to iodine in the films were all close to 1:3, the iodine components in the Bi-incorporated films were slightly larger than that of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film due to the higher valency of Bi3+ than Pb2+. For a simple expression, we still use FAPb1−xBixI3 (0 < x ≤ 0.5) to describe Bi-incorporated films. In order to characterize photophysical characteristics of the Bi-containing FAPb1−xBixI3 films, Fig. 1c and S4 show absorbance spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film and FAPb1−xBixI3 films, respectively, when the thicknesses of these films are carefully controlled to be the same. The controlled α-FAPbI3 film absorbed light with wavelength below ∼810 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.53 eV. The FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film showed a similar band gap but enhanced absorption compared to the controlled pure FAPbI3, which is in good agreement with the local amplification of PL spectra, as shown in Fig. 1d. By further increasing the ratio of Bi to Pb above 0.1, the absorbance gradually decreased due to the formation of δ-FAPbI3, as confirmed by the XRD data.
To further study the long-term stability of the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film, we tested the water wetting behaviour of the controlled FAPbI3 and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film by means of contact-angle tests. As shown in Fig. 2a, compared to the controlled FAPbI3 film with a water contact angle of 73.1°, the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film showed a very large water contact angle of 111.2°. The obvious difference in contact angle could be attributed to the smoother surface of FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film, which indicated an enhanced moisture tolerance of perovskite film after 5 mol% Bi3+ incorporation.Fig. 2 also shows the photographs and corresponding absorbance changing with time for the controlled α-FAPbI3 and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 films kept in a constant temperature–humidity chamber at 25 °C with 60% RH. In the case of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film, the color gradually changed to yellow, suggesting that the black phase perovskite converted to the yellow δ-phase, while no obvious change in color was observed for the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 films (Fig. 2b). As seen in Fig. S5, there is also no obvious change in XRD patterns of FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 even after 15 days (Fig. S5b), while the peaks corresponding to δ-FAPbI3 started to appear in controlled α-FAPbI3 after only 5 days (Fig. S5a), which proved that the 5 mol% Bi3+ in FAPbI3 significantly improved its stability in a humid environment. Similar to XRD patterns shown, the absorbance of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film (Fig. 2c) gradually decreased and finally degraded completely after 15 days, whereas there was still no obvious change in the absorbance onset of the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film (Fig. 2d). Thus, partially substituting Pb2+ (1.19 Å) with a smaller cation Bi3+ (1.03 Å) in the perovskite crystal lattice caused a more favourable tolerance factor, which increased from 0.986 to 0.989 after 5 mol% Bi3+ incorporation. Therefore, we speculate that Bi incorporation can suppress the phase transition from black perovskite phase to yellow non-perovskite phase.

Fig. 3a and b show the cross-sectional scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images of the controlled α-FAPbI3 and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 films deposited on FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) substrate, respectively. For the controlled α-FAPbI3 film, we could observe several rather small grains stacked on top of each other from the top to the bottom on the c-TiO2-based substrates. The smaller crystal size and larger density of grain boundaries and voids would significantly reduce the film's charge extraction ability due to the corresponding higher defect density in the perovskite layer. In contrast, grains densely connected to each other horizontally were formed in the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film, with a single layer of grains in the vertical direction. This greatly reduced the possible charge recombination and thus improved overall performance. Besides, Fig. 3c and d further exhibit atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film, respectively. Root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film determined from the AFM images was 15.2 nm, which is relatively small compared to that of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film (37.5 nm), suggesting the importance and advantages of using a suitable amount of Bi3+ in the precursor solution for improving the morphology of the final perovskite films. Furthermore, Fig. S6 shows top-view SEM images of the controlled α-FAPbI3 and FAPb1−xBixI3 films with different Bi ratios. When the ratio of Bi increased from 0 to 0.05, the film surface morphology was smoother and more compact and the obtained perovskite crystals were much larger than the others, which would reduce the grain boundaries and electronic trap states, thus proving beneficial for charge transport and photovoltaic performance enhancement.

EDS mapping was performed to identify the presence and distribution of Bi in the perovskite film. Fig. 4a shows that Bi was uniformly incorporated in the FAPbI3 film. To observe the change in bonding nature by partially substituting Bi for Pb, X-ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) were investigated. As shown in Fig. S7, the overview spectra of Bi-incorporated FAPb1−xBixI3 films clearly demonstrated the existence of Bi in the FAPbI3 lattice and the oxidation state of Bi in the FAPb1−xBixI3 films is +3, as previously reported. Besides, the corresponding atomic ratios in these films were derived from the XPS spectra and are listed in Table S1. The XPS analyses showed that elemental compositions of the FAPb1−xBixI3 films fitted well with the results of EDS. To further investigate the influence of Bi3+ incorporation, the representative high-resolution XPS spectra of the controlled α-FAPbI3 and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 films were taken, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Bi 4f doublet was clearly resolved at 157.65 and 162.95 eV corresponding to the binding energies of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, and the binding energies of Bi 4f was slightly smaller than the reported values of Bi3+, which might suggest a different chemical environment. On the other hand, a shift in the peak position to a higher binding energy was observed in the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film for I 3d and Pb 4f compared to the controlled α-FAPbI3.

The impedance spectrum (IS) is a powerful tool to characterize the electrical properties of solar cell interfaces. Fig. S8 shows the Nyquist plots of a series of devices based on FTO/c-TiO2/FAPb1−xBixI3/Au at different conditions (dark condition or AM 1.5G illumination) under a small AC bias voltage of 0.1 V as well as a function of frequency (ω), sweeping from 5 × 10−2 Hz to 105 Hz. The device based on the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film exhibited the smallest semicircles in the Nyquist plot under both dark (Fig. S8a) and AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. S8b) condition. The charge transport resistance (RCT) values of the device based on the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film under dark/AM 1.5G illumination condition were extracted from the equivalent circuits as 7.12 kΩ and 3.17 kΩ, respectively, which were much lower than those of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film (Table S2). The much lower RCT in the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film can be attributed to the lower grain boundaries and smoother morphology in the perovskite layer, as shown in the SEM results. In addition, RCT value of the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film greatly decreased by 55.48% under light compared to under dark conditions, while that of the controlled α-FAPbI3 film only reduced by 33.90% (Table S2). These results suggest that solar cells based on the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film will have better photovoltaic performance than the controlled α-FAPbI3 solar cells.

To investigate the effect of Bi incorporation on photovoltaic performance, planar-architecture perovskite solar cells with electrode configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/FAPb1−xBixI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated (Fig. S9a). As shown in Fig. S9b, the optimal substitution ratio of Bi for the best device performance was found to be 5%. When Bi3+ replacement Pb2+ in FAPbI3 increased beyond 10 mol%, the performances of the solar cell decreased mainly due to a reduction in Jsc and FF, as shown in Table S3. The gradual reduction of FAPb1−xBixI3 performances may originate from the poor surface morphology and formation of δ-FAPbI3 in the film. Fig. 5a and S10a show the photographs and corresponding cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite solar cells employing the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film and the controlled α-FAPbI3 film. The thickness of the controlled α-FAPbI3 and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film capping layers was similar at about 490 nm. Fig. 5b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of champion cells based on the controlled α-FAPbI3 and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 films under simulated 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The best PCE based on the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film was 17.78%, with high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V, Jsc of 23.65 mA cm−2, and FF of 72.99%, while the controlled α-FAPbI3 device exhibited the best PCE of 13.02%, with Voc of 1.01 V, Jsc of 20.50 mA cm−2, and FF of 62.86%. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices and integrated Jsc are shown in Fig. 5c. The FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 cell exhibited higher EQE than the controlled α-FAPbI3 cell over the wavelength range corresponding to its absorbance, which indicated enhanced charge collection at both electrodes causing improvement in Jsc. Fig. 5d shows the stabilized efficiency output under maximum power point tracking, reaching 17.69% (at 0.82 V), which is very close to the J–V scan efficiency, while that of the controlled α-FAPbI3 solar cell was only 12.17% at 0.72 V (Fig. S10b). Furthermore, the statistical distributions of photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) for each batch of 21 devices based on the controlled α-FAPbI3 and a series of FAPb1−xBixI3 films are shown in Fig. S11. The devices based on the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film exhibited a higher average PCE of 15.18% with better reproducibility compared to the controlled α-FAPbI3 (10.43%), which is due to the significant increase in Jsc and FF and a slight increase in Voc. This higher Jsc and FF in the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 cell may due to the lower defect density and charge transport resistance, while in the pure FAPbI3 cell, there was a larger density of grain boundaries along with higher defect density, significantly reducing the charge extraction ability. Finally, the air stability test of the controlled α-FAPbI3 cell and FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 cell was evaluated by storing the devices under dark (25 °C and RH = 30%) condition without any encapsulation and measuring the photovoltaic parameters under light. The controlled α-FAPbI3 device was gradually transformed to yellow phase as evidenced by the faded optical image (Fig. S12a) and reduced PCE down to nearly 0, which could be due to lower light absorption caused by α-phase to δ-phase transition in the perovskite absorber, thus causing rapid reduction in Jsc (Fig. S12b). On the contrary, the device based on the FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 film maintained the black phase even after 1000 h and the PCE maintained 62.38% of its initial value.


In summary, we have demonstrated a successful inorganic Bi-incorporated FAPbI3 perovskite not only with superior stability, but also with improved light absorption and electrical conductivity compared to pure FAPbI3, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport and hence improved cell performance. With an optimal Bi content, the devices based on FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 showed remarkable enhancement in Jsc and FF and an increased average PCE (from 10.43% for cells based on pure FAPbI3 to 15.18%), including a promising PCE of 17.78%. Moreover, the device based on FAPb0.95Bi0.05I3 also showed long-term stability in ambient air. This work further demonstrated the possibility of substituting Pb with the trivalent element Bi, which provides the possibility of further improvement in the performance of alloy perovskite solar cells.
