Pure carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their derivatives grafted with the regiorandom poly(3-dodecyl thiophene) (CNT-g-PDDT) and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (CNT-g-P3HT) polymers were employed to improve the morphological, optical, and photovoltaic properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. Although the grafted CNT components improved the cell characteristics, bare CNTs destroyed them. The regioregularity and graft length influences were investigated on the system behavior. The CNT nanostructures grafted with the shorter P3HT backbones demonstrated the best results, i.e., 79.9 Ω, 23.60 mA cm−2, 76%, 0.97 V and 17.40%. This originated from the higher crystalline peak intensities for both P3HT (5.6–5.8°) and CH3NH3PbI3 (14.81, 20.91, 24.11, 29.21 and 32.51°) precursors and also the larger grain sizes (5 (600 nm) versus 50 (490 nm) kDa). The perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT devices, in particular the CNTs with shorter grafts, possessed faster electron transport and lower carrier recombination compared with the other solar cells, as evidenced by the larger short-circuit current density.

Perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention in the past few years due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple manufacturing methods. These photovoltaic systems have gained significant interests because of the rapid progress of device performance from 3.8 to 22.1%. To increase PCE, it is necessary to precisely control the carriers along the entire pathway of the device. The properties of perovskites, which result in highly efficient devices, include a strong absorption coefficient with a sharp absorption edge, low levels of non-radiative decay loss, high fractions of free charges and charge-carrier diffusion lengths of the order of micrometers. The perovskite devices utilize a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a thin TiO2 layer and a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold, onto which a methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layer is deposited, followed by a spin-coated hole transporting layer and a thermally evaporated silver or gold back contact.

The nanostructured carbonic materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used for distinct energy applications including transparent electrodes and charge transport layers. CNTs are also employed in the composite materials as electrodes for the perovskite devices. These materials are incorporated at the perovskite-electrode interface for assisting hole extraction. Bag et al. demonstrated the facile incorporation of CNTs into the bulk of the perovskite layer and the reduction in recombination losses. Aitola et al. reported a highly efficient perovskite solar cell (above 18%) with a hybrid hole-transporting material-counter electrode based on a thin CNT film and a drop-cast 2,2,7,-7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole-transporting material. Some researchers obtained substantial PCE improvements by adding low fractions of CNTs into a P3HT hole transfer layer. Wang et al. constructed a fully flexible perovskite device with PCE of 8.3% using electron-collecting TiO2 nanotubes on a metal foil as a flexible substrate and a CNT network as a transparent hole transport layer. In the inverted p–i–n perovskite solar cell architecture, Jeon et al. could replace ITO on the glass substrate with CNTs and still retained a reasonable performance. The efficient hole-collecting properties of CNT precursors in the perovskite systems were also explained by Schulz et al. A CNT bridging method was also introduced in both perovskite and carbon layers to form a high-quality perovskite/carbon interface. In the work reported by Hussain and coworkers, a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cell was developed using the functionalized CNT yarn as both the cathode and anode materials. In another work, hybrid organic nanocrystal/CNT electrodes were designed for air- and photo-stable perovskite systems. Vapor-assisted ex situ doping of CNTs was also reported for affording efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
In addition to the perovskite photovoltaics, some advantages have been introduced for the polymer-based ternary photovoltaics via the incorporation of additional components. In this regard, the optimizations of photon harvesting and charge carrier transport, exciton distribution, mobility and donor alloys, and energy levels and optical bandgap have been recently reported. Furthermore, the incorporation of medium-bandgap acceptors and alloyed donors can promote the efficacy in ternary polymer solar cells. Decorated CNT supramolecules were also found to improve the photovoltaic characteristics in polymeric devices.
Herein, primary CNTs and their derivatives grafted with irregioregular (CNT-g-PDDT) and regioregular (CNT-g-P3HT) polymers were applied to improve the morphological, optical, and photovoltaic properties as well as the charge-transfer ability of FTO/b-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag perovskite solar cells. The regioregularity and length of the polymer grafts influenced the system behavior. The CNT nanostructures grafted with shorter P3HT backbones demonstrated the best results, i.e., 79.9 Ω, 23.60 mA cm−2, 0.97 V and 17.40%. Although the grafted CNT components improved the cell characteristics, bare CNT nanostructures destroyed them.

The perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving lead(II) iodide (PbI2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and methylamine iodide (MAI, TCI, 99%) (molar ratio of 1:1) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma Aldrich) at a concentration of 35 wt%. The multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and grafted CNTs (CNT-g-PDDT and CNT-g-P3HT) were added into the solution at a concentration of 0.07 mg mL−1. The ratio of CNT-based materials including CNT, CNT-g-PDDT, CNT-g-P3HT (long) and CNT-g-P3HT (short) precursors to CH3NH3PbI3 was fixed to be 1:15 for all photovoltaic layers. The short (5 kDa) and long (50 kDa) P3HT chains were applied to investigate the influence of backbone length on the device efficacy. The solution was stirred at 60 °C overnight in a nitrogen chamber. The details of synthesis procedures and characterization of prepared materials are reported in ESI.


The perovskite solar cells were fabricated on the fluorine-doped indium oxide (FTO) glass substrates with the device configuration of FTO/b-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag. The FTO glass substrates were treated with ultraviolet (UV)–ozone for 30 min. A TiO2 layer was spin-coated from a solution having 0.3 M n-butyl alcohol. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated from a solution with 1 g 18NRT Dyesol paste in 7 mL of EtOH at 5000 rpm. The TiO2-coated substrates were cured at 500 °C for 45 min. The perovskite solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm and during this step, 150 μL chlorobenzene was quickly added onto the substrate. The perovskite solutions were deposited inside a nitrogen chamber and annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. The hole transport material solution was prepared by mixing 75 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD, 28 μL tert-butylpyridine, and 18 μL of bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) solution in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The hole transport material solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 3500 rpm for 45 s. The Ag anode was thermally deposited on the substrate through a shadow mask under a vacuum level of 10−4 Pa. The currents were measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G irradiation.


CNTs and grafted CNTs including CNT-g-PDDT, CNT-g-P3HT (long) and CNT-g-P3HT (short) nanostructures were utilized to modify the optical, morphological, and electrical properties of perovskite solar cells. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded to detect the change in crystallinity. The XRD measurements were obtained using a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer. The XRD patterns of perovskite, perovskite + CNT, perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT, perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) and perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) films are illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The diffraction peaks of 14.81, 20.91, 24.11, 29.21 and 32.51° in the XRD spectra in Fig. 1(a) can be correlated to the ordered crystalline planes of (110), (112), (211), (220) and (312) for tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3, respectively. The incorporation of CNTs into the perovskite systems decreased the crystallinity; this was verified by the rapid decrease in the intensity of the identifying peaks in the XRD patterns of perovskite + CNT films compared to that for pristine perovskite ones (Fig. 1(a)). The CNT-g-P3HT-incorporated perovskite films having short and long P3HT grafts demonstrated the highest diffraction peak intensities among all samples; thereby, they exhibited the greatest crystallinity. The partially sharp peak detected at 2θ = 5.6–5.8° was a fingerprint of P3HT crystallization. In fact, the P3HT grafts onto CNTs were simultaneously crystallized and made the perovskite precursors crystalline in the active layers. It was witnessed that the shorter P3HT chains acted better than the longer ones in ordering the perovskite precursors. By changing the grafts from regioregular P3HT to irregioregular PDDT, the polymer peak at 5.6–5.8° disappeared and the intensity of the perovskite-identifying peaks decreased, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The crystallizable P3HT grafts played their role in ordering the perovskite precursors better than the uncrystallizable PDDT ones. It can be seen that an insignificant peak appears at 2θ = 25.5° in Fig. 1(a); it was also assigned to the CNT component, which was detected in perovskite + CNT, perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT, perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) and perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) films.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the pristine perovskite films and the films modified with CNT, CNT-g-PDDT, CNT-g-P3HT (long) and CNT-g-P3HT (short) are exhibited in Fig. 1(b). The UV-Vis spectra of the samples were recorded using a Lambda 750 UV-Vis spectrometer. The CNT-g-P3HT-incorporated perovskite films with either short or long backbones demonstrated higher absorbance because of the considerable current density of the respective devices. The peak at 480 nm for the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT thin film in Fig. 1(b) is attributed to the ordered P3HT chains. The absorption of CNT-g-PDDT-modified perovskite thin films was lower than that of the CNT-g-P3HT-modified ones, as displayed in Fig. 1(b). Although the grafted CNT components improved the absorbance of pristine perovskite films, bare CNTs decreased the absorbance efficiency, as evidenced in the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 1(b). The photoluminescence (PL) was measured to study the charge traps in the perovskite films. PL spectra were recorded using a photoluminescence optistatDry-BLV model. As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the CNT-g-P3HT-inserted perovskite films, especially with short P3HT grafts, demonstrate strong perovskite emission signals at 771 nm, whereas the pristine perovskite and CNT-added films exhibit a reduced signal. In addition, via adding CNT-g-PDDT nanostructures into the perovskite films, the signals decreased compared with that of the regioregular P3HT-grafted ones (Fig. 1(c)). On the basis of time-resolved PL spectra, we infer that the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) (23.5 ns), perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) (20.5 ns), and perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT (15.8 ns) thin films exhibit improved photoluminescence lifetimes compared with the perovskite (5.6 ns) and perovskite + CNT (3.8 ns) films. This can be because the grafted CNT components were capable of reducing the charge trap states and effectively transporting the charges.
The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM)-type 1430 VP (LEO Electron Microscopy Ltd, Cambridge, UK) was employed to study the morphologies of the modified and unmodified perovskite films (Fig. 2). The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film composed of CNTs represented poorer crystalline morphology with small perovskite crystal grains (average value ∼85 nm) (Fig. 2(b)) with respect to pristine perovskite (average value ∼230 nm) (Fig. 2(a)). The perovskite film prepared from CH3NH3PbI3 as well as CNT-g-PDDT, CNT-g-P3HT (long) and CNT-g-P3HT (short) represented larger grains (average values: ∼375, 490, and 600 nm, respectively) (Fig. 2(c–e)). The maximum grain sizes of pure perovskite, perovskite + CNT, perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT, perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) and perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) systems reached 385, 220, 485, 750 and 980 nm, respectively. Therefore, CNTs have negative influence on the grain growth of perovskite precursors, whereas CNT-g-PDDT and CNT-g-P3HT have a positive effect on the grain size enhancement, thus improving the charge extraction process.
The configuration of glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2-CH3NH3PbI3 nanocomposite layer/CH3NH3PbI3 upper layer/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag was selected to fabricate the perovskite cells and study the influence of CNT and grafted CNT-incorporated perovskites on the device performances (Fig. 3). Currents were measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. The morphological and optical results acquired from the above-mentioned measurements such as XRD (Fig. 1(a)), FESEM (Fig. 2), and UV-Vis (Fig. 1(b)) are illustrated as a snapshot in the scheme in Fig. 3. The presence of CNT-g-P3HT modifiers further affected the morphology and ordering of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films compared with the presence of CNT-g-PDDT ones. The self-ordering polymer grafts such as P3HT may induce double crystallinity in the active layers, thereby increasing the crystallinity and grain sizes simultaneously.
To further clarify the influence of CNT and grafted CNT precursors on the perovskite systems, the respective solar cells were precisely fabricated and tested under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. Fig. 4(a) and Table 1 show the current–voltage (J–V) curves and detailed photovoltaic data, respectively. The pure perovskite devices represented acceptable cell parameters including short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.90 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 66%, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.10%. The incorporation of bare CNT components into the CH3NH3PbI3 layers decreased the photovoltaic features and therefore the system efficacy, i.e., Jsc = 15.66 mA cm−2, FF = 64%, Voc = 0.93 V and PCE = 9.32%. It was witnessed via intensity reduction in identifying peaks of XRD spectra (Fig. 1(a)) that the presence of CNTs destroyed the crystallinity. In addition, the absorbance decreased at 400–800 nm wavelengths according to the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 1(b)). The grain sizes also decreased from 230 to 85 nm (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) via addition of CNTs into CH3NH3PbI3. Hence, the bare CNT precursors exhibited a negative effect on the morphological and optical properties of active layers and consequently destroyed the photovoltaic characteristics of the fabricated solar cells.

In a forward step, by grafting the CNT surface, the alterations changed in a positive trend. Either CNT-g-PDDT or CNT-g-P3HT improved the cell characteristics. In perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT solar cells, the parameters of Jsc = 21.07 mA cm−2, FF = 72% and Voc = 0.96 V led to average PCE of 14.56%. The regioregular polymer grafts of P3HT further improved the system properties (22.73 mA cm−2, 75%, and 0.96 V) and higher PCE of 16.36% was achieved (Table 1). In fact, the regioregular P3HT grafts onto CNTs induced double-ordering in the thin films. The crystallinity and absorbance enhancement (Fig. 1(a) and (b)) as well as grain size increase from 230 to 490 nm (Fig. 2(d)versusFig. 2(a)) could be considered as the origins of the increase in efficiency of the CH3NH3PbI3 devices. For investigating the impact of P3HT graft length on the cell parameters, shorter P3HT backbones (5 versus 50 kDa) were also attached to the CNT surface and the fabricated solar cells were measured, as tabulated in Table 1. The XRD results reflected that the shorter P3HT grafts show higher crystalline peak intensities for both P3HT (2θ = 5.6–5.8°) and CH3NH3PbI3 (14.81, 20.91, 24.11, 29.21 and 32.51°) precursors (Fig. 1(a)). Moreover, the absorbance at 400–800 nm was higher for the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) thin films than that detected for the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) systems (Fig. 1(b)). FESEM analysis also represented the larger grain sizes for the CH3NH3PbI3 + CNT-g-P3HT systems having shorter grafts (5 kDa), i.e., 600 versus 490 nm. All these positive alterations induced better cell parameters in the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) solar cells (Jsc = 23.60 mA cm−2, FF = 76%, Voc = 0.97 V and PCE = 17.40%).
The impact of distinct CNT-based modifiers was also investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 4(b) depicts the results of the EIS tests for the pristine perovskite devices and those manipulated with CNT, CNT-g-PDDT, CNT-g-P3HT (long) and CNT-g-P3HT (short). The Nyquist curves of devices were obtained under dark condition (Z′ vs. −Z′′) with real (Z′) and imaginary (Z′′) parts of cell impedance. As illustrated in Fig. 4(b) and Table 1, the charge-transfer resistance (Rtr) values of the devices based on CNT-g-PDDT and CNT-g-P3HT are lower than that of the pristine one owing to the smaller radii of the semicircles. The values of ohmic resistance and Rtr for the fabricated solar cells can be calculated using the inset model of Fig. 4(b). The Rtr values for the perovskite, perovskite + CNT, perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT, perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) and perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) solar cells were 247.5, 263.5, 99.7, 90.1 and 79.9 Ω, respectively. The results proved that the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT devices, in particular the CNTs with shorter grafts, possessed a faster electron transport and lower carrier recombination compared with other solar cells, as evidenced by larger Jsc (23.60 mA cm−2) (Table 1).
The histograms of photovoltaic parameters comprising Jsc (Fig. S5(a), (e), (i), (m) and (q), ESI), Voc (Fig. S5(b), (f), (j), (n) and (r), ESI), FF (Fig. S5(c), (g), (k), (o) and (s), ESI) and PCE (Fig. S5(d), (h), (l), (p) and (t), ESI) are reported for a better comparison among different system functions. The distributions of Jsc (23.20–23.85 mA cm−2 (Fig. S5(q), ESI)), Voc (0.96–0.99 V (Fig. S5(r), ESI)), FF (75–77% (Fig. S5(s), ESI)) and PCE (16.71–18.16% (Fig. S5(t), ESI)) were the narrowest in the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (short) solar cells. The second narrowly distributed system was the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) device with Jsc = 22.11–22.97 mA cm−2 (Fig. S5(m), ESI), Voc = 0.95–0.97 V (Fig. S5(n), ESI), FF = 74–76% (Fig. S5(o), ESI) and PCE = 15.57–16.91% (Fig. S5(p), ESI). The perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT photovoltaics depicted a bit wider distribution with respect to the perovskite + CNT-g-P3HT (long) systems (Jsc = 20.48–21.15 mA cm−2 (Fig. S5(i), ESI), Voc = 0.95–0.98 V (Fig. S5(j), ESI), FF = 71–73% (Fig. S5(k), ESI) and PCE = 13.85–15.08% (Fig. S5(l), ESI)). The histograms of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 (17.59–18.18 mA cm−2, 0.93–0.95 V, 65–68% and 10.66–11.72%) and perovskite + CNT (15.20–16.07 mA cm−2, 0.92–0.95 V, 62–65% and 8.93–9.90%) are also reported in Fig. S5(a–d) and (e–h) (ESI), respectively. The narrower distribution is a fingerprint of higher reproducibility in the perovskite photovoltaics; thereby, the CNT-g-P3HT-modified systems, in particular those with shorter P3HT grafts, are better candidates for perovskite technologies.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements also verified the influence of CNT-based modifiers on the photovoltaic characteristics in the perovskite devices (Fig. 5). The EQE spectra of the devices were in good agreement with the J–V measurements. The CNT-g-P3HT precursors having short and long P3HT grafts increased the EQE of the perovskite devices and thus reflected the higher Jsc values (23.60 and 22.73 mA cm−2). As the third well-functioned system, perovskite + CNT-g-PDDT represented acceptable EQE (Fig. 5). In large contrast, the unmodified CNTs decreased the intensity of EQE spectra and thus destroyed the perovskite grains and photovoltaic characteristics. In conclusion, the surface modification of CNTs, in particular with crystallizable polymers such as P3HT, can positively affect the morphology, crystallinity, charge-transfer resistance, current density and finally the device performance of the perovskite solar cells. The Jsc values determined from the EQE measurements (Table 1) were somehow less than the normal Jsc values obtained on the basis of the J–V data. Also, AM 1.5 applied in the EQE system indicated standard data, whereas it was simulated using a Xenon lamp in the case of a solar simulator. Hence, it was possible to have different values in both systems. All photons were not also transmitted to the active region where the conversion process occurred.

Bare CNTs and their grafted nanostructures with irregioregular (CNT-g-PDDT) and regioregular (CNT-g-P3HT) polymers were applied to improve the morphological, optical, and photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells. The bare CNT precursors exhibited a negative effect on the morphological and optical properties of active layers, thus destroying the photovoltaic characteristics of the fabricated solar cells. It was witnessed that the presence of bare CNTs decreased crystallinity, absorbance, and grain sizes. On the contrary, both CNT-g-PDDT and CNT-g-P3HT improved the cell characteristics. The self-ordering polymer grafts such as P3HT may induce double crystallinity in the active layers, thereby increasing the crystallinity and grain sizes simultaneously. The CNT nanostructures grafted with shorter P3HT backbones demonstrated the best results (79.9 Ω, 23.60 mA cm−2, 76%, 0.97 V and 17.40%).
