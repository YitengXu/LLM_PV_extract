A novel diphenylimidazole derivative (PTN), which shows strong excimer emission, has been designed and utilized in organic solar cells (OSCs). The extended solid-state excimer emission facilitates intra-system self-absorption and accelerates photon trapping in OSCs. The ternary OSC based on PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM using a green solvent (ethylbenzene) exhibits a high PCE of 11.44%, which is 28.40% higher than that of the binary device (8.91%). The great enhancement is mainly ascribed to the increased self-absorption in the system. Furthermore, the well-organized stacking of PTN is beneficial to promote overlap between small molecules and polymers and then accelerates intermolecular energy transfer. The most important thing to note is that ternary OSCs fabricated both with halogen and nonhalogen solvents show better air, thermal and light irradiation stability, compared with the control device. Over 55 days of air storage, the PCE of the unpackaged ternary OSC still remains at 76%, whereas the control device becomes inefficient. The performance is among the best results for both efficiency and stability in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based solar cells, which can narrow the gap between laboratory investigations and industrial production.

Solvent-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively investigated for their superiority in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE), large-panel production and environmentally friendly manufacturing. A traditional bulk heterojunction binary system, which contains one donor and one acceptor, can form a bicontinuous network interpenetrating structure to accelerate exciton dissociation and charge collection. To further enhance device efficiency, tandem OSCs which are constituted of two or more subcells were fabricated to capture more photons in a wide range of the solar spectrum and utilize photons more efficiently than conventional single-junction OSCs. Until now, the PCEs of tandem OSCs have exceeded 17%, which is the peak efficiency for solar cells. However, the complexity of the device structure and inevitable utilization of halogenated solvents suggest that tandem OSCs still have a long way to achieve all-round development.

In comparison with tandem OSCs, the ternary strategy, which adds a third component into a binary system to broaden the absorption spectrum and promote interaction between the donor and acceptor, is emerging as a promising candidate to realize environmentally friendly high performance devices with a simple structure. Generally, according to different characteristics of the third component, device performance can be optimized in terms of short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and environmental stability, individually or synergistically. A category of third components showed a complementary absorption spectrum to the host system, so ternary OSCs containing this type of component would show a significant enhancement in the blend absorption spectrum. As a result, the increase of photon acquisition probability causes an enhancement in JSC as well as PCE. For example, L. Xiao and his co-workers doped a small molecule DPPEZnP-O with complementary absorption in a polymer:fullerene system, and the JSC rose from 14.99 mA cm−2 for the binary OSC to 17.22 mA cm−2 for the ternary device. Other kinds of third components could improve morphological characteristics and charge transport properties by intermolecular π–π stacking. G. Zhang et al. introduced a nematic liquid crystalline small molecule BTR into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system, which can optimize the film morphology with reduced π–π stacking distance and enhanced domain purity, and therefore, an ultra-high FF of 75.3% and a PCE of 10.1% have been obtained for ternary OSCs. Besides, environmental friendliness and stability also are non-negligible issues in developing high performance solar cells. Although few OSCs can be fabricated with a green solvent process, nearly all of the recently reported high-efficiency OSCs are fabricated with halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene, orthodichlorobenzene and chloroform, which are harmful to the atmosphere and cannot be effectively degraded in the human body. Therefore, while focusing on high efficiency, the third component should not only possess the ability to increase device environmental stability as some studies reported, but also have good solubility in green solvents. Unfortunately, few reports can assemble all these advantages (complementary absorption, efficient molecular stacking, great environmental stability and green solvent process) in an OSC.
For organic optoelectronic devices, intermolecular interactions among each component play an important role in energy processes. Excimers, which serve as an important excited state, have been widely investigated by the scientific community for the past several decades. To form a molecular excimer (AA)*, a monomer A which is in the ground state has been excited by an excitation source such as light radiation. The excited monomer then couples with another monomer A (unexcited) to form the excimer. The formation of excimers is closely related to the distance between their monomers. For white organic light emitting diodes (WOLEDs), the extended and strong excimer emission helps constitute a saturated emission spectrum that is similar to a black body. Similarly, this specific property of excimers can also be used in organic solid state lasers (OSSLs). In the field of OSCs, excimer formation is an adverse process (terminal loss mechanism) in perylene derivatives based organic photovoltaics; this is because the photo-generated excitons would be confined to the excimer state, and a small amount of excitons could diffuse to the dissociative interface. Therefore, numerous efforts have been invested to suppress excimer quenching or transfer the excimer state. Just as R. H. Friend's, M. E. Thompson's and P. E. Keivanidis's groups state, the excimer process facilitates the singlet fission instead of fluorescence quenching. However, few reports focus on the contribution of excimers in high performance ternary OSCs.
To integrate the aforementioned excellent functions, we designed and synthesized a novel small molecule PTN (4′-(4,5-diphenyl-1-(4-(10-phenylanthracen-9-yl)phenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine) to construct green solvent processed ternary OSCs, in which PTN can form emission switching excimers to enhance intra-system self-absorption and accelerate exciton separation in the solid state film. Concurrently, PTN also has good solubility in the biodegradable green solvent ethylbenzene (EBz). For solar cell fabrication, polymers PTB7 (poly-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene) and PTB7-Th (poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl) were used as donors, respectively. Fullerene PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) was used as an acceptor. The two host systems had great compatibility and were widely investigated in the field of OSCs. After rigorous modulation, PTN-containing ternary OSCs fabricated with EBz solvent showed remarkable efficiency and stability enhancement compared to the control devices. The improvement can be attributed to (i) excimer induced emission switching, which enhanced host intra-system self-absorption to yield high JSC; (ii) efficient π–π stacking that caused an interpenetrating network to accelerate charge transport; and (iii) the favourable green solvent solubility and great compatibility with the host system which enable ternary blend films with self-sufficient morphology. Benefitting from the above advantages, the PTB7:15% PTN:PC71BM based green OSC shows a high PCE of 10.43% and a 29.90% enhancement compared to a PTB7:PC71BM binary device. To further extend the universality of the third component PTN, small molecules are also doped in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system. Undoubtedly, a remarkable PCE of 11.44% has been obtained with an increase of 28.40%. Furthermore, the device stability under continuous light irradiation, with thermal annealing and under air conditions has been investigated. The test demonstrated that PTN can improve device stability, especially when fabricated using EBz, after thermal annealing for 180 min, and the PCE still remains above 85%. During 55 days of air storage, the efficiency also remained at the initial efficiency of 76%.

The raw materials and solvents utilized in the synthesis were received from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. PTB7-Th (m.w. 125000) and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material and American Dye Source, respectively. The transport layer material PEDOT:PSS was bought from Xi'an p-OLED Technology Corp. MoO3 and the solvents used in spin-coating process were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Chemicals.

ITO covered glasses with sheet resistances lower than 15 ohm per square are utilized as substrates for OSC devices. Cleaning procedures are similar to the above mentioned methods. For materials preparation, the ZnO film was synthesized according to previous work. For the binary device, PTB7 or PTB7-Th and PC71BM were blended at a ratio of 1:1.3, wherein the donor concentration was maintained at 12 mg mL−1 in CB or EBz solvent. The donor:acceptor ratio was also kept at 1:1.3, in which the donor consisted of PTB7 or PTB7-Th and small molecule PTN in various proportions. CB and EBz solvents were utilized for each device in this work. A 3.0 vol% additive DIO (1,8-diiodooctane) was added to the mixture and then stirred in a nitrogen-filled glovebox for 24 h. The ZnO film was formed by spin coating the precursor solution at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and then the ZnO-covered substrates were annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour in air. After that, the active layer solution was spin-coated onto the ZnO buffer at 1500 rpm for 30 s in a glovebox to yield a 120 nm film. After active layer formation, the substrates were delivered to a vacuum deposition chamber, and 10 nm MoO3 and 150 nm Ag were deposited at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1 and 3 Å s−1, subsequently. An active area of 2 mm2 was formed using a shadow mask.


The electroluminescence (EL) spectra were measured by fabricating an organic light emitting device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTN/LiF/Al. The spectra were collected via a Spectrascan PR655 photometer under atmospheric conditions. The J–V properties were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured with a Varian Gemini-400 spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed and mass spectra were recorded using a vario MICRO select and PE SCIEX APIMS spectrometer, respectively. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed using a TA Instruments TGAQ50 and a TA Instruments DSC2910. The optical absorption spectrum was recorded with a Hitachi U-3010 UV-VIS spectrophotometer and the photoluminescence spectrum was measured with a HITACHI F-4600. The PL lifetime was measured using a Horiba JobinYvon FL-TCSPC fluorescence spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a CHI-660E electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode system. Nitrogen saturated DCM was used as the solvent with 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte.

The performance of OSCs was measured under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight (Newport Oriel Sol3A Simulator, which is calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell before utilization) with a Keithley 2400 source meter instrument. The EQE was determined using a QTEST HIFINITY 5 (Crowntech Inc., USA). The thicknesses of the functional layers were determined using a step profilometer (AMBIOS-XP2). Active layer morphologies were investigated using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) under ambient conditions. TEM was performed using a scanning-probe microscopy (SPM) system (Hitachi TEM system) at 100 kV in “Ceshigo Research Service, https://www.ceshigo.com”. For sample preparation, the active layer solution was spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS (50 nm) covered substrates under nitrogen conditions. Then substrates were placed in a water-containing culture dish. After a few seconds, the organic-phase film would separate and float on the water, and the film was raised with a TEM lacey copper grid. The water contact angle (WCA) measurements were performed using a CAM 200 optical contact angle meter.

To investigate whether excimer emission was utilized in OSCs, two similar third components, PTN and PPN, were designed and characterized. The synthetic route and chemical structure of PTN and PPN are shown in Scheme 1; the introduction of a phenyl-anthracene unit endows PTN with a local stacking effect which can promote charge transport in the neat film. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 1(a), PTN shows deep blue emission in diluted tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (10−5 mol L−1) for a large intermolecular distance, while the formed neat film presents a wider and red-shifted emission spectrum. This phenomenon can be well differentiated in their fluorescence images shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The absorption spectra in both THF solution and film show similar waveforms, except for a small amount of red shift in the solid, suggesting that PL emission peaks in the solution and the film originate from the same ground state. Giving a glance at Fig. 1(c), PPN showed similar absorption bonds to PTN in both solution and film, while their PL spectra are entirely different in films, suggesting that PPN exhibits different optical properties from PTN. Fig. 1(b) shows the PL spectra of PTN doped with different proportions of H2O, which corresponds to its fluorescence image at an excitation wavelength of 354 nm. As PTN is almost insoluble in H2O, it would aggregate as the amount of H2O increases. Thus, aggregation-induced emission will be observed in this experiment. As the addition of H2O increases, the intensity of the emission peak around 432 nm became weaker, whereas the peak at 524 nm became stronger. In comparison, PPN only shows solid state enhanced emission without new emission peak generation (Fig. 1(d)). We deduced that the newly appearing emission peak of PTN may be generated by excimer formation.

To further explore the origin of the emission peak at 524 nm, the emission peaks at 432 and 524 nm in the excitation spectra of PTN films were investigated, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(a), recognizable shoulders that peak at around 260, 369 and 390 nm have been obtained for both spectra, indicating that the emission peaks at 432 and 524 nm originated from the same ground state and the emission peak at 524 nm should be excimer emission. The related room temperature time-resolved transient PL decay spectra of the PTN containing solution and films are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). PTN shows a single lifetime in THF solution, indicating that PTN almost entirely exists in the form of a monomer in solution. PTN exhibits two lifetimes in the solid state, demonstrating that it formed an excimer in the solid state. Electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the PTN film were also measured via a solution processed single emission layer OLED to demonstrate the excimer emission. The device was fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTN/LiF/Al. PEDOT:PSS was used as the hole transport layer and LiF was used as the electron injection layer. PTN was dissolved in a chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1) to be used as the precursor solution for the emission layer. The EL spectrum of the OLED is shown in Fig. 2(b), an obvious excimer emission peak at 524 nm with a side peak at 432 nm was obtained, which is in accordance with the PL spectrum in the neat film, suggesting that PTN would form excimers to shift and broaden the emission spectrum of the film. When introducing PTN into a photovoltaic device which possesses a wide absorption range, such as the polymer/fullerene system, the intra-system self-absorption would be enhanced by the broadening and red-shifting of third component emission. The electrical properties of PTN were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and theoretical calculations. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PTN and PPN were measured to be −5.28 and −5.25 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO level and the optical band gap (Eg) obtained from the beginning of the absorption spectrum. The LUMO energy levels of the two small molecules were determined to be −2.24 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to understand the molecular orbital distribution. As shown in Fig. S1, the HOMO is mainly located on the skeleton of PTN, while the LUMO is distributed on the diphenylanthracene group. The π–π stacking effect of the anthracene group is beneficial to enhance electron transport. Besides, PTN shows great thermal stability with a high decomposition temperature (Td) of 507 °C and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 163 °C, which are high enough to give the PTN containing film excellent morphological stability.
Before OSC fabrication, the energy transfer mechanism was investigated by measuring PL spectra of PTB7-Th:PTN blends, in which the PTB7-Th content remained unchanged, while the PTN content ranged from 0% to 20%. Fig. 3(a) shows the absorption spectra of PTB7, PTB7-Th, and PC71BM and the PL spectrum of PTN in films. Compared with the PL spectrum of PTN in THF, PTN shows a broad excimer emission spectrum in the neat film, which covers from 400 to 650 nm with a half-peak width of 166 nm. PTB7-Th shows a wide absorption in the long-wave band (400 to 800 nm) and PC71BM shows an absorption range of 300 to 700 nm. The huge spectral overlap between PTN and host materials indicates that more efficient energy transfer would occur to promote exciton formation. To further demonstrate the energy process between the excimer and PTB7-Th, PL spectra of PTN and PTB7-Th blend films were measured, as shown in Fig. 3(b). With the increase of PTN concentration, the intensity of the intrinsic (418 nm) and excimer (519 nm) emissions declined gradually, whereas the intensity of PTB7-Th emission increased successively, implying that energy transfer indeed occurred between PTN and PTB7-Th. The enhancement of PTB7-Th intensity is attributed to the co-contribution of intrinsic and excimer emissions of PTN. Different from traditional third component molecules, the excimer emission of PTN not only promotes the intra-system self-absorption in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, but also suppresses non-radiative transition induced energy loss. Furthermore, the formation of excimers also demonstrates efficient π–π stacking of small molecules, which is beneficial to accelerated charge transport in OSCs.

Inspired by the emission switching effect of excimers, PTN was added into the PTB7 or PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system to fabricate ternary OSCs, in which PTN not only has complementary absorption with the host system, but also has a huge spectral overlap between the excimer emission and host absorption. To emphasize that the excimer emission of PTN is utilized in ternary OSCs, PPN based ternary OSCs were also fabricated under the same conditions. An inverted device structure, ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, was used as shown in Fig. 4(a), wherein the active layer contains PTB7:PTN:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:PPN:PC71BM with varying third component contents. ZnO was spun with precursor solution to form a 20 nm thin film, and a 120 nm thick active layer was prepared in a glovebox. The weight ratio of the donor and acceptor was kept at 1:1.3, wherein the donor contains PTB7:PTN, PTB7-Th:PTN or PTB7-Th:PPN. The chemical structures of PTB7, PTB7-Th, PTN, PC71BM and the used solvents are listed in Fig. 4(b). EBz was used as a green solvent in this series of experiments and CB processed OSCs were also fabricated as control devices. The concentration of PTN or PPN was tuned from 0% to 20% to optimize photon harvesting, which is a prerequisite for obtaining high efficiency ternary OSCs. A larger doping ratio was not utilized in the device to avoid serious phase separation. For the calculation of average OSC performance, more than 20 samples were fabricated for testing each parameter. Fig. 4(c) shows the energy diagram of the used materials and energy processes occurring in PTN based ternary OSCs. The major holes are generated in the PTB7-Th or PTB7 domain, and the small molecule PTN mainly acts as a light absorber in active layers. The unique excimer emission of PTN guarantees a huge overlap between the PL spectrum of PTN and the absorption spectrum of the donor, and additional photon energy will be delivered to PTB7-Th or PTB7 via efficient energy transfer. This process will generate extra excitons and then dissociate more free charges, and as a result, JSCs of PTN containing devices will be greatly enhanced. Fig. S2(a) and 4(d) respectively show the absorption spectra of PTB7:PTN:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM blends, in which PTN was varied from 0% to 20%. As the doping ratio of PTN increases, the absorption band located at 300–450 nm shows an enhancement, which is ascribed to the addition of PTN to the system to yield complementary absorption with host materials. The much larger doping ratio of PTN would decrease the absorption intensity (Fig. 4(d)), which is probably due to the excessive doping ratio of PTN that could disturb the crystallization and alignment of host materials. Besides, an overlarge domain size of high concentration doped films can also result in several individual blend regions and results in degradation at short wavelength. As for the absorption region of 600–800 nm, the absorption intensity increases at first and then gradually declines, which differs from traditional ternary OSCs that show sustained intensity degeneration on increasing the content of the third component. This phenomenon can be explained by the competitive relationship between the reduced PTB7-Th (PTB7) and enhanced energy transfer from the excimer to PTB7-Th. Giving a glance at the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, when the doping ratio of PTN rose to 15%, the intensity of PTB7-Th also kept constantly increasing, indicating that energy transfer is the primary factor of the doping ratio below 15%. The intensity shows a downward trend when the content of PTN exceeds 15%, which is attributed to a substantial reduction in the donor content. Fig. S2(b) reveals the absorption spectra of PPN containing blend films, and as the content of PPN increases, the absorption intensity shows a more serious decrease in the range of 600–800 nm, indicating that PPN shows weaker interaction with the polymer.

Fig. S3(a) and (b) show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQE properties of PTB7:PTN:PC71BM based OSCs, and Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the J–V and EQE curves of PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM based OSCs. Detailed performance data are listed in Table 1 as well as Table S1. The average properties of the ternary devices with error bars are shown in Fig. S4. The average values were collected from 20 samples. By carefully adjusting the experimental environment, control binary devices fabricated with EBz solvent achieved a PCE of 8.16% for PTB7:PC71BM and 8.91% for PTB7-Th:PC71BM. After adding 5% to 20% PTN into the two binary systems, the PCEs increased and then decreased regularly. As a result, the highest efficiency of PTB7:15% PTN:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:15% PTN:PC71BM achieved 10.43% and 11.44%, whose maximum enhancement rate is about 30% higher than that of the control device. Especially for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, the JSC has increased from 18.66 to 21.47 mA cm−2 and FF has increased from 61.03% to 68.31% when 15% PTN was added. Fig. 5(c) and (d) respectively show the J–V and EQE curves of PPN doped non-halogen ternary OSCs. In comparison, the JSC of PPN based ternary devices only increased from 18.66 to 19.28 mA cm−2, resulting in a lower PCE of 9.77%. The minor enhancement in PPN added ternary OSCs demonstrates that the excimer emission of PTN indeed makes a positive contribution to device performance. The huge improvement of JSC for PTN-based ternary OSCs is mainly attributed to the enhanced energy transfer of excimer-emitting switches, which suppresses non-radiative transition induced energy loss and accelerates exciton formation on PTB7-Th to dissociate more free charges. Furthermore, the stacking effect of PTN is also a considerable factor in JSC enhancement. The FF improvement can be attributed to the optimized film morphology as discussed below. When the doping ratio is increased to 20%, the efficiency declined as the JSC and FF decreased, which is closely related to the domain size of the ternary OSC, as demonstrated by the morphology analysis. As shown by the statistic device performance in Fig. S4, the VOCs show a little change along with the variation of the doping ratio. This is ascribed to the fact that the VOCs of the ternary OSCs are confirmed by the energy gap between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, according to previous reports.

EQE curves of two small molecule doped ternary OSCs were measured to verify the high JSCs, as shown in Fig. 5 and S3. The JSC values calculated from EQE spectra of the binary and ternary OSCs are listed in Table 1, which coincided with the measured JSCs, within 5%. For PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM systems, EQE curves show different variation tends in the long wavelength range, which is ascribed to the different crystallinities and compatibilities for PTB7 and PTB7-Th. After adding PTN into the binary system, ternary OSCs present a remarkable photocurrent response in the whole visible absorption region from 300 to 800 nm. The enhancement in the short wavelength range of 300–450 nm is ascribed to the contribution of PTN. In the long wavelength range of the polymer (500–850 nm), the EQE curve rises first and descends later with increasing PTN doping ratio, which is well consistent with the variation of JSCs shown in J–V curves. The improvement of JSCs is ascribed to the fact that efficient energy transfer between PTN (intrinsic and excimer) and PTB7-Th (PTB7) could promote exciton formation on PTB7-Th (PTB7) and then accelerate more charge transfer from PTB7-Th (PTB7) to PC71BM. To further explicate the contribution of excimer emission in the energy transfer process and exclude the influence of the PTB7-Th proportion, a series of comparison devices have been fabricated using the active layer of PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM (1:x%:1.3), in which the amount of PTB7-Th remained unchanged and that of PTN ranged from 0% to 30%. Fig. S3(c) and (d) show the J–V and EQE curves of these OSCs. When the doping ratio of PTN rises to 10%, a maximum PCE of 10.54% has been achieved for the ternary OSC. In Fig. S3(d), the EQE value has been enhanced over a long wavelength range of 600–850 nm distinctly, as the PTN content was increased from 0% to 15%, suggesting that the excimer emission indeed contributes to energy and enhances exciton formation. Further increasing the doping ratio of PTN to 30%, the device performance and EQE showed a huge degeneration, which is attributed to excessively doped small molecule induced large phase separation and results in low FF. Fig. 5(d) shows the EQE curves of PPN added ternary OSCs, along with the increase of PPN in the donor; the EQE value at 300–450 nm shows a remarkable enhancement, which comes from the intrinsic absorption of PPN. However the absorption at 600–800 nm reveals a continuous decrease, which is different from PTN based OSCs. This phenomenon also demonstrates that the excimer emission of PTN accelerates energy transfer between PTN and PTB7-Th.

To further investigate the origin of enhanced JSC in PTN doped ternary devices, the charge transport abilities of the controlled binary device and PTN doped ternary devices have been investigated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (ue) were evaluated using a hole- and electron- only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al, respectively. Where PEDOT:PSS was deposited on the substrate with a thickness of 30 nm, and ZnO and the active layer were formed under the same conditions as OSC fabrication. Mobility calculations were performed using the Mott–Gurney equation as follows:
JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εrμ((V2)/(L3))
In which ε0 stands for vacuum permittivity and is set as 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1, and εr is the relative permittivity (3.00). μ is the calculated charge mobility. L is the length from the cathode to the anode. V is an external electric field. The mobility data are summarized in Fig. 6(d) and Table 2. μh reduced continually when increasing the amount of PTN from 5% to 20%, with the highest value of 8.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 at 5% blending whereas μe shows sustained enhancement and achieves a maximum value of 8.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 at 20% doping concentration. The degradation of μh is mainly attributed to the reduction of the PTB7-Th ratio and the increase of the PTN doping ratio. However the enhancement of μe is ascribed to the formation of excimers that not only facilitates exciton generation to decompose more free charges, but also constructs an efficient interpenetrating network to facilitate charge transport via π–π stacking between PTNs. Furthermore, introducing PTN into the host system can cause polymer distribution and yield ordered molecular packing, which is demonstrated by Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) as follows. The charge balance properties can be estimated using the specific value of μh/μe, as shown in Table 2. The reference binary film which contains PTB7-Th:PC71BM shows unbalanced charge transport with a μh/μe of 2.12, because fullerene aggregation caused serious phase separation. When the doping ratio of PTN rises to 10% and 15%, ternary OSCs show more balanced charge transport with a μh/μe of 1.19 and 0.97, respectively, which agrees well with the high JSCs of 20.18 and 21.47 mA cm−2 for the two OSCs. On further increasing the content of PTN to 20%, the significant decrease in device performance is caused by the strong charge recombination caused by the unbalanced charge carrier transport (μh/μe = 0.76) and thus the device performance degraded.

In order to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge recombination dynamics of PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM based ternary OSCs, the dependence of JSCs and VOCs on illumination intensity (Plight) has been measured from 100 mW cm−2 to 5 mW cm−2 and is shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Theoretically, the correction between JSC and Plight should agree with the power law connection: JSC ∝ Plightα, in which α refers to an exponential factor and should approach 1.00 to suggest weaker bimolecular recombination in the device. As presented in the inset of Fig. 6(a), all cells in this work show an α value close to 1.00, implying that very weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the OSCs. As the PTN content increases from 0% to 15%, the value improved from 0.93 to 0.99, which highly agrees with the highest JSC and most balanced charge transport properties of the 15% PTN-containing OSC. Monomolecular recombination of the blend film was investigated via regarding VOCs as a function of Plight, with a logarithmic relationship:
where
kB stands for the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, q is the elementary charge and β is the recombination factor. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the control device presents a large slope of ; however, when 15% PTN was doped in the binary system, a much smaller slope of  has been obtained, indicating that monomolecular recombination (Shockley–Read–Hall recombination) is suppressed in PTN-containing OSCs. The suppression of charge recombination is mainly attributed to the balanced charge transport ability and excimer suppressed non-radiation energy loss. The feeble charge recombination implies more efficient exciton dissociation, which can be illustrated by the curves of photocurrent (JPH) versus effective voltage (Veff) of Fig. 6(c).JPH is determined by the difference between JL and JD, where JL and JD respectively indicate the current density of the device under light illumination (100 mW cm−2) and in the dark. Veff is defined by V0 − VA, where V0 is the voltage at JPH = 0 and VA is the applied voltage on the devices. Compared with the control device, PTN doped OSCs reached saturation at lower Veff, suggesting that weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge dissociation occurred in ternary OSCs. When Veff attains a higher value (Veff ≥ 2.0), charge recombination is suppressed by the high internal electric field and JPH saturates at a relatively constant value (Jsat). Charge dissociation probability P(E, T) can be evaluated from the value of JSC/Jsat. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM based control device shows a P(E, T) value of 0.91. When 5% to 20% PTN is added into the system, ternary OSCs show enhanced dissociation ratios of 0.94, 0.96, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. The enhancement of the charge dissociation ratio shows that the introduction of the third component PTN can accelerate exciton dissociation and charge collection, which improves the charge transport in the device and results in high PCE.


The film morphology of PTN containing ternary devices and their control devices was studied by TEM and AFM measurements. Fig. 7(a)–(e) show the TEM results of PTB7-Th:PC71BM films doped with 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% PTN, and Fig. 7(f)–(j) present their AFM images in turn. For TEM images, the bright regions refer to donor materials and dark regions stand for fullerene-rich domains. Without small molecule addition, PTB7-Th:PC71BM film shows noticeable inhomogeneity with large domain sizes of about 50–75 nm (as shown in Fig. 7(a)), which is caused by the serious aggregation of PC71BM domains. Conforming to the AFM image in Fig. 7(f), a high root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.36 nm is obtained for the heterogeneous surface material distribution. When 5–15% PTN was added to PTB7-Th:PC71BM, a remarkable improvement can be observed in both TEM and AFM images, indicating that the introduced PTN can suppress fullerene aggregation. Especially for the 15% PTN blended film, a smaller domain size of 15–20 nm has been realized, which is favorable for exciton dissociation. Besides, a distinct interpenetrating network structure is also formed, as shown in Fig. 7(d), and the unique nano-fiber microstructure provides more donor/acceptor contact interfaces and forms lots of “high-speed” channels to accelerate charge transport. As a result, the generated charge would be transmitted to the electrode as soon as possible, which facilitates exciton dissociation and results in enhanced JSC and FF of ternary OSCs. Concurrently, the 15% PTN containing ternary film also shows the best morphology with a smallest RMS of 0.94 nm, as shown in Fig. 7(i); the uniform appearance implies preferable interface contacts between the active layer and the electrode. When the content of PTN in PTB7-Th:PC71BM increases further, the film shows larger phase separation along with a higher RMS of 1.09 nm, which may be a crucial reason for the degeneration of ternary OSCs.

To explore the distribution of small molecule PTN on the surface of blend films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle (WCA) tests were performed, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (c). The XPS experiment measures the proportion of carbon (C), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) atoms on the film surface, in which S and F atoms only belong to PTB7-Th and N atoms only pertain to PTN. Generally, we ascribe the characteristic peak at about 164 eV to S 2p, 228 eV to S 2s, 402 eV to N 1s and 688 eV to F 1s, respectively. For the control film (black line in Fig. 8(a)), S and F atoms respectively accounted for 4.46% and 0.56%, respectively. As for the ternary film (red line in Fig. 8(a)), the composition of S is 4.40% and F is 0.57%. Surprisingly, N atoms were not found on the surface, suggesting that PTN was distributed inside the ternary film. To verify this judgment, the WCAs were measured as shown in Fig. 8(c). Because different materials have different surface energies, the WCA measurement can qualitatively estimate the distribution trend of each component on the film surface. The pure small molecule PTN film shows a WCA of 74.8°, whereas PTB7-Th and PC71BM films reveal larger WCAs of 99.9 and 87.9°, indicating that PTN has higher surface energy and weaker hydrophobicity than PTB7-Th and PC71BM. Generally, the closer the WCA is to one pure film, the higher the concentration of the component on the surface. As for the control film of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, an angle of 97.1° was achieved, which is much higher than that of the pure PC71BM film and is very close to that of the pure PTB7-Th film. This suggests that PTB7-Th and PC71BM would gather on the surface of the binary film respectively, which agreed well with previous reports. PTN exhibits high hydrophilicity with a WCA of 74.8°, suggesting that the device stability and lifetime would be reduced in the atmosphere if PTN distributes on the film surface. However, the experiment overturned this doubt and yields a WCA of 96.8° for the PTB7-Th:15% PTN:PC71BM film. The results further demonstrate that PTN is distributed inside the active layers, which is conducive to promoting the device stability.
The molecule crystallization and ordering properties of PTN containing films have been investigated by GI-XRD, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Spin casting from its solutions in EBz, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film reveals a π–π stacking (010) peak of about 18.7°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 4.73 Å. When 15% PTN was added to the binary system, the π–π stacking (010) peak moves to 19.6°, with a smaller d-spacing of 4.52 Å and an enhanced intensity, suggesting that PTN had a positive effect on improving the crystallization of polymers. The closer the distance of ternary blend films the better the substantial molecular ordering than the control membrane. A stronger π–π stacking distribution is beneficial to form interpenetrating networks and results in enhanced charge transport ability and improved photovoltaic properties.

Fig. 8(d) shows the possible molecular distributions in PTN containing binary and ternary devices. In PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary OSCs, PTB7-Th reveals an arc-like lamella with a face-on orientation, as most pioneers reported. While PC71BM shows partial aggregation and is inserted into the space between polymers, charge transfer occurs between PTB7-Th and PC71BM via donor–acceptor π–π coupling. When a third component is added into the binary system, PTN crystallized with a face-on orientation and may located between the stack space of PTB7-Ths, which enlarged the stacking distance of PTB7-Th as shown in GI-XRD. Therefore, the inserted PTN could disorganize the distribution of PC71BM and suppress fullerene aggregation, which is beneficial to improve the film morphology and enhance the FF of OSCs. Furthermore, the same molecule orientation of PTB7-Th and PTN promotes charge transfer and results in enhanced JSC. The integration of the above benefits yielded an optimized ternary OSC with a high PCE of 11.44%.

The environmental stability of the non-encapsulated OSCs has been investigated from thermal annealing, light irradiation annealing and atmospheric storage. The thermal annealing test was performed at 60 °C and 80 °C, which are the possible working temperatures of OSCs under AM 1.5 G irradiation. The ternary OSC fabricated with EBz solvent was compared with the traditional CB solvent processed devices, as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9(a) shows the thermal stability of devices continuously annealed at 60 °C in the atmosphere for 180 min. After 60 min annealing, the PCE of the EBz-processed OSC also retains 90% of its pristine state, which is much higher than those of CB-processed ternary devices (86%) and control devices (68%). On further annealing the devices for 180 min, the EBz-processed OSC still retains 81% PCE, whereas the control ternary and binary device only possess 72% and 52%, respectively. Likewise, all devices show similar trends at 80 °C thermal annealing (Fig. 9(b)). The superior thermal stability of 15% PTN containing OSCs is mainly attributed to the introduction of small molecules into the polymer/fullerene system, which induce more ordered molecule arrangements and suppress fullerene aggregation. The light irradiation stability was examined by continuously illuminating these devices under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in the atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 9(c), PTN-based ternary OSCs exhibit remarkable stability i.e. the efficiency of EBz and CB solvent processed OSCs still remains at 73% and 59%, while the control device only retains 41% PCE. The light irradiation stability is mainly attributed to the excimer effect of PTN, which reduces the non-radiative energy transfer and enhances self-absorption of the system.Fig. 9(d) shows the air stability of these devices which were stored under laboratory conditions (T ∼ 25 °C and H ∼ 23%). For traditional fullerene based OSCs, the storage lifetime always remains at 20–30 days in the atmosphere. Giving a glance at our devices, the CB processed control device shows a 50% efficiency decline for 30 days storage and completely loses primary functions after 55 days, which agrees well with pioneers' reports. However, it worth noting that the PTN containing ternary OSC possesses a longer lifetime. After 30 and 55 days storage, the device still retains 87% and 76% PCE compared to the original state. On further testing for 72 days, the efficiency remains at 50% yet. The long life time is mainly attributed to the improved molecule crystallinity and suppressed non-radiative energy loss. Fig. 10 reveals optical microscopy images of binary and ternary films before and after the above mentioned annealing process. Both films show little difference in the original state, while after 60 °C and 80 °C continuous annealing treatments for 180 minutes, the control film exhibits huge changes in “black dots” (around 10 nm), which may be due to the thermal annealing induced fullerene-rich domain aggregation. Such large aggregated blocks can reduce the available donor/acceptor contact interface and obstructive exciton dissociation. Fig. 11(a) shows the J–V curve of the control device and PTN containing ternary device that were annealed at 80 °C for 0–180 minutes. Remarkable degradation in JSCs was clearly observed in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based control device. Similarly, a strong decay in JSC has been quantitatively demonstrated by blending the aggregated fullerenes into a fresh mixture of a polymer/fullerene system. The PTN containing OSC shows optimized JSC degradation as presented in Fig. 11(a). The improvement is attributed to the introduction of PTN that suppresses fullerene aggregation in the active layer. On analyzing the optical microscopy images of light irradiation treatments in Fig. 10, several well-marked congeries (10–100 μm) can be observed in the control film, which are the “arch-criminal” of the decreased light stability. Fig. 11(b) shows the JSC curves of binary and ternary devices that were annealed under 1 sun light irradiation for 0–180 minutes. As the radiation time increased, the control device shows more serious voltage decline than PTN doped ternary OSCs, because the fullerene can be dimerized when exposed to light. The aggregated fullerene could significantly reduce carrier mobility or change film morphology of the active layer, leading to a decline in JSC.


Fig. 11(c) shows a histogram of a group of 30 optimized devices fabricated with a green solvent. The PCEs fall in a centralized region between 10.72 and 11.44% with an average value of 11.13%, and the highest repetitive PCE located at 11.2%. Fig. 11(d) shows the JSC and FF statistics for the 30 devices mentioned above, and it is obvious that all parameters are distributed in a reasonable range, which results in a moderate efficiency output. These statistics demonstrate that high efficiency, excellent environmental stability and green solvent-processed ternary OSCs possess high device repeatability, which is crucial for industrial production in the future.

In this work, a novel diphenylimidazole derivative (PTN) which exhibits strong red-shifting excimer emission has been designed and is utilized to fabricate ternary OSCs. Instead of aggregation induced quenching, PTN formed excimers can facilitate intra-system self-absorption and accelerate photon trapping in devices. Combined with a green solvent (EBz), a successful ternary OSC has been achieved with a high PCE of 11.44%. The improvement of the PTN-containing device is mainly attributed to the increased self-absorption from PTN to the host system. Furthermore, the well-organized stacking of PTN is beneficial to promote the overlapping between small molecules and polymers and then accelerate intermolecular energy transfer. Due to the introduction of small molecule PTN, ternary OSCs show better air storage and thermal and light irradiation stability in both CB and EBz solvents. The high efficiency and excellent environmental stability of PTN doped ternary OSCs provide a novel strategy to realize high performance solar cells.
