This feature article focuses on the relationship between the interfacial structures constructed by molecular self-organization and the properties of organic photovoltaic devices. The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is reviewed for metal and metal oxide/organic interfaces, while surface-segregated monolayers (SSMs) are introduced as a new method for the modification of organic/organic interfaces. Research up to now has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the control of energy levels and other properties at the interfaces to enhance photovoltaic performance. The possibility of more precise control of the interfacial structures is also discussed.

Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have recently attracted much attention as an alternative energy source because of their potential advantages, such as light weight, flexibility, and low fabrication cost. Active layers of OPVs, which contribute to light absorption and current generation, generally consist of two types of organic materials: an electron donor and an acceptor. The intrinsic properties of these materials are essential for the high photovoltaic ability of OPVs. For example, a large absorption coefficient and a broad spectral matching with the solar spectrum are needed for efficient light harvesting. In addition, crystallinity in the solid state and carrier mobility strongly affect the charge transport ability after exciton dissociation. Therefore, to date, many researchers have synthesized new materials for use as the donor and acceptor and utilized them for OPVs. These efforts have produced promising materials that have shown a relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7–8% in OPVs.

Besides the optical and electrical properties of the materials in bulk, the interfaces of materials are important to fully bring out the abilities of the materials to maximize OPV performance. For example, the contact properties at the interfaces between organic materials and metal electrodes (either Schottky or ohmic contact) determine charge extraction efficiency under current flow conditions and therefore could be one cause of the major loss in photocurrent. This interface is also related to charge recombination under an open-circuit condition, which could affect the potential difference in the photoirradiated steady state. To take full advantage of the superior properties of organic materials for OPVs, the charge extraction efficiency and recombination rate at the electrode interface must be optimized to achieve a high short-circuit current density (JSC) and a high open-circuit voltage (VOC).
Another interface in OPVs is the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. This interface has more fundamental importance for OPV performance, because exciton dissociation and the separation of geminate pairs into free charges mostly occur at the interface of two organic materials, which are key processes for photoconversion in OPVs. Reflecting the complexity of molecular based interfaces, many factors have to be taken into account; the energy level offset between donor and acceptor molecules is the driving force for exciton dissociation at the interface. In addition, overlaps between molecular orbitals are related to the rate constant for this process. Thus, the molecular orientation and the distance between the donor and the acceptor at the interface could strongly affect the process through the dipole moments or overlap of molecular orbitals. These factors are equally important for the charge recombination process at the D/A interface. Therefore, it is important to fully understand and precisely control the properties of these interfaces to maximize exciton dissociation and separation.
There are a number of methodologies for tailoring the interfacial properties of OPVs. For example, the introduction of buffer layers (e.g. conductive polymers, small molecules, and inorganic materials) at electrode interfaces is a commonly used means of achieving the selective collection of positive or negative carriers at each electrode. UV-ozone treatment on the hole-collecting electrode surface is also often used to change the work function and to increase surface energy. Also, deposition of a thin metal oxide or metal complex layer at D/A interfaces by thermal evaporation has been investigated. The use of these interlayers or surface treatments in OPVs has been reviewed in the literature.
This feature article focuses on structure and property tuning at interfaces utilizing molecular self-organization. This strategy enables the spontaneous formation of ordered structures at the molecular level, which could not be achieved by conventional film-forming methods. The properties of such interfaces can be rationally tuned by proper design of molecular structures, where knowledge of the developing field of supramolecular chemistry can be useful. Moreover, since the process does not involve complicated or expensive processes, such as thermal evaporation under vacuum, it can be advantageous for practical applications. In particular, to modify the surface of inorganic semiconductors and metals, the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is well established. This approach enables us to obtain very thin and densely packed layers. In this article, the use of SAMs in OPVs will be reviewed mainly from the viewpoint of energy level matching. As recently developed by our group, the use of surface-segregated monolayers (SSMs) is an emerging concept for modifying the surface of organic materials by molecular self-organization. It is compatible with many organic electronic devices, including OPVs, and so we put emphasis on this topic, including some unpublished data on the ionization energy/VOC relationship. In Sections 2 and 3, we will discuss the interfacial modification at electrode interfaces utilizing these self-organized layers. In Section 4, we will apply the interfacial modifications to D/A interfaces. Finally, we will discuss interfacial properties other than the energy level that should be elucidated and controlled to obtain insights into the improvement of OPVs and how interfaces should be tailored to realize this improvement.

In OPVs, indium tin oxide (ITO) is often used as a hole-collecting electrode in normal architectures. However, its work function is typically from 4.5 to 4.7 eV, smaller than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of most organic donor materials, which could be problematic for the construction of ohmic contact. To achieve efficient charge collection at hole-collecting electrode/active layer interfaces and to reduce contact resistance for high JSC and fill factor (FF), energy level tuning at this interface is important. In addition, it is necessary to match the work function of the electrode with the HOMO of the donor in order to realize maximum VOC, determined by the energy level offset between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. It is well known that the modification of electrode surfaces by SAMs of organic materials changes the work function of the electrode, because of their molecular dipole moments. Therefore, many researchers have carried out SAM modification of hole-collecting electrodes to tune their work functions to improve OPV performance. In this section, we review their works, including our unpublished results on laminated interfaces.

Khodabakhsh et al. examined how SAM modification of hole-collecting electrodes affects hole extraction efficiency. They utilized SAMs of three types of chlorobenzene derivatives for modifying the interface between ITO and an organic layer: 4-chlorobenzoylchloride (CBC), 4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (CBS), and 4-chlorophenyldichlorophosphate (CBP). These molecules have permanent dipole moments with different magnitudes. The net dipole moments pointed towards the ITO surface. Therefore, the increased work functions were measured by the Kelvin probe technique for the three SAM-modified ITO materials. The measured work function ΦSAM increased, corresponding to the magnitude of dipole moment μSAM (i.e. ΦCBS (5.1 eV) >ΦCBC (4.94 eV) > ΦCBP (4.9 eV) and μCBS > μCBC > μCBP). Khodabakhsh et al. fabricated bilayer OPVs of CuPc/C60 with the three SAM-modified ITO materials and unmodified ITO. JSC and FF increased when ΦSAM increased, while VOC was almost constant at approximately 0.4 V. JSC increased from 1.27 mA cm−2 for unmodified ITO to 5.88 mA cm−2 for CBS-modified ITO, and FF increased from 0.26 to 0.48. As a result, PCE increased from 0.16% for unmodified ITO (Φ = 4.5 eV) to 1.27% for CBS-modified ITO. This increase was attributed to the efficient hole extraction achieved with the decrease in the interfacial energy offset between the work functions of the modified electrodes and the HOMO of CuPc. Khodabakhsh et al. mentioned other contributions to the increase, such as the better compatibility of the SAM-modified electrode with the CuPc layer and the enhanced electric field at the CuPc/C60 interface, but their results clearly demonstrate that SAM modification is useful for tuning the energy level at the interfaces between hole-collecting electrodes and organic layers, and for optimizing OPV performance.
Kim et al. investigated the effects of SAM modification of ITO on OPV performance from the viewpoints of both the energy level shift and the change in surface energy. They modified ITO with SAMs with the terminal groups –NH2, –CH3, and –CF3. They also measured the work function of modified electrodes by secondary electron emission spectroscopy and found that the work function order was –CF3 (5.16 eV) > untreated (4.7 eV) > –NH2 (4.35 eV) > –CH3 (3.87 eV). They then fabricated mixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs of poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) by spin-coating on modified electrodes. OPV parameters are summarized in Table 1. In the case of as-prepared devices, JSC values showed the same order as the measured work function, because of the enhanced hole extraction induced for the same reason as that in Khodabakhsh et al.'s case. Of the annealed devices, however, the untreated and –NH2 SAM modified devices showed lower performance than the others. This could be explained by the relatively higher surface energy of the untreated and –NH2 SAM surfaces, resulting in severe aggregation of PCBM in active layers, as confirmed by optical microscopy. They concluded that not only the energy level shift generated by the dipole moment but also the morphology change of the active layer induced by the surface energy change should be considered when ITO is modified by SAMs, and in their case, the latter is more important.

Tseng et al. modified a Au electrode with SAMs of alkanethiol and perfluorinated alkanethiol of different lengths (3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-nonafluoro-1-hexanethiol, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol, 1-hexanethiol, and n-hexadecyl mercaptan, labeled as SF, LF, SA, and LA, respectively). The work functions of the modified Au electrodes were measured by photoelectron spectrometry and found to be in the order of LF (5.52 eV) > SF (5.43 eV) > unmodified (5.1 eV) > SA (4.91 eV) > LA (4.62 eV). The directions of the work function shifts were opposite between alkanethiols and perfluorinated alkanethiols, and the longer SAMs gave larger shifts, corresponding to the direction and magnitude of dipole moments. Tseng et al. fabricated OPVs with a Au/(SAM)/pentacene/C60/BCP/Mg:Al structure. The thickness of the Au layer was 10 nm, such that it was semitransparent. OPV parameters are summarized in Table 2. The devices with LF and SF showed a higher JSC than those with LA and SA. This was attributed to the formation of a larger energy offset at the Au/pentacene interface in the cases of LA and SA, resulting in less efficient hole extraction. In addition, the short SAMs of SF and SA gave a higher JSC than the long SAMs of LF and LA, respectively. This could be explained by the fact that the thick SAM layer (LF and LA) inhibited the charge transfer between Au and pentacene. The VOC values of the devices with LF and SF were almost the same, while those of the devices with LA and SA were much lower. Tseng et al. explained that LF and SF increased the work function of the electrode, leading to an ohmic-like contact between pentacene and Au, while LA and SA decreased the work function, leading to Schottky contact. Their work showed that not only the dipole moment but also the length of SAMs should be considered for the optimum modification of electrodes.

Beaumont et al. recently reported an increase in the efficiency of small molecule OPVs with the modification of the ITO electrode with SAMs. They utilized benzoic acid (BA), 4-bromobenzoic acid (BBA), 4-chlorobenzoic acid (CBA), and 4-fluorobenzoic acid (FBA). The work functions of the SAM-modified electrodes were measured by Kelvin probe measurements. The order was found to be FBA (5.05 eV) > CBA (5.02 eV) > BBA (4.88 eV) > UV-ozone-treated (4.80 eV) > BA (4.68 eV). They fabricated bilayer devices (ITO/(SAM)/donor/C60/BCP/Al) with three types of donors: CuPc, ClAlPc, and SubPc. The relationship between measured VOC and the work function of hole-collecting electrodes is shown in Fig. 1. In the case of CuPc devices, there was almost no change in VOC, as reported by Khodabakhsh et al. This was attributed to the fact that the work function of UV-ozone-treated ITO was already close to the HOMO of CuPc, resulting in ohmic contact. In contrast, VOC values of the ClAlPc and SubPc devices increased for all SAM types. BBA, CBA, and FBA SAMs increased the work function of ITO electrodes by the dipole moments, leading to better alignment between the HOMO of the donor and the ITO work function. In the case of the BA-modified ITO, the work function was smaller than UV-ozone treated ITO. Therefore, the improvement was attributed not to energy level alignment but to better compatibility with the overlying organic layers due to the hydrophobicity of the BA-modified ITO. Khodabakhsh et al. also confirmed a similar increase in VOC with the use of SAMs of phosphonic acids with ClAlPc. Their studies demonstrated that VOC decreases from its maximum, as determined by the HOMO/LUMO offset, when the energy level is not aligned well between hole-collecting electrodes and organic layers.
Sharma et al. also reported on the modification of ITO electrodes by SAMs, but they did not confirm any improvement in OPV performance. They utilized SAMs of pentafluorobenzyl phosphonic acid (F5BPA) and 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8-tridecafluorooctylphosphonic acid (FOPA), and measured the work functions of modified ITO electrodes by Kelvin probe measurements. The work functions were in the order of FOPA (5.30 eV) > F5BPA (4.90 eV) > unmodified (4.50 eV). OPV devices were fabricated by using these modified ITO, and the structure was ITO/(SAM)/pentacene/C60/BCP/Al. In this case, however, almost no change in J–V characteristics was observed, while the work function of the hole-collecting electrodes was largely different. Sharma et al. attributed this to the Fermi-level pinning effects between the ITO work function and the HOMO level of organic materials, leading to an unchanged energy barrier height at the ITO/organic layer interface. They obtained the energy barriers for hole injection by analyzing the J–V characteristics of single-layer pentacene diodes with modified ITO electrodes. They utilized an equivalent circuit model to fit the measured J–V characteristics and carried out variable-temperature measurements. They determined the energy barrier height ΦB and confirmed that its value was almost the same for different SAM-modified devices, 0.56–0.60 eV. This variation in the height was smaller than that in the work function (4.50–5.30 eV), and so they concluded that changes in the work functions do not largely affect VOC values.
Armstrong et al. used small carboxylic acid-substituted molecules to modify ITO electrodes. They modified the surfaces of these electrodes by spin-coating or electrochemically growing a layer of PEDOT:PSS. The structures of the cells were ITO/(small molecules)/PEDOT:PSS (spin-coated or electrochemically grown)/copper phthalocyanine/C60/bathocuprine/Al. In both cases, the series resistance of OPV devices decreased and higher values of JSC were obtained. This improvement could be attributed to improvement in the wettability of the organic layers in the case of the modified ITO surfaces.
Hains et al. utilized 4,4′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)-phenylamino]biphenyl (TPDSi2) as SAM molecules and modified ITO electrodes. The device structure they used was ITO/(TPDSi2)/poly(2-methoxy-5-(3′-7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MDMO-PPV):PCBM/Al. They observed a slight increase in PCE from 0.74% in the case without TPDSi2 to 0.92% in the case with TPDSi2. This improvement was explained by a decrease in the degree of electric shorting, which resulted in an increase in VOC from 0.47 V to 0.62 V.
The above examples all used SAM-modified substrates, and organic layers were deposited by either dry or wet processes onto them. In those cases above, however, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that the difference between the surfaces changed the structural parameters of the organic layers at the interfaces, such as crystallinity and orientation, owing to changes in the intermolecular interactions. If physical contact of SAM-modified electrodes on the same organic surface could form electronic contact, one might be able to avoid the surface effect. Kim et al. utilized the soft contact lamination method to modify the Au/organic layer interface in inverted BHJ OPVs. They prepared a Au electrode on glass substrates and picked it up using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp, followed by SAM (3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane) modification. Although they did not measure the work function directly, the molecular dipole moment of the SAM points toward the Au surface, so that the work function of the Au electrode is increased. They laminated a SAM-modified Au layer onto an ITO/P3HT:PCBM substrate prepared by spin-coating. Fabricated OPVs with the ITO/P3HT:PCBM/SAM/Au structure showed a higher VOC of 0.45 V and a higher JSC of 5.45 mA cm−2 than the devices without SAMs (VOC = 0.37 V and JSC = 4.77 mA cm−2), resulting in a higher PCE of 0.79% than that (0.56%) of the device without SAMs. Kim et al.'s work demonstrates that SAM modification of the interface between organic layers and top electrodes is possible.
We previously reported high-performance inverted OPVs and multilayer structures fabricated by the thermal lamination method. This method was utilized for SAM modification of the interface at hole-collecting electrodes and for the investigation of its effect on OPV performance. Cr (0.5 nm) and Au (20 nm) were deposited by successive thermal evaporation onto glass substrates. Seven kinds of para-substituted thiophenol (Fig. 2) were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 1.0 mM. The glass/Cr/Au substrates were dipped in the resulting solution for 12 h in a nitrogen-filled glove box, followed by washing with methanol. Work functions of the glass/Cr/Au/SAM substrates were measured by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (AC-3; Riken-keiki, Japan) in air, and contact angles for water were also measured. The results are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 3. As shown in Fig. 2, the Au work function changed depending on the magnitude of dipole moments. In addition, in the case with the hydrophilic SAMs (X = COOH, OH, NH2, and H), the contact angle for water was smaller than that in the case without SAM, and opposite in the case with the hydrophobic SAMs (X = F, CH3, and CF3). These results indicated that these molecules covered the Au surface. After modification, Cr/Au/SAM films were laminated onto the ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PCBM (P3HT∶PCBM = 1∶0.6 by weight). We measured J–V characteristics of the fabricated devices and plotted each parameter against the work function of the electrodes in Fig. 3. First, VOC increased from around 0.4 to 0.58 V as the work function of the Au electrode increased from 4.2 eV to 5.23 eV. In the case of X = CF3, the work function was large (5.68 eV), but VOC was small (0.53 V). Considering that HOMO of P3HT is around 5.0 eV, these results indicate that the matching of the work function of the hole-collecting electrodes with HOMO of the donor is important in obtaining a high VOC. JSC and FF were not significantly changed by the surface modification. A maximum PCE of about 1.7% was achieved with a work function of about 5.0 eV (X = OH or COOH).

As shown above, with a few exceptions, many works have confirmed the effectiveness of SAM modification of hole-collecting electrodes. These works demonstrate that the control of the energy level and other properties at the interfaces between hole-collecting electrodes and active layers is important for the optimization of OPV performance.

The need for interfacial modification at electron-collecting electrodes is essentially the same as that for hole-collecting electrodes. However, there have been fewer reports about interfacial modification at the interfaces of the former electrodes. This could be attributed to the fact that electron-collecting electrodes in normal architectures are prepared by the deposition of metal on the top of organic layers; therefore, it is not easy to modify the electrode interfaces by SAMs. We will review works on this issue.

Yip et al. introduced a thin layer of ZnO nanoparticles at the interface between active layers and electron-collecting electrodes, and modified the surface of a ZnO layer before electrode deposition. They prepared a ZnO layer on an ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:PCBM film by spin-coating. Self-assembled molecules were then deposited onto the ZnO layer by two-step spin-coating. Molecules in ethanol were deposited and chemical bonding was formed by a first spin-coating, and physically adsorbed molecules were removed by a second spin-coating of pure ethanol. The molecules for SAMs were lauric acid (LA), mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), and perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTDA) (Fig. 4(a)). Metal electrodes were then deposited by thermal evaporation. Yip et al. utilized Ag (Φ = 4.6 eV), Au (Φ = 5.1 eV), and Al (Φ = 4.3 eV) as electrode materials. According to the molecular models, the direction of the net dipole moment of LA and MUA was pointing away from the metal surface, resulting in a decrease in metal work function. Moreover, the direction is opposite to that for PFTDA. However, direct measurement of dipole moments on ZnO was not conducted. The OPV performance is summarized in Table 4. Introducing MUA realized an improvement in efficiency in all the electrode cases. This improvement was attributed to the ohmic contact between ZnO and the metals due to the energy shift by dipole moments (Fig. 4(b)). In addition, the chemical bond between the –SH of MUA and the metal electrodes decreased contact resistance. LA also had the same direction of dipole moment, but the degree of improvement varied for the three metals. They attributed this result to the difference in contact resistance between LA and the metals, depending on metal work function. In the case of PFTDA, performance decreased with small VOC for all the devices because the interfacial dipole moment increased the metal work function, leading to Schottky contact between ZnO and the metals (Fig. 4(b)). This study demonstrated that even high-work-function electrodes, such as Au and Ag, can be utilized as electron-collecting electrodes by tuning the energy level of the devices, and that this is an effective way to improve OPV performance with more stable metal electrodes.

Yip et al. further investigated the effects of dipole moments by various SAMs. They introduced a dipole moment layer at the interface between ZnO and electron-collecting electrodes by modifying ZnO surfaces with SAMs of benzoic acid (BA) derivatives. Magnitudes of the dipole moments were in the order of –OCH3 (−3.9 D) < –CH3 (−2.9 D) < –H (−2.0 D) < –SH (1.5 D) < –CF3 (2.1 D) < –CN (3.7 D), according to calculations from other studies. Again, there was no direct measurement of the dipole moment formation performed at the surface. They fabricated OPVs with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/(SAM)/electrode structure, utilizing Ag, Au, and Al as electrodes, and the results are summarized in Table 4. In general, the devices with SAMs inducing negative dipoles (–OCH3, –CH3, and –H) showed higher performance with higher JSC, VOC, and FF, than those with SAMs inducing positive dipoles (–SH, –CF3, and –CN). These improvements and decreases in performance were attributed to the formation of ohmic contact and Schottky contact by the energy level shift, respectively. In the case of metals with high work functions, such as Ag and Au, marked improvement was observed by introducing SAMs with negative dipoles. Especially in the case of Au, a four-fold increase in PCE was achieved with –OCH3 SAM, compared with the unmodified devices.
Hau et al. modified the interface between a P3HT:PCBM active layer and a ZnO nanoparticle (NP) layer on ITO by using fullerene SAM (C60-SAM). The device structure was ITO/ZnO NP/(C60-SAM)/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. JSC improved from 10.8 mA cm−2 in the case without C60-SAM to 12.0 mA cm−2 in the case with C60-SAM, and FF also improved from 0.55 to 0.61, resulting in an increase in PCE from 3.74% to 4.54%. Hau et al. proposed that this improvement was due to enhancement of the charge selectivity and suppression of the charge recombination at this interface. They further utilized various C60-SAMs with different anchoring groups. In all C60-SAMs, improvement in PCE was observed.
The same group also modified the interface between active layers and TiO2 layers by using various SAMs, including C60-SAM, in inverted devices. The structure they used was ITO/TiO2/(SAM)/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The performance of the device with SAMs was basically higher than that of the device without SAM, with improvements in JSC and FF. The highest improvement was achieved in C60-SAM, and PCE was improved from 2.8% in the case without SAM to 3.8% in the case with C60-SAM. The authors explained this improvement from three aspects: reduction in contact resistance, suppression of charge recombination, and effect on the morphology of the active layer above. These works showed the general effectiveness of C60-SAM in improving inverted OPV performance.
Motiei et al. modified the interface between the active layer and electron-collecting electrode in inverted OPVs with self-propagating molecular-based assemblies (SPMAs). In this case, SPMA relies on the coordination chemistry between the pyridine moiety and PdCl2. ITO surfaces were modified with SPMA of Ru complexes and were used for OPV devices with an ITO/(Ru complex layer)/P3HT:PCBM/V2O5/Al structure. The device with the Ru complex layer showed a higher OPV performance of 3.6%, compared with that of the device with bare ITO (∼1.5%), especially with higher VOC and FF. This was attributed to an increase in shunt resistance from 4.0 × 103 Ω cm2 to 1.1 × 106 Ω cm2 and to a decrease in series resistance from 3.0 Ω cm2 to 2.7 Ω cm2. Better selectivity of electron collection due to appropriate energy levels of Ru complex layers could be one reason for this improvement.
All the works reviewed here are investigations into the surface modification of inorganic semiconductors or metal by utilizing SAMs. We proposed a novel concept for the modification of organic semiconductor surfaces by the self-organization of molecules during a coating process. We utilized a fluoroalkylated fullerene derivative, phenyl-C61-butyric acid 1H,1H-perfluoro-1-octyl ester (F-PCBM, Fig. 5(a)), for the formation of a surface segregated layer. This material had a low surface energy because of its fluoroalkyl chain, and so it spontaneously segregates to the surface of the film during spin-coating when mixed with PCBM solution, which is driven by total energy minimization. We mixed this material with a small amount of P3HT:PCBM solution (P3HT∶PCBM∶F-PCBM = 1∶0.8∶0.1, w/w) and spin-coated it onto an ITO/PEDOT∶PSS film, forming an ITO/PEDOT∶PSS/P3HT∶PCBM/F-PCBM structure. Then, an Al electrode was deposited onto the same film, and J–V characteristics were measured (Fig. 5(b) and Table 5). The device with F-PCBM showed a higher PCE of 3.79% than that without F-PCBM (3.09%). This improvement was mainly attributed to the higher JSC and FF. JSC improved from 8.72 mA cm−2 to 9.51 mA cm−2, and FF improved from 0.64 to 0.70. One reason for these improvements was the formation of a buffer layer of F-PCBM, which could selectively transport electrons. Another reason was the energy level shift induced by the interfacial dipole moment layer. It was confirmed that the fluoroalkyl chain formed an aligned monolayer, resulting in a dipole moment layer on the film surface of PCBM. This dipole moment layer shifted the energy level by around 0.3 eV and its direction pointed toward the film surface. The dipole moments chain could decrease the work function of the Al electrode, resulting in a smaller energy barrier for electron injection and a lower contact resistance (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). This was supported by the series resistance of 2.88 Ω cm2, which is lower than the value of 4.54 Ω cm2 found in the case without F-PCBM. In this work, the only additional process for layer formation is the mixing of a small amount of F-PCBM with the solution; therefore, this methodology can be generally applied to many systems for the energy level tuning of the interfaces at electron-collecting electrodes. In addition, it is important to note that a thin layer of fluoroalkylated materials can be utilized for the surface modification of organic films. We recently expanded this methodology to the modification of organic/organic interfaces, which will be discussed in the next section.

We also utilized another surface-segregated thin layer of poly(dimethylsiloxane)-block-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PDMS-b-PMMA) as an interfacial buffer layer at the electron-collecting electrode in OPVs.X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that PDMS-b-PMMA mixed with the coating solution spontaneously accumulated at the surface of the active layer in a similar way to F-PCBM, which is due to the low surface energy of PDMS. The introduction of a PDMS-b-PMMA layer into BHJ cells of P3HT:PCBM resulted in an improvement in PCE from 3.05% to 3.56% on average. The highest PCE of 3.86% was achieved with 0.4 mg mL−1PDMS-b-PMMA.
There was a subsequent work by Jung et al. using polyethylene glycol–C60 to form a buffer layer with dipole moments at the electron-collecting electrode/active layer interface. Jung et al., in their work, also achieved an improvement in OPV performance by utilizing surface segregation.
As reviewed above, energy level tuning at electron-collecting electrodes is also important for the optimization of OPV performance.

In the previous two sections, we reviewed studies about modification at hole- and electron-collecting electrodes. Such studies demonstrated that the control of energy levels at electrode interfaces is important to achieve ohmic contact and low contact resistance for high performance. However, electrode modification is a methodology to only bring out the photovoltaic ability of active layers, and not to raise their potential. Important device parameters, such as VOC and JSC, essentially depend on the energy level at the D/A interface in active layers. For example, the maximum VOC attainable is related to the energy level offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, and JSC is strongly related to the efficiency of exciton dissociation driven by the energy level offset between LUMOs or HOMOs. In addition, the charge recombination, which is an unfavorable process to achieve a high VOC, occurs depending on the relative position of the energy levels. Therefore, to raise the potential of the active layers for high OPV performance, the energy level tuning at the D/A interface is crucial. There are a few works that precisely modified the D/A interface by self-organization and investigated its effects on OPV performance. Firstly, we will review a report on the modification of inorganic/organic D/A interfaces by SAMs (called “interface modifiers” in the literature). Next, we will introduce our recent work on the modification of organic/organic interfaces utilizing SSMs, with additional results on the continuous control of VOC. Lastly, the selective introduction of dyes at the BHJ interface will be reviewed.

Goh et al. investigated the effects of D/A interface modification on the hybrid organic–inorganic photovoltaic devices. They utilized TiO2 as the acceptor material and P3HT as the donor material. The surface of TiO2 was modified by using SAMs of para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives (Fig. 6(a)). The dipole moments of SAMs were in the order of –SO2F (4.5 D) > –NO2 (3.8 D) > –CN (3.4 D) > –Br (1.4 D) > –H (−2.1 D) > –OCH3 (−3.9 D) > –NH2 (−4.5 D) according to the molecular models. SAMs were deposited onto the FTO/TiO2 surface, followed by the spin-coating of P3HT and the deposition of a Ag electrode. The relation between VOC and JSC values of these hybrid bilayer devices with series SAMs and the magnitude of the molecular dipole moments are shown in Fig. 6(b). Note that the direct measurement of the dipole layer formation on TiO2 was not conducted. SAMs with dipole moments pointing toward TiO2 surfaces decreased VOC by approximately 0.2 V, while those with dipole moments pointing away from TiO2 surfaces increased VOC by at most 0.03–0.05 V. These were explained by the energy level shift at the D/A interface. Dipoles pointing toward TiO2 surfaces decreased the energy level offset between the HOMO of P3HT and the conduction band edge of TiO2, resulting in an increase in the maximum VOC attainable, and opposite for dipoles pointing away from TiO2 surfaces. The enhanced JSC in devices with dipoles pointing toward TiO2 surfaces was explained by the large electron affinity of the SAM, leading to efficient exciton dissociation. These results demonstrate that energy level tuning at the D/A interface in hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells is crucial to OPV performance.
We recently reported on the modification of PCBM/P3HT interfaces in order to investigate the relation between energy levels at the interfaces and OPV performance. The unique point of this work is that this modification is for organic/organic interfaces, unlike the works reviewed above, which modified inorganic/organic interfaces relying on SAMs. In order to achieve this, we combined two techniques developed by our group, namely, SSM and contact film transfer (CFT).SSM is a novel concept for preparing an aligned monolayer on films of organic materials by utilizing surface segregation, which will be explained in the next paragraph in detail. CFT is a method of stacking organic layers under mild conditions by using water-soluble sacrificial polymer layers. Since this method needs neither external pressure nor heat, well-defined, flat organic interfaces can be obtained. In addition, two organic layers can be prepared separately, and so each surface can be analyzed and modified before film stacking. By these two techniques, we tuned the energy levels at the D/A interface by using dipole moments and examined their effect on VOC.
We first developed the concept of SSM with fluoroalkylated fullerene derivatives. Six fullerene derivatives with different lengths of fluoroalkyl chains, FCn (n = 5–10, Fig. 7(a)), were synthesized. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry showed that their molecular electronic properties were essentially the same as that of PCBM. When FC8 was mixed with a small amount of PCBM solution and spin-coated together, the surface F/C atom ratio of the PCBM/FC8 films calculated from XPS spectra and the water contact angle both continuously increased as the concentration of FC8 increased. Moreover, the saturation of these values was observed when the FC8 concentration was around 1.0 mg mL−1, indicating that the surface of the PCBM film was completely covered by FC8 at that point. A schematic of the structure is shown in Fig. 7(b). The surface density of FCn was estimated to be 1.6–1.7 × 10−10 mol cm−2 by optimizing the model using density functional theory calculations. XPS depth profile measurements and angle-dependent XPS of the PCBM/FCn films clearly showed the formation of a monolayer of these materials. In addition, a shift in ionization energy (IE) of 0.20–0.35 eV was observed in the PCBM/FCn films by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), owing to the dipole moments of fluoroalkyl chains. We concluded that the fluoroalkyl chains of FCn point towards the direction of air, which is supported by the results of angle-dependent XPS and sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that FCn forms SSM with dipole moments on PCBM films.
Next, we expanded this concept to polymer materials. For this purpose, a regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene) with alternating alkyl/semifluoroalkyl side chains (poly(4′-dodecyl-3-[1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl]-2,2′-bithiophene)s (P3DDFT in Fig. 8(a))) was synthesized. This material showed essentially the same behavior of surface segregation as FCn when mixed with poly(3-dodecylthiphene) (P3DDT) solution and spin-coated together, which was confirmed by water contact angle measurements, XPS, XPS depth profile measurements, angle-dependent XPS, and UPS. A schematic of SSM structure of this material is shown in Fig. 8(b). The outstanding difference of the material from PCBM/FCn films was in the value of attainable IE shift. In the case of P3DDT/P3DDFT films, the largest IE shift was around 1.8 eV (Fig. 8(b)). To the best of our knowledge, this value is the largest change induced by a molecular dipole moment, even among the work function shifts observed in metal surfaces modified by SAMs. This difference could be partly attributed to the higher surface density of P3DDFT than that of FCn. The maximum surface density of the fluoroalkyl chains of P3DDFT on the P3DDT film calculated from the densely packed surface model was 5.56 × 10−10 mol cm−2. This value is comparable to that of SAMs of fluoroalkylthiol on Au (5.3 × 10−10 mol cm−2).
The above two studies give us a unique opportunity to modify film surfaces of both electron donor (P3HT) and acceptor (PCBM) materials. Two fluoroalkylated compounds, specifically, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 1H,1H-perfluoro-1-nonyl ester (FC8) and P3DDFT, were utilized for the preparation of a dipole moment layer on a film surface. FC8 and P3DDFT were mixed with PCBM and P3HT solutions, respectively, at varying concentrations (PCBM∶FC8 = 10∶0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and P3HT∶P3DDFT = 5∶0, 0.25, 0.50, w/w). The solutions were spin-coated onto each substrate to form SSMs. The results of the surface analyses by XPS and UPS are summarized in Table 6. It was observed that the F/C atom ratio at the film surfaces estimated by XPS was higher than that in solution for all films, indicating the formation of SSMs of FC8 and P3DDFT on PCBM and P3HT, respectively. In addition, the F/C atom ratio and IE increased continuously as the concentrations of FC8 and P3DDFT increased, which indicates that the surface density of dipole moment changed depending on the concentration of fluoroalkylated compounds. These results demonstrate that the magnitude of the energy level shift by the surface dipole moment layers can be controlled by changing the concentration of fluoroalkylated compounds.

After the characterization of SSMs, they were placed at the PCBM/P3HT interfaces by CFT as follows. Glass/PSS/P3HT (or glass/PSS/P3HT/P3DDFT) substrates prepared by successive spin-coating were gently placed upside down onto the ITO/TiO2/PCBM/FC8 (or ITO/TiO2/PCBM) substrates, and a P3HT (or P3HT/P3DDFT) layer was transferred onto the PCBM/FC8 (or PCBM) layer by dissolving the PSS layer with water. A V2O5 hole-transporting layer and Al electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum. The structures of the bilayer OPVs are shown in Fig. 9. The J–V characteristics of the bilayer OPVs under AM 1.5 irradiation are shown in Fig. 10. Note that the directions of interfacial dipole moments were opposite for the two types of SSMs. First, VOC decreased from 0.50 V for PCBM//P3HT (// represents interface prepared by CFT) bilayer OPVs without interfacial dipole moments to 0.31 V for PCBM/FC8//P3HT bilayer OPVs. In contrast, in the case of PCBM//P3DDFT/P3HT OPVs, VOC increased from 0.50 V for PCBM//P3HT OPVs to 0.86 V. The maximum VOC we achieved was 0.95 V, which is the highest reported for the combination of P3HT and PCBM. In addition, VOC changed continuously as the concentration of FC8 or P3DDFT increased. These results clearly demonstrate that the interfacial dipole moments controlled the direction and magnitude of the energy level shift at the junction and therefore tuned HOMO–LUMO energy offset, resulting in precise control of VOC. Furthermore, thermal annealing resulted in VOC values converging to around 0.5 V. The film analyses indicated that intermixing induced by thermal annealing leads to the randomization of aligned dipole moments and the disappearance of electric fields at interfaces. These results indicate that aligned dipole moments at the interface played a key role in the change in VOC. This work was the first to succeed in wide control of VOC by an organic/organic interfacial energy level shift.
In our above work, precisely modified organic/organic interfaces were formed without changing the materials in the bulk. The results clearly showed that interfacial properties markedly affect OPV performance. However, to obtain a flat and well-defined interface and to clearly demonstrate the effect of dipole moments, we utilized a bilayer structure whose D/A interface is small, resulting in a low JSC. In order to obtain higher performance, it is necessary to apply such modification to a system with a large D/A interface, such as a BHJ structure or interdigitated structure on the nanoscale, although such situations are much more complicated. Honda et al. succeeded in improving OPV performance by modifying the P3HT/PCBM interface in a mixed BHJ structure with the introduction of dye molecules. They mixed a dye of silicon phthalocyanine derivatives (SiPc) as a third component with the P3HT:PCBM solution and spin-coated them together, resulting in a ternary-blend BHJ solar cell. In this ternary-blend cell, SiPc was located at the interface between P3HT and PCBM, for the following reasons. The first reason was the surface energy of the material. SiPc had an intermediate surface energy of 23 mJ m−2 between regioregular P3HT (20 mJ m−2) and PCBM (29 mJ m−2), leading to the selective location of SiPc at the interface driven by total energy minimization. The second reason was the crystallization of P3HT and the aggregation of PCBM. SiPc molecules placed at P3HT or PCBM domains can be expelled from each domain. Results showed that JSC increased from 6.5 mA cm−2 for P3HT:PCBM to 7.9 mA cm−2 for P3HT:PCBM:SiPc, while VOC and FF did not change, resulting in an improvement in PCE from 2.2% to 2.7%. They explained this improvement from two viewpoints: additional absorption of the dye and efficient energy transfer from P3HT to SiPc. From the absorption spectra, the P3HT:PCBM:SiPc film exhibited absorption in the 650–700 nm wavelength range originating from SiPc. There was a clear response in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in that range, contributing to a higher JSC. Moreover, the EQE of P3HT:PCBM:SiPc in the 400–600 nm wavelength range increased compared with that in the case without dye. This response corresponds to P3HT absorption, indicating that the introduction of SiPc enhances the exciton dissociation in P3HT. Honda et al. also investigated and revealed in detail the light-harvesting mechanism in this ternary-blend BHJ solar cell by utilizing transient absorption spectroscopy. In addition, they added a silicon naphthalocyanine derivative, which exhibits absorption at around 780 nm as a fourth component, and achieved higher PCE with quaternary-blend OPVs. Although it is not yet clear how such dyes are actually positioned at the interfaces, in terms of orientation and distribution, their study has already indicated that the modification of D/A interfaces is important to control charge separation, even in BHJ OPVs.
In summary, it was shown that D/A interfacial modification is essential to understand the photovoltaic mechanisms in OPVs in detail and to achieve higher OPV performance.

We have reviewed current research works on the modification of the organic/electrode and D/A interfaces in OPVs. The works clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the control of energy levels and other properties at the interfaces for enhancing photovoltaic performance. As shown in Sections 2 and 3, modification of the electrode interface has been reported by many researchers and its effect has mostly been clarified. In contrast, there are still more issues to clarify regarding the effects of modification at the organic D/A interface, as shown in Section 4. Our recent work shows that the shift in VOC is qualitatively consistent with the energy level shift at the interface measured by UPS (Fig. 10). However, the relationship between VOC and energy level shift is not completely linear, indicating that factors other than the dipole moment affect VOC. Above all, there is a clear trade-off relation observed between JSC and VOC. This could be explained by the change in both driving force for exciton dissociation and electronic coupling at the D/A interface, but this is only speculation. Therefore, quantitative analysis of the degree to which these effects contribute to OPV performance is necessary for further understanding of D/A interfaces.

Recently, many researchers have pointed out that the electronic coupling between two organic materials strongly affects OPV performance by analyzing the reverse saturation current with an equivalent circuit model. Experimentally, this concept is not easy to prove, because it is difficult to control only the electronic coupling at the interface without changing the materials in the bulk of the film. Nevertheless, the following tendency has been observed in several examples: large electronic coupling between the D/A and D+/A− states can lead to a large reverse current in the dark and charge recombination under irradiation at the D/A interface, and results in a loss of VOC. Moreover, the electronic coupling between the D*/A (or D/A*) and D+/A− states is related to exciton dissociation, which should be maximized for high VOC and JSC. Therefore, for higher PCE, it is necessary to reduce the electronic coupling between the D/A and D+/A− states and to enlarge that between the D*/A (or D/A*) and D+/A− states simultaneously. To realize this contradictory situation, more precise control of the molecular structure at interfaces is necessary. For example, the molecular orientation between D and A is important; if the electron (hole) density could be accumulated away from the interface in the excited state, and therefore the subsequent charge separation could be facilitated, the photocurrent generation could be more efficient even with lower LUMO–LUMO offsets. In addition, changing the properties, such as energy levels and electronic coupling, at the interface uniformly may not be sufficient for simultaneously enhancing charge separation and suppressing charge recombination. Considering the exciton diffusion process in organic semiconductors, there could be “just enough” D/A interface to dissociate all the generated excitons, and a further increase in the area of the interface may not be beneficial for charge generation, but just lead to greater charge recombination. Therefore, it could be important to arrange efficient charge separation sites at the interface at an appropriate density and, at the same time, to design other parts of the interface to prevent bimolecular charge recombination. This level of control in interfacial molecular structures is quite challenging, but it has the possibility to overcome the limit of OPV performance assumed in a homogeneous interface of a donor and an acceptor.
Our ultimate goal is to apply precise modification to interfaces in BHJ-like structures, which can realize large charge separation interfaces. To this end, molecular self-organization is the only possible method to rely on, since it is impossible to precisely modify such complicated interfaces between various materials.
