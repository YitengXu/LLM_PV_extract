At present, most of the top-performing organic solar cells (OSCs) are processed with high boiling point solvent additives, which usually have a negative effect on the device stability. To overcome this conundrum, we herein introduce a commercially available organic transition metal compound, ferrocene, as a highly volatile solid additive in OSCs. The utilization of ferrocene led to enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) and photostability of PM6:Y6 based OSCs in comparison with the devices processed with a traditional solvent additive. Systematic analysis revealed that the treatment with ferrocene can effectively increase the molecular crystallinity and thus leads to improved charge transport, which accounts for the achieved higher photovoltaic performance in the corresponding OSCs. Moreover, ferrocene was found to exhibit general applicability in five other bulk-heterojunction systems. This work not only demonstrates a cost effective and highly volatile solid additive, but also opens a new possibility toward further improvement of the PCE and stability of OSCs.

The combined efforts in material design, device engineering, morphology control, and theoretical studies have driven the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) to over 17%. Solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) are commonly used to optimize the morphology of the active layers and achieve high performance OSCs. However, the high boiling points of these solvent additives make them difficult to remove in processing and thus lead to inferior stability of the corresponding devices. Alternatively, we report a commercially available organic transition metal compound, ferrocene, as a highly volatile solid additive. This novel solid additive was firstly applied in the PM6:Y6 system, and a high efficiency of 17.4% was realized, which is much higher than that of the device without any additive (15.5%) and processed with CN (16.5%). In addition, higher photostability was demonstrated in the ferrocene treated devices. More importantly, ferrocene was found to be effective in five other different systems. This work indicates that the application of ferrocene is a cost-effective and useful strategy to obtain efficient and stable OSCs.


Organic solar cells (OSCs) offer an appealing choice for harnessing solar energy due to their distinctive properties including low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, etc. Currently, the best-performing OSCs exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 17%. The PCE and the long-term stability are thought to be the most pertinent obstacles for the large-scale production of OSCs. For the development of highly efficient and stable OSCs, the optimization of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is of vital importance.

The use of solvent additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) is one of the most widely used approaches to optimizing the BHJ morphology. These additives have exhibited outstanding effects on promoting the device performance since they can usually adjust the aggregation behavior of the materials and therefore endow well-defined bicontinuous interpenetrating networks. However, high boiling point solvent additives are typically difficult to remove sufficiently. The residual solvent additives could usually cause a undesirable morphological variation and thus accelerated performance deterioration. In addition, it has been proved that the devices processed with solvent additives are susceptible to photodegradation after exposure to simulated sunlight under ambient conditions. Ye et al. also reported that residual solvent additives can exert a negative effect on the reproducibility of the device performance. More importantly, some solvent additives are costly, which holds back the widespread application of OSCs. In this regard, new insights and methods are in urgent need for the optimization of the BHJ morphology of OSCs.
Here, we report a facile approach to boosting the photovoltaic performance and photostability of OSCs by introducing ferrocene into a BHJ as a highly volatile solid additive. Ferrocene is a commercially available organic transition metal compound with an aromatic nature. Due to its fascinating properties, including low cost, stability, and electrical conductivity, it has many applications in a wide range of scientific areas such as catalysts, sensors, aerospace materials and medical science. In the field of OSCs, ferrocene is commonly used as an external or internal potential marker in cyclic voltammetry measurements. Herein, we initially treated a PM6:Y6 blend with ferrocene, and a high PCE of 17.4% (certified as 16.9%) with an unanticipated short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.90 mA cm−2 was obtained, which is much higher than those of the devices processed without any additive (15.5%) and with the CN solvent additive (16.5%). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 17.4% and Jsc of 26.90 mA cm−2 are among the highest results reported for binary OSCs to date. Insightful characterizations were performed to reveal the function of ferrocene. The increased molecular crystallinity, improved charge transport and suppressed charge recombination achieved in the devices processed with ferrocene are thought to be the main reasons behind the high performance. Besides, the OSCs using ferrocene exhibited better photostability than the CN-processed devices. To verify its general applicability, ferrocene was also introduced into five different BHJ systems, which led to enhanced PCEs in all cases. These results illustrate that ferrocene is a promising volatile solid additive for the fabrication of efficient and stable OSCs. This work also affords an important guideline for further development of OSCs in a simple and low cost way.


Fig. 1 presents the chemical structures of ferrocene, and the polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors used in this work. Herein, we mainly took the PM6:Y6 system as a representative to investigate the effect of ferrocene on the BHJ morphology. It should be noted here that, except for Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy measurements, all the samples tested were subjected to post-thermal annealing treatment to achieve the optimum conditions. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption of ferrocene, PM6, Y6 and their blend processed under different conditions are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). It can be seen that PM6 and Y6 exhibit complementary absorption in a wide absorption range, and thus a high Jsc is expected. The absorption of ferrocene is mainly concentrated in the wavelength range of 380–500 nm. Due to the low molar extinction coefficient (114 M−1 cm−1), it is believed that the addition of a tiny amount of ferrocene into PM6, Y6, and the PM6:Y6 blend should have no detectable effect on the absorption spectra.

To explore the effect of ferrocene on the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, devices with different processing conditions were fabricated. Representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2a. The photovoltaic performance of the OSC based on PM6:Y6 without any additive was initially evaluated. A moderate PCE of 15.5% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 25.36 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73 was obtained. However, after the addition of ferrocene (6% weight ratio to the blend), the PCE of the device was remarkably improved to 17.4% (certified as 16.9%, Fig. S2, ESI), accompanied by an extraordinarily high Jsc of 26.90 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.84 V and a FF of 0.77. As far as we know, this efficiency and Jsc are among the highest values reported for OSCs so far. Fig. S3 (ESI) presents the histogram of the PCE parameter in 40 devices processed under different conditions. To investigate the impact of different amounts of ferrocene on the performance of PM6:Y6 based OSCs, we changed the weight ratio of ferrocene to the blend from 5% to 8%. High PCEs over 16.5% still obtained with varied amounts of ferrocene. The corresponding results are summarized in the ESI (Fig. S4 and Table S1). Tables S2 and S3 (ESI) summarize the photovoltaic parameters of CN and ferrocene processed PM6:Y6 devices with different thermal annealing times. Representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI). Besides, OSCs processed with traditional solvent additive CN were also prepared for comparison, which is typically used as the solvent additive for PM6:Y6 binary OSCs. Consequentially, the device adopting CN as the solvent additive produced a maximum PCE of 16.5%, with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 26.21 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.75.
In order to verify its general applicability in OSCs, ferrocene was further applied to OSCs based on different material combinations, including PM6:3TP3T-4F, PBT1-C-2Cl:IT-4F, PM6:PBI-Se, PBT1-C:FOIC, and J52-2Cl:IT-4F. Encouragingly, ferrocene served as a successful additive in all these systems. Better performance, especially higher Jscs, were achieved in the ferrocene treated OSCs compared to those of the devices without any additive and even processed with solvent additives. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It is worth noting that ferrocene can effectively improve Jsc without sacrificing Voc of the corresponding device. In comparison with the OSCs processed with conventional solvent additives, higher Voc values were obtained in the devices using ferrocene as a solid additive, which are even comparable to the device without any additive. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of OSCs processed under different conditions are displayed in Fig. 2b and Fig. S7 (ESI). It can be seen that the introduction of ferrocene in these systems mainly led to higher EQE values in the region of 400–800 nm, contributing to the enhancement in Jsc. The calculated Jsc values are in good agreement with the values achieved from the J–V measurements within a 4% mismatch.

Additionally, we compared the stability of the optimal PM6:Y6 OSCs processed without any additive, with CN and with ferrocene under continuous illumination for 960 min. The details of the photostability test can be found in the Experimental section. As shown in Fig. 2c, the device without any additive demonstrated the best photostability. However, the device treated with ferrocene exhibited evidently superior photostability to that of the CN processed device. In detail, 20% PCE loss occurred at around 840, 480 and 720 min for the control, CN and ferrocene processed devices, respectively. The better photostability achieved in the ferrocene processed device demonstrates the great potential of this novel solid additive for the fabrication of highly stable OSCs.
To probe the origin of the improved Jsc and FF, the saturation current density (Jsat) and charge dissociation probability (P(E,T)) of the optimal devices fabricated under different conditions were measured. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the devices are depicted in Fig. 2d. Jph is denoted as the gap between JL and JD, in which JL and JD represent the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as the difference between V0 and Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied bias voltage. It was found that Jph reached Jsat when Veff approached 2 V, implying that all the excitons inside the devices were dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes. The Jsat values of the devices without any additive, and using the CN and ferrocene additives were 26.26, 26.72 and 27.31 mA cm−2, respectively. The improved Jsat value in the ferrocene processed device confirmed that ferrocene actually assisted the photoharvesting of the PM6:Y6 blend. Under the short-circuit condition, the calculated P(E,T) values for these devices were 95.8%, 96.9% and 97.7%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the introduction of ferrocene facilitated charge extraction and yielded higher Jsc and FF.
The dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Plight) was studied to reveal the influence of ferrocene on the charge recombination of the corresponding device. The power-law equation Jsc ∝ (Plight)α expresses the relationship of Jsc and Plight, in which α represents the extent of bimolecular recombination behavior. As displayed in Fig. 2e, the extracted α values for the devices without and with the CN additive were 0.95 and 0.97, respectively, while for the device processed with the ferrocene additive, α was 0.99, indicating that bimolecular recombination was effectively suppressed in the ferrocene processed device under the short circuit condition. The measurement of Voc as a function of Plight helps study the trap-assisted recombination inside the devices. By calculating the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of Plight, the corresponding mechanism of recombination can be clarified (Fig. 2f). Generally, under the open-circuit condition, if the mechanism is dominated by bimolecular recombination, a slope of kT/q is expected, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. Alternatively, when a signature of monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination is involved, higher dependence of Voc on the light intensity with a slope of 2kT/q will be observed. In this work, the OSCs without an additive and with the CN solvent additive showed slopes of 1.17kT/q and 1.07kT/q, respectively. When using ferrocene as a solid additive, the slope was 1.02kT/q. Such results revealed that the utilization of ferrocene can effectively suppress trap-assisted recombination of the OSCs and therefore contributes to the better performance.
GIWAXS was performed to investigate the molecular packing and orientation of neat and blend films. The 2D GIWAXS diffraction patterns and the corresponding line-cut profiles of the neat films of PM6 and Y6 are shown in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI). The PM6 and Y6 films both showed strong (010) diffraction peaks at qz = 1.68 Å−1 and 1.77 Å−1, in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to π–π stacking distances of 3.74 Å and 3.56 Å, respectively. This suggests that PM6 and Y6 both adopted a preferred face-on orientation of molecular ordering in the neat films. Notably, it can be seen that the treatment with ferrocene did not strongly influence the lamellar stacking and π–π stacking of PM6. But for Y6, the intensities of the lamellar and π–π stacking peaks increased largely both in the in-plane (IP) and OOP directions for the ferrocene processed film, indicating that the processing with ferrocene could endow the Y6 film with a more orderly structure. Such an observation also conveys that the treatment with ferrocene mainly affects the packing of the Y6 acceptor. GIWAXS patterns of PM6:Y6 blend films with different processing conditions are illustrated in Fig. 3. The blend film without any additive also adopted a predominantly face-on orientation, evidenced by the strong lamellar stacking peak (100) in the IP direction and the obvious π–π stacking peak (010) in the OOP direction. When the blend film was treated with ferrocene, the face-on orientation was still maintained, which is favorable for the vertical charge transport. In addition, a more pronounced π–π reflection peak and lamellar peak were observed, demonstrating more ordered molecular stacking and higher crystallinity of the BHJ film. GIWAXS data for the blend films processed with CN were also collected for comparison, and the optimum CN-processed thin film displayed moderate lamellar and π–π stacking in GIWAXS. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the out-of-plane (010) diffraction peaks and the corresponding crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) for the neat and blend films under different conditions are summarized in Table S4 (ESI). The results manifest that the significantly increased crystallinity caused by the addition of ferrocene into the blend should be a major reason for the improved photovoltaic performance achieved in ferrocene processed OSCs.
Subsequently, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was adopted to provide topography information of the films. As shown in Fig. 4, the blend films processed under different conditions all showed similar smooth and uniform surface morphology. Obvious fiber distribution was clearly seen in these films, which has previously been proved to be beneficial to the exciton dissociation and charge transport in OSCs. In detail, the as-cast PM6:Y6 blend film showed a root mean square (RMS) value of 1.12 nm. The BHJ blend using the CN additive showed a RMS of 1.20 nm. The blend film processed with ferrocene exhibited a comparatively larger fibril width and phase separation with a higher RMS of 1.31 nm. We also treated pristine PM6 and Y6 films with ferrocene to investigate the effect of ferrocene. With the treatment with ferrocene, the RMS of the neat PM6 film showed a slight improvement from 1.70 to 2.07 nm, and that of the Y6 film was dramatically enhanced from 1.80 to 7.30 nm (Fig. S10, ESI). This observation suggests that the use of ferrocene could lead to better phase separation of the active layer and a more condensed molecular arrangement, consistent with the GIWAXS results. To study the evolution of the morphology, we collected AFM micrographs with increasing ageing time (Fig. S11, ESI). It was found that with the illumination time increasing, the molecular aggregation becomes stronger, which could result in unfavorable phase separation and oversized domains. Besides, an ordered structure with a well-defined fibrillar structure was observed before illumination. However, with the increase of the light illumination time, the fibril nanostructure becomes more obscure, which also contributes to the degenerated morphology.
The charge carrier mobilities of the blend films under different conditions were evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S12, ESI). Configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Al were employed to measure the hole mobility and electron mobility, respectively. The calculated hole mobility and electron mobility of the devices without any additive were 3.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while for the device processed with CN, the hole mobility and electron mobility were 5.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Upon the treatment with ferrocene, the hole mobility was increased to 6.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron mobility was improved to 7.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The enhanced charge mobility accounts for the higher Jsc and FF achieved in the ferrocene processed devices, which also agrees well with the aforementioned GIWAXS results.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to gain deeper insight into the charge transfer efficiency of the blends under different conditions. After blending the donor and acceptor, obvious PL quenching was observed for both the blend without any additive and the ferrocene treated blend, indicative of the efficient exciton dissociation in the devices (Fig. S13, ESI). As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI), the PM6 pristine film showed an emission spectrum at 700 nm with an average exciton lifetime (τ) of 288 ps, while the pure Y6 film presented a τ of 421 ps at 900 nm. After blending the two materials, τ was significantly decreased to 37 ps at 700 nm, and 57 ps at 900 nm, implying that efficient charge transfer took place in this blend. More efficient charge transfer was verified from a shorter lifetime of 35 ps at 700 nm, and 53 ps at 900 nm in the ferrocene processed thin film. The better charge transfer occurring in the OSC using ferrocene as a solid additive is expected to play a considerable role in improving the device performance.
In view of the combination of characterization discussed above, we speculate the working mechanism of ferrocene in OSCs as follows. The addition of ferrocene into the active layer occupies some space. During the thermal annealing procedure, the ferrocene is volatilizing continuously, leaving PM6 and Y6 more room to aggregate and thus form more compact and ordered molecular structures. We collected the AFM images of the ferrocene processed blend films with different thermal annealing times (Fig. S15, ESI). It was found that with the increase of the thermal annealing time, the root-mean-square (RMS) value increases in sequence (from 0.77 to 0.90 nm), indicative of enhanced molecular aggregation during the thermal annealing process. To verify the working mechanism we proposed, we carried out thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The sample is a blend of PM6, Y6 and ferrocene, and the heating rate is 10 °C min−1. Considering that the volatilization of ferrocene may be slower in the blend, we hold the heating temperature at 100 °C for 15 min. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI), there is a clear weight loss at 100 °C. It is known that the polymer donor PM6 and acceptor Y6 have Td (5% weight loss) over 300 °C. Accordingly, we believe that the weight loss at 100 °C indicates that the solid additive ferrocene volatizes at 100 °C, and ferrocene volatilized completely within 15 min.
Moreover, theoretical calculations were performed to further investigate the molecular interactions of ferrocene/PM6 and ferrocene/Y6 using density functional theory (DFT) (Fig. S17, ESI). The calculated results show that the binding energies of ferrocene with PM6 and Y6 are generally negative and the strongest ones are similar. It seems that the PM6 and Y6 molecules can bridge by ferrocene, which increases the molecular interactions between PM6 and Y6 molecules. It is worthy to notice that the binding energies of ferrocene with PM6 and Y6 are moderate. Therefore, ferrocene can evaporate easily. When ferrocene volatilized completely, a more compact and ordered structure of the molecule is expected. Actually, from GIWAXS result we found that the intensities of the lamellar and π–π stacking peaks of Y6 molecules in the blend increase obviously, and Y6 is much more likely to crystallize than PM6.
Since the remaining ferrocene may become a trap for efficient charge transport, the certification of the volatilization of ferrocene in the blend is necessary. Ferrocene was firstly spin-cast onto ITO and silicon substrates and then heated at 100 °C. We observed that ferrocene can completely volatilize within 70 s (Fig. S18, ESI). In addition, FT-IR spectra and XRF spectroscopy were used to offer more solid proof of the existence of ferrocene in the active layer. From the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 5a), we found that ferrocene exhibited characteristic peaks at 1105 cm−1, 1000 cm−1, 816 cm−1, 488 cm−1 and 476 cm−1. When it was added into the PM6:Y6 blend, the peaks assigned to ferrocene were still clearly seen. As expected, these peaks disappeared after thermal annealing, indicative of the fact that the solid additive was completely volatilized. On the other hand, XRF spectroscopy is a standard technique for elemental analysis using ionization of atoms and energy dispersive spectroscopy of emitted high energy photons (X-rays). The emitted photons are features of specific atomic orbital transitions. We used the strategy of tracing the emitted XRF signals of iron atoms to determine whether there is residual ferrocene. Fig. 5b displays the XRF spectra of PM6:Y6 blends treated under different conditions. The iron Kα and Kβ peaks from the PM6:Y6 blend with ferrocene were located at 6.40 and 7.06 keV. After thermal annealing, the fluorescence signals of iron atoms disappeared. These observations add further credence to the hypothesis that the ferrocene in the blend is completely removed by the heating process.

In conclusion, ferrocene, a commercially available organic transition metal compound, was successfully applied in OSCs as a solid additive. Compared to traditional solvent additives, ferrocene possesses a lower price and better stability; these features make it a desirable candidate for the large-scale fabrication of OSCs. Comprehensive investigations have been performed to study the effect of ferrocene on the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Ferrocene was found to play a vital role by bringing multiple advantageous effects including increasing the molecular crystallinity, promoting the charge mobility and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, after the introduction of ferrocene, PM6:Y6 devices yielded a high efficiency of 17.4%, which is much higher than those of the control device (15.5%) and the device processed with CN (16.5%). We also showed that ferrocene treatment can be effective in different BHJ systems, revealing its general applicability in OSCs. Moreover, we demonstrated that ferrocene can be completely removed from blend via a thermal annealing procedure, thus giving rise to superior stability of ferrocene processed devices. Our work suggests that the utilization of ferrocene as a highly volatile solid additive is a cost-effective yet useful approach toward the fabrication of highly efficient and stable OSCs.
