TiO2 microspheres with a large surface area, high crystallinity, uniform nanostructure and good light scattering properties were synthesized in an acetone–phenol mixed solvent via a simple solvothermal process. X-ray diffraction patterns and electron microscopy images indicated that the prepared TiO2 microspheres had a highly mesoporous structure and were composed of highly crystalline anatase nanoparticles. By tuning the ratio of the mixed solvent, high-quality TiO2 microspheres were obtained with controllable surface areas of 122–168 m2 g−1. Then, the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres were used as the scattering layer of the photoelectrode, which is expected to produce high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared with photoelectrodes with pure TiO2 nanoparticles or mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres, DSSCs based on a photoelectrode with a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer and a microsphere scattering layer yield the highest photoelectrical conversion efficiency of 7.94%. This is because the obtained TiO2 microspheres have a large surface area and exhibit excellent light scattering, allowing for fast interfacial charge transfer, low series resistance, and superior charge collection efficiency. This has been systematically observed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy.

Since the pioneering work by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted wide attention due to their low cost, simple fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (η). Until now, a η of nearly 12% has been presented. Generally, an advanced photoelectrode is one of the most important prerequisites for highly efficient DSSCs. Because the photoelectrode not only functions in the loading of the dye sensitizers and as a pathway for photogenerated electron transfer into the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate, but also allows the electrolytes to diffuse into the anchored dyes. Therefore, extensive efforts have been devoted to designing and preparing advanced photoelectrode materials, featuring a large surface area for more dye loading and a packed microstructure for faster electron transfer and more light scattering. However, it is still a great challenge to simultaneously meet these two criteria in one photoelectrode.

Generally, sintering crystalline titania nanoparticle films have been widely used as photoelectrodes for DSSCs owing to their large surface area for loading more dye molecules. However, the small particle size (∼20 nm) normally results in negligible light scattering, leading to low photon absorption by the adsorbed dye molecules. Recently, much research into the scattering layer has been undertaken to lengthen the photon transport pathway in order to enhance the light harvesting of the dye sensitizers. Two methods have been widely used to fabricate the DSSC scattering layer. One is to choose 1D nanomaterials or large particles, which are added into the TiO2 nanoparticle matrix or on the top of the TiO2 nanoparticle film as a scattering layer. The other method is to use hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures as a light scattering layer for DSSCs, such as mesoporous TiO2 beads, mesoporous TiO2 spheres or aggregates and hollow microspheres. For example, Huang et al. used a light scattering layer of mesoporous TiO2 beads, and thus a high efficiency of 8.84% was achieved. Yuan et al. fabricated a bi-layer photoanode with a mesoporous TiO2 overlayer, giving an efficiency of 8.72%. However, the low surface area of these scattering materials, as well as the manufactured complexity of the photoelectrode, greatly limits their applications in DSSCs. Therefore, it is highly desirable if one could simply introduce unique TiO2 nanostructures with a large surface area as an efficient light scattering layer. This will boost their widespread application in DSSCs.
Conventionally, scattering layer materials are prepared using alcohol or water as an oxygen-supplying solvent. Introducing a new type of solvent is expected to be a good way to increase the surface area of the synthesized scattering layer materials. In this work, the acetone–phenol mixed solvent has been used. The mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres with large surface area, high crystallinity and uniform shape were prepared via a simple solvothermal method. In this case, acetone supplies oxygen, while phenol acts as a structure-directing and pore-forming reagent. Moreover, the ratio of the mixed solvent can be tuned to synthesize high-quality TiO2 microspheres with a tunable surface area. Then, mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres were applied as an efficient scattering layer of the photoelectrode, which was incorporated into DSSCs. Consequently, the DSSCs based on the small TiO2 nanoparticle under-layer and the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microsphere scattering layer photoelectrode exhibit a high photoelectrical conversion efficiency (7.94%). This is much higher than those of DSSCs based on traditional pure small TiO2 nanoparticles (7.11%) and pure mesoporous TiO2 microspheres (7.19%), which are fabricated in this work. Characterization such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were carried out to explore the intrinsic mechanism.

The commercial TiO2 powder (Degussa P25) was obtained from standard sources and used as received. The used Ru complex dye was cis-bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) bistetrabutylammonium (N719, Solaronix SA). The redox electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M LiI (anhydrous, 99%, Acros), 0.05 M I2 (≥99.8%, A. R.), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (99%, Aldrich) and 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (99%, A. R.) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (99%, Fluka). The transparent conducting glass (TCO, F-doped SnO2 layer, sheet resistance = 20 Ω square−1) was used as received. All of the solvents and chemicals used in the experiments were at least reagent grade and used as received.


The typical mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres with different surface areas were obtained by a facile solvothermal process. Generally, tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) was slowly added to an acetone–phenol mixed solvent under vigorous stirring at room temperature. An orange solution was observed, and this mixture solution was stirred for 1 h. The resulting orange solution was transferred into a 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then heated at 150 °C for 24 h. The surface area of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres was controlled by the amount of phenol, and the typical volume ratio of phenol:acetone:TBT was x:30:1 in mL, where x was 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was washed at least 4 times with ethanol. The as-prepared samples were labeled as S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5, respectively. Finally, the samples were sintered at 500 °C (using a ramp of 1 °C min−1) in air for 3 h, and marked as c-S1, c-S2, c-S3, c-S4 and c-S5, respectively.


Two types of TiO2 paste were obtained by mixing 3 mL of TiO2 colloid and 680 mg of TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) or mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres. The TiO2 colloid was prepared following the previously published work. A doctor-blade technique was used to fabricate the photoelectrodes. The longer TCO edges were covered with transparent adhesive tape, which was used as a spacer to control the film thickness. Three types of photoelectrode were fabricated: electrodes with two-layer TiO2 nanoparticles (labeled as C1), electrodes with two-layer c-S1 (labeled as C2), and electrodes with a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer with one-layer c-S1 as a scattering layer (labeled as C3). All of these electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min.

All of the photoelectrodes were immersed in 0.5 mM Ru complex dye in acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1) for 48 h at room temperature. Platinum counter electrodes were fabricated following literature procedures. The dye-sensitized photoelectrodes and Pt counter electrode were fixed together with epoxy resin. The electrolyte was admitted by capillary action.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Rigaku D/max-IIIB diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument operating at 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were carried out with a JEM-3010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Carbon-coated copper grids were used as the sample holders. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured by a TriStar II 3020 at 77 K. The pore size distributions were obtained using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch of the isotherm. Thermogravimetry (TG) measurements were carried out on a thermal analyzer (TGA-7, Perkin-Elmer, USA) using a 2 mm internal diameter Teflon tube, with a heating rate of 10 °C per minute under a flow of air. The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the photoelectrode films were determined by a UV-vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere accessory (Shimadzu UV-2550, Japan).

Photocurrent–voltage curves were measured with an electrochemical workstation (BAS100B electrochemical analyzer, Bioanalytical Systems Inc., USA). A solar simulator (Oriel, USA) with an AM1.5 radiation (1 sun conditions, 100 mW cm−2) filter was used as the light source, calibrated using an Oriel solar simulator radiometer. The irradiation area of the DSSCs with a mask was about 0.12 cm2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed with a computer-controlled IM6e impedance measurement unit (Zahner Elektrik, Germany) and obtained by applying sinusoidal perturbations of 10 mV with a bias of −0.8 V at a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The obtained spectra were fitted with ZsimpWin software based on appropriate equivalent circuits. The electron transport and recombination properties were measured by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) (Zahner Elektrik, Germany). The DSSCs were probed through the photoanode side by a frequency response analyzer using a white light-emitting diode (wlr-01) as the light source. The frequency range was 0.1–1000 Hz. The irradiated intensity was varied from 30 to 150 mW cm−2.
The amount of adsorbed dye was measured by immersing the dye-sensitized photoelectrodes in a 0.02 M NaOH solution in alcohol and water (volume ratio 1:1) for 6 h. Then the resulting solution was quantified with the same UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550, Japan).

From the SEM image of the S1 sample after calcination (c-S1), it can be seen that the obtained c-S1microspheres have uniform size, with a mean diameter of 3 μm (Fig. 1a). The high-magnification SEM image of c-S1 (Fig. 1b) indicates that the obtained c-S1 is packed with TiO2 nanoparticles. The TEM image of the c-S1 (Fig. 2a) further demonstrates that the obtained mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres possess a uniform spherical morphology with a diameter of 3 μm, which agrees with the SEM result. The inset image of Fig. 2a shows the edge sides of the c-S1 microspheres, which clearly confirms that the anatase TiO2 microspheres have a mesoporous structure. The formation of the mesoporous structure results from the stacked TiO2 nanoparticles with diameters of ca. 10 nm. Additionally, the HRTEM image of the TiO2 stacked nanoparticles is presented in Fig. 2b. The highly crystallized structure gives a lattice fringe of about 0.35 nm, which corresponds to the interplanar spacing of the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2.Fig. 2c displays the surface nanoparticle stacks of TiO2 microspheres. It also indicates that the TiO2 microspheres possess a mesoporous structure which formed due to the stacked TiO2 nanoparticles. Measurement of the lattice fringes also gives a d spacing of 0.35 nm, which is indexed to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 2d). The SAED pattern in the inset image of Fig. 2c also illustrates that the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres are polycrystalline. The concentric rings can be ascribed to the diffraction from the (101), (004), (200), (211) and (116) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively.

The XRD pattern of the as-prepared anatase TiO2 microspheres (S1) reacted for 24 h is shown in Fig. 3a. Nine Bragg diffraction peaks (2θ = 25.3°, 37.9°, 48.1°, 54.0°, 55.1°, 62.7°, 68.8°, 70.3°, and 75.0°) corresponding to a typical anatase phase pattern, could be clearly observed (JCPDS no. 21-1272), which are indexed as the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215) planes, respectively. According to the TG curve of S1 prepared at a 24 h solvothermal reaction time (as shown in Fig. S1), it can be seen that two obvious weight losses occur between 30 °C and 100 °C and 250 and 450 °C. The weight loss between 30 °C and 100 °C is mainly attributed to adsorbed moisture or organic solvents. The loss between 250 °C and 450 °C may result from the decomposition of organic impurities. Upon exceeding 500 °C, there is little mass loss, indicating that all of the organic impurities have been removed from the structure. Therefore, the S1 sample is sintered at 500 °C to further improve the crystallinity and effectively remove organic impurities, and is denoted as c-S1. After calcination, the diffraction peaks become narrower, which reveals the larger particle size of the TiO2 domain (Fig. 3b). Based on the Scherrer formula, the average crystallite size of c-S1 was computed as about 13 nm. However, once the calcination temperature reaches 650 °C, the phase transformation of anatase to rutile takes place (Fig. S2).
The effect of different reaction times (t) on the crystalline phase of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres is shown in Fig. S3. It can be clearly seen that at the first reaction time (t < 3 h), the products are amorphous. When the reaction times are further increased (t > 3 h), the amorphous state begins to transfer into the crystallized anatase phase. On further increasing the reaction time to 24 h, a perfect anatase phase is formed with enhanced crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 3a, nine Bragg diffraction peaks of anatase phase can be clearly observed for the materials prepared over 24 h. Additionally, the morphology of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres at different reaction times are also systematically studied. Fig. S4 presents the SEM images of S1 sintered at 500 °C after different solvothermal reaction times of 10 min, 12 h and 24 h. It can be seen that they are all spherical structures with diameters of 2–3 μm, which implies that the increased reaction time does not affect the morphology of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres too much. Namely, the increased reaction time leads to further crystallization of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres without a change in morphology. Therefore, 24 h is an optimal solvothermal reaction time for preparing crystalline anatase TiO2.
Under the same 24 h reaction time, the morphology dependence on the molar ratio of phenol to acetone is also systematically investigated. Compared with a smaller molar ratio of phenol to acetone (1:30, as shown in Fig. 1a), the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres become larger on increasing the molar ratio of phenol, as seen in Fig. S5a–c. However, larger ratios of phenol to acetone result in small irregular TiO2 microspheres (Fig. S5d), when the ratio of phenol to acetone reaches 1:3.
In the previous work, Niederberger et al. and Vioux and Mutin reported that acetone molecules act as the oxygen donor, whose function is the same as the water molecules in the aqueous system. It was demonstrated that acetone is firstly coordinated to the titanium centre and then deprotonated, along with the release of an enolate complex and n-butyl alcohol. Then, the enolate complex attacks another acetone molecule to form a C–C bond-based complex. Later on, the complex reacts with another titanium center to form a Ti–O–Ti bond-based complex. Finally, the release of n-butyl alcohol from the Ti–O–Ti bond-based complex results in the formation of a TiO2 nanoparticle precursor. Generally, crystalline anatase TiO2 nanoparticles are produced in acetone without phenol. Hence, according to the above mechanism, the phenol in our solvothermal reaction may act as a structure-directing as well as pore-forming reagent, resulting in the formation of mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding BJH pore size distribution plots of the resulting products prepared at different ratios of phenol to acetone after sintering at 500 °C are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding parameters are also listed in Table 1. One can see that all of the isotherms are type IV, with type H1 hysteresis loops, indicating the existence of a mesoporous structure. The H1 hysteresis loop, which is associated with the capillary condensation of N2 in the pore, indicates a narrow pore size distribution in the samples. Meanwhile, it can be clearly observed that the c-S1 possesses the highest SBET value of 168.6 m2 g−1.

It has been proved that the porosity (P) and surface roughness factor (R) of the products are the key factors which determine the performance of DSSCs. Therefore, P and R were investigated based on the above adsorption–desorption isotherm results. P can be calculated using eqn (1):
(1)
where
Vp (cm3 g−1) refers to the specific cumulative pore volume, and q is the density (g cm−3) of anatase TiO2. P is approximately 57.7%, 58.4%, 57.7%, 57.0% and 45.0% for c-S1, c-S2, c-S3, c-S4 and c-S5, respectively. An estimation of R can be made using eqn (2):

R = q(1 − P)SBET.
(2)

R is 278.1, 259.7, 240.5, 220.7 and 261.9 for c-S1, c-S2, c-S3, c-S4 and c-S5, respectively. It has been reported that porosity in the range of 50–65%, and a larger value of R of the nanocrystalline TiO2 films employed in DSSCs favors increased dye adsorption. The more the dye is adsorbed in DSSCs, the higher the η of DSSCs.
The light scattering effect of the photoelectrode also plays an important role in influencing the η of DSSCs, which is evaluated by DRS. Fig. 5 shows cross-sectional SEM images of the photoelectrodes with pure TiO2 nanoparticles (a) and with a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer and c-S1 as the scattering layer (b). They present similar film thicknesses of ca. 8 μm. Fig. 6 presents the DRS results of the pure TiO2 nanoparticle (P25) film (denoted as FP25) and films with a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer and the obtained mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres as the scattering layer (labeled as Fc-S1, Fc-S2, Fc-S3, Fc-S4, Fc-S5). Compared with the pure TiO2 nanoparticle film, the other films show higher reflectivity in the visible light region from 600 to 800 nm, revealing that the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres have a higher light scattering effect than the TiO2 nanoparticle. Rather than as a result of the size of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres, the light scattering effect may mainly originate from the porous internal structure of the large TiO2 aggregates, or from some voids formed among the large aggregates, in which the scattered incident light significantly extends the light pathway. Another possible reason may be the formation of some aggregates of small grains, with sizes comparable to the wavelengths of the incident light, during the fabrication of the photoelectrode. The improved light scattering effect can thus increase the light traveling pathway. This results in a greater light harvesting efficiency and a corresponding larger photocurrent. In addition, all of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres possess a comparable light scattering ability.

Compared with the other mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres, c-S1, featuring stacked TiO2 nanoparticles, has been found to display the largest surface area and surface roughness factor (R). This helps to adsorb more dye molecules. Meanwhile, all of the obtained mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres present comparable light scattering capacity, thus the incident light can be effectively scattered, increasing the probability of photon absorption by the dye molecules, which facilitates a higher photoelectrical conversion efficiency. Subsequently, the photoelectrodes with c-S1 as the scattering layer are prepared for high-efficiency DSSCs.

The typical photocurrent–photovoltage curves of C1, C2, and C3 are shown in Fig. 7. The photoelectrodes are prepared in the same batch. The values of the open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η), obtained from the curves, are summarized in Table 2. Each value is taken as an average of at least three samples. The Jsc and η of C2, which has a complete c-S1 photoelectrode, are 15.78 mA cm−2 and 7.19%, respectively. Both are improved compared with the values of C1, based on TiO2 nanoparticles. The improvement in Jsc may be due to the excellent dye loading capacity of the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres with a large surface area and roughness factor. Because the prepared mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres (c-S1) possess a larger roughness factor and a better light scattering capacity, C3, based on a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer and a mesoporous anatase TiO2 microsphere scattering layer, is fabricated for further improving η. As expected, C3 shows an enhanced η of 7.94%. This is improved by about 12% and 10% compared to C1 and C2, respectively. η could be further improved after optimization of the DSSC structure.

It is believed that the photoelectrochemical properties of DSSCs correlate with the dye adsorption amount, the interface charge transfer rate and the charge collection efficiency. Dye loading/unloading measurements were carried out to determine the dye adsorption amount. According to the Lambert–Beer law, the molar concentration of dye unloading from C1, C2, and C3 is 1.10, 1.40, and 1.34 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. Because c-S1 possesses a large surface area and roughness factor, the fabricated C2 and C3 photoelectrodes can realize more dye adsorption. In spite of having lower dye adsorption in C3 than that of C2, the C3 photoelectrode based on a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer with a mesoporous anatase TiO2 microsphere overlayer yields a higher η than the C2 photoelectrode based on mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres. Therefore, the amount of adsorbed dye molecules is only one of the factors which improves the conversion efficiency. The mesoporous anatase TiO2 microsphere light scattering layer also plays a significant role in determining the η of DSSCs. The choice of mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres with a high roughness factor as the scattering layer can effectively improve the performance of DSSCs. To elucidate this, the interfacial charge transport rate, series resistance and charge collection efficiency have been studied by EIS, IMVS and IMPS, respectively.

EIS is a powerful method to investigate internal resistances for the charge-transfer process of DSSCs. The wide frequency range of EIS means it can measure wide-scale internal resistances of each electrochemical step at the same time. DSSCs are complex systems which are composed of several interfaces. A high level of electron accumulation must occur because photogenerated electrons are not extracted immediately at the electrode contact under illumination. Electron transport and recombination in the photoelectrode, charge transfer reactions at the Pt counter electrode and the diffusion constant of I3− can all be studied by EIS. Generally, the impedance at low frequency (0.01–1 Hz) refers to the Nernst diffusion of I−/I3− within the electrolyte. The impedance at high frequency (1–100 kHz) corresponds to the capacitance and charge-transfer resistance at the Pt|I−/I3− electrolyte interface. The medium-frequency response at 1 Hz–1 kHz is related to the photoelectrode–dye|I−/I3− electrolyte interface, where the accumulation of photoelectrons and redox shuttles is expected. The Nyquist diagram of the impedance spectra of DSSCs based on a series of photoelectrodes is shown in Fig. 8. In general, the Nyquist diagram obtained under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 exhibits three semicircles, which correspond to three frequency ranges. However, in this experiment, only the semicircles at middle and high frequencies were observed, associated with the dye-sensitized photoelectrode|I−/I3− electrolyte interface and the Pt|I−/I3− electrolyte interface resistance, respectively. The semicircle at the low frequency region merges with the semicircle at the middle frequency region due to the use of a bias voltage.
According to the physical electrochemistry of this system, the equivalent circuit model fitting the impedance spectra of the DSSCs is shown in Fig. 9. The symbols R and C stand for values of resistance and capacitance, respectively. Rs is the series resistance, corresponding to the sheet resistance of the TCO glass, the contact resistance and the wire resistance.R2 represents the charge transfer resistance between the photoelectrode–dye|I−/I3− electrolyte interface. C2 represents the double-layer capacitance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. ZDif represents the Warburg impedance, referring to the Nernst diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte. The impedance of the finite-length Warburg diffusion is expressed by eqn (3):
(3)
where
RDif = B/Y0, and τ = B2. B is a constant phase element.

According to the equivalent circuit model of Fig. 9, the EIS data obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of C1, C2 and C3 are listed in Table 3. The presented EIS data can explain well the existing interfaces in the DSSCs. It can be seen that R2, representing the interfacial resistance of the TiO2–dye|I−/I3− electrolyte interface, is 14.27 Ω for C1, 11.17 Ω for C2 and 11.78 Ω for C3. A lower interface resistance will result in faster interfacial electron transfer, which favors a higher η. Therefore, both C2 and C3 have a higher η than C1. Meanwhile, the series resistance Rs of C3 (32.70 Ω) is markedly lower compared with that of C2 (41.77 Ω). This may be because the presence of the TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer could benefit a better contact between the layer and the TCO substrate. The lower series resistance also contributes to the higher η. This results in C3 having the highest η. These results are in accordance with the photoelectrical conversion efficiency data discussed above.

In DSSCs, the electron recombination time (τn), the electron transport time (τd), the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) and the electron diffusion length (Ln) are important factors for the performance of DSSCs. They are the consequence of the competition between the recombination and transport of electrons across the photoelectrode. τn and τd are calculated by IMVS and IMPS measurements through eqn (4) and (5), respectively:
(4)
(5)
where
fn and fd are the characteristic frequency minima of the IMVS and IMPS imaginary components, respectively. Building on the data of τn and τd, ηcc and Ln are also calculated according to eqn (6) and (7), respectively:

(6)
(7)
where
L is the photoelectrode thickness. The τn, τd, ηcc and Ln of C1, C2 and C3 as a function of the incident light intensity are shown in Fig. 10. A high ηcc and Ln will result in a high η. C2 has a better charge collection efficiency than C1 because the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres possess a larger roughness factor and a better light scattering capacity. However, as the size of the obtained mesoporous TiO2 microspheres is much larger than that of conventional TiO2 nanoparticles, the C2 based on pure mesoporous TiO2 microspheres has a weaker contact to the conductive substrate than the C1 based on pure TiO2 nanoparticles, which can be proved by the results of the series resistance (Rs) measured by EIS. The weak contact to the conductive substrate disadvantages the electron transport out of the photoelectrode. Consequently, the ηcc of C2 (84.0%) is improved slightly compared to that of C1 (81.5%). In order to further improve the ηcc, C3, based on a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer and a microsphere scattering layer, is fabricated. The TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer improves the adhesion to the contact substrate and the TiO2 microsphere scattering layer possesses a larger roughness factor and an improved light scattering capacity. This means that C3 has a lower Rs, distinctly improving the ηcc. The diffusion length is determined by τn and τd under the same photoelectrode thickness. Because the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres possess a larger roughness factor and an improved light scattering capacity, C2 has a higher τn than C1. However, the pure mesoporous TiO2 microspheres have a weaker contact to the conductive substrate than the pure TiO2 nanoparticles, so C2 has a higher τd than C1. Therefore, the diffusion lengths for C1 and C2 are almost equal. C3, based on a TiO2 nanoparticle underlayer and a microsphere scattering layer, not only has good adhesion to the contact substrate, but the TiO2 microsphere scattering layer also guarantees a larger roughness factor and better light scattering capacity. As a result, C3 has a better diffusion length than both C1 and C2. C3 has the highest ηcc and Ln at the different light intensity irradiances, so it has the highest η. All of these results match very well with the EIS and photocurrent–photovoltage data. The above results strongly demonstrate that the prepared mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres are good candidates for the light scattering layer.

According to the above results, a qualitative model has been proposed to explain the light traveling path in the photoelectrodes based on TiO2 nanoparticles and those with mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres as a light scattering layer. When light goes through the TiO2 nanoparticle photoelectrode, light is partially absorbed by the TiO2 nanoparticles, while the majority of the light directly passes through the photoelectrode (Fig. 11a). On the contrary, when light passes through the photoelectrode with the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microsphere overlayer (Fig. 11b), a fraction of light is directly reflected back into the nanocrystalline underlayer by the mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres, alongside the absorption and transmission. This could effectively increase the light traveling path within the photoelectrode, resulting in a higher light harvesting efficiency and a corresponding higher photocurrent.

In summary, mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres with a large surface area and uniform size (3 μm) have been synthesized in an acetone–phenol mixed solvent by a solvothermal process. Because of the large surface area and excellent light scattering capacity, the DSSCs based on photoelectrodes with TiO2 nanoparticles as the underlayer and mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres as the scattering layer demonstrated a higher photoelectrical conversion efficiency of 7.94%, compared with photoelectrodes based on pure TiO2 nanoparticles or pure mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres. Apart from the above factors, the improved η is also ascribed to the fast interfacial charge transfer, a lower series resistance and a greater charge collection efficiency. This is evidenced by the EIS, IMVS and IMPS measurements. We believe that our synthetic approach and systematic work pave a new route to synthesize hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures, where the advantages of both a large surface area and excellent light scattering properties can be integrated into a single material as an efficient scattering layer for high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells.
