Uniform and well-defined nanopopcorns of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 having an average diameter of 670 nm have been facilely grown on Ti foil via a hydrothermal method and characterized by analyzing electron microscopic images and electron diffraction patterns as well as X-ray photoelectron, photoluminescence, and Raman spectra. The morphology of TiO2 nanostructures on Ti foil has been controlled well by adjusting the volume ratio of H2O2:HF:H2O, VR(H2O2:HF:H2O). Truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals exposing the {001} and {101} facets have grown on the surface of TiO2 nanostructures exposing the {001} facets to produce anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns. Without being treated via any annealing process, our well-defined TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil have been directly employed for photocatalytic materials and dye-sensitized solar cells. Among our prepared samples, anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on Ti foil at a VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have shown the most reduced oxygen vacancy luminescence, the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue, and the highest photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 3.98% as the working electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell.

Nanostructured semiconductors having unique spectroscopic, electronic, and chemical properties have been extensively investigated because of their applications in the fields of catalysis, optoelectronics, and transistors. In particular, titania (TiO2) having a wide band gap (3.2 eV) has received attention as a promising nanomaterial for generating electricity, producing renewable solar hydrogen, and remediating aqueous pollutants. Although new catalytic materials working in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible light region have been studied, remarkably, TiO2-based nanomaterials are still considered to be one of the superior photocatalysts. The basic principle of semiconductor photocatalysis involves the absorption of a photon which leads to electron–hole pair formation. The electron–hole pairs can migrate toward the catalyst surface and initiate redox reactions in which adsorbed organic molecules are oxidized, or they may undergo undesirable recombination. In order to prevent electron–hole recombination, a highly active photocatalyst should have a high degree of crystallinity. TiO2 nanostructures have also attracted great attention as nanomaterials employed in making an electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) although the highest power conversion efficiency of DSSCs has been reported as about 12% due to poor utilization of near infrared light and high recombination of electron–hole pairs in the random network of TiO2 nanomaterials. Single-crystalline and hierarchical rutile TiO2 nanostructures on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass have been reported to show a power conversion efficiency of 1–4% in DSSC applications. However, these nanowire or hierarchical arrays were grown on rigid FTO glass substrates which limited applications in flexible electronic devices. Furthermore, it is well known that the rutile TiO2 exhibits an inferior photovoltaic performance because of less dye loading and slower electron transport compared with anatase TiO2 nanostructures. Thus, it would be very desirable to synthesize anatase TiO2 nanostructures facilely to enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.

Considerable efforts have been devoted to the preparation of high-quality TiO2 nanomaterials for applications in photocatalytic materials and photovoltaic cells. Diverse methods such as chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical syntheses, microwave-assisted hydrothermal syntheses, and sol–gel techniques have been successfully established to prepare anatase TiO2 nanostructures in general. In particular, hydrothermal syntheses of anatase TiO2 nanostructures have been found to be quite advantageous particularly from viewpoints of environmental friendliness, easy upward scaling, and low production cost. Although anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with being treated via a high-temperature post-annealing process have been employed as photocatalytic or photovoltaic materials, the hydrothermal synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanostructures on Ti foil without being treated via any post-annealing process has been hardly reported yet. In addition, the direct photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil have not been reported although ZnO nanowires grown on FTO glass or TiO2 nanowires grown on Ti foil have been utilized in DSSCs.
In this paper, we report the facile one-pot hydrothermal preparation of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil to be employed for photocatalytic and photovoltaic materials directly without being treated via any annealing process. We have controlled the growth of tetragonal anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil hydrothermally by changing the volume ratio of H2O2:HF:H2O, VR(H2O2:HF:H2O). The anatase TiO2 has two low energy surfaces, (101) and (001), which are common for natural crystals. Truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals exposing the {001} and {101} facets have been grown on the (001) surfaces of TiO2 nanostructures to form anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns. Anatase TiO2 crystals exposing the {001} facets have been prepared by using various raw materials such as TiF4, TiCl4, Ti[O(CH2)3CH3]4, and Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 to stabilize the {001} facets. However, the processes employing these raw materials require high temperature, interrupt scaled-up production, and induce hydrolysis. Our well-defined TiO2 nanopopcorns exposing the {001} facets grown on Ti foil have shown high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under UV light irradiation. Anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on Ti foil at a VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have shown the most reduced oxygen vacancy luminescence and the highest photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of 3.98%.

The analytical grade chemicals of Ti foil(s), 30% H2O2(aq), 49% HF(aq), H2PtCl6(s), LiI(s), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide(l), guanidinium thiocyanate(l), acetonitrile(l), methylene blue(s, MB), 4-tert-butylpyridine(l), and valeronitrile(l) were used as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. While N719 dye and Surlyn (SX1170-60) were used as purchased from Solaronix, Pt-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was used as purchased from Pilkington. Deionized water with a resistivity of greater than 18 MΩ cm from a Millipore Milli-Q system was used throughout the experiments. For the typical annealing-free preparation of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil, 20 mL of deionized water, 20 μL of 30% H2O2(aq), 20 μL of 49% HF(aq), and Ti foil (10 × 20 × 0.25 mm3) were loaded into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave of 50 mL capacity. The autoclave was placed in an oven at 180 °C for 6 h and then cooled to room temperature. The Ti foil was removed from the solution and rinsed with deionized water to get rid of residual impurities. We have found the above described optimal conditions for the synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil after we tried diverse experimental conditions. The photocatalytic activities of various concentrations of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns have been evaluated in terms of the degradation kinetics of MB (360 ppm) in 2 mL water under UV (360 ± 5 nm) light irradiation of a 75 W xenon lamp (0.8 mW cm−2) with stirring continuously. Before exposure to UV light irradiation, each sample was stirred in the dark for 90 min to allow it to reach a complete adsorption–desorption equilibrium. For dye adsorption, the working electrode of TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on Ti foil was immersed in anhydrous ethanol containing 0.5 mM N719 dye, and kept at room temperature for 24 h. The counter electrode was prepared by dropping 60 μL of a 0.5 mM H2PtCl6 solution on an FTO glass (8 Ω sq−1) followed by being heated at 400 °C for 20 min in air. Then, the working electrode of TiO2 nanopopcorns on Ti foil and the counter electrode were placed to face each other and the mutual distance was controlled to 60 μm by using Surlyn. The transmittance of Pt-coated FTO was 72% at 500 nm. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.4 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in (85:15 v/v) acetonitrile and valeronitrile. The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.210 cm2.

While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi H-7600 microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained using a JEOL JEM-3000F microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JSM-6700F microscope, and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 DISCOVER diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was monitored using a Sigma Probe ThermoVG spectrometer with an excitation source of Al Kα = 1486.6 eV. Whereas Raman spectra were measured using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon T64000 equipped with an Ar+ laser as the excitation source, photoluminescence spectra were measured employing a Princeton Instruments ICCD576G CCD detector with excitation using 266 nm pulses from a Q-switched Quantel Brilliant Nd:YAG laser of 6 ns. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley model 2400 source measurement unit. A 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel Instruments) was used as the light source to irradiate the counter electrode side of the fabricated dye-sensitized solar cell. The light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter to be AM 1.5G one sun light intensity approximately.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Fig. 1a shows that TiO2 nanopopcorns having an average diameter of 670 nm have been grown directly on Ti foil. Truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals have been grown on the surface of initial tetragonal bipyramidal TiO2 nanoparticles to form TiO2 nanopopcorns (see below). The microstructural details of the anatase TiO2 nanopopcorn have been further provided by measuring the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of Fig. 1b and the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Fig. 1c. The observed lattice-fringe distances of 0.352 and 0.238 nm in Fig. 1b correspond to the spacings of 0.351 and 0.238 nm between the (101) planes and the (004) planes, respectively, of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 04-0477). The average d-spacing values of 0.352 and 0.240 nm observed from the SAED pattern of Fig. 1c also agree reasonably with the standard spacings of 0.351 and 0.238 nm between the (101) planes and the (004) planes, respectively, of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 crystal. Consequently, both the HRTEM image of Fig. 1b and the SAED pattern of Fig. 1c suggest that the nanopopcorn directly fabricated on Ti foil hydrothermally has the single-crystalline structure of the tetragonal anatase TiO2. The observed (101) and (004) planes of the anatase TiO2 nanopopcorn in Fig. 1b are dominant in the {101} and {001} facets, respectively. It has been reported that the {001} facets are especially reactive for anatase TiO2 nanoparticles as the order of the average surface energies is γ{001} (0.90 J m−2) > γ{100} (0.53 J m−2) > γ{101} (0.44 J m−2). Although anatase TiO2 nanoparticles exposing the (001) planes have hardly been observed due to the minimization of the surface energy during a crystal growth process, the TiO2 nanopopcorn of Fig. 1b and c displays the (004) planes as well.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Fig. 2 show that the morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles grown directly on Ti foil at 180 °C for 6 h changes with the increase in the content of HF. Comparing the SEM images of Fig. 2, we note that truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals have grown hierarchically on the surface of initial tetragonal bipyramidal TiO2 nanostructures gradually with the increase in the content of HF to form TiO2 nanopopcorns without changing the sizes of the initial nanostructures largely. Typical TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on Ti foil at a VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have an average diameter of 670 nm with the lengths of the truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals in the range of 30 to 70 nm. HF has been considered to play a crucial role in the formation of TiO2 under hydrothermal conditions. HF dissolves Ti foil to produce a Ti precursor, retards the hydrolysis of the Ti precursor, and reduces the surface energy of TiO2 nanostructures. Theoretical calculations indicate that F− ions can reduce the surface energy of the {001} facets of the anatase TiO2 to a level lower than that of the {101} facets. As a result, both the {101} facets and the {001} facets have grown competitively to produce TiO2 nanopopcorns. Ti4+ ions can react with H2O2 to form a dinuclear complex, Ti2O5(OH)x(2−x) (x = 1–6), which may further retard the hydrolysis of the Ti precursor. The comparatively slow hydrolysis rate could provide adequate time for the formation of the Ti–O chains to grow anatase single crystals and induce F− ions to absorb on the surface of the TiO2 crystals, reducing the surface energy. On the other hand, the SEM images of Fig. S1 (ESI) show that TiO2 nanopopcorns grown directly on Ti foil at 180 °C for 6 h are uniform in size and morphology regardless of the content of H2O2. This suggests that the growth of truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals on the surface of initial tetragonal bipyramidal TiO2 nanostructures is more sensitive to the amount of HF than that of H2O2.
The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) patterns in Fig. 3 of TiO2 nanostructures grown directly on Ti foil at various VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) values without being treated via any annealing process show tetragonal anatase TiO2 structures with lattice constants of a = 3.783 Å, b = 3.783 Å, and c = 9.510 Å (JCPDS card no. 04-0477). Note that the HRXRD patterns hardly show any peaks of the Ti phase from the Ti foil. All HRXRD peaks of TiO2 nanostructures can be indexed to the standard peaks of the anatase TiO2 phase showing a strong preferential orientation of the {101} facets. Fig. 3 and S2 (ESI), as well as Fig. 2, indicate that TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have the best-defined tetragonal anatase structure. Enhanced (101) and (004) peaks in the HRXRD patterns indicate that the {101} and {001} facets are dominant in our TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000. High photocatalytic efficiency is expected for our anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns having the {001} facets preferentially because the {001} facets are more reactive for the dissociative adsorption of reactant molecules compared with the {101} facets (see below). The {101} facets that are most abundant on the surface of bipyramidal anatase nanocrystals have been reported to have low photoactivity since a small amount of Ti atoms is undercoordinated. Note that a large amount of Ti atoms is undercoordinated in the reactive {001} facets. The mean crystallite diameter, d, of nanocrystals can be determined from the line width of a HRXRD peak by using Scherrer's formula 〈d〉 = 0.94λ/(Bcos θB), where λ is the X-ray wavelength, B is the full width at the half maximum of the diffraction peak (radian), and θB is the half angle of the diffraction peak on the 2θ scale. The mean crystallite diameter of TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 has been estimated to be 72.6 nm by using the (101) peak at 2θ of 25.4°.
Both the Raman spectra and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI), respectively, also support that our as-prepared TiO2 nanopopcorns grown directly on Ti foil without being annealed have well-defined tetragonal anatase structures. All the observed six peaks arise from the standard basic Raman modes of the anatase TiO2 phase and any peaks of the TiO2 rutile phase could not be detected at all. It has been known that the tetragonal anatase with two formula units per unit cell has six Raman active modes (A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg), whereas the tetragonal rutile with two formula units per unit cell has four Raman active modes (A1g + B1g + B2g + Eg). The fact that the intensity of the Eg(1) mode in Fig. S3b (ESI) is stronger than any other in Fig. S3 (ESI) also supports that TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have the best-defined tetragonal anatase structure. The XPS spectra can provide further significant information about the surface of TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil. The binding energies of the O 1s of TiO2 nanopopcorns on the Ti foil grown with the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:0.5:1000, 1:1:1000, 1:2.5:1000, and 1:5:1000 have been identified as 529.7, 529.2, 529.1, and 529.1 eV, respectively. The binding energy of O 1s shifts slightly to the lower energy, which is assigned to the crystal lattice oxygen in the Ti–O– of the anatase phase, with the increase in the content of HF. However, the higher energy, which is attributed to the oxygen species of Ti–OH on the surface of TiO2 nanostructures, decreases with the increase in the content of HF. Thus, Fig. S4 (ESI) also suggests that our as-prepared TiO2 nanopopcorns have well-defined anatase structures with a minimal amount of Ti–OH in their surface.

Fig. 4 shows that the photoluminescence spectrum of TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at a VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 2.5:1:1000 is red-shifted by 10 nm from that of TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at a VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 due to the increased presence of oxygen vacancies. The photoluminescence spectra of anatase TiO2 nanomaterials can be considered to have three kinds of physical origins: self-trapped excitons, oxygen vacancies, and surface states. The band at the long-wavelength side of the photoluminescence spectrum of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles has been attributed to oxygen vacancies. The fact that oxygen-vacancy luminescence is weaker in the photoluminescence spectrum of Fig. 4a (ESI) than in any other spectra of Fig. 4 supports that our TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have the best-defined anatase crystalline structure. Fig. S5 (ESI) displays that photo-luminescence is weakest in TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000. This also suggests that our TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have the well-defined –Ti–O– network of the anatase TiO2 with a minimal amount of trap sites and oxygen vacancies.
Fig. S6 (ESI) indicates that the photocatalytic degradation rate constant of MB increases sharply with the concentration of TiO2 nanopopcorns suspended in water, suggesting that our as-prepared TiO2 nanopopcorns have high photocatalytic activity. The photodegradation kinetic profiles of MB in Fig. 5a and their pseudo-first-order kinetic rate plots in Fig. 5b indicate that anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have the most-enhanced photocatalytic activity (see above). The photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanopopcorns without being treated via any annealing process has been evaluated in terms of the degradation kinetics of MB under UV (360 ± 5 nm) light irradiation. The linear relationship of Fig. 5b shows that the photocatalytic degradation of MB follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics of ln(C0/C) = kt, where C/C0 is the normalized MB concentration, t is the reaction time, and k is the rate constant. The photodegradation rate constant in the presence of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 is 3.0 h−1, whereas that in the absence of any TiO2 nanopopcorns is 0.11 h−1, revealing that the photocatalytic rate constant of the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 is 2.9 h−1. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 can be attributed to the 3D hierarchical nanostructures and exposed {001} facets of the anatase nanopopcorns. It has been reported that 3D hierarchical nanostructures have a greater number of active sites than either 0D or 1D architectures do. The {001} facets have been demonstrated to be more reactive to absorb water dissociatively to form hydrogen peroxide and peroxide radicals compared with the {101} facets. Thus, the high photocatalytic activity of our TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 is considered to arise from the preferential {001} facets and the well-defined structure of the anatase TiO2.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves in Fig. 6 indicate that TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on Ti foil perform well as the working electrode of DSSC without being treated via any annealing process. The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs in Table 1, obtained from the J–V characteristic profiles of Fig. 6, reveal that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.5 mA cm−2 from DSSC with TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 is high in particular. The highest current density can probably be attributed to the best-defined anatase crystallinity and the largest surface area of the nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 to absorb dye molecules most effectively. The open circuit voltages (Voc) have been found to be 576, 548, and 518 mV for DSSCs based on TiO2 nanopopcorns on the Ti foil grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000, 1:2.5:1000, and 2.5:1:1000, respectively. The variation of Voc can be attributed probably to different recombination rates in the conduction band of our TiO2 nanopopcorns as discussed above with Fig. 4.Table 1 also indicates that the overall power conversion efficiency of DSSC changes enormously with the working electrode, which was based on TiO2 nanopopcorns on the Ti foil. The power conversion efficiency with TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000, which is 6.6 times larger than that with TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 2.5:1:1000, has been found to be as high as 3.98%. The observation of the poorest efficiency with the sample grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 2.5:1:1000 is probably due to the highest presence of oxygen vacancies as described with Fig. 4 as hydrogen peroxide was used in excess. Thus, we suggest that the highest power conversion efficiency using TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 directly without being annealed results mainly from their largest surface area to absorb dye molecules largely and their best-defined anatase crystallinity to reduce recombination losses effectively.

Well-defined nanopopcorns of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 have been facilely grown on Ti foil hydrothermally to be employed for photocatalytic and photovoltaic materials directly without being treated via any annealing process. Truncated tetragonal pyramidal TiO2 nanocrystals have grown hierarchically on the surface of initial tetragonal bipyramidal TiO2 nanostructures to form TiO2 nanopopcorns exposing the {101} and {001} facets dominantly. The morphology of TiO2 nanostructures with a minimal amount of Ti–OH in their surface has been controlled well by adjusting VR(H2O2:HF:H2O). TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at a VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 have the best-defined –Ti–O– network of the tetragonal anatase TiO2 structure with a minimal amount of trap sites and oxygen vacancies. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of our anatase TiO2 nanopopcorns grown at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 arises from their 3D hierarchical nanostructures and exposed {001} facets. The highest power conversion efficiency of 3.98% using TiO2 nanopopcorns grown on the Ti foil at the VR(H2O2:HF:H2O) of 1:1:1000 as the working electrode of DSSC results from their largest surface area to absorb dye molecules and their best-defined anatase crystallinity to reduce recombination losses.
