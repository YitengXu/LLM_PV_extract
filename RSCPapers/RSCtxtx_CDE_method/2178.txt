A family of ladder-type π-excessive conjugated monomer (dicyclopentathienocarbazole (DCPTCz)) integrating the structural components of carbazole and thiophene into a single molecular entity is synthesized and polymerized by oxidative coupling to yield poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole) (PDCPTCz). Moreover, through the careful selection of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit as a π-deficient building block, the dicyclopentathienocarbazole-based donor–acceptor copolymer (poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PDCPTCz-BT)) is prepared by Suzuki polycondensation. The optical, electrochemical, and field-effect charge transport properties of the resulting polymers (PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT) are not only characterized in detail but also their bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell in combination with PC71BM are evaluated. The values of field-effect mobility (µ) for PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT are 8.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1 and 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.57% is achieved on the PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM device, implying that the push–pull copolymers based on ladder-type dicyclopentathienocarbazole as an electron-donating moiety are promising for organic electronic devices.

Development of efficient organic photovoltaics (OPVs), specifically bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer based solar cells, has become an active area of research in the recent years because of their potential for use in low-cost, lightweight, solution-processable, and flexible large area panels. Significant progresses have been made in the BHJ solar cells using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron-donor material and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron-acceptor, leading to power conversion efficiency up to ca. 4–5%. Although approaches to improving the efficiency of P3HT/PCBM cells are still being disclosed, a congestion in conversion efficiency seems to be reached with P3HT since it harvests photons with wavelengths below ∼650 nm, which covers a small portion of the whole solar spectrum. From a fundamental electronic band gap point of view, semiconducting polymers with low band gaps can powerfully harvest solar energy over a broader spectrum, achieving further improvement of the solar cell performance.


Conjugated polymers incorporating alternating π-excessive and π-deficient aromatic moieties depict significant decrease in their optical band gaps due to the introduction of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) structures, which affords the necessary motivation for further work toward the preparation of novel donor-acceptor materials. Recently, donor-acceptor copolymers based on poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives with different electron-deficient moieties have revealed excellent PCE values (up to 3.6%). Among these classes of molecules, the poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) showed particularly interesting achievement of the optimized solar cell with PCE of 6% in BHJ composites with fullerene derivative as well as remarkable stability at higher temperature for extended periods of time.
To ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and reduce the photocurrent loss in solar cells, high carrier mobility is also needed for the improved polymer solar cells. Therefore, another important synthetic strategy toward better performance of the solar cells is the utilization of ring-fused aromatic architectures since their rigid and flat π-conjugated skeletons are beneficial to attaining a high charge carrier mobility by the formation of densely packed structures owing to the strong π–π interactions in the solid state.
We thus direct our attention toward the synthesis of ladder-type heterocyclic carbazole-cored polymer incorporating thiophene subunits of which the fundamental strategies are based on the following: (i) the planarization by methylene bridges between carbazole and thiophene units can contribute to reduce the band gap as well as to enhance the intrinsic charge mobility. (ii) Furthermore, upon ICT structural design, the ladder-type heterocycle monomer containing carbazole and thiophene rings as electron-rich segments is capable of copolymerization with suitable electron-deficient moieties such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. As a ‘win–win’ strategy, this can potentially produce a copolymer having further low band gap and better charge-carrier mobility, which most likely induces its outstanding features in electronic applications.
Herein, we present a straightforward synthesis toward ladder-type π-conjugated polymeric skeleton containing carbazole and thiophene rings (poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole) (PDCPTCz)) as well as a push–pull copolymer (poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) PDCPTCz-BT)) in which the electron-donating units are the dicyclopentathienocarbazole groups and electron-withdrawing moieties are 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole groups (Fig. 1). In the course of our study to assess a profile along electronic applications of these polymers (PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT), the characteristics of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as well as BHJ solar cells in combination with fullerene, in preliminary form, have been investigated, respectively.

The 2,7-dibromo-N-(2-decyltetradecyl)carbazole (1) was synthesized according to literature method.AlCl3 promoted Friedel–Crafts acylation of 1 with 4-octylbenzoyl chloride gave 2,7-dibromo-N-(2-decyltetradecyl)-3,6-bis(4-octylbenzoyl)carbazole (2), which was coupled under standard Stille-type conditions with 2-tributylstannylthiophene in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst to generate the dithiophene carbazole 3 in 88% yield. Treatment of 3 with 6 equivalents of MeLi in anhydrous THF produced the corresponding dialcohol 4 and the desired dicyclopentathienocarbazole 5 was obtained by intramolecular annulation using boron trifluoride etherate (80%). Subsequently, bromination of 5 by NBS gave the monomer 6 (88%).

The poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole) (PDCPTCz) was synthesized by oxidative coupling of 5 using FeCl3 in anhydrous chloroform. To construct a push–pull system, the copolymer (poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PDCPTCz-BT)) containing the combination of the dicyclopentathienocarbazole as electron-donating units and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as electron-accepting units was designed and synthesized via Suzuki polycondensation (Scheme 1). Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis against PS standard exhibits a number-averaged molecular mass (Mn) of 3.41 × 103 and 1.02 × 104 g mol−1 for PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT respectively with a polydispersity (PDI) of 1.87 and 2.77. Both the polymers (PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT) are readily soluble in organic solvents (THF, toluene, chloroform, etc.).

The UV-Vis absorption of the two ladder-type heteroacene polymers (PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT) is acquired in chloroform solution and in the films as depicted in Fig. 2. The absorption spectra of both the polymers in the solid state are almost identical to those in solution, and almost same featureless characters are observed, respectively. This suggests that there is almost no change in the conformation of both the polymers backbone when going from solution to the solid state. PDCPTCz displays an absorption with a maximum at 535 nm with well-resolved vibronic structure and the sharp edge, arising from π–π* transitions in the polymer backbone, which testifies to the rigidity of the ladder-type polymer. In the case of PDCPTCz-BT, it presents two absorption bands at 410 nm and 617 nm (Fig. 2). The high-energy peak can be associated with π–π* transition of the ladderised carbazole units, whereas the broad band centered at 617 nm is clearly attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the dicyclopentathienocarbazole electron-rich group and the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole electron-withdrawing segment. Notably, the lower-energy absorption (λmax = 617 nm) for PDCPTCz-BT is substantially bathochromically shifted compared to the parent non-fused copolymer, namely poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) (λmax = 550 nm) by Leclerc et al. It has been suggested the rigid and flat π-conjugated framework of PDCPTCz-BT leads to the elongation of π-system along the main backbone by the formation of densely packed structures, resulting in the downhill-energy shift. The optical band gaps (Egopt) for both PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT determined from the absorption onset are 2.17 eV for PDCPTCz and 1.67 eV for PDCPTCz-BT, respectively.


The electrochemical properties of PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a room temperature in acetonitrile. The experiments were carried out using tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte, a platinum working electrode coated with polymer films, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, a Ag wire pseudo-reference electrode, and Fc/Fc+ as the external standard (Fig. 3). The onset oxidation and reduction potentials occur at 0.62 and −1.28 eV versusFc/Fc+ for PDCPTCz and 0.59 and −1.10 eV for PDCPTCz-BT, respectively. According to the empirical equation EHOMO/LUMO = [(Eox/red − EFC) + 4.8] eV, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated as −5.42 and −3.52 eV for PDCPTCz and −5.39 and −3.70 for PDCPTCz-BT, respectively. It is worth noting that the electrochemical band gaps (EgCV = 1.9 eV for PDCPTCz and EgCV = 1.69 eV for PDCPTCz-BT) and optical band gaps estimated from UV-Vis spectra are similar within experimental error. Both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PDCPTCz-BT match well with those of PCDTBT (HOMO = −5.5 eV and LUMO = −3.6 eV) as the acyclic parent polymer, which fits reasonably well with the required electronic levels for BHJ solar cells utilizing PCBM derivatives as the acceptor.


All field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated in the top contact geometry as described in the Experimental section (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b shows the transfer characteristics, |Ids|vs.Vgs and |Ids|1/2vs.Vgs (both at Vds = −60 V), of FETs fabricated using PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT, respectively, as the active layer. These Idsvs.Vgs curves obtained from both PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT are typical of p-type semiconductors, as might be expected from the dicyclopentathienocarbazole building blocks in the main backbone. However, forming push–pull copolymer by introducing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole electron-withdrawing moiety induces significant enhancement of electronic properties. The FET property of the PDCPTCz-BT is significantly higher than that of PDCPTCz. The hole mobilities deduced from the slopes of Ids1/2vs.Vgs are estimated to be µPDCPTCzPDCPTCz = 8.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1 for the PDCPTCz and µPDCPTCz-BTPDCPTCz-BT = 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 for the PDCPTCz-BT. The relatively low hole mobilities are observed in both PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT OFETs as compared to the acyclic carbazole-based alternating copolymers, which can be largely attributed to the low molecular weights of both polymers. However, both PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT provide excellent FET output characteristics with clear saturation (Fig. 4c and d). There are many examples of the application of microwave irradiation as heat source to reduce reaction times and increase the yield and the molecular weight of metal-mediated cross-coupling reactions. Therefore, a microwave-facilitated synthesis of the PDCPTCz-based polymers is underway to improve the molecular weights.


The polymer solar cells had a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The active layer was P3HT/PC71BM at 1:2 weight ratio. It was spin-coated from a solution containing the polymer and PC71BM in o-dichlorobenzene onto an ITO/glass substrate covered by poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS). Thin layers of Ca (20 nm) and Al (80 nm) were thermally deposited under vacuum. All data were obtained under white light AM 1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device performance of a solar cell is determined by the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). The power conversion efficiency (ηe) of a solar cell is given as ηe = (Jsc × Voc × FF) × 100/Pinc, where Pinc is the intensity of incident light.

The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells based on the two blends PDCPTCz/PC71BM and PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM are shown in Fig. 5a. Under the white light illumination, the PDCPTCz/PC71BM-based cell has a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.92 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a fill factor (FF) of 52%, generating a PCE (ηe) of 0.73%. In the case of the solar cell made from PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM, a Jsc of 4.59 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, respectively; combined with a FF of 42%, it gives a PCE of 1.57%, a substantial improvement when compared to that of PDCPTCz/PC71BM, because of its increased photocurrent. This result is in good agreement with the OFET measurements. The hole mobility in pure PDCPTCz-BT is about two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with PDCPTCz. Therefore, this higher hole mobility in PDCPTCz-BT, presumably related to a better organization, can explain the higher value of the Jsc with PDCPTCz-BT. In addition, we cannot count out that lower band gap for PDCPTCz-BT can contribute to higher Jsc than that of PDCPTCz/PC71BM-based cell. As shown in Fig. 5b, the difference in photocurrent between two devices is confirmed by measurement of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra that reveal the photon–current response of devices with respect to the wavelength.
The Voc values of both PDCPTCz/PC71BM and PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM are improved in comparison with P3HT/PC71BM. This is not unexpected due to the carbazole building units in the main chain since the polycarbazole derivatives lead to the relatively deep-lying HOMO energy levels that can potentially increase Voc. This is, indeed, supported by our CV results.
In the case of both PDCPTCz/PC71BM and PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM, the significant lower Jsc values, relative to the BHJ solar cell-based polymers/fullerenes, lead to an overall decrease in PCE (ηe). This may be attributed to one of the following two factors that an undesirable morphology in the BHJ, due to ‘unsymmetrical’ branched solubilizers (decyltetradecyl side chains) or the low molecular weights for the both copolymers (PDCPTCz (Mn = 3.41 × 103 g/mol) and PDCPTCz-BT (Mn = 1.02 × 104 g/mol)), causes a decrease in the Jsc and low efficiency in the BHJ solar cells. Although the efficiencies of both PDCPTCz/PC71BM and PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM show lower PCEs compared to the reported polycarbazole derivatives without ladderization as parent frameworks. In the case of the non-fused D–A copolymer based on carbazole, the significant improved Jsc (up to 10.6 mA cm−2) was achieved only in highly optimized devices, while Voc and FFs remain comparable to our devices made of dicyclopentathienocarbazole-based polymers, such as PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT. Thereby, there is still plenty of room to further improve efficiencies of BHJ solar cells prepared from our polymers. We are currently not only preparing PDCPTCz-BT with improved molecular weight as well as symmetric branched solubilizing groups through new synthetic strategies but also are carrying out the extensive device optimization by utilizing processing additives, different solvents, and thermal annealing, which will most likely result in substantial enhancement of the device performance.

From an electronic structural point of view, we have designed and synthesized a new ladder-type π-conjugated heteroacene with inclusion of both a carbazole core and two outer thiophene subunits, namely dicyclopentathienocarbazole (DCPTCz). The ring-fused DCPTCz monomer is polymerized by oxidative coupling using FeCl3 and copolymerized with the chosen electron-deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole comonomer by Suzuki polymer condensation to afford poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole) (PDCPTCz) and (poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) PDCPTCz-BT), respectively. The absorption spectra of PDCPTCz both in the solution and the thin film show a clear vibronic fine structural band with a maximum at 535 nm which gives evidence of its rigid and coplanar motif. On the other hand, the profile of the donor–acceptor copolymer (poly(dicyclopentathienocarbazole-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PDCPTCz-BT)) reveals more bathocromically shifted absorption spectrum (λmax = 617 nm) and lower band gap (Egopt = 1.67 eV) in comparison with its corresponding parent non-fused polymer (poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT)) due to the further strength of ICT between the electron-rich and the electron-withdrawing segments in the polymer backbone through its planarized molecular skeleton. p-Type organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices, PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT manufactured from solution, have been characterized. In a top-contact geometry, electron mobilities in the saturation regime were found to be µPDCPTCzPDCPTCz = 8.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1 for the PDCPTCz and µPDCPTCz-BTPDCPTCz-BT = 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. We have also characterized the solar cells using the polymers (PDCPTCz and PDCPTCz-BT) respectively in BHJ composites with PC71BM. In the case of the device of PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.57% as a preliminary measurement is obtained. Further improvements are anticipated through a rational push–pull architectural design of new symmetric copolymers containing electron-rich unit based on dicyplopentathienocarbazole.


All starting materials were purchased either from Aldrich or Acros and used without further purification. THF was distilled over sodium/benzophenone. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNRS 600 MHz (Varian USA) spectrophotometer using CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard and MALDI MS spectra were obtained from Ultraflex III (Bruker, Germany). UV-Vis-NIR spectra were taken on Cary 5000 (Varian USA) spectrophotometer. Number-average (Mn) and weight average (Mw) molecular weights, and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymer products were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with Agilent 1200 HPLC Chemstation using a series of mono-disperse polystyrene as standards in THF (HPLC grade) at 308 K. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on Solartron SI 1287 with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. A silver wire, a platinum wire and a glass-carbon disk were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode respectively. The Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an external standard, whose oxidation potential is set at −4.8 eV with respect to zero vacuum level. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation HOMO = −(Eoxonset − E(ferrocene)onset + 4.8) eV. The LUMO levels of polymers were obtained from the equation LUMO = −(Eredonset − E(ferrocene)onset + 4.8) eV.


All p-type OFETs were fabricated on heavily doped n-type silicon (Si) wafers each covered with a thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer with thickness of 200 nm. The doped Si wafer acts as a gate electrode, and the SiO2 layer functions as the gate insulator. The active layer was deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm. All solutions were prepared at 0.5 wt% concentration in chlorobenzene. The thickness of the deposited films was about 60 nm. Prior to vapor-deposition of source-drain electrodes, the films were dried on a hot plate stabilized at 80 °C for 30 minutes. All fabrication processes were carried out in a glove box filled with N2. Source and drain electrodes using Au were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The thickness of source and drain electrodes was 50 nm. Channel length (L) and channel width (W) was 50 µm and 1.5 mm, respectively. All OFET devices were made in the top contact geometry as shown in Fig. 4a. Electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200) under N2 atmosphere. The electron mobility (µ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime:
Ids = (WCi/2L) × µ × (Vgs − VT)2,
where
Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 dielectric (Ci = 15 nF cm−2), VT is the threshold voltage.


The organic photovoltaic cells, with the sandwiched structure of Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer–PC71BM(1:2)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm), were prepared on commercial Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate (15 × 10 mm2) with a sheet resistance of −30 Ohm sq−1 (M & M Tech, Korea). Prior to use, the substrates were cleaned with detergent and deionized water. Then, they were ultrasonicated for 10 minutes in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol respectively and dried in the oven at 100 °C for overnight. The ITO substrates were then kept in UVO cleaner for 1500 s, and were spin-coated (5000 rpm, 60 s) with a thin film (40 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS, Baytron P, H. C. Starck) and baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air. A blend of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (Nano-C, USA) and polymer (2:1, 4.0 mg mL−1 of polymer in o-DCB) was solubilized in chlorobenzene for overnight and filtered through a 0.45 µm PTFE filter, spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 60 s then moved to glove box with filled nitrogen. Those samples were brought into a vacuum system (about 10−7 torr) and a Ca (20 nm) and Al electrode (80 nm) was deposited on the top of the BHJ layer. The active area is 13.5 mm2.

2-Tributylstannylthiophene (2 g, 5.3 mmol) was added to a solution of 2 (2.5 g, 2.3 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (25 mL) and the resulting mixture was purged with argon for 30 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (81 mg, 0.07 mmol) was then added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C overnight. Excess DMF was removed under high vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and treated with 10% HCl solution. The mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite.

A solution of dithiopheno diketone 3 (2 g, 1.8 mmol) in anhydrous THF (30 mL) in a 100 mL Schlenk flask was cooled to −78 °C in an acetone-dry ice bath. Subsequently, a solution of 1.6 M methyllithium in diethyl ether (8 mL) was added to reaction mixture in argon atmosphere. After 1 h at −78 °C, the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred for 12 h and then water was added to quench the reaction. The product was extracted with CH2Cl2 (100 mL), treated with saturated NaCl solution, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was removed in vacuo.
