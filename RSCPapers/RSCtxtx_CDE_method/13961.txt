4,7-Bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (ED-BT-ED) is used as a π (donor–acceptor–donor) bridge between two arms of (E)-1-(2-octyldodecyl)-3-(1-(2-octyldodecyl)-2-oxo-6-(5-(5-(thiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)indolin-3-ylidene)indolin-2-one (ID-T3) to form a novel medium-sized molecule BT(EDIDT3)2, using a Pd(AcO)2 catalyzed direct C–H arylation method. The presence of a π(D–A–D) bridge induced π conjugation extension, across the molecule backbone structure, the octyldodecyl groups improved the solubility and the terminal thiophene units enhanced the absorption in the UV-vis region. The optical and electrochemical properties of BT(EDIDT3)2 were studied. The BT(EDIDT3)2:PC70BP (1:1) blend was prescreened as an active layer for organic solar cells and showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE)% = 2.25%, as an unexpected result compared with its counterparts with shorter conjugation lengths. The unexpected photovoltaic performance of BT(EDIDT3)2 highlights the importance of the careful selection of the inserted π-aromatic groups because their proper choice is essential to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency. Calculations by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were performed to confirm this deduction. We deduced that the central benzothiadiazole core in BT(EDIDT3)2 made big distortions that could inhibit the benefit behind the extension of conjugated molecular length.

As one of the important representatives of renewable energy sources, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have received considerable attention during the last few decades. This importance comes from their unique advantages, such as low cost, flexibility, light weight, and potential for large area device fabrication. The design, synthesis, and characterization of organic conjugated materials have been actively studied. Small molecules possess some distinct advantages over polymer donors. For example, polymers, as usual, have a wide distribution of molecular weights. In contrast, small molecules are well-defined structures, with definite molecular weight, which allows a better control over their properties during batch to batch reproduction. Small molecules do not have certain features of polymers, like chain kinks and chain-end defects, which increases the structural disorder. Moreover, fewer synthetic steps, simpler work-up and purification techniques for small molecules keep the estimated module OPV cell cost-competitive. Scientists attempt to obtain a perfect molecular chemical structure and tune the properties of the materials to achieve a high OPV performance. Tuning the optical, thermal and electronic properties as well as the solid-state ordering is important to improve the overall device performance. An effective and well-studied synthetic strategy to achieve materials with a high absorption coefficient and an optical band gap (Eg) of 1.2–1.6 eV is to combine electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units in an alternating order. Conjugated donor–acceptor (push–pull) chemical structures help to broaden the absorption window, increase the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and enhance the net short circuit current (Jsc) in device applications. There are many small-molecule donors based on a variety of moieties and structural frameworks that reach efficiencies over 8% and as high as 10% when blended with PCBM acceptor molecules. Small molecules based on A–D–A structural frameworks have attracted more and more attention due to their outstanding photovoltaic performance. Introducing a second electron donor into the (D–A–D) small molecule structure offered a variety of architectures such as (D1–D–A–D–D1) and (D–A–D–D1–D–A–D) building blocks. In 2011, a series of D1–A–D2–A–D1 frameworks was introduced by Bazan and co-workers and reached 7% efficiencies. By extending the framework to a more complex D1–A1–D2–A2–D3–A2–D2–A1–D1 structure, the high-performing molecule was later used by Gupta et al. to obtain over 9% PCE. Structural frameworks which are designed based on the D–A concept lead to a large number of high-performance building blocks with close to ideal material properties toward OPVs. In 2013, Jae-Suk Lee and co-workers introduced a series of D–A–D based small molecules that combined isoindigo (ID) as an acceptor with thiophenes units as donors. They confirmed that upon increasing the conjugated length of the donor units of small molecules, their optical, thermal and electronic properties as well as the solid-state ordering were improved. They deduced that ID3T, the small molecule with three thiophene units (Fig. 1) showed the highest photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 3.2%. In order to reap this advantage, we have taken care that the title compound, BT(EDIDT3)2, ends with three thiophene units at both terminals.

Recently, we introduced an efficient route to synthesize a series of small molecules based on the [A′(D′AD)2] or D1–A1–D2–A2–D2–A1–D1 architecture. Such small molecules bear two different acceptors and/or donors, which led to decrease the electron bandgap and improve the strength of the push–pull system as well as the amount of (ICT) from donor to acceptor units (Fig. 1). We used benzothiadiazole (BT) and ID as electron-deficient units alternated with thiophene and ethylenedioxythiophene (ED) as electron donors, see Fig. 1. The photovoltaic performance of EHID(EDBTT)2 based solar cell was reached to power conversion efficiency of 3.24%.
In the present work, we made a new design to combine the unique opto-electrical and thermal properties, as well as the solid-state ordering like that of ID3T, and also improve the ICT-like EHID(EDBTT)2. A new (D1)3–A1–D2–A2–D2–A1–(D1)3 framework structure was developed, where D1 and D2 are electron-rich fragments covalently linked to electron-poor fragments, A1 and A2 (Fig. 1). The targeted materials was obtained in reasonable yield and minimal synthetic steps, and was soluble in most organic solvents. The new structure based on the π ED-BT-ED conjugated bridge linked two arms of ID-thiophenes. The BT(EDIDT3)2 medium-sized molecule was expected to combine some of the most desirable properties, such as well-defined crystallinity, thermal stability, and film quality. The material chemical structure was confirmed and the optical, electrochemical properties as well as device performance were investigated.
Quantum chemical calculations are used here to explain the different photovoltaic performances of the tested compounds based on their geometrical and electronic structures.


1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Varian spectrometer (400 MHz). UV/Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary UV/Vis/NIR-5000 spectrophotometer on the pure polymer samples. The thermal degradation temperature was measured by a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-TA Q-50 instrument) under nitrogen. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a TA instrument (DSC-TA Q-20) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a B-class solar simulator, potentiostat/galvanostat (SP-150 OMA company); the supporting electrolyte was tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile (0.1 M), and the scan rate was 50 m V s−1. A three-electrode cell was used; a Pt wire and silver/silver chloride [Ag in KCl (0.1 M)] were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. XRD experiments were performed using a Bruker D8 advanced model diffractometer and with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) at a generator voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA.


The catalysts, reagents, and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and 2,2′:5′,2′′-Terthiophene-5-boronic acid pinacol ester (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) were used as received. 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo, 4,7-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno [3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (ED-BT-ED), were synthesized by literature procedures.


6,6′-Dibromo-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo (1) (100 mg, 0.102 mmol) and 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5-boronic acid pinacol ester (2) (60 mg, 1.5 eq.), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mg) were placed in a dried two neck flask (50 mL), and then the flask was evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen three times. Next, 15 mL of degassed toluene was poured into the flask and degassed with nitrogen for 20 min, followed by the addition of an aqueous solution of K2CO3 (2 M, 10 mL). The mixture solution was heated to 85 °C under nitrogen and stirred for 12 h (TLC). The reaction mixture was allowed to return to room temperature followed by extraction with CH2Cl2. The organic layers were collected, washed with water, and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the crude product thus obtained was purified by flash silica gel column chromatography (n-hexane/CH2Cl2, 2:1) to obtain compound (3) as a dark blue solid product (76 mg, 65%), 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ = 9.14 (d, J = 8.44 Hz, 1H), 9.04 (d, J = 8.62 Hz, 1H), 7.30 (d, J = 3.76 Hz, 1H), 7.29 (t, 3H), 7.12 (m, 4H), 7.02 (t, 1H), 6.86 (d, J = 7.89 Hz, 2H), 3.66 (m, 4H), 1.84 (m, 2H), 1.33 (m, 64H), 0.85 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): δ = 168.5, 168.2, 145.9, 142.6, 138.0, 137.6, 137.0, 136.9, 135.7, 133.0, 131.1, 127.9, 125.2, 124.9, 124.7, 124.4, 123.9, 120.9,120.7, 118.9, 111.4, 104.6, 68.0, 44.7, 36.4, 36.0, 31.9, 31.8, 31.6, 30.0, 29.7, 29.4, 26.7, 26.4, 22.7, 14.1, 1.0.

Potassium acetate (0.059 g, 0.600 mmol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB; 0.064 g, 0.200 mmol), 6-bromo-1-(2-octyldodecyl)-3-(1-(2-octyldodecyl)-2-oxo-6-(5-(5-(thiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)indolin-3-ylidene)indolin-2-one (3) (229 mg, 0.200 mmol), and palladium acetate (4 mg, 0.020 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of 4,7-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (4) (42 mg, 0.100 mmol) in degassed anhydrous DMF (20 mL). The resulting suspension was refluxed under nitrogen for 24 h at a temperature of 80 °C (TLC). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and a mixture of CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and water (25 mL) was added. The organic layer was separated and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude solution was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (n-hexane/MC, 1:1) to generate the product BT(EDIDT3)2 (5) as a dark blue solid (140 mg, 55% yield), 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ = 9.10 (m, 4H), 8.02 (d, J = 3.85 Hz, 2H), 7.83 (d, J = 7.71 Hz, 2H), 7.69 (m, 4H), 7.25 (m, 2H), 7.19 (m, 8H), 7.10 (d, J = 3.85 Hz, 4H), 7.03 (t, 2H), 4.48 (t, 8H), 3.62 (m, 8H), 1.83 (m, 4H), 1.24 (m, 128H), 0.88 (m, 24H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): δ = 166.3, 166.1, 149.1, 148.8, 145.1, 141.9, 141.3, 138.0, 133.2, 131.9, 131.7, 130.0, 129.4, 129.3, 128.6, 124.4, 122.3, 121.73, 121.1, 114.5, 111.1, 73.4, 41.3, 36.0, 31.9, 31.5, 30.2, 29.6, 29.5, 29.3, 29.0, 25.7, 25.2, 22.6, 20.6, 20.4, 18.7, 14.0, 11.4, 0.9.

The bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/organic material:PC70BM/Ca/Al. The ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication using a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Surface treatment was performed by exposing ITO to an UV/ozone treatment. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI4083) solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 20 s on an ITO substrate, serving as an anode. The coated substrate was dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air and was transferred into a glove box filled with N2. The small molecule:PC70BM (1:1, w/w), dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1, was spin-cast on the PEDOT:PSS layer and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The cathode, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm), was deposited in a vacuum chamber (10−6 Torr). The active area was 4.64 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under an air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination with light-source operation at 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a QE-IPCE 3000 spectral response/QE/IPCE measurement system (Titan Electro-Optics Co. Ltd).

The bottom-gate/bottom-contact (BGBC) OFET devices were fabricated using n++-Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrates. The Au electrodes (50 nm) for the source and drain were thermally evaporated with a length of 50 mm and a width of 1000 mm on the SiO2 surface under high vacuum (∼10−6 Torr). The substrates were subjected to cleaning by ultrasonication in acetone, and isopropanol each for 20 min. The cleaned substrates were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h. The substrates were UV/ozone treated for 20 min and then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The thin films of small molecules were spin-cast on the substrates with the small molecule solutions (10 mg mL−1 in CB) at 2000 rpm for 40 s and heat-treated on the hot plate.


Scheme 1 shows the synthetic procedure of BT(EDIDT3)2, started from the coupling reaction between 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo (1) with a little more ratio of 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5-boronic acid pinacol ester (2) under the conditions of a Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed Suzuki coupling to obtained the mono-substituted (E)-6-bromo-1-(2-octyldodecyl)-3-(1-(2-octyldodecyl)-2-oxo-6-(5-(5-(thiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl) thiophen-2-yl)indolin-3-ylidene)indolin-2-one (3) derivative. Using the direct C–H arylation methodology, with Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst, and tetrabutylammonium bromide (Bu)4NBr and KOAc as a base, 2.4 eq. of compound 3 reacted with 4,7-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (4) to give the desired BT(EDIDT3)2 (5). The BT(EDIDT3)2 structure was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.


The thermal stability of the BT(EDIDT3)2 molecule was observed by TGA at a heating rate of 100 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S5a, ESI). If the threshold for thermal decomposition is defined as a mass loss of 5%, the material possesses good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures above 350 °C. The DSC curve exhibited clear melting peaks and phase transitions of crystallization of the BT(EDIDT3)2., The melting (Tm) and crystallization (Tc) temperatures were found to be at 188 °C and 145 °C, respectively, Fig. S5b (ESI). This reflects the rigidity of the BT(EDIDT3)2 molecule.


The structural ordering of the BT(EDIDT3)2 molecule in the solid-state was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 2a). The films were prepared by drop-casting of the CHCl3 solution onto a silicon wafer substrate. The BT(EDIDT3)2 exhibited crystallinity peaks, a strong reflection peak (100) at 2θ = 4.3°, which corresponds to a d-spacing of 20.5 Å. This value is the distances between the planes of the main conjugated backbone separated by the octyl-dodecyl-side chain (Fig. 2b).

The second peak assigned at 2θ = 21.2°, with a d-spacing of 4.1 Å, demonstrates the π–π stacking between the molecular backbones (Fig. 2b) and implies long-range ordering as well as a highly organized assembled structure in the solid-state.

As previously reported, the use of conjugated molecules bearing strong electron donor and strong electron acceptor units decreases the electron band gap and improves the strength of the push–pull system as well as the performance of organic solar cells by controlling the photo-induced ICT from the donor to acceptor units.


Fig. 3a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the BT(EDIDT3)2 in a CHCl3 solution and in the film state. The high energy absorption bands in the range of 350–400 nm may be attributed to the localized π–π* transition. The lower energy bands in the 600–750 nm range were assigned to ICT between the donor and acceptor groups. BT(EDIDT3)2 exhibited a broad absorption with the onset absorption (λonset) at 832 nm. The optical band gap of BT(EDIDT3)2 in the film state estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra was 1.49 eV, see Table 1.

Using a platinum electrode in a 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was obtained for the BT(EDIDT3)2 material (Fig. 3b). According to the equations, HOMO = −(Eox + 4.71) eV and LUMO = −(Ered + 4.71) eV; the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were derived from the onset of oxidation (Eox) and reduction potentials (Ered) of the CV curve of the drop-cast film. The materials possessed a low-lying LUMO at −3.96 eV because of the electron deficiency of the ID units. The estimated electronic Eg = 1.68 eV is quite higher than the optical Eg estimated in thin-film, see Table 1.

The photovoltaic performance of the title compound was estimated by the fabrication of a conventional devices structure, and consists of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/organic material:PC70BM/Ca/Al. The BT(EDIDT3)2/PC70BM blend dissolved in chlorobenzene was spin-coated before thermal metal deposition. The devices were characterized under an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The evaluated device parameters are summarized in Table 2. Photovoltaic devices were optimized in a different weight ratio between BT(EDIDT3)2 and PC70BM, as well as by varying additive contents. The photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI). As observed in Fig. S6a (ESI), the photovoltaic device performance was significantly affected by the (D–A) ratio. The best (D–A) ratio was (1:1) and a 0.15% additive showed the best performance.

The BT(EDIDT3)2/PC70BM organic photovoltaic device showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.28%, with a short circuit current (Jsc) of 4.85 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58 V and a fill factor (FF) of 46%, see Table 2.
The BT(EDIDT3)2:PC70BM (1:1) organic photovoltaic device showed the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.28%, with a Jsc of 4.85 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58 V and a fill factor (FF) of 46%, see Table 2. Unexpectedly, the new designed molecule BT(EDIDT3)2 possessed a Voc value of 0.58 V, which is lower than the Voc values of EHID(EDBTT)2 and ID3T. This reflects that the ED and thiophenes controlled the electric properties of the new material because of the loss of Voc related to the relatively high electron density of the donor materials of the OPV devices. The BT(EDIDT3)2 device performance is dramatically improved with 0.15% of the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive and showed a 2.25% PCE with an improvement in Jsc (7.06 mA cm−2), and FF (53%). However, the overall performance was still unexpectedly lower compared with those of EHID(EDBTT)2 and ID3T.

Fig. 4c shows an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the small molecule:PC70BM blend film to study the effect of the active layer morphology on the device performance. In spite of the BT(EDIDT3)2:PC70BM active layer showing a high root mean square (RMS) roughness, (RMS = 11.5 nm), the FF of the solar cell was not intensely low.
Therefore, the origin of the leakage current inside the device is expected because of the low charge mobility across the small molecule backbone structure and the low charge transfer ratio between BT(EDIDT3)2 as a donor and PC70BM acceptor. The addition of 0.15% DIO showed a smooth morphology with RMS = 9.8 nm, reflecting the improvement in the FF value to 53%.
To investigate the electron-donating effect across the donor unit BT(EDIDT3)2 on photovoltaic performance, the charge carrier mobility of the BT(EDIDT3)2 molecule was measured.
The charge carrier mobility was determined using bottom-gate and top-contact (BGTC) OFETs. 10 mg mL−1 of the new donor material was dissolved in chloroform and spin-cast over an n++-Si/SiO2 (200 nm) substrate at 6000 rpm for 40 s. The field-effect mobilities were extracted from the saturation region in the transfer curves using the following equation: IDS = (W/2L)Cμ(VGS − VT)2, where W, L, C, μ, IDS, VGS, and VT are the channel width, channel length, gate dielectric capacitance per unit area, charge carrier mobility, drain–source current, gate–source voltage, and the threshold voltage, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 5b, the cast film of the BT(EDIDT3)2 molecule shows a low hole mobility at 8.32 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole mobility slightly improved with thermal annealing at 60 and 100 °C to 1.17 × 10−6 and 1.05 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, as a result to the amendment of molecular stacking. These results confirm the weakness of charge mobility across the small molecule backbone structure that affected the short circuit current and the overall efficiency of the OPVs.

To theoretically explore the geometric and electronic structures of BT(EDIDT3)2, compared with those of reported molecules, EHID(EDBTT)2 and ID3T, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using Gaussian 09 package were employed. Firstly, the geometry of the three molecules was optimized in their ground state without any restriction at the WB97XD/6-31G(d) level. Thereafter, the structures were further analyzed by harmonic vibrational frequency to ensure that a real global minimum was found without imaginary vibrational frequencies. Based on the optimized geometries, WB97XD/6-31G(d,p) and TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) were used to simulate the absorption spectra in chloroform, see Fig. S7 (ESI). The polarizable continuum model (PCM) using the integral equation formalism variant (IEFPCM) was employed to simulate the solvent effect. Also, B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) was employed to estimate the frontier orbitals and their energy gap in the title molecules.

A big question arises herein, what is the reason behind the lowest organic photovoltaic performance of BT(EDIDT3)2 even though it possesses the most extended π-conjugated backbone? The computed π-conjugation lengths of BT(EDIDT3)2, EHID(EDBTT)2 and ID-T3 are 52.64, 31.89, and 32.65 Å, respectively. A first glance at Fig. 6 reveals that the geometry of BT(EDIDT3)2 has a tor-like structure, while those of EHID(EDBTT)2, and ID3T tend to be less stooped. Thus, the high non-coplanarity of the BT(EDIDT3)2 backbone has a negative influence on the π–π stacking interactions occurring among the molecule backbones in the solid-state, which in turn may reduce the charge mobility, consistent with its relative lower photovoltaic performance. Moreover, the presence of the BT core in the center of BT(EDIDT3)2 and in-between two ED moieties with torsion angles of 46.32° and 45.68° means it loses its π-conjugation extension feature. The successive twisting at the center of BT(EDIDT3)2 (i.e., before and after the BT moiety) could hamper the ICT along the molecular skeleton. The successive twisting is not present in the case of the other two molecules. For example, the benzothiadiazole core of EHID(EDBTT)2 twists from ethylene dioxythiophene and thiophene moieties by ca. 46° and 17°, respectively, at both terminals.
The calculated energies of HOMO, LUMO and the band gaps of the tested molecules using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) are listed in Table 1. Their values are overestimated concerning the corresponding experimental ones. Also, the computed Eg disagrees with the size of the conjugated system as a result of torsion where the order of the computed Eg value is BT(EDIDT3)2 < EHID(EDBTT)2 > IDT3. This order disagrees with that come from the cyclic voltammetry experiment. The discrepancy between both orders may be attributed to the crystal packing in the solid-state. The crystal packing plays a vital role in the optical properties as a result of stronger intermolecular chemical interactions. However, in our computations, molecule crystal packing was not considered.
We used TD-DFT here to explain the unexpected lowest efficiency of the most extended conjugated molecule, BT(EDIDT3)2, relative to those of the other two molecular systems. In the first step, we think that we have to check the validity of our model by reproducing the UV-Vis spectra via TD-DFT. Two methods were used for this respect; CAM-B3LYP/6-31(d,p) and wB97XD/6-31(d,p). Only CAM-B3LYP/6-31(d,p) could successively reproduce the absorption spectra for all compounds in both the spectral profile and the wavelength of maximum absorbance, λmax, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). For example, the computed λmax of BT(EDIDT3)2, EHID(EDBTT)2, and IDT3 are 679, 571 and 407 nm which are in excellent agreement with the experimental ones of 662, 586 and 401 nm, respectively. The marked redshift in Fig. S7 (ESI) reflects the logical expectation as a result of the extension of the π-conjugation length. For all the tested systems, the main optical peak is attributed primarily to a HOMO → LUMO transition in which the percentage contribution (C%), reaches 72%, see Table S2 (ESI). The optical absorption at λmax leads to a delocalized π → π* transition with a high oscillator strength (1.66 to 2.60), as shown in Table S2 (ESI).
Inspection of Fig. 7, shows that the HOMO electron density of IDT3 and BT(EDIDT3)2 is fully delocalized over the whole molecular skeleton. However, the LUMO electron density distributes differently in both molecules. Evidently, the LUMO electron density of IDT3 is strictly centered on the ID core, while that of BT(EDIDT3)2 is selectively located only on the ID and BT moieties with selective absence on the two ED moieties. This is attributed to the successive twisting at the center of the molecular skeleton of BT(EDIDT3)2 as mentioned above. The break in the conjugation of the LUMO electron density of BT(EDIDT3)2 may lead to a slow intermolecular charge transport process that could explain its relatively low photovoltaic performance. The situation is different in the case of EHID(EDBTT)2, in which both the HOMO and LUMO electron densities distribute over the whole skeleton with little concentration at the right terminal.
Furthermore, we have computed the radiative lifetimes (τ, a.u.) for spontaneous emission, using the Einstein transition probabilities using the following formula:
where
C is the velocity of light, Eflu is the excitation energy, and f is the oscillator strength. As a rule, the long radiative lifetime of an excited molecule will retard the charge combination process that enhances its photovoltaic performance. The radiative lifetimes of BT(EDIDT3)2, EHID(EDBTT)2, and IDT3 are 7.23, 9.56 and 9.15 ns, respectively. Clearly, the relatively longer τ of EHID(EDBTT)2 and IDT3 compared to that of BT(EDIDT3)2 facilitates the electron transfer of the photoexcited electron, from the LUMO of the electron-donor to the LUMO of the electron-acceptor, leading to a higher light-emitting efficiency compared to the former.


With the aid of a Pd(AcO)2 catalyzed direct C–H arylation method, a new medium-sized molecule BT(EDIDT3)2 was synthesized. BT(EDIDT3)2 is thermally stable and soluble in most organic solvents. The new molecule is highly thermally stable, and shows a broad absorption with a narrow bandgap Eg = 1.49 eV, and HOMO and LUMO levels at −5.64 eV and −3.96 eV, respectively. Although BT(EDIDT3)2 possessed a narrow bandgap with low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels, the BT(EDIDT3)2/PC70BM organic photovoltaic device showed a PCE of 2.25% owing to a lower Voc value compared with the Voc of its counterpart small molecules with shorter conjugation lengths. From the DFT calculations, the presence of a (D–A–D) bridge induced π conjugation extension, but the geometric distortion inhibited the impact of the extension of the conjugated molecular system and decreased the photovoltaic performance of the OPV cell. The study opens the gate for new designs of medium-sized molecules considering the geometric distortion of the π (D–A–D) bridge units.
