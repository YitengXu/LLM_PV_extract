Photoelectrochemical water splitting using organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) is an attractive and sustainable method for converting solar energy to hydrogen (H2). However, the poor stability of OHPs in aqueous electrolytes and the use of Pt, a noble metal, as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst restrict the practical application of OHP-based photocathodes. Herein, we report an efficient and stable OHP-based photocathode using Ti foil as the protective encapsulation layer and earth-abundant and cost-effective MoS2 as the HER catalyst. The fabricated MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode presents a remarkable half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 11.07%, a photocurrent density of −20.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), and an onset potential of 1.02 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode exhibits a record long-term PEC stability in aqueous electrolytes over 120 h of illumination. Our study provides insights into designing the structure of OHP-based photocathodes for efficient and stable solar H2 production.

The energy crisis and global warming caused by the over-dependence on fossil fuels require renewable alternative energy sources. For decades, the development of photovoltaic (PV) technologies has demonstrated the feasibility of solar energy as a suitable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of solar energy requires advanced technologies for efficient power conversion and storage as other stable forms of energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive and sustainable method for converting solar energy into hydrogen (H2), which is a clean and storable energy source.

Recently, organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) have emerged as a promising candidate for an excellent light absorption layer of PEC water splitting devices owing to their high absorption coefficient, low trap density, and long carrier diffusion length. In addition, the cost-effective and low-temperature fabrication of the OHP layer using a solution process enables the future practical PEC water splitting utilizing OHP-based photoelectrodes. However, the poor stability of OHPs in water molecules restricts their practical application in PEC water splitting. Therefore, various encapsulation layers, such as Ni, carbon nanotube/polymer composites, Field's metal, conductive carbon paste, graphite sheets, metal oxides, Ti foil, and graphite epoxy, have been employed in OHP-based photoelectrodes to prevent water molecules from penetrating the OHP layer. In addition, according to our previous study, the use of the optimal contact material is crucial for the efficient transfer of photogenerated carriers from the OHP to the encapsulation layer, thereby improving the photocurrent density and PEC stability of the OHP photocathode.
Moreover, the use of noble metals, such as Pt, which is one of the most efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts, is another critical shortcoming for the practical application of OHP-based photocathodes because of their high cost and scarcity. In addition, the degradation of PEC stability of photocathodes using Pt catalysts has often been reported. Therefore, the development of an earth-abundant, cost-effective, and stable HER catalyst is critical for overcoming the drawbacks related to the high cost and low PEC stability of OHP-based photocathodes. Recently, Edwardes Moore et al. developed OHP-based photocathodes using a hydrogenase catalyst for PEC water splitting; however, the photocurrent density, onset potential, and PEC stability of the fabricated photocathodes were inferior to those of OHP-based photocathodes developed using Pt catalysts.
Herein, we developed an efficient and stable OHP-based photocathode protected with a MoS2 HER catalyst integrated Ti foil encapsulation layer. As a representative two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide, MoS2 has been regarded as an earth-abundant and cost-effective HER catalyst. Hence, MoS2 has been studied as a promising cocatalyst of photocathodes for cost-effective and efficient PEC water splitting. In this study, a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method was used to grow layer-controllable and uniform MoS2 thin films directly on Ti foil in the absence of a transfer process. To maximize the HER catalytic activity of MoS2, we controlled the density of its exposed edge sites on the surface. Consequently, our OHP-based photocathode encapsulated with the MoS2/Ti foil exhibited a remarkable half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH) of 11.07% with a high photocurrent density of −20.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a positive onset potential of 1.02 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode retained more than 50% of its initial photocurrent for 120 h, which, to the best of our knowledge, is a record long-term PEC stability. Therefore, this study enables the realization of efficient and stable solar H2 production via PEC water splitting using a noble metal-free and cost-effective OHP-based photocathode.

OHP precursor solutions and inverted-type OHP PV cells were prepared and fabricated, respectively, according to the methods described in our previous report. In brief, a 1.5 M OHP precursor solution was prepared by dissolving lead(II) iodide (PbI2) (99.99%, Tokyo Chemical Industry) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) (99.99%, Great Cell Solar) in a mixed N,N-dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (8:1 v/v) solvent. To prepare the OHP precursor solution with an L-proline additive, L-proline (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in the OHP precursor solution. The prepared OHP precursor solution containing the L-proline additive was stirred at 60 °C overnight. To fabricate inverted-type OHP PV cells, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized (DI) water. First, a 0.25 wt% poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-amine] (PTAA) (EM Index) solution in toluene was spin-coated on a patterned ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s under ambient air conditions. Next, the ITO substrate was transferred to a glove box, and a 0.05 wt% poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br) (1-Material) solution in methanol was spin-coated on it at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Thereafter, the prepared OHP precursor solution with the L-proline additive was spin-coated on the coated substrate using a one-step process at 5000 rpm for 30 s. During spin-coating, 0.7 mL of diethyl ether, which was used as an anti-solvent, was dripped onto the substrate after 7 s of spinning, and then the coated substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, a 2 wt% [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (99.5%, Nano-C) solution in chlorobenzene was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and a 0.5 mg mL−1 bathocuproine (BCP) (96%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution in methanol was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 20 s. Lastly, a Cu top electrode was deposited on the OHP PV cells via thermal evaporation.


MoS2 thin films were grown on Ti foil (thickness 0.25 mm, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) via PLD (KrF, λ = 248 nm). Prior to deposition, the Ti foil was cleaned via sequential ultrasonication using acetone, isopropanol, and DI water for 10 min each. Next, the Ti foil was immersed in a 5% hydrofluoric acid solution for 5 s to remove the surface oxide layer. A commercial MoS2 target (LTS Research Laboratory, Inc.) was used to fabricate the MoS2/Ti foil encapsulation layers. MoS2 thin films were grown on the cleaned Ti foil at 500 °C under an Ar partial pressure of 100 mTorr according to the method described in our previous report. The laser fluence and repetition rate were set at 1 J cm−2 and 3 Hz, respectively. The thickness of the MoS2 thin films was controlled by adjusting the number of laser pulses (p). For comparison, MoS2 thin films were grown on Ti foil with various numbers of p (1000, 3000, and 6000 p).


To fabricate the OHP-based photocathodes, the prepared OHP PV cells and MoS2/Ti foil were attached using the In–Ga eutectic alloy (EGaIn) (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) as the contact material between the MoS2/Ti foil and OHP PV cells, as previously reported. EGaIn was applied to the Cu electrodes of the OHP PV cells, and the MoS2/Ti foil was attached to the EGaIn-covered area of the Cu electrodes. Thereafter, Ag paste was painted on the ITO electrodes to facilitate the electrical contact between the Cu wire and ITO electrode. After the Ag paste was dried, the fabricated photocathodes were sealed with epoxy resin (Loctite EA 9460, Henkel) to prevent water molecules from penetrating the OHP photocathode.


Electrochemical and PEC performance measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (Ivium-n-Stat, Ivium Technologies). All the measured potentials versus the saturated calomel electrode (vs. SCE) were converted to potentials vs. RHE using the Nernst equation:


ERHE = ESCE + 0.059 × pH + 0.241

(1)
where
ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE and ESCE is the experimentally measured potential vs. SCE.

The HER catalytic activity of the encapsulation layers was measured in an Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. A standard three-electrode configuration was used with MoS2/Ti foil or bare Ti foil, the SCE, and a graphite rod as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. To measure the electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared electrodes, a Cu wire was attached to the backside of the Ti foil using Ag paste. Subsequently, the Cu wire attached to the Ti foil was sealed with epoxy resin by following a procedure similar to that used during the fabrication of the OHP-based photocathodes. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves of the MoS2/Ti foil and bare Ti foil were measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 without iR compensation. The corresponding Tafel slopes were calculated using the Tafel equation:

η = b × log(J) + a

(2)
where
η, b, J are the overpotential, Tafel slope, and current density, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the MoS2/Ti foil and bare Ti foil was performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV at −0.25 V vs. RHE.

The PEC performance of OHP-based photocathodes was measured in an Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. A standard three-electrode configuration was used with a MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode or the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode, the SCE, and a graphite rod as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. For PEC measurements, the prepared OHP-based photocathodes were illuminated from the backside under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a 150 W Xe lamp (Model 10500, ABET Technology). The LSV curves of the OHP-based photocathodes were measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The corresponding EIS was performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV at 0.7 V vs. RHE under illumination.
For incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements, a monochromator (Mmac 200, Dongwoo Optron) was used. The IPCE of the OHP photocathodes was measured at 0.4 V vs. RHE under monochromatic light at wavelengths ranging from 350 to 800 nm. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was calculated as follows:
(3)
where
Jph, λ, and P are the photocurrent density, wavelength and intensity of the incident light, respectively.

For open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements, we measured the potential (vs. SCE) when a 0 mA current was passed through the potentiostat in the dark and under illumination (AM 1.5G). Subsequently, the measured voltage was converted to potential (vs. RHE).
The faradaic efficiency (ηF) was determined by measuring the amount of H2 gas generated at the OHP photocathode using gas chromatography (Agilent 7820A, 5 Å molecular sieve column).
The HC-STH of the photocathodes was calculated as follows:
(4)
where
VRHE and P are the applied bias and incident light intensity, respectively.

The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated as follows:

The structural characteristics of the MoS2 thin films grown on Ti foil via PLD were analyzed by using Raman spectroscopy (InVia, Renishaw) at a laser wavelength of 514.5 nm. The morphological characteristics of the MoS2/Ti foil were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi S-4700, Hitachi) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, Philips). The elemental composition of the MoS2/Ti foil was analyzed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping in cross-sectional scanning TEM (STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (NEXSA, Thermo Fisher Scientific).


The schematic representation of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode structure in this study is presented in Fig. 1. We prepared OHP photocathodes using inverted-type OHP PV cells based on methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) with L-proline as reported in our previous work, and their performance is described in detail in Fig. S1. In brief, the OHP PV cells used to fabricate the OHP photocathodes exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.7%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 22.0 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.80. The inverted-type OHP PV cells were combined with MoS2/Ti foil using moldable and conductive EGaIn as the contact material, which facilitated the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from the OHP layer to the MoS2/Ti foil.


Owing to the poor HER catalytic activity of bare Ti foil, we integrated it with earth-abundant and cost-effective MoS2 as a HER catalyst to enhance the PEC performance of the OHP-based photocathodes in aqueous electrolytes. To promote the HER catalytic activity of MoS2, we tailored its morphology on the Ti foil because, according to a previous study, the HER catalytic activity of its edge sites was superior to that of its basal plane. In addition, vertically aligned MoS2 nanostructures were formed on the basal plane of MoS2 thin films by increasing the number of MoS2 layers. We fabricated MoS2 nanostructures on Ti foil by controlling p during PLD, which determined the number of layers of MoS2. The increase in the thickness of the PLD-grown MoS2 thin films was proportional to the increase in p. The color of the PLD-grown MoS2/Ti foil was relatively dark compared with that of the bare Ti foil, indicating that the MoS2 was successfully grown on the Ti foil (Fig. S2). The Raman spectra of a PLD-grown MoS2 thin film were used to evaluate its structural characteristics (Fig. 2a). The distinct peaks at 382 and 405 cm−1 correspond to the E12g (in-plane vibrational mode) and A1g modes (out-of-plane vibrational mode), respectively, of MoS2. These peaks confirmed that MoS2 thin films were grown on the Ti foil. XPS spectra were used to confirm the presence of Mo and S in the MoS2 thin film grown on the Ti foil (Fig. S3a). The high-resolution Mo 3d and S 2p XPS spectra of the PLD-grown MoS2/Ti foil are presented in Fig. S3b and c, respectively. The peaks at 232.4 and 229.2 eV in the Mo 3d region (Fig. S3b) were attributed to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2, respectively, and the peaks at 163.8 and 162.9 eV in the S 2p region (Fig. S3c) were attributed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively. These results confirmed that MoS2 thin films were successfully grown on the Ti foil via PLD.

The effect of p on the surface morphology of the PLD-grown MoS2 thin films was evaluated using FESEM analysis. The morphology of the PLD-grown MoS2 thin films was significantly affected by p (Fig. 2b–d). 1000 p MoS2 exhibited a flat and dense surface morphology (Fig. 2b), which was slightly different from that of the bare Ti foil (Fig. S4). Conversely, vertically aligned nanostructures were observed on the surfaces of both 3000 and 6000 p MoS2 thin films (Fig. 2c and d, respectively). In addition, the density of the nanostructures increased as p increased from 3000 to 6000. To analyze the morphological characteristics and chemical composition of the MoS2 thin films in detail, we performed cross-sectional TEM analysis. The cross-sectional TEM image of 3000 p MoS2 grown on Ti foil is shown in Fig. 2e. The total thickness of 3000 p MoS2 is approximately 25 nm, consisting of 10 nm of the basal plane of MoS2 grown along the rough surface of the Ti foil, and 15 nm of the vertically aligned MoS2 nanostructures. The edge sites of MoS2, which were sporadically exposed on the basal plane of MoS2, were expected to improve the HER catalytic activity of MoS2. The formation of edge-exposed MoS2 nanostructures on the basal plane of MoS2 was ascribed to the curling force, which was caused by the increase in the number of defects and/or strain energy. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image of the 3000 p MoS2 thin film grown on Ti foil and its corresponding EDS maps, which provided information on the distribution of each element throughout the film, are presented in Fig. 2f–i. Mo and S were homogeneously distributed throughout the MoS2 film and can be distinguished from Ti, as presented in Fig. 2g–i.

Before combining the MoS2/Ti foil with the OHP light absorption layer, the HER catalytic activity of MoS2 thin films grown using 1000, 3000, and 6000 p was evaluated and compared with that of the bare Ti foil in an Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a three-electrode configuration. The LSV polarization curves of the bare Ti foil and MoS2/Ti foil are shown in Fig. 3a. The MoS2/Ti foil exhibited a remarkable HER catalytic activity with low overpotentials in the range of 370–410 mV required to achieve a current density of −10 mA cm−2, whereas the bare Ti foil exhibited an inert HER catalytic activity. The corresponding Tafel plots of the bare Ti foil and MoS2/Ti foil are shown in Fig. 3b. The Tafel slopes of the MoS2/Ti foil were smaller (109−125 mV dec−1) than that of bare Ti foil (182 mV dec−1), indicating that MoS2 promoted the HER catalytic activity and accelerated the HER. The Tafel slope of 109 mV dec−1 of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil was comparable to those of previously reported MoS2 HER catalysts.

The overpotential of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil at a current density of −10 mA cm−2 and its Tafel slope were lower and smaller, respectively, than those of the other MoS2/Ti foils (Fig. 3a and b). The higher HER catalytic activity of 3000 p MoS2 than that of 1000 p MoS2 is attributed to the edge-exposed MoS2 nanostructures. Although the density of edge-exposed MoS2 nanostructures of the 6000 p MoS2 thin film was higher than that of the 3000 p MoS2 thin film, as shown in the FESEM images (Fig. 2c and d), the HER catalytic activity of the 6000 p MoS2 thin film was inferior to that of the 3000 p MoS2 thin film. We believe that this was caused by the increase in the thickness of the MoS2 thin film with p limiting charge transfer through it, resulting in a poor HER catalytic performance. To confirm the relationship between the charge transfer kinetics and thickness of the MoS2 thin films, we performed EIS measurements, and fitted the Nyquist plots of the MoS2 thin films using an equivalent circuit. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil (35 Ω cm2) was smaller than those of the 1000 p MoS2/Ti foil (75 Ω cm2) and 6000 p MoS2/Ti foil (328 Ω cm2) (Fig. 3c). This indicated that the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil exhibited optimal HER catalytic activity. Additionally, the Rct of the MoS2/Ti foil (35–328 Ω cm2) was much smaller than that of the bare Ti foil (2594 Ω cm2), indicating that the charge transfer of the MoS2/Ti foil was much faster than that of the bare Ti foil at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The HER catalytic activity parameters of bare Ti and various MoS2/Ti foils are summarized in Table 1. To estimate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl), which is proportional to the ECSA, was determined. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates were measured to determine the Cdl of the bare Ti and MoS2/Ti foil (Fig. S5a–c). The Cdl estimated from half of the slope of the capacitive current density at 0.2 V vs. RHE as a function of scan rate of the 1000, 3000, and 6000 p MoS2/Ti foil was calculated to be 0.05, 0.09, and 0.12 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. S5d). These results indicated that the higher HER catalytic activity of the edge-exposed 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil was attributed to its ECSA being higher than that of the 1000 p MoS2/Ti foil. Although the edge sites of MoS2 were observed in both the 3000 and 6000 p MoS2/Ti foil, the density of edge sites of the 6000 p MoS2/Ti foil was higher than that of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil (Fig. 2c and d). Therefore, the ECSA of the 6000 p MoS2/Ti foil was higher than that of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil. However, the HER catalytic activity of the 6000 p MoS2/Ti foil was lower than that of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil in spite of its higher ECSA. This was attributed to the increase in the thickness leading to an increase in Rct, as indicated by the EIS results (Fig. 3c). We further evaluated the electrochemical stability of the 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil using chronopotentiometric measurements. The 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil exhibited an excellent electrochemical stability at current densities of −10 and −20 mA cm−2 for 40 h (Fig. 3d). These results indicated that the edge-exposed MoS2 is a suitable HER catalyst that can be integrated with the Ti foil encapsulation layer for the fabrication of efficient and stable OHP photocathodes.

After combining the optimized 3000 p MoS2/Ti foil encapsulation layer with an OHP light absorption layer to fabricate a MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode, we evaluated the PEC performance of the photocathode in an Ar-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte using a three-electrode configuration under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. S6. The representative LSV curves of the OHP photocathodes with and without the MoS2 HER catalyst grown on the Ti foil encapsulation layer are shown in Fig. 4a. The MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode exhibited a photocurrent density of −20.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which was higher than that of the Ti foil/OHP photocathode (−18.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE). The photocurrent density of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was approximately the same as the JSC of the OHP PV cells used to fabricate OHP photocathodes and comparable to that of OHP photocathodes using Pt catalysts. In addition, the onset potential of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode (1.02 V vs. RHE) was more positive than that of the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode (0.77 V vs. RHE). Moreover, the photocurrent density of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode became saturated at a potential of ∼0.5 V vs. RHE, which was more positive than that of the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode (0.1 V vs. RHE). Additionally, we recorded the LSV curves of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode over 100 cycles and used them to evaluate the repeatability of the photocathode. The MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode exhibited excellent repeatability with almost unchanged photocurrent density and onset potential after 100 cycles (Fig. S7). Moreover, the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode exhibited less degradation of PEC performance after 100 cycles than a previously reported Pt/Ti foil/OHP photocathode. To evaluate the reproducibility of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode, we measured the LSV curves of 10 photocathodes. All the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathodes exhibited excellent PEC performance with a high average photocurrent density of −21.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. S8). These results indicated the excellent reproducibility of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathodes. The IPCE of the OHP photocathodes measured at 0.4 V vs. RHE is presented in Fig. S9. The IPCE of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was much larger than that of the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode over the entire wavelength range, which was consistent with the LSV results in Fig. 4a. Therefore, we conclude that the remarkable PEC performance of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was attributed to the improvement in the charge transfer kinetics at the photocathode/electrolyte interface owing to the excellent HER catalytic activity of the MoS2 catalyst grown on the Ti foil. The band alignment of the OHP photocathodes with and without the MoS2 catalyst is presented in Fig. S10. The photogenerated electrons from the OHP layer under illumination readily transferred to the Ti foil encapsulation layer regardless of the presence of the MoS2 catalyst. After that, the Rct at the photocathode/electrolyte interface was decreased owing to the fast HER kinetics of the MoS2 catalyst and less overpotential was required for the HER, resulting in the higher photocurrent density and more positive onset potential of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode than those of the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode. To elucidate the decrease in the Rct of the OHP photocathodes induced by the integration of the MoS2 catalyst, we performed EIS measurements under illumination and fitted the Nyquist plots using an equivalent circuit. The Rct of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode (10 Ω cm2) was smaller than that of the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode (211 Ω cm2), confirming the fast charge transfer kinetics of the HER induced by the integration of the MoS2 catalyst (Fig. S11). In addition, the similar OCP of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP and bare Ti foil/OHP photocathodes (Fig. S12a and b, respectively) indicated that the increase in the photocurrent density and onset potential was not due to the thermodynamic effect but was attributed to the improvement in the charge transfer kinetics owing to the high catalytic activity of MoS2.

To accurately analyze the efficiency of the OHP photocathodes in terms of solar H2 production, we determined their ηF and calculated their HC-STH. The total H2 evolution yield of 139 μmol achieved using the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode after 3 h was significantly higher than that of the Ti foil/OHP photocathode (94 μmol), as shown in Fig. 4b. Abundant H2 evolved from the surface of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode operated at 0 V vs. RHE under illumination (Video S1). Using the yield of evolved H2, the calculated average ηF for H2 evolution of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was estimated to be 94.2%. This indicated that the photogenerated electrons from the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode facilitated H2 generation. Conversely, the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode exhibited a low average ηF of 77.5% for H2 evolution even though its photocurrent density was comparable to that of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode, indicating that a significant loss of photogenerated electrons occurred between the Ti foil and the electrolyte. Furthermore, the HC-STH of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was calculated using the LSV curve in Fig. 4a and its ηF. The HC-STH of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was considerably higher than that of the bare Ti foil/OHP photocathode regardless of the potential, and it reached a maximum value of 11.07% at 0.63 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4c). This was the highest HC-STH of all the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathodes in this study. For comparison, the LSV curve of the Pt/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was measured under the same conditions and the corresponding HC-STH of this photocathode was calculated to be 12.23% at 0.72 V vs. RHE using the LSV curve and ηF (94.5%), as shown in Fig. S13a and b. To fabricate Pt/Ti foil, a piece of cleaned Ti foil was immersed in a 5.16 mM aqueous solution of K2PtCl4 for 60 s. The HC-STH of the Pt/Ti foil/OHP photocathode (12.23%) was higher than that of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode (11.07%) because the HER catalytic activity of the Pt catalyst was higher than that of the MoS2 catalyst. However, the HC-STH of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was still comparable with that of the Pt/Ti foil/OHP photocathode.
The maximum HC-STH and the corresponding potential of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode were compared with those of previously reported state-of-the-art photocathodes, in accordance with the materials used as light absorption layers (chalcogenides, oxides, organic, and silicon), and the results are presented in Fig. 4d. The other PEC performance parameters of the compared photocathodes, including the photocurrent density, onset potential, HC-STH, and potential at the maximum HC-STH, are summarized in Table S1. The HC-STH of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was higher than those of the previously reported state-of-the-art Pt-free photocathodes. Although the Pt/CdS/CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2 (CIGS) photocathode exhibited a maximum HC-STH of 12.5%, which was higher than that of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode (11.07%), the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode achieved the maximum HC-STH at a more positive potential (0.63 V vs. RHE) than the Pt/CdS/CIGS photocathode (0.53 V vs. RHE). This indicated that the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode is suitable for bias-free PEC water splitting, particularly when combined with state-of-the-art photoanodes. We believe that MoS2 is an excellent and promising HER catalyst, which has a performance comparable to or even better than that of Pt, enabling a high HC-STH and can be used to fabricate cost-effective OHP-based photocathodes. Moreover, the PEC performance of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was superior to that of other state-of-the-art photocathodes using MoS2 as a catalyst, indicating the significant synergistic effects between the MoS2 catalyst and OHP photocathode. The PEC performance of state-of-the-art photocathodes using MoS2 as the catalyst is summarized in Table S2.

Despite their excellent optoelectronic properties, it is challenging to fabricate OHP-based photocathodes that are stable in aqueous electrolytes under continuous illumination owing to the poor stability of OHP. Nevertheless, the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode in this study presented excellent PEC stability for 120 h, which has been the record long-term PEC stability reported for OHP-based photoelectrodes, including both photoanodes and photocathodes to date (Fig. 4e). Moreover, the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode retained more than 50% of its photocurrent density after 120 h, which is an unprecedented result among OHP-based photocathodes. In addition, the OHP layer did not exhibit significant degradation after its PEC stability was measured (Fig. S14a and b). The photocurrent degradation of OHP-based photocathodes is unavoidable because they are placed in an environment in which charge traps can accumulate more easily than for the corresponding OHP PV cells owing to the sluggish charge transfer that occurs when photogenerated electrons transfer to the electrolyte during PEC water splitting. Typically, the charge accumulation at the interfaces in OHP PV cells is one of the critical factors which deteriorate the stability of the OHP layer. Therefore, a method for minimizing charge accumulation is required to improve the PEC stability of OHP-based photocathodes for their future practical application. The PEC performance parameters of previously reported OHP-based photocathodes and the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode in this study are summarized in Table 2. For a more convenient comparison, we used the time required for the photocurrent density to reach 80% of its initial value (T80). The T80 of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode was 40.7 h, which was more than two times longer than that of previously reported OHP-based photocathodes. To date, the PEC stability of OHP-based photocathodes has been significantly improved using Ti foil as an encapsulation layer and improved once again by introducing EGaIn as the contact material between the Ti foil and the OHP layer. As the final outcome, the PEC stability of OHP-based photocathodes was significantly improved by integrating the Ti foil encapsulation layer with a stable MoS2 HER catalyst (Fig. 4e). The unprecedented PEC stability of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode indicated the great potential of cost-effective OHP-based photocathodes.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode can be used for efficient and stable PEC water splitting. The earth-abundant and cost-effective MoS2 HER catalyst, which was integrated with the Ti foil encapsulation layer, significantly improved the onset potential, photocurrent density, and ηF of the OHP-based photocathode. The MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode exhibited remarkable PEC performance, including an onset potential of 1.02 V vs. RHE, a photocurrent density of −20.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, and a HC-STH of 11.07%. Furthermore, the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode retained more than 50% of its PEC performance in an aqueous electrolyte under 120 h of continuous illumination. Moreover, the remarkable PEC performance with long-term stability was achieved without using the scarce and high cost Pt catalyst. In this study, MoS2 was used to replace Pt as a HER catalyst for OHP-based photocathodes for the first time. Other earth-abundant and cost-effective HER catalysts with robust HER catalytic activity can be integrated in encapsulation layers to fabricate efficient and stable OHP-based photocathodes. In this regard, the remarkable PEC performance of the MoS2/Ti foil/OHP photocathode in this study with unprecedented PEC stability in aqueous electrolytes can pave the way for future development of practical applications of Pt-free PEC water splitting using OHP-based photocathodes.
