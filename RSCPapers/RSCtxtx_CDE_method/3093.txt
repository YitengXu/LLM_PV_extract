A novel BDT monomer with an alkylthiobiphenyl side chain named 4,8-bis(4′-((2-hexyldecyl)thio)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTBPS) was designed and synthesized. The polymer named PBDTBPS–BDD was synthesized with BDTBPS and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD). Solar cells were studied by blending the polymer PBDTBPS–BDD with both fullerene and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC). The optimized polymer solar cells showed a PCE of 8.40% and 9.76% for the PC71BM-based and ITIC-based solar cells, respectively. This research indicates that the novel monomer is a promising unit for constructing high-efficiency polymer solar cells.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique advantages, like flexibility, low cost and large-scale production. A breakthrough has been achieved for the improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the past few years. Recently, high PCEs have been achieved for PSCs by blending a donor material with a fullerene or a non-fullerene acceptor material. The PCE was determined by three key parameters, which are open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Therefore, to achieve a brilliant PCE, the key points that we should pay more attention to are broad absorption spectra for a larger Jsc, a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for a higher Voc with a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level for efficient charge separation, and high hole mobility for a larger Jsc and FF.

Fullerenes and their derivatives, as the dominant acceptor materials, have been widely studied because of their high electron mobility, high electron affinity and isotropic charge transport. Compared with fullerene acceptors, a classical non-fullerene acceptor material named 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) has been widely studied by many groups all over the world since it was reported by Zhan's group in 2015. It is known that ITIC-based devices usually show higher Voc than fullerene-based devices because of its relatively high LUMO energy level. On the other hand, ITIC-based devices show larger Jsc owing to the strong absorption in the near-infrared region, which generates wider absorption spectra when blended with appropriate donor materials. Recently, some novel donor materials blended with ITIC showed excellent photovoltaic performance; in particular, a few donor materials like PBDTS-NQx, J71 and PBDB-T have made the 11% PCE breakthrough for single-junction PSCs, which provides great inspiration and enlightenment for researchers. Therefore, to realize commercial applications, designing novel high-efficiency donor materials is still imperative and full of challenges.
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely studied for constructing excellent donor materials in recent years. Therein, side chain engineering is regarded as a valuable strategy to tune energy levels and absorption spectra of polymers. Recently, a novel BDT unit with an alkoxybiphenyl side chain was reported by our group. The polymer-based alkoxybiphenyl-substituted BDT demonstrated a great Jsc because of its extended π-conjugation and good symmetry. Nevertheless, the Voc was not prominent so the performance could not be further promoted. As we all know, the sulfur atom always shows unique characters in PSCs because of both its electron-donating ability and some π-acceptor capability. Therefore, polymers with alkylthio side chains usually show a slightly broadened absorption spectrum and a lower HOMO energy level, which is beneficial for larger Jsc and higher Voc. Therefore, the BDT monomer linking with the alkylthiobiphenyl group may be a good electron-donating unit for constructing high-performance polymer donor materials with both high Voc and large Jsc.
Here, a novel monomer BDTBPS was synthesized by introducing an alkylthiobiphenyl side chain into the BDT core. The polymer PBDTBPS–BDD was obtained by the Stille coupling reaction using BDTBPS and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD). The resulting polymer PBDTBPS–BDD exhibited high thermal stability. Moreover, the polymer showed a deep HOMO energy level of −5.30 eV. The photovoltaic performance was investigated by blending with both PC71BM and ITIC. Benefiting from the low HOMO, the optimized PSCs showed PCEs of 8.40% and 9.76% with high Voc of 0.88 V and 0.96 V for PC71BM-based and ITIC-based solar cells, respectively. This work demonstrated that the alkylthiobiphenyl side chain could improve the photovoltaic performance with an obvious effect.

Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione was purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Sci. Tech. Co., Ltd; 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD-Br) was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. All of the chemicals were used as received. Tetrahydrofuran and toluene were dried over Na/benzophenone and freshly distilled prior to use. Other chemicals were commercial and were used as received. The general synthetic routes for the compound BDTBPS and its polymer PBDTBPS–BDD are shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic routes are as follows.

The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM), washed with water and dried with Na2SO4. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether (PE) as the eluent solution to obtain 18.0 g of m1 as a colourless liquid with 82.2% yield. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.40–7.35 (m, 2H), 7.18 (dd, J = 6.4, 4.7 Hz, 2H), 2.86 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H), 1.63–1.58 (m, 1H), 1.44–1.34 (m, 4H), 1.30–1.21 (m, 21H), 0.88 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 6H).


A dried three-neck flask was charged with compound m1 (4.6 g, 11.12 mmol) and dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (40 mL) under an argon atmosphere. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 9.0 mL) was slowly added to the solution at −78 °C and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. Then the isopropoxyboronic acid pinacol ester (3.4 mL) was added dropwise at −78 °C and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by water and neutralized with diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) until the pH was 7.0. Then the mixture was extracted with DCM and washed with water. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with PE and DCM as the eluent solution to obtain 4.5 g of m2 as a colourless liquid with 87.9% yield. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.68 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.27 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 4H), 2.91 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H), 1.67–1.61 (m, 1H), 1.44–1.22 (m, 44H), 0.89–0.86 (m, 6H), −0.00 (s, 1H).


A mixture of compound m2 (4.5 g, 9.77 mmol), 1,4-dibromobenzene (2.54 g, 10.75 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (0.45 g, 0.39 mmol), K2CO3 (6.8 g, 48.85 mmol), H2O (10 mL), THF (10 mL) and toluene (40 mL) was refluxed overnight under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was extracted with DCM and washed with water and then dried with Na2SO4. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with PE and DCM as the eluent solution to obtain 2.5 g of m3 as a colourless liquid with 52.3% yield. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.56–7.53 (m, 2H), 7.47–7.44 (m, 2H), 7.44–7.41 (m, 2H), 7.39–7.35 (m, 2H), 2.93 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H), 1.69–1.60 (m, 1H), 1.40 (d, J = 21.1, 14.0, 8.0 Hz, 5H), 1.33–1.18 (m, 20H), 0.88 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 6H).


Compound m3 (8.5 g, 17.36 mmol) dissolved in THF (100 mL) was cooled to −78 °C under the protection of nitrogen. n-BuLi (8.7 mL, 20.83 mmol, 2.4 M) was dropped slowly into the solution. After keeping the mixture at −78 °C for 2 hours, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophen-4,8-dione (1.59 g, 7.23 mmol) was poured into the flask quickly. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. SnCl2·2H2O dissolved in 10% HCl (50 mL) was injected and stirred for another 12 hours. The mixture was extracted by DCM and washed with water. 3.1 g of white solid (42.5% yield) was obtained after further purification by silica gel column chromatography. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.83–7.76 (m, 8H), 7.64 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 4H), 7.44 (dd, J = 6.9, 3.7 Hz, 6H), 7.41 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H), 2.98 (d, J = 6.2 Hz, 4H), 1.74–1.63 (m, 2H), 1.43 (ddt, J = 20.7, 13.6, 6.6 Hz, 8H), 1.35–1.24 (m, 40H), 0.89 (td, J = 6.8, 4.4 Hz, 12H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3): 140.27, 138.19, 137.78, 137.36, 136.20, 130.12, 129.86, 129.04, 127.41, 127.20, 122.97, 77.23, 77.02, 76.80, 38.44, 37.59, 33.23, 31.90, 29.95, 29.61, 29.36, 26.55, 22.70, 14.13.



n-BuLi (3.6 mL, 8.61 mmol, 2.4 M) was dropped slowly into a solution of compound m4 (3.1 g, 3.08 mmol) dissolved in dry THF (100 mL) under the protection of nitrogen at −78 °C. After keeping the mixture at −78 °C for 3 hours, trimethyltin chloride (10.8 mL, 10.78 mmol, 1.0 M) was injected into the flask quickly. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature and then stopped by the addition of water. The crude product was extracted by DCM and then the solution was removed. The crude product was purified by recrystallization from n-hexane. A faint yellow solid (3.38 g, 82.4% yield) was gained. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.82 (q, J = 8.3 Hz, 8H), 7.67 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 4H), 7.48–7.41 (m, 6H), 2.98 (d, J = 6.2 Hz, 4H), 1.72–1.66 (m, 2H), 1.51–1.37 (m, 9H), 1.35–1.22 (m, 45H), 0.90 (dd, J = 6.8, 2.0 Hz, 12H), 0.52–0.19 (m, 18H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3): 142.53, 142.25, 139.98, 138.89, 137.94, 137.20, 137.04, 130.65, 129.98, 129.10, 128.54, 127.43, 127.15, 77.24, 77.03, 76.82, 38.49, 37.62, 33.25, 31.92, 31.61, 29.96, 29.63, 29.37, 26.57, 22.70, 14.15, −8.31.


Compounds BDTBPSSn (133.3 mg, 0.1 mmol), BDD–Br (76.7 mg, 0.1 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (1.8 mg, 0.002 mmol), and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were added into a flask. The flask was subjected to three successive vacuum cycles followed by refilling with argon, and then 4 mL of dry toluene was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C carefully for 2 h under argon protection. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the polymer was precipitated by addition of methanol, then filtered and purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) sequentially. The o-DCB solution was concentrated by evaporation and then precipitated into methanol. The purple solid was filtered to yield the desired polymer PBDTBPS–BDD (148 mg, 91.9% yield).


Organic solar cells were tested with the conventional bulk heterojunction sandwich device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTBPS–BDD:acceptor/PFN/Al. Patterned ITO-coated glass needed to be ultrasonically cleaned with ITO detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 minutes each in the proper order. Subsequently, the substrates need to be exposed to the treatment of oxygen plasma for another 6 minutes. Next, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrates before annealing at 160 °C for 30 minutes in a drying oven. Finally, the substrates were placed in a glove box. The blend solution of PBDTBPS–BDD and acceptor material (PC71BM or ITIC) in DCB was spin-coated onto the substrates, and PFN was spin-coated onto the active layer. Finally, the electrode Al (ca. 100 nm) was slowly deposited through a mask to define the active area of 0.10 cm2 in a high vacuum degree of 10−5 orders of magnitude.

PCE was measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under the illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The EQE spectra for the PSCs were recorded using a certified Newport incident photon conversation efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
The morphology of the blend films was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) employing an Agilent 5400 with tapping mode and a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV, respectively.

The general synthetic routes for the compound BDTBPSSn and polymer PBDTBPS–BDD are shown in Scheme 1. The chemical structures of the compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra. The raw material 4-bromobenzenethiol reacted with bromoalkane to provide m1, which was used to prepare m2 by lithiation and reaction with isopropoxyboronic acid pinacol ester. The S-containing side chain of m3 was obtained by the Suzuki coupling reaction. The side chain was introduced into BDT via the normal procedure. Finally, the compound BDTBPSSn was obtained from the precursor BDTBPS by lithiation and then quenching with trimethyltin. Polymer PBDTBPS–BDD was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction. The detailed synthesis was given in the Experiment section.

The number average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTBPS–BDD was 21 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.3. The thermal properties of BDTBPS–BDD were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), PBDTBPS–BDD exhibited high thermal stability with an onset decomposition temperature (Td) with 5% weight-loss located at ca. 394 °C.

The normalized optical ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymer in o-DCB solution and as a solid film are shown in Fig. 1. Similar optical properties were found in solution and as a film. The PBDTBPS–BDD solution showed a main absorption peak at ca. 581 nm and a shoulder peak at ca. 623 nm. The film showed a main absorption peak at the same wavelength. As shown in Fig. 1a, the absorption spectrum was slightly red-shifted in film compared to in solution. Compared with the spectrum in o-DCB solution, the spectrum of film shows a similar absorption shape, which could be ascribed to the molecular aggregates in the solution. The maximum absorption coefficients of PBDTBPS–BDD in o-DCB solution and solid film were measured, and the value for the solution was enhanced by ca. 78% compared with that of the film, as shown in Fig. 1b (0.91 × 105vs. 0.51 × 105). The absorption onset (λonset) of PBDTBPS–BDD was 678 nm and the corresponding optical band gap was about 1.83 eV.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of PBDTBPS–BDD. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), the HOMO energy level was calculated to be −5.30 eV from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) of 0.96 eV. The corresponding LUMO energy level was about −3.47 eV, which was obtained from the difference between the HOMO energy level and the optical band gap. The deep HOMO energy level was conducive to realizing the high Voc for the PSCs.

BHJ solar cells based on PC71BM and ITIC as the acceptor were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBDTBPS–BDD. The devices with a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTBPS–BDD:acceptor/PFN/Al had optimal ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:1 for PC71BM and ITIC, respectively. The corresponding PCEs of 6.81% and 7.33% were obtained for the PC71BM-based solar cells and ITIC-based solar cells without any pretreatment, respectively. The device performance was improved after thermal annealing and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI) with different annealing temperatures. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of additives on the photovoltaic performance of the devices, but the performance was inferior to that of the thermally annealed devices as shown in Table S1 and Fig. S5 (ESI).

For the PC71BM-based solar cells, the PCE was increased to 8.40% owing to the enhanced Jsc after thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. For ITIC-based solar cells, the optimal PCE of 9.76% was achieved, which benefited from the obvious enhanced Jsc and FF after thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The typical J–V curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The ITIC-based solar cells showed a higher Voc (0.96 V vs. 0.88 V) and a larger Jsc (17.17 mA cm−2vs. 14.02 mA cm−2) than the PC71BM-based solar cells, which was derived from the higher LUMO energy level and wider absorption spectrum of ITIC than PC71BM. The typical EQE curves of the optimal devices based on PC71BM and ITIC are shown in Fig. 2b. The two devices showed high EQE values with a peak near 80%. Compared with the PC71BM-based solar cells, the solar cells based on ITIC exhibited a broader photoresponse range from 300 to 800 nm, which profited from the strong absorption of ITIC in the near-infrared region and therefore the good spectral complementarity between PBDTBPS–BDD and ITIC. The integrated current densities (JEQEsc) from the EQE spectra are 13.54 and 16.76 mA cm−2 for the PC71BM- and ITIC-based devices, respectively, consistent with the Jsc values measured from the solar cell devices with a small deviation of around 5%. Therefore, the ITIC-based device showed larger Jsc than the PC71BM-based device.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure polymer and blend films were measured to investigate the photo-induced electron transfer behavior between the polymer and the PC71BM or ITIC. As shown in Fig. 3a, these blends of polymer:ITIC (PC71BM) demonstrated a high proportion of quenching in comparison with the PL spectrum of the pure polymer. High PL quenching efficiency means that these devices have an effective charge transfer and exciton separation, which are in agreement with the higher Jsc values of the related devices. In addition, the relationship between the photocurrent (Jph) and the effective applied voltage (Veff) was studied to further analyze the charge generation, transport and extraction for the PBDTBPS–BDD-based devices (Fig. 3b). Jph = JL − JD, where JD and JL represent the current density in the dark and under illumination, respectively. The effective voltage is Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0, and Vappl stands for the applied voltage. For the optimized device, the charge dissociation probabilities, Pdiss (Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturated current density), for PBDTBPS–BDD:ITIC and PBDTBPS–BDD:PCBM are calculated to be 89.8% and 95.3%, respectively, which suggests that the PBDTBPS–BDD:PCBM has some advantages in improving charge extraction and suppressing molecule recombination, but owing to the limitation of the absorption region, the Jsc was lower compared with that for ITIC.

The morphologies of the blend films were investigated by AFM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the polymer presented a good film-forming property when blended with PC71BM and ITIC. The blend films exhibited a smooth surface morphology with a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of ca. 1.49 nm and 1.78 nm for blending with PC71BM and ITIC, respectively. However, the blends presented different bulk morphologies, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. An obvious nanofibrillar structure was observed in the PBDTBPS–BDD:PC71BM blends, which was not found in the PBDTBPS–BDD:ITIC blends. As a comparison, the PBDTBPS–BDD:ITIC blends exhibited a finely dispersed phase separation without the polymer fibres, which is similar to the other non-fullerene systems. The appearance of the nanofibrillar structure may have constructed the good interpenetrating network in the PBDTBPS–BDD:PC71BM blends, which favours exciton dissociation and charge transport and therefore improved the FF in the PC71BM-based solar cells.


The transport characteristics were investigated using the space charge-limited-current model to measure hole and electron mobilities in the blend films with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PBDTBPS–BDD:acceptor/Au and ITO/ZnO/PBDTBPS–BDD:acceptor/PFN/Al. As shown in Table 2, a hole mobility of 5.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 5.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for the PC71BM-based film and a hole mobility of 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for the ITIC-based film (the corresponding film thicknesses are shown in Table S2, ESI). Meanwhile, hole to electron mobility ratios (μh/μe) of 0.89 and 1.42 were obtained for the PC71BM-based and ITIC-based films, respectively. Consequently, the larger mobilities and more balanced charge carrier transport of the PC71BM-based blend film contributed to achieving the higher FF (Fig. 5).

The optimized PSCs showed PCE of 8.40% and 9.76% for the PC71BM-based and ITIC-based films, respectively. This research indicated that the novel monomer is a promising monomer for constructing high-efficiency PSCs.
