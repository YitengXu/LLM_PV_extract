In recent years, copper(II/I) complexes have attracted growing interest as redox mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells. Here, we report a new class of copper complexes bearing a bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-ethanedithiol ligand, coded as [Cu(N2S2)]2+/+, with tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]−) and hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]−) counterions. Strikingly, it is discovered that the solubility and diffusion coefficients of Cu(I) species are dramatically improved by changing the counterion from [BF4]− to [PF6]−. As a result, DSCs incorporating the latter redox system show a much enhanced short-circuit current density and fill factor, which in turn lead to a superior overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.3% under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). This has been the highest PCE reported so far for copper redox mediators with sulfur-coordinating ligands in DSCs. Thus, this work provides an effective strategy for further design of more efficient redox mediators in DSCs.

The utilization of solar energy offers a promising approach to alleviate the worldwide energy demand and challenges in environmental and climate issues. In the past three decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted extensive attention as a representative next-generation solar cell technology, owing to their ease of fabrication, aesthetic design characteristics, and prominent efficiency, particularly for indoor applications.

Recently, copper(II/I) redox mediators have been the spotlight in the research of DSCs, because of some of their advantages, such as high photovoltage, reduced driving force for dye regeneration, smaller molecule size compared to cobalt complexes, etc. At present, copper(II/I) redox mediators have been almost exclusively dominated by nitrogen-coordinating ligands, i.e. phenanthroline and bipyridine derivatives. The state-of-the-art systems using [Cu(tmby)2]2+/+ (tmby = 4,4,6,6′-tetramethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) have achieved excellent efficiencies of 13.5% under one sun irradiation and over 34% under ambient lighting.
Copper complexes, also known as blue copper proteins, have been widely used as effective electron-transfer mediators in natural enzymes. The copper metal center is coordinated to two nitrogen atoms from histidine residues, and to two sulfur atoms (one from a cysteine residue and one from a methionine residue). The incorporation of highly polarizable sulfur-coordinating ligands can positively shift the redox potentials of copper complexes. Up till now, only a few examples of copper redox mediators containing sulfur-coordinating ligands have been reported in DSCs. However, their solar cell performances are not satisfactory and lag far behind those of their nitrogen counterparts. In 2005, Fukuzumi et al. first incorporated the blue copper model complex, [(−)-sparteine-N,N′](maleonitriledithiolato-S,S′)copper ([Cu(SP)(mmt)])0/−, as a redox mediator in DSCs, the overall efficiency of which was merely 1.3%. Hupp and coworkers reported Cu(PDTO)2+/+ (PDTO = 1,8-bis(2′-pyridyl)-3,6-dithiaoctane) redox shuttles in DSCs, which have shown a PCE of less than 2%. The author group developed copper redox mediators bearing a tetradentate polythioether ligand. Interestingly, a high photovoltage of 0.99 V was achieved by using this redox shuttle. Nevertheless, a mediocre PCE of 8.4% was obtained, mainly due to the relatively low photocurrent density (11.7 mA cm−2) associated with poor solubility of the Cu(I) complex.
Herein, we design and synthesize a new class of copper complexes bearing a bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-ethanedithiol ligand, [Cu(N2S2)]2+/+, with [BF4]− and [PF6]− counterions. The effects of counterions on the properties of copper complexes and on the solar cell performance were systematically studied. It was found that the solubility and diffusion coefficients of Cu(I) species are significantly enhanced by varying the counterion from [BF4]− to [PF6]−. As a consequence, DSCs incorporating the latter redox system show a much improved short-circuit current density and fill factor, which lead to a superior overall PCE of 10.3% under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G).

The synthesis method of ligand N2S2 was improved on the basis of the reported literature as shown in Scheme 1. Ethanedithiol (25 mmol, 2.28 g) and 2-chloromethylpyridine (excess 10%, 55 mmol, 9.02 g) were dissolved in 150 mL of acetonitrile. After stirring for 15 minutes, K2CO3 (25.0 mmol, 3.5 g) was added, and the reaction was refluxed for 12 h. The organic solvent was removed by rotary evaporation after the reaction was cooled to room temperature, and the remaining product was further washed with a saturated salt solution and extracted with CH2Cl2 three times. After drying with MgSO4, the white product (19.16 mmol, 5.29 g, 77%) was obtained from recrystallization in acetonitrile at −10 °C. ESI-MS: calcd for [M + H]+m/z: 277.08; found: 277.08.

Four copper complexes [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n, [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2, [Cu(N2S2)]2(PF6)2, and [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](PF6)2 were synthesized according to the reported literature, except for using acetonitrile as the solvent. The synthesis and characterization of the ligand and copper complexes are described in the Experimental section.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out to study the influence of counterions on the molecular configuration of copper complexes. The crystal structures of [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2, [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](PF6)2, [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n, and [Cu(N2S2)]2(PF6)2 are presented in Fig. 1. The crystallographic data, and partial bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI. The obvious difference in using different counterions is reflected in the crystallographic data (Table S1, ESI). Copper complexes with [BF4]− belong to the monoclinic system with space group P2(1)/c, whereas copper complexes with [PF6]− are crystallized in the triclinic system and 1 space group. [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)]2+ displays a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry configuration (Fig. 1a, τ-index = 0.68) as the counter ion is [BF4]−, however, the square pyramidal configuration (Fig. 1b, τ-index = 0.32) is observed when the counter ion changes to [PF6]−. The observed configurational difference is mainly attributed to the change in the coordination site of CH3CN (Table S2, ESI). For Cu(I) complexes, both N2 atoms cannot coordinate to Cu1 due to coordination saturation of the Cu(I) center and each Cu1 center connects to a pyridine unit from another adjacent N2S2 ligand (Fig. 1c and d). In addition, each [Cu(N2S2)](BF4) moiety alternatively connects to the adjacent [Cu(N2S2)](BF4) unit to form a one dimensional linear coordination polymer (Fig. 1c). However, each [Cu(N2S2)]+ moiety in [Cu(N2S2)](PF6) coordinates to another [Cu(N2S2)]+ unit through two Cu–N bonds (Cu1–N3 and Cu2–N2), forming a dimer (Fig. 1d).This phenomenon may be due to the steric hindrance of counterions because the size of [PF6]− is larger than that of [BF4]−. Although the anions are noncoordinating, they have a significant impact on the molecular structure of the Cu(I) complex. Moreover, similar powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns and calculated patterns based on the single-crystal simulation of Cu(I) complexes reveal that the bulk sample consists of a pure single phase (Fig. S4, ESI).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of copper complexes are illustrated in Fig. 2a. It can be found that the counterions have an almost negligible impact on the UV-vis absorption spectra of four copper complexes. For Cu(II) complexes, the strong absorption peaks at λmax = 262 nm (ε = 13702 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2; ε = 12741 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](PF6)2) are caused by the π → π* absorption of pyridine units in the ligand. The absorption peaks at about λmax = 340 nm (ε = 2785 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2; ε = 2504 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](PF6)2) are due to sulfur-to-Cu(II) charge transfer. In addition, the weak broad peaks at 609 nm (ε = 348 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2; ε = 330 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](PF6)2) are the characteristic absorptions of the d–d transition for Cu(II) complexes. As for Cu(I) complexes, the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions are located at λmax = 320 nm (ε = 964 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n; ε = 886 M−1 cm−1 for [Cu(N2S2)]2(PF6)2). Although the crystal samples of Cu(I) complexes were grown in acetonitrile solutions, there is a possibility of structural change when samples are redissolved in acetonitrile. Therefore, UV-vis absorption of Cu(I) complexes with different concentrations was tested as shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI. The molar absorption intensity at varied wavelengths is consistent, which implies that no structural change of Cu(I) complexes is occurred during the dissolution process. As shown in Fig. S2d and S3d, the DOSY NMR results showed that the measured points of the two copper(I) complexes are on a straight line, further indicating that the structure of Cu(I) complexes remains unchanged during the diffusion process. The in situ Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n with varied concentrations are shown in Fig. S6. No significant shift of characteristic peaks is observed during the dilution process. Besides, [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n was dissolved in acetonitrile and kept for three days. Then, it was regained through vacuum depression vaporization. The PXRD pattern of the regained [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n powder remains almost the same as that of the initial crystal (Fig. S7). These results imply that the structure remains consistent after dissolution of the coordination polymer into acetonitrile. Furthermore, the saturation solution concentration of [Cu(N2S2)]2(PF6)2 is calculated to be 0.21 M by the standard curve method (here the concentration represents the concentration of the Cu(I) ion for easier comparison), which is two times higher than that of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n as depicted in Fig. 2b and S8 in the ESI. Therefore, the impact of counterions is reflected in the difference of solubility of Cu(I) complexes, which also supports the consistent structures observed before and after dissolution. It is also worth noting that there is almost no visible light absorption competition for the copper complexes studied with dye Y123 (Fig. S9, ESI) (λmax = 513 nm, ε = ∼50000 M−1 cm−1), which is beneficial for the photocurrents in the solar cell devices.
The electrochemical properties of these copper complexes were examined by using a standard three-electrode system. As presented in Fig. 3a, the peaks at E1/2 = 0.71 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) in CV curves are all considered as the redox peaks of Cu(II/I) couples instead of the redox peaks of the ligand. It can be also found that the noncoordinating counterions have no influence on the redox potentials of these copper complexes. This redox potential of copper complexes matches well with the HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level of dye Y123 (1.07 V vs. NHE), making them suitable candidates as redox mediators in DSCs. To prove no structural change of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n/[Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2 after the redox reaction, the CV and spectroelectrochemistry experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. S10, the CV curves of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n and [Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2 after scanning 500 times are consistent with the initial waves. Meanwhile, when a potential of 1.0 V vs. NHE was applied to [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n and a potential of 0.4 V vs. NHE was applied to [Cu(N2S2)](BF4)2, the variations at λmax = 340 nm for sulfur-to-Cu(II) charge transfer were observed in the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S11). These phenomena imply that the redox process of copper complexes with [BF4]− involves the disassembly of the polymer and reassembly upon reduction.
In our previous work, we successfully applied Lewis base additive 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DBP) to replace the most commonly used tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in the electrolytes, because the latter one can replace the sulfur-coordinating ligands for Cu(II) complexes. The effect of DBP and TBP on the electrochemical properties and UV-vis absorption spectra of four copper complexes was examined as shown in Fig. S12 and S13 in the ESI. As expected, no obvious changes of UV-vis absorption spectra and CV curves are observed for these copper complexes after addition of DBP into the electrolytes, indicating that DBP cannot coordinate to the copper centers. Therefore, DBP is used as an additive in the electrolytes in this work.
The diffusion coefficient (D) of these copper complexes was calculated by the CV measurements at different scan rates based on the Randles–Sevcik equation ip = 0.4463nFAC(nFvD/RT)1/2. The results are presented in Fig. 4 and S14 in the ESI, and the calculated values are listed in Table S3 in the ESI. No significant difference of the diffusion coefficients was observed for Cu(II) complexes. However, the D value of [Cu(N2S2)]2(PF6)2 is over 25% higher than that of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n. This will have an influence on the solar cell performance, which will be discussed in the following section.
Two new electrolytes containing [Cu(N2S2)]2(PF6)2/[Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](PF6)2 (E1) and [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n/[Cu(N2S2)(CH3CN)](BF4)2 (E2) were further tested in DSCs, in combination with dye Y123 and the Pt counter electrode. Solar cell fabrication details are described in the ESI. Note that a lower concentration of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n (0.07 M) was used due to its poor solubility in acetonitrile. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) performance of the best DSCs for each redox mediator recorded under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) and in the dark is displayed in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. The devices using E1 exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.3%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.01 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.66, respectively. In contrast, the Jsc (13.1 mA cm−2) and FF (0.60) values are found to be much lower for E2-based devices, which result in an inferior PCE of only 7.9%. The reproducibility of DSCs employing these two electrolytes was examined based on 20 identical cells as presented in Fig. S15 in the ESI. The average PCEs for E1-and E2-based devices are 10.0% ± 0.3% and 7.6% ± 0.4%, respectively. For comparison purposes, DSCs employing the state-of-the-art [Cu(tmby)2]2+/+ were also tested, in which a typical electrolyte composition of such a redox mediator and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) counter electrodes were used (Fig. S16, ESI). The devices show a champion PCE of 10.4%, which is analogous to that of E1. The indoor light efficiency of the two electrolytes was tested at 1000 lux, and the results are presented in Fig. S17 and Table S4. The devices using E1 afford a much higher indoor light power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.6%, with an Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 143.95 μA cm−2, and a FF of 0.69, respectively. By contrast, E2-based devices only show an indoor light PCE of only 17.0%.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSCs containing these two electrolytes are presented in Fig. 5b. The devices using E1 show a broad IPCE plateau of more than 80% in the range of 390–600 nm, which is considerably higher than those for E2. The Jsc values for E1 and E2 based devices attained from J–V tests were 15.4, and 13.1 mA cm−2, and those achieved from integrated current density curves were 15.0, and 12.7 mA cm−2. Therefore, the integrated data from IPCE spectra agree with the J–V test values. IPCE at a given wavelength is mainly governed by light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron-injection efficiency (φinj), dye-regeneration efficiency (φreg), and charge-collection efficiency (ηcol). The effects of LHE and φinj can be ignored because the same sensitizer and same TiO2 electrode are used. Therefore, the difference detected in IPCE spectra should be linked to φreg and/or ηcol.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were conducted to further investigate dye regeneration kinetics of these two electrolytes as illustrated in Fig. 5c. The absorbance signal in the presence of an inert electrolyte (0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 0.5 M DBP in acetonitrile) shows a half-life (t1/2) of 7.57 μs, which originates from the recombination between the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and the oxidized dye molecules. The absorbance signal shows an accelerated decay upon addition of copper complexes, indicative of the regeneration of oxidized dyes by the Cu(I) species. The t1/2 values for E1 and E2 are measured to be 0.44 and 0.49 μs, respectively. According to the equation φreg = kreg/(kreg + krec), φreg of E1 is calculated to be 94.2%, which is higher than that of E2 (93.5%). Thus, a slightly higher φreg could partially contribute to the improved IPCE values observed for the E1-based device.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were implemented under one sun illumination to gain an understanding of charge recombination kinetics of these two devices. The Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit model are presented in Fig. 5d, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S5 in the ESI. The mid-frequency range semicircle (1–103 Hz) corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The Rct of the device with E1 is measured to be 235.9 Ω, which is considerably larger than that of the E2-based device (176.9 Ω). This result indicates that the charge recombination rate is higher at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface for the E2-based device. Consequently, the calculated electron lifetime is substantially longer for the E1 system, which is strongly correlated with an improved ηcol. As discussed above, the diffusion coefficient of [Cu(N2S2)]n(BF4)n is smaller as compared to that of its [PF6]− counterpart. This will most likely result in mass transport limitation for the former system. To verify this hypothesis, the light intensity dependence of Jsc for devices with these two electrolytes was studied and the results are exhibited in Fig. S18 in the ESI. As expected, the Jsc values deviate from linearity for E2 with the increase of the light intensity. The reason lies in the fact that the mass transport limitation of Cu(I) species will probably interfere with the dye regeneration process. Inefficient dye regeneration leads to a considerably higher equilibrium concentration of photo-oxidized dye molecules. This will result in a faster charge recombination rate between electrons in TiO2 and oxidized dye molecules, which agrees well the EIS results. On the other hand, diffusion limitation issues are also associated with a higher series resistance, which accounts for the lower fill factor detected for devices with E2.

In summary, we have prepared two new copper complexes bearing a sulfur-coordinating ligand and applied them as redox mediators in DSCs. It was found that noncoordinating counterions have a significant impact on the molecular configuration of Cu(I) complexes. Through changing the counterions from [BF4]− to [PF6]−, the solubility and diffusion coefficients of Cu(I) species are much improved. Consequently, DSCs based on the latter electrolyte exhibit a higher Jsc and FF, strongly linked to much enhanced charge-collection efficiency and reduced series resistance. An overall efficiency of 10.3% is achieved by such a system, which is on a par with the state-of-the-art [Cu(tmby)2]2+/+. The present work thus offers an effective approach for the development of more efficient redox mediators in DSCs.
