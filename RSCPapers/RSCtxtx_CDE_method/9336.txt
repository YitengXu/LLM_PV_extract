In this study, new polymers PTFDPP, PBTFDPP, PTTFDPP, PTCNEFDPP, PTDCNFDPP and PTPTFDPP were designed and synthesized by employing a D–A random copolymer strategy involving 9,9-dihexylfluorene (electron donor) linked to diketopyrrolopyrrole (electron acceptor) and thiophene comonomer (as donor as well as acceptor). Their optical band gap and HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. By changing the nature of thiophene from donor to acceptor state, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and optical band gaps were modified, which varied from 1.75 to 1.65 eV. A series of systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed on model co-polymers to gain insights into the structural, electronic, optical and charge transport properties. The experimental values are in close agreement with calculated electronic properties. Salient findings from both experimental and calculated values indicate that these new polymers can be efficiently exploited for the development of new donor materials for OPV applications.

A revolution in bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ) started after the discovery of photoinduced charge transfer from a conjugated polymer to fullerene on an ultrafast time scale, which enhances the photogeneration of charges to achieve high power efficiency. Today bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the conjugated polymer (electron donor)–fullerene (electron acceptor) system is considered to be one of the promising renewable energy technologies. The attractive advantage of BHJ is the low cost manufacturing of devices via a solution processing technique. Normally, BHJs have an active layer consisting of a bicontinuous interpenetrating network between donor and acceptor for efficient dissociation of excitons at the donor/acceptor interface. It is well known that fullerene acts as a standard n-type acceptor due to its unique properties such as strong electron affinity, good electron mobility, favourable nanophase separation with polymer for efficient excitons dissociation and associated electron transfer in the femtosecond time-scale from polymer. However, synthesizing an ideal donor material is a challenging task because it should balance all other photovoltaic parameters such as open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which are directly proportional to power conversion efficiency (PCE = (Jsc × Voc × FF)/Pin), where Pin is the input light power. Therefore, a conjugated polymer needs the following characteristics to behave as an ideal donor: (i) strong and broad absorption in the visible and near IR-region to harvest more photons from the solar spectrum which increases Jsc; (ii) optimized HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which drive efficient dissociation of excitons at the donor/acceptor interface, which enhances Voc; and (iii) high charge carrier mobility and nanoscale phase separation for avoiding recombination and efficient exciton dissociation, which helps in improving the FF of the device. These requirements facilitate high open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), leading to high power conversion efficiency. Such an ideal donor material can be designed by inserting push–pull (electron rich donor–electron poor acceptor (D–A)) chromophores in a polymer chain. In such a system, intra-molecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor leads the absorption towards the longer wavelength direction; thus, the absorption of the co-polymers is broadened, and in such a system, the HOMO of the polymer is mainly controlled by the donor unit, whereas the LUMO is modulated by the acceptor fragment.

Previous studies revealed that by proper selection of the donor and acceptor unit in a polymer chain, it is easy to fine tune the FMO (HOMO and LUMO) energy levels. Apart from the alternate D–A copolymer, recently a terpolymer strategy was found to be a highly attractive approach for designing an ideal donor material. In this approach, a judicious selection of multiple chromophores in the polymer chain was made, which leads to two distinct absorption bands from two different donor or acceptor units that are in conjugation with another donor or acceptor unit. Among various acceptor units, diketopyrrolopyrrole is a highly attractive molecule due to its well conjugated rigid structure, strong π–π interaction, electron withdrawing lactam group, and absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR), which makes diketopyrrolopyrrole an excellent electron acceptor. One of the possible approaches of obtaining a deep HOMO value is by inserting fluorene into the polymer chain. This is expected to enhance Voc, which is directly related to the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor. Andersson et al. reported various fluorene copolymers with a deep HOMO level and high open circuit voltage. In this investigation, six different random conjugated copolymers using diketopyrrolopyrrole as an electron acceptor with variable thiophene comonomer as the donor and acceptor have been designed and are shown in Fig. 1. Copolymerizing both these units with 9,9-dihexylfluorene using Suzuki coupling offers a new class of conjugated polymers. By systematically varying the thiophene segments (from donor nature to acceptor), the band gap, HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be fine-tuned. The structure–property relation was characterized using cyclic voltammetry, optical absorption and electronic structure calculations. In the literature, numerous quantum-chemical calculations on the co-polymer and small molecule systems have been performed for the donor–acceptor systems. These studies have provided valuable information on the design and development of ideal donor molecules/polymers for BHJs. In this study, both experimental techniques and density functional theory (DFT) based calculations have been carried out on D–A random copolymers based on DPP, fluorene and thiophene building blocks using the B3LYP/6-31G* level to obtain insight into the structural, optical, electronic and charge transport properties of these new polymeric systems.

2-Thiophenecarbonitrile, dimethyl succinate, potassium tert-butoxide, 2-methyl-2-butanol, 3-thiophenecarboxaldehyde, malononitrile, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2-thiopheneacetonitrile, 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene, 5,5′′-dibromo-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene, 2,5-dibromothiophene, 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid bis(1,3-propanediol) ester, aliquat, piperidene, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) were purchased from Aldrich chemical company and used without any further purification. Vibrational spectra were obtained on an ABB MB3000 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were collected using a JEOL GC MATE II instrument. The ion source was operated in the electron ionization mode (EI: 70 eV, 220 °C).


1H and 13C NMR spectra of compounds were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. UV-Visible absorbance study was carried out on a Varian Carey 50 Bio UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses for monomers and polymers were carried out on a Euro Vector S.P.A, Euro EA 3000 CHNS Elemental analyzer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using a CHI 600D electrochemical workstation with a platinum disc electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum wire electrode as the counter electrode. Measurements in cyclic voltammetry were performed by coating a thin layer of polymer on a platinum disc electrode. The CV instrument was calibrated using ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as external standard with a potential of 0.09 eV against (Ag/Ag+) potential.

Density functional theory (DFT) has been extensively applied to predict the geometries and electronic properties of donor–acceptor systems comprised of oligomers and co-polymers. Calculated structures and properties of organic electronic materials in the ground state (S0) with the B3LYP hybrid functional often provide close agreement with crystal geometries when compared to other density functionals. Thus, all the structures in their ground state were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The fully optimized structures were further characterized by harmonic vibrational frequency analysis to ensure that a real local minimum was found without imaginary vibrational frequencies. The solubilising alkyl groups from fluorene and DPP units were modelled as methyl groups due to computational limitations. Using the gas phased optimized ground state geometries, the absorption spectral properties in chloroform (CHCl3) were calculated by employing time dependant density functional theory (TD-DFT) method combined with the polarizable continuum model (PCM) at the B3LYP/6-31G* theory level. The Swizard program was used to evaluate the singly excited state configurations to each electronic transition. All the calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 software package.


All the copolymers were synthesised using Suzuki polycondensation with a 1:1 feed ratio of appropriate dibromo comonomer with an equivalent amount of 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid bis(1,3-propanediol) ester in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) as a catalyst and potassium carbonate as a base in a toluene/water mixture at 90 °C for 2 days. Their synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 1. The actual ratio of the terpolymer was determined by elemental analysis and it agrees well with the molar feed ratio. The detailed procedure is described in the ESI. All the copolymers exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. Gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out to find the weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI) in tetrahydrofuran solution relative to polystyrene standard and the results are tabulated in Table 1. The thermal properties of the polymers were analysed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the results are summarized in Table 1 and presented in Fig. 2. All the polymers showed good thermal stability up to 383–407 °C with 5% weight loss.

The UV-visible absorption spectra for all the copolymers in dilute chloroform solution and also in thin film form are shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding optical parameters are listed in Table 1. It is worth noting that all the copolymers exhibit a red shift in the thin film form when compared to solution, which suggests a strong π–π intermolecular interaction in the thin film form. All the six copolymers exhibit three different absorption bands and the first band appears at 350–550 nm in the short wavelength region. This band corresponds to localized π–π* transitions of the polymer backbone. The second and third bands are observed at 500–800 nm in the long wavelength region, which can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor to acceptor. For polymer PTFDPP, PBTFDPP, and PTTFDPP, the increase in thiophene segment from 1 to 3 results in a red shift as seen in the short wavelength region from 380 to 466 nm due to enhancement in the conjugation in the main chain.

In contrast to those for P1, P2 and P3, the absorption maxima for P4, P5 and P6 systems exhibit blue shifting in both solution and thin film probably due to a highly sterically hindered structure, which affects the planarity of polymer backbone and reduction in the conjugation length. To gain more insights into the excited state properties of the polymers, TD-DFT calculations were performed. Calculated excited-state vertical transition energies, oscillator strengths, and transition electronic configurations are given in Table 2. It can be seen that experimental absorption peaks are well reproduced by the calculations. For all polymer systems, the S0 → S1 transition is primarily a HOMO → LUMO transition (98–99%). All the co-polymers show three optical transitions, one in the range of 362–406 nm, arising from a delocalized π–π* transition in the main chain, and the other two peaks occur in the range between 416–584 and 631–649 nm, originating from a charge transfer state in the D–A segment. After examining the predominant component of the molecular orbitals involved in the pertinent transitions, one can see that lowest singlet S0 → S1 excited state with high-oscillator strength (between 1.3926–2.0018) corresponds predominantly to a transition between the HOMO and the LUMO levels. Other single excitations that contribute to the total excited state wave function involve transitions that are between HOMO to HOMO−1 and HOMO−1 to LUMO and LUMO+1 level.

In order to understand the electrochemical properties of the copolymers, cyclic voltammetry experiments were recorded in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) solution of acetonitrile as a supporting electrolyte. Their HOMO and LUMO energy levels, electrochemical band gap and oxidation, and reduction cycle are displayed in Table 3 and Fig. 4. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the electrochemical band gap (Eecg) of six copolymers were estimated from the first onset oxidation potential (Eox) and the reduction potential (Ered) using the following equation.
HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV)

The HOMO energy level of polymer P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6 were calculated to be −5.65, −5.63, −5.66, −5.55, 5.58 and 5.64 eV, respectively. Compared to polymers P4 and P5, polymers P1, P2, P3 and P6 exhibit deep lying HOMO energy levels, which clearly indicate that the HOMO level of these polymers is primarily determined by the strength of donating thiophene comonomer. Interestingly, the HOMO energy level of P4 and P5 with the electron withdrawing pendant cyano group are lower (∼0.1 eV in HOMO) when compared to its P1, P2, P3 and P4 counterparts. However, there is no significant variation in the LUMO energy level for all the polymers, which clearly indicates the predominant role of DPP in the LUMO energy level. The optimized geometries of the model systems are shown in Fig. S19 (ESI). The HOMO and LUMO energies and HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Eg) are given in Table 3. The calculated values are in good agreement with the experimentally calculated values in this study. For all the polymers, the HOMO values are found to be PTFDPP ∼ PBTFDPP ∼ PTTFDPP > PTPTFDPP > PTCNEFDPP > PTDCNFDPP, and the LUMO values are in the sequence PTFDPP > PBTFDPP > PTTFDPP > PTPTFDPP > PTCNEFDPP > PTDCNFDPP. These results reveal that the electron withdrawing capability of the thiophene unit increases with substitution. As a result, di-cyano-substituted (PTDCNFDPP) thiophene has a lower HOMO–LUMO gap than the others. It is clearly evident that the introduction of a stronger electron-withdrawing group onto the copolymer has a significant influence on reducing the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymer. The pictorial representations of the molecular orbital densities are given in Fig. 5. For all the polymers (except PTCNEFDPP), the HOMO level lies on DPP and the contribution from the fluorene and thiophene are negligible. Therefore, there is a weak electron coupling between the donor (fluorene and thiophene) and acceptor. In the case of PTCNEFDPP, the bonding interaction between the donor and acceptor facilitates the strong electronic coupling between the subunits. Thus, the electron density of the distribution of the HOMO is delocalized over the DPP, fluorene and thiophene units. The electron densities of the LUMO of all the polymers are localized on the DPP unit only, except for PTDCNFDPP. In PTDCNFDPP, the electron density of the LUMO electron is delocalized between DPP, fluorene and substituted thiophene units. However, close analysis of these orbitals reveals that the LUMO is predominantly localized on the dicyano substituted thiophene. As a result, polymer PTDCNFDPP has a clear charge separation when compared to the other polymers.

Previous studies have revealed that the charge mobility of organic molecules can be well described by the incoherent hopping model. In this context, the charge transport is viewed as a charge exchange reaction as follows:

Mn + Mi → Mi + Mn
(1)
where, M
n represents the neutral state of the system and Mi represents the ionic state of the system. The hole/electron transfer rate can be expressed by the standard Marcus–Hush equation as follows:

(2)
where
T is the temperature, λ is the reorganization energy, V is the electronic coupling matrix element (transfer integral) between neighboring molecules in the organic single crystal, h is the Planck constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant. It is evident from eqn (2) that there are two key parameters that determine the charge transfer rate: λ and V. Molecules having a maximum transfer integral with minimum Vab are expected to show optimal transport properties. The total reorganization energy of the molecule is given by the sum of internal and external reorganization energies. The former results from changes in the geometry of individual molecules, whereas the latter from changes in the polarization of the surrounding molecules upon going from the neutral to the charged state and vice versa. As the contribution from intermolecular polarization is expected to be very small in non-polar systems, therefore the main contribution to the total reorganization energy would be from internal reorganization. In this study, the internal reorganization energy (for hole and electron) is calculated by using the following equations:

λ+ = λ1 + λ2
(3)
λ− = λ3 + λ4
(4)
λ1 = E+(M0) − E+(M+) λ3 = E−(M0) − E−(M−)
λ2 = E0(M+) − E0(M0) λ4 = E0(M−) − E0(M0)
where
E0(M0), E+(M+), and E−(M−) denote the total energy of neutral, cationic, and anionic species at their optimized geometries, respectively. E+(M0) and E0(M+) denote the total energy of the cationic and neutral species at their optimized geometry of M0 and M+, respectively. Similarly, E−(M0) and E0(M−) represent the total energy of the anionic and neutral species at the optimized geometry of M0 and M−, respectively. The reorganization energies for electrons (λ−) and holes (λ+) of the molecules were computed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. It is evident from the previous studies that the B3LYP functional with the 6-31G* basis set provides the most reliable results on the reorganization of organic molecules.

The transfer integral Vab represents the strength of electronic coupling between the two adjacent neighboring molecules, a and b. Vab can be calculated based on Koopmans' theorem by assuming that the interacting molecules are identical, symmetrically equivalent and also have the same site energies.
This method has been most frequently used in the literature for estimating transfer integrals in organic semiconductors.
(5)
where
EH/L+1 and EH−1/L are the energies of HOMO/LUMO+1 and HOMO−1/LUMO, respectively, obtained from the closed shell configuration of the neutral state of two stacked molecules. Once the charge transfer rate is obtained by eqn (2), the hopping mobility can be estimated by the Einstein relation, eqn (6).

(6)
where
T is temperature, kB is Boltzmann constant, and D is the diffusion coefficient. The relation between D and kct for a one dimensional system is given by D = l2kct, where l is the space distance between two interacting molecules. The calculated reorganization energy (λ+) values are listed in Table 4. From the table it can be seen that calculated λ+ values for PTFDPP, PBTFDPP, PTTTFDPP, PTCNEFDPP, PTDCNFDPP and PTPTFDPP range from 0.20–0.28 eV, which are comparable to the reported values for donor materials for BHJ in the literature. This finding suggests that these systems are donor materials for BHJs. For the co-polymers, λ+ values decrease in the following order: PTCNEFDPP ∼ PTDCNFDPP > PTFDPP > PTPTFDPP > PBTFDPP > PTTFDPP. This shows that PTTFDPP has good charge transfer property when compared to all other co-polymers. The transfer integral (t) is another key parameter, which is used to characterize transport behavior of the organic molecules. For organic molecules, intermolecular stacking is expected to be dominantly influenced by π−π interactions. Thus, the initial geometry of the two monomers was co-facially stacked at the distance of ∼3.5 Å, and then the structures were further optimized. The optimized structures of the dimers obtained at the M05-2X/6-31G* level of theory are presented in Fig. S20 (ESI). It is evident from the previous reports that accurate prediction of the transfer integral for copolymers is still a challenge from the perspective of theory. Therefore, th and μ values have been qualitatively used for comparison. The charge transfer integrals for hole (th), charge transfer rates (Kh), and hopping mobilities (μ) were calculated using eqn (2)–(4), respectively. The values are listed in Table 4. It can be observed from Table 4 that PTFDPP has the higher inter-molecular hole mobility of 1.84 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison to all the other co-polymers. The calculated hole mobility of all the co-polymers varies from 0.02–1.84 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is akin to previously reported values. Thus, these molecules could be potential candidates for the donor molecules for the BHJs applications.

It is evident from the previous study that exciton binding energy is another key parameter to determine the employability of these molecules in devices. The exciton binding energy and efficiency of the cells are inversely correlated, implying that polymer with a lower exciton binding energy can more efficiently produce electric current from the absorbed photons. The inter-molecular interaction in amorphous organic materials is weak in contrast to inorganic counterparts. As a result, the exciton is a Frenkel type in organic molecules. Thus, to reduce the exciton binding energy, clear separation of HOMO and LUMO is important. Efficient dissociation of excitons at the donor/acceptor interface is enhanced by proper alignment of the energy levels between the donor and acceptor layers in solar cells. The condition for the efficient exciton dissociation to be energetically favourable is Eb, D < EAA − EAD. The EAA and EAD are the electron affinities of the acceptor (PCBM) and donor (co-polymers), which are approximated to the negative LUMO of the acceptor and donor. Here, Eb can be taken as the difference between the electronic and optical band gap energies. The electronic band gap is approximated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO, while the optical gap is taken as the lowest excitation energy obtained from the TD-DFT calculation. The calculated exciton binding energy (Eb) and the difference of electron affinities between the acceptor and donor are listed in Table 5. It can be seen from the Table 5 that all copolymers have a small Eb of about 0.2 eV, which is less than the corresponding difference between the electron affinities of the acceptor and donor. Thus, all the copolymers may have efficient dissociation of excitons at the donor/acceptor interface and the above mentioned discussion is based on PCBM as an acceptor.

In summary, six different copolymers based on fluorene (as donor), DPP (as acceptor) and different thiophene comonomer as donors as well as acceptors have been synthesised. The importance of changing thiophene fragments has also been systematically investigated. It is evident that the substitution of thiophene by a suitable group significantly alters the electrochemical band gap. The electronic structure calculations on these model systems reinforce the same findings. All the copolymer exhibit good thermal behavior between 383 and 407 °C, which ensures the tolerance of thermal stress during device fabrication. A detailed DFT and TD-DFT study was carried out to characterize the structure and electronic properties of the model systems. Based on the Marcus electron transfer theory, the hole transfer rate and hole mobility of the molecules have been obtained. Overall, experimental and DFT results indicate that these molecules can be used for the design and development of donor materials for OPV applications.
