A new low bandgap D–A copolymer PBDFTDTBT containing 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]difuran (BDFT) and 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) units was synthesized and characterized for application as a donor material in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PBDFTDTBT film showed a broad absorption band from 300 nm to around 730 nm in the visible light region and the hole mobility of the blend of PBDFTDTBT and PC71BM reached up to 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1 by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The PSCs based on PBDFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) exhibited a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.0% under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 with a high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.04 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 V.

Over the past few decades, conjugated polymers have attracted significant attention due to their many desirable optoelectronic properties, which have been frequently applied in field effect transistors (FETs), photovoltaic cells (PVs), light-emitting devices (LEDs), etc. Because of their attractive advantages for fabricating light-weight, low-cost, large-area and flexible devices through roll to roll solution processes, considerable efforts have been devoted to bulk heterojunction structures (BHJ) and polymer solar cells (PSCs), as a consequence, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been improved rapidly from below 1% in the 1990s to over 10% recently. As is well known, PSCs are commonly composed of a photoactive blend film of electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives, sandwiched between an ITO positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode. Both the innovation of the material and the optimization of the device structure have played an important role in the exciting progress of PSC. Although the present result is fairly satisfactory, it is still necessary to find ideal conjugated polymers combining high PCE with convenient processability in order to meet the requirements of commercialized applications of PSCs.

Among the various donor monomers utilised, several benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) based conjugated polymers have exhibited some promising properties in optoelectronic devices in recent years. Compared with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), which has been proven to be promising donor unit for high-performance PSC materials, BDF has a similar structure by substituting the furan ring with the thiophene ring. On account of the diameter of the oxygen atom being less than the sulfur atom, BDF-based copolymers can form promoted stacking and a good coplanar conjugated structure. Besides, 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), a well-known building block for donor–acceptor (D–A) photovoltaic copolymers, and its derivatives have been widely used as an excellent acceptor unit for highly efficient PSCs. Our group previously designed and synthesized a conjugated polymer based on alkoxyl-substituted BDF and DTBT, named PBDFDODTBT, which showed promising photovoltaic properties. Furthermore, the introduction of the two-dimensional (2D)-conjugated structure has proven to be an effective way to improve photovoltaic properties, therefore, it is worthwhile and meaningful to introduce the 2D-conjugated structure into BDF-based polymers.
Taking into account all these reasons discussed above, in order to develop new photovoltaic polymers based on the BDF unit and investigate the influence of the 2D-conjugated structure on photovoltaic properties of the BDF-based polymer, we substituted alkoxyl for alkylthienyl in BDF unit, hence, a new D–A copolymer was synthesized by a Stille coupling polymerization reaction, named PBDFTDTBT in Scheme 1. The hole mobility of the blend of PBDFTDTBT and PC71BM reached up to 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1, PSC based on PBDFTDTBT showed a high PCE of 6.0%, therefore we become more firmly believe that the 2D-conjugated BDF unit is also one of the promising donor units.

Furan-3-carboxylic acid, n-BuLi, Pd(PPh3)4 and Sn(CH3)3Cl were obtained from Acros Organics, and they were used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. All other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as ACS-grade quality and used without further purification. 2,6-Bis (trimethyltin)-4,8-bis (2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]difuran (M1) and 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M2) were prepared according to the literature procedures.



1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer in CDCl3 at 293 K; chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard. The number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) of the polymer were measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method, wherein polystyrene was used as a standard by using chloroform as an eluent. TGA was performed on a PE TGA-7 at a heating rate of 20 K min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. For solid state measurements, polymer solution in chloroform was cast on quartz plates. Optical bandgap was calculated from the onset of the absorption band. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) experiments were conducted on a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation using a platinum disk covered by the polymer film, Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl (0.1 M of AgCl in acetonitrile) electrode in an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The morphologies of the blend films of polymer/PC71BM were obtained by using a Veeco's Dimension V atomic force microscopic (AFM) in the tapping mode.


The PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 was purchased from CSG Holding Co. Ltd. (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. The PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Baytron P 4083, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin coated at 3000 rpm for 460 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 120 °C for 20 min in air to give a thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. A blend of the polymer and PC71BM was dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and spin-cast at 3000 rpm for 45 s onto the PEDOT: PSS layer. The substrates were then dried at 70 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the photoactive layer is in the range of 70–100 nm measured by using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A bilayer cathode consisting of Ca (∼20 nm) capped with Al (∼100 nm) was thermally evaporated under a shadow mask with a base pressure of ca. 10−5 Pa. The active area of the PSCs is 4 mm2. Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 67005, 500 W) calibrated by a standard silicon cell. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 236 digital source meter.


The synthesis routes of the monomer and polymer are shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthesis procedures are as follows.


A solution of 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene (1) (2.36 g, 12 mmol) in dry THF (50 mL) was deoxygenated with argon for 15 min, and then n-butyllithium (8.0 mL, 2.4 mol L−1) was added dropwise at 0 °C. After that, the mixture was warmed up to 55 °C and stirred for 2 h. Subsequently, 4,8-dehydrobenzo [l,2-b: 4,5-b′]difuran-4,8-dione (0.76 g, 4 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 55 °C. After the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, a solution of SnCl2·2H2O (9.0 g, 40 mmol) in 10% HCl (15 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 2 h and then poured into ice water. The mixture was extracted by CH2Cl2, washed with water twice and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After the solvent was removed under vacuum, the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, PE) to afford a yellow oil (1.02 g, yield 54%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 7.74 (d, 2H), 7.67 (d, 2H), 7.35 (d, 2H), 6.83 (d, 2H), 2.80 (d, 4H), 1.72 (m, 2H), 1.42–1.24 (br, 16H), 0.92–0.88 (m, 12H). GC-MS: m/z = 547.


Compound 2 (1.09 g, 2 mmol) and 30 mL of dry THF were added into a flask in an inert atmosphere. The solution was cooled down to −78 °C and 3.0 mL of n-butyllithium (7.0 mmol, 2.4 mol L−1) was added dropwise. After being stirred at −78 °C for 1 h, 8 mL of trimethyltin chloride (8.0 mmol, 1 mol L−1) was added in one portion. The cooling bath was removed and the reactant was stirred at room temperature overnight. Finally, it was poured into 100 mL of ice water and extracted by CH2Cl2. The organic layer was washed with water two twice, and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The organic phase was evaporated, and the residue was recrystallized from isopropanol to give the target monomer M1 as a yellow powder (1.1 g, yield 63%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.70 (d, 2H), 7.46 (s, 2H), 6.86 (d, 2H), 2.84 (d, 4H), 1.79–1.29 (m, 18H), 0.88 (t, 12H), 0.47 (s, 18H). GC-MS: m/z = 872.



M1 (0.174 g, 0.2 mmol), M2 (0.143 g, 0.2 mmol) and 12 mL of dry toluene were put into a two-necked flask. The solution was flushed with N2 for 10 min, then Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mg) was added into the flask. The solution was flushed with N2 again for 20 min. The oil bath was heated to 115 °C carefully, and the reactant was stirred for 24 h at this temperature in a N2 atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 100 mL of methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. Finally, a blue solid was obtained (0.122 g, yield 68%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.75–7.32(br, 6H), 7.13–6.73(br, 4H), 4.41–4.00(br, 4H), 3.31–2.76(br, 6H), 2.20–0.63(br, 58H).

The polymer PBDFTDTBT was synthesized from M1 and M2 by using a typical Stille coupling polymerization reaction. The polymer was purified by continuous extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform; the chloroform fraction was recovered. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results (using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent) have shown that PBDFTDTBT has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 12.5 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.27. The GPC data of the copolymer are shown in Table 1.

Thermal stability of the polymer was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in an inert atmosphere. Fig. 1 displays the TGA thermogram of PBDFTDTBT. The thermal data of the copolymer are also summarized in Table 1. The TGA analysis reveals that, under the protection of an inert atmosphere, the onset point of the weight loss (5%) of PBDFTDTBT is ca. 315 °C. Good thermal stability of the resulting copolymer prevents the deformation of the copolymer morphology and the degradation of the polymer active layer at the resulting device operating temperature under the applied electric field.



Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of PBDFTDTBT in CHCl3 solution and in the thin film, and Table 2 lists the related absorption data for comparison. PBDFTDTBT exhibited favorable optical absorption properties. In solution, PBDFTDTBT shows two broad absorption bands with high energy absorption from 300 nm to 500 nm and low energy absorption from 500 nm to 700 nm. The absorption band from 300 nm to 500 nm can be ascribed to the π–π* transition of their main chain units and the absorption band from 500 nm to 700 nm can be attributed to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption of the polymer main chains.

Compared to its absorption in the solution, the maximal absorption peak of the polymer film shows a little red-shift, indicating that the polymer chains have stronger intermolecular interactions in the polymer film than those in solution, because the polymer chains adopt a planar geometry and pack closely in the solid state. The edge of the absorption band for PBDFTDTBT is 730 nm, and the optical bandgap (Eoptg) estimated from the UV-vis absorption onset is 1.70 eV.

We studied the electrochemical properties of PBDFTDTBT by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV), which has been widely employed in investigating the electrochemical behavior of the conjugated polymers and estimate their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials obtained from the cyclic voltammogram correspond to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, respectively. We calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the PBDFTDTBT according to the equations: HOMO = −e(Eoxon + 4.4) (eV) and LUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.4) (eV), where the units of Eoxon and Eredon are V vs. Ag/AgCl. As shown in the cyclic voltammogram of PBDFTDTBT in Fig. 3, the onset reduction and oxidation potentials vs. Ag/AgCl of PBDFTDTBT are −1.29 eV and 0.81 eV, respectively. Hence, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels as well as the electrochemical band gap (EECg) are −3.11 eV, −5.21 eV and 2.10 eV, respectively. According to Bittner and co-workers, the band offset determined by the LUMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor must be greater than the exciton binding energy. The energy offset between PBDFTDTBT and PC71BM is about 0.8 eV which is much larger than 0.4 eV, apparently, it is sufficient to drive charge separation for polymer PBDFTDTBT and it could ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. The related CV data (Eoxon/Eredon, HOMO and LUMO energy levels, EECg) are summarized in Table 2. The electrochemical bandgap is larger than the optical bandgap; this discrepancy might have been induced by the presence of an energy barrier at the interface between the polymer film and the electrode surface.


Besides the absorption and energy levels, the charge carrier transport abilities of conjugated polymers also have great effects on the resulting performance, especially on short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of BHJ solar cells. We measured the hole mobility of PBDFTDTBT blended with PC71BM by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method which is based on the Poole–Frenkel Law with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM(1:1.5, w/w)/Au. SCLC is described by

The results are plotted as ln(Jd3/V2)vs.(V/d)0.5, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, J stands for current density, d is the thickness of the device, and V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential. According to eqn (1), the hole mobility of the blend of PBDFTDTBT and PC71BM is as high as 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1, which implies that the relatively high Jsc and FF could be obtained in the PSCs that will be discussed later. Compared to the corresponding BDT or BDF based copolymers with alkoxyl groups, this kind of BDFT based polymer demonstrated at least one order of magnitude higher hole mobility, which may be due to the introduction of the 2D-conjugated structure.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymer, the BHJ PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. Fig. 5 shows the typical J–V curves of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and the corresponding open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are also summarized in Table 3. The blends of the polymer and PC71BM at different weight ratios of 1:1, 1:1.5, and 1:2 were used to optimize the device performances. For each ratio, we have fabricated five devices with little variations, therefore, herein, we chose the medium values as listed in Table 3. We can see that these BHJ devices with three ratios all show commendable performance, FF of them were all greater than 0.60, the Jsc were higher than 10 mA cm−2, and their Voc were similar and all above 0.75 V. The optimized blend ratio is 1:1.5 between the donor polymer and PC71BM while fabricating BHJ PSCs, which exhibited a promising PCE of 6.0%. The EQE values are above 40% from 450 nm to 650 nm of PBDFTDTBT and the maximum EQE plateau reached 55% between 500 nm and 600 nm, which led to higher Jsc up to 12.04 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6).

Besides absorption, energy levels and charge mobility, the morphology of the active layer is also very important for PSCs. To better explain different photovoltaic properties and determine if the devices were fully optimized, we investigated the morphologies of PBDFTDTBT and PC71BM blend spin-coating from their o-DCB solutions by using tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 7 shows the height and phase images of PBDFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) films.

From the height image (Fig. 7a), the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness value of the blend film is 0.89 nm. The blend forms a very smooth high quality film when spinning-cast from o-DCB solutions. The film is very homogenous with little apparent phase separation and low surface roughness. From the phase image of PBDFTDTBT and the PC71BM blend (Fig. 7b), the connectivity is sensitive to the structures of the polymers. For BHJ PSCs, nanoscale phase separation is a practical way to form a bicontinuous donor–acceptor network. AFM images indicate that the PBDFTDTBT/PC71BM possesses a good morphology for PSCs. From the TEM image (Fig. 7c) of the blend, nanoscale phase separation could be well formed.

In summary, a new D–A copolymer based on a BDFT donor unit and a DTBT acceptor unit, PBDFTDTBT, was synthesized by a Stille coupling polymerization reaction and used as the donor material in PSCs. The polymer film showed a broad absorption band from 300 nm to around 730 nm in the visible light region, with an optical bandgap of 1.70 eV and a medium electrochemical bandgap of 2.10 eV. Besides, the hole mobility of the blend of PBDFTDTBT and PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) is 0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1 by using the SCLC method, which may one of the main motivations of getting relatively high Jsc and FF. The PSCs based on PBDFTDTBT:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) exhibited a promising PCE of 6.0% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a high Jsc of 12.04 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.65, without any device modifications or post treatment. These results indicate that 2D-conjugated PBDFTDTBT is a promising candidate for high-efficiency polymer solar cells.
