Two novel D–A–π–A organic sensitizers (WS-24 and WS-26) incorporating a benzoxadiazole (BOD) unit are synthesized for dye sensitized solar cells. An additional n-hexylthiophene unit is incorporated into WS-26 to decrease unfavourable dye aggregation, thus suppressing charge recombination and increasing the solubility. Incorporating an auxiliary acceptor of benzoxadiazole (BOD) into the π-bridge can red shift absorption bands, and sharply decrease the LUMO level. In virtue of co-sensitization, the WS-26 based DSSC device can achieve photovoltaic efficiency as high as 9.72%.

Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost and easy fabrication since the initial work by Grätzel's group. Sensitizers play an important role and can be divided into two categories: metal complexes and metal-free organic dyes. Until now, ruthenium–polypyridine and zinc–porphyrin based sensitizers have shown champion performances, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) around 11–13%. During the past decades, metal-free organic dyes usually constructed with a donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration have been intensively studied owing to their lower cost, easy purification and higher flexibility in molecular design. For further improving the photovoltaic efficiency, it is necessary to extend and broaden the absorption spectra in D–π–A organic dyes. In this respect, our group has proposed a novel D–A–π–A concept for designing novel organic sensitizers which incorporate an electron-withdrawing group as an auxiliary acceptor into the π bridge. As demonstrated, the additional acceptor not only decreases the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, but also redistributes the charge density across the dye backbone, being capable of facilitating photo-induced charge separation and stabilizing the electron-rich donor (such as the indoline unit). A series of electron-withdrawing building blocks, such as benzothiadiazole (BTD), benzotriazole (BTZ), quinoxaline (QN), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and other units, have been exploited as auxiliary acceptors. For instance, structural engineering on the donor of a quinoxaline based D–A–π–A dye (YA422) in combination with fine device optimization leads to a high efficiency of 10.65%. A systematic study on the π-bridge of DPP based D–A–π–A dyes greatly improves the efficiency up to 10%.

In our previous study, we have found that the absorption spectra of D–A–π–A dyes can regularly shift to long wavelength when increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the auxiliary acceptor. Among benzoheterocycle based auxiliary acceptors, BTD shows higher electron-withdrawing ability than that of BTZ and QN, thus resulting in higher light-harvesting efficiency of BTD-based dyes. According to the knowledge from polymer science, upon exchanging a sulphur atom with an oxygen atom, the resulting benzoxadiazole (BOD) can induce higher electron-withdrawing ability than the BTD unit. In this regard, incorporation of a BOD unit into D–A–π–A based sensitizers should be preferable for light harvesting. Moreover, compared with the BTD unit, the oxygen atom in BOD is expected to have less interaction with I2 and/or I3− ions than the sulphur atom, which is beneficial to retard the electron recombination. However, the sensitizer containing the BOD unit used in DSSCs has rarely been reported.
Herein, we report two BOD based D–A–π–A dyes WS-24 and WS-26 (Fig. 1) bearing furan as the linker, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moiety and indoline as the donor (Scheme 1, and their NMR and MS in the ESI). One more n-hexylthiophene unit was incorporated into WS-26 to decrease unfavourable dye aggregation, thus suppressing charge recombination and increasing the solubility. Interestingly, WS-26 based DSSCs exhibit a 38% increment in power conversion efficiency (PCE) with respect to that of WS-24, which can be rationalized by the longer electron lifetime in the former device. Furthermore, we found that dye WS-26 is more compatible with a known co-sensitizer S1 in a co-sensitization test. After co-sensitization with S1, the PCE of the WS-24 based device slightly decreased from 6.21% to 5.87%, while that of the WS-26 based device increased from 8.61% to 9.72%.


1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. HRMS was performed using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded with a VersaStat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a regular calomel reference electrode in a saturated KCl solution, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in DMF.


Photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves were obtained by illuminating the cell through the FTO substrate from the photoanode side under standard AM 1.5 conditions with a solar simulator (WXS-155S-10). The photocurrent action spectra were measured with a CEP-2000 system (Bunko-Keiki Co. Ltd.).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for DSSCs was performed using a two-electrode system under dark with an electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6e). The spectra were scanned in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz at room temperature under a series of applied bias potentials with a magnitude of the alternative signal of 10 mV and characterized using Z-View software (Solartron Analytical).

A double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode (a 12 μm thick nanoporous layer and a 4 mm thick scattering layer) was prepared by screen printing on a conducting glass substrate following the reported procedure. A dye-loaded TiO2 electrode was dipped in the solution of dye with 3 × 10−4 M concentration in chloroform/methanol (v/v, 4/1) for 12 h, rinsed with ethanol and dried. The co-sensitized cells were prepared by immersing TiO2 films in the solution of WS-24 or WS-26 for 12 h, and then they were immersed into S1 with 3 × 10−4 M concentration in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (v/v, 4/1) for 1 h. The dye-deposited TiO2 film and a platinum-coated conducting glass were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame. In this work, 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in an 85/15 mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile were used as the redox electrolytes.


Bromo-substituted indoline (a) and 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (b) were synthesized according to the established references. 4-Formylfuranboronic acid (c) and 2-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (d) were purchased from J&K Scientific, Ltd. and used as received without further purification. THF was pre-dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled under an argon atmosphere from sodium benzophenone ketyl immediately prior to use. All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were of reagent grade and used without further purification.

After stirring for 2 h at this temperature, B(OCH3)3 (0.7 mL, 6.25 mmol) was added slowly to this solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 4 h, then gradually warmed to room temperature and used for the next Suzuki coupling reaction without purification.

After the solution was heated at 80 °C, the unpurified mixture prepared above was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 8 h. After cooling, water was added and the reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure.

The absorption spectra of two sensitizers in chloroform/methanol mixed solution (v/v = 4/1) and anchored on a transparent TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. As expected, both dyes show typical absorption spectra of D–A–π–A dyes with three characteristic absorption bands in the UV region and visible region, which are different from those of normal D–π–A dyes that always show two absorption bands. Although WS-26 contains one more n-hexylthiophene unit in the π-conjugated system, the two dyes display almost the same maximum absorption wavelength (551 nm vs. 552 nm) as well as threshold. The long wavelength absorption band apparently red-shifted compared to BTD-based dye WS-2 (533 nm) under the same conditions, which should be due to the stronger electron-withdrawing properties of the BOD unit. The main difference in the absorption spectra of WS-24 and WS-26 is the middle absorption band, where the latter shows a 50 nm red shift compared to the former. This phenomenon is consistent with our previous results. The two sensitizers displayed the same trend for the absorption spectra as those in solutions after being anchored onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 film (Fig. 2b). They showed a hypsochromic shift of about 22 nm upon adsorption, which is probably due to the deprotonation of the cyanoacrylic acid group.

To further investigate the electronic properties, their cyclic voltammetry was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell (Fig. 3 and Table 1). WS-24 and WS-26 exhibit similar HOMO levels due to their same donor, which were calculated to be 1.01 V and 0.99 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The driving forces for dye regeneration of WS-24 and WS-26 are around 0.6 eV (0.4 V vs. NHE for the I−/I3− redox couple), ensuring efficient regeneration of the oxidized dyes by I− after electron injection. Correspondingly, calculated from HOMO levels and the optical band gap, the LUMO levels of WS-24 and WS-26 are sharply deepened to −0.78 V and −0.84 V, respectively. Here the driving forces for electron injection from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) of WS-24 and WS-26 are 0.28 eV and 0.34 eV. These driving forces are theoretically sufficient for effective electron injection, assuming that an energy gap of 0.2 eV is indispensable for efficient electron injection.
DSSCs were fabricated according to the literature. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on WS-24 and WS-26 are shown in Fig. 4a, and the detailed parameters are collected in Table 2. For single dye based devices, WS-24 shows a moderate efficiency of 6.21%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.35 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 671 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.693. Compared to previously reported BTD based dye WS-2 (Voc = 661 mV), the Voc of WS-24 is improved in spite of a smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The low Jsc of WS-24 should be attributed to unfavourable dye aggregation. The incorporation of a hexylthiophene into WS-26 greatly decreases the dye aggregation and improves the Jsc and Voc to 17.84 mA cm−2 and 709 mV, respectively, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 8.61%. The improvement of Jsc can be rationalized from the measurement of incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra as shown in Fig. 4b. Both WS-24 and WS-26 show a broad spectral response from 350 to 750 nm, while the plateau of WS-26 is 20% higher than that of WS-24. These results suggest that a structural modification on the π-bridge of BOD based D–A–π–A dyes has significant influence on their performance in DSSCs.

Previously, we have demonstrated an effective co-sensitizer S1 (Fig. 1) for improving the photovoltaic performance of D–A–π–A dyes. On one hand, the intensive absorption of S1 in the blue region of the solar spectrum can compensate the spectra of D–A–π–A dyes, on the other hand, S1 plays a role as a co-adsorbent that suppresses the unfavourable dye aggregation on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2. We also fabricated devices of WS-24 and WS-26 co-sensitized with S1. Intriguingly, we found that co-sensitized dye S1 has a positive effect on WS-26 and a negative effect on WS-24. The co-sensitization of WS-26 with S1 (WS-26/S1) improves the photovoltaic efficiency from 8.61% to 9.72%, with Jsc = 19.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 694 mV, FF = 0.706. The major improvement is in Jsc, which can be manifested by the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4b). The increase across the whole IPCE spectra and the blue-shift of the spectra threshold indicated that S1 mainly decreases the unfavourable dye aggregation of WS-26. In comparison, the co-sensitization of WS-24 with S1 (WS-24/S1) results in an efficiency of 5.87%, which is almost the same as that of the single WS-24 based device. Apparently, the different effect of S1 co-sensitization on dye WS-24 and WS-26 should be related to the π-bridge structures. The unchanged IPCE spectra of WS-24 before and after co-sensitization with S1 indicated that molecular matching is crucial to the co-sensitization strategy.
The Voc values of WS-26 based devices are always higher than that of WS-24 by ∼35 mV whether or not in the presence of co-sensitizers. Since all the devices employ the same electrolyte, the difference of Voc should be attributed to the shift of the electron Fermi level in TiO2, which is related to the conduction band position of TiO2 and the charge recombination rate in the device. The chemical structure of organic dyes on TiO2 can affect both the energy level of TiO2 and charge recombination resistance. To clarify the effect of the π-bridge on Voc, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. At a given voltage, WS-24 and WS-26 exhibited similar chemical capacitance, ruling out the shift of the conduction band (Fig. 5a). Thus the difference in Voc should be attributed to different charge recombination rates in DSSCs, which is characterized by the electron lifetimes (τe). As shown in Fig. 5b, at a fixed voltage, WS-26 showed a longer electron lifetime than that of WS-24, suggesting that the incorporated hexylthiophene unit in the π-conjugated system can reduce the contact between I3− in the electrolyte and the TiO2 electrode, and thus suppressing charge recombination.

In summary, we have synthesized two novel BOD-based D–A–π–A organic sensitizers WS-24 and WS-26 for DSSCs. Compared with the well-known BTD unit, incorporating a stronger auxiliary acceptor of BOD into the π-bridge can further red shift absorption bands, and predominantly deepen the LUMO orbital, especially desirable for improving light-harvesting efficiency. Although WS-24 showed a moderate conversion efficiency of 6.21%, incorporation of a hexylthiophene unit into the π-conjugated system can improve the efficiency of WS-26 by 38.6%, achieving an efficiency of 8.61%. Interestingly, the co-sensitization with a known co-sensitizer S1 showed negative and positive effects on dyes WS-24 and WS-26, respectively. Co-sensitization of WS-26 with S1 (WS-26/S1) manifested an improved efficiency of 9.72%, while co-sensitization of WS-24 with S1 (WS-24/S1) resulted in an inferior efficiency of 5.87%. These results indicate that BOD-based D–A–π–A organic dyes are promising for developing high efficiency DSSCs, and the structure engineering as well as device optimization is crucial to enhance the photovoltaic performances.
