Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made unprecedented progress in the past ten years, the power conversion efficiency of which increased from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.5% in 2020. The choice of hole transport layers (HTLs) is a key factor for achieving efficient and stable PSCs. Recently, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been proven to be the most suitable small molecule HTL material in n–i–p PSCs. However, the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD are dependent on the dopants. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) have become the standard HTL dopants to improve the charge transport properties of n–i–p PSCs. Both of these two dopants are effective but have a negative impact on the device stability (induced by ion migration, hygroscopicity, and corrosiveness). In response, lots of efforts have been devoted to the development of alternative and new dopants. In this review, the influence of different doping strategies and corresponding doping mechanisms on device performance and stability was mainly discussed. The stability issues of doped spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs were also described. Finally, we proposed some possible future research goals for dopants based on these existing results to obtain long-lasting and high-efficiency PSCs.

With the ever-increasing global energy demand, it is imperative to explore green and renewable energy sources. Photovoltaic technology is widely recognized as one of the most promising solutions to bridge the gap between energy supply and demand. To date, crystalline silicon solar cells dominate in large-scale application and industrial production. However, the high material cost and complicated production process make photovoltaic energy conversion contribute only a small percentage to the worldwide power generation. Developing new technology alternatives to silicon is conducive to making solar energy more ubiquitous. Perovskite was discovered in 1839 and now refers to a class of materials with the same crystal structure. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites denoted by the general formula ABX3 (A represents cations, such as methylammonium ‘MA+’, formamidinium ‘FA+’, cesium ‘Cs+’ and rubidium ‘Rb+’; B represents cations, such as lead ‘Pb2+’and tin ‘Sn2+’; X represents anions, such as iodide ‘I−’, bromide ‘Br−’, and chloride ‘Cl−’) have attracted great interest owing to their significant properties, such as long carrier diffusion lengths, long carrier recombination lifetime, high carrier mobility, intense optical absorption and low temperature solution processing. Since the pioneering work reported by Miyasaka and co-workers with an unstable device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% in 2009, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made breakthrough progress over the past decade and a certified record PCE of 25.5% was obtained in 2020.

In general, the mainstream PSCs adopt a perovskite active layer as the light absorber between the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL), forming a sandwich structure. Classified by the device architectures, PSCs can be categorized into mesoporous n–i–p, planar n–i–p (regular) and planar p–i–n (inverted) types, where n, i and p represent the ETL, perovskite layer and HTL, respectively. The inverted planar structure has a longer operating time, while the regular structure has the advantage of obtaining a higher PCE. The holes are extracted from the perovskites and then transported to the electrode through the HTL, which is indispensable in almost all the structures used for PSCs. To achieve a high performance of PSCs, ideal HTL materials should meet the following requirements: (1) the energy levels of HTL materials should match that of perovskites, that is, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of HTL materials should be compatible with the valence band (VB) level of the perovskites; (2) the conductivity and hole mobility of HTL materials are required to be high enough; (3) the photochemical and thermal stability of HTL materials should be high; (4) the production process and cost of HTL materials should try to meet the standards of large-scale application. As a result, exploring or designing an excellent HTL material has been a hot research topic in the field of PSCs.
For regular n–i–p structure PSCs, a large number of organic or inorganic materials have been developed as HTL materials. Among numerous inorganic p-type materials, CuI and CuSCN are commonly utilized as HTL materials. These materials are low in cost and have the desired high hole mobility, whereas the PSCs adopting these inorganic semiconductors as the HTL alone have a relatively low PCE, which is difficult to compare with PSCs based on other materials. Some classical polymer-based HTL materials previously studied in organic photovoltaics are also being exploited in PSCs. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have undergone extensive testing. Recently, a double-layered halide architecture of P3HT-based perovskite solar cells with a certified PCE of over 22% was reported, demonstrating that P3HT is an effective and alternative material. Polytriarylamine (PTAA) has been shown as another potential polymeric material. Seok et al. creatively fabricated mesoscopic PSCs with partially infiltrated PTAA as the HTL and gave a PCE of 12.0%, which is quite valuable at that time. To date, PTAA still holds a very competitive record for high PCE reported for any polymeric HTL. However, polymeric materials often have tedious synthesis and complicated purification processes as well as uncertain molecular weight. PTAA applied as the HTL in regular PSCs usually requires a large molar mass (over 10000 g mol−1), which makes it expensive. The design and optimization of small molecule HTL materials are progressing rapidly. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), a small molecule material, has been widely used as the HTL material in solar cells so far. Spiro-OMeTAD originated from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Burschka et al. used bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) (FK102) co-doped spiro-OMeTAD in solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) and achieved a PCE of 7.2%. In 2012, Park and Grätzel reported a new solid-state solar cell, in which mesoporous TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD were employed as the ETL, light absorber and HTL, respectively. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with a solid-state HTL material effectively improves the device stability. Therefore, a high PCE of 9.7% is achieved along with excellent long-term stability over 500 h. Since then, intensive attention was drawn toward PSCs based on a spiro-OMeTAD HTL and the PCE increased substantially within a few years. Table 1 compares the most efficient devices based on various HTLs, including spiro-OMeTAD, and other typical and dopant-free hole transport materials. The devices employing spiro-OMeTAD show the highest PCE currently although they require dopants.

According to our investigation, spiro-OMeTAD is still the dominant HTL material utilized by the majority of PSCs at the current stage, including the PSCs with ultra-high efficiency. Recently, the devices employing hydrophobic fluorinated analogs of spiro-OMeTAD as HTL materials were reported. The champion PSC had a certified PCE of 24.64% and a Voc near the Shockley–Queisser limit. Spiro-OMeTAD combines the following factors: (1) it has a large band gap (about 3.0 eV) and a relatively deep-lying HOMO energy level, which laid the foundation for aligning well with perovskite layers. And its energy level structure is adjustable. (2) Spiro-OMeTAD has a simple synthesis and solution process. These characteristics are favorable for large area fabrication of rigid and flexible solar cells. (3) The melting temperature of spiro-OMeTAD is high, which provides powerful support for the thermal stability of the device. (4) The pristine spiro-OMeTAD HTL shows a low conductivity and hole mobility. A common method is to use additives such as LiTFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) to enhance the electrical properties of spiro-OMeTAD films. We summarized the PCE versus time for spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs and compared them with PSCs based on the best state-of-the-art HTLs (Fig. 1). Since this small molecule material was used as a HTL in PSCs, most efficiency records are created by spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs (the efficiency records in 2013, 2015 and 2017 were created by PTAA based PSCs). For the above reasons, spiro-OMeTAD based HTLs undoubtedly play an important role in the development of PSCs.

The synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD follows the concept of adding spiro-linked molecules and p-methoxy groups, possessing relatively high glass transition temperature (about 121 °C) and morphological stability while maintaining the desired electronic properties. Although the above-mentioned features of spiro-OMeTAD referred to its different applications in the optoelectronic field, especially in PSCs, there are several limitations to be overcome for lasting development. The most serious issue is the low intrinsic conductivity (6 × 10−5 mS cm−1) and hole mobility (2 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1). The reason for these issues is that spiro-OMeTAD is amorphous, and the distance between molecules in the bulky tridimensional structure is large. The energy level matching of spiro-OMeTAD and perovskites is still a problem worth noting; especially with the development of new perovskites, the mismatch between the HOMO of spiro-OMeTAD and VB maximum of perovskites exists. Consequently, the photo-generated charges will accumulate at the perovskites/HTL interface, leading to the probability enhancement of charge recombination and the decrease of hole injection efficiency. Therefore, the fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) will decrease to different degrees. Moreover, the spiro-OMeTAD morphology is also a key factor for device performance and stability. For example, small molecular species could diffuse through pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD film due to its amorphous properties. O2 molecules go through these pathways and then undergo reversible absorption and diffusion through the iodine vacancies in the perovskite, deprotonating and decomposing MA+ cations. Similarly, H2O molecules pass through these channels and react with perovskites. The reversible hydration between water and perovskites will induce significant structural deformation, until saturation and irreversible decomposition.

Lots of studies are devoted to solving these problems through a variety of strategies. These strategies can be classified into the following types: optimization of the preparation process, interface engineering and introduction of dopants. Among these methods, the optimization of the preparation process is carried out from solvent selection and film preparation. A green solvent tetrahydrofuran combined with dynamic spin-coating approach replaced the conventionally chlorobenzene solvent and typical spin-coating protocol, resulting in an enhanced crystallinity and a high hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD films. However, the universality of this method has not been confirmed. Another versatile approach is interface engineering by introducing a thin organic or inorganic layer. This approach has been proved to be an efficient way of facilitating hole extraction and realizing better energy alignment. For example, NiOx and P3HT have been successfully used at the perovskites/HTL interface. It should be noted that whether this approach will lead to an undesirable reorganization is uncertain. In addition, a double layer HTL with spiro-OMeTAD is able to enhance PSC performance and stability. It was reported that a double layered HTL that contains spiro-OMeTAD and rubrene effectively increased the device PCE from 17.98% to 19.87%, accompanied by an improved stability. Rubrene is a p-type semiconductor with a suitable valence band level. The introduction of rubrene lowered the water wettability and covered the pinholes within the bare spiro-OMeTAD layer. Resultantly, the stability against water ingress was increased and the gold migration was inhibited. But in general, the modification of spiro-OMeTAD may be more expected.
Introducing dopants is to add an impurity into a host material to alter its properties, which has been considered to be the most effective way of increasing the conductivity, adjusting the energy level alignment and improving the film morphology. A lot of efforts have been devoted to this field, and some researchers tried to avoid defects and device instability caused by extrinsic dopants while achieving promising improvement of the performance of spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs. More importantly, it is an essential and valuable project to explore the impact of a doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL on the performance and stability of PSCs. LiTFSI and TBP have been used as dopants for spiro-OMeTAD in most of the studies, but it inevitably causes damage to the device performance and stability. Research on new dopants is ongoing. This review focuses on the research trends regarding dopants for spiro-OMeTAD HTLs applied in regular architecture PSCs. The corresponding doping mechanisms and their relationship with PSC performance/stability are discussed.

According to previous studies, the dopants used for spiro-OMeTAD are diverse. Currently, there is no clear standard for the selection and design of dopants. At least, an ideal dopant should have the following characteristics: (1) it can steadily increase the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD, and its energy level can be adjusted according to the requirement of the device, thereby preparing high-performance PSCs; (2) it should produce as few by-products as possible, or the by-products should not negatively affect the device performance and stability as much as possible; (3) It should have low cost and a simple synthesis process. In this section, we first introduce the classic combinations of LiTFSI and TBP as dopants and explain in detail why they are not the perfect choice for spiro-OMeTAD. Then, we divided the different types of dopants successfully introduced into spiro-OMeTAD into the following categories: metal-based materials, TFSI− anion salts, acids, carbon-based materials and other materials. It should be noted that if no special instructions are given, the dopants discussed are used together with LiTFSI and TBP in spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. 2 shows the different dopants and their effect on the properties of spiro-OMeTAD in regular PSCs. The structure of the ETL/active layer, Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE and stability of the devices employing these dopants are shown in Table 2.

LiTFSI is a popular dopant used in spiro-OMeTAD for PSCs (Fig. 3a). The addition of LiTFSI could increase the mobility of spiro-OMeTAD from 1.6 × 10−4 to 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 significantly, which was calculated by testing sandwich type hole-only diodes with top and bottom Au electrodes. Snaith and Grätzel attributed this improvement to increased disorder and a broadening of the tail of state density. This result enables increased “talk” between deep trap sites and the shift of the mobility edge closer to the quasi-Fermi level for holes. The doping process occurs indirectly and it is non-quantitative. There is a complex reaction pathway involving a two-step redox process where the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD is promoted by LiTFSI, as shown in eqn (1) and (2). In the initial oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD by dioxygen, oxygen radicals could form. Subsequently, these oxygen radicals are removed by LiTFSI. The remaining Li+ cation forms a LixOy species, and the TFSI− anion traps/stabilizes the oxidized spiro-OMeTAD (spiro-OMeTAD˙+).

Spiro-OMeTAD + O2 ⇌ spiro-OMeTAD˙+O2˙−
(1)
Spiro-OMeTAD˙+O2˙− + LiTFSI ⇌ spiro-OMeTAD˙+TFSI− + LixOy
(2)
This reaction is slow and environment dependent, which often takes one night or even longer and is susceptible to water, oxygen, and light. Wang et al. suggested a spectrum-dependent mechanism for the generation of spiro-OMeTAD˙+; in the short wavelength range of 380–450 nm, the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD follows the two-step redox mechanism mentioned above, while in the long wavelength range above 450 nm, perovskites will participate in the reaction, initiating the production of spiro-OMeTAD˙+. Forward et al. reported a spectrophotometric protocol that used spiro-OMeTAD˙˙2+ as a calibration tool to quantify spiro-OMeTAD oxidation by LiTFSI, where spiro-OMeTAD˙˙2+ is a doubly oxidized diradical form of spiro-OMeTAD. The accurate quantitative analysis was completed based on the reaction of spiro-OMeTAD˙˙2+ and spiro-OMeTAD to quantitatively form two equivalents of spiro-OMeTAD˙+, combined with a UV-vis absorptance signal that is only attributed to oxide species. Their report also indicated that the extent of spiro-OMeTAD oxidation changes in response to various environmental factors, and the spiro-OMeTAD˙+ concentration will increase most remarkably in a humid air environment (Fig. 3c). Also, there is a positive correlation between conductivity and spiro-OMeTAD˙+ in the films doped with LiTFSI (Fig. 3d). However, the necessity of such air exposure inevitably leads to contradictions, and the presence of moisture and oxygen accelerates the degradation of perovskite. LiTFSI tends to absorb water from air and aggregate in the spiro-OMeTAD film, affecting the interfacial energy level, adhesion, and morphology. Moreover, Li+ ions in the spiro-OMeTAD layer can migrate across the perovskite layer and accumulate in the ETL, which has an impact on the efficiency, hysteresis, and degradation of PSCs. The factors above fail to meet the performance and stability demands of commercial PSCs.
TBP is a near-ubiquitous dopant, and it was earlier applied in DSSCs to improve the performance of the device (Fig. 3b). In PSCs, TBP is generally used in spiro-OMeTAD with LITFSI. However, the function of TBP is different from its role in DSSCs because there is a thick perovskite layer between the ETL and spiro-OMeTAD. Juarez-Perez et al. performed a series of experiments to determine the role of TBP in spiro-OMeTAD. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy and electrostatic atomic force microscopy (e-AFM) were used to investigate the homogeneity of dopant distribution at the micrometer scale. Their findings revealed that TBP can prevent phase segregation of LiTFSI and spiro-OMeTAD, providing a smoother HTL and a better interfacial contact. Wang et al. first confirmed the role of TBP as a HTL morphology controller in PSCs by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3e). The inhomogeneous regions and the number of pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD layer were reduced. However, TBP was found to corrode the perovskite layer even if it was added into the HTL, because TBP can dissolve PbI2 to form PbI2·xTBP, and then degrade the perovskite. In addition, TBP tends to evaporate over time as the only liquid component in PSCs, which is one of the contributors to the poor device stability. The mechanism of TBP pyridine ring coordination with LiTFSI to form TBP–LiTFSI complexes was discovered in 2018. The formation of complexes not only restricts the hygroscopicity of LiTFSI but also lowers the evaporation speed and corrosive effect of TBP, while maintaining their positive effects in PSCs (Fig. 4a). Unlike the above research, an interesting finding was included in Habisreutinger's report that TBP effectively p-doped the surface region of perovskites, whose interaction made the perovskite/HTL interface become more selective for holes (Fig. 4b).
In summary, LiTFSI and TBP always act as dopants for spiro-OMeTAD together. Although most and even record-breaking PSCs use these two common dopants, the device stability is directly impeded. Further investigation into LiTFSI and TBP with respect to the mechanism and stability is meaningful. We also believe that some new dopants need to be developed as soon as possible.

Since Burschka applied FK102 to p-dope spiro-OMeTAD in DSSCs for the first time, a series of cobalt (Co)-based complexes have been developed as a suitable candidate for p-type doping of HTL materials. The first oxidation potential of spiro-OMeTAD in solution is 0.72 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) compared to the redox potential of 1.06 V for FK102, so there is about 350 mv to sufficiently drive the single-electron oxidation reaction of spiro-OMeTAD. The conductivity increased from 4.4 × 10−5 to 5.3 × 10−4 mS cm−1 when 1.0% FK102 was added. Finally, a record PCE of 7.2% was achieved. Following this work, tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tris-(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209) and bis(2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide) (FK269) were designed to complement the concept of using Co-based complexes as dopants (Fig. 5a). Their ligands and counterions were used to tune the redox potential and solubility. Similarly, FK209 was implemented in PSCs, mixed with LiTFSI and TBP for spiro-OMeTAD doping. Absorption spectra indicated that there was charge transfer interaction between FK209 and spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, FK209 could oxidize spiro-OMeTAD even under dark conditions and FK209 could induce the generation of additional carriers, which led to an increased conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. The addition of FK209 increased the open circuit voltage (Voc) and FF, and a PCE of 10.4% under standard test conditions was achieved.

Tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (MY11), a new Co-based dopant, was developed by coupling the pyrazolyl moiety with a pyrimidine moiety instead of a pyridine moiety (Fig. 5b). MY11 has a deep redox potential of 1.27 V versus NHE, because the introduction of the pyrimidine core induces an effect similar to that of the incorporation of electron-withdrawing groups into the ligand. Spiro-OMeTAD-to-spiro-OMeTAD˙+ conversion was accelerated under this large driving force (Fig. 5c). The amount of dopant used was reduced while maintaining high device efficiency. In 2016, Ye et al. synthesized four types of substituted bipyridine Co-based complexes as dopants and employed dichloroethane and acetylacetone as the spiro-OMeTAD solvent (Fig. 5d). Among these dopants, tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl)-cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide) (t-Bu–Co) effectively improved the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD, which may be due to the generation of some protons by acetylacetone during the photo-induced photochemical reactions. Otherwise, the device based on the H–Co dopant had the lowest PCE of 13.03%, which is attributed to lower conductivity and Co crystallization at the interface during film formation. Nobuko et al. also reported four Co-based complexes Co1, Co2, Co3 and Co4. In their research, bidentate pyrazolyl-pyridine and tridentate pyrazolyl-bipyridine were used to investigate the ligand structure and the substituent effects of the ligands on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Hydrophobic alkyl groups were added to ligands to improve dopant solubility in the spin-coating solution. All these dopants have a suitable redox potential to dope spiro-OMeTAD, thereby improving the conductivity of the film and PCE.
Recently, the influence of FK102 on charge recombination and carrier density in perovskite solar cells was investigated by impedance spectroscopy. The recombination resistance of devices with FK102 is large than that of devices without Co-based dopants, by approximately one order of magnitude. That means, FK102 can significantly suppress the charge recombination at the perovskites/spiro-OMeTAD interface, leading to an improved PSC performance. In addition, the effect of Co-based complexes on the morphology of perovskite films and interfacial recombination has been explored. These Co-based complexes include bis(2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(II/III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide) (CoII/III(dpzpyr)2) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(II/III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (CoII/III(pztbpy)3) (Fig. 5e). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) graphs suggest that LiTFSI + TBP solution deteriorated the perovskite surface morphology, while the incorporation of either CoIII(dpzpyr)2 or CoII(dpzpyr)2 made the surface of the perovskite highly uniform and compact, which might be due to the coordination of Co-dpzpyr complexes with the pyridine ring of TBP (Fig. 5f). Moreover, the perovskite film modified with LiTFSI + TBP solution containing CoIII(dpzpyr)2 or CoII(dpzpyr)2 displayed a longer photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of 2.8 μs than the samples modified with LiTFSI + TBP + CoIII(pztbpy)3 or CoII(pztbpy)3, suggesting that interfacial recombination sites were reduced. The prolonged transient photovoltage decay (TPV) lifetimes also confirmed this conclusion (Fig. 5g and h). Moreover, the HOMO energy level of CoII/III(dpzpyr)2 is negative enough (−5.71 eV) to thermodynamically forbid hole trapping by the reduced form of this complex. To summary, while the Co-based complexes represented by FK209 have become a common type of HTL dopant, the interaction of these dopants with the HTL and the entire device is unclear, and the research focusing on stability is little.

Apart from Co-based complexes, copper (Cu)-based salts and complexes are another class of widely used p-type materials, serving as HTL materials and dopants for PSCs. Herein, we only discuss their role as dopants in spiro-OMeTAD. Cu(II) phthalocyanine (CuPC) is well known to have the characteristics of thermal and chemical stability. Seo et al. used CuPC to dope po-spiro-OMeTAD, a spiro-OMeTAD analogue in which the p-OMe was substituted with o-OMe. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of CuPC is lower than that of po-spiro-OMeTAD and the level offset is high. In this case, there is no electron conduction pathway provided by CuPC, and the electrons captured by CuPC are not allowed to de-trap (Fig. 6a). Charge recombination through the po-spiro-OMeTAD layer is reduced. For the PSCs with CuPC, the average PCE increased by about 1% compared to that for the device without CuPC doping. Similarly, tetra-n-butyl substituted Cu phthalocyanine (CuBuPC) was found to have the effect of trapping back travelling electrons and decreasing electron leak after being incorporated into spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, CuBuPC acted as a structural modifier to improve the film quality of the transport layer, reducing metal penetration and blocking the shunt paths. The efficiency of PSCs was largely improved by introducing 10% CuBuPC into spiro-OMeTAD.

Cuprous iodide (CuI) has been introduced as an oxidizer into PSCs. Under the catalytic effect of LiTFSI, CuI shows a stronger oxidizing ability than FK209, accompanied by a smaller influence on the perovskite film. Cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN) and CuI were reported as the only dopants for spiro-OMeTAD. While improving the film conductivity and hole mobility, the introduction of CuSCN and CuI effectively inhibited the aggregation and crystallization of the organic small molecule film and reduced pinholes and voids. The PSC with 33 mol% CuSCN retains about 60% of its initial PCE even after 180 h degradation under atmospheric storage conditions, room temperature and 25%–30% humidity, which is slightly better than that of the PSC with 32 mol% CuI. In contrast, the device using pure spiro-OMeTAD only keeps 35% of its initial PCE (Fig. 6b). It can be seen that film morphology control has a significant impact on device performance and stability even spiro-OMeTAD is essentially amorphous.
Bis(di-(pyridin-2-yl)methane)copper(II) bis(bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl) imide) (Cu(bpm)2) and bis(2,2′-(chloromethylene)-dipyridine)copper(II) bis(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Cu(bpcm)2) were utilized as p-type dopants for spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs by Chen et al. For the design of the molecular structure, TFSI− counterions make these two Cu(II) complexes easier to dissolve in organic solvents, and the main difference is that a chloride group is introduced onto the Cu(II) ligands for Cu(bpcm)2. Due to the electron-withdrawing effect of chloride, Cu(bpcm)2 has a more negative potential, which provides a driving force of 260 mV for oxidation, far exceeding the driving force of 90 mV for Cu(bpm)2. Tracing the peak change in UV-vis absorption spectra, it can be roughly estimated that the Cu(II)-to-spiro-OMeTAD˙+/2+ conversion yield is 75% for Cu (bpcm)2. The reaction product Cu(I) complex dispersed well in the spiro-OMeTAD solution, resulting in smooth charge transport within the HTL. Although the stability test showed that Cu(bpcm)2, LiTFSI and TBP co-doped spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs only have a small lifetime improvement, and the PSCs containing solely Cu(bpcm)2-doped spiro-OMeTAD sacrificed performance in exchange for good stability, but we believe that this research is meaningful because the oxidation time of the HTL is greatly shortened and the application of Cu-based complexes as HTL dopants is expanded.
In 2018, Zhang et al. presented three copper-based complexes CuII(dpm)2(PF6)2 (JQ1), CuII(dpe)2(PF6)2 (JQ2) and CuII(dmbp)2(PF6)2 (JQ3) as dopants in spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 6c). Hexafluorophosphate (PF6) was selected as the counterions because of its suitability in organometallic synthesis. The spiro-OMeTAD oxidation efficiency of JQ1, JQ2, and JQ3 was estimated to be around 8, 25, and 80%, which is consistent with their redox potentials. Interestingly, when the doping concentration is 3%, JQ3-based PSCs indeed showed a much higher PCE of 18.0% due to the high conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. However, when the doping concentration further increases to 10%, the JQ1-based PSCs delivered a higher PCE of 19.1% compared to JQ2-, JQ3-, and FK209-based devices, although the latter three have higher hole conductivity. The researchers hypothesized that the higher concentration of spiro-OMeTAD˙+ causes more charge recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface and lower Voc. They found that the optimal concentration of spiro-OMeTAD˙+ in the HTL is 1%. To solve this problem, an ultrathin Al2O3 layer (1 nm) was introduced between the perovskite and HTL layers. Al2O3 reduced the possibility of recombination and enhanced the PSC stability by preventing water penetration (Fig. 6d). This article is one of the few studies that focuses on the optimization of the doping level and subsequent radical cation concentration as well as its influence on interface dynamics.
A one-dimensional coordination polymer named Cu-bix ((Cu4I4(mbix))n, mbix = 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-yl-methyl)benzene) was reported to alleviate the LiTFSI aggregation and realize the uniform oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD based on the interaction between Li+ ions and N atoms (Fig. 6e). The inherent fluorescence properties and hydrophobicity of Cu-bix further enhanced the light utilization and device stability. Soon after, two novel Cu-based complexes (Cu–2Cl and Cu–4Cl) were designed and synthesized as efficient p-type dopants of spiro-OMeTAD. While Cu–2Cl and Cu–4Cl have similar molecular fragments, the coordination bonds connecting the two fragments through the Cl atoms in Cu–4Cl are longer than that in Cu–2Cl, making the structural stability worse (Fig. 6f). It was found that Cu–4Cl and TBP can react to generate many atoms and groups to damage the oxidation stability. Therefore, Cu–2Cl is a better choice. The incorporation of Cu–2Cl successfully improved the device performance and stability, which can be attributed to the following factors: Cu–2Cl can control the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD with the synergy of LiTFSI in an inert environment; the interactions between the functional groups in Cu–2Cl and the uncoordinated Pb2+ cations passivate the trap states at the interface; the hydrophobic properties of Cu–2Cl enhanced the humidity stability of the device (Fig. 6g and h). Overall, Cu-based salts and complexes are potential candidates because of their simple preparation, low cost and the possibility to tune chemical and physical properties, and more and more research has paid attention to the stability and lifetime of devices.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials in various fields because of their multidimensional structure, huge surface area, good charge transport capacity, and low cost. For PSCs, MOFs are commonly used to dope ETLs, HTLs and perovskite layers. Li et al. first introduced a three-dimensional metal–organic framework, (In2(phen)3Cl6)·CH3CN·2H2O (In2), into spiro-OMeTAD of PSCs. The In2 molecules are packed via π–π interaction. The van der Waals force between Cl and H strengthens the conjugate system (Fig. 7a). The light utilization of the device doped with In2 has been improved, because the large particles of In2 (100–200 nm) can scatter light from spiro-OMeTAD to perovskites, and the emission wavelength of In2 (453 nm) is almost the same as the excitation wavelength of CH3NH3PbI3 (460 nm), thus enhancing the light absorption of perovskites (Fig. 7b). The observation of the HTL morphology showed that In2 reduced the pinholes of spiro-OMeTAD, which prevented Au from penetrating into the inner space of the device. The stability measurement of PSCs indicated that the device doped with 2 mg In2 retained 78% of its initial PCE after 600 h at room temperature with a humidity of 40–45%, while the reference device only maintained 69% of its initial PCE. The stability enhancement can be ascribed to the increased HTL hydrophobicity. (In0.5K(3-qlc)Cl1.5(H2O)0.5)2n (In10) has been proved to convert ultraviolet into visible light and enhance light scattering, which is similar to In2. Besides, In10 has the capacity of strengthening the conductivity of the HTL by oxidizing spiro-OMeTAD to spiro-OMeTAD˙+. The PSCs based on In10-doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibited over 20% enhancement of PCE compared to the reference PSCs.

Huang et al. recently developed a two-dimensional Pb-MOF hexagon sheet and added it into spiro-OMeTAD. They concluded the model of Pb-MOFs and proposed the growth mechanism of spiro-OMeTAD-MOFs, that is, the Pb-MOF sheets stack along their crystal planes in upper and bottom orientations to form a regular oblique six-sided column, and then Pb-MOFs chemically combine with spiro-OMeTAD, and the column further grows and forms the halo part in the surrounding region (Fig. 7c). Under the chemical combination of Pb-MOFs and spiro-OMeTAD instead of simple physical mixing, the spiro-OMeTAD-MOF layer had a smoother surface and more suitable energy levels (Fig. 7d). The average PCE of spiro-OMeTAD-MOF based PSCs increased from 10.53% to 13.17%. The device stability was improved in a 30% relative humidity (RH) environment.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of compounds that are composed of metal–oxygen-anion clusters, possess strong electron-accepting and oxidation capabilities. For the application of POMs in PSCs, Fan et al. conducted a series of research studies. In 2017, they reported Keggin-type PMo11V as an oxidant for spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs. PMo11V can oxidize spiro-OMeTAD in an inert atmosphere with the synergy of LiTFSI and TBP, thereby improving the conductivity and hole extraction ability of the HTL. In 2019, they synthesized a POM-based material [Cu(phen)2]2[(α-Mo8O26)] (CMP) and introduced it into spiro-OMeTAD. The CMP was synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and the yield was 30.1%. The π–π stacking interactions in its structure are beneficial to charge transport. As a strong electron acceptor, CMP can complete the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD in the absence of oxygen and water. LiTFSI only plays a role of facilitating the reaction in the oxidation process. The resultant enhanced conductivity and charge extraction properties lead to a high device PCE of 18.72%, which is the highest among those of the ever-reported PSCs based on POMs. A stability test was carried out in the dark and air atmosphere with a humidity of 30% and a temperature of 25 °C. The PSCs based on the CMP doped HTL still maintained about 85% of their initial PCE after 27 days (Fig. 7e). A few months after this report was published, Fan et al. synthesized a hybrid POM@MOF material [Cu2(BTC)4/3(H2O)2]6[H3PMo12O40]2 (POM@Cu–BTC) using a self-assembly strategy. POM@Cu–BTC was formed by in situ growth of Cu2(CO2)4 paddle wheel-based MOF confined Keggin-type POM units (Fig. 7f). Similar to previous work, POM@Cu–BTC has the ability to quickly oxidize spiro-OMeTAD, improving the conductivity and hole mobility of the HTL. The device using the POM@Cu–BTC dopant exhibited an excellent PCE of 21.44% without aging. As for the remarkably enhanced stability, they hypothesized that POM@Cu–BTC nanoparticles are encapsulated by hydrophobic spiro-OMeTAD, which can effectively hinder the penetration of water molecules and protect Cu–BTC from the external environment. LiTFSI would enter into the porous architecture and escape from the threat of water penetration under the protection of POM@Cu–BTC coating and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 7g and h). It seems that the combination of POMs and MOFs may be an effective way to produce efficient and stable PSCs. This composite material may have a variety of properties, such as oxidizing spiro-OMeTAD, regulating light absorption and blocking water molecules, but designing and synthesizing it appropriately is a challenge. Moreover, it is not clear whether this composite material will introduce too many by-products.

Molybdenum (Mo)-based dopants are used to dope some organic HTL materials. Molybdenum tris(1-(methoxycarbonyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene) (Mo(tfd-CO2Me)3) and molybdenum tris(1-(trifluoroacetyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene) (Mo(tfd-COCF3)3) have been developed to dope P3HT and PEDOT HTLs. Pellaroque et al. used these two Mo-based dopants to replace the conventional LiTFSI, TBP and FK209 for spiro-OMeTAD doping. The absorption spectra confirmed that spiro-OMeTAD can be oxidized instantly with the Mo(dt)3 dopants (Fig. 8a). The conductivity of the HTL was increased by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to that of pure spiro-OMeTAD. More importantly, only 5 mol% Mo(tfd-COCF3)3 and Mo(tfd-CO2Me)3 doping made the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD doped with 30 mol% LiTFSI/FK209/TBP. The non-encapsulated devices were exposed to 85 °C in the dark at 30%–40% RH for 500 h, and the devices with Mo-based dopants still maintained 70% of their initial PCEs (Fig. 8b).

An iron (Fe)-based cage complex, 1,3,5-tris(5′-methyl-2,2′-bipyridin-5-yl)ethylbenzene Fe(III)-tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Fe(ttb)), was synthesized as a dopant instead of the cobalt complex (Fig. 8c). This complex has a high thermal stability due to a high degree of preorganization and a shielding effect of the ligand cage. The redox potential of Fe(ttb) was determined to be 1.29 V versus NHE, providing a high driving force to p-dope spiro-OMeTAD. Optimized devices based on 5 mol% Fe(ttb) achieved a PCE of 19.5%. It was the first report that a hemi cage structured iron compound was used in PSCs. These Mo-based and Fe-based dopants can successfully replace LiTFSI/FK209/TBP or FK209. Especially the Mo-based dopants achieved the same doping effect as these conventional dopants with a lower doping ratio and improved the stability of the device. However, will Mo and Fe ions migrate like Li+ ions in devices? This issue was not mentioned in the research, which is also the test that all metal-based dopants need to face.
In addition to the metal-based complexes mentioned above, some metal salts, metal oxides and sulfides are also employed as dopants for spiro-OMeTAD. Gu et al. proposed a low-cost inorganic salt FeCl3 as a dopant, which is promising to replace the traditional Co-based complexes. FeCl3 has a redox potential of 0.77 V versus NHE, providing the feasibility for the oxidation reaction of spiro-OMeTAD. The chemical reaction occurred between FeCl3 and spiro-OMeTAD, which was supported by the absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. FeCl3 stabilized the HOMO energy level of spiro-OMeTAD and improved the electrical conductivity. Unfortunately, the PSCs employing FeCl3 as dopants only exhibited over 17% PCE.
KMnO4 was selected as a HTL dopant due to its positive redox potential of MnO4−/Mn2+ (NHE, 1.51 V). The oxidation reaction is shown in eqn (3)
Mn7+ + spiro-OMeTAD → Mn2+ + spiro-OMeTAD˙+
(3)
This reaction can be implemented quickly and sufficiently under the strong driving force, which not only improves the conductivity but also reduces the lack of Li–TFSI and thereby enhances the PSC stability. The resultant Mn2+ can adjust the energy level of the HTL. A high PCE of 20.03% was achieved as a result of the dual functions of KMnO4. V2O5 was proved to have the same effect as KMnO4 after doping in spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, the hysteresis of PSCs was suppressed and the stability was improved. Under the conditions of ambient air with a humidity of about 40% for 30 days and continuous one Sun illumination for 500 h, the V2O5-doped device still retains 90% and 83% of the initial efficiency respectively (Fig. 8d and e).
Besides these metal-based dopants that can effectively complete the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD, much attention has been paid to the interaction between dopants and LiTFSI/TBP. In 2019, Jiang et al. synthesized flower-like MoS2 nanocrystals with a 2H semiconducting phase by the hydrothermal method. They introduced this material into spiro-OMeTAD. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy indicated that there was stable charge transfer between spiro-OMeTAD and MoS2, which led to improved film hole mobility and conductivity (Fig. 8f). The incorporation of MoS2 reduced the pinholes and voids in the HTL by suppressing the aggregation and crystallization of the organic film. MoS2 nanoparticles with a large specific surface area have the ability to absorb Li+ ions in spiro-OMeTAD, alleviating the Li+ ion migration between layers (Fig. 8g). The resulting PSCs delivered a champion PCE of 20.18% with a negligible hysteresis. Benefiting from the reduced water and oxygen intrusion, the device stability has been improved. Non-encapsulated devices (aged for 300 h at 40% humidity at 25 °C) retained 86% of the initial PCE with MoS2-doped HTLs.
PbI2 is a common inorganic salt in PSCs used for perovskite synthesis. In 2020, Liu et al. innovatively applied PbI2 as a dopant in spiro-OMeTAD. PbI2 is able to govern the morphology and microstructure of spiro-OMeTAD. A film with a uniform, dense and smooth surface is obtained. The authors speculated that PbI2 and TBP can interact with each other (Fig. 8h). They utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to find that each Pb atom bonding to five N atoms of TBP has the lowest Gibbs free energy, which means that the PbI2·5TBP structure is most possibly formed (Fig. 8i). XRD and UV-vis spectral measurements are consistent with the theoretical analysis. The addition of PbI2 is conducive to retarding the evaporation of TBP and inhibiting the aggregation of LiTFSI and spiro-OMeTAD. PbI2 also acts as a passivation material at the perovskite/HTL interface to reduce the defect states. The PSC doped with 0.09 wt% PbI2 exhibits a champion PCE of 20.3% with superior photostability and small hysteresis. This work puts forward a new perspective for further screening or design of metal-based dopants to increase PSC performance alongside the lifetime.

A TFSI− anion is composed of disulfonylimide and two trifluoromethyl groups. The anionic charge exhibits good delocalization. The conjugated CF3SO2− groups within TFSI− are strongly electron-withdrawing and linked by S–N–S bonds. The TFSI− anion exhibits remarkable stability with this structure. As a result, a type of material with TFSI− as an anion is used as a dopant to solve the issues of the hygroscopicity of LiTFSI, the necessity of air exposure, and so on.


In 2014, Nguyen et al. combined a spiro-OMeTAD˙2+ cation and TFSI− anion to synthesize 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene di[bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2) (Fig. 9a). There is a comproportionation reaction between spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 and neutral spiro-OMeTAD, and the mechanism is shown in the equation

Spiro-OMeTAD˙2+ + spiro-OMeTAD → 2spiro-OMeTAD˙+
(4)
The corresponding conversion efficiency is close to 100%. The control of the doping amount was realized, and the content of spiro-OMeTAD˙+ in the HTL reached 28% with a desired doping of spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2, which is more practical than Co-based dopants. Unfortunately, the PSCs fabricated with spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 still needed to be exposed to air to get the highest efficiencies of 10%. The removal of LiTFSI led to a stability improvement. After transferring from air to a nitrogen atmosphere, the devices with spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 could retain a stable performance over 10 minutes of operation at AM 1.5G. Afterwards, Tan et al. have made improvements regarding this approach in their work and prepared high-performance PSCs without LiTFSI and air exposure. They reported the influence of spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 on the charge transfer process. For example, a doping ratio exceeding 4 mol% promoted hole extraction and reduced recombination. Long-term stability (continuous illumination, 50 °C and 40% RH) and thermal stability (85 °C, 10% RH) measurements were conducted, and the optimized device maintained more initial efficiency compared to the device without spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 doping after the same period of time. The stability enhancement can be attributed to the better interface morphology and hydrophobicity, as confirmed by SEM, the contact angle, and AFM images (Fig. 9b). On the basis of spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2, Zhang et al. designed and synthesized two organic salts (MeO-TPD)TFSI and (TBD)TFSI for spiro-OMeTAD doping. (MeO-TPD)TFSI was prepared by eliminating one of the fluorene derivatives in the spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 structure with a high yield of 95.4%. (TBD)TFSI was synthesized by replacing the phenyls with methyl groups in the (MeO-TPD)TFSI structure with a yield of 67.2%. (TBD)TFSI was unable to oxidize spiro-OMeTAD as its redox potential is more negative than that of the latter (−0.053 V versus −0.036 V). The conductivity of the HTL increased from 7.77 × 10−7 S cm−1 to 5.24 × 10−6 S cm−1 at the 30% doping ratio of (MeO-TPD)TFSI. The PCE of the device based on this HTL was 18.6%, which is comparable with that of the device based on the LiTFSI/TBP/FK209 co-doped HTL(19.1%). XRD and PCE tracking were performed to define the influence of (MeO-TPD)TFSI on film and device stability. Under ambient conditions, the peak ratio of perovskite to PbI2 was taken as an index, and only 22% of the perovskite was preserved for the reference sample after 60 days, while 65% of the perovskite was kept for the (MeO-TPD)TFSI-doped sample. For PCE tracking, the cells were stored in an environment with 40 ± 10% RH for 30 days. The optimized cells exhibited a 15% reduction in the initial PCE. In contrast, the reference cells demonstrated a rapidly decreasing PCE and even stopped operating after 15 days.
In 2018, Zhang and coworkers first introduced a TFSI salt with tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cations as a substitute for LiTFSI and TBP. Additionally, the other two salts in which TFSI− was replaced with PF6− and BF4− were also studied. These TBA salts dissolve well in chlorobenzene. After the mesoscopic PSC integration, the devices with TBA–TFSI and TBA–PF6 showed superior PCEs of 18.4% and 17.4%, which was much higher than the PCE of the devices with TBA–BF4 (10.2%). The reference PSCs, which were doped with LiTFSI and TBP, showed a PCE of 18.1%. The poor effect of TBA–BF4 may be due to the high charge transport resistance. The samples with a structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD and their corresponding entire devices were heated at 85 °C for 30 min. A pinhole-free form was presented by the HTL doped with TBA–TFSI and TBA–PF6, while lots of large voids emerged in the reference HTL (Fig. 9c). The evaporation of TBP should be responsible for this phenomenon. Accordingly, the environmental and thermal stability of PSCs were tested (Fig. 9d). In the environmental stability test, the non-encapsulated devices were subjected to dark and humid (50% RH) conditions for 1 month. The efficiency loss for the three types of devices (TBA–PF6, TBA–TFSI and LiTFSI/TBP) was 22.86%, 34.46% and 47.67% compared to their initial efficiency. A thermal stability test was performed under humid conditions (50% RH) with continuous heating for 8 h. The TBA–TFSI and TBA–PF6 based devices maintained more than 70% of the initial efficiency, but the reference devices only retained less than 35% of the initial performance.

Ionic liquids have been proven to be a class of effective p-type dopants for small molecule semiconductor materials. For spiro-OMeTAD, Abate et al. investigated the effect and mechanism of three ionic liquids, including bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (H-TFSI), 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonimide (Himi-TFSI), and tetraethyl bis-(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Et4N-TFSI) (Fig. 10a). H-TFSI increased the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD by 3 orders of magnitude, which benefits from its excellent ability to release protons. The detailed doping mechanism was proposed. Based on the interaction of two spiro-OMeTAD molecules, the triphenylamine nitrogen was protonated and formed spiro-OMeTAD–NH+, and then an electron from the neutral spiro-OMeTAD molecule was injected into the protonated molecule, and finally hydrogen gas was released (Fig. 10b). This process was thermally activated, which is different from air exposure for LiTFSI. The PSCs with H-TFSI showed an increased FF while maintaining similar Voc and Jsc to the devices with LiTFSI, which can be explained by the reduction of series resistance.

In 2014, Zhang et al. reported an aprotic ionic liquid with excellent stability, N-butyl-N′-(4-pyridylheptyl)imidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (BuPyIm-TFSI), as a promising dopant to replace LiTFSI (Fig. 10c). BuPyIm-TFSI only decomposes above 300 °C, which is undoubtedly meaningful to the thermal stability of PSCs, but no relevant information was given in the literature. From the design of the molecular structure, BuPyIm-TFSI is a dual functional dopant. On the one hand, the imidazolyl releases protons to increase the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, the pyridyl has an interface passivation effect similar to TBP. The PSC with BuPyIm-TFSI generated a comparable PCE to the conventional device with LiTFSI and TBP. It seems that BuPyIm-TFSI is more suitable as a dopant than LiTFSI, yet its universality needs to be verified. Recently, BuPyIm-TFSI was employed as an effective dopant for N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetraamine (X60), a small molecule material similar to spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 10c). Stability tests were conducted under dark conditions, encapsulated in an ambient environment, 40% RH and encapsulated in the dark, respectively. 93% of the initial PCE is preserved by the BuPyIm-TFSI-doped X60-based PSC, higher than the initial PCE that the PSC doped with LiTFSI and TBP could maintain (70%) (Fig. 10d). Therefore, it can be expected that using BuPyIm-TFSI in spiro-OMeTAD enhances device stability.
1-Butyl-3-methylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMPyTFSI), a hydrophobic and aprotic ionic liquid containing pyridyl groups, was selected as a dopant to increase the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 10e). In contrast to the oxidation mechanism of ionic liquids reported before, the spiro-OMeTAD solution doped with BMPyTFSI required illumination and air to activate and it could not induce oxidation reactions autonomously (Fig. 10f). Tracking of the light absorption signal suggested that photons can induce the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD in an ambient atmosphere. The conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD was improved from 4.9 × 10−8 S cm−1 to 4.4 × 10−6 S cm−1 by 7.8 mol% BMPyTFSI incorporation, which is about two orders of magnitude higher. Pyridyl groups were able to suppress the charge recombination at the interface, which is consistent with the passivation function of BuPyIm-TFSI observed by Zhang et al. The PSC based on this type of spiro-OMeTAD achieved an efficiency slightly lower than that of the traditional device, yet the doping ratio (7.8 mol%) is much lower than that of LiTFSI (50 mol%) and TBP (330 mol%). Device stability was assessed in a dark and 50% RH environment without encapsulation for a long time (over 200 days). After seven months, the efficiency of the PSC containing BMPyTFSI decreased by only 20%, while the control device exhibited a great PCE loss of over 50% (Fig. 10g). The contact angle value for the BMPyTFSI-doped film and the control film was >90° and >78°, which is one of the main reasons for the good device stability.
Geffroy et al. recently synthesized an ionic liquid polymer, poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PVBI–TFSI), and they controlled radical polymerization through reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer. PVBI–TFSI was used as a substitute for LiTFSI to dope spiro-OMeTAD. The conductivity of the HTL increased from 9.4 × 10−8 to 7.8 × 10−5 S cm−1 when the molar equivalence of spiro-OMeTAD, PVBI–TFSI and TBP is 1:1:6.6. Then the conductivity further increased to 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 after a period of illumination. With the assistance of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, they proposed a three-step reaction doping mechanism in the presence of light and TBP (Fig. 10h). First, the imidazolium within PVBI–TFSI forms a hydrogen bond with the triphenylamine nitrogen in spiro-OMeTAD. Second, the imidazolium preferentially interacts with TBP, which may be because PVBI–TBP is more stable than PVBI–spiro-OMeTAD. Third, under prolonged light exposure, a proton transfer occurs to form PVBI carbene and spiro-OMeTAD–NH+. The PVBI–TFSI-doped PSCs exhibited a champion PCE of 20.3%, accompanied by decreased hysteresis and high reproducibility. The assessment of device stability has not been completed.
In summary, both protic ionic liquids and aprotic ionic liquids can increase the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD, although the mechanism is different. More importantly, ionic liquids are a class of competitive materials to LiTFSI. Some ionic liquids with hydrophobic properties are more appropriate for the commercialization of PSCs. What is urgently needed to explore is whether the addition of ionic liquids causes potential damage to the device and the related degradation mechanism.

Great progress has been made in the research of metal cation TFSI− salts. In 2014, Xu et al. investigated the influence of silver bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (AgTFSI) on spiro-OMeTAD as a p-type dopant. 1 mM AgTFSI increased the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD from 9.81 × 10−7 to 2.36 × 10−5 S cm−1. The PSC based on the AgTFSI-doped HTL obtained a higher PCE than the control device (12.0% versus 10.1%). Considering the migration of Ag+ ions in the HTL, AgTFSI does not seem to be a perfect substitute for LiTFSI. Badia synthesized a complex IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)(TFSI) and explored its doping mechanism. Unlike Co(PyPyz)3(TFSI)3 with a similar structure, IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)(TFSI) cannot induce the generation of spiro-OMeTAD˙+, since no characteristic peak was observed in the UV-vis absorption spectrum. The positive effect of IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)(TFSI) on PSC performance was attributed to the suppressed recombination, as evidenced by the impedance spectroscopy. The reference devices, the devices with Co-based dopants, and the devices with IrCp*Cl(PyPyz)(TFSI) were stored under air and dark conditions for three months. The efficiency loss of these devices is 22%, 70% and 4%, respectively.

In 2018, Jeon et al. innovatively used a fullerene cage to encapsulate Li+, forming a lithium-ion-containing fullerene trifluoromethanesulfonylimide salt ((Li+@C60)TFSI−). Fullerene is well known to have good hydrophobicity, which helps to change the hydrophilicity properties of LiTFSI. Electron transfer took place between spiro-OMeTAD and Li+@C60, which does not require the participation of oxygen, as shown in eqn (5).
Spiro-OMeTAD + (Li+@C60)TFSI− ⇌ spiro-OMeTAD˙+TFSI− + (Li+@C60)˙−
(5)
(Li+@C60)˙− is a neutral substance with antioxidant capacity, which can react with O2 or O2˙− to form Li+@C60OxO− (Fig. 11a). Therefore, the long-term stability of PSCs containing (Li+@C60)TFSI− remarkably improved, to about 7-fold that of conventional devices in the MAPbI3 system and 10-fold that of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 system. In an ambient atmosphere of 30 °C and 40% RH, the devices did not show performance loss after 1000 h of continuous illumination. Unfortunately, the PSCs optimized with (Li+@C60)TFSI− have a lower performance than conventional devices, and the initial PCE is only 4% without exposure to light and oxygen.
Zinc bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Zn(TFSI)2) was used to address the issue of ion migration caused by LiTFSI. The reason for choosing Zn2+ ions is that their ion radius is large and the possibility of charge movement is low. With the same concentration of TFSI− anions, the hole mobility of Zn(TFSI)2-doped spiro-OMeTAD (3.83 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) is an order of magnitude higher than that of LiTFSI (3.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The optimized device achieved a higher PCE of 21.52% compared to the control devices (19.48%). Stability measurements were carried out under several different conditions (Fig. 11b). Long-term stability measurement was carried out in a N2 atmosphere, and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The device performance was tracked at the maximum power point (mpp) under continuous illumination of one Sun for 600 h. 100% initial efficiency was retained by the device with Zn(TFSI)2, while the control device retained 80%. Thermal stability measurement was conducted at 50 °C and under light. After 100 h, the device with Zn(TFSI)2 maintained 79% of the initial PCE, but the control device only maintained 45%. The researchers considered that the improved photostability is because Zn2+ ions remain stable in the matrix under illumination. With regard to the enhanced thermal stability, they attributed it to the higher glass transition temperature of the spiro-OMeTAD containing Zn(TFSI)2 (99 °C versus 91 °C). Moreover, the shelf life of the devices was determined in the dark at room temperature. When the environment became humid (RH ≥ 40%), the PSC using LiTFSI lost 58% PCE, while the PSC using Zn(TFSI)2 only lost 17% PCE. Overall, the incorporation of Zn(TFSI)2 has improved the stability of the device in many aspects.
From the report of Seo et al., Zn(TFSI)2 as a dopant of spiro-OMeTAD greatly improved the stability of the device without sacrificing its performance. Saygili et al. investigated the detailed doping mechanism and found that it is completely different from that of LiTFSI. The molar concentrations of spiro-OMeTAD, TFSI− anions and TBP are constant in the experiment. FTIR, 1H NMR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) all suggested that there is an interaction between N atoms within the pyridine ring and Zn cations, forming a complex of Zn(TFSI)2 and TBP. A new mechanism was proposed, which is shown in eqn (6)
Spiro-OMeTAD + Zn(TFSI)2 + mTBP → spiro-OMeTAD˙+TFSI− + (Zn(TBP)m)(TFSI)n + (1 − n)(TFSI−) (m = 1, 2, or 3)
(6)
In DFT the reaction energies were calculated based on different values of m and n and it was found that only under the combined interactions of Zn cations, TFSI anions and TBP can the desired energy be obtained. These interactions include the stereoelectronic effect caused by TBP coordination and electrostatic forces between species, which stabilize the spiro-OMeTAD˙+TFSI− complex and suppress Zn cation migration (Fig. 11c). This novel mechanism allowed Zn(TFSI)2-treated spiro-OMeTAD to be spontaneously doped without the participation of photons and oxygen.
In 2019, Mohanraj et al. doped copper(II) di(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Cu(TFSI)2) into spiro-OMeTAD by a thermal coevaporation method without a solvent. Cu(TFSI)2 can effectively oxidize the HTL through electron transfer between Cu(II) and spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in an increase in the conductivity, from 10−7 S cm−1 to 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1. The dopant was uniformly distributed in the coevaporated film as proved by Raman surface mapping. Upon PSC integration, the device doped with only 4 mol% Cu(TFSI)2 exhibited a best PCE of 13.4%, which is slightly lower than that of the reference device (15.6%), and similar average PCEs were achieved in the doping range of 2–8 mol% (Fig. 11d). Even if the HTL thickness was reduced from 100 nm to 40 nm, the devices can still maintain a considerable efficiency. Furthermore, these optimized PSCs were able to work stably at the maximum power point (MPP) voltage, and the device doped with 7.5 mol% Cu(TFSI)2 maintained 85% of its initial PCE after 218 days (Fig. 11e). In conclusion, this coevaporation doping technique is highly applicable for commercial large-scale PSC production, because it needs a low doping ratio and less raw materials, and a wide dopant concentration window and good device repeatability are offered.
Besides common transition metals, two alkaline-earth bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) salts, Mg(TFSI)2 and Ca(TFSI)2, were added into spiro-OMeTAD as substituents of LiTFSI. The PSCs containing Mg(TFSI)2 and Ca(TFSI)2-doped HTLs exhibited a champion PCE of 18.93% and 18.69%, respectively, which are superior to that of the PSC doped with Li–TFSI (17.67%). Mg(TFSI)2 and Ca(TFSI)2 increased the HTL hole mobility, achieved better energy level matching, and promoted the transfer of holes from the perovskite absorber to spiro-OMeTAD, leading to enhanced device Voc and FF as well as a smaller hysteresis. In stability assessment, PSCs were stored in a humid atmosphere (55%–70% RH) and in the dark. After 193 days, the devices using Mg(TFSI)2 and Ca(TFSI)2 maintained 83% and 76% of their initial PCEs, while the device using LiTFSI maintained 68% (Fig. 11f). The authors utilized FTIR, normalized weight change, XPS and water uptake curves to study the water resistance of these three dopants and their interactions with TBP. They proposed a working mechanism that alkaline-earth-based TFSI− salts suppress the degradation for both the HTL and the perovskite layer (Fig. 11g). In a conventional LiTFSI doping system, TBP evaporates quickly, and LiTFSI tends to aggregate and absorb moisture and creates many voids in spiro-OMeTAD, which in turn causes the degradation of perovskites. Mg(TFSI)2 slows down the evaporation rate of TBP, alleviating the separation of additives. Meanwhile, Mg(TFSI)2 and Ca(TFSI)2 possess excellent hydrophobicity, which remarkably enhances the moisture resistance of the spiro-OMeTAD film. Thermal stability assessment was carried out in a N2 atmosphere at 60 °C and in the dark. After 93 h, the cells employing Mg(TFSI)2, Ca(TFSI)2 and LiTFSI retained 68.8%, 57.2%, and 41.9% of their initial PCEs, respectively. The operational stability was tested in an ambient environment (60 ± 5% RH; 70 ± 2 °C), and the devices were subjected to one Sun illumination at the MPP for 150 min. The LiTFSI-based device showed nearly 70% performance loss, whereas Mg(TFSI)2 and Ca(TFSI)2-based devices only lost nearly 15% and 43% of their initial efficiencies.
Interestingly, there has been no report before on the replacement of Li in the TFSI salt by alkali metal elements of the same family. Recently, Bang et al. used a dopant, sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI), for charge transport layers to address the problem of device degradation caused by the migration of Li+ ions in the HTL to the perovskite layer and aggregation in the TiO2 layer. LiI and NaI were directly added into the perovskite layer to observe the tolerance of PSCs to Na defects and Li defects. Compared with LiI, the performance drop induced by NaI was smaller, and the storage stability of the perovskite film containing NaI was better. The hole mobility and conductivity of NaTFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD were calculated to be 5.42 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 4.54 × 10−4 S cm−1, which are slightly higher than those of LiTFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD (2.45 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 1.59 × 10−4 S cm−1). The PSC where both TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD layers were doped with NaTFSI gave rise to a champion PCE of 22.4%. Humidity stability measurement was carried out under 65% humidity at 25 °C without encapsulation. The device with LiTFSI maintained about 80% of the initial efficiency, while the devices with the NaTFSI-doped HTL maintained 95% of the initial PCE within 24 h (the time required before the device is encapsulated) (Fig. 11h). In another stability assessment, the encapsulated devices were investigated at the MPP under one Sun illumination including UV light. The temperature was basically maintained at 45 °C. The devices with NaTFSI-doped TiO2 preserved over 80% of their initial PCEs after 500 h (Fig. 11h). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) indicated that Na+ ions tend to accumulate in the perovskite layer rather than the TiO2 layer, which has little effect on PSC performance. Although this research did not directly solve the metal ion migration issue of the dopant in spiro-OMeTAD, it designed an ingenious way to improve the device stability without affecting the performance.
Metal cation TFSI− salts are popular because they are expected to replace the conventional LiTFSI to enhance the stability of PSCs, especially Zn(TFSI)2. Zn(TFSI)2 is a low-cost material, and the corresponding PSCs achieve both high performance and excellent stability, and its doping mechanism has been thoroughly studied. Furthermore, the coevaporation doping technique used in the research on Cu(TFSI)2 is promising to be widely applied to these dopants. The current obstacles hindering the large-scale utilization of these metal cation TFSI− salts are mainly the possible ion migration and their potential for reaction with perovskites.

The classification of acids is diverse; here we simply divide acids into Bronsted acids and Lewis acids. In the Bronsted acid–base concept, an acid is defined as a proton (H+ ions) donor. In the definition of a Lewis acid, the proton is replaced by an electron pair, that is, an electron-pair acceptor. It should be noted that some materials mentioned above belong to the category of acids, such as some metal-based complexes and ionic liquids, and we will not repeat them.

In 2016, Li et al. introduced a series of acid dopants with different pKa into spiro-OMeTAD, such as H3PO4, CF3PA, H2SO4, and CH3COOH, and improved its conductivity. The acid doping resulted in increased Voc and FF and reduced hysteresis. The performance enhancement was applicable to a lot of acids (Fig. 12a). The acid alone cannot oxidize spiro-OMeTAD, but when it was used together with LiTFSI/TBP/FK209, the increase in the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD had a greater rate than with LiTFSI alone. The time required for aging to reach optimal conductivity was greatly reduced. Researchers proposed a hypothesis, as shown in eqn (7), that acid doping can promote the reaction between Li+ ions and oxygen radicals. As a result, the equilibrium was shifted and the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD was pushed forward.
(7)
They also proposed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between the acid and spiro-OMeTAD would decrease the recombination losses. Long-term stability measurement was not given. 1-Decyl phosphonic acid (DPA) has the same catalytic effect on the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD in the presence of LiTFSI. TBP was not introduced because the acid–base reaction between TBP and DPA would cause device failure. Sb2S3 extremely thin absorber (ETA) solar cells containing DPA-doped spiro-OMeTAD showed a deterioration of only 10% of the highest PCE after being stored in an ambient atmosphere (20 °C, 50% RH) without encapsulation for 1700 h (Fig. 12b). This approach is also applicable to PSCs, which is using long-chain acids to promote the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD and improve the stability of devices. Guan et al. found that benzoic acid (BA) could react with LiTFSI in spiro-OMeTAD solution to form well dispersed LiBA. The H+ ions released in the reaction accelerated the oxidation process. The formation of LiBA would cause some particles to appear in the film. Interestingly, the morphology of spiro-OMeTAD was better because the size of hollows was reduced. When the doping concentration of BA is 3 mol%, the defects and recombination in the HTL are reduced to the greatest extent and the hole transport properties are optimized. The resultant champion device PCE is 16.26%.
SnCl4, a typical Lewis acid, has an unoccupied d orbital to accept electrons. It has been employed as an electron acceptor in spiro-OMeTAD. The large enough oxidation potential (1.10 V versus NHE) of SnCl4 supplied the driving force for the electron transfer from spiro-OMeTAD to the dopant. The oxidation process did not require oxygen. The p-type doping of SnCl4 induced the Fermi level (Ef) to shift toward the HOMO in the HTL, which facilitated the formation of ohmic contacts (Fig. 12c). The same phenomenon was observed when LiTFSI was used as the dopant. However, the performance of SnCl4-doped devices alone was very poor, because Li+ ions could accelerate the electron injection and extend the life of the injected electrons in the system of TiO2/dye/HTL. As for PSCs, what role SnCl4 plays has not yet been explored.
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) is a strong π-electron acceptor material and acts as a Lewis acid in spiro-OMeTAD for p-type doping, as reported by Ye et al. (Fig. 12d). UV-vis and ESR spectra verified that BCF has the ability to oxidize spiro-OMeTAD and generate spiro-OMeTAD˙+ without LiTFSI. Additionally, there is no peak for the adduct of BCF and spiro-OMeTAD in the spectra. It can be speculated that the ground-state integer charge-transfer between BCF and spiro-OMeTAD rather than the formation of a complex is the main mechanism in this research. Although the BCF doping did improve the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD by one order of magnitude, the corresponding PSCs showed an unsatisfactory performance. With the assistance of LiTFSI and TBP, improved Voc, Jsc and FF were obtained, which indicates that BCF possesses excellent oxidizing ability but it cannot completely keep spiro-OMeTAD˙+ in a stable state (Fig. 12e). The same doping strategy was proposed by Liu et al. recently, and some dopants with a similar molecule structure such as triphenylborane (TPB) and tris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphine (TPFP) were explored (Fig. 12f). In their research, a considerable PCE of 20.1% was obtained for the PSC with a TPFB (the abbreviation of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane in their paper is the same as BCF) doping concentration of 12 mol%, which is due to the adjusted Ef and reduced recombination. The long-term device stability was examined in an ambient environment (20–35% RH) at room temperature. The unsealed TPFB-doped PSCs lost 15% of their initial efficiency, whereas the unsealed LiTFSI-doped PSCs lost 25% under the same conditions (Fig. 12g). The difference may have originated from the pinholes induced by LiTFSI and the influence of the two dopants on the hydrophobicity of spiro-OMeTAD. The thermal stability of these PSCs was determined at 85 °C. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of quick device degradation for both doping strategies was observed (Fig. 12g). Additionally, it was found that TPB was unable to effectively dope spiro-OMeTAD and TPFP was an inefficient dopant. The explanation of Liu et al. was that fluorine atoms enhance the local electrostatic potential of benzene rings, which in turn promotes the reaction between TPFB as a Lewis acid and Lewis base spiro-OMeTAD, as proved by DFT simulations.
In a word, both Lewis acids and Bronsted acids can improve the performance of PSCs, provided that these acids are co-doped with LiTFSI in spiro-OMeTAD, yet this is also a difficult restriction to break. Currently, there is little known about the impact of the by-products generated in the reaction on the device performance, and the effect of acid doping on PSC stability is rarely mentioned. The replacement of LiTFSI or molecular structure design for acid dopants may be the solution.

Carbon (C)-based materials have been used in the functional layers or as interface modifiers in PSCs due to their low cost, abundance, high conductivity, hydrophobicity and chemical stability. Here we still focus on their application as spiro-OMeTAD dopants. Some C-based materials may be more suitable to be called additives, and we will include them in the discussion. To the best of our knowledge, the earliest related report was to embed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) into spiro-OMeTAD. MWNTs have a high carrier concentration (1.94 × 1019 cm−3) and mobility (220 cm2 V−1 s−1), which, in turn, enhance both the carrier concentration and mobility of the HTL. A pure spiro-OMeTAD layer was introduced to form a hierarchical structure, thus solving the undesirable back-electron transfer issue caused by the difference between the work function of MWNTs (−4.6 eV) and the LUMO level of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.9 eV) (Fig. 13a). Finally, the device PCE increases from 12.8% to 15.1%. Then acid-treated MWCNTs were reported as a HTL dopant to optimize PSCs, which mainly originated from its good dispersibility and the p–p interaction between the –COOH group and spiro-OMeTAD.

In 2016, Miletić et al. prepared a new class of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (f-SWCNTs) and introduced into spiro-OMeTAD. Oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) bearing alkoxy groups in the central ring and amine residues at the extremities was selected for design (Fig. 13b). The polar amine moiety improved the compatibility between f-SWCNTs and spiro-OMeTAD, and enhanced the affinity of the hole transport material towards perovskites. The OPV functionalization induced SWCNTs to disperse well within the HTL. As a result, a homogeneous HTL morphology was obtained. More importantly, the PbI2 peak in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra indicated that the device doped with f-SWCNTs has a negligible degree of decomposition in a specific environment (ambient air ≈ 70% RH; room temperature = 25 ± 1 °C), and the efficiency of these devices was very close to that of the device doped with LiTFSI and TBP (Fig. 13c). In addition to the CNTs mentioned above, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was added into a Li–TFSI-based spiro-OMeTAD HTL. Besides the good conductivity, rGO provided adsorption sites for Li+ ions, which restrained the water-uptake effect of LiTFSI and reduced the pinholes resulting from Li+ ion migration (Fig. 13d). Both device performance and stability were enhanced (Fig. 13e).
In general, the utilization of C-based materials is a promising doping strategy as it improves the device stability to a large extent, but the relevant research is rare. This may be because the interaction between the dopants and spiro-OMeTAD is not yet clear or lowering of efficiency as a tradeoff for stability gains.

In addition to the dopant categories mentioned above, there are some noteworthy materials used to dope spiro-OMeTAD. In 2016, Shirahata et al. selected three materials polysilane poly(methyl phenylsilane) (PMPS), dimethylpolysilane (DMPS) and decaphenylcyclopentasilane (DPPS) as dopants (Fig. 14a). They attributed the improvement of photovoltaic performance to two possibilities, an aligned energy level and increased hole mobility resulting from synergistic effects between polysilanes and spiro-OMeTAD. The molecular structure of these polysilanes seemed to be another important factor, while the detailed mechanism was not given.

Deng et al. synthesized Li(Gd,Y)F4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals by a thermal decomposition method and embedded them into spiro-OMeTAD. Li(Gd,Y)F4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals are an upconversion (UC) material with a single tetragonal-phase. The UC nanocrystals excited with a 980 nm diode laser can present strong and pure green luminescence at room temperature as well as a high UC quantum yield, which is suitable to enhance the light usage of PSCs, that is, the utilization of near infrared light (NIR) and extension of the absorption wavelength range. The current density–voltage (J–V) and photocurrent density–time (J–t) characteristics of the PSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with or without a 980 nm laser (Fig. 14b and c). Li(Gd,Y)F4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals up-converted the NIR radiation into visible photons and reflected them back to the perovskite absorber, thus enhancing the photocurrent density. Furthermore, these UC nanocrystals with an optimized doping level increased the light harvesting within the visible range because of the light scattering or reflecting properties. The hole extraction capability and the conductivity of the HTL were proved to be improved. The average PCE of the PSC doped with Li(Gd,Y)F4:Yb3+,Er3+ UC nanocrystals was 18.34%, 25% higher than that of conventional spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs. Soon after, Cu9S5@SiO2 supraparticles (SUPs) were reported to have similar mechanisms on PSCs by this group, but the origin of these mechanisms is different. The localized surface plasmon resonance of multiple Cu9S5 nanoparticles made the scattering efficiency of Cu9S5@SiO2 SUPs peak at 1240 nm. This strong scattering prolonged the light path in the PSC, enhancing its light absorption and photocurrent. The 2.3-fold increased conductivity and 1.6-fold increased hole injection efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD derived from possible higher-order interactions and tunneling between the Cu9S5 nanocrystals in the SUPs. Resultantly, the PSC incorporated with appropriate Cu9S5@SiO2 SUPs showed a promoted PCE from 14.38% to 18.21%. Unlike most of the references, these two studies focus on the optical management of cells. The utilization of dopants into HTLs to enhance the light absorption of perovskite is worth investigating.
2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is a strong electron acceptor material (Fig. 14d). It was applied to dope spiro-OMeTAD in ssDSSCs, facilitating charge transport and forming a good interfacial contact. In 2015, Jung et al. prepared a triple HTL consisting of n-type doped, intrinsic, and p-type doped spiro-OMeTAD by vacuum evaporation. The n-type and p-type dopants were decamethylcobaltocene (DMC) and F4TCNQ, respectively. Optimized doping concentration made the energy levels more matched, which in turn promoted hole extraction (Fig. 14e). Stability measurements were conducted in air and in a high vacuum (10−6 torr) for 890 h (Fig. 14f). The control samples showed a PCE drop of 50% in air and 60% in a vacuum. Interestingly, the samples with the triple HTL exhibited a PCE increment after 840 h especially under air conditions. This phenomenon can be explained by the redistribution of dopants. Huang and coworkers investigated the role of F4TCNQ as a dopant in solution-processed spiro-OMeTAD. The electron transfer between spiro-OMeTAD and F4TCNQ resulted in a higher film conductivity (Fig. 14g), which is illustrated in eqn (8)
F4TCNQ·spiro-OMeTAD + hν → F4TCNQ− + spiro-OMeTAD˙+
(8)
When the doping ratio of F4TCNQ was 1.5 mol%, the PSC achieved a PCE of 10.59%, which was somewhat lower than that of the PSC with LiTFSI and TBP co-doped spiro-OMeTAD. In a humid atmosphere (40–50% RH), the devices with LiTFSI/TBP and F4TCNQ and without doping retained less than 20% and 65–85% of the initial PCEs, respectively. After 7 days, the former devices only retained 10–15% of the initial PCE, while the latter two devices retained 55–60%, demonstrating that F4TCNQ is non-hygroscopic and reduces the damage caused by LiTFSI and TBP to the device (Fig. 14h). Luo et al. reported passivated traps, reduced hysteresis, and improved stability by F4TCNQ doping in solution-prepared devices. Halogen bonding was easy to form between F4TCNQ and halide ions in perovskites, passivating the traps and hence reducing the hysteresis. The hysteresis index (HI) values calculated at scan rates of 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 V s−1 for the PSC involving 1.5 mol% F4TCNQ-doped spiro-OMeTAD (0.24, 0.21 and 0.18) are all smaller than those of the control PSC (0.52, 0.44 and 0.40). The prepared PSCs were stored under dark and dry conditions (10–15% RH) for 1000 h without encapsulation. 90% of the initial PCE was retained by the PSC with F4TCNQ, whereas only 31% of the initial PCE was maintained by the control PSC (Fig. 14i and j). In summary, F4TCNQ is a kind of potential dopant as it is non-hygroscopic and can be integrated into PSCs through a vacuum or solution process, although from the above reports, the corresponding device efficiency is relatively low.
In 2018, protonated 1-adamantylammonium halide derivatives (ADAHX) were synthesized and added to the solution of the HTL. It was found that ADAHI is able to passivate electronic defect states at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, thereby reducing non-radiative carrier recombination. As a result, the triple A-cation perovskite solar cell doped with ADAHI showed a high PCE of 21.9%. Especially, ADAHI doping yielded an excellent device Voc of 1.245 V. Device stability tests were performed under continuous light illumination and maximum power point tracking (room temperature, N2). The reference device showed 18% PCE loss, whereas the device with ADAHI doping only showed a negligibly small PCE loss. In another example, Yuan et al. selected I2 molecules as a Lewis acid, oxidant and p-type dopant for spiro-OMeTAD. They performed a series of measurements and interpreted the role of I2 in tuning energy matching, reducing recombination, increasing conductivity, and improving carrier transport capability. The PSC based on 8 wt% I2-doped spiro-OMeTAD gave a best PCE of 19.69%, and it retained 87.3% of its original PCE under ambient conditions (35 ± 5% RH and 25 ± 5 °C) after 23 days. Nevertheless, the precise doping mechanism is unknown. The interaction between I2 and spiro-OMeTAD remains to be explored.
A new dopant, PFPPY, was developed by Sathiyan et al. (Fig. 14k). The synthesis was completed using cheap 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroaniline, 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate as raw materials through a simple one-step reaction. Upon PFPPY addition, spiro-OMeTAD was oxidized effectively, leading to an increased conductivity and hole mobility. A high conductivity of 1.61 × 10−4 S cm−1 and hole mobility of 2.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for the 15% PFPPY-doped HTL, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of the LiTFSI/TBP/FK209 co-doped HTL (2.73 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 4.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Similar to TBP, the pyridine unit in PFPPY could interact with LiTFSI to suppress its aggregation, which is conducive to the formation of a good HTL morphology. Better charge transport and less recombination loss were also observed after PFPPY doping. Consequently, the PSC adopting 15% PFPPY showed an impressive PCE of 21.38%, higher than the PCE of 19.6% for the control PSC. The unencapsulated device (stored over 600 h at 40–50% RH) lost about 10% of its initial performance with PFPPY, while the control device lost about 46% of the original PCE (Fig. 14l). The operational stability of the device was measured near the MPP under one Sun illumination for 120 h. The 15% PFPPY based device and control device retained 83% and 49% of their original performance, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest device efficiencies that can be achieved by dopants based on molecular design and synthesis strategies, accompanied by impressive stability.

While spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs have excelled in efficiency, their stability is far from meeting commercial requirements. Compared with PCE, the advance in stability is slower and more complicated. The device stability involves many factors; here we focus on the issues caused by doped spiro-OMeTAD. As discussed previously, the morphology of spiro-OMeTAD has a significant effect on PSC stability. Hawash revealed the presence of pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD film by microscopy techniques. These pinholes create pathways for gas molecules or mobile ions, which lead to device degradation. The thermal stability of spiro-OMeTAD is directly related to device degradation. Pristine spiro-OMeTAD has a high glass transition temperature. However, the incorporation of LiTFSI and TBP lowers this value to about 50 °C, which is correlated with device damage in a high temperature environment. Researchers have reported the crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD at 60 °C and 85 °C. These crystal domains undoubtedly affect the perovskite/HTL interface properties. In addition to the impact on the thermal stability of spiro-OMeTAD, the introduction of dopants brings about other unpredictable stability problems. LiTFSI is hygroscopic and tends to become liquid in a humid environment. TBP can corrode the perovskites and evaporate at low temperature.

Another issue is the ion migration in the device. As a small molecule material, spiro-OMeTAD is tolerant to ion migration, and the pinholes in the film provide a way for ions to diffuse. The ionic nature of perovskite allows its intrinsic ions to migrate to the ETL or HTL, and metal can migrate from the electrode to perovskites under the effect of an electric field and heat. For dopants in spiro-OMeTAD, Li+ ions easily migrate in the direction of perovskites and the ETL. Other ions from dopants also have the possibility of migration, although the related reports are rare. Some research indicates that ion migration is one of the sources of hysteresis. In summary, ion migration has a significant impact on the device performance and stability.
Passivation strategy is one of the most effective ways to solve the above problems in spiro-OMeTAD based devices. This strategy usually works on the following aspects, involving interfacial defects and traps passivation, energy level alignment, perovskites crystallization control, ion migration, film morphology and external environment contact. Inorganic CsPbBr1.85I1.15 quantum dots were employed at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface to passivate defects, which significantly suppressed interfacial recombination and increased the Voc of triple-cation PSCs by 50 mV. The perovskite QD inter layer improved the good moisture resistance and suppressed ion migration, thereby enhancing the operating stability of passivated PSCs and eliminating device hysteresis. Low-dimensional perovskite layers have been used for interface passivation. For example, 5-AVAI, FEA and EAI reacted with the perovskite surface to form low-dimensional passivation layers. These low-dimensional passivation layers were able to passivate trap states, enhance the hole extraction efficiency, prevent the diffusion of HTL additives and metal, and isolate moisture from the outside. Recently, Akman et al. reported that polyTPD was used between perovskites and spiro-OMeTAD as an interfacial passivation material. PolyTPD not only led to a good level alignment, but also modulated trap states at the interface. Meanwhile, polyTPD could protect perovskites from degradation agents.
Some new dopants for spiro-OMeTAD also have the passivation effect, such as, Cu–2Cl, BuPyIm-TFSI, and F4TCNQ. In fact, there has been a lot of work devoted to improving device stability by introducing suitable new dopants, as mentioned in section 3. In order to intuitively compare device stability under the same conditions, the dopant and corresponding device structure under light with different PCE losses and aging times are summarized in Table 3. The PSCs employing (Li+@C60)TFSI−/TBP doped spiro-OMeTAD with a device structure of C60/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTL/Au show an excellent stability. The PCE loss is almost negligible after 1000 h of continuous illumination under the conditions of 30 °C and 40% RH, which is because C60 is used as an ETL and a part of the dopant. In a N2 environment, the device lifetime can be extended. The PSCs using Zn(TFSI)2 and ADAHI as new dopants almost have no performance loss after 600 h and 500 h under continuous light illumination at the mpp. Besides, if the influence of heat is considered, it is difficult to directly compare the stability of the device structure and dopant, because the test temperature is different. It seems that spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 and NaTFSI are good choices.

Even if the research on improving the stability by new dopants progresses rapidly, it is unknown whether these dopants themselves will cause new stability issues. We notice that in the stability tests of some studies, spiro-OMeTAD will be replaced with PTAA, because the latter is more stable than the former. Research on the dopant-free transport layer is ongoing. The PSCs with a structure of c-TiO2/m-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05/WBH/P3HT/Au show substantial long-term stability and only lose less than 5% of their initial PCE after 1370 h under continuous 1 Sun illumination at the mpp. CuPC, OMe-TPA–CuPc, CuSCN, and Cu2O serving as HTLs improve the device stability compared with doped spiro-OMeTAD. When dopant-free CuSCN and DTB based PSCs are stored in ambient air, these devices retain over 90% of their initial PCE after 60 days. Some dopant-free HTLs obtained through molecular design and synthesis, for example, alkoxy-PTEG and MeOTTVT, make integrated PSCs obtain much higher stability than spiro-OMeTAD while maintaining high efficiency.
In general, improving the stability of spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs is an urgent problem to be solved. It is expected that the stability of this type of PSC cannot be competitive with the stability of commercial mainstream solar cells, crystalline silicon solar cells at this stage. The development and utilization of dopant-free HTLs is an effective strategy, but we hold the view that the research on spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs is worthwhile because they are able to achieve the highest efficiency.

To achieve high-performance PSCs, it is essential to choose a suitable HTL material. In recent years, regular PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD HTLs have obtained outstanding achievement, especially setting an efficiency record of 25.5% in 2020. However, pristine spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low intrinsic conductivity and hole mobility as a typical small molecule material. A series of doping materials and techniques have been employed to solve this notorious problem. Doping LiTFSI and TBP into spiro-OMeTAD solution is the most common strategy, which has become the basic system for efficient PSCs. Unfortunately, considering the interaction between the functional layers in PSCs and the stability demand for device commercialization, LiTFSI and TBP are not the most ideal dopants, for example, LiTFSI is hygroscopic and tends to aggregate in the HTL and TBP easily evaporates and corrodes the perovskite absorber. In this review, we summarized the progress of dopants (including LiTFSI and TBP) for spiro-OMeTAD HTLs in regular PSCs. These alternative dopants are developed either to directly replace LiTFSI/TBP/FK209 or to make up for the shortcomings of this traditional doping system. Their influence is reflected in many aspects: (1) conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD; (2) energy level matching between the perovskite layer and HTL; (3) charge transport, extraction and recombination; (4) film morphology and interfacial contact; (5) film resistance to water and oxygen; (6) ion migration in the device; (7) optical management. Then, we discussed the stability of doped spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs.

Although the research involved in the review has reported the improvement of device performance and stability after the use of dopants, all doping strategies have their drawbacks, even some of which may be impossible to overcome. A key issue is that lots of dopants mentioned here are applied in spiro-OMeTAD together with LiTFSI and TBP. In this case, the problems suffered by the devices have not been fundamentally solved. For these different doping strategies, it is not feasible to directly compare their efficacies because the device systems and conditions are different, while we still select several potential dopant categories which we think are worthy of further research. In the category of TFSI− anion salts, spiro-OMeTAD(TFSI)2 eliminates the influence of metal ions and reaction by-products on the HTL, while reducing the damage caused by air and humidity to the device; hydrophobic ionic liquids could replace the conventional alkali metal ion salt, which is expected to promote the commercial development of PSCs, yet this system is still degraded under unknown mechanisms; Zn(TFSI)2 doping not only significantly improves the PCE of PSCs, achieving an ultra-high efficiency of 21.52% in 2018, but also enhances the resistance of the device to humidity, light and high temperature. Nevertheless, these dopants containing metal ions must address the possible ion migration problem and obtain longer-term stability. Moreover, C-based materials are a promising class of dopants because of their outstanding chemical stability and hydrophobicity, although the efficiency of the corresponding devices is obviously lower than that of conventional devices. For C-based dopants, reasonable design and functionalization as well as in-depth mechanism exploration are needed.
There is no doubt that a flawless dopant for spiro-OMeTAD is difficult to obtain, since there are various demands that need to be considered. Therefore, research is continued to explore new doping strategies to facilitate the large-scale commercialization of PSCs. The studies may focus on the following in the future. First, the accurate quantification of doping is worthwhile. Many dopants can directly complete or assist the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD to promote charge transport in the device. Involving the complex reaction (multi-step reaction, reversible reaction, etc.) and limited measuring method, it is not easy to quantify the doping precisely and quickly. If this issue can be resolved, it will help to achieve high efficiency at low doping ratios. Meanwhile, it meets the repeatability standard and process model of industrial production. Second, we call for a deeper understanding of the doping mechanism, including the mechanisms for device stability enhancement and device degradation. Especially the doping-induced degradation mechanism, which is rarely mentioned in the report. An increased understanding of these mechanisms is conducive to selecting and designing effective dopants, rather than simply relying on their material characteristics. Researchers can solve some issues based on these studies, for example, design the corresponding solutions for the degradation pathways, which may include dopant diffusion under an electric field or heat induction, the reaction between the dopant and functional layer material, and so on. Third, the advance of efficiency exceeds that of stability due to the rapid innovation rate in the solar cell field; therefore it is necessary to balance device performance and stability. New doping strategies may be more expected to solve device stability issues. In addition, current studies on stability are inconsistent in experimental details and conditions, which make comparison difficult. The standard or transferrable testing protocols are needed.
To date, a large number of research studies regarding alternative HTLs have been reported. Whether they can completely replace spiro-OMeTAD needs further confirmation. In addition, the development of lead-free PSCs is emerging strongly, and it is unknown whether there will be other types of perovskites in the future. Perhaps, spiro-OMeTAD will no longer be applicable to these new perovskites, whereas we believe that the research on dopants is necessary, because these pioneering studies have guiding significance for the doping and modification of organic materials that may be used in commercial PSCs.
