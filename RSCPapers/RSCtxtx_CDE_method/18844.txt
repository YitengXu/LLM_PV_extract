Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated using a novel 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite as a photoelectrode to enhance the power conversion efficiency. Compared with a pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 cell, a DSSC based on a 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode shows ∼115% increase in power conversion efficiency.

In a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), sunlight is absorbed by dye molecules, in which photoexcited electrons are injected to the conduction band of the nanocrystallite and transport across the nanoparticle network. Meanwhile, the holes leave the opposite side of the cell by means of redox species in the electrolyte. However, the close proximity of photoexcited electrons and holes throughout the nanoporous film and lack of potential barrier at the interface could lead to charge recombination. A charge recombination between the photoexcited electrons and the oxidized dye or redox couple in the electrolyte is one of the major limiting factors to the efficiency of a DSSC. Electron trapping in the nanocrystallites is also a mechanism that causes energy loss. A variety of strategies have been employed to suppress the charge recombination at the electrode–electrolyte interface and improve the transport of photoexcited electrons. These include the use of metal oxide nanocomposite photoelectrodes, coupled semiconductor photoelectrodes, highly oriented TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrodes, and nanostructured carbon/TiO2 composite photoelectrodes.

Various studies have shown improved power conversion efficiency (η) in nanocomposite photoelectrodes compared with single semiconductor photoelectrodes. Suppressing charge recombination by using a mixture of SnO2 and ZnO with different energy levels can obtain a better charge separation in the nanocomposite photoelectrode. Furthermore, the incorporation of ZrO2 into a TiO2 matrix was reported to improve the photocatalytic effects. Recently, silicon carbide (SiC), a wide bandgap semiconductor, has attracted great attention in improving electrocatalytic ability towards some electrochemical reactions because of its high chemical stability, strong heat impact resistance, and biocompatible properties. There are many polymorphs of SiC and each crystal structure exhibits unique electrical and optical properties. Two most commonly obtainable SiC forms are a hexagonal structure 6H-SiC and a cubic structure 3C-SiC. Here we show for the first time that 3C-SiC was incorporated into TiO2 matrix to form a 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite for use as a photoelectrode in DSSCs in an attempt to reduce the charge recombination rate.
To investigate the function of 3C-SiC on the performance of DSSCs based on the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite, photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics were carried out with a pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film and a 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite. The J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated by a conventional nanocrystalline TiO2 film photoelectrode, a new 6H-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode and a new 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode are shown in Fig. 1. It is obvious that the DSSC with 3C-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode exhibited higher short-circuit current density (Jsc), resulting in improved η. However, the DSSC with 6H-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode showed lower cell efficiency than the pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film photoelectrode. Values of Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc), and η were 7.18 mA cm−2, 0.667 V and 3.39%, respectively, for the pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film photoelectrode. As compared with the pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film photoelectrode, there were about 49% increase in Jsc and 55% increase in η for the 3C-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode. In contrast, there were 12% decrease in Jsc and 6% decrease in η for the 6H-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode. The higher Jsc obtained using the 3C-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode is probably related to either the amount of adsorbed dye or the nature of 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite, or both. In order to investigate the causes of the enhancement of Jsc in a DSSC with a 3C-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode, the amount of adsorbed dye was estimated by UV/visible absorption spectroscopy. The amount of adsorbed dye for the pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film, 6H-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite and 3C-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite were 7.7 × 10−8, 7.6 × 10−8 and 7.8 × 10−8 mol cm−2, respectively. The similarity of these three values suggested that the effect of amount of adsorbed dye on the performance of the DSSCs could be ignored. This phenomenon was further confirmed by the surface morphology of TiO2, 6H-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2, and 3C-SiC (0.01 wt%)/TiO2 (Fig. S1, ESI), with no obvious morphology difference between them. Therefore, the different behaviors seen in the performance of the DSSCs would appear to be attributable to the different bandgap energies of 6H-SiC and 3C-SiC. 6H-SiC is a hexagonal structure with a 2.9 eV bandgap, whereas 3C-SiC is a cubic structure with a 2.2 eV bandgap energy, i.e. the bandgap energy of 3C-SiC is ∼0.7 eV less than that of 6H-SiC. Therefore, it can be expected that the conduction band of 3C-SiC is close to the conduction band of TiO2. The lower bandgap energy of 3C-SiC thus offers an opportunity to facilitate photoexcited electron transport and increase photovoltaic conversion efficiency. The enhanced values of Jsc may result from the high probability of transport of electrons by excited dye molecules throughout the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite to the underlying fluorine-doped SnO2 glass substrate (FTO). This process leads to a suppression of charge recombination and a better charge separation with the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode. This finding is encouraging as it indicates that the performance of DSSC can be effectively enhanced by the incorporation of 3C-SiC in the TiO2 matrix.

Table 1 summarizes the Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF) and η for 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes with different 3C-SiC contents. The Voc and FF were almost unaffected by changing the 3C-SiC contents in 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes. The Jsc increased from 10.69 to 14.55 mA cm−2 (from 0.01 to 0.04 wt% 3C-SiC), and then decreased from 14.55 to 11.84 mA cm−2 (from 0.04 to 0.16 wt% 3C-SiC). The values of η were 5.26, 6.32, 7.19, 5.87 and 5.67% for 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes with 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 wt% 3C-SiC, respectively. The value of η increased in the presence of 3C-SiC in the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode and reached a maximum at 0.04 wt% 3C-SiC. A subsequent increase in 3C-SiC (0.08–0.16 wt%) in the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite led to a decrease in η and so the optimum 3C-SiC content for DSSC application was 0.04 wt%.

For the DSSC based on the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode, injected electrons transfer into the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite to generate a photocurrent. To investigate the improvement of photovoltaic performance of the DSSC based on the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. The Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on the pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film photoelectrode and 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes with different 3C-SiC contents measured under 100 mW cm−2 at an applied potential bias of −0.75 V are shown in Fig. 2a. Three typical semicircles were observed in the measured frequency regions of 10 mHz to 65 kHz for the nanocrystalline TiO2 film and 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposites. The semicircles in the high, intermediate and low frequency ranges are attributed to impedance related to the charge transfer process at the electrolyte/Pt interface, the charge transfer at the electrolyte/dye/3C-SiC/TiO2 interface, and the Nernstian diffusion of I−/I3− in the electrolyte, respectively. The Nyquist plots indicated that the values of charge transfer resistance determined from the real impedance component (Z′) of the intermediate frequency side semicircle were 27.1, 16.0, 14.9, 13.6, 14.3 and 17.4 ohm for electrolyte/dye/TiO2 and electrolyte/dye/3C-SiC/TiO2 with 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 wt% 3C-SiC, respectively. The charge transfer resistance decreased with increasing the 3C-SiC contents in the range of 0.01–0.04 wt% in the 3C-SiC/TiO2 photoelectrodes because of the increase of conductance in the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite. The increase of charge transfer resistance at the 3C-SiC/TiO2 photoelectrodes beyond 0.04 wt% 3C-SiC is presumably attributed to charge recombination. The Nyquist plots of the DSSCs based on the nanocrystalline TiO2 film and 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes with different 3C-SiC contents measured in the dark at an applied potential bias of −0.75 V are shown in Fig. 2b. The values of charge recombination resistance estimated from the real impedance component (Z′) of the intermediate frequency side semicircle were 23.6, 44.2, 48.6, 57.4, 39.0 and 32.7 ohm for the electrolyte/dye/TiO2 and electrolyte/dye/3C-SiC/TiO2 with 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 wt% 3C-SiC, respectively. The high charge recombination resistance obtained at the electrolyte/dye/3C-SiC/TiO2 with 0.04 wt% 3C-SiC in the dark means that the charge recombination between injected electrons and electron accepters in the redox electrolyte is low. From the EIS of the electrolyte/dye/3C-SiC/TiO2 interface resistances under illumination and in the dark, a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and an increase in the charge recombination resistance of the DSSCs is indicated after the inclusion of 3C-SiC (0.01–0.04 wt%) in the TiO2 matrix. However, subsequent increase of 3C-SiC (0.08–0.16 wt%) in the 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes led to a reversal of this bahavior. The results show a very good consistency with the J–V observations in Table 1.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSC based on 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrodes with four different thicknesses is listed in Table 2. The value of Jsc increased from 10.96 to 16.33 mA cm−2 (from 4.0 to 12.9 μm), and then decreased to 14.77 mA cm−2 at a thickness of 16.1 μm. An increased Jsc with increasing film thickness in the range of 4.0 to 12.9 μm is attributed to more dye molecules adsorbed onto 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposites. However, upon further increasing the film thickness of the 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 up to 16.1 μm, the charge recombination between injected electrons and electron acceptor species in the electrolyte become more significant and could influence the conductor phase within the 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite. This leads to a lower Jsc fo a thicker 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 film. As a result, η increased with increasing the film thickness of the 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 layer from 4.0 to 12.9 μm, and then decreased above this value. A 12.9 μm film thickness of 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite achieved a high conversion efficiency of 7.3%. There was a ∼127% increase in Jsc and ∼115% increase in η for 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite when compared with pristine nanocrystalline TiO2 film.

In this study we show for the first time a DSSC application of a 3C-SiC/TiO2 nanocomposite. The enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency is correlated with the promotion of electron transfer from the adsorbed dye to the working electrode and the suppression of charge recombination between the injected electrons and the dye cation or redox couple. This proposed 3C-SiC (0.04 wt%)/TiO2 nanocomposite photoelectrode might be beneficial to develop high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of DSSCs in a simple and versatile protocol.
