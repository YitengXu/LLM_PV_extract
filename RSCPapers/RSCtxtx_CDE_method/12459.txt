Herein, two perylene diimide (PDI) trimer arrays (bbb-3PDI and obo-3PDI), which are coupled at different reactive positions of the PDI monomer, have been efficiently synthesized and comprehensively investigated. The photophysical and electrochemical properties indicate that these two compounds exhibit much strong absorption in the visible region and suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the compound bbb-3PDI possesses stronger abilities of accepting electrons from donors and donating holes to the donor materials; thus, this compound is beneficial for exciton dissociation in OSCs. Upon choosing an appropriate energy level alignment and PTB7-Th with well-matched absorption as electron donors, the active layer of PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI exhibits favorable morphology, higher carrier mobilities, and more balanced carrier transport. As a result, the device based on PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.12% and a high short circuit current (JSC) of 18.13 mA cm−2, which are the highest values obtained for the PDI-array-based non-fullerene OSCs. The obtained performance based on bbb-3PDI is significantly higher than those of obo-3PDI (4.55%) and the PDI dimer arrays; this highlights the potential of the PDI trimer arrays to realize high-efficiency non-fullerene OSCs.

Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, used for the very first organic thin-film solar cell (OSC) devices as electron acceptors, have attracted significant attention in the past three decades. In the initial stage, owing to the strong aggregation property of PDIs, PDI-derived electron acceptors have realized high efficiencies in the double-layer heterojunction OSC devices. However, with the development of the bulk heterojunction OSC devices, the strong aggregation property has become a major obstacle because the PDI films can form large crystallites of micrometer length that are too large for efficient exciton splitting and also act as traps for excitation energy. Usually, for typical donor materials, the exciton diffusion length is approximately 10 nm; hence, large fractions of the exciton would be quenched in films before reaching the donor–acceptor interface for carrier creation. Recently, the twisted structures of PDI derivatives, which can inhibit strong π-stacking and excimer formation, have made a significant contribution to high-efficiency PDI-type OSCs. To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) based on PDI-type OSCs are comparable with those of the classical fullerene-type OSCs. Therefore, how to design the molecular structure is a crucial issue to achieve high efficiencies in OSCs.

PDI arrays, an important family of PDI derivatives, are directly linked by single, double, or triple bonds among the PDI monomers. Owing to the different structure effects, the single-bonded PDI arrays, which form twisted structures to inhibit strong aggregation, have been successfully applied in OSCs, whereas the double- or triple-linked arrays, exhibiting almost planar conjugation and aggregation properties, are usually used for high charge mobility organic field-effect transistor devices. Nowadays, almost all studies on PDI arrays are based on the dimer structure. In addition, after matching appropriate energy levels of electron donors, PDI dimer arrays have realized PCEs over 5.0% in non-fullerene OSCs. In addition, the PDI dimer arrays could be used as building blocks to construct more efficient electron acceptors for higher efficiencies. On the other hand, for PDI-derived electron acceptors, PDI-based polyploids are prone to realizing favorable morphology and high electron mobility and therefore achieving high efficiencies. Therefore, inspired by the successful examples of the PDI dimer arrays and the PDI-based polyploids for high-efficiency OSCs, we developed significant interest to investigate the PDI trimer arrays as electron acceptors for non-fullerene OSC devices.
Recently, we have developed a new series of heterologous PDI arrays based on PDI monomers connected at different positions, and these arrays have realized potential device efficiencies in non-fullerene OSCs. The trimer array has shown some promising significant advantages of higher maximum molar extinction coefficient, higher electron mobility, more favorable morphology of the blend film, and significantly improved device efficiency as compared to the corresponding dimer array. However, the optimized device only provided a moderate PCE below 5%; the main reason for this might be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer in the asymmetric molecular structure. Therefore, in this study, we focused on comparing two different PDI trimer arrays, a homologous PDI trimer array (bbb-3PDI) and a heterologous PDI trimer array (obo-3PDI) (Fig. 1), and explored whether PDI arrays could realize high efficiencies in non-fullerene OSCs. Herein, we have compared and investigated the detailed photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the two PDI trimer arrays, which are synthesized by the efficient Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. The polymer PTB7-Th has been used as an electron donor, which has complementary absorption with the electron acceptors and well-matched energy levels, and the device based on bbb-3PDI provides a high PCE of 7.12%, which demonstrates that PDI trimer arrays have great potential as electron acceptors for the further development of PDI-based acceptor materials.

The syntheses of obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI), and the starting materials are synthesized according to the procedures reported in literature. It should be noted that the bbb-3PDI array has been synthesized by the classical Ullmann coupling reactions with the dihalogen- or tetrahalogen-substituted PDI monomers. However, in this one-pot synthesis, a series of PDI arrays with different amounts of oligomers are obtained simultaneously. Moreover, it is very difficult to obtain a single PDI array by column chromatography from a series of oligomers because of their similar molecular polarities. Therefore, in this study, we used the efficient Suzuki cross-coupling reactions to synthesize two trimers (obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI) in the high yields of 75% and 77%, respectively. The compounds are highly soluble in common organic solvents and have been fully characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. In addition, the thermal stability of the compounds was investigated by thermal gravity analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the results are presented in Fig. 2. Both the compounds obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI show good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss temperatures of 382.3 and 324.5 °C, respectively.


The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the compounds in a dilute dichloromethane solution (10−5 M) and solid thin films are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. They exhibit three vibronic peaks, resembling those of a PDI monomer. Compared with obo-3PDI with narrow multiple absorption peaks throughout the 450–550 nm range, bbb-3PDI shows a broad absorption spectrum in the range from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 3a); this is due to the more extended electron delocalization of the bay-position-substituting effect. In addition, the maximum absorption peaks are at 530 nm with the maximum molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and at 529 nm with the εmax of 4.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, respectively. In thin films (each thin film was formed with the same solution concentration of 10 mg ml−1) (Fig. 3b), the absorption spectra are similar to those obtained in solution, but the absorption peaks are slightly red shifted by 3 and 4 nm from solution to solid film for pure obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, respectively; this demonstrates that the intermolecular π–π interactions are decreased in the solid state. In addition, Fig. 3b shows that the absorption spectra of the two compounds are complementary to those of PTB7-Th; thus, the blend films (dot lines) can absorb solar light from visible and near-infrared region.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure the energy levels of obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI (Fig. 4). Similar to fullerene derivatives, both compounds have several reduction waves, which are beneficial to accept more electrons while generating the charge. The compounds obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI exhibit three and four one-electron reduction waves, respectively. The first reduction potentials of the PDI arrays provide the positive values of −1.09 V for obo-3PDI and −1.01 V for bbb-3PDI; this indicates an increase in the electron-accepting abilities. From the onset reduction potentials, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are estimated to be −3.99 and −4.08 eV for obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, respectively, which are similar to those of PC61BM (−4.00 eV) and PC71BM (−4.10 eV), respectively, and match well with those of commonly used donor polymers. The relatively low lying LUMO levels as compared to those of previously reported PDI-based acceptors may also account for the enhanced air stability.


To obtain further insights into the electronic structures of obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, their ground-state geometries were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP functional and a 6-31G(d,p) basis set. As observed from the optimized ground-state geometries (Fig. S1, ESI), big molecular planar distortions of 75° and 72° exist for obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, respectively, between PDI monomers, which constitute the steric coplanar structures to inhibit the strong intermolecular aggregation, therefore resulting in good solubility. As shown in Fig. 5, the LUMO and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) electron densities of bbb-3PDI are mainly distributed on the three PDI monomers; however, for obo-3PDI, the LUMO are mainly located on the ortho-connected PDI units, whereas the HOMO are mainly located on the bay-connected PDI unit. More interestingly, for bbb-3PDI, although the distributions of LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 surfaces are slightly different from that of the LUMO surface, these three LUMO orbitals have a small difference of the energy levels, i.e., −3.74, −3.59, and −3.51 eV for LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2, respectively, and a similar phenomenon can be observed in the HOMO levels as well. However, for obo-3PDI, the distribution of LUMO+2 surface is obviously different from those of the LUMO and LUMO+1 surfaces, and the energy level of LUMO+2 has a big difference of over 0.2 eV from those of LUMO and LUMO+1. In addition, the energy levels of HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 have a big difference of over 0.2 eV from that of HOMO. All these results indicate that as the acceptor material, bbb-3PDI has three LUMO levels with a similar ability to accept electrons from donor, and three HOMO levels can donate holes to the donor material, whereas obo-3PDI exhibits less abilities of accepting electrons and donating holes. The calculated LUMO levels are −3.66 and −3.74 eV for obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, respectively, in which the regularity is consistent with the experimental data.


To investigate the photovoltaic properties, non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:obo-3PDI or bbb-3PDI/MoO3/Al, where ITO was indium tin oxide, and ZnO and MoO3 were used as the n- and p-type interfacial layers, respectively, to facilitate charge transport and collection. The photovoltaic properties were optimized by changing different D/A weight ratios and using a trace amount of some solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), chloronaphthalene (CN), and diphenyl ether (DPE).Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs based on bbb-3PDI and obo-3PDI under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit current density (JSC), the open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and PCE are outlined in Table 1. We first investigated the effect of D/A weight ratios (1.5:1, 1:1, and 1:1.5) of the active layer blends on the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs. Obviously, the optimal D/A weight ratio is 1:1 (Fig. 6a), and the optimum PCE of the bbb-3PDI-based device reaches 5.14% with a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 17.33 mA cm−2, and an FF of 40.1%. By contrast, the device based on obo-3PDI provides an inferior PCE of 2.54% and, in particular, a lower JSC of 9.36 mA cm−2 most likely due to charge recombination.

To further optimize the photovoltaic performance, with the optimum D/A weight ratio of 1:1 of bbb-3PDI, the solvent additives (DIO, CN, or DPE) were used to improve the morphology of the blend films (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI). As shown in Fig. 6b and Fig. S2 (ESI), when DIO at different amounts was used as the processing solvent, all the blend films provided the optimal photovoltaic performance, whereas the solvent additives CN and DPE did not show obvious improvement in the efficiencies. At a very low DIO concentration of 0.5%, the solar cells yielded a high PCE of 5.61% due to the simultaneous improvements in JSC and FF. When the DIO concentration was increased to 1%, the PCE went up to 7.12% with a JSC of 18.13 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.764 V, and an FF of 51.4%. Upon further increasing the DIO concentration over 1%, the efficiencies were decreased. The PCE of over 7% for bbb-3PDI is the highest value among those of the PDI arrays, and much higher than those of the PDI dimer arrays; this indicates that the PDI arrays are potential as electron acceptor materials and can realize high efficiencies in non-fullerene OSCs. Moreover, we have noted that the FF values (<0.6) are relatively low in the OSC devices, and the performance may be further improved after careful matching of donor materials and device optimization. In addition, the performance of the device based on obo-3PDI was analyzed for comparison, and the detailed optimized process was investigated. Compared to those of bbb-3PDI, the devices with little additive of DIO provided the decreasing JSC and therefore resulted in poor performance. When combined with thermal annealing at 160 °C and the additive of 2% CN, the device based on obo-3PDI exhibited an improved photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 4.55%, which was lower than that of the bbb-3PDI-based OSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 6c. Both devices exhibited broad EQE spectra from 300 to 800 nm, which corresponded to the absorption spectra of the blend films. For the bbb-3PDI-based device with 1% DIO, the EQE values in the wavelength range of 500–700 nm were observed to be higher than 60%; the maximum value was about 75%, indicating efficient photon harvesting and charge collection. The JSC value calculated from the EQE spectra was 17.91 mA cm−2, which was in good agreement with the JSC value obtained from the J–V curves (18.13 mA cm−2) with a small deviation of less than 5%.

The photoluminescence (PL) quenching of the thin blend films was measured to determine the percentage of exciton that could reach and dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface (Fig. 7a). The fluorescence quenching values of 91% and 90% for PTB7-Th were obtained for the blend films based on bbb-3PDI and obo-3PDI, respectively, indicating that the non-radiant electron transfer occurred efficiently at the interfaces of the donors and the acceptors. The charge transport properties of the pure films and blend films were investigated using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The electron mobilities were measured with the device structure ITO/ZnO/Pure (or blend) film/Ca/Al, and the hole mobilities were measured with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Blend film/MoO3/Al (Fig. 7b and c, respectively). In the pure film (bbb-3PDI or obo-3PDI) SCLC electron-only devices (Fig. 7b), bbb-3PDI provides a much higher electron mobility of 1.31 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 as compared to obo-3PDI (3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In their blend film SCLC devices (Fig. 7c), the high hole mobilities of 1.39 × 10−4 and 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI and PTB7-Th:obo-3PDI blend films, respectively. However, in their electron-only devices, the relatively low electron mobilities of 3.56 × 10−5 and 1.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI and obo-3PDI blend films, respectively. Obviously, the hole mobilities of the blend films are much higher than the electron mobilities. In addition, the ratios of hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) are 3.9 and 5.2 for PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI and PTB7-Th:obo-3PDI blend films, respectively. The effective fluorescence quenching, high carrier mobility, and relatively more balanced carrier transport in the active layer may account for the high PCEs achieved in PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI OSCs.


To better understand the charge recombination processes of the OSCs based on the blend films, light-intensity-dependent characteristics were investigated. Exciton generation rates and the charge collection probabilities (PC, determined by the normalized Jph at the saturated current density) were revealed using plots of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) under JSC conditions, as shown in Fig. 8a, and Jph has been defined by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and under the dark condition, respectively. In addition, Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0, and Vappl is the applied bias voltage. The resulting PC was determined to be 83% and 93% for PTB7-Th:obo-3PDI and PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI blend films with the corresponding best beneficial additives, respectively. The higher PC value of 93% for the PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI blend film is consistent with the superior photovoltaic performance.

The light intensity (P) dependence of JSC was also measured to investigate non-geminate recombination losses of the devices. The relationship between JSC and light intensity followed the relation JSC ∝ PS. The S values were calculated to be 0.86 and 0.91 from the JSC–P curves shown in Fig. 8b for PTB7-Th:obo-3PDI and PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI blend films, respectively. The higher value of 0.91 for the device based on bbb-3PDI signified that the bimolecular recombination was negligible in the device, which was superior to other device based on obo-3PDI. All these data suggested that the device based on bbb-3PDI exhibited less charge-trapped recombination, which was consistent with the higher JSC in the OSCs, and therefore improved photovoltaic properties.

The proper phase separation and interpenetrating networks of donor and acceptor domains are critical to charge separation and carrier transport. The morphologies of the blend films were investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 9). The surface of the PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI blend films without any optimization is smooth and uniform with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.72 nm. Using the solvent additive of 1% DIO, the device provides an increased RMS of 0.93 nm, indicating enhanced aggregation and phase separation that are beneficial for increasing the charge mobility. On the other hand, for the blend films of PTB7-Th:obo-3PDI, after the addition of 2% CN, the RMS roughness is slightly increased from 0.69 to 0.78 nm. Moreover, from the phase images, the blend film of PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI with 1% DIO shows a continuous interpenetrating network, which is beneficial for the exciton dissociation and charge transport. These results agree well with the increased FF and JSC observed and therefore with the higher PCE of the PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI devices.


In summary, we have comprehensively investigated two different PDI trimer arrays that are obtained by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with high yields. Herein, two molecules exhibit strong absorptions from 400 to 600 nm. In addition, the CV spectra provide the low LUMO levels of −3.99 and −4.08 eV for obo-3PDI and bbb-3PDI, respectively, which are similar to those of PCBM and suitable for the non-fullerene OSCs. Owing to the strong electron accepting and donating abilities, favorable morphology, higher carrier mobilities, more balanced carrier transport, and less charge-trapped recombination,

the device based on PTB7-Th:bbb-3PDI with 1% DIO as an additive provides the best PCE of 7.12% with a JSC as high as 18.13 mA cm−2, which are the highest values among the PDI arrays and much higher than those of the PDI dimer arrays. Therefore, the trimer arrays provide a possibility for further development of PDI-based electron acceptors for high efficiency non-fullerene OSCs.
