Addressing pertinent and perplexing questions regarding why nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) promote higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than traditional fullerenes and how photoactive bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film morphology, charge photogeneration, and recombination dynamics dictate solar cell performance have stimulated many studies of polymer solar cells (PSCs), yet quantitative relationships remain limited. Better understanding in these areas offers the potential to advance materials design and device engineering, afford higher PCEs, and ultimate commercialization. Here we probe quantitative relationships between BHJ film morphology, charge carrier dynamics, and photovoltaic performance in model binary and ternary blend systems having a wide bandgap donor polymer, a fullerene, and a promising NFA. We show that optimal PC71BM incorporation in a PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary system matrix retains the original π-face-on orientation, ITIC-Th crystallinity and BHJ film crystallite dimensions, and reduces film upper surface ITIC-Th segregation. Such morphology changes together simultaneously increase hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities, facilitate light-activated ITIC-Th to PC71BM domain electron delocalization, reduce free charge carrier (FC) bimolecular recombination (BR) within PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th mixed regions, and increase FC extraction pathways viaPBDB-TF:PC71BM pairs. The interplay of these effects yields significantly enhanced inverted cell short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE. Unexpectedly, we also find that excessive PC71BM in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary system alters the PBDB-TF orientation to π-edge-on, increases large scale PC71BM-rich aggregations and BHJ upper surface PC71BM composition. These morphology changes increase parasitic decay processes such as intersystem crossing from photoexcited PC71BM, compromising the JSC, FF, and PCE metrics. ITIC-Th X-ray diffraction reveals a unique sidechain-dominated molecular network with previously unknown sidechain-end group stacking, rationalizing the STEM and GIWAXS results, photophysics, and the high μe. DFT computation reveals charge transfer networks within ITIC-Th crystallites, supporting excited-state electron delocalization from ITIC-Th to PC71BM. This structure–property understanding leads to a newly reported NFA blend with PCE near 17%.

Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) offer the attractions of earth-abundant starting materials, structure and properties tunability via “green” chemical reactions, large-area solution processability, light weight, minimal toxicity, and mechanical flexibility, which together make them ideal as one of the promising next-generation solar energy harvesting technologies. Nevertheless, current leading research directions in the field remain focused on the fundamental mechanistic studies, and a clear relationship between BHJ morphology structure, photophysics, and device performance is still lacking in polymer–nonfullerene binary and polymer–nonfullerene–fullerene ternary systems. Here we systematically investigate BHJ blends of the PBDB-TF donor polymer, indacenodithienothiophene-based non-fullerene (NFA) material ITIC-Th, Y6-based NFA material BTBOL4F, and fullerene PC71BM, using nanostructural crystallographic, morphological, transient absorption spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory, single carrier diodes, and inverted solar cell analysis probes. The results reveal that incorporation of PC71BM into ITIC-Th binary system changes molecular orientation, crystallinity, domain size, and BHJ upper surface composition, and therefore change electron delocalization, charge mobility, bimolecular recombination, and thus solar cell JSC, FF, and PCE metrics. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveal the intricate structural relationships of molecular packing and electronic properties such as reorganization energy, electronic coupling, charge delocalization, and excited-state energetics. Overall, this contribution provides general quantitative morphology-charge dynamics-device performance design rules for future PSC development.


Solar energy is one of the most powerful renewable energy sources, with the potential to satisfy increasing global energy needs. It can be efficiently harvested and utilized by photosynthesis in plants, solar fuels, catalysts, and artificial electronic devices such as organic polymer solar cells (PSCs), which have shown power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 19% in the laboratory. Traditional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaic devices made from silicon, colloidal nanocrystal, and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) materials, showing high PCE in the range of 20% to 21%, have been commercialized, and have dominated the solar cell market for decades. Among them, pure crystalline silicon solar cells are approaching their PCE limit, and new semiconducting materials and techniques are becoming crucial. Compared with perovskite solar cell materials, organic semiconductor technologies that use chemically synthesized polymers or small molecules with π-conjugated electrons as the charge carrier offer the attractions of earth-abundant starting materials, structure and property tunability via “green” chemical reactions, large-area solution processability, light weight, minimal toxicity, and mechanical flexibility, which together make PSCs ideal as one of the next generation of solar energy harvesting technologies.

PSCs are commonly fabricated from solution-spin-coated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films of small molecule, polymer, or polymer-small molecule blends as the photon absorbing active layer. They enable PCEs that have steadily increased to a current 19%, due to the recent advent of new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) small molecule materials. The PCE of a typical PSC is determined by the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF): PCE = VOC × JSC × FF/Pin, where Pin is the incident solar light power. Since PSC laboratory PCE values tend to be lower preceding optimization and manufacture, current leading research directions in the field remain focused on fundamental mechanistic studies supporting the chemical design and synthesis of new high-performing materials for device engineering and stability testing.
In 2013, Friend and co-workers showed that the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton (T1) of the donor polymer is frequently lower in energy than the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) state, and the formation of triplet excitons can be the dominant loss mechanism in polymer–fullerene photovoltaic cells. Recently, the same group reported that the majority of charge recombination under open-circuit conditions proceeds via the formation of non-emissive NFA triplet excitons. Salleo and co-workers proposed a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films, and showed that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. Regarding BHJ morphology and the Flory–Huggins parameter χ, in 2018, Ade and co-workers established a quantitative constant-kink-saturation relation between the temperature-dependent effective amorphous–amorphous interaction parameter χaa(T) and FF in organic solar cells. Nevertheless, a clear relationship between BHJ morphology structure, photophysics, and device performance is still lacking in polymer–nonfullerene binary and polymer–nonfullerene–fullerene ternary systems. Specifically, there are unanswered questions, such as: What is the highest performing BHJ film morphology, molecular orientation, semiconductor phase separation, and domain size possible? How do charge photogeneration and recombination influence VOC, JSC, and FF? How do free charge carriers recombine? To address these fundamental issues, our aim here is to provide a clearer picture of the chemical structure, BHJ morphology, charge dynamics, and device performance correlations for BHJ devices containing both NFAs and fullerenes.

PBDB-TF (Fig. 1a, also known as PM6) is a well-established, wide optical bandgap, semi-crystalline donor polymer, delivering high PCEs (7.4% to 18%) when matched with diverse NFAs, and is chosen here to probe generalizable structure-performance correlations. ITIC-Th (Fig. 1a) is a typical indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT)-based semi-crystalline electron acceptor with four 2-thienyl groups as the out-of-plane bulky non-conjugated part, showing stronger optical absorption, higher electron mobility and PCE in organic semiconducting material blends than ITIC.BTBOL4F is a typical Y6-based end-capping group extension and halogenation electron acceptor, showing a smaller optical bandgap, lower reorganization energy, larger electronic couplings, and a higher PCE than Y6, and is chosen here to generalize the ternary strategy found in the ITIC-Th system. Note that some previously published results for a PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F binary blend used a different PBDB-TF polymer batch than this work, so the new polymer batch data for PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F will be included and compared in the analysis of ternary blends. Here, the photovoltaic parameters are measured in inverted solar cells, and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobilities are measured in single carrier diodes. BHJ film morphology is characterized by AFM, TEM, STEM, grazing incidence 2θ X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) measurements. Charge photogeneration and recombination dynamics are quantified by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and light intensity dependence experiments. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, together with density functional theory (DFT) analyses, reveal the intricate structural relationships between molecular packing and electronic properties such as reorganization energy, electronic coupling, charge delocalization, and excited-state energetics. These generalizable understandings can then be applied to other NFA systems to ultimately enhance PSC performance. Overall, we believe that this contribution provides general quantitative multiple structure–property-device performance design rules and high PCE design paradigms for future PSC development.

We begin by blending the donor polymer PBDB-TF, having good molecular mass and polydispersity (Fig. S1, ESI) with the small molecule acceptor semiconductors ITIC-Th and PC71BM. The resulting binary and ternary films are characterized in inverted PSC architectures, hole-only and electron-only single carrier diodes, and the film morphology, charge photogeneration and recombination are quantified by a diverse range of high-resolution spatial and temporal experimental techniques. For evaluating solid-state packing and theoretical understanding, the single crystal structure analysis of ITIC-Th is reported, shedding light on the high-performance mystery of this NFA material. In this discussion, we organize the flow sequentially from solar cell fabrication and performance, charge carrier mobility, BHJ film morphology characterizations, GIWAXS, NEXAFS, single crystal structure analysis, and RSoXS experiments, to charge photogeneration and recombination dynamics, and theoretical simulations. All experimental details are provided in the ESI.


Photovoltaic performance was characterized in the inverted device architecture, ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO (zinc oxide)/photoactive layer/MoOx (molybdenum oxide)/Ag (Fig. 1c) under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The ZnO electron extraction (hole blocking) interfacial layer was deposited using the sol-gel method, while the MoOx hole extraction (electron blocking) layer was thermally grown under vacuum. More experimental details of the device fabrication and measurements can be found in the ESI.Fig. 1d and e shows the champion current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, respectively, and Table 1 summarizes all the binary and ternary BHJ electronic device metrics.

PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary cells were first optimized by tuning the polymer concentration, solvent additive, annealing temperature and time (see ESI, for details, Table S2), and the optimal BHJ films were spin-coated using chloroform solutions of PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th in a 1:1 mass ratio without additives, and annealed at 160 °C for 5 min. The result shows an average JSC of 15.64 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.951 V, and FF of 0.68, yielding an average PCE of 10.18% (10.42% champion, Table 1), comparable to previous reports. For comparison, PBDB-TF:PC71BM binary cells output an average PCE = 6.58% (6.77% champion). The solar cell VOC values of PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th and PBDB-TF:PC71BM agree with the LUMO depth of acceptors from thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. 1c. Ternary BHJ solar cells were next fabricated retaining the optimized PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary conditions (see ESI, for details), revealing first a decrease, then an increase and finally a fall in PCE as the PC71BM content is increased and the ITIC-Th content is decreased (Fig. 1f). This trend mainly reflects JSC and FF changes, since the VOC values are almost unchanged. The optimized weight ratio of ITIC-Th to PC71BM is found to be 6:2, and the blend exhibits an average JSC = 16.85 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.937 V, FF = 0.69, and PCE = 10.92%. The champion PCE achieved for this composition is 11.55%, among the highest values achieved in similar PSC systems. The PCEs of the 8:8:0, 8:7:1, 8:5:3, 8:4:4, 8:3:5, and 8:2:6 blend compositions (PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th:PC71BM) are found to be rather similar, ranging from 9.49% to 10.42%, and significantly higher than those of the 8:1:7 ternary and PBDB-TF:PC71BM binary blends (Table 1 and Fig. S5, ESI). A similar PCE trend is also reported for a Y6-derivative ternary system with BTBOL4F (Fig. S7 and Table S5, ESI), PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F:PC71BM, with PCEs approaching 17% realized for the first time in the 8:7:1 and 8:6:2 blends and suggesting a wide applicability of this ternary strategy.
Interestingly, the EQE spectra of the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th, PBDB-TF:PC71BM blends show strong photoresponse from λ = 300 nm to 800 nm, and 300 nm to 750 nm, respectively (Fig. 1e). The greater ITIC-Th optical absorption range relative to PC71BM results in a greater JSC (15.52 versus 11.52 mA cm−2). Notably, the ternary 8:6:2 blend exhibits similar EQE response as the binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend with enhanced EQE from 350 nm to 675 nm (PBDB-TF optical absorption) and 680 nm to 740 nm (ITIC-Th optical absorption) wavelength range. Overall, the EQE spectra (Fig. S5, ESI) are in very good agreement with the corresponding PSC J–V data (Table 1).

In general, the carrier mobility contributes significantly to JSC, FF, and PCE metrics. To understand this, the vertical charge transport in the present thin films was investigated by the single carrier diode SCLC method (Table 1 and Fig. 1g, see the SCLC measurements section in ESI for details). Hole mobilities (μhs) were measured using ITO/MoOx/organics/MoOx/Ag diodes, and electron mobilities (μes) were measured using ITO/ZnO/organics/LiF/Al diodes, respectively. As a control, the neat PBDB-TF, ITIC-Th, PC71BM films were found to have electron mobilities of [(7.93 ± 1.31) × 10−4, (5.53 ± 3.74) × 10−4, and (15.46 ± 11.54) × 10−4] cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, similar to literature reports. These suggest the present measurements are reliable, despite the estimated uncertainties. Binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend films have μh = (6.86 ± 3.73) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = (3.90 ± 2.59) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable to other NFA-based blends with high PCEs. Interestingly, in comparison, the present binary PBDB-TF:PC71BM blend films exhibit higher μh = (13.60 ± 6.42) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 but similar μe = (3.56 ± 1.95) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This μh enhancement is consistent with fullerene-induced PBDB-TF π-edge-on ordering in the blend vs neat PBDB-TF (vide infra). Comparing all the binary and ternary blend films, the ternary 8:6:2 films have the highest μh = (16.73 ± 7.98) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and highest μe = (8.07 ± 7.05) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which should be beneficial for FC extraction to the electrodes during PSC operation. The μhs of the ternary 8:5:3, 8:4:4, 8:3:5, 8:2:6, 8:1:7, and binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend films are of similar magnitude, 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the μes of all binary and ternary blends follow the interesting trend of first increasing and then falling with increasing PC71BM content (Fig. 1g), reflecting the acceptor composition ratio, BHJ phase separation, and acceptor molecular packing in the BHJs (vide infra).


Similar to most light-harvesting biological systems and natural photosynthesis, the active layer film microscopic structure of photovoltaic devices is known to play a key role in exciton photogeneration and dissociation, free charge carrier transport and recombination, and the resulting device performance. In the present case, introducing PC71BM into the binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th system makes this role more intriguing. Previously, only limited quantitative understanding of molecular orientation and crystalline packings in organic semiconductor blends was available, with less clarity for amorphous domains. Next, the photoactive layer BHJ morphology of the present films was comprehensively investigated by AFM, TEM, STEM microscopy, and by GIXRD, GIWAXS, NEXAFS, RSoXS X-ray experiments.

Typical tapping mode AFM images of PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th, PBDB-TF:PC71BM, and 8:6:2 ternary blends (Fig. S12, ESI) show RMS surface roughness, Rq of (1.30 nm, 0.81 nm, and 1.54) nm, respectively, indicating a relatively smooth upper surface for these blend films. They also display similar phase images. TEM in the bright field imaging mode was next used to probe bulk film morphology and visualize spatial domain distributions. Due to the greater electron density and crystallinity of the acceptor molecules than in PBDB-TF, the lighter and darker regions in the bright field mode TEM images are assigned to PBDB-TF and acceptor domains, respectively (Fig. S14, ESI). The PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend exhibits features with randomly distributed ITIC-Th domains, while the PBDB-TF:PC71BM blend exhibits extensive PC71BM aggregation. This result is consistent with the definitive spectroscopic observation of long-range charge separation distances ≥4 nm in organic semiconductor photovoltaic diodes by Friend et al. The smaller ITIC-Th domains in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend which exhibit good phase separation correlate with more efficient charge separation and superior device performance than the PBDB-TF:PC71BM blend (10.42% versus 6.77%, Table 1). In marked contrast, the ternary 8:6:2 blend clearly exhibits a well-balanced interpenetrating network (Fig. S14, ESI). Thus, incorporating an optimal level of PC71BM facilitates a better balanced distribution of polymer/acceptor domains in the blend film, probably limiting geminate recombination and spatially facilitating exciton scission and solar cell performance.
The typical low-angle annular dark field (LAADF)-STEM images from the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th, ternary 8:6:2, 8:3:5, and PBDB-TF:PC71BM blends are shown in Fig. 2a–d and Fig. S16 (ESI). In this LAADF mode, the brighter regions correspond to higher mass-thickness, which is complementary to the TEM bright field mode. The power spectral density (PSD) profiles calculated from the images are shown in Fig. S17 (ESI). The peak in the PSD profiles observed for all the samples corresponds to a size scale of ∼15 nm and matches the center-to-center distances of fibrillar structures in the micrographs. Since this feature occurs in all the samples, including the PBDB-TF:PC71BM blend, it likely originates from the PBDB-TF fibrils. In the blends with ITIC-Th as major component we see crystallites that are likely PBDB-TF as well as ITIC-Th. This is consistent with the semi-crystalline nature of PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th, which is also evident in the GIXRD and GIWAXS measurements (vide infra). As the fullerene content is increased, finer size scales are observed in the 8:3:5 ternary, and with further PC71BM addition, the domain sizes are seen to increase again in the binary PBDB-TF:PC71BM sample. Overall, the TEM data generally agree with the STEM results.

Since the present BHJ films are highly nano-crystalline, GIWAXS together with single crystal X-ray diffraction are the obvious experimental techniques to provide molecular crystalline packing information for neat and BHJ films. The GIWAXS measurements were conducted to further quantify the crystalline packings of the PBDB-TF and acceptor domains in these blend films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of the binary and ternary blends are shown in Fig. 2e–h. The out-of-plane (OoP) and in-plane (IP) 1D sector-averaged profiles obtained from OoP and IP sectors from blends and neat films are shown in Fig. S21 (ESI). Some interesting trends are observed from this dataset. For all the blend samples, the PBDB-TF (100) lamellar stacking near q = 0.3 Å−1 and (010) π–π stacking peak near 1.7 Å−1 can be seen in both OoP and IP directions, suggesting presence of π-face-on as well as π-edge-on populations. Pole figures (Fig. S20, ESI) calculated from the PBDB-TF (100) lamellar stacking peak near 0.3 Å−1 in the GIWAXS data further indicate that PBDB-TF is predominantly π-edge-on in the neat film and PBDB-TF:PC71BM binary blend, and exhibits a monotonic change towards increasingly π-face-on orientation with increasing ITIC-Th content.

Diffraction strengths (DS) calculated from the integration of the pole figures show that the PBDB-TF ordering is greater in the blends than in the neat sample. PBDB-TF is found to have ≈20% higher DS in the ternary samples while similar values are found in both the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th and PBDB-TF:PC71BM binary blends. The polymer OoP (100) lamellar stacking coherence lengths (calculated with the Scherrer equation; see ESI) are found to be higher in blends compared to the neat polymer or with ITIC-Th, suggesting larger crystallites in accordance with the higher DS values of the blend samples. However, in the binary and ternary blends, the OoP coherence lengths appear unaffected by the blend composition. The polymer IP (100) coherence is found to slightly increase with increasing PC71BM content, suggesting the presence of slightly larger face-on PBDB-TF crystallites. The coherence lengths then fall with further PC71BM addition (sample 8:2:6 onwards). ITIC-Th ordering peaks are also observed in the diffraction patterns. The ITIC-Th GIWAXS peaks are indexed by analogy with the single crystal indexing for consistency. Pole figures calculated from the ITIC-Th (00l) lamellar stacking peak near 0.47 Å−1 indicate presence of π-face-on ITIC-Th crystallites. DS calculated from the integration of the pole figures and corrected for ITIC-Th content show that the ITIC-Th ordering in binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th is retained after adding small amounts of PC71BM but decreases with further PC71BM addition (Fig. 3a). ITIC-Th lamellar ordering peaks are not observed for blends where PC71BM is the major acceptor component e.g., the 8:3:5, and 8:2:6 blends, implying that PC71BM addition results in decreased ITIC-Th ordering. Note also that both IP and OoP coherence lengths are higher in the ternary samples suggesting presence of larger ITIC-Th crystallites in ternary versus binary blends. A more complete picture is obtained from the PBDB-TF (010) and ITIC-Th π–π (h00) OoP stacking peaks observed in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary and ternary samples. While the polymer (010) coherence length remains almost unchanged (Fig. 3a), the ITIC-Th (h00) OoP coherence exhibits a trend that is qualitatively similar to the lamellar coherence lengths i.e., an initial increase with PC71BM addition with the maximum value observed for the 8:6:2 sample, and then a gradual decrease with further increase of PC71BM content. The polymer (100) lamellar spacing in both IP and OoP direction is maximum for the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary blend sample and then falls monotonically from 21.5 Å to 20.7 Å as the blend PC71BM content increases. In contrast, the ITIC-Th (00l), polymer, and ITIC-Th π–π d-spacings are found to be essentially unaffected by blend composition. Overall, the molecular orientation, stacking distance, crystalline information obtained from the GIWAXS measurements is largely consistent with the GIXRD data (see details in ESI), AFM, and STEM results. The molecular orientation and vertical phase separation of the crystalline domains in the binary and ternary BHJ films are illustrated in Fig. 3e. In PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blends, PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th exhibit mainly π-face-on orientation. The optimal incorporation of PC71BM into PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary system retains the original π-face-on molecular orientation and crystallinity. As the PC71BM content is increased in ternary systems, excessive incorporation of PC71BM into PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th alters PBDB-TF orientation to π-edge-on relative to electrode, decreases ITIC-Th crystallinity, and increases large scale PC71BM aggregations. In PBDB-TF:PC71BM blend, PBDB-TF exhibits π-edge-on orientation with PC71BM-induced polymer crystallization.
Surface-sensitive NEXAFS spectroscopy was next employed to quantify the composition of the BHJ top surface. All samples show a polymer-rich top surface (Fig. 3d), similar to our previous observations in amorphous polymer-semi-crystalline acceptor BHJ PBDT(Ar)-FTTE:ITIC-Th and semi-crystalline polymer-crystalline acceptor BHJ PBDB-TF:Y6 films. This unique vertical phase separation is beneficial to the inverted solar cell structure implemented here. The polymer enrichment is slightly lower in the PBDB-TF:PC71BM binary (70%) compared to the binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th or the ternary samples, and the BHJ upper surface composition of different blend films are shown in Fig. 3d. The trend in surface composition also indicates that PBDB-TF has a lower miscibility with ITIC-Th, as compared to PC71BM, which is also in accord with the RSoXS results (vide infra).

Molecular single crystal packing provides insight into how molecules organize in a thermal environment, and can assist in understanding ITIC-Th nanoscale molecular packing, charge separation, charge transport properties in neat and BHJ blend films, especially for the crystalline domains in films. Previously, we observed short π–π distances between end-groups/cores in IT(z)N-C9,ITIC-nF,IT(z)N-F4, and Y6 acceptor crystals, and found this kind of π-face-on packing in crystalline domains of spin-coated neat and BHJ films. Considering the currently limited ITIC-Th single crystal data reported in literature, single crystals of ITIC-Th were grown here by diffusing acetone vapor into dibromomethane solution (see ESI, for details). ITIC-Th molecules crystallize in a triclinic unit cell (deposited CCDC No. 2181313) with a = 8.7612(11) Å, b = 13.2409(16) Å, c = 17.624(2) Å, α = 93.211(6)°, β = 98.646(6)°, γ = 97.221(6)°, different from the previously reported monoclinic polymorph. In the present results, the thiophene ring and long alkyl side chain stretch between molecular layers. Similar to most IC-based NFAs, the sulfur⋯oxygen conformational locks are also found in ITIC-Th. But interestingly within the crystal network of ITIC-Th, end group (EG)–EG stacking (Fig. 4d) is only present at the edge of the unit cell through the stacking of two malononitrile groups (Fig. 4c and d, red dot rectangle, 3.49 Å), which is uncommon in other ITIC-based NFAs in which the stackings mostly involve the aromatic regions. As such, the computed electronic couplings (vide infra) suggest the EG–EG couplings (10 meV) in the ITIC-Th crystal networks are smaller than in other ITIC-based NFAs.

In contrast to most other IT-based NFAs, the interaction distance between the oxygen atom of the IC EG and the sulfur atom of the thiophene unit (Dso, Fig. 4a) of the ITIC-Th is 2.70 Å, larger than in most other ITIC-based NFAs, indicating a weak intramolecular planarity of ITIC-Th (Fig. 4a). Confirmed by viewing along the IT-backbone plane in the crystal network (Fig. 4b, green plane), the EG is tilted 38.1° from the plane of the IT-backbone. Along with the absence of EG–EG stacking in ITIC-Th, the thiophene sidechain of ITIC-Th plays an essential role in organizing the crystal network of ITIC-Th. Surprisingly, two types of stacking motifs are observed in the ITIC-Th crystal network, (1) horizontal π-face-on sidechain–thiophene (sTh)–sTh stacking (Fig. 4c, blue dot line, 3.39 Å); (2) vertical π-edge-on sTh–EG stacking (Fig. 4c, red dot line, 3.42 Å). It is interesting that all four thiophene sidechains of each ITIC-Th molecule participate in forming these two types of stacking motifs. To confirm this observation, we calculated the distance from the S atom of the sidechain thiophene ring to the IT-backbone plane (Fig. 4b). Two different distances are obtained, 1.46 Å for the sidechain with sTh–sTh stacking, 1.40 Å from the sidechain with sTh–EG stacking. This observation confirms that two types of atomic interaction influence the thiophene sidechain orientation, and thus all the thiophene sidechains of ITIC-Th participate in this stacking motif construction. Note that although most stacking motifs in the ITIC-Th crystal structure involve the thiophene sidechain, the ITIC-Th blends still deliver substantial photovoltaic performance. Considering that the highly twisted core–EG configuration is less favorable for electron transport, and the sidechain-based stacking does not exhibit strong computed electronic couplings, we hypothesize that the predominant intermolecular ITIC-Th charge transport may be via unexpected malonitrile EG stacking of two ITIC-Th molecules, and transport proceeds via two unit cells. This hypothesis is supported by DFT modeling (vide infra).

RSoXS was next performed to quantify the phase separation size scales in the two binary blends as well as the ternary 8:6:2, and 8:3:5 blend films. Note here that in case of binary blends there is only one material contrast function arising from the single pair of materials. However, for ternary blends the three different materials result in three different material contrast functions with different energy dependencies. The three material contrast functions are shown in Fig. S25 (ESI). In Fig. 5, the 1D RSoXS profiles from the two binary and ternary 8:6:2 and 8:3:5 blends are shown. The peak positions and overall profile shapes for both PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th and 8:6:2 ternary blends suggest that the size scales present in the two systems are similar. For all the samples, a high-q peak at q ≈ 0.4 nm−1 is observed, corresponding to a size scale of ≈15 nm, in excellent agreement with the LAADF-STEM results if we interpret it as arising from a long period of polymer-rich domains. Additionally, a peak at a lower q value is observed for all the blends, and its position varies with blend composition. For binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th and ternary 8:6:2 samples, the low-q peak corresponds to large ≈150 nm to 200 nm-scale domains seen in LAADF-STEM images (Fig. S16, ESI) that are likely ITIC-Th-rich. As blend PC71BM content is increased, the low-q peak position falls to ≈0.15 nm−1 (size scale ≈40 nm) in ternary 8:3:5, implying that besides affecting ITIC-Th crystallinity, PC71BM addition also results in ITIC-Th-rich domain size reduction. The lower-q peak in the 8:3:5 blend likely arises from polymer:acceptor mixed regions. The position of the low-q peak again increases with further addition of PC71BM to ≈0.08 nm−1 (size scale ≈80 nm) in the binary PBDB-TF:PC71BM blend and likely arises from large scale PC71BM-rich and/or polymer-PC71BM mixed regions. Further analysis of the RSoXS data is not possible with currently available analysis frameworks because those methods assume two phases. For example, it is not appropriate to perform RSoXS “relative domain purity” estimations that are frequently correlated to device performance, because with a potential number of phases greater than two, changes in scattering intensity are ambiguous with respect to which phases or components are implicated. Contributions from orientation contrast and mass roughness are also possible. Even without orientation effects, and assuming three phases plus roughness creating a fourth vacuum phase, there are N × (N − 1)/2 = 4 × 3/2 = 6 binary contrasts to consider. Model fitting of the RSoXS data will not yield reliable results since it is not clear which phases are responsible for which scattering features. We anticipate that the detailed energy dependence of RSoXS data might, in the future, support analysis frameworks that separate such effects.


With a clear picture of solar cell and single carrier diode device performance, BHJ film morphology and molecular nanoscale packing, femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy was next performed on the binary and ternary blends to determine the reason for differences in their efficiencies, therefore to strengthen the connection between BHJ film crystalline morphology, charge dynamics, and device performances. Following selective photoexcitation of ITIC-Th at λ = 720 nm, the rate of hole transfer from the ITIC-Th to PBDB-TF was monitored by the appearance of the ground state polymer bleach at λ = 580 nm (Fig. 6). Excitation at λ = 720 nm was chosen to suppress the many possible photophysical pathways from the photoexcited polymer that can obscure the hole transfer dynamics. Since the acceptor bleach (ca. 700 nm) will be present for all populations of acceptor excited states regardless of their ability to charge transfer, monitoring the polymer bleach after selectively exciting ITIC-Th thus provides an unambiguous probe of the charge separation, while avoiding the overlapping signals associated with the acceptor excited-state and carrier photoinduced absorptions in the redder portions of the spectrum (>800 nm). Fig. 6 shows that the rate of hole transfer in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend with a larger concentration of PC71BM is significantly slower (k1 = 2.7 × 1012 s−1, Fig. S27, ESI) than in the blends with a lower fullerene concentration (k1 = 4.5 × 1012 s−1, Fig. S28, ESI). This likely reflects the high PC71BM concentration reducing interfacial contact between the ITIC-Th and PBDB-TF domains (see Fig. 3e). However, the hole transfer rates in the ternary 8:6:2 blend and the binary PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend are the same (Fig. S28 and S29, ESI), but the charge collection efficiency is higher with the addition of small amounts of PC71BM (Table 1). This may reflect the broader absorption of the blend in the UV region (Fig. 1b) with the addition of PC71BM and can be a result of a favorable BHJ film morphology, as confirmed in the TEM, STEM, GIWAXS, and RSoXS measurement sections. The difference in device performance between the 8:6:2 ternary mixture and that with no PC71BM strongly suggests that the effects are morphological in nature since the addition of the fullerene does not affect the energetics of the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th pair, and absorption of PC71BM at 720 nm is very small and will not significantly contribute to the initial charge separation. Moreover, this photophysics-morphology relation in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th:PC71BM system is also observed in the PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F:PC71BM systems. In the BTBOL4F-based binary and ternary blends, the TA data for the PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F binary blend excited at λ = 830 nm show ultrafast hole transfer to the polymer, with the PBDB-TF bleach intensifying with a rate constant of k1 ∼ 7.7 × 1011 s−1 (Fig. S37, ESI). Note that the TA data on the PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F binary blend film excited at λ = 760 nm is shown in our previous report, and the ultrafast hole transfer is observed within 300 fs. Addition of PC71BM accelerates the hole transfer in the PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F:PC71BM ternary blends, as the bleach deepens with k1 ∼ 2 × 1012 s−1 and 3 × 1012 s−1 (Fig. S35 and S36, ESI) rate constants for the ternary 8:6:2 and 8:3:5 blends, respectively. Again, because of the similar donor–acceptor energetics, this observation indicates a similar alteration of the interfacial contact between the polymer and acceptor regions of the films. Interestingly, the TA result is also confirmed by the film morphology data (Fig. S22–S24, ESI). From the GIWAXS analysis of PBDB-TF:BTBOL4F:PC71BM blends, the additional fullerene results in an increased volume fraction of ordered polymer, acceptor domains, and an overall higher crystallinity of the 8:6:2 ternary blend.

Charge recombination in the photoactive layers was further evaluated quantitatively by light intensity (I) dependence measurements (Fig. S8, ESI). All the plots of VOCversus ln(I) show linear relations, and the ideality factor n can be calculated from the extracted slope nkBT/e, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the elementary charge.PBDB-TF:PC71BM, PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th, and 8:6:2 ternary blend films yield a slope of 1.85kBT/e, 1.13kBT/e, and 1.54kBT/e, respectively. This indicates that BR loss is dominant in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th blend, and adding PC71BM results in both significant contribution from Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination and BR (smaller component). The recombination between stationary charges in deep traps and oppositely charged mobile carriers was first proposed by Shockley and Read. In the same experiment, JSC follows a function as, JSC ∼ Iα, where α is an exponential factor related to device BR loss – the steeper slope implies a lower BR. Plots of PBDB-TF:PC71BM, PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th, and ternary 8:6:2 blends show α values of 0.904, 0.919, 0.923, respectively, in good agreement with the photovoltaic device performance. The results suggest that BR is suppressed in the optimal ternary 8:6:2 BHJ blend.
From the results of the TA spectroscopy, light intensity dependence measurements, and structural data over multiple length scales, we infer that the addition of small amounts of PC71BM retains the crystallinity of ITIC-Th in the ternary blend, enabling electron delocalization from ITIC-Th domains to PC71BM domains, thereby suppressing the BR of the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th FCs, and simultaneously increasing PBDB-TF:PC71BM CT pairs as new charge separation and extraction pathways. This results in enhanced FC photo-generation and thus JSC and PCE. However, excess PC71BM in turn increases absorptive losses and parasitic decay pathways (Fig. S33, ESI), such as through the PC71BM triplet state, thereby decreasing FC generation and ultimately, PCE. These conclusions are further supported by DFT computations based on the single crystal structures as discussed below.

A single ITIC-Th acceptor molecule and a short oligomer (three repeat units) of the PBDB-TF donor polymer were optimized in vacuo and the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) were visualized (Fig. S39, ESI); the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels correlate reasonably well with the CV data (Fig. 1), and their HOMO–LUMO gaps are in good agreement, 2.10 eV and 1.88 eV, respectively. Both the HOMO and the LUMO of ITIC-Th extend fully across the breadth of the π-structure, but those of PBDB-TF just touch the terminal units of the oligomer, suggesting that combining the three units is reasonable for modelling the FMO wavefunctions. The vertical ionization energy and vertical electron affinity of ITIC-Th are 6.39 eV and 2.74 eV, respectively, which are ideal for NFA to pair with a donor such as PBDB-TF. Furthermore, the ITIC-Th internal hole and electron reorganization energies are 180 meV and 170 meV, respectively, in good agreement with similar NFA structures.

The ITIC-Th single crystal data were next analyzed by DFT (see Methods and the ESI), to analyze electronic coupling between pairs of molecules, to probe pathways for charge transfer and the extent of intermolecular interaction in the solid phase. The process involves the identification of a molecule with the maximum number of near-neighbors around it in the single crystal (high symmetry point, labeled as A). Every neighbor is also labelled and the coupling between each pair consisting of structure A and a neighbor, such as AB, AC… etc., is computed (Fig. 7a). The couplings |J|, presented in Fig. 7b, show that the highest electronic coupling occurs in two pairs, AD (|J| = 9.78 meV) and AM (|J| = 9.80 meV), with the latter being the maximum coupling |Jmax|.
This is not far from the basic ITIC structure (|J| = 16.14 meV), but is more than half that of Y6 (|J| = 37.9 meV). The electronic couplings were investigated further, by optimizing dimers of ITIC-Th and PBDB-TF (Fig. S40, ESI) and PC71BM. We find that the PDBD-TF:ITIC-Th optimized dimer has an electronic coupling of just 1.94 meV (Fig. 7c, left), while the ITIC-Th:PC71BM dimer is 20.9 meV (Fig. 7c, right). This might seem surprising at first, as one might expect stronger coupling between the donor polymer PBDB-TF and the ITIC-Th NFA, yet in our previous studies we found that the coupling is greatest between acceptor–acceptor moieties, reflecting the nature of the charge transport through these channels. Here then, the larger coupling correlates with the experimental observations that the ternary blend exhibits higher solar cell performance and SCLC electron mobility than binary blends.
The FMOs of these dimer structures were next computed and are illustrated in Fig. S44 (ESI). In both systems, the LUMO is localized on the ITIC-Th structure, while the HOMO is localized on the PBDB-TF and the PC71BM moieties. This supports the transient absorption data and photophysical model (Fig. 6) that following excitation of ITIC-Th and hole transfer to the PBDB-TF, the remaining electron from the charged-separated state will preferentially reside on the ITIC-Th, followed by delocalization to PC71BM. The excited-state electronic structure of the three molecules used in the device were therefore examined using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT, see Methods). Using the transition density matrix, we calculated the natural transition orbitals (NTOs) for both PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th. The excited states of PC71BM have been calculated previously using numerous levels of theory and DFT functionals. The NTOs for PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th are shown in Fig. S45 (ESI), with the PBDB-TF oligomer shown for n = 3 monomers. The NTOs of the hole and electron are illustrated separately for each molecule. Both PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th have π → π* character for the first excitation S1 (Fig. S45, ESI), although the PBDB-TF has some CT character. In contrast, ITIC-Th has a pure π → π* transition as seen by the resemblance to the HOMO and LUMO in Fig. S39 (ESI). The transition density matrix was further examined to visualize the size of the hole and electron (see ESI, for details). The electron (hole) size for ITIC-Th is 7.6 Å (7.0 Å), while for PBDB-TF the size is about 50% larger at 11.0 Å (11.1 Å). Analyzing the separation between the electron and hole we find the distance is marginally larger for PBDB-TF as well with a separation of 6.7 Å vs. 6.5 Å.
The natural transition orbitals (NTOs) of the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th and ITIC-Th:PC71BM heterodimers were next computed to understand the charge separation capacity at the interfaces. Using the geometries obtained from the optimized dimers in Fig. 7, it is found that the heterodimers have many low-lying dark CT character excitations along with a weak oscillator strength S1 excitation (see ESI). We represent the two lower lying CT character excited states for each heterodimer (S2 and S4) in Fig. 7d using the NTOs of the transition density. Compared to the FMOs of the dimer structures (Fig. S42–S44, ESI), the NTO excitations have strong CT character but with minimal oscillator strength. Importantly, the energies are within the exciton energy range of PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th (Fig. S45, ESI). Note also that the CAM-B3LYP functional used in the TDDFT calculations is known to introduce a significant blue shift (≈0.3 eV) leading to a mismatch of singlet state energies versus the fsTA bleach at 720 nm. This low-lying CT character for excited states matches up well with the fsTA spectra (FC-1 to FC-2, Fig. 6a) that show near isoenergetic FC states as the carriers delocalize across the interface. Overall, the theory and simulation results support the 1D charge transport via the malonitrile EG stacking in ITIC-Th molecules, high μe, and the photophysics model in ternary blend films.

The results of this study reveal a general relationship between BHJ film morphology and charge-dynamics performance in the binary and ternary BHJ blends of organic semiconductors. We have shown here that the optimal incorporation of PC71BM into the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary system retains the original π-face-on molecular orientations relative to the device electrodes, ITIC-Th crystallinity, BHJ domain dimensions, and decreases the BHJ film upper surface ITIC-Th content. It does not significantly affect the overall morphology of the PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary blend. While these morphology changes increase hole and electron mobilities simultaneously, they also facilitate electron delocalization from ITIC-Th to PC71BM domains, reduce FC bimolecular recombination, increase another FC extraction pathway through the PBDB-TF:PC71BM pair, therefore resulting in significantly enhanced inverted solar cell JSC and FF. Interestingly, we observe that as the PC71BM content is increased, excessive incorporation of PC71BM into PBDB-TF:ITIC-Th binary system alters PBDB-TF orientation to π-edge-on relative to the electrode, diminishes ITIC-Th rich regions, decreases ITIC-Th crystallinity, while increasing large scale PC71BM-rich aggregates and BHJ top surface PC71BM content. These morphology changes promote parasitic photon loss pathways through the PC71BM-rich domains, thereby compromising JSC, FF, and PCE significantly. By increasing the PC71BM content and decreasing the NFA content, the ternary JSC and FF decrease first, then increase, and finally decrease with mostly unchanged VOCs, leading to synchronous PCE fluctuation, and the optimal polymer:NFA:fullerene blending weight ratio for high PCE is found to be 8:6:2. This correlation with device performance indicates that a high ITIC-Th crystallinity and presence of large ITIC-Th-rich regions is key to maximizing PSC performance. Single crystal X-ray diffraction of ITIC-Th reveals two novel types of sidechain-supported π–π stackings and provides an example of long-distance (>4 Å) coupling between EGs. Based on the experimentally determined ITIC-Th crystal and PC71BM crystal structures, DFT calculations find that the electronic coupling between neighbors of ITIC-Th molecules (≈10 meV) is half as large as the coupling within an ITIC-Th:PC71BM dimer (20.9 meV). The LUMO density also preferentially resides on the ITIC-Th unit, rather than on the PBDB-TF or PC71BM units, supporting the hypothesis that the electron generated via charge separation resides on the ITIC-Th structure before delocalization and subsequent 1D charge transport to PC71BM. Regarding the generality of this model, we find that JSC, FF, and PCE enhancement is also observed in the Y6-skeleton-based NFA BTBOL4F BHJ blends and affords significantly enhanced PSC performance, achieving high PCEs ≈ 17%. Overall, these types of structure-performance correlations and mechanistic understandings should benefit the soft matter solar research community and will stimulate attempts to achieve higher organic solar cell PCEs >20% in the future.


Experimental details can be found in ESI, Appendix.


Solar cell fabrication, current density–voltage (J–V), external quantum efficiency (EQE), light intensity dependence measurements, and data processing were conducted following the standard procedure in this Laboratory as described in a previous report. Single carrier diode device fabrication, measurements, and data processing were performed following the standard procedure in this laboratory as described in a previous report.


AFM tapping mode measurements were conducted on a SPID Bruker ICON, and blend films were prepared using the same conditions as for PSC device fabrication.


TEM specimens were prepared on PSS-covered glass substrates, using identical conditions as the actual PSC devices (see details in the solar cell fabrication section). The PSS layer was cast onto glass substrates (VWR) from mass fraction of 18% poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) water solution (Sigma-Aldrich 561223-500G) after filtering through a Nylon filter (0.45 μm), spin-coated at 5000 rpm (524 rad s−1) 30 s, ACL = 6000, and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min in air. The substrates were transferred to deionized water and the floated organic films were transferred onto the copper TEM grid with a lacey carbon coating (Ted Pella, Inc.). TEM images were obtained on a Hitachi HT7700 microscope in the bright field mode at an acceleration of 120 kV.


LAADF-STEM images of each specimen were collected using an FEI Titan 80–300 STEM (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon) equipped with a double-hexapole spherical aberration corrector (CEOS GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and an annular dark-field detector (Model 3000, E. A. Fischione Instruments, Export, Pennsylvania). A small (3 mrad) probe-forming aperture was used and the post-specimen optics were configured such that the ADF detector inner and outer angles were 17 mrad and 95 mrad, respectively. A low spot number was used to produce an electron probe containing a current of approximately 45 pA when using the small probe-forming aperture. A 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT) was calculated from each image (Scipy, fftpack).


GIXRD measurements were conducted on a Rigaku Smartlab with monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å). Omega was set as 0.2, while 2θ was scanned from 2° to 30°. Data analysis was in OriginPro 9 software, and diffraction peaks were fitted with Bragg's equation n × λ = 2d × sinθ to obtain lamellar (d100) and π–π (d010) stacking distances, respectively. All the films were prepared on ZnO/Si substrates.


GIWAXS was measured at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light source (SSRL) beamline 11-3 and at the 11-BM Complex Materials Scattering (CMS) beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). At SSRL the samples were placed in a He-filled chamber, and an X-ray energy of 12.7 keV and sample to detector distance of 340 mm, at an incident angle of 0.12°. The images were recorded with a 2D X-ray detector (MX225, Rayonix LLC) with a pixel size of 73 μm (3072 × 3072 pixels). GIWAXS measurements at CMS were performed with a beam energy of 13.5 keV. The 2D scattering patterns were collected at an X-ray incidence angle of 0.14° with a Pilatus 1 M detector with a pixel size of 172 μm and placed about 250 mm from the sample. Data were analyzed using the Nika package for Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Inc.). In this work, the polar angle (χ) is defined as the angle of the observed diffraction from the normal to the substrate. Thus, χ = 0° is perpendicular to the substrate and χ = 90° is parallel to the substrate. The out-of-plane sector is considered at 0 to 20°, and the in-plane sector is 70 to 90°. GIWAXS pole figures were constructed from the 2D data after correcting for ITIC-Th mass fractions, sample thickness, missing wedge, as well as detector solid angle effects. Sector-averaged 1D profiles were obtained from 15° cake sectors in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Coherence lengths were obtained by multi-peak fitting of the profiles using multiple Gaussian peaks on a polynomial background. At first the neat samples were fitted following the above procedure. Peak positions and widths were obtained from neat films were then used as starting values to fit the data from the blends.


This resonant scattering technique exploits the optical contrast between the polymer and ITIC-Th molecules near the carbon 1s absorption edge. The scattering contrast for a 2-component system is directly proportional to Δδ122 + Δβ122, where the complex refractive index n = 1 − δ + iβ. The real part of the complex refractive index (1 − δ) is related to dispersion and the imaginary part (β) is related to absorption. The scattering arises from composition correlations weighted by scattering contrast and respective volume fractions of these correlations. The scattering profile is the Fourier transform of the scattering density in a sample with the dominant peak representing the domain spacing or the median size scale.

RSoXS measurements were performed in transmission geometry at the ALS beamline 11.0.1.2. BHJ active layers were cast on 2 cm × 2 cm Si/PEDOT:PSS substrate. Blends were prepared using the same conditions as PSC devices. RSoXS samples of the BHJ films were prepared by a wet floatation method. The films were scored with a scalpel and then introduced to a bath of deionized water. The bottom-most sacrificial organic layer (PSS) was dissolved leaving the BHJ active layer floating on the water surface. The floating films were then transferred onto a 100 nm Si3N4 window (Norcada) for RSoXS measurements. The 2D data were collected using an in-vacuum [base pressure ≈10−9 kPa (10−8 mBar)] CCD detector (PIMTE, Princeton Instruments, 2048 × 2048 pixels). 1D scattering profiles were obtained from the 2D scattering patterns using a custom Nika. 11 analysis package and normalized for the instantaneous X-ray flux.

X-ray absorption measurements in partial electron yield (PEY) mode were performed at the Soft X-ray Spectroscopy beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. Linearly polarized photons (P ≈ 1) from an undulator X-ray source with spectral resolution of E/ΔE ≤ 10000 were focused to a beam size of ≈100 μm × 100 μm onto samples in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber. PEY spectra were measured using a channeltron detector. NEXAFS samples were prepared on 2 cm × 2 cm Si substrate under identical conditions as those for the optimized PSC devices and analyzed using the QANT analysis package. The recorded spectra were normalized to the incident photon flux using a gold mesh and further normalized by setting the pre-edge signal in the range (270 to 275) eV to 0 and normalizing the post-edge signal in the range (335 to 340) eV to 1. Surface composition was determined by fitting a linear combination of neat reference spectra to blend spectra acquired at the magic incidence angle of ≈54.7°.


UV-vis spectra of the samples were obtained on a Varian Cary 100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Films were spincast onto clean glass substrates (VWR).


Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fsTA) experiments were performed using a regeneratively-amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (Tsunami Oscillator/Spitfire Pro amplifier, Spectra-Physics) as previously described. Briefly, the UV-vis continuum probe (λ ∼ 400–800 nm) was generated by focusing the λ = 827 nm fundamental (100 fs, 2 μJ) into a 2 mm sapphire plate. The NIR continuum probe (λ ∼ 850 nm to 1600 nm) was generated by focusing the λ = 827 nm fundamental (100 fs, 3 μJ) into a 10 mm proprietary crystal (Ultrafast Systems, LLC). The samples were irradiated at λex = 720 nm with ≈110 fs, 0.12 μJ pulses of 1 mm spot size with randomized polarization (DPU-25-A, Thorlabs, Inc.) to suppress observation of polarizartion-dependent dynamics. The λex = 720 nm excitation pulse was generated with a home-built optical parametric amplifier. Transient spectra were acquired with 3 s averaging at each time delay point. The fsTA data were corrected for group delay dispersion, or chirp, and scattered light prior to the analysis using Surface Xplorer (Ultrafast Systems, LLC).


Structural optimizations of the acceptors ITIC-Th and PC71BM were computed using DFT in ORCA The B3LYP functional was used in conjunction with a dispersion correction using Grimme's third generation dispersion with Becke Johnson damping (D3BJ). We used a triple zeta valence (TZV), s and p larger polarization set (PP) Karlsruhe type basis set (def2-TZVPP) as developed by Weigend and Ahlrich. This level of theory for the DFT calculations was used in the calculation of vacuum energies, frontier molecular orbitals, vertical ionization energies, vertical electron affinities, and internal reorganization energies for ITIC-Th and PC71BM. Details of molecular orbital visualization are presented in the ESI.

The structure of the PBDB-TF polymer was simplified to three repeat units and optimized using DFT. This provided satisfactory orbital energies in correlation with values obtained from cyclic voltammetry. The dimers were obtained from taking the optimized individual structures (PBDB-TF, ITIC-Th, PC71BM) and added their coordinates together by hand at centrally placed and co-facial to each other with an assumed π–π separation of ≈3.4 Å. These dimer coordinates were then optimized without any constraint. The electronic couplings for the ITIC-Th single crystal and the dimers were computed as described in ref. 50. For further details of the dimer construction and structural optimizations see the ESI.
Excited state calculations on the PBDB-TF and ITIC-Th monomers, and PC71BM:ITIC-Th dimer were performed with the Q-Chem package using TD-DFT. The TD-DFT functional CAM-B3LYP was used to account for the long-range hole-electron interaction. Details are provided in the ESI (Section 14).
