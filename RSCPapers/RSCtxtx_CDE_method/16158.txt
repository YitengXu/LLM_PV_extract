Being fluorine-free and a high performance material as a small organic acceptor molecule, BTP-eC9 has been well mixed with BDT-based PM6 donor polymers for providing satisfactory photovoltaic properties, especially towards future large scale/large area solar cell production. However, as one of the key electrical outputs from such binary active layer materials, the open circuit voltage (VOC) was limited to ca. 0.84 V, which needs to be further improved for BTP-eC9 to have a bright future. This paper focuses on the molecular design of alkylthio- and alkoxy-phenyl flanked benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-based conjugated polymers (PBDT-PS-ttTPD or P10 for short and PBDT-PO-ttTPD or P11), which were successfully synthesized and applied as donor materials for pairing with BTP-eC9 in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. By fine-tuning the side chains of the benzodithiophene (BDT) moiety, such non-fullerene OPV devices with normal configuration demonstrate an attractively high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 and 0.87 V in P10/BTP-eC9 and P11/BTP-eC9 based binary single bulk heterojunction OPV devices, while still maintaining an excellent JSC of 22.7 and 20.0 mA cm−2 with a final power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.93% and 9.37%, respectively. The alkylthio-phenyl chain substituted BDT polymer exhibits better photovoltaic performance in all aspects than the alternative with alkoxy chains due to the synergistic effect of the alkylthio-phenyl flanked BDT, TPD, and π-bridge (thieno[3,2-b]thiophene).

Neither research nor development of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) could be feasibly continued worldwide until 2015 when “suddenly” a star molecule termed ITIC was first reported by Lin and Zhan et al., and in the next two years, a brand new family of small molecule non-fullerene acceptor (SM NFA) materials enabled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to be increased from 6.8% to a new plateau of ca. 13–14% when paired with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based PBDB-T. Again, since just 2019, based on the second renaissance of SM NFAs initiated by Yuan and Zou et al. to develop the current state-of-the-art Y-series compounds, PCEs of organic solar cells (OSCs) have been further boosted from 15.7% to close to or above 19% nowadays. Among these, BTP-eC9 (a structural analogue of the popular BTP-4Cl (Y7)), being a greener candidate free from fluorine sources, features enhanced intermolecular ordering compared to Y6 or Y7 acceptors and chlorinated end groups which give the material synergistically deep HOMO and LUMO levels due to the modification of the alkyl chains. Therefore, it has been recognized as one of the most promising Y-acceptors and has a bright future for OSC production in a large scale and large area. As its counterpart, the donor materials that have been paired with it have been dominated by fluorinated PBDB-T (PM6) and similar polymers, exhibiting complimentary optical absorbance, matched energy levels between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the PM6 donor and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the Y-type acceptor, and controlled morphologies. Despite their record breaking PCE values, the non-ideal VOC of below 0.84 V still reflects the imperfect molecular design of PM6 or similar backbone structures for ideal control of their HOMO/LUMO levels. As is well known, the absorption bands, carrier mobility, crystallization, and morphology of bulk-heterojunction layers are closely related to the short circuit current (JSC), while the energy level difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor corresponds to the open circuit voltage (VOC). Both JSC and VOC are vital parameters that affect the PCE of OSCs. Compared with JSC and FF, VOC is the most predictable photovoltaic parameter of polymers when conceiving the molecular structure. For donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers, the choice of strongly electron-withdrawing A units is the most efficient pathway for tuning the HOMO. However, there is a problem that cannot be ignored, i.e., the high VOC comes at the expense of weak JSC, which is extremely destructive to the PCE of OSCs. Rational energy-level adjustment is a suitable optimization strategy. To date, rational molecular designs for both high VOC and large JSC are still ambiguous. Based on the balance between the weak electron pushing effect and moderate π-electron accepting ability of the 3d-orbitals at the aryl or allyl position, the alkylthio group was originally introduced into MEH-PPV by Hou et al. for deeper HOMO levels. This was followed by alkylthiolation of 1-D BDT by Ferraris et al. and of the 2-D conjugated BDT moiety by Li et al. and Hou et al.; PBDTT-S-TT and PBDT-TS1 highlighted a useful design strategy for lowering the HOMO levels of D–A polymers and exhibited improved VOC of 0.84 V and 0.80 V, resulting in PCEs of 8.42% and 9.48%, respectively. Recently, the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit as the electron acceptor moiety in D–A copolymers was reported to afford deeper HOMOs and more appropriate band gaps for absorption, complementing typical low-bandgap small molecular non-fullerene acceptors (SM-NFAs) when coupled with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT). Moreover, side chain modification of the BDT moiety could also achieve the same goal. And now a lot of work on thiophene-flanked modification of BDT has shown that it successfully increased the VOC, affording higher PCE. Thereafter, copolymer materials containing BDT units with phenyl flanking groups were demonstrated to have deeper HOMO levels and a higher VOC in the corresponding photovoltaic devices than those with thiophene substitutes, because of the weaker electron donor ability and the higher ionization potential of the phenyl-flanked BDT moiety. However, until now there have been few papers discussing the effect of alkyl side chain modification in phenyl-flanked BDT units on the photovoltaic performance of NFA OSCs.

In this work, we designed BDT- and TPD-based conjugated polymer donors to afford high VOC for OSCs. To avoid the issue of overregulated HOMOs, we inserted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the π-bridge between the BDT and TPD moieties, which could tune the absorption bandgap, HOMO/LUMO, crystallinity of active layers and π–π conjugated structure of the polymer backbone to improve charge carrier mobility, fill factor (FF) value and JSC. To investigate the effect of different alkyl-chalcogen side-chains on the photovoltaic performance of BDT- and TPD-based OSCs, two copolymers with PBDT-PX-ttTPD structures, where X is an alkylthio or alkoxy side chain, were successfully synthesized and both exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance in single-junction SM-NFA OSCs when paired with BTP-eC9. As expected, the copolymers both showed broad absorption from 300 to 700 nm, and good hole mobilities of 3.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-PS-ttTPD (P10) and 3.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-PO-ttTPD (P11). Additionally, the OSCs based on P10 as the donor and BTP-eC9 as the acceptor demonstrated a PCE of up to 12.93% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 22.71 mA cm−2 and an FF of 63.81% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination.

The alkylthio- and alkoxy-phenyl segments were introduced to the BDT backbone as substituted conjugated side chains to build two-dimensional BDT-type polymers. As shown in Scheme 1, the BDT-based copolymers, PBDT-PS-ttTPD and PBDT-PO-ttTPD, which were named P10 and P11, were obtained through the Stille coupling reactions between monomers of bis-stannyl salts of alkylthiolated phenyl BDT (M1) or alkoxy-phenyl BDT (M2) and dibrominated TT-TPD, respectively. All synthetic and structural details of the monomers and copolymers are recorded in the ESI. The copolymer P11 readily dissolved in chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), while P10 exhibited mediocre solubility. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) of 10.4 kDa and 2.01 for P10 and 7.7 kDa and 1.88 for P11 were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and are listed in Table 1.

The thermal stability of the copolymers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S5b (ESI), the decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss of P10 and P11 were 353 °C and 419 °C, respectively, exhibiting their reasonably good thermal stability for OSC applications. UV-vis absorption spectra of the two copolymers were acquired for both dilute CF solutions (0.01 mg mL−1) and spin-coated films on quartz substrates at ambient and elevated temperatures as shown in Fig. 1a, c and d, respectively. The wavelengths (λedge) at the absorption edge were found to be 663 and 656 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.87 and 1.89 eV, respectively, as summarized in Table 1, which are all comparable to those of structurally analogous TPD-based polymers. In both solution and film, P10 and P11 both presented comparable strong and broad absorption in the region from ca. 300 to 660 nm, with no commonly visible bathochromic shifts of the maximum absorption, implying effective aggregation of polymer segments in the solution phase. This would be attributed to the strong intermolecular interactions caused by packing of alkylthio- and alkoxy-phenyl side chains. Compared to the weak absorption for the π–π* transition below 400 nm, the intense absorption peak at ca. 540 nm in solution, arising from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between BDT (as a donor) and TPD (as an acceptor) moieties, indicates good electron push–pull effects between them. The strong intermolecular π–π stacking indicated by the absorption peak at ca. 601 nm for P10 and 597 nm for P11 can be expected to facilitate intermolecular charge transport, which has been explored in many OSC polymers. Such strong π–π stacking in P10 has also been experimentally evidenced by its relatively poor solubility in CF/CB or o-CB at ambient temperature. This is further demonstrated by the higher peak absorbance ratios between the π–π stacking band and ICT band for P10 and P11 when comparing them with well-known native or modified PM6, which again suggests molecular aggregation effects of alkylthiolation and alkoxylation on the phenyl units of the BDT side chains. A subtle bathochromic shift of 4 nm in the maximum absorption peak value for P10 was manifested in the shoulder absorption peaks, which demonstrated that the thiol-modified polymer had highly effective aggregation behavior. Considering the combined weak electron donating and moderate π-electron accepting capability as described in the introduction, while the alkoxy side chain is typically a strong electron-donating group, the electron cloud of the alkoxy-phenyl flanking group is denser than that of the alkylthio-phenyl flanking group, which indicates higher intermolecular repulsion potential between the two π-conjugation planes of the copolymer backbone. This is in fact directly reflected by the chemical shifts of the two ortho-H atoms in the NMR spectra of M1 and M2; the former with alkylthio chains exhibits a higher chemical shift (7.52 ppm) than the latter (7.13 ppm), proving that these protons are more deshielded which therefore results in higher electron density on the aromatic moieties. The temperature dependence of macromolecular aggregation was investigated via a UV-vis absorption study on both P10 and P11 in dilute CB solution at different temperatures as shown in Fig. 1. The spectra exhibit remarkable blue shifts, revealing aggregate formation at ambient temperature and subsequent dissociation at elevated temperatures. In the meantime, we notice that, on the one hand the intensity ratios between the peak- and shoulder-absorption for both P10 and P11 declined, indicating weaker agglomeration at elevated temperatures; on the other hand, such ratios for P10 are always higher than those for P11, proving stronger π–π stacking behavior for P10 in CB solution. In contrast, the π–π stacking absorption of P11 (Fig. 1d) gradually vanished with increasing temperature, because the high-temperature heating provided sufficient potential energy for promoting disaggregation of π–π stacking under the synergistic effect of the strong intermolecular repulsion potential. In spite of the different aggregation behavior of these two copolymers, their optical absorption bandgaps in solution and thin films are all quite comparable, implying possibly similar JSC, due to their comparable abilities of harvesting solar photons.


To investigate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the two copolymers, the thin-film electrochemical characteristics of P10 and P11 were studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S5a, ESI) and the details are provided in the ESI. The energy alignment of the HOMO/LUMO levels of the copolymers and the SM acceptor is illustrated in Fig. 1b and their optical band gaps are listed in Table 1. The onset oxidation potentials (EOX) of P10 and P11 were 0.88 and 0.85 V, which correspond to HOMO levels of −5.33 and −5.30 eV, respectively. The HOMO of P10 was ∼0.03 eV deeper than that of P11, indicating that alkylthio-phenyl side chains had a greater electron-drawing effect than alkoxy-phenyl substituents for BDT-based copolymers. Hence, a P10-based OSC device with lower lying HOMO energy level was expected to achieve higher VOC. Because the sulfur atom has an empty d orbital, it could generate a π electron-withdrawing effect when coupling with phenyl (at the benzyl position), which is at the same time in accordance with the greater electronegativity of the sulfur atom than that of carbon, which induces a σ electron-withdrawing effect. While the alkoxy chain always exhibits a stronger p–π conjugation electron-donating effect than its induced σ electron-withdrawing one, resulting in relatively less deep HOMO levels. Compared with analogous copolymers with thienyl flanking groups, copolymers with phenyl side chains exhibit deeper HOMOs. In addition, the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the two copolymers were determined from the difference between EHOMO and Eoptg, and were found to be −3.46 eV for P10 and −3.41 eV for P11. Compared with P11, the LUMO of P10 was higher-lying and closer in energy to that of the acceptor molecule BTP-eC9 (ca. −4.05 eV). Thus, more efficient exciton dissociation could be expected in the corresponding P10-based OPV devices than P11-based ones.


To further investigate the structure–property difference between P10 and P11, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on the dimers of the two copolymers were performed by using the Gaussian 16 program with the B3LYP functional at the 6-31G(d,p) basis set level in the gas phase. To ease the computational load on the server, all the 2-octyldodecyl side chains were substituted with methylthiol and methyl groups for P10 and P11, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the simulation results demonstrated that the LUMOs of P10 and P11 were centred mainly on the tt-TPD moieties, while the HOMOs were evenly distributed along the whole π-conjugated molecular backbone. Different from BDTT-based copolymers, there was little delocalization of the wave function onto the phenyl flanking groups, which implied that the phenyl side chains contributed little to forming the 2D π-conjugated structure. Due to the intense intramolecular repulsion among the phenyl and benzodithiophene moieties, a large torsion angle (ca. ∼58°) was formed between the phenyl side chains and benzodithiophene moieties which hindered the expansion of π-conjugation along the vertical orientation of the polymer backbone. Despite the interference by the electron-donating capabilities of the alkoxy side chains, our structural modification still succeeded in deepening the HOMO/LUMO energy levels as expected. Dihedral angles were obtained from the optimal structure by DFT and are recorded in Table S1 (ESI). Those among the BDT, tt π-bridge, and TPD motifs (A1 to A6) range from 0.01 to a maximum of 6.59° for P10 and a maximum of 5.89° for P11, evidencing their nice planarity along the backbone, while much larger dihedral angles of 58 or 59° between the alkylthio- or alkoxy-phenyl moieties and BDT units for both P10 and P11 indicate a twisted and coil-like polymer conformation as a result of enhanced torsional relaxation along the backbone. This can, to some extent, be indicated by the non-visible bathochromic shifts in the absorption maxima between solutions and films for either P10 or P11 as already discussed above. This is furthermore expected to have a negative influence on the band gap properties, as the spatial steric effect will affect the π–π stacking. It is important to mention that all side-chain substituents were replaced with a methylthiol group in order to simplify the calculations; nevertheless, the side chains typically play an important role in modeling the torsion angels of conjugated polymers. Herein we used the same simplified side group for both alkylthiolated or alkoxylated phenyl substituted BDT and tt-TPD moieties, therefore the results regarding the torsion angles between BDT and tt-TPD should be reasonable. When observing the orbital distribution (Fig. 2), it unsurprisingly becomes evident that the HOMO covers more of the BDT donor units while the LUMO mainly occupies the tt-TPD acceptor motifs, strongly evidencing the synergetic effect of the weak electron-pushing and -accepting capability of the 3d-orbitals of the sulfur element on simultaneously lowering the HOMO/LUMO level of P10 compared to P11, which leads to a high VOC of 0.89 V (presented below) for solar cells made from P10.


To characterize the photovoltaic properties of the two copolymers paired with a small molecule non-fullerene acceptor (SM-NFA), organic solar cells with an active area of 0.04 cm2 were fabricated as described in detail in the ESI, with their corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves presented in Fig. 3a. The device configuration was designed as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:BTP-eC9/PFN-Br/Ag, where ITO is indium tin oxide as the anode, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate as the hole transport layer (HTL), PFN-Br as the electron transport layer (ETL) is poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammoinium-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))-dibromide, Ag is silver as the cathode, and the active layer is the bulk-heterojunction structure of the donor and acceptor with a thickness of 100 nm. In this work, the optimization of the photovoltaic performance of OPV devices was focused on varying donor/acceptor (D/A) ratios and different contents of DIO as the additive in the active layer, as listed in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI), with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 (w/w) obtained as the optimized one. For P10, both JSC and VOC are stable upon varying the D/A ratio from 1:1 to 1:1.5, while FF decreased from 55.9% to 52.4%. As for P11, it is the JSC that exhibits relatively larger D/A dependency, resulting in a significant power conversion efficiency (PCE) drop from 8.40 to 8.05%. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO), as the additive, was added to solutions at different volume ratios (vol%) to optimize the morphology of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) based OSCs, as illustrated in Table S3 (ESI). For P10-based and P11-based conventional devices, the content of DIO was adjusted from 0 to 0.5% and 0 to 1.0%, respectively; the optimal dosages of DIO were found to be 0.3% for P10 and 0.7% for P11. As shown in Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI), the former achieved both the highest FF of 63.81% and JSC of 22.71 mA cm−2, with a final highest PCE of 12.93% being obtained. In contrast, distinguished from the highly DIO-sensitive D–A system of P10, the latter P11 achieved an optimal FF of 54.07% and JSC of 19.96 mA cm−2, exhibiting a PCE of 9.37%. The best performance for P10 (no DIO, see Table S2, ESI) was obtained with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 23.00 mA cm−2, and an FF of 57.33%, affording a PCE of 11.75%. The increase in experimental VOC (∼0.02 V) caused by alkylthio-phenyl flanking groups for P10 compared with P11 with alkoxy-phenyl side chains was consistent with the predicted results for the HOMO difference. Compared with PM6/BTP-eC9-based OSCs, P10 showed the highest VOC while maintaining a reasonably good JSC. In general, high VOC and strong JSC are always contradictory for OPV devices, which must be acceptable when considering the need for either deepening the HOMO of the donors and/or lifting the LUMO level of the acceptors. But the former will enlarge the polymer's band gap energy, and the latter would result in loss of electron separation from the donor to the acceptor, which both limit the generation of JSC. Therefore, considering the JSC values of 22.71 and 19.96 mA cm−2 for P10 and P11 respectively (corresponding to their VOCs), a synergistic effect of high VOC and strong JSC was successfully achieved via incorporating alkylthiolation instead of oxylation on the thiophenyl side chains. Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 3b) curves under optimal conditions indicated that the integrated JSC was calculated to be 22.34 mA cm−2 for P10 and 19.41 mA cm−2 for P11, with the calculated JSC shown in Table 2. We can see that ca. 5% differences between the measured and calculated JSCs are observed, which can be caused by two reasons: (a) imperfect control of the direction of incident light or beam-coverage on the supposed active areas; (b) non-ideal device stability when I–V and EQE measurements were performed on different days. The former P10 based device showed a slightly higher EQE value in a much broader range (300–1000 nm) than the latter one (P11). In addition, the EQE in the medium wavelength range (450–800 nm) confirmed that the excitons generated by the P10 domains were more efficiently separated at the P10/BTP-eC9 interfaces, and the holes were effectively collected through the BTP-eC9 domains.

In addition, for better comparison, ITIC was used as an alternative electron acceptor for copolymer photovoltaic devices, with the performance shown in Fig. S4 (ESI) and data listed in Table S4 (ESI); the simple optimization of P10- and P11-based devices has already achieved the average PCE of structurally similar NFA photovoltaic modules. Noticeably, high VOC values of 1.04 and 1.00 V for P10- and P11-based OSCs were obtained, which were unsurprisingly higher than those of the BTP-eC9-based OPVs, due to the higher LUMO level of ITIC than that of BTP-eC9. However, the slightly higher (4%) VOC for the P10:ITIC based device than for the P11 based device is in good agreement with their photovoltaic performance in BTP-eC9 paired OSCs, proving that alkylthiolation on the phenyl side chains of BDT results in the same improvement compared to alkoxy substitution.
Moreover, JSC is affected by not only the optical absorption but also many other physical aspects such as charge carrier mobility, crystallinity, and morphology of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 3c, the carrier mobilities were studied by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method as detailed in the ESI, and calculated from the linear fitting results in Fig. S7 (ESI), with the hole mobility found to be 3.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P10-based OPVs and 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P11-based OPVs. While the electron mobilities were obtained as 2.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P10 and 1.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P11. It can be seen that the higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe) could facilitate enhanced JSC and FF for the corresponding P10/BTP-eC9 cells (compared with P11 based cells) as mentioned above, which is caused by the alkylthiolation on the phenyl unit. Such improved mobility can be attributed to both the previously discussed better co-planarity and π–π stacking, which can be further evidenced by X-ray diffraction studies as discussed below. The charge recombination abilities were characterized by following the instructions in the ESI, and the charge dissociation abilities (Pdiss) of the two NFA-based OSCs (see Fig. 3f) are listed in Table 3 together with their charge carrier mobilities. Obviously, the P10-based device exhibited better charge carrier mobility and charge dissociation ability compared with the P11-based device, which resulted in a higher JSC. Furthermore, the plots of light intensity against JSC and VOC for the two SM-NFA OSCs are presented in Fig. 3d and e, which could be used to describe the bimolecular recombination process inside the devices (see the ESI for more details). P10-based devices exhibit an α value of 1.01 and slope of 1.24KT/q, while P11-based devices exhibit an α value of 0.98 and slope of 1.08KT/q, indicating that little trap-assisted recombination occurred in the two kinds of devices and the bimolecular recombination could also be nearly ignored.

In the meantime, considering that either energy or voltage loss (Eloss = Eg − qVOC, Vloss = Eg/q − VOC, q is the elemental charge) is unavoidable for OSCs, we confirmed Vlosss of 0.89 V and 1.02 V, corresponding to energy losses of 0.89 eV and 1.02 eV, for P10 and P11, respectively, which are far higher than the energy loss of 0.60 eV described by Janssen et al., suggesting that there is plenty of room for further improvement of the molecular design for pairing with the BTP-eC9 acceptor. We may also reasonably suspect that such big losses could be mainly caused by the radiative and nonradiative recombination of both P10 and P11, which is obviously much less pronounced for thioalkylated P10 than oxylated P11, leading to better PV performance as discussed above.
Meanwhile, the surface morphology of D–A blended thin films was characterized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S6, ESI). The desirable root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.15 nm for P10:BTP-eC9 and 1.18 nm for the P11:BTP-eC9 blended thin film show in general low surface roughness. P10 exhibits small aggregates on the nanometer scale, proving that the phase separation of the P10-based active layer was better than that of P11 in the microscopic scale. In addition, to distinguish the molecular crystallization, arranged orientation and π-stacking of these copolymers in their thin films (without BTP-eC9), grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was applied. As shown in Fig. 4a, P10 and P10:BTP-eC9 both preferentially exhibited face-on orientations, and obviously the blended thin films exhibited a more rigid conjugated backbone with a higher degree of polymerization which induced the closer π–π stacking structure. Interestingly, when P11 was blended with BTP-eC9, the random arrangement of the polymer backbone changed to the face on orientation immediately. The size of the π-stacking polymer backbone region (qz) indicated that the P11 only thin film exhibited a loose copolymer backbone and large intermolecular distance. Nonetheless, the blended thin films had the same degree of crystallinity in the side chain stacking direction. The out-of-plane and in-plane cut patterns of all films are presented in Fig. 4c, with (010) diffraction peaks along the qz axis at 1.83, 1.76, 1.93 and 1.83 Å−1 for P10, P11, P10/BTP-eC9 and P11/BTP-eC9, respectively, which correspond to d-spacings of 3.43, 3.58, 3.25 and 3.44 Å, respectively. This result revealed that the BHJ films induced enhancement of π–π stacking along the polymer backbone after blending with the acceptor molecule. In addition, in the same figure there is an emerging signal for P10/BTP-eC9 at 1.54 Å−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 4.06 Å, which belongs to the π-stacking self-aggregation of acceptor molecules. This implied that the P10/BTP-eC9 blended BHJ films contained obvious D–A phase separation. It is notable that as shown in Fig. 4b, the diffraction peaks along the qxy axis (next to (100)) of all films demonstrated that among the different thin films, P10/BTP-eC9 exhibited novel and closer ordered lamellar packing of side chains.

In summary, two new benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene based donor–acceptor copolymers, derived from alkylthio- (for PBDT-PS-ttTPD) and alkoxy-phenyl (for PBDT-PO-ttTPD) flanked benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene and 5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione units with a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge, were successfully designed, synthesized, and applied in SM-NFA OSCs. Consistent with our design idea, the alkylthio- and alkoxy-phenyl flanking group substituted BDT-containing polymers present deeper HOMOs (−5.33 and −5.30 eV) in relation to the LUMO level of BTP-eC9, therefore both wide bandgap copolymer:BTP-eC9 based OSCs show excellent voltage output with VOC of 0.89 and 0.87 V, respectively, which is attractively higher than that of PM6 based donor polymers when paired with the state-of-the-art BTP-eC9 acceptor in single-heterojunction devices. Finally, reasonably nice PCEs of 12.93% and 9.37%, with JSC of 22.71 mA cm−2 and 19.96 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.81% and 54.07%, were achieved. Thus, we develop two new and promising PBDT-PS-TPD- and PBDT-PO-TPD-based electron donors containing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a π-bridge to construct high efficiency photovoltaic materials for pairing with the Y-series of state-of-the-art acceptors.
