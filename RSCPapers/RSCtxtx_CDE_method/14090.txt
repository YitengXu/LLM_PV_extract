Two new organic–inorganic hybrid conjugated copolymers (P10 and P11), containing different amounts of hexamolybdate clusters covalently embedded in the main chain with imide-functionalized naphthodithiophene and 3,3′-didodecyloxy bithiophene units, have been synthesized and characterized in detail. The incorporation of hexamolybdate clusters into the polymer backbones is confirmed by 1H NMR, FT-IR, gel permeation chromatography, and elemental analysis. These hybrid copolymers are capable of forming uniform thin films upon spin coating, and they show intense visible and broad near-infrared (NIR) absorptions both in CHCl3 solutions and as spin-casted thin films. Single-component solar cells based on P10, without any other added electron acceptors, show respectable power conversion efficiencies up to 0.31%. The photocurrent contribution from both the organic π-segments and the POM clusters is confirmed by the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurements. The absorption in the NIR region is found to be incapable of producing photocurrent, and the photocurrent of the solar cells is attributed exclusively to the UV and visible absorptions of the hybrid copolymers.

Conjugated polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) have gathered tremendous research attention owing to their potential to generate low-cost, clean energy with the added merits of light weight and mechanical flexibility. Fullerene derivatives are the most commonly used electron accepting and electron transporting materials in PSCs due to their good electron affinity and high electron mobility (up to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by field effect transistors). They are often blended with conjugated polymers to form bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures. To form bicontinuous transportation pathways for both electrons and holes, the weight percentage of fullerene in the composite is often 50% or higher. Fullerene derivatives are, however, very expensive to synthesize. They also have an inherent tendency to undergo post-fabrication crystallization leading to morphological instability and evolution which eventually lowers the device performance and long-term stability. It is thus desirable to find alternative acceptor materials.

Many non-fullerene electron acceptors have been explored, among which inorganic materials, such as ZnO, TiO2, and CdSe, etc., have drawn significant attention. These hybrid solar cells maintain the benefits of organic photovoltaic devices but also bring some other advantages. The inorganic materials help improve environmental stability (better photostability, for example) of the system. Some of them have much stronger light absorption than PCBM does. Some of them are able to form well-aligned nanostructures such as nanowires and nanorods which may form an efficient charge transporting pathways while maintaining large donor–acceptor interface for exciton dissociation. Continuous progress has been made in the field; however, such devices are thus far not yet competitive to polymer/fullerene blends in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE). One reason has to do with the incompatibility between inorganic and organic materials. As mentioned above, donor–acceptor blends often require a high loading ratio of both donor and acceptor components. Such high loading blends exhibit unstable morphologies as a result of the stark structural and property differences between the organic and inorganic components. Different ways have been proposed to address this issue. A first approach consists of a surface modification/passivation process by capping the inorganic surface with dyes or other small molecules containing inorganic-binding groups or ligands. A more drastic solution would be to covalently link the two components through chemical bonds. With covalent connection, it is possible to achieve controllable morphologies, improved compatibility, and close electronic interaction between the organic donor and the inorganic acceptor. One requirement to fulfill this concept is to find an inorganic material that can be covalently bonded to an organic material.
Among various inorganic electron acceptors, polyoxometalates (POM), early transition metal oxygen anion clusters, are especially attractive. POMs are well known oxidants and can accept multiple electrons. They are robust and structurally stable. Furthermore, POMs have unmatched structural and compositional diversity. Their many properties, ranging from molecular shape to solubility, charge density to redox potentials can be easily tuned. One of the POMs, the hexamolybdate cluster, is particularly appealing. It has a roughly spherical shape with a diameter around 0.8 nm which is close to that of C60 (0.7 nm); it has a reversible one electron reduction process at potentials (∼−3.5 eV in LUMO) close to that of a fullerene (∼−3.7 eV in LUMO); and it is easy and inexpensive to synthesize. More importantly, the hexamolybdate cluster can be conveniently and efficiently functionalized with one or two organo imido groups. The terminal O atom can be replaced by N atom, allowing the preparation of covalently-bonded organic–inorganic small-molecule hybrids and POM-containing polymer hybrids. Unlike those conjugated systems containing one or more covalently bonded fullerene units in the molecule that have been well reported in the literature, hybrid conjugated polymers containing covalently bonded POMs are still rare and have not been extensively explored as photovoltaic materials. In this contribution, we report the synthesis, characterization and optoelectronic properties of two new main-chain hexamolybdate-containing conjugated copolymers, namely P10 and P11. Single-component solar cells based on P10 show one of the highest PCE values on POM-based hybrid copolymers and comparable to some of those fullerene-containing conjugated small molecules/polymers.

Solvents were freshly distilled from appropriate drying agents under inert conditions prior to use. All other reagents, unless noted otherwise, were used as received from vendors without further purification. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios™ P VP AI 4083) aqueous dispersion was purchased from Heraeus Precious Metals. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with sheet resistance of 8–12 Ω per square was purchased from Delta Technologies. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer in deuterated solvents as indicated. Chemical shifts (in ppm) were internally referenced to the signals of residual non-deuterated solvents. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) data were collected at 30 °C with a Tosoh EcoSEC HLC-8320GPC system equipped with a differential refractometer, a UV detector, a light scattering detector, and a styragel column with THF as the eluent. The GPC system was calibrated with a set of four polystyrene standards (from 474 to 549000) before test. Elemental analyses for Mo were performed on a PerkinElmer Optima 2000DV ICP-OES spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Shimadzu TGA-50 thermogravimetric analyzer. FT-IR spectra were measured with a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra were collected with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined in dilute solutions (absorption maximum < 0.1) by using quinine sulfate in 1 N H2SO4 (φfl ≈ 0.546) as the standard. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken in air under ambient conditions with a PSIA XE-100 advanced scanning probe microscope using the tapping mode.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the polymer thin films were carried out under argon protection with a BAS Epsilon EC electrochemical station employing a Pt working electrode, a silver wire reference electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode. In order to prepare a thin film, a drop of polymer solution (∼0.7 mg mL−1 in CHCl3) was evenly spread on the bare surface of the Pt working electrode and air dried. A [Bu4N]PF6 solution (0.1 M in acetonitrile) was used as the supporting electrolyte and the scan rate was 20 mV s−1. The potentials were calibrated using a Fc/Fc+ redox couple whose absolute energy was assigned to be 4.80 eV vs. vacuum.

Polymers P10 and P11 were synthesized using the Stille coupling reactions, Scheme 1. Monomers (3,3′-bis(dodecyloxy)-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(tributylstannane) (1), 2,5-dibromo-9-(2-butyloctyl)-8H-dithieno[2′,3′:3,4;3′′,2′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-f]isoindole-8,10(9H)-dione (2), and diiodo-functionalized hexamolybdate 3, as well as polymer PBOR, were synthesized following previously published procedures.

To a Schlenk flask were added 1, 2, and 3 (with a molar ratio of 1:0.75:0.25). The flask was subjected to three pump–purge cycles with N2 followed by the addition of anhydrous DMF (3 mL) via syringe. Pd2(dba)3 (5 mol%) and P(o-tolyl)3 (40 mol%) were then added to the flask under N2 protection. The reaction flask was sealed, and the mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 24 h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, a small amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution (1.0 M; in THF) was added into the reaction flask, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. After filtration through a filter paper, the filtrate was added to methanol (30 mL) and the mixture was stirred overnight. The polymer precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed repeatedly with ethanol. After drying at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 3 d, polymer P10 was obtained as a black solid (36% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C): δ 8.52 (br, Ar-H), 7.74 (br, thiophene-H), 4.25 (br, O–CH2–), 4.00 (br, Ph-CH), 3.65 (br, N–CH2–), 3.30 (br, N+–CH2–), 1.95 (br, –CH), 1.66 (br, –CH2–), 1.47–1.03 (m & br, –CH2–), 1.01 (m & br, –CH3), 0.87 (m & br, –CH3), 0.76 (m & br, –CH3) ppm. Mw = 5.5 kDa, PDI = 1.50. Elemental analysis (ICP) for Mo: 10.78%.
P11 was synthesized using the same procedure as that for P10 except that the molar ratio of 1, 2, and 3 was 1:0.5:0.5. P11 was obtained as a black solid (56% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C): δ 8.52 (br, Ar-H), 7.75 (br, thiophene-H), 4.25 (br, O–CH2–), 4.00 (br, Ph-CH), 3.65 (br, N–CH2–), 3.30 (br, N+–CH2–), 1.95 (br, –CH), 1.66 (br, –CH2–), 1.60–1.03 (m & br, –CH2–), 0.98 (m & br, –CH3), 0.87 (m & br, –CH3), 0.77 (m & br, –CH3) ppm. Mw = 3.7 kDa, PDI = 1.25. Elemental analysis (ICP) for Mo: 16.13%.

ITO glass slides (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) were patterned and cleaned following previously published procedures and were used as the substrates. After a UV/ozone treatment for a minimum of 45 min, the ITO substrates were coated with a hole-conducting PEDOT:PSS layer (∼45 nm thick) and then subjected to thermal annealing on a hotplate (∼120 °C, 45 min) in air. Polymer solutions were prepared in CHCl3 at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The solutions were heated overnight at 50 °C with stirring, passed through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated (900 rpm for PBOR and 600 rpm for P10/P11; 1 min) on top of the PEDOT:PSS thin films. The resultant devices were dried under Petri dishes and then transferred into a glove box full of N2. Half of the devices were thermally annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 15 min in the N2 atmosphere. Subsequently, through a shadow mask, electrodes composed of 50 nm thick Ca and 100 nm thick Al were deposited on the top by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<2 × 10−6 mbar). The active area of the devices (0.14 cm2) was defined by the overlap area of the ITO and the deposited Ca/Al electrodes. Current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured under the illumination of an Oriel xenon arc lamp solar simulator at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1-sun air mass 1.5 global illumination) using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a Newport QE-PV-SI/Ge QE/IPCE measurement kit.


The synthesis of the two new hybrid polymers P10 and P11 are depicted in Scheme 1. P10 and P11 were synthesized using the Stille polycondensation reaction of electron-deficient aryl dihalide monomers, 2 and 3, with electron-rich distannane monomer 1 in DMF. The selected monomer pairings are favorable for the Stille coupling reaction to yield high-molecular-weight polymers. By changing the feeding ratio of three monomers (1:0.75:0.25 and 1:0.5:0.5, molar ratios), two random copolymers, P10 and P11, containing different content of POMs were obtained. The polymer without POMs in the backbone (PBOR) was reported previously and was shown to give good solar cell performance when mixed with PC71BM. With a long branched alkyl chain at the imide nitrogen position of INDT and two long dodecyloxy groups at the bithiophene unit, polymer PBOR is soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and THF. P10, with some POM clusters covalently linked to the backbone, also exhibits a decent solubility in these solvents at room temperature. With more embedded POM clusters, P11, however, shows relatively poor solubility in these solvents. As the cluster loading increases, counter-ion-mediated POM anion aggregation may occur which decreases the polymer solubility.

The 1H NMR spectra of the two hybrid polymers were measured in deuterated chloroform and are shown in Fig. S1. The clear appearance of the characteristic signals associated with the bifunctionalized POM cluster and its tetrabutylammonium counterions, such as the isopropyl CH proton (proton b in Fig. S1) at δ = 4.00 ppm, N+–CH2 protons (proton d in Fig. S1) at δ = 3.30 ppm, etc., confirms the successful incorporation of POM clusters into polymers P10 and P11. The signals at δ = 4.25 and 3.65 ppm, corresponding to the OCH2– protons (proton a in Fig. S1) in the bithiophene unit and the NCH2– protons (proton c in Fig. S1) in the INDT unit, respectively, are also well resolved. Elemental analysis showed that the weight percentage of Mo in P10 and P11 was 10.78% and 16.13%, respectively. On the basis of the elemental analysis data and ignoring the end groups, the molar ratio of INDT units (corresponding to monomer 2) vs. POM clusters (corresponding to monomer 3) is estimated to be 3.1:1 for P10 and 1.3:1 for P11. The POM contents in these hybrid copolymers estimated by elemental analysis are only slightly lower than their monomer feeding ratios (2:3 = 3:1 for P10 and 1:1 for P11), indicating that monomers 3 and 2 have a similar reactivity towards monomer 1 under the applied reaction conditions.
Molecular weights of the two hybrid polymers were estimated by GPC with THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standards (Fig. S2). The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of P10 and P11 were found to be 5.48 and 3.69 kDa, respectively. Both polymers showed relatively narrow polydispersity indices (PDI = 1.50 and 1.25, respectively). The lower molecular weights of P11 may be attributed to its relatively poor solubility. As shown previously, molecular weights of POM-containing hybrid polymers based on GPC, relative to polystyrene standards, should not be taken literally. Nevertheless, the GPC traces of P10 and P11 are clearly separated from that of monomer 3, indicating that the POM clusters are covalently attached to the backbone in the hybrid copolymers.
The thermal properties of the hybrid copolymers P10 and P11 were comparatively investigated with PBOR and [Mo6O19]·[NBu4]2 free cluster by using TGA in N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S3). The free cluster is thermally stable up to 300 °C while the three polymers are thermally stable up to 200 °C. The polymers started to decompose at temperatures above 200 °C and continued to lose weight all the way up to 700 °C. The onset temperature with 5% weight loss (Td) of PBOR is ∼348 °C, while that for P10 and P11 is ∼325 and ∼280 °C, respectively. Apparently, the thermal stability of these POM-containing hybrid copolymers decreases with the increase of cluster loading ratio.
Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR spectra of P10 and P11. The FT-IR spectra of PBOR and monomer 3 are also included in Fig. 1 for comparison. As can be seen, almost all of the characteristic vibrations of both polymer PBOR and monomer 3 can be found in the FT-IR spectra of P10 and P11. The strong band at ∼1708 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the CO bond in the INDT units. The strong band at ∼948 cm−1 is attributed to ν(MoO), while the clear band/shoulder at ∼969 cm−1 corresponds to ν(MoN). These results again confirmed the covalent attachment of POM clusters in P10 and P11.
The absorption and fluorescence properties of the polymers were studied in dilute THF and CHCl3 solutions. As shown in Fig. 2, the maximum absorption of P10 and P11 in both solutions is at a shorter wavelength (509–515 nm) than that of PBOR (∼535 nm) (Table 1) as a result of the insertion of POM clusters in the backbone. All three polymers show broad near-infrared (NIR) absorptions up to 1600 nm in CHCl3. Such NIR absorptions were not observed in their THF solutions. The appearance of NIR absorptions in chloroform is likely due to the protonation of some 3,3′-didodecyloxy bithiophene end functional units by the residual acid in CHCl3 as commercial CHCl3 usually contains trace amount of acid as a result of photolysis. This explanation is corroborated by the observation of similar NIR absorptions when p-toluenesulfonic acid is added to the THF solution of the PBOR polymer (Fig. S4). It is noted that when the POM content in the backbone increases (from PBOR to P10 and to P11), the NIR absorption intensity decreases, accompanied by hypsochromic shifts in wavelengths. This is likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the POM clusters which decreases the π-electron density of the backbone and thus lowers its nucleophilicity and reactivity toward protons.

The hybrid copolymers P10 and P11 are both weakly fluorescent in THF or CHCl3 solutions. Fig. 3 shows the emission and excitation spectra of all three polymers in dilute THF and CHCl3 solutions. Unlike polymer PBOR, which showed two emissions: one from polymer aggregates (excimer emission, at 629–636 nm) and the other from non-aggregated polymers at a lower wavelength (600–615 nm), the hybrid copolymers show only the lower wavelength emission with emission λmax values at 595–600 nm for both P10 and P11 (Table 1). The spherical shape and the ortho-type bifunctionalization of the POM clusters in P10 and P11 likely limited the approaching and thus the π–π stacking of the organic π-segments. From fluorescence point of view, embedding POMs into the PBOR backbone has two opposing effects: decreasing π-segment aggregation which increases fluorescence quantum yields, and increasing the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition which results in enhanced fluorescence quenching. As a result, when POM loading in the backbone increases from PBOR to P10 and to P11, the fluorescence quantum yield increases initially and then drops. Overall though, all three polymers show weak fluorescence with quantum yields around or lower than 1% (Table 1). The excitation spectra of P10 and P11 show two maxima around 510 and 540 nm, while those of the PBOR exhibit only one at ∼550 nm (Fig. 3(c and d)). The 510 and 540 nm excitations can be assigned to LMCT and π–π* transition, respectively. Comparing with their absorption spectra which show that the absorption λmax for P10 and P11 is both around 510 nm, one can conclude that π–π* transition is much more effective in producing emissive excitons than LMCTs.
The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated as thin films using CV measurements. As shown in Fig. 4, polymer PBOR shows two irreversible reduction waves during the cathodic scan and two reversible or semi-reversible oxidation waves in the anodic scan. Besides these four waves, both P10 and P11 show clearly one additional semi-reversible reduction process as highlighted in Fig. 4. This reduction process with onset of −1.42 and −1.34 V for P10 and P11, respectively, is attributed to the reduction of the embedded POM clusters. It is noted that the reduction potential decreases (more difficult to reduce) from monomer 3 (−1.21 V) to P11 and to P10, presumably reflecting the good electron-donating property of the polythiophene-based π-system and the strong electronic interaction between the organic π-system and the POM clusters. From the first oxidation onset potential in the anodic scan and the first reduction onset potential in the cathodic scan (Table 1), the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated to be −4.86/−2.85, −4.90/−3.38, and −4.74/−3.46 eV for PBOR, P10, and P11, respectively.
Simple photovoltaic devices with a thin layer of PBOR, P10 or P11, sandwiched between a transparent anode (ITO/PEDOT:PSS) and a metal cathode (Ca/Al), were fabricated. CHCl3 was used as the solvent to prepare the polymer solutions. As mentioned earlier, all three polymers show NIR absorptions in CHCl3. Thin films spin-coated from their CHCl3 solutions showed NIR absorptions as well (Fig. 5). Compared to their solution spectra shown in Fig. 2(b), the spectral shape of PBOR in the UV-visible region is essentially the same with only slight redshift (by ∼6 nm) in absorption λmax, whereas the thin-film spectra of P10 and P11 are more redshifted (by ∼32 nm) and nearly cover the same visible range as PBOR does. This indicates that the strong π–π stacking among conjugated bridges recovered in the solid state of these hybrid copolymers. Thermal annealing treatment (at 120 °C for 15 min) induced only negligible changes to the absorption spectra of the thin films of three polymers (see Fig. 5).
The surface morphology of the spin-casted polymer thin films was investigated by means of tapping-mode AFM imaging. Fig. 6 shows the typical resulting topographic images of the thin films, while Fig. 7 shows their corresponding phase images that were simultaneously recorded with the topographic images. As shown in Fig. 6, the thin films of PBOR, P10 and P11, whether annealed or not, all exhibit very smooth surfaces with roughness amplitude of only a few Å. The phase images (Fig. 7) revealed a relatively homogeneous phase composition for all the thin films as reflected by their small phase shift which spans only 0.7 to 1.2°. No obvious phase separation has been observed for the thin films of both PBOR and hybrid copolymers P10 and P11.
Fig. 8 shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices in dark and under illumination. Corresponding photovoltaic characteristics, including open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE, are tabulated in Table 2. Without any other added electron acceptors, the devices of pure PBOR exhibited a low but normal PCE of 0.009%, whereas the devices based on hybrid copolymer P10 showed a much more encouraging PCE of 0.222%. The 24 times increase in PCE was brought about by the boost of JSC from 0.062 mA cm−2 to 2.42 mA cm−2 thanks to the insertion of strong electron-accepting POM clusters in the π-conjugated backbone. The much higher JSC and PCE achieved with P10 than PBOR suggests that photoinduced charge separation in such main-chain POM-containing hybrid polymers can be rather efficient. Due to the poor solubility of P11, the maximum absorbance of its thin films spin-coated from CHCl3 solutions is only about half of that of P10. As a result, devices of P11 performed not as well as P10 did, and showed a PCE of only 0.017%. The above results are all from devices that were not thermally annealed. Thermal annealing of the polymer thin films, in all cases, shows a detrimental effect on the device performances (see Fig. 8 and Table 2).

Further device optimization by varying polymer concentration, spin rate, etc., yielded a higher PCE from P10 (Fig. 9). Although the devices suffer again from low VOC and poor FF, the 0.31% efficiency is still highly respectable, not only among the highest PCE values for all reported POM-based hybrid polymers, but also comparable to those of many single-component solar cells made from conjugated small molecule/polymer containing covalently bonded fullerene(s). The device performance, while encouraging, pales in comparison with the best composite hybrid systems. The hybrid copolymers P10 and P11 have POM clusters uniformly distributed in the backbone and, evident from Fig. 7, they are not able to form well phase-separated, bicontinuous donor and acceptor domains necessary for highly efficient devices. To achieve the desired controllable phase separation, future work may be directed towards the development of donor–acceptor diblock copolymers limiting the embedment of POMs in one of the conjugated blocks only.
To confirm the contribution of embedded POMs to the photocurrent, IPCE spectra of the photovoltaic cells of P10 and P11 were measured and are shown in Fig. 10. All the IPCE spectra reasonably match the absorption spectra of their corresponding thin films (Fig. 5) in the UV-visible region (from 300 to 700 nm), confirming the photocurrent contribution of both the organic π-segments and the POM clusters in the polymer backbone. The IPCE spectra in the range of 800 to 1600 nm were also collected (not shown in Fig. 10), but they showed no quantum efficiency. Apparently, the NIR absorptions of both hybrid polymers, corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer induced by protonation, are unable to produce photocurrent. This is presumably due to the localized nature of the charges generated by the intramolecular charge transfer transition in the protonated species.

In summary, two new main-chain POM-containing donor–acceptor conjugated copolymers with INDT and 3,3′-didodecyloxy bithiophene units have been synthesized by using the Stille polycondensation reaction. The structures of the hybrid polymers were confirmed by 1H NMR, FT-IR, and elemental analysis. These polymers are thermally stable up to 200 °C, and show intense absorption in the visible range with weak fluorescence emissions in solutions. These polymers were found to have broad NIR absorptions in CHCl3 which can be carried forward to their spin-coated thin films. Single-component solar cells based on P10 showed PCEs up to 0.31%, comparable to those of some fullerene-containing conjugated small molecules or polymers. IPCE measurement revealed that the photocurrent of the solar cells was attributed exclusively by the UV and visible absorptions. The NIR absorptions of both hybrid polymers, assignable to protonation-induced intramolecular charge transfer, are unable to produce photocurrent for photovoltaic applications.
