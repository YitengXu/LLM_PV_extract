Three novel donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated copolymers for polymer solar cells (PSC) are presented in this work. By Stille coupling polymerization, indacenodithiophene (IDT), as an electron-rich unit, was conjugated with an electron-deficient unit of isoindigo (IID), which led to a novel alternative copolymer IDT–IID (P1). Two electron-deficient units, 2,1,3-benzooxadiazole (BO) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), were respectively introduced in the polymerization of P1, and two novel IDT-based D–A1–D–A2 random copolymers IDT–IID–IDT–BO (P2) and IDT–IID–IDT–DPP (P3) were obtained. Thermal property tests indicated that these molecules possess relative stability and are suitable for solar cell applications. Optical and electrochemical measurements revealed that the HOMO energy levels of the three copolymers were −5.46 eV, −5.34 eV, and −5.23 eV respectively, while the LUMO levels were almost kept stable around −3.56 eV and the low band gap levels led to complete absorption in the visible region. The PSCs based on these copolymers were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and the photovoltaic properties disclosed the relatively high values of open circuit voltage (Voc) due to the low-lying HOMO energy levels of each copolymer. Hole mobility and atomic force microscopy (AFM) study were applied to improve the PSCs performance. Our work provides an efficient method to regulate the HOMO energy levels which will be beneficial for PSCs by synthesizing different conjugated copolymers.

In the past decades, extraordinary efforts have been made in the development of polymer solar cells (PSCs) to strive for large area, solution processed, and highly efficient solar cells. Recently, PSCs based on conjugated polymers as electron donor materials blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor material have been achieved, surpassing 10% of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by using a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) configuration. Recently, Cao and other groups have successively achieved high PCEs of 10.61% and 10.8% for PSCs. Nevertheless, more efforts are still required to achieve a PCE of 15% for the large scale application of photovoltaic technology.

PSC research has focused on the design and synthesis of high performance polymer materials to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Voc is typically linearly proportional to the difference in energy between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene. Actually, the HOMO level can be decreased by introducing a “strong acceptor” to increase the Voc. On the other hand, Jsc is mainly determined by the amount of absorbed light and the width of the absorption in the spectrum of sunlight, while the FF value can be increased through a number of factors concerning both the materials and processing conditions. It is well known that the development of novel materials is the key solution to achieve high efficiency PSCs. Unfortunately, up to now, many conjugated polymers in PSCs can only absorb in a limited region of the solar spectrum and do not exhibit a satisfying PCE. To solve this problem, two effective approaches have been adopted: one is to fabricate tandem devices, and the other is to synthesize a random polymer with one donor conjugated with two acceptors. Tandem solar devices consist of several single cells, which result in the combined absorption covering a broader region of the solar spectrum; however, their fabrication process is too complicated for practical operation. As for the second approach, a polymer with different monomers that have a complementary absorption range could show the broadening of the absorption spectrum. As we know, the molecular structures result inconsistent values of Voc for the photovoltaic devices because their HOMO and LUMO energy levels are largely localized on the donor and acceptor units, respectively. Therefore, a random polymer has great potential for improving the performance of PSCs.
In this work, we report the synthesis of the D–A copolymer IDT–IID (P1) in which indacenodithiophene (IDT) is used as a donor and isoindigo (IID) as an acceptor for PSCs, as shown in Scheme 1. As a strong electron acceptor unit, IID bears two symmetrical oxindole motifs and can be regarded as a compound with a trans-stilbene hydrocarbon backbone linked by two lactam rings. The two lactam rings affiliated to adjacent aryl rings in IID ensure its planar molecular structure. Representative IID-based polymers absorb photons near 750 nm in wavelength with a low-lying HOMO level of around −5.9 eV. For comparison, the other two electron-deficient units, BO and DPP, were respectively introduced in the polymerization of P1, and two novel D–A1–D–A2 conjugated random copolymers IDT–IID–IDT–BO (P2) and IDT–IID–IDT–DPP (P3) were obtained (Scheme 1). The unit BO, 2,1,3-benzooxadiazole, a typically used monomer with a quinoid structure, is also a strongly electron-accepting moiety that has been used in conjugated polymers for PSCs with a strong absorption peak near 600 nm and a low-lying HOMO level of around −5.4 eV. Meanwhile, the unit DPP, diketopyrrolopyrrole, possesses a lactam structure and planar, well-conjugated skeletons that give rise to strong π–π interactions and result in absorptions in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The DPP-based polymers show NIR absorption over 900 nm with a high lying HOMO level around −5.2 eV. So it is expected that random copolymerization of the three units can regulate the HOMO energy level as well as the absorption range of the resulting polymers.

All commercially obtained reagents were used without further purification. (4,4,9,9-Tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(trimethyl-stannane) (IDT) and 6,6′-dibromo-1,1′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (IID) were purchased from SunaTech Inc. and used without further purification. 4,7-Bis(5-bromofuran-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]-oxadiazole (DFBO) and 2,5-diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) were synthesized according to the reported methods. All the solvents for reactions and photophysical measurements were distilled after dehydration according to conventional methods.



1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by a PerkinElmer Pyris. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymer film was carried out with a CHI650B potentiostat. Surface images were obtained on a Veeco Dimension 3100 V atomic force microscope (AFM).


The polymers P1, P2, and P3 were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization in, basically, identical processes. Briefly, the polymers were synthesized as follows.


A mixture of IDT (200 mg, 0.178 mmol) and IID (124 mg, 0.178 mmol) was dissolved in 4 mL of anhydrous toluene. The solution was flushed with argon for 10 min, and then 5 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the flask. The flask was degassed and filled with argon, cycled three times. The reaction mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 36 h under an argon atmosphere. Then, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured slowly into 200 mL of methanol. The precipitates were filtered and washed with methanol, acetone, and hexane in a Soxhlet apparatus to remove the oligomers and catalyst residues. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform. The solution was condensed by evaporation and precipitated in methanol. The precipitates were collected and dried under vacuum to give polymer P1 (147 mg, 62%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.47–7.22 (br, 16H), 7.13–6.95 (br, 10H), 2.59 (br, 6H), 1.61 (br, 8H), 1.31 (br, 40H), and 0.97–0.89 (br, 24H).


A similar treatment of IDT (200 mg, 0.178 mmol), DFBO (59 mg, 0.089 mmol) and IID (62 mg, 0.089 mmol) obtained 152 mg of polymer P2 (65% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.47–7.23 (br, 30H), 7.12–6.96 (br, 20H), 2.59 (br, 18H), 1.61 (br, 14H), 1.31 (br, 74H), and 0.97–0.89 (br, 42H).


A mixture of IDT (200 mg, 0.178 mmol), DPP (66 mg, 0.089 mmol) and IID (62 mg, 0.089 mmol) was polymerized to get 159 mg of polymer P3 (67% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.47–7.23 (br, 30H), 7.12–6.96 (br, 20H), 2.59 (br, 16H), 1.61 (br, 12H), 1.31 (br, 78H), and 0.97–0.89 (br, 48H).


All organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in detergent, water, acetone, and iso-propanol (IPA) sequentially, followed by being treated in an ultraviolet ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. The cleaned substrates were covered with PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PV PAI 4083, Germany) by spin coating. After annealing in a glovebox at 140 °C for 20 min, the samples were cooled to room temperature. Polymers were dissolved in dichlorobenzene (DCB) mixed with 3% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and then PC71BM was added. The solution was heated at 60 °C and stirred overnight. Then the solution of polymer:PC71BM was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO to form the active layer. The devices were completed after the deposition of Ca/Al as the cathode through a shadow mask under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Typical devices were thermally annealed at 120 °C after putting on the top contact. The effective area of the device was measured to be 0.1257 cm2. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of all the photovoltaic cells were measured in an argon atmosphere under simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2; AM 1.5G) provided by a Newport-Oriel® Sol3A 450 W solar simulator without encapsulation. Electrical data were recorded using a Keithley 2440 source meter, and the intensity of the simulated solar light was calibrated by a standard Si photodiode detector (PV measurements Inc.), which was calibrated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the United States.


The thermal properties of the copolymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The synthesized copolymers P1, P2, and P3 all showed good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to a 5% weight loss at 426 °C, 349 °C and 419 °C, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Such high Td values indicate that these molecules possess relative stability, and may be suitable for solar cell applications.

It can be seen that the relative positions and intensities of the absorption peaks of the conjugated copolymers can be effectively tuned by including the BO or DPP unit. In chloroform solution, the maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of P1, P2, and P3 are located at 694 nm, 623 nm and 714 nm, respectively, whereas they are correspondingly located at 676 nm, 619 nm and 683 nm in the solid state. The main absorption peak in solution for P2 was shifted to 623 nm, which shows an obvious shorter wavelength upon introducing the BO monomer unit compared to P1 at 694 nm. On the other hand, the main absorption peak for P3 was red-shifted to 714 nm by the presence of the DPP unit. These results indicate that the absorption spectra of the polymers can be readily changed by the BO units and DPP units. The absorption spectra of the three polymers in the solid state are similar to their corresponding solution spectra. The film absorption spectrum of each of these three copolymers features two absorption bands: one at 300–500 nm, which we assign to the localized π–π* transitions, and the other, a broader band in the long wavelength region, from 500 to 800 nm, which can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the acceptor units and the donor units. Therefore, the random copolymers with extended light absorption could have a strong potential for achieving panchromatic PSCs.

The molecular energy levels of the synthesized copolymers P1, P2, and P3 were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 3 shows the CV curves of the copolymer films on platinum plate working electrodes in 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6)–acetonitrile solution. Ferrocene was used as the internal standard in each measurement, and it was located at 0.40 eV relative to the Ag/AgCl electrode. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were then calculated according to the following equations:

HOMO = –e(Eox + 4.4) (eV)
(1)
LUMO = –e(Ered + 4.4) (eV)
(2)
Eecg = e(Eox − Ered) (eV)
(3)
where
Eox is the onset oxidation potential vs. Ag/AgCl and Ered is the onset reduction potential vs. Ag/AgCl.

The LUMO levels of P1, P2, and P3 were measured to be −3.56 eV, −3.58 eV, and −3.57 eV, whereas their corresponding HOMO levels were −5.46 eV, −5.34 eV, and −5.23 eV, respectively (Table 2). The low HOMO energy levels of the random conjugated copolymers are beneficial for their relatively high stability against oxidation and also for a potentially high Voc value for use in a PSC. Yet the LUMO energy levels of the copolymers are constant (−3.56 eV to −3.58 eV), which were significantly greater than that of PC71BM (ca. 4.1 eV). Thus, we would expect efficient charge transfer/dissociation to occur in their corresponding devices. It can be seen that the HOMO levels of the random copolymers have been changed by the introduction of the BO unit and the DPP unit onto their backbones. The electrochemical band gaps (Eecg) of P2 and P3 were 0.11 eV and 0.21 eV smaller than P1, respectively. The results clearly indicate that the introduction of new units into the backbones of D–A polymers is an efficient way to decrease their band gaps by regulating the molecular energy levels. We can predict that the decreased band gaps may lead to a broadened absorption spectral range, which is accordance with the previous results of the optical properties. In addition, Eecg values of the random copolymers, calculated from the difference between the onset potential for oxidation and reduction, were in the range 1.66–1.87 eV. These values were slightly larger than the corresponding optical band gaps. It is assumed that the difference between the electrochemical and optical band gaps resulted from the exciton binding energies of the polymers and the interface barriers for charge injection.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the three polymers, we fabricated PSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, where the PEDOT:PSS and Ca layers were employed as buffer layers to facilitate the hole and electron extractions. The J–V characteristics of the bulk-heterojunction PSCs are shown in Fig. 4. The photovoltaic parameters Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the devices were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) and the obtained values are summarized in Table 3. Dichlorobenzene (DCB) was used to prepare the solutions for the spin-coating of the active layers, and the concentration of the solutions used was 10 mg mL−1. An optimized weight ratio for P1:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM was found to be 1:1 while for P2:PC71BM it was found to be 1:2. Due to the low-lying HOMO energy levels of each copolymer, relatively high values of open circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.80 V were obtained for the devices based on P1, P2, and P3 (Table 3). However, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) was small for the devices based on each polymer and resulted in overall low PCEs.

To improve the PCE of the active layer, we also added a small amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN; 3 vol% relative to DCB) to process these blends. CN has been reported as a processing additive to increase the compatibility of the polymers and PC71BM and to decrease the domain size. The performance of the devices is enhanced by the formation of nanoscale phase separations of the copolymers. The values of Voc and FF of the devices were not affected by the addition of 3% CN to the solvents for processing the polymer:PC71BM blend. However, the Jsc increased slightly from 3.16, 3.23 and 4.19 mA cm−2 to 4.49, 5.92, and 5.28 mA cm−2, respectively, which contributed to an enhancement of the overall photovoltaic performance.

From the above discussion, we know that the Jsc values of the synthesized copolymers P1, P2, and P3 can be increased by the additive CN. In order to explore the effects of the additive on the charge transport properties, we investigated the carrier mobility of the polymer:PC71BM with the space charge limited current (SCLC) model by using hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au), which can be approximated by a modification of Mott–Gurney's law:
where
J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μ0 is the charge mobility at zero field, L is the thickness of the blended film layer, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V). Fig. 5 shows the J1/2 − (Vappl − Vbi) curves of the hole-only devices. According to the above equation, the hole mobilities of P1, P2 and P3 were calculated to be 1.24 × 10−6, 1.27 × 10−6 and 1.71 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the hole-only polymer:PC71BM devices, respectively. These values are nearly 1.26, 1.27 and 1.34 times higher than those of the devices without additives (9.81 × 10−7, 1.01 × 10−6 and 1.28 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 3). From the carrier mobility measurement, we concluded that the introduction of the additive is beneficial to improve the charge mobility.

The morphology of the photoactive layer also plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. In some cases the performance of the devices strongly depends on its morphological features. Nanoscale phase separation creates an ideal morphology for the active layer in high-performance PSCs, which enables exciton diffusion with a large interface area, and a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes. Therefore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend (1:1 or 1:2, w/w) spin-coated from DCB solutions with and without the additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN). AFM images of the polymer:PC71BM blend films are shown in Fig. 6. The surface RMS (root mean-square) roughness of the polymer:PC71BM films without CN was found to be 0.729 nm, 4.37 nm and 0.622 nm for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. In contrast, the blend films with CN showed a smooth surface with a decrease in roughness from 0.729, 4.37, and 0.622 nm to 0.616, 2.76, and 0.623 nm, respectively. A smooth surface and a good phase separation induce a better contact with the electrode and the bicontinuous phase separation improves the charge transport and exciton dissociation, which will lead to an increase in the short-circuit current density as well as the device efficiency. So this result indicates that the CN additive can be used to modify the morphology of the active layer to achieve better photovoltaic performance.

In summary, a donor (D) unit indacenodithiophene (IDT) and three acceptor (A) units, isoindigo (IID), 2,1,3-benzooxadiazole (BO), and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), were used to synthesize D–A conjugated copolymers by Stille coupling polymerization. A new conjugated alternating copolymer IDT–IID (P1) and two new random copolymers IDT–IID–IDT–BO (P2) and IDT–IID–IDT–DPP (P3) were obtained. By changing the third component in the terpolymers, we have successfully regulated the HOMO energy levels and the optical absorption. The HOMO levels of the three copolymers were measured as −5.46 eV, −5.34 eV, and −5.23 eV respectively and the lower band gap levels lead to a complete absorption in visible region. These copolymers also possess excellent thermal stability and photovoltaic properties. The PSCs based on these copolymers were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and the relatively high values of open circuit voltage (Voc) were obtained due to the low-lying HOMO energy levels of each copolymer.
