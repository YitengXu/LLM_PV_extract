The electron transport layers (ETLs) of non-fullerene organic solar cells (NOSCs) are crucial to modulate the work function (WF) of the electrode and restrict the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Herein, two novel quasi-three-dimensional self-doped conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) based on a triphenylamine skeleton, PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, are developed and used as ETLs of NOSCs. The quasi-three-dimensional hyperbranched structure enables them to have more polar groups, which is favorable to generate more dipoles and lower the WF, thus realizing a favorable ohmic contact. Simultaneously, the n-type self-doping effect can dramatically increase the electrical conductivity of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr. Consequently, compared with the reference device (6.55%), the devices using PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr as ETLs exhibit prominently enhanced performance with optimal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10.68% and 11.39%, respectively. The superior PCE of the device with the PTPAPCNBr ETL is principally due to the additional n-type self-doping originating from the lone pair electrons of carbazole. Furthermore, benefitting from the high conductivity of over 4 × 10−4 S cm−1, the devices based on the PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs can still function efficiently under thicknesses of approximately 23 nm and 26 nm, respectively. Accordingly, quasi-three-dimensional hyperbranched CPE ETLs with numerous polar groups and self-doping behavior provide a potential pathway to enhance the PCE of NOSCs.

Non-fullerene organic solar cells (NOSCs) have been widely applied due to their potential prospects, such as light weight, good flexibility and solution processability. Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NOSCs has exceeded 18%, which is primarily attributed to the rapid advancement of new active materials, device structure, and manufacturing processes. Most organic semiconductor materials have a relatively low dielectric constant compared with that of electrode materials, which causes high exciton binding energy and charge carrier recombination in NOSCs. On the contrary, a high dielectric constant would reduce the exciton binding energy, and decrease the charge carrier recombination losses, thereby enhancing the overall device performance of NOSCs. Therefore, due to the inconsistency of dielectric constants between the light capturing layer and electrode in NOSCs, there is an energy level barrier between them. It often leads to the generation of charge-jumping transfer, which will hinder charge transport. To overcome this restriction, interfacial modification engineering is widely adopted by introducing an electron transport layer (ETL) in the interface of the light absorption layer and electrode. Specifically, the excellent ETL can effectively make the interface achieve a good ohmic contact, thus decreasing the interfacial barrier and facilitating electron transportation.

Among the various organic semiconductor materials, water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as ETLs are a series of promising candidates because of their excellent optical and electrical performance and superb processability in polar solvents. Commonly, CPEs are designed based on π-conjugated main backbones and polar side groups, including imidazolium, quaternary ammonium, etc. Different from most traditional organic semiconductor materials that have outstanding dissolvability in nonpolar solvents, CPEs can dissolve well in polar solvents, like water and methanol. The compatibility difference can help prevent the solvent of ETLs from corroding the active layer. Consequently, CPEs are a favorable electron transport material in optoelectronic devices.
Compared to the generally linear CPEs, hyperbranched CPEs, with the dual advantages of hyperbranched configuration and CPEs, have attracted widespread attention because of their high functionality as ETLs. Ge et al. exploited two novel hyperbranched polymer carboxylic acid functionalized hyperbranched poly(ether ketone) (CHBPEK) and sulfonic acid functionalized hyperbranched poly(ether sulfone) (SHBPES) as ETLs for conventional single-junction organic solar cells (OSCs) and realized the highest PCE of 9.12%. The increased performance is principally attributed to the unique 3-D network structures of CHBPEK and SHBPES, which endow them with superior charge selectivity and transport capability. Simultaneously, plenty of dipoles created by the hyperbranched CPE can effectively weaken the interfacial energy barrier. It can be in favor of the transportation and collection of the charge, which is an essential process for obtaining highly efficient OSCs. Apart from enhancing the charge transportation efficiency, the other functions of hyperbranched CPEs, including the modulation of work function (WF) and the optimization of morphology, are also helpful to the overall improvement of photovoltaic performance in OSCs. For instance, Huang et al. prepared three non-halogenated solvent processable hyperbranched CPEs (HD-Br, HN-Br, and HP-Br), which are quaternization-polymerized from 1,3,5-tri(pyridin-4-yl) benzene and alkyl bromide terminated conjugated moieties, including diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), naphthalene diimide (NDI), and perylenediimide (PDI) moieties, respectively. They proved that the hyperbranched CPEs have positive effects on lowering the WF of the metal electrode and promoting the collection of electrons, thus raising the PCE remarkably. Chen et al. reported aliphatic hyperbranched poly(amido acid)s (HBPAs) to modify the zinc oxide (ZnO), showing that the surface energy of ZnO was dramatically decreased, and the morphology of the active layer was optimized.
Additionally, the functional side chains of hyperbranched CPEs not only provide good solubility but also can promote strong n-type self-doping and reduce WF. The large dipoles generated by the n-type self-doping effect can enhance the interfacial control ability and the conductivity of self-doped electron transport materials, which will make them insensitive to the thickness. Meanwhile, efficient n-type poly-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-2,5-bis[6-(N,N,N-trimethyl-ammonium)hexyl]-3,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (PDPPNBr) with a characteristic of thickness insensitivity was designed by Chen and his workers. The PDPPNBr possessed superior conductivity due to its n-type DPP conjugated backbone. They further introduced fluorine atoms in the backbone to prompt a powerful n-type self-doping and increase the conductivity and charge mobility. Therefore, the n-type self-doped ETLs can induce prominently enhanced PCE of OSCs.
In this work, two novel n-type water–alcohol processable quasi-three-dimensional hyperbranched CPEs, PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, with triphenylamines (TPA) as the skeleton, carbazole or fluorene as the conjugated moiety, and quaternary ammonium salts as the terminal substituent, are designed and synthesized via adjusting the reaction time, temperature, and the addition amount of the catalyst (Fig. 1a). The polar side chains endow them with excellent water–alcohol solution processability. Besides, as we expected, both PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr possess the n-type self-doping effect, and the latter has relatively stronger signals than the former, which has been characterized by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement. PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr are all used as the ETLs in NOSCs based on PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F (Fig. 1b and c). Due to the remarkable interfacial regulation and excellent charge transport properties, the devices of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr achieve hopeful PCEs of 10.68% and 11.39%, respectively. Notably, owing to the influence of the additional n-type self-doping originating from the lone pair electrons of carbazole units in PTPAPCNBr, the device displays a higher PCE than PTPAPFNBr. Moreover, the investigation on the thickness dependence of ETLs shows that the device could still maintain acceptable PCE when the thickness of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr is up to 23 nm and 26 nm, respectively. The PCE of NOSCs with PTPAPFNBr reaches the highest value of 10.68% at 11 nm, maintaining a maximal efficiency of about 58.7% at 23 nm. Furthermore, the highest value of 11.39% at 9 nm is reached for PTPAPCNBr and still has an efficiency of around 56.4% at 26 nm. Our results demonstrate that the two hyperbranched CPEs are promising ETLs for large-scale NOSCs.

2,7-Dibromo-9,9-bis-(6-bromohexyl)-9H-fluorene (PFBr) and 2,7-dibromo-9-(6-bromohexyl)-carbazole (PCBr) were prepared based on the reported articles. The intermediate products of fluorene-based and carbazole-based hyperbranched conjugated polymers PTPAPFBr and PTPAPCBr were both synthesized via the Suzuki copolymerization between PFBr/PCBr and tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) phenyl) amine. The final products of ammonium-functionalized derivatives, namely, PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr were obtained by ionization of the precursor polymers PTPAPFBr and PTPAPCBr with excessive trimethylamine in THF at ambient temperature for seven days. The elaborate steps of the synthesis are given in the ESI, and the detailed synthetic routes to two n-type hyperbranched CPEs are presented in Scheme S1 (ESI). The chemical structures of PFBr, PCBr, PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr were verified by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), as depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI).


The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr are displayed in Fig. 2a. The absorption peaks of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr films are dominated by their characteristic π–π stacking. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr are estimated to be 2.82 and 2.78 eV, respectively (collected in Table 1). Generally, to ensure that the active layer can absorb the incident photons sufficiently and achieve a favorable PCE, ETLs are required to have excellent light transmittance in the visible light region. According to Fig. S2 (ESI), the light transmittance of both PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr in the visible region exceeds 90%, which illustrates that they all have preeminent light transmittance. Furthermore, from the spectra of Fig. 2b and c, it is doubtless that the deposition of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr will not impede the light absorption of the active layer.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) method is conducted to explore the electrochemical performance of two hyperbranched CPEs in their neat films, and the curves are plotted in Fig. 2d. As depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI), the value of ferrocene versus Ag/Ag+ is 0.43 eV. The value of ferrocene (Fc) is 4.8 eV lower than that of the vacuum level, and the onset reduction potentials (Eonset,red) of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr are determined to be −0.71 and −0.68 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr are estimated to be −3.66 and −3.69 eV (Table 1). The LUMO values of two materials are 0.4–0.5 eV higher than that of IT-4F (about −4.14 eV), which is beneficial to form a good ohmic contact (Fig. S4, ESI). Consequently, an efficient charge transfer can be expected in the NOSCs based on PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs.
To explore the interfacial properties of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of ITO, ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr are provided in Fig. 2e. The HOMO energy levels of ITO, ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr are estimated to be −4.70 eV, −4.41 eV and −4.08 eV (Table 1). The differences in the HOMO energy levels between ITO, ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr should be ascribed to the interfacial dipoles formed by PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, which would be in favor of decreasing the interfacial energy barrier and facilitating the charge transfer. Moreover, the high binding-energy cutoff (Ecutoff) of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr covered ITO electrodes (16–18 eV) shifted towards upper binding energies, resulting in a reduction in the WF of ITO.
To systematically reveal the WF modulating ability of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) has been performed. As illustrated in Fig. 2f and g, the WFs of ITO, ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr are 4.70 eV, 4.47 eV and 4.46 eV. The reduced WF should be ascribed to the creation of beneficial dipoles and effective interfacial interaction, and it is conducive to lowering the energy barrier and prompting the charge transfer. Synchronously, the conclusions are compatible with those of the UPS proposed above. Besides, the WF regulatory capacity of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr on the Al electrode has also been investigated. Intriguingly, the WF of Al can be decreased from 4.28 eV to 4.03 eV and 3.99 eV with the deposition of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI). These results further show the universal interfacial modulation ability of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr.
N-Type self-doping behavior of ETL materials is in favor of improving the conductivity and the interfacial modulation, which can induce a better tolerance to the thickness of the ETL. Delightfully, a distinct signal of PTPAPCNBr at about 329 G has been detected in the EPR spectrum (Fig. 2h), which should be owing to the presence of unpaired electrons (polarons). This signal demonstrates that the n-type self-doping effects exist in PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr. Moreover, the N-atoms in the triphenylamine unit of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr have lone pair electrons, which can transfer to the conjugated backbone and generate the n-type self-doping effect. And it is striking that the signal of the PTPAPCNBr is dramatically stronger than that of the PTPAPFNBr, which should be because the lone pair electrons of carbazole in PTPAPCNBr can transfer to the conjugate backbone and form an extra n-type self-doping.
To further study the interfacial interaction between the PTPAPFNBr/PTPAPCNBr ETL and the electrode, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements of ITO, ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr have been conducted (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS of N 1s has also been provided in Fig. 3b, and no response is detected from the bare ITO. However, obvious characteristic peaks of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr can be observed at 399.90 eV, 399.91 eV, and 402.77 eV, 402.78 eV, respectively, corresponding to N atoms in trialkylamine and quaternary ammonium. These results indicate that the PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr have been successfully synthesized and deposited on ITO. Fig. 3c displays three high-resolution peaks of O 1s at 532.31 eV, 532.25 eV and 531.95 eV belonging to bare ITO, ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr, respectively. In sharp comparison with the bare ITO, the binding energy of hyperbranched CPEs has been downshifted by 0.06 eV and 0.36 eV, respectively. The downshifted binding energy of O 1s in both ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr should originate from the larger negative charge density and the stronger interfacial interactions between PTPAPFNBr/PTPAPCNBr and ITO. Moreover, similar to the O 1s peak, the down-shifting trend of binding energy is found in the high-resolution XPS of In 3d (Fig. 3d). The drift of peak position confirms the existence of interfacial interaction and dipoles, which is in accordance with the conclusions of UPS and KPM.

To explore the influence of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs on the performance of NOSCs, the conventional NOSCs with a structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/ETL/Al are fabricated (Fig. 4a). For comparison, the reference device without an ETL is also prepared. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the conventional devices with different ETLs are presented in Fig. 4b, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The NOSC based on PTPAPFNBr obtains a good PCE of 10.68%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.48 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 69.25%. Intriguingly, for the device with the PTPAPCNBr ETL, an optimal PCE of 11.39% is achieved, which is beyond 1.7 times higher compared with the reference device (6.55%). Compared to the Al-only device, the remarkable enhancement in PCE of the PTPAPCNBr-based device is a result of a simultaneous increase of Voc (from 0.62 to 0.80 V), Jsc (from 17.54 to 20.22 mA cm−2) and FF (from 60.30% to 70.12%). These results further confirm the conclusions of UPS, KPM and XPS. In contrast to the reference device, the insertion of the ETL with an appropriate energy level is helpful to constitute ohmic contact, thus optimizing the electron transfer, suppressing the exciton recombination, and enhancing the PCE of the NOSCs. Moreover, from the J–V curves, the series resistance (Rs) is distinctly decreased, and the parallel resistance (Rsh) is increased with addition of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr, respectively (Table 2). The best Rs (5.88 Ω cm2) and Rsh (1554.75 Ω cm2) were achieved with the introduction of PTPAPCNBr, indicating that PTPAPCNBr can promote the charge extraction and reduce the charge gather in the interface; thus, the charge collection ability become stronger, which is fully consistent with higher FF and Jsc.

From the dark J−V characteristics (see Fig. 4c), it is observed that the phenomenon of leakage current will be restrained effectively which further elucidates that PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs have a positive influence on the enhancement of Jsc. Additionally, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are described in Fig. 4d. Although the absorption spectrum of the PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/PTPAPFNBr resembles that of the PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/PTPAPCNBr, PTPAPCNBr possesses stronger interfacial regulation and self-doping effect, and the electrons generated by incident photons will dramatically increase. According to the definition of EQE, we infer that PTPAPCNBr will obtain the superior EQE value. Fig. 4d verifies our speculation, and the EQE of PTPAPCNBr is up to 75% and it is higher than that of PTPAPFNBr (70%). The integrated current density of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr is 16.67 and 17.33 mA cm−2, respectively, which agrees well with the related Jsc from the J–V curves (Fig. 4b).
To investigate the electron transfer features of devices based on PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs, the space charge limited current (SCLC) model on the basis of the Mott–Gurney equations is adopted. From the J0.5–V curves (shown in Fig. 4e), the electron mobility of devices based on PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs is calculated to be 7.10 × 10−3 and 8.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Besides, compared to PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S6, ESI) of PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/PTPAPFNBr and PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/PTPAPCNBr all quench more obviously, further validating the excellent charge separation and transport capacities of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr; especially, a more dramatic fluorescence quenching phenomenon can be detected in the PTPAPCNBr with the carbazole unit owing to its stronger self-doping effect and more efficient charge transfer efficiency. Fig. 4f is presented to study the conductive properties of the devices with PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs. The electrical conductivities of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr are calculated to be 4.44 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 4.79 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. The superb conductivities of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr presumably stem from their n-type self-doping effect.
Moreover, the ETLs with deeper EHOMO can hinder the leakage current and the recombination of the electrons-holes, thus improving the FF and Jsc. The influences of the two ETLs on photovoltaic device properties by varying the time of annealing are investigated. The corresponding J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are described in Fig. S7a, b and Table S1 (ESI), respectively. We can find that with the increase of thermal annealing time, the PCE values of NOSCs based on PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs gradually decrease. This phenomenon demonstrates that the devices with PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs enjoy the advantage of ambient temperature processing.
To better understand the charge transport and recombination properties of the NOSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is conducted to measure the interface resistances of the devices (Fig. 5). The equivalent circuit model includes parallel R1–C1 and R2–C2 components, which are connected to a series resistance (Rs) (described in Fig. 5b). R1 and R2 correspond to the recombination resistance and the transfer resistance. The fitted parameters are listed in Table 3. Based on EIS and equivalent circuit model, the Rs of the reference device (3.82 Ω) can be dramatically decreased with PTPAPFNBr (0.98 Ω) and PTPAPCNBr (0.45 Ω) ETLs, indicating the lowered charge recombination and improved charge extraction in the NOSCs. Compared to the counterpart PTPAPFNBr, a smaller diameter semicircle is achieved in the PTPAPCNBr ETL, which means the lower transport resistance and the more excellent electron transport capabilities, which can effectively reduce the charge recombination and facilitate the charge transport and collection, coinciding with its best device performance.

To further study the influence of various thicknesses of the ETL on the PCE of NOSCs, the devices using PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr as ETLs with different thicknesses are fabricated (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Benefitting from their high conductivities, the NOSCs with PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs achieve the maximum PCE (PCEmax) of 10.68% at 11 nm and 11.39% at 9 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the devices with PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs maintain 58.7% and 55.2% of the PCEmax with a thickness of 23 and 26 nm, respectively (Fig. 6a and b). It is demonstrated that both PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr have acceptable thickness insensitivity, which is a prerequisite for the industrial application of large-area NOSCs.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is utilized to examine the topographic changes of PTPAPCNBr and PTPAPFNBr coated over ITO. Compared to the ITO with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 3.68 nm and ITO/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F with a RMS of 2.62 nm (Fig. 7a and b), the surfaces of ITO/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PTPAPCNBr become more suitable, with the RMS of 3.65 and 3.62 nm (Fig. 7c and d), respectively, which can contribute to form better interfacial contact and reduce leakage current. This result matches well with the J–V dark curves in Fig. 4c. In addition, the preferable morphologies of ITO/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/PTPAPFNBr and ITO/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/PTPAPCNBr are realized with an RMS value of 3.41 and 3.25 nm, respectively (Fig. 7e and f). An appropriate degree of phase separation would result in superior electron transport. Furthermore, the static water contact angle (θ) measurements are carried out for probing the hydrophobicity of the ITO/ETLs in films (Fig. S8, ESI). The bare ITO displays a mightily hydrophilic surface with a θ of 49°, which is to the disadvantage of the compatibility with the active layer. Notably, the deposition of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr over the ITO can enhance the hydrophobicity appropriately, with θ values of 67.3° and 74.3°, respectively. The suitably improved contact angle is favorable for forming good interfacial contact and compatibility with the active layers, thus increasing the FF.

In conclusion, quasi-three-dimensional triphenylamine skeleton based hyperbranched CPEs are designed and employed as ETLs in NOSCs. The interfacial dipole moment produced by the hyperbranched CPEs PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr can drastically reduce the WF, enhance the charge transfer and suppress the recombination of electrons-holes. In consequence, the conventional devices based on the hyperbranched CPEs PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs achieve notable PCE as high as 10.68% and 11.39%, respectively. Compared with the device without the ETL (6.55%), the efficiency of devices with PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr ETLs has increased by about 63.1% and 73.9%, respectively. In contrast to PTPAPFNBr, the conspicuous PCE of PTPAPCNBr is due to the stronger n-type self-doping. It is demonstrated that the hyperbranched CPEs have made a vital contribution to enhancing the PCE of NOSCs. Due to the satisfactory conductivity, the devices with PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr as ETLs could work effectively with a thickness of 23 nm and 26 nm, respectively. The successful application of PTPAPFNBr and PTPAPCNBr shows that the green solvent processible n-type quasi-three-dimensional hyperbranched CPEs should be extraordinarily promising in building highly efficient NOSCs.
