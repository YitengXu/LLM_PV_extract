A new unsymmetrical squaraine dye (USQ) series for organic solar cells (OSC) is synthesized by a simple route without using highly toxic reagents. These USQs exhibit a low bandgap of 1.57 eV and HOMO energies of ∼−5.2–5.3 eV. Despite the very simple molecular structures, OSC devices based on these USQs exhibit an impressive open-circuit voltage of 0.92 V and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 5%, achieved without using any additives or post film deposition treatment. The results indicate that USQs are promising materials for sustainable energy applications.

The last decade has witnessed great progress in the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), during which time the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction devices has increased from ∼5% to an astonishing value of ∼13%. Small-molecule (SM) OSC semiconductors are attractive alternatives to their polymeric counterparts due to their well-defined molecular structures/molecular weights, easy purification, minimal batch-to-batch variations, and the recent impressive PCEs that have been reported. However, many small molecules used in high-PCE devices typically have complex chemical structures requiring tedious multiple steps for their synthesis, with some of them achieved in low yields and/or using expensive/environmentally unacceptable reagents. These limitations increase device costs, the energy required for materials synthesis, and are thus prohibitive for large-scale OSC module production. For example, most SMs such as π-conjugated in-chain donor–acceptor semiconductors have primarily been synthesised through Pd-catalyzed Stille condensation reactions requiring toxic stannyl reagents and producing toxic tin by-products, which presents a major obstacle to commercialization. Therefore in the trade-off between OSC cost and performance, the semiconductor plays a key role, with those achieved via simple, possibly more sustainable routes without use of toxic reagents, providing the greatest opportunity for commercialization.

Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSC) are the most commonly used photovoltaic device structure for organic semiconductors, consisting of an interpenetrating network of electron donor and electron acceptor semiconductors. For this kind of architecture, there are many ways to reduce production costs, with the most widespread being that of reducing the cost of active layer materials. Recently, many studies have focused on developing non-fullerene acceptors, due to the high synthetic cost of fullerenes. Concurrently, there are attempts to reduce the efficiency-cost gap and to promote OSC commercialization by decreasing the electron donor semiconductor cost.
Due to their intense absorption in the visible-NIR region, their good photochemical/photophysical stability, and, most importantly, the facile synthetic access, squaraine dyes have drawn much attention for SMOSCs applications. In 2008, we first introduced the squaraine dyes (SQ-1) into SMOSCs. SQ-1 is produced via a straightforward synthesis and a simple purification process (Fig. 1). SQ-1 has a broad optical absorption band from 550 nm to 850 nm and exhibits a PCE of 1.24%. In 2010, we reported a new structural strategy for SMOSCs (SQ-2), where the alkyl side chain was replaced by an alkenyl chain, which enhances the OSC PCE to ∼2%. In 2009, Würthner et al. reported SQ-3 which possess a broad absorption band from 600 nm to 900 nm and a high hole mobility up to 1.3 × 10−3 cm−2 V s−1. OSC devices based on it produce a high short-circuit current (Jsc) up to 12.6 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 1.79%. These pioneering studies demonstrated the potential of squaraine dyes for OSCs. Thereafter, several other important studies have addressed squaraine dye based OSCs. More importantly, due to their unique absorption, squaraines have also been used to fabricate ternary or quaternary devices. To the best of our knowledge, the highest PCE value based on the squaraine dye is 6.33% for the structure SQ-8.
In 2015, we introduced Z-configured squaraines (Py-3, Scheme 1), where the D and D′ segments are connected to the square core subunit (A) directly, affording an unsymmetrical squaraine dye (USQs) for OSCs. However, this structure still contains a relatively complex skeleton requiring a tedious synthetic procedure. For example, the synthesis of the electron donor unit D((E)-2-((2,2-diphenylhydrazono)-methyl)-1-(hex-5-enyl)-1H-pyrrole) requires three or more steps. To possibly reduce the cost of the USQ, we chose a commercially available fragment, indole, which is a π-extended analogue of pyrrole. Beverina et al. have shown that indole can lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of squaraines compared to pyrrole, leading to OSCs with higher Voc. Unfortunately, higher Voc values are accompanied by lower Jsc and fill factor (FF), which leads to overall lower PCEs. Based on these seminal studies, we believe that with further molecular design optimization USQs can afford OSC devices with significantly higher efficiencies.
In this contribution, we employ a facile and more sustainable synthetic procedure to synthesize a series of novel USQ dyes (Fig. 2a). Indole, 5-fluoroindole, and 6-fluoroindole fragments were chosen as electron donor units with tuned electron density, and the N-alkyl chain was introduced to ensure solution processability. This new SM family exhibits a low bandgap of 1.57 eV, an intense and broad absorption band in the range 550–750 nm, and PCEs approaching 5% without any additives or post-film deposition treatments. Our preliminary results indicate that simplifying the structure of the electron donor does not sacrifice desirable properties, thereby reducing the cost-efficiency gap of OSCs.


1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance AV II-400 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. High resolution MS spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF instrument. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained by a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer. For the optical absorption measurements, the solution samples had a concentration of 2.00 × 10−6 mol L−1 (in CHCl3) whereas the thin solid film samples were fabricated by spin-coating CHCl3 solutions (5 mg mL−1, 1500 rpm/30 s) on quartz substrates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in 5.0 × 10−4 mol L−1 anhydrous CH2Cl2 with tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte under an Argon atmosphere with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a LK 2010 electrochemical workstation. All CV measurements were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration employing a Pt disk working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 mol L−1 in acetonitrile) reference electrode. The potential of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode was internally calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which has a known reduction potential of −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum level. The morphologies of the blend films were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions (Dimension Icon Fast Scan probe microscope). TEM measurements were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument.


Small-molecule bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass as the substrate (sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) with a conventional structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/SQ: PC71BM (80 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm). The patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in detergent, deionized water, followed by acetone, then isopropanol using a sonicator for 20 min each. The substrate was treated by UV-ozone for 20 min, then immediately transferred into a high vacuum chamber for the deposition of 8 nm MoO3 at pressure of less than 1 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.2 Å s−1. The photoactive layers (thickness: 80 ± 5 nm) were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of the SQ and PC71BM in chloroform solution with total concentration of 20 mg mL−1. Finally, the substrates were transferred back into the high-vacuum chamber, where LiF (0.8 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited as the top electrode at pressures of less than 2 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.10 Å s−1 and 1.0–2.0 Å s−1, respectively. The active area of OSC cells is 4 mm2. To obtain the average data related to device performance, two batches of devices (4 cells per batch) for each set of conditions were fabricated and tested. The photovoltaic characteristics of devices were tested in ambient. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained with a Keithley 2400 under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using Xe arc lamp of a Spectra-Nova 300W Class-A solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using an NREL-certified monocrystalline Si photodiode coupled to a KG3 filter to bring the spectral mismatch to unity. External quantum efficiency (EQE) data were measured using a Newport QE-PV-SI setup. The incident light from a Xe lamp (300 W) passing through a monochromator (Newport, Cornerstone 260) was focused on the active area of the cell. The output current was measured using a current pre-amplifier (Newport, 70710QE) and a lock-in amplifier (Newport, 70105 Dual channel Merlin). A calibrated silicon diode (Newport 70356) was used as a reference. A space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model was used to measure the carrier mobilities. Hole-only and electron-only devices had the structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/neat film or blend film/MoO3 (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/neat film or blend film/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively.


The structures of the new squaraines are shown in Scheme 2. The key intermediates 10, 11, and 12 were synthesized by reacting indole, 5-fluoroindole, and 6-fluoroindole, respectively, with 1-bromooctane as show in Scheme 2. These reactions proceed in ∼80% yields. In this work, we introduce the 1-octyl side chain to increase USQ solubility. Next, the N-octylindole, N-octyl-5-fluoroindole, and N-octyl-6-fluoroindole were coupled with the squaryl chloride under Friedel-Craft acylation conditions and the solid collected by removing the solvent under vacuum. Without purification, the semi-squaryl chloride were converted into the semi-squaric acid under acid hydrolysis conditions. The yields of these two reactions are >60%. Note, these products are easily purified by washing with hexane without any column chromatography. Compound 13 was synthesized according to our literature procedure in a Buchwald–Hartwig cross coupling reaction. The final target compounds were synthesized via condensation of nucleophilic 13 with the semi-squaraines 10–12 in a 1-butanol-toluene solvent mixture. After removal of the solvent, the solids were isolated by flash column chromatography and recrystallized from CH2Cl2–MeOH to afford the SQ products in ∼50% yields, which are higher than that of Py-3 (25%). The synthesis and detailed structural characterization of the new USQs are provided in the ESI.

The optical absorption spectra of the USQs in dilute chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2, and all optical data are summarized in Table 1. In dilute solution, USQ exhibit intense absorption bands (logε >5.00) with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) around 80 nm, located at λmax = 685 nm (YSQY), 685 nm (5FYSQY), 685 nm (6FYSQY). When going from solution to thin-films, all absorption spectra are red-shifted and display an intense and broad absorption band in the range 550–750 nm, with a FWHM of 170 nm (YSQY), 180 nm (5FYSQY and 6FYSQY). In contrast, 5FYSQY and 6FYSQY show broader absorption bands suggesting that the F-substitution increases the π–π stacking. These optical absorption properties are similar to those of other squaraine dyes. From the low energy absorption onset of the thin-film samples, the optical bandgap is estimated to be 1.57 eV, which falls into the ideal Eg (1.20–1.60 eV) range for fullerene-based OSC applications. The F-substituted USQs show broadened absorption spectra both in solution and as thin films without affecting the bandgap. The extended absorption is important to harvest more photons which can enhance the Jsc and thus the OSC performance. According to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 2), the HOMO levels of YSQY, 5FYSQY and 6FYSQY are estimated to be at −5.22 eV, −5.28 eV and −5.28 eV, respectively. These HOMO levels are relatively low for USQ derivatives. The F-substituted USQs not only show broadened absorption spectra, but also a slightly lower HOMOs and similar bandgaps.

To evaluate USQ photovoltaic properties, BHJ-OSC cells were fabricated using [6,6]-phenylC71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor material. A conventional device structure comprising ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/USQ: PC71BM (∼80 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm) was employed. Photovoltaic data from these devices are summarized in Table 2, and representative current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency-wavelength (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 3. The device based on YSQY shows an impressive Voc up to 0.87 V. In comparison with YSQY, the devices based on the F substituted 5-FYSQY and 6-FYSQY show even higher Voc values which reached 0.92 V. These Voc values are in agreement with the HOMO level trends. All devices show similar Jsc and FF values, indicating that F-substitution has little influence on these parameters. Consequently, the average PCE of YSQY devices (4.18%) is lower than those based on 5-FYSQY (4.65%) and 6-FYSQY (4.66%). Thus, the regiochemistry of the F does not affect the PCE in this family, which is not typically the case. The F-substituted USQs show a lower donor photon energy loss (Eloss) of 0.65 V compared to that of the fluorine-free USQ (0.70 eV). More importantly, the optimum devices of this new series exhibit even higher PCEs (4.30% for YSQY, 4.72% for 5FYSQY, and 4.84% for 6FYSQY) than those based on Py-3 (max PCE = 3.75%) even without the use of additives and post-film deposition treatments. Note, we characterized the EQE of the devices (Fig. 3d) which corroborates the higher performance of the YSQY series materials.

To correlate the efficiency metrics in this family to the charge transport and morphological characteristics of the corresponding blends, we carried out additional experiments. First, the hole-mobility of the neat USQ films and of the USQ/PC71BM blended films was measured in hole-only diodes by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. According to the experimental results, the hole-mobility of the pristine YSQY, 5FYSQY, and 6FYSQY films are, 6.46 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereas that of the YSQY/PC71BM, 5FYSQY/PC71BM and 6FYSQY/PC71BM blend films are 1.10 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.50 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thus, both for pristine and blended films, the hole mobility of the fluorinated derivatives are slightly larger than that of YSQY. Furthermore, we evaluated the electron-mobility in electron-only devices using the same method. The electron-mobility of the pristine YSQY, 5FYSQY and 6FYSQY films are 9.33 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.44 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereas those of the corresponding blends with PC71BM are 2.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.61 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thus, the electron mobilities of USQs pristine/blend films are more similar, albeit those of 5FYSQY are slightly larger. Organic thin-film transistor (TFT) devices based on YSQY, 5FYSQY and 6FYSQY of structure Si/SiOx (300 nm)/OTS/Squarine (80 nm)/Au (40 nm) were also fabricated and exhibit hole mobilities <10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These data correlate well with the low FFs (∼40%) of these devices albeit that of 6FYSQY being slightly statistically larger.

Finally, AFM and TEM measurements were used to investigate the morphological differences in the active layers (Fig. 4). We note that these blends are a mixture of donor–acceptor in a 1:5 weight ratio. The AFM images reveal that all blend films are quite smooth and exhibit comparable root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 0.23–0.27 nm. This surface topology is similar to that of Py-3-based blends. Thus, using indole as one of the squaraine arms does not affect film morphology. TEM images (Fig. 4b) of the USQ:PC71BM blend films demonstrate the formation of a particularly well-developed interconnected donor–acceptor network, which is essential for exciton diffusion/dissociation at the blend interface and charge transport to the electrodes. Interestingly, the 5FYSQY:PC71BM blend shows a better phase separation, which should enhance the short current, as measured experimentally (see Table 2). Thus, this morphological analysis corroborate with the observed device performance trends.
Finally, to investigate the device stability, lifetime testing experiments were conducted. Note, the device structure we used for this study is ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/SQ:PC71BM = 1:5 (80 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm), and all the devices were stored in the glove box (20 °C) or in air (humidity, ∼30%; ∼20 °C) without any passivation or encapsulation. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI), the PCEs gradually decreased for the storage conditions, with the PCE decreasing by ∼30% and ∼20% when the devices were stored in air or in a glove box for 100 h, respectively. These results indicate that these squaraines are reasonably stable in air, and much longer lifetime could be expected upon proper encapsulation.

In conclusion, a new unsymmetrical squaraine family was designed, synthesized, and characterized in OSC devices. The PCEs of the devices based on these simple systems approach 5% in the best case, which is respectable for squaraine derivatives. Although USQs exhibit lower performance compared to other high-performance donor semiconductors, their synthesis is very inexpensive and straightforward. We are currently pursuing device performance optimization via the synthesis of additional derivatives as well as following approaches such as solvent annealing, additives, and the use of nonfullerene acceptors. However, our results demonstrate that squaraine dyes can be promising for sustainable OSC fabrication.
