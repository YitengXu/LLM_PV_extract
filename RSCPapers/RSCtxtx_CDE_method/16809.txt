A series of benzodithiophene (BDT) and benzothienothiophenedione (BTTDO) alternating wide-bandgap (WBG) copolymers, PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1, were designed and synthesized, in which heteroatoms (O, S and Se) were incorporated into the electron-deficient BTTDO motif. The effect of heteroatoms on the thermal stability, absorption spectra, energy level, charge carrier mobility, and photovoltaic properties of these WBG polymers was systematically studied. The results indicated that upon increasing the size of the heteroatoms, the maximum absorption peaks were red-shifted and the optical bandgap decreased. Solar cells with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC70BM (1:1, w/w)/Ca/Al were fabricated. Among the three polymers, PBDT-S1 achieved the best photovoltaic performance, with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.0%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.99 mA cm−2, and an unprecedented fill factor (FF) of 74.9%.

As one of the effective strategies to solve the environmental pollution and energy crisis, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to the advantages of light weight, flexibility, low cost, and solution processability. The most successful device structure for PSCs is the so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which consists of electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-withdrawing fullerene derivatives as active layers. In the past two decades, the BHJ has realized significant progress, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction solar cells have been achieved over 10%. In order to obtain high performance PSCs, the related photovoltaic parameters have been widely studied. It is found that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is mainly determined by the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor; the short-circuit current (Jsc) strongly depends on the sunlight harvesting capability, charge carrier mobility, and morphology of the active layers; the fill factor (FF) is mainly affected by the charge carrier mobility, active layer morphology, chare carrier transport and recombination.

In recent years, the typical donor–acceptor (D–A) molecular structure has been widely used to improve the aforementioned photovoltaic parameters. The advances in D–A copolymers include an extended conjugation length, optimized bandgaps, enhanced intermolecular interactions, increased π–π* overlaps between neighboring polymers to improve charge carrier mobilities, and side chain engineering to tune the solubility and crystallinity of the polymers. Among the various electron-donating building blocks utilized for designing D–A conjugated polymers, the donor building block BDT has shown high performance on account of its high structural symmetry, planar molecular framework and high stability against oxidation ability. Therefore, developing BDT-based D–A copolymers with different acceptor units has exhibited great potential in fine tuning the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. Among the various effective acceptor motifs, benzothienothiophenedione (BTTDO) is one of the promising acceptor subunits to construct high-performance copolymers. The PBDT-S1 polymer with BDT and BTTDO units showed a high PCE.
On the other hand, the strategy of varying the heteroatom on conjugated building blocks has been shown as one of the simple methods to adjust the optical-electronic properties of polymers. However, current heteroatom modifications mainly focus on low-bandgap (LBG, Eg < 1.6 eV) and medium-bandgap (MBG, Eg: 1.6–1.8 eV) photovoltaic polymers. For example, Najari and co-workers synthesized a series of LBG conjugated polymers based on TPD, FPD, SePD, and the TPD-containing polymer of C3-DPPTT-T led to air-processed polymer solar cells with a PCE of 8.8%. Jiang and co-workers reported that various heteroatom side chain substituents on BDT units of three MBG conjugated polymers could change the polymer solubility, conformations, and the electronic properties, as well as the photovoltaic properties. However, it should be noted that compared to LBG and MBG polymers, WBG polymers have received limited attention and only a few examples of wide-bandgap polymers with PCEs over 8% have been reported. The development of high efficiency BDT-based WBG polymers still remains a challenge.
Inspired by the heteroatom effect on LBG and MBG polymers, through varying the heteroatoms on the acceptor unit of BTTDO, we herein reported a series of wide-bandgap copolymers of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1. The effect of heteroatoms on the thermal stability, absorption spectra, energy levels, charge carrier transport, and photovoltaic performances of polymers was systematically investigated in this study.

The synthetic routes of the polymers PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 are shown in Scheme 1. The donor unit BDT was synthesized according to the reported methods. The acceptor units are based on three different heteroatomic functional groups, 2,5-di(octan-3-yl)furan/thiophene/selenophene (2a, 2b and 2c). 1,3-dibromo-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-furan/thiophene/selenophene[3′,4′:4,5]benzo[1,2-c]thiophene-4,8-dione (5a, 5b and 5c) were synthesized through a cyclization reaction. Then, 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-1,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4H,8H-furan/thiophene/selenophene[3′,4′:4,5]benzo[1,2-c]thiophene-4,8-dione (6a, 6b and 6c) were synthesized through classical Stille coupling reactions. After that, 3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-furan/thiophene/selenophene[3′,4′:4,5]benzo[1,2-c]thiophene-4,8-dione (O1, S1 and Se1) could be achieved by adding Br at the α position in thiophene. Finally, through the classical Stilling coupling reactions, O1/S1/Se1 monomers were copolymerized with the BDT unit, respectively, to obtain three new WBG polymers of PBDT-O1/PBDT-S1/PBDT-Se1. These three polymers were purified by Soxhlet extractions using successively solvents of methanol, acetone, and chloroform. The purified polymers were obtained from the chloroform fraction. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) values of PBDT-O1/PBDT-S1/PBDT-Se1 were 22.0 K, 34.2 K, 27.3 K, and 1.1, 1.8, and 1.6, respectively. All polymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).


The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 in diluted chloroform solutions and thin films at room temperature are displayed in Fig. 1. The three copolymers exhibit similar absorption spectra, featuring two broad absorption bands from 320 to 400 nm and 500 to 750 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the pronounced absorption shoulder peaks observed in rather diluted solutions indicate strong aggregations for all polymers. As shown in Fig. 2, in the solid state, the absorption spectra of the three copolymers were similar to those of polymers in chloroform solutions and slightly broad and red-shifted absorption of the main peaks can be attributed to the enhanced intermolecular interactions in the thin films. Table 1 summarized the corresponding absorption data. The absorption main peaks and absorption onsets of the corresponding copolymers caused a red-shift as group VI is ascended. Among these copolymers, PBDT-Se1 exhibited relatively red-shifted absorption compared to PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 both in solutions and in thin films. Evaluated from the absorption onsets of 682 nm, 684 nm and 687 nm for PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1, these corresponding polymers show comparable optical band-gaps (Eoptg) of 1.82 eV, 1.81 eV and 1.80 eV, respectively.

The thermal stabilities of the three polymers were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the TGA curves of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 obtained at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of the polymers were 357 °C, 397 °C, 401 °C, respectively. Among them, PBDT-O1 shows the lowest weight-loss temperatures but all of the polymers exhibit enough adaptability of the applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.


To investigate the heteroatomic impact on the electronic energy levels of these polymers, we used cyclic voltammograms (CV) to measure the electrochemical behaviors of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1. Fig. 2 shows the CV curves of the three polymers, and the corresponding measured parameters are summarized in Table 1. The potentials were referenced to Ag/Ag+, the potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the standard. The potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was measured at 0.30 V relative to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Both reversible n-doping/dedoping (reduction/re-oxidation) and p-doping/dedoping (oxidation/re-reduction) processes occur for each of these polymers. The onset oxidation potentials (Eonsetoxt, vs. Ag/Ag+) for PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 were 1.01, 1.03, and 0.96 V, respectively; their onset reduction potentials (Eonsetred, vs. Ag/Ag+) were −0.98, −0.93, and −0.97 V, respectively. On the basis of these onset potentials, the HOMO levels of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 were −5.51 eV, −5.53 eV, and −5.46 eV, respectively. The higher HOMO value of −5.46 eV for PBDT-Se1 compared to those values of PBDT-O1 and PBDT-S1 may be due to the difference in electron-donating strength of group VI. PBDT-O1 and PBDT-Se1 show similar LUMO values of −3.52 eV and −3.53 eV, and PBDT-Se1 shows a lower LUMO value of −3.57 eV. The electrochemical band-gaps (Eecg) estimated from the difference between the HOMO and LUMO values are 1.99 eV, 1.96 eV and 1.93 eV for PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1, respectively, in good agreement with the trend obtained from their absorption data.


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were adopted to evaluate the electronic distribution and geometrical configuration of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. To simplify the calculations, we used methyl groups to replace the alkyl side chains. Fig. 3 shows the simulated electron density distributions, the theoretical level and the dihedral angles. Three polymers showed similar delocalized electron density. For the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of these polymers, extended delocalization was featured by both BDT and acceptor units. Relatively, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of these polymers were more affected by the acceptor unit, which indicated the strong electron withdrawing effects of the acceptor units. PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 showed similar simulated HOMO and LUMO values of −4.83 and −2.54 eV, −4.83 and −2.55 eV, −4.82 and −2.55 eV, which means similar theoretical energy bands of 2.29, 2.28 and 2.27 eV, respectively. For the geometrical configuration, all polymers exhibited nearly planar structures. For PBDT-O1 and PBDT-S1, there are slightly larger steric angles between the BDT unit and the thienyl π-bridge in comparison with that of PBDT-Se1. The thienyl π-bridge and the BTTDO acceptor unit exhibited comparable small angles of 13.0°, 12.4°, and 12.7°, respectively. In a word, these polymers show good linear conformation, which is favourable for charge carrier transport.



Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of three copolymer-based solar cells. A typical device structure was used: indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDT-O1 (PBDT-S1 or PBDT-Se1):PC70BM/Ca/Al. A blend of copolymers and PC70BM was firstly optimized with different weight ratios. Finally, a 1:1 weight ratio was found to be the optimal ratio for all these copolymers. Furthermore, a typical solvent additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) was used to optimize the active layer morphology. As clearly seen from Table 2, one can find that DIO plays an important role in improving the photovoltaic performances of all copolymers. Without using DIO, the PCEs of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 were 1.92%, 2.54%, 4.95%, respectively. However, after adding 0.5% DIO into the blends, PCEs were significantly improved to 5.16%, 9.01%, 8.32%, respectively. It was found that a further increase of DIO content to 1% DIO led to decreased PCEs. As a result, 0.5% DIO is the best volume. Among these copolymers, PBDT-S1 shows the highest Voc of 0.91 V, which is ascribed to its deepest HOMO value compared to other copolymers. Meanwhile, PBDT-S1 shows a higher Jsc of 12.99 mA cm−2 and an unprecedented FF of 74.9%, which are higher than those of PBDT-O1 and PBDT-Se1, leading to an impressive PCE over 9%. The selenium-containing polymer of PBDT-Se1 shows a moderate PCE. The furan-based polymer (PBDT-O1) showed a lower PCE of 5.16%. It should be noted here that the Jsc values calculated by integrating the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are in good agreement with the values measured from J–V curves.

To further understand the impact of heteroatoms on photovoltaic performance, the hole mobilities of the three polymers were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only devices of ITO/MoOx/polymers:PC70BM (1:1)/MoOx/Al. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of hole-only devices. Without using DIO, the hole mobilities of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 were measured as 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which agrees well with the photovoltaic performance of the three polymers. When 0.5% DIO was used, the hole mobilities of PBDT-O1, PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 were increased to 7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 11.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.


Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface morphologies of PBDT-O1:PC70BM, PBDT-S1:PC70BM and PBDT-Se1:PC70BM blend films (Fig. 6). Without using DIO, the three active layers had rough surfaces with the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of 1.36 nm, 1.60 nm and 1.32 nm, respectively. It is observed that the surface roughness was obviously decreased with RMS values of 1.20 nm, 1.08 nm and 1.09 nm, respectively. For PBDT-S1:PC70BM and PBDT-O1:PC70BM films with 0.5% DIO, fibrillar features were observed (Fig. S8, ESI), indicating well formed interpenetrating networks in the active layers, which would facilitate the charge carrier transport. As a result, solar cells based on PBDT-S1 and PBDT-Se1 showed better photovoltaic performance compared to those based on PBDT-O1.


In summary, we synthesized three wide-bandgap BDT-based copolymers, in which different heteroatom substituents such as oxygen, sulphur and selenium were incorporated into the acceptor units. Upon increasing the size of the heteroatoms, PBDT-Se1 exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum and higher crystallinity compared to PBDT-O1 and PBDT-S1. We noticed that PBDT-S1 possessed deeper HOMO energy levels compared to PBDT-O1-based polymers and PBDT-Se1-based polymers, which can yield a higher Voc value. As a result, solar cells based on PBDT-S1 showed a high PCE of 9.0%, with a high Voc of 0.90 V. Compared to PBDT-S1, PBDT-Se1-based solar cells showed a moderate PCE of 8.3%, with a Voc of 0.85 V. PBDT-O1-based solar cells showed a relatively low PCE of 5.2% and a Voc of 0.86 V. These results indicate that the acceptor unit containing different chalcogen atoms strongly influences the performance of conjugated polymers. Compared to PBDT-O1 and PBDT-Se1, PBDT-S1 is an excellent wide bandgap polymer donor for the fabrication of high-performance solar cells.


All chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled from sodium/benzophenoneketyl prior to use. All reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (BDT) and 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (S1) were prepared according to the reported methods.



1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent. TGA measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 thermogravimetric analyzer. UV-vis spectra were measured on a SHIMADZU UV-2600 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on a computer-controlled CHI-660E electrochemical workstation in a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt button as a working electrode of 2 mm in diameter, a Pt wire as a counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as a reference electrode. Reduction CV of the molecule was carried out in CH2Cl2 containing tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte. The energy levels were calculated using a ferrocene (EFOC) value of 4.8 eV as the standard. Theoretical calculations using DFT were performed using the Gaussian03 package at the B3LYP level of theory with a basis set of 6-31G(d,p). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NanoMan VS microscope in the tapping mode.

Further purification was carried out by a silica gel column using a dichloromethane/petroleum ether (1/10) eluent to obtain pure compound O1 as an orange solid (0.59 g, yield 79%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 7.41 (b, 2H), 7.05 (b, 2H), 3.07 (b, 4H), 1.86 (t, 2H), 1.37–1.26 (br, 16H), 0.93–0.89 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz), δ (ppm): 176.4, 160.2, 140.5, 133.5, 132.0, 129.5, 128.8, 117.9, 116.9, 37.9, 31.9, 30.7, 27.8, 25.2, 22.0, 13.1, 9.9.


Further purification was carried out by a silica gel column using a dichloromethane/petroleum ether (1/10) eluent to obtain pure compound Se1 as an orange solid (0.62 g, yield 75.6%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): δ 7.39 (d, 2H), 7.03 (d, 2H), 3.42 (m, 4H), 1.68 (d, 2H), 1.45–1.26 (br, 16H), 0.96–0.89 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz), δ (ppm): 178.2, 164.7, 141.3, 135.1, 134.9, 132.0, 130.3, 129.8, 118.2, 42.9, 36.7, 33.2, 29.2, 26.4, 23.2, 14.3, 11.1.


Compound 7 (0.15 mmol) and the monomer of O1, S1 or Se1 (0.15 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of toluene. When the flask was purged by argon for 5 minutes, 8 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added as a catalyst, and then the mixture was purged by argon for another 5 minutes. The reactant was heated to reflux for 8 hours. When the reactant was cooled to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 100 mL methanol, and then filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The corresponding polymer was recovered as solid powder from the chloroform fraction by precipitation from methanol.


After the polymers were dried under vacuum, the yields and molecular weight are as follows: PBDTS-Se1: yield: 79%. Elements analysis: cal: C, 66.28; H, 6.50; found: C, 65.03; H, 6.49.


PBDT-O1 and PBDT-S1 were synthesized by using the same means as for PBDT-Se1.

PBDT-O1: yield: 70%, elements analysis: cal: C, 69.86; H, 6.85; found: C, 67.21; H, 6.74.
PBDT-S1: yield: 81%, elements analysis: cal: C, 68.9; H, 6.76; found: C, 67.74; H, 6.72.

The solar cell devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer:PC70BM/Ca/Al. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each and dried in an oven overnight. PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP A 4083) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm onto the ITO glass, and baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. After the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox, a blend solution of polymer:PC70BM with a different ratio and DIO concentration was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS layers. Then a thin layer of Ca (10 nm) and an Al layer (100 nm) were sequentially deposited under the vacuum condition of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area is 4.5 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The intensity of the solar simulator was measured using a calibrated reference solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). IPCE spectra were measured by using a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV measurements, Inc.).
