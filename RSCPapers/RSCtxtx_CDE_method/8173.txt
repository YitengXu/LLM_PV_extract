A di-vanadium-substituted Lindqvist-type polyoxometalate [Cu(C12H8N2)2]2[V2W4O19]·4H2O (1) was hydrothermally synthesized and characterized structurally by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy disperse spectroscopy tests further prove the existence of vanadium. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theoretical studies indicate that the energy level of 1 matches well with the conduction band of the TiO2. Furthermore, considering the semiconductor-like nature of 1 and the introduction of transition metal element Cu synchronously extends the absorption to the visible region, which should also be beneficial to the photovoltaic device performance. 1-Doped TiO2 composites (denoted as 1@TiO2) have been successfully fabricated by a simple sol–gel method, and introduced into the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as co-sensitizers in N719-sensitized photoanodes by mixing 1@TiO2 with P25 nanoparticles with different weight ratios to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency. The investigations show that the DSSC assembled with 1@TiO2/19P25 photoanode has the best performance and the overall improvement of the efficiency is 21.6% compared with pure P25. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay investigations show that the cosensitization of 1 and N719 can promote electron transfer and restrain charge recombinations in the DSSCs, resulting in a longer electron lifetime.

The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their low cost, long-term stability, easy fabrication process and high power conversion efficiency. Typically, the configuration of DSSCs comprises a dye-sensitized photoanode, a Pt counter electrode and an electrolyte with a redox couple. As one of the key parts in DSSCs, the sensitizer is important for high power-conversion efficiency, since it triggers and maintains the electron transfer processes in a photo electro chemical system by absorbing solar radiation. Up to now, the efficiency of DSSCs sensitized by N719 has reached up to 11–12%. However, N719 shows a narrow spectral response (300–550 nm), which is smaller than the crystalline silicon (500–1100 nm). Its photon harvesting mainly in the visible region is one of the major stumbling blocks for the further enhancement in the photo conversion efficiency. Thus it is necessary to explore novel panchromatic sensitizers, which can cover as much as the whole visible light and even near-infrared region to improve the overall efficiency. But it is presently a substantial challenge using a single dye. The co-sensitization of multiple dyes paves a new approach to obtaining a broader and more intense absorption band, finally increasing the performance of the DSSCs. As far as we know, an excellent candidate for co-sensitization should possess the following essential characteristics: (a) the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level should be higher than the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2 semiconductor for the efficient electron injection; (b) the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level should be lower than the redox mediator for the efficient electron reduction in dye regeneration; (c) the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer should be in the range of the whole visible and even the near-infrared region; (d) the sensitizer should be photostable, electrochemical and thermal stable. On the basis of the above considerations, it is important to investigate new dyes to improve the efficiency of DSSCs.

Polyoxometalates (denoted as POMs), as a large and rapidly growing class of inorganic metal–oxygen nanoclusters based mainly on W, Mo, and V, have been widely studied including their catalysis, electronic and redox properties. There are empty d orbitals in the structures of polyoxoanions, which can undergo a stepwise multi-electron reversible redox reaction and retain the original structure. POM-doped TiO2 photoanodes have been applied in the DSSCs, since POMs are good electron acceptors, which can promote the electron-transfer rate of the CB of TiO2 to inhibit the electron reflux to enhance photoelectric conversion efficiency. However, the LUMO of most of the POMs is lower than the CB of the TiO2, so there are few reports on the POM-based sensitizer. So it is still a challenge to regulate the electronic characteristics and energy levels of POMs. As far as we know, the electronic characteristics and redox properties of POMs would be changed by combining with organic groups to adjust the surface oxygen density of POMs. In addition, the absorption spectrum of the POMs can be controlled by introducing transition metal elements, which can even cover the visible light spectrum. To date, many heteropolytungstate-based organic–inorganic hybrid compounds have been reported, but the hybrids based on the [W6O19]2− and V-substituted Lindqvist-type [VxW(6−x)O19]n− as inorganic building blocks are still scarce. The main reason is that some of these isopolyoxoanions are metastable intermediates or low concentration fragments in solution, which cannot be stabilized or isolated from the common reaction systems. Generally, the hydrothermal environment may change the equilibrium phases of the POM reaction system from the thermodynamically stable compounds to the kinetically stable species. Although [Cu(phen)3][W6O19] was synthesized, the polyoxotungstate subunit only acted as a discrete cluster and was modified by organic ligands on its surface, with no inorganic ligand to link the metal centers. That is there were no covalent bonds linked between the organic and the inorganic parts. As far as we know, the substitution of tungsten atoms by low-valent metal atoms (V, Nb, or Ta) may lead to an increase in the surface electric charge density of polyoxoanions, which makes the coordination fashion more flexible.
Here, we synthesized a new mixed-addenda polyoxometalate [Cu(C12H8N2)2]2[V2W4O19]·4H2O (1) using a hydrothermal method, which was characterized structurally by the single crystal X-ray diffraction. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to determine the energy levels. Furthermore, the 1-doped TiO2 (denoted as 1@TiO2) and commercial P25 composites with different weight ratios were introduced to the photoanodes of DSSCs to explore the efficiency of 1 and N719 cosensitized cells, owing to the semiconductor-like nature of 1, its higher LUMO level and a smaller band gap than TiO2. The cosensitization of 1 and N719 enhanced the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.

Compound 1 was successfully prepared under hydrothermal conditions at 160 °C at a limited pH range of 8.1–8.5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c, which is composed of a di-V substituted classical Lindqvist-type polyanion [V2W4O19]4− and two [Cu(phen)2]2+ units (Fig. 1a). The W1/V1 and W2/V2 positions were simultaneously statistically occupied by VV and WVI elements with half occupancy for each, resulting in two VV ions per Lindqvist cage. The oxidation states of W, V and Cu are determined on the basis of the crystal color, bond lengths, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), charge balance consideration as well as bond valence sum calculations (BVS) (a detailed survey in the ESI, Table S1). All the results indicated that the W, V and Cu sites possess +6, +5 and +2 oxidation states, respectively. The Cu atom is five-coordinate in an elongated octahedral coordination environment: four nitrogen atoms from two bidentate chelating phenanthroline ligands and one bridge oxygen from [V2W4O19]4− anion form a {CuN4O} square pyramid. Such an unusual linking fashion is unique in the polyoxometalate chemistry. The bond length comparisons of M–O (M = W, V) in 1 with those of [W6O19]2− and some reported [V2W4O19]4− structures are listed in Table S2, which shows that the bond distance of M–O in 1 is comparable to those previously reported [V2W4O19]4−. In the packing arrangement of 1, the adjacent POM anions are connected with phenanthroline molecules by the aromatic π–π stack interactions to form an open-framework viewed along [0, 2, 1] and the c axis direction (Fig. 1b and S1).


The XPS spectra of the C, Cu, V and W are depicted in Fig. S2.

XPS analyses were corrected with reference to C 1s (284.6 eV). The 934.32 and 954.49 eV binding energies correspond to the spin orbit splitting components of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in the +2 oxidation state. The binding energies of 33.8 and 35.9 eV are attributed to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of the polyoxoanions, which is consistent with the WVI oxidation state. The XPS spectrum for V 2p shows two peaks at ca. 517 and 524 eV in the energy regions of V 2p3/2 and V 2p5/2, separately, which correspond to the VV oxidation state. These results are consistent with BVS calculations from the X-ray structural analysis data. The composition of 1 was also examined by the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis to prove the existence of vanadium (Fig. S3). It demonstrates the existence of C, N, O, Cu, V and W, and confirms the presence of two vanadium atoms as well as four tungsten atoms in the common cluster anion of 1.

The IR spectra of 1, TiO2 and 1@TiO2 are shown in Fig. S4. In the IR spectrum of 1, the vibrations in the region of 1521–1103 cm−1 can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of phenanthroline (denoted as phen). The presence of the [V2W4O19]4− anion in 1 is illustrated by the strong IR absorption bands at 954 cm−1, 762 cm−1 and 579 cm−1 regions, which are ascribed to the M–Ot and M–Ob (M = W or V) vibrations, respectively, which are in good agreement with the compound K4V2W4O19·8H2O. As for the IR of 1@TiO2/19P25, it can be observed that there are several characteristic peaks of 1 in the photoanode although the pure P25 peaks are too strong, which indicate that 1 maintains its structural integrity in the photoanode.

The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectrum of 1 was tested with a solid state sample (Fig. S5). The higher energy bands (225 nm and 414 nm) are mainly attributed to the O → W/V charge transfer transition of [V2W4O19]4− units, whereas the lower energy band (756 nm) is ascribed to the metal d–d charge transfer. Moreover, the lower energy band of 756 nm shows significantly enhanced absorption in the visible region beyond 400 nm, which may benefit the photoelectrocatalytic activity.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 was carried out to study its thermal stability (Fig. S6). The TGA curve of 1 exhibits two continuous steps of weight loss. An initial weight loss of 5.9% below 98.3 °C is from the release of the lattice water (calcd 3.5%). On further heating, the second weight loss occurs between 365 °C and 600 °C, corresponding to the loss of the phen ligands on the copper centers. The first step of data error may be from the adsorbed water molecules based on the elemental analyses and crystallographic analyses.

X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed to check the homogeneity of the crystalline and the bulk phase of 1. The peak positions of the experiment are in good agreement with the simulated one based on the data of single-crystal structure, indicating the purity of the as-synthesized products (Fig. S7). The differences in reflection intensity are probably due to preferential orientations in the powder sample of 1. Besides, we tested the XRD pattern of the 1@TiO2/19P25 composite to prove the anatase phase of TiO2 composite. The characteristic peaks 25.3°, 37.9°, 48.0°, 54.1°, 54.9°, 62.7°, 68.6°, 70.3° and 74.7° are observed from Fig. S8, which are in agreement with those of anatase TiO2 reported in the literature, which is the favorite phase for the photoanode of DSSCs.

In order to provide the thermodynamic driving force for charge generation, the molecular orbital of 1 was preliminarily studied by means of DFT calculations (Fig. 2), which illustrates that optical irradiation would induce electronic transmission from the [Cu(phen)2]2+ unit to [V2W4O19]4−. The LUMO level of 1 is −2.992 eV, which is higher than the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV). It suggests that 1 should be capable of injecting electrons into the CB of TiO2. The HOMO level of 1 (−5.437 eV) remains below the redox level (−4.60 eV) for efficient regeneration of the dyes. The HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg) of 1 is about 2.445 eV, demonstrating that it exhibits the semiconductor-like feature. It is known that a narrower band gap normally results in stronger visible response. So these characteristics render compound 1 the fundamental feasibility to be a potential useful sensitizer for the photovoltaic application.


The optical band gap was obtained through the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectrum for a powder sample to explore the conductivity of 1. First, a plot of Kubelka–Munk function F against energy E was drawn, in which F = (1 − R)2/2R and R is the reflectance of an infinitely thick layer at a given wavelength. The band gap (Eg) is determined as the intersection point between the energy axis and the line extrapolated from the linear portion of the absorption edge in the plot of Kubelka–Munk function F against energy E. Several POM-based inorganic–organic hybrid compounds have been reported to be promising semiconductors, such as Co2(bpy)6(W6O19)2 (Eg = 2.2 eV). As can be seen in Fig. 3a, Eg is assessed at 2.49 eV, which is smaller than TiO2 (3.2 eV).

The UPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 3b. The work function (WF) of 1 surface can be directly obtained by measuring the secondary electron cut off of the photoemission spectrum, which gives a WF value around 4.08 eV. By adding the binding energy of the onset of the band of occupied orbitals, the ionization energy (IE) of 1 was estimated, which gives the position of the HOMO with respect to the vacuum level. On the basis of the UPS results and the Eg (2.49 eV) estimated by Tauc plot analysis of absorption measurement, the LUMO level of 1 (−3.265 eV) can be calculated. It is concluded that the LUMO level of 1 lies over the top of the TiO2. All the results give good qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations. The slight difference of the theoretical calculations and experimental data can be attributed to the neglect of solvent effect in theory calculation.

SEM images of the composite films can examine the intrinsic morphology and the dispersion of particles in the photoanodes. The pure TiO2 film was observed to have an average diameter of ca. 30–45 nm (Fig. 4A and B). Some big blocks among TiO2 particles in the 1@TiO2 composite can be observed compared to the bare P25 (Fig. 4C and D). Most of the particles disperse evenly in the photoanodes, and the particle sizes become larger after doping with POMs, which also confirms that 1 was doped in the photoanodes.

Compound 1 and N719 cosensitized photoanodes were assembled into the sandwich DSSCs, their performances were investigated under the simulated AM 1.5 illuminations (100 mW cm−2). All the data of DSSCs were the average of three experimental values and the absolute deviations were calculated. The influence of the amount of 1 for the overall improvement of the efficiency of DSSCs was investigated (Fig. S9). The DSSC performance parameters are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the performance of the DSSCs with 1@TiO2/19P25 is much higher than other weight ratios. A short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.71 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.691 V were produced with a fill factor (FF) of 0.609, for a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.05%, which is better than the pure P25. The main reason for obtaining such results may be speculated that the 1-doped TiO2 could absorb more visible light due to its smaller band gap of 1 than TiO2, which endowed the cosensitized solar cell with more sunlight absorption. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) results in Fig. 5a show that the performance of the DSSCs with 1 and N719 cosensitization (1@TiO2/19P25) was enhanced compared to the single N719 (pure P25). As for 1@TiO2/3P25 performance being lower than the pure P25, it may be ascribed to the aggregation of the particles induced by the larger amount of 1@TiO2 composite. The inset figure of Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage characteristics in the dark, which implies that the dark current of 1@TiO2/nP25 cells have been largely reduced compared to the pure P25, which may be attributed to the fact that the blocking of POMs prevent the electrons from flowing back to the electrolyte or dyes with the oxidation state.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSSCs is widely used to study the electron transport properties and the internal resistances of the DSSCs. The EIS of the DSSCs with N719 sensitized cell (pure P25) and 1/N719 cosensitized cell (1@TiO2/19P25) was conducted (Fig. 5b). Table S3 lists the parameters obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of the composite solar cells using the equivalent circuit (see Fig. S10). The series resistance (Rs) can account for the resistance of the FTO glass substrate, the contact resistance of the cell and the resistance of the external circuits. There are two sets of semicircles from high to low frequency, which are classically assigned to the charge-transfer resistance at the counter photoanode/electrolyte interface (R2) and the recombination kinetics at the TiO2–electrolyte interface (R1).
As shown in Fig. 5b, the R2 is similar since all the cells have the same Pt counter and electrolyte. However, the 1/N719 cosensitized cell has larger R1 than that of the N719 sensitized cell. The increasing of resistance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface is in favour of suppressing charge recombination for improving the Jsc. Besides, the Bode phase plot also shows the results of the EIS (Fig. 5c). The mean electron lifetime (τe) can be calculated from the formula: τe = ωmin−1 = (2πfmax)−1, fmax is the frequency at the top of the intermediate frequency arc. The electron lifetime of the 1/N719 cosensitized cell was longer than that of the N719 sensitized cell (see Table S3), which indicates that 1@TiO2 to the photoanode may inhibit the recombination of the electrons with the oxide electrolyte, resulting in a longer electron lifetime. The carriers recombining with the electrolyte can be further revealed by the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) when turning off the illumination in a steady state and detecting the decay of photovoltage. The photocurrent response curve of 1/N719 cosensitized cell displays significantly higher photocurrent than that of N719 sensitized cell, indicating that the excited electrons in 1 transfer to TiO2 upon excitation. The electron lifetime is obtained according to the following formula: τe = (kT/e) × (dV/dt)−1. As can be seen in Fig. 5d, the 1/N719 cosensitized cell decays more slowly than the N719 sensitized cell, which indicates that its charge recombination rate is much slower. This variation trend is in accordance with the results of the EIS and the dark current analyses. Fig. 6 shows the mechanism of electron transfer pathways in the 1/N719 cosensitized cell. In DSSCs, the LUMO level of 1 is higher than the CB of TiO2, the 1 and N719 dyes are excited by absorbing photons and then they form oxidized dyes after injection of the electrons into the CB of photoanode. The HOMO level of 1 and N719 dyes are positive with respect to the energy level of iodine/iodide redox couple in a quasi-solid state electrolyte, so the oxidized dyes accepted electrons from the I3−/I− to be regenerated. Higher efficiency values of DSSCs might be due to both the smaller band gap of 1 than TiO2 and better UV/Visible absorption, finally accelerating electron transmission in the photoanode. Moreover, the introduction of POMs may inhibit the electron recombinations with the oxide electrolyte, resulting in a longer electron lifetime.

The excitation and emission spectra of compound 1 were investigated to explore its potential applications as the luminescent crystalline materials, which were tested in the solid state and in the DMSO solution at room temperature, respectively. The emission and excitation spectra of 1 in the solid state (Fig. 7a) exhibit an emission maximum at 338 nm upon the excitation at 291 nm. Besides, the emission and excitation spectra of 1 tested in the DMSO show two main emission peaks at 410 nm and 438 nm, and a shoulder peak at 459 nm upon the excitation wavelength at 290 nm (Fig. 7b). A red shift of the peak can be observed in DMSO solution emission spectra compared to the emission spectra recorded in the solid state, the reason may be that the fluorescence wavelength has a red shift with the increasing of polarity of the solvents.

In order to study the active luminescent group in 1, the luminescent properties of phen and K4[V2W4O19]·8H2O were also tested under the identical experimental conditions. The free phen ligand was investigated upon the excitation at 320 nm (Fig. S11), and four obvious emissions at 363 nm, 381 nm, 404 nm, 430 nm are observed. It is worth mentioning that the emission band of the phen ligand can be attributed to a π–π* or n–π* electronic transition within the aromatic systems. However, K4[V2W4O19]·8H2O shows no luminescent property. On the basis of these experimental results, it can be presumed that the luminescent properties of 1 are mainly attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer.
It is known that the fluorescence lifetime can often establish time scales for photo electrochemistry or electron transfer. The time-resolved fluorescence decay was recorded at room temperature with emission monitored at 440 nm (λEx = 290 nm) with a pulsed light source. The luminescence decay profile is shown in Fig. 8. The line is the best fit to the data using a double-exponential decay function: I(t) = A + B1exp(−t/τ1) + B2exp(−t/τ2), where B1 and B2 are the relative amplitudes, τ1 and τ2 are the component lifetimes, respectively. Average fluorescence lifetime τ is calculated according to the following equation: τ = [B1/(B1 + B2)] × τ1 + [B2/(B1 + B2)] × τ2. According to the experimental results: τ1 = 4.8212 ns, τ2 = 31.7080 ns, one accounts for 33.33% of the proportion, another is 69.67%, B1 = 536.411, B2 = 187.37. After calculation, τ = 11.7815 ns (R2 = 1.011).

All chemicals were commercially purchased and used without further purification. K4V2W4O19·8H2O was synthesized according to the literature method. The elemental analyses for C, H and N were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer. The elemental analyses for W, V and Cu were performed with a Leaman inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on an Alpha Centauri FT/IR Spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Leaman inductively coupled plasma spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on an Alpha Centauri FT/IR Spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a 756 CRT UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA7 instrument under flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded with a D/max-IIIC diffractometer. Photovoltaic tests of the DSSCs were recorded on a CHI601D Electrochemical Workstation. EIS measurements were performed on a CS350 electrochemistry station with a Xe lamp and an AM 1.5 solar filter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from an FEI Quanta 200F microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with an FLSP920 Fluorescence Spectrometer. The analysis was performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements with a hemispherical analyser Leybold EA 11. UPS measurements were performed using a He discharge lamp (hν = 21.22 eV). For the determination of the position of the high BE cut-off of the UPS spectrum (which reflects the work function of a sample) a bias voltage of 5 V was applied to the sample. The energy and shape of the frontier molecular orbitals of 1 were optimized computed by using the hybrid B3LYP functional and the basis set of SDD containing relativistic effects for W, Cu and 6-31G for C, H and other atoms were applied.


A mixture of Na2WO4·2H2O (6.0 g, 18.2 mmol), CuCl2·2H2O (0.17 g, 1.00 mmol), phen (0.20 g, 1.00 mmol), NH4VO3 (0.16 g, 1.37 mmol) and water (200 mL) were stirred at room temperature for 0.5 h. The pH of the solution is 8.1–8.5. Then the above mixed solutions with different acidities were transferred into the Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated at 160 °C for 120 h. Next the reaction temperature was slowly decreased at a speed of 5 °C h−1 to room temperature. Then the green tubular crystals were isolated and washed with distilled water. The crystals were dried in a desiccator at room temperature with the total yield of 52% based on W.

The suitable single crystal of 1 was glued on a glass fiber. 1 with dimensions of 0.24 mm × 0.23 mm × 0.22 mm was mounted on a Rigaku RAXIS RAPID IP diffractometer with Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. An empirical absorption correction was applied. Neither crystal showed evidence of crystal decay during data collections. The structure was solved by the direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method using the SHELXTL crystallographic software package. In the refinement, the restraint command ISOR was employed to restrain some non-hydrogen atoms so as to avoid ADP and NDP problems in the crystal data. The hydrogen atoms on the lattice water molecules and the phen ligands were directly included in the final molecular formula. A summary of the crystallographic data and structure refinement is given in Table 2. Selected bond lengths and bond angles of 1 can be seen in Table S4. CCDC 1412746.

In a beaker, 5 mL titaniumtetraisopropoxide (TTIP) was dropped into 3 mL of n-butyl alcohol while stirring. In another beaker, 0.05 g 1 was dispersed in 6 mL water. 1 was treated under ultrasonic irradiation for half an hour in order to completely be scattered, and the TTIP solution was added into it drop by drop. Afterwards the ivory turbid liquid was heated at 45 °C for 3 h and at 80 °C for about 3 h until a hydrogel was formed. The hydrogel was transferred into a 45 °C vacuum oven and heated for 12 h and then at 80 °C for 3 h. The product is a green powder.


The photoanode film was assembled using a screen printing technology. Before the screen printing process, the F-doped SnO2-coated conductive glass plates (FTO) were immersed in 40 mmol TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol to form a compact layer. In the preparation of the photoanode, as the phen of 1 would decompose at 360 °C, in order to retain the integrity of 1, we firstly sintered the TiO2 at 450 °C in a muffle furnace to ensure that the TiO2 composite is anatase. The 1-doped TiO2 (denoted as 1@TiO2) and commercial P25 composites with different weight ratios were introduced to the photoanodes of DSSCs. Then we prepared the paste based on the literature, a layer of paste was coated on the FTO glass plates by screen-printing, and then dried for 5 min at 120 °C to enable ethanol volatilization. The screen printing procedure was repeated four times. An 8–12 μm thickness with an area of 0.1 cm2 was printed onto FTO and sintered at 320 °C for 30 min by the temperature programmed (at 275 °C for 5 min, at 300 °C for 5 min, at 320 °C for 30 min). Next, the FTO glass plates were again immersed into a 40 mmol TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Finally the FTO glass plates were calcined once again following the same steps. Thereafter, the calcined photoanode was immersed in an absolute ethanol solution containing 0.3 mM N719 for 24 h to adsorb enough dyes as the co-sensitizer. The non-adsorbed dyes were removed with absolute ethanol and dried under a nitrogen flow at room temperature. The 1/N719 cosensitized photoanode and Pt counter electrode were assembled in a sandwich shape. An electrolyte containing 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.1 M TBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) were added to the cell.


In summary, a di-vanadium-substituted Lindqvist-type organic–inorganic hybrid compound [Cu(C12H8N2)2]2[V2W4O19]·4H2O was designed and synthesized. Its semiconductor-like property was investigated by UPS and DFT calculations, which indicate that it possesses a smaller band gap and higher LUMO than that of TiO2. In addition, the introduction of transition metal Cu extends the absorption to the visible region, which should also be beneficial for the photovoltaic device performance. The 1/N719 cosensitized solar cell configuration was constructed to detect the synergistic effect of 1/N719, which significantly improved the solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency compared with the N719 sensitization. This enhancement of the energy conversion efficiency may be due to the smaller band gap of 1 than TiO2 and better UV/Visible absorption, finally accelerating electron transmission in the photoanode. These results indicate that the refinements in the structure, composition and carrier separation of POMs would provide a basis for exploring POM-based co-sensitizers to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency. Besides, compound 1 also exhibits fluorescent properties, which may be used as potential photo-active materials. Further efforts will be focused on the construction of transition metal complexes by selecting other organic ligands and POM building blocks, leading to functional POM-based metal–organic hybrid complexes.
