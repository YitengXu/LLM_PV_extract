A BN-embedded polycyclic aromatic compound, BN-dibenzotetrathienocoronene (BN-DBTTC), is utilized for application in organic photovoltaic devices. Although BN-DBTTC has a large energy gap of 2.59 eV, the devices with PC71BM as the acceptor show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 3.12% at a donor–acceptor (D–A) molar ratio (MR) of 1:4. An open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 ± 0.01 V is achieved at a MR of 1:2. The high Voc is ascribed to the lowered HOMO level by introducing BN units into the π-system and the supramolecular interaction between the curved π-surface of BN-DBTTC and PC71BM. Moreover, BN-DBTTC is added to a PTB7:PC71BM device to control the morphology of the blend film, showing increased PCE and enhanced stability by suppressing the crystallization of PCBM. After BN-DBTTC is introduced, the domain size is reduced from ∼200 nm to well below 20 nm. At a weight ratio of PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM = 8:3:12, the PCE is enhanced from 3.91% to 4.75%, and the PCE degradation is reduced from 47.8% to 26.7% after 20-month storage. BN-DBTTC is better than 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the PCBM aggregation inhibitor in terms of process simplicity because as a photoactive material, BN-DBTTC doesn't need to be removed after processing.

Molecular semiconductors are competitive candidates for large area, flexible and low cost electronics due to their structural versatility, thin film flexibility, and capability of the solution process. Among them, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially large PAHs which are regarded as nanographenes or graphene quantum dots, are attracting a lot of attention. Friend and Müllen et al. first utilized the disc-shaped hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) as a donor and perylene diimide (PDI) as an acceptor in photodiodes and demonstrated efficient charge transfer, which pioneered the research on organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) based on molecular semiconductors. In recent years, Nuckolls and co-workers have developed a series of curved nanographenes, such as contorted hexabenzocoronene (cHBC), dibenzotetrathienocoronene (cDBTTC), and octabenzocircumbiphenyl (cOBCB) derivatives, as electron donors for OPVs, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.0–2.9%. Although the absorption spectra of the curved aromatic donors mismatch the solar spectrum, OPV devices still exhibit promising performance by virtue of the concavity of curved aromatics that allows complexation with fullerene acceptors, enabling a large active volume and enhanced exciton dissociation rate.

BN-embedded PAHs are a novel kind of organic semiconductor. The introduction of BN units in the π-system can effectively modulate molecular geometries, energy levels, and intermolecular interactions. To date, heteroaromatics containing BN units have been employed in both organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and organic field effect transistor (OFET) devices. However, the application of BN heteroaromatics in OPVs has not been reported.
In our contribution, BN-embedded dibenzotetrathienocoronene (BN-DBTTC), which has been the largest BN heteroaromatic so far, is employed in solution-processed solar cells. Devices based on the binary blend of BN-DBTTC and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) have been fabricated and systematically studied. Although BN-DBTTC has a large energy gap (Eg) of 2.59 eV which is not preferable for solar energy absorption, the devices show a PCE of up to 3.12%. A large open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 ± 0.01 V is achieved, which is ascribed to the lowered donor's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level by introducing BN units into the π-system and the supramolecular interaction between the curved π-surface of BN-DBTTC and PC71BM. In addition, the supramolecular interaction between BN-DBTTC and PCBM is employed to control the morphology of PCBM in the active layer, such as the interaction between the iodine atoms of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and PCBM. It is found that the morphology of the poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):PC71BM film cast from chlorobenzene (CB) solution could be optimized by introducing BN-DBTTC to suppress the crystallization of PC71BM. As a result, the PCE of the PTB7:PC71BM device (CB solution) is enhanced from 3.91% to 4.75% at a weight ratio of PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM = 8:3:12.

BN-DBTTC and PF-NR2 were synthesized in our lab. PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech Inc. PEDOT:PSS Clevios™ P was purchased from Heraeus Electronic Materials Division. All the solvents used in the study were purchased from Aldrich. All chemicals and materials were purchased and used as received unless otherwise noted.


ITO-coated glass (from China Southern Glass Holding Corp.) with a sheet resistance of 15–20 Ω per square is used as the substrate. The substrate was pre-patterned by photolithography to give an effective device size of 15 mm2. Prior to device fabrication, the substrates were thoroughly cleaned in sequence in an ultrasonic bath of acetone, isopropanol, detergent, de-ionized water, and isopropanol, and dried in a vacuum baking oven at 80 °C for 2 hours. After 20 min oxygen plasma treatment, a 35 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS layer was first spin-coated on the ITO substrate followed by baking at 180 °C in nitrogen for 10 min.

To fabricate the BN-DBTTC:PC71BM devices, the solutions of the active layer were prepared by dissolving BN-DBTTC and PC71BM solid mixtures with various weight ratios in chlorobenzene at 25 mg mL−1, or in toluene at 16 mg mL−1. The solutions were spin-coated on top of PEDOT:PSS to obtain a 70 nm thick layer.
To fabricate PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM ternary blend devices, the solutions of the active layer were prepared by dissolving the solid mixtures of PTB7, BN-DBTTC and PC71BM with various weight ratios in chlorobenzene at 28 mg mL−1. The solutions were spin-coated on top of PEDOT:PSS to obtain a 90 nm thick layer.
After the deposition of the active layer, PF-NR2 was spin-coated on top from its methanol:acetic acid (1000:1 v/v) solution to achieve an ∼5 nm interlayer. To complete the device, 200 nm aluminum was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask to form the top electrode in a vacuum with a pressure of 10−5 Pa. The device active area is 15 mm2.

The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit and an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) solar simulator (SAN-EI corporation, XES-40S1 150 W, AAA class, Japan) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The EQE spectra were recorded on a commercial EQE measurement system (Beijing, Zolix, DSR 100UV-B). The thickness of the organic films was determined by using a Dektak 150 surface profiler. AFM images were obtained by using a Bruker Multimode 8 system. The TEM images were recorded by using a JEM-2100F. The frequency dependent dielectric constant was measured by using a Keithley 4200-SCS in the dark. The fluorescence quenching experiment was carried out on a Fluorosens System from Gilden Photonics Ltd. The X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained by using a ThermoFisher-VG Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi.


BN-DBTTC has a large Eg of 2.59 eV, and a HOMO of −5.07 eV. As shown in Fig. 1, the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offset between BN-DBTTC and PC71BM is large enough for efficient exciton separation. The dependence of the device performance on the BN-DBTTC:PC71BM molar ratios (MR) was studied using the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BN-DBTTC:PC71BM/PF-NR2/Al. The current density (J)–voltage (V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the devices with varying MRs are shown in Fig. 2. The device performances are summarized in Table 1. At a donor (D)–acceptor (A) MR of 1:2, the Voc under AM1.5G reaches 0.96 ± 0.01 V, and decreases as the PC71BM MR increases. A similar carbon skeleton developed by Nuckolls et al., with thiophene rings fused at the opposite position, has a Voc of 0.91 ± 0.03 V at a D–A MR of 1:2. The short circuit current (Jsc) follows an opposite trend in which it increases as the MR increases. Since BN-DBTTC has a larger Eg than PC71BM (Fig. 1), the increasing amount of PC71BM in the blend can efficiently absorb more long-wavelength light, which in turn contributes more photocurrent. The EQE spectra also show that the long-wavelength edge redshifts as the PC71BM MR increases. All the devices have a fill factor (FF) of around 40%, similar to that of the contorted aromatic-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices reported before. At a MR of 1:4, the PCE reaches 3.12%, which is the best performance (to our best knowledge) for donors with Eg larger than 2.5 eV.

Compared to other OPV devices, the BN-DBTTC device has a relatively high Voc. The Voc of the BHJ OPVs is believed to correlate with the difference between the ionization potential of the electron donor (IPD) and the electron affinity of the acceptor (EAA). The dielectric constant (ε) of the blend also plays an important role in the binding energy of charge transfer excitons, thus impacting the Voc. The upper-limit of Voc (Vmaxoc) can be presented in the following equation:

eVmaxoc ≈ IPD − e2/4πε0εr − EAA ≥ 0.96 ± 0.01 eV
(1)
where
ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, and r is the mean distance of charge separation.

Since BN-DBTTC has a HOMO of −5.07 eV, IPD could take the value of 5.07 eV. Density functional theory calculations show that the incorporated BN units deepen the HOMO level by about 0.1 eV, which is beneficial to large Voc. The frequency dependent εr is shown in Fig. S1. The εr of PC71BM is around 4 in the frequency range from 1 kHz to 1 MHz, consistent with other studies. It has been reported that the Voc loss due to the dielectric effect can be completely eliminated when εr is larger than 5. However, the εr of BN-DBTTC is about 2.9 (3 kHz to 0.9 MHz), while the εr of the blend film (D–A MR = 1:2) is about 3.7 (2 kHz to 0.5 MHz), suggesting that the Voc loss cannot be neglected. In most studies, r is found to be around 1–3 nm. Assuming r equals 2 nm (median value), the Voc loss would be 0.194 eV by calculation.
In the literature, the PC71BM's EA is about 3.9–4.3 eV, depending on the measurement conditions. For example, it has been shown that the crystallization of PCBM can increase EA by 0.1–0.2 eV. If EA takes the upper value of the PC71BM's LUMO (−3.9 eV), Vmaxoc is about 0.976 V viaeqn (1), consistent with the experimental value, suggesting less PC71BM crystallization in the blend films (D–A MR = 1:2). As illustrated in Fig. S2, the photoluminescence quenching experiments show that the saddle-shaped BN-DBTTC and the olive-shaped PC71BM have strong D–A interaction. The slope calculated from the Stern–Volmer plot is 6.35 × 105 M−1, larger than that of other contorted aromatic molecules which can couple with PCBM (2.3 × 105 M−1 for cDBTTC and 3.8 × 105 M−1 for cHBC), showing strong interactions between BN-DBTTC and PC71BM even in solution. As the PC71BM MR increases, less BN-DBTTC is present in the blend, preventing the crystallization of PC71BM, thereby reducing Voc.
To verify the strong interactions between BN-DBTTC and PC71BM which could prevent the crystallization of PC71BM, toluene is used to cast the blend film to compare the film cast from CB, since PCBM has poor solubility in toluene, leading to over-aggregation of PCBM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the films are shown in Fig. S3. From the height images, it is found that the root-mean square roughness (Rrms) of the BN-DBTTC:PC71BM blend film cast from CB is 0.396 nm, while the Rrms of the film cast from toluene is 0.363 nm. From the phase images, it is found that both films exhibit good homogeneity, revealing that the phase separation is suppressed. Furthermore, the J–V characteristics of the toluene devices are nearly identical to those of the CB devices as illustrated in Fig. 3 and Table S1, confirming that the interaction is strong enough to prevent the crystallization of PCBM. To further confirm the interactions between BN-DBTTC and PC71BM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on the solid films. XPS is a powerful tool to detect the supramolecular interactions in the solid state. As shown in Fig. S4, sulfur 2p and boron 1s peaks have an obvious change in terms of shape, and shift by 200 meV toward low binding energy for the blend film, suggesting strong electronic interactions between BN-DBTTC and PC71BM. From comparison, it was found that sulfur 2p and fluorine 1s peaks of PTB7 and PTB7:PC71BM samples are identical to each other.

Since the supramolecular interaction between BN-DBTTC and PCBM prevents the crystallization of PCBM, BN-DBTTC is added to a PTB7:PCBM binary BHJ OPV system to optimize the morphology of the ternary blend active layer. PTB7:PCBM is one of the most well-studied model systems in recent years. The PTB7:PCBM blended film cast from CB suffers from over-aggregation of PCBM. Adding 3 vol% DIO to CB solution can dissolve PCBM aggregates and optimize both domain sizes and the interface, thereby enhancing the device performance. However, it's difficult to remove DIO due to its high boiling point. It is reported that the residual DIO has a negative impact on the performance and photostability of OPV devices. Contrary to DIO, BN-DBTTC is a photoactive material which doesn't need to be removed after processing. Similar to DIO, BN-DBTTC's interaction with PCBM is expected to function as the PCBM aggregation inhibitor, thereby improving the device performance.

The ternary blend device performance is shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table S2. The PCE of the PTB7:PC71BM device (CB solution) is enhanced from 3.91% to 4.75% at a weight ratio of PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM = 8:3:12. As the amount of BN-DBTTC increases, Voc increases from 0.77 ± 0.01 V to 0.81 ± 0.01 V, suggesting the compatibility of the molecules.
In addition to Voc improvement, the photocurrent is also enhanced by adding BN-DBTTC. The photocurrent can be described by the following equation.
Iph = neμE
(2)
where
n is the density of photo-generated charged carriers, e is the unit charge, μ is the charge carrier's mobility, and E is the electric field. The enhanced photocurrent could come from the improvement of the mobility or the charge density.

To study the charge transport, the electron and the hole dominant devices were fabricated. The J–V characteristics are illustrated in Fig. S5, and are fitted with the space charge limited current model. As shown in Fig. S5, both hole mobility and electron mobility are reduced when BN-DBTTC is added to the PTB7:PC71BM blend. Therefore, the photocurrent enhancement doesn't come from better charge transport but from higher charge density. The absorption spectra are examined in Fig. S6. The ternary film absorbs more photons in the 300–500 nm range, while the binary film has a better absorption in the 500–700 nm range. Since the sun radiates more photons in the visible range, the PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM film doesn't have any advantage over the PTB7:PC71BM film in terms of photon absorption. As the absorption and the carrier mobility of the ternary blend devices cannot account for the photocurrent's improvement, the charge separation efficiency should be better after BN-DBTTC is introduced.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ternary and the binary films are examined. As shown in Fig. 5, in the absence of BN-DBTTC, the PTB7:PC71BM film has large domains (∼200 nm) (Fig. 5a). The observation is consistent with what has been reported before. After BN-DBTTC is added, the film morphology becomes more uniform, and the domain size is reduced to <20 nm (Fig. 5b) facilitating charge separation. It's a general consensus that when the D–A interface distance is less than the exciton diffusion length which is <10 nm, the charge separation could reach 100%. BN-DBTTC improves the film morphology and optimizes the domain size. As a consequence, the photocurrent increases with the BN-DBTTC ratio.
Moreover, the PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM devices exhibit better stability than the PTB7:PC71BM devices, suggesting that BN-DBTTC could suppress the long-term aggregation of PC71BM. As shown in Table S3, after 20-month storage in a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature, the ternary blend device's PCE has decreased by 26.7%, while the binary blend device's PCE has decreased by 47.8%.

A large-sized BN-embedded nanographene is applied in a solution-processed organic photovoltaic device. At a D–A molar ratio of 1:4, the BN-DBTTC:PC71BM binary blend device achieves a PCE of 3.12%. At a D–A molar ratio of 1:2, the BN-DBTTC OPV device exhibits a Voc of 0.96 ± 0.01 V. The lowered HOMO level by introducing BN units into the π-system and the supramolecular interaction between the curved π-surface of BN-DBTTC and PC71BM are believed to contribute to the high Voc.

The strong interaction between BN-DBTTC and PCBM is further employed to control the morphology of the blend film, showing increased PCE and enhanced stability by suppressing the crystallization of PCBM. After BN-DBTTC is added to the PTB7:PC71BM blend film, the domain size is reduced from ∼200 nm to well below 20 nm. Therefore, the charge separation efficiency is significantly enhanced resulting in a higher photocurrent. At a weight ratio of PTB7:BN-DBTTC:PC71BM = 8:3:12, the PCE of the PTB7:PC71BM device is improved from 3.91% to 4.75%, and the PCE degradation is reduced from 47.8% to 26.7% after ∼20-month storage.
