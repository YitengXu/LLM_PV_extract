The current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis and power conversion efficiency (η) of planar type CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with TiO2 and ZnO electron conductors, which are formed by high temperature spray pyrolysis deposition at 450 °C and by room temperature spin-coating and subsequent heat-treatment at 150 °C, respectively, were compared. The ZnO based perovskite solar cells exhibited better efficiency deviation (15.96 ± 1.07%) and less J–V hysteresis than the TiO2 based cells (15.20 ± 1.23%) because the ZnO based cell has 1.2 fold longer charge carrier life time (τn) than the ZnO based cell and the ZnO electron conductor has better electron conductivity (0.0031 mS cm−1) than the TiO2 electron conductor (0.00006 mS cm−1), thereby balancing the electron flux and the hole flux more. Due to the low temperature solution processability of the ZnO electron conductor, we could demonstrate a highly efficient PEN (poly-ethylenenaphthalate)/ITO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/PTAA/Au flexible planar solar cell with 1.1 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), 18.7 short-circuit current density (mA cm−2) Jsc, 75% fill factor (FF), and 15.4% η for the forward scan direction and 1.1 V Voc, 18.7 mA cm−2Jsc, 76% FF and 15.6% η for the reverse scan direction under illumination of 1 Sun.

Solar energy has been considered as an alternative energy source for replacing conventional fossil fuel because it is clean, abundant, renewable and sustainable. Electricity is an indispensable energy form in modern life because it is the most convenient and safe energy and is portable by storing in batteries. As mobile and communication technologies are highly developed, the need for portable independent power generators is gradually increasing. Therefore, solar cells are one of the promising candidates to supply power to mobile devices because they can directly generate direct current (DC) electricity from solar energy.

To cope with the electricity energy demands for portable devices, it is pre-requisite to develop highly efficient, light weight, and flexible solar cells. For this, various types of flexible solar cells such as silicon, thin-film, dye-sensitized, and organic solar cells have been intensively studied until now. Among them, organic solar cells meet the criteria of a portable power generator in terms of light weight and flexibility, whereas their power conversion efficiency is still low, because organic solar cells with very thin active layers below ∼200 nm-thickness can be fabricated by solution processes such as roll to roll, slot die, and ultrasonic spray coating at room temperature/low temperature (<150 °C) and consequently, a light weight flexible plastic transparent electrode can be applicable.
Since Kojima et al. reported the liquid junction CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3, X = Br and I) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-sensitized solar cells; intensive studies have been done to develop highly efficient solid-state MAPbX3 perovskite hybrid solar cells because the new perovskite active materials have unique properties such as strong absorptivity due to the direct bandgap, long charge carrier diffusion length due to low trap density, high open circuit voltage due to small exciton binding energy, and room temperature/low temperature (<150 °C) solution processability. Accordingly, the light weight transparent electrodes such as PET (poly-ethyleneterephthalate) and PEN (poly-ethylenenaphthalate) can be used as flexible electrodes for MAPbX3 perovskite hybrid solar cells and high efficiency can be achieved by forming a thin active layer.
Solid-state MAPbX3 perovskite hybrid solar cells can be roughly classified into mesoscopic, bi-layer, planar, and meso-superstructured devices. Except planar type MAPbX3 perovskite hybrid solar cells, the other solar cells used a mesoscopic TiO2 or Al2O3 scaffold which requires high processing temperature (>450 °C). Planar type MAPbX3 perovskite hybrid solar cells are classified into normal (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) type cells. Inverted planar cells are composed of a transparent electrode/p-type hole conductor (PEDOT:PSS (poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate or NiO)/MAPbX3 perovskite/n-type electron conductor (PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester))/metal electrode, whereas normal planar cells are composed of a transparent electrode/n-type electron conductor (TiO2 or ZnO)/MAPbX3 perovskite/p-type hole transporting material (Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine]-9,9′-spirobifluorene), PTAA (poly-triarylamine), P3HT (poly-3-hexylthiophene), CNT (carbon nanotube) composite, etc.)/metal electrode.
Kumar et al. reported a conversion efficiency of 2.62% for normal type flexible perovskite solar cells comprised of PET/ITO/ZnO/ZnO rod/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au and Liu et al. reported a conversion efficiency of 10.2% for PET/ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag flexible perovskite solar cells. Very recently, Shin et al. reported the highest conversion efficiency of 15.3% (steady state efficiency = 14.85%) for PEN/ITO/Zn2SnO2/MAPbI3/PTAA/Au flexible perovskite solar cells. In addition, Kim et al. demonstrated that PEN/ITO/TiOx/MAPbI3−xClx/Spiro-MeOTAD/Ag flexible perovskite solar cells which exhibit a conversion efficiency of 12.2% stably work after a 1000 cycle bending test (bending radius = 10 mm) meaning that they showed the potential application of flexible perovskite solar cells in power generators for wearable devices. Docampo et al. reported a conversion efficiency of 6.5% for PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/TiOx/Al inverted type flexible solar cells and You et al. improved the efficiency to 9.2% by fabricating PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/Al.
We reported the formation of pin hole-free single crystal-like perovskite thin-films with lower trap density by using the solubility controlled MAPbI3/DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) solution with the HI additive and compared the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis with respect to the scan direction. The normal planar perovskite solar cells using TiO2 electron conductors are known to have the J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction because their electron conductivity is much lower than the hole conductivity of PTAA so that the electrons are accumulated at the TiO2/perovskite interface causing J–V hysteresis. To reduce the J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and fabricate MAPbI3 perovskite flexible solar cells without significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction, we used the ZnO electron conductor by forming it with ZnO nano-sol solution. We compared the characteristics of J–V hysteresis of the normal planar MAPbI3 solar cells with TiO2 and ZnO electron conductors and could demonstrate highly efficient PEN/ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/PTAA/Au flexible solar cells (15.5% of power conversion efficiency at 1 Sun condition).

Fig. 1(a) and (b) present a schematic illustration of the energy band diagram of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based planar type MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, respectively. Upon illumination of light, the electrons and holes generated in the MAPbI3 perovskite layer are transported into the TiO2 or ZnO electron conductor and PTAA hole conductor, respectively. The electron conductivity of the TiO2 electron conductor (∼6 × 10−5 mS cm−1) is lower than the hole conductivity of the PTAA hole conductor with the Li-TFSI (Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) + t-BP (tert-butylpyrridine) additive (∼3.4 × 10−2 mS cm−1). Hence, the electron and hole flux cannot be balanced and the electrons are accumulated at traps in the TiO2/MAPbI3 layer. To relieve the retardation of electron transport of the TiO2 electron conductor, here, we used the ZnO electron conductor due to its higher electron conductivity than TiO2. Accordingly, it is expected that the ZnO electron conductor based MAPbI3 solar cells exhibit improved device performance and reduced J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction. Furthermore, the ZnO electron conductor can be formed using a ZnO nano-sol solution at room/mild temperature so it is good for fabricating flexible planar type MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Fig. 1(c) is a SEM (scanning electron microscopy) cross-sectional image of representative planar MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells employing ZnO electron conductors (Fig. 2(d) sample). In a typical procedure for the device fabrication, we deposited ∼40 nm-thick ZnO layer on an ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) substrate by spin-coating 5.3% ZnO nano-sol at 2000 rpm for 60 s and subsequent drying at 150 °C for 10 min. ∼380 nm-thick MAPbI3 layer was then deposited on the ZnO/ITO substrate by spin-coating 40 wt% MAPbI3 in DMF/HI (1 mL/0.1 mL) solvent at 3000 rpm for 200 s and subsequent drying on the hotplate at 100 °C for 2 min. ∼50 nm-thick poly-triarylamine (PTAA) hole conducting layer with Li-TFSI and t-BP additives was deposited on the MAPbI3/ZnO/ITO substrate by spin-coating PTAA solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. ∼60 nm-thick Au counter electrode was finally deposited on the PTAA/MAPbI3/ZnO/ITO glass substrate by thermal evaporation.

Fig. 2 shows the photovoltaic properties of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based planar MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3 and ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3 films shown in Fig. 2(a) indicates that the absorption of both samples is almost the same. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based devices are similar and the calculated photocurrent density (J) from the integration of the EQE spectra of both devices are almost the same as ∼20.0 mA cm−2 and ∼20.1 mA cm−2, respectively, as displayed in Fig. 2(b). The J–V curves of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based planar MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with respect to scan direction under 200 ms of delay time (scan rate = 10 mV·200 ms−1) condition are presented in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. The best TiO2 electron conductor based devices show 1.08 V Voc (open-circuit voltage), 20 mA cm−2Jsc (short-circuit current density), 78% FF (fill factor), and 16.8% η (power conversion efficiency) for the forward scan direction and 1.09 V Voc, 20.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 79% FF and 17.3% η for the reverse scan direction under illumination of 1 Sun. The best ZnO electron conductor based devices show 1.13 V Voc, 20.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 77% FF, and 17.5% η in the forward scan direction and 1.13 V Voc, 20.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 78% FF, and 17.7% η in the reverse scan direction. Accordingly, the ZnO electron conductor based devices have less J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction than the TiO2 electron conductor based devices and the average η of the ZnO electron conductor based device has higher efficiency than the TiO2 electron conductor based device by improved Voc. The photovoltaic properties of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based planar MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 2(e) shows the efficiency of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based devices with respect to the scan direction and scan rate (delay time). The η of the ZnO electron conductor based device with respect to the scan direction is merged around 600 ms of delay time, whereas the η of the TiO2 electron conductor based device is measured at 1000 ms of delay time. This clearly reveals that the J–V hysteresis of ZnO electron conductor based devices with respect to the scan direction is smaller than that of the TiO2 electron conductor based devices. Fig. 2(f) shows the deviation of average device efficiency (ηavg) of 40 TiO2 and 40 ZnO electron conductor based devices. The ZnO electron conductor based devices (15.96 ± 1.07%) have slightly higher efficiency than the TiO2 electron conductor based devices (15.20 ± 1.23%). Fig. S1 confirms that the obtained means of TiO2 and ZnO based solar cells have meaningful difference. Fig. 2(g) shows the current density variation of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based devices with light soaking time under optimal bias voltage (Vopt) (Vopt = 0.91 V for the TiO2 electron conductor based device and Vopt = 0.95 V for the ZnO electron conductor based device) of maximum power (Pmax) point under 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination of continuous light to exactly confirm the saturated power conversion efficiency. Both devices exhibit the same tendency that the current density (J) was quickly saturated with light soaking time and was stably maintained under current experimental time window. In early light soaking time, the J curve of ZnO electron conductor based devices is more quickly saturated at ∼600 ms than the saturated J curve of TiO2 electron conductor based devices at ∼1000 ms. Accordingly, the ZnO electron conductor based devices have smaller J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and scan rate than TiO2 electron conductor based devices. However, it is known that the ZnO electron conductor has poorer chemical stability than the TiO2 electron conductor so we compared the stability of unencapsulated ZnO and TiO2 electron conductor based MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with storage time and relative humidity under ambient air conditions as shown in Fig. S2. The slightly poorer stability of ZnO based solar cells might be attributed to the more hygroscopic nature of ZnO than TiO2.
In order to understand why the ZnO based device has higher efficiency and smaller J–V hysteresis with scan direction and scan rate, we measured the current–voltage (I–V) characteristic of sandwich cells comprised of FTO/TiO2/Au and ITO/ZnO/Au devices as shown in Fig. 3(a). From the slope of the I–V plot, we can determine the DC (direct current) conductivity (σ0), I = σ0Ad−1V, where A is the area (0.16 cm2) and d is the thickness (50 nm) of the sample. The conductivity of the TiO2 electron conductor cannot be directly calculated from I–V plots due to its semiconductor property. Hence, the I–V plot was converted to a log scale plot and then the conductivity of the TiO2 electron conductor was calculated in the ohmic contact region with the slope ∼1 as shown in Fig. 3(b). The calculated conductivity of the ZnO electron conductor is 0.0031 mS cm−1, which is about 50-fold higher than that of the TiO2 electron conductor with a value of 0.00006 mS cm−1. Our previous report has described that the TiO2 electron conductor has lower conductivity than MAPbI3 (0.015 mS cm−1) and PTAA:tBP + Li TFSI (0.034 mS cm−1), so that the generated charge carriers in the MAPbI3 layer cannot be efficiently transported to the TiO2 layer because the electron and hole flux are not balanced. Therefore, it is expected that the use of the ZnO electron conductor instead of TiO2 can lead to more efficient transport of charge carriers. The diffusion coefficient (Dn) and the charge carrier's life time (τn) were also measured from IMPS (intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy) and IMVS (intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy) analyses as depicted in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively. Although both devices had almost the same Dn, the τn of the ZnO electron conductor based device was increased by 1.2-fold in comparison to the TiO2 electron conductor based device. Consequently the diffusion length (Ln = (Dnτn)0.5) of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductor based devices is ∼340 and ∼370 nm, respectively. From the results of the conductivity, IMPS and IMVS, it can be concluded that due to its higher electron conductivity the ZnO electron conductor can reduce the hysteresis of J–V curves in comparison to the TiO2 electron conductor. The Voc of the ZnO electron conductor based device is improved by the increased τn indicating that the ZnO electron conductor based device has longer electron life time than the TiO2 electron conductor based device because the backward recombination could be reduced by the improved forward electron flow due to the more efficient electron transport in ZnO than in TiO2.
Finally, we fabricated the ZnO electron conductor based flexible MAPbI3 perovskite planar hybrid solar cell on PEN/ITO as shown in Fig. 4. The calculated J from the integration of the EQE spectrum of the flexible device is 18.5 mA cm−2 as illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The flexible device exhibited 1.1 V Voc, 18.7 mA cm−2Jsc, 75% FF, and 15.4% η for the forward scan direction and 1.1 V Voc, 18.7 mA cm−2Jsc, 76% FF and 15.6% η for the reverse scan direction under illumination of 1 Sun as demonstrated in Fig. 4(b). Bending tests were performed to verify the stability of the flexible device against the bending radius. The device efficiency was measured after bending the flexible device to different curvature radii. As presented in Fig. 4(c) the device efficiency exhibits no significant decrease after bending the flexible device and fairly promising mechanical stability was observed even at a bending radius of 4 mm. Fig. S3 shows the normalized power conversion efficiency of flexible solar cells with bending radius and bending cycles indicating that the efficiency was maintained under small bending deformation (bending radius = 12 mm) but the efficiency was gradually deteriorated under a large deformation (bending radius = 8 and 4 mm) with the bending cycle possibly due to cracking of the ITO electrode (Table 2).

We fabricated low temperature processable ZnO electron conductor based MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with 17.6% average power conversion efficiency. The conductivity of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductors was 0.00006 mS cm−1 and 0.0031 mS cm−1, respectively. Although the Dn values of both devices are almost the same, the τn of the ZnO electron conductor based device was increased to 1.2-fold than that of the TiO2 electron conductor based device. Due to the better electron conductivity of ZnO than TiO2, the electron extraction from MAPbI3 to electron conductors was improved in the ZnO electron conductor based device and τn was also increased by the reduced backward recombination. Therefore, the ZnO electron conductor based device exhibited better η and less J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and scan rate compared to the TiO2 electron conductor based device. Considering the low temperature processability of the ZnO electron conductor we also fabricated the flexible device. The ZnO electron conductor based flexible devices fabricated on the PEN/ITO substrate achieved the 15.5% average power conversion efficiency with considerable mechanical stability.
