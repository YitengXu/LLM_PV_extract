Two Eu dyes, EuC28H19O9 and Eu2C28H23NO15 (named as Eu1 and Eu2) with multiple excitation, were used to co-sensitize a TiO2 photoanode with N719. Eu1 and Eu2 filled the absorption blank of N719 in the ultraviolet region and enhanced the absorption intensity of N719 in the visible region by multiple excitation. The performances of the dye-sensitized solar cell were improved by this dual enhancement in light absorption. The optical property, charge-transfer property, and electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of Eu1 and Eu2 were investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy, transient surface photovoltage measurement, cyclic voltammetry, and photocurrent–photovoltage measurement. The combination of Eu dye and N719 in DSSCs increased electron excitation, broadened the absorption spectrum and decreased charge recombination. The co-sensitized device showed an enhanced photocurrent (17.37 mA cm−2) and conversion efficiency (8.3%).

In the face of the limited fossil fuels and the disastrous environmental problem, people realize the urgent need to develop renewable energy resources for the increasing global energy demand. As a device using clean and renewable solar energy, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention due to their low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency. The dye is a key component which decides the efficiency of DSSCs as it absorbs sunlight, excites electrons and injects electrons into the conductor band of the semiconductor. The dye affects the performances of DSSCs through the following three aspects: (1) a single dye only absorbs light in a specific range of the solar spectrum. A wider light absorption range makes it easier to achieve high power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. (2) The aggregation of the dye molecules easily occurs with an individual dye sensitized semiconductor film. The dye aggregation brings dark current and decreases the short-circuit current (Jsc) of DSSCs. (3) Charge recombination occurs at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces leading to loss of JSC and open-circuit voltage (VOC) and thereby decreasing the power conversion efficiency. Co-sensitization is an effective way to solve the above problems. Co-sensitization aims to improve the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs through broadening the absorption band, preventing dye aggregation and reducing charge recombination.

The precious metal dyes (Ru-based dyes) exhibited excellent photoelectric properties and high conversion efficiency. The co-sensitization system of Ru-based dyes has been extensively studied in order to further improve DSSCs performances. Noda et al. used black dye and an organic dye D131 to co-sensitize TiO2 electrodes, and achieved remarkable performance of 11.0%. This co-sensitization systems can follow these mechanisms: (1) the electrons transfer from the black dye and D131 to the TiO2 electrode separately, (2) the different adsorption of black dye and D131 on the TiO2 surface aids the dissociation of both the dyes and transfer of the electron to TiO2 independently. Subsequently, Nguyen et al. reported a D131 and Ru-based C106 co-sensitized system. This system displayed a higher light-harvesting efficiency (11.1%) and better dye distribution on the surface of TiO2. The light-harvesting in the 400–500 nm spectral region is enhanced and the IPCE increased up to 94%. The minimized charge recombination of electrons in TiO2 with I3− is one of the reasons for the efficiency improvement. The RuNCS group of N719 is a charge recombination pathway to the TiO2 surface. Han et al. restrained this association between the RuNCS group and the TiO2 surface by the combination of D131 and N719. The photovoltaic performance of the device is improved by minimizing the recombination of electrons from the TiO2 to the oxidized dye.
Co-sensitization has also made good progress in broadening the spectral absorption. NKX-2553 and black dye obtained high photovoltaic performance (JSC = 23.23 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.68 V, FF = 0.71, and PCE = 11.08%) by complementary filling of the absorption spectral range of 400–900 nm. The squarine-based co-sensitizers (SPSQ1 and SPSQ2) with N3 dye showed a broad absorption spectral coverage in the region 350–800 nm. The device exhibits efficiency of 8.2%, which is higher than that of the individual dyes. Arakawa and co-workers reported two pyridine-anchored (NI5 and YNI-2) and one carboxylic-anchored (NI1) co-sensitizer. NI5 and YNI-2 adsorbed selectively at the Lewis-acid sites of the TiO2 surface and decreased the competitive adsorption between the black dye and the co-sensitizers. The IPCE of the co-sensitized system in 350–500 nm was improved owing to the complementary absorption and the PCE of 8.2% was obtained by enhancing the PCE values. The co-sensitizers (L1, L2 and L3) can reduce dye aggregation. As a result, the PCE of N719 + L dye is improved to 6.38%. Wei et al. studied co-sensitizers of ZnL, CdL, and HgL dye and found that the co-sensitizers complemented the absorption gap of N719 in the blue wavelength region and reduced aggregation between the dye molecules. Adhikari and co-workers studied two donor–donor–acceptor (D–D–A)-structured co-sensitizers DBA-1 and DBA-2. DBA-1 and DBA-2 improve light harvesting in the blue region owing their good light absorption at 404 and 440 nm. The co-sensitization of DSSCs based on DBA-1 and DBA-2 with Ru-based HD-2 exhibited PCE of 8.06%. A large number of dyes are being developed as co-sensitizers, and dye adsorption methods have also been investigated. Kyungtae Lee and Nam-Gyu Park reported a method for selective positioning of organic dye molecules with different absorption ranges in a mesoporous TiO2 film. The polystyrene-filled mesoporous TiO2 film is explored for use as a stationary phase and a Brønsted-base-containing polymer solution is developed for use as a mobile phase for selective desorption of the adsorbed dye. By mimicking the concept of the stationary phase and the mobile phase in column chromatography, yellow, red and green dyes were vertically aligned within a TiO2 film.
Numerous studies have shown that co-sensitizers played a major role in enhancing the performance of DSSCs. So, we designed and synthesized two rare earth complex dyes (Eu1 and Eu2) with multiple excitation as co-sensitizations. The co-sensitization of Eu dyes and N719 was used to obtain high light harvesting of DSSCs and suppress the dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface. The photovoltaic performances of the co-sensitized DSSCs were obviously improved compare to that of individual dye sensitized DSSCs.

All the starting materials were reagent grade and used as purchased without further purification. Distilled water was used throughout. The synthetic routes of Eu1 and Eu2 are depicted in Scheme 1.

The TiO2 electrode was obtained by coating a colloidal solution on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass by screen printing and then dried for 6 min at 125 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The area of the film was 0.25 cm2. The film electrodes were soaked in the dye solution (concentration: 5 × 10−4 M, solvent: absolute ethanol) for 24 h at room temperature, respectively. Then, the films were dried in air. The counter electrodes were thermally platinized conducting glass (5 mM H2PtCl6 in dry isopropanol, heated at 400 °C for 10 min). The electrolyte consisted of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.1 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 1:1 (volume ratio) acetonitrile–propylene carbonate.


A suitable crystal with dimensions of 0.24 mm × 0.12 mm × 0.05 mm was selected for single-crystal X-ray diffraction and the data were collected at 296(2) K on a Bruker Apex II CCD area-detector diffractometer (Mo Kα, 0.071073 nm). A total of 10123 reflections were collected in ϕ–ω scan mode at room temperature in the range of 1.65 < θ < 28.46° including 4016 independent ones with Rint = 0.0199. Data reductions and absorption corrections were performed using the SADBAS program. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined using full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 with the SHELXS-97 program. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were located geometrically by the program olex 2. UV-visible absorption spectra of the samples were measured at room temperature on a U-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) with an integrating sphere (model 130-0632). The cyclic voltammetry experiment was performed with a three-electrode system, a platinum working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc+/Fc) couple. The photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves of the sealed cells were measured under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) by using a solar simulator. Electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out by electrochemical work-station (chi660d, Chenhua, China) with a three-electrode system. The frequency range was 0.05–105 Hz, and the applied potential was generally between 0 and 0.700 V. The IPCE spectra were measured with a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier and a Model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 renon lamp as a light source, and a 7ISW301 Spectrometer.


The IR spectra of Eu1 and Eu2 have been measured (Fig. S1 in the ESI). The strong and broad absorption bands centered at 3500 cm−1 are assigned as the characteristic peak of O–H vibration from the water molecules. The peaks at 1535 cm−1 and 1539 cm−1 are attributed to asymmetric stretching of carboxylate groups. The peaks at 1408 cm−1 and 1400 cm−1 correspond to symmetric stretching carboxylate groups. The peaks at 745 cm−1 and 754 cm−1 are bending vibration of the C–H bond in the aromatic ring. The peaks at 500 cm−1 and 516 cm−1 are attributed to the vibration peak of the Eu–O bond.


Fig. 1 shows the solid state emission spectra of Eu1 and Eu2 at room temperature, using 314 and 305 nm filters, respectively. Eu1 and Eu2 yield bright red luminescence in the state when irradiated by UV light. Under excitation at 314 and 305 nm, the fluorescence spectra of Eu1 and Eu2 are impressive as the transition to the ground-state manifold from the emitting 5D0 level, exhibiting four intense characteristic emission bands in the visible region. The fluorescence spectrum of Eu1 and Eu2 exhibits a strong excitation peak in the visible region of 400–700 nm. These emission bands at 700, 650, 615, and 592 nm are assigned to 5D0 → 7F4, 5D0 → 7F3, 5D0 → 7F2, and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions of the europium. In addition, a transition emission of 7F0,1 → 5D2 at 470 nm is also exhibited. These characteristic emissions of Eu are in the range of the absorption spectrum of N719 (400–700 nm). Therefore, when Eu1 and Eu2 are used as a co-sensitizer in DSSCs, the light absorption of N719 can be effectively increased by these characteristic emissions of Eu. This will help improve the efficiency of DSSCs by increasing light harvesting. Fig. 2c shows normalized absorption spectra of Eu1 and Eu2 in absolute ethanol solution (10−5 mol L−1). These dyes show blue light absorption. The absorption spectra of Eu1 exhibit light absorption peaks at 200–250 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 206, 222, and 242 nm. The absorption spectra of Eu2 exhibit four light absorption peaks at 200–260 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 206, 219, and 250 nm. The multiple absorption bands of Eu1 and Eu2 are attributed to the multiple transitions of electrons, including the excitation of electrons from the ligand to the ligand and from the metal to the ligand. Eu ions can cause perturbations in the ligand-to-ligand transitions. The combination of Eu dye and N719 can not only increase the light absorption intensity of N719 but also broaden the spectral response range of the DSSCs. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DSSCs based-on these dyes is measured, as shown in Fig. 1d. The IPCE curve of DSSCs based on N719 exhibits an absorption in the range of 400–700 nm, with a maximum at 50%. Eu1 and Eu2 exhibit a narrower IPCE peak. In comparison with N719, Eu1/N719 and Eu2/N719 give a wider range (300–700 nm) and a higher value of the IPCE curve, which can be attributed to multiple absorption in the ultraviolet region and multiple emission in the visible region. This implies that DSSCs based on Eu1/N719 and Eu2/N719 would show a relatively large photocurrent. These results are consistent with the absorption spectra and the emission spectra of Eu1 and Eu2.
Transient surface photovoltage (TPV) measurement was performed to study the mechanisms of charge separation, diffusion and recombination processes. Fig. 2 shows the negative TPV response for Eu1 and Eu2. The layer thickness of the materials is much greater than the diffusion distance of excess electrons. Therefore, the TPV shape depends not only on the layer thickness of the materials but also on the carrier changes with the time. The negative TPV response implies that positive charges transfer towards the bottom and negative charges accumulate at the surface area. The electrons and holes diffuse from the surface to the bottom due to the concentration gradient. The diffusion coefficient of electrons is larger than that of holes. Charge separation of Eu1 and Eu2 increased progressively from the instant at 10−7 s until it attained a saturation value. Charge separation of Eu1 is slightly slower than that of N719 and Eu2, which indicates that the electron hole separation speed of Eu1 is slightly slower than that of N719 and Eu2. The TPV apex on the time scale for N719 is faster than that of Eu1 and Eu2, which means that the electron hole recombination of N719 is faster than that of Eu1 and Eu2. N719 has faster electron recombination speeds, and its carrier lifetime is shorter than that of Eu1 and Eu2 (as shown in Fig. 2b). The carrier lifetimes of N719, Eu1 and Eu2 are 79.78 × 10−4, 149.48 × 10−4 and 315.62 × 10−4 s, respectively. Eu1 and Eu2 effectively prolong the lifetime of photogenerated carriers in co-sensitized DSSCs and reduce dark current generation, thereby increasing the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
Cyclic voltammetry is used to study the electrochemical properties of Eu1 and Eu2, the mechanism of electron injection from Eu1 and Eu2 to a conductor band of TiO2, and the oxidation and reduction regeneration of Eu1 and Eu2 in the electrolyte. Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammetry of Eu1 and Eu2 in CH2Cl2 solution. Eu1 and Eu2 exhibit a reversible oxidation–reduction behavior. The oxidation potential (Eox) corresponding to the high occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is determined by the peak potential of CV. The first oxidation potentials (Eox) of Eu1 and Eu2 are 0.92 and 1.09 V (vs. NHE) respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of the I3−/I− couple (0.4 V vs. NHE). This suggests that the oxidized Eu1 and Eu2 formed after electron injection into the conductor band of TiO2 should be thermodynamically reduced by I3−/I− in the electrolyte. The absorption threshold of Eu1 and Eu2 is 248 and 258 nm, which corresponds to the band gap energy of 5.0 and 4.8 eV according to eqn (1).
Eg (eV) = 1240/λ (nm)

The redox potential (
Ered) of Eu1 and Eu2 corresponding to the low unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is calculated to be −4.08 and −3.71 V according to eqn (2).

Ered = Eox − Eg
(2)

Ered of Eu1 and Eu2 is more negative than the bottom of the conductor band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which confirms that the electron injection from the excited state is thermodynamically favorable. Fig. 4 shows the schematic energy levels of Eu1 and Eu2 based on the absorption and the electrochemical data. The excitation, electron injection and redox regeneration of Eu1 and Eu2 are exhibited in Fig. 4, indicating that Eu1 and Eu2 can efficiently sensitize TiO2 photoanodes of DSSCs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been widely used to correlate device structures with a suitable model for the study of kinetics of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes occurring in DSSCs. Fig. 5 shows electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of N719/TiO2, Eu1/N719/TiO2 and Eu2/N719/TiO2 based on DSSCs in the dark. In Fig. 5a, experimental data are represented by symbols while the solid lines correspond to the fit obtained by Zsimpwin software using the equivalent circuit Rs(C1(R1O1))(R2Q2). In the equivalent circuit, the symbols R and C describe resistance and capacitance, respectively; O, which depends on the parameters YO,1 and B, accounts for a finite-length Warburg diffusion (ZDif), and Q is the symbol for the constant phase element, CPE (its parameters are YO,2 and n). Under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 5a, the three semicircles located in high, middle and low frequency regions (left to right) of the Nyquist plots are attributed to the redox reaction at the Pt counter electrode and the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and charge transfer in the electrolyte (Nernst diffusion). The series resistance of the system (Rs) in low frequency regions of four sample DSSCs is almost unchanged. This indicates that the Nernst diffusion rate in the electrolyte is not affected by the sensitizer. R1 represents the charge transfer resistance of the large semicircle at the medium frequency. R1 of N719, Eu1/N719 and Eu2/N719 is 2.27, 1.75, and 1.68 Ω, respectively. A large R1 means a small charge recombination rate at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. This shows that the co-sensitization suppressed charge recombination. R2 represents the resistance of the semicircle observed at high frequency. R2 of N719, Eu1/N719 and Eu2/N719 is 80.38, 15.21, and 13.38 Ω, respectively. The decrease of R2 means that there is much more I3− at the Pt electrode surface to take part in redox reactions and hence the FF of the DSSCs is higher.
The electron lifetime (τe) in different devices was calculated from the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra of different solar cells (Fig. 5b), according to the relationship:
(3)
where
fmax is the frequency at the maximum of the curve in the intermediate frequency region in the Bode phase plot. fmax of DSSCs based on Eu2/N719, Eu1/N719 and N719 is 11.91, 12.11 and 14.36 Hz, respectively. The electron lifetime (τe) for the devices co-sensitized based on Eu2/N719, Eu1/N719 and N719 was 13.37, 13.15, and 11.09 ms, respectively. The co-sensitization extended the electron lifetime of DSSCs. The low resistance and long electron lifetime make the highest η possible.


Fig. 6 shows the current density versus voltage curves of DSSCs based on the films of Eu1/TiO2, Eu2/TiO2, N719/TiO2, Eu1/N719/TiO2 and Eu2/N719/TiO2 under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. DSSC performances of N719, Eu1, Eu2, Eu1/N719 and Eu2/N719 photoelectrodes are listed in Table 1. DSSCs based on Eu1 and Eu2 show lower short photocurrent density (Jsc) and overall energy conversion efficiency (η). When the Eu dye alone sensitized the TiO2 photoanode, the performance of DSSCs is poor, because the narrow absorption band of the Eu dye is at 200–260 nm. The photovoltaic performances of N719/TiO2 based DSSCs, e.g., the short photocurrent density (Jsc), the open circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η) are 13.54 mA cm−2, 0.77V, 0.63 and 6.5%, respectively. When Eu dyes and N719 co-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes, the co-sensitized DSSCs showed significant enhancement in the η. The improvement of η is due to increasing JSC. The JSC of DSSCs is owing to the following reasons: (1) Eu dyes yield bright red luminescence by absorbing UV light. These luminescences are located in the light absorption range of N719. The light absorption intensity of N719 is enhanced by Eu dyes and the IPCE value of DSSCs based on N719/Eu dyes obviously improved in the absorption spectral range of N719 (400–700 nm), resulting in increased JSC. (2) The IPCE spectrum of bN719 + Eu dyes displayed broad absorption at wavelengths from 300 to 700 nm, leading to enhanced JSC. (3) The impedance spectra of DSSCs show that the co-sensitization of N719 and Eu dyes reduced charge recombination. The resultant JSC for N719 + Eu dyes is improved relative to individual N719. The results show that co-sensitization of Eu dye and N719 can effectively increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and carry out electron injection and transmission in DSSCs. The photovoltaic performances of co-sensitized DSSCs are obviously increased compared with that of N719/TiO2-based DSSCs. This co-sensitization is an efficient method of improving efficiency.

In summary, two lanthanide–organic complexes, Eu1 and Eu2, are used as the sensitizer for DSSC applications. The combination of Eu dye and N719 broadens the spectral response, prevents dye aggregation and suppresses charge recombination. DSSCs based on these co-sensitization dyes yield overall solar conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This result suggests that co-sensitization of Eu dye/N719 is an effective approach to achieve highly efficient DSSCs. More work should be performed in the direction of optimizing the structure of Eu dye for high-performance DSSCs in the future.
