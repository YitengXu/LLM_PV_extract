Although the record efficiency of 25.2% was achieved using a 500–1000 nm-thick perovskite film within an appropriate device structure, it is desirable to achieve high efficiency with a thinner perovskite film because the thinner layer can gain benefits of lowering Pb content, reducing cost and better adjustability for a transparent window, flexible device and tandem structure. Here, we report on a high efficiency thin film (<200 nm) perovskite solar cell. An ∼170 nm-thick ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) film is stamped with a methylammonium (MA)-reservoir MAPbI3 film. A facilitated cation transport during stamping results in a phase conversion from orthorhombic EAPbI3 to cubic MAPbI3, along with an enlarged grain size. 1H NMR study reveals that the stamped EAPbI3 film is composed of MAPbI3 which is self-passivated with EA. A device with the stamped ∼170 nm-thick EAPbI3 delivers a power conversion efficiency of 18.0%, together with long-term stability maintaining 98% of the initial PCE after storing the device for 36 days in the ambient atmosphere. It is also discovered that the photovoltaic performance of the stamped ∼170 nm-thick EAPbI3 is superior to that of the conventional spin-coated MAPbI3 with a similar film thickness (∼200 nm) due to a higher absorption coefficient and longer carrier lifetime.

The research activity on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has drawn enormous attention since the first report on a solid-state PSC demonstrating a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and 500 h stability without encapsulation, following two seed studies on perovskite-sensitized photoelectrochemical solar cells. Owing to their superior photoelectric properties including high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length and small exciton binding energy, organometal halide perovskites have attracted attention as ideal candidates for light absorbing materials in photovoltaics. A swift surge in perovskite photovoltaics resulted in a certified PCE of 25.2% in 2019.

In addition to high performance, PSCs can also be used for specific applications such as semi-transparent windows for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) or tandem devices. For both cases, a thinner perovskite layer without sacrificing efficiency is ideally required. A perovskite film thickness over 500 nm was reported to be optimal when considering photovoltaic performance and opto-electronic characteristics, which, however, seems to be still thick to be applied to BIPV or a top cell for a tandem device. Thus a new methodology is required to achieve high efficiency with a thinner perovskite film. Reducing the perovskite film thickness is also beneficial for regulation of hazardous lead because the absolute quantity of lead per unit volume is decreased. Substitution of lead with tin (Sn) and/or germanium (Ge) may be one of the ways to reduce Pb content, which, however, showed poor performance along with poor stability. The theoretical calculation revealed that the physical reduction in thickness of perovskite films is probably one of the best ways for minimizing the lead content without sacrificing performance. The simulation of decreasing thickness from 600 nm to 200 nm resulted in a large reduction of lead by 70% along with a negligible change in the PCE. Nevertheless, contrary to the theoretical expectation, a significant decrease in performance has been accompanied by a large decrease in film thickness. To overcome the poor performance, especially low photocurrent, with a thinner film thickness of around 150–200 nm, the implementation of Ag nanoparticles in perovskite films or the use of textured structures was proposed to enhance photocurrent. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on PCEs over 18% based on planar structure PSCs with a perovskite thickness thinner than 200 nm.
In our previous report, we developed a bifacial stamping method for low-temperature fabrication of FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium) and surface modification of MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium) via facilitated ion transport. The bifacial stamping method was also found to enable a non-photovoltaic wide bandgap EAPbI3 (EA = ethylammonium) to be photoactive with the best PCE of about 13%, where the stamping of EAPbI3 with MAPbI3 allowed the introduction of MA cations into the EAPbI3 layer through the residual dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) medium, leading to a gradient distribution of MA cations (MA rich at the top and EA rich at the bottom of the stamped EAPbI3 film). This indicates that the transport of cations between two films is likely to be affected by each film’s thickness. If we could further eliminate the content of non-photoactive EAPbI3 or its derivative phase inside the stamped EAPbI3 film through reducing the film thickness of EAPbI3, the photovoltaic performance could be improved at a thinner perovskite film.
In this work, we report on high efficiency thin film PSCs obtained via a bifacial stamping approach. An EAPbI3 film was stamped with a MAPbI3 film, where the EAPbI3 film thickness was varied from 951 nm to 87 nm by controlling the precursor concentration, whereas the MAPbI3 film thickness was fixed at ∼500 nm. Facilitated cation transport during stamping led to compositional change in EAPbI3 as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and 1H NMR. Investigation of photovoltaic parameters as a function of EAPbI3 film thickness revealed that a PCE of 18.0% was achieved using the ca. 170 nm-thick EAPbI3.

Methylammonium iodide (MAI, CH3NH3I) and ethylammonium iodide (EAI, CH3CH2NH3I) were synthesized according to our previous method reported elsewhere. Typically, MAI was synthesized by reacting 27.8 mL of methylamine (40 wt% in methanol, TCI) with 30 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a round-bottom flask in an ice bath for 2 h with stirring. Ethylammonium iodide (EAI, CH3CH2NH3I) was synthesized similar to methylammonium iodide by reacting 20 mL of ethylamine (2.0 M in methanol, Aldrich) and 6 mL of hydroiodic acid in a round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h. After reaction, the MAI and EAI precipitates were collected by rotary evaporation at 50 °C for 1 h. For further purification, the resulting products were dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized in diethyl ether three times. The final white precipitates were dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h and then stored in an Ar filled glove box.


Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated conductive glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) with dimensions of 2.4 cm × 2.4 cm was cleaned using detergent, followed by subsequent ultrasonic treatment in acetone and ethanol for 20 min. Then the FTO glass was treated with UV/ozone (UVO) for 60 min prior to use. Commercial SnO2 colloidal solution (Alfa Aesar, 15% in H2O) was diluted using deionized water with a mass ratio of 1:3.2. The diluted SnO2 solution was spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 185 °C for 30 min. The 1.67 M MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2 (TCI, 99.99%), MAI and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (anhydrous, >99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a molar ratio of 1:1:1 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). The EAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2, EAI and DMSO with a molar ratio of 1:1:1 in different volumes of DMF to control the concentration to 2.5 M, 1.67 M, 1.25 M, 1 M, 0.83 M, 0.71 M, 0.63 M, 0.55 M, 0.5 M and 0.46 M. The stamped EAPbI3 (s-EAPbI3) films were prepared using a bifacial stamping method according to the method reported elsewhere. Typically, the EAPbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s, where 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dripped on the rotating substrate for 10 s to obtain an adduct intermediate film. For stamping, the EAPbI3 coated substrate was pre-annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for about 1.5 min and the MAPbI3 coated substrate was pre-annealed at 65 °C for 1 min. The pre-annealed EAPbI3 and MAPbI3 films were sandwiched (stamped) without bias pressure and then annealed at 100 °C for 9 min (see Fig. 1(a)). After stamping, the two films were detached. A spiro-MeOTAD layer was prepared by spin-coating on the s-EAPbI3 films at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Then a 70 nm Au electrode was evaporated on the top of the spiro-MeOTAD layer under 4 × 10−7 torr using a thermal evaporator.


Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS). Light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. A metal mask with an aperture of 0.125 cm2 was covered on the PSC during the measurement. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE system (PV Measurement Inc.) in DC mode, where a monochromatic beam was generated by chopping the white light from a 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan). UV-vis absorbance and transmittance spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin-Elmer). Morphology and film thickness were measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-7600F, JEOL). Steady-state and time-resolved (TR) photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, Hamamatsu) with the excitation of a 464 nm laser pulsed at a frequency of 10 MHz. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected from a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4° min−1. 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using a Varian Unity Inova 599, and the spectra were analyzed in MestReNova program. DMSO-d6 (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a solvent. 1H NMR samples were prepared by scratching the films from the substrates. Each scratched perovskite powder sample was dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO-d6 and then transferred into an NMR tube (Wilmad).


The bifacial stamping method is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The FTO substrate with a 65 °C-heated MAPbI3 film is placed on a 100 °C-heated EAPbI3 film without artificial pressure, which are heated at 100 °C for 9 min and then detached to create the stamped EAPbI3 (s-EAPbI3) film. It is noted that the pre-heated perovskite films contain a certain amount of DMSO which facilitates migration of MA+ cations from the MAPbI3 film to the EAPbI3 layer. The EAPbI3 film thickness is controlled by changing the precursor concentration. The s-EAPbI3 thickness is able to be controlled from 951 nm to 87 nm by decreasing the precursor concentration from 2.5 M to 0.46 M, as confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 1(b). The MAPbI3 film thickness is fixed at about 430 nm (Fig. S1) because the role of MAPbI3 in stamping is to supply MA cations into the EAPbI3 layer by means of the residual DMSO left in the pre-heated film. With the s-EAPbI3 film thicknesses observed from the SEM images, we plot the thickness (t) as a function of the precursor concentration (x) in Fig. 1(c). The data can be fit with a nonlinear cubic polynomial of t = A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3. For x = 1, t is calculated to be 239 nm which is close to the measured value of 240 nm. Besides the film thickness, film surface roughness also decreases with decreasing the precursor concentration, which is likely to be related to the dependence of surface roughness on solution viscosity,i.e. a more rough surface can be formed by a more viscous solution induced by increasing the concentration.

The colors of the s-EAPbI3 films change from light yellow to dark brown as the film thickness decreases from 951 nm to 87 nm (Fig. 2(a)). The dark brown color emerging upon decreasing the film thickness is indicative of a change in the bandgap probably due to the compositional change of EAPbI3 during stamping. Since the top layer is a narrower bandgap MAPbI3, stamping is likely to induce a change in the bandgap of EAPbI3 by an exchange of organic cations. The transmittance decreases as the thickness decreases from 951 nm to 154 nm, which, however, increases as the film thickness is further reduced to 87 nm (Fig. 2(b)). Absorbance estimated from the average transmittance at wavelengths ranging from 380 nm to 740 nm (absorbance = 2 − log(% AVT), AVT: average transmittance) increases as the thickness decreases from 951 nm to 240 nm, is maximized at 240 nm and then decreases as the thickness decreases further from 240 nm to 87 nm (Fig. 2(c)). The s-EAPbI3 films with thickness in the range between 346 nm and 171 nm exhibit high absorbance, which is beneficial for harnessing sunlight. The surface morphology of the EAPbI3 film is investigated before and after stamping. In Fig. 2(d) and (e), the grain size is enlarged by about 10 times after stamping. This enlarged grain size can be attributed to the intercalation of MA during the phase transition of EAPbI3 from an orthorhombic phase to a 3D cubic phase, as well as lowering of the grain-boundary migration energy in the presence of the residual DMSO environment.
To understand the underlying structural evolution of the EAPbI3 films during stamping, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are studied depending on the film thickness. Before stamping, EAPbI3 is determined to be a non-perovskite orthorhombic phase (Fig. 3(a)), which is consistent with our previous results. For the 951 nm-thick EAPbI3, the (102) peak intensity is significantly lowered by stamping and unidentified new peaks coexist. The (110) peak corresponding to the MAPbI3 phase starts to grow from a thickness of 463 nm, where its intensity is enhanced as the thickness decreases. For the thinner films from 240 nm to 87 nm, the peaks corresponding to orthorhombic EAPbI3 disappear completely, while all the peaks can be indexed to the cubic MAPbI3 phase. This is clear evidence that EA cations are replaced by MA cations during the stamping process. It is noted that the (200) peak of the s-EAPbI3 films, corresponding to the MAPbI3 phase as a result of cation exchange, shifts to lower angle as the film thickness decreases (Fig. 3(b)), which underlines a lattice contraction. This is probably related to the quantity of incoming MA cations to the EAPbI3 layer. Since the reservoir of MA cations is fixed in the 430 nm-thick MAPbI3 layer, the transported MA cations are expected to relatively increase with decreasing the EAPbI3 film thickness. Thus abundant MA cations with size smaller than EA cations in the thinner s-EAPbI3 layers might induce a compressive strain, leading to a lattice contraction. For the s-MAPbI3 case, as shown in Fig. 3(c), MAPbI3 before stamping shows a typical tetragonal phase with a distinct (211) peak that can distinguish the cubic phase. After stamping, the main peak of s-MAPbI3 shifts to a lower angle and the tetragonal signature (211) peak disappears, indicating the phase transition from the tetragonal to cubic phase. This is attributed to the incorporation of large EA+ cations, which can cause the strain relaxation, maybe associated with tensile strain, and thereby increase crystal symmetry to stabilize the cubic phase. The phase transition was similarly observed in the cation substitution reaction. When stamping the 430 nm-thick MAPbI3 with the thinner EAPbI3 films, a lower amount of EA cations is expected to be incorporated into the MAPbI3 layer, which is likely to decrease the extent of tensile strain. The shift of the (200) peak to a higher angle can explain the degree of relaxation (Fig. 3(d)).
Since the s-EAPbI3 films with thickness lower than 240 nm show the MAPbI3 cubic-like phase, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) is performed to directly check the exact composition inside the 171 nm-thick s-EAPbI3 and the 430 nm-thick s-MAPbI3 (Fig. 4). The pure EAPbI3 and MAPbI3 before stamping show the chemical shift (δ) of protons corresponding to EA and MA, respectively. For EAPbI3, a triplet for –CH3 appears up-field around 1.1 ppm, while a broad peak for –CH2–, probably a quartet, is observed at around 2.8 ppm. The δ values and relative difference in the chemical shift between –CH3 and –CH2– are nearly consistent with the previous report. A singlet at around 2.4 ppm is related to –CH3 in MAPbI3. For the s-EAPbI3, i.e. after stamping, a singlet signal is newly observed at ∼2.4 ppm, which is evidence of the transport of MA cations from the MAPbI3 layer to the EAPbI3 layer during stamping. In addition, the signals corresponding to EA are still detected, which underlines that EA still exists in the EAPbI3 layer even after stamping. From the combined XRD and 1H NMR results, stamping changes the crystal structure from orthorhombic EAPbI3 to cubic MAPbI3via a cation exchange reaction, but most of the EA cations still remain in the s-EAPbI3 film without taking part in the long-range ordered cubic lattice. The transport of EA cations from the EAPbI3 layer to the MAPbI3 layer can also be expected because the up-field triplet and singlet signals are newly detected in the s-MAPbI3. The chemical shift of protons in ammonium ions is observed at around 7.5 ppm, where a slightly higher delta value is observed for the unstamped EAPbI3 than for the unstamped MAPbI3 due to more deshielded protons by the ethyl group. After stamping, two peaks are detected for both s-MAPbI3 and s-EAPbI3. This clearly supports the transport of both EA and MA cations into the opposite layers during the bifacial stamping process. In the 1H NMR spectrum of s-EAPbI3 (Fig. S2), the peaks of A, B and C are integrated for quantitative analysis, which leads to A:B:C = 0.610:0.363:0.242. The ratio of B:C = 0.363:0.242 is consistent with the proton population ratio of –CH3:–CH2– in EA. The MA:EA ratio can be estimated to be 1:0.6 from the A:B ratio, which indicates that the higher content of the transported MA ions in the s-EAPbI3 layer is sufficient to change the crystal structure by replacing EA with MA. Similarly, integral analysis is performed for the s-MAPbI3 (Fig. S3), where the A:B:C ratio is determined to be 0.653:0.261:0.170. The MA:EA ratio is 1:0.4, which results from the transport of EA into the MAPbI3 layer during stamping. Compared to the higher content of MA in s-EAPbI3, the relatively lower content of EA in s-MAPbI3 is due to different thicknesses between EAPbI3 (171 nm) and MAPbI3 (430 nm).
Steady-state PL spectra are obtained by illumination with a 464 nm laser beam on different sides, i.e., the perovskite side and glass side as shown in Fig. 5(a), to investigate the degree of cation transport. For the 951 nm-thick EAPbI3 film, rather broad PL peaks are observed (Fig. 5(b)). The beam incident on the glass side results in a PL peak at around 560–600 nm, while the PL peak at ∼700 nm dominates on the perovskite side. The red-shift of the PL peak near the s-EAPbI3 film surface in contact with the MAPbI3 layer is a consequence of the transport of MA ions into the EAPbI3. The main peak at lower wavelength observed from the glass side measurement indicates that the major composition at the bottom of the 951 nm-thick s-EAPbI3 is EAPbI3 because MA ions hardly reach the lowest side of the EAPbI3 film. For the thinner 171 nm-thick EAPbI3 film, no difference in the PL peak position at 761 nm is observed regardless of the beam incident surface, which means that the transported MA ions are distributed in the entire EAPbI3 layer, thereby replacing most of the EA with MA.
The effect of the film thickness of s-EAPbI3 on photovoltaic parameters is investigated with a planar device structure of glass/FTO/SnO2/s-EAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. Fig. 6 shows the photovoltaic parameters as a function of thicknesses. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of champion devices for each thickness are shown in Fig. S4 and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1. As displayed in Fig. 6(a), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is significantly improved as the thickness increases from 951 nm to 463 nm due to the increase in absorbance to a great extent as shown in Fig. 2(c). Jsc values of 19.7–19.9 mA cm−2 are obtained from the thickness range of 346–171 nm, which is well consistent with high absorbance characteristics. Jsc decreases slightly upon further decrease in thickness due to a decline in absorbance. Fig. S5 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE), where EQE increases as the thickness decreases from 951 nm to 171 nm in the entire wavelength range. Afterward, the EQE decreases in the long wavelength range between 500 nm and 800 nm as the film thickness further decreases. Open-circuit voltage (Voc) seems to show a similar tendency but remains almost unchanged (∼1.1 V) for the thickness ranging from 346 nm to 128 nm (Fig. 6(b)). A slight decrease of Voc to ∼1.0 V for 97 nm and 87 nm is due to the low Jsc at relatively thinner layers since Voc is proportional to ln(Jsc). Fill factor (FF) also shows a similar tendency to Voc (Fig. 6(c)). It is interesting to see that FF hardly increases despite the fact that film thickness decreases. This proves that FF is closely related to an ideality factor and Voc at a given temperature. Eventually, the thickness-dependent PCEs show a similar tendency to all photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 6(d)). The device with a thickness of 240 nm achieves the highest PCE of 18.1% (Jsc = 19.91 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.11 V, and FF = 0.817). A slight increase in FF compensates for a slightly lower Jsc when decreasing the film thickness from 240 nm to 171 nm, which results in almost the same PCE of 18.0% (Jsc = 19.75 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.11 V, and FF = 0.821). Films with thicknesses in the vicinity of 200 nm show relatively higher FFs than thicker and thinner films. Since the enhancement of FF can be explained by the reduced series resistance (RS) due to internal conductivity of the device, low RS values of ∼3 to 4 Ω cm2, estimated from the J–V curves in Fig. S6, are responsible for the higher FFs.
The stability of a PSC with the 171 nm-thick s-EAPbI3 is investigated. The film stability is first investigated by means of XRD measurement of a fresh film and a 60 day-aged one. In Fig. S7, s-EAPbI3 shows high phase stability even after storage for 60 days at ambient temperature under a relative humidity of 20– 30%, except for a slight decrease in intensity, which might be related to the specific composition of s-EAPbI3 having a MAPbI3 phase yet with EA in the film, different from a MAPbI3 prepared by a conventional spin-coating method using MAI and PbI2 precursors. We investigated the stability as shown in Fig. 7, where the PSC employing the 171 nm-thick s-EAPbI3 retains 98% of the initial PCE (from 17.75% to 17.38%) after storing for 36 days under ambient conditions.
Since we observed the cubic MAPbI3 phase in s-EAPbI3 and a PCE as high as 18%, which was unchanged after 36 days, from the 171 nm-thick s-EAPbI3, it should be interesting to compare the opto-electronic properties and photovoltaic performance between s-EAPbI3 and conventionally spin-coated MAPbI3. A MAPbI3 film was prepared by a spin-coating method using a 0.83 M MAPbI3 precursor (MAI + PbI2) solution, which results in a film thickness of about 210 nm. SEM images clearly show the difference in grain size (Fig. 8(a) and (b)), where the grain size of s-EAPbI3 is centered at ∼630 nm with a rather broad size distribution whereas a smaller grain size of about 230 nm with a narrow size distribution is observed from the spin-coated MAPbI3. The smaller grains can produce a large amount of grain boundaries, which could act as traps for photo-excited carriers. Besides the enlarged grain size, the absorption coefficient (α) is two times higher for the 171 nm-thick s-EAPbI3 than for the 210 nm-thick MAPbI3 (Fig. 8(c)). Higher α is beneficial for light harvesting in such a thinner film. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is compared in Fig. 8(d). The PL decay curve is fit with the bi-exponential decay equation f(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where τ1 and τ2 are time constants and A1 and A2 are amplitudes. Time constants τ1 and τ2 are determined to be 7.1 ns and 146.4 ns for s-EAPbI3 and 2.0 ns and 124.1 ns for MAPbI3, which indicate that the carrier lifetimes at both the surface and bulk are longer in s-EAPbI3. The increased carrier lifetime in s-EAPbI3 is attributed to the reduced grain boundaries and the underlying surface passivation by the EA left during stamping. With the same device structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, the steady-state PCE confirms that the 171 nm-thick s-EAPbI3 shows higher PCE than the 210 nm-thick MAPbI3 (Fig. 8(e)). This indicates that the MAPbI3 phase in the thin s-EAPbI3 film formed by the stamping process is opto-electronically better than the conventionally spin-coated MAPbI3 due to larger grains, a higher absorption coefficient and a longer carrier lifetime with a similar film thickness.

We demonstrated an 18% efficiency thin film PSC using a 171 nm-thick perovskite film via a facilitated ion transport reaction by stamping the 171 nm-thick EAPbI3 film with a MA-reservoir layer. From the study with 1H NMR and XRD, 100% MA ions and 60% EA ions were found in the stamped 171 nm-thick EAPbI3, but the crystal structure was cubic MAPbI3 along with an enlarged grain size. The unique feature of the stamped EAPbI3 distinguishable from the conventionally spin-coated MAPbI3 is that a cubic-phase large grain MAPbI3 self-passivated by EA was formed by the bifacial stamping process. This could allow the carrier lifetime and the stability to be prolonged. The high efficiency thin film PSC developed by the bifacial stamping method is expected to extend its application to semi-transparent solar cells, top cells in tandem solar cells, flexible solar cells etc. It is expected that integrating the developed method in this work with the roll-to-roll technology could realize large-scale photovoltaic applications such as BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics).
