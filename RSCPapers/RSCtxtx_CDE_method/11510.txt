One narrow bandgap donor (PTB7-Th) and two ultra-narrow bandgap acceptors (COi8DFIC and IEICO-4F) were elaborately selected to fabricate semitransparent ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs). To find out the optimal content of IEICO-4F in the acceptors, a series of opaque PSCs were first fabricated with 100 nm of Ag as the electrode. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized opaque ternary PSCs arrived at 11.94% by incorporating 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors. Then, the thickness of Ag was adjusted to balance its electrical conductivity and transmittance, and the 100 nm of Ag was replaced by 15 nm of Ag as a semitransparent electrode. The semitransparent electrode possesses high transmittance in the visible light range and low transmittance in the long wavelength range, which is propitious for photon harvesting of ternary active layers with two ultra-narrow bandgap acceptors. The optimized semitransparent ternary PSCs show a synchronously improved PCE of 8.23% and an average visible transmittance (from 370 nm to 740 nm) of 20.78% compared with COi8DFIC based semitransparent binary PSCs. This work suggests the potential of a ternary strategy for fabricating highly efficient semitransparent PSCs with narrow or ultra-narrow bandgap materials as active layers.

As a photoelectric conversion technology, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been considered a promising alternative owing to their advantages in allowing large-scale production with low-cost materials and a simple solution processing method. Semitransparent polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently attracted extensive attention due to their potential applications in building-integrated photovoltaics, wearable electronic power, and photovoltaic vehicles. There are two crucial requirements for semitransparent PSCs: (i) as high a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as possible; (ii) sufficient average visible transmittance (AVT, from 370 nm to 740 nm). Much effort has been devoted to preparing transparent electrodes with high transparency and conductivity, including metal nanowires, graphene, and carbon nanotubes to achieve high AVT. The PCE of semitransparent PSCs is still lagging behind due to the lack of appropriate photoactive materials with photon harvesting in the near-infrared (NIR) light range. The strong photon harvesting of the active layers in the visible light region makes it difficult to achieve a balance between the PCE and AVT based on wide or middle bandgap materials. Recently, the rapid development of ultra-narrow bandgap nonfullerene materials has provided more opportunity for fabricating efficient semitransparent PSCs. The ultra-narrow bandgap materials have the features of a strong absorption peak in the NIR region and low energy loss in the process of charge generation. Sufficient photon harvesting in the NIR region and high AVT may be simultaneously achieved in semitransparent PSCs by employing ultra-narrow bandgap acceptors. In addition to the advantages of ultra-narrow bandgap materials, device engineering should play a vital role in improving the performance of semitransparent PSCs, such as tandem and ternary strategies. Tandem PSCs is an efficient approach to improve photon harvesting in which two or more sub-cells are integrated into one cell in series or in parallel. The complicated fabrication processes of tandem PSCs may impede their practical applications. Alternatively, ternary PSCs featuring multiple materials in one active layer has emerged as an effective strategy to improve the performance of single-junction PSCs with a simple fabrication process. The third component can play a vital role in adjusting the photon harvesting of the active layers and manipulating the film morphology. The three key photovoltaic parameters can be simultaneously improved by combining the advantages of the materials used and the corresponding binary PSCs into one cell. Inspired by such advantages, semitransparent ternary PSCs should be achieved with high PCE and AVT by elaborately selecting narrow or ultra-narrow bandgap materials.

In this work, ternary PSCs were fabricated with one narrow bandgap material, poly-[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) as donor, and two ultra-narrow bandgap nonfullerene materials COi8DFIC and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4F) as acceptors. A series of opaque ternary PSCs were prepared with 100 nm of Ag as the electrode. The PCE was increased to 11.94% by incorporating 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors, with simultaneously improved short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The JSC of the optimized ternary PSCs was increased to 23.97 mA cm−2, which should be mainly attributed to extended photon harvesting of the ternary active layers in the long wavelength range. The molecular arrangement and phase separation of the ternary active layers can be optimized by incorporating an appropriate amount of IEICO-4F, resulting in an improved FF of 69.78%. The linear increase in the VOC of the PSCs with an increase in IEICO-4F content can be well explained by the alloy model. A series of semitransparent PSCs were prepared with different thicknesses of Ag as the electrode. The thickness of Ag was optimized to balance its electrical and optical characteristics, and 15 nm of Ag was employed as a semitransparent electrode. The PCE of semitransparent ternary PSCs was increased to 8.23% with a simultaneously improved AVT of 20.78% compared with COi8DFIC based semitransparent binary PSCs. This work suggests the effectiveness of a ternary strategy in improving the performance and AVT of semitransparent PSCs with a narrower bandgap material as the third component compared with the host materials.

A schematic diagram of the device structure and chemical structures of the materials used with a narrow or ultra-narrow bandgap is shown in Fig. 1a. The normalized absorption spectra of the materials used are exhibited in Fig. 1b. The absorption peaks of neat PTB7-Th, COi8DFIC and IEICO-4F films are located at 700 nm, 830 nm and 865 nm, respectively. The complementary absorption spectra of the materials used indicate their potential in preparing efficient ternary PSCs. The absorption spectra of blended films with different IEICO-4F contents were measured and are shown in Fig. 1c. The absorption edge of ternary blended films exhibits an apparent red-shift compared with those of two binary blended films, which is due to the COi8DFIC variation in molecular arrangement in the ternary blended films. The red-shifted absorption edge of the blended films is beneficial for improving the performance of ternary PSCs due to the enhanced photon harvesting in the long wavelength range, especially for semitransparent ternary PSCs.

A series of inverted opaque PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th1:COi8DFIC1.5−x:IEICO-4Fx/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) to find out the appropriate IEICO-4F content, where x is the weight ratio of IEICO-4F in the acceptors (x = 0, 5, 15, 30, 50, or 100 wt%). The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs with different IEICO-4F contents were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 2a. The key photovoltaic parameters of all the PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The COi8DFIC based binary PSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.72% with a JSC of 22.30 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.710 V and an FF of 67.68%. The IEICO-4F based binary PSCs show a PCE of 10.46% with a JSC of 22.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.736 V and an FF of 64.28%. The VOCs and FFs of two binary PSCs show a certain complementarity, and their advantages may be recombined into one cell by employing a ternary strategy. The PCE of ternary PSCs arrives at 11.94% by incorporating 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors, with a simultaneously increased JSC of 23.97 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.714 V and FF of 69.78%. It is highlighted that the JSC and FF of the optimized ternary PSCs are much larger than those of two binary PSCs, indicating that photon harvesting and charge transport in the ternary active layers can be simultaneously improved by incorporating an appropriate amount of IEICO-4F. The VOCs of ternary PSCs are increased linearly from 0.710 V to 0.736 V with the increase in IEICO-4F content, as fitted in Fig. 2b. The linear variation in the VOCs of ternary PSCs can be well explained according to the alloy model. The two acceptors are intimately mixed and electronically coupled to form a new alloy state. The energy transfer between two acceptors, COi8DFIC and IEICO-4F, may be negligible due to their very close absorption peaks (830 nm and 865 nm). The electrons on two acceptors prefer to transfer onto the alloy state, rather than transfer from one material to the other material. This means that intermolecular charge transfer should be negligible in the ternary active layers. The EQE spectra of all PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2c. The EQE spectra of the optimized ternary PSCs are markedly extended in the long wavelength range compared with those of two binary PSCs. To further confirm the effect of IEICO-4F content on the EQE spectra of PSCs, the absorption spectra of the active layers in the cells were investigated, as shown in Fig. 2d. The absorption spectra of the active layers in the cells can be calculated according to the reflection spectra of the PSCs and a special device, ITO/ZnO/PMMA (∼120 nm)/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. S1. Detailed discussions are given in the ESI. The absorption spectral shape of the active layers in the cells is very similar to the EQE spectral shape of the PSCs, suggesting that the extended EQE spectra of ternary PSCs can mainly be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting of the ternary active layers in the long wavelength range. The absorption spectra of the active layers in the cells can really reflect the contribution of the third component to the photon harvesting of the ternary active layers.

The dependence of the JSC and VOC of PSCs on light intensity (Plight) were measured to investigate the charge recombination mechanism in binary and ternary active layers, as shown in Fig. 3a. The J–V curves of corresponding PSCs with different Plight are shown in Fig. S2. According to the equation JSC ∝ PlightS, the fitted S values are 0.90, 0.93 and 0.89 for COi8DFIC based binary PSCs, the optimized ternary PSCs and IEICO-4F based binary PSCs, respectively. The S value of 0.93 is closest to 1, implying a weakened bimolecular recombination in the optimized ternary PSCs. The correlation between VOC and Plight can be expressed as: VOC ∝ βln(Plight). If the β value is close to KT/q, bimolecular recombination should be the dominant charge loss process in the active layers. If the β value is close to 2 KT/q, trap-assisted recombination should be the dominant charge loss process in the active layers. The parameters K, T and q represent the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature and the elementary charge, respectively. The β value of the optimized ternary PSCs is 1.19 KT/q, which is smaller than the 1.26 KT/q and 1.37 KT/q of the corresponding binary PSCs, suggesting weakened trap-assisted recombination in the optimized ternary PSCs. Simultaneously suppressed bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination can be obtained in the optimized ternary PSCs, which can well explain the markedly improved FF of 69.78% compared with the 67.68% and 64.28% for the corresponding binary PSCs. To further investigate the influence of IEICO-4F content on charge transport in active layers, charge mobilities were calculated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The ln(Jd3/V2)–(V/d)0.5 curves of devices with different IEICO-4F contents are exhibited in Fig. S3. The charge mobility dependence on IEICO-4F content in the acceptors is shown in Fig. 3b. Hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in blended films are increased from 7.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (0 wt% IEICO-4F) to 1.82 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (15 wt% IEICO-4F) and from 4.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (0 wt% IEICO-4F) to 1.43 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (15 wt% IEICO-4F), respectively. The μh and μe in ternary active layers will be decreased by incorporating more IEICO-4F. The charge transport balance evaluated by μh/μe should play the key role in determining the performance of PSCs, as exhibited in Fig. 3b. The μh/μe arrives at 1.27 for the ternary active layers with 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors, indicating the more balanced charge transport in the optimized ternary PSCs. The increased charge mobility and balanced charge transport may be due to the optimized molecular arrangement and phase separation in the ternary active layers, resulting in the relatively high FF of 69.78% for the optimized ternary PSCs. The detailed μh, μe, and μh/μe ratios of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table S1. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was carried out to further investigate the effect of IEICO-4F content on the molecular arrangement in blended films.
The in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) line cuts of blended films are exhibited in Fig. 4. It is apparent that the (100) diffraction peak intensity in the IP direction of blended films can be increased and then decreased with an increase in IEICO-4F content. The (100) diffraction peak intensity in the IP direction represents the molecular face-on orientation degree in blended films. To verify the origin of the diffraction peak, the GIXD profiles of neat films were measured and are shown in Fig. S4. The (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction of blended films should correspond to the PTB7-Th molecular arrangement according to the IP line cuts of neat films. The increased and then decreased (100) diffraction peak intensity suggests that the PTB7-Th molecular arrangement can be adjusted by incorporating IEICO-4F, which well explained the varied hole mobility in corresponding active layers. The more ordered PTB7-Th face-on orientation can be obtained in the ternary blended films with 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors. Meanwhile, the (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction of blended films are slightly shifted toward the high diffraction vector (q) values with the incorporation of IEICO-4F, indicating tightly packed π–π stacking. The more ordered face-on orientation and tightly packed π–π stacking should be beneficial to charge transport along the normal direction of the substrate, which can well explain the enhanced charge mobility and the relatively large FF of the optimized ternary PSCs.
The morphology of the blended films was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to further investigate the effect of IEICO-4F content on the phase separation of blended films. The TEM images of blended films are shown in Fig. 5. Some large dark and light regions can be observed from the TEM image of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC blended films. Some nanofibrous structures can be observed from TEM image of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blended films. According to the TEM images of ternary blended films, the decreased domain size and more nanofibrous structures can be simultaneously observed with an increase in IEICO-4F content, especially for the ternary blended film with 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors. The phase separation degree of ternary blended films should be finely optimized by adjusting the IEICO-4F content, which may be beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transport in the ternary blended films. The optimized phase separation and extended photon harvesting range in the long wavelength range can be simultaneously obtained by incorporating 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors, and over 11% PCE improvement can be achieved in the optimized ternary PSCs with two ultra-narrow bandgap nonfullerene acceptors.
Based on the optimized binary and ternary PSCs, a series of semitransparent PSCs were prepared with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, and the only difference is the thickness (10, 15, or 20 nm) of the Ag electrode. Transmission spectra of Ag thin films with different thicknesses were measured and are shown in Fig. S5. It is apparent that Ag thin films possess high transmittance in the visible light region and low transmittance in the long wavelength region. The relatively low transmittance of Ag thin films in the long wavelength region indicates that incident light prefers to be reflected back from the Ag electrode, which should be beneficial to the light interference effect in the active layers for efficient photon harvesting in the NIR region. The J–V curves of semitransparent binary and ternary PSCs with different Ag thicknesses were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. S6. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of all semitransparent PSCs are summarized in Table 2. It is apparent that key photovoltaic parameters and the AVT of semitransparent PSCs can be simultaneously adjusted by varying the thickness of the Ag electrode. The PCEs of COi8DFIC based semitransparent binary PSCs are slightly larger than those of IEICO-4F based semitransparent binary PSCs. This phenomenon may be due to the greater amount of photon harvesting and ideal phase separation of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC active layers, contributing to a relatively high JSC and FF. The AVTs of COi8DFIC based semitransparent binary PSCs are slightly lower than those of IEICO-4F based semitransparent binary PSCs, which can be well explained according to the absorption spectra of the blended films, as shown in Fig. 1c. The photovoltaic parameters of all semitransparent PSCs can be markedly improved with an increase in Ag electrode thickness; however, the AVT of semitransparent PSCs is monotonously decreased. This phenomenon can be well explained by the increased conductivity (Fig. S7) and the decreased transmittance (Fig. S5) of the Ag electrode with the increase in its thickness. The PCE and AVT of semitransparent PSCs should be balanced by adjusting the thickness of the Ag electrode. Meanwhile, the PCE and AVT of all semitransparent PSCs can be simultaneously improved by employing an ultra-narrow bandgap material as the third component.

Here, the J–V curves of semitransparent PSCs with 15 nm of Ag as the electrode are shown in Fig. 6a. The JSC and FF of semitransparent ternary PSCs with 15 nm of Ag as the electrode arrive at 17.35 mA cm−2 and 66.65%, which are much larger than the 15.97 mA cm−2 and 63.28% of COi8DFIC based semitransparent binary PSCs, and 15.24 mA cm−2 and 62.62% of IEICO-4F based semitransparent binary PSCs. The VOC of semitransparent ternary PSCs is between that of the two semitransparent binary PSCs. The PCE and AVT of semitransparent ternary PSCs with 15 nm of Ag as the electrode arrive at 8.23% and 20.78% by incorporating 15 wt% IECIO-4F in the acceptors. The EQE spectra of semitransparent PSCs with 15 nm of Ag as the electrode were measured and are shown in Fig. 6b. It is apparent that the EQE spectrum of semitransparent ternary PSCs exhibits a marked red-shift compared with that of two binary PSCs. This phenomenon can also be observed from the opaque PSCs, as shown in Fig. 2c. The enhanced EQE values in the NIR region should be conducive to an improvement in the PCE of semitransparent ternary PSCs without AVT loss.
The transmission spectra of binary and ternary active layers, and the corresponding semitransparent PSCs with 15 nm of Ag as the electrode were measured and are shown Fig. 6c. The active layers exhibit relatively high transmittance in the short wavelength range, which is in good accord with the absorption spectra of blended films. The transmittance of semitransparent PSCs is markedly decreased compared with that of active layers, which should be attributed mainly to the enhanced light reflection of the Ag electrode. This phenomenon can be further confirmed from the transmission spectra of semitransparent PSCs with different thicknesses of Ag electrode, as shown in Fig. S8. To intuitively exhibit the transparency of semitransparent PSCs for human eyes, a photograph of a peony flower partly covered with semitransparent PSCs is shown in Fig. 6d. It is apparent that the peony flower covered with semitransparent PSCs can be clearly observed, suggesting the potential of semitransparent PSCs in the building-integrated photovoltaic field.

In summary, highly efficient ternary PSCs were fabricated with a narrow bandgap donor, PTB7-Th, and two ultra-narrow bandgap nonfullerene materials, COi8DFIC and IEICO-4F, as an alloyed acceptor. The PCE of opaque ternary PSCs was increased to 11.94% by incorporating 15 wt% IEICO-4F in the acceptors, with simultaneously increased JSC of 23.97 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.714 V and FF of 69.78%. Unlike the commonly reported role of the third component in improving the performance of ternary PSCs, the third component, IEICO-4F, can induce a variation in the COi8DFIC molecular arrangement, resulting in extended photon harvesting in the NIR region. By replacing 100 nm of Ag with 15 nm of Ag as the electrode, a series of semitransparent PSCs were fabricated. The optimized semitransparent ternary PSCs exhibit a PCE of 8.23% with a simultaneously improved AVT of 20.78% compared with COi8DFIC based semitransparent binary PSCs. This work indicates that a ternary strategy should be a promising method to prepare efficient semitransparent PSCs by employing narrow or ultra-narrow bandgap materials as the active layers.
