In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis and characterization of two novel donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers, IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1, which consist of indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) donor and 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1) acceptor building blocks. The resulting copolymers exhibited a wide bandgap of about 1.90 eV with a comparatively low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. However, IDTT-T1 with an extended fused-ring unit was found to have better coplanarity and higher carrier mobility (0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1). As a consequence, organic solar cells employing IDTT-T1 as the donor material afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.58%, while IDT-T1-based devices yielded a relatively lower PCE of 6.26%.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) offer a compelling approach to efficient solar energy conversion, and have received great attention due to their unique advantages such as low cost, lightweight, ease of fabrication and compatibility with flexible substrates. Through the design and synthesis of new materials, insight into the device structure, interfacial modification and control of morphology, state-of-the-art single-junction devices have been reported to reach 9–12% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Currently, most of the OSCs are fabricated with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, where the donor and acceptor materials are blended to form a bicontinuous interpenetrating network with large interfacial areas that ensure efficient exciton dissociation. The judicious design of donor and acceptor materials plays a vital role in realizing high-performance OSCs since the photons are absorbed and converted into free charge carriers in the BHJ active layer.

In the past decade, much effort has been devoted to the development of donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymers which have an alternating array of donor and acceptor moieties, because their light harvesting abilities and energy levels can be fine tuned by adjusting the photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor units. Currently, the most common design principle of D–A type polymers is to combine a weak D and a strong A unit alternately, the weak D unit enables a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, and the strong A unit can offer a proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and a suitable band gap. D–A copolymers with a low band gap (LBG) usually show a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) but a low open-circuit voltage (Voc). In contrast, wide bandgap (WBG) conjugated polymers can offer high Voc owing to their deep HOMO levels and a comparably high PCE of about 10% with a high Voc of ca.1.0 V has been reported. Therefore, the evolvement of donor materials with WBG is of crucial importance for realizing a higher PCE by tandem or ternary solar cells where WBG polymers are responsible for absorbing high energy photons.
On the other hand, it is generally accepted that the charge carrier mobility of conjugated polymers is a momentous factor as it can influence the charge extraction and recombination dynamics. The BDT units with a large planar conjugated structure have emerged as impressive building blocks in the construction of conjugated polymers. Recently, our group designed and synthesized a WBG polymer of PDBT-T1 with a bandgap of 1.85 eV, in which a more planar linear conjugated unit of dithieno[2,3-d;2,3-d]benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b]dithiophene (DTBDT) was adopted to replace the BDT unit as an electron-rich motif. When it was copolymerized with a weak electron-deficient motif of a 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1) unit, an impressive PCE of 9.7% was obtained, which is among the highest values reported in the literature for WBG based organic solar cells. Moreover, PDBT-T1 displayed a high mobility of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1. This work has manifested that the extension of π-conjugation in the main chain can be useful to get a more planar molecular conformation, which can reduce the rotational disorder of the backbone and enhance the molecular rigidity of the polymer in the solid state to benefit electron delocalization.
In this contribution, we designed and synthesized two novel donor polymers, named IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1, copolymerizing indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) with a T1 unit (Scheme 1). IDT is a widely used electron-donating unit with a coplanar symmetrical structure, which promises a high charge carrier mobility and effective intermolecular charge transfer and has been regarded as a potential candidate for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and OSCs. In order to increase the π-conjugation, the IDT unit extended by two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units was designed to form a new electron-donating unit indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene. The extended IDT system with a more rigid coplanar structure could be advantageous to π-electron delocalization, which can effectively reduce the bandgap and broaden the absorption range. Moreover, the adoption of a T1 unit guarantees a planar and rigid backbone for the resulting polymers. The optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 were systematically investigated. These polymers displayed similar optical bandgaps around 1.90 eV, and low-lying HOMO levels of −5.26 eV and −5.29 eV, which are beneficial for a high Voc. It was also found that IDTT-T1 has exhibited an impressively high mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding approximately to one order of magnitude higher than the mobility of IDT-T1 (0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1). The high mobility of these polymers is an essential requirement in donor materials for realizing high performance OSCs. Single-junction OSCs based on IDT-T1/IDTT-T1 as the donor materials and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor have been fabricated. The IDTT-T1-based device showed a PCE of 6.58%,with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 11.42 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 62.4%, while the IDT-T1 based device exhibited a PCE of 6.26%, with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 10.81 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.8%. The extended conjugated degree in the main chains of IDTT-T1 and the higher mobility than those of IDT-T1 led to a better Jsc and PCE. Additionally, the high Voc of the two polymers endows them with great potential in the application of tandem or ternary solar cells.

IDT (246.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) and T1 (153 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL of toluene in a flask protected by nitrogen. The solution was flushed with nitrogen for 10 min and then 15 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the flask. The solution was flushed with nitrogen again for 25 min. The oil bath was heated to 110 °C gradually and the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at 110 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 100 mL of methanol and filtered. The crude was purified by column chromatography using chloroform as an eluent to obtain a pure product (157 mg, 51.8%) calculated for C100H116O2S6 (%): C, 77.83; H, 7.58. Found: 77.09; H, 7.30. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) estimated from GPC are 35.7 kDa and 2.2, respectively.

IDTT (269 mg, 0.2 mmol) and T1 (153 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in 12 mL of toluene in a flask protected by nitrogen. The solution was flushed with nitrogen for 10 min and then 15 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the flask. The solution was flushed with nitrogen again for 25 min. The oil bath was heated to 110 °C gradually and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 days at 110 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 100 mL of methanol and filtered. The crude was purified by column chromatography using chloroform as an eluent to obtain a pure product (191 mg, 58.7%) calculated for C104H116O2S8 (%): C, 75.50; H, 7.07. Found: 74.74; H, 6.85. the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) estimated from GPC are 25.8 kDa and 1.7 for IDTT-T1.
The thermal properties of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 are evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The recorded TGA curves are recorded as in Fig. 1a. High decomposition temperatures (Td) of 425 °C for IDT-T1 and 433 °C for IDTT-T1 were observed during the heating process at a 5% weight loss, indicating excellent thermal stability for both polymers.

The normalized optical absorption spectra of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 in dilute chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. It was observed that these two copolymers displayed similar absorption spectra. In comparison with the main absorption peak of IDT-T1 located at 560 nm, the absorption peaks showed a red shift of about 6 nm for IDTT-T1, which can be attributed to the extended conjugation length and the enhanced π–π stacking effect of the polymer backbone. Moreover, there was a more pronounced shoulder at 596 nm in the IDTT-T1 solid film compared to that in IDT-T1, which might have resulted from the better crystallization of the donor material. Additionally, IDT-T1 exhibited similar absorption spectra in solution to those in the solid state in which two absorption peaks at 554 nm and 560 nm were observed. The main absorption peak of IDTT-T1 was located at 553 nm in a diluted chloroform solution and there are two absorption shoulders at 566 nm and 596 nm in the thin film. Compared with the absorption of the solution, the spectra of the two copolymers were slightly red-shifted in the solid state, originating from the molecular backbones with a more ordered arrangement in the construction of polymers and π–π stacking interaction. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 polymers were estimated to be ca. 1.90 eV from the absorption onset in the film spectra.


To evaluate their electrochemical properties, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed. The HOMO values of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), the HOMO energy levels of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 are −5.26 eV and −5.29 eV, respectively (Table 1). Considering the slightly deeper HOMO of IDTT-T1, a higher Voc was anticipated. Through the CV measurements, we estimated the bandgaps of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1, which are confirmed to be 1.80 eV and 1.79 eV, respectively. The LUMO values of −3.48 eV for IDT-T1 and −3.50 eV for IDTT-T1 were determined via the differences between the HOMO and the optical band gap. The frontier molecular orbitals and optimized molecular geometries are illustrated in Fig. 1d.

Quantum chemistry calculation by density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set was employed to evaluate the electronic structure and the frontier molecular orbital of these copolymers. As displayed in Fig. 2, the conjugated backbone of IDTT-T1 exhibited better planarity than that of IDT-T1, which is a good interpretation for higher charge mobility. Meanwhile, the resulting theoretical HOMO and LUMO level positions are illustrated as well. The electron densities in the HOMO wave function extend across the entire conjugated systems from donor to acceptor units. However, the LUMO of the polymers is more localized on the acceptor units, indicating that the T1 unit possesses a strong electron withdrawing effect.


The photovoltaic devices adopted a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Ca/Al. ITO-coated glass was ultrasonically cleaned in soapy water, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven and treated with UV ozone for 20 min before use. A 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP A 4083) layer was spin-cast on top of the ITO substrates and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air.

The mixture of a polymer donor with PC71BM with different additive contents and weight ratios was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and stirred at 80 °C overnight. The polymer concentration was fixed at 15 mg mL−1. The mixed solution was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS substrate to form the active layer. The optimal thickness of the active layers was found to be 120 nm using an Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer. Finally, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) layers were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation. Current density–voltage characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit.

In order to investigate the effect of different weight ratios of donors to acceptors on the device performance, IDT-T1 (or IDTT-T1) with PC71BM in DCB in the ratio range from 1:1 to 1:3 was tested (Fig. S4, ESI). We found that IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1-based donors of PSCs exhibited the best PCEs when the ratios of donors to acceptors were 1:2 and 1:2.5, respectively. Without any solvent additive and thermal treatment, the PCEs of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 achieved 5.44% and 5.65%, respectively. However, with the increase of the acceptor content, the performances of the devices displayed a decreasing tendency, which were probably ascribed to the formation of aggregation domains of the fullerene in the active layers. The detailed parameters of the solar cells are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI). For the purpose of further improving the performance, we selected two kinds of commercially available solvent additives of DPE and DIO to control the morphology and crystallinity in the BHJ films. The amount of DPE from 0.25% to 1% solution volume in the active layer based on the optimized weight ratios of polymer donors and PC71BM (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI) was optimized. The best PCEs of IDT-T1-based and IDTT-T1-based donors of PSCs were 6.26% and 6.58%, respectively, when 0.75% v/v DPE were added. The two polymers share a similar Voc of about 0.92 V, proving that the extended conjugation has no negative effect on the Voc. Moreover, IDTT-T1-based devices exhibited a higher Jsc of 11.42 mA cm−2, while IDT-T1 based OSCs showed a lower Jsc of 10.81 mA cm−2. The higher Jsc achieved in IDTT-T1:PC71BM may be attributed to the enhanced mobility obtained in the corresponding devices and a more uniform morphology of the active layer. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells are shown in Fig. 3a and b, and the detailed device parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Similarly, with the introduction of 0.75% v/v DIO, the best efficiencies of IDT-T1-based and IDTT-T1-based PSCs achieved 5.88% and 6.20%, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI).

The corresponding incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3c and d. The IPCE curves presented broad responses in the range of 300–700 nm for all the devices. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE curves were 10.62 and 11.50 mA cm−2 for IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1, respectively, in good agreement with the results obtained from J–V measurements. It is worth noting that the EQE of the IDTT-T1-based device is higher than that of the IDT-T1-based device from 300 nm to 700 nm, which could lead to a higher Jsc and further a better performance.

To measure the hole mobility of the two copolymers, OFETs were fabricated with a bottom-gate/bottom-contact configuration, in which a heavily n+-doped Si layer acted as the gate electrode and silicon oxide (SiO2) was adopted as the dielectric layer. Gold source/drain electrodes with titanium as the adhesion layer were evaporated onto the SiO2 layer. The transfer characteristic curves of the electrical properties were measured using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer. One can find that when the film of IDT-T1 was annealed at 150 °C for 5 min, the on/off ratio of the OFETs was 7.31 × 104, and the threshold voltage was −27.1 V. The highest mobility of IDT-T1 is 0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1. When IDTT-T1 was spin coated onto OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates and further heated at 170 °C for 5 min, the parameters of the on/off ratio and the threshold voltage were 4.45 × 105 and −29.3 V, respectively. The maximum mobility of IDTT-T1 was found to be 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is among the highest reported for solution-processed donor materials. Fig. 4a presents the transfer characteristics of OFETs based on IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1. The detailed parameters are described in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI).


The charge transport properties of the IDT-T1 (or IDTT-T1):PC71BM blend films were determined using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) technique. SCLC measurements acquire the vertical mobility of charge carriers transporting between bottom and top electrodes in a vertically stacked device analogous to the structures adopted for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the hole mobilities of neat IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 are calculated to be 2.49 × 10−3 and 3.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher mobility of IDTT-T1 probably resulted from the extended π-conjugation. Furthermore, the hole mobility of the blend films was measured with the device structure ITO/MoOx/IDT-T1 (or IDTT-T1):PC71BM/MoOx/Al, and the electron mobility was taken by using the device structure ITO/Al/IDT-T1 (or IDTT-T1):PC71BM/Al. The estimated hole mobilities (μe) from the J–V curve characteristics are 1.53 × 10−3 and 1.69 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-T1:PC71BM and IDTT-T1:PC71BM blend films without the DPE additive, respectively. In the case of blend films with DPE, the hole mobilities were increased to 1.90 × 10−3 and 2.18 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1. And the electron mobilities of IDT-T1:PC71BM and IDTT-T1:PC71BM after the addition of DPE are μe = 2.60 × 10−3 and 2.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). The higher carrier mobilities and a more balanced carrier transport obtained in IDTT-T1:PC71BM blends helps explain the higher Jsc than that of IDT-T1-based devices.


To further gain an insight into the surface morphology of the IDT-T1:PC71BM and IDTT-T1:PC71BM blends, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (c), without the introduction of the DPE additive, the surfaces of the blend films are fairly smooth and uniform with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.45 and 0.39 nm for IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1, respectively. When 0.75% of DPE was added into the active layers, both of the blend films showed a better phase separation and the RMS of IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 increased to 0.79 and 0.42 nm. A rougher surface of the films with DPE may facilitate the light scattering between the active layer/electrode interface, thereby resulting in an improvement of light absorption and further increasing the photocurrent. Additionally, the morphology of the blend films with or without DPE was also investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The obtained TEM images of the blend films are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). It was observed that upon the addition of the DPE additive, both the IDT-T1:PC71BM and IDTT-T1:PC71BM blends displayed a more distributed nanostructure, which is correlated well with the morphologies observed by AFM.


In conclusion, two novel conjugated polymers, IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1, have been synthesized and characterized to investigate the effect of extending the π-conjugation length on the optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers. The copolymerization of IDTT with T1 resulted in a copolymer with a longer effective conjugation and a better planarity to improve the charge mobility. IDT-T1 and IDTT-T1 exhibited remarkable field-effect mobilities of 2.05 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.13 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which will facilitate the charge transport in the active layers. In addition, the optimal blend morphology with a well-developed intermixing of phases in the IDTT-T1-based device was favorable to the charge mobility and transfer properties. As a consequence, a PCE of 6.58% was achieved in the device fabricated with IDTT-T1:PC71BM, while the IDT-T1 based device yielded a PCE of 6.26%. This work successfully proved that the extended π-conjugation length in the main chain of the polymer can be an effective strategy to increase the mobility of the conjugated polymer and further promote the performance of the photovoltaic devices.
