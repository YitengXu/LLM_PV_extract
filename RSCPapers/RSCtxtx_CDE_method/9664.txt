Bathophenanthroline (Bphen), an electron transporting material widely used in organic light-emitting diodes, was added as a third component into a mixed solution of poly(thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene) (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to fabricate simplified inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). Bphen spontaneously migrated onto the ITO cathode during spin coating, and thereby formed a thin modifying interlayer between the cathode and the active layer. PSCs based on the ternary blend PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen showed a power conversion efficiency of 5.35%, higher than that of the binary blend PTB7:PC71BM in an inverted structure of ITO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag without an additional cathode-modifying interlayer (3.43%). The other electron transporting materials, 1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene (TPBI) and bathocuproine (BCP), were also confirmed to function as Bphen. This strategy simplifies the structure of inverted PSCs without significant loss in efficiency.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained enormous attention during the past two decades, because of their solution processability at room temperature, potentially offering the cost-effective conversion of the solar light into electricity. To date, the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of both the single- and multi-junction PSCs have reached 10–11%, nearly comparable to those of amorphous/microcrystalline silicon solar cells. However, to participate in commercial competition with the other solution-processed thin-film photovoltaic technologies, e.g., perovskite and CIGS solar cells, on the one hand, the PCE of PSCs needs to be further improved to the level of 15–20%; on the other hand, the fabrication cost of PSCs has to be further decreased, calling for the urgent efforts to simplify the device structure of PSCs without loss in PCE.

The key part in PSCs is the absorption of incident light by the photoactive layer and subsequent generation of free holes and electrons. The strategy to constitute a photoactive layer is to create the bulk-heterojunction blend thin film of semiconducting polymer as the electron donor and a fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor. The narrow bandgap and deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital are characteristics of the most efficient electron donors, e.g., poly(thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene) (PTB7), which can offer both high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) for photovoltaic devices. The [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is an electron acceptor enabling the synthesis of best-performing PSCs to date. To enhance the selective extraction of the free charge carriers from the photoactive layer into the electrode, buffer layers to modify anode and cathode have been developed.
For PSCs, the inverted structure possesses obvious advantage over the regular one. First, the inverted structure does not necessarily adopt the low-work function metals sensitive to humidity and oxygen and the acidic conducting polymer (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) corrosive to the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode; therefore, having a better stability than the regular structure. Second, the photoactive layer in the inverted structure is more favorable for charge collection at correct electrodes than that in the regular one, because of the vertical composition profile of donor-rich zone close to the top surface and acceptor-rich zone close to the bottom surface in the blend film. The best PCEs in inverted PSCs have obtained 10–11%. The cathode buffer layer is an indispensible part to enhance the device performance in inverted PSCs. The semiconducting metal oxides, e.g., TiO2 and ZnO, can function well to modify the cathode, but they need calcination at a temperature over 150 °C, which is not compatible with high-volume solution processing such as roll-to-roll coating. The alcohol soluble organic materials, e.g., PFN, PEIE, and amine-modified fullerene, can tolerate the deposition of the photoactive layer and also form an ohmic contact between cathode and photoactive layer, but their hygroscopicity reduces the device stability. From a practical and economical point of view, it is desirable to design a novel photoactive layer warranting no use of a cathode buffer layer in inverted PSCs.
Recently, ternary blend PSCs have attracted much attention. In particular, the ternary blends containing a third component as a self-assembled buffer layer has been developed. For example, fullerene derivatives used as the third component migrated towards the air surface of a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) blend, thereby forming ohmic contact with the Al cathode in a regular device. An amine-functionalized fullerene PCBDAN as an additive self-assembled at the bottom of a P3HT:PC61BM blend in the inverted device.
The electron transporting materials (ETM) widely used in organic light-emitting diodes have been used to construct the ohmic contact with the cathode to improve the performance of PSCs such as 1,3,5-tris(2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene (TPBI), bathocuproine (BCP), and bathophenanthroline (Bphen) (Fig. 1). Recently, BCP was added as an additive into a P3HT:PC61BM blend and the inverted PSC ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM:BCP/MoO3/Al showed a higher PCE than ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Al. To date, the use of ETM-assisted ternary blends aimed at structure simplification of inverted PSCs has had little attention.
In the present study, ternary blend solar cells based on PTB7:PC71BM using an ETM (Bphen, BCP and TPBI) as a third component are fabricated. The ETM can aggregate at the cathode substrate prior to the polymer and fullerene derivative during spin-coating and serve as a cathode buffer layer. The inverted device based on a PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen blend film simply using ITO alone as cathode without an additional cathode-modifying interlayer delivers a PCE of 5.35%, higher than that obtained from the control device without Bphen (3.43%). This study provides a promising route towards the low-cost commercialization of inverted PSCs.

PTB7 with weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 97500 and polydispersity index of 2.1 was obtained from 1-material Chemscitech. PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source Inc. MoO3, Bphen, BCP and TPBI were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the materials were used as received.


Inverted solar cells were fabricated using ITO as the cathode. The ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω per square) were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in a ultrasonic horn for 30 min each and subsequently dried in an oven at 150 °C for 20 min. Then, the cathode substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O) with no further treatment for inverted device fabrication and measurement. The photoactive layers were fabricated onto the ITO substrates. The PTB7:PC71BM thin films were spin-cast for 60 s at a speed of 1250 rpm from a mixed 10 mg ml−1 PTB7 and 15 mg ml−1 PC71BM solution using a mixed solvent of 1,2-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume). The PTB7:PC71BM:ETM thin films were spin-cast for 60 s at a speed of 1250 rpm from a mixed 10 mg ml−1 PTB7, 15 mg ml−1 PC71BM, and x mg ml−1 ETM solution using a mixed solvent of 1,2-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume). The resulting photoactive layers were dried in a vacuum for 1 h. The thickness of photoactive layer was typically 85 nm. Then, a 5 nm MoO3 thin film and a 50 nm Ag thin film were sequentially evaporated through a shadow mask in high vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to define the active area of the solar cell and form the top anode, respectively. For reference, an inverted PSC with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag was fabricated. The ZnO thin film was spin-coated onto the ITO cathode from a mixed zinc acetate dihydrate and ethanolamine solution containing 2-methoxyethanol at a speed of 4000 rpm, and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The resulting thickness of the ZnO layer was 40 nm. For a regular PSC with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen/Ca/Al, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at a speed of 4000 rpm and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then, the photoactive layer was fabricated on the 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS as described above. Finally, a 20 nm calcium layer followed by a 100 nm aluminum layer was evaporated onto the blend film under high vacuum as the cathode. The active area of all the devices was 4 mm2.

The photovoltaic parameters of devices were obtained from the J–V curve measurements using a programmable Agilent B2912A SourceMeter under a 1 sun of AM 1.5G spectra from an XES-70S1 solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd).

The UV-Vis absorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples were carried out using a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer and a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray reflector, respectively. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of the blend films were performed on a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 in the tapping mode. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the samples were carried out on an imaging photoelectron spectrometer (Axis Ultra). Typically, the hydrocarbon C 1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon was used for energy reference. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Specs PHOIBOS 150) was used for the work function measurements. The film thicknesses were measured using a Bruker DektakXT stylus profiling system. The surface energy of Bphen was measured using a drop shape analyzer (DSA 30, KRÜSS).

Hole-only or electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures:ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Au for holes and Al/photoactive layer/Al for electrons. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density vs. voltage curves using the Mott-Gurney relationship (space charge limited current, SCLC).

For the inverted devices with structure ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen/MoO3/Ag, the photocurrent density versus voltage curves are shown in Fig. 2, and the photovoltaic data are listed in Table 1. The inverted device based on PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen (0.10 mg ml−1) shows substantial increases in VOC and fill factor (FF), despite slightly smaller JSC relative to that based on PTB7:PC71BM, and yields a PCE of 5.35%, higher than that of the device based on PTB7:PC71BM (3.43%). The obvious S shape for the inverted device with x = 0 is due to the severe charge recombination at the cathode interface. Relative to that of the PTB7:PC71BM-based device, the EQE of the PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen (0.10 mg ml−1)-based device is slightly smaller in the range from 300 to 480 nm and almost the same in the range from 480 to 900 nm (Fig. 3). Compared with the reference inverted device, ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, with a PCE of 6.46%, the inverted device, ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen (0.10 mg ml−1)/MoO3/Ag, with a simplified structure exhibits a loss of 0.17 times in the PCE.

The addition of a small amount of small molecules could enhance crystalline aggregation of the P3HT phase and lead to increase in the PCE of P3HT:PC61BM blend solar cells. However, addition of Bphen does not enhance crystallinity of the PTB7:PC71BM blend because the XRD pattern of the blend does not change after addition of Bphen (Fig. S1, ESI). Some third components can enhance absorption of the active layer and photovoltaic performance. However, the absorption spectrum of the PTB7:PC71BM blend does not exhibit an obvious change after addition of Bphen (Fig. S2, ESI). It was reported that a proper additive might act as an electronic stair to facilitate the energy transfer from donor to acceptor. Nevertheless, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of Bphen (−2.80 eV) does not lie between those of PTB7 and PC71BM (−3.31 and −3.70 eV, respectively), implying that Bphen does not form an energy-relay structure with the PTB7 and PC71BM.

To determine the distribution of Bphen in the PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen blend, the air and bottom surfaces of the blend were examined via XPS. No nitrogen is detected at the air surface of the ternary blend (Fig. 4), indicating that Bphen does not migrate towards the top surface of the ternary blend. An appreciable N element signal is observed for the bottom area of the ternary blend, suggesting that Bphen may accumulate towards the cathode interface during spin coating. The PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen ternary blend exhibits a very low PCE of 0.35% in a regular device (Fig. S3, ESI), mostly because the hole extraction from the active layer to PEDOT:PSS is interrupted due to the formation of a thin interlayer of Bphen between the active layer and PEDOT:PSS. From AFM images (Fig. S4, ESI), the PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen blend film on ITO substrate exhibits a root mean square roughness of 1.75 nm, whereas the PTB7:PC71BM blend film on ITO substrate exhibits a root mean square roughness of 3.05 nm, resulting from the fact that the PTB7:PC71BM blend is more wettable to organic matter (Bphen) than to inorganic matter (ITO).
From the XPS, PSC and AFM data discussed above, Bphen spontaneously accumulates onto the ITO surface prior to the PTB7 and PC71BM during spin coating, as illustrated in Fig. 5, thereby forming a thin buffer layer between the photoactive layer and the cathode.
The cathode buffer layer plays a dual role in inverted PSCs. On the one hand, it can separate the photoactive layer from the cathode, which reduces the charge recombination and blocks exciton diffusion in the zone near the cathode. The thin layer of Bphen is able to block the exciton diffusion towards the ITO cathode due to its wide bandgap (3.6 eV), which is responsible for increase in the FF of ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen-based devices. On the other hand, the cathode buffer layer can reduce the work function of the cathode and improve the VOC. The work function of ITO with and without modification by Bphen was measured via UPS. As shown in Fig. 6, the work function of ITO decreases from 4.19 to 3.70 eV upon the deposition of Bphen, similar to modification of ITO by PFN and PEIE, accounting for improvement in the VOC of ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen-based devices. However, the work function of ITO increases to 4.30 eV upon modification by PC71BM, indicating that the PC71BM cannot act as a cathode buffer layer.
The hole and electron mobilities for PTB7:PC71BM blend are 4.23 × 10−4 and 5.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, higher than those of the PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen (0.10 mg ml−1) blend (2.11 × 10−5 and 6.99 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) measured by SCLC (Fig. S5, ESI). Therefore, the residual Bphen in the ternary blend blocks the charge transport, which is responsible for the reduced performance of the inverted device ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen/MoO3/Ag, compared with the reference inverted device ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. If Bphen concentration is too low, the cathode cannot be effectively modified by Bphen, causing a slight S-shape for the J–V curve at x = 0.05 mg ml−1; if Bphen concentration is too high, the residual Bphen in the ternary blend severely blocks the charge transport, leading to a decrease in the device performance (Fig. 2).

TPBI and BCP are also examined as additives mixed into the PTB7:PC71BM blend. Fig. 7 shows the J–V characteristics under the illumination for the inverted devices ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:ETM/MoO3/Ag, where ETM = TPBI or BCP. The PCEs for inverted devices based on PTB7:PC71BM:TPBI and PTB7:PC71BM:BCP blends are 3.91% and 5.11% (Table 2), respectively, much higher than that for the inverted device based on PTB7:PC71BM blend (3.43%). Like Bphen, TPBI and BCP can spontaneously form a thin buffer layer between the photoactive layer and the cathode.

Pyridine-type N atoms are characteristic of Bphen, TPBI and BCP. The aggregation of these ETMs towards the ITO surface is energetically favorable because, (1) the pyridine-type N atom can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface and (2) there is no hydrophobic long alkyl chain to dewet the hydrophilic ITO, both reducing the interfacial energy of the system. The surface energy of Bphen is higher than that of PTB7 and PC71BM (Table 3). It is therefore concluded that Bphen tends to accumulate onto the ITO substrate more than PTB7 and PC71BM, further justifying our schematic in Fig. 5.

The electron transporting materials (ETM) widely used in organic light-emitting diodes, such as Bphen, BCP and TPBI, are used as a third component to fabricate inverted ternary blend PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM. The ETM additives are able to spontaneously accumulate on the ITO surface prior to the PTB7 and PC71BM during spin coating, because the pyridine-type N atoms in the ETMs can form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface and reduce the interfacial energy. The ETMs serve as a buffer layer between the photoactive layer and the cathode. The cathode buffer layer can separate the photoactive layer from the cathode, and thereby reduce charge recombination and block exciton diffusion in the zone near the cathode, and can also reduce the work function of the cathode and improve the VOC. The inverted device ITO/PTB7:PC71BM:Bphen (0.10 mg ml−1)/MoO3/Ag exhibits a PCE of 5.35%, much higher than that of the inverted device ITO/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag (3.43%). This strategy simplifies the structure of inverted PSCs without significant loss in the PCE. These results could extend the design concepts of both inverted PSCs and ternary blend PSCs.
