The regeneration reaction of sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells is one of the critical steps in photonic chemical circuits. In this report, the two-step regeneration reaction of a series of zinc porphyrin sensitizers with a variety of substituent groups, i.e., CN–, F–, Cl–, H–, PhCH3–, OH– and NH2– groups, has been studied using density functional theory (DFT). The effects of the substituent groups on the structures of zinc porphyrin sensitizers, the regeneration intermediates and the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics have been explored. It is found that substituent groups at meso-position of zinc porphyrins strongly influenced the mode of two-step regeneration. For Por-CN, Por-F and Por-Cl, the formation of DyeIZn and DyeIZn-I intermediates are dominant, whereas for Por-H, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH, the formation of DyeIPy and DyeIPy-I intermediates predominate. Due to the stronger electron-withdrawing effect of CN– and F–, the corresponding Por-CN and Por-F have no energy barrier in reaction. This suggests that their regeneration should be faster than the others. Besides two-step regeneration, alternative regenerations including one-step regeneration and reductive quenching reaction of excited dye and the influences of substituent groups on the electron injection efficiency are also estimated. These results provide valuable information for the design of novel zinc porphyrin analogues for DSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have received significant attention due to their flexibility, semi-transparent properties and low cost in manufacture. A series of DSCs has been developed over the past decades since Grätzel and O'Regan reported DSCs based on nanocrystalline metal oxide electrodes which had high power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.9%. Usually, the DSCs consist of four components including mesoporous semiconductor electrodes, photosensitizer dyes, redox couples dissolved in organic solvents, and counter electrodes, where the photosensitizer dye is the critical component. In the past, ruthenium complexes were employed as sensitizer because they exhibit a broad light absorption, a long excited-state lifetime and good stability. It is found that using ruthenium-complex sensitizer dyes and an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte, the conversion efficiency (η) of DSCs can exceed 10%. The disadvantage is that ruthenium, as a rare metal, is expensive and not readily available. In addition, ruthenium complexes exhibit limited absorption in the near-infrared region of solar spectrum. Inspired by the light-harvesting process in photosynthesis, porphyrin derivatives such as chlorophylls, have been used as sensitizers in DSCs. Especially, porphyrin derivatives as sensitizers are less expensive and exhibit a strong absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum.

Several representative porphyrin derivative sensitizers with high energy conversion efficiencies have been reported. Bessho et al. achieved an incident monochromatic photon-to-electric current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 85% and a power conversion efficiency of 11% using a synthesized D–π–A porphyrin dye (YD-2). Yella et al. reported a D–π–A zinc porphyrin (YD2-ο-C8) sensitized solar cell composed of a cobalt(II/III)-based redox electrolyte. Its power conversion efficiency of sunlight into electrical energy was 12%. When cosensitized with a cyclopentadithiophene-bridged donor–acceptor dye (Y123), the highest power conversion efficiency reported to date, of 12.3% was achieved. In addition to experimental research, theoretical works employing computational quantum chemistry have been widely performed to design porphyrin analogues. Promising sensitizer candidates have been selected based on the estimations of the HOMO–LUMO gaps and red-shifts in their absorption spectra.
In a photochemical circuit of DSCs, the sensitizer first absorbs light and is raised to the excited state; then, the excited sensitizer injects the electron into conduction band; finally, the redox couple (I−/I3−) reduces the light-induced oxidized state sensitizer to its ground state. Obviously, the regeneration reaction of the sensitizer is a critical step to realize the whole energy-conversion cycle. In addition, the regeneration efficiency has an influence on the power conversion efficiency (η). The power conversion efficiency (η) achieved in a photochemical circuit is related to the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the fill factor (ff) and the power input (Pin) (η = VocJscff/Pin). Here, Jsc is proportional to the incident photon flux (I0), the light-harvesting efficiencies (ΦLH), the quantum efficiency of charge separation (ΦCS) and the collection efficiency (ΦCOL) (i.e., Jsc = I0ΦLHΦCSΦCOL). Among them, the quantum efficiency ΦCS depends on two kinetic competitions. One competition occurs between the processes of electron injection into a metal oxide (such as TiO2) and the deactivation of the excited dye. The other competition occurs between the regeneration and recombination of oxidized dye molecules with iodide ions and electrons. So, a thorough understanding of the regeneration process is necessary for the design of novel dye sensitizers. However, only a few works concerning the regeneration of dye sensitizers have been reported. Durrant et al. reported from experiments that the regeneration for Zn-tetra-p-carboxyphenyl-porphyrin (ZnTCPP) and Ru(4,4′-dicarboxy-2′2-bipyridyl)2(NCS)2 (N3) was a first-order reaction with iodide concentration. They found that the regeneration kinetics in two systems (ZnTCPP and N3) were indistinguishable. Furthermore, the work of Clifford et al. showed that the regeneration of the photogenerated dye cation of the Ru compound was a two-step reaction. Meanwhile, alternative regenerations such as one-step reaction and reductive quenching of excited dye by iodide were also reported.
To our knowledge, the regeneration of zinc porphyrin sensitizers has been little reported till now. The effect of donor–acceptor substituent groups on the regeneration kinetics is an important factor in the selection and design of novel porphyrin sensitizer candidates. Compared with the experimental method, the computational quantum chemistry can provide more valuable information. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the regeneration reaction for zinc porphyrin systems. The electronic properties, the thermodynamics and kinetics of a series of Zn-tetraphenylporphines with different electron-withdrawing or -donating substituent groups at the meso-position for two-step regeneration are studied firstly. Furthermore, another two alternative regenerations such as one-step regeneration and the reductive quenching reaction of excited dye are estimated. The influences of substituent groups on the electron injection efficiency are also discussed. This is helpful in advancing the understanding of the regeneration process and the effects of substituent groups on the regeneration of zinc porphyrin sensitizers.

In two-step regeneration process, the first step is a charge-transfer reaction between the Dye+ and I− that results in a transient intermediate [Dye+I−]. Then, [Dye+I−] reacts with another I− and transforms into dye and I2− through the [DyeI2−] intermediate. Finally, the I2− is converted into I3− and I−. The whole regeneration is presented as follows:

Dye+ + I− → [Dye+I−]
(1)
[Dye+I−] + I− → [DyeI2−]
(2)
[DyeI2−] → Dye + I2−
(3)
In the one-step regeneration process,
 the reaction proceeds through the intermediate of an I atom in following pathway:

Dye+ + I− → Dye + I
(4)
I˙ + I− → I2−
(5)
Besides two-step and one-step regenerations, another possible reaction is the reductive quenching of excited dye by iodide under certain conditions:


Dye* + I− → Dye− + I˙
(6)
I˙ + I− → I2−
(7)
In the present work, a series of zinc porphyrin sensitizers with varying substituent groups, i.e., CN–, F–, Cl–, H–, PhCH3–, OH– and NH2– groups are considered in regeneration. The zinc porphyrin derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. In these zinc porphyrins, the malonic acid as acceptor moiety is unchanged. Seven types of electron-withdrawing and -donating substituent groups are chosen at the meso-position (among them, the zinc porphyrin with X = −PhCH3 has been synthesized experimentally).
The geometry optimizations, electronic structures, thermodynamics and transition states of [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates for zinc porphyrin analogues in two-step regeneration were calculated using DFT method at B3LYP level. The CAM-B3LYP functional with the long-range correction was used to calculate the charge density difference and the energy of excited states. The 6-31++G(d,p) basis set was used for C, H, O, N, Cl and F and the Lanl2dz basis set for Zn and I atoms. The influences of DFT methods such as MPW1 K, BP86, BLYP, B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP on the structural parameters of the Por-PhCH3 sensitizer and its [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates were compared (see Tables S1–S3 in the ESI).
Here, the optimized geometries were obtained at the minimal state of the potential energy surface and were further confirmed by the observation of no imaginary frequencies. Because the structure of the [Dye+I−] intermediate is unknown, the possible binding sites are at the positions with: (1) the interaction of I− with the d-orbital of Zn(II); (2) the interaction of I− and pyrrole ring via a π electron cloud; (3) the I–H (carboxyl) interaction. The final optimized structures of the [Dye+I−] intermediates were determined after many attempts starting with all possible interaction conformations. Finally, the two states with the interaction sites at Zn(II) and pyrrole ring with lower energies are regarded as the structures of [Dye+I−] intermediate. The structures of these two kinds of intermediates (i.e., DyeIZn and DyeIPy the “Py” represents the pyrrole of porphyrin) are shown in Fig. 2.
The transition-state structures for two-step regeneration were located by using the STQN method (combining Synchronous Transit and Quasi-Newton Methods) and examined by single imaginary frequency and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation. Since the potential energy surface of the transition state was very flat, the method of scanning the relaxed potential energy surface (PES) along the I–I distance coordinate is used. The reaction energy ΔE in two-step regeneration was calculated with following equations.
ΔE[Dye+I−] = E([Dye+I−]) − [E([Dye+) + E(I−)]
(8)
ΔE[DyeI2−] = E([DyeI2−]) − [E([Dye+I−) + E(I−)]
(9)
The electronic energy E with zero-point correction includes the zero-point vibrational, rotational and translational energy. The free energy ΔG of the regeneration was calculated in the same way. All calculations were implemented with the Gaussian 09 software package. The effects of the electron-withdrawing and -donating substituent groups with respect to the structural features of the regeneration intermediates were analysed. Firstly, the two-step regeneration was analysed. Then, the one-step regeneration and the reductive quenching reaction of the excited dye were estimated. Finally, the influences of substituent groups on the electron injection efficiency were discussed.

We began with the optimization of the zinc porphyrin derivatives and their oxidized states (Dye+), and calculated the two-step regeneration in detail. In the two-step regeneration mechanism, I− anion was added to form [Dye+I−] intermediates under energy optimization. Then, the second I− anion was added to form [DyeI2−] intermediate (i.e., DyeIZn-I and DyeIPy-I). The electronic structures, the charge density difference (Δρ) of the [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates, the reaction energy and the transition states were analysed in sections 3.1–3.4. Another two possible regeneration pathways are discussed in section 3.5.

A representative conformation of the DyeIZn intermediate for the F-substituted porphyrin is shown in Fig. 2 left (the corresponding structures of the other porphyrins can be found in the ESI, see Fig. S1). After combining with the first I− anion, the Zn atom is displaced approximately 0.5 Å from the N4 plane. Due to the interaction of Zn and iodide, the planar structure of the porphine is slightly distorted and the rings of the porphyrin with Zn are slightly disrupted. The extent of distortion depends on the substituent group. For the DyeIZn intermediate, zinc porphyrins substituted with electron-donating groups exhibit a bigger distortion than those substituted with electron-withdrawing groups due to the repulsion of I− anion with the porphine. The distances between Zn and I are approximately 2.75 Å (see Table 1).

The second I− anion combines with the DyeIZn intermediate to form the DyeIZn-I intermediate. Fig. 3 shows the DyeIZn-I intermediates substituted with –CN and –F groups (DyeIZn-I intermediates for other zinc porphyrins are provided in Fig. S2 in ESI). The position of the second I atom depends on the substituent groups of porphyrin derivatives. For Por-CN, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH, the second I atom is located on the top right corner of the first I atom. For Por-F, Por-Cl, Por-H and Por-NH2, however, the second I atom is on the top left corner. The bond length of DyeIZn increases from 2.889 to 3.131 Å due to the increased effect of electron-donating substituents from –CN to –NH2. The bond lengths of the Zn–I and I–I in DyeIZn-I intermediates are shown in Table 1. It is found that the I–I bond length in DyeIZn-I is about 3.4 Å, close to the bond length of the I2− anion radical (3.457 Å).
The structures of the DyeIPy and DyeIPy-I intermediates for Por-F (i, ii) and Por-NH2 (iii, iv) are shown in Fig. 4. For the DyeIPy intermediates, the I atom is on the side of the top of the pyrrole with malonic acid. Because the malonic acid is an electron-withdrawing group, it leads to a stronger attraction between I− anion and pyrrole. The distances between I− anion and pyrrole are shown in Table 1. The distance between the I atom and the N4 plane equals about 2.7 Å for the Por-CN, Por-F, Por-Cl, Por-H and Por-PhCH3 analogues, and 1.3 and 0.9 Å for Por-OH and Por-NH2, respectively. The electron-donating effect increases the repulsion between pyrrole ring and I− anion. Consequently, the I atom deviates from the top position of pyrrole ring. So, when the substituent group is a withdrawing group (e.g., –F), the I atom is located at the top of the pyrrole (see Fig. 4). When the substituent group is an electron-donating group (e.g., –NH2), the I atom is located at the side of the pyrrole. The deviation extent increases with the electron-donating effect of the substituent group increasing. The corresponding DyeIPy intermediates of other zinc porphyrins are presented in Fig. S3 in the ESI.
The structures of DyeIPy-I intermediates for Por-F (ii) and Por-NH2 (iv) are shown in Fig. 4. The structures of DyeIPy-I of other porphyrin analogues are listed in Fig. S4 in the ESI. It is shown that the two I atoms are located at the two sides of the pyrrole substituted with malonic acid. The I–I bond length is about 3.4 Å for Por-F, Por-Cl, Por-H, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH porphyrin analogues (see Table 1). It is also close to that of the I2− anion (3.457 Å). However, the I–I bond length in Por-NH2 is 6.192 Å, which is much longer than the bond length of the I2− anion. This indicates that the Por-NH2 can not be regenerated at the DyeIPy interaction site by the second I− anion. Our calculations also show that various substituent groups weakly influence the structures of the [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates. Except for Por-NH2, all porphyrin analogues tend to generate the liberation of I2− in the second step of the regeneration.

The regeneration process is a charge-transfer reaction. To further understand the electron transfer in the reaction, the charge density difference (Δρ) between intermediates for porphyrin analogues was calculated using the CAM-B3LYP method. Fig. 5 shows the charge density difference (Δρ) of [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates for Por-F and Por-NH2. The blue section represents a loss of charge density, and the purple section represents the addition of charge density. In the first I− anion combination reaction, the charge transfers from the 5pz orbital of I− to the zinc porphyrin and the partial π-electron density on the porphine moves to pyrroles. As a result, the charge on the porphyrin part increases and the charge on the I− anion decreases. The NBO charge values of the I atom in DyeIZn intermediates range from −0.551 to −0.610 because the electron-donating effect of the substituent groups increases in the zinc porphyrins (Table 2). When the second I− anion combines with the DyeIZn intermediate, the charge transfers from the 5px and 5py orbitals of the second I− anion to the first I− anion and the zinc porphyrin. The charge values of the first I atom in the DyeIZn-I intermediates are approximately −0.38, and the charge values of the second I atom range from −0.315 to −0.417 as the electron-donating effect increases from Por-CN to Por-NH2. The charge density difference (Δρ) of the DyeIZn and DyeIZn-I intermediates shows the direction of charge transfer. The charge transfers from I− anions to zinc porphyrins to reduce the oxidation state of the zinc porphyrin sensitizers, and after the second step of the regeneration, the DyeIZn-I intermediates tend to form I2− radical anions.

The charge density difference (Δρ) of the DyeIPy and DyeIPy-I intermediates for the seven porphyrin analogues is shown in Fig. 5. For the DyeIPy intermediates, the charge of the I− anion decreases, whereas that of the zinc porphyrin part increases. The NBO charge value for the first I atom changes from −0.123 to −0.187 as the electron-donating effects increase from Por-CN to Por-PhCH3. For the Por-OH and Por-NH2 analogues, the charge values are −0.794 and −0.843, respectively, due to the strong electron-donating effects of Por-OH and Por-NH2. When the second I− anion is introduced, the DyeIPy-I intermediate is formed. The charge transfers from the second I− anion to the zinc porphyrin part. As a result, the NBO charge value of the first I atom decreases to about −0.48 for the first six porphyrin analogues, and the value of the second I atom is from −0.417 to −0.500. The NBO charge values of the two I atoms in the DyeIPy-I intermediates are approximately equal and tend to form an I2− radical anion. However, for Por-NH2, the charge values of the two I atoms are −0.872 and −0.886 and the formation of an I2− radical anion is impossible. The results indicate that the regeneration process for the NH2-substituted zinc porphyrin cannot proceed via pyrrole interaction.

The regeneration energies (ΔE) of the zinc porphyrin analogues in two-step regeneration are shown in Table 3. It is found that all ΔEs are negative. This indicates that the two-step regeneration of zinc porphyrin is an exothermic reaction because of the strong combination of I− with Dye+. The reaction energy ΔE of the formation of [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates increases as the electron-donating effect increases from Por-CN to Por-NH2. The stronger electron-withdrawing effect makes the reaction proceed more easily and the corresponding intermediate is more stable. Meanwhile, it is found that the formation of DyeIZn intermediates is dominant in the first step of the reaction owing to ΔEi < ΔEiv (see Table 3). The total regeneration energy of reaction (iii) for the substituent groups (–CN, –F and –Cl) is lower than that of reaction (vi) (ΔEiii < ΔEvi). However, in the case of Por-H, Por-OH and Por-NH2, the result is reverse and the total regeneration energy of reaction (iii) is higher than that of reaction (vi) (ΔEiii > ΔEvi). The reaction energy of the DyeIPy-I intermediate is almost the same as that of the DyeIZn-I intermediate for Por-PhCH3 zinc porphyrin.

The free energy (ΔG) of two-step regeneration reaction is further calculated (see Table 4). It is found that the regeneration free energy (ΔG) tends to decrease gradually as the electron-donating effect of the substituent group increases; this tendency is consistent with that of the regeneration energy (ΔE). For Por-CN, Por-F, Por-Cl, Por-H, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH, the free energy (ΔG) of the formation of the [Dye+I−] and [DyeI2−] intermediates is < 0. This indicates that the corresponding regeneration can proceed spontaneously. The ΔG of the formation of DyeIZn-I is 10.38 kJ mol−1 for NH2-substituted zinc porphyrin and indicates that this DyeIZn-I intermediate cannot be formed spontaneously. Although the ΔG of the formation of the DyeIPy-I intermediate is −66.45 kJ mol−1, the I2− radical anion cannot form according to previous discussion about its structure.

The result above indicates that different substituent groups at meso-position of zinc porphyrins present two kinds of reaction modes in two-step regeneration. The interaction between the Zn atom and I− anion for Por-CN, Por-F, Por-Cl and Por-PhCH3 are thermodynamically favorable, and the reaction for Por-H and Por-OH with electron-donating groups is in favor of the mode of pyrrole interaction. A different case is that the regeneration of Por-PhCH3 should proceed through the formation of DyeIZn intermediate because the energy of reaction (iii) is lower than reaction (vi). The reason is the serious steric effect of benzene group which makes the regeneration proceed through the reaction (iii) favorably. In general, zinc porphyrins substituted with electron-withdrawing groups tend to form DyeIZn-I intermediates and the dye regeneration of zinc porphyrins substituted with electron-donating groups proceeds through the DyeIPy-I intermediates.

In this section, the transition states in two-step generation are further calculated and the corresponding kinetics is discussed. Notably, the transition states for the formation of [Dye+I−] intermediates (the first step of the regeneration) are not found. The transition states of the formation of DyeIZn-I intermediates (the second step of the regeneration) for H-, PhCH3- and OH-substituted porphyrins are found. The energy barriers are listed in Table 5 (the energy of reactant is set to zero). The energy barriers of the formation of DyeIZn-I intermediates for Por-H, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH decrease from 19.35 to 2.93 kJ mol−1 as the electron-donating effect strengthens. The transition states of the formation of DyeIZn-I intermediates for CN-, F- and Cl-substituted porphyrins are not found. For the formation of DyeIPy-I intermediates, only the Cl-substituted porphyrin has a transition state and the energy barrier is 11.22 kJ mol−1 for Por-Cl. So, the formation of DyeIPy-I intermediates for Por-H, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH is always more favorable than the formation of DyeIZn-I intermediates both from thermodynamics and kinetics perspectives.

Table 6 shows the key structure parameters of the transition states. When the second I− anion is added to the DyeIZn intermediate, the Zn–I bond distance of the corresponding transition state is longer than that in the DyeIZn intermediate and shorter than that in the DyeIZn-I intermediate. In this process, the interaction between the first I atom and Zn atom is reduced and the bond distance of Zn–I increases. The bond distance of I–I for the transition state is longer than that in the DyeIZn-I intermediate. For the transition state of the Por-Cl, the bond distance of I–I is also longer than that in the DyeIPy-I intermediate. The detailed structures of transition states are shown in Fig. S6 in ESI.

In the work of Clifford et al., they found that the formation of the [Dye+I−] intermediate in the system of Ru complex sensitizers avoided the energy barrier and the second step regeneration in that system was the rate determining step. In our work, the transition states are also not found in the first step of reaction and only obtained in the second step of reaction in the system of zinc porphyrins. This indicates that the regeneration kinetics in Ru complex sensitizers and zinc porphyrins may be similar. Due to the strong effect of electron-withdrawing in the porphyrins, the transition state of CN- and F-substituted porphyrin analogues are not found in two-step regeneration. It is reasonable that the regeneration rates for them should be fast.

Two possible alternative pathways are also estimated in present work. The regeneration energy ΔE and free energy ΔG of one-step regeneration reaction (4) and excited reductive quenching reaction (6) are calculated under CAM-B3LYP level (see Table 7). The reaction energy of excited reductive quenching for Por-PhCH3 is not achieved because of too long computation time for the excited state of Por-PhCH3. It is shown that the reaction energy ΔE of one-step regeneration reaction (4) is much higher than that of the two-step regeneration reaction (1), (2). This indicates that the two-step regeneration mechanism is dominant in DSCs. For the reaction (6) of excited dyes and iodide, the regeneration of zinc porphyrins (Por-F, Por-Cl, Por-H, Por-OH and Por-NH2) can not happen spontaneously since the free energy ΔG is > 0 and the corresponding regeneration should be an endothermic reaction. The zinc porphyrin substituted with the strong electron-withdrawing group (–CN) has negative ΔE and ΔG for the reaction (6). From the trend of these calculation results, the reaction energy for Por-PhCH3 is expected to be in the middle of the values of Por-H and Por-OH. Our results indicate that two-step regeneration is dominant in the DSCs. The possibility of the reductive quenching reaction increases with the electron-withdrawing effect of substituent group increasing. The best system should be Por-CN.

It is noted that the substituent group not only influences the regeneration reaction but also possibly changes other processes such as the electron injection in the DSCs. The free energy of electron injection for zinc porphyrins has been calculated here and it decreases from −0.015 eV for Por-CN to −2.576 eV for Por-NH2. The detailed information of calculation method and results can be found in ESI (Table S4). It is found that zinc porphyrins substituted with electron-donating groups has more exoenergic free energy and can obtain a higher electron injection driving force. However, this is opposite with the contribution to the regeneration reaction. It is implied that a balanced consideration to the regeneration and electron injection is needed.

In this work, we applied the DFT method to investigate the regeneration processes of zinc porphyrin sensitizers with the substituent groups, i.e., CN–, F–, Cl–, H–, PhCH3–, OH– and NH2– groups at meso-position. The calculation results show that the two-step regeneration mechanism is dominant compared with the one-step regeneration and excited reductive quenching reaction. With the electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent group increasing, the possibility of the reductive quenching reaction increases. The result further shows that the two-step regeneration is a charge-transfer process; four intermediates (DyeIZn, DyeIZn-I, DyeIPy and DyeIPy-I) present regular change in their electronic structures, charge density difference, NBO charge values and regeneration energy properties when the electronic effect of the substituent group changes from electron-withdrawing to electron-donating. The reaction energies and transition states also demonstrate that the combination of I− anions with Zn atoms to form DyeIZn and DyeIZn-I intermediates is dominant for Por-CN, Por-F and Por-Cl. The regeneration for Por-CN and Por-F has no activation energy and the regeneration is fast. This indicates that the regeneration efficiency may be improved if the effect of electron-withdrawing is strong. For Por-H, Por-PhCH3 and Por-OH, the combination of I− anions with the pyrrole of porphine to form DyeIPy and DyeIPy-I intermediates is more favorable. The regeneration of the NH2-substituted porphyrin is difficult because the free reaction energy is positive. Meanwhile, the influences of substituent groups on the electron injection efficiency are also estimated. The electron-donating substituent group is in favour of highly efficient electron injection. Our calculation results provide valuable information to design novel zinc porphyrin analogues in DSCs.
