This work reports a promising hole transporting material using a spiro-thiophene derivative with 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] as the spiro core for perovskite solar cells, exhibiting an overall power conversion efficiency of 10.4% with an open circuit voltage of 0.94 V, and a short circuit current density of 16.54 mA cm−2 under standard testing conditions.

Perovskite solar cells are drawing great attention due to their advantages of low cost and high efficiency. These solution processable solar cells are promising for large scale thin film photovoltaic technology application. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this type of solar cell has been rapidly increased from 3.8% to 20.1% over the past few years. In most of the highly efficient perovskite solar cell devices, organic hole conductors are commonly used for hole transport purposes. To date, the amorphous organic (2,2-7.7-tetrakis(N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenyl-amine 9,9′-spirobifluorene)) (spiro-MeOTAD) has been the most popular hole transport material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells due to its good solubility, weak absorption within the scope of visible light, good film-forming properties, and high hole mobility. Spiro-MeOTAD was introduced into solid-state sensitized mesoporous heterojunction solar cells. Though the charge transfer from the sensitizers to spiro-MeOTAD in the heterojunction is very efficient, the overall PCE of these devices is relatively low due to a fast charge recombination at the dye-sensitized TiO2/spiro-MeOTAD interface as discovered latterly. Since the first report on the lead iodide perovskite sensitized all-solid-state thin film mesoscopic solar cell using spiro-MeOTAD as a hole conductor, the PCE of this type of device has already exceeded 15% by finely tuning interfacial energy levels and controlling thin film morphologies. Spiro-MeOTAD as an expensive organic hole conducting material has the disadvantages of poor crystallinity, and possible degradation under environmental influences. Furthermore, a strong accumulation of charge has been found to take place in the perovskite layer upon exposure to light by mapping the contact potential difference between the tip and the sample within Kelvin probe force microscopy measurement. A comparison of the electrical potential distribution before and after illumination of the device revealed a persistent positive charging in the mesoporous TiO2 layer and negative charging inside the perovskite capping layer. The positive charging, which could be due to the fact that the TiO2 electron conductor works much more effectively than spiro-MeOTAD, may change the electric field in the heterojunction and slow down the charge transport. Therefore, several alternatives have been proposed to spiro-MeOTAD, aiming for the enhancement of hole conductivity and durability. For example, the use of a polymeric hole conductor, especially polytriarylamine, substantially improves the open-circuit voltage VOC and fill factor of the cells, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 12.0% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. Recently, various organic HTMs have been reported in efficient perovskite solar cells, such as tetrathiafulvalene derivatives, pyrene-core arylamine derivatives, quinolizino acridine compounds, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, carbazole derivatives, and polyfluorene derivatives, showing PCEs in the range of 11–14%. These hole conductors have great potential to replace the expensive spiro-MeOTAD because of their much simpler and cheaper synthesis, which promotes the advancement of cost-effective and practical perovskite solar cells.

The concept of spiro is used to improve the morphological stability of low molar mass materials and retain their electronic properties as well by connecting two more or less extended π-systems via a common sp3-hybridized atom. As a promising class of materials for organic optoelectronics, spiro compounds offer several benefits. For instance, the perpendicular arrangement of the two moieties leads to a rigid structure, efficiently suppressing molecular interactions between the π-systems which can reduce the tendency to form aggregates. Hence, the introduction of the spiro structure raises the resulting compounds' glass temperature (Tg) and improves their morphological stability in the solid state. For example, the glass transition temperature of spiro-OMeTPA is reported to be 125 °C, being higher than that of the counterpart compound N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)4,4′-diamine (TPD) (Tg = 62 °C). Crystallization of the hole conductor layer is undesirable for it would impair the formation of a good contact among the active layer and back contact electrodes. Furthermore, the spiro compounds have been found to be highly soluble in commonly used solvents compared to the corresponding non-spiro-linked parent compounds. Spiro-type compounds based on the 9,9′-spirobifluorene core have been intensively studied in recent years. Several compounds based on this core have been successfully synthesized and applied in organic solar cells, organic light-emitting devices, field-effect transistors and lasers. In order to expand the spiro family, the thiophene-based spiro core, 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] (SCPDT), has been developed by Salbeck and co-workers as a new heterocyclic building block. It has been observed that the optical, electrochemical and electrical properties of the derivatives using the SCPDT spiro-core are very different to those analogues with 9,9′-spirobifluorene. In comparison with 9,9′-spirobifluorene using benzene as the block unit, the SCPDT is ready for the redox reaction due to thiophene having higher electron density and lower aromaticity properties. Therefore, the SCPDT derivatives are very promising as charge transport materials in organic electronic devices. In this work, 5-octyl-2,2′-bithiophene units are combined with the spiro core of SCPDT to form a new compound, which is used as a hole conductor for perovskite solar cell application.

The synthesis details and characterization of the SCPDT-BiT are described in the ESI (Fig. S1 and S2).


For hole mobility testing, a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/SCPDT-BiT/MoO3/Au (60 nm) was fabricated. SCPDT-BiT (20 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and stirred overnight. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was treated with UV–ozone for 25 min, and then a 40 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate from an aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083), followed by baking in an oven at 150 °C for 10 min. The active layer was obtained by spin-coating the SCPDT-BiT solution at 600 rpm for 2 min in a glovebox. The active layer thickness (∼142 nm) was measured with a Dektak profilometer. A bilayer cathode structure of MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (60 nm) was thermally evaporated atop the active layer in a vacuum chamber under a base pressure of about 2 × 10−4 Pa. The device active area was 0.16 cm2, which was defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Au electrodes. For comparison, the devices with spiro-MeOTAD were fabricated under the same conditions.

Solar cell device preparation: fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO2) coated glass (Pilkington TEC 15, 15 Ω per square) was patterned by etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted in milliQ water. The etched substrate was then cleaned with 2% hellmanex diluted in milliQ water, rinsed with milliQ water, and ethanol and dried with clean dry air. The substrate was placed in a UV–O3 chamber for 30 min prior to spray pyrolysis at 500 °C using 40 mL of a titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39, v/v) and oxygen as a carrier gas, and sintered on a hot plate for 1 h at 500 °C. The TiO2 compact layer thickness was ∼30 nm. Porous TiO2 films of 200 nm thickness were deposited onto the compact layer covered substrates by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s using a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NRD, 30 nm average particle size) diluted in anhydrous ethanol (1:3, weight ratio). After drying at 120 °C, the TiO2 layers were heated to 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 films were infiltrated with PbI2 by spin-coating a PbI2 solution in DMF (508 mg mL−1) that was kept at 70 °C. After drying, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 30 s, rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After drying, the CH3NH3PbI3-adsorbed films were covered with a HTM layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox. The HTM recipe was prepared by dissolving 78.3 mg of 2-(5′-hexyl-2′,3′-dihydro-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2′,6,6′-tris(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene], 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine, and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, 65 nm of gold was thermally evaporated in the vacuum chamber on top of the device to form the electrode contacts. The device fabrication was carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions and a humidity of <1.0 ppm.
A solar cell device was fabricated with spiro-MeOTAD for comparison. The HTM recipe was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of lithium salt in 1 mL of chlorobenzene.

A solar simulator with a Xe light source (450 W, Oriel, model 9119) and an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to provide an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 on the surface of the solar cell. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent on a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (USA). A similar data-acquisition system was used to control the IPCE measurements. A white-light bias (10% sunlight intensity) was applied onto the sample during the IPCE measurements with the AC model (10 Hz).

The photovoltage/photocurrent transient decay measurement was carried out to obtain the electron diffusion length (HuaMing, model 201501). A white light bias on the device sample was generated from an array of diodes. Blue light pulse diodes (0.05 s square pulse width, 100 ns rise and fall time) controlled by a fast solid-state switch were used as the perturbation source. The voltage dynamics were recorded on a PC-interfaced Keithley 2602A source meter with a 100 μs response time. The perturbation light source was set to a suitably low level in order for the voltage decay kinetics to be monoexponential. By varying the white light bias intensity, the diffusion length could be estimated over a range of applied biases.

In this study, we report a new material based on the SCPDT core as a HTM for perovskite solar cell application for the first time. 4,4′-Spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene] with four 5-octyl-2,2′-bithiophene as rigid arms (denoted as SCPDT-BiT) can be obtained by a standard Pd-mediated Stille coupling reaction with a yield of 54% (Scheme 1). The molecular structure of SCPDT-BiT is presented in Scheme 1. The resultant SCPDT-BiT exhibits excellent solubility in organic solvents such as chloroform and toluene. The structure and purity of all the intermediates and final compounds were identified by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI). Fig. 1a compares the UV-visible absorption spectroscopy results of SCPDT-BiT and spiro-MeOTAD. In toluene solution, the SCPDT-BiT shows two absorption bands around 322 nm and 467 nm while spiro-MeOTAD shows two absorption bands at 306 nm and 388 nm. Table 1 lists the optoelectronic properties of the SCPDT-BiT and spiro-MeOTAD samples. Compared with the absorption of spiro-MeOTAD taking place in the UV-visible region, the SCPDT-BiT absorbs part of the visible light. This can be ascribed to the electron donating property of the bithiophene group. When directly bonding to the SCPDT core, the 5-octyl-2,2′-bithiophene units can largely increase the electron density of the SCPDT core. Thus, the SCPDT-BiT has a larger conjugated structure compared to spiro-MeOTAD. For the thin film of SCPDT-BiT, the absorption maximum peak is blue shifted to 457 nm with a shoulder peak at 525 nm. Both SCPDT-BiT and spiro-MeOTAD samples in the liquid solvents show a similar absorption to those of solid states, indicating a poor π–π intermolecular interaction in their thin-film states. This can be further proved by XRD characterization. The appearance of a strong peak at 2θ = 18.9° is ascribed to the Si substrate (Fig. 2a). In the XRD pattern, no obvious peak representing the crystallization of SCPDT-BiT is observed.

The cyclic voltammetry measurement was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of SCPDT-BiT within anhydrous dichloromethane containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate as a supporting electrolyte in a three electrode system. Fig. 1b shows that the SCPDT-BiT undergoes two reversible one-electron oxidation processes with-half potentials at +0.37 V and +0.75 V vs. Fc/Fc+. Therefore, the HOMO energy level can be calculated on the basis of the following equation: EHOMO = −4.8 − (Eox − E1/2(Fc/Fc+)), where Eox is the onset oxidation potential (vs. Fc/Fc+). The values of Eox for SCPDT-BiT and E1/2 for Fc/Fc+ are 0.1 and 0.37 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of SCPDT-BiT is estimated to be −5.07 eV, being slightly lower than that of spiro-MeOTAD (−5.04 eV, Table 1). The extension of the conjugation length of SCPDT-BiT brings the HOMO energy level down compared with the SCPDT. The HOMO level of SCPDT-BiT matches well with the valence-band level of CH3NH3PbI3 (∼−5.44 eV), ensuring efficient driving force for hole transport from perovskite into the HTM layer. The absorption onset wavelength for the SCPDT-BiT film is 550 nm, corresponding to an optical energy gap of 2.25 eV. The LUMO energy level is thus calculated to be −2.82 eV.

Fig. 2b presents the results of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement on the SCPDT-BiT. There is no obvious melting point observed from room temperature to 250 °C, suggesting that the SCPDT-BiT is an amorphous structure. The glass transition temperature is evaluated to be 136.9 °C, which is higher than that of spiro-MeOTAD (Tg = 125 °C) (Fig. 2b). This result suggests that SCPDT-BiT can exhibit good thermal stability. A conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/SCPDT-BiT/MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (60 nm) was fabricated for the measurement of the hole mobility of SCPDT-BiT. The SCPDT-BiT without thermal annealing shows a hole mobility of 4.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. This can be improved by an order of magnitude after pre-annealing treatment at 100 °C for 10 min (5.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The spiro-MeOTAD shows a hole mobility of 1.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the same device structure without thermal annealing. After treatment at 100 °C for 10 min, the hole mobility of spiro-MeOTAD increases to 5.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high hole mobility for SCPDT-BiT could be attributed to the high charge-carrier mobility of the thiophene unit.
A perovskite solar cell device was fabricated with the structure of FTO/TiO2 (30 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (300 nm)/SCPDT-BiT (120 nm)/Au (60 nm) with SCPDT-BiT as the hole transporting layer. Fig. 3a presents the photocurrent–voltage curves of the devices tested under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated irradiation. The open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), current density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency of the device using SCPDT-BiT are 0.94 V, 0.67, 16.54 mA cm−2 and 10.39%, respectively. The reference device with spiro-MeOTAD as the hole conducting layer shows a VOC of 0.95 V, a FF of 0.67, and a JSC of 20.83 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 13.3%. The VOC of the SCPDT-BiT device is slightly lower than that of spiro-MeOTAD. The device using SCPDT-BiT shows a lower IPCE response in the range of 500 to 800 nm than that of the device with spiro-MeOTAD (Fig. 3b). This could be caused by fast interfacial charge recombination between the perovskite layer and the SCPDT-BiT layer.
Transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements were performed to extract the photo-generated electron diffusion length for devices with different HTMs. The charge carrier diffusion length L was estimated by the equation of , where D is the charge diffusion constant and τ is the charge carrier lifetime. Fig. 4 displays the calculated charge diffusion length as a function of light irradiation intensity. The diffusion length is estimated to be about 320 nm for the spiro-MeOTAD device, however, the SCPDT-BiT device shows a slightly shorter diffusion length (∼300 nm). The charge collection can be determined by ηcoll = 1/(1 + (d/Ld)2), where d2 is the mean square displacement necessary for an electron to reach the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface from the point where it is photo-generated and Ld is the diffusion length. Therefore, a 15% enhancement in the charge collection can be evaluated for the device using spiro-MeOTAD compared to that of the device with SCPDT-BiT, which may explain a higher photocurrent in the former.

In summary, a new spiro-thiophene derivative 2,2′,6,6′-tetrakis(5′-octyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta [1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene] (SCPDT-BiT) has been synthesized and investigated as a hole conducting layer for perovskite solar cells. The new HTM shows a good PCE of over 10%. The results show that the spiro-thiophene derivatives are very promising candidates as hole transport materials. Further efforts to increase the photocurrent by modifying the chemical structures and fine-tuning the device parameters are in progress.
