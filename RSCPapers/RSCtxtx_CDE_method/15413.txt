The operation stability of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is one of the most important prerequisites for their practical use. In this work, we report a new acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) triad-type small molecule, 5TRh-PCBM, as a compatibilizer for enhancing the thermal stabilities and mechanical properties of efficient PSCs while increasing their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). This multifunctional 5TRh-PCBM molecule, consisting of an oligothiophene segment as the central core and fullerene derivatives as the end groups, is designed to enable strong interactions between the 5TRh-core with various types of efficient polymer donors containing thiophene or fused-thiophene units, while the end fullerene groups preferentially interact with PCBM acceptors. To examine the effectiveness of this molecular compatibilizer, PSCs with different donors (PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, and P3HT) have been fabricated and tested, with addition of various amounts of 5TRh-PCBM. The addition of 5 and 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM significantly enhances the thermal and mechanical stabilities of all tested PSCs. Importantly, unlike typical compatibilizers, the addition of 5TRh-PCBM can increase the PCEs of the PSCs due to its light harvesting capability. In particular, the PCE of PTB7-Th:PCBM-based PSCs is increased from 9.37% to 10.09% with the 5 wt% addition of 5TRh-PCBM. Our comprehensive investigations have revealed the effects of 5TRh-PCBM on the optical, morphological, photovoltaic, and mechanical properties of molecularly engineered PSCs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest as next-generation power generators due to their solution processability, semi-transparency, and flexibility. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs has experienced a significant improvement with single-junction devices showing PCEs of up to ∼17%, thanks to the development of new materials and device engineering. However, before commercialization, the device stabilities of PSCs need to be further improved, as the thermal, photo, and mechanical stabilities are still low for practical applications. The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends of donor and acceptor (D/A) materials exhibit significant morphological instability originating from the strong D/A immiscibility, resulting in the formation of weak D/A junctions that have sharp interfaces with poor adhesion and mechanical robustness. Given the potential use of PSCs in flexible and stretchable electronics, developing mechanically durable PSC devices is essential to realize their practical application. It is known that a cohesive or adhesive fracture energy (Gc) value above 5 J m−2 is required to withstand the mechanical stresses originating from the manufacturing process and manipulation. However, the Gc of the BHJ active layer in most fullerene and non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor-based PSCs is lower than 1–2 J m−2. Therefore, the D/A interfaces in typical BHJ PSCs should be strengthened to afford sufficient morphological stability and the mechanical robustness required for their manufacturing and sustainable operation.

To date, two major approaches have been developed to enhance the morphological and thermal stabilities of PSCs, by introducing either (1) cross-linkable moieties directly to the donor or acceptor structure or (2) compatibilizers into the BHJ active layer. In the crosslinking approach, donor or acceptor materials with photo- or thermally cross-linkable units were designed to freeze the BHJ morphology, resulting in an enhanced morphological stability under the photo- or thermal stress. In addition, cross-linkable molecules can be introduced as additives into the BHJ active layer. However, these cross-linkable units require high energy thermal and/or photo-activation, which typically accompanies a negative influence on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Furthermore, the BHJ active materials would become brittle after cross-linking, resulting in significantly reduced mechanical ductility in the PSCs.
Another effective approach is to develop and utilize compatibilizers, which can reinforce the physical stabilization of the D/A interfaces in the BHJ blends. The sharp interface between two immiscible D/A domains can be broadened and strengthened by the addition of a compatibilizer. Fréchet et al. developed compatibilizers based on amphiphilic diblock copolymers with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative as p- and n-type blocks, which were applied to improve the thermal stability of the P3HT-based PSCs. Palermo et al. reported a gradient sequenced π-conjugated copolymer containing fullerene pendant as a compatibilizer for P3HT/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) PSCs. Various types of compatibilizers, including copolymers, end-capped polymers, small molecules, and in situ compatibilizers, have been developed to enhance the thermal stability of the BHJ blends. However, the preparation of these compatibilizers is not trivial, as it typically involves multiple synthetic steps. Also, most of diblock copolymer-based compatibilizers contain a substantial amount of insulating moieties, which are required for introducing a fullerene derivative in the second block. This could deteriorate the free charge generation and transport in the BHJ active film. Importantly, the use of these compatibilizers has been limited to specific D/A material systems, restricting their universal application in different material systems. Thus, to develop efficient compatibilizers, the following criteria need to be considered. (1) They need to be prepared via simple and reproducible synthetic routes with high yields. (2) They should have donor and acceptor blocks that have attractive interactions with a variety of photovoltaic donor and acceptor moieties to enable their general use in various efficient PSC systems. (3) They should contain a minimal amount of insulating units to avoid/minimize any negative impacts on the device performance. (4) They possess light harvesting ability that can enhance PCEs.
Herein, we report a new multifunctional compatibilizer (5TRh-PCBM) based on an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type structure, which is highly effective for enhancing thermal and mechanical stabilities when applied to various efficient PSCs. This molecular compatibilizer is composed of a penta-thiophene (5T) based D core and fullerene derivative based A terminal units, which can have preferential interactions with various polymer donors containing thiophene and/or fused thiophene units and fullerene-based acceptors. To demonstrate the wide utility of the 5TRh-PCBM compatibilizer, we applied it to various types of PSCs, including traditional P3HT:PC61BM as well as efficient poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-((4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th):phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T):PC71BM based PSCs. The thermal stabilities as well as the mechanical properties of all these PSC systems were greatly enhanced with the addition of 5–20 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM. For instance, the PCE of P3HT:PC61BM PSCs containing 20 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM remained 94% of its initial value after 120 h at 150 °C, as compared to 64% decrease for the P3HT:PC61BM PSC without the presence of 5TRh-PCBM. In addition, the cohesive Gc values of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PBDB-T:PC71BM blends were enhanced by 1.3- and 2.1-fold, respectively, with the addition of 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM. Importantly, unlike most of previously reported compatibilizers that sacrifice some of the initial photovoltaic performance, the addition of 5TRh-PCBM into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend enhanced the PCE from 9.37% to 10.09%, due to its additional light harvesting effect. Comprehensive studies were performed on the effects of the 5TRh-PCBM compatibilizer on the optical, morphological and photovoltaic properties of the PSCs.


Fig. 1a shows the molecular structures of electron donors (P3HT, PTB7-Th, PBDB-T), acceptors (PC61BM and PC71BM), and 5TRh-PCBM compatibilizer utilized in our system. The A–D–A triad-type small molecule, 5TRh-PCBM, which has an oligothiophene-rhodanine-based core with two fullerene derivatives at both termini, was synthesized by following the synthetic procedures presented in Scheme S1. The formyl-functionalized oligothiophene core (1), 3-(6-hydroxyhexyl)rhodanine (2) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PC61BA) were prepared according to previously reported methods. The molecule 5TRh-OH was synthesized in 76% yield via Knoevenagel condensation between compound (1) and (2). The final triad 5TRh-PCBM was synthesized via the Steglich esterification of 5TRh-OH and PC61BA with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-4-dimethylaminopyridine (DCC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), yielding a dark black solid in 41% yield. NMR spectra of 5TRh-PCBM are shown in Fig. S1 and S2. Two fullerene end groups have favorable non-covalent interactions with PC61BM/PC71BM acceptors, and the oligothiophene core also has favorable intermolecular interactions (i.e., van der Waals forces and π–π interactions) with π-conjugated polymer donors in the blend films. In this way, 5TRh-PCBM can be preferentially positioned at the D/A interface to function as a compatibilizer in the BHJ blends. Thermal properties of the 5TRh-PCBM were measured by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as shown in Fig. S3a and b. The TGA results indicate that 5TRh-PCBM exhibits good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) of 390 °C under an N2 atmosphere. The DSC measurement shows no prominent endothermic and exothermic peaks.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the investigated semiconducting materials are presented in Fig. 1b, S4 and S5. Three donor polymers showed a strong light absorption in the visible region, whereas the fullerene-based PC61BM/PC71BM acceptors mainly absorb light in a short wavelength range below 400 nm. Meanwhile, the compatibilizer 5TRh-PCBM exhibited two absorption bands: the peak at 520 nm is ascribed to the light absorption of the 5TRh core, and the other strong absorption below 400 nm can be attributed to the PC61BM end groups. To measure the energy levels of the donor polymers (PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, and P3HT), 5TRh-PCBM, and PC61BM/PC71BM acceptors, we conducted cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in films relative to the internal standard of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple and the resulting cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S6. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of 5TRh-PCBM were determined to be −5.42 eV and −3.92 eV, respectively. Note that the HOMO energy level is determined by the 5TRh core, and the LUMO level is determined by the PC61BM terminal groups. This is because given that the structure between 5TRh and PC61BM is non-conjugated, oxidation must occur in the electron-rich 5TRh core whereas reduction occurs in the electron-deficient PC61BM moieties.

The overall energy diagram is depicted in Fig. 1c. Compatibilizers must have appropriate frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels so as not to disturb the intermolecular charge transfer and transport, because a dislocated energy-level alignment can cause the third component to serve as a trap-site of charge recombination. Based on the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PC61BM/PC71BM (−6.12 eV/−3.92 eV), PTB7-Th (−5.36 eV/−3.76 eV), PBDB-T (−5.40 eV/−3.58 eV), and P3HT (−5.14 eV/−3.23 eV), the 5TRh-PCBM compatibilizer (−5.42 eV/−3.92 eV) may function as the light-harvesting third component to form a ternary blend. The dual functions of 5TRh-PCBM can improve both the device efficiency and morphological stability, which is discussed in detail in the following section.

To determine the photovoltaic properties of the devices with addition of the compatibilizer and verify the wide range of its applicability, 5TRh-PCBM was blended into three different PSC systems of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDB-T:PC71BM, and P3HT:PC61BM. The devices of each PSC system were optimized with device structures of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag for PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs, ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag for PBDB-T:PC71BM PSCs, and ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:PC61BM/Al for P3HT:PC61BM PSCs, respectively. The detailed conditions for the device fabrication and characterization are described in the ESI.Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:5TRh-PCBM under AM 1.5G light illumination (100 mW cm−2), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters (i.e., open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE) are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, the device performance was significantly enhanced by incorporation of 5 and 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM as shown in Fig. 2b. In detail, the optimized blends of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:5TRh-PCBM exhibited higher PCEs of 10.09% (5 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM) and 9.72% (10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM) than that of the device without 5TRh-PCBM (9.37%), owing to the improvement of Jsc. The Jsc gradually increased from 17.88 ± 0.12 to 18.63 ± 0.04 (5 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM) and 18.91 ± 0.23 mA cm−2 (10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM), which can be ascribed to the additional light absorption by 5TRh-PCBM. The improved Jsc was identified from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The EQE spectra increased within the wavelength ranges of 300–400 and 500–600 nm, which are the two main absorption regions of 5TRh-PCBM (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the UV-vis spectra of the blend films of PTB7-Th:PC71BM (Fig. S7a) show increased light absorption with the addition of 5TRh-PCBM, which is consistent with the improved Jsc and EQE results. Also, in the PBDB-T:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM blend systems, the similar PCE trend was observed with enhanced light absorption, as shown in Fig. 3, Table 1, Fig. S7b and c. Consequently, these results indicate that the addition of 5TRh-PCBM can positively contribute to the PCEs of the different PSC systems.

Next, we examined the influence of the 5TRh-PCBM addition on the thermal stabilities of the PSCs. For the comparison of thermal stability, the PCEs of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PBDB-T:PC71BM PSCs with different amounts of 5TRh-PCBM (i.e., from 0 to 10 wt%) were monitored by annealing the films at 80 °C for different time intervals in an N2-filled glove box. For the P3HT:PC61BM PSC, annealing was performed at a higher temperature of 150 °C to accelerate the test. The normalized PCEs of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDB-T:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM blends are shown as a function of annealing time in Fig. 4. The detailed device performances are summarized in Tables S1–S3. In Fig. 4a, the PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system decreased rapidly in the absence of 5TRh-PCBM (i.e., decreased by 61% compared to the initial PCE upon annealing at 80 °C for 120 h). In contrast, under the same annealing condition, superior thermal stabilities were observed from the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with 5TRh-PCBM. For example, the PCEs of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with 5 and 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM were decreased only by 31% and 16%, respectively. Similarly, the improved thermal stability by the addition of 5TRh-PCBM was observed for the PBDB-T:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM devices as in Fig. 4b and c. The PCE of P3HT:PC61BM with 20 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM was decreased only by 6% after 120 h, even with the higher annealing temperature of 150 °C, whereas the PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM binary blend was reduced by 64% under the same condition.


To gain a better understanding of the dramatic enhancement of the thermal stabilities of the PSCs by the addition of 5TRh-PCBM, we examined the film morphologies of the active layers over a variety of length scales, from nanometers to tens of microns, using combinations of different microscopy and scattering techniques, including optical microscopy (OM), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), and grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS). First, the OM measurements were performed to investigate the morphological changes of the active layers upon heat exposure at the micron length-scale.Fig. 5a, b, S8 and S9 compare the OM images of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PBDB-T:PC71BM blends with and without 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM, annealed at 80 °C. For the blend film without 5TRh-PCBM, a number of dark spots associated with the formation of PCBM aggregates appeared and grew to over several microns as annealing time increased, indicating a progressive and pronounced phase separation of the two components. In stark contrast, for both the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PBDB-T:PC71BM blends, when 10 wt% 5TRh-PCBM was added, negligible morphological changes were observed. Similarly, clearly different morphologies were observed for the P3HT:PC61BM system with and without 5TRh-PCBM, where dark aggregates of PCBMs appeared only for the blend without the compatibilizer (Fig. 5c and S10). Thus, it suggests that the 5TRh-PCBM compatibilizer successfully suppressed the phase separation and stabilized the blend morphologies, providing superior thermal stabilities for the various PSC systems.

To better understand the role of the compatibilizer on the evolution of the blend morphology, we performed RSoXS measurements for the PBDB-T:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM blend films with and without 5TRh-PCBM (Fig. 6, S11 and S12). The RSoXS profiles for PBDB-T:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM were acquired at photon energies of 284.4 and 284.6 eV, respectively, at which the scattering intensities were maximized. Before annealing, the RSoXS profile of the PBDB-T:PC71BM binary system had one broad peak at q = 0.032 Å−1, corresponding to a domain spacing (d = 2πq−1) of 20 nm. As the annealing progressed at 80 °C, the d value slightly increased to 30 nm after 48 h. Importantly, the peak intensity became significantly stronger, suggesting greatly increased domain purity after the thermal annealing. These results might be attributed to the diffusion of PC71BM molecules into PC71BM-rich phases. Another noticeable change is the appearance of a high-intensity peak at q = 0.001 Å−1 (d = ∼630 nm), which correlates with the formation of large PC71BM aggregates, as shown in the OM image of the annealed PBDB-T:PC71BM film in Fig. 5b. In contrast, the PBDB-T:PC71BM blends with 5 and 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM did not exhibit any appearance of a new peak in the low q region, suggesting that the macroscopic phase-separation in the blend was suppressed in the presence of 5TRh-PCBM.
The same trend of stabilizing the morphology by adding 5TRh-PCBM was evident in P3HT:PC61BM. For the P3HT:PC61BM blend containing 20 wt% compatibilizer, neither scattering peak shift nor intensity change was observed after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 48 h. In contrast, for the blend without 5TRh-PCBM, a new high intensity peak appeared at q = 0.0015 Å−1 (d = ∼420 nm) after the same annealing treatment, which agrees well with the appearance of PC61BM crystallites in the OM image of Fig. 5c. The enhanced morphological stability in the presence of 5TRh-PCBM is also supported by the GIXS results, as shown in Fig. 7. Three different samples of P3HT:PC61BM blends, containing 0, 10, and 20 wt% of the compatibilizer, were investigated by GIXS to monitor their morphological changes against annealing time. The distinct scattering peaks at q = ∼0.7 and 1.4 Å−1, corresponding to the PC61BM crystallites, appeared only for the P3HT:PC61BM blend without 5TRh-PCBM. The phase-separated blend morphology deteriorates the charge dissociation and causes monomolecular recombination owing to the limited exciton diffusion length and smaller D/A interfaces.
Fabricating PSCs with high mechanical robustness is a prerequisite for the stable operation of the devices and their practical applications into flexible and wearable power generators. The use of compatibilizers has been an effective strategy for reinforcing the weak interface within the immiscible blends, thereby increasing the overall mechanical properties of the BHJ blend. To elucidate the effect of the 5TRh-PCBM compatibilizer on the mechanical strength of the BHJ blends, we measured the cohesive fracture energy (Gc) of the films without and with 5TRh-PCBM by utilizing the double cantilever beam fracture testing method (Fig. 8a). For the as-cast PTB7-Th:PC71BM films without annealing, the Gc value was increased from 1.68 ± 0.33 J m−2 to 2.25 ± 0.25 J m−2 by adding 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM (Fig. 8b). After the films were annealed, the increment of Gc was more distinct (i.e., from 1.47 ± 0.13 J m−2 to 2.73 ± 0.47 J m−2) with the addition of 5TRh-PCBM. This is because strong phase separation occurred in the pristine PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends rendering the films more brittle, whereas the compatibilizer successfully strengthened the D/A interfaces and suppressed the macroscopic phase separation. The same trend was also observed for the PBDB-T:PC71BM blends. For example, the Gc values of the annealed PBDB-T:PC71BM films increased from 1.06 ± 0.14 J m−2 to 2.93 ± 0.15 J m−2 (2.8-fold increase) after adding 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM. The preferential localization of 5TRh-PCBM at the D/A interfaces can modify the weak D/A interface, and reduce the interfacial tension. These features can result in enhancing the resistance against the crack growth and debonding between the two phases, leading to improved mechanical PSC robustness.

In conclusion, we report a rationally designed A–D–A type molecular compatibilizer (5TRh-PCBM) to enhance the thermal/mechanical properties while simultaneously improve the PSC performance. Consisting of an oligothiophene segment at the core and fullerene derivatives as the end groups, 5TRh-PCBM can be generally applied to different types of BHJ blends containing PCBM acceptors and thiophene based polymer donors, such as PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PBDB-T:PC71BM, and P3HT:PC61BM. In all of these BHJ PSCs, the addition of small amounts of 5TRh-PCBM as a multi-functional compatibilizer led to significant improvement of morphological stabilities against thermal stresses. Moreover, the mechanical properties of all these PSCs were also greatly improved with the presence of the compatibilizer, as examined by the double cantilever beam tests. For instance, the Gc of the PBDB-T:PC71BM blend showed a 2.8-fold increment by incorporating 10 wt% of 5TRh-PCBM. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to previously reported compatibilizers with negative impacts on the PCEs, the addition of 5TRh-PCBM also led to improved PCEs, which is attributed to the additional light harvesting capability of 5TRh-PCBM. Overall, our work provides a simple yet versatile strategy for the development of proper compatibilizers for PSCs to achieve enhanced device stability while maintaining (or even improving) their high PCEs.
