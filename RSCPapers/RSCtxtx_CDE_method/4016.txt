The design and fabrication of better excitonic solar cells are the need of the hour for futuristic energy solutions. This designing needs a better understanding of the charge transport properties of excitonic solar cells. One of the popular methods of understanding the charge transport properties is the analysis of the J–V characteristics of a device through theoretical simulation at varied illumination intensity. Herein, a J–V characteristic of a polymer:fullerene based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) of structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM (∼100 nm)/Al (∼120 nm) is analyzed using one- and two-diode models at varied illumination intensity in the range of 0.1–2.33 Sun. It was found that the double diode model is better with respect to the single diode model and can explain the J–V characteristics of the OSCs correctly. Further, the recombination mechanism is investigated thoroughly and it was observed that fill factor (FF) is in the range of 62.5%–41.4% for the corresponding values of the recombination-to-extraction ratio (θ) varying from 0.001 to 0.023. These findings are attributed to the change in charge transport mechanism from trap-assisted to bimolecular recombination with the variation of illumination intensity.

In recent years, polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention from researchers due to their inherent advantages such as cost effectiveness, large area, and ease of fabrication on flexible substrates. A number of review articles are present in the literature that describe advances in solution-processed OSCs. In spite of the various advantages, instability of organic materials under ambient conditions and low power conversion efficiency (η) over a larger area limit their possible commercialization. To achieve a high-performance OSC over a larger area, the polymer donors and fullerene-based acceptors along with suitable interface layers are the key issues that need to be addressed and optimized.

In recent years, η of single- and multi-junction OSCs has increased up to 11.5% and 13.2%, respectively. Further, it is expected that the use of better absorbing materials with low band gap-voltage offset and optimization of design parameters may improve η up to a theoretical limiting value of 27%. The η of an OSC is determined by factors such as (a) photon absorption by the absorber material, (b) exciton generation, (c) diffusion of excitons, (d) electron–hole separation, (e) electron/hole transport towards respective electrodes, and (f) electron/hole collection at respective electrodes. In the process of exciton diffusion, recombination of charge carriers often takes place and even after exciton dissociation, electrons and holes may also have the opportunity to recombine with each other. The dissociation of excitons at the donor–acceptor interface depends on the organic semiconductor binding energy (ΔE), which is relatively higher (0.2–1.0 eV) with respect to common inorganic semiconductors (∼0.025 eV). Hence, excitons, in the case of organic semiconductors, need a higher internal electric field to dissociate into free charge carriers. This internal electric field between donor–acceptor interfaces depends on the thickness (which is normally below 300 nm for optimal OSC devices) and morphology of the active layer. Further, competition exists between the recombination and extraction of charges, which principally determines the dependence of the photocurrent on bias and hence the extractable PMAX. Moreover, exciton generation and charge extraction are governed by a complex interplay between the effects of active layer thickness, charge transport, recombination strength, and light intensity. Significant advancement in the understanding of the parameters governing short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) has been achieved while a similar understanding is lacking for the extraction of maximum power (PMAX) with higher fill factor (FF) from devices under realistic light intensity variations. Hence, to maximize the PMAX one has to homogenize all electric performance parameters. Further, the presence of space charge limited current and traps in OSCs leads to high recombination of charge carriers and ultimately lowers the value of FF and η. These mechanisms lead to the deviation of measured J–V characteristics from the ideal case of drift-diffusion transport of charge carriers in the BHJ organic solar cell. This is where modeling plays an important role.
The motivation behind the present simulation study is to establish the charge carrier extraction and recombination mechanisms in OSCs by using the diode equivalent circuit model. The conventional single diode model, which is highly useful for silicon-based solar cells, is inadequate to describe the electrical response of OSCs due to its inability to include the effects of recombination. Hence, a two-diode model based equivalent circuit has been considered to study the nonideal J–V characteristics of OSCs, which provides an accurate description of trap-limited recombination due to disorder at the donor–acceptor interface by the introduction of two ideality factors. The double diode model includes the effect of series resistance, shunt resistance, and ideality factor, and reverses saturation current on the J–V characteristics of OSCs, determining their effect on overall electrical performance. Hence, herein, we will be presenting a simulation study of J–V characteristics of OSCs under various light intensities, to quantify the effect of light intensity on the series resistance (RS), shunt resistance (RSH), and diode ideality factors. This type of simulation helps in understanding the dependence of the device parameters on the varying illumination levels and provides an insight into the working of the BHJ OSC to achieve better η and PMAX. Moreover, the dependence of VOC on the generation (Gex) and recombination rate (krec) has also been reported to provide a deeper understanding of the recombination mechanism. In addition, we have demonstrated the effect of the recombination-to-extraction ratio θ on the FF as well. Further, the correlation between the performance parameters and θ provides a basis for comparison among various devices to control parameters for device design and fabrication. Hence, the study provides a possibility to optimize the device design and fabrication parameters to maximize power generation.

Under a realistic working scenario in the field, OSCs need to face variable illumination conditions, both in light intensity and spectrum. The variable light intensity influences the performance parameters of the device. As the efficiency depends on the light intensity and spectrum, the design of the cell must be optimized accordingly. Modeling is an important tool to understand the correlation between performance parameters and light intensity. In order to get an insight into the loss mechanism behind the varying electrical performance with respect to the light intensity, a device having a structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) (∼40 nm)/PTB7 (poly{4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2 ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}):PC71BM (phenyl-C71butyric acid methyl ester) (∼100 nm)/Al (aluminum) (∼120 nm) is modeled with the conventional two-diode model (Fig. 1) using MATLAB/Simulink (MATLAB 7.6.0.324, R2008a). It is important to understand the shortcomings of the one-diode theory of solar cells, which usually assumes an electrically homogeneous cell as described by the Shockley diode equation. The fundamental equation for the one-diode model is as follows:

(1)

J is the current density measured at the cell electrodes, V is the voltage measured across the cell, JPH is the photo-generated current density, J0 is the reverse saturation current density, q is the electron charge, RS is the series resistance, RSH is the shunt resistance, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and n is the ideality factor. The one-diode model fits the J–V curve with accuracy under standard conditions (100 mW cm−2) but it does not fit well in the dark and under varying light intensities with experimental data of solar cells due to inaccurate determination of specific loss currents (described in ESI).

In the two-diode equivalent circuit diagram of an OSC, upon illumination, the current source generates a photo-generated current density of JPH, which is governed by the number of dissociated excitons, i.e., free electron–hole pairs generated immediately before any recombination occurs. The recombination centres near the dissociation site (donor–acceptor interface) and away from the dissociation site (near electrode) affect the shunt resistance (RSH) of the OSC. The series resistance (RS) is caused by the limited mobility of specific charge carriers in the transport medium due to the presence of space charges and traps. The terminal equation for current–voltage characteristics of the device is given by:
J = JPH − JD1 − JD2 − (V + JRS)/RSH
(2)
where,
JD1 and JD2 represent the current densities of diode 1 and 2, respectively, JD1 arises due to the diffusion of minority carriers in the quasi-neutral region (QNR) and depends on the reverse saturation current density Ji, while JD2 is due to the defect-induced charge recombination in the space charge region (SCR). The dependence of current density and diode current for both the diodes is given as:

(3)
(4)
where
V1 = V2 = V + JRS, kB represents Boltzmann's constant, T represents the absolute temperature, q represents the electron charge, and Ji represents the reverse saturation current, viz. the electronic conduction phenomena in the quasi-neutral region just outside the narrow space charge region of the bulk heterojunction, such as diffusion, recombination and drift effects, whereas Jr corresponds to carrier recombination through deep trap levels inside the space charge region of the interface. The reverse saturation current density Jr is generally 3–7 orders of magnitude larger than Ji; the diode ideality factor n accounts for the diffusive transport mechanism and also corresponds to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination current density. The diode ideality factor m represents the charge carrier collection loss due to overall recombination of the charge carriers within the active layer.

Under illumination (IL), eqn (2) can be represented as follows:
(5)
The
VOC and FF of the OSC under IL in the range of 0–2.33 Sun (where 1 Sun represents AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are expressed as below under ideal conditions, i.e. RS → 0 and RSH → ∞:

(6)
(7)
where
Vt represents thermal voltage (kBT/q). The maximum power output of the OSC is related to the JSC and VOC by:

PMAX = FF·VOC·JSC
(8)
The efficiency of the solar cell in relation to the
PMAX is given by:

(9)
where
Pin represents the incident solar radiation.

The characteristic resistive parameters of the OSCs, i.e. RS and RSH, are dependent on the blend formation, layer solidification, and contact formation processes. These parameters can be calculated by the slope of the current–voltage characteristic curve near VOC and JSC, respectively. The aforementioned two-diode model also allows the recombination kinetics of an organic solar cell to be analyzed under nonequilibrium conditions.

The interface between donor and acceptor is analogous to the Schottky diode that can act as a heterojunction for excitation and dissociation of charge carriers due to the existence of an internal electric field developed at the junction. The net junction resistance (RJ) of the solar cell is given as: RJ = [(Rrec)−1 + (RSH)−1]−1, where Rrec is the recombination resistance. The analytical form of Rrec can be deduced from the voltage dependence of eqn (5) at intermediate and strong forward bias (FB). The total resistance RT is a combination of RS, RSH and Rrec which can be expressed as:

(10)
Under the condition of reverse bias (RB), (
Rrec/RSH) ≫ [1 + J(dRS/dV)], eqn (10) becomes RT = [RSH(Rrec + RS)/Rrec] and the junction resistance ≈ RSH. The evaluation of RS is valid in a narrow potential region of high FB where the cell current is high and voltage dependence of RS and m are negligible. Generally, RS is governed by various voltages independent physical mechanisms originating at different layers or interlayers within the solar cell, viz.: front and back contact of ITO, active layer (PTB7, PC71BM) and electrode (Al), light intensity, device temperature and on charge carrier generation and recombination.

Recombination in a PTB7:PC71BM based OSC was investigated by measuring Rrec with respect to junction voltage. The recombination resistance of a solar cell is expressed by:
Rrec = (kBT/qβJi)exp(−qβV/kBT)
(11)
The slope of
Rrec near the open circuit potential provides the value of β. The value of β indicates the order of recombination, which needs to be minimized for better performance of the device in terms of an improvement in the FF. The FF depends on the recombination of generated charge carriers and the extraction of remaining charge carriers, which is quantified in terms of θ using the values of VOC and mathematically defined as:

(12)
where,
μn = 2.3 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 and μn = 2.3 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 are the electron and hole mobilities, respectively, γ is the strength of bimolecular recombination and is given by γpre·kL, where γpre is a dimensionless reduction prefector varying between 1 and 1 × 10−3. The reason behind this broader range is a large variation in the device performance with respect to the illumination. The variation may be attributed to different values of recombination with an upper limit defined by kL. The term γpre represents a reduction factor to the upper limit and explains the performance of the device on the basis of the order of recombination. kL is the classical Langevin recombination coefficient, kex represents the charge carrier extraction rate that can be approximated as 2μnVOC/L2, L represents the active layer thickness and krec represents the recombination rate of electron with holes near the cathode as expressed below:

krec = γ·nP
(13)
where
nP = GexL2/4μPVOC represents the carrier density of the holes near cathode, and Gex represents the generation rate (= JPH/qL).


To explore the photovoltaic performance of a PTB7 organic material, a BHJ solar cell was fabricated using a blend of PTB7:PC71BM with a blend ratio of 1:1.5 with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM (100 nm)/Al (120 nm).


The following materials were used as received: PTB7 (1-materials, Canada), PC71BM (1-materials, Canada), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH)), chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich), and diiodooctane (Sigma-Aldrich). PTB7 (10 mg) and PC71BM (15 mg) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) + DIO (97:3 wt%) inside a nitrogen glove box. The solution was left stirring overnight at 60 °C.


Devices were fabricated using a conventional structure, i.e. indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. A schematic diagram of the fabricated solar cell and the corresponding energy band diagram are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. For device fabrication, the ITO glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) were sonicated in a soap solution, acetone, and isopropanol. Cleaned ITO glasses were then exposed to ultraviolet–ozone irradiation for 20 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm) was spin coated over ITO glass and dried at 140 °C in air for 20 min. Active layers (PTB7:PC71BM) (∼80 nm) with the blend ratio of 1:1.5 were spin coated using the solutions (chlorobenzene solvent with 25 mg ml−1) in a glove box. Finally, Al (∼100 nm) electrode was thermally deposited in high vacuum (∼8 × 10−6 mbar), over the active layer through a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was ∼4 mm2 in all cases. The fabricated solar cells were encapsulated using epoxy and a cover glass and kept for 15 min under ultraviolet irradiation. The J–V characteristics of these devices were measured under a solar simulator with varying intensity in the range of 10–233 mW cm−2 with a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 source meter unit. The results of the best device have been analyzed in the following section.


The J–V characteristics of the fabricated devices are shown in Fig. 3. A two-diode theoretical model is used to fit experimental data to explore the role of resistive parameters. The symbols represent the experimental data points and the solid line represents the theoretical fit with the key parameters listed in Table 1.

Under open circuit conditions, the heterojunction remains under forward bias due to the light-generated carriers on both sides of the junction, which increases the diffusion current (Fig. 3). The balance between drift and diffusion current in opposite directions results in zero current from the PTB7:PC71BM OSC under open circuit conditions. The electrical performance parameters of the devices, i.e., the values of VOC, JSC, FF and η were found to be VOC = 0.721 V, JSC = 14.6 mA cm−2, FF = 52.5% and η = 5.52%, respectively at 100 mW cm−2. A comparatively low fill factor may be associated with the presence of a high-series resistance of the active layer/electrode interface, which severely affects the shape of the J–V curve. In spite of a higher series resistance in the sample, η calculated from the J–V curve (Fig. 3) is comparable to other reports for a PTB7:PC71BM based device. The high JSC measured for the PTB7:PC71BM based OSC could be attributed to the material properties, i.e. a wide absorption window compared to other organic absorber materials, high absorption coefficient, and better charge carrier mobility. Along with the JSC. the other parameters responsible for improving the efficiency of the solar cell are its impressive VOC, which is comparable to the devices reported by other researchers recently. Using the two-diode model, experimental dark J–V characteristics of the fabricated OSC were fitted, as shown in Fig. 4, and compared with the one-diode model (Fig. S1, ESI). In contrast to the one-diode model, the dark characteristics of the OSC in forward and reverse bias can be well explained by the two-diode model (described in ESI). In low forward bias, the recombination current always dominates over diffusion current, which is difficult to estimate by the single diode. In the case of reverse bias, current originates due to the movement of electrons from one of the contacts of the OSC (ITO) towards the other metallic contact (Al). The magnitude of the generated current density remains negligible due to the barrier provided by the broader space charge region. This phenomenon cannot be explained using eqn (1). The low reverse voltage region corresponding to ohmic conduction can be explained by introducing another diode connected in parallel to the existing diode 1 of the conventional model, as shown in Fig. 1. This modified equivalent circuit points to inhomogeneity of electrical characteristics of the OSC over its 2D active area and provides an improved fit to the nonlinear experimental data with reduced deviation. The ideality factors and the saturation currents of PTB7:PC71BM based OSCs were calculated to be 1.9, 4.05 and 7.75 × 10−14 A cm−2, and 1.35 × 10−9 A cm−2 for diode 1 and 2, respectively. Under illumination, a value of ideality factor ≥2 for a heterojunction solar cell is due to the gradually saturating recombination of charge carriers with increasing forward bias. Further, a high ideality factor is also due to their combination via a coupled defect level at the weak intrinsic field or a rapid charge transfer between donor and acceptor with high probability of tunneling where at least one of these levels is shallow. Another reason for a high ideality factor is the limited open circuit voltage of polymer:fullerene solar cells due to surface recombination.

The J–V characteristics at various light intensities are shown in Fig. 5(a). The various parameters such as JSC, VOC, FF, and η of the PTB7:PC71BM based devices were calculated for varying intensities of illumination using the presented theoretical model. The electrical performance parameters under various illumination intensities are listed in Table 2. With increasing illumination from 0.1 Sun to 2.33 Sun, the JSC increases from 1.9 to 33.4 mA cm−2, the VOC increases from 0.66 V to 0.744 V, and η varies in the range of 7.95%–4.4%. A linear relationship between JSC and illumination intensity was observed. The increasing trend of JSC with an increase in illumination is consistent with the observation of other experimental studies for a PTB7:PC71BM based device. In principle, JSC shows a power-law dependence on light intensity for an organic solar cell, which can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Pin)S. Here, Pin represents light intensity and S is the exponential factor. A linear dependence of JSC on illumination intensity with a value of S close to 1 may be attributed to weak bimolecular recombination in the device.Fig. 5(b) illustrates JSC as a function of Pin for a PTB7:PC71BM blend ratio of 1:1.5 with a corresponding extracted S value of 0.992. Fig. 5(b) also illustrates the relation between efficiency and light intensity, and shows a linearly decreasing behavior within the limits of studying illumination (up to 2.33 Sun), as per the data shown in Table 2. A description of the chosen values of input parameters and their effect on the efficiency of OSCs in terms of percentage deviation is provided in the ESI (kindly see Fig. S1–S3 and Tables S1–S5).

Fig. 5(c) shows the relationship between VOC and Pin. The slope of VOCversus log(Pin) leads to the determination of the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the devices. A slope of >2kBT/q implies that bimolecular recombination is the dominating mechanism. In the present study, the fabricated device based on PTB7:PC71BM shows a slope of 2.37kBT/q, which indicates bimolecular recombination as the dominating recombination mechanism. The secondary axis in Fig. 5(c) describes the dependence of the FF on the light intensity, which is discussed in later sections.
The decrease in the efficiency of the solar cell with increasing illumination intensity mainly depends on the resistive power losses equivalent to J2RS in the OSC, which reduces its FF. The current density of the OSC in the range of JSC to JMAX is dependent on the RSH and the voltage output of the OSC in the range of VMAX to VOC is dependent on RS. Further, the reduction in RSH with respect to increasing illumination intensity [secondary axis of Fig. 5(d)] is due to the slightly different heterojunction capacitance behavior of the PTB7:PC71BM based OSC. The variation in the number of minority charge carriers with respect to illumination intensity and the occupation of the electronic density of states (DOS) influence the RSH. An increase in the illumination intensity results in an introduction of excess minority carriers with an insignificant change in the number of majority carriers. Energetic disorder in the organic semiconductors characterized by the scattering of the electronic DOS of the donor and acceptor materials constituting the active layer influences the RSH and VOC.
Additionally, by examining the recombination resistance as a function of the light intensity (Fig. 6) it was observed that at low applied voltage, the resistive part arising from RSH decreases by up to 2 orders of magnitude when the sample is illuminated up to 2.33 Sun, as compared to the measurement performed under dark conditions. This result is in clear contrast to the published data for the PTB7:PC60BM system in which the resistive part varies by a factor of 3 when the device is illuminated from dark conditions to 1 Sun. For the PTB7:PC71BM OSC, this variation in the RSH indicates that the conductivity of the device is increasing with the increase of the light intensity resulting in an enhanced leakage current, which reduces the RSH. The indicated trend is not well understood and may be attributed to either photo doping of the polymer material or light-induced reduction in contact selectivity. Further, it is noted from Fig. 6 that in the high voltage region, the slope d(lnRT)/dV decreases with an increase in the light intensity from 0.1 Sun to 2.33 Sun in the range of 0.52q/kBT to 0.28q/kBT. This result indicates an enhanced recombination under high illumination intensity conditions. The rate of recombination is dependent on the charge carrier density of holes near the cathode (np), which varies with illumination intensity. The effect of light intensity on Gex is shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a), and shows a linear dependence. Further, the dependence of VOC on Gex is shown in Fig. 7(a). It shows a logarithmic dependence. Using the calculated values of Gex for various illumination intensities, the charge carrier density of holes near the cathode (np) was calculated and is shown in Fig. 7(b). It shows an expected linear dependence. Using eqn (12), the recombination rate (krec) was calculated with respect to np and was found to vary linearly, explaining that with increasing intensity, the Gex increases, which favors more carrier generation and hence more recombination (Fig. 7(c)). The np depends on the mobility of charge carriers and hence it controls the recombination, which is obvious from the slow increase of recombination rate with np. With the increase of light intensity, np is controlled by the number of traps and hence the recombination rate.
Further, the variations of VOC and FF are shown in Fig. 7(d). It can be seen from this figure that with increasing intensity, the recombination rate and VOC increase whereas the FF is found to decrease. Moreover, a comparison of Fig. 7(a) and (d) shows that the recombination rate is low at lower illumination intensity signifying trap-assisted recombination. This is characterized as a first-order recombination process. With increasing generation rate at higher illumination intensity, a higher recombination rate signifies a bimolecular recombination process (characterized as second order). This may be explained on the basis of filling of traps by photoexcitation with increasing illumination and corresponding generation rate so the recombination is controlled by a bimolecular process at higher illumination intensities. It is clear that with increasing recombination, the FF decreases [Fig. 7(d)], which reduces the efficiency of the OSC with increasing illumination intensity.

Fig. 8 shows a plot of the FF with respect to θ under various illumination intensities. An exponential decrease of the FF is observed with respect to the increasing illumination intensity under the influence of increasing recombination rate and change in the recombination process. For lower θ at 0.1 Sun, the highest value of FF (= 62.5%) is achieved and for a high θ at 2.33 Sun, the lowest value of FF (= 41.4%) is obtained. This also indicates that a comparatively higher FF can be maintained before the takeover of the recombination mechanism from the trap-assisted to the bimolecular. These findings make it possible to predict the effect of dynamic behaviour of input variables (illumination intensity in the present case) on the FF. Under the bimolecular recombination process, more recombination takes place, which results in a lower extraction of charge carriers whereas in the case of a trap-assisted process, significantly less recombination takes place resulting in a greater extraction of charge carriers. This behavior indicates that there exists a competition between charge recombination and extraction. It governs the FF in the range of 62.5%–41.4% for the range of θ from 0.001 to 0.023 under the influence of varying illumination intensity.
Overall, understanding the electrical equivalent circuit parameters for a given OSC provides useful information to further improve its performance. By relating particular physical effects of the device to the representing electrical circuit parameter, one may get an insight into the required control parameters for the device design and fabrication. This means that the electrical equivalent circuit model presents a possibility to optimize the device design and fabrication parameters to maximize the power generation. From the analysis done above, the influence of incident light intensity variation on the electrical equivalent circuit parameters and their corresponding effect on the J–V characteristics can be quantitatively described. For example, from the data listed in Table 2, a solar cell subjected to higher illumination deviates from the ideal behavior with n value increasing from 1.9 to 3.26 and m value increasing from 4.05 to 6.45, respectively. This leads to a smaller fill factor as compared to the OSC simulated for lower illumination levels. Further, the RS is not affected much due to the illumination intensity variation (a variation of ±8% only with respect to 1 Sun value), but there is a drastic change in the RSH, which changes in the range of ±300% with respect to 1 Sun value. The significantly decreasing RSH with respect to the illumination intensity is responsible for the reduction of FF and efficiency of the OSC. The observed change in the RSH further indicates the formation of the leakage path across the heterojunction interfaces with increasing illumination intensity. This is confirmed by an increase in recombination current Jr values by more than an order of magnitude (1.35 × 10−9 A cm−2 in dark to 1.85 × 10−8 A cm−2 at 2.33 Sun). The saturation current density Ji is also changed significantly by four orders of magnitude indicating the poor quality of rectification with increasing illumination intensity. Although the JSC increased linearly with intensity of illumination and as expected, the VOC increases logarithmically, but the expected gains in η are not achieved due to the major setback of FF. The results presented here provide new insights into the physics governing the better photovoltaic performance of PTB7:PC71BM based organic solar cells and help to explain why the performance parameters change significantly with light intensity. The results discussed in this article reveal the change in the mechanism of recombination from trap-assisted to bimolecular under the influence of light using the correlation between a dimensionless parameter θ and FF. This analysis suggests that further improvement in device fabrication and blend morphology is needed to reduce the recombination at high light intensity.

In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated the simulation of J–V characteristics of PTB7:PC71BM based OSCs by a double diode model and revealed a correlation between charge carrier recombination and its extraction under varying illumination intensity. The extracted device parameters JSC, VOC, FF and η have been analyzed at various light intensities. The analyzed device parameters show a strong correlation between charge carrier recombination and their extraction, which controls the performance of the device and in particular, the FF, which decreases from 62.5% to 41.4% for the corresponding values of recombination-to-extraction ratio (θ) in the range 0.001–0.023 for increasing illumination. These changes have been attributed to a mechanism wherein the charge transport in these devices undergoes a change from trap-assisted to bimolecular recombination on increased illumination.
