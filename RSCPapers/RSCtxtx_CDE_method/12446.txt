We report on solar cells based on CdS QD sensitized anatase TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures prepared via a facile and controlled hydrothermal process. To adjust the size of CdS QDs, the TiO2 surfaces were first treated with thiolactic acid which provides a binding site for Cd2+ ions. CdS QDs with controllable size are grown onto the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. The CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites display a red shift from the ultraviolet to the visible light region with a longer wavelength for the absorption edge. The matching of band edges between CdS and TiO2 to form a semiconductor heterojunction plays an important role in effective separation of light induced electrons and holes, providing a promising photoanode for its wide absorption spectrum, high electron injection efficiency, and fast electron transference. Under UV-vis irradiation, both CdS and TiO2 are excited. Under visible light irradiation, photons are captured by CdS QDs, with the photogenerated electron–hole pairs rapidly separated into electrons and holes at the interface between TiO2 and CdS QDs. In addition to this, more photoelectrons are generated from TiO2 by harvesting UV photons. TiO2 collects the photoelectrons from CdS and passes them through to the back contact. The holes (from both CdS and TiO2) generated in the process are transferred to the solid–liquid interface. Under one sun illumination, the solar cells based on CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites with a smaller average size of 7.6 nm for CdS QDs show a maximum short circuit current density of 6.09 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 3.06%. The performance improvement of the solar cells based on CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to the unique microstructure characteristics and the bandgap energy matching between the CdS QDs and TiO2.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are of great interest to researchers due to the projected cost-effectiveness, the relatively high photoelectric conversion efficiency, and unique advantages of transparent cells over conventional silicon photovoltaics. Typically, DSSCs consist of a sensitizing dye, a mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode, a Pt-coated counterelectrode and an electrolyte containing a redox couple, i.e., I−/I3−. In order to improve cell performance, much attention has been paid to develop sensitizing dyes, TiO2 photoelectrodes, electrolytes, and counterelectrodes. In particular, the TiO2 photoelectrode is a very important element because its characteristics of sensitizer absorption, electron transport and recombination can be controlled by properties such as crystallinity, phase, particle size, surface area, interconnection between particles and pore morphology. Recently, great progress has been made in controlling the microstructures of TiO2 materials, such as nanocrystals, nanorods, nanofibers, nanosheets and hierarchical structures. Hierarchical structures have recently attracted much attention due to the synergistic advantages of mesoporous and macroscale morphologies. For example, assemblies of mesoporous TiO2 particles (with diameters of several hundred nanometers) and nanostructured TiO2 fibers have been applied in this regard. The morphology can be controlled by adjusting the composition of the precursor, while the macroscale morphologies arose from the assembling of the particles or nanowires.

However, one of the critical drawbacks of TiO2 lies in its wide bandgap of 3.2 eV corresponding to ultraviolet (UV) light, which takes only 3.5% of the whole solar spectrum, of which the wavelength below ~390 nm of the solar spectrum can be utilized by pure TiO2. To improve the photoelectron energy efficiency, many efforts including dye sensitization, doping, and coupling with low bandgap semiconductors such as PbS, CdTe, CdSe, ZnFe2O4, Cu2O and CdS have been made to extend the optical absorption of TiO2 into the visible-light region.
Among the low bandgap semiconductors, CdS as a type of semiconductor with a direct bandgap (Egap) of 2.25 eV can trigger a wider light absorption range after combination with TiO2. Because CdS has a high conduction band edge with respect to TiO2, a higher electron injection efficiency of CdS was indeed found in comparison with CdSe. To date, various approaches have been reported to modify or sensitize TiO2 with CdS QDs, such as sequential chemical bath deposition (S-CBD), successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), electrochemical deposition, or the use of a bifunctional organic linker. The fabrication of CdS QD sensitized TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures with large surface areas and their application for solar cells are still challenging issues.
In this work, we fabricated CdS QD sensitized anatase TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures via a facile and controlled hydrothermal process. To adjust the size of CdS QDs and prevent the formation of large sized CdS, the TiO2 surfaces were first treated with thiolactic acid which provides a binding site for Cd2+ ions. Since the amount of the thiolactic acid linker determines the amount of Cd ions that are bonded to TiO2, the amount of thiolactic acid indirectly determines the size of the CdS QDs. Thus, CdS QDs with controllable size were grown onto the TiO2 surfaces by reacting Na2S with the Cd2+ ions absorbed on the pretreated surfaces. As a type of composite semiconductor with CdS QD sensitized TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures, it provides a promising photoanode for its wide absorption spectrum, high electron injection efficiency, and fast electron transference. The interfacial structure of the two semiconductors provides an efficient charge transfer channel. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the as-synthesized CdS QD modified anatase TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures show a high short-circuit current density of 6.09 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 3.06% under one sun illumination.

TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures were synthesized according to the literature procedure. A typical 60 mg of titanium powder was added to 60 mL of a 10 M NaOH aqueous solution and then treated under sonication at room temperature for 10 min. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, followed by the addition of hydrogen peroxide (30%, 0.5 mL) under stirring. After the mixture was stirred for 2 min, it was heated to 150 °C and kept for 2 h. The obtained white precipitate was washed with 0.2 M HCl and deionized water until a pH value of 7 was reached. Finally, the products were dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 5 h, then calcined at 550 °C for 2 h.


TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures were pretreated under different concentrations of thiolactic acid (0.1, 0.3, 0.6 M in deionized water, pH = 1) for 30 min and then dried at 50 °C for 10 h. A 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2 aqueous solution was then added into the pretreated TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures to allow Cd2+ ions to be absorbed on the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructure surfaces (pH = 3). To grow the CdS QDs on the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures, a 0.5 M Na2S aqueous solution was added, significantly increasing the pH of the solution from 3 to 12. The fabrication process of CdS/TiO2 hierarchical nanocomposites is presented in Scheme 1.


X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Philips Rigaku D/Max-kA X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source at 40 kV and 30 mA. The surface microstructure and chemical components of the products were analyzed using SU-70 field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and attached X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The absorption spectra and the UV/visible diffuse-reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry (TU-1900). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined at 77 K using a Gold APP V-Sorb 2800P surface area and porosity 60 analyzer. The surface area measurements were performed according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, while the pore size distribution was obtained from the adsorption branch of isotherms using the corrected form of the Kelvin equation by means of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Dye uptake per unit area (1 cm2) was investigated using UV-Vis spectroscopy (TU-1900) by the dissolution of the dye adsorbed TiO2 (CdS/TiO2) film membrane in 0.2 M NaOH in water and ethanol (50:50, v/v) solution. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) characterization and microstructural analyses were carried out using a Phillips Tecnai 20U-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Cells were tested using a solar simulator (Newport, Class 3A, 94023A) at one-sun irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using a Keithley 2420 SourceMeter equipped with a calibrated Si-reference cell (certified by NREL). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were tested in a Princeton Parstate 2273A with a two-electrode design; the TiO2 (CdS/TiO2) films served as a working electrode and the Pt-coated ITO or FTO/glass as a counterelectrode at an applied bias of the open circuit voltage under one-sun irradiation. The frequency range was 10 mHz to 100 kHz; the magnitude of the alternating potential was 20 mV. The EIS data were analyzed with an appropriate equivalent circuit using the simulation software.


For the working electrode, the fabrication process of TiO2 paste was described in detail as follows. 0.12 g of ethyl cellulose powders (Aladdin Reagents, China) were dissolved in ethanol to yield a 10 wt% solution. The obtained mixture was added into 0.2 g of the calcined TiO2 and 0.8 g of terpineol (Aladdin Reagents, China) and was diluted with 1.0 mL of ethanol. The mixture was then stirred in a magnetic field and sonicated by an ultrasonic horn for three consecutive times. Finally, the obtained paste was spin-coated over several cycles onto an FTO glass substrate using a spin coating apparatus at 2000 rpm for several seconds to obtain a film of the required thickness. In order to remove the polymer template and the organic compounds, the TiO2 photoelectrode was dried at 125 °C, and gradually heated under flowing air at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and at 500 °C for 15 min.

After calcination, the TiO2 electrodes with an active working area of 0.4 × 0.4 = 0.16 cm2 were immersed into a 0.5 mM N-719 dye ethanol solution in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile (Aladdin Reagents, China) and tert-butanol (Aladdin Reagents, China) at room temperature for 24 h. Subsequently, the dye loaded photoanode and the Pt-counterelectrode (Dyesol) were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a spacer of 25 μm thickness (Surlyn, DuPont). The internal space of the cell was filled with a liquid electrolyte, which consisted of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP) in a (85:15, vol%) mixture of acetonitrile (Aladdin Reagents, China) and valeronitrile (Aladdin Reagents, China).


Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 samples prepared in different concentrations of thiolactic acid: (a) 0.1 M, (b) 0.3 M and (c) 0.6 M. From the XRD patterns in Fig. 1a, the peaks at 2θ = 25.3, 37.8, and 48° correspond well with the (101), (004) and (220) planes of anatase TiO2 with lattice constants of a = 3.785 Å and c = 9.513 Å (PDF: 21-1272) (space group: I41/amd), respectively. The two small peaks (Fig. 1a) at 2θ = 35.1 and 40.2° are in agreement with the (100) and (101) planes of Ti with lattice constants of a = b = 2.95 Å and c = 4.681 Å (space group: p63/mmc) (PDF: 65-6231). The XRD pattern in Fig. 1a indicates that the acquired products after annealing at 550 °C are composed of anatase TiO2 and a little amount of residual Ti at the core of the hierarchical nanostructures.

The XRD patterns in Fig. 1b–d demonstrate the phase components of the products obtained after treatment in Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S aqueous solution. Besides the anatase TiO2, the presence of the CdS phase with face centered cubic (fcc) lattice structures can also be determined in the synthesized products. The peaks at 26.4, 43.9, and 52° correspond well with the (111), (220) and (311) planes of CdS (PDF: 65-2887) (space group: F3m). The size of the CdS can be calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation; average sizes are 7.6, 9.0, and 10.5 nm, corresponding to the concentrations of thiolactic acid of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 M, respectively. It is shown that the size of the CdS increased with an increase in the concentration of thiolactic acid. Hence, the size of the CdS can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of thiolactic acid.

The synthesized products were observed under a Hitachi SU-70 thermal field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), as shown in Fig. 2. A low magnification SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the synthesized pure TiO2 products display spherical morphology with a uniform size distribution of 2 μm in diameter. From the magnified SEM images of single spherical TiO2 in Fig. 2b–c, it is revealed that the synthesized TiO2 spherical products display three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures composed of self-supported radial nanoflakes with a larger specific surface area and a high surface-to-volume ratio. The radially distributed nanoflakes are just like the petals in a natural chrysanthemum-flower structure with a thickness of several nanometers. Fig. 2d, e and f give the FESEM morphologies of the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical nanocomposites obtained under pretreatment in 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 M thiolactic acid, respectively. For the growth of the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction, in order to adjust the size of CdS QDs and prevent the formation of large sized CdS on the surface of TiO2, the TiO2 surfaces were first treated with thiolactic acid to link the thiol group on the surface of TiO2, providing a binding site for Cd2+ ions. The amount of thiolactic acid linkers determines the amount of Cd ions that are bonded to the TiO2, and the CdS QDs with a controllable size can grow onto the TiO2 surfaces by reacting Na2S with the Cd2+ ions adsorbed on the pretreated surfaces. It has shown via XRD analyses that by adjusting the concentration of thiolactic acid, CdS QDs with 7.6, 8.9, and 10.5 nm were obtained. It shows that with an increase in the concentration of thiolactic acid (Fig. 2d–f), the size of the CdS QDs grown on the surface of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures increases.

The elemental energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping characterization was used to investigate the chemical composition component and elemental distribution of the CdS/TiO2 nanocomposites obtained in 0.1 M thiolactic acid (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a shows a low FESEM image of the CdS/TiO2 sample. A typical EDS spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows that the products are composed of O, Ti, Cd and S elements. The EDS elemental mapping of Ti, O, Cd and S elements shown in Fig. 3c–f shows that Ti, O, Cd and S elements are homogenously distributed among the whole CdS/TiO2 hierarchical products, suggesting that the CdS QDs are grown homogeneously onto TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures.


Fig. 4a shows a typical TEM image of a CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposite samples prepared in 0.1 M thiolactic acid. It can be seen that the hierarchical nanostructures display a radial structure with one core section having an average size of 2 μm in diameter, and this is consistent with the results of FESEM images. Fig. 4b depicts a high magnification TEM image taken from the edge of CdS/TiO2 hierarchical nanocomposites, showing that the CdS QDs are distributed among the nanoflakes of the hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures to form the heterojunction between TiO2 and CdS. Fig. 4c is a typical electron diffraction pattern from the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical nanocomposites; the diffraction rings correspond to the (101), (112), (200), (222), (400) planes of anatase TiO2 and the (222) and (400) planes of CdS, respectively. Fig. 4d demonstrates a HRTEM lattice image of a single nanoflake of hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures. The marked d-spacings of 0.24 nm and 0.23 nm correspond well to that of the (112) and (013) planes of anatase TiO2. Fig. 4e is a HRTEM lattice image showing a TiO2 nanoflake and CdS nanocrystals; the marked d-spacings of 0.35 nm and 0.33 nm are in agreement with those of the (101) plane of TiO2 and the (200) plane of CdS. Fig. 4f illustrates the HRTEM lattice image of a CdS particle and a TiO2 nanoflake; the marked d-spacings of 0.23 nm and 0.33 nm correspond well with those the (112) plane of TiO2 and the (200) plane of CdS.


The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves by the BJH method of the TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 samples prepared in different concentrations of thiolactic acid, (a) 0.1 M, (b) 0.3 M and (c) 0.6 M, at 77 K are shown in Fig. 5. The TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 samples display IV isotherms (based on IUPAC classification) and exhibit the typical H1 hysteresis loop. Capillary condensation occurs at a relative pressure (P/P0) ≈ 0.50–0.90, indicating a uniform mesopore diameter distribution. The textural parameters such as specific surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 samples are summarized in Table 1. The TiO2 sample displays a specific surface area of about 91.52 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.53 cm3 g−1. It is shown that the modification of CdS QDs (in different concentrations of thiolactic acid: 0.1 M, 0.3 M and 0.6 M) on TiO2 results in an increase in surface area to 110.39, 107.23 and 100.18 m2 g−1 and a decrease in pore volume to 0.46, 0.47 and 0.52 cm3 g−1, respectively. This can be confirmed by the decreased condensation step of the CdS/TiO2 samples in Fig. 5a. This is probably because the CdS QDs were dispersed inside the pores and matrices of the TiO2, resulting in an increase in available surface area as well as in nitrogen uptake. For the pore size of the CdS QD/TiO2 samples, the CdS QD modification causes a little reduction in pore size for the TiO2 sample, with the pore diameter decreasing from 18.15 nm in TiO2 to 13.26 nm in 0.1 M, 14.66 nm in 0.3 M and 15.12 nm in 0.6 M, as shown in Fig. 5b. When the concentration of thiolactic acid is 0.1 M, the adsorption isotherm of the CdS/TiO2 sample featured well-pronounced capillary condensation steps and indicated a low degree of mesopore size uniformity with a peak value of 13.26 nm. The sample has a higher BET specific surface area of 110.39 m2 g−1, which provides much favorable space for dye loading.

UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was employed to characterize the optical absorption performance of TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites. Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of pure TiO2 (Fig. 6a) and CdS/TiO2 samples prepared in different concentrations of thiolactic acid: 0.1 M (Fig. 6b), 0.3 M (Fig. 6c), and 0.6 M (Fig. 6d), respectively. It reveals that the pure TiO2 hierarchical nanostructure sample absorbs only UV light with the wavelength below 400 nm, corresponding well to the inherent bandgap energy of pure TiO2. After the growth of CdS QDs onto the hierarchical TiO2 samples, the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites display a red shift moving to the visible light region with a longer wavelength for the absorption edge. The absorption edge of the CdS-sensitized TiO2 samples is extended into the visible region. It can be seen that the absorbance peak in the visible region of CdS/TiO2 obtained in 0.1 M thiolactic acid is stronger than that of the other CdS/TiO2 heterojunction nanocomposite samples obtained in 0.3 and 0.6 M thiolactic acid. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the CdS/TiO2 obtained in 0.1 M thiolactic acid shows an obvious red-shift trend compared with that of other CdS/TiO2 samples. According to the Debye–Scherrer method for XRD analyses, the CdS QDs obtained in 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 M thiolactic acid display an average size of 7.6, 9.0, and 10.5 nm, respectively. The CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposite with an average size of 7.6 nm for CdS QDs (0.1 M thiolactic acid) shows the most enhanced ability to absorb visible-light, making it a promising material in photovoltaic devices. This is in close agreement with the following measured J–V results. It is generally considered that the Bohr radius of the CdS material is 6 nm. Although the size (7.64 nm) of the CdS QDs is smaller than the Bohr radius, the smaller size of the CdS QDs is helpful to play the role in improving charge separation and charge collection at the interface between the TiO2 and the CdS QDs. Therefore, the improved sensitization effect of the CdS QDs with smaller size can be observed by extension of the absorption range and improving the light absorbance for the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposite.


The optical properties of the TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 samples prepared were then investigated by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Fig. 7a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 samples prepared in different concentrations of thiolactic acid: (a) 0.1 M, (b) 0.3 M and (c) 0.6 M. It is shown that pure TiO2 shows a sharp absorption edge around 390 nm, which is typical of anatase titania. It is interesting to observe that the CdS/TiO2 heterostructure shows a continuous absorption in the visible range, which can be primarily ascribed to the existence of CdS QDs. Also, the absorption peak intensity becomes stronger when the concentration of thiolactic acid is 0.1 M, because the size of the synthesized CdS QDs is smaller compared with the other samples. The bandgap energy of the CdS/TiO2 samples can be confirmed roughly according to the plot in Fig. 7b, which is obtained on the basis of the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R = reflectance with the reflectance at 1000 nm set at 100%). The estimated bandgap value of the CdS/TiO2 samples prepared in different concentrations of thiolactic acid, (a) 0.1 M, (b) 0.3 M and (c) 0.6 M, corresponds approximately to the light responsibility with energy bandgaps of 2.34, 2.39 and 2.44 eV, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the transition of light responsibility from UV to visible light of the CdS/TiO2 samples can be realized by controlling the size of CdS QDs. It is obvious that the optical properties of the CdS/TiO2 samples can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of thiolactic acid.



Fig. 8 depicts a scheme of the typical components of the solar cells based on CdS QD sensitized TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures. The photovoltaic device is composed of the dye loaded photoanode and the Pt-counterelectrode assembled into a sandwich type cell and a liquid redox electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide. Fig. 9 shows a typical cross-sectional SEM image of the working electrode of the photovoltaic device, showing a thickness of 5 μm for the working electrode obtained by a spin-coated technique. For the solar cells based on the semiconductor QD sensitized TiO2, it is generally believed that the performance improves with the increase in the thickness of the CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite film. However, a larger film thickness of the working electrode may induce diminution of the open-circuit voltage, and then results in the decrease of energy conversion efficiency. The CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposite electrode with a thickness of about 5 μm is enough to absorb the dye and produce electrons and holes, and can avoid hindering the absorption of light. According to the above SEM and TEM characterization, it is shown that the CdS QDs are homogeneously grown onto the hierarchical TiO2 to form a heterojunction nanocomposite.


In order to better understand the kinetics of the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes occurring in DSSCs, the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSSCs noted above was performed under a solar simulator illumination and an open-circuit voltage. Fig. 10 demonstrates that the Nyquist plots have two semicircles with a contact series resistance (Rs) on the FTO substrate. The smaller and larger semicircles in the Nyquist plots are attributed to the charge transfer at the counterelectrode/electrolyte interface and the TiO2 (CdS/TiO2)/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The sheet resistance (Rs) of the substrate, the charge transfer resistance of the counterelectrode (R1) and the recombination resistance (R2) were analyzed by the ZSimpWin software using an equivalent circuit containing a constant phase element (CPE) and resistance (R) (Fig. 10, inset), as shown in Fig. 10. Due to the use of the same counterelectrode (Pt/FTO glass) and electrolyte, the cells based on the TiO2 and CdS/TiO2 possess similar Rs of 10.50, and R1 of 34.2 and 25.9 Ω, respectively. However, the recombination resistance (R2) of the pure TiO2 sample (71.6 Ω) is larger than that of the CdS/TiO2 sample (51.5 Ω), implying an enhanced charge transfer ability for the CdS/TiO2 sample, which is in agreement with the higher open-circuit.



Fig. 11 shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves for the solar cells measured under the illumination of 1 sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The performance parameters of the solar cells including the short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of all of the solar cells are listed in Table 1. The solar cells based on CdS QD sensitized TiO2 without dye N719 (CdS/TiO2) and N719 sensitized TiO2 (TiO2 + N719) samples display a conversion efficiency (η) of 0.73% and 0.66%, respectively. Under the co-sensitization of both the CdS QDs and N719, the performance parameters of Voc, Jsc, FF and η of the DSSCs based on the TiO2/CdS + N719 electrodes are greatly enhanced. According to structural characterization by XRD, SEM and TEM, it was shown that the size of the CdS QDs is dependent on the concentration of thiolactic acid functionalized on the surfaces of TiO2; it reveals that the CdS QDs obtained in 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 M thiolactic acid display average sizes of 7.6, 9.0, and 10.5 nm, respectively. For the performance of the solar cells, the 0.1 M TiO2/CdS + N719 electrode with the smaller size of 7.6 nm for CdS QDs shows the most improved solar cell performance, displaying the highest conversion efficiency of 3.06%, with a value of 0.82 V for Voc, a value of 6.09 mA cm−2 for Jsc and 61.22% for FF. It should be noted that the conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on the 0.1 M TiO2/CdS + N719 electrode is almost 5 times higher than that of the CdS/TiO2 and TiO2 + N719 electrodes (Table 2).

The performance of the solar cells based on the CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical nanocomposite can be comparable to related materials prepared via other methods. Zhu et al. reported microwave assisted chemical bath deposition route synthesized CdS sensitized TiO2 photoanodes for QDSSCs, showing a maximum short circuit current density of 7.20 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 1.18%. Hwang et al. fabricated CdS-sensitized solar cells by the spray pyrolysis deposition method, displaying a power conversion efficiency of up to 1.87%. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.49% was obtained for the CdS QD sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film solar cells by Wang et al. Yu et al. fabricated the CdS or/and CdSe quantum dot sensitized hierarchical TiO2 sphere (HTS) electrodes with a high power conversion efficiency of 4.81%. Li et al. successfully prepared the TiO2 film electrodes sensitized with CdS quantum dots (QDs) via the chemical bath deposition method as the photoanode of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 5.57%.
The performance improvement of the solar cells based on the CdS QD sensitized TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to the unique microstructure characteristics and the bandgap energy matching between the CdD QDs and TiO2 in the CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites.
Firstly, there forms a heterojunction between the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructure and CdS QDs, which plays an important role in effective separation of light induced electrons and holes. The energy level diagram of the CdS QD sensitized hierarchical TiO2 solar cells is shown in Fig. 12. The CdS QDs deposited on the surface of the TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures act as a light absorber. The overall photoconversion efficiency of multi-bandgap semiconductors depends on the positions of its conduction and valence bands as well as their geometrical arrangement. CdS is a type of short bandgap semiconductor (2.4 eV) with its conduction band (−0.52 V vs. NHE) more negative than that of TiO2 (−0.29 V vs. NHE) (bandgap: 3.21 eV). The matching of the band edges between CdS and TiO2 is important to form a type II heterojunction (Fig. 12). For efficient electron transfer between the semiconductor CdS QDs and TiO2, the conduction band of TiO2 is more anodic than the corresponding band of the CdS sensitizer. Under UV-vis irradiation, both semiconductors (CdS and TiO2) are excited. Under visible light irradiation, photons are captured by the CdS QDs; the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are rapidly separated to electrons and holes at the interface between the nanocrystalline TiO2 and the CdS QDs. In addition to this, more photoelectrons are generated from TiO2 by harvesting UV photons. TiO2 collects the photoelectrons from CdS and passes them through to the back contact. The holes (from both CdS and TiO2) generated in the process are transferred to the solid–liquid interface to generate protons from the solution. The CdS QDs/TiO2 heterojunction nanocomposite samples display a suitable band position for charge transfer at the interfaces upon light absorption, which could even be beneficial in utilizing a broad range of incident light.
Secondly, after the growth of CdS QDs onto the hierarchical TiO2 samples, the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites display a red shift moving to the visible light region with a longer wavelength for the absorption edge. The absorption edge of the CdS-sensitized TiO2 samples is extended into the visible region. The CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposite with an average size of 7.6 nm for CdS QDs (0.1 M thiolactic acid) shows the most enhanced ability to absorb visible-light, making it a promising material in photovoltaic devices. It is shown that the smaller size of CdS QDs is helpful to improve charge separation and collection at the interface between the TiO2 and the CdS QDs. Therefore, the sensitization effect of CdS can be observed by extending the absorption range and improving the light absorbance for the CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposites. It is in good agreement with the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves for the solar cells measured under the irradiation of 1 sun. The CdS/TiO2 hierarchical heterojunction nanocomposite with a smaller average size of 7.6 nm for CdS QDs (0.1 M thiolactic acid) shows the greatly enhanced energy conversion efficiency of 3.06%, almost 5 times higher than that of the TiO2 + N719 samples.
Thirdly, the TiO2 hierarchical structures are composed of a number of nanosheets. TiO2 with hierarchical nanostructures can adsorb a large amount of dye molecules (67.78 nmol cm−2) due to their large specific surface area (110.39 m2 g−1) and have a high light harvesting efficiency resulting from the hierarchical structure's low light scattering and reflection ratio, as well as the ability of charge separation. The synergistic effect of these factors contributes to the superior photovoltaic properties.
Finally, the fourth reason is that the Ru-complex dye acts like an electron-blocking layer and helps reduce the carrier recombination occurring between TiO2 and the electrolyte in the solar cells, even in the event of dye aggregation. On the contrary, the recombination process at the CdS–electrolyte junction in CdS-SSCs might be a potentially serious pathway, because of the significant differences between the dyes in terms of surface bonding states, electronic configurations, conductivities, electron mobilities, and electron-blocking characteristics to prevent back electron transfer between CdS and electrolytes.

CdS QD modified anatase TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures are achieved using thiolactic acid as an organic linker, and the sizes of the CdS QDs can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of thiolactic acid linkers. We have fabricated a semiconductor heterojunction between the CdS QDs and anatase TiO2. The matching of band edges between CdS and TiO2 to form a semiconductor heterojunction plays an important role in effective separation of light induced electrons and holes, providing a promising photoanode for its wide absorption spectrum, high electron injection efficiency, and fast electron transference. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the as-synthesized CdS QD modified anatase TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures show a high short-circuit current density of 6.09 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency of 3.06% under one sun illumination. The performance improvement of the solar cells based on CdS QDs/TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to the unique microstructure characteristics and the bandgap energy matching between the CdS QDs and TiO2.
