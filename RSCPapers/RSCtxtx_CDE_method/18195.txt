In this investigation, the substitution reaction of octachlorocyclotetraphosphazene, N4P4Cl8 (tetramer, OCCP, 1), with sodium 3-(N-ferrocenylmethylamino)-1-propanoxide (L1) was found to yield the compounds, 2,4-ansa-(2) and spiro-(2) cyclotetraphosphazene derivatives. The starting hexachloro-2-cis-4-dichloro-monoferrocenyl-ansa-(N/O)cyclotetraphosphazene (2) reacted separately with dipotassium salts of N2O2 donor-type aminopodands, (KOPhCH2NH)2R [R = (CH2)n, n = 2 (L2) and n = 3 (L3)], to produce mono-ferrocenyl-2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes (dias; 3 and 4). Both products were purified by column chromatography, and their structures were confirmed using ESI-MS, FTIR, 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectral data. Besides, the molecular and crystal structures of 4 were elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 4 has four-different chiral P-centers. However, the absolute configuration of stereogenic P-centres of an enantiomer was designated as SS′S′′R′′′. Both new compounds were also used for the examination of optical and electrochemical properties, and survey of bioactivity. To this end, the minimum inhibitory, bactericidal, and fungicidal concentrations (MIC, MBC, and MFC) were determined with the microdilution technique. These MIC, MBC, and MFC values were found to vary between 2500 μM and 312.5 μM. DNA cleavage activities of 3 and 4 with pBR322 plasmid DNA were also studied using electrophoretic mobility on an agarose gel. BamHI and HindIII restriction enzyme digestions of compound-pBR322 plasmid DNA were conducted to supply more insight into changes in DNA conformation. Cyclotetraphosphazene 4 caused DNA cleavage activity even at the lowest concentration. In addition to that, compound 4 inhibited enzyme digestion, indicating that DNA binds to A/A nucleotides with DNA binding activity. Moreover, the cytotoxicities of 3 and 4 were investigated by MTT assay against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and COS-1 mammalian fibroblast cells. On the other hand, the optical and electrochemical properties of dias 3 and 4 were studied using UV-vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry techniques. As a result, both compounds can be suggested as ferrocene-based charge transformable phosphazene structures that can be used as new generation and synergistic DSSC materials.

Cyclophosphazenes, (NPX2)n, are important hybrid molecules of inorganic heterocyclic ring frameworks composed of an organized and homologous array in fundamental and applied science. The best-known chlorocyclophosphazenes, N3P3Cl6 (trimer, HCCP) and N4P4Cl8 (tetramer, OCCP, 1), have been extensively explored in the area of phosphazene chemistry. HCCP and OCCP also serve as the starting reagents for the rich and exciting chemistry of phosphazenes. Although there is a considerably large number of trimeric and tetrameric cyclophosphazene derivatives prepared with mono and bidentate ligands, cyclophosphazene derivatives obtained as a result of displacement reactions of these chlorophosphazenes with polydentate ligands are very rare in the literature. Yet, the reactions of OCCP are much less studied than those of HCCP. Depending on the reaction conditions, reactions of OCCP with difunctional and/or polyfunctional reagents can produce spiro, ansa, bino, spiro-ansa (2,4- and 2,6-), dispiro (2,4- and 2,6-), spiro-bino, trispiro, tetraspiro, spiro-ansa-spiro (sas) and ansa-spiro-ansa (asa) derivatives under the reaction conditions. Accordingly, partially or fully substituted products can also be obtained. In addition, these products also have geometrical (gem/non-gem cis/trans, spiro/ansa and/or sas/asa) and optical isomers and are quite difficult to isolate purely.

Recently, the chiral features of cyclophosphazene derivatives have been discovered as an interesting topic, and continue to be scrutinized as an attractive research area. Nowadays, the stereogenic properties of cyclophosphazenes are examined using circular dichroism (CD), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), X-ray crystallography, and 31P NMR spectra recorded in the presence of (R)-(+)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(9′-anthryl)-ethanol (CSA). Among these techniques, X-ray crystallography is the most reliable and powerful method as it clearly reveals the absolute configuration of chiral isomers.
In the literature, there are a large number of investigations examining the spectral, crystallographic and biological properties of cyclophosphazenes and their applications in various areas. Many cyclophosphazene derivatives are proposed to be utilized as fluorescent indicators, protic ionic liquids (PILs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), antitubercular, antimicrobial and anticancer agents and biodegradable hydrogels. Besides, some of the ferrocene derivatives are stated to be employed as photoluminescent and drug delivery systems sensitive to redox-stimuli, organometallic catalysts, anti-infective, anticancer, and antitubercular agents. However, some partly/fully substituted ferrocenylcyclophosphazenes have also exhibited the antitubercular, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities against reference strains, cancer cells, and microorganisms, respectively.
On the other hand, compounds possessing ferrocene groups can be viewed as suitable candidates for electron-transfer mediators, internal electrodes for redox-active materials, benign one-electron oxidation chemistry and consequent access to the properties of oxidized species. The outputs of this research are multidisciplinary and include material science, sensing and biomedical applications. A review of the literature indicates that there are no reports on the reactions of ansa-cyclotetraphosphazenes with N2O2 donor-type tetrafunctional reagents.
The goal of this current paper is to synthesize the novel mono-ferrocenyl-2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes (diansaspiro, dias; 3 and 4) for the determinations of their spectral, crystallographic, and stereogenic properties and also for the explorations of their electrochemical and optical features beside their biological activities. Furthermore, this study provides an insight into how and to what extent the electrochemical and optical properties of ferrocene can be altered by incorporating donor-type aminopodands into cyclotetraphosphazene rings (Scheme 1).

The Cl replacement reactions of chlorocyclotetraphosphazenes were realized under an argon atmosphere. These reactions were monitored using TLC (thin-layer chromatography) on Merck DC Alufolien Kiesegel 60 B254 sheets, and column chromatography was performed on Merck Kiesegel 60 (230–400 mesh ATSM) silica gel in an appropriate solvent, toluene–THF. The melting points were detected with Gallenkamp apparatus using a capillary tube. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were evaluated on a Jasco FTIR-430 spectrometer in KBr discs, and the spectra were saved in cm−1 units. Furthermore, 1H, 13C{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR spectra of the cyclophosphazenes were monitored on a Bruker DPX FT-NMR spectrometer, operating at 400.174, 100.624 and 242.925 MHz. The NMR spectrometer was equipped with a 5 mm PABBO BB inverse gradient probe, and a standard Bruker pulse program was employed. Electron spray ionization-mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded on the AGILENT 1100 MSD. Microanalyses were carried out by the microanalytical service of Ankara University (FTIR, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, ESI-MS) and İnönü University (31P{1H} NMR). 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 3 and 4 were displayed in Fig. 2a and 3a and were simulated using the software MestReNova 6.0.2-5475 (MestreLab Research SL, 2009).

On the other hand, the antimicrobial properties of both mono-ferrocenyl-2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirophosphazenes (3 and 4) were shown to display certain antibacterial and antifungal effects against some bacterial and fungal species. Thus, the antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility tests were performed with the BACTEC MGIT 960 (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) system using the agar diffusion method, and the experimental details are presented in Section S1 (S designates ESI). The interactions of 3 and 4 with plasmid DNA were scrutinized using agarose gel electrophoresis for the evaluation of DNA cleavage (Section S2, ESI). The affinity determination between both products and the guanine–guanine (G/G) and/or adenine–adenine (A/A) regions was evaluated using the restriction endonuclease analysis (Section S3, ESI). The cytotoxic activities of 3 and 4 were studied using MTT assay against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and COS-1 mammalian fibroblast cells (Section S4, ESI).

The reaction solvent, THF, was dried over Na(k) and purified. The starting reagents, N4P4Cl8 (Otsuka Chemical Co. Ltd), ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Aldrich), 3-amino-1-propanol (Fluka), salicylaldehyde (Fluka) and aliphatic amines (Fluka) were procured.


3-(N-Ferrocenylmethylamino)-1-propanol was synthesized according to the methods reported in the literature, and the sodium salt, sodium 3-(N-ferrocenylmethylamino)-1-propanoxide (L1), was prepared with NaH. The starting phosphazene, 2,4-ansa (2) was obtained from the reaction of N4P4Cl8 (1) with an equimolar amount of L1 in dry THF by following the methods in the reported articles. 2,2′-[1,2-Ethanediylbis(iminomethanediyl)]diphenol and 2,2′-[1,3-propanediylbis(iminomethanediyl)]diphenol were prepared in accordance with the reported procedure.


K2CO3 (0.88 g, 6.37 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 2,2′-[1,2-ethanediylbis(iminomethanediyl)]diphenol (0.16 g, 0.59 mmol) in dry THF (100 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 5 h and cooled to ambient temperature. After that, a mixture of triethylamine (0.46 mL, 3.35 mmol) and 2,4-ansa (2) (0.37 g, 0.56 mmol) in dry THF (100 mL) was added dropwise to the stirred solution of L2 at −10 °C for over 6 h. After the mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature, it was stirred for 30 h under Ar. The precipitated amine hydrochloride and excess K2CO3 were filtered off, and the solvent was evaporated completely. The product asa 3 was purified by column chromatography with toluene:THF (20:1), and it was crystallized from toluene. Yield: 0.16 g (35%). mp: 122 °C.

The orange-coloured suitable crystals of 4 were crystallized from toluene at room temperature. The crystallographic details are tabulated in Table 1, and the chosen bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. Crystallographic data were monitored on a Bruker Kappa APEXII CCD area-detector diffractometer by Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at T = 172(2) K. Absorption correction by multi-scan was applied. The structure of 4 was solved by direct methods (SHELXS97) and refined by full-matrix least-squares against F2 (SHELXS97) using all data. All non-H atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydroxy H atom was located in a different Fourier map and refined freely. The remaining H atom positions were calculated geometrically at distances of 0.93 Å (for aromatic CH) and 0.97 Å (for CH2) from the parent C atoms; a riding model was used during the refinement process and the Uiso(H) values were constrained to be 1.2Ueq (carrier atom). Hydrogen-bond geometry and selected interatomic distances of 4 are given in Table 3.

Cyclic voltammogram experiments were carried out with a Gamry Reference 3000 electrochemical analyzer with a C3 stand including a three-electrode system. Three electrode cells used a glassy carbon working electrode, platinum auxiliary electrode, and Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in acetonitrile (MeCN) solution using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrode at room temperature.


TiO2 nanoparticle decorated Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass photoanode and platinum-coated glass cathode (from Solaronix) were used for the fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) structure. The electrodes were sintered for 30 min at 450 °C to remove contamination from the surfaces before use. Two different diansa-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazene-based DSSC were developed. To do this, the photoanodes were immersed in dispersion solutions of compounds 3, 4 and hybrid (equimolar mixture of 3 and 4) and left for 24 h. Photoanodes coated with ferrocenyl phosphazene were then washed with ethanol and dried with a heat gun. An iodide/tri-iodide in a nitrile solvent-based redox electrolyte was injected into the rear side of the counter electrode. Photovoltaic measurements of the solar cells were carried out with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator with an AM 1.5 global filter and a light intensity of 1 kW m−2.


The Cl substitution reaction of OCPP (1) with an equimolar amount of sodium 3-(N-ferrocenylmethylamino)-1-propanoxide (L1) yielded two types of product; namely, hexachloromono-ferrocenyl-2-cis-4-dichloro-ansa-(N/O) (2,4-ansa; 2) and hexachloromono-ferrocenyl-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazenes (spiro; 2) (Scheme 1). Of these two compounds, 2,4-ansa phosphazene (2) is the first example of mono-ferrocenyl-2,4-ansa(N/O)cyclotetraphosphazenes. Therefore, this compound was chosen as the starting reagent in this research. On the other hand, N2O2 donor-type aminopodands [(HOPhCH2NH)2R, (R = (CH2)n, n = 2, 3] were synthesized by reduction of iminopodands with NaBH4. Reactions of 2,4-ansa (2) with an excess amount of the dipotassium salts, [(KOPhCH2NH)2R (R = (CH2)n, n = 2 (L2) and n = 3 (L3)], yielded mono-ferrocenyl-2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes (dias; 3 and 4) in dry THF, respectively. Both compounds are the first examples of ansa-cyclotetraphosphazenes with bulky N2O2 donor-type aminopodands. In each compound, N2O2 tetradentate ligands bind to 2,4-ansa (2) as tridentate ligands at the 6,8-ansa-spiro position, since the tetradentate ligand is replaced by three Cl atoms in 2,4-ansa (2) (Scheme 1). Products similar to these two bicyclo structures appear as bicyclo-2,6-as and bicyclo-2,6-sas cyclotetraphosphazene derivatives prepared with spermidine and spermine, respectively, as reported in the literature. A bicyclo-2,6-as product was also obtained from the reaction of OCCP and a similar N2O2 donor-type aminopodand with a longer alkyl chain [R = (CH2)4] by our group. As a result, these three cis Cl atoms in dias structures were found to be quite robust for substitution reactions. The expected fully substituted products were not able to be synthesized by microwave-assisted experiments in THF, toluene, or o-xylene.

On the other hand, it should be noted herein that the selection of both the 2,4-ansa (2) and dipotassium salts of the N2O2 donor-type aminopodands (L2 and L3) is crucial for achieving stereochemically controlled reactions. In other words, this selection facilitates the configuration of tetrahedral P atoms to form controlled stereogenic P centers. There are two different stereogenic P centers in 2,4-ansa (2), and since two Cl atoms are bonded in the cis position, only one racemic mixture (RR′/SS′) is expected to form (Fig. 1). In this compound, the four Cl atoms are diastereotopic and two unsubstituted PCl2 phosphorus atoms are also prochiral centers with respect to Fig. 1. Table 4 and Fig. 1 visualize the theoretical stereoisomer distributions, together with the expected and isolated chiral isomers of 2,4-ansa (2) and 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro (dias; 3 and 4). Cyclotetraphosphazenes, 3 and 4, have four different chiral P-atoms. Therefore, sixteen optical isomers may arise from four different stereogenic P centers. However, since two Cl atoms in 2,4-ansa (2) are cis-bonded, the optical isomer number of each of compounds 3 and 4 drops to eight and is expected to occur as four racemic mixtures (RR′R′′S′′′/SS′S′′R′′′, RR′R′′R′′′/SS′S′′S′′′, RR′S′′R′′′/SS′R′′S′′′ and RR′S′′S′′′/SS′R′′R′′′). That is, these compounds are in the form of diastereomeric mixtures (Table 4). Moreover, the molecular and solid-state structures of the selected single crystal of 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro (4) were verified using X-ray crystallography. The absolute configuration of stereogenic P-centres of an enantiomer was determined as SS′S′′R′′′.

Data provided from the microanalyses, FTIR, ESI-MS, and 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR very clearly confirm the proposed structures of 3 and 4. The ESI-MS spectra of both compounds also display [M]+ ion peaks. The crystal structure of 4 was characterized by the X-ray diffraction method. To our knowledge, there are no reports of 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes that have been structurally confirmed using spectroscopic and/or X-ray crystallography techniques. The spectral and crystallographic findings of 3 and 4 are discussed in detail in the following.

The 31P NMR data for 3 and 4 are tabulated in Table 5 together with the 31P data of the starting tetrameric phosphazene (2) utilized for comparison purposes. As expected, the 31P{1H} NMR spectra of dias 3 and 4 derivatives displayed the AMXY and ABXY type spectra consisting of four quartets, respectively, due to the four different phosphorus environments within the molecules (Fig. 1). The simulated and experimental 31P NMR spectra of 3 and 4 are pictured in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively, and their δ P chemical shifts and 2JPP coupling constant values of these compounds were clearly interpreted (Table 5). The δ P shifts of dias 3 and 4 are higher than the initial phosphazene, 2,4-ansa (2) (Table 5). All δ P shifts, PA, PB(M), PX, and PY, were plotted and marked on the spectra. Besides, the 2JPP data of both phosphazenes were calculated via simulated spectra (Fig. 2b and 3b).

Due to the presence of four chiral centers in the 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes (3 and 4), it can be assumed that diastereomers are formed, which should give rise to distinguishable NMR signals. However, with respect to 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectral data in CDCl3, only one set of diastereoisomers was determined to be separated by column chromatography (Fig. 3 and Table 5).
The proton and carbon enumerations of 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro tetrameric phosphazenes (3 and 4) are presented in Scheme 1. The 13C and 1H NMR values of both products are given in the “Experimental part”. The 2JN of the Fc–CH2–N–H2 carbons in the six-membered N/O spiro rings of 3 and 4 did not appear as in the starting phosphazene, 2,4-ansa (2). However, for the O–CH2–H2 carbons in the same spiro rings, the 3JOC values of 3 and 4 were found to be 2.8 and 2.4 Hz, respectively, and this value was calculated to be 4.5 Hz for 2. The 2JO data of the O–H2 carbons of both compounds was found to be 6.1 Hz. The 2JN values of the N–H2 and N–′H2 carbons of 3 were calculated to be 13.8 and 14.6 Hz, respectively, whilst the corresponding value for 4 is 5.3 Hz. In addition, carbon peaks (C1–C4) of ferrocene rings and the aromatic carbon (C1–C6; ) signals from aminopodands attached to the structure were designated from the 13C NMR spectra of dias 3 and 4 derivatives. One of the most important pieces of evidence that the Cl atoms of the starting ansa derivative (2) are replaced by aminopodands is that the carbon signals of the N2O2 donor-type aminopodand groups emerged in the 13C NMR spectra of both compounds. The average 3JNC values of the aromatic  carbon signals of 3 and 4 were found to be 7.1 Hz, whereas the average 2JN values of the aromatic C6 carbons were found to be 10.7 Hz. Moreover, the average 4JNCC values of aromatic  and  carbons of 3 and 4 were calculated to be 2.9 and 3.9 Hz, respectively. In ferrocene rings, the ipso-C1 carbons of both compounds were determined to be 83.55 ppm (for 3) and 82.95 ppm (for 4), and the average 3JNC value between ipso-C1 atoms of the ferrocene rings and P atoms was estimated to be 7.7 Hz. These findings are appropriate with literature data of cyclotetraphosphazene derivatives containing N2O2 donor-type aminopodand and ferrocenyl pendant arm(s).
The 1H NMR spectra of dias 3 and 4 appear very complex as all aliphatic protons are diastereotopic. However, the existing diastereotopic benzylic Ar-C2 and  protons are separated from each other and they can undoubtedly be distinguished as doublets of the doublet. These benzylic protons have an ABX spin system due to the geminal proton–proton and vicinal coupling with the P-31 nucleus for both compounds. The average 2JC and 3JNC values 3 and 4 with ABX spin systems, were calculated to be 11.3 and 14.2 Hz, and 11.8 and 14.2 Hz, respectively. Likewise, even the 4JNCC values of aromatic  and  carbons of 3 and 4 could be calculated to be 2.9 and 3.9 Hz, respectively. As expected, proton peaks of ferrocene rings (H2–H4) and aromatic (H2–H5; ) proton signals from aminopodands bonded to 3 and 4 were interpreted from the 1H NMR spectra of both dias derivatives. Furthermore, Fc–C2 (H5) proton signals were seen in pairs at 3.82 ppm (for 3) and 3.89 ppm (for 4) as doublets, and 3JNC data were calculated as 14.8 and 15.2 Hz, respectively. Wide peaks of Ar-OH protons of 3 and 4 are observed at 7.53 and 7.94 ppm, respectively, indicating that they form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Finally, it was observed that these results for cyclotetraphosphazene derivatives containing N2O2 donor-type aminopodand and ferrocenyl pendant arm(s) are in good agreement with the literature data.
The characteristic FTIR absorption frequencies of dias derivatives (3 and 4) are presented in the “Experimental part”. In 3 and 4, the absence of νN–H vibrational bands, observed at 3276 and 3289 cm−1 for the two aminopodands, indicates the binding to P atoms. In addition, the characteristic broad νO–H bands are evidence of the hydrogen bonding of 3271 cm−1 (for 3) and 3325 cm−1 (for 4). Strong-intensity asymmetric and symmetric νPN stretching bands of 3 and 4 are attributed to the P4N4 ring and are observed at 1254 and 1164 cm−1, and 1287 and 1176 cm−1, respectively. Additionally, the νPCl stretching frequencies are determined at 600 cm−1 (for 3) and 573 cm−1 (for 4).

The molecular structure of compound 4 is shown in Fig. 4 along with the atom-numbering scheme. The single-crystal structure analysis of 4 supports the results provided from the spectroscopic findings. Initially phosphazene (2) is in the ansa structure with Cl atoms bonded to P2 and P4 phosphorus atoms in a cis fashion. According to the structural analyses of 4, it was determined that the tetradentate ligand (L3) is bonded to the P6 and P8 phosphorus atoms in a 6,8-ansa-spiro (6,8-as) fashion, and thus the entire structure is in 2-cis-4-dichloro-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro (dias) configuration.

The eight-membered non-planar cyclic N4P4 phosphazene ring is in the boat conformation [Fig. S1a, ESI; the puckering parameters, QT, 1.159(1) Å, φ2 = 90.2(2)°, θ2 = 83.5(7)°]. However, the eight-membered 2,4-ansa ring (P1/P2/N2/N5/O1/C1/C2/C3) is in sofa conformation [Fig. S1b, ESI;QT = 2.725(4) Å, φ2 = −58.0(9)°, θ2 = 45.6(6)°]. The bicyclic system (Fig. S1c and d, ESI) consists of the eight-membered 6,8-ansa (P3/P4/N4/N7/O3/C25/C26/C31) and the six-membered spiro (P3/N6/N7/C22/C23/C24) rings fused by a common PNP fragment, where the 6,8-ansa and spiro rings are in twisted conformations [Fig. S1c, ESI;QT = 2.764(4) Å, φ2 = 122.6(7)°, θ2 = 22.5(5)° and Fig. S1d, ESI;QT = 1.085(4) Å, φ2 = 145.1(2)°, θ2 = 56.9(8)°]. On the other hand, the conformation of the macrocyclic tetrameric N4P4 phosphazene ring of 4 was visualized using torsional angles, highlighting that the ring is pseudo-centrosymmetric (Fig. S2, ESI). Also, the absolute configuration of stereogenic P-centers of an enantiomer of 4 was found to be SS′S′′R′′ based on X-ray crystallographic data. The space group of 4 was detected to be P. This space group has an inversion symmetry operation with the inversion center, and therefore does not include the Sohncke space groups. As expected, dias 4 is a stereogenic compound and can be considered as a racemate. In other words, the racemic structures crystallize in a space group with an inversion center, which means that the crystal structure of a chiral compound has equal amounts of both enantiomers present in the crystal lattice. Therefore, since dias 4 crystallizes in the P space group, both the SS′S′′R′′′ and RR′R′′S′′′ enantiomers must be present together in equal amounts in the unit cell. However, as previously observed in some phosphazene architectures, the enantiomers have been found to be crystallized spontaneously from the racemic mixtures in some bulky substituted chiral compounds.
On the other hand, in dias4, the sums of the bond angles around N5, N6 and N7 atoms [358.59(11), 348.16(11) and 353.49(12)°] indicate a change in the hybridization of N atoms from pyramidal toward trigonal planar. For molecules with rings of N atoms at the bridgehead, pyramidal inversion is avoided. In a compound with N atoms in the spiro and ansa rings, there may be limited rotation around the P–N and C–N single bonds. This leads to atropisomerism, a stereochemical phenomenon that results from the restriction of rotation around a single bond in isolable stereoisomers. As expected, dias3 is also a molecule similar to 4 and can have atropisomers as well.
Moreover, according to Table 2, in the macrocyclic N4P4 ring of 4, the endocyclic P–N bond lengths are in the range of 1.5648(14)–1.5957(13) Å, while exocyclic P–N bond lengths are in the range of 1.6346(13) to 1.6540(13) Å. It was found that the average value of the endocyclic P–N bond lengths was found to be 1.5769(13) Å, which is shorter than the average exocyclic P–N bond length of 1.6454(13) Å. The found values are consistent with the single/double bond characters of the exocyclic and endocyclic P–N bonds reported in the literature.
Additionally, in the macrocyclic tetramer ring of 4, the variations of the endocyclic P–N–P bond angles are spread between 122.88(8)–134.42(9)° implying that these values are noticeably outspread. It was calculated that the average value is 129.89(9)°. On the other hand, the endocyclic N–P–N bond angles were found to be in the range of 116.33(7)–124.26(7)° (Table 2) with an average value of 120.64(7)°. Variations of the endocyclic P–N–P and N–P–N bond angles of 4 might reflect the steric hindrance of ferrocenyl-pendant arms and N2O2 donor-type bulky side groups in general. These variations can also be ascribed to negative hyperconjugation and the charges of the substituent-dependence at P centres. The same variations of endocyclic bond lengths and angles in the mono/bis-pendant armed cyclotetraphosphazenes have also been reported in recent years.
The intramolecular O–H⋯N hydrogen bond (Table 3a) links the acidic OH hydrogen and N4 donor atom (Fig. 4).
In the crystal structure, the intermolecular C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds (Table 3a) connect the molecules in endless chains in the b-axis direction (Fig. S3, ESI). On the other hand, the close contacts are defined as less than the sum of the van der Waals radii (Table 3b), π⋯π interactions between the adjacent rings Cg1⋯Cg2i with the centroid–centroid distance of 3.2870(12) Å and dihedral angle (α) of 0.92°, [where Cg1 and Cg2 are the centroids of (C5–C9) and (C10–C14) rings, respectively, symmetry code (i): 1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z] and a C–H⋯ π interaction (Table 3) may also be very effective in the stabilization of the structure.

The electrochemical properties of mono-ferrocenyl-2-cis-4-dichloro-ansa- and spiro-cyclotetraphosphazenes and their amino, diamino and dialkoxy derivatives have been investigated recently. The purpose of organometallic electrochemistry is to investigate interactions between potential redox centers. Generally, redox-active ferrocenyl-phosphazenes refer to compounds with directly bonded ferrocene groups or ferrocene-containing side chains. Ferrocenyl-phosphazene derivatives also continue to receive significant attention as potent biological agents. Hence, in this study, to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of mono-ferrocenyl-2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes (3 and 4), cyclic voltammograms of the compounds were performed in acetonitrile solution using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrode. Ferrocene was used as a standard in the investigation of the redox potentials and electrochemical reversibility of the compounds. In Fig. 5, cyclic voltammetry measurements for dias (3 and 4) showed a similar reversible one-electron oxidation wave corresponding to the redox-responsible moiety of the ferrocenyl (Fc) group. On the other hand, when the 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro phosphazene moiety is compared with standard ferrocene, it is seen that the geometry of these compounds exhibits discernible effects on peak current, peak potential and peak separation values. The reduction potential for compounds 3 and 4 was observed at 0.488 V and 0.535 V, respectively, compared to standard ferrocene at 0.403 V without affecting electrochemical reversibility. Similarly, the oxidation potential of 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirophosphazenes was determined to be significantly increased; that is, 0.571 V (for 3) and 0.609 V (for 4). However, the electrochemical properties of 3 are different from those of 4. The small oxidation potential of 3 compared to 4 may be due to the five- and six-membered spiro rings in these compounds, respectively. In a similar electron acceptor, the reduction potential of 3 was observed at the smaller cathodic potential compared to that of 4. The measured redox potentials, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and bandgap energies are given in Table 6.

The energies of the HOMO levels were calculated using the electrochemical oxidation potential (Eox), while the energies of the LUMO levels were calculated using the values of the optical band gaps using Tauc plots. The HOMO level via the oxidation potential was found at 0.57 V and 0.61 V for 3 and 4, respectively. This means that the HOMO energy levels of the two compounds are −5.37 eV and −5.41 eV, and they have essentially different electron-donating abilities. Conversely, the LUMO levels of 3 and 4 extend over the electron acceptor part as well as over the entire molecule. As a result, the elongation of the spacer (N^N) is less in the acceptor in compound 3 than in the compound 4 acceptor due to the closer electron-donating group, adversely affecting its electron-withdrawing ability.
Diffusion coefficients of ferrocenyl-phosphazenes were determined by cyclic voltammogram with different scanning rates (Fig. 6). As seen in Fig. 6, the cyclic voltammograms of 3 and 4 show broad, reversible oxidation and reduction waves. The peak-to-peak separation between the corresponding cathodic and anodic peaks shifts downward with increasing scanning rate, indicating the difference in faradaic current value. This parameter is particularly important for electrochemical applications where mass transfer limitation can control the overall cell kinetics, such as in dye-sensitized solar cells. Experimental diffusion coefficient values were calculated by the Randles–Sevcik equation and were found as 3.86 × 10−5 and 5.63 × 10−5 m2 s−1 for compounds 3 and 4, respectively.
In Fig. 7, the oxidation and reduction peak currents increase linearly with the square root at different scanning rates for compounds 3 and 4. At the same time, the values vary between 0.571–0.582 V (for 3) and 0.609–0.620 V (for 4) at a scanning rate other than 50–500 mV s−1. The elongation substituent (N^N) is affected by the oxidation potential values, but the effect is negligibly small.
The optical properties of the ferrocenyl-phosphazenes reported in this study were investigated in acetonitrile. Fig. 5B shows the absorption bands at 583 and 596 nm for 3 and 4, respectively. Both ferrocenyl-phosphazenes exhibit a large transition in the visible range corresponding to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer characters. Remarkably, the maximum absorption wavelength of 4 is red-shifted compared to 3. This result shows that with the lengthening of the N^N unit in the spiro-ring of 4, this band red-shifts and its intensity increases. Perhaps further elongation of the N^N unit may even cause the π–π* transition of the Cp-ring to be further red-shifted by the contribution of the ligand. In addition, the band located in the visible range at ∼440 nm for complexes is attributed to a forbidden d–d transition localized on the ferrous metal center.
The HOMO energy levels of 3 and 4 were found to be −5.37 eV and −5.41 eV. The band gaps of 3 and 4 were calculated as −2.13 eV and −2.08 eV, and accordingly, the LUMO energy levels were determined to be −3.24 eV and −3.33 eV, respectively. This is the effect of increasing elongation of the spacer N^N of 4 relative to 3 attached to the 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro phosphazene moiety. This causes a greater energy shift in the ligand-based LUMO than in the metal-based HOMO.
In recent years, organometallic complexes have also received great attention in resistive memory switching. Organometallic molecules containing ferrocene are characteristic materials that have robust electrochemical properties and have been utilized in many applications including memory devices. The redox character of the Fe center between ferrocene (Fe2+) and ferrocenium (Fe3+) can significantly alter the electrical conductivity, thus resulting in a flash-type resistive memory property. For this reason, the double-step chronoamperometry technique was used to monitor changes in memory responses during the electrochemical switching between reduction and oxidation states with a residence time of 1 s. Fig. 8 shows the memory function of the device based on 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazene derivatives by evaluating the behavior of charge flows. It has been observed that the current input and output from 2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spiro phosphazene films have a low response time (a few seconds) and high stability during memory switching. The oxidation and reduction response times for 3 and 4 were 0.30–0.42 s and 0.34–0.48 s, respectively. It is clear that the difference between HOMO and LUMO energies effectively reduces the response time. With a low energy voltage of 0.4 to 0.6 V, this device is expected to have great advantages over other organic-based memory materials.


Fig. 9A shows the J–V characteristics of DSSCs sensitized with two diansa-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazenes and their hybrid mix compound. To explain, the parameters acquired from the current–voltage characteristics are open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η). Photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 7. The ferrocene center is responsible for photon absorption, while the constitution of electron–hole pairs occurs at the TiO2/diansa-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazene interfaces. The highest power conversion efficiency was calculated for the cell obtained with a mixed sample H. The mixture of two diansa-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazene units in H resulted in better photovoltaic performance with the iodide/triiodide redox couple than compound 3: Jsc from 0.79 mA cm−2 to 0.94 mA cm−2 and η from 0.19% to 0.32%. The η value of H is more than double compared to compounds 3 and 4. This can be attributed to the coating of high amounts of ferrocene groups in the thin film by immobilizing the mixed sample and the presence of a compound containing the diansa-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazene ring as an electron acceptor.

Photocurrent–time profiles were examined to grasp the sustainability of the initial photocurrent observed upon irradiation of the semiconductor electrode. For such a finding, the time-dependent reaction of the dye-coated electrode to visible light was determined in terms of short-circuit photocurrent of the cell and the results are exhibited in Fig. 9B. Both cells constructed with compounds 3 and 4 showed a stable photocurrent. In addition, almost no degradation of the photocurrent of 3 and 4 with multistate energy harvesting devices was observed.

The results given in Table 8 indicate that the MIC values varied from 2500 μM to 312.5 μM for both compounds, respectively. Compounds 3 and 4 showed various degrees of inhibition against eleven bacterial and three fungal strains using the microdilution method. The lowest MIC values obtained with 3 in E. hirae bacterial strains and some yeast strains were recorded as 312.5 μM. Moreover, the lowest MIC values (312.5 μM) of 4 were obtained against C. krusei and C. tropicalis yeast strains. The bacterial strain of P. aeruginosa was found to be most susceptive to both compounds with MICs of 625 μM and its growth was determined to be completely inhibited by both compounds with 2500 μM. The yeast strain of C. albicans was observed to be the most susceptible to compound 3 with MICs of 312.5 μM. Also, the MIC value of 312.5 μM obtained with 3 exhibited good potency for C. albicans as the reference antibiotic ketoconazole. The P. aeuruginosa bacterial strains were found to be the most susceptive to both compounds, with MICs of 625 μM. The P. aeuruginosa bacterial strain exhibited 4 times greater susceptibility to 3 and 4versus reference antibiotics (Table 8).

Minimum bactericidal and fungicidal effects were exhibited in both compounds to various degrees (Table 9). These effects were also investigated on the same eleven bacteria and three fungal microorganisms. Compounds 3 and 4 had bactericidal effects against E. coli ATCC 35218, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and P. vulgaris (2500 μM) (Fig. S4, ESI). Also, 3 (1250 μM) and 4 (2500 μM) had bactericidal potency for E. hirae (Fig. S4, ESI). The lowest MFC value (312.5 μM) with 3 to C. albicans and C. tropicalis was observed, so 3 showed better fungicidal potency toward reference antibiotics against these fungal microorganisms.

Furthermore, when the antimicrobial activities of similar compounds were investigated in the literature for comparison, a tetrapyrrolidino-2,6-sas derivative was found to have excellent antifungal activity against the fungal pathogen Candida krusei (MIC value of 39 μM) and Candida albicans (MIC value of 78 μM).

At this part of the research, DNA-compound interaction studies aim to determine the DNA binding and cleavage activities of compounds. The ability of each compound to unwind the supercoiled conformation of pBR322 was determined by electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels. The findings show conformational changes resulting from compound-DNA interactions. DNA cleavage was determined by unwinding the supercoiled circular Form I of the plasmid DNA to linear Form III. If supercoiled circular plasmid DNA is subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, the fastest migration will be observed for supercoiled Form I DNA. If a strand breaks, the supercoils will unwind to produce a slower-moving open circular Form II DNA. If both strands are cleaved, linear Form III DNA is formed, which migrates between Form I and Form II. Plasmid DNA interacted with decreasing concentrations of 3 and 4 (Fig. 10). In the electrophoretogram, the untreated plasmid DNA used as a control displays the major supercoiled Form I and minor singly nicked relaxed circular Form II bands. In addition to supercoiled and open circular DNA Forms I and II, linear Form III DNA was observed at lower concentrations of 3 and 4, indicating changes in DNA conformation. These results show that the compounds cleave DNA in both strands. In addition, the presence of no supercoiled plasmid DNA and linear DNA (Form III) bands at the highest concentrations of the compound indicates the DNA cleavage activity of compound 3 at the highest concentrations. Similar results were obtained for compound 4. However, compound 4 has stronger activity than compound 3. In the case of compound 4, there is no supercoiled DNA in the two highest concentrations of the compounds, with a reduced density of Form I for the other concentrations. The presence of a linear band was observed for all tested concentrations, indicating a double-strand break at all tested concentrations.


Following the DNA-binding studies, in order to assess whether the compounds display affinity toward the guanine–guanine (GG) or adenine–adenine region, restriction endonuclease analysis of compound–pBR322 plasmid DNA adducts is carried out using the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII. These enzymes recognize G/GACTT and A/AGCTT, respectively, and hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond between adjacent guanine and adenine sites. The pBR322 plasmid DNA has only one binding site for both enzymes, so the enzymes convert Forms I and II DNA to linear Form III DNA. Fig. 11 illustrates the electrophoretograms applied to the interaction of plasmid DNA with a concentration of each of the compounds. The figure shows that plasmid DNA restrictions are observed by the BamHI and HindIII enzymes for 3 and 4. Both enzymes digested the DNA-compound 3 mixture. However, the DNA-compound 4 mixture inhibits BamHI enzyme digestion, indicating that the compound binds to G/G nucleotides. This is probably due to the conformational change in DNA when compound 4 is covalently linked with A/A nucleotides of DNA.

On the other hand, it is stated in the literature that compounds with large ΔEp values and large HOMO/LUMO energy differences will interact with pBR322 plasmid DNA to a greater extent. However, the results obtained in this study contradicted this hypothesis. In this case, it was concluded that it would be more accurate to interpret the compound-DNA interaction by considering the whole structure. However, it can be stated that all ring conformations of compound 4 play an important role in the interactions.

Two types of cell lines were used for cytotoxicity tests on compounds. The MDA-MB-231 cell line is epithelial cells isolated from the breast tissue of a female adenocarcinoma patient. COS-1 is an African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell line. The cytotoxicity of diansa-spiro-cyclotetraphosphazenes (3 and 4) was determined by MTT assay against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and COS-1 mammalian fibroblast cells. Cells were co-incubated with the positive control, cis-diammineplatinum(II) dichloride (cis-platin), and phosphazenes at concentrations from 31.2 μM to 500 μM for 24 h. The cell viability % was evaluated compared to negative control cells. According to the results obtained, compounds 3 and 4 showed very high cytotoxic effects in both cell lines depending on concentrations (Fig. 12).

Compound 3 was found to have a similar cytotoxic effect on MDA-MB-231 and COS-1 cell lines, whereas compound 4 had a higher cytotoxic effect than 3 on the COS-1 cell line. Both compounds showed as much cytotoxic effect as the positive control. In addition, negative cytotoxic values were based on lower concentrations of DMSO solvent of 31.2 μM and 62.5 μM. However, potent cytotoxic effects were seen in the range of 31.2 μM and 500 μM. The highest concentration of 500 μM nearly killed both cells.

In the current study, a relatively facile procedure for the synthesis of large macrocycles containing organic/inorganic-based hybrid cyclotetraphosphazene rings was reported, in continuation of our work on the preparation and potential applications of multi-heterocyclic cyclotetraphosphazene derivatives. For this purpose, stereogenic 2-cis-4-dichloro-monoferrocenyl-ansa-(N/O)cyclotetraphosphazene (2) was synthesized and condensed with N2O2 donor-type aminopodands (L2 and L3) to obtain stereogenic monoferrocenyl-2,4-ansa-6,8-ansa-spirocyclotetraphosphazenes (3 and 4). These compounds are the first examples of dias-type 4-hydroxyphenyl-pendant armed multi-heterocyclotetraphosphazenes. The introduction of a 4-hydroxyphenyl functionality on ferrocenylcyclotetraphosphazene could be very important for enhancing solubility and the bioactivity properties of these compounds. Thus, chiral hybrid products and/or their composite materials can find many applications in various fields such as biological, electrochemical and solar cell electrolytes.

On the other hand, both dias have four chiral P-centres and these compounds are expected to occur as racemic mixtures. With respect to the X-ray crystallographic data of 4, the absolute configuration of one enantiomer was determined to be SS′S′′R′′′. But, the space group of 4 is designated as P, and this space group contains a center of symmetry, which means that both stereoisomers (SS′S′′R′′′/RR′R′′S′′′) are in equal amounts in the crystal lattice. These chirality studies on cyclotetraphosphazenes may also shed light on pharmaceutical chemistry research and applications of chiral additives for liquid crystals.
In addition, the electrochemical properties of 3 and 4 were investigated and a reversible redox peak was observed in both compounds. Compound 3 was determined to have a considerably larger HOMO and LUMO energy difference compared to compound 4. Therefore, the oxidation and reduction response time for 3 was found to be significantly smaller than for 4. On the other hand, ferrocene-based charge convertible phosphorus–nitrogen structures have been proposed as a new generation and synergistic DSSC materials. The proposed architectural combination could be an alternative structure in which photovoltaic cells can be simply built on various platforms. Both compounds were also used to study their bioactivity properties. Notably, however, bacterial strains of P. aeuruginosa were found to be most sensitive to both compounds, with MICs of 625 μM. Hence, compounds 3 and 4 may be interesting sources for the discovery of new antibiotic agents against P. aeruginosa strains. The MIC value of 312.5 μM obtained with 3 showed that it has as good potency for C. albicans as the reference antibiotic ketoconazole as well. So, 3 can be an attractive agent for the discovery of new antibiotics against C. albicans. Moreover, compounds 3 and 4 have DNA cleavage activities and compound 4 has DNA binding activity even at the lowest concentration and inhibits enzyme digestion to A/A nucleotides of pBR322 plasmid DNA. Besides that, the effect of the cytotoxicity of compounds 3 and 4 on cells was evaluated using an MTT assay. Despite the results showing that dias4 was more effective against both cell lines than 3, it was determined that both compounds had a powerful cytotoxic effect against cancer and healthy cell lines.
