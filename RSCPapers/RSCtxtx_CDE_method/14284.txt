Over the past few years, it has been proven that deepening the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of conjugated polymers is one of the most successful strategies to develop novel materials for high performance bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. Here we report an effective approach of side chain modification in a donor moiety to modulate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based two-dimensional conjugated polymers and hence obtain improved power conversion efficiency. Through the introduction of 2,3-dioctylthienyl groups instead of conventional 2-ethylhexylthienyl groups as side chains in the 4,8-positions of the BDT moiety, four mono-fluorinated quinoxaline based alternating polymers: poly{4,8-di(2-ethylhexylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(3′′-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTQ-EH), poly{4,8-di(2-ethylhexythiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(5′′-octylthiophen-2′′-yl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTTQ-EH), poly{4,8-di(2,3-dioctylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis-(3′′-octyloxyphenyl)-quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTQ-DO) and poly{4,8-di(2,3-dioctylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(5′′-octylthiophen-2′′-yl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTTQ-DO) were synthesized, in which the former two EH-based polymers contain the 2-ethylhexylthienyl side chain and the latter two DO-based polymers contain the 2,3-dioctylthienyl side chain. The results clearly indicated that the variation in the side chain of the BDT unit from the 2-ethylhexylthienyl group to the 2,3-dioctylthienyl group can cause a deep HOMO level and slightly enlarged bandgap of the polymer. Consequently, polymer solar cells from PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO showed high Vocs of 0.88 V and 0.85 V, while those of 0.78 V and 0.72 V were observed in PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH based devices, respectively. Both polymers deliver high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 6.8%, with an outstanding efficiency of 7.61% and an excellent fill factor (FF) of 75.9% for PBDTTFTQ-DO after tetrahydrofuran solvent vapour annealing for 30 s (while a PCE of 7.29% for PBDTTFTQ-EH). Similar results were investigated in PBDTTFTTQ-EH (a PCE of 6.82%) and PBDTTFTTQ-DO (a PCE of 7.25% with high FF of 75.7%) based solar cells. This finding should provide valuable guidelines for the design and synthesis of novel polymer donor materials for highly efficient polymer solar cells via fine tuning of the molecular energy levels and absorption spectra through a modulation of the side chain onto the donor moiety.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their advantages of low-cost and lightweight energy sources over a large area size on flexible substrates. In recent years, rapid developments in the synthesis of novel photoactive materials and their successful applications in high performance PSCs have been witnessed, however, the relatively lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs when compared with their inorganic counterparts still represents some limitations toward commercialization and widespread utilization. There are many factors limiting the performance of BHJ solar cells, in which the polymer electron donor materials play an important role in the whole performance of the device. Ideally, polymers should possess a broad absorption (small bandgap) to ensure effective harvesting of the solar photons and high hole mobility for charge transport. Furthermore, suitable energy levels of the polymers are required to match those of the fullerene derivatives so that excitons (bound electron–hole pairs) can readily dissociate at the donor–acceptor (D/A) interface to produce separated charge carriers. That is, a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to provide a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) and a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level to ensure enough offset for the charge separation.

Based on these considerations, much effort has been done to tune the optical bandgaps, molecular energy levels and carrier mobilities by incorporating electron-rich (donor) units with the electron-withdrawing (acceptor) units in one conjugated polymer. A variety of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers that can deliver promising performances have been developed and successfully been used as donor materials in PSCs. To further deepen the HOMO levels of the polymer and achieve enhanced device performances, strong electron deficient groups such as ketone groups, sulfonyl groups and fluorine atoms were introduced into the acceptor (A) units in the polymers. For instance, significant progress has been achieved by deepening the HOMO levels of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based conjugated polymers through the substitution of fluorine atoms on various acceptor units, resulting in high Voc and PCE in PSCs in comparison with the corresponding non-fluorinated derivatives in the past few years.
To ensure good solubility and processability of the conjugated polymer donor for film fabrication, in most cases, 2-ethylhexyloxy groups were usually introduced to the 4,8-position of BDT units to build the corresponding polymers. Furthermore, alkylthienyl substituted BDT, especially 2-ethylhexylthienyl substituted BDT were designed as the electron-rich unit and applied in constructing two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers for high performance photovoltaic devices because the thienyl-substitution is helpful to broaden the absorption band, lower the HOMO level and improve the hole mobility of the related copolymers. Although many routes have been developed to tailor the energy levels and bandgaps through modification of the acceptor of the BDT-based 2D conjugated polymers, there are seldom attempts to modulate the molecular energy level by fine adjustment of the flexible side chain (alkyl groups or alkoxy groups) on the BDT moiety. It should be noted that the electron affinity of the flexible side chains affect both HOMO and LUMO levels of the 2D conjugated polymers. In addition, the steric hindrance of long alkyl or alkoxy chains may decrease the π-conjugation degree of the polymer backbone to some extent. Consequently, the flexible side chains on the 2D conjugated BDT moiety play an important role not only in the aspect of solubility but also in their optical and electrical properties. Recently, to tune the molecular energy levels of the polymers, researchers have devoted to finely modify the flexible side chains of the 2D conjugated BDT moiety by replacing the 2-ethylhexylthienyl group with a meta-alkoxy-phenyl unit, as expected, the resulting polymer showed deeper HOMO levels, consequently leading to an enhanced Voc and PCE. To modulate the molecular energy levels of BDT based 2D conjugated polymers through another effective side chain modification approach, in this paper, two types of alkylthienyl groups were introduced to the BDT units, meanwhile two mono-fluorinated quinoxaline derivatives were chosen as the electron-withdrawing moiety to build the D–A polymers, due to their excellent electron-deficient N-heterocycle structure and facile synthesis process. The structures of the mentioned alternating polymers: poly{4,8-di(2-ethylhexylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(3′′-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTQ-EH), poly{4,8-di(2-ethylhexythiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(5′′-octylthiophen-2′′-yl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTTQ-EH), poly{4,8-di(2,3-dioctylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis-(3′′-octyloxyphenyl)-quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTQ-DO) and poly{4,8-di(2,3-dioctylthiophene-5-yl)-2,6-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,5-[5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-(6′-fluoro-2′,3′-bis(5′′-octylthiophen-2′′-yl)quinoxaline)]} (PBDTTFTTQ-DO) are shown in Scheme 1, in which the former two EH-based polymers contain the 2-ethylhexylthienyl side chain and the latter two DO-based polymers contain the 2,3-dioctylthienyl side chain. It is worthy to note that both PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO possess deeper HOMO energy levels and slightly larger bandgaps in comparison with those of PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH. With the conventional BHJ polymer solar cell device structure, the devices based on PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH exhibited remarkable PCEs of 7.29% and 6.82% with corresponding Vocs of 0.78 V and 0.72 V, while PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO-based devices showed excellent PCE results of 7.61% and 7.25% with higher Vocs of 0.88 V and 0.85 V, respectively.

All compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR) recorded on a Bruker AV 500 spectrometer in CDCl3 at room temperature. Molecular weights and distributions of the copolymers were estimated by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method, THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The absorption spectra were determined by a Unico UV-2102 scanning spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the polymers was investigated on Universal V2.6D TA instruments. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CHI 660D Electrochemical Workstation with glassy carbon, Pt wire, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. Polymer thin films were formed by drop-casting chloroform solution (analytical reagent, 1 mg ml−1) onto the working electrode, and then dried in the air. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were collected in air under ambient conditions using the MultiMode scanning probe microscope (AFM, Veeco MultiMode V).


SVA was conducted under ambient conditions at room temperature in a glove box. THF (2 ml) was injected into a 30 mm glass Petri dish. The Petri dish was closed for 1 min to let the THF vapour saturate the treatment chamber. Then the as-cast film was transferred to the Petri dish. The film was about 1 cm above the solvent level during the SVA. After 30 s, the film was removed from the treatment chamber.


The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al, a 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer was spin-cast on the ITO substrate, then dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. The polymer:PC71BM active layer was prepared by spin-coating its 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution with various weight ratios. A 5 nm PFN layer was then spin-coated from methanol solution in the presence of a trace amount of acetic acid onto the active layer. Subsequently, the films were transferred into a vacuum evaporator and 100 nm of Al were deposited as the cathode. The effective area of a device was 0.16 cm2 as determined by the shadow mask used during deposition of the Al cathode. PCE values were determined from J–V curve measurements (using a Keithley 2400 source meter) under 1 sun, AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192; 1000 W m−2). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were taken using a monochromator (Newport, Cornerstone 130) joined to the same xenon lamp and a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR 830) coupled to a light chopper.


The device structure of space charge limited current (SCLC) studies is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al. The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which is described by the equation: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ((V2)/(d3)), where J is the current, μ is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the substrate's series resistance from the applied voltage (Vappl), V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs. The hole-mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves. The effective area was also 0.16 cm2.


Transient photovoltage measurement was performed by holding the devices under the open-circuit condition under an illumination of a 100 W tungsten halogen lamp. The devices were connected to an oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO4104, 1 GHz) that has an input impedance of the oscilloscope of 1 MΩ to hold the device at an open circuit. The excitation pulse was generated using a pulsed laser (OPOTEK Vibrant 355, with a 5 ns optical pulse). The perturbation light intensity was attenuated by a set of neutral density filters so that the amplitude of TPV is much less than Voc. Transient photocurrent measurement was performed with the device being held under a short circuit condition by connecting the device to the ground through a small resistor. The resulting current transient was measured using an oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO4104, 1 GHz) in parallel with a small resistor of 50 Ω. The excitation pulse was generated using a pulsed laser (OPOTEK Vibrant 355, with a 5 ns optical pulse).


The synthetic routes of the four polymers are shown in Scheme 1. In our synthetic design, the two octyl groups were introduced to the 2,3-position of the side chain conjugated thiophene rings to replace the 2-ethylhexyl groups. The 5-octyl thienyl and 3-octyloxyphenyl groups were chosen to build the quinoxaline units for their good performances in the donor–acceptor polymers for PSCs. The four polymers were synthesized through the typical Stille-coupling reaction with a good yield (>82%), using toluene as the solvent and tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3) and tri(otolyl)phosphine (P(o-Tol)3) as catalysts. All the four polymers showed good solubility in chloroform, o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) and other common solvents, especially the two polymers containing two octyl groups in the BDTT units (PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO). The number-average molecular weights of PBDTTFTQ-EH, PBDTTFTQ-DO, PBDTTFTTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-DO are 64.74, 75.96, 18.45 and 135.95 kDa, with the corresponding polydispersity indices (PDI) to be 2.79, 3.29, 5.49 and 6.35, respectively, which were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).


All of the polymers have a decomposition temperature (defined as the 5% weight-loss temperature, Td) over 300 °C and the PBDTTFTQ-EH shows the highest Td (427 °C for PBDTTFTQ-EH, 329 °C for PBDTTFTQ-DO, 399 °C for PBDTTFTTQ-EH and 370 °C for PBDTTFTTQ-DO, see Fig. S8 in the ESI) under nitrogen as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), indicating their excellent thermal stabilities.

The optical properties of the polymers were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy both in CHCl3 solutions (see Fig. S9 in the ESI) and in thin films (see Fig. 1a and b). The detailed data obtained from these absorption spectra are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S9 and 1, in comparison with the two EH-based polymers, the DO-substituted polymers (PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO) exhibited slightly blue-shifted spectra both in solution and in solid films; i.e. the films of PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH showed absorption peaks at 625 nm and 644 nm, however, the corresponding absorption peaks of PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO were located at 608 nm and 626 nm, respectively, implying that the replacement of PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH with PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO slightly increases the optical bandgaps. The absorption edges (λedge) of the four polymer films are 740 nm (PBDTTFTQ-EH), 720 nm (PBDTTFTQ-DO), 745 nm (PBDTTFTTQ-EH) and 722 nm (PBDTTFTTQ-DO), from which the corresponding optical bandgaps (Eoptg) can be calculated to be 1.68 eV, 1.72 eV, 1.66 eV and 1.72 eV, respectively, according to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λedge. It is found that the absorption edges of DO-substituted polymers (PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO) are slightly smaller than those of the corresponding EH-based polymers (PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH), which are ascribed to the big steric hindrance of the two octyl groups on the side chains. Furthermore, it should be noted that when replacing the pendent m-octyloxyphenyl side groups (PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTQ-DO) by 5-octylthiophene rings (PBDTTFTTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-DO), red-shifted absorption spectra and decreased bandgaps were achieved, which were in good agreement with the literature.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymers (Fig. 1c and d). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined from the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and the onset reduction potentials (Ered) according to the following equations: HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV); LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV), where the unit of the potential is V vs. Ag/Ag+. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and the onset reduction pontentials (Ered) are 0.58 V/−1.66 V (PBDTTFTQ-EH), 0.66 V/−1.68 V (PBDTTFTQ-DO), 0.41 V/−1.68 V (PBDTTFTTQ-EH) and 0.60 V/−1.72 V (PBDTTFTTQ-DO) vs. Ag/Ag+, corresponding to a HOMO/LUMO level of −5.29 eV/−3.05 eV, −5.37 eV/−3.03 eV, −5.12 eV/−3.03 eV and −5.31 eV/−2.99 eV, respectively. Obviously, when the 2-ethlyhexyllthienyl group was replaced by the 2,3-dioctylthienyl unit, the HOMO level of the corresponding polymer can be significantly reduced, 0.08 eV for PBDTTFTQ-DO and 0.19 eV for PBDTTFTTQ-DO. To the best of our knowledge, this finding had never been reported in scientific literature that contains BDT-based D–A polymers with similar side chain structure. Thus, this strategy can be a guideline for the design of highly efficient polymer materials with enhanced photovoltage. Because the Voc of BHJ PSCs is closely related to the gap between the HOMO of the donor polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor material in their blended films, a higher Voc can be expected in the PSCs based on PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO compared to the devices based on PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH. To make a clear comparison, the energy level diagrams of the materials used in this study are summarized in Fig. 2. It is obvious that the LUMO energy levels of the four polymers are significantly higher than that of PC71BM, which facilitate electron transfer from the polymers to the PC71BM at the photoactive layer of PSCs.
In order to explore the electronic properties of the polymers, molecular simulations were performed on single repeated donor–acceptor units with all alkyl chains reserved using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. As shown in Fig. 3 and 4, the localization of HOMOs was distributed along the polymer backbone while the LUMOs of both polymers were somewhat more localized on the acceptor units, indicating the significant charge-transfer character between the BDT and quinoxaline unit, which was consistent with the observed strong low-energy absorption band in Fig. 1. From the simulation data it can be seen that deeper HOMO levels for DO-based polymers and smaller calculated bandgaps for EH-based polymers were investigated, which were consistent with the measured HOMO levels and optical bandgaps in Fig. 1. The absorption parameters and energy levels of the four polymers are also listed in Table 1.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the obtained polymers, PSCs with a device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3 N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene]) (PFN, 5 nm)/Al that followed our previous work, were fabricated. The photoactive layer was spin-coated on top of the pre-fabricated PEDOT:PSS layer from its 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution. After that, the blend film was pre-thermal annealed at 90 °C for 10 min and followed by a THF-SVA of 30 s. Then a thin layer of 5 nm water/alcohol soluble PFN that can serve as the electron-collecting layer was spin-coated atop the photoactive layer from methanol solution in the presence of a trace amount of acetic acid before deposition of the cathode.

Optimal weight ratios between polymers:PC71BM were found to be 1:1.5 for PBDTTFTQ-EH, 1:3 for PBDTTFTQ-DO, 1:2 for PBDTTFTTQ-EH, and 1:3 for PBDTTFTTQ-DO (Fig. S10 and Table S1). In order to optimize the morphology of the blend films and thus to improve the photovoltaic properties, 2% (v/v) of 1-chloronaphthalen (CN) was used as the additive for PBDTTFTQ-EH based devices. The device performances of both polymers are critically dependent on the processing conditions (donor/acceptor blend ratios and additive and solvent-vapour annealing (SVA)), which are summarized in Fig. S10–12 and Tables S1–3in detail. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the corresponding optimized PSCs under AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 illumination are presented in Fig. 5. Photovoltaic parameters deduced from the corresponding J–V curves in Fig. 5a and c are summarized in Table 2. It is interesting to note that PBDTTFTQ-EH exhibited optimized device performance when a combination of CN and THF-SVA were used, while PBDTTFTQ-DO reached its highest PCE (∼7.61%) in the case of a simple THF-SVA process. For the PSC devices prepared under the optimal conditions, the PBDTTFTQ-DO based devices showed a Voc of 0.88 V, which is 0.10 V larger than that of the device of PBDTTFTQ-EH. Like PBDTTFTQ-DO, a higher Voc of 0.85 V (about 0.13 V larger than that of PBDTTFTTQ-EH) with relatively high PCE (7.25%) was also achieved for the optimized PBDTTFTTQ-DO based devices after THF SVA for 30 s. The enhanced Voc of the DO-substituted polymer based devices were ascribed to the deeper HOMO energy levels as discussed above.

As shown in Fig. 5b and d, the devices of these four polymers processed under each optimal conditions showed similar EQE peak values of >60%, while the response peaks were 461 nm with the corresponding EQE peak value of 63.50% for PBDTTFTQ-DO, 572 nm for PBDTTFTQ-EH (60.35%), 454 nm for PBDTTFTTQ-DO (63.99%), and 455 nm for PBDTTFTTQ-EH (62.42%). Nevertheless, the response ranges of the PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH-based devices at the long wavelength region are 22 nm and 24 nm red-shifted compared to that of the corresponding PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO-based devices, which are in accord with the film absorption spectra of the polymers as shown in Fig. 1a and b. As a result, the PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH devices showed relatively higher short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of 13.2 mA cm−2 and 13.4 mA cm−2, while the PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO devices exhibited decreasing Jscs of 11.4 mA cm−2 and 11.3 mA cm−2. Except for the differences in Voc and Jsc, FF values of the devices from these four polymers are essentially high (same 70.8% for the two EH-based polymers vs. 75.9% for PBDTTFTQ-DO and 75.7% for PBDTTFTTQ-DO), both implying very good charge separation, transporting and collecting efficiency in these optimal devices. The higher FF of the two DO-based polymers might have resulted from their good solubility and film processibility. More importantly, the overall efficiency of the devices from both polymers exceeds 6.8%. The best PCE is 7.61% for PBDTTFTQ-DO, 7.29% for PBDTTFTQ-EH, 7.25% for PBDTTFTTQ-DO and 6.82% for PBDTTFTTQ-EH, while the average PCE over 5 individual PSCs from each polymer is 7.42%, 7.15%, 7.09% and 6.65%, separately. Obviously, the slightly better photovoltaic performance in the PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO devices is mainly attributed to the higher FF and enhanced Voc resulting from their deepened HOMO levels compared with that of PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH.
To illuminate the effects of SVA on the device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) study was carried out to investigate the phase-separated morphologies of the polymers:PC71BM blends corresponding to the best performance, which are shown in Fig. 6–8. The light and dark domains correspond to the aggregations of the polymer and PC71BM, respectively. For the pristine films of PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTQ-DO, it can be clearly observed that both the two blend films exhibit an interpenetrating feature with a bicontinuous network between the polymer and PC71BM. In addition, a smooth surface with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of 0.54 nm for PBDTTFTQ-DO and 1.75 nm for PBDTTFTQ-EH were recorded, respectively. As described above, the devices from PBDTTFTQ-DO showed strong dependence on the THF-SVA (see Fig. S12 and Table S3), which should correlate the change of the film morphology upon treatment. As seen in Fig. 6, the RMS roughness and the domain size of the films exhibit a continuous enlargement as the SVA time increases. The optimal THF-SVA time is found to be around 30 s for the PBDTTFTQ-DO blend film. Under this treatment process, the film showed a RMS roughness of 1.35 nm with an ideal domain size of 10–20 nm (Fig. 6b), which is pretty favorable for efficient diffusion of excitons to donor–acceptor interface. An annealing duration exceeding this optimized condition could lead to a significantly increased domain size in the PBDTTFTQ-DO blend film, resulting in a reduction in overall performance (see Fig. S12 and Table S3). When the THF-SVA duration reached 3 min, the resulting film showed unexpected phase separation with a corresponding domain size over 200 nm, which is much larger than the typical exciton diffusion length of ca. 10 nm, thus is not desired for efficient excitons dissociation at the D/A interface. We also found that in order to obtain optimal performance in an PBDTTFTQ-EH device, SVA in conjunction with incorporation of an additive, such as CN (2%, v/v) into the blend solution is required (see Fig. S11 and Table S2). This combination was found to be able to promote the demixing of the polymer and PCBM in the blend film, so as to optimize the film morphology. Optimal phase-separated morphologies are also investigated in Fig. 8 for PBDTTFTTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-DO blend films after THF SVA 30 s, except for the RMS values of the treated films decreasing slightly.

To get an insight into the effects of the SVA on charge transporting, the hole mobilities, μhole of the blends of polymers and PC71BM were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S13–S15) for the four polymers with different treatments and film thicknessess. For PBDTTFTQ-DO blend films, a high hole mobility (up to 5.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was achieved after the THF-SVA 30 s, while the pristine film only showed a moderate μhole of 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table S5). These results were consistent with the performance of each device and the film morphology induced by the THF-SVA as shown in Fig. 6b. Similar results were observed for the PBDTTFTQ-EH film except that the hole mobility showed a decrease after the CN addition (3.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 1.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, see Table S4). Furthermore, the corresponding hole mobilities of the other two polymers after THF-SVA for 30 s (Fig. S15) are 1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (PBDTTFTTQ-EH) and 1.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (PBDTTFTTQ-DO), which are consistent well with their photovoltaic performances.

To further shed light on the role of SVA, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements to probe the charge recombination in the PBDTTFTQ-DO devices with/without the SVA. The TPV technique has previously been used to study the charge decay dynamics in organic solar cells under a given steady-state illumination, while TPC was used to determine the charge density in the devices. For the TPV measurement, the perturbation from a pulsed laser was attenuated by a set of neutral density filters so that the amplitude of TPV is much smaller as compared to that of Voc. Since there is no charge collected under the Voc condition, the excess charge carriers that are excited by the pulsed laser are recombined and their lifetime can be extracted from the exponential fitting on the decay of the transient photovoltage. Fig. 9a shows the typical results of TPV measurement for the PBDTTFTQ-DO devices before and after THF-SVA for 30 s, as obtained under 1 sun illumination and open-circuit voltage conditions, and the extracted carrier lifetimes are 0.187 μs and 0.320 μs for the PBDTTFTQ-DO devices with/without SVA, respectively. The observed shorter carrier lifetime in the device with SVA is consistent with its relatively lower Voc than that of the device without the treatment (0.88 V vs. 0.98 V, Table S3). On the other side, the device that underwent SVA showed a higher charge carrier density than that without SVA (Fig. 9b), which is in good agreement with the observed higher Jsc after 30 s of treatment (Table S3) and was ascribed to a more preferable morphology for efficient exciton dissociation as shown in Fig. 6b. By taking the extracted lifetime and mobility together, the calculated carrier diffusion length in the device after 30 s SVA is obviously higher than that of the control device, which is expected to be responsible for the largely improved FF after the SVA.

To summarize, four D–A polymers based on side chain modified 2D conjugated BDT and mono-fluorinated quinoxaline derivatives, PBDTTFTQ-EH, PBDTTFTQ-DO, PBDTTFTTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-DO were synthesized and characterized. The results clearly indicated that the variation in the side chain of the BDT unit from the 2-ethylhexylthienyl group to the 2,3-dioctylthienyl group can cause a huge impact on their optical properties and electronic HOMO levels. This finding should provide valuable guidelines for the design and synthesis of novel polymer donor materials for highly efficient polymer solar cells with a high open-circuit voltage via fine tuning the molecular energy levels and absorption spectra through a modulation of the side chain onto the donor moiety. In good agreement with the deeper HOMO levels of PBDTTFTQ-DO (−5.37 eV) and PBDTTFTTQ-DO (−5.31 eV) than those of PBDTTFTQ-EH (−5.29 eV) and PBDTTFTTQ-EH (−5.12 eV), the devices from PBDTTFTQ-DO and PBDTTFTTQ-DO showed high Voc values of 0.88 V and 0.85 V, while that of 0.78 V and 0.72 V were observed in PBDTTFTQ-EH and PBDTTFTTQ-EH devices. Both polymers deliver high power conversion efficiency, with an outstanding efficiency of 7.61% and an excellent fill factor of 75.9% in PBDTTFTQ-DO as obtained via solvent vapour annealing, which mainly resulted from the improved carrier diffusion length of the devices after a proper SVA process.
