A series of propeller-shaped triperylene hexaimide (TPH) non-fullerene acceptors, featuring branched alkyl side chains with different lengths (TPH-4, TPH-5, TPH-6, and TPH-7), have been designed and synthesized. The effects of the branched alkyl chain length on the physical properties, thin-film microstructure, molecular packing, charge transport and the resulting photovoltaic properties of these materials have been systematically investigated. It was found that TPH-7 with the longest alkyl side chain showed the best photovoltaic performance compared with three other TPH molecules, and an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.6% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) has been obtained using a wide-band-gap polymer PDBT-T1 as the electron donor. These results demonstrate that finely tailoring alkyl substituents on TPH-based small molecular acceptors critically impacts the structural order of thin films and molecular orientation, and thus the photovoltaic performance.

Over the past few decades, non-fullerene semiconductor materials have shown tremendous potential as electron acceptors for application in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their lower cost, higher optical and electronic variability and superior morphological stability relative to fullerene-based acceptors. Until now, a variety of high-performance non-fullerene acceptors have been developed. Among them, perylene bisimide (PBI) and its derivatives are evaluated as promising candidates for highly efficient OSCs because of their appealing properties, including strong absorption in the visible spectral region, high electron mobility, excellent photochemical stability, and so forth. Despite the aforementioned advantages, traditional PBI molecules usually perform poorly in solution-processed BHJ OSCs owing to the formation of large crystalline aggregate domains and severe donor–acceptor phase separation in photoactive layers, which is attributed to inherently strong π–π stacking tendency of PBIs. Therefore, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to suppressing the self-aggregation, mainly by means of constructing twisted dimers or three dimensional (3D)-structure oligomers via modification at the imide, bay and non-bay positions of PBIs. In most cases, such modulated PBI-based acceptors possess substantially enhanced photovoltaic performance, yielding the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 6–9%.

Generally, in terms of the functionalization at imide positions for the design of new PBI-based acceptors, bulky swallow-tail alkyl chains are employed aimed at guaranteeing the solubility and then promoting the solution processability. It is also expected that these alkyl substituents play a crucial role in controlling the intermolecular interaction, molecular packing, and charge-transport properties. Furthermore, structural modification of alkyl chains impacts the physical interaction between the donor and acceptor in the heterojunction layers. Therefore, the introduction of different alkyl chains at imides of PBI provides an alternative strategy to improve PCEs of solar cells. In recent years, more and more studies have been focused on alkyl chain engineering in the field of OSCs, typically for polymers. According to the reported studies, subtle changes of the size and branching of alkyl substituents can lead to a significant difference in the device performance. For small molecular non-fullerene acceptors as an emerging research focus, however, there are few systematic reports on the correlation between different alkyl substituents and the corresponding photovoltaic properties, especially in regard to PBI-based acceptor materials.
Very recently, we reported a novel three bladed propeller-shaped perylene dye, named triperylene hexaimides (TPH-5), which exhibited encouraging photovoltaic performance. Considering the tailored alkyl chain, such as alteration in length, may manipulate the photovoltaic properties, we designed and synthesized three new fullerene-free acceptors by replacing C5H11 in TPH-5 with C4H9, C6H13 and C7H15, respectively (TPH-4, TPH-6, TPH-7, Scheme 1). Subsequently, their thermal, optical and electrochemical properties, microstructure in solid films, and charge transport as well as OSC behavior were systematically investigated together with those of TPH-5 for comparison. We find that the TPH-7 with the longest alkyl chain of C7H15 is the best one for photovoltaic application and shows an outstanding PCE of 8.6% when paired with a wide-band-gap polymer electron donor (PDBT-T1, shown in Fig. S1a). Our results reveal that fine-tuning the alkyl chain is an important factor that exerts great influence on the thin-film morphology and molecular packing, and thus the photovoltaic performance of PBI-based non-fullerene acceptors.

As shown in Scheme 1, TPH-4, TPH-5, TPH-6 and TPH-7 were synthesized according to previously reported procedures. The target products were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and high resolution mass spectra. All of these molecules are readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform and ortho-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties of the four acceptor materials were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. 1 and Table S1). These compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td, at 5% weight loss) above 350 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, and are thus suitable for organic solar device applications. The DSC profiles of the four molecules all showed clear recrystallization peaks (Tc) upon cooling and melting temperatures (Tm) upon heating, suggesting that these compounds can readily crystallize, as also evidenced by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).


The solution and normalized thin-film UV-vis absorption spectra of the four acceptors are displayed in Fig. 1c and relevant optical data are listed in Table 1. In dilute chloroform solution, these TPH molecules present nearly identical absorption plots with the maximum absorption peak at ∼516 nm independent of their alkyl chains. Meanwhile, the maximal absorption coefficients of the four small molecules are similar. In the solid state, it can be seen that the absorption spectra of TPHs were broadened and red-shifted relative to the corresponding solution spectra. In addition, the increasing intensity of the vibronic shoulders and bathochromic maximum absorption peaks (at 524–530 nm) with the increase of the alkyl chain length reflects stronger intermolecular interactions in TPH-6 or TPH-7 films compared with TPH-4 and TPH-5 films. This phenomenon is supported by AFM and GIWAXS results shown later. In spite of the longer branched alkyl chains which generally suppress intermolecular interactions, the enhanced molecular packing behavior of TPH-6 or TPH-7 may be related to the film-forming kinetics caused by varied solubility. From the onset of the film absorption spectra, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) are estimated to be 2.04, 2.04, 2.05, and 2.06 eV for TPH-4, TPH-5, TPH-6, and TPH-7, respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) properties of the neat TPH films, PDBT-T1 film and the 1:1 blend films were explored (Fig. 1d and S1b). Comparing the PL intensity of blend films with that of the neat TPH films and PDBT-T1 film, almost complete quenching (>98%) of both the TPHs and PDBT-T1 emissions was observed in the blend films, indicating highly efficient charge transfer between the four acceptors and the polymer.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to study the electrochemical properties of compounds TPH-4-TPH-7 in CH2Cl2 solution and in films. As shown in Fig. S2a, all of the molecules in solution show similar redox behavior with four reversible reduction waves, and the first and second half-wave reduction potentials vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) are listed in Table 1. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels estimated based on the data of CV in the solid state are −3.80 to −3.84 eV (Table 1). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the TPHs calculated from the optical band gap and the LUMO energy level are −5.85 to −5.88 eV (Table 1). As aforementioned, the results declare that the variation of alkyl chains has a negligible effect on optical and electronic properties of TPH compounds, since the imide group disconnects the conjugation between the imide substituents and the perylene core.

In order to investigate how the branched alkyl chain length affects the photovoltaic properties, BHJ solar cells were fabricated using TPHs as the acceptors and PDBT-T1 as the donor with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. We varied the compositions of PDBT-T1 and TPHs in solution to optimize the device performance and these results are displayed in Table S2, Fig. S3 and S3. The optimal D/A weight ratios for the devices based on these four acceptors were found to be 1:1. Next, a small amount of processing additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used to further optimize the morphology of active layers. The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are presented in Fig. 2a and S6a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. In contrast to TPH-5, both TPH-4 and TPH-6 showed slight changes in photovoltaic performance. When compared with TPH-7, it is clear that extending the alkyl length could lead to an obvious improvement of device performance. The devices based on TPH-7 received an impressive PCE of 8.04% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.98 V, a higher short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.45 mA cm−2, and a higher fill factor (FF) of 65.6%. After incorporating 0.25% DIO into the active layer processing, all cell efficiencies based on these four small molecules are further enhanced, arising from simultaneously increased Jsc and FF. The devices based on TPH-4, TPH-5 and TPH-6 gave similar photovoltaic results as before. In the case of TPH-7, a maximum PCE of 8.64% was obtained with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 12.84 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 68.7%. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is one of the highest values reported to date for PBI-based fullerene-free organic solar cells. It is noted that the TPH-7-based device performance without DIO can be comparable to that of TPH-4 or TPH-6-based devices with DIO. These results prove that appropriate modification of alkyl chains at imides of PBI can improve the PCEs of solar devices.

The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimal devices based on TPH-4-TPH-7 are displayed in Fig. 2b and S5b. We can see that the IPCE curves for all the types of devices cover a broad and strong photoresponse from 300 to 700 nm. It is notable that IPCE values of TPH-7-based solar cells are higher than those of solar cells based on three other TPH acceptors in the wavelength range of 530–650 nm; meanwhile, the absorption spectrum of the donor PDBT-T1 is in this region (Fig. S1a), implying more efficient incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency for PDBT-T1 when blended with TPH-7. Therefore, TPH-7-based devices yielded the highest Jsc whether to use additive DIO or not. The calculated Jsc values integrated from the IPCE spectra all agree well with those measured from the J–V curves with a mismatch within 3.7%. The bulk charge transport properties in the optimized blend films with 0.25% DIO were investigated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The electron and hole mobilities in the PDBT-T1:TPH-7 blend film were measured to be 1.55 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S6 and Table S3), which are higher than those of three other blend systems. The high and balanced electron and hole mobility contributes to the high Jsc and FF achieved in PDBT-T1:TPH-7 solar cells.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to provide specific information about the surface morphologies of the neat and blend films. As shown in Fig. 3a, there are a series of small clumps for the pure THP-4 film, while the THP-5 film (Fig. 3b) exhibits a fibrillar feature. As for THP-6 (Fig. 3c), an ordered film with a large domain size was seen. The surface texture of the pure THP-7 film (Fig. 3d) is similar to that observed in the THP-6 film, but with a smaller domain size and a decreased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 6.72 nm. The distinct morphology differences between TPHs reflect the fact that different alkyl chains in length can produce a strong influence on the microstructure of materials. Without the use of the DIO additive (Fig. 3e–h), evident polymer fibrils and uneven phase separation can be clearly observed for all PDBT-T1:TPH blend films. With regard to the optimized active layers (0.25% DIO, see Fig. 3i–l), the fibrous structure is still visible for TPH5, TPH-6 and TPH-7, but with a larger surface RMS roughness. Dramatic changes of the film morphology can be found for the PDBT-T1:TPH-4 blend film, which displays homogeneous clusters with many aggregated domains. Moreover, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis provided more clear evidence about the evolved BHJ morphologies of blend films with DIO. As shown in Fig. S8, evener continuous interpenetrating networks were achieved for all the blend films with DIO than those of blend films without DIO, which are beneficial for efficient exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge transport. All of these characteristics will contribute to the increased Jsc and FF thus to higher PCE.

To further understand the influence of different alkyl substituents on the microstructure of the active layers, GIWAXS measurement was carried out to reveal local molecular packing and orientation texture of the pure TPH and PDBT-T1:TPH blend films. The two-dimensional (2D) scattering profiles and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts are shown in Fig. 4. For the four pure acceptors, quite weak (010) π–π stacking peaks in the in-plane direction were seen due to their distorted molecular geometry, whereas an intense diffraction peak at about 0.42 Å−1 was found in all pristine TPH films, which comes from the reflection of the (001) crystal plane corresponding to the distance (14.95 Å) of two PBI subunits in neighbouring TPH molecules. The (100) lamellar reflection peaks for TPH-4-TPH-7 are located at qxy = 0.297, 0.293, 0.289, and 0.286 Å−1, respectively, corresponding to the interchain distances of 21.2, 21.4, 21.7, and 22.0 Å, respectively. These distances correlate well with the alkyl substituent interspacing on PBI moieties with the extension of alkyl chains. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4a, the azimuthal distributions of the (100) peaks and (001) peaks vary distinctly with the alkyl chain length of TPH. To investigate the crystallinity of pure TPHs, the coherence lengths of the (100) lamellar packing in the out-of-plane direction were calculated by the Scherrer equation. The values are 8.70, 8.44, 15.7, and 26.9 nm for TPH-4, TPH-5, TPH-6, and TPH-7, respectively. Besides, obvious lamellar (200) reflection peaks are present in TPH-6 and TPH-7 films, indicating that TPH-6 and TPH-7 possess stronger crystallinity compared to TPH-4 and TPH-5. However, both TPH-6 and TPH-7 show a more prominent (100) peak along the qz direction, indicative of an edge-on dominated molecular orientation in TPH-6 and TPH-7 films, which is unfavorable for vertical charge transport in the device. The electron mobilities of TPH-4-TPH-7 measured by the SCLC method (see Fig. 4c) are 2.34 × 10−3, 2.60 × 10−3, 2.11 × 10−3, and 1.86 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are consistent with the GIWAXS results.
As can be seen from Fig. S9, the neat PDBT-T1 shows a strong (010) peak at qz = 1.71 Å−1, suggesting that PDBT-T1 has a preferred face-on orientation with respect to the substrate. For the blend films without DIO (Fig. 5a and b), all the out-of-plane line cut profiles present a broad peak in the low q region that is a sum of the reflection from PDBT-T1 and TPH, and a weak π–π stacking peak coming from PDBT-T1 at about 1.70 Å−1.
As DIO was used (Fig. 5c and d), the π–π stacking peaks along the qz direction show increased intensity for all blend films compared to the films without the DIO additive. Clearly, the DIO facilitates the face-on orientation of PDBT-T1 in blend films. For the PDBT-T1:TPH-4 blend with DIO, the (001) peak became significantly stronger in the in-plane direction and this enhancement may induce the morphological change as observed in AFM images. In comparison to other blends with DIO, the PDBT-T1:TPH-7 blend exhibits a weaker (100) reflection peak, implying that TPH-7 adopts a higher degree of face-on orientation and thus promotes vertical charge transport. In addition, resonate soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was used to probe the phase separation in the four BHJ blends. R-SoXS data were obtained at 285.2 eV, at which the contrast between the PDBT-T1 and the TPHs is highly enhanced. R-SoXS results confirm that the domain spacing formed in the PDBT-T1:TPH-7 blends (11.21 nm) is smaller than that in the optimal PDBT-T1:TPH-4 blends (11.63 nm), PDBT-T1:TPH-5 film (11.85 nm), and PDBT-T1:TPH-6 blends (12.08 nm). The small domain size would be in favour of exciton separation (Fig. S10). Collectively, these observations help to account for the reason that TPH-7 exhibits the most excellent photovoltaic performance.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized a series of propeller-shaped TPH-based non-fullerene acceptors, which possess branched alkyl side chains with different lengths at imide positions. All of these molecules showed similar optical and electrochemical properties but showed distinct differences in the thin-film morphologies and molecular packing conformation. Hence, the alkyl chain has a significant impact on the solid-state behavior, which in turn affects the charge transport properties and the device performance. In combination with a wide-band-gap donor PDBT-T1, TPH-4, TPH-5 and TPH-6 gave similar device results, while TPH-7 with the longest alkyl chain showed the best photovoltaic properties and an outstanding PCE of 8.64% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 12.84 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 68.7% was achieved. The present findings demonstrate that fine-tuning alkyl chains is an effective approach to optimize the photovoltaic properties of PBI-based small molecule acceptors, and provide more insight and guidance into constructing high-performance non-fullerene acceptors.


PDBT-T1 was synthesized in our lab as reported previously. Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylicbisimides and 1-bromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic bisimides were synthesized using known procedures.


A Schlenk flask was charged with 1,3,5-benzenetriboronic acid tris(pinacol) ester (1.0 equiv.), corresponding 1-bromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylicbisimides (b) (3.5 equiv.), THF (20 ml/2.0 g PBI-Br (b)) and Na2CO3 aqueous solution (2 M, 0.5 V THF). The mixture was degassed with argon for 15 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (0.12 equiv.) was added under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was refluxed for 48 h and then cooled down to room temperature. The cooled mixture was poured into 1 M HCl aqueous solution (1000 ml) and stirred for 2 h. The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with water and CH3OH, dried, and purified by column chromatography on a silica gel, eluted with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (2:1 to 1:1 v/v) to afford c as dark red solids.

To a standard photocyclization glassware were added 2 g compound c (10 × 200 mg), 500 ml toluene (10 × 50 ml) and 5 mg I2. The mixture was illuminated by using a 500 W mercury lamp for 24 hours. The mixture was extracted with saturated sodium sulfite solution (2 × 500 ml) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel, eluted with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (3:2 to 1:1 v/v) to afford TPH as red solids.

Prepatterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with detergent and ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 min each and subsequently dried in an oven overnight. The substrates were treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 20 min before use. PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP. AI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm) was spin-cast onto the ITO surface at 4000 rpm for 40 s (the thickness is about 40 nm), and baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air. Then the PDBT-T1:TPH active layer was spin-coated from o-DCB solution (PDBT-T1 concentration was fixed at 8 mg ml−1), followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min in a N2-filled glovebox. The optimal active layer thickness was about 100 nm (measured on a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer). Finally, a 10 nm Ca layer and a 100 nm Al electrode were deposited on top of the BHJ layers through a shadow mask under a vacuum about 1 × 10−4 Pa. The active area was 4.50 mm2. During the measurement, an aperture with the area of 3.14 mm2 was used. Device current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using a solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). The EQE spectra were acquired from a QEX10 Solar Cell EQE measurement system (PV measurement, Inc.).


AFM measurements were carried out with a Nanoscope IIIa instrument (Digital Instruments) in tapping mode under ambient conditions. TEM images of the active layers were achieved by using a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. GIWAXS measurements were conducted at beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Source, and the beam energy of 10 keV was incident to the sample at the grazing angle of 0.11–0.15°. The R-SoXS characterization was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at Advanced Light Source. The beam size at the sample was approximately 100 μm by 200 μm. The 2D scattering profile from the sample was captured by the CCD as far from the sample as possible (∼150 nm) and with the CCD as close as possible (∼50 nm). The profiles acquired from the two datasets were stitched together for an extended q-range. All the samples were prepared under the same conditions for the solar cells.
