π-spacers and alkyl side chains play a key role in the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of π-conjugated polymers. To investigate the collective effects of π-spacers, alkyl side chains, and various processing conditions on the photovoltaic properties, an array of four new low bandgap (LBG) π-conjugated polymers (P1–P4) was designed and synthesized for their application as donor materials in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs). These π-conjugated polymers contain a benzodithiophene (BDT) donor unit substituted with 2-ethylhexylselenyl or 2-hexyldecylselenyl as π-conjugated side chains and a dialkoxybenzothiadiazole (dialkoxyBT) electron deficient unit connected with thiophene or selenophene as π-spacers. Among the four polymers, the absorption spectra of P3 with the thiophene π-spacer showed a well enhanced vibronic shoulder peak between 620 and 650 nm, indicating that P3 possesses a strong interchain aggregation tendency and attains a planar backbone structure due to the non-covalent interactions arising between the sulfur atom in thiophene and the oxygen atom in dialkoxyBT. Under suitable device processing conditions optimized pristine PSCs of P3 showed a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.09%. After employing 1,8-diiodooctane as an additive, one of the PSC devices based on P2 displayed a PCE of 5.34%. The active layers of P1–P4 showed a positive response towards methanol treatment, especially the P3-based devices delivered an improved PCE of 5.63%, which was further assessed by electrical impedance spectroscopy. These findings in the current article provide a good specimen for efficiently fine tuning the optical and photovoltaic properties of π-conjugated polymers via varying the size of alkyl chains, π-spacer groups and device processing conditions for the imminent growth of LBG π-conjugated polymers.

In the last few years, excellent research on polymer-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has attracted special industrial and scientific interest. A foremost enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been accomplished via the use of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture comprising an electron rich π-conjugated donor polymer and an electron accepting fullerene derivative. The intriguing device fabrication conditions, new device strategies and synthesis of new π-conjugated donor polymers have paved a smooth way to achieve PCE surpassing 10%. Efficient donor polymers must have broad absorption for harvesting more solar flux, a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, and higher hole mobility. Until now, low band gap (LBG) donor polymers have been successfully synthesized by connecting the electron rich (D) and electron deficient (A) units in the polymer backbone. It is demonstrated that the D–A approach is highly efficient for regulating energy levels, carrier mobility, and reducing the bandgap energies of the polymers by prudent selection of D and A units.

One of the best choices for designing highly efficient D–A based π-conjugated donor materials is to make use of π-spacers by locating them between the electron rich and deficient units. Generally, the introduction of π-spacers effectively reduces the steric hindrance between the D and A units, thus resulting in a more planar structure for the polymer backbone. Additionally, the π-spacers also play a significant role in modulating the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. Moreover, these bridging groups effectually provide planarity to the polymer backbone using different non-covalent interactions that can exist between the heteroatom of π-spacers and the donor or acceptor. 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BT) is the most extensively used acceptor unit for constructing D–A polymers, which have shown excellent photovoltaic properties. Eventually, the bandgap of the corresponding polymers is reduced by adjusting their non-planar backbone conformation to a planar structure.
Recently, different π-spacers including the aromatic rings varying from thiophene, selenophene, furan, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene were introduced into D–A type polymers. Depending on the π-spacer moiety, variation of the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties was observed. For instance the replacement of thiophene with selenophene as a π-spacer is viewed as one of the best approaches for synthesizing π-conjugated polymers with a narrow LBG in order to harvest more solar flux. It is clearly understood that by just simply varying the π-spacers, it is possible to modulate the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers, which in turn must have a significant effect on their photovoltaic properties. This motivated us to focus on seeking more information about the role of π-spacers in OPV research.
The photovoltaic properties of the π-conjugated polymers are not only dependent on the π-spacers but also on the type and position of solubilizing alkyl side chain attached to either electron rich or deficient part, since they can significantly affect the coplanarity, morphology, and photovoltaic parameters of the polymers. The fine architecture of alkyl side chains has to be addressed while designing new materials as these side chains play a crucial role in improving the molecular weight, solubility, and processability. Additionally, these alkyl chains can adjust intermolecular interactions and allow proper mixing with fullerene derivatives to form the desired morphology. Also, high priority should be given for the optimization of the alkyl side chain substituents to attain equilibrium between short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) to realize maximum PCE.
It is a fact that the nanoscale morphology of the active layer is one of the key parameters, which influences the photovoltaic performance of BHJ PSCs. In recent times, it has been reported that among the various device engineering methods, the PCE of PSCs can be significantly augmented by a simple methanol treatment method prior to the deposition of metal electrodes. Direct solvent exposure can influence the crystallinity, morphology, and electrical characteristics of semiconductors. A little amount of solvent that is added to the active layer will adjust the morphology in such a way to form a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network.
In this scenario, we report the design and synthesis of an array of four D–A polymers, P1–P4, comprising BDT with different side chain substituents (2-ethylhexylselenyl and 2-hexyldecylselenyl) and alternating dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) or diselenylbenzothiadiazole (DSeBT) repeating units in the polymer backbone. The combined effects of variation in the alkyl side chains and the π-spacer groups on the photovoltaic performance of the new BDTSe-based LBG polymers were investigated in detail. The difference in the π-spacers and length of side chains will have a significant influence on the optical, morphological, and intrinsic photovoltaic properties of the polymers. Additionally, we employed external additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and polar solvent (methanol) treatment to obtain high PCE.
The BHJ PSCs of P1–P4 showed significant improvement upon addition of DIO; along with methanol treatment it also showed its own way of improving the PCE of P1–P4. Especially P3-based PSCs showed a PCE of 5.63% after treating the active layers with methanol. Herein, we paid our additional attention to the study of enhanced PCE upon methanol treatment by electrical impedance spectroscopy, and found that device built-in potential is increased by diminishing the amount of surface traps.

2-Hexyldecylbromide, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c]thiadiazole (DTBT), and 4,7-bis(5-bromoselenophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c]thiadiazole (DSeBT) were synthesized according to the literature procedures. Selenophene, n-BuLi, 2-ethylhexylbromide, trimethyltin chloride, tert-BuLi, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium(0), and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd. The PC71BM was purchased from Solemme BV and the reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd and TCI, which were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Moisture sensitive reactions were conducted in the presence of a N2 atmosphere. The other materials were common chemicals and used as received. THF was dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use.



1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury Plus 300 MHz and 600 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. The chemical shifts were accounted in ppm related to the singlet of CDCl3 at 7.26 and 77 ppm for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Polymerization was conducted in a CEM focused microwave TM synthesis system (CEM Discover-S). The number average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a PL gel 5 μm MLXED-C column on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatography system with THF as an eluent and calibration with polystyrene standards. Thermal analysis was carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e, a DSC 822e analyzer under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses were carried out with a CHI 600C potentiostat (CH Instruments) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) in a diffractometer (D8-ADVANCE, Bruker) equipped with a Göbel mirror. The detector was scanned at the angle (2θ) from 0.1° to 35° with an incidence angle of 0.3°.


OTFT devices were fabricated in a bottom contact geometry (channel length = 12 μm and width = 120 μm). The source and drain contacts consisted of gold (100 nm), and the dielectric was silicon oxide (SiO2) with a thickness of 300 nm. The SiO2 surface was cleaned, dried, and pretreated with a solution of octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8, 1.0 mM) in toluene at room temperature for 2 h under N2 to produce nonpolar and smooth surfaces onto which the polymers could be spin coated. The polymers were dissolved to a concentration of 0.5 wt% in chloroform. Films of the organic semiconductors were spin coated at 1500 rpm for 50 s to a thickness of 50 nm, followed by an annealing process (140 °C for 10 min under a N2 atmosphere). All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature. The field effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime by using the equation IDS= (μWCi/2L)(VG − VT)2, where IDS is the drain–source current, μ is the field effect mobility, W is the channel width (120 μm), L is the channel length (12 μm), Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, and VG is the gate voltage.


The ITO coated glass substrates that have been used for fabrication were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Then, a 35 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was coated on the substrate. The coated buffer layer was cured at a temperature of 140 °C for 10 min in an oven. The active layer was spin coated using a mixture of polymer:PC71BM that was dissolved in 1 mL of CB and further mixed with 1 vol% DIO for additive study, whereas, methanol was spin coated on an active layer at 2400 rpm for 40 s as post-deposition treatment. 0.7 nm thick LiF and 100 nm thick Al cathode were deposited via evaporation on the active layer. The active area of the device was 0.09 cm2. The thickness of the thin films was measured using a KLA Tencor Alpha-step IQ surface profilometer with an accuracy of ±1 nm. AFM images were acquired in Park NX10 in tapping mode. The performance of PSCs was measured using a calibrated AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel® Sol3A™ Class AAA solar simulator, models 94043A) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 adjusted using a standard PV reference cell (2 cm × 2 cm, mono crystalline silicon solar cell, calibrated at NREL, Colorado, USA) and a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using an Oriel® IQE-200™. While measuring the J–V curves for PSCs, a black mask was used and only the effective area of the cell was exposed to light irradiation. The PSC device data reported in this article were confirmed for more than 5 iterations under the same conditions.


Impedance spectroscopy was performed with a VersaSTAT-3 (Princeton Applied Research) workstation with an AC signal of 25 mV in the frequency range of 500 Hz to 1 MHz. A constant DC bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of both pristine and methanol treated devices was applied. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed in the dark. The capacitance–voltage measurements were conducted at a frequency of 100 kHz and an AC bias of 25 mV.


Hole-only and electron-only mobility measurements were performed using a device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer (P3):PC71BM/MoO3/Al and ITO/Al/P3:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The mobility was determined by fitting the dark J–V curve into the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, based on the equation described by the Mott–Gurney law.

The synthetic routes to monomers and four polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 1a or 1b was reacted with n-butyllithium followed by the addition of 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDT) to form the corresponding intermediates 2a and 2b as a yellow viscous oil. 2a and 2b were finally distannylated by adding tert-butyllithium and trimethyltin chloride to afford monomers 3a and 3b as a yellow solid and semi-solid in a reasonable yield of 60 and 48%, respectively. Accordingly, four LBG π-conjugated polymers, P1–P4, were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction. The final distannylated products (3a and 3b) and P1–P4 were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S6) and elemental analysis. We used the microwave-assisted Stille polymerization method to achieve a high molecular weight for the resulting polymers. It was proven that the molecular weight of the polymers can be increased under microwave conditions. All polymerization reactions were conducted using Pd2(dba)3 as a catalyst and (o-tolyl)3P as the corresponding ligand. P1–P4 were readily soluble in organic solvents like chloroform (CF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), and chlorobenzene (CB) and the polymerization results are summarized in Table S1. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to estimate the thermal stability of P1–P4 and the results are listed in Table S1.P1–P4 possess better thermal stability with 5% weight loss with their decomposition temperatures (Td) being above 300 °C (Fig. S7).


The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of P1–P4 were recorded in CF solution and thin films as shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. All polymers show relatively broad absorption bands, which indicate that a significant part of solar flux is absorbed, contributing to photocurrent generation. P1–P4 showed two distinct absorption bands, which are characteristic of LBG polymers. The absorption band in the longer wavelength region corresponds to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between BDTSe and BT units and the shorter wavelength band represents the π–π* transition of the polymer backbone. The optical bandgaps of P1, P2, P3, and P4 were estimated from the onset absorption edge of the thin film absorption spectrum and were found to be 1.69, 1.63, 1.76, and 1.76 eV, respectively, as shown in Table 1. It is clearly manifested that the bandgap energy of the polymers (P1 and P2) with selenophene repeating entities is less than that of thiophene counterparts (P3 and P4). The thin film ICT absorption onset of selenophene bridged polymers (P1 and P2) is considerably red-shifted when compared to the thiophene counterparts (P3 and P4). This particular interesting feature divulges that the substitution of thiophene with selenophene as a π-spacer group reduces the bandgap owing to the enhanced quinoid nature of the polymer backbone. Interestingly, the absorption spectra of P3 in both solution and film state showed an enhanced shoulder peak in the longer wavelength regions, indicating that a more planar and ordered structure, and also strong interchain π–π stacking and intermolecular packing are present as compared to the other three polymers (P1, P2, and P4). The more planar structure of P3 is attributed to the non-covalent interactions that exist between the sulfur atom of the thiophene π-spacer and the oxygen atom of the dialkoxy group on the BT unit. Even though P4 has exactly a similar structure to P3, P4 shows a less pronounced shoulder peak, which might be due to the perturbation created by the sterically hindered lengthy hexyldecyl side chain compared to the ethylhexyl group on the polymer backbone ultimately, it can be expected that P3 will exhibit higher hole mobility than the rest of the polymers. It is quite interesting to note that P2 shows a very broad ICT band in the film state compared to their counterparts, indicating that the longer hexyldecyl chain is more favourable for efficient ICT interactions. Due to the strong withdrawing capacity of BT, the four polymers show decent LBGs, which is a key criterion to use them for photovoltaic applications. From the absorption profile of P1–P4, we can affirmatively state that the π-spacer and alkyl side chain play a substantial role in influencing the absorption profile of the polymers.

In order to prove the existence of strong aggregation between the polymer chains in P3, we conducted variable temperature UV-visible absorption spectra experiments at four different temperatures including 25, 45, 70, and 90 °C, respectively.
The clear change in the color of P3 in CB solution was observed at different temperatures and is shown in Fig. 2. Going from 25 to 90 °C, the intensity of the shoulder peak A at 641 nm decreased constantly and the other peak B at 590 nm progressively shifted towards a lower wavelength region. These captivating results validate that the pronounced aggregation of P3 formed in the room temperature solution is disturbed by the heating process, which will lead to a highly twisted and reduced planar structure for the polymer chains. Due to the strong interchain aggregation tendency of P3, it is expected that it would have better charge transport properties compared to other polymers.

CV was employed to estimate the energy levels of P1–P4, the corresponding cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S8 and the data are extracted from Table 1. The HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.26, −5.40, −5.20, and −5.22 eV from their onset oxidation potentials. All the polymers possess quite deeper HOMO energy levels, which are necessary for higher Voc, because the Voc is governed by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. The LUMO energy levels for P1, P2, P3, and P4 were found to be −3.57, −3.77, −3.44, and −3.46 eV, respectively. The LUMO values are reasonably higher than the LUMO energy level of PC71BM; this range is quite agreeable for efficient exciton dissociation from the polymers to PC71BM with a less charge recombination rate. The incorporation of the selenophene ring on BDT resulted in reasonable quite deeper HOMO levels for good air stability. Here, we observed that the alkyl side chains tethered to the π-conjugated backbone have less impact on the electronic energy levels.


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with Becke's three parameterized Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) exchange functional and 6-311+G(d,p) basis sets except for selenium atom for which the LANL2DZ effective core potentials were used. All the calculations were carried out using a suite of Gaussian 09 programs. The HOMOs and the LUMOs of all polymer repeating units are shown in Fig. S9. The orbital distributions clearly show the ICT between each donor and acceptor group. The HOMO energy levels of P1–P4 were calculated to be −5.13, −5.09, −5.12 and −5.14 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental values. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of P1–P4 were calculated to be 2.388, 2.396, 2.434, and 2.445 eV, respectively, which are higher than the experimental values, however, the tendency is consistent. In particular, the band gaps in selenophene bridged monomers P1 and P2 are smaller than those in thiophene bridged monomers P3 and P4 due to the enhanced quinoid nature in selenophene bridged systems as previously reported. The reason for the overestimation of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap in our calculation is that polymer repeating unit geometries were used to compare the polymer systems due to the computational cost.


The field effect hole mobility (μhole) of thin films of P1–P4 was measured by fabricating organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). The OTFTs were fabricated on a silicon wafer using bottom contact geometry with channel length (12 μm) and width (120 μm) under a N2 atmosphere. Fig. S10 shows the transfer characteristics of the devices fabricated using the polymers as the active layer, which were annealed at 140 °C and the related data are mentioned in Table S2. The polymers should have high charge carrier mobility, as it is very important for achieving better device performance. The OTFTs fabricated with the new polymers as a photoactive layer proved to have p-type transistor characteristics.

The OTFTs fabricated using P1, P2, P3, and P4 exhibited hole mobilities (μhole) of 5.5 × 10−3, 2.3 × 10−3, 7.3 × 10−3, and 3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The P3 thin film showed the highest μhole among the four polymers, which can be attributed to strong polymer chain packing and enhanced planarity attained by the interaction between the sulfur atom in the thiophene π-spacer and the oxygen atom of the dialkoxy group in BT. The mobility data clearly show that the polymers with shorter ethylhexyl side chains (P1 and P3) possess high μhole, as compared to the polymers with longer hexyldecyl side chains (P2 and P4) (for the fixed alkyl chains on the electron deficient DTBT or DSeBT unit). The lengthy 2-hexyldecyl groups on the BDTSe unit may increase the steric hindrance and make the polymers difficult to pack efficiently, which is very crucial in transporting the holes inside the polymer films. The lowest crystallinity of P4 was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction pattern of the polymer films (shown in Fig. S11). This is also consistent with the photovoltaic performance of the tested devices (without 1 vol% DIO). It is worth stating that the μhole values of these polymers are close or above the suggested value (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). This means that the loss of photocurrent is reduced and thus high performance will be expected for the OPV devices.

We fabricated OPV devices to demonstrate the strength of our newly designed polymers as donor materials in BHJ device architecture using PC71BM as an acceptor and the effects of π-spacers and alkyl side chains were investigated. The device structure employed is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al and the photovoltaic performances were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic performances of the OPV devices were tested under various conditions. CB was used as a processing solvent, the devices fabricated using P1 and P2 displayed high Jsc and PCE at a ratio of 1:2, whereas the devices based on P3 and P4 showed high Jsc and PCE at a composite ratio of 1:1. Fig. 3a–c show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ PSCs of pristine, 1 vol% of DIO, and methanol treatment. The photovoltaic parameters of devices obtained under the best optimized conditions are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The optimum thickness of the BHJ thin films was found to be approximately in the range of 85–90 nm for P1 and P3 and 95–100 nm for P2 and P4. The device based on the P1:PC71BM (1:2 wt%) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 9.04 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 42.99% with a reasonable PCE of 2.56% and the device based on the P2:PC71BM (1:2 wt%) blend demonstrated a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 7.36 mA cm−2, and an FF of 43.15% with a PCE of 2.27%. However, the device based on the P3:PC71BM (1:1 wt%) blend exhibited a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 10.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 52.66% with a moderate PCE of 4.09% and the device based on the P4:PC71BM (1:1 wt%) blend demonstrated a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 7.95 mA cm−2, and an FF of 51.16% with a PCE of 2.92%.

Interestingly, pristine devices based on P3:PC71BM have shown the highest Jsc followed by greater PCE. Another intriguing result that needs to be addressed is the FF for the device based on P3:PC71BM (1:1 wt%). The P3-based device exhibited a high FF of 52.66% when compared to the devices based on the other three polymers. This could be due to the high μhole of 7.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained from the OTFT results.
When pristine CB was used as a processing solvent for the device fabrication, P3 and P4-based devices (thiophene as a π-spacer) dominated the P1 and P2-based devices (selenophene as a π-spacer) in terms of PCE. We ascribe this phenomenon to the higher FF values of the P3 and P4-based devices. The OPV devices with the hexyldecyl side chain exhibited low PCE, when compared to the devices with the ethylhexyl side chain. We assume that too lengthy and bulkiness of the side chains reduce the miscibility of the polymer with PC71BM, leading to excessive phase separation between polymer chains and PC71BM molecules and thereby reducing the interfacial areas for charge separation in P2 and P4-based solar cells. The related smaller currents lead to the diminished OPV performances in the case of P2 or P4. The 2-hexyldecyl side chains weakened the intermolecular interactions thus leading to low Jsc for P2 and P4-based devices, whereas the 2-ethylhexyl group preserved the interactions, concomitantly gave better Jsc for P1 and P3. Particularly, P3 shows a decent PCE of 4.09% for the pristine blend film due to higher Jsc, FF, and Voc than that of its counterparts. This can be comprehended by the planar backbone of P3 that drives to form a better interpenetrating network in the active layer. The FF values of thiophene bridged polymers (P3 and P4) are higher than those of selenophene bridged polymers (P1 and P2). This phenomenon indicates that more charge trapped sites are present in selenophene bridged polymers, which hamper the charge collection at the corresponding electrodes.
There have been reports that the FF and Jsc of OPV devices could be greatly improved by using additives such as DIO and CN by forming excellent morphology of the active layer. To further improve the photovoltaic performance of P1, P2, P3, and P4, an optimal amount of DIO (1 vol%) was introduced. These high boiling additives can adjust the morphology to attain nanoscale phase separation of the polymer:PC71BM blends during spin coating and consequently significant improvement in PCE could be visualized. Surprisingly, interesting observations were recognised after introducing an optimum amount (1 vol%) of DIO. We observed PCEs of 5.07, 5.34, 4.16, and 4.30% for the devices of P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively. The most efficient P2-based device, obtained using 1% DIO, had an average PCE of. 5.34%, with a Jsc of 12.22 mA cm−2, a FF of 59.35%, and a Voc of 0.73 V. The effect of DIO is much strongly pronounced in the case of devices based on P1 and P2, when compared to P3 and P4. However, the overall PCE was increased for all devices based on P1, P2, P3, and P4 after adding 1% DIO. The change of PCE is primarily due to the improved FF and Jsc. P1 and P2-based devices displayed significantly increased Jsc and FF (as shown in Table 2) leading to higher device performances. We presume that DIO facilitated the polymer:PC71BM phase separation and increased intermolecular packing to realize high PCE for the OPV devices. After adding DIO, the establishment of appropriate phase separation in the films of P3 and P4-based devices is less effective than that of P1 and P2, which could be the reason for less improved efficiency. We tested the OPV performance of BHJ PSCs by adding more than 1% DIO, but we did not observe any promising results. We also tested BHJ PSCs with CN as an additional additive and obtained moderately high PCE; the photovoltaic properties of P1–P4 were improved compared to their neat blends except in P3, and the resulting photovoltaic properties are displayed in Table S3.
It is well proven that the nanoscale phase separation of the thin film active layer of PSCs will occur, when the methanol treatment method is applied to BHJ PSCs. Here we also tried to employ methanol treatment to further optimize the photovoltaic properties of P1–P4 based PSCs. The general process of methanol treatment involves a few steps like spin coating the active layers followed by addition of a small amount of methanol on top of it and wait for a few seconds and spinning the device at high rpm to spin off the methanol. To our surprise, after methanol treatment on P1–P4 based devices, P3 showed much improved photovoltaic performance compared to the other polymer blends.
The PCE of P3 increased from 4.09 to 5.63% with an enhanced Jsc (13.64 from 10.93 mA cm−2) and FF (55.62% from 52.66%). These enhanced photovoltaic properties of P3 based PSCs are because of the fact that methanol much effectively fine tuned the active layer morphology of P3 compared to others. Consequently, the charge mobility will be increased due to the excellent BHJ interface for charge dissociation and collection, thus delivering a high Jsc, FF, and PCE for the corresponding PSC device. We assume that the enhanced backbone planarity of P3 could be the reason for easy migration of PC71BM molecules after methanol treatment. The enhancement of photovoltaic performance due to the effect of methanol treatment P3 was further analyzed deeply by electrical impedance spectroscopy and SCLC mobility study.

Fig. 4a–c show the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on polymer:PC71BM without and with 1 vol% DIO and methanol treated devices. As shown in Fig. 4, the EQE curves of the devices show that the OPV devices have a good response to the sunlight over the range of 350 to 750 nm. The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices based on polymer:PC71BM are similar to their absorption spectra. This indicates that a major amount of the absorbed photons of the polymers contributes to the photocurrent generation. The EQE plots of the devices with DIO showed a much higher photovoltaic response than those without DIO. This may be due to the establishment of the improved morphology by efficient intermixing of the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor compared to their pristine counterparts. And the methanol treated devices also showed enhanced EQE spectra compared to their pristine counterparts. Particularly, P3 based PSCs showed a much enhanced EQE spectrum after methanol treatment which correlated well with the enhanced Jsc. The Jsc values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra concur well with Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements.

The morphology of the photoactive layer plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs along with other photo-physical properties and in several situations the performance of the device strongly depends on its morphological features. To gain more understanding of the effect of the additive and alkyl side chains on the morphology of the P1–P4 blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of active layers of the optimized devices with and without DIO were taken and the corresponding AFM images are shown in Fig. 5. We encountered different morphological scenarios upon addition of 1 vol% DIO to the four polymer blends at their optimized ratios, After adding DIO, a well-developed morphology and better interpenetrating network of P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P4:PC71BM are accomplished, as compared to those of P3:PC71BM which are highly beneficial to the charge transport. The DIO, which is added to the active layer, encouraged to form more specific and aggregated donor polymer domains. Ultimately, a favourable charge separated state will occur in the BHJ network, this will give good support to the movement of free charges to the corresponding electrodes. The excellent percolation path for the movement of free charges is clearly evidenced by the increased FF and Jsc values after the addition of DIO. Overall the suitable morphology of the blend films is consistent with the higher photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P1, P2, P3, and P4. AFM studies were carried out for the methanol treated active layers to understand the surface morphology after methanol treatment, a common phenomenon observed among all active layers, i.e. root mean square (RMS) roughness slightly increased due to PC71BM aggregation and in the case of P3 mixing was much homogeneously occurred as shown in Fig. 5.

The X-ray diffraction technique was used to test the crystalline properties of polymer thin films, and XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S11. From the data, it was observed that P1–P4 thin films are found to be low crystalline in nature. Further, P4 shows very weak crystallinity among the four polymers, which is in agreement with the low hole mobility of P4.

The enhancement of photovoltaic performance due to the effect of methanol treatment in P3 was analyzed using impedance spectroscopy.Fig. 6a displays the 3D perspective plot depicting the dependence of the real and imaginary part of impedance on frequency; the real and imaginary part of the impedance are the resistance and reactance, respectively. The X–Y, Y–Z and X–Z planes in the 3D plot show the resistance vs. frequency, the reactance vs. frequency characteristics and the Nyquist plot, respectively. The Nyquist plots of impedance measurement of the P3:PC71BM device along with the corresponding equivalent circuit (EC) are shown in Fig. 6b under both pristine and methanol treated conditions. These plots were substantially consistent with fitting curves simulated by an EC. Rs corresponds to series resistance consisting of ohmic components. R1 and C1 correspond to bulk resistance and capacitance, whereas R2 and C2 correspond to depletion layer functioning. The methanol treated device has a significantly reduced bulk resistance as indicated by the decreased radius in the Nyquist plot. The bulk resistance can be obtained from the diameter of the semicircle on the “ReZ” axis. This result indicates that the methanol treatment reduced the interface resistance between the active layer and cathode, leading to a lower device resistance. In addition, the intercept on the “ReZ” axis at high frequencies in Nyquist plots gives the series resistance. Following methanol treatment, Rs is reduced from 4.48 to 3.12 Ω cm2 for P3. This agrees with the observed increase in Jsc and FF. A semiconductor has a charge carrier concentration (N), which effects the distribution of the electric fields within the device. If the carrier concentration is within a certain range, then a Schottky contact is formed at the metal–semiconductor interface and a built-in potential (Vbi) is present. To estimate Vbi, the C–V characteristics were examined using the following Mott–Schottky equation, C−2 = 2(Vbi − V)/A2eεrε0N. Here, V, e, εr, ε0, N, A, and C, respectively, denote the bias voltage, charge, relative dielectric constant (εr = 3), permittivity in vacuum, charge carrier concentration, device active area, and capacitance for each bias voltage. The linear region under low forward bias is related to the formation of a Schottky contact and can be fitted to a plot of C−2versus bias voltage. Vbi can be evaluated by extrapolation of C−2 = 0, whereas the slope of the line gives the charge carrier concentration with the equation, N = −2/slopeA2eεrε0 derived from the Mott–Schottky equation. The methanol treated device shows higher Vbi and a pronounced increase in N as shown in Fig. 7a. Vbi, which plays a key role in the internal electric field in BHJ PSCs, is an important parameter and gives the upper limit for Voc. Vbi is also considered to be responsible for exciton dissociation. Thus, the increase in Vbi may be responsible for the increase in Voc in the devices with methanol treatment. The higher order of N in the case of the methanol treated device showed an enhanced surface charge density. An important aspect resulting from the Mott–Schottky analysis is the depletion zone width (w) at zero applied bias,
w = (2ε(Vbi − V)/eN)1/2.
In the dark at negative bias as shown in Fig. 7b, the depletion layer gets bigger than the thickness of the device, and the capacitance should not change anymore. It is clearly manifested in Table 4 that the depletion width practically reaches the anode for the methanol untreated devices, whereas it is comparatively reduced for methanol treated devices and is pictorially represented in Fig. 8. The intrinsic p-doped nature of the semiconducting polymer leads to the formation of Schottky contact upon deposition of the metal electrode onto the active layer of the BHJ. EF is the Fermi level of the p-type semiconducting polymer which is lower than the Fermi level of the metal in a Schottky diode as shown in Fig. 8a, where ϕm is the work function of the metal electrode. If there is a contact between the metal and the semiconductor, respective charges will move across the interfaces to provide an equilibrium uniform Fermi level as shown in Fig. 8b and c. In the semiconductor region close to the metal contact there are no mobile charges anymore and this region is called the depletion layer and has width w. For a connected system in the dark, the depletion width (w = 88 nm) reaches the anode (active layer thickness) for the pristine device (Fig. 8b), whereas it is reduced (w = 72 nm) for MeOH treated devices (Fig. 8c). This is mainly because of the difference in doping between the pristine and methanol treated devices. The higher doped layers confine the electrical field in the vicinity of the cathode, allowing extraction of Vbi and N.

We observed a dramatic increase in the Jsc and FF of the PSCs after the methanol treatment method. To understand this the SCLC model was employed to investigate the charge transport properties. The hole and electron mobilities of P3 based devices were improved to 3.62 × 10−4 and 2.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 from 2.16 × 10−4 and 1.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s—1, respectively, after methanol treatment, which correlated well with the increased Jsc and FF. It is concluded that increased carrier mobility of BHJ PSCs of P3 after methanol treatment results in high Jsc and FF and thus resulting in high PCE.

In summary, we have studied systematically how the alkyl side chain variation and the different π-spacer groups affect the optical, charge carrier, and photovoltaic properties of BDTSe-based π-conjugated polymers. The existence of both non-covalent interactions between the sulfur atom in thiophene and the oxygen atom in dialkoxyBT and shorter ethylhexyl side chains in P3 makes it a highly planar backbone structure among the four polymers. When shorter ethylhexyl side chains are replaced with longer hexyldecyl side chains, it resulted in a significant effect on the hole mobility of the polymers. This illustrates that the alkyl side chain substituents can significantly impact the polymer packing for better charge transport. The device fabrication results revealed that by modulating the processing conditions via usage of external additives like DIO during device fabrication, suitable rearrangement of the BHJ network occurs in such a way to attain higher PCE. Consequently, when P1, P2, P3, and P4 were blended with PC71BM in a BHJ fashion, PCEs of 5.07%, 5.34%, 4.16%, and 4.30% were accomplished for the devices based on P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively. In addition, methanol treatment also showed improved PCE for P1–P4 and delivered a high PCE of 5.63% for P3. On account of the intriguing results that have been perceived, we conclude about the design of our current research work: (1) the disparity in the size of the alkyl side chain is a very important parameter for designing efficient PSC materials, as they can significantly impact charge transport; (2) the nature of the π-spacer inserted between the electron rich and electron deficient units influences the planarity of the polymer backbone; (3) implementing suitable device fabrication conditions like usage of external additives or polar solvent exposure like methanol improves the miscibility of the polymer with PC71BM to obtain a well organized interpenetrating network to realize high PCE. Having potential applications for PSCs, investigation into further augmentation of the PCE of these polymers is underway.
