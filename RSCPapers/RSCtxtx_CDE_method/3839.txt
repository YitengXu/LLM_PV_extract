The oligomer-type small molecule PDT2FBT-ID is applied in a polymer/small molecule/fullerene ternary system. The PTB7-Th/PDT2FBT-ID/PC71BM ternary active layer shows complementary absorption spectra, enhanced face-on orientation and energy transfer properties. Compared to the binary system, the FF of the ternary system is improved from 66.72% to 76.14% and the Jsc is improved from 17.90 mA cm−2 to 18.92 mA cm−2. The maximum PCE of 11.1% is obtained in the ternary system with a common inverted device structure. Additionally, an alloy-like domain structure and energy transfer between the two donor materials are found to coexist in the ternary system. Based on the combined model, the variation in morphology and Voc is discussed in detail and compared with previous publications. An in-depth interpretation for the selection of a third compound in high performance ternary organic solar cells is provided. Finally, this facile design strategy could also be widely used in other systems.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for solar energy conversion, which possess unique properties, such as flexibility, color diversity and light weight and can be used in low-cost printing techniques. The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) is the most efficient active layer structure, which could extend the interfacial area and promote exciton separation by blending a donor (D) material with an acceptor (A) material to form interpenetrating networks. In the past decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary BHJ organic solar cells has reached up to 11–12% due to the discovery of excellent donor and acceptor materials. However, the PCE of BHJ organic solar cells is strongly limited by binary components due to the difficulties in balancing absorption range, crystallization and compatibility of D/A materials. Recently, ternary organic solar cells have attracted considerable attention in the photovoltaic field because they integrate the advantages of wide absorption in tandem devices and one-step solution processes in BHJ devices. Benefitting from the development of high PCE binary systems, the appropriate selection of a third component and device engineering, the PCEs of ternary solar cells have also reached approximately 12%.

In general, ternary solar cells can facilitate charge transfer or energy transfer, and their mesophase can be described by the parallel or alloy model according to the different structures and functions of their three components. The improved PCEs in ternary solar cells could be attributed to their wider absorption range, more carrier channels, cascade energy levels and optimal morphology, etc. Similar to binary systems, the device performance of ternary systems is significantly influenced by blend morphology, which determines the charge carrier transport pathway. However, the introduction of a third component complicates the working mechanism and some of the third components could act as traps for charge carriers. Therefore, the existing state and intermixing of the third component in the active layer still need to be explored, which are instructively important for designing and improving device performances.
To gain insight into the working mechanism and ultimately achieve a high PCE, various systems for ternary OSCs have been investigated. The poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) combination is a typical high performance binary system, which has been extensively studied as a reference in ternary OSCs. Our previous work showed that PTB7-Th could form an alloy with the small molecule 7,7-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo-[c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTH2)2), the face-on orientation of PTB7-Th is improved, and an average PCE of 10.5% is obtained for the ternary OSC. Due to the strong crystallinity of the small molecule, p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 begins to crystallize at a low proportion (20%). For this reason, the performance of the ternary system is studied below the best doping ratio (15%). However, information beyond the best doping ratio is also significant and instructive. Herein, we blend an oligomer-type small molecule (PDT2FBT-ID) into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary active layer with an inverted device structure (Fig. 1). The molecular structures of PDT2FBT-ID, PTB7-Th and PC71BM are also shown in Fig. 1. The highest PCE of 11.10% for the ternary device with 20% PDT2FBT-ID is achieved without further device engineering, which suggests an efficient strategy to obtain high performance organic solar cells using the ternary system.
A series of oligomer-type small molecules was designed and synthesized in our previous work and the influence of the conjugation length on the performance of the oligomers was systemically investigated. Moreover, the compatibility between oligomer-type small molecules and other molecules could also be tuned by controlling different conjugation lengths and end-capping acceptors. Among them, the A–D–A–D–A structured PDT2FBT-ID shows the highest performance and exhibits particular features which motivated us to apply it in the ternary system. These features are as follows: (1) complementary absorption range with PTB7-Th. The absorption edge of PDT2FBT-ID is located at 720 nm, which helps to supplement the weak absorption of PTB7-Th in this range and harvest more photos. (2) Strong extinction coefficient. PDT2FBT-ID shows a strong extinction coefficient and photoluminescence intensity. More importantly, the emission spectrum of PDT2FBT-ID substantially overlaps with the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th, which means potential energy transfer from PDT2FBT-ID to PTB7-Th. (3) Ordered aggregation and strong crystallinity. PTB7-Th shows relatively weak crystallinity, which results in to uniform but small-size domains. Although PTB7-Th prefers the face-on structure, its weak crystallinity influences the path of exciton dissociation and diffusion. It has been demonstrated that a highly crystalline small molecule can increase the face-on orientation of PTB7-Th, which is beneficial for charge transfer and fill factor (FF). Considering all these characteristics, we blended PDT2FBT-ID into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer and this approach created a remarkable positive impact. Although the open circuit voltage (Voc) was limited by the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system, the short circuit current (Jsc) and FF were increased simultaneously, resulting in a high PCE in the ternary device.


Fig. 1c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM blend film with different doping ratios. The blend films show a complementary absorption range from 500 nm to 800 nm, which is beneficial for the generation of light-induced excitons. With an increase in the content of PDT2FBT-ID, the absorption intensity in the range of 480 nm to 680 nm was enhanced. Additionally, the maximum absorption peak of PTB7-Th was noticed to have slightly red-shifted from 705 nm to 720 nm when 20% PDT2FBT-ID was blended. This phenomenon could be one evidence supporting the enhancement of aggregation.Fig. 1d shows the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PTB7-Th, PDT2FBT-ID and PC71BM measured via cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO level of PTB7-Th is −5.24 eV, which is higher than that of PDT2FBT-ID (−5.28 eV). The LUMO levels are −3.62 eV and −3.33 eV for PTB7-Th and PDT2FBT-ID, respectively.


The photovoltaic performance of the ternary devices fabricated with different doping ratios was measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Chlorobenzene (CB) was chosen as the solution and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as the solution additive in this study. The D:A ratio (PTB7-Th and PDT2FBT-ID to PC71BM) was kept at 1:1.1 (Table S1). The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1 and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a and S1. The PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system was 9.63% with a Jsc of 17.90 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.803 V and FF of 66.72%. The PCE of PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM was 3.07% and the Jsc and FF were 5.83 mA cm−2 and 56.39%, respectively. Since the crystallinity of PDT2FBT-ID is too strong in the high boiling point CB solution, the performance of PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM is much lower than that in chloroform (9.25%). The maximum PCE was 11.10% at the PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM weight ratio of 80:20:110 with 1.5% DIO (volume ratio) additive. Under the optimized conditions, the FF was improved from 66.72% to 76.14% and the Jsc was improved from 17.90 mA cm−2 to 18.92 mA cm−2. The Voc of the ternary system was limited by the small Voc value of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. Meanwhile, the Voc decreased slightly from 0.803 V to 0.770 V as the doping ratio of PDT2FBT-ID increased from 5% to 20%. Based on previous literature, the decrease in Voc could be attributed to the enhanced PTB7-Th crystallinity, which reduces the distance of the polymer chains and increases the HOMO levels. When the doping ratio of PDT2FBT-ID exceeded 40%, the Voc returned to the value of the binary system (0.802 V), whereas the Jsc and FF began to decrease. The average PCE obtained at the optimized condition was 10.91%, which was certified by an accredited laboratory who certified a PCE of 10.5% (Fig. S9). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the ternary solar cells are shown in Fig. 2b and S1b. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system showed a wide EQE range from 300 nm to 800 nm. As PDT2FBT-ID was added, the EQE value in the region of 400–700 nm increased obviously. The enhanced EQE can be ascribed to the absorption of PDT2FBT-ID and PC71BM, which means more effective utilization of light by adding PDT2FBT-ID. Meanwhile, the EQE peak at 750 nm showed a slight red-shift with 5–20% PDT2FBT-ID and then faded gradually as the PTB7-Th content was further reduced, which is consistent with the tendency observed in the UV-vis absorption spectra.

The photoluminescence spectra of the PTB7-Th neat films and PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID blend films were measured (Fig. S2). The excited wavelength was 610 nm and the blend films thickness was controlled at 100 nm. As shown in Fig. 2c, PDT2FBT-ID displays a broad and strong emission range from 650 nm to 850 nm covering the absorption range of PTB7-Th, which is a prerequisite for energy transfer. In Fig. S2a, the photoluminescence intensity (PL intensity) of the corresponding PTB7-Th neat films without PDT2FBT-ID decreased gradually. However, in the PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID blend films, as shown in Fig. S2b, the PL intensity of PTB7-Th increased and the emission peak of PDT2FBT-ID quenched completely, which clearly illustrates the transfer of fluorescence emitted by PDT2FBT-ID to PTB7-Th. At 10% and 20% PDT2FBT-ID (Fig. 2c), the tendency of increase was hindered, which is inconsistent with previous publications on other ternary organic solar cells. The decrease in PL intensity of PTB7-Th is possibly the result of aggregation induced quenching. As observed in the UV-vis absorption and GIWAXS results, the crystallinity of PTB7-Th was enhanced when it was blended with PDT2FBT-ID, and the enhanced aggregation led to fluorescence quenching. As the amount of PDT2FBT-ID increased, the reduction in PL intensity could be compensated by additional PDT2FBT-ID, leading to a reinforcement in PL intensity from 30% PDT2FBT-ID. The PL intensity reached the highest point when 70% PDT2FBT-ID was added. As the content of PDT2FBT-ID was further increased from 70% to 95%, an obvious left-shift and gradual decline could be observed from the highest peak. This phenomenon is possibly caused by the saturation of the energy transfer from PDT2FBT-ID to PTB7-Th, thus the emission peak of PDT2FBT-ID emerged. Due to the strong extinction coefficient of PDT2FBT-ID and energy transfer, more light could be absorbed and utilized by the blend films, which is beneficial for photocurrent.

The function of photocurrent (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) was measured to gain insights into the exciton dissociation and transport process of the ternary system (Fig. S3). Jph = JL − JD, where, JL is the current under illumination and JD is the dark current. Veff = V0 − V, where, V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and V is the applied voltage. Jph reaches its saturation value at high voltage (Veff = 1.8 V), at which all generated electron–hole pairs are assumed to be dissociated and collected with minimal recombination. The charge dissociation probability (P(E,T)) can be determined by Jph/Jsat. At the maximum power point (Mpp), the P(E,T) values of PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM blend film with 0%, 10%, 20%, 50% PDT2FBT-ID were 74.5%, 78.5% and 81.0%, and 73.1%, respectively. The results indicate that on the Mpp condition, the introduction of PDT2FBT-ID facilitates exciton dissociation and transfer, which is beneficial for improving FF.

To analyze the recombination mechanism, we measured the photocurrents (Jph) following a power-law dependence on light intensity on a log–log scale (Jph ∝ LS), where S is power-law scaling exponent (Fig. 2d). In general, linear scaling of photocurrent with light intensity would suggest weak bimolecular recombination. As shown in the Fig. 2d, the fitted slopes (S) of PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM blend film with 0%, 10%, 20%, 50% PDT2FBT-ID were 0.968, 0.981, 1.006 and 0.973 respectively at 0.2 V effective voltage. This result indicates that the incorporation of PDT2FBT-ID could further reduce the bimolecular recombination compared with the PTB7-Th binary system. The hole and electron mobility of the ternary active layer were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4). The diode devices were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al for hole mobility and electron mobility respectively, whose results are listed in Table S2. The mobility of PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM measured based on the films obtained from chloroform solution, were 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for hole mobility and 1.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron mobility (Fig. S5). The hole mobility of PTB7-Th:PC71BM film was increased from 4.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the electron mobility was increased from 3.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 7.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when 20% PDT2FBT-ID was added.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to study the morphology of active layer. All the films were prepared from CB solution. CB is an appropriate solution for the dominant PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, however, it is an inappropriate solution for PDT2FBT-ID. As shown in Fig. 3h, the quality of PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM film spin-coated from CB solution was considerably poor, which is the main reason for the low performance of PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM devices. PTB7-Th:PC71BM film showed uniform morphology with fibrous structure, and the domain size was relatively small (10–15 nm, Fig. 3a). With addition of PDT2FBT-ID, larger domain with well-maintained fibrous structure was obtained. Furthermore, domain size at approximately 20 nm is more appropriate for exciton dissociation and transfer, which contributes to the improvement of FF. Moreover, the morphology didn't change significantly as the doping ratio of PDT2FBT-ID increased from 5% to 30%, suggesting a finite amount of PDT2FBT-ID could be well tolerated by the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system. When the PDT2FBT-ID was added beyond 40%, the small molecules began to aggregate and formed large cluster of PDT2FBT-ID crystalline (Fig. 3f–g). The appearance of large cluster of PDT2FBT-ID crystalline could influence the ordination of PTB7-Th, resulting in poor device performance. The AFM images (Fig. S6) were consistent with the TEM results. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of blend films became larger with increasing proportion of PDT2FBT-ID, indicating a larger domain size.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was further applied to provide more insight into the length scale of morphology and phase separation, the photon energy of 284.2 eV was selected (Fig. 4). The PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary blend film showed a scattering peak at q = 0.23 nm−1, which means approximately 13 nm domain size (domain size is half of the characteristic length scale), whereas, the PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM blend film exhibited main scattering peaks at q = 0.009 nm−1, which means approximately 350 nm domain size (Fig. S7). As 30% PDT2FBT-ID was added, the scattering peaks of PTB7-Th shifted to 0.20 nm−1, indicating the larger domain sizes of the PTB7-Th (ca. 16 nm for PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM 80:20:110 film, and ca. 17 nm for PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM 70:30:110 film). When the proportion of PDT2FBT-ID was increased to 40%, the scattering peak of PTB7-Th and PDT2FBT-ID could be observed in the same curve, which means individual regions of PTB7-Th and PDT2FBT-ID form in the blend film. This tendency was consistent with the TEM and AFM results. Moreover, the total scattering intensity (TSI, obtained by integrating the scattering profiles over the q range) was obviously enhanced when 30% PDT2FBT-ID was added, suggesting a purer domain compared with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary film. The relative purities of 0% and 20% PDT2FBT-ID films were 0.8 and 0.9, respectively, comparing with 30% PDT2FBT-ID film. Overall, the presence of PDT2FBT-ID contributes to the increase in domain size and domain purity, which are beneficial for exciton dissociation and transfer, reducing the bimolecular recombination. The optimized morphology and phase separation scale should be the main reasons for the improved FF.
GIWAXS was used to probe the molecular orientation and crystallinity of the active layer. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of ternary blends are shown in Fig. 5a–h, and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane curves are given in Fig. 5i–j respectively. PTB7-Th preferred the face-on orientation with respect to the substrate, which is beneficial for the charge transport. However, the π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction was not obvious, which means a weak crystallinity, resulting in relatively low FF of PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system. In addition, PDT2FBT-ID is a remarkable edge-on orientation molecule with strong crystallinity, as revealed by the sharp (100), (200) peak in the out-of-plane direction and (010) peak in the in-plane direction. In Fig. 5i, the (100) peaks of PTB7-Th and PDT2FBT-ID were located at 2.65 nm−1 and 3.99 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction, respectively, indicating the different lamellar distance (2.36 nm for PTB7-Th and 1.57 nm for PDT2FBT-ID). Moreover, the (100) peak of PDT2FBT-ID could be detected from the film of PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM 70:30:110, coexisting with PTB7-Th crystalline. With the increased proportion of PDT2FBT-ID from 5% to 30%, the π–π stacking (010) peak of PTB7-Th became increasingly obvious. The peaks position also slightly shifted from 16.46 nm−1 to 17.52 nm−1, demonstrating the formation of closer π–π distance (from 0.38 nm to 0.35 nm). The correlation lengths were calculated using the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the scattering peaks based on the Scherrer equation. The FWHMs of the blend films were calculated by fitting the (010) peaks with Gaussian equation (Fig. S8). The crystalline size of PTB7-Th with 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% PDT2FBT-ID were 1.59 nm, 1.65 nm, 1.93 nm and 2.07 nm respectively, suggesting stronger face-on crystallization. However, when the proportion of PDT2FBT-ID exceeded 40%, the (010) peak of PTB7-Th weakened and gradually disappeared, as a result of the decrease in the amount of PTB7-Th and the disruption of PTB7-Th aggregation due to PDT2FBT-ID crystalline at high blending ratio, which was consistent with TEM and AFM results.
As described above, the performance of ternary system was improved significantly under the proportion of 30% PDT2FBT-ID, and no obvious PDT2FBT-ID crystalline peaks could be detected in GIWAXS results. The following two reasons could be proposed: (1) the amount of PDT2FBT-ID crystalline is too small to be detected; (2) PDT2FBT-ID exists in the active layer in amorphous state. To identify the exact state of PDT2FBT-ID in the blend film, the PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID, PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM binary films with different weight ratio of PDT2FBT-ID was tested. To exclude the possibility that a small amount of PDT2FBT-ID crystalline could not be detected, the solution concentration and film process was controlled to keep same with the ternary devices. From the Fig. 6a, the (100) peaks of PTB7-Th were obvious, however, the PDT2FBT-ID crystalline peak (100) could only be detected in PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID 70:30 film, consistent with the ternary film PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM (Fig. 5i). In the PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM film (Fig. 6b), strong PDT2FBT-ID crystalline peak could be detected even at the lowest proportion of PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM 5:110. The same phenomenon was observed in the in-plane direction (Fig. 6c) where the (010) peak of PDT2FBT-ID could be detected from PDT2FBT-ID:PC71BM 10:110 film, however, the (010) peak of PDT2FBT-ID could only be detected in the proportion of PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID 70:30. Therefore, the high-crystalline edge-on orientation small molecule PDT2FBT-ID is more likely to disperse in the PTB7-Th phase uniformly instead of migrating into clusters when the doping ratio is lower than 30%.
From the perspective of structure, the small molecule PDT2FBT-ID mixed well with the polymer PTB7-Th, leading enhanced face-on packing of PTB7-Th and purer domain. The same phenomenon is found in previous publications of alloy model ternary solar cells. However, in previous alloy model ternary systems, the Voc is located between the polymer/PCBM and small molecule/PCBM binary system. In this work, energy transfer from small molecule to polymer was established. Even the small molecule PDT2FBT-ID began to crystallize at 30%, the Voc values from 5% to 70% PDT2FBT-ID were still close to the lower PTB7-Th/PC71BM binary system, which is inconsistent with traditional alloy model. As the PDT2FBT-ID exceeded 70%, the energy transfer reached the saturation point, and Voc began to increase, which can be explained by “mixed phase:small molecule:fullerene” model. So based on the photoluminescence spectrum, GIWAXS and R-SoXS results, a reasonable inference could be drawn: due to the weak crystallinity of PTB7-Th, considerable amorphous region besides the crystalline region exists in the PTB7-Th domains. The small amount of PDT2FBT-ID (less than 30%) is more likely to disperse in the amorphous region of PTB7-Th and induce the disordered PTB7-Th chains to crystallize without breaking the existing crystalline (leading to larger domain size and alloy-like domain structure in the amorphous region of PTB7-Th). The alloy-like domain structure and energy transfer mechanism coexist in the ternary system, improving the FF and Jsc, however, limiting the Voc (from 5–70% PDT2FBT-ID).

Ternary system has been proved as an efficient strategy to improve the performance of OSCs. Due to the introduction of the third component, the working mechanism of ternary organic solar cells becomes much more complicated and the influence factors on device optimization could be multiple. In this work, the small molecule PDT2FBT-ID was blended in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer, which showed complementary absorption spectra, enhanced face-on orientation and energy transfer property. As a result, FF was improved from 66.72% to 76.14% and Jsc was improved from 17.90 mA cm−2 to 18.92 mA cm−2. A maximum PCE of 11.1% was obtained with inverted device structure in ternary system, which is much higher than that of PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary organic solar cells (9.63%). Moreover, detailed microstructure investigation was explored. The small molecule PDT2FBT-ID was speculated to disperse in the PTB7-Th amorphous range, and induce the crystallinity of PTB7-Th in the face-on direction. Alloy-like domain structure and energy transfer model were found coexist in the ternary system, optimizing the morphology and pining the Voc, respectively. This study provided detailed interpretation for ternary system, and will be helpful for the selection of third components for high performance ternary organic solar cells.


UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained with a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN TEM instrument. Films spin coated the same condition for solar cell devices on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were immersed in water, and the floating active layers were transferred to TEM grid. Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted on a Xenocs-SAXS/WAXS system with X-ray wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The film samples were irradiated at a fixed angle of 0.2°. Resonant Soft X-ray Scattering transmission measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). Samples for R-SoXS measurements were prepared on a Si substrate under the same conditions as those used for device fabrication, and then transferred by floating in water to a 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 μm thick Si frame (Norcada Inc.). 2-D scattering patterns were collected on an in-vacuum CCD camera (Princeton Instrument PI-MTE). The beam size at the sample is approximately 200 μm × 200 μm.

All film samples are prepared by spin-coating CB solutions on ZnO/ITO/glass substrates.

ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min sequentially in ultrasonic bath. After dried in nitrogen flow, the substrates were subjected to UV/ozone treatment for 15 min. Then a ZnO (4000 rpm, ∼30 nm) layer was spin coated onto the substrate, and dried at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The substrates were transferred into a glove-box with nitrogen atmosphere, and thin films of active layer were spin-coated from a solution of active layer blend in CB with donor material concentration (PTB7-Th:PDT2FBT-ID) of 8 mg mL−1. The substrates were then transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporator, followed by deposition of the MoOx/Ag (5 nm/160 nm) cathode at a pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr through a shadow mask. Active area of the cells is 0.04 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained by a Keithley 2420 Source-Measure Unit. The photocurrent was measured under illumination using an Oriel Newport 150 W Solar simulator (AM 1.5G). The EQE measurements of the devices were performed with an Oriel Newport System (Model 66902). All the measurements were performed at room temperature in air.


All procedures are the same for solar cell devices, except for using PEDOT:PSS/MoOx/Ag and ZnO/Ca/Al as electrode for hole and electron mobility respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves in the range of 0–5 V were obtained by a Keithley 2420 Source-Measure Unit in the dark in the air mobility can be calculated by fitting the results in the equation:
J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3
where J is the current density, L is the film thickness of active layer, μ is the mobility. εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium. It is assumed to be 3, which is typical for conjugated organic materials. ε0 is the permittivity of free space, V is the internal voltage in the device and V = Vappl − Vr − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vr is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the relative work function difference of the two electrodes.
