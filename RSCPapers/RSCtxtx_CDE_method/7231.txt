A random donor–acceptor semiconducting copolymer based on diketopyrrolopyrrole as the acceptor unit and dithienothiophene as the donor unit has been synthesized and characterized. Preliminary studies of BHJ solar cells based on this polymer with PC71BM showed a high PCE of above 5% under 100 mW cm−2AM1.5 solar illumination.

The dramatic growing demand for energy throughout the world has placed great emphasis on the exploration of new energy sources. Harvesting energy directly from sunlight using photovoltaic cells is recognized as an important and environment-friendly solution to the growing energy crisis. Compared to commercial inorganic solar cells, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their unprecedented advantages of low cost, easy fabrication and processing, light weight, and compatibility with large-scale flexible substrates. So far, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells comprising interpenetrating networks of a polymeric donor material and a fullerene derivative acceptor such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) have played a leading role in realizing higher efficiencies and are predicted to yield power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10% if a suitable low bandgap donor material is discovered.

For designing low bandgap polymers for application in PSCs, the concept of donor–acceptor (D–A) type copolymers is promising because of the numerous possibilities in the unit combinations. Many D–A type copolymers have been used in PSCs to achieve PCEs above 5% with extensive device engineering efforts. Very recently, significant progress was made in the application of 2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione(DPP)-containing materials in PSCs and field effect transistors (FET) following the useful synthesis of the 3,6-dithien-2-yl-2,5-dialkylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione segment. The DPP unit has a well-conjugated structure, which leads to strong π–π interaction, and the lactam part makes the DPP unit exhibit a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which gives it high electron affinity. Therefore, these properties make the DPP unit a potential electron-withdrawing unit in photovoltaic polymer materials, however, reports concerning the photovoltaic performance of DPP and its derivatives are still quite limited until now in contrast to another electron-deficient segment, 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), which has been studied extensively for the design of the low bandgap polymers for the PSC application.
On the other hand, due to strong π–π stacking interaction in the solid state, some representative condensed-thiophene-containing polymer systems, like PBTTT and PBTDT, show high charge carrier mobility, which is a very attractive feature and critically important for high-performance solar cells. Recently we developed a new polymer semiconductor based on the 3,5-dialkyldithienothiophene unit. This polymer, PBTDTT-15, showed a good annealing-free field-effect transistor mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.2% considering that the mismatch between its relatively large bandgap (1.93 eV) and the energy distribution of the solar spectrum would lead to insufficient light absorption. It implies that this kind of polymer possesses good potential for developing high-performance solar cells if electron-deficient acceptor units are introduced into the DTT-containing polymers to lower the bandgap and move the absorption toward longer wavelengths.
In this work, the electron acceptor DPP unit was linked with the 3,5-dialkyldithienothiophene unit by using thiophene as a bridge via the Stille coupling reaction. By combining DPP with DTT we expect to create a novel condensed aromatic push–pull conjugated backbone system with a wide absorption spectrum and good charge transporting ability. The resulting donor–acceptor randomly incorporated copolymer PDPP–T–DTT has shown improved organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance. The preliminary tests on the BHJ solar cells using PDPP–T–DTT as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor in the ratio of 1:2 exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.584 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.76 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.6727 with a PCE of 5.02%.
The polymer synthesis concerns the copolymerization of three components, in which 2,5-bis(stannyl)thiophene acts as a bridge, linking the 2,6-dibromo-3,5-dipentadecyldithienothiophene unit and 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-di-N-(2-butyloctyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione unit (Scheme 1). The Stille coupling reaction was carried out in chlorobenzene at 120 °C using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine as the catalyst and ligand, respectively. The copolymer was purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with ethanol, hexane and then chloroform to remove the small molecules and oligomers. Soxhlet extraction was continued with chlorobenzene. PDPP–T–DTT was then obtained in 65% yield by concentrating and precipitating the chlorobenzene fraction into methanol. NMR and elemental analyses were carried out on the polymers to verify the composition of the polymers (see ESI). Gel-permeation chromatography analysis using chlorobenzene as the eluent at 70 °C showed a moderate number-averaged molecular weight of 52.4 kD with a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of 3.4 against polystyrene standards. The thermal property of PDPP–T–DTT was evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). PDPP–T–DTT exhibited excellent thermal stability with a 5% weight loss at a temperature of 374 °C in its TGA profile. The DSC of PDPP–T–DTT showed an endothermic peak at 284 °C during heating and a corresponding exothermic peak at 270 °C when cooled (Fig. S1 in ESI), which were, respectively, attributed to the melting and crystallization of the polymer backbone.
The absorption spectra for PDPP–T–DTT are shown in Fig. 1. Compared with that of PBTDTT-15, two distinct absorption bands in PDPP–T–DTT were observed, which can be attributed to the π–π* transition from DTT segments (short wavelength region of 370–600 nm) and DPP segments (long wavelength region of 600–910 nm). The solution and solid state spectra of PDPP–T–DTT were almost the same, although the absorbance at the short wavelength region was relatively enhanced in the film, indicating that even in the dilute solution PDPP–T–DTT is in an aggregated state. The optical band-gap of PDPP–T–DTT corresponded to 1.37 eV, which was estimated by the onset point of the absorption band in the near infra-red region of around 910 nm. This value is 0.56 eV lower than that of PBTDTT-15 owing to the incorporation of the DPP unit as discussed earlier, indicating that PDPP–T–DTT possesses greater potential for photon-harvesting than PBTDTT-15 as expected.
Cyclic voltammetric measurement of a thin film of PDPP–T–DTT with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 M Bu4PF6/CH3CN solution showed quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction peaks (Fig. S2 in ESI). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, estimated from the onset of oxidation potential from a CV curve, was −5.14 eV, about 0.1 eV lower than that of PBTDTT-15 (−5.05 eV). The decreased HOMO level is expected to be helpful for increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) when it is used as a donor in BHJ solar cells.
Bottom-gate, top-contact thin film transistor (TFT) devices were fabricated from a solution-processed PDPP–T–DTT thin-film in order to investigate their charge transport properties. Fig. 2 shows the typical output curve and transfer characteristics of a representative as-prepared TFT device (W/L = 4000/120). The device showed a p-type transporting characteristic when measured under ambient conditions, with a saturation hole mobility of about 8.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 1.7 × 105. The hole mobility is about an order of magnitude lower than that of PBTDTT-15 (ca. 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1), this is likely to be due to the random linkage of DTT donor and DPP acceptor units along the polymer backbone, which reduces the molecular ordering of PDPP–T–DTT compared to the alternating-linked copolymer PBTDTT-15.
Since PDPP–T–DTT has a suitable high hole mobility and a low bandgap as well as lower HOMO level, this new polymer could be used as a donor material in polymer BHJ solar cells. We carried out preliminary tests on the performance of BHJ solar cells using PDPP–T–DTT as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor. The bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDPP–T–DTT:PC71BM/Ca/Ag. Fig. 3 shows J–V curves of the devices, and Table 1 lists the corresponding Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The devices with the 1:2 ratio by weight of PDPP–T–DTT:PC71BM provided the most promising results. The devices exhibited a Voc of 0.584 V, a Jsc of 12.76 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.6727 with a PCE of 5.02%. It was observed that the further increase in the PC71BM content resulted in a slight decrease in the Voc. This has previously been observed for other donor polymers, such as MDMO-PPV, AFPO3, P3HTV and PF10TBT. The reduction in the Voc correlated with the decrease in the energy of the charge transfer (CT) states with increasing PC71BM concentrations.

In summary, we have synthesized and characterized a new random donor–acceptor semiconducting copolymer PDPP–T–DTT based on DPP as the acceptor unit and DTT as the donor unit. Preliminary studies of BHJ solar cells based on the blends of PDPP–T–DTT:PC71BM showed a high PCE of above 5% under 100 mW cm−2AM1.5 solar illumination. Currently, most low-band-gap polymers for OPV application are developed based on the strategy of alternating donor–acceptor units along the polymer backbone. Our results in this study show that high OPV performance can also be obtained by a donor–acceptor randomly incorporated copolymer, thus opening a new design strategy for developing high performance OPV materials. Further work on understanding the relationship between the molecular structure and properties of such copolymers is under way, and will be reported elsewhere in due course.
