Chemical modification of a N3-adsorbed TiO2 photoelectrode with 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine enhanced the power conversion efficiency (η) by ca. 15% compared to DSSCs containing pristine N3 by increasing the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc).

Recently, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), based on nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductors, have been intensively studied because of their relatively high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (η) and lower production costs compared with conventional Si-based solar cells. DSSCs are composed of a dye sensitizer, a nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrode coated on a conductive glass substrate, an electrolyte traditionally containing an I−/I3−-based redox couple, and a Pt-coated counter electrode. The development of a stable dye sensitizer is one of the main research interests for high power conversion efficiency. A record conversion efficiency of 11% was achieved in cells using N3. Despite the advantages, DSSCs sensitized with N3 still suffer from a range of energy-loss mechanisms. For example, when N3 adsorbs onto the TiO2 surface, protons in the free anchoring groups (–COOH) induce a negative (downward) shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2 (ECB,TiO2), possibly reducing the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the cell. Furthermore, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between N3 induce aggregation on the TiO2 surface. This generally reduces solar cell performance by lowering the electron injection efficiency, as well as the short circuit current, due to the reductive quenching of excited dyes.

Numerous research reports have focused on modification of the first-generation ruthenium sensitizer, N3, to overcome or minimize such problems. In many cases, ruthenium-based dyes were chemically synthesized or modified by replacing two protons of N3 with hydrophobic alkyl chains or extra electron-donating groups to obtain more efficient and long-term stable dyes, such as Z907 and C103. To avoid a complicated synthetic procedure, chemical modification of a dye adsorbed on TiO2 photoelectrodes is considered to be a more feasible approach to improve the cell efficiency and stability by minimizing dye aggregation and the back reaction rate of photoinjected electrons to the electrolyte. Even though lots of work has been reported on such chemical treatments of TiO2|electrolyte interfaces by coadsorbents, few reports are available for the TiO2–dye|electrolyte interface, and there are still many difficulties in controlling the alkalinity of reagents for direct chemical treatment of the interface.
In the present work, a simple strategy is proposed for replacing protons in the free anchoring group (–COOH) of N3 on TiO2 by 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine (MPA), as shown in Scheme 1, to obtain more efficient and stable DSSCs.
The chemical interaction between N3 and MPA was carried out in an ethanolic solution of 0.3 mM N3 and 0.6 mM MPA by stirring under ambient conditions for 6 h, to form N3-MPA, which was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and mass spectroscopy. MPA can easily donate one pair of electrons to the carbonium cation of the free carboxylic group of N3 to form an amide bond, as described in Scheme 1, as the amine group in the MPA has a slightly basic character due to the inductive effect of the adjacent methyl group (–CH3). This was consistent with the FTIR spectra (see Fig. S1(a) in the ESI). The characteristic absorption bands at 2111 cm−1 were due to the vibrational frequency of NCS groups for both N3 and N3-MPA. The band at 1703 cm−1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of >CO in the carboxylic group of N3, while the band at 1610 cm−1 is due to the presence of the amide group (–CONH–) for N3-MPA. It shifted to lower energy (Δf = 93 cm−1) because of resonance of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen (N) in the amide group. Furthermore, a broad band appeared at 3384 cm−1, indicating the stretching frequency of the secondary amine in –CONH– of N3-MPA. FTIR spectra of N3-MPA on TiO2 showed similar characteristics, with the exception that the absorption band of N–H merged with the broad band of TiO2 (see Fig. S1(b) in the ESI), while there was no direct chemical interaction of MPA with TiO2, as indicated in Fig. S1(c) in the ESI. The formation of the amide bond in N3-MPA was also confirmed by 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI, respectively.
It was observed that the LUMO level had a negative shift of ca. 40 mV after chemical modification of N3, as shown in the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in Fig. S4 in the ESI, without changing the energy level of the oxidation potential (HOMO) at ca. 0.88 V because the isothiocyanate groups (–NCS) of N3 were not affected with MPA. This was consistent with the blue shift of the absorption maxima (λmax) by ca. 19 nm in the UV-vis spectra (the inset of the Fig. S4) due to the presence of an electron-donating amine group in N3-MPA.
The preparation of TiO2 photoelectrodes and the assembling DSSCs was described in the previous report. The N3-sensitized TiO2 films, designated as E(N3), were dipped into ethanolic solutions of MPA, with different concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 mM, for 6 h at room temperature to form N3-MPA on TiO2 by deprotonation. These are denoted as E(N3-MPA, 0.05), E(N3-MPA, 0.1), and E(N3-MPA, 0.3), respectively. From comparison of the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with E(N3) and E(N3-MPA) photoelectrodes, under AM 1.5 conditions, as described in Fig. 1(a), the photoelectrochemical performances of the DSSCs were maximized using 0.1 mM MPA, and decreased with increasing concentration. The efficiency decrease was mostly caused by a decrease in the photocurrent density (Jsc), while both the Voc and fill factor (FF) did not change significantly at a higher concentration of 0.3 mM MPA, as summarized in Table 1. This was consistent with reduction in the amount of dye-loading with the increase of the concentration of MPA due to the enhanced basicity (pH) of the solution during chemical modification of N3 by MPA (see Table S1 in the ESI). Overall, the cell efficiency (η) increased by 15%, showing less decay up to ca. 3% (see Fig. S5 in the ESI) after 500 h, under the optimum MPA concentration of 0.1 mM compared with the cell without modification, even though the amount of dye-loading was decreased by ca. 14% for E(N3-MPA, 0.1) (see Table 1 and Fig. S6 in the ESI). The increase resulted from significant enhancements of Jsc and Voc, up to 4% and 40 mV, respectively, as well as the FF enhancement by 4%, which is comparable with that for N719.

The increase in Jsc was consistent with the IPCE enhancement over the whole wavelength range, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This is mostly attributable to the enhancement of the quantum yield, φinj(λ), caused by the reduction in dye aggregation, while the light-harvesting efficiency, LHE (λ), was not expected to be enhanced as the net absorption was decreased due to a smaller amount of active dyes on TiO2 after chemical modification of N3.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of DSSCs, measured by varying the applied potential at equal intervals in the vicinity of Voc for all the cells under AM 1.5 conditions, were analyzed to determine the back reaction parameters at the TiO2–dye|electrolyte interface. All the potential scales of the cells (Vcell) were changed to the potential of the Fermi level (VF) by correcting the potential drops (Vs) induced by series resistance (Rs) in each cell. The higher values of the recombination resistances (Rr) for the cells with E(N3-MPA, 0.1), in all potential ranges (Fig. 2(a)), clearly indicated the suppression of charge recombination by forming molecular spacing between the photoinjected electrons on TiO2, and I3− in the electrolyte, which helped to enhance the electron collection efficiency as well as Jsc for the cells with MPA-modification. Furthermore, the analysis of the energy level difference between the conduction band edge of TiO2 and the electrochemical redox potential of the electrolyte (ΔE = ECB,TiO2 − EF,redox), estimated from EIS for the chemical capacitances (Cμ) of TiO2 films under illumination (Fig. 2(a)), indicated a positive (upward) shift of ECB,TiO2 for E(N3-MPA, 0.1), with respect to E(N3), of up to ca. 30 meV (Table 1) when considering the invariance of the electrochemical redox potential (EF,redox) of the electrolyte during the measurements. This was consistent with the upshift of the onset potential for the distribution of the density of states (DOS) up to ca. 30 mV, compared with that of E(N3), as shown in Fig. 2(b), which was deduced from the CVs by plotting the capacitive charging of electrons into the surface states (the inset of Fig. 2(b)). Therefore, the positive shift of ECB,TiO2 and the retardation of recombination of photoexcited electrons with electrolyte suppressed dark current density (Jo) and enhanced Voc significantly for E(N3-MPA, 0.1).
In summary, N3-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes were deprotonated with MPA via an amide bond, for high-performance and stable DSSCs. This simple strategy significantly retarded dye aggregation, and, thus, enhanced Jsc by decreasing the reductive quenching of N3. In addition, the suppression of back reaction rate of photoinjected electrons to the electrolyte and positive shifting of ECB,TiO2 by the presence of NH groups in MPA modified N3-adsorbed TiO2 photoelectrodes increased Voc remarkably in the cell. In this context, the present study provides a novel and efficient way to improve the performances and stability of N3-sensitized solar cells by reducing dye aggregation and charge recombination simultaneously.
