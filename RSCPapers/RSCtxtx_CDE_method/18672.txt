Side-chain engineering on nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) is crucial for modulating their solubility and crystallinity as well as packing behaviours in active layers to pursue high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). High weight ratios of side chains are generally used by NFAs for the desired device efficiencies. Side-chain economy has seldom been discussed despite increased cost and difficulties in synthesis when optimizing the molecular design. Herein, we introduce 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (DCB) as an electron-donating core to design unfused-ring acceptors (UFAs) with a dramatically low weight ratio of side chains. DCB-4F has thus been designed and compared with the carbazole cored analogue (CB-4F). The unique conformation of the DCB core endows DCB-4F with higher solubility (8.2 mg mL−1 in chloroform) compared to CB-4F (2.2 mg mL−1) when using the same side chains. Featuring a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −3.86 eV and an optical bandgap of 1.55 eV, the DCB-4F film exhibits an absorption profile (maximum 667 nm) complementary to polymer donor PM6. The PM6:DCB-4F as-cast OSCs deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.56% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.00 V. By adding 10 wt% PC71BM into the casting solutions, a greatly improved PCE of 11.17% is readily achieved, which is one of the highest PCEs for as-cast single-junction UFA-based devices. The PM6:DCB-4F based blends show homogeneous nano-fiberous morphology and higher hydrophobicity. The design of conformation-tuned NFAs using sterically hindered DCB-like cores is promising to achieve highly efficient as-cast OSCs.

Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), especially acceptor–donor–acceptor structured fused-ring electron acceptors and their upgraded Y6-series, are advantageous in modulating the energy levels, solar absorption, solution processability, and device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Delicate molecular engineering of the conjugated core, side chains and accepting ends has rendered a large library of highly-efficient acceptors to push the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 17% for OSCs. However, their wide application is limited by the synthesis cost and difficulties in constructing ladder-type fused-ring cores. Unfused-ring electron acceptors (UFAs) have thus been developed. Considerable side-chain engineering and device processing have been used to meet the trade-off between solution processing and morphology control. Two main purposes are addressed: (i) constructing non-covalent interactions among side chains to attain coplanar conjugation for efficient charge transfer and high device performance; and (ii) modulating the solubility, crystallization and packing behaviors in the active layers to prepare as-cast highly-efficient stable OSCs. Large weight ratios of side chains are generally used. Sidechain economy has seldom been discussed in spite of the increased cost and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, we propose a UFA design strategy adopting unique sterically hindered donating cores with high side-chain economy to achieve highly-efficient as-cast OSCs. Devices with a PCE above 11% and a VOC of 1.00 V can be readily obtained by incorporating 10 wt% PC71BM as a processing aid. Our strategy may open a new avenue in designing UFAs with sterically-controlled cores and high sidechain economy for highly efficient as-cast OSCs.


Organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a promising candidate for the next generation of sustainable energy technology owing to their low cost, light weight and large-area solution processability. As a key component of OSCs, the active layers consist of polymer donors and electron acceptors. At early stages, fullerene and its derivatives dominated the acceptor materials. Since 2015, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) featuring strong absorption and tunable energy levels have become the mainstream in acceptor design. The combinational efforts in molecule innovation and device optimization have pushed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs over 18%.

Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbones, as the most efficient NFA category, have attracted great attention for in-depth exploration. FREAs commonly exhibit a planar conjugated backbone, which is beneficial to promote intermolecular π–π stacking for high carrier mobility. Besides, the A–D–A structure endows FREAs with strong intramolecular charge transfer between the electron-withdrawing terminals and electron-donating core, achieving a high short-circuit current (JSC) in OSCs. So far, a large library of efficient FREAs have been developed, such as ITIC, ITC6-IC, INPIC, Y6, and their series analogues. The rapid development of NFAs in recent years has been largely triggered by side-chain engineering. For instance, Zhan et al. introduced four rigid 4-hexylphenyl substituents out of the plane of the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core to subtly modulate the planarity and suppress molecular self-aggregation of ITIC. Later, Li et al. reported m-ITIC by isomerizing the hexylphenyl moieties to improve the photovoltaic performance of ITIC. Compared to ITIC, m-ITIC shows a higher film absorption coefficient, larger crystalline coherence, and better electron mobility. Obviously, appropriate side chain optimization on FREAs is conducive to the improvement of the photovoltaic performance, but it may also increase the difficulty of synthesis and purification. And the high cost in constructing ladder-type fused-ring cores via multi-step synthesis limits the commercial application of FREA-based OSCs. In this case, the development of unfused-ring acceptors (UFAs) with cost-effective synthesis has become an important direction in NFA design. UFAs can be prepared with shorter synthetic routes or reduced overall synthesis cost to build molecular structures with higher atomic economy. UFAs are designed by replacing the fused-ring donating cores in FREAs with unfused backbones, where proper coplanar structures are formed via intramolecular non-covalent interactions between adjacent aromatic units for desirable crystallinity and π–π stacking in the solid state. For example, Chen et al. reported two A–DA′D–A structured UFAs named BCDT-4F and BCDT-4Cl, where the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit was flanked by two cyclopentadithiophene bridges to conjugate with different halogenated accepting ends. Both acceptors possess broad and strong spectral absorption (600–900 nm), along with a nearly planar conjugated skeleton via S⋯O intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the donating core. The PBDB-T:BCDT-4Cl based OSCs achieved an optimal PCE of 12.10% with a high JSC of 23.77 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76 V. By replacing the electron-deficient BT unit with benzotriazole, Huang's group developed an unfused NFA called BTzO-4F, which improved the PCE of PBDB-T based OSCs to 13.8% with an increased VOC of 0.839 V. However, UFAs often show excessive crystallinity and severe self-aggregation, which demand large amounts of long side chains to guarantee enough solubility and careful thermal annealing and a processing aid to optimize devices for better performance. The introduction of long side chains not only results in increased difficulties in molecular synthesis and aggreggation control but also may cause decreased thermostability induced by decomposition of alkyl chains. Thus, UFAs should have a reasonably low level of the side chain weight ratio to achieve a trade-off between material cost and device performance by simplifying the synthesis and device fabrication. A survey of UFA based highly-efficient OSCs in the literature reveals that the side chains attached to the conjugated backbones of all UFAs account for a weight ratio ranging from 31% to 49% (shown in Table S1, ESI). As such, side chain economy requires more rational molecular design for UFAs to develop as-cast high-performance cost-effective OSCs.
Inspired by the spatial structural features of FREAs, where rigid 4-hexylphenyl substituents extend out of the coplanar conjugated backbone to modulate the self-aggregation and planarity, we are encouraged to incorporate partial distortion into the molecular backbone for the design of aggregation-controllable UFAs. We report herein 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (DCB) as a unique electron-donating core flanked by two thiophene bridges to design a highly-efficient UFA (DCB-4F), where fluorinated IC units are employed as accepting ends. For reference, the carbazole based counterpart UFA (CB-4F) has been prepared for a comparison study (Scheme 1). The bulky DCB-cored UFA exhibits high solubility (8.2 mg mL−1) in chloroform by adopting only three linear alkyl chains (ca. two n-hexyl and one n-octyl chains), while only 2.2 mg mL−1 is found for CB-4F. Featuring an absorption peak at 667 nm and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) ∼−3.86 eV, DCB-4F matches well with the state-of-the-art polymer donor PM6. The as-cast PM6:DCB-4F blend based OSCs deliver a superior PCE of 9.56%, with a high VOC of 1.00 V, a JSC of 16.42 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 58.23%. The CB-4F based reference devices exhibit only a PCE of 0.78%, with significantly lower JSC and FF values. It should be noted that the VOC of 1.00 V for the DCB-4F based OSCs is among the highest values for PBDB-T or PM6 based OSCs with PCEs surpassing 9% (detailed data are shown in Table S1, ESI).
More encouragingly, the as-cast device performance can be dramatically improved to 11.17% when adding 10 wt% PC71BM into the binary blend without any further device optimization. The readily achieved PCE over 11% is among the highest values for as-cast single-junction devices in the literature (Fig. 1 and Table S1, ESI). The morphology studies reveal a more regular nanofibrous bicontinuous interpenetrating network and appropriate phase separation in PM6:DCB-4F blends. Importantly, the side chains in DCB-4F account for only 23.78% (weight ratio) of the entire molecule, which is the lowest value for all reported best-performing NFAs in the literature (Fig. 1 and Table S1, ESI). Our results demonstrate that the design of UFAs adopting unique sterically hindered DCB-like cores is beneficial to achieve highly-efficient as-cast OSCs with the highest side chain economy.

Our designed UFAs can be prepared from easily accessible starting materials with facile synthetic routes to lower the synthesis cost. As shown in Scheme 2, DCB-4F is synthesized via a five-step procedure in high yields from 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole, i.e., alkylation (92%), bromination (93%), Stille coupling (85%), a Vilsmeier reaction (87%), and Knoevenagel condensation (74%), respectively. The four-step synthesis route for CB-4F starting from 2,7-dibromocarbazole is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI). Both unfused-ring donating cores are constructed by flanking the DCB or CB unit with two 3-hexylthiophene bridges on both sides. The subsequent Vilsmeier reaction can readily afford the corresponding dialdehydes. Further Knoevenagel condensation with 2-(5,6-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (IC-2F) afford the target DCB-4F and CB-4F as dark solids. The intermediate and final compounds are fully characterized, with the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra provided in Fig. S1–S19 (ESI). The thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis reveals high thermal stability for both UFAs, with a decomposition temperature (5% weight-loss, Td) of 329 °C and 334 °C observed for DCB-4F and CB-4F, respectively (Fig. S20, ESI).

The chemical geometries of the two UFAs were evaluated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, where all alkyl chains were simplified into methyl to shorten the calculation time. The optimized molecular orbitals and geometries for DCB-4F are shown in Fig. 2a, while the corresponding results for CB-4F are shown in Fig. S21 for comparison (ESI). Due to the existence of intramolecular steric hindrance, DCB-4F and CB-4F show different three-dimensional (3D) spatial structures with distinct dihedral angles. DCB-4F shows higher dihedral angles of 50.21° and 49.43° between the DCB donating core and two thiophene bridges, much higher than those in CB-4F (24.13° and 23.74°). Importantly, DCB-4F exhibits a dihedral angle of 17.47° between two naphthalene moieties in the bulky DCB core, resulting in enhanced distortion of the molecule. DCB-4F and CB-4F exhibit similar wave function distributions in the frontier orbitals (Fig. 2a and Fig. S21, ESI), i.e., the electron density of the HOMO is mainly localized on the donor segment whereas the electron density of the LUMO is delocalized over the entire conjugated skeleton.
The big difference in the spatial conformation of DCB-4F and CB-4F has a large impact on their solubility in organic solvents. The solubility in chloroform was measured to be 8.2 mg mL−1 for DCB-4F, while only 2.2 mg mL−1 for CB-4F. In general, coplanar UFAs show decreased solubility as the donating cores become bulkier. In this case, DCB-4F may suffer from poor solubility. Thanks to the larger distortion in both the DCB block and the linkages between DCB and two thiophene bridges, DCB-4F, however, exhibits much better solubility than CB-4F, which bears a coplanar carbazole core and lower dihedral angles between carbazole and two thiophene bridges. It is reasonable to note that constructing suitable 3D spatially structured unfused donating cores is beneficial to improve their solubility.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the two acceptors are shown in Fig. 2b. Both the solution and neat film of DCB-4F exhibit broader absorption than CB-4F, while they share similar maximum absorption peaks, 612/613 nm for the solutions and 667/668 nm for the neat films, respectively. The extinction coefficient for DCB-4F and CB-4F is measured to be 5.77 × 104 and 9.85 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Red-shifted absorption in the films can be observed for both UFAs compared with their solutions, ascribed to compact intermolecular π–π stacking in their neat films. According to the film absorption onset (λonset) of 799 nm, DCB-4F exhibits an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.55 eV, which is narrower than that of CB-4F (1.64 eV, shown in Table 1). To investigate the electrochemical properties of DCB-4F and CB-4F, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 2c) are employed and the results are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of DCB-4F are calculated to be −3.86 and −5.50 eV, respectively. For CB-4F, the LUMO/HOMO values are estimated to be −3.94/−5.54 eV, as shown in Fig. 2d. The energy levels of these two UFAs indicate good matching with the state-of-the-art polymer donor PM6. The high-lying LUMO of DCB-4F is beneficial for the OSCs to obtain high VOC, which is confirmed by a PM6:DCB-4F device study (VOC = 1.00 V, Table 2).

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of DCB-4F, solution spin-coated OSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The polymer donor PM6 was selected due to its complementary absorption and well-matched energy levels with DCB-4F. The photovoltaic parameters for PM6:DCB-4F as-cast devices at different D/A ratios are summarized in Table S2 (ESI), with J–V curves plotted in Fig. S22 (ESI). The as-cast binary OSCs can contribute PCEs over 7.63% when changing the D/A ratio from 1:0.8 to 1:1.2. The as-cast PM6:DCB-4F(1:1) devices exhibited a promising PCE of 9.56%, with a high VOC of 1.00 V, JSC of 16.42 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.23%. In contrast, the PM6:CB-4F blended device only achieved a PCE of 0.78% with a low VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 2.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 31.97%. The VOC of 1.00 V is quite high for NFAs in the literature. The optimal J–V curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the two optimized binary devices are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The DCB-4F based devices yield a broad photon response in the wavelength region from 450 to 725 nm with the EQE values exceeding 50%, indicating that slight charge recombination occurred in the active layer. The DCB-4F-based device gives a strong photo response in the range of 450–725 nm, significantly higher than those of the CB-4F-based device; the improved EQE maybe originated from either the more efficient extraction of charge carriers, or the reduction of geminate recombination loss during the initial generation of charge carriers, and/or the suppression of nongeminate charge recombination (details will be discussed below). The integrated JSC values from the EQE curves are 15.75 and 2.75 mA cm−2 for PM6:DCB-4F and PM6:CB-4F, respectively, which is in accordance with the tested J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).

It should be noted that the as-cast PM6:DCB-4F (1:1) binary OSCs can be further improved by using solvent additives and thermal annealing. The devices processed with 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) solvent additive contributed an improved PCE of 10.80% with a dramatically improved FF of 62.52% and JSC of 17.28 mA cm−2. The DIO processed devices can be further optimized by thermal annealing of the active layers to increase the FF of the devices. A maximum FF of 70.79% was achieved at 100 °C for 10 min. The device data for optimized OSCs with solvent additives and further thermal annealing are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI), respectively. The corresponding J–V curves for the optimized devices are plotted in Fig. S23 (ESI). As shown, the fully optimized PM6:DCB-4F (1:1) binary OSCs contribute a decent PCE of 11.08% after solvent and thermal annealing, which is greatly improved in comparison to the PCE of 9.56% for the as-cast device and also impressive for all reported UFAs in the literature (Table S1, ESI).
Our earlier work has demonstrated that PC71BM can function as a solid processing-aid and electron transport channel to improve both JSC and the FF in OSCs. Considering that the PCE of our as-cast PM6:DCB-4F OSCs is limited by the moderate FF value (58.23%), further device optimization was explored by incorporating PC71BM as a third component into the binary blends. Excitingly, a maximum PCE of 11.17% is achieved in the as-cast OSCs when 10 wt% PC71BM was added (shown in Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 11.17% is among the highest values for as-cast single-junction OSCs based on UFAs (Fig. 1 and Table S1, ESI). The J–V and EQE curves for the optimal as-cast PM6:DCB-4F:PC71BM ternary OSCs are plotted in Fig. 3c and d, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices summarized in Table S5 (ESI). As expected, a dramatic improvement in the FF is observed with the addition of PC71BM. However, the ternary OSCs just show a slight increase in JSC, which may be explained by the small improvement in the EQE spectra with the addition of PC71BM.
To clarify the effect of spatially structured donating cores on the electron transfer properties of our as-designed UFAs, we adopted the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to measure the hole and electron mobility. A device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag was employed for the hole-only device, while ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al for the electron-only device. As shown in Fig. S24 (ESI), the PM6:DCB-4F blend film exhibited a high hole mobility (μh) of 3.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility (μe) of 1.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, rendering a μh/μe of 2.82. In contrast, the PM6:CB-4F film exhibited a much lower μh (1.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (0.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as listed in Table S6 (ESI). The stupendous improvement in μh and μe indicated enhanced hole and electron transport in the DCB-4F based OSCs, which is responsible for achieving higher JSC. Importantly, the DCB-4F based devices exhibited a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 2.82 in comparison to the CB-4F based ones (μh/μe = 4.56). Interestingly, the PM6:DCB-4F blends exhibit gradually enhanced electron mobility from 1.33 to 2.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after adding 10 wt% PC71BM, while the hole mobility was slightly affected by introduction of 10 wt% PC71BM, as indicated by the increment from 3.75 to 3.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ternary blend exhibited more balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.53) in comparison to the binary one (μh/μe = 2.82). The more harmonious hole and electron mobility is beneficial to improve the FF of devices to afford better PCEs.
Since the photocurrent is commonly associated with the exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiency, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices is employed and plotted in Fig. 3e. Jph and Veff satisfy the following formulae: Jph = JL − JD, and Veff = V0 − Va. JD and JL are the photocurrent densities under darkness and illumination, respectively. Va is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage where Jph is zero. When Veff approaches 2 V, the PM6:DCB-4F based device achieved high Jph even at low Veff, and the devices reached the saturation current density (Jsat) when Veff is lower than 1 V, whereas the PM6:CB-4F devices exhibited a strong dependence of Jph on Veff, and the carriers could not reach the saturation condition even when Veff approached 2.0 V, indicating that severe recombination processes and limited charge extraction are present in the PM6:CB-4F-based devices. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss, defined by Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) under short-circuit conditions were calculated to assist further evaluation of the exciton dissociation probability. The PM6:DCB-4F OSCs exhibit a higher Pdiss value of 92.19% in comparison to the PM6:CB-4F devices (Pdiss = 81.36%). These results indicated that the PM6:DCB-4F OSCs feature more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection processes, leading to higher JSC and FF.
The light-intensity (P) dependence of JSC was estimated to study the bimolecular behaviours in the above two devices. The relation between the light intensity and JSC follows the power-law formula: JSC ∝ Pα, where α approaching 1 indicates negligible bimolecular recombination. As depicted in Fig. 3f, the α values were fitted as 0.96 and 0.84 for the devices based on PM6:DCB-4F and PM6:CB-4F, respectively, indicating that weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the PM6:DCB-4F devices. Furthermore, we accessed the light-intensity dependence of VOC to reflect the trap-assisted recombination behaviour in both molecule based devices (shown in Fig. S25, ESI). Obviously, the DCB-4F based devices exhibited a smaller slope of 1.23 kT q−1 than that of CB-4F (1.41 kT q−1), suggesting that decreased trap-assisted recombination was realized, which is beneficial for achieving higher JSC and FF.

The device fabrication and performance of NFA-based OSCs are greatly dependent upon the trade-off of the acceptors’ solubility and crystallinity. Besides, the final device properties and stability are largely determined by the morphology and phase separation domain size in blend films. As such, AFM observations were performed to delve into the impact of the unfused-ring structure on the molecular solubility and the subsequent morphology differences in the active layer. Fig. 4a–c show the AFM height images of the PM6:DCB-4F (1:1), PM6:CB-4F (1:1) and PM6:DCB-4F:PC71BM (1:1:0.1) blends. It's clear that the PM6:CB-4F blend film exhibits a rough surface, with a root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 1.83 nm. Nevertheless, the PM6:DCB-4F and PM6:DCB-4F:PC71BM blends show a smaller phase separation domain size (Rq = 0.934 and 0.854 nm, respectively), illustrating that a smooth and uniform surface is formed for better interface contact between the active layer and electrodes. Furthermore, the phase images (Fig. 4e and f) confirm that the PM6:DCB-4F and PM6:DCB-4F:PC71BM based blend films feature more homogeneous and ordered nanofibrous morphologies than the PM6:CB-4F film. This is favourable for charge transport and explains the significantly higher JSC and FF in the PM6:DCB-4F based OSCs. In order to further explore the phase separation of the two UFAs in the binary and ternary blends, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4g–i. Different electron densities lead to the acceptor domain and the donor domain being represented as the corresponding dark and bright regions. More uniform bright and dark domains can be observed in the PM6:DCB-4F and PM6:DCB-4F:PC71BM blends when compared to those of PM6:CB-4F. Besides, more evident fibrillar textures illustrate that DCB-4F can effectively inhibit molecular aggregation and excessive phase separation compared to CB-4F. This is advantageous for reducing charge recombination for effective charge transfer.

To explore the miscibility between PM6 and the UFAs in the blends, the contact angles based on liquid drops of water and glycerol were measured for the three pristine materials. The contact angle images are provided in Fig. 5. The surface tension (γ) values of the materials and the corresponding interaction parameter (χ) are calculated from the measured contact angles on water and glycerol. As shown in Table S7 (ESI), the γ values of the neat PM6, DCB-4F and CB-4F films are calculated to be 20.21, 35.07 and 61.13 mN m−1, respectively. Because the surface tension of PM6 is lower than that of the two acceptors, these materials are expected to segregate toward the top air surface and the bottom of the active layer, respectively. The compatibilities of the two different materials are evaluated by applying the equation: , where γdonor is the surface tension of PM6, γacceptor is the surface tension of DCB-4F or CB-4F, and χ represents the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter. The interaction parameter between PM6 and DCB-4F is relatively low (χ = 2.0347), indicating good miscibility between them, which is consistent with the results of the relatively low roughness and appropriate phase separation from morphology characterizations. In contrast, χ between PM6 and CB-4F is high (χ = 11.0424), indicating low miscibility between them. The reduced miscibility of the two components may result in large-scale phase separation, which may be one of the reasons for the poor performance of the PM6:CB-4F based OSCs.

In summary, we have proposed a strategy to design unfused-ring electron acceptors by adopting unique sterically hindered 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole as the donating core to achieve highly-efficient as-cast solar cells. Featuring a weight ratio (23.78%) of side chains, DCB-4F showcases the highest side chain economy but great solution processability in comparison to all highly efficient UFAs (sidechain weight ratios all over 30%) for the best-performing as-cast OSCs in the literature. Compared to coplanar carbazole cored CB-4F, the enhanced distortion in the 3D spatial conformation endowed DCB-4F with broader and redshifted light absorption as well as higher solubility. The as-cast PM6:DCB-4F based OSCs contribute a PCE of 9.56% with a VOC of 1.00 V, JSC of 16.42 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.23%. The relatively low FF and JSC of the binary device were further optimized by incorporating 10 wt% PC71BM in the blends. The optimized PM6:DCB-4F:PC71BM (1:1:0.1) ternary OSCs deliver a maximum PCE of 11.17%, which is among the best for UFA based as-cast single-junction devices. The superior device performance can be partially attributed to the ordered nanofibrous morphology and appropriate phase separation in the PM6:DCB-4F and added-PC71BM blend films. Importantly, these blend films exhibit more balanced charge transport mobilities, more suppressed charge recombination and proper miscibility in comparison to the CB-4F based ones. Our results demonstrate the potential of the DCB core in designing high-performance UFAs with high sidechain economy for highly-efficient as-cast OSCs.


To a solution of 7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (5 g, 18.70 mmol) in dry DMF (30 mL) was added NaH (974.5 mg, 60 wt% in mineral oil, 24.31 mmol).

The OSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The patterned ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned via sequential sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then blow-dried with high-purity nitrogen. All pre-cleaned ITO substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 3 mins to improve their work function and clearance. Subsequently, the ZnO precursor solution prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Aldrich, 99.9%, 1 g] and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99.5%, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99.8%, 10 mL) was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 5000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 30 s and annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour in air. The substrates were transferred into an N2-protected glove box for spin-coating the active layer. The PM6:DCB-4F or PM6:CB-4F blend was dissolved in chloroform (CF) with a concentration of 7.5 mg mL−1 (for the polymer). The solution was stirred for 10 hours at room temperature and then spin-coated on the surface of the ZnO layer in a high-purity nitrogen-based atmosphere glove box, and the blend film was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) layers were successively deposited by thermal evaporation.

The J–V curves of the OSCs were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 irradiation using an Oriel 300 W solar simulator, calibrated with a monocrystalline silicon reference cell with a KG5 filter. The typical active area is 3.97 mm2 as defined by a metal mask with an aperture. The EQE spectra were recorded on a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The active layer thickness measured using a Bruker Dektak XT stylus profilometer was about 100 nm.
