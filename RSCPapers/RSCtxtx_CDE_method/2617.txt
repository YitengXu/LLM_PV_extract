We report a series of solution-processable, small-molecule, donor materials based on an architecture consisting of two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) cores with different aromatic π-bridges between the DPP units and different end-capping groups. In general, this architecture leads to desirable light absorption and electronic levels for donor materials. Out of the compounds investigated, a material with a hydrolyzed dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole (SDT) core and 2-benzofuran (BFu) end capping groups leads to the most favorable properties for solar cells, capable of generating photocurrent up to 800 nm while producing an open-circuit voltage of over 850 mV, indicating a small loss in electrical potential compared to other bulk heterojunction systems. Device properties can be greatly improved through the use of solvent additives such as 2-chloronaphthalene and initial attempts to optimize device fabrication have resulted in power conversion efficiencies upwards of 4%.

Advances in the understanding of materials used in organic photovoltaics enable further improvement of device efficiencies. To achieve optimal absorption onsets and minimal voltage loss during solar cell operation, a series of bis-diketopyrrolopyrrole molecules (bis-DPPs), which consist of an aromatic core, two flanking DPP-thiophene units and different aromatic ending groups, are proposed and synthesized to search for donor materials with optimal frontier energy levels. DFT calculations are applied to estimate HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these bis-DPPs. A quasi-quantitative relationship between the DFT calculated and experimental values of most bis-DPPs is identified, which indicates the great potential of DFT-aided predication of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of new conjugated molecules. In this series of compounds, a hydrolyzed bis-DPP is found to exhibit superior solar cell performance with a PCE up to 4.2% by optimization with a solvent additive. This investigation sets an example of evolution of conjugated small molecules from mono-DPP to bis-DPP along with tailoring the energy levels via molecular designs.


In the past decade, advances in the understanding of organic photovoltaics have allowed device efficiencies to improve rapidly compared to other types of solar cells. The interplay between molecular structure, self-assembly, light absorption, band structure, material distribution and charge carrier mobilities is complex and makes it a fascinating and fruitful area of research, as evidenced by the increasingly large number of studies published within the field each year. As the scientific community gains an increasing knowledge of what properties must be met to achieve optimal performance and how to achieve these properties, peak efficiencies have increased rapidly while methods for their mass production have developed, substantiating this class of solar cell as a technology with a real marketable potential.

Among the advantages of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaics, their potential to be fabricated easily via solution deposition and at low cost gives them a significant advantage over other solar technologies. Consistent with this line of thought, our group has developed small molecule materials for use in organic photovoltaics, which have advantages over more commonly used polymeric materials in terms of their ease of synthesis and purification; making them more affordable to produce on large scales. Additionally, small molecules do not suffer from molecular weight dependence and polydispersity, and thus large batch-to-batch variation as their polymer counterparts. Using the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) chromophore as a platform for material design, relatively good power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved with such molecular donor materials. These results have contributed to a growing interest in the community and numerous molecular donors and acceptors which consist of organic chromophores such as isoindigo, squaraine, oligothiophene, borondipyrromethene, pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole, and merocyanine.
In this contribution, a series of materials comprising various aromatic groups flanked by two DPP units were designed and synthesized, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The long planar structure and electronic offset between electron rich and electron deficient groups of this architecture led to good π-electron delocalization and π-electron redistribution, respectively, yielding materials with relatively low band gaps and low electron transfer losses when used with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). During the preparation of this manuscript, Marks et al. reported on a related bis-DPP derivative which achieved a respectable PCE of 4% when combined with PC61BM, affirming the utility of this architecture. Out of this series of compounds, we identify a material 5,5′′′-bis(3-(5-(benzofuran-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-6-yl)-3′′-(bis(2-ethylhexyl)silanolyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2) which generates photocurrent up to 800 nm, while producing an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of over 850 mV. Compared to high efficiency BHJ materials such as poly[4,8-bis-2-(ethylhexyl)oxy-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-4-(2-hexanone-1-yl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT) reported by Yang and coworkers, which is able to produce BHJ devices with some of the highest known efficiencies, this material exhibits a narrower band gap while at the same time producing a larger VOC. The fill factor (FF) and magnitude of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in initial devices limit the PCE to 4.2% (prompting us to investigate other loss mechanisms in a parallel study), however, the VOC produced by the material is among the largest observed in any low-band gap (less than 1.6 eV) BHJ and constitutes electronic levels that approach ideality based on conventional BHJ knowledge. The following sections outline the process utilized to design this material as well as attempts to control film morphology and optimize its performance in BHJ solar cells.

In seeking to design high-performance materials, it is fruitful to consider the limits to power conversion efficiency (η) in order to target specific highest and lowest organic molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) and band gap values. The η of a solar cell is equal to the product of the short-circuit current density (JSC), VOC and FF (eqn (1)). The JSC of a solar cell can be determined by integrating the product of the solar photon flux (N(λ)) and EQE of a device as a function of wavelength up to λonset (eqn (2)) and the maximum achievable current (at 100% EQE) increases as λonset red-shifts. Although the origin of the VOC and mechanisms of loss in potential are different for different types of solar cells, the VOC produced by a single active layer of any type must be smaller than the band gap (Eg) of the material by some quantity, Vloss (Fig. 1b), and thus the maximum achievable VOC decreases as λonset increases (eqn (3)).

η = JSC × VOC × FF

JSC = ∫N(λ) × EQE(λ)dλ

Due to the intrinsically low dielectric constants and large exciton binding energies of organic materials, organic solar cells require electron transfer between a donor and an acceptor to convert photons into separated electrical charges. Thus, in addition to other losses, conventional BHJ models dictate that a loss in electrical potential is required to drive the transfer of an electron (or hole) from one material to the other (VET or VHT for electrons or holes, respectively, Fig. 1c). Although the origin of the VOC in BHJ systems and minimum difference in energy levels necessary to drive electron or hole transfer in BHJs remain active areas of research, we find the model proposed by Scharber et al. is a useful approximation to target energy levels. In this approximation, an optimized BHJ will produce a VOC approximately 0.3 V less than the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. Thus, the approximate Vloss in a BHJ system (where the donor is the light absorber) is VET + 0.3 V. Although VET and Vloss provide similar information about electrical losses, Vloss can be easily measured for a given donor–acceptor system by subtracting the observed VOC from the observed Eg. VOC and Eg values typically exhibit very little variation between laboratories compared to HOMO and LUMO measurements which are typically used to calculate VET. Thus, we advocate Vloss (as measured from VOC and Eg) as a more reliable figure of merit when making comparisons between different laboratories or evaluating losses in new materials.
Combining eqn (1)–(3) yields the maximum efficiency possible in a system with a given λonset and Vloss (or VET) and FF. A plot of this efficiency as a function of λonset resembles the well-known Shockley–Queisser plot of efficiency limits for P–N junctions. This calculation can be scaled to represent EQE and FF values typical of organic BHJ solar cells (for instance average EQE of 0.6 and FF of 0.6, see eqn (4), Fig. 1d). It should be noted that the magnitude of the EQE and FF produced by real devices are functions of many factors aside from the energy levels of donor and acceptor materials and we are not able to predict the η that a new material will produce with any certainty. Thus, the calculation provides a visual aid for understanding how band gap and electron transfer losses affect the efficiency possible in a variety of systems and may be useful in identifying optimal band gaps and evaluating electrical losses. For instance, it is apparent that there exists some λonset at which the potential η reaches a maximum value for a given Vloss and this optimum λonset shifts to shorter wavelengths for materials with large VET, for instance, in a system with a VET of 1.0 V (such as the poly 3-hexyl thiophene, P3HT:PCBM system), the optimal λonset is actually close to 650 nm.
(4)
If we assume a PCBM acceptor with a LUMO energy level of 4.0 eV, the ideal donor would have a λonset of 893 nm, a HOMO energy of 5.1 eV, and a LUMO energy of 3.7 eV. Supposing that an average EQE and FF of 0.6 could be achieved, it would produce an η of 9.4%, although any material with a λonset in the range of 805 to 935 nm would yield η over 9.2%, as long as VET is only 300 mV (i.e. the VOC is 600 mV less than Eg). This range is labeled as the “target” range in Fig. 1d. Again, this calculation assumes an EQE and FF of 0.6, where the observed EQE and FF of real materials depend strongly on additional factors such as the ability of donor materials to form interpenetrated networks with acceptor materials, their charge carrier mobilities and recombination losses, which, to our knowledge cannot currently be predicted a priori. Thus, the plot serves to identify materials with ideal energy levels, ideal band gaps and low electrical losses rather than as a prediction of the efficiency that a material will produce. For comparison, a few representative materials from the literature are included in the plot (where Vloss was calculated by subtracting the observed VOCs from their Egs as observed in their photocurrent onsets) and compared to the optimal bis-DPP structure identified in this study (SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2). This compound was identified with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

To aid in the design of promising materials, DFT was employed to estimate electronic molecular orbital energy levels. Although the calculations we employed compute energy levels of single molecules in the gas phase, a correlation between calculated gas phase HOMO and LUMO levels and solid state HOMO and LUMO bands measured spectroscopically is observed. In previous studies of solution processed small molecule solar cells, our best results have been obtained with the small molecule 3,6-bis(5-(benzofuran-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione, DPP(TBFu)2, which we utilized as a reference material. For this material, the observed HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in combination with optical band gaps, are stabilized by 0.36 and 0.62 eV, respectively, relative to the calculated gas-phase values. These shifts are used to estimate how experimental HOMO and LUMO energy values might compare to those calculated via DFT methods for hypothetical new materials. Although we are currently unable to define a physical relationship between DFT-derived, gas-phase, orbital energies and band energies in the solid state, we do find that there is a strong correlation and nearly constant offset for similar DPP-containing molecules with small structural variations. Thus, in order to achieve a material with ideal energy levels, we target materials having a LUMO energy that is ∼0.25 eV deeper and a HOMO energy that is ∼0.0 to 0.2 eV shallower than DPP(TBFu)2; or DFT LUMO energy levels in the range of 2.9–3.1 eV, and HOMO energy levels in the range of 4.6 to 5.0 eV, as highlighted in Fig. 2. This allows us to identify structures which are more likely to have absorption onsets in the 800–900 nm range and VOCs with minimal losses compared to their Egs when using PCBM as an acceptor.

The selection of both core and end capping units were based upon literature findings where such units were incorporated into π-conjugated materials suitable for use in BHJ solar cells. Using the B3LYP basis set at the 6-31G(d) level of theory, we calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for a number of compounds with the structure Ar1(TDPPTAr2)2. The structural units and results are graphically illustrated in Fig. 2, where the blue values represent energies calculated by DFT. The target LUMO energy values (grey shading) fall within a narrow range to minimize electron transfer losses to PCBM, while the target range of acceptable HOMO energy values (tan shading) is larger, representing a range of acceptable Eg values.
Analysis of the theoretical calculations reveals that compounds containing the donor core units SDT, cyclopenta-(2,1-b;3,4-b′)dithiophene (CDT), fluorene (FL), and benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (BDT) have appropriate energy levels while those with electron deficient (benzothiadiazole) BT core unit may have a LUMO which may be slightly too deep for efficient electron transfer with PCBM. A hydrolyzed SDT core (SOHDT) was also modeled, as it was recovered as a byproduct during the Suzuki coupling of the SDT-cored material (will be discussed later) and was found to yield the smallest electron transfer loss and best performance out of the materials explored. Comparing different end groups reveals that TBFu and TTT lead to narrower Egs than a single thiophene (T), while TBFu leads to deeper energy levels (and should consequently produce a larger VOC) than TTT.
Twelve materials with BT, FL, CDT, SDT, SOHDT and BDT cores and various terminal groups were synthesized via standard cross coupling procedures, with full experimental details found in the ESI. The synthetic details of one material with a diethienothiophene core have been published, and the recombination in the material with the SOHDT core has been examined in a separate study. In addition to materials in the “ideal” range, we synthesized additional materials to explore correlations between structure and material properties. Due to the synthetically challenging nature of these structures, we were not able to synthesize all possible core and end-group combinations. The DFT-predicted HOMO and LUMO values for several materials, which were not synthesized, are included for reference. The popular, hole-transporting, carbazole moiety was considered; however, was not synthesized because the Eg is not predicted to be significantly narrower than DPP(TBFu)2. Additionally, materials with CDT and TDT cores and BFu end-capping groups were modeled, but have not yet been synthesized. Although the material with BFu end groups and no core group is expected to have near ideal energy levels, we have not yet explored synthetic routes to access it.
In the case of SDT, attempts to synthesize the material via Suzuki cross-coupling reaction led to hydrolysis of one Si–C bond in the SDT moiety under the mildly basic conditions, leading to a material with a hydrolyzed SDT core (SOHDT). The instability of SDT unit in Suzuki couplings has been previously observed. A significant amount of material underwent hydrolysis at only one Si–thiophene bond, which we were able to isolate chromatographically. Although this was not the intended product, devices prepared using this material yielded better performance compared to any of the other bis-DPP materials. The intended SDT compound was later successfully synthesized successfully via Stille cross-coupling reaction.
Respective HOMO and LUMO energy levels of thin films of each synthesized material were measured by UPS and UV-Vis (see ESI, Fig. S2 and S3) and are represented by red values in Fig. 2. Compared to values calculated by DFT, we find that the measured HOMO and LUMO energy levels are 0.39 ± 0.06 and 0.64 ± 0.05 eV deeper respectively, fairly close to the predicted shifts using DPP(TBFu)2 reference.
We next compare energy levels predicted via DFT to those observed spectroscopically. For instance, we estimate that the LUMO level of 4,7-bis((5′′-(hexyl)terthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole BT(TDPPEHTTTC6)2 would be ∼0.3 eV deeper in energy, and that the HOMO would be ∼0.2 eV shallower in energy, and that the Eg would be ∼0.5 eV narrower compared to DPP(TBFu)2. The estimated Eg of 1.2 eV and a λonset around 1000 nm are fairly close to the observed values. These estimations are repeated for several materials and are compared to experimental values in Table 1 (ESI Fig. S4–S13). Although there is some error, we find that these predictions based on DFT calculations generally correlate to trends observed in real materials. Plots comparing predicted HOMO, LUMO, Eg and Vloss to observed values can be found in the ESI (Fig. S14).

Solar cell devices were prepared using the standard architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Al, where different donor:PC71BM ratios of: 30:70, 50:50 and 70:30 were explored. All active layers were cast from 16.7 mg mL−1 solutions in chloroform with thicknesses of approximately 90 nm. For each compound, thermal annealing was explored in an initial screening of processing conditions. In some cases, a few experiments involving solvent additives were tried; this data can be found in the ESI and shows that solvent additives are frequently able to increase the JSC in these materials. Although device data does not constitute a full optimization of each material (each material was studied separately), it does yield information about the λonset and VOC inherent to each system. The results of devices optimized with respect to blend ratio and annealing (Fig. S4–S13) are summarized in Table 1.

Comparing the materials BDTEH(TDPPEHT)2, BDTEH(TDPPEHTBFu)2 and BDT(TDPPEHEHTTTC6C6)22 reveals information about the effect of end-capping groups. Although synthetically less challenging, we find that materials with a single thiophene terminal group do not lead to ideal absorption characteristics. Terthiophene (TTT) devices yield lower series resistance, larger JSC and lower VOC compared to TBFu. Comparing the materials BT(TDPPEHTTTC6)2, FC6(TDPPC6TTTC6)2 and BDTEHEHEH(TDPPEHEHEHTTTC6C6C6)222, reveals how core groups affect device properties when a TTT end-capping group is used. The largest current is produced with the BDT core, even though the BT core possesses a broader absorption spectrum and greater potential for photocurrent. It is possible that the LUMO value of BT(TDPPEHTTTC6)2 (3.77 eV) is too close to that of PC71BM (4.00 eV) and that electron transfer is retarded because its VET of 0.23 eV is too small, reducing the ability to generate photocurrent from excitons generated in the donor phase. This observation is supported by the EQE of the material (ESI, Fig. S4k), where the spectrum is dominated by features in the range where PC71BM absorbs light, and is quite low at longer wavelengths where the donor absorbs, implying that the quantum efficiency of electron transfer is smaller than the quantum efficiency of hole transfer. One interesting observation is that the compound BT(TDPPEHTTTC6)2 is able to produce a FF of up to 70% in the 30:70 blend, is among the largest FFs observed for single-layer, small molecule BHJ devices.
Comparing BDTEH(TDPPEHTBFu)2, FEHEH(TDPPEHEHTBFu)22 and SDTEHEH(TDPPEHEHTBFu)22 reveals how the central core-group affects properties when a BFu end-capping group is employed. Although the fluorene-cored material produces the largest VOC, the photocurrent onset is the shortest out of the series and we did not observe large JSCs with this material. While BDTEH(TDPPEHTBFu)2 exhibits desirable properties including an absorption onset of 780 nm, a Vloss of only 780 mV and VOC of up to 810 mV, the material SDTEHEH(TDPPEHEHTBFu)22 exhibits even broader absorption, lower Vloss of 700 mV, and higher VOC of 850 mV, indicating that the effective LUMO and HOMO are more stable by 80 meV and 50 meV, respectively.
The materials BT(TDPPEHTTTC6)2, SDTEHEH(TDPPEHEHTBFu)22 and BDTEH(TDPPEHTBFu)2 are predicted to have the smallest Vloss and close to ideal λonset out of the materials synthesized, and indeed this is the case. Out of the series of compounds investigated, it is clear that SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2, has the highest upper efficiency limit based on its Eg and Vloss, generating photocurrent up to 800 nm while producing a VOC of over 850 mV. Although the Eg is slightly larger than ideal (ideal λonset greater than 805 nm versus 800 nm measured) and slightly greater than the predicted value (predicted λonset of 820 nm versus measured onset of 800 nm), the observed VOC (850 mV) is only 700 mV less than the Eg, making it the least “lossy” material and fairly close to the ideal donor material we set out to synthesize.

Initial screening of small molecule BHJ devices showed SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2 as the donor exhibited the lowest Vloss and a near-ideal Eg. Therefore, it was selected for further study. The effect of active layer SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2:PC71BM blend ratio and thermal annealing on the properties of SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2 devices was investigated. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of three different blend ratios annealed at different temperatures can be found in Fig. 3 and the results are summarized in Table 2. After investigating several annealing temperatures for each ratio, the optimal annealing temperature is 80 °C in all cases, and the optimal blend ratio is 50:50, delivering a JSC of 3.0 mA cm−2, while the JSC for the 30:70 or 70:30 blends is only 1.5 or 2.4 mA cm−2 respectively. Decreases in FF and VOC are also observed for blends with 30:70 and 70:30 ratio, where the 50:50 blend produces a FF and VOC of 51 and 835 mV respectively while the 30:70 and 70:30 ratios produce VOCs and FFs of 42 and 823 mV and 48 and 820 mV, respectively. Thermal annealing of the 50:50 blend at low temperatures (up to 80 °C) is found to cause a small increase in JSC (from 2.3 to 2.5 to 3.0 mA cm−2 for as-cast, 60 °C and 80 °C devices, respectively) as well as a small increases in both FF and shunt resistance (a FF increase from 49 to 43 to 51 to 55 for as-cast, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C devices, respectively, while shunt resistance changes from 144 to 134 to 205 to 340 kΩ cm2 for as-cast, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C devices, respectively). Annealing at higher temperatures appears to disrupt carrier transport as evidence by a significant increase in series resistance (from 5.3 Ω cm2 for the 80 °C device to 19.5 Ω cm2 for the 100 °C annealed device), leading to a general degradation in device performance from 1.28 to 0.99%. This increase in series resistance is consistent with changes in hole mobility as measured in hole-only diodes via the space-charge limited current model. The hole mobility of the pristine material is 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 which decreases to 1.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing at 100 °C. Similarly, the hole mobility of the as-cast 50:50 blend decreases from 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing at 100 °C. J–V curves used to calculate hole mobilities can be found in ESI (Fig. S15).

In general, the effect of thermal annealing is much smaller for SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2 than that observed for the DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM blend. A closer look at the thin film morphology using atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides insight into this observation. Whereas thermal annealing of DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM blends leads to optimal phase separation and the appearance of crystalline domains as observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal annealing at similar temperatures has a much smaller effect on the structure of SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2:PC71BM films and does not lead to an increase in crystallinity as evident by XRD where no diffraction peaks could be observed. As-cast and annealed SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2:PC71BM films show similar surface morphology. The as-cast film shows circular features with diameters in the range of 100 nm to 250 nm, average diameters of 170 nm and a surface roughness of around 8.2 nm (Fig. 4a). Annealing at 110 °C causes circular domains to merge and a drop in the surface roughness (7.6 nm (Fig. 4b)). Annealing at higher temperatures causes a gradual smoothing of the films; at 120 °C the surface roughness decreases to 5.2 nm and at 140 °C the bumpy features become indistinct while the surface roughness drops to 3.6 nm (ESI, Fig. S16). Unfortunately, these changes do not provide any benefit to device properties. Thus, other processing methods must be employed to control the thin-film morphology in this blend system.

Among the processing techniques explored in this study, solvent additives were found to have the most profound effect on small molecule:PCBM film morphology and device performance. A range of solvent additives were explored including traditional solvent additives such as octanedithiol, diiodooctane and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN); highly dispersive liquids such as diiodomethane, tetrabromoethane and bromothiophene; highly polar liquids including propylene carbonate and 2-cyanothiophene; naphthalene derivatives including 1-methyl naphthalene, the nitrogen containing naphthalene analog isoquinoline and the fully hydrogenated naphthalene analogue decalin; as well as a high-boiling liquid with a structure similar to DPP, 1-methylpyrrolidone. A table comparing boiling points and Hansen parameters of each additive can be found in the ESI (Table S12).

In contrast to thermal annealing, which has little effect on morphology and offers very little benefit for SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2 based devices, solvent additives are found to offer access to a wide range thin-film morphologies (see ESI, Fig. S17). For example, Fig. 4c and d show examples of the smoothest and roughest films prepared with 0.5% v/v CN and 0.5% v/v propylene carbonate, respectively, exhibiting surface roughness of 0.3 nm and 37 nm, respectively. Depending on which additive is chosen, films with various surface roughnesses can be obtained along with a wide range of morphologies. Additives, which are poor solvents for the BHJ mixture (decalin, propylene carbonate and 1-methylpyrrolidone), are found to yield rougher films while aromatic additives and particularly naphthalene analogues yield smoother films. AFM images of several additional additives as well as J–V curves and a table of device properties can be found in the ESI (Fig. S17, S18 and Table S13).
Out of the additives explored, the ones which produce significant increases in JSC are 2-cyanothiophene, 1,8-diiodo octane, 1-methyl naphthalene, 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane and CN, leading to JSC of 5.1, 5.3, 8.1, 8.9 and 9.5 mA cm−2, respectively. The largest VOCs were obtained using CN, while a drop in VOC of over 100 mV was observed with diiodooctane, 1-methylnaphtalene, isoquinoline, 2-bromothiohene, and propylene carbonate. Most additives cause a small to moderate decrease in the FF of devices, while 2-cyanothiophene causes a small increase in FF from 47 to 53%. Of all the additives explored, CN produces the most desirable photovoltaic properties.
We explored the effect of CN concentration on device performance and found 0.5% v/v to be optimum; above 1%, the JSC and FF decrease slightly. The current produced by the device prepared with CN is significantly larger than the blend without additives (about ∼9 mA cm−2 for all additive concentrations versus 2.3 mA cm−2 without). We next investigate the effect of thermal annealing after processing with solvent additives. Similar to the devices prepared without additives, thermal annealing up to 100 °C of devices prepared using CN leads to an increase in FF and VOC, however, annealing at 100 °C or above causes a decrease in JSC. Annealing at 100 °C causes modest increase in the hole mobility up to 5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, an optimum annealing temperature of 80 to 90 °C is identified for devices prepared using CN, yielding characteristics including a JSC of 9.4 mA cm−2, a VOC of 847 mV, a FF of 47.9 and an η of 3.79%. The J–V characteristics of this processing condition under illumination and in the dark are plotted in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, respectively, while the EQE is plotted in Fig. 5c. These conditions were used as a control formulation and have been reproduced on at least 5 separate experiments over a six-month period; a collection of J–V characteristics and dates can be found in the ESI (Fig. S19). Devices prepared at a slightly higher spin rate with slightly thinner (∼85 nm vs. 95 nm) active layers yielded a champion device with a JSC of 9.9 mA cm−2, a VOC of 856 mV, a FF of 49% and an η of 4.2%.

We have designed a series of molecular donor materials based on an architecture consisting of two DPP moieties. DFT calculations were used to predict the HOMO and LUMO values of these compounds with an accuracy of 60 meV based on trends observed for this series of compounds. This bis-DPP topological scheme leads to materials with broad, low-energy optical absorption bands and solar cell devices which exhibit low electrical losses relative to their band gaps when mixed with PC71BM. Within this class, the most promising material we have identified consists of a hydrolyzed dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)silole core and 2-benzofuran end-capping groups (SOHDT(TDPPTBFu)2). This material is capable of generating significant photocurrent to 800 nm while producing a VOC of 850 mV.

Initial device studies, in which EQE and FFs of less than 0.4 and 0.5, respectively, were achieved have yielded ηs of over 4%, which are competitive with other small molecule BHJ devices; compared to other successful BHJ materials, Vloss is small (Table 3). However, other losses stemming from carrier recombination and/or poor donor–acceptor network formation have limited the η observed in this material so far.

Minimizing loss in electrical potential in BHJ solar cells is essential to further increasing efficiencies in organic photovoltaics. Consider the case of the P3HT:PC61BM system, for example. Despite the years of optimization and achievement of high FF and EQE values, most of the charge carriers' potential in this system is wasted in the electron transfer process. Although the optical band gap of P3HT is ∼1.9 eV, the P3HT:PC61BM system is only able to produce a VOC of about 610 mV, meaning 1290 meV of this potential are lost, severely limiting the possible η with this system. This loss in potential can be compensated to some extent by using acceptors with higher lying LUMO levels, for instance BHJs comprising P3HT and the acceptors 4,7-bis(1-hexyl-2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazolyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (HVBT) or 9,9-bifluorenylidene (9,9-BF) can reduce this loss to 1040 or 710 mV, respectively, though use of these acceptors has so far been accompanied by a reduction in photocurrent. The carbazole based polymer poly-N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) represents a significant improvement over P3HT for BHJ devices using PC61BM or PC71BM as an acceptor. With an Eg of 1.8 eV and a Voc of ∼880 mV, only 980 meV are lost relative to the Eg. However, the upper η limit is hindered by a λonset which is smaller than ideal. In a report by Yang and coworkers, a material with a Eg of 1.60 eV and loss of only 850 mV was reported, yielding an η of up to 7.7%, indicating energy levels which are fairly close to ideal.
It is interesting to point out that the highest efficiency single crystal silicon solar cells lose 350 mV in potential relative to silicon's band gap, and would deliver only 12% η with typical organic BHJ characteristics including 60% FF and 60% EQE, or 6.7% with the best EQE and FF obtained in this study. However, through decades of device optimization and incorporation of almost flawless antireflective coatings and light-trapping schemes, the EQE of the best silicon devices are close to 100% throughout the visible spectrum, while the FF is 82.8%.
While it is largely regarded that organic solar cells are intrinsically far less efficient than inorganic solar cells, it appears that fundamental losses in potential can be reduced to the point where this difference in theoretical limits is not so large. While processes of device engineering to achieve EQE close to 100% and FF over 80% have yet to be demonstrated in organic BHJs, this work demonstrates that careful molecular design, aided by the use of DFT, can be used to bring fundamental losses in potential in BHJs close to those observed in inorganic systems.

UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was measured on a Shimadzu 2401 diode array spectrometer. Film thicknesses were determined using an Ambios XP-100 Stylus profilometer.


Solar cells were fabricated by spin-casting the BHJ active layer onto a 55 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (H.C. Stark Baytron P 4083) atop Corning 1737 glass patterned with 140 nm of ITO. Unless otherwise stated, the BHJ layer was spin-cast from chloroform at a total solids concentration of 16.7 mg mL−1. Solar cells were characterized under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G irradiation from a 300 W Xe arc lamp with an AM1.5 global filter. A shadow mask with and area of 13.59 mm2 was used to ensure accurate and consistent device areas. For most device conditions, multiple devices were fabricated and the best value is reported. Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer, and illumination intensity was set using an NREL certified silicon diode with an integrated KG1 optical filter; spectral mismatch factors were calculated to be less than 10%. Quantum efficiencies were measured with a Xe lamp, monochromator, optical chopper, and lock-in amplifier; photon flux was determined by a calibrated silicon photodiode. Device fabrication and testing were done under an inert atmosphere in a nitrogen filled glove box.


Hole mobilities were extracted using the space-charge limited current model. Hole-only diodes were prepared using glass/ITO substrates with a PEDOT:PSS film as described in the previous section. Organic semiconductor layers were deposited by spin coating followed by a thermally evaporated Au electrode. Mobilities were extracted from the quadratic portion of J–V curves of these devices by modeling with the Mott–Gurney relationship.


AFM images were collected in air under ambient conditions using the Innova scanning probe microscope (Veeco). Silicon probes with resonant frequencies of 75 kHz (Budget Sensors) were used for tapping mode AFM measurements.


For UPS measurements, a 75 nm thick Au film was thermally deposited on precleaned Si substrates with a thin native oxide. Blend (or pure) solutions were then spin coated at spin speed of 2000 rpm and concentration of 0.2%. All films were prepared inside a nitrogen atmosphere glove box and were transferred via an airtight sample holder to the UPS analysis chamber. Samples were also kept in a high vacuum chamber overnight to remove solvent residues. The UPS analysis chamber was equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (Kratos Ultra Spectrometer) and was maintained at 1 × 10−9 Torr. The UPS measurements were carried out using the He I (hv = 21.2 eV) source. During UPS measurements, a sample bias of −9 V was used in order to separate the sample and the secondary edge for the analyzer.


Thin film XRD spectra were recorded using an X'Pert Phillips Material Research Diffractometer (MRD) at 45 kV and 40 mA with a scanning rate of 0.004 degree per second, and Cu Kα radiation (with wavelength λ = 1.5405 Å) with a 2theta–omega configuration.
