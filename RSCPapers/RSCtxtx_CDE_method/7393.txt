The electrode buffer layer plays a more crucial role in semi-transparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) than in opaque devices due to the additional requirements of the average visible transmittance (AVT) and color rendering index (CRI) besides the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, we developed a novel cathode buffer layer aluminum(III) acetylacetonate (Al(acac)3) via mild spin-coating with a post low temperature heat treatment process. Studies show that the Al(acac)3 film possesses outstanding optical features and a suitable energy level. Namely, the absorption of an Al(acac)3 film with a thickness of 10 nm is as low as 1% and the transmittance is high, up to 95%, in the visible and near infrared regions, guaranteeing full absorption of the photoactive layer and a high CRI for ST-OSCs; and the suitable energy level ensures a smooth electron transport and collection process. By introducing the Al(acac)3 film in ST-OSCs, the devices based on PM6:Y6 yield an efficiency of 12.41%, an AVT of 25.33% (from 370 nm to 740 nm) and a CRI of 94.6. Encouragingly, the large-area ST-OSC of 100 mm2 with the Al(acac)3 buffer layer yields an efficiency of 11.28%. Further, the long-term stability of ST-OSCs shows that the device with encapsulation retains 60% of the initial PCE over 60 hours of continuous illumination. The results indicate that Al(acac)3 is a promising cathode buffer layer for fabricating efficient, large area and stable semi-transparent organic solar cells.

As a promising technology for solar energy utilization, organic solar cells (OSCs) with bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures have achieved impressive progress due to their properties of light weight, mechanical flexibility and large-area manufacture. Currently, the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of opaque single junction OSCs have so far exceeded the milestone of 16%, stimulating intensive attention for their potential commercial applications, such as semi-transparent (ST) OSCs in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), flexible and portable power sources, power-coatings on vehicles and so on. Among their various applications, ST-OSCs are currently considered the most competitive and promising technology in sharp contrast to the inorganic counterparts benefiting from their cost-saving and efficiency-increasing prospects in the large area manufacturing process.

Unlike the traditional assessment standards of opaque OSCs, the performance of ST-OSCs also relies on the average visible transmittance (AVT) and color rendering index (CRI) as well as PCEs. In the case of the AVT, 25% is set as the benchmark for aesthetically fashioned power generating windows, which depends on the light in the visible range of 370–740 nm being transmitted through the ST-OSCs. Obviously, for fabricating high performance ST-OSCs, there is a competitive relationship between the PCE and AVT since high efficiency means sufficient light absorption and lower AVT. Consequently, extensive efforts have been focusing on how to balance the AVT and PCE for efficient ST-OSCs, such as synthesizing new photovoltaic materials with suitable absorption spectra, finding novel transparent electrodes with desired electrical and energy level features and adjusting light management in multilayers.
Previous records have confirmed that the buffer layer between the electrodes and photoactive layers plays a critical role for facilitating carrier transportation, and therefore upscaling the PCEs of OSCs. In the past decades, many materials including metals, metal oxides, conjugated polyelectrolytes and organic compounds with various work functions (WFs) have been successfully applied as the buffer layers in OSCs; especially low-work-function materials such as ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 are widely used in the inverted structure because the inverted architecture demonstrates better stability. However, the thicknesses of some buffer layers get up to 30–40 nm to acquire uniform and pinhole-free films, which inevitably decreases their transmittance. Even though the thicknesses of some buffer layers are only 10 nm, their optical, electrical and stability properties still need to be improved, or are not so ideal for large-area ST devices. Hence, further studies are still necessary for finding novel low-work-function buffer layers under consideration of the issues of thickness, optical, electrical and stability features. Additionally, solution-processing and low temperature treatment are desirable for achieving cost-saving and efficient large area ST-OSCs.
In our previous work, some metal-acetylacetonate chelates, such as titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD), zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) and hafnium(IV) acetylacetonate (Hf(Acac)4), have been developed as cathode modification layers in OSCs without decomposition into metal oxides. These metal-acetylacetonate chelates obtained from simple and mild processes possess virtues of high transmittance and electron mobility, suitable energy levels and solution processability, which are desired cathode buffer layers for OSCs. Furthermore, Robins and coauthors added varying concentrations of Al(acac)3 into the as prepared MAPbI3 precursor solutions, incorporated these “Al3+-doped” films into “inverted” p–i–n perovskite solar cells, and achieved a measured current-density voltage PCE of 19.1%. Hence, the objective of the present study is to fabricate a novel cathode buffer layer aluminum(III) acetylacetonate (Al(acac)3) and introduce it into ST-OSCs, which can satisfy the practical benchmark of ST-OSCs, namely provide an appropriate AVT and CRI on the premise of keeping an efficient PCE and aesthetically pleasing color. The novel cathode buffer layer was prepared simply by spin-coating the Al(acac)3 isopropanol solution at an optimized 2000 rpm for 30 s on an ITO electrode and then thermally treating at 110 °C for 10 min. The inverted device architecture of ITO/Al(acac)3/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag was fabricated to probe the photovoltaic performances of ST-OSCs since low-bandgap PM6:Y6 demonstrates potential in ST-OSCs.

Aluminum(III) acetylacetonate (Al(acac)3) and MoO3 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Electron donor PM6 and electron acceptor Y6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc (Beijing, China). All these chemicals were commonly commercially available products and used as received without further purification.


An ESCA Lab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al Kα radiation was employed to obtain X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data under a base pressure of 3 × 10−9 mbar. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) of Al(acac)3 was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic He ultraviolet source He I (hν = 21.22 eV) in an ultra-high vacuum (3.0 × 10−8 Torr). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a PerkinElmer 7 thermogravimetric analyzer with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under an air and a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. A Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to record the absorption and transmittance spectra for Al(acac)3 and the active layer. The film thickness involved in the devices was evaluated using a Dektak XT surface profilometer (Bruker).


Inverted ST-OSCs with an Al(acac)3 buffer layer based on a PM6:Y6 photoactive layer were fabricated; the specific structure is ITO/Al(acac)3/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag (15 nm). The traditional structure of ITO/ZnO/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag (15 nm) is fabricated for comparison. All patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic cleaner for about 15 min before preparation. Al(acac)3 powder was dissolved in isopropanol with a solution concentration of 10 mg ml−1 and stirred for at least an hour before spin-coating. Subsequently, the Al(acac)3 cathode buffer layer was spin-coated at different speeds from 1000 to 3000 rpm for 30 s on the cleaned ITO substrates followed by heat treatment at 110 °C for 10 min in air. Active layer PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 weight ratio) chloroform:1-CN (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) solution with a polymer concentration of 8 mg ml−1 was spin-coated onto ITO/Al(acac)3 substrates at an optimized 3000 rpm for 60 s, and then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in an N2 atmosphere. Finally, 5 nm-thick MoO3 and 15 nm-thick Ag were thermally evaporated in a high vacuum (4 × 10−5 Pa) on the blend active layer.


A Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit in a nitrogen-filled glove box was applied to evaluate the current density–voltage (J–V) performance of ST-OSCs under simulated AM 1.5G (1000 W m−2, 25 °C) standard test conditions (from SAN-EI LTD, AAA grade). It should be highlighted that the photovoltaic parameters listed in this paper were averaged over 12 individual devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QE-R system (Enli Tech., Kaohsiung, Taiwan) under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature, and a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell purchased from the national renewable energy laboratory (The United States of America) was used to calibrate the light intensity at each wavelength.


Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) both in an air and a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere were carried out to confirm the baking temperature of Al(acac)3. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the different ambient atmospheres have no obvious influences on the thermogravimetric curves of Al(acac)3 powder, and the weight of Al(acac)3 remains constant when the temperature is below 150 °C and it rapidly loses its mass between 150 and 220 °C. The results clearly indicate that the heated Al(acac)3 doesn’t decompose and retains its chemical properties under the condition of an annealing temperature below 150 °C. Therefore, the thermal treatment condition was selected as 110 °C for 10 min to achieve stable Al(acac)3 films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to compare the chemical composition of the Al(acac)3 power (before annealing) and Al(acac)3 film (after annealing), as shown in Fig. 1c and d. As expected, the binding energy (BE) positions of Al 2p for the powder and film are both located at 74.40 eV, which is in accordance with the BE values of Al3+ ions. The O 1s XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 1d. It can be observed that the two samples present a symmetric O 1s peak centered at 531.85 eV and 531.95 eV, corresponding to the oxygen in the acetylacetonate ligand cycle. This suggests that the heat treatment is mild and doesn’t change the chemical component of aluminum(III) acetylacetonate.


Fig. 2a displays the inverted ST-OSC device structure of ITO/Al(acac)3/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag, in which Al(acac)3 was used as an electron transporting layer, MoO3 as a hole-transporting layer, and ultrathin Ag with a thickness of 15 nm as a transparent top electrode. The schematic energy level diagram of materials involved in the OSCs is given in Fig. 2b, and the electronic energy levels of PM6, Y6 and MoO3 were taken from the literature. The optical properties of the buffer layer have a more striking influence on ST-OSCs than on opaque OSCs because the absorption of the buffer layer will compete with that of the photoactive layer and their transparency will reduce the CRI of ST-OSCs. Hence, outstanding optical properties of the cathode buffer layer are a prerequisite for ST-OSCs. Fig. 2d presents the absorption and transmittance spectra of the Al(acac)3 film, which demonstrates that the absorption of the Al(acac)3 film is as low as 1% and the transmittance is high, up to 95%, in the visible and near infrared regions, foretelling a high photocurrent in ST-OSCs at a high AVT.
The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were investigated to verify the energy level of the Al(acac)3 layer, and the survey scan is shown in Fig. 3a. By calculating the difference between the incident light energy (He I, 21.22 eV) and the energy of the cutoff (16.65 eV), the WF of Al(acac)3 can be obtained to be 4.57 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of Al(acac)3 is −7.92 eV calculated from the onset and the WF (3.35 + 4.57 = 7.92 eV). The band gap (Eg) is 3.49 eV from the onset of the absorption spectra in Fig. 2d. Therefore, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is −4.43 eV (7.92 − 3.49 = 4.43 eV). Fig. 2e shows the normalized absorption spectrum of the PM6:Y6 blend film, showing that PM6 and Y6 have complementary absorption spectra in the visible and NIR region, which is favourable for the corresponding ST-OSCs to harvest more incident light and produce a higher photocurrent.
The inverted device structure of ITO/Al(acac)3/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag was fabricated to evaluate the performance of ST-OSCs based on a spin-coating speed of Al(acac)3 ranging from 1000 to 3000 rpm, and the related current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters averaged over 12 individual devices are compared in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the champion ST-OSC with an optimized 2000 rpm Al(acac)3 interlayer yields the highest PCE of 12.41%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.817 V and a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 73.34%, attributed to the excellent optical virtues, electron extraction and hole blocking function of the Al(acac)3 layer. When the speed decreases to 1000 rpm, the PCE still maintains a high value of 11.94% with a Jsc of 20.33 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.815 V and an FF of 72.08%. Further increasing the Al(acac)3 rotation speed to 3000 rpm, the Jsc and FF values have a slight decrease, while the Voc value does not change a lot. For comparison, the ST-OSC with a ZnO interlayer affords a PCE of 12.01%, with a Voc of 0.823 V, a Jsc of 19.80 mA cm−2 and an FF of 73.71%. The integrated current densities from EQE spectra are in good agreement with the results from J–V measurements, which are 19.71, 20.36 and 19.99 mA cm−2 for the ST-OSCs with the spin-coated Al(acac)3 speed ranging from 1000 to 3000 rpm, and 19.16 mA cm−2 for the ST-OSCs with a ZnO interlayer. Table 1 shows that the Al(acac)3 rotation speed from 1000 to 3000 rpm affects the device performance to a certain degree, and the ST-OSCs present an almost constant Voc, a slightly fluctuating Jsc of 20.33–20.73 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.11–73.34%.

To further investigate the practicability of the Al(acac)3 interlayer for large-area ST-OSCs, three devices with different photoactive areas of 4, 25 and 100 mm2 were fabricated, and the related J–V curves and EQE spectra are illustrated in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The PCE for the 25 mm2 ST-OSC declines slightly compared to that of the 4 mm2 device, which demonstrates an impressive PCE of 11.62%, with a Jsc of 20.06 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.813 V, and an FF of 71.23%. Encouragingly, the large-area 100 mm2 ST-OSC still possesses a high PCE of 11.28% with a Jsc of 19.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.816 V, and an FF of 69.63%. Table 1 compares the photovoltaic parameters for ST-OSCs with different areas. The corresponding integrated current densities calculated from the EQE spectra are in good agreement with the J–V curves and the differences between them are less than 5%. Fig. 4e presents the transmittance spectra of ST-OSCs ranging from 370 to 740 nm; the AVT of the ST-OSC with the Al(acac)3 interlayer was 25.33%, surpassing the practical benchmark for aesthetically fashioned power generating windows and BIPV applications, while the AVT of the ST-OSC with the ZnO interlayer was 23.65%. The representation of the color coordinates of the ST-OSC with Al(acac)3 is demonstrated in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram in Fig. 4f. The color coordinates (0.2569, 0.2571) are located in the low colorfulness area in the CIE chromaticity diagram, indicating good achromaticity. The corresponding color rendering index (CRI) of the ST-OSC with the Al(acac)3 and the ZnO interlayer is 94.6 (Table 2) and 94.3, respectively.

Also, long-term device stability is another critical issue that impedes the commercialization of ST-OSCs. Hence, the operational stabilities of ST-OSCs with the Al(acac)3 interlayer were monitored by measuring the PCE, Jsc, Voc, FF, the series resistance (Rs) and the parallel resistance (Rsh) as a function of time. Fig. 5 presents the degradation of these photovoltaic parameters under continuous LED illumination (spectral range from 410 nm to 690 nm) in an ambient environment with encapsulation. The photovoltaic parameters of the stability test shown in Fig. 5 were averaged over 12 individual devices. The area of the solar cells is 4 mm2. The stability of the device was tested at room temperature. According to the instructions of the equipment, the temperature will rise to 55 °C with time and then become stabilized. Within the first 10 hours, the PCE, Jsc and Rsh of the device show continuous degradation and Voc maintains almost the initial value. Meanwhile during the following 50 hours of continuous exposure, the PCE, Jsc, Voc, FF and Rsh tend to be flat, with an almost negligible reduction, and Rs shows a fluctuating increase. In summary, after 60 hours of continuous illumination, the PCE still retains 60% of the initial PCE, but Voc retains almost the initial value. The observed reduction in the PCE is mainly due to the decline of both Jsc and FF, with a nearly unchanged Voc. The results obtained in this work allow the conclusion that the Al(acac)3 interlayer is ideal for efficient and stable large area ST-OSCs.

In conclusion, a solution-processed low temperature Al(acac)3 film has been successfully fabricated and applied as a cathode buffer layer in ST-OSCs. Studies show that Al(acac)3 films possess outstanding optical features and a suitable energy level. Namely, the absorption of Al(acac)3 films with a thickness of 10 nm is as low as 1% and the transmittance is high, up to 95%, in the visible and near infrared regions, guaranteeing full absorption of the photoactive layer and a high CRI for ST-OSCs. Further, their suitable energy level ensures a smooth electron transport and collection process. By introducing Al(acac)3 films in ST-OSCs, the devices based on PM6:Y6 yield an efficiency of 12.41%, an AVT of 25.33% (from 370 nm to 740 nm) and a CRI of 94.6. Encouragingly, the large-area ST-OSC of 100 mm2 with the Al(acac)3 buffer layer yields a PCE of 11.28%. Furthermore, the long-term stability of ST-OSCs shows that the device with encapsulation retains 60% of the initial PCE over 60 hours of continuous illumination. The results indicate that Al(acac)3 is a promising cathode buffer layer for fabricating efficient, large area and stable semi-transparent organic solar cells.
