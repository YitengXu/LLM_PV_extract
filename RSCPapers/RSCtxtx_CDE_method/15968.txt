In this study, we synthesized four alcohol-soluble surfactant-encapsulated polyoxometalate complexes (SEPCs) containing four tetra-n-alkyl ammonium groups, namely {[CH3(CH2)n−1]4N}4[SiW12O40] (TA-SiW12, n = 2, 4, 8, and 10), and investigated the effect of the alkyl chain length of TA-SiW12 as a cathode interlayer (CIL) on the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Different alkyl chain lengths in the four TA-SiW12s resulted in different device performances. Highest power conversion efficiency (9.15%) was achieved for the PTB7:PC71BM-based PSC with TA-SiW12 (n = 8) due to its highest open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF). Combined measurements of the capacitance–voltage characteristics, charge carrier mobility, and photocurrent density-effective voltage characteristics demonstrated that incorporation of TA-SiW12 (n = 8) resulted in higher built-in potential, charge carrier density, and mobility, and better charge carrier extraction as compared to that of other TA-SiW12 (n = 2, 4, and 10) in the PSCs. AFM images showed that only TA-SiW12 (n = 8) formed homogeneous, closely packed, and well-distributed grain clusters with a quasi-periodic structure on the active layer, which explains the higher JSC and FF of the PSC with TA-SiW12 (n = 8).

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention owing to their unique advantages including synthetic variability, light weight, low-cost, and large-area roll to roll fabrication. To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs, introduction of an interlayer between the active layer and electrodes is an efficient strategy. To date, the PCE of PSCs with electrode interlayers has exceeded 10%, which is the threshold value required for commercial production. Among the large family of interlayer materials, alcohol/water-soluble cathode interlayer (CIL) materials have attracted significant attention because they can not only result in a significant enhancement in the device performance of PSCs but also prevent intermixing of multilayers during solution-process fabrication. To date, the reported alcohol/water-soluble CIL materials mainly consist of conjugated polymers, organic small molecules, graphene derivatives, and functionalized graphene quantum dots. In general, molecules used as a CIL contain ammonium salt groups or N,N-dimethylamino groups. On the one hand, these groups can ensure better solubility of organic materials in water or alcohol. On the other hand, an interfacial dipole can form at the interface between the CIL and the cathode, lowering the work function of the cathode. The surfactant tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), one of the common quaternary ammonium salts, has been successfully applied as a CIL to improve the performance of PSCs mainly due to the ordered arrangement between N+ and Br− in the self-assembled TOAB atop the active layer. However, the non-conductive TOAB forms large island clusters on the active layer; this limits the application of TOAB as a good CIL. Moreover, polyoxometalates (POMs), a large family of environmentally friendly inorganic clusters, were also used as CILs because of their unique properties such as highly tunable structural property, outstanding electron accepting ability, high transparency in the visible range, and facile processing from water or alcohol solutions. However, the acidic nature and severe aggregation of POMs on the active layer are detrimental to device performance and stability. Therefore, neither TOAB nor POMs is suitable for large-area production of PSCs with high efficiency and long lifetime although both are environmentally friendly, low-cost, and transparent CIL materials.

To overcome these drawbacks and utilize the advantages of TOAB and POMs, we recently reported a low-cost, high-yield, and alcohol soluble surfactant-encapsulated polyoxometalate complex (SEPC), namely [(C8H17)4N]4[SiW12O40], which consisted of quaternary ammonium salt groups and Keggin-type polyoxometalate. When a [(C8H17)4N]4[SiW12O40] film with a thickness of ∼10–15 nm was applied as the CIL in a conventional PSC based on PTB7-Th (poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)]benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]-dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]):PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester), a PCE of 10.1% was achieved. SEPCs were synthesized by replacing the protons of POMs with tetra-n-alkyl ammonium (TA) via ion–exchange reactions. Previous reports have suggested that the properties of SEPCs can be tuned via the appropriate choice of organic surfactants. TA was chosen to replace the protons of POMs for ensuring a better solubility of SEPCs in alcohol and an interfacial dipole at the interface between the CIL and cathode. Some reports have demonstrated that the length and shape of the alkyl chain attached to the alcohol/water-soluble CILs can affect film formation on the hydrophobic active layer and solubility in alcohol/water. Therefore it is meaningful to clarify the relationship between the alkyl chain length in SEPCs and performance of PSCs using SEPC as a CIL.
In this regard, herein, we carefully synthesized four novel alcohol-soluble SiW12-based SEPCs, namely {[CH3(CH2)n−1]4N}4[SiW12O40] (n = 2, 4, 8, and 10), containing TA (TA-SiW12). The four TA-SiW12s are TEA-SiW12 (n = 2), TBA-SiW12 (n = 4), TOA-SiW12 (n = 8), and TDA-SiW12 (n = 10), as shown in Fig. 1a. The effect of the alkyl chain length in TA-SiW12s on the performance of the PSCs was systematically studied. It was observed that different alkyl chain lengths in the four TA-SiW12s resulted in different device performances. Highest power conversion efficiency (9.15%) was achieved for the PTB7:PC71BM (Fig. 1b)-based PSC with TA-SiW12 due to highest open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF). Combined measurements of capacitance–voltage characteristics, charge carrier mobility, and photocurrent density-effective voltage characteristics demonstrated that incorporation of TOA-SiW12 gave rise to higher built-in potential, charge carrier density, and mobility, and better charge carrier extraction than that of other TA-SiW12s (n = 2, 4, and 10) in the PSCs. Additionally, AFM images showed that only TOA-SiW12 formed homogenous, closely packed, and well-distributed grain clusters with a quasi-periodic structure on the active layer; this may enhance the light-harvesting efficiency and decrease the recombination loss.

PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from 1-material Inc and American Dye Source, respectively. TA-SiW12s were synthesized as mentioned in ref. 36. All materials were used as received. The structure of the PSCs is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/TA-SiW12/Al (Fig. 1c) with the energy level alignment as shown in Fig. 1d. First, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto a cleaned ITO and annealed in air at 110 °C for 30 min. Secondly, active layer was spin-coated from a 25mg ml−1 blend solution of PTB7:PC71BM in 1:1.5 wt% in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodoctane (97:3, vol%) on PEDOT:PSS and then dried in vacuum overnight. Third, TA-SiW12 was deposited on the active layer via spin-coating from a methanol solution. Finally, 100 nm Al was deposited as a cathode via thermal evaporation under a pressure of 1 × 10−4 Pa. The structure of the hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/TA-SiW12/MoO3/Al. The structure of the electron-only devices is ITO/Al/LiF/PTB7:PC71BM/TA-SiW12/Al. TA-SiW12 films were deposited from a methanol solution with the concentrations of 0.25–2 mg mL−1 at 1000–2000 rpm for 60 seconds in a glove box under a N2 atmosphere. Detailed information about the solution concentration and film thickness for the four TA-SiW12s can be found in the ESI.


The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured under a N2 atmosphere in the glove box using Keithley 2400 under illumination and in the dark. Solar cell performance was tested under 1 sun, AM 1.5G full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech, model #SS50AAA-GB) at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National institute of metrology, China. EQE spectra were obtained using a Q Test HIFINITY 5 (Crowntech Inc. USA) at room temperature in air. Capacitance–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using an Agilent B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer with a CV module at a frequency of 10 kHz. AFM images were obtained using a S II Nanonaviprobe station 300 HV in the tapping mode. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic (UPS) experiments were carried out using a UPS system equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 analyzer in ultrahigh vacuum at a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 mbar. A monochromatized He Iα irradiation from a discharged lamp supplied photons of 21.22 eV for UPS.


To investigate the effect of different alkyl chain lengths in the TA-SiW12 on the device performance, we fabricated PTB7:PC71BM-based PSCs with the four TA-SiW12s as CILs deposited onto the active layer via spin-coating from their methanol solutions. For comparison, two control devices were also fabricated: the Al-only device without the CIL and the methanol-treated device obtained via spin-coating methanol on the active layer. Fig. 2 shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the four PSCs with an 8 nm TA-SiW12 and the two control devices under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (a) and in the dark (b). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters derived from Fig. 2a are presented in Table 1. To ensure the validity and repeatability of the data, at least 30 pixels (size = 2 × 2 mm2) were acquired for all device configurations. Under illumination, the Al-only device exhibited a PCE of 5.76% with a VOC of 0.715 V, JSC of 15.86 mA cm−2, and FF of 50.8%, and the average PCE was 5.42%. The average PCE values for the PSCs with TA-SiW12 as CILs were 5.35% for TEA-SiW12, 8.37% for TBA-SiW12, 8.95% for TOA-SiW12, and 8.50% for TDA-SiW12. Obviously, PCE of the PSCs is related to the alkyl chain lengths of TA-SiW12s. Except for TEA-SiW12, the three TA-SiW12s (n = 4, 8, and 10) resulted in simultaneous enhancements in VOC, JSC, and FF as compared to the Al-only device. In particular, a maximum PCE of 9.15% was achieved for the PSC with TOA-SiW12 (n = 8) due to the highest VOC, JSC, and FF. However, the methanol/Al only device exhibited a slight increase in VOC, JSC, and FF, leading to the average PCE of 7.12%. This suggests that the enhanced PCEs of the devices with the CIL are mainly contributed by the CIL themselves rather than their solvent (methanol).

In addition, we also investigated the effect of the thickness of the TA-SiW12 film on the device performance of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/TA-SiW12/Al. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs with TOA-SiW12, TEA-SiW12, TBA-SiW12, or TDA-SiW12 of different thicknesses under illumination are shown in Fig. S1–S4, respectively. Photovoltaic parameters derived from Fig. S1–S4 are summarized in Tables S1–S4. As presented in Tables S1–S4, 8 nm was the optimal thickness for all TA-SiW12s. Therefore, we selected 8 nm as the thickness of all TA-SiW12s discussed in the manuscript for comparison. For TOA-SiW12, which exhibits highest PCE among the four CILs, the effect of the thickness on the device performance is not as pronounced. Thus, when the thickness of TOA-SiW12 is 17 nm, PCE can still reach 8.70%, which is 95% of the optimal PCE (9.15%) of the PSC with 8 nm TOA-SiW12 (Table S1).

As shown in Table 1, the PSCs with TA-SiW12s (n = 4, 8, and 10) have similar VOC values (0.75–0.76 V), which are much higher than those of the Al-only device (0.715 V) and the PSCs with TEA-SiW12 (0.64 V). The VOC change can be explained by the change of work function (WF) of Al modified by TA-SiW12s via the UPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a, the WF of bare Al is 3.9 eV, whereas the WFs of Al covered by 8 nm TEA-SiW12, TBA-SiW12, TOA-SiW12, and TDA-SiW12 are 4.0 eV, 3.7 eV, 3.2 eV, and 3.6 eV, respectively. The WF rank is consistent with the sequence of VOC. Obviously, the alkyl chain length of TA-SiW12s affected the WF of Al/TA-SiW12s and VOC.

The built-in voltage (Vbi) influences the internal electric field in the PSCs and gives the upper limit VOC provided that the WF difference of the electrodes is larger than the HOMOdonor–LUMOacceptor offset in the PSCs. Thus, the differences in VOC should be consistent with the differences in Vbi across the devices. To confirm this speculation, we conducted the capacitance (C) versus voltage (V) measurements of the five devices with and without TA-SiW12. Fig. 3b shows the (C/A)−2V curves of the devices in the dark. The value of Vbi is estimated by the Mott–Schottky relation (eqn (1)) as follows:
(1)
where
Vbi represents the flat-band potential, which is obtained from the intercept of the linear (C/A)−2–V, q represents the elementary charge, ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, εr represents the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor, and A is the active area of the device. The Vbi values obtained from eqn (1) are 0.73 V for the Al-only device, 0.69 V for the device with TEA-SiW12, 0.80 V for the device with TBA-SiW12, 0.83 V for the device with TOA-SiW12, and 0.81 V for the device with TDA-SiW12. The Vbi of the device with TOA-SiW12 is markedly higher than that of the other devices, which explains its higher VOC (0.76 V). This result is consistent with the differences in the VOC of the four devices with TA-SiW12.


According to eqn (1), the charge carrier density N can be derived from the slope of linear (C/A)−2–V (Fig. 3b). The incorporation of TA-SiW12 resulted in an increase of N from 1.66 × 1016 cm−3 for the Al-only device to 2.09 × 1016 cm−3 for TEA-SiW12/Al, 2.59 × 1016 cm−3 for TBA-SiW12/Al, 4.35 × 1016 cm−3 for TOA-SiW12/Al, and 2.32 × 1016 cm−3 for TDA-SiW12/Al. Obviously, there is a higher charge carrier density in the device with TOA-SiW12 (n = 8) than that in other devices, such that the PSC with TOA-SiW12 demonstrates a higher JSC.

To achieve a deeper understanding of the improved JSC of the PTB7:PC71BM devices with TA-SiW12, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of all devices was measured, as shown in Fig. 4a. EQE can detect a discrepancy of JSC that easily leads to overvalued PCE. The JEQESC values calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra, as listed in Table 1, are basically in agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V characteristics under illumination. This reveals that the efficiency of photon to electron conversion is increased over the whole absorption spectrum via the intercalation of TA-SiW12, and a maximum conversion was achieved for TOA-SiW12. To explore the original possibility of the EQE enhancement, the reflectance (R) of all the PSCs was measured and is shown in Fig. 4b. Compared to that of the Al-only device, the Rs of the devices with TA-SiW12s remarkably decreased over a broadband range from 300 to 750 nm, which was consistent with the EQE enhancement. This indicates that the enhancement of JSC mainly originates from the absorption (A) enhancement of the devices with TA-SiW12s, where A is obtained from the equation A = 1 − R − T (T: transmittance, assuming T = 0 in the devices). The R of the PSC with TOA-SiW12 (n = 8) is the lowest over a broadband range from 300 to 750 nm, leading to the highest JSC.

The charge transport ability in the PSCs with TA-SiW12s was investigated using the space charge limited current method as well. Mobilities of the electron and hole were measured in the hole-only (Fig. 5a) and electron-only (Fig. 5b) devices according to the equation
J = 9/8ε0εrμ(V − Vbi − Vr)2/L3
where
ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, εr represents the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor, L is the thickness of the device, μ is the single charge mobility, Vbi is the difference of WF between two electrodes in single charge devices, Vr is the voltage drop due to the resistance of ITO and series resistance of the devices, and V is the scan voltage. For the Al-only device, the mobilities of the electron and hole are 2.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 1). When TA-SiW12s were incorporated as CILs, the mobilities of the hole in all the devices increased by more or less one order of magnitude to be 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This can be attributed to the solvent (methanol) effect of TA-SiW12s on the morphology of the active layer. Moreover, the mobilities of electrons for the devices with TA-SiW12s increased to 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TEA-SiW12, 8.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TBA-SiW12, 4.48 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TOA-SiW12, and 4.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TDA-SiW12. These results show that the introduction of TA-SiW12 can improve the electron transport, and the electron mobilities of the devices are related to the alkyl chain lengths of TA-SiW12s. The highest electron mobility in the PSC with TOA-SiW12 is believed to contribute to the highest JSC and FF.

The best performance of the device with TOA-SiW12 is further supported by the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff), where Jph = JL − JD (JL and JD are the current density under illumination (Fig. 2a) and dark (Fig. 2b) conditions, respectively) and Veff = V0 − V (V0 is voltage at Jph = 0 and V is applied voltage), as shown in Fig. 6. At sufficiently high Veff, the photocurrent is saturated without recombination (Jph,sat). The Jph/Jph,sat ratio is the product of exciton dissociation and charge collection probabilities. Under short-circuit conditions, the reference device has a Jph,sc/Jph,sat ratio of 93.1%, whereas the Jph,sc/Jph,sat ratios of the PSCs with TEA-SiW12, TBA-SiW12, TOA-SiW12, and TDA-SiW12 are 95.2%, 95.8%, 97.5%, and 96.1%, respectively. This implies that the PSC with TOA-SiW12 has better exciton dissociation. Under the maximum power output condition, the PSC with TOA-SiW12 also shows higher Jph,max/Jph,sat ratio (83.8%) than other PSCs (Jph,max/Jph,sat = 70.0% for bare Al, 74.5% for TEA-SiW12, 77.2% for TBA-SiW12, and 80.7% for TDA-SiW12). This suggests that the TOA-SiW12-based PSC exhibits enhanced charge extraction and collection.

As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the four PSCs with different TA-SiW12s exhibit different device performances. To clarify the influence of alkyl chain length of TA-SiW12s on the performance of PSCs, we characterized the surface morphology of 8 nm TA-SiW12 film on the active layer via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 7 presents the phase images of bare PTB7:PC71BM and the four TA-SiW12s on PTB7:PC71BM in the scale of 2 μm × 2 μm. The corresponding phase images and height images in the scale of 5 μm × 5 μm are displayed in Fig. S5. The surface of the bare PTB7:PC71BM film appears smooth with no grains, as seen in Fig. 7a and S5A. However, TA-SiW12s with different alkyl chain lengths apparently exhibit different morphologies on PTB7:PC71BM. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of TA-SiW12 gradually becomes larger, from 1.6 nm for TEA-SiW12 (n = 2), 1.89 nm for TBA-SiW12 (n = 4), 2.30 nm for TOA-SiW12 (n = 8) to 3.65 nm for TDA-SiW12 (n = 10), with the increase in the alkyl chain length. TASiW-12s form some grain clusters on PTB7:PC71BM. Moreover, the size of the grain clusters increases with the alkyl chain length. Surface of TEA-SiW12 contains some tiny aggregations without clear boundaries, as shown in Fig. 7b and S5B. Heterogeneous agglomerates on the TBA-SiW12 surface become severe and even a few holes inside the TBA-SiW12 layer can be found, as shown in Fig. 7c and S5C. Unlike TA-SiW12 with n = 2 and 4, TA-SiW12 with n = 8 and 10 present distinct grain clusters with apparent boundaries. In particular, grain clusters on the TOA-SiW12 surface are homogenous, closely packed, and well-distributed, as shown in Fig. 7d and S5D. More importantly, a peak-to-peak distance of about 120–150 nm between clusters and a quasi-periodic structure can be observed in Fig. 7f obtained from the profile line marked in blue in Fig. 7d. Although there are clear grain clusters on TDA-SiW12, their size with peak-to-peak distance of about 180–360 nm (Fig. S6a) is too large to form a whole continuous film and fully cover the underlying active layer. Moreover, the distribution of clusters on the rough surface of TDA-SiW12 is uneven, as shown in Fig. 7e and S5E. These results demonstrate that the morphology of TA-SiW12 can be tuned by choosing an appropriate alkyl chain because their self-assembly on the active layer is related to the alkyl chain length of ammonium groups. On combining the AFM analysis and reflectance measurement results, we speculated that the periodic corrugated and closely packed surface morphology of TOA-SiW12 may be more beneficial for the absorption of sunlight in the devices that could cause optical spacer effects. It rationalizes the higher JSC and FF of the PSC with TOA-SiW12.


In summary, we carefully synthesized four novel alcohol soluble CIL materials, namely, {[CH3(CH2)n−1]4N}4[SiW12O40] (TA-SiW12s, n = 2, 4, 8, and 10) and investigated the effect of the alkyl chain length of the TA-SiW12s on the device performance of PSCs. The PSCs with the four different TA-SiW12s as the CILs exhibited different device performances. Highest PCE (9.15%) was achieved for the PTB7:PC71BM-based PSC with TOA-SiW12 (n = 8) due to the highest VOC, JSC, and FF. Combined measurements of C–V characteristics, charge carrier mobility, and Jph–Veff characteristics demonstrated that incorporation of TOA-SiW12 can give rise to higher built-in potential, charge carrier density, and mobility, and better charge carrier extraction than that of other TA-SiW12s (n = 2, 4, and 10) in the PSCs. AFM images show that only TOA-SiW12 forms homogenous, closely packed, and well-distributed grain clusters with a quasi-periodic structure, which explains the higher JSC and FF of the PSC with TOA-SiW12.
