A nanostructured back reflective electrode with nanobowl-shaped 2D nanohole arrays made from a polystyrene (PS) nanosphere template was developed for enhancing the efficiency of top-illuminated organic solar cells with MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (10 nm)/MoOx (25 nm) stacks as transparent electrodes. The high-performance top electrode with a transmittance of 88.05% at 550 nm and a sheet resistance of 5.93 Ω sq−1 reached an extremely high figure of merit (σdc/σopt = 484). Incorporating plasmonic-assisted electrodes into a poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) blend system increased the cell efficiency from 2.91% to 3.35% compared with devices using a planar back electrode. We attributed the efficiency enhancement to the substantial scattering of back-reflected light and enhanced near-field absorption in the proximity of nanoholes.

Recent years have seen organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) receiving a great deal of attention as candidates for low-cost solar energy conversion due to their advantages of easy large-scale fabrication, relatively inexpensive low-temperature processes, and good compatibility with flexible substrates compared with their inorganic counterparts. However, due to the intrinsically limited nature of low carrier mobility and short exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors, considerable effort has been devoted to achieving high-performance solar cells by means of developing new absorber materials, designing innovative device structures, and exploiting optical engineering to manipulate light harvesting. Moreover, there is an urgent need to find an alternative to extensively used indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes as the fragility, inflexibility, scarcity, and high cost of indium restrict their application in flexible organic solar cells. Top-illuminated inverted device architectures with an ITO-free electrode have been proposed to not only remedy the electrode problems mentioned above, including device degradation from the use of easily oxidized metal at a top opaque electrode (e.g., Ca or Al) for a typically normal structure, but also to obviate the need for transparent substrates (e.g., glass or plastics) with the replacement of opaque substrates (e.g., stainless steel foils, papers, and textiles) due to the reversal of the illumination direction. For example, Glatthaar et al. showed an inverted P3HT:PC61BM device with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.4% using a PEDOT:PSS/Au grid layer as a top illuminated electrode and an Al/Ti bilayer as a bottom reflective electrode. Cao et al. promoted the efficiency up to 2.5% for the same photovoltaic organic semiconductor system using an oxide/thin metal/oxide trilayer structure as a top transparent electrode.

To further improve the efficiency of top-illuminated devices, various strategies for light-trapping have been proposed, such as microcavity architectures and plasmonic nanostructures. Chen et al. reported a PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM based OPV adopting a microcavity configuration using Ag/TeO2 as an optical incident electrode with PCE reaching 8.5%, which was 20% higher than that of ITO-based devices. An et al. used plasmonic rear electrodes fabricated from a high-temperature annealed thin Ag film to obtain PTB7:PC70BM based OPVs with a PCE of up to 7.18%, a 25% improvement over flat reference devices. In this paper, we successfully demonstrated top-illuminated ITO-free OSCs with a nanobowl-shaped back reflective Ag electrode and a P3HT:PC61BM absorber film by incorporating a plasmon-active electrode into the microcavity configuration. Due to the fact that the fabrication process of top-illuminated OSCs typically starts with a first deposition of an optically opaque metal film, we can easily pattern the back metal electrode inside cells and precisely control the well-defined period, diameter, and depth of 2D hole arrays by using the polystyrene (PS) nanosphere template method. Combined with a high-performance MoOx/Ag/MoOx top electrode with a transmittance of 88.05% at 550 nm and a sheet resistance of 5.93 ± 0.15 Ω sq−1, which achieved an extremely high figure of merit (σdc/σopt = 484), the power conversion efficiency of nanostructured OSCs was 15% higher than that of reference cells with a planar back reflective electrode due to the light-scattering effect and plasmon-enhanced absorption near the periphery of the hole, verified by the comparison analysis of near-field optical simulations for both cells.

The nanobowl-shaped rear Ag electrode with a hexagonal array of periodic circular holes was fabricated using a polystyrene (PS) nanosphere template. First, the PS nanosphere solution was prepared by diluting a colloidal suspension of 400 μl (bead size: 400 nm; size deviation: <10%; concentration: 10 wt% in DI water; Golden Innovation Business Co., Taiwan) with a dispersion solution of 200 μl (Triton X-100/MeOH, 1:400, v/v). The PS solution was spin-coated onto a pre-cleaned glass substrate using a two-step procedure (1000 rpm for 60 s, then 1500 rpm for 10 s) to form a close-packed hexagonal monolayer of nanospheres. The diameter of PS beads was then diminished through oxygen reactive-ion etching (RIE) (Oxford, Plasmalab 80 Plus, UK) (flow rate: 20 sccm; pressure: 50 mTorr; RF power: 50 W for 3 min). After RIE, a chromium film (2 nm) followed by a gold film (15 nm) was vertically deposited onto the surface of the PS-coated substrate by electron beam evaporation. Chromium was used as the adhesion layer between the glass substrate and the metal layer and a gold film was used to define the depth of the hole in the resulting nanobowl-shaped rear Ag electrode. The etched PS mask was removed mechanically using adhesive tape (Scotch Magic Tape 810, 3M France) and then cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, followed by drying with N2 gas. Finally, the nanostructured rear metal electrode was obtained by vertically depositing a 70 nm-thick Ag film onto the metallic nanomesh.

To match the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PC61BM and facilitate electron transport from the active layer to the cathode, a ∼10 nm-thick polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) layer was coated onto the Ag film at 5000 rpm for 60 s and then air-annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The layer was made by a solution made by dissolving 0.4 g of PEIE (Sigma-Aldrich, 35–40 wt% in H2O) in 100 g of 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%). Subsequently, the active layer was cast from a solution containing 1 wt% poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) (Uni-Onward Corp., >99.5%) (1:1, w/w) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 800 rpm for 60 s inside a N2 filled glove box. The photovoltaic layer was left in a glass Petri dish at room temperature for 60 min for slow solvent evaporation, and then thermally annealed at 170 °C for 10 min to obtain a ∼95 nm-thick active layer. The devices were completed after thermal evaporation of MoOx (10 nm), Ag (10 nm), and MoOx (25 nm) through a shadow mask under a pressure of 6 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of 0.04 cm2 was defined by the overlap of the patterned bottom Ag electrode and the top transparent one. The finger grid types of both bottom and top electrodes were deposited using a shadow mask with 2 mm wide fingers. The anode of external wire was then connected with the top electrode through the outer finger of the bottom electrode, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). For a reference device with a planar rear Ag electrode, all processing conditions except for no use of a PS nanosphere template were kept the same as for a device with a nanostructured one. The fabrication process is summarized in Fig. 1.

The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices were measured using a power meter (Keithley 2400) in the dark and under a simulated AM 1.5 G spectrum provided by a class A solar simulator (Newport 91160A) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a silicon reference cell. The EQE spectra were recorded using a home-made system comprising an AM 1.5 G solar simulator, a monochromator, and a lock-in amplifier for photocurrent detection from the device under short-circuit conditions with normal illumination. Specular transmittance and total reflectance spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Jasco V-550) equipped with an integrating sphere reflectance accessory. Sheet resistance was measured using the four-point probe system and the average value was taken from at least 5 different locations. Film thickness was evaluated using a V-VASE variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam Inc.) and a step profiler (DektakXT, Bruker). Optical modeling of the devices was performed using the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method (FullWave 6.1, Rsoft). Surface morphology of the nanostructured Ag electrode was characterized by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Veeco di Innva SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Helios NanoLab 660).


To prepare a nanostructured bottom Ag electrode with shallow holes with a well-defined period, diameter, and depth, a double layer of a Cr/Au thin film was first deposited onto the PS nanosphere mask using RIE etching for 3 min, then the colloidal particles were lifted off with adhesive tape, and finally completed by a 70 nm-thick Ag layer through vertical electron beam deposition. The period of resulting nanostructures was determined by the size of the original PS nanosphere (400 nm), which was proposed to have higher light-trapping efficiency for metallic nanostructures with periods of 300–500 nm.Fig. 2 shows the SEM and AFM images of the nanostructured bottom Ag electrode. It is clear that all of the features were perfectly constructed by means of a PS nanosphere template and the diameter of the hole was about 300 nm, as indicated in Fig. 2(a). The depth of the hole controlled from the deposited thickness of a Cr/Au double layer was about 20 nm and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of back reflection electrodes was 8.23 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c).

Due to the top-illuminated device architecture, a top transparent electrode with the requirements of high transparency and low sheet resistivity plays an important role in controlling the amount of incoming light and photo-carrier transportation. By tuning the deposition rates and thicknesses of multilayer MoOx/Ag/MoOx thin films, based on our previous study, the optimised combination of 10 nm MoOx/10 nm Ag/25 nm MoOx achieved a sheet resistance of 5.93 ± 0.15 Ω sq−1 with a transmittance of 88.05% at 550 nm, subtracting the glass substrate losses. The figure of merit (FoM) σdc/σopt can be calculated by,

where
σdc is the direct current conductivity and σopt is the optical conductivity of the film, reached a remarkably high value of 484 and was even four times higher than that of commercially available ITO (Rsh = 23.52 Ω sq−1, T (550 nm) = 87.05%, FoM = 112). As seen in Fig. 3, the maximum transmittance (92.94%) of the top transparent electrode is located at 483 nm, coinciding well with the absorption peak of the P3HT:PC61BM layer and consequently beneficial for harvesting more photons to convert into photoelectrons. In addition, the absorption range of the electrode was mainly located at wavelengths longer than 700 nm and below 350 nm, where the photoactive layers absorb less photons from sunlight. It is noted that the first inner MoOx layer can serve as the anode interfacial layer, which helps reduce the injection barrier between Ag and P3HT-rich domains and improves hole transportation, and the second outer MoOx layer functions as an index-matching layer to tailor the optical transmission of the thin metal film and reduce the strong reflection between Ag and air caused by index mismatching. The obtained optoelectrical properties of the multilayer top transparent electrode are summarized in Table 1.

To demonstrate the application of metal nanostructures with nanobowl-shaped light-trapping configuration on the efficiency enhancement of polymer solar cells, they were incorporated into top-illuminated devices with an inverted device architecture as the layer sequence of glass/cathode/PEIE/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag/MoOx (cathode: a nanostructured and planar Ag film as the reference device), as seen in Fig. 1(g). Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics of OPVs with a nanostructured and planar back reflective electrode under simulated solar irradiation under AM 1.5 conditions. The device with a nanostructured electrode exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.6 ± 0.00 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.5 ± 0.17 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 65.7 ± 0.11%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.35 ± 0.06%, while the reference device showed a Voc of 0.58 ± 0.01 V, a Jsc of 7.91 ± 0.06 mA cm−2, a FF of 63.17 ± 3.01%, and a PCE of 2.91 ± 0.06%. We also studied other dimensions by prolonging the oxygen reactive-ion etching time of the PS nanosphere template to reduce the hole diameter of the resulting rear Ag electrode. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), the device with a nanostructured rear Ag electrode had 220 nm wide and 20 nm deep holes. It exhibited a low efficiency with a Voc of 0.6 V, a Jsc of 8.15 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.37%. The PCE was 3.25% due to the relatively low photocurrent when compared with the device with nanostructure dimensions of 300 nm and 25 nm for the diameter and depth, respectively. The obtained photovoltaic performance data are summarized in Table 2. The 15% improvement of PCE relative to the reference device is due to the increasing Jsc and FF. The enhancement of Jsc can be attributed to the enhanced light-trapping efficiency in the PSCs featuring a nanostructured back reflective electrode due to the light-scattering effect and plasmon-enhanced absorption of the active layer. In addition, the FF was improved, partly owing to reduced series resistance resulting from an increase of the effective interfacial contact area between the absorber layer and metal back contact. Voc remained the same for both devices. The highest efficiency of the proposed device was 3.39%. To our knowledge, this value is the highest efficiency value reported for ITO-free top-illuminated OPVs with a P3HT:PC61BM blend layer.

To further clarify the light-trapping behaviour of cells, we measured the total reflectance spectra of devices with nanostructured and planar back reflective electrodes and evaluated the absorption within the devices, based on the equation A = 1 − R − T, where R is the reflectance, T is the transmittance which is nearly zero due to the opaque reflective electrode, and A is the absorbance. As depicted in Fig. 5(a), it can be seen that the nanostructured devices showed lower reflectivity at λ < 700 nm than the reference device, and the ratio of extracted absorption of the nanostructured devices was explicitly increased and reached a maximum value of 1.7 at 640 nm compared with the reference one. The substantial scattering as well as reflection of light induced by the nanopatterned interface, including between the bottom patterned Ag electrode and the active layer and between the top transparent electrode and air, contributed to a higher intensity of total reflectance at λ > 700 nm, which the P3HT:PC61BM layer did not absorb. This revealed that devices with nanostructured back reflective electrodes can capture more light than reference devices. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of nanostructured devices was enhanced over a wide spectral region from 400 to 700 nm and the maximum EQE value increased from 55.26% to 60.58% at 500 nm, which was consistent with the measured reflectance results and clearly manifested the efficient conversion of photocurrent in this wavelength range.

To elucidate enhanced device absorption resulting from the synergetic effect of light scattering and plasmonic absorption of a light-harvesting system adopting back reflective electrodes with 2D periodic nanobowl arrays, we conducted near-field optical simulations for two types of cells. Fig. 6(a) shows the simulated optical field intensity distribution of both devices at normal incident wavelengths of 400, 500, 600, and 640 nm for TM polarization. For the planar device, the field intensity appears as an interference pattern due to the microcavity configuration formed between the top thin Ag and bottom opaque Ag electrodes. For the nanostructured device, enhancement in the field intensity occurs along the periphery of the hole and the evanescent field for the excited surface plasmon extends into the active layer, which can be attributed to surface plasmon polaritons or bound waves that travel along the Ag/PEIE interface. To further clarify surface plasmon-enhanced absorption within an active layer, we plotted the ratios of |E|2 of a nanostructured device to that of a planar device along the Z direction at each X position inside the active layer at wavelengths of 400, 500, 600 and 640 nm, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The figure clearly shows that the electrical intensity within the active layer is stronger in the nanostructured device, and the ratios at a wavelength of 600 nm are higher than others and increased from 6 to 1.5 times over the whole active region, probably due to the fact that the maximum plasmonic field emerges near 600 nm. For a normal incident light, the resonant wavelength of the Bloch wave-SPP for one-dimensional structures can be described by

where
i is the resonant order, P is the period of the nanostructure, εm is the dielectric constant of the metal, and n is the surrounding refractive index. Using εm = −16.074 + 0.44233i for silver, i = 1, n = 1.3986 for PEIE and P = 400 nm, the resonant position predicted by eqn (2) is 596.9 nm, which is consistent with the simulation data.


In summary, we have successfully developed a simple approach adopting the polystyrene (PS) nanosphere template method to realise top-illuminated inverted OSCs featuring a nanobowl-shaped light-reflective Ag electrode and a light-incident ITO-free electrode with excellent optoelectrical properties. The light-trapping efficiency of nanostructured devices was significantly enhanced compared to reference cells with a planar back electrode due to the following reasons: (1) the transmittance spectra of the MoOx/Ag/MoOx top transparent electrode were tailored to improve light incoupling into the cells and match the absorption profile of photoactive layers, (2) the optical path length of reflected light was diffracted and thus prolonged via 2D periodic hole arrays, and (3) the active layer absorption was enhanced in the vicinity of the excited surface plasmon polaritons along the periphery of the hole. The application of plasmonic reflective metal electrodes on OPVs offers great potential for efficient breakthrough of highly performing perovskite-sensitized solar cells.
