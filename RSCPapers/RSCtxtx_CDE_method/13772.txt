A novel solution-processed cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-doped [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) film prepared by an extremely facile method is demonstrated as an effective cathode interfacial layer for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our results indicate that efficient doping takes place via anion-induced electron transfer between the bromide anions (Br−) on CTAB and PC61BM in the solid state, leading to a dramatic increase in electrical conductivity by more than five orders of magnitude. In addition, the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer is capable of turning a more air-stable, high work-function (WF) Ag layer into an efficient low WF electrode as a result of the formation of favorable interfacial dipoles between Ag and the active layer. These characteristics enable the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer to function as both an electron transport layer and a cathode buffer layer (CBL) in PSCs, thus simplifying the manufacturing process. This doped layer also exerts multi-positive effects for use in PSCs, including efficient interfacial charge transfer ability, superior charge selectivity, good film coverage on the perovskite layer, relatively weak thickness-dependent performance properties, general applicability to different perovskite materials, and good ambient stability. With this n-doped PC61BM layer, the device delivers a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 17.11%, which is superior to those of the devices with undoped PC61BM layers (2.15%) and state-of-the-art CBL ZnO nanoparticles (10.45%). The application of the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer in large-area solar cells (active area = 1.2 cm2) is also demonstrated, and a remarkable PCE of 15.42% is achieved, which represents one of the highest PCE values for PSCs with a similar active area. More significantly, the resulting devices possess good ambient stability without the need for rigorous encapsulation.

Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently emerged at the forefront of next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their potential for cost-effective manufacturing, light weight, and mechanical flexibility. The most widely studied perovskite material is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), while formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) has gained much attention recently because of its superior light-harvesting abilities. To date, the development of PSCs with a planar heterojunction structure has suppressed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19%, thanks to significant progress made in the improvement of perovskite thin film quality and engineering the interface properties between the active layer and the electrode. Ideally, the work-function (WF) of the cathode and anode should be aligned with the energy of the photo-excited quasi-Fermi levels of the active layer to ensure ohmic contact for maximizing achievable open-circuit voltage (Voc) and minimizing energy barriers for charge extraction without causing excessive interface recombination.

A basic planar heterojunction PSC device is the sandwich of light absorbing perovskite active layers between the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL) that are in contact with their corresponding electrodes. Among various device architectures utilized in planar heterojunction PSCs, the inverted architecture with a configuration of the substrate/anode/HTL/perovskite/ETL/cathode has drawn much attention due to its low processing temperature and potential for use in plastic flexible devices. A typically inverted device comprises indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/cathode. Currently, low WF metals such as Al (∼4.1 eV) or Ca (∼2.9 eV) are often used as cathode electrodes to ensure efficient electron extraction. Nevertheless, these low-work-function metals are vulnerable to oxidation in the ambient environment, leading to poor device stability. Although the use of more environmentally stable high WF metals such as Au (∼5.1 eV) or Ag (∼4.7 eV) as cathodes is highly desirable; the mismatch between the WF of these metals and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the PC61BM (∼4.1 eV) ETL generally deteriorates the device performance. To circumvent this problem, an effective strategy is to incorporate an additional cathode buffer layer (CBL) between the PC61BM ETL and high WF cathode. Several solution-processed CBL materials, such as metal oxides or cationic quaternary ammonium-based molecules, have been applied to improve the contact properties and consequently enhance the device performance. These CBL materials have good solubility in polar solvents that enable multilayer film deposition without destroying the underlying PC61BM layer. In addition, they can generally induce a favorable interfacial dipole to lower the WF of the electrode and consequently a better energy level alignment at the PC61BM–electrode interface, leading to significantly improved device performance. Despite these perceived advantages, the incorporation of these CBLs certainly increases the fabrication complexity and reduces the reproducibility due to the requirements of additional coating steps and accurate layer thicknesses. Given that an effective CBL must be thin, typically in the range of 5–25 nm, it is therefore particularly challenging to deposit uniform and pinhole-free CBLs on the rough PC61BM/perovskite surface. The insufficient CBL film coverage can create electrical shunting paths, thus leading to deteriorated device performance.
This study aims to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by developing a novel n-doped PC61BM that is capable of serving as both an ETL and a CBL in PSCs with more environmentally stable high WF Ag as the cathode layer. The device configuration used herein is glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/n-doped PC61BM/Ag, as depicted in Fig. 1a. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the n-doped fullerene layer that can function as both an ETL and a CBL in PSCs. Previous studies have shown that alkyl ammonium-based surfactants are effective n-type dopants that can cause n-doping of fullerenes via anion-induced electron transfer. In our approach, we incorporate commercially available cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the n-type dopant into PC61BM host material (see Fig. 1a for the chemical structures). The long alkyl chain on the CTAB surfactant can ensure high solubility in various organic solvents and good stability, whereas quaternary ammonium cations can induce the formation of favorable interfacial dipoles to lower the WF of the Ag electrode. Our results also confirm that efficient doping occurs via anion-induced electron transfer between the bromide anions (Br−) on CTAB and PC61BM in the solid state, leading to a dramatic increase in electrical conductivity (by more than five orders of magnitude). In addition, this doped PC61BM layer delivers several remarkable features for use in PSCs, including efficient interfacial charge transfer ability, superior charge selectivity, good film coverage on the perovskite layer, relatively weak thickness-dependent performance properties, reasonable ambient stability, and general applicability to different perovskite systems (MAPbI3 and FAPbI3). With these desired properties, PSCs deliver a PCE up to 17.11% with high reproducibility, greatly outperforming the devices with the undoped PC61BM film and state-of-the-art CBL ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). Importantly, the resulting devices possess good ambient stability without the need for rigorous encapsulation. More significantly, the applicability of this approach in large-area devices (1.2 cm2) is also demonstrated, and a remarkable PCE up to 15.42% is achieved. This work demonstrates an effective approach to improve the performance and stability of PSCs through facile chemical doping.

To confirm efficient electron transfer from the anions of CTAB to PC61BM, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of PC61BM films with and without adding the CTAB dopant were recorded at room temperature (Fig. 1b). The films were deposited on the walls of quartz EPR tubes by evaporation of the solvent (chloroform) under vacuum at 60 °C. As shown in Fig. 1b, no appreciable paramagnetic signal was observed for the undoped film, indicating its semiconducting nature. In contrast, the doped film revealed a strong paramagnetic signal, suggesting the formation of n-doped fullerene radical anions. We then studied the influence of CTAB doping on the electrical properties of the PC61BM film. The electrical conductivities of the PC61BM film at varied dopant concentrations were measured by the four-point probe technique, and the results are depicted in Fig. 1c. As the concentration of CTAB increased, the conductivity first increased dramatically. As shown in Fig. 1c, the conductivity increased from 2.1 × 10−8 S cm−1 (undoped film) to a maximum of 4.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 (doping concentration = 10 mol%), which is comparable to those of the other organic conducting materials such as PEDOT:PSS (10−3 S cm−1 for Clevious P AI4083) and anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes (∼1.5 × 10−3 S cm−1). When the doping concentrations were further increased beyond 10 mol%, however, the conductivity decreased gradually (Fig. 1c). This deterioration could be ascribed to the tendency of excess CTAB-caused aggregation and will be discussed later. In addition to the reasonable conductivity, we observed that the doped PC61BM film (doping concentration = 10 mol%) possessed good ambient stability: electrical conductivity remained fairly high (>10−3 S cm−1) upon exposure to ambient air (30 °C, ∼60% relative humidity) for more than 110 h (Fig. 1d). This result suggests that negative charge carriers within the doped film are not quenched significantly by ambient oxygen and moisture, which may be associated with the hydrophobic nature of the PC61BM film.

To gain more insight into the morphological alteration of PC61BM-coated MAPbI3 perovskite films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out in tapping mode. The obtained topography images of 5 μm × 5 μm scans of the films are depicted in Fig. 2. The MAPbI3 perovskite film was prepared by two-step sequential solution deposition, and its detailed characterization can be found in our previous studies. The pristine perovskite sample (i.e., without the PC61BM layer) revealed an inhomogeneous and incomplete film morphology, with a root mean square (rms) roughness of ∼25.9 nm ((ESI) Fig. S1). The introduction of the undoped PC61BM layer, however, can only partially fill the voids in the underlying layers, as the PC61BM-coated sample still revealed a void-presented morphology with a high root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of 3.9 nm (Fig. 2a). When mixing CTAB in a chloroform solution of PC61BM, we have noticed that the solution became considerably viscous. This can be ascribed to the coulombic interaction between the PC61BM radical anion and cetyltrimethylammonium cation, of which the floppy hydrocarbon chain of the cetyl group limits the fluidity of such an ion pair in chloroform. The combination of the ion pair interaction and long floppy cetyl group reduces the aggregation of PC61BM and facilitates the coverage of the PC61BM film onto the perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, PC61BM films with the CTAB doping concentration below 10 mol% revealed a uniform and void-free morphology, suggesting that the addition of the CTAB dopant could facilitate the formation of a uniform PC61BM film. We also noticed that these films were quite smooth (rms roughness ∼1.6 nm) with no obvious phase separation, indicating high miscibility between PC61BM and CTAB. A further increase in the doping concentration of CTAB beyond 10 mol% revealed a greater surface roughness (rms roughness ∼ 3.4 nm) with more pronounced phase-separated domains (Fig. 2d and e). This would hinder efficient charge transport between neighbouring domains and thus lead to low conductivity, as depicted in Fig. 1c.
In order to investigate if the doped film could contribute to efficient charge transfer at the perovskite/PC61BM interface, we carried out steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay measurements. The PL properties of glass/MAPbI3, glass/MAPbI3/PC61BM, and glass/MAPbI3/CTAB-doped PC61BM (doping concentration = 10 mol%) were measured under excitation at a wavelength of 450 nm, and PL emission was collected from the glass substrate side. As shown in Fig. 3a, the significant PL quenching effect was observed when the perovskite layer formed a contact with either undoped PC61BM or doped PC61BM layers. The quenching of PL intensity is consistent with previous studies and is generally ascribed to charge transfer at the perovskite/fullerene interface. For the undoped PC61BM-coated sample, ∼4% PL intensity was retained, while nearly all intensities were quenched for the doped PC61BM-coated sample (Fig. 3a), suggesting that charge carrier transfer at the perovskite/doped PC61BM interface was more efficient than that at the perovskite/undoped PC61BM interface, presumably due to the superior film quality of doped PC61BM on the perovskite layer as discussed previously (Fig. 2). Efficient charge transfer was also manifested in a reduction of the PL lifetimes when the PC61BM layer was present. The glass/MAPbI3 sample exhibited a long average lifetime of 11.8 ns, which is comparable to the lifetimes of the MAPbI3 perovskite reported previously. The average lifetime value for the glass/MAPbI3/PC61BM and glass/MAPbI3/doped PC61BM sample was 0.65 and 0.32 ns, respectively (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that the introduction of the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer facilitates efficient charge-carrier transfer at the interface, which can suppress the charge carrier recombination and enhance the charge generation and collection in the devices (as will be discussed later).
The effect of doping on the WF of the Ag electrode was then investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3c, the WF value of the bare Ag electrode was determined to be 4.63 eV, which is very close to the reported values (∼4.70 eV). When the Ag electrode was modified with the doped PC61BM film (10 mol% doping), the WF was effectively reduced to 3.81 eV. The low WF contact at the cathode interface provides a better energy level matching with the electron-accepting PC61BM layer and forms ohmic contact (Fig. 3d), which is preferable for efficient electron extraction as described previously. This effective WF modulation would be beneficial for improving the built-in potential in the device, thus contributing to high open-circuit voltage (Voc), as discussed later. The significant decrease in the WF via CTAB doping can be attributed to the formation of a favorable interfacial dipole created by the strong interaction between the ammonium cations and Ag electrode surface, as several recent studies have demonstrated that the introduction of ammonium cation-based molecules at the cathode interface can induce interfacial dipoles toward the active layer that can significantly elevate the vacuum level of the cathode for efficient electron extraction. It should be noted that the WF of the Ag electrode modified with the CTAB layer (i.e., without PC61BM) was 3.73 eV (Fig. 3c), which was nearly comparable to that of doped PC61BM-modified Ag layer (3.81 eV). These results indicate that the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer is able to turn the air-stable high WF Ag electrode into an efficient low WF electrode.
The device performance with the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer (doping concentration = 10 mol%) was then studied, and a control device with the undoped PC61BM layer was also fabricated for comparison. The device configuration was glass substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PC61BM (with and without CTAB doping)/Ag. The solar-to-electrical PCE was evaluated by recording the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 G conditions (intensity = 100 mW cm−2). The average values and the corresponding standard deviations of photovoltaic parameters including Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table 1. The J–V characteristics of the best performing devices are also depicted in Fig. 4a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. For the control device employing an undoped PC61BM layer (device A), an average PCE of 2.44% was attained, with a Jsc of 15.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.46 V, and a FF of 35.57% (Table 1 and Fig. 4a). The poor device performance obtained for device A is consistent with previous findings that a large energy barrier exists between the LUMO level of PC61BM and the WF of Ag. When using the CTAB-doped PC61BM film as a cathode interfacial layer (device B), a substantial improvement in PCE (by ∼6.2 fold) was demonstrated as a result of the simultaneously increase of all the parameters. As shown in Table 1, device B exhibited an average PCE of 15.19%, with a Jsc of 20.13 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.0 V, and a FF of 75.53%. In particular, the best performing device showed a PCE of 16.11%, with a Jsc of 20.27 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.01 V, and a FF of 78.68% (Table 1 and Fig. 4a). In addition, device B showed a good stabilized power output: a stable value as high as 15.78% was observed (ESI Fig. S2). Note that the measured Jsc of device B agreed very well (within 10% error) with the Jsc values integrated from incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 4b and ESI Fig. S3), which confirmed the accuracy of our reported PCE values. Considering that the ZnO nanoparticle (NP) film is commonly employed as a CBL for perovskite solar cells, a device with the ZnO NP CBL was also fabricated for comparison (device C). Encouragingly, the optimized CTAB-doped PC61BM device greatly outperformed the ZnO NPs-based device (maximum PCE: 16.11% vs. 10.23%), as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4a. The inferior PCE of the ZnO NPs-based device can be rationalized by the fact that the ZnO NP film can only partially fill the voids in the underlying PC61BM/perovskite layers and consequently cause shunt leakage pathways and low device performance, as discussed in our previous study, while this issue was absent in the case of the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer, as evidenced by the highly uniform and void-free surface morphology (Fig. 2). In addition, it is generally accepted that the electrical coherence at the organic/inorganic interface is inferior to that at the organic/organic interface, which could be another reason for the lower PCE of ZnO NP CBL-based device. It should be noted that the photovoltaic performance of the device using CTAB as the CBL (device D) was found to be inferior to that of the doped device (Table 1 and Fig. 4a), presumably due to the insufficient CTAB film coverage, as can be seen from the AFM topography image shown in ESI Fig. S4. These results clearly indicate the effectiveness of using the CTAB-doped PC61BM film as the viable cathode interfacial layer in PSCs.

To check the reproducibility of the devices, a histogram of the device performance obtained from 50 samples of device B is summarized in Fig. 4c. Importantly, more than 60% of the integrated devices delivered PCE above 15% with low standard deviation (Table 1 and Fig. 4c), indicating good reproducibility. This could be explained by the superior coverage of the CTAB-doped PC61BM film on the perovskite layer as depicted in Fig. 2. In addition, given that planar heterojunction PSCs have been shown to be prone to hysteresis, J–V characteristics of the device with the doped PC61BM layer (device B) measured under different scan conditions were then analyzed. Encouragingly, we observed that our device exhibited photocurrent hysteresis-free J–V characteristics with different scanning directions and/or voltage sweep rates (Fig. 4d and e), which can be ascribed to effective passivation of trap states in the perovskite afforded by the PC61BM capping layer.
To gain deeper insight into the PCE improvement afforded by the CTAB dopant, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices were investigated. The Rs and Rsh are calculated from the inverse slope of the J–V characteristics under dark conditions close to 0 and 1 V, respectively. As shown in ESI Table S1 and Fig. 4f, compared to the device with the undoped PC61BM layer (device A), the device with the doped PC61BM layer (device B) exhibited lower series resistance and higher shunt resistance (i.e. less charge recombination and leakage current), indicating more effective charge selective contact. This improvement could be attributed to the combined positive effects afforded by the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer, including enhanced electrical conductivity, superior film quality, and good WF tenability of the Ag electrode, as we had discussed previously. These results elucidate that the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer can provide interface modification superior to that of the undoped film, ensuring efficient electron extraction and preventing undesirable electron–hole recombination between the active layer and Ag electrode.
Controlling the thickness of the interfacial layer usually plays an important role in performance optimization of perovskite solar cells. Here, the thickness effects of the undoped PC61BM and CTAB-doped PC61BM (doping concentration = 10 mol%) films on the PCEs of perovskite solar cells were investigated. For the devices with the undoped PC61BM layer, a strong correlation between the device performance and layer thickness was observed. The PCE rapidly declined from 3.03% to 2.11% when the film thickness was increased from the optimal thickness of 60 nm to 80 nm (Table 2 and Fig. 5a). When employing the doped PC61BM film as the cathode interfacial layer, however, the device performance exhibited a much slower decline with respect to the ones with the undoped PC61BM layer (Table 2 and Fig. 5b). Even with a high-thickness of the doped film (∼120 nm), the device still retained a reasonable PCE of 13.18% (Table 2 and Fig. 5b). The diminished thickness-dependent performance property in the case of the doped PC61BM layer could be ascribed to superior electrical conduction capability, as evidenced by the conductivity measurements shown in Fig. 1c. This thickness-insensitive property would be beneficial for mass production techniques, such as blade coating or inkjet printing.

The universality of this CTAB-doped PC61BM layer (doping concentration = 10 mol%) in PSCs was examined with the FAPbI3 perovskite layer, which is potentially superior to conventional MAPbI3 as the light harvester because of the smaller bandgap. The FAPbI3 perovskite was prepared according to the reported procedure. The formation of a high purity FAPbI3 perovskite film was confirmed by high resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, as shown in ESI Fig. S5. The device fabrication procedure was the same as for MAPbI3-based devices, except that the active layer was replaced by FAPbI3 (see Experimental for details). The devices with the undoped PC61BM layer and ZnO NP CBL were also fabricated for comparison. The J–V characteristics of the best performing devices are shown in Fig. 6a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. Very encouragingly, the device with the doped PC61BM layer (device E) delivered a remarkable PCE of 17.11%, which was superior to those of the devices with the ZnO CBL (device F; maximum PCE = 10.45%) and undoped PC61BM (device G; maximum PCE = 2.15%). In addition, a good stabilized power output was also observed for device E, delivering a stable PCE value as high as 16.80% (ESI Fig. S2). Note that the measured Jsc of device E agreed very well (within 10% error) with the Jsc value integrated from IPCE spectra (Fig. 4b and ESI Fig. S3), which confirmed the accuracy of our reported PCE value. It should be emphasized again that all key parameters of the device with the doped PC61BM layer were highly reproducible with low standard deviation (Table 3). These results provide strong evidence of the general utility of the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer in PSCs.

The device performance of PSCs is known to be limited by the active area. Most of the record efficiencies were reported for small active area devices (<1 cm2), and the PCEs are generally considerably lower for larger area devices. To ensure large-area devices with both satisfactory PCE and good reproducibility, the development of appropriate interfacial layers remains highly desirable. Given that the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer significantly improved the interface properties between the active layer and Ag electrode, its applicability in large-area PSCs was examined. The fabrication procedure and device structure were the same as for the small-area device (device E) except that the active area was increased from 0.12 to 1.2 cm2. As shown in Fig. 6b, the best performing device delivered a high PCE of 15.42%, with a Jsc of 20.70 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.03 V, and a FF of 72.34%. It should be noted that 15.42% PCE of the large-area device is among one of the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar active area (1.0–1.2 cm2). These remarkable results can be ascribed to the fact that the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer exerts multiple positive effects on the device characteristics, including superior film quality, good charge selectivity, and reasonable electrical conductivity. Considering that organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials will decompose rapidly in the presence of moisture, the shelf stability of large-area FAPbI3-based devices was also examined by monitoring the evolution of their PCEs as a function of time during storage under ambient conditions (30 °C, ∼60% relative humidity). In our case, no extra package or encapsulation layer was used. Notably, after being exposed to ∼360 h, over 80% of the initial PCE could be retained for these devices (Fig. 6c). This might be associated with superior air stability afforded by the ambient-stable Ag electrode and uniform coverage of CTAB-doped PC61BM layer, as discussed previously. In particular, we found that these devices remained quite stable in ambient atmosphere under continuous light illumination (intensity = 100 mW cm−2): more than 60% of the initial efficiency was retained over 120 h continuous testing (Fig. 6c), demonstrating the good stability of doped devices not only in the ambient environment but also under continuous illumination. These results indicate high compatibility of the CTAB-doped PC61BM layer with large scale processing, enabling the resulting devices to exhibit both high performance and good ambient stability.

A facile and effective method to improve the performance and stability of PSCs is demonstrated by the incorporation of solution-processed CTAB-doped PC61BM as both an ETL and a CBL. With this layer, the device exhibited a remarkable PCE up to 17.11% with high reproducibility (average PCE = 15.60%), greatly outperforming the devices with the undoped PC61BM layer (2.15%) and the state-of-the-art CBL ZnO NPs (10.45%). In addition, the applicability of using this doped layer in a large-area of 1.2 cm2 PSCs is also demonstrated, and a record high PCE of 15.42% is achieved. More significantly, the resulting devices also possess good ambient stability. This work demonstrates a simple and effective strategy that enables significant improvement in performance and stability of large-area PSCs through facile chemical doping. The results also provide valuable insights into the development of solution-processed n-doped cathode interfacial layers in PSCs.

ZnO NPs were synthesized by a solution–precipitation process according to literature procedures. Briefly, zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g) was dissolved in methanol (125 mL) at room temperature. A potassium hydroxide solution (1.48 g in 65 mL methanol) was then added dropwise within 30 min and stirred for 3 h at 65 °C. The cooled-down solution was then decanted and the precipitate was washed twice with ethyl acetate and ethanol. Afterward, ethanol was added to disperse the precipitates and produce ZnO NP solution.


ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultra-sonication for 20 min each and subsequently pretreated by UV-ozone for 60 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer (25 nm) was spin-coated on the ITO surface and then annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. The MAPbI3 perovskite layer (∼250 nm) was prepared following two-step solution deposition, as described in our previous work. Briefly, PbI2 and MAI were dissolved into anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) and anhydrous 2-propanol with concentrations of 450 mg mL−1 for PbI2 and 40 mg mL−1 for MAI, respectively. Both solutions and substrates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min before being used. The PbI2 solution was spun on the preheated substrate (5000 rpm for 40 s) and then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The MAI solution was then spun on top of the dried PbI2 film (6000 rpm for 30 s), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 2 h. The FAPbI3 perovskite layer (∼380 nm) was prepared according to the reported procedure. Briefly, the PbI2 complex solution (1.3 M in anhydrous DMF) was spun on the substrate (3000 rpm for 30 s). The FAI solution (0.465 M in anhydrous 2-propanol) was then spun on top of the dried PbI2 complex film (5000 rpm for 30 s), followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. Afterward, a solution consisting of 20 mg mL−1 PC61BM with different doping ratios of CTAB in anhydrous chloroform was then spin-coated on top of the formed perovskite layers. The optimum thickness of the PC61BM layer for MaPbI3 and FAPbI3 was 60 and 80 nm, respectively. The opaque Ag (150 nm) was then deposited from a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (<10−6 torr). Contributions to the Jsc from regions outside the active area were eliminated using illumination masks with an aperture size of 0.12 cm2 or 1.2 cm2.


The current–voltage characteristics of the as-fabricated solar cells were measured under ambient conditions using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. Unless otherwise stated, the scan rate was set at 0.15 V s−1. An Oriel xenon lamp (450 Watt) with an AM1.5 G filter was used as the solar simulator. A Hamamatsu silicon solar cell (S1133) with a KG5 color filter, which is traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was used as the reference cell. To calibrate the light intensity of the solar simulator, the power of the xenon lamp was adjusted to make the Jsc of the reference cell under simulated sun light as high as it was under the calibration conditions. IPCE spectra were measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination of monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passing through a mono-chromator. The work functions of the electrodes were measured with a ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 Versaprobe II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer employing a mono-chromatic focused Al-Kα X-ray source and hemispherical analyzer. The EPR spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Bruker ELEXSYS E-580 EPR spectrometer. Sample solutions were added to EPR test tubes and then degassed with nitrogen to form films on the tube walls at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Steady-state PL spectra were measured at room temperature by using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4600) with a 150 W Xe lamp as an excitation source at 600 nm. Time-resolved PL decay spectra were recorded by using a time-correlated single-photon counting system (Edinburgh Instruments FL920), and the excitation light pulse was provided using a picosecond diode laser at a wavelength of 450 nm, and the signal was monitored at ∼770 nm. The PL lifetimes of the samples were calculated by fitting the experimental decay transient data to the single-exponential decay model. The surface morphology of the films was studied using the tapping mode AFM from Digital Instrument D3100CL. The electrical conductivities of the thin films were measured by using a four point probe setup with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400).
