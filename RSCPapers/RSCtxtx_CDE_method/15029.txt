A series of benzodithiophene–benzotriazole push–pull copolymers were synthesised and characterised and their performance in bulk heterojunction solar cells devices was assessed. By incorporating strong electron acceptor units, such as benzothiadiazole and pyridylthiadiazole, into the polymer backbone, significant absorption across the entire visible range (300 nm to 750 nm) was observed for the random copolymers. The importance of investigating photophysical as well as bulk material properties of the polymers was demonstrated with a correlation of properties with device performance.

Semiconducting conjugated polymers are an expanding class of materials that have been applied to many areas of organic electronics. Compared with traditional inorganic semiconducting materials, the advantages of conjugated polymers include tunable optoelectronic properties through structural modification as well as solution processability. Many state-of-the-art organic electronic devices, such as organic field effect transistors (OFET) and organic solar cells (OSC), contain conjugated polymers as the active material for operation. While some properties of polymers can be accurately controlled, there remain significant gaps in knowledge that will allow the targeted design of a high performance polymer for a specific application. The greatest challenge is finding correlations between molecular structure and various properties including bulk material properties and device performance.

Benzodithiophene (BDT) has been one of the most popular electron donor building blocks for conjugated polymers in recent years. The benzene core is readily functionalised for modulation of electronic properties as well as solution processability. The BDT unit has been combined with a range of electron acceptor building blocks to achieve high performance materials particularly for solar cell devices. Benzotriazole (BTz) can be considered a weak electron acceptor building block with less acceptor strength than benzothiadiazole and quinoxaline units. As a consequence, the BTz unit is not used as often in polymers for solar cell applications as stronger electron donor–acceptor systems are preferred. However, BTz is easily functionalised through the triazole rings, thus providing an additional handle to tune polymer properties, and organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibiting up to 7% power conversion efficiency have been reported using BTz polymers. Interestingly, the BTz unit has been used recently in electron acceptor polymers. In those studies, the BTz unit was incorporated into alternating copolymers with stronger electron acceptors, benzothiadiazole and benzobisthiadiazole, making BTz the weak electron donor in those polymers. In this study, a series of benzodithiophene–benzotriazole (BDT–BTz) polymers is thoroughly examined with a range of photophysical and structural analytical techniques. The polymer properties were analysed alongside the device performance of the materials.

The BDT–BTz alternating copolymer P1 and statistical copolymers P2–P3 were synthesised by Stille polycondensation of BDT monomer 1 with BTz monomer 2, and with benzothiadiazole 3 and pyridylthiadiazole 4, respectively (Scheme 1). The ratio of monomers 1, 2 and 3 for polymer P2 and 1, 2 and 4 for polymer P3 was 2:1:1. Rapid polymerisation was achieved by microwave heating to 170 °C in a sealed vessel for 1 h and the polymers were end-capped with trimethyl(phenyl)tin and bromobenzene. The polymers were precipitated in methanol and purified by Soxhlet extraction (see experimental for details). The monomer units were obtained using literature synthetic procedures.

All three polymers were isolated in good yields with high molecular weight ranges (Table 1). The polymers were thermally stable up to 310 °C with a melt transition observed for P1 at 120 °C by differential scanning calorimetry analysis (see ESI for experiment data). The UV-vis spectra of the polymers were recorded both in chloroform solution and in thin films on glass (Fig. 1). The wavelength of maximum absorption for polymer P1 was 578 nm with onset of absorption at 600 nm. A significant red shift was observed with incorporation of a benzothiadiazole unit for polymer P2 with absorption onset measured at 700 nm (Table 1). A further red shift in absorption at 750 nm was recorded with polymer P3. These observations correlate with the increasing electron acceptor strength from benzotriazole through benzothiadiazole to pyridylthiadiazole. The broadened absorption for both polymers P2 and P3 is a result of incorporating the weaker electron acceptor BTz with the stronger acceptors benzothiadiazole and pyridylthiadiazole (Fig. 1). There was no significant difference between the absorption profiles of the polymers in chloroform solution and in thin films. This observation suggests that there is significant aggregation of the polymers in solution, particularly for P1.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the polymers were recorded in solution and in the solid state with an excitation wavelength of 550 nm (see ESI). The PL emission maximum for P1 was 615 nm with the emissions of P2 and P3 recorded at 725 nm and 785 nm, respectively (Table 1). The emission intensity for P3 was significantly reduced compared to the other two polymers. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the polymers were determined from electrochemical experiments and the UV-vis absorption onset (Table 1). Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers were recorded in thin films on the working electrode (glassy carbon) with an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode in MeCN (0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluoro-phosphate). The oxidation of the polymer films was observed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and the potentials were referenced against the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple. All three polymer films showed similar oxidation onset potentials from which their HOMO energies can be calculated directly (Table 1). The LUMO energies were obtained by adding the optical gap energy to the HOMO energy levels. These molecular orbital energies indicate the suitability of the polymers as electron donor materials in solar cell devices combined with fullerene acceptors, such as phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PC71BM (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the PL of all three polymers was quenched in 1:1 blend films with PC71BM indicating that there is efficient charge transfer from the polymers to the fullerene acceptor.

The bulk organization of the polymers was investigated by two-dimensional X-ray wide-angle scattering (2DWAXS). For the measurement the samples were thermally extruded at 30 °C as macroscopically oriented fibers and mounted vertical towards the detector. All three compounds show a typical backbone alignment in the extrusion direction as indicated by equatorial small-angle reflections (Fig. 3). These reflections correspond to the chain-to-chain distance of lamella stacks and slightly differ between the homo- and block copolymer: 1.68 nm for P1, 1.77 nm for P2 and 1.80 nm for P3. Although the alkyl density at the backbone of P1 is higher, the chain-to-chain spacing is smaller in comparison with both block copolymers. This can be related to a higher order of P1 and thus tighter packing of the side chains. The improved order of P1 is also evident from stacking reflections in the wide-angle equatorial plane. The stacking distance of 0.39 nm for all three polymers is unchanged, but the corresponding reflections for both copolymers P2 and P3 are weak and broad indicating reduced order in the lamella stacks. The meridional reflections are assigned to correlations along the conjugated backbone. The first reflection is particularly prominent for P1 and corresponds to a distance of 1.25 nm. This distance can be correlated with the length of one polymer repeat unit.

Blend films of the polymers and PC61BM (1:1) were examined using grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis (Fig. S8, see ESI for experimental details). All three polymers show poor order in the blend film as indicated by the appearance of only meridional reflections which are characteristic for the chain-to-chain spacing of edge-on arranged backbones toward the surface. Identical weak organization is observed for films of neat polymers. The lack of π-stacking reflections might be related to disorder of polymer chains within the lamellae structures. Higher order meridional scattering intensities for P1 suggest slightly better organization in comparison with P2 and P3.
The charge carrier transport through the polymers was determined using thin film field-effect transistors (FET). The compounds were deposited by spin-casting from a 12 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution on top of the HMDS surface-modified SiO2 dielectric of the bottom gate bottom contact transistor geometry. Moderate hole mobilities of about 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were measured for all three polymers. Transfer characteristics of the FET devices are shown in Fig. 4. Interestingly, polymer P3 shows ambipolar device behaviour with an electron mobility of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 which can be related to the lowest LUMO level in comparison with the other two polymers Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized that the electrons are mostly trapped as is evident from the output curves (Fig. S9).

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on the three polymers P1–P3 as electron donors, and PC71BM as an electron acceptor were fabricated in an inverted device structure as shown in Fig. 5a. The ratio of donor and acceptor materials was device-optimized at 1:2 with an additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) 3% and the thickness of the photoactive layers was typically around 90 nm (see ESI for device fabrication and characterisation details). The photovoltaic performances are shown in Fig. 5b. Table 2 summarizes the device performance of the various solar cells and the characteristic parameters are given as follows: short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power-conversion efficiency (PCE). The device containing P1 showed good performance with a Voc value of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 8.1 mA cm−2, 55% FF, and 3.45% PCE. The optical absorption spectra and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the BHJ devices are shown in Fig. 6. By comparing the absorption and the EQE of the devices, it is clear that devices containing P2 and P3 showed more red shifted absorption compared with that of P1 but the performance of the P1 device was superior as a result of higher EQE. This data demonstrates the importance of not only light absorption of the materials but also the semiconducting properties and the morphology of the electron donor and acceptor blend films.

The nanoscale morphologies of the active layer films (polymer:PC71BM 1:2) were studied using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 7, nanoscale phase separation are clearly seen in P1:PC71BM, whereas domains with different shapes are observed in P2 and P3 films. The different morphologies of these polymer films suggests that the interactions between the molecules of each polymer may be different which is reflected in the performance of the devices.
Lastly, the charge transport properties of polymer:fullerene blend films were examined using space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis. Hole only BHJ devices were fabricated and their current–voltage profiles were recorded (see ESI for details). Hole mobilities of the polymer:PC71BM 1:2 blends were calculated from these data (Table 2). The hole mobility of P1/PC71BM films was the highest compared with that of P2 and P3. This is in agreement with the higher short circuit current density observed for the solar cell device containing polymer P1. The SCLC mobility measurement can also be correlated with the molecular order observed in both 2DWAXS and GIWAXS for neat polymers and blend films. The higher crystallinity observed for P1 fits well with the greater SCLC hole mobility, larger Jsc and PCE in solar cells.

Three benzodithiophene–benzotriazole (BDT–BTz) copolymers were synthesized and their photophysical, structural and semiconducting properties were investigated. It was found that the incorporation of electron poor monomer units, benzothiadiazole and pyridylthiadiazole, broadened the UV-vis absorption range of copolymers P2 and P3, respectively, compared to the BDT–BTz polymer P1. In particular, P3 has significant absorption ranging from 300 nm to 750 nm making it a black polymeric material. However, the random incorporation of electron poor units to the polymer backbone of P2 and P3 had adverse effects on the bulk molecular order and semiconducting properties of these polymers. Alternating copolymer P1 showed the highest degree of ordered structures in 2DWAXS and GIWAXS experiments and the best charge transport properties in both FET devices and SCLC hole mobility measurements for blend films. The influence of these bulk polymer properties was clearly demonstrated in solar cell devices. Devices containing P1 had the best short circuit current density, fill factor and power conversion efficiency despite its smaller spectral coverage compared to P2 and P3. This study clearly demonstrates that careful consideration on all material properties must be taken when designing conjugated polymers for solar cell applications.

Benzodithiophene monomer 1 (400 mg, 0.52 mmol), benzotriazole monomer 2 (267 mg, 0.52 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium(0) (12 mg, 2 mol%) were sealed in a microwave vial with a magnetic stirrer bar under nitrogen. Degassed anhydrous xylene (2 mL) was added and the sample was placed in the microwave reactor. The reactor was heated at 120 °C for 5 min, 140 °C for 5 min and 170 °C for 60 min. Endcapping of the polymer was achieved by first adding trimethyl(phenyl)tin (20 mg) and heating at 170 °C for 10 min followed by addition of bromobenzene (0.1 mL) and further heating at 170 °C for 10 min. The polymeric product was precipitated in methanol and purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, isopropanol, acetone, petroleum spirits (40–60 °C) and chloroform. The chloroform extract gave a red amorphous solid (300 mg, 72% yield) on precipitation from methanol.
