Thiophene is widely used in organic photovoltaics due to its excellent charge transport properties, simple synthesis, and high stability. In this paper, two simple oligothiophenes, namely, DC5T and 2FDC5T with rhodanine-flanked structures were synthesized and used as donors in nonfullerene small-molecule organic solar cells (NSM-OSCs). Compared to DC5T, 2FDC5T with fluorine atoms substituted on the conjugated backbone exhibited a downshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and blue-shifted light absorption. With IDIC-4F as a small-molecule acceptor, the 2FDC5T-based device exhibited much higher short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage than the DC5T-based device. As a result, a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.02% was achieved for the 2FDC5T/IDIC-4F device, which was 28% higher than that of the DC5T/IDIC-4F device (PCE = 7.03%). Further research indicated that fluorination on the oligothiophene donor assisted the optimization of the active layer morphology and the reduction in the trap-assisted recombination in the device, which could deeply explain the improvement in efficiency.

Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as promising solar energy conversion devices with several advantages, including light weight, flexibility, low cost, and solution processing. The BHJ active layer of OSCs is composed of a p-type electron donor and an n-type electron acceptor. Over the past two decades, n-type electron acceptors, such as fullerene derivatives (e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)), have greatly contributed to the development of the OSC technology. Nevertheless, fullerene derivatives, as electron acceptors, have some limitations, i.e., poor light absorption, untunable energy levels, and morphological instability. Therefore, new types of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been developed; among them, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with low bandgaps and near-infrared (NIR) absorption are the most widely used. Benefiting from the development of FREAs, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16% have been achieved for single-junction solar devices with polymers as electron donors.

Compared with polymer donors, organic small-molecule donors seem to be more promising owing to their advantages, such as easy purification, well-defined molecular structures, and small batch-to-batch variations. Unfortunately, the PCE enhancement of all small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) lags behind polymer organic solar cells. Therefore, efficiency improvement and cost reduction of ASM-OSCs through the design and synthesis of novel simple small donors with high performances are necessary. Thiophene is widely used for the design of small molecule donors due to its excellent charge transport properties, simple synthesis, and high stability. According to the previous reports from the Chen group, simple oligothiophene derivatives with appropriate alkyl side chains and terminal groups exhibit excellent performance in fullerene-based OSCs. However, PCEs are significantly lower in NFA-based OSCs due to poor interpenetrating networks, unbalanced charge transportation ability, and mismatched absorption spectra of donors and acceptors. To overcome these shortcomings, fluorination, as a promising molecule design strategy, is used to tune the molecular energy levels, bandgaps, and intermolecular non-covalent interactions, which give a chance to achieve complementary light absorption, improve phase separation morphology, reduce charge carrier recombination, and finally afford high VOC and JSC simultaneously.
Considering the fluorination effects that are promising to enhance the PCEs of OSCs, here, we designed and synthesized two analogous molecules (DC5T and 2FDC5T) with the same rhodanine-flanked pentathiophene structures but without fluorine atoms (DC5T) and with two fluorine atoms (2FDC5T) in the conjugated backbone. Compared to that observed for the non-fluorine donor, the absorption onset of the fluorinated donor film slightly blue-shifted and had a deeper HOMO. NFA-based OSCs were fabricated with the high-crystallinity acceptorIDIC-4F. A promising PCE of 9.02% was achieved for the devices with 2FDC5T, corresponding to 28% enhancement compared to that for the non-fluorinated device with DC5T under the same conditions. Additionally, both donors were synthesized with high yields in only a few steps, demonstrating that 2FDC5T is a promising candidate for the production of OSCs.

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the SM donors and NFA. The synthesis of the donors from the substrate 3,4-dibromothiophene involved only seven steps; in each step, the yield was over 80% (details in the ESI). Fig. 1b displays the absorbance spectra of the thin films of SM donors and IDIC-4F. The normalized solution and blend-film UV-vis absorbance spectra are provided in Fig. S1. The DC5T film presents a broad absorption spectrum from 450 to 700 nm with a maximum at 590 nm. When fluorine was introduced in the thiophene moiety 2FDC5T, the absorption of the film blue-shifted: 430 to 690 nm with the maxima at 575 nm. The absorption edges of the DC5T and 2FDC5T films were observed at 717 and 700 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.73 and 1.77 eV. After combining the donors with IDIC-4F, a typical narrow bandgap material, the blueshift for 2FDC5T led to a wider absorption spectrum than that of IDIC-4F/DC5T. Cyclic voltammetry was performed to determine the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of DC5T and 2FDC5T (Fig. 1c and S2). The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below vacuum) was used for internal calibration. The LUMO levels of DC5T and 2FDC5T were calculated to be −3.45 and −3.57 eV, respectively; the HOMO levels were −5.18 and −5.34 eV, respectively. As expected, both the HOMO and LUMO shifted down with the introduction of fluorine atoms. The HOMO and LUMO of the acceptor IDIC-4F were found to be located at −5.73 and −3.93 eV, respectively. Accordingly, the HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO) between both the donors and IDIC-4F (∼0.55 eV) and their LUMO offset (ΔELUMO, ca. 0.36 eV) were enough to allow charge separations. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. 1d) revealed that the two donors possessed good thermal stability with the decomposition temperatures (Td) of 5% weight loss at 390 °C for both DC5T and 2FDC5T. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S3) indicated that 2FDC5T showed an apparent phase transition at around 204 °C, and DC5T showed an apparent phase transition at around 170 °C and 184 °C, while the cooling scans indicated the propensity of crystallization for both SM donors.
Thin-film BHJ OSCs with the conventional device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate))/active layer/phenyl(2-naphthyl) diphenylphosphine oxide (DPO)/Ag (device area = 0.11 cm2) were fabricated and tested under AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). All the active layer films were cast from chloroform (CF). Processing conditions such as solution concentration, donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio, solvent additive, thermal annealing (TA), and solvent annealing were systematically investigated. The specific steps are provided in the ESI (Tables S2–S9). Table 1 summarizes the figures of merit for both optimized devices based on the small molecule donors (DC5T and 2FDC5T) and the NFA IDIC-4F.

Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of the optimized BHJ devices. As presented in Table 1, the BHJ devices with 2FDC5T yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.02% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.92 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 17.53 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 54.87% at the optimized conditions (Tables S2–S5). On the other hand, the device based on the DC5T:IDIC-4F blend showed a slightly lower PCE of 7.03% with a VOC of 0.86 V and JSC of 11.37 mA cm−2. The F-substituted donor 2FDC5T afforded better photovoltaic performance than DC5T. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the optimized devices. The spectra covered the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. The maximum EQE responses of the devices with DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F were found to be 50.15% and 72.37% at 615 and 600 nm, respectively. The EQE response of the device with 2FDC5T was higher than that of the device with DC5T in the entire range, thereby demonstrating efficient photon-to-electron conversions. The calculated JSC values from the EQE spectra were within 5% error of the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves, thus confirming the validity of the J–V measurements.

Fig. 3a and c show the JSC values of the devices with 2FDC5T and DC5T under the illumination of various light intensities. The relationship between JSC and light intensity (I) follows J ∝ Iα. When the power factor (α) is equal to 1, the charges can be efficiently extracted prior to bimolecular recombination. On the contrary, when α deviates from 1, it indicates that the device suffers from a certain extent of bimolecular recombination at short circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, the α value of both the DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F devices is 1. These results showed that there were negligible bimolecular recombination losses in both devices. To analyze the trap-assisted recombination, VOC was fitted as a function of incident light intensity data plotted in log scales. The fitting follows VOC ∝ (nkT/q)ln(I), where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The parameter n is generally in the range of 1–2. Also, n > 1 indicates the existence of trap-assisted recombination in the devices and n = 1 stands for a trap-free condition. As shown in Fig. 3b and d, the n values acquired from the fitting are 1.45 and 1.86 for the 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F and DC5T:IDIC-4F blends, respectively, suggesting that there is trap-assisted recombination in both the DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F devices. The 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F device showed less traps than the DC5T:IDIC-4F device.
To evaluate the charge transport properties, a hole-transport diode with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag configuration and an electron-transport diode with an ITO/ZnO/Phen-NaDPO/active layer/Phen-NaDPO/Ag configuration were fabricated. The charge carrier mobilities of all the active layers were obtained by fitting the dark current density with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S4). For the devices of the DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F blends, the hole mobilities were fitted to be 2.20 × 10−4 and 1.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; the corresponding values of electron mobilities were 6.05 × 10−4 and 3.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Interestingly, the devices based on the fluorinated donor showed much lower electron mobility than those based on the non-fluorinated counterpart, while the hole mobility slightly decreased. However, overall, the better balanced hole/electron mobility of the 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F blend can be attributed to its better performance.
The surface morphologies of the active layers were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As illustrated in Fig. 4a–d, the optimized films of DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F exhibit a clear phase separation in comparison with the as-cast counterparts (Fig. S5). The root-mean-square (RMS) values of the DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F as-cast blends were 0.99 and 0.87 nm, which increased to 5.79 and 5.57 nm after hot substrate (HS) film-casting and thermal annealing (TA), respectively. The obviously increased RMS values indicated that HS film-casting and TA increased the aggregation of active-layer materials. Therefore, the blend films with increased aggregation domain in the binary optimized blends were beneficial for better interfacial contact and charge collection, thereby improving the photovoltaic performance. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out for the DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F blends. Compared with the as-cast films (Fig. S6), the optimized films have clear bright and dark distributions, indicating better phase separation and increased D–A interfaces in these films (Fig. 5).
To establish the structure–property relationship at a molecular level, the crystalline properties of the pristine (DC5T, 2FDC5T and IDIC-4F) and blend films (DC5T:IDIC-4F and 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F) were investigated using 2D GIWAXS (Fig. 6 and S7). The detailed information extracted from the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) profiles of the 2D GIWAXS images are summarized and compared in Tables 2 and S1. DC5T and 2FDC5T illustrated similar molecular packing behavior and orientations, which were made up of weak face-on and strong edge-on orientations. Comparatively, 2FDC5T showed more inclined (100) diffraction in OPP and stronger (010) peak at q ≈ 1.72 Å−1 in IP direction indicating higher edge-on π–π molecular packing in respect of DC5T (Fig. S7a and b). The pristine IDIC-4F film (Fig. S7c) illustrates a strong (100) peak at 0.39 Å−1 in the IP direction and π−π stacking (010) diffraction peak at 1.78 Å−1 in the OOP direction, confirming the dominance of face-on crystallites. The optimized 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F blend film showed peak diffraction at q ≈ 1.75 Å−1 (dspacing ≈ 3.59 Å) with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 3.89 nm for the OOP direction and q ≈ 0.382 Å−1 (dspacing ≈ 16.43 Å) with a CCL of 9.71 nm for the IP direction (Fig. 6d and Table 2). In contrast, the other optimized DC5T:IDIC-4F blend film exhibited two relatively strong peaks from the π–π stacking (010) diffraction at q ≈ 1.68 Å−1 (dspacing ≈ 3.74 Å) with a CCL of 7.44 nm for the OOP direction and q ≈ 1.82 Å−1 (dspacing ≈ 3.45 Å) with a CCL of 3.82 nm for the OOP direction (Fig. 6c and Table 2), indicating extremely strong crystalline and dominated face-on molecular orientations. We suspect that due to the strong crystallinity feature in the DC5T:IDIC-4F blend film, the surface morphology was too rough, which resulted in poor contact with the top electrode and lower device performance as compared to 2FDC5T:IDIC-4F. Also, it has been already reported that bigger crystals in the photoactive layer are responsible for the trapping of charge carriers and non-geminated recombination, which are seriously affecting the device performances. These results were in good agreement with the morphological images (AFM and TEM images), carrier transport, and photovoltaic properties of the optimized blend films.

In summary, two new analogous oligothiophene electron donors, DC5T and 2FDC5T, were synthesized for NFA-based OSCs. As evidenced by AFM, TEM, and GIWAXS, the introduction of two fluorine atoms in the conjugated backbone of the donor molecule (2FDC5T) remarkably affected its electrochemical and aggregation properties, which were in contrast with that observed for the non-fluorinated analogue DC5T. Consequently, 2FDC5T-based OSC devices exhibited enhanced photovoltaic performance with superior phase separation, adequate morphology, and reduced recombination. Finally, a remarkable PCE of 9.02% for the 2FDC5T-based SM-OSCs was achieved when combined with the high-crystallinity NFA IDIC-4F. Such results demonstrate the significance of fluorination on oligothiophene donors for morphology optimization and performance enhancement. Last but not the least, due to its simple synthetic route and high yield, 2FDC5T is also promising for the large-scale production of OSCs.
