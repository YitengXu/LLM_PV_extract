Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, MXenes, typically represented by Ti3C2TX, have shown great promise in optoelectronic devices due to their metallic electrical conductivity, large surface area, superior hydrophilicity and excellent transparency. Herein, to improve the conductivity of polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films, we incorporate solution-processable 2D Ti3C2TX nanosheets into PEDOT:PSS to fabricate PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite layers, and polymer solar cells (PSCs) with PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite films as hole transport layers (HTLs) are fabricated for the first time. The nanostructures and the corresponding hole injection properties of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite layers are systematically evaluated. Based on the non-fullerene PBDB-T:ITIC system, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.02% is obtained for the device with PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX as the HTL, which is improved by 13.5% compared to that of the control device with pure PEDOT:PSS as the HTL (9.72%). When using the PM6:Y6 system as the active layer, the PCE of the device based on PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX is improved to 14.55% from 13.10% for the PEDOT:PSS reference device. 2D Ti3C2TX nanoflakes with higher conductivity construct additional charge transfer pathways between the PEDOT nanocrystals and induce conformational transition of PEDOT from a coil to a linear/expanded-coil structure, leading to an improvement in conductivity and device performance. Interestingly, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX based devices also exhibit enhanced long-term stability compared to PEDOT:PSS based devices. These results show that PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite films have a promising prospect in high efficiency organic optoelectronics.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) that convert absorbed sunlight into electrical energy have been in the spotlight due to their potential in large-scale and cost-effective roll-to-roll fabrication. In the past decade, massive endeavors concerning the development and interfacial engineering of novel light-harvesting materials have been made to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Nowadays, the highest PCE exceeds 16% for single-junction BHJ PSCs. Interface layers, positioned between the photoactive layer and the anode/cathode electrode, play vital roles in governing the performance of PSCs. Interface layers are usually utilized to tailor the work function of the electrode for charge carrier collection maximization, modify the interface to alter the photoactive layer micromorphology, as well as minimize carrier recombination at the interfaces between the active layer and the transport layer. For a hole transport layer (HTL), pivotal parameters consist of high conductivity, high transparency, solution processability, favorable stability, etc. PEDOT:PSS, as the state-of-the-art hole transport material in organic optoelectronic devices, possesses outstanding edges of high transmittance in the visible spectrum and superior film-forming ability and thermal stability. However, PEDOT:PSS solution is strongly acidic and hygroscopic, which can etch the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode. Moreover, it has been verified that the spin-casted PEDOT:PSS thin film often exhibits inhomogeneous morphology and poor electrical conductivity, leading to poor efficiency and stability of devices. The development of a PEDOT:PSS HTL that possesses interconnected conductive domains and enhanced electrical conductivity is crucial to PSCs.

Considerable efforts toward treatment of organic solvents (e.g., ethylene glycol, dimethyl sulphate, dimethyl sulphoxide, mannitol, sorbitol, etc.), surfactants, ionic liquids, zwitterions, and two-dimensional nanosheet materials have been devoted to optimizing the structure and conductivity of PEDOT:PSS thin films, thereby elevating the efficiency of PSCs. For instance, Thomas and co-workers added ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS thin films by altering the crystal morphology and internal nanostructure of conductive polymers. Meanwhile, solvent-induced modifications of crystalline stacking, the aggregation of PEDOT nanocrystals, and the improvement of the surface chain networks by PSS chain rearrangement were explained by a morphological model. Xing et al. exfoliated bulk transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphite in aqueous solution with the assistance of a PEDOT:PSS emulsion, and employed these organic–inorganic composite layers as hole transport layers in PSCs. Such composite thin films provided a remarkable efficiency due to the “island” morphology and benzoid–quinoid transition of PEDOT. Yu et al. used HAuCl4 to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS by inducing phase segregation between PEDOT and PSS and the effect of localized surface plasmon resonance via the generated Au nanoparticles in the PEDOT:PSS layer. Therefore, the microstructure of the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer is key to obtain high conductivity as well as enhance the device performances, as superior crystal morphology and structure will guarantee efficient hole extraction at the interface between the photoactive layer and the HTL.
MXenes, a novel series of 2D early transition metal carbides with the formula Mn+1XnTx, have attracted increasing attention since their first report by Gogotsi's group in 2011. They are synthesized via selectively etching away the A layer (A = Al or Si element, etc.) from Mn+1AXx phases due to the weaker metallic bonds (n = 1, 2, or 3), where M represents an early transition metal, and X is C and/or N. Ti3C2TX (Tx: –O–, –OH and –F), as a typical representative, integrating metal-like electrical property (with an electronic conductivity value of 2.0 × 104 S cm−1), excellent optical transmittance in the visible spectra, high mobility (1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1) and charge carrier density (3.8 × 1022 cm−3), has triggered great attention. Moreover, their versatile surface chemistry endows Ti3C2TX with a great deal of opportunities to tailor their surface characteristics while maintaining the excellent electrical conductivity for widespread applications in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and solar cells. Our recent work demonstrated that a Ti3C2TX HTL effectively facilitated charge transport and collection characteristics of PBDB-T:ITIC based PSCs, providing new insights into the great potential application of Ti3C2TX for high performance and stable PSCs.
Herein, to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films, we proposed the use of 2D Ti3C2TX nanoflakes with higher conductivity as an additive to fabricate novel organic–inorganic composite HTLs for the first time. The microstructures, physicochemical properties of PEDOT:PSS control films and PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composites were investigated in detail. Furthermore, by facilely constructing long-range interconnected transfer channels for holes, its potential application as an HTL in PSCs was evaluated with PBDB-T:ITIC (or PM6:Y6) blends as the active layer. As a result, the PCE of PSCs with a PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite HTL significantly outperforms that of PSCs with a pristine PEDOT:PSS HTL. The promotion mechanisms are based on the following factors: (i) Ti3C2TX nanoflakes construct charge transfer pathways between the PEDOT nanocrystals via forming interfacial electrostatic interactions with insulated PSS chains. The high mobility and charge carrier density of Ti3C2TX nanoflakes permit the charge through the flakes. Therefore, the “dead ends” and discontinuity of the PEDOT nanocrystal clusters are connected by nanoflakes, leading to a 3D interconnected and reticulated structure. Such a reticulated structure is advantageous in elevating the conductivities of composite films; (ii) the electrostatic interaction between PSS and Ti3C2TX nanoflakes (mainly hydrogen bonding interaction deriving from –SO3H of PEDOT:PSS and –OH and –F functional groups of Ti3C2TX) screens the coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS chains. The reduced coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS induces the conformational transition of PEDOT from a coil to a linear/expanded-coil structure. The linear/expanded-coil PEDOT chains have firmer inter-chain interactions, leading to enhanced inter-chain charge transport. As expected, these results show that the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite HTL is endowed with great potential for achieving high performance in PSCs.

The Ti3AlC2 phase (200 mesh; >98 wt% purity) was provided by Beijing Jinhezhi Materials Co., Ltd. Lithium fluoride (LiF) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were obtained from Aladdin. An aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was supplied by H. C. Starck. Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T), PM6, 3,9-bis(2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno-[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), (2,20-((2Z,20Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2,′′30′:4′,50]thieno[20,30:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[20,30:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (Y6), and (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide) (PFN-Br) were purchased from Luminescent Technology, Inc. Chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) were obtained from Kewei Chemistry Co., Ltd. All reagents and solvents were used without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was employed throughout the experiment.


Ti3C2TX nanosheets were prepared by selectively etching the Al atom of the Ti3AlC2 phase with LiF/HCl as reported in the literature. Briefly, 1 g of LiF was dissolved in 20 mL of 6 M HCl aqueous solution in a Teflon beaker with magnetic agitation for 5 min at room temperature. Next, 1 g of Ti3AlC2 powder was carefully added to the mixture to prevent initial excessive heating and then stirred at 35 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the resulting slurry product was washed repeatedly with DI water to remove impurities upon centrifugation until the pH of the suspension became neutral. A clay-like precipitate was collected after decantation of the suspension. To obtain Ti3C2TX nanosheets, DI water was added to the product and sonicated under Ar flow in an ice bath for 1 h. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min to separate any large Ti3C2TX nanosheets.


A PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX emulsion was prepared by dispersing a specific amount of Ti3C2TX solution into PEDOT:PSS solution. The weight of Ti3C2TX nanosheets was determined after thoroughly freeze-drying Ti3C2TX solution for 24 h. To fabricate the BHJ system, a PBDB-T:ITIC blend at a weight ratio of 1:1 was dissolved in a mixture of chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (DIO, 3 vol% volume ratio), and vigorous stirring at 70 °C overnight in a glove box. A PM6:Y6 blend at a weight ratio of 1:1.2 (16 mg mL−1 in total) was dissolved in a mixture of chloroform (CF) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) (CN, 0.5 vol% volume ratio), and the blend solutions were stirred at 50 °C overnight.


ITO substrates (∼10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with detergent, acetone, deionized water, alcohol, and isopropanol under ultrasonic treatment. The dried ITO substrates were subjected to UV/ozone treatment for 10 minutes, and then the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX blend solution was spin-coated on top of ITO glass at 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by 30 min annealing at 120 °C. The obtained composite film was named PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X, where X (X = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 or 0.20) represents the weight percentage of Ti3C2TX to PEDOT:PSS solution. After annealing, all the substrates were transferred into a N2 glove box.

Then photoactive layers were prepared by spin-casting the BHJ solution onto the hole transport layers: the PBDB-T:ITIC active layer was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 60 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. The PM6:Y6 active layer was spin-cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then thermally annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. The thicknesses of the PBDB-T:ITIC and PM6:Y6 active layers were estimated to be 100 nm and 200 nm, respectively, as measured by an alpha-step surface profiler. Subsequently, PFN-Br was spin-cast on the active layer. Finally, Al (100 nm) electrodes were thermally evaporated on the top of the PFN-Br layer in a vacuum <10−6 Torr.

The morphologies of the as-fabricated Ti3C2TX and hole transport layers were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO1530VP) and a transmission electron microscope(TEM, JEM02100F). The oxygen functional groups of Ti3C2TX were probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker VERTEX 70). Surface structure and roughness of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite HTLs were probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (SPM, VEECO) under tapping mode. Chemical compositions of Ti3C2TX and HTLs were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was detected by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA-50 SHIMADZU) under a nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 800 °C at a speed of 10 °C min−1. The conductivities of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite films were measured by a four-point probe conductivity test meter (Keithley 2400 source). Raman spectra of HTLs were performed by a Raman spectrometer (inVia Reflex, inVia-58P056) using a laser source with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was conducted using a Bruker ELEXSYS-II E500 CW-EPR spectrometer. To detect the charge carrier mobility, the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/HTLs/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag were fabricated and characterized by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method using the Mott–Gurney square law from the equations:

where
L is the thickness of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, εr is the dielectric constant of the material, and μh is the hole mobility. The UV-vis transmittance of HTLs was measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (HP 8453) with an integrating sphere. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the PBDB-T films on top of different HTLs was obtained using an automated spectrofluorometer (SPEX 1681). The work functions of HTLs were investigated by a scanning Kelvin probe technique (KP Technology SKP5050) with a 2 mm gold plated tip. The work functions of transport layers were determined by calculating the contact potential difference (CPD) of the Au probe with the Au test sample and the HTL sample. The probe distance was controlled by the software of a Kelvin probe system in the whole experiment.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were obtained in the air using a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5 G solar spectrum irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Normalized PCE-time analyses of devices were tested on the same instrumental setup. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a commercial EQE test instrument (Enlitech, QE-R).

Ti3C2TX is produced by selectively etching away the Al layer of the layered Ti3AlC2 MAX phase in lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid mixture solution due to the weaker Ti–Al metallic bonds. When the etched Ti3C2TX is immersed into DI water in the presence of sonication, delaminated Ti3C2TX is prepared. The TEM image (Fig. S2, ESI) and the AFM image (Fig. 1a) show that after sonication-assisted exfoliation, Ti3AlC2 is delaminated into single- or few-layered flakes with a thickness of 1.5 nm, which is different from the compact Ti3AlC2 (Fig. S1, ESI). The HRTEM image and SAED pattern presented in Fig. 1b indicate the high crystallinity and hexagonal symmetry structure of Ti3C2TX, matching well with those found in previous reports. Fig. S3 (ESI) presents a large scale SEM image of Ti3C2TX, which displays a relatively uniform lateral size of ∼150 nm. Furthermore, the nanoflakes are well dispersed in water and display the Tyndall scattering effect (Fig. S4, ESI).

The chemical composition analysis of Ti3C2TX is characterized by XPS (Fig. 1c). The existence of O 1s (21.7%) and F 1s (3.8%) signals manifests that Ti3C2TX surfaces are equably terminated by –O–, –OH, and –F functional groups, in accordance with previous literature. The FTIR spectrum of Ti3C2TX in Fig. S5 (ESI) exhibits two obvious bands at 1641 and 3448 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibrations of CO and –OH, respectively. Moreover, the thermal stability of Ti3C2TX is characterized by TGA with N2 as the purge gas. Ti3C2TX displays two-stage weight loss: the evaporation of adsorbed water (25–150 °C) and the degradation of terminated functional groups (150–750 °C), which indicates that Ti3C2TX possesses superior thermal stability (Fig. 1d).

Ti3C2TX nanosheets are then integrated into the PEDOT:PSS matrix for fabricating composite HTLs: PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X. The dispersion of Ti3C2TX and the micromorphologies of the fabricated composite films are characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the PEDOT:PSS thin film has a dense and smooth surface. By comparison, the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 film has a relatively rougher surface, and Ti3C2TX nanosheets are fully covered by PEDOT:PSS on the thin film surface. Fig. 2c and d depict the TEM images of Ti3C2TX and the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 composite film, respectively. It can be seen that Ti3C2TX nanosheets are nearly transparent, indicating the formation of extremely thin sheets with a 2D structure. After being added into PEDOT:PSS, nanosheets are fully wrapped with the polymer and the color of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 turns darker. Besides, the core–shell structure with a combo of PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2TX can be clearly observed. PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2TX nanosheets combine well with each other. The electrostatic interaction between the functional groups (–O–, –OH, and –F) of Ti3C2TX nanoflakes and PEDOT:PSS chains should be responsible for such a phenomenon, which ameliorates the interfacial compatibility (the inset of Fig. 2d).

To evaluate the charge transport characteristics of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite films, the conductivities of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X films are obtained by four-point probe measurements and shown in Fig. 3. The PEDOT:PSS film displays a very low conductivity of 2.1 × 10−3 S cm−1, whereas the incorporation of 2D Ti3C2TX nanoflakes significantly improves the conductivities of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X composite layers. Concretely, the conductivities are increased to 0.034, 0.047, 0.061 and 0.068 S cm−1 when incorporating 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.15%, and 0.20% Ti3C2TX, respectively. These results indicate that Ti3C2TX nanoflakes generate a significant promotion effect on the conductivities of composite layers.
To explore the mechanism of conductivity improvement, microstructure modification of composite films upon the incorporation of Ti3C2TX is investigated through typical topographic AFM images and shown in Fig. 4a–e. The bright and dark regions in the topographic image represent the PEDOT nanocrystals and PSS domains, respectively. It can be seen that in pristine PEDOT:PSS, the aggregated PEDOT nanocrystals are enclosed by PSS polymer chains and each bright region shows a relatively separated structure. These isolated and disconnected nanocrystal structures would cause arduous charge hopping between PEDOT nanocrystals and therefore possess inferior conductivity. In contrast, Fig. 4b–e, which are images of films incorporating Ti3C2TX, show relatively homogeneous and interconnected PEDOT nanocrystals on the whole. These PEDOT nanocrystals are more expanded and closely packed as the adding Ti3C2TX amount increases from 0 wt% to 0.15 wt%, and then this phenomenon slightly weakens at 0.20 wt%. Besides, the presence of these enlarged and equably distributed PEDOT nanocrystals means that the number of nanocrystal grain boundaries in a given zone will decrease, which boosts charge transfer among the PEDOT nanocrystals and enhances the conductivity. In addition to the modification of the film microstructure, a slight variation in the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness with the incorporation of Ti3C2TX nanosheets is also detected. The RMS values increase from 0.84 nm for the PEDOT:PSS layer to 1.07, 1.19, 1.35, and 1.54 nm for PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X with weight ratios of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively. The increased RMS values may enlarge the contact area between PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X and the photoactive layer, allowing for shortening the route of hole-extraction and effective hole collection. As shown in Fig. 4f–j, the phase deviations of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X with weight ratios of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 are ±15.0°, ±48.0°, ±55.0°, ±60.0°, and ±64.0°, respectively. The remarkably elevated phase deviations of composite films can be correlated with their hard and solid surfaces. Such a change is helpful to form a sturdy contact with the top photoactive layer and impede material diffusion into the transport layer to decay the device efficiency and long-term stability.
To gain more insight into the mechanisms of conductivity improvement, Raman spectroscopy is conducted to probe the conformational structure change of PEDOT polymer chains induced by Ti3C2TX (Fig. 5a and Fig. S6, ESI). Most of the major peaks for PEDOT arise between 1300 and 1600 cm−1. For the Raman spectra of PEDOT:PSS, the peaks at 1438 and 1443 cm−1 assign to the symmetric stretching of CαCβ and Cα–Cβ, respectively. The peaks observed at 1504 and 1571 cm−1 are related to the middle and the end thiophene rings of the polymer chains, respectively, and the peak at 1367 cm−1 can be assigned to the Cα–Cβ stretching vibration. As shown in Fig. 5a, the peak position variations of the main peak at 1443 cm−1 of PEDOT:PSS shifts to 1438 cm−1 for composite films. This shift can be ascribed to the resonant structure of PEDOT polymer chains, which changes from the benzoid structure to the quinoid structure. The quinoid conformation of PEDOT chains with stronger interchain interactions is conducive to the formation of bigger PEDOT nanocrystals, which is consistent with the observations in AFM images. Thus, the energy barrier of intercluster charge hopping will be lowered, which is favorable for the conductivity enhancement. EPR is tested at room temperature to investigate the Ti3C2TX effect on the charge carriers of PEDOT chains as shown in Fig. 5b. In PEDOT, polaron and bipoloron are the major carrier species and co-contribute to the current transport along the PEDOT. A polaron possesses a spin of 1/2, and therefore, it can be detected by EPR. However, a bipolaron is spinless and cannot be detected due to its integer spin. From Fig. 5b, it can be seen that a strong peak at a magnetic field of 3510 G is clearly observed in PEDOT:PSS due to the existence of abundant polarons, while the peak intensity declines by half with the incorporation of Ti3C2TX (0.15%). This reduction indicates that around half of the polarons in PEDOT chains develop into bipolarons. It is universally acknowledged that a polaron corresponds to a positive charge on the unit, whereas a bipolaron indicates two positive charges delocalized over several units. Therefore, it is apparent that the transformation from polarons to bipolarons derives from the conformational change of PEDOT, inducing the charge that appears more delocalized on the PEDOT chains. The more delocalized charge reinforces the charge transfer of the PEDOT chains and therefore contributes to the conductivity enhancement for composite layers.
XPS is tested to calculate the relative amount of PSS removed from the surface of the composite film (Fig. 5c and Fig. S7, ESI). The spectra depict two S 2p bands and each includes a doublet (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2) with a spin–orbit splitting of 1.2 eV. The S 2p peaks at 164.2 eV and 165.4 eV and at 168.3 eV and 169.5 eV correspond to the sulphur atoms of PEDOT and PSS, respectively. The ratio of S 2p peak areas for PSS and PEDOT, or the relative composition of PSS to PEDOT, decreases upon incorporation of Ti3C2TX. The highest surface composition of PSS/PEDOT is detected for pristine PEDOT:PSS (3.70). The 0.15 wt% addition of Ti3C2TX reduces the PSS/PEDOT ratio to 3.41 due to the reduction of PSS from the film surface, in agreement with the conductivity improvement.
The improved conductivity of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX in relation to the hole transport is further verified by the space charge-limited current. Fig. 5d shows the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/HTLs/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag. The hole mobility (μh) is calculated to be 4.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PEDOT:PSS based device, while μh increases to 7.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon incorporation of Ti3C2TX (0.15 wt%) flakes. The result is due to the interconnected conducting network comprising highly conductive PEDOT crystals and metallic Ti3C2TX of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composites. As expected, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X based devices display a significant increase in FF and Jsc. This confirms the importance of the connectivity of nanocrystals and additional transfer highways in long-range hole transport.
Based on the above observations, we proposed a morphological model of PEDOT:PSS conductivity improvement with the incorporation of Ti3C2TX (Scheme 1). A pristine PEDOT:PSS film with hydrophobic PEDOT chains is surrounded by hydrophilic PSS polymer chains via coulombic interactions like the arrangement of the surfactant in aqueous solution with the hydrophobic region being encircled by the hydrophilic region. PEDOT has a linear structure in the cores of the nanocrystals and the linear PEDOT chains are enclosed by the coil/expanded-coil like chains in the periphery of the PEDOT nanocrystals. On the whole, these PEDOT nanocrystals are insulated by PSS chains, showing the relatively separated structure. The isolated and disconnected PEDOT nanocrystals make the charge transfer among the PEDOT nanocrystals arduous and lead to inferior conductivity.
Upon incorporation of Ti3C2TX flakes, the abundant functional groups (–O–, –OH, and –F) on Ti3C2TX form electrostatic interactions with –SO3H of PSS chains. These electrostatic interactions between PSS and Ti3C2TX flakes screen the coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS chains. The reduced coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS induces the conformational transition of PEDOT from a coil to a linear/expanded-coil structure. The linear/expanded-coil PEDOT chains have stronger interchain interactions compared with the coil conformation, leading to closely packed and expanded PEDOT nanocrystals. Therefore, interchain charge transport will be enhanced. Meanwhile, the high specific surface area of metallic Ti3C2TX crisscross the PSS regions and connect the “dead ends” or discontinuity of the crystal clusters, constructing additional transfer highways (the abundant nanoflakes) for carriers. Therefore, these interconnected conductive networks make it possible to transfer carriers facilely from one PEDOT nanocrystal to another. These collectively contribute to the well-tuned structurally and electrically interconnected transfer networks, where charge carriers can facilely pass through and the significantly facilitated conductivities of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX are obtained. However, when incorporating an excess of Ti3C2TX (0.2 wt%), the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.20 film shows an obvious aggregated morphology by forming hydrogen bonding between Ti3C2TX nanosheets and an increased roughness value. Furthermore, the aggregation of Ti3C2TX may weaken the screening effect between PEDOT and PSS chains and weak phase separation occurs. Therefore, their contribution to charge transfer reduces. In fact, the importance of dispersion of Ti3C2TX or other 2D materials in polymer functional materials has been confirmed in other reports.
The optical properties of transport layers play a critical role in the overall efficiency of PSCs since the sunlight is absorbed by the photoactive layer through the HTL on the ITO electrode. The transmittance values of bare PEDOT:PSS and composite films spin-coated on ITO substrates are obtained and plotted in Fig. 6a. PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X composite films exhibit high transparency in the visible-light area and low transmittance in the UV light area as compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS film, which allows sufficient visible-light to pass through the HTLs and meanwhile absorbs UV light. Thus, the photodegradation of the photoactive layer could be restrained. For example, the transmittance value of PEDOT:PSS is 82.61% at 600 nm. By comparison, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 possesses a high transmittance of 82.99% at the same wavelength. For another film, the transparency is gradually increased with the addition of Ti3C2TX content and PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.20 owns the highest transparency with a transmittance of 84.01%. This phenomenon is due to the particular optical characteristics of Ti3C2TX.
To further elucidate the hole extraction abilities of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composites, steady-state PL spectra of the PBDB-T absorber layer spin-coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X are recorded under 500 nm light excitation. PL quenching derives from hole extraction through the interface of PBDB-T and the transport layer. The PL peak at ∼665 nm is attributed to the emission of PBDB-T. As shown in Fig. 6b, it can be found that PEDOT:PSS possesses a strong PL spectrum at 665 nm due to its weak capability of hole collection. By comparison, this PL peak shows a clear reduction upon composite films, indicating that the hole transmission between PBDB-T and the composite film is remarkably improved. This phenomenon is most likely due to the well-tuned interconnected transfer networks of composite films than the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer. Synchronously, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 shows the strongest quenching ability from PBDB-T, which enables the efficient transfer of holes generated in the photoactive layer to the transport layer and inhibits carrier recombination.

To evaluate the hole transport and extraction of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX as an HTL, we apply PBDB-T:ITIC and PM6:Y6 as light-absorbing layers. The PSC devices are fabricated with the conventional configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X/PBDB-T:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X/PM6:Y6/PFN-Br/Al.

The configurations of the PSC devices, chemical structures of PEDOT, PSS, PBDB-T, ITIC, PFN-Br, PM6, and Y6, and the schematic energy level diagram of the materials used in devices are shown in Fig. 7, Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI), respectively, in which the band energies of ITO, PBDB-T, ITIC, PM6, Y6, PFN-Br, and Al layers are well established, while the energy level of Ti3C2TX is obtained by a Kelvin probe.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under illumination and in the dark, external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of PSCs with PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X as HTLs are collected and shown in Fig. 8 and Table 1, respectively. As can be seen, the PEDOT:PSS-based device shows an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 16.17 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 66.76%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.72 ± 0.08%. In comparison, the incorporation of Ti3C2TX facilitates the transfer and collection of holes, yielding enhanced PCE. The PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 based device achieves the highest efficiency of 11.02 ± 0.08% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 17.08 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.93%. The added Ti3C2TX should be responsible for this remarkable increase of PCE.

The nanosheets induce the benzoid–quinoid transition of PEDOT by screening the coulombic attractions between PEDOT and PSS, which boosts charge transfer among the PEDOT nanocrystals. Additionally, the two-dimensional architecture of metallic Ti3C2TX contributes to providing additional transfer highways (the abundant nanoflakes) in PEDOT:PSS which connect the “dead ends” and discontinuity of the crystal clusters induced by insulating PSS. These collectively contribute to well-tuned structurally and electrically interconnected transfer networks. Moreover, the high transparency in the visible-light area, the low transmittance in the UV light area and the increased RMS (i.e., enlarged the contact area between the HTL and the photoactive layer) also contribute to efficient charge carrier transfer and collection. Increasing the Ti3C2TX loading will generate an increasing promotion effect on the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX based device. For instance, the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX based device continuously increases from 10.19 ± 0.13% to 11.02 ± 0.08% as Ti3C2TX loading increases from 0.05% to 0.15%. However, when further elevating the Ti3C2TX content, the PCE promotion effect becomes reversed like many other composite HTLs. This is most likely caused by the aggregation of Ti3C2TX resulting from overloading. For another device, the main photovoltaic enhancement derives from the increased Jsc (16.17 vs. 17.08 mA cm−2) and FF (66.76% vs. 70.93%). The Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectrum are 15.34 mA cm−2 for PEDOT:PSS and 15.89, 16.22, 16.43, and 16.03 mA cm−2, respectively, for PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X (X = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively), which is in good consistency with the J–V curves (Fig. 8c). Fig. 8b shows the dark current–voltage curves of the devices, indicating that PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X based devices possess reduced leakage current and enhanced Rsh values compared to the reference device.
In the above section, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X composite HTLs are employed in PBDB-T:ITIC based devices. It is found that Ti3C2TX can effectively enhance the hole transfer and collection to a large extent. Here, the device performance of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X as the HTL is further evaluated in the PM6:Y6 photoactive layer. Fig. 8d–f show the illuminated and dark J–V characteristics and the EQE curves. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of devices are summarized in Table 1. A similar variation in the PCE of the PSCs based on the PM6:Y6 photoactive layer is detected as the PBDB-T:ITIC blend. The PEDOT:PSS based device depicts a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 24.22 mA cm−2, an FF of 65.16% and a PCE of 13.10 ± 0.10%. In contrast, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX based devices exhibit notably higher performance, and a PCE as high as 14.55 ± 0.09% is obtained for the PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 based device with a Jsc of 25.63 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.83 V, and an FF of 68.40%, which is comparable to those of devices in the literature. The EQE curves in Fig. 8f are in good agreement with the J–V results. The universality of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite layers in the PM6:Y6 system further indicates the contribution of Ti3C2TX to charge transfer for PSCs.

Furthermore, the stability of PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X based PSCs is detected in a N2 glove box at room temperature (see Fig. 9). The PCEs of PEDOT:PSS based devices drop to 69.16% of their initial values after 300 h since the acidic PEDOT:PSS corrodes the ITO substrate. Notably, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-X based PSCs maintain 79.67% of their initial PCE values, demonstrating the excellent long term stability of composite based PSCs. The layered Ti3C2TX should be responsible for such promotion, alleviating the corrosion of PEDOT:PSS toward the ITO substrate and the photoactive layer leads to enhanced long term stability.


In summary, Ti3C2TX nanosheets are utilized to fabricate PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite layers for hole transfer enhancement in binary BHJ PSCs. Herein, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX composite films are incorporated between the photoactive layer and the ITO substrate to enhance the PCE and the long term stability of PSCs. By homogeneously dispersing in the composite HTLs, Ti3C2TX highly strengthens the hole transfer and collection ability of the device based on the following factors: (i) Ti3C2TX nanoflakes construct charge transfer pathways between the PEDOT nanocrystals via forming interfacial electrostatic interactions with insulated PSS chains. (ii) Ti3C2TX enlarges and equably distributes PEDOT nanocrystals by screening the coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS chains. Therefore, the charge transfer among the PEDOT nanocrystals will be boosted. (iii) The high transparency in the visible-light area, the low transmittance in the UV light area and the increased RMS (i.e., enlarged the contact area between the HTL and the photoactive layer) further contribute to efficient charge carrier transfer and collection. As expected, yielding excellent photovoltaic performance, PEDOT:PSS/Ti3C2TX-0.15 HTLs exhibit higher device performance than the PEDOT:PSS control layer with a PCE of 14.45% in PM6:Y6 based PSCs, which is improved by 11.1% compared to the control PSCs (13.10%). Therefore, the composite layer shows great potential for high efficiency organic optoelectronics.
