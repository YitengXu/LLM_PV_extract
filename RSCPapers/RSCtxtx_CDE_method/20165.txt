Highly efficient ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated from two well-compatible small molecular nonfullerene acceptors (INPIC-4F and MeIC1) and one polymer donor, PBDB-T. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the INPIC-4F or MeIC1 based binary PSCs reaches 12.55% and 11.53%. Based on these efficient binary PSCs, a high PCE of 13.73% is achieved in the ternary PSCs with 50 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, resulting from the simultaneously improved short circuit current (JSC) of 21.86 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V and fill factor (FF) of 71.39%. The PCE improvement of the ternary PSCs should be mainly attributed to the simultaneously optimized photon harvesting and film morphology of the ternary active layers. This result may provide more in-depth insight into the material selection criteria for fabricating highly efficient ternary PSCs: (i) the complementary absorption spectra and good compatibility of the used materials; (ii) the complementary photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding two binary PSCs.

The ternary strategy has been widely demonstrated as an efficient method to realize the performance improvement of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Ternary nonfullerene PSCs have attracted much attention due to the rapid progress of various nonfullerene acceptors. Compared to the fullerene derivatives, nonfullerene acceptors possess the advantages of high photon harvesting ability and tunable energy levels, which provide more opportunity for fabricating highly efficient ternary PSCs. In ternary PSCs, the commonly used selection criterion of the third component is a complementary absorption spectrum with the host system to increase the photon harvesting of the active layer. A new selection criterion for obtaining highly efficient ternary PSCs is proposed based on the complementary photovoltaic parameters of the two binary PSCs, besides the complementary absorption spectrum of the used materials.


Rapid development of solution processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been witnessed during the past few years, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has already exceeded 13% based on highly efficient narrow bandgap donors and nonfullerene acceptors. Enhanced photon harvesting and optimized phase separation of the active layers are prerequisites to achieve highly efficient PSCs. The ternary strategy has been demonstrated as an efficient and simple method to realize performance improvement by incorporating a third component into the host donor:acceptor system as an active layer. Most of the ternary PSCs were designed on the basis of complementary absorption spectra among the used materials. In fact, it is inevitable that some charge traps will be formed in ternary active layers due to the different energy levels of the used materials. If the third component acts as a deep trap center in the ternary active layers, the ternary strategy will become invalid. The dynamic processes of exciton dissociation and charge transport should play vital roles in determining the performance of PSCs, in addition to the adequate photon harvesting of the active layers. The compatibility of the used materials determines the phase separation degree and dynamic processes in the active layers, resulting in the markedly different photovoltaic parameters of PSCs. Therefore, the photovoltaic parameters of binary PSCs should be taken into consideration for selecting the third component, in addition to the optical properties of the used materials. The versatile nonfullerene acceptors exhibit a high photon harvesting ability and an easily adjustable energy level, which provide more opportunity to prepare highly efficient ternary PSCs. Meanwhile, nonfullerene acceptors with similar chemical structures may exhibit good compatibility, and different photophysical and photochemical properties due to their slightly tailored functional groups. Well compatible nonfullerene acceptors should be selected to synergistically optimize the photon harvesting and phase separation of the ternary active layers for obtaining highly efficient ternary PSCs.

In this contribution, highly efficient ternary PSCs were fabricated by combining two nonfullerene acceptors (INPIC-4F and MeIC1) and a polymer donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T). The INPIC-4F and MeIC1 based binary PSCs exhibit a rather high PCE of 12.55% or 11.53% with different advantages in terms of the photovoltaic parameters. The short circuit current (JSC) of INPIC-4F based binary PSCs is larger than that of MeIC1 based binary PSCs, and the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (VOC) are exactly the opposite. The advantages in terms of photovoltaic parameters of the two binary PSCs can be inherited into ternary PSCs by adjusting the MeIC1 content. A high PCE of 13.73% was achieved in ternary PSCs with 50 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, resulting in a synchronously optimized JSC of 21.86 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V and a FF of 71.39%. The JSC value of the optimized ternary PSCs approaches 21.86 mA cm−2, which should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting of the ternary active layers. The monotonously increased VOCs of the ternary PSCs can be well explained from the varied alloy states dependence on the MeIC1 content, which can be further confirmed from the calculation results according to density functional theory (DFT). The PBDB-T molecular arrangement and phase separation should be optimized by incorporating appropriate MeIC1 into the active layers, resulting in improved FFs. The complementary photovoltaic parameters of the two binary PSCs should be another criterion for selecting materials to obtain highly efficient ternary PSCs, in addition to their complementary absorption spectra. The universality of the selection criteria can be further demonstrated from the other two kinds of the ternary PSCs with PBDB-T:INPIC-4F:MeIC or PBDB-T:INPIC-4F:IT-M as the active layers. There is great potential to achieve highly efficient ternary PSCs by integrating the advantages of the materials and the two binary PSCs.

The chemical structures of PBDB-T, INPIC-4F and MeIC1 are shown in Fig. 1a. A series of inverted PSCs were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1b. The weight ratio of the donor to acceptor(s) is kept constant as 1:1, and the only difference is the MeIC1 content in the acceptors. The experimental details are described in the ESI. The absorption coefficients of the neat PBDB-T, INPIC-4F and MeIC1 films were measured and are shown in Fig. 1c. The maximum absorption coefficients of PBDB-T and INPIC-4F are 8.3 × 104 cm−1 and 1.08 × 105 cm−1 at around 625 nm and 810 nm, respectively. The third component MeIC1 exhibits the maximum absorption coefficient of 1.05 × 105 cm−1 at around 717 nm, which has obviously a complementary photon harvesting range compared with PBDB-T and INPIC-4F. Meanwhile, the incorporation of MeIC1 can also compensate the relatively weak photon harvesting of PBDB-T in the short wavelength range. The absorption spectra of the blend films with different MeIC1 contents were measured and are shown in Fig. 1d. Although the absorption spectrum of the PBDB-T:INPIC-4F film covers a broad absorption range from 300 nm to 900 nm, there is an apparent concave shape in the spectral range from 670 nm to 730 nm. The concave spectrum can be gradually compensated by the incorporation of MeIC1. It should be highlighted that photon harvesting from 520 nm to 700 nm can be markedly increased along with the increase of the MeIC1 content, which can be well explained from the absorption spectrum of the neat MeIC1 film. Meanwhile, photon harvesting in a long wavelength range is slightly decreased along with the increase of the MeIC1 content. The optimal photon harvesting of ternary blend films should be obtained by adjusting the MeIC1 content, which is a prerequisite for achieving efficient ternary PSCs. In addition to the optimal photon harvesting of the ternary active layers, both the good compatibility of the used materials and the complementary photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding binary PSCs are crucial factors for achieving highly efficient ternary PSCs.


Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs with different MeIC1 contents under one standard sun illumination, and the key photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The INPIC-4F based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 12.55%, with a JSC of 20.81 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.85 V and a FF of 70.93%. The MeIC1 based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 11.53%, with a JSC of 17.53 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.90 V and a FF of 73.11%. The JSC value of the INPIC-4F based PSCs is larger than that of the MeIC1 based PSCs. In contrast, the VOC and FF of the MeIC1 based PSCs are larger than those of the INPIC-4F based PSCs. The complementary photovoltaic parameters of the two binary PSCs may be optimally inherited into one cell for achieving highly efficient ternary PSCs. The PCE of ternary PSCs reaches 13.73% with 50 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, resulting from a simultaneously optimized JSC of 21.86 mA cm−2, FF of 71.39% and VOC of 0.88 V. The optimized ternary PSCs exhibit an average PCE of 13.47% based on 20 cells prepared from different batches, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI). It is highlighted that the PCE of 13.73% is among the highest values for ternary PSCs. To confirm the universality of the new selection criterion, the other two materials MeIC and IT-M were selected as the third component to prepare ternary PSCs with PBDB-T:INPIC-4F:MeIC or PBDB-T:INPIC-4F:IT-M as the active layers. The PCE of the optimized ternary PSCs is improved to 13.40% or 13.05% with MeIC or IT-M as the third component. The normalized absorption spectra of the used materials are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The J–V curves and key photovoltaic parameters of the optimized binary and ternary PSCs are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI), respectively. Here, three kinds of ternary nonfullerene PSCs were successfully fabricated according to the new selection criterion of the third component. All the optimized ternary nonfullerene PSCs exhibit PCEs over 13%, which can further confirm the availability of this new selection criterion.

The JSCs of the ternary PSCs are increased and then decreased along with the increase of the MeIC1 content, which can be well explained from the adjustable photon harvesting of the ternary active layers with different MeIC1 contents. The EQE spectra of PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. It is apparent that the EQE values of the ternary PSCs are markedly increased in the short wavelength range by incorporating MeIC1. Meanwhile, the EQE values of the ternary PSCs are slightly decreased in the long wavelength range when the MeIC1 content is less than 50 wt% in the acceptors. An apparent difference between the EQE spectral shape of the PSCs and the absorption spectral shape of the blend films can be clearly observed. To explain this phenomenon, the absorption spectra of the active layers (without glass/ITO/ZnO layers) in the cells were investigated according to the reflection spectra of the corresponding PSCs and a special cell glass/ITO/ZnO/PMMA (∼120 nm)/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). The 120 nm PMMA layer in the special cell is used to simulate the optical path in real PSCs because PMMA has a negligible photon harvesting in the whole spectral range, and the light absorption of glass/ITO/ZnO layers in real PSCs can be obtained from this special cell. The detailed calculations are shown in the ESI. It is apparent that the absorption spectra of the active layers in cells are markedly different from those of the corresponding blend films, which should be attributed to the interference effect between incident light and reflected light from the Ag electrode. The absorption spectral shape of the active layers in the cells is very similar to the EQE spectral shape of the corresponding PSCs, which can really reflect the contribution of the third component to the photon harvesting of the ternary active layers. The piecewise fitted JSCs of the ternary PSCs were calculated according to the EQE spectra and are shown in Fig. 2c. The calculated JSCs in the spectral range from 300 nm to 700 nm exhibit an apparently increased trend along with the MeIC1 content up to 70 wt% in the acceptors. Meanwhile, the calculated JSCs in the spectral range from 700 nm to 950 nm exhibit a slightly decreased trend for the MeIC1 content less than 50 wt% in the acceptors and a rapidly decreased trend for incorporating more MeIC1. The total calculated JSCs exhibit an increased and then decreased trend along with the incorporation of MeIC1, which agrees well with the tendency of the measured JSC dependence on the MeIC1 content, and the detailed values are listed in Table 1. The increased JSCs should be mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting by incorporating appropriate MeIC1 in the active layers. Meanwhile, the FFs and VOCs of the ternary PSCs show a monotonously increased tendency along with the incorporation of MeIC1. The enhanced FF of the corresponding PSCs can be well supported by the gradually decreased series resistance (RS) and increased shunt resistance (RSH) dependence on the content of MeIC1. The FFs of all the PSCs are larger than 70%, suggesting that the used materials have good compatibility to form efficient charge transport channels in the active layers. The VOCs of the PSCs are gradually increased from 0.85 V to 0.90 V along with the incorporation of MeIC1, as exhibited in Fig. 2d. For the PSCs with the same interfacial layers and electrodes, the VOCs should strongly depend on the energy offsets between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PBDB-T and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the acceptor(s). The HOMO level for hole transport should be kept constant in all PSCs with PBDB-T as the donor. The effective LUMO levels of the mixed acceptors should be monotonously elevated along with the incorporation of MeIC1, which can be confirmed from the relatively large VOC of the MeIC1 based binary PSCs. It is reported that the monotonously varied VOC along with the incorporation of the third component can be well explained by the alloy model. If alloy states can be formed between INPIC-4F and MeIC1, the mixed new quasi frontier orbitals density (Ne) of alloy states strongly depends on the MeIC1 content. The VOCs of the ternary PSCs can be calculated using the following equation:
(1)
where
VOCBinary1, VOCBinary2, and VOCTernary are the VOCs of the corresponding binary PSCs and ternary PSCs, Ne1 and Ne2 are the Ne of acceptor 1 and acceptor 2, f1 and f2 are the weight ratios of acceptor 1 and acceptor 2 in the acceptors. Using DFT quantum calculations, Ne can be obtained by Ne = nl, where n is the molecular number of unit mass, and l is the number of quasi-degenerate LUMOs (<0.1 eV) per molecule. The frontier molecular orbitals and frontier orbital energy diagrams of the used acceptors are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The molecular weight, n, l, and Ne values of the acceptors are listed in Table S3 (ESI). The Ne is 3.3 × 1020 mol g−1 for INPIC-4F or 4.1 × 1020 mol g−1 for MeIC1. According to eqn (1), the calculated VOCs are appropriately 0.86 V, 0.87 V, 0.88 V, and 0.89 V for the ternary PSCs with 10 wt%, 30 wt%, 50 wt%, and 70 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors, which are well consistent with the measured VOCs. To clarify exciton dynamic processes at the INPIC-4F/MeIC1 interface, a series of cells were fabricated with INPIC-4F, INPIC-4F:MeIC1, and MeIC1 as the active layers, respectively. The J–V curves of the cells were measured under one standard sun illumination, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI). The JSC of 0.50 mA cm−2 for INPIC-4F:MeIC1 based cells is in between 0.74 mA cm−2 for INPIC-4F based cells and 0.13 mA cm−2 for MeIC1 based cells, suggesting that exciton dissociation between INPIC-4F and MeIC1 can be negligible. According to the above analysis, the dynamic processes in the ternary PSCs can be schematically depicted in the inset of Fig. 2d. The INPIC-4F and MeIC1 prefer to form alloy states with tunable LUMO levels, resulting in the varied VOCs of the ternary PSC dependence on the MeIC1 content.

To gain more insight into exciton generation, dissociation and charge collection in the active layers, photocurrent density (Jph) dependence on the effective voltage (Veff) of the binary and the optimized ternary PSCs was investigated, as shown in Fig. 3a. The Jph is calculated by JL–JD, where JL and JD represent the current density under one standard sun illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Veff is determined by V0–Vbias, in which V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied voltage. Assuming that all the excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers, the photogenerated charge carriers can be efficiently collected by the individual electrode at a high Veff of 3 V. The saturation current density (Jsat) should be mainly determined by the harvested photons of the active layers. The Jsat can be described as Jsat = qLGmax, in which q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer and Gmax is the maximum exciton generation rate. The Jsat of the optimized ternary PSCs is 22.92 mA cm−2, which is much larger than 22.01 mA cm−2 of the INPIC-4F based binary PSCs and 18.28 mA cm−2 of the MeIC1 based binary PSCs. The optimized ternary PSCs exhibit a highest Gmax of 1.19 × 1028 m−3 s−1 compared with 1.15 × 1028 m−3 s−1 or 0.98 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for INPIC-4F or MeIC1 based binary PSCs. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be evaluated by Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions and the maximum power output conditions, as exhibited in Fig. 3a. The Jph/Jsat of the optimized ternary PSCs is higher than that of the INPIC-4F based binary PSCs and lower than that of the MeIC1 based binary PSCs, suggesting that the incorporation of MeIC1 can simultaneously improve exciton dissociation and charge collection in the active layers. The Jph, Jsat, Gmax, and Jph/Jsat values of the binary and the optimized ternary PSCs are summarized in Table S4 (ESI). The charge recombination in the active layers can be investigated by measuring the J–V curves of the PSCs under different light intensities, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). According to the J–V curves, JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity (Plight) are described in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be expressed as JSC ∝ PSlight. The bimolecular recombination can be negligible in the active layers if the S value is close to 1. The fitted S values are approximately 0.94, 0.95, and 0.97 for the INPIC-4F based binary PSCs, the optimized ternary PSCs, and the MeIC1 based binary PSCs. The incorporation of MeIC1 can slightly suppress bimolecular recombination in the ternary active layers. The VOC of the PSC dependence on Plight can be expressed as VOC ∝ nKT/qln(Plight), in which K is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The slopes of the VOC–Plight curves are 1.08KT/q, 1.07KT/q, and 1.07KT/q for the corresponding PSCs, indicating that trap-assisted recombination should be involved in all the PSCs. Very similar slopes of the VOC–Plight curves indicate that the incorporation of MeIC1 does not generate additional charge traps in the ternary active layers.
To further investigate the effect of the MeIC1 content on the performance of PSCs, the charge mobility of the binary and ternary active layers was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al, respectively. The ln(Jd3/V2)–(V/d)0.5 curves of devices with different MeIC1 contents are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). Charge mobility dependence on the MeIC1 content is shown in Fig. 3d. Hole mobility (μh) in the blend films is increased from 5.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (0 wt% MeIC1) to 7.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (50 wt% MEIC1) and then decreased to 7.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (100 wt% MeIC1), suggesting that the PBDB-T molecular arrangement could be adjusted by incorporating MeIC1. Electron mobility (μe) in the blend films is monotonously increased from 4.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 6.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 along with the MeIC1 content in the acceptors increased from 0 wt% to 100 wt%. It is known that the balance of hole and electron transport is very important for obtaining highly efficient PSCs. The μh/μe is 1.41 for the INPIC-4F based binary device, and the ratio is decreased to 1.35 for the optimized ternary device and then to 1.10 for the MeIC1 based binary device. The more balanced charge transport in the active layers can be obtained along with the incorporation of MeIC1, leading to gradually enhanced FFs in the corresponding PSCs. The μh, μe and μh/μe ratios of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table S5 (ESI). To further investigate the effect of the MeIC1 content on the molecular arrangement of PBDB-T, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was carried out on the neat and blend films.
The out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line cuts of the neat and blend films are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI) and Fig. 4, respectively. The neat INPIC-4F and MeIC1 films exhibit almost indiscernible (100) diffraction peaks, indicating the random molecular arrangement due to the rather weak intermolecular interaction. The neat PBDB-T film exhibits strong (100) diffraction peaks in the OOP and IP directions, suggesting a highly ordered molecular arrangement of PBDB-T. Meanwhile, the neat PBDB-T film also exhibits a (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction, suggesting that the PBDB-T molecules prefer to have face-on orientation for better hole transport along the normal direction of the substrate. Similar GIXD profiles of the neat PBDB-T film and the blend films indicate that the molecular arrangement and crystallinity of PBDB-T can be kept well in the blend films. INPIC-4F and MeIC1 should be well filled into the PBDB-T matrix. In the blend films, (100) diffraction intensity in the IP direction and (010) diffraction intensity in the OOP direction can be simultaneously increased and then decreased along with the incorporation of MeIC1. The more ordered face-on molecular arrangement of PBDB-T can be obtained in the ternary blend films with 50 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors. The face-on orientation of PBDB-T can be well retained in all the ternary blend films and the intensity of the diffraction peaks exhibits a gradual change dependence on the MeIC1 content in the blend films, suggesting the good compatibility among the used materials. It should be highlighted that the diffraction peak of (100) in the OOP direction is shifted toward high diffraction vector (q) values along with the incorporation of MeIC1, indicating that the d-spacing distance of the lamellar structure can be decreased to form more tightly packed lamellar stacking. The (100) diffraction intensity in the OOP direction was also enhanced by incorporating 50 wt% MeIC1 in acceptors, indicating the improved crystallinity degree of PBDB-T in the ternary blend films. The more ordered face-on orientation and improved molecular crystallinity degree of PBDB-T are propitious to hole transport in the ternary blend films. The optimized molecular arrangement of PBDB-T can be further confirmed from the improved FF of the optimized ternary PSCs. To unveil the effect of the MeIC1 content on the morphology of the blend films, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on the blend films, as shown in Fig. 5.
The bright and dark regions in the TEM images are normally assigned as donor-rich and acceptor-rich domains, respectively. The binary blend films exhibit markedly different phase separation degrees according to the corresponding TEM images. The flocculent structure can be observed from the TEM images of the PBDB-T:INPIC-4F blend films. The uniform and nanofibrous structure can be observed from the TEM images of the PBDB-T:MeIC1 blend films. As seen from the TEM images of the ternary blend films, the nanofibrous structure becomes more and more apparent along with the incorporation of MeIC1. The flocculent structure along with the nanofibrous structure can be clearly observed from the TEM images of the ternary blend films with 50 wt% MeIC1 in the acceptors. The numerous nanofibrous structures can be observed from the TEM images of the ternary blend films by incorporating more MeIC1, indicating that the phase separation of the ternary blend films can be finely adjusted along with the incorporation of MeIC1.

A series of efficient PBDB-T based PSCs were fabricated with different acceptors and the PCEs arrive at 11.53% or 12.55% for the binary PSCs with MeIC1 or INPIC-4F as an acceptor, respectively. A PCE of 13.73% is obtained in the optimized ternary PSCs by inheriting the advantages of the two binary PSCs, which is among the highest values for ternary PSCs. The performance improvement of the ternary PSCs should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting, optimized phase separation and PBDB-T molecular arrangement, as well as the more balanced charge transport in the ternary active layers by incorporating 50 wt% MeIC1 into the acceptors. The optical band gap, energy levels, compatibility of the used materials, and photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding binary PSCs should be simultaneously considered as key guidelines for fabricating highly efficient ternary PSCs.
