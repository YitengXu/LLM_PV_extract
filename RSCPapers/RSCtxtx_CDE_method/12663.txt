Extending π-conjugation in the benzodithiophene (BDT) side chains has been proven useful to improve the efficiencies of the BDT-based polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, combined with a symmetry-breaking strategy of a BDT unit, we further designed a new asymmetric 1D–2D (one dimensional–two dimensional) monomer asy-BDTBP with an alkoxyl group as the 1D part and a π-extending alkoxybiphenyl as the 2D substituted group. Medium band-gap donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymer P1 was synthesized with asy-BDTBP and 4,7-di(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) as the donor and acceptor unit, respectively. Encouragingly, P1 blended with PC71BM exhibited an obviously enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the reported symmetric analogue PBDTBP–DTffBT (6.70%). The PCE increased to 8.45% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.838 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.35 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.27%. However, P1 coupled with a classical non-fullerene acceptor ITIC revealed a relatively poor efficiency of 6.35% due to the bad complementarity of absorption spectra. To match the absorption of ITIC, a wide band-gap D–A polymer P2 was further designed with a weak electron-withdrawing group benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) instead of DTffBT as the acceptor unit. As a result, P2 possessed a complementary absorption spectrum with ITIC, and the resulting devices presented an excellent photovoltaic performance. The optimal efficiency boosted to 10.04% with VOC of 0.873 V, JSC of 17.60 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.37%. This work demonstrates the great potential of asymmetric BDTs for high efficient PSCs and the importance of the rational design of polymers for different types of PSCs.

During the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure have made great achievements owing to their low weight, low-cost and easy fabrication of large area devices. Till date, great progress has been made with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 10% in single- and multi-junction devices based on conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives. Different n-type semiconductors have also been explored as acceptor materials in PSCs. Prof. Zhan reported an efficient n-type fused-ring electron acceptor ITIC in 2015, which has drawn much attention in fullerene-free solar cells since then. Very recently, PCEs over 13% were recorded with ITIC as the acceptor material. This new type of fullerene-free acceptors also reveal promising potential in the ternary solar cells, which are similar to the fullerene acceptor systems. It is well-known that the properties of donor/acceptor blends dominantly affect the photovoltaic performances of the PSC devices. As for a special acceptor material, the donor materials would be all-important and should be rationally designed.

Construction of donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers composed of an electron-donating unit (D) and an electron-accepting unit (A) has been proven to be one of the most effective strategies to design PSC donor materials. Among the building blocks of high-performance D–A conjugated polymers, benzodithiophene (BDT) has been widely investigated as one of the most promising electron-donating units. It is commonly accepted that BDT units can be divided into one-dimensional (1D) BDTs with alkyl/alkoxyl substituted groups and two-dimensional (2D) BDTs with aryl-substituted groups. In most cases, the 2D BDTS polymers exhibit better photovoltaic performance for the enhancement of the absorption spectra and the hole mobilities. Also, many 2D substituted groups attached to BDT can affect the optoelectronic properties of the polymers and photovoltaic devices. Extending π-conjugation of the 2D group is one of the useful approaches to improve photovoltaic efficiencies. For example, the PBDTP–DTffBT polymer with alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT and 4,7-di(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.91%. Moreover, our earlier work has shown that the PBDTBP–DTffBT polymer with a π-extended 2D group (alkoxybiphenyl) and DTffBT shows greatly improved PCE up to 6.70% (see Scheme 1). It should be noted that most of the BDT-based polymers, including the polymers mentioned above, have symmetric structures. Our previous work has also demonstrated a new symmetry-breaking strategy to combine the advantages of both 1D and 2D BDT-based polymers. The asymmetric BDT units were constructed by attaching a 1D alkoxyl substituted group and a 2D aryl substituted group to the same BDT core. Alkoxyl chains can improve solubility of the polymers and the degree of polymerization, while the aryl-substituted group is expected to adjust the Frontier energy levels and intermolecular interactions. Recently, we investigated the influence of a naphthalene group linked to different sites via 2D substitutions of asymmetric BDT, and the PBDTβNPFBT polymer blend with PC71BM exhibited an excellent photovoltaic performance with PCE up to 9.80%.
Inspired by our previous work, here, we designed a new asymmetric BDT unit with π-extending alkoxybiphenyl as the 2D substituted group. A medium band-gap D–A polymer P1 was synthesized based on asy-BDTBP and DTffBT as the donor and acceptor units, respectively. Encouragingly, P1 blended with PC71BM exhibited an enhanced performance with an optimal efficiency up to 8.45% compared to that of the reported symmetric analogue PBDTBP–DTffBT (6.70%) with the same acceptor unit (DTffBT) and the side chains. While the performance of P1 blended with a fullerene acceptor is impressive, devices based on P1 and a non-fullerene acceptor ITIC exhibit less satisfactory PCE of 6.35%. The primary reason should be ascribed to the heavily overlapped absorption spectra of P1 and ITIC. To match the absorption of ITIC, a wide band-gap polymer P2 was designed with a weak electron-withdrawing group benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) instead of DTffBT as the acceptor unit. P2 possesses a complementary absorption spectrum with ITIC, which should produce a largely enhanced JSC. As a result, the fullerene-free PSCs based on P2 show excellent photovoltaic performance. The optimal efficiency boosts to 10.04% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.873 V, JSC of 17.60 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.37%, thus ranking it as one of the best in single BHJ polymer solar cells. The molecular conformations, photophysical/electrochemical properties, photoluminescence spectra and BHJ film morphology were systematically investigated to reveal structure–property relationships and provide valuable experiences for the design of new high-performance photovoltaic materials.

The synthetic routes for the new monomer asy-BDTBP and polymers P1 and P2 are shown in Scheme 2, and the detailed synthetic procedures are given in the Experimental section. The alkoxybiphenyl group was introduced to the BDT core as a 2D π-extended conjugated side chain for the new asymmetric monomer asy-BDTBP. The chemical structure of the monomer and the intermediates in the synthesis process were carefully characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The DTffBT–Br and BDD–Br compounds were synthesized according to the previously reported methods. Considering the differences of the thiophene bridges of DTffBT–Br and BDD–Br monomer, P1 and P2 were prepared by Stille polymerization with Pd2(dba)3 and Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, respectively.

The chemical structures of the two polymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. P1 showed an acceptable solubility (∼10 mg mL−1, 40 °C) in warmed tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), whereas P2 could be dissolved in chloroform and the above solvents at room temperature (>20 mg mL−1). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1 and P2, which were estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with tetrahydrofuran (40 °C) as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard, were 56.7 kDa/1.91 and 64.6 kDa/1.06, respectively. The thermal properties of the polymers were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere (see Fig. S1). The decomposition temperatures (Td) with a 5% weight loss for P1 and P2 are calculated to be 341 °C and 333 °C, respectively. The favorable solubility and thermal stability of the two polymers are good enough for their further characterization and applications in PSCs.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the diluted solutions and thin films of the polymers are given in Fig. 1 and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the absorption band at the long wavelength can be assigned to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units, and the other minor absorption bands at about 350–470 nm probably originate from π–π* transitions. As for thin films, the spectra of both polymers exhibit a slight red-shift compared to their spectra in the diluted solutions, which is attributed to the increased inter- and intra-molecular interactions. Moreover, the P2 film showed an unapparent absorption peak at around 410 nm; this should be partly attributed to the slight red-shift of the spectrum compared to that of its counterpart in the solution, which resulted from a partial overlap between the minor peak and the broad ICT absorption band. Also, the decreased π–π* transitions ability probably has another origin. The temperature-dependent absorption spectra were further analyzed to evaluate intermolecular interactions. As shown in Fig. S2, the shoulder peaks (aggregation peaks) of the two solution absorption spectra existed even in hot solvents (70 °C, o-DCB), indicating strong intermolecular interactions that could facilitate charge transport in BHJ films.

Fig. 1b reveals that P1 possesses a slightly expanded absorption range compared with that of its symmetric analogue PBDTBP–DTffBT (see Scheme 1). This could be attributed to the shortened π–π distance and the optimized molecular stacking of the asymmetric polymer backbones by the replacement of one bulky aromatic group to a flexible oxyalkyl chain. This broader absorption region should be beneficial for harvesting more solar photons and enhance JSC. In addition, from the onset of the absorption spectra of the thin films, the optical band-gaps of the P1 and P2 polymers were calculated to be 1.70 eV and 1.82 eV, respectively. The largely different band-gaps may imply that P1 and P2 probably require different acceptor materials for the complementary and broad absorption range. From Fig. 1c, considering the absorption spectra, we can see that the best couples for donor and acceptor materials should be P1/PC71BM and P2/ITIC.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was carried out to investigate the oxidation/reduction potentials and further estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers. The relevant data were collected and are presented in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1b, both P1 and P2 show an obvious oxidation process. The oxidation onset potentials (Eox) of P1 and P2 were determined to be 1.01 V and 1.06 V, respectively. The following equation was used to calculate the HOMO energy level: EHOMO = −e(φox + 4.8 − φ1/2, FeCp2) (eV), where the unit of potential is V (vs. SCE). The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference was found to be 0.40 V vs. SCE. The HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were −5.41 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively. Based on the optical band-gaps, the LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −3.70 eV and −3.64 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. To further study the molecular conformations of two polymers, theoretical calculation was performed by using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The long alkyls were replaced with methyl groups to simplify calculations. As shown in Fig. 2, the dihedral angles between the biphenyl units of the side chains and the BDT backbone are large (>57°) for both dimers of P1 and P2. These highly twisted side groups can improve the solubility of the polymers and help obtain deep HOMO energy levels. Although the side groups are highly twisted, the polymer backbones of P1 and P2 tend to adopt relatively planar backbone geometries with dihedral angles smaller than 25°, which would facilitate charge transport along the polymer backbones. Furthermore, the calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of two polymers exhibit a similar tendency consistent with the results from CV measurements (see Table 1).


The photovoltaic characteristics of P1 and P2 blended with different acceptor materials were carefully investigated. In this work, PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer (polymer:PC71BM or polymer:ITIC)/PFN/Al. The photovoltaic data and corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with different donor/acceptor weight ratios and processing conditions are shown in Fig. S3 and summarized in Table S1. The optimal photovoltaic data are collected and showed in Table 2 and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a. As for the devices with the P1/PC71BM blend without any additives or annealing process under the optimal weight ratio (w/w = 1:1.5), a maximum PCE up to 8.45% is recorded with VOC of 0.838 V, JSC of 14.35 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.27%. By contrast, the best PCE of the analogue PBDTBP–DTffBT-based PSCs is 6.70% with VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 12.72 mA cm−2 and FF = 62.14%. As shown in Fig. 1b, the more expanded absorption range of P1 than that of PBDTBP–DTffBT would be one reason for the increased JSC. Also, the better film-forming property of P1, owing to the long branched oxyalkyl chain attached to the BDT core, could partially help the enhancement of the fill factor. The 1D–2D asymmetric BDT-based polymers greatly help to improve the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. PSCs based on P1 coupled with the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC were also characterized. However, the VOC and FF drop largely, and JSC does not increase significantly. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1c, the absorption spectra of P1 and ITIC are heavily overlapped, which is not beneficial for harvesting solar light as much as required. If the complementary absorption spectra are considered, the wide band-gap polymer P2 would be a better choice for ITIC. Driven by this point, the devices based on P2/ITIC (w/w = 1:0.8) were primarily fabricated and the as-cast device exhibits greatly enhanced efficiency (PCE = 9.16%). Furthermore, the blend of P2/ITIC (w/w = 1:0.8) was annealed at 110 °C and the device exhibited a high efficiency exceeding 9.50% with enhanced fill factor. Based on the results, the devices with different D/A weight ratios were carefully screened (from 1:0.8 to 1:1.2) and the best proportion was confirmed to be 1:1 (D/A, w/w = 1:1). PSCs with the optimal weight ratio exhibited the best PCE of 9.68%. After thermal annealing, the maximum efficiency reached 10.04% with VOC of 0.873 V, JSC of 17.60 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.37%. The high JSC should be mainly attributed to the complementary absorption spectra and the balanced charge transport (μhole: μelectron = 1.24, Table 2 and Fig. S4). Notably, efficiency with P2/ITIC is one of the best values for single BHJ polymer solar cells, indicating the great potential of the asymmetric BDTs for highly efficient PSCs.

The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the polymer solar cells under their corresponding optimal conditions are shown in Fig. 3b. From Fig. 3b, we can see that the photovoltaic device based on P2/ITIC reveals a broad and strong photo-response in the range of 400–750 nm. The EQE value stays above the line of 75% in the range of 550–710 nm, contributing to the high JSC of the PSCs. Moreover, as shown in Table 2, the integrated current densities (JEQESC) from the EQE spectra are consistent with JSC from the J–V measurements, with a small deviation of less than 4%. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were analysed to study the charge transfer behaviour within the blend films. The emission spectra of pure polymer P1, P2 and different blended films are shown in Fig. S5. The efficient charge transfer between the donor and acceptor materials exists because the emissions of pure polymer P1 and P2 are largely quenched when they are blended with acceptor materials.

To further study the photocurrent behaviours of two PSCs under the optimal conditions, we explored the exciton dissociation efficiencies (Pdiss) from the photocurrent density (Jph)–effective voltage (Veff) data.Jph is the difference between the light and dark current densities and Veff is the difference between the applied voltage and the voltage Va (when Jph is zero). Fig. 4a shows the photocurrent density (Jph) plotted with respect to the effective bias (Veff) for two devices. Fig. 4b reveals the value of Pdiss under short-circuit conditions (Va = 0 V), which are related to the electric field (E) and temperature (T). The P1/PC71BM and P2/ITIC devices show similar Pdiss of approximately 94%, indicating that the Pdiss in two devices is equally efficient.

We further performed measurement of the photocurrent generation and the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on incident light power (ILP) to evaluate the charge separation and recombination behaviour in optimal PSCs. For organic semiconductors, JSC typically follows a power-law dependence on ILP, which can be explained by the equation of JSC ∝ ILPS, where S is a power-law scaling exponent and should be close to 1.0 when the bimolecular recombination is weak. As shown in Fig. 4c, the relatively high S values for two PSCs are fitted which reveals that the bimolecular recombination in the optimal devices is negligible and should be a benefit for the improvement of the JSC and FF values. We further measured the ILP dependence of the VOC to obtain insight regarding the degree of the trap-assisted recombination. Fig. 4d depicts the semilogarithmic plot of VOC as a function of ILP. Generally, for free-carrier bimolecular recombination in solar cells, the semilogarithmic plot of VOC as a function of ILP should show a linear relationship with a slope of 1 × kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and q is the elementary charge. In the case of the trap-assisted recombination or Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, the slope would be close to 2 × kT/q. As shown in Fig. 4d, PSC with the P1/PC71BM blend showed a slope of 1.14 × kT/q, suggesting that the device partially suffers from trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions. By contrast, for the P2/ITIC based device, the trap-assisted recombination is greatly suppressed with a slope of 1.06 × kT/q, contributing to its high short-circuit current density.

To explore the detailed nanoscale morphology of the blended films, atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were applied and two blends P1/PC71BM and P2/ITIC were both fabricated under optimal conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, the optimal P1:PC71BM blend film shows clear fibril-like polymer aggregations and phase separation, which is beneficial for exciton diffusion to the donor/acceptor interface and charge transport. For the optimal P2/ITIC blend as shown in Fig. 5b, an increased domain size is observed with RMS of 1.76 nm. The continuous large domains indicate an enhanced aggregation which would be a benefit for the charge transport. Meanwhile, from the TEM images of the P2/ITIC blend (Fig. 5d), we can see that the donor exhibits good miscibility with ITIC, and the smooth surface of the blended film could ensure better contact with the hole/electron transport layers and the electrodes, which is beneficial in improving photovoltaic performance.


This work reported two D–A conjugated polymers P1 and P2 based on a new asymmetric-modified BDT monomer asy-BDTBP. Compared to the symmetric analogue PBDTBP–DTffBT, the asymmetric medium band-gap P1 with PC71BM as an acceptor material exhibited a more expanded absorption region and an enhanced efficiency for PSCs. The maximum PCE of the device free of any additives or annealing process was 8.45% with VOC of 0.838 V, JSC of 14.35 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.27%. The UV-vis absorption of the wide band-gap D–A polymer P2, with a weak electron-withdrawing moiety BDD instead of the strong electron-withdrawing moiety DTffBT, matched well with that of the non-fullerene acceptor material ITIC. As a result, the optimal devices with the P2/ITIC blend exhibited an excellent photovoltaic performance. The best PCE boosted to 10.04% with VOC of 0.873 V, JSC of 17.60 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.37%, making it one of the best ones based on the single BHJ PSCs. The P2- and ITIC-based PSC devices showed high PCE due to the matched UV-vis absorption, suitable energy levels, high EQE response, high exciton dissociation efficiencies (Pdiss) and low carrier bimolecular recombination. This work demonstrates the great potential of asymmetric BDTs for realizing high-performance PSCs and the importance of the rational design of donor polymers for different acceptor materials.


All solvents such as THF and toluene were purchased from Alfa-Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich, some starting chemicals were purchased from J&K and Suna Tech, the catalyst such as Pd2(dba)3 and Pd(PPh3)4 were purchased from TCI. The synthetic routes for the new monomer and polymers are shown in Scheme 2 and the synthesis details are described below.


A mixture of 4′-bromobiphenyl-4-oxhydryl (1) (12.45 g, 50 mmol), 1-bromo-ethylhexyl (12.55 g, 65 mmol), potassium hydroxide (3.69 g, 65 mmol) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 120 mL) was stirred at 100 °C for 24 h. The flask was cooled to room temperature and then 50 mL water was added to dissolve the inorganic salt. The mixture was extracted three times by petroleum ether and the organic phase was dried by anhydrous Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed, the raw product was purified further by silica column chromatography using petroleum ether as an eluent. A white solid was obtained as the product after dried under vacuum (12.65 g, 70% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.53 (s, 2H), 7.47 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.41 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 6.96 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 3.89–3.85 (m, 2H), 1.77–1.71 (m, 1H), 1.54–1.30 (m, 8H), 0.96–0.89 (m, 6H).


Compound 2 (5.42 g, 15 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added dropwise to a mixture of magnesium turnings (1.08 g, 45 mmol) and a grain of I2 in dry THF (10 mL) and maintained under reflux in a nitrogen atmosphere. After the addition, the mixture was refluxed for 3 h and cooled to room temperature as a Grignard reagent was used for the next step. The Grignard reagent was then added dropwise to a solution of 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione (2.2 g, 10 mmol) in toluene (350 mL) in an ice-water bath. Finally, the mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature under nitrogen. Then, the mixture was hydrolyzed by the addition of water, followed by 38% aqueous HCl and then extracted with diethyl ether. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed under vacuum, the residue was purified by silica column chromatography using dichloromethane as an eluent. Finally, compound 3 was obtained as an off-white solid after drying under vacuum (1.84 g, 24%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.58 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 1H), 7.48–7.45 (m, 4H), 7.42 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, 3H), 7.28 (d, J = 5.2 Hz, 1H), 7.10 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 1H), 6.93 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 3.87–3.83 (m, 2H), 3.50 (s, 1H), 1.77–1.69 (m, 1H), 1.50–1.31 (m, 8H), 0.95–0.86 (m, 6H).


Compound 3 (1.84 g, 3.66 mmol) and zinc powder (1.44 mg, 22 mmol) were put into a 100 mL flask under nitrogen. Then NaOH (8.0 g) was dissolved in water (100 mL) and added to the above mixture. The mixture was stirred well and refluxed for 3 h. Then 1-bromo-2-hexyldecane (3.36 g, 11 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) (2 mmol) were added to the flask. After being refluxed overnight, the reactant was poured into cold water and extracted by petroleum ether. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed under vacuum, the raw product was purified further by silica column chromatography using petroleum ether to give compound 4 as an off-white solid (1.78 g, 68%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.72 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 4H), 7.63 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 7.57 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 1H), 7.41–7.38 (m, 2H), 7.35 (d, J = 5.5 Hz, 1H), 7.03 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 4.29 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 2H), 3.93–3.89 (m, 2H), 1.93–1.88 (m, 1H), 1.79–1.74 (m, 1H), 1.72–1.66 (m, 2H), 1.54–1.27 (m, 30H), 0.97–0.87 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 159.23, 140.35, 139.48, 138.06, 137.50, 132.91, 130.03, 129.80, 128.79, 128.07, 126.90, 126.36, 126.19, 123.18, 120.10, 114.90, 76.41, 70.61, 39.44, 39.29, 31.93, 31.60, 31.33, 30.57, 30.10, 29.71, 29.37, 29.12, 27.09–26.86, 25.29, 23.91, 23.09, 22.71, 20.71, 14.13, 11.15.



n-BuLi (4.32 mL, 6.92 mmol, 1.6 M in hexane) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 4 (1.75 g, 2.47 mmol) in dry THF (60 mL) at −78 °C under nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 2 h and then warmed to room temperature for 1.5 h. After being cooled down to −78 °C again, trimethyltin chloride (8.64 mL, 8.64 mmol, 1 M in hexane) was added in one portion. Then the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature under nitrogen. Water was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was extracted by diethyl ether. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was recrystallized by ethanol two times. Compound asy-BDTBP was obtained as a white solid (1.18 g, 46%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.73 (d, J = 1.6 Hz, 4H), 7.65 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.61 (s, 1H), 7.37 (s, 1H), 7.03–7.01 (m, 2H), 4.30 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H), 3.90–3.95 (m, 2H), 1.95–1.88 (m, 1H), 1.80–1.75 (m, 1H), 1.74–1.66 (m, 2H), 1.52–1.27 (m, 30H), 0.97–0.88 (m, 12H), 0.48–0.36 (m, 18H). 13C NMR (151 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 159.10, 146.78, 143.92, 141.47, 140.73, 140.03, 139.29, 138.21, 133.03, 132.71, 131.18, 130.78, 129.90, 128.06, 127.89, 126.88, 124.79, 114.87, 75.94, 70.61, 39.45, 39.29, 31.98, 31.96, 31.44, 30.57, 30.20, 29.85, 29.74, 29.43, 29.13, 27.10, 27.04, 23.91, 23.08, 22.75, 22.72, 14.17, 14.15, 14.12, 11.16, −8.30, −8.39.
