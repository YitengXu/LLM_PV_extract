We fabricated highly efficient planar type CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) mixed halide perovskite solar cells via spray coating with a controlled composition of the solvents. The cells had a power conversion efficiency of 17.8% (forward scan), 18.3% (reverse scan), and 16.08 ± 1.28% (average) for unit cells under 1 Sun conditions. We controlled the ratio of DMF (dimethylformamide), a quickly evaporating solvent, and GBL (γ-butyrolactone), a slowly evaporating solvent, to 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3 (vol:vol). We obtained the largest MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite crystal grains in the 8:2 sample because the inward flux of the spray solution was balanced with the outward flux of the evaporating solvent. Consequently, the moistened underlying polycrystalline perovskite film with small crystal grains re-dissolved and merged into larger crystalline grains by re-crystallization. By controlling the re-dissolution and crystal grain growth of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film via spray coating, we fabricated a sub-module (10 cm × 10 cm, active area = 40 cm2) with 10.5 V open circuit voltage, 84.15 mA short circuit current, 70.16% fill factor, and 15.5% power conversion efficiency under 1 Sun conditions.

Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have received a great deal of attention as promising light harvesting materials for photovoltaic devices due to their high absorption coefficient via a direct bandgap, a long diffusion length of charge carriers through the formation of shallow traps, high open circuit voltage with a small exciton binding energy, low temperature solution processability, and a certified record efficiency of more than 22% under 1 Sun conditions. The perovskite materials have an AMX3 crystal structure (A: a monovalent metal cation or alkyl ammonium; M: a divalent metal such as Pb, Sn, or Ge; and X: a halogen such as I, Br, or I). Pure AMX3 (A: methyl ammonium or formamidinium, M: Pb, X: Br or I) perovskite and mixed halide AMX3−xYx (A: methyl ammonium or formamidinium, M: Pb, X: I, and Y: Br or Cl) perovskite materials have usually been used for solar cells.

In particular, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) mixed halide perovskite solar cells have advantages over pure CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells in terms of the fabrication process because MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells have a 10-fold longer charge carrier diffusion length than pure MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the charge collection efficiency and reproducibility of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells are better than those of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. However, directly obtaining a MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite thin film with a uniform composition is difficult using the conventional process because it is formed by a solid–solid reaction of a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 and the subsequent elimination/sublimation of unreacted MAI and MACl by-products.
Song et al. deposited a MAPbI3−xClx film with a uniform morphology by dissolving MAPbI3−xClx powder collected in the conventional solid–solid reaction, but the composition was not uniform. Heo et al. reported that a MAPbI3−xClx film with a uniform composition could be formed through a liquid phase reaction, and the corresponding devices exhibited reproducible efficiency due to their long charge carrier diffusion length (∼1100 nm).
To find a commercial application for perovskite hybrid solar cells, it is equally important to develop a large area coating process for the formation of uniform perovskite films because the key technology for achieving high efficiency in such cells greatly depends on the formation of uniform perovskite films. Therefore, a readily commercializable spray coating method could help to deposit perovskite films on a large area because it could selectively deposit onto a patterned area by masking, unlike spin-coating and slot-die coating methods. Therefore, we synthesized a MAPbI3−xClx powder with a uniform composition and spray coated the MAPbI3−xClx film with large grains by controlling the ratio of a solvent mixture of DMF (dimethylformamide) and GBL (γ-butyrolactone). By controlling the spray coating conditions, we fabricated an efficient sub-module (100 cm2, active area = 40 cm2) with ∼15.5% power conversion efficiency under 1 Sun conditions (100 mW cm−2).

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the deposition of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film by spray coating. In a typical procedure for the preparation of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder, we mixed a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 powder in a 20 mL vial using a vortex mixer. The powder mixture was reacted with 15 mL isopropanol at 60 °C for 30 min to complete the liquid phase chemical reaction of MAI and PbCl2. Initially, the solution mixture was turbid and gradually changed to a black colour. The black precipitate was recovered from the solution by centrifuging it for 10 min at 3000 rpm. We washed the powder with isopropanol to dissolve the unreacted MAI and MACl by-products. We repeated both the centrifugation and washing processes. Finally, we obtained the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide black powder by drying it in a vacuum oven for 5 h at room temperature. We then prepared a 0.8 M MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite/mixture solvent (DMF:GBL = 10–x:x vol:vol, x = 0–3) solution for the spray coating. We sprayed 10 mL of the 0.8 M MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite/mixture solvent solution onto a TiO2/FTO substrate placed on a hot plate pre-set to 120 °C for 2 min.

Fig. 1b–i are SEM (scanning electron microscopy) surface and cross-sectional images of the MAPbI3−xClx/TiO2/FTO substrate deposited by spraying the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite/DMF and GBL solvent mixture with different volume ratios of 10:0 (Fig. 1b and c), 9:1 (Fig. 1d and e), 8:2 (Fig. 1f and g), and 7:3 (Fig. 1h and i). The surface topology of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film gradually smoothed as the volume ratio of GBL increased from 0 to 2 and roughened again when the volume ratio of GBL rose to 3 due to dewetting of the film caused by incomplete drying. The inset SEM image in each SEM surface image clearly indicates that the size of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite crystal grains also gradually increased with the volume ratio of GBL from 0 to 2 (average diameter of crystal grains = ∼0.7 μm for the 10:0 sample, ∼1.0 μm for the 9:1 sample, and ∼1.5 μm for the 8:2 sample, see Table 1) and decreased again as the volume ratio of GBL rose to 3 (average diameter of crystal grains = ∼0.9 μm), similar to the tendency of surface roughness. The boiling temperature and vapour pressure of DMF and GBL are 154 °C, 0.52 kPa and 204 °C, 0.2 kPa, respectively. Thus, the evaporation rate of the DMF/GBL solvent mixture is gradually retarded as the volume ratio of GBL increases. Accordingly, the crystal growth time is also prolonged as the volume ratio of GBL increases. After one-time spraying of the above perovskite solutions, we checked the drying time, which we defined as the time required for the sprayed film to turn black in colour (Table 1). The drying times of the sprayed films were 1.2 s, 1.4 s, 1.9 s, and 2.3 s for the 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3 DMF:GBL samples, respectively. This clearly confirms that the crystal growth time is prolonged as the volume ratio of GBL increases.

To confirm that we had formed larger MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite crystal grains by controlling the ratio of DMF and GBL, we checked the XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns (Fig. 1j) and calculated the average crystallite size using the Scherrer equation.
(1)
where
t is the average crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray irradiation (0.154 nm), and B is the line width at half maximum (in radians). To calculate the average crystallite size of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film, we used the (110) peak at 2θ ≈ 14.12°. The XRD patterns did not show any impurity peaks, such as PbI2, indicating the formation of a pure perovskite phase. From the magnified XRD patterns of the (110) peak and the Scherrer equation, we obtained the calculated average crystallite size of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite as ∼150 nm for the 10:0 (DMF:GBL) sample, ∼210 nm for the 9:1 sample, ∼290 nm for the 8:2 sample, and ∼180 nm for the 7:3 sample. Thus, we obtained the largest MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite crystal grains via spray coating using an 8:2 (DMF:GBL) solvent mixture under our experimental conditions. Fig. S1 shows the XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis results confirming that the composition of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film is uniform and that the atomic ratio of Cl:I is 3:97. Note that our ability to form a MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film with a uniform composition via spray coating is associated with the fact that we used pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder with a uniform composition.

To understand the crystal grain growth mechanism via the spray coating process, we checked the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film morphology of the 8:2 (DMF:GBL) sample against the spraying time, as shown in Fig. 2. The SEM surface images of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite films taken at different spraying times show that the crystal grains grew continuously as the spraying time increased to 30 s (Fig. 2a), 60 s (Fig. 2b), 90 s (Fig. 2c), and 120 s (Fig. 1f and g). The corresponding average diameters of the crystal grains were ∼100 nm, ∼300 nm, ∼700 nm, and ∼1.5 μm, respectively.
Based on our series of experiments, we propose the mechanism of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite crystal grain growth shown in Fig. 3. Spraying the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solution onto the hot TiO2/FTO substrate generates an inward flux (Fin) of the MAPbI3−xClx solution and an outward flux (Fout) of the solvents, and the ratio of Fin to Fout is controllable via the experimental conditions. When the perovskite solution lands on the hot substrate, the solvents quickly evaporate, and the perovskite begins to precipitate/nucleate/crystallize. Therefore, the solvent concentration profile and crystallization rate profile from the top to the bottom of the perovskite film have a reverse correlation under continuous spraying conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. In the early stage of spray coating, a perovskite film with small crystal grains forms from the quick evaporation of solvents and consequent quick crystallization. By continuously supplying perovskite solution (Fin), the early film is soaked by the freshly deposited perovskite layer, which has a higher solvent concentration. Accordingly, the small early deposited perovskite crystal grains can be grown into larger crystals by re-dissolution/grain merging/re-crystallization, a process repeated under continuous spraying of perovskite solution, as illustrated in Fig. 3b.

Fig. 3c is a schematic illustration of the crystalline grains formed in the perovskite film with respect to the balance between Fin and Fout. When Fin is much smaller than Fout (as in the case of the DMF:GBL = 10:0 sample), the sprayed perovskite solution is quickly crystallized before melting the perovskite film underneath. On the other hand, when Fin is much larger than Fout (as in the case of the DMF:GBL = 7:3 sample), the underlying perovskite film does not fully dry during the spray coating process, and the wet perovskite film is thus dewetted. Practically, the perovskite film formed using the DMF:GBL = 7:3 sample was light yellow in colour after finishing the spray coating, though the colour quickly changed to black during further heat-treatment. Therefore, that perovskite film seems to have smaller crystalline grains than the perovskite film formed by using the DMF:GBL = 8:2 sample and a rougher morphology due to dewetting. On the other hand, when Fin is similar to or slightly higher than Fout, the continuously sprayed perovskite solution can moisten the underlying polycrystalline perovskite layer and re-dissolve and merge the small crystalline grains, thereby growing larger crystalline grains by re-crystallization. The balance of Fin and Fout is controllable by experimental parameters such as solution concentration, solvent mixture, spray flow rate, substrate temperature, and so on.
To check the correlation between the perovskite film morphology and device efficiency, we fabricated normal (n–i–p) structured planar type solar cells composed of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite/PTAA (polytriarylamine)/Au, as shown in Fig. 4a. Upon illumination, the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite generates loosely bonded electron–hole pairs or free charge carriers with a small exciton binding energy, and the generated electrons (holes) are transferred/transported to the TiO2 electron conductor (PTAA hole conductor) through the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer itself in a self-transporting mode. Fig. 4b shows the absorption spectra of the perovskite films and the EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectra of the perovskite solar cells prepared using the various ratios of DMF and GBL in the solvent mixture. Their absorptivity was similar because the thickness of the perovskite film physically depends on the spraying time, whereas their EQE values followed the same tendency as the average size of the perovskite crystal grains. The EQE value is the product of light harvesting efficiency (ηlhe), exciton diffusion efficiency (ηed), charge separation efficiency (ηcs), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc).
All samples had similar ηlhe, so we attribute the improved EQE values with larger crystal grains to improved ηcs or ηcc. Fig. 4c–f show the J–V (current density–voltage) curves of the corresponding MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells. The Jsc (short-circuit current density) values were well matched with the EQE spectra, such that the Jsc values in the DMF:GBL = 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3 samples were 19.1, 20.8, 21.4, and 19.7 mA cm−2, respectively. The power conversion efficiency (η) of each cell was 14.7% (forward scan) and 15.2% (reverse scan) for the 10:0 sample; 16.7% (forward scan) and 17.2% (reverse scan) for the 9:1 sample; 17.8% (forward scan) and 18.3% (reverse scan) for the 8:2 sample; and 15.5% (forward scan) and 15.9% (reverse scan) for the 7:3 sample. The average power conversion efficiencies (ηavg) and deviations of 30 samples were 12.62 ± 1.24% for the 10:0 sample, 14.60 ± 1.40% for the 9:1 sample, 16.08 ± 1.28% for the 8:2 sample, and 13.63 ± 1.25% for the 7:3 sample. We ascribe the improved efficiency to both the improved Jsc and the improved Voc (open circuit voltage). Fig. 4g is the log–log plot of the I–V curves of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells, indicating that all samples have ohmic contact in the low bias voltage region and that the ohmic to trap filled limit transition points (VTFL) are in the order 8:2 sample < 9:1 sample < 7:3 sample < 10:0 sample, although their values are slightly different. The correlation between VTFL and trap density (Nt) is known to be as follows:
(2)
where
e is the elementary charge, d is the thickness of the perovskite layer, ε is the dielectric constant of the perovskite layer, and ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum. The calculated trap densities (Nt) of the 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3 samples were ∼2.81 × 1015 cm−3, ∼2.75 × 1015 cm−3, ∼2.69 × 1015 cm−3, and ∼2.77 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Thus, the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film with larger crystalline grains has a smaller trap density than that with smaller crystalline grains, implying that the crystalline grain boundaries cause the interface traps. Therefore, the 8:2 sample seems to have the highest Voc due to the reduced recombination facilitated by the largest crystalline grains, which is similar to results in previous reports.

Finally, we fabricated a FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/PTAA/Au planar hybrid solar sub-module (10 cm × 10 cm), as shown in Fig. 5. The sub-module, constructed by serially connecting 10 sub-unit cells, exhibited a Voc of 10.5 V, a Isc (short circuit current) of 84.15 mA, a FF (fill factor) of 70.16%, and an η of 15.5% under 1 Sun conditions (100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G). Here, the geometrical fill factor of the sub-module was 40%, so the real active area was 40 cm2.

We fabricated highly efficient planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells via spray coating using a controlled composition of the solvents. By controlling the ratio of DMF to GBL to 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3 (vol:vol), we were able to control the size of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite crystal grains via a re-dissolution and crystal grain growth mechanism. When Fin ≫ Fout (as in the case of our DMF:GBL = 10:0 sample), the sprayed perovskite solution crystallized before it melted the underlying perovskite film, thereby forming small crystal grains. In contrast, when Fin ≪ Fout (as in the case of our DMF:GBL = 7:3 sample), the underlying perovskite film did not fully dry during the spray coating process, so the wet perovskite film was partially dewetted; a further drying process was required and the finally dried film had relatively small crystal grains. Under Fin ≥ Fout (as in the case of our DMF:GBL = 9:1 and 8:2 (optimal) samples), the underlying polycrystalline perovskite film could be moistened and re-dissolved, merging the small crystalline grains into larger crystalline grains by re-crystallization. The power conversion efficiencies (η) of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells with different solvent compositions were 14.7% (forward scan), 15.2% (reverse scan), and 12.62 ± 1.24% (average) for the 10:0 sample; 16.7% (forward scan), 17.2% (reverse scan), and 14.60 ± 1.40% (average) for the 9:1 sample; 17.8% (forward scan), 18.3% (reverse scan), and 16.08 ± 1.28% (average) for the 8:2 sample; and 15.5% (forward scan), 15.9% (reverse scan), and 13.63 ± 1.25% (average) for the 7:3 sample. In addition, the sub-module (10 cm × 10 cm) exhibited a Voc of 10.5 V, a Isc of 84.15 mA, a FF of 70.16%, and an η of 15.5% under 1 Sun conditions.
