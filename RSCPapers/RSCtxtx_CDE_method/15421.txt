A robust photovoltaic (PV) is essential for long-term redox biotransformations in biocatalytic photoelectrochemical (PEC) platforms. Here, we report a single Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell for unbiased photobiocatalytic reduction reactions. The photoanode/CIGS/cathode tandem assembly drives cofactor-dependent biocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light. Our scalable PEC-PV tandem device achieves the longest reaction time of 72 h and the highest ever recorded turnover frequency and total turnover number of the cofactor of 0.236 h−1 and 11.2, respectively, for biocatalytic PEC production of formate through cofactor regeneration. This benchmark performance is attributed to the excellent PEC stability of the CIGS component; the substitution of CIGS with a perovskite solar cell (PSC) results in unstable generation of photocurrent and a lower concentration of formate under high-humidity environments because of the water-induced degradation of PSC. This work demonstrates the propriety of CIGS in robust PEC-PV tandems for artificial photosynthesis.

Solar-powered biocatalysis in photoelectrochemical (PEC) platforms has been promoted as a green route for sustainable solar-to-chemical conversion using water as an electron donor. Mechanistically, a photoelectrode requires light and electricity to transfer photoexcited charge carriers to redox biocatalysts for the production of value-added chemicals. Most precedent biocatalytic PEC studies required an external bias as high as 1.2 V—in addition to light energy—to promote nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor (NADH)-dependent enzymatic reactions at meaningful rates. No ideal single photoelectrode has been discovered that generates a photovoltage larger than the thermodynamic potential for NADH regeneration (1.34 V) the plus the necessary overpotentials.

The integration of a photovoltaic (PV) device into a PEC system can solve the bias issue; the PV provides a supplementary photovoltage for the PEC system to drive these biocatalytic reactions using solar energy as a sole energy source. In this regard, a metal halide perovskite solar cell (PSC) is a promising candidate because of its high efficiency (9 to 21%) and open-circuit voltage (ca. 1 V). However, PSCs have suffered from their intrinsic instability, which is caused by the intricate interplay of many factors (e.g., moisture, light, O2, electrical bias). For example, water molecules dissolve the organic cations of the organometallic perovskite and deteriorate the structure of the PSC. The irradiation with UV or blue light itself leads to PSC's degradation by the photocatalytic effect of mesoporous TiO2; even in the presence of O2, photoexcited PSC produces O2˙− radicals to destroy the organic component of PSC. This poor stability poses a huge hurdle for sustainable photoactivation of redox enzymes, which is challenging in the field of photobiocatalysis; recent PEC cells drove NADH-dependent biocatalytic transformations less than 7 h. Thus, we envision that an all-inorganic photovoltaic, such as copper indium gallium selenide [Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CIGS], is more appropriate to attain two goals (i.e., zero electrical bias and long-lasting photobiocatalytic reaction) because of its excellent photo- and chemical stabilities. In particular, a CIGS solar cell is a commercialized frontrunner in thin-film PV technology because of its photophysical advantages, such as direct bandgap (1.12 eV), high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1), high radiation tolerance, and excellent operating durability.
Here, we report the first example of a single CIGS photovoltaic in a PEC-PV tandem device and its application to unbiased biocatalytic reduction of CO2 using water as an electron donor. As depicted in Scheme 1, the tandem absorber consists of a FeOOH/BiVO4 top cell (photoanode) and a single CIGS bottom cell (PV), which is connected with a mesoporous indium tin oxide (mesoITO) electrode as a cathode. As the top-performing material in H2O oxidation among n-type semiconductors, the BiVO4 photoelectrode is highly stable in aqueous media and functions as an electron extractor from H2O for electron transfer to the mesoITO cathode. The transmitted light through the photoanode activates the CIGS solar cell, which generates a high total photovoltage (∼1.0 V (FeOOH/BiVO4) + ∼0.7 V (CIGS)) to drive bias-free coupling of water oxidation with NADH regeneration (1.34 V). As a counter electrode in the PEC-PV tandem cell, we employed the electrocatalytic mesoITO electrode to reduce a Rh-based electron mediator ([Cp*Rh(bpy)H2O]2+, M) for regiospecific regeneration of 1,4-NADH from NAD+; the mesoITO material exhibits a high electrical conductivity, stability in aqueous environments, and large surface area. Then, formate dehydrogenases from Thiobacillus sp. KNK65MA (TsFDH) receive hydride ions from 1,4-NADH to convert CO2 to formate. The TsFDH biocatalysis driven by our tandem device is sustained for over 72 h and produces 5.6 mM formate, which are the highest ever recorded reaction time and formate concentration, respectively, among the mediated electron transfer-type biocatalysis using a PEC platform.

We synthesized a CIGS solar cell via vacuum-based-co-evaporation process. A current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of a CIGS solar cell is shown in Fig. 1(a). We obtained performance statistics for twenty 0.45 cm2 CIGS devices: a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 35.68 ± 1.20 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.64 ± 0.02 V, a fill factor (FF) of 65 ± 3%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.01 ± 0.77% (Fig. S1). The estimated Jsc correlated well with the integrated photocurrent density obtained from the external quantum efficiency (Fig. S2). As a control group of the solar cell, we prepared an organometallic PSC (active area: 0.45 cm2) to investigate the PV's stability in a long-term redox biocatalysis. The PSC exhibited Jsc of 19.53 ± 1.37 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.11 ± 0.01 V, FF of 56.13 ± 2.16%, and PCE of 11.41 ± 0.92%. A J–V plot of the PSC is shown in Fig. 1(a).

To provide the cathode with electrons extracted from H2O oxidation, we synthesized a nanostructured BiVO4 photoanode through the electrodeposition of BiOI film on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and thermal conversion of BiOI to BiVO4. We optimized the photoanodic current of FeOOH/BiVO4 by modulating the thickness of BiVO4 (Fig. S3–S5; see the detailed explanations in the legend of Fig. S3) and applying a FeOOH ad-layer on the BiVO4 (Fig. 1(b)) because a higher photocurrent is beneficial for enhancing the rate of our target redox reaction in the series connection of the tandem device. We expected that the transmitted light through a FeOOH/BiVO4 photoactivates a CIGS layer because the optical bandgap of the FeOOH/BiVO4 photoelectrode (∼2.5 eV) is larger than that of a single CIGS photovoltaic (∼1.1 eV). When we exposed a single CIGS photovoltaic to the FeOOH/BiVO4-filtered light, the Jsc and Voc decreased to 20 mA cm−2 and 0.63 V, respectively (Fig. 1(a)). It indicates that the FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS tandem structure can drive unbiased H2O oxidation because the dropped Voc is higher than the onset potential of water oxidation driven by FeOOH/BiVO4 (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). Note that the PSC's Jsc and Voc also decreased to 2.01 mA cm−2 and 1.08 V, respectively, under the filtered irradiation (Fig. 1(a)).
We electrically connected the single CIGS photovoltaic and the FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode in series. As a dual-absorber tandem system, this PEC-PV tandem device enables broad light harvesting because the photovoltaic and photoanode absorb photons of different regions of the solar spectrum (Fig. S6). We verified the exertion of CIGS's photovoltage on the FeOOH/BiVO4. According to our linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) analysis, the CIGS solar cell shifted the I–V profile of the FeOOH/BiVO4 cathodically by ca. 0.62 V (Fig. 1(c)), which was similar to the Voc of CIGS (Fig. 1(a)). In addition, the tandem device produced a photocurrent of 1.18 mA without any external bias (Fig. 1(d)). This value is consistent with the estimated operation current (1.20 mA) from the intersection of the I–V curves of the FeOOH/BiVO4 photoelectrode and the CIGS solar cell (Fig. S7). The similarity of actual and estimated photocurrents indicates that the FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode and CIGS solar cell were well connected into a single tandem device without any significant electrical resistance. When we used a perovskite as the photovoltaic component, the FeOOH/BiVO4's I–V curve was cathodically shifted by ca. 1.00 V (Fig. 1(c)), which was comparable with the Voc value of the PSC (Fig. 1(a)). However, shown in transient photocurrent plots (Fig. S8), the photocurrent of FeOOH/BiVO4/perovskite was lower than that of FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS because of the lower photocurrent of the PSC (Fig. 1(a) and S7).
We investigated the PEC stability of FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS device under different relative humidity (RH) environments by conducting controlled potential photoelectrolysis (CPPE) in a two-electrode configuration (counter electrode: stainless steel) at 0 V. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the photocurrent of FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS was steady for 24 h under 40, 60, or 80% RH, indicating the robust stabilities of FeOOH/BiVO4 and CIGS components against humidity. In stark contrast, CPPE demonstrated a detrimental effect of humidity on the photocurrent of the FeOOH/BiVO4/perovskite; the rate of photocurrent decrease was ca. 7 times higher at 60% RH than at 40% RH. In addition, the photocurrent suddenly dropped at 0.3 h under 80% RH (Fig. 1(d)). We attribute the unstable photocurrent generation to the poor stability of a PSC against humidity, which is widely reported in the PV community. Overall, a CIGS photovoltaic is more appropriate for pragmatic realization of solar-powered redox biotransformations.
As a cathode material for NADH regeneration, we synthesized a mesoITO electrode by accumulating ITO nanoparticles (<50 nm in diameter) on an FTO-coated glass and annealing them at 673 K (Fig. 2(a)). The rationale for preparing mesoITO is to enhance the rate of electron transport to M by increasing the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The mesoITO film exhibited the mesostructure of nanoparticulate ITO film with a thickness of 15.4 μm (Fig. 2(b) and S9). In addition, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the mesoITO matched well with that of cubic ITO (JCPDS: #01-083-3350), indicating the contamination-free composition of the electrode (Fig. S10). We verified the large ECSA of the mesoITO electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV). According to the literature, an electrode with a large ECSA exhibits a large integral area of its CV curve due to the high capacitance of the electrode. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the areas surrounded within the J–V curves of the mesoITO electrode were much larger than those of a planar ITO electrode in varying scan rates.
Our analysis using LSV evidenced the capability of the mesoITO cathode to reduce M in a three-electrode configuration: a mesoITO cathode as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and stainless steel as a counter electrode. Note that M converts NAD+ regiospecifically to enzymatically active 1,4-NADH, and the reduction of M requires a milder potential of −0.13 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) than that of NAD+ (ca. −0.54 V vs. RHE, overpotential considered). As displayed in Fig. 2(d), the presence of M in the electrolyte solution increased the cathodic current at around −0.18 V (vs. RHE), which indicates electrochemical reduction of M. The cathodic current further increased with the addition of NAD+, which we ascribe to the sequential transfer of electrons from the mesoITO to NAD+viaM. On the other hand, the mesoITO electrode exhibited a negligible change in the cathodic current after the addition of NAD+ without M (Fig. S11). Furthermore, the mesoITO cathode successfully regenerated NADH according to our analysis using UV-vis spectroscopy. At an applied potential of −0.28 V (vs. RHE), the rate of NADH regeneration by the mesoITO cathode was 101.0 ± 6.1 μM h−1, whereas that by a planar ITO was only 5.2 ± 1.3 μM h−1 in the presence of M and NAD+ (Fig. 2(e)). We attribute the superb performance of mesoITO to the faster reduction of M by mesoITO than planar ITO (Fig. S12). Note that mesoITO and planar ITO electrodes did not generate NADH in the absence of M (Fig. 2(e)).
Having substantiated the H2O oxidation and NADH regeneration driven by FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS and mesoITO, respectively, we assembled a full tandem structure (i.e., FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO) for NADH regeneration using light as the sole energy source. We predicted the unbiased redox reaction by the full tandem device according to the overlaying |I|–V plots of FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS and mesoITO shown in Fig S13. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the exposure of the tandem device to light (λ > 400 nm, P: 100 mW cm−2) drove NADH regeneration. Control experiments in the absence of light, CIGS module, FeOOH cocatalyst, or M resulted in a negligible regeneration of NADH. The PEC performance of NADH regeneration increased with increasing NAD+ concentration (Fig. S14); the NADH regeneration rate of 1.21 mM h−1 was the highest among reports on NADH regeneration in an FDH-coupled PEC platform (Table 1).

Our bias-free NADH regeneration experiments in high-humidity environments manifested a lower performance of FeOOH/BiVO4/perovskite/mesoITO. Under 40 and 60% RH, both CIGS- and PSC-based tandem cells generated NADH from NAD+ (Fig. 3(b)). However, under 80% RH, only the CIGS-based device achieved the formation of NADH. The negligible formation of NADH by the perovskite tandem cell is attributed to the drastic failure of PSC's photoactivity at high RH (Fig. 1(d)); water influx into the organometallic PSC drives the hydrolysis of organic species and the irreversible decomposition of the perovskite material.
On the basis of the widely accepted mechanism of photoelectrochemistry, we ascribe the unbiased NADH regeneration to the photoinduced transfer of electrons from H2O to NAD+ (Fig. 3(c)). Solar-powered excitation of electrons and holes occurs in the dual absorbers (i.e., FeOOH/BiVO4 and CIGS photoelectrodes). The photoexcited holes of CIGS are annihilated through the recombination with the photoexcited electrons of FeOOH/BiVO4. The excited electrons in the conduction band of CIGS possess energy levels more negative than the M's reduction potential, which is the thermodynamic driving force to reduce M and regenerate NADH at the mesoITO cathode. Concurrently, the FeOOH/BiVO4 extracts electrons from H2O oxidation to return the photoanode to its initial state. In terms of quasi-Fermi levels (EF), illumination generates the photovoltages (Vph = |EF,n − EF,h|) through the repopulation of minority carriers in the photoelectrodes. The total Vph of the FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS tandem configuration (∼1.64 V = ∼1.0 V (ref. 25) + 0.64 V) is larger than the thermodynamic voltage for M reduction and H2O oxidation (∼1.34 V), which enables bias-free NADH regeneration.
Building upon the successful results, we applied unbiased NADH regeneration to biocatalytic CO2-to-formate conversion using TsFDH that exhibits a superior specificity constant (kred/KM) for CO2 reduction compared with other FDHs (e.g., FDHs from Ancylobacter aquaticus KNK607M, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Moraxella sp. C-1, Paracoccus sp. 12-A, or Candida boidinii). The full tandem configuration achieved the biocatalytic production of formate only under light irradiation (Fig. S15(a)); the omission of CIGS, FeOOH, or BiVO4 from the full device did not form formate, which we attribute to the imperceptible formation of NADH (Fig. 3(a)). In addition, both photosynthetic components (i.e., M, NAD+, and TsFDH) and CO2 substrate were requisites for biocatalytic formation of formate; mesoITO did not perform direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate (Fig. S15(b)).
We investigated the dependency of the initial rate of the photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction on the concentration of TsFDH and NAD+. The initial reaction rate was saturated with TsFDH concentration at over 10 U ml−1 (Fig. S16(a)), indicating that the biocatalytic reaction step is overall rate-limiting. On the other hand, the initial rate of photobiocatalysis reached a maximum at 0.5 mM NAD+ in varying cofactor concentration (0 to 2 mM) (Fig. S16(b)). The departure from a Michaelis–Menten-type behavior is attributed to the inhibitory effect of NADH on TsFDH at high concentration of the cofactor; in the CIGS-based tandem platform, the regeneration rate of NADH increased with increasing NAD+ concentration (Fig. S14).
We conducted a long-term photobiocatalytic reaction using 0.5 mM NAD+ and 10 U ml−1TsFDH, which were optimized conditions from the experiments on rate-determining factors (Fig. S16). The bias-free CPPE demonstrated the stability of the CIGS-based full tandem device, which accomplished 72 h catalysis with 5.6 mM formate production (Fig. 3(d) and S17); the total turnover frequency (TOFNAD+) and total turnover number (TTNNAD+) of NAD+ were estimated to be 0.236 h−1 and 11.2, respectively. When we replaced the reaction solution at the cathodic site, the photocurrent was recovered in the next cycle (Fig. S18); the formate concentration was almost identical after 12 h reactions in the first and second cycles. Recent advances in protein engineering studies promise that the stability issue may be solved through enzyme immobilization. For example, the cross-linking of precipitated enzymes on polymeric materials (e.g., chitosan nanoparticle and polyaniline nanofiber) substantially enhances enzyme stability over 60 days because multipoint covalent linkages between enzymes suppress their denaturation.
We further verified poor photoenzymatic performance in case of the PSC-based tandem configuration under humid conditions. At 40, 60, and 80% RH, the FeOOH/BiVO4/perovskite/mesoITO achieved 4.3, 3.9, and 0 mM formate, respectively, after 72 h illumination (λ > 400 nm, P: 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 3(e)). In stark contrast, FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO produced 5.6 mM consistently irrespective of RH. These results agree with the bias-free CPPE (Fig. 1(d)); the long-term exposure of PSC to humid atmospheres resulted in a gradual degradation of PSC and a consequent failure of photoelectrocatalytic capability.
Next, we investigated the scalability of the CIGS-based full tandem device (FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO) by making the active areas of all components 4 cm2. The upscaling of the CIGS's active area from 0.45 to 4 cm2 decreased four photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE) (Fig. S19(a) and (b)). This change declined the photocurrent of the 4 cm2 FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS (Fig. S19(a), (c), and (d); see the detailed explanations in the legend of figures). However, because of the quadrupled surface area of the mesoITO, the estimated photocurrent of the FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO became higher for unbiased NADH regeneration (Fig. S20; see the ESI). As a consequence, the NADH regeneration rate and the formate concentration remained constant despite doubling of the reaction volume in the cathodic compartment (Fig. S21); the amount of formate increased to 28 μmol for 72 h unbiased photobiocatalytic reaction (Fig. S21(b)).
The FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO tandem device compares favorably with the cutting-edge formate production biocatalytic PEC systems using cofactor regeneration (Table 1). Three PEC cells consisted of a photoanode (e.g., α-Fe2O3, multi-junction Si) and a (photo)cathode (e.g., BiFeO3, ITO, hydrogen-terminated Si nanowire) to regenerate NADH at an applied bias of at least 1.0 V. The other system regenerated a reduced form of toxic methyl viologen (MV+˙) using a p-type InP photocathode at 0.451 V (vs. RHE). The TOFcofactor and TTNcofactor of the FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO tandem device were the highest even under bias-free conditions. The solar-to-formate (STF) energy conversion efficiency of our system was 0.03%; the efficiencies of other PEC cells cannot be defined because they used an applied electrical bias.
The current CIGS-based tandem device exhibited the benchmark efficiency among biocatalytic PEC systems reported so far. We propose several directions to attain higher photobiocatalytic productivity in the future. As shown in Fig. S13, the mesoITO remained a current-limiting electrode in the tandem configuration. The functionalization of the electrode with graphitic carbon materials (e.g., graphene hydrogel and carbon nanotube film) may improve the rate of M reduction because strong π–π interaction between M's heteroaromatic moiety and the reformed electrode boosts the interfacial charge transfer to M. An increase in the photovoltage of CIGS photovoltaic can also generate a higher operating current. For example, a photovoltage increase of 0.2 V could nearly double the tandem current (Fig. S13). Recent studies have focused on the factors that increase the photovoltage of CIGS (to ∼0.8 V) through Ga gradients in the CIGS layer, Na incorporation in the Mo layer, and the use of a Cd-free window layer with a large bandgap.
The protein engineering of FDH for boosting stability and catalytic activity can further improve the biocatalytic tandem performance. Although the CO2-reducing activity of TsFDH is the highest among various FDHs, its kred/KM for CO2 reduction (eqn (1)) is 3.2-fold lower than that for formate oxidation (eqn (2)).
TsFDH + CO2 + NADH → TsFDH + HCOO− + NAD+

Random mutagenesis or amino acid sequence alignment approaches have been demonstrated to reform the stabilities and catalytic performances of FDHs. In addition to the structural modification of enzymes, the immobilization of FDHs in a porous material can pave the way for the preservation of native enzyme structure and the augmentation of robust enzyme stability under harsh conditions.

We have presented a single CIGS photovoltaic in the PEC-PV tandem configuration for unbiased photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction. We combined a CIGS solar cell with a water-oxidizing FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode and a mesoITO cathode to drive NADH regeneration and enzymatic conversion of CO2 to formate. The synergetic effect of photovoltages generated by both CIGS and FeOOH/BiVO4 enabled the mesoITO electrode to accomplish the cascade of photoexcited electron transfer to TsFDH via the Rh-based electron mediator and NAD+ cofactor. The scalable CIGS-based full tandem device (i.e., FeOOH/BiVO4/CIGS/mesoITO) achieved benchmark performance (formate concentration: 5.6 mM, TOFNAD+: 0.236 h−1, TTNNAD+: 11.2) for biocatalytic PEC systems through cofactor regeneration. The excellent PEC stability of the CIGS photovoltaic conduced to the new benchmark; the replacement of the CIGS by a perovskite photovoltaic resulted in much lower enzymatic productivity under 40, 60, and 80% RH because of the water-driven deterioration of PSC. This work establishes CIGS photovoltaics as an apposite energy material to realize long-term artificial photosynthesis.
