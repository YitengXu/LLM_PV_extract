The growth of a thermally deposited merocyanine (HB364) thin film can be modified through insertion of a transition metal oxide layer between an indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrate and the dye film. Pure or V2O5 modified ITO substrates result in highly crystalline HB364 films where the dye molecules adopt an edge-on orientation. Changing the transition metal oxide layer to WO3 or MoO3 results in a less ordered dye film with a mixed growth of edge-on and face-on orientations. Planar HB364/C60 heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells are fabricated using the different transition metal oxides as the anode buffer layers. The devices with a pure ITO or a V2O5 modified anode demonstrate the highest power conversion efficiencies up to 2.7% that also outperform HB364:C60 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices (2.5%). Finally, HB364/HB364:C60 hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) cells are fabricated showing the highest power conversion efficiency of 2.9%.

Organic photovoltaics (OPV) is a merging concept for a cost efficient and an environmentally friendly energy source. Compared to inorganic counterparts OPV has several advantages such as potentially very low production costs, vast diversity of active materials, and significantly thinner as well as lighter devices.

Two different device architectures, namely, a planar heterojunction (PHJ) and a bulk heterojunction (BHJ), are commonly used in OPV. The PHJ devices comprise separately stacked donor (D) and acceptor (A) layers featuring a distinct heterointerface. In turn, in the BHJ cells, the donor and the acceptor are co-deposited in a common bulk film leading to fine intermixing of the components. The main advantage of the PHJ structure over the BHJ concept is the well defined p- and n-semiconducting layers which enable efficient collection of the photogenerated charges. However, due to the layered structure, the interface area between the D and A components is limited restricting the thickness of the photon absorbing layer to the exciton diffusion length of the absorber compound which is, typically, for organic small molecules 1–20 nm. The exciton diffusion length is not usually considered the limiting factor in BHJ devices, due to the fine intermixing of the donor and acceptor components. However, an inadequate phase separation of D and A molecules results in dead ends for the charge carriers as well as high resistive losses which are common problems in BHJ devices.
A promising approach to improve the photon harvesting efficiency of PHJ devices is to alter the morphology of the light absorbing donor layer. Higher crystallinity is considered advantageous for exciton and charge carrier transport and a way also to improve the absorption coefficient if the molecules are deposited suitably with regard to the direction of the light. Several different methods have been used to realize well ordered film structures in organic solar cells, such as vapor phase deposition, substrate heating, thermal annealing,solvent vapor soaking, and solvent casting. Processing additives as well as block copolymer nanowires have also been used to provide a two-phase nanostructured morphology in OPV. Additionally, templating the ITO surface with a thin organic layer and adding a thin buffer film between the ITO electrode and the successive organic layer have proved to be efficient methods to enhance crystallinity of the donor film above. Other functions of a thin buffer layer are to increase the work function of the anode and, thus, to improve the charge collection from the deep lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor material as well as to shield the successive organic layer from the highly reactive ITO surface. A commonly used organic buffer material is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) copolymer, but due to its acidity, the long term stability of the devices has proved to suffer from this treatment. Alternative buffer materials to the PEDOT:PSS are transition metal oxides MoO3,WO3, and V2O5 which have shown high hole collection efficiencies as well as improved device stabilities in organic solar cells.

Merocyanine
dyes have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in vacuum-processed BHJ and PHJ OPV devices. The chromophores show very high absorption strengths which enable efficient solar light collection with a thin active layer structure. However, due to a still quite limited number of studies for these organic semiconductors, the relation between the thin film morphology and the solar cell performance is mostly unexplored.
In this article, we investigate the influence of different transition metal oxide layers on the thin film morphology of a merocyanine dye (HB364). We also fabricate planar heterojunction (PHJ) cells using the various transition metal oxides as the anode buffer layer between the ITO electrode and the HB364 donor film. Furthermore, HB364:C60 BHJ and HB364/HB364:C60 hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) devices are prepared. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparison of PHJ and BHJ solar cells that were prepared with the same merocyanine dye.

The merocyanine dye 2-{4-butyl-5-[2-(1-butyl-3,3-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-ylidene)ethylid-ene]-5H-thiazol-2-ylidene}-malononitrile (HB364) was synthesized by heating an 8 mL Ac2O solution of (1-n-butyl-3,3-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-ylidene)-acetaldehyde (1.98 g, 8.0 mmol) and 2-(4-tert-butyl-5H-thiazol-2-ylidene)-malononitrile (1.50 g, 7.3 mmol) to 90 °C for 95 min after which n-hexane was added and the solution was decanted. After cooling to room temperature the precipitate was collected, washed with i-propanol, and recrystallized from CH2Cl2/n-hexane. Yield: 2.24 g (5.2 mmol, 71%), dark blue solid. 1H-NMR (CD2Cl2, 400 MHz): δ 7.97 (d, 3J = 13.5 Hz, 1H), 7.40 (m, 2H), 7.26 (m, 1H), 7.09 (m, 1H), 5.72 (d, 3J = 13.6 Hz, 1H), 2.89 (m, 2H), 1.79 (m, 2H), 1.69 (s, 6H), 1.48 (m, 2H), 1.00 (t, 3J = 7.4 Hz, 3H). UV/Vis (CH2Cl2): λmax: 618 nm (137100 M−1 cm−1). HRMS (ESI): calcd for C26H30N4S [M]+: 430.2191, found: 430.2185. Elemental analysis (%) calcd for C26H30N4S: C, 72.52; H, 7.02; N, 13.01; S, 7.45.

CV was performed on a standard commercial electrochemical analyzer (EC epsilon; BAS Instrument, UK) in a three electrode single-compartment cell under argon. Dichloromethane (HPLC grade) was obtained from J. T. Baker (Mumbai, India) and dried over calcium hydride and degassed prior to use. The supporting electrolyte tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) was recrystallized from ethanol/water and dried in a high vacuum. The measurements were carried out under exclusion of air and moisture at a concentration of 10−4 M with ferrocene as internal standard for the calibration of the potential. Working electrode: Pt disc; reference electrode: Ag/AgCl; auxiliary electrode: Pt wire. The reversible half-wave potential E1/2 of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was associated with a HOMO orbital level of −5.15 eV.



Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments (Dimension 5000 Microscope, Veeco Instruments) were performed with silicon cantilevers from Olympus type OMCL-AC160TS (Tokyo, Japan). The measurements were carried out in the tapping mode using silicon cantilevers with a nominal force constant of 42 N m−1 and a tip radius of ∼7 nm at a resonance frequency of about 320 kHz. The scan rate was kept at 0.7 Hz, while the tip–sample forces were carefully minimized to avoid artifacts.



X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) graphs of the thin films were recorded by a PANalytical's X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 nm). A typical scan was from 3–35° (2θ) with a step size of 0.017° and a counting time of 100 s per step. The samples were prepared on cleaned (15 min at an UV/O3 oven) ITO covered glass substrates by depositing an ∼5 nm thick metal oxide layer, following a 5–40 nm thick HB364 film. The deposition rate of the HB364 layer was 0.3 Å s−1.


Deep blue block crystals were grown by a slow evaporation of dichloromethane/hexane solution of the dye at 4 °C. The data were collected at 296 K with a Bruker AXS CCD detector, using graphite-monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.51478 Å) radiation. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by a full-matrix-least-square method, using 3402 unique reflections and 285 parameters. All non-hydrogen atoms were anisotropically refined and hydrogen atoms were placed on idealized positions. The measurement angle was from 2θmin = 3.65° to 2θmax = 57.29°. The analyzed crystal belongs to a monoclinic crystal system with the cell dimensions a = 13.1462(17) Å, b = 7.6460(11) Å and c = 24.1006(32) Å and the angle β = 91.010(4)°. The space group is P21/n with Z = 4. The final R and Rw for the observed data are 0.0493 and 0.1242, respectively. The goodness-of-fit (GooF) for the solution is 1.078.



Absorbance spectra of the HB364 films were recorded in transmission mode employing a HR2000+ spectrometer (OceanOptics) and a Xe lamp as the light source. The absorption measurements of the devices were performed in reflectance mode employing an integrating sphere.


Planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells with different transition metal oxide anode buffer layers were fabricated on prestructured indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrates with a cell area of 0.04 cm2. The devices were prepared by a thermal evaporation in a high vacuum (∼2 × 10−6 mbar) chamber (Lesker Ltd). Prior to the fabrication of the cells, the ITO substrates were cleaned in an UV/O3 oven for 15 min after which they were transferred into the vacuum chamber. All layers were successively deposited at a substrate temperature of 25 °C without breaking the vacuum in between the fabrication steps. The HB364 neat films as well as the donor films in the PHJ and HHJ devices were deposited at the rate of 0.3 Å s−1. All other organic and transition metal oxide layers were deposited at the rate of 1 Å s−1. The silver cathode layers were evaporated at the rate of 4 Å s−1.


Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2425 measurement unit at 25 °C in ambient air. During the J–V measurements, the cells were illuminated by 1.5 AM filtered light with an intensity of 100 W cm−2. The light intensity was set with a calibrated Si-photodiode. The cell degradation was observed to be negligible.


Contact angles were measured with a standard drop shape analysis instrumentation (DSA 10, Kruess Germany). Reported values are advancing contact angles: a drop of the test liquid was placed on the sample surface and continuously fed at 2 μL min−1 flow rate up to a total liquid volume of 20 μL. Starting from a minimum of about 3 μL, contact angles were measured while the syringe needle used for dosing remains in the droplet. Drop shape images were analyzed at a rate of ∼0.5 Hz, evaluated by a tangent method to determine the contact angle only from the parts of the image directly at the three-phase contact line. These contact angles were averaged over time: for each sample, five advancing droplets were measured at different positions and the average value is reported.


The growth of HB364 neat films was investigated after insertion of an ∼5 nm thick transition metal oxide layer between the HB364 film and the indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrate. The samples were fabricated by depositing first a thin MoO3, WO3, or V2O5 layer (∼5 nm) on an ITO substrate, following the evaporation of a HB364 layer with a nominal thickness of 10–40 nm. Additionally, also samples without the metal oxide layer were prepared. The results of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans of the 10 nm thick dye films on the different substrates are depicted in Fig. 1a and analyzed in Table S1 in the ESI. In the HB364 thin film diffraction graphs, the strong reflection at 2θ = 21.5° corresponds to the [211] diffraction plane of the polycrystalline ITO substrate whereas the reflection at 2θ = 7.7° is attributed to the crystalline dye film. The 2θ = 7.7° reflection is observed with 10 nm thick dye films on the pure and V2O5 modified ITO substrates whereas the HB364 films on the WO3 or MoO3 modified ITO substrates do not show any coherent reflection arising from the dye layer.


Fig. 1b depicts the XRD patterns of 20 nm thick HB364 layers on the different substrates. Deposition of the films on the pure and V2O5 modified ITO substrates results in strong 2θ = 7.7° reflections whose intensities are over double compared to the 10 nm thick films on the corresponding substrates. In the case of the pure ITO substrate, the peak width decreases as the film thickness increases indicating a more uniform particle size (see also Table S1 in the ESI). In turn, the width of the 2θ = 7.7° reflection on the V2O5 modified substrate does not substantially change when the HB364 film thickness increases from 10 to 20 nm. Furthermore, the dye film on the pure ITO substrate shows a very weak reflection at 2θ = 23.4° which is not observed in the graph of the V2O5 modified sample. In turn, the 20 nm thick dye films on the WO3 and MoO3 modified ITO substrates demonstrate two very weak diffractions at 2θ = 7.7° and 23.4°, respectively.
Suitable crystals for a single crystal X-ray analysis were grown by slow evaporation of a dichloromethane (DCM)/heptane solution of the dye at 4 °C. The dye molecules were found to crystallize in the P21/n space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The unit cell features two antiparallel stacked chromophores showing a close π–π contact of 3.6 Å between the acceptor heterocycles (Fig. 2b). These dimeric motifs are further stacked in one dimensional columnar structures which grow along the 2-fold screw axis (b-axis). The calculated diffraction pattern of the single crystal structure is compared with the experimental neat film graphs in Fig. 1. Based on the calculated peaks, the thin film reflections at 2θ = 7.7° and 23.4° are attributed to the [10] and [020] diffraction planes of the single crystal structure, respectively. The [10] reflection originates from an orientation where the chromophores stand up with the long molecular axis in a tilt of ∼60° to the substrate normal (i.e. “edge-on”, Fig. 2c) whilst the [020] diffraction plane corresponds to the orientation where the dyes' π-planes lie flat on the substrate (i.e. “face-on”, Fig. 2d). Interestingly, the 20 nm thick HB364 layers on the pure and V2O5 modified ITO substrates feature almost exclusively the edge-on alignment whereas the WO3 and MoO3 modifications result in a mixed growth of the edge-on and face-on orientations.
To gain deeper understanding of the growth of HB364 neat films, also 40 nm thick dye layers were deposited on pure and MoO3 modified ITO substrates (see Fig. S1). Furthermore, a sample with a 40 nm thick HB364 film on a 35 nm thick C60 layer was prepared. Deposition of HB364 layers on the pure or MoO3 modified ITO substrates results in strong reflections at 2θ = 7.7° and 23.4°. Compared to the 20 nm thick samples, the [020] diffraction at 2θ = 23.4° is substantially strengthened in both cases. Notably, the dye film on the C60 modified substrate shows only the wide angle reflection whilst the small angle peak is completely absent. We attribute this to the face-on orientation of the dye molecules.

To investigate the surface properties, contact angles of water, formamide, and diiodomethane on a pure ITO substrate and after insertion of a thin (∼5 nm) transition metal oxide layer on the ITO substrate were analyzed. Additionally, based on the obtained contact angles, surface energies Etotal were calculated employing the method of Owens and Wendt. An UV/O3 treatment of the ITO substrate results in a highly hydrophilic surface with a water contact angle θwater of 11° whereas the V2O5, WO3, or MoO3 modified (∼5 nm film) ITO substrates demonstrate rather hydrophobic surfaces with θwater of 66°, 73°, and 62°, respectively (Table 1). Correspondingly, the surface energy of the pure ITO substrate is substantially higher (71 mN m−1) compared to the V2O5, WO3, and MoO3 modified substrates which demonstrate Etotal of 51, 48, and 52 mN m−1, respectively. As a comparison, surface energies of 48 and 71 mN m−1 for ITO substrates with and without a 10 nm thick WO3 film, respectively, were reported previously. According to the Owens–Wendt analysis, the contributions of the disperse Edisperse and the polar Epolar parts to the Etotal between the different transition metal oxide modified surfaces are similar (Table 1). Furthermore, in agreement with the molecular structure, the substrate with a 50 nm thick C60 layer shows a highly hydrophobic surface with only a marginal contribution of the Epolar part (0.5 mN m−1) to the Etotal (46 mN m−1). Hence, we can conclude that the dye molecules seem to prefer the edge-on orientation on hydrophilic substrates (e.g. ITO) whereas hydrophobic substrates (e.g.C60) result in the face-on orientation. However, it is unclear why the molecules feature exclusively the [10] alignment on the V2O5 modified substrate whilst the MoO3 and WO3 modifications result in HB364 films with a low degree of crystallinity and a mixed growth of the [10] and [020] orientations.

As discussed above, the orientation of HB364 molecules is dependent on the substrate modification. Previous studies with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) have shown that the molecules either stand edge-on or lie face-on on the substrate depending on the chromophore–surface interactions. On weakly interacting surfaces (such as ITO and SiO2) the chromophores prefer edge-on arrangement whereas strong interactions (e.g. with PTCDA or CuI) force the molecules to face-on alignment. Furthermore, orientation of the first chromophore layers on the substrate has been observed to control the growth of the whole crystalline CuPc film.
Correspondingly, the observed preferred growth of HB364 films on the different substrates is attributed to dye–surface interactions. As shown above, the 10 nm thick HB364 layer on the pure ITO substrate features only the [10] reflection suggesting that only the edge-on orientation is present. However, when the thickness of the HB364 layer increases (>10 nm), the relative strength of the large angle [020] reflection increases as well. This may be rationalized by assuming that the first dye layers on the weakly interacting ITO substrate adopt the edge-on orientation which triggers the growth of the [10] crystallites. However, when the HB364 film thickness increases (>10 nm), the successive molecules gradually adopt the face-on orientation which is, in turn, observed as enhancement of the [020] reflection. Instead, the C60 modified substrate shows only the [020] peak of HB364 which suggests that already the first dye layers on the C60 surface adopt the face-on arrangement. This may be explained by the strong dispersive interactions between the π-systems of the dye and C60 molecules.


Atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans were recorded for nominally 10 nm thick HB364 neat films deposited on the different substrates (Fig. 3). The dye film on a pure ITO substrate shows a particle size ranging from 10–40 nm and agglomerates of circa 65 nm. Deposition of HB364 on a MoO3 modified substrate results in a more homogeneous layer with a particle size of ∼40 nm, whereas the HB364 film on a WO3 modified substrate demonstrates a particle size of 30–65 nm. Crystallites with a size of 30–50 nm are observed in the dye film on a V2O5 modified substrate.



Fig. 4 depicts the normalized absorption spectra of HB364 neat films (20 nm) on pure or MoO3, V2O5, and WO3 modified ITO substrates. Furthermore, absorption spectra of HB364 in dichloromethane and of a C60 neat film are shown. The solution spectrum features a strong (εmax = 1.32 × 105 M−1 cm−1) but a narrow absorption band with a maximum at 618 nm and a smaller peak at 576 nm. In turn, deposition of the dye on the different substrates results in uniform and broad absorption bands ranging from 450–700 nm. Compared to the solution spectrum, a broadening of the band and alternations of the vibronic progressions are observed that are indicative of excitonic coupling between molecular transition dipoles in the solid state. According to the excitonic coupling theory, antiparallelly stacked dipolar compounds with strongly interacting π-orbitals are expected to show hypsochromically shifted absorption bands with respect to the monomeric spectra. Correspondingly, in previous solution studies with MCs, a hypsochromic shift in the absorption spectrum has been attributed to an antiparallel face-to-face packing of chromophores (H-type aggregation). Hence, the predominantly hypsochromic shift in the thin film absorption spectra (λmax = 593 nm), with respect to the monomeric solution band of HB364 (λmax = 618 nm), can be attributed to H-type coupling of the dye molecules that originates from closely packed antiparallel dimers as observed in the single crystal (Fig. 2b).

The absorption coefficient α of the dye films on a pure ITO substrate as well as on V2O5 and MoO3 modified substrates is circa 2.3 × 105 cm−1 at λ = 593 nm whereas deposition of the dye film on a WO3 modified substrate results in α593 ≈ 1.7 × 105 cm−1. These absorption coefficients are very high, which is attributed to the nearly ideal perpendicular orientation of the dipole transition vectors of the molecules with respect to the incident light.

In the second part of this article the effect of transition metal oxide buffer layers on the performance of HB364/C60 PHJ solar cells is presented. As a comparison also HB364:C60 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and HB364/HB364:C60 hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) devices were fabricated (Fig. 5). As shown above, the orientation and the degree of crystallinity of the dye film can be altered by changing the underlying layer. The crystalline donor layers are expected to show several benefits over the less crystalline counterparts such as (i) better charge transport properties, (ii) longer exciton diffusion lengths, and (iii) improved photon collection efficiencies due to the larger interface areas.


The energy level diagram of the used materials is depicted in Fig. 5a. The HOMO level (−5.6 eV) of HB364 is obtained from a cyclic voltammetric measurement and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is estimated by subtracting the optical bad gap (Eg) from the experimental HOMO level. The Eg is taken from the absorption maximum (λmax = 616 nm) in DCM yielding the LUMO level of −3.6 eV. Previously reported work functions (ΦW) of MoO3, WO3, and V2O5 are −5.3, −5.1, and −4.7 eV, respectively. Note, however, that the energy level positions of MoO3 are under discussions, and for example, Kahn and co-workers have proposed EHOMO = −6.7 eV. Irrespective of the exact position of the energy levels, transition metal oxides have successively been used to replace the commonly employed anode buffer layer PEDOT:PSS (EHOMO = −5.2 eV) in OPV devices. The energy levels of C60 and Bphen are taken from the literature.


The influence of the transition metal oxide layer on the performance of HB364/C60 PHJ devices was investigated. The used device architecture was ITO/X (0 or 5 nm)/HB364 (5–20 nm)/C60 (35 nm)/Bphen (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm), where the thickness of the HB364 layer was changed in steps of 5 nm from 5–20 nm (Fig. 5b). The buffer layer X was a ∼5 nm thick film of MoO3, WO3, or V2O5. In addition, also devices without the metal oxide layer were fabricated. From now on, we refer to the different devices by the buffer layer and the cells without a transition metal oxide film are called ITO.


Table 2 shows the cell parameters of the devices and Fig. 6 illustrates the dependence of the key device characteristics of the best PHJ cells on the donor layer thickness (for the corresponding current–voltage (J–V) characteristics see Fig. S2 in the ESI). The ITO, MoO3, and WO3 devices feature the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a 5 nm thick donor layer whereas the optimal HB364 film thickness of the V2O5 cells is 10 nm. The V2O5 devices with a 10 nm thick donor layer show an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 740 mV, short circuit current (JSC) of 5.3 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 68% yielding a PCE of 2.7% that is the highest value among the PHJ devices. Instead, the WO3 cells demonstrate clearly the lowest PCE of 1.6% which is mainly attributed to the low VOC of 527 mV.

The VOC of the ITO and V2O5 devices stays constant or slightly increases when the active layer thickness increases (Fig. 6). Instead, the VOC of the MoO3 and WO3 cells gradually decreases with the increasing donor layer thickness. All devices show similar JSC values at HB364 layer thicknesses of 5 and 10 nm. The ITO cells give the highest JSC of 5.4 mA cm−2 that is already reached at the donor layer thickness of 5 nm. Increasing the donor layer thickness beyond 10 nm results in a decrease in JSC for all devices. The JSC of the WO3 cells decreases fastest beyond a HB364 layer thickness of 10 nm. Irrespective of the anode modification, all devices show a decrease of the fill factor upon increasing the donor layer thickness. Because this decrease is, however, least pronounced for V2O5 cells, these devices are the only ones, whose highest PCE is reached at the active layer thickness of 10 nm. The efficiency value of 2.7% is also the best one among all our measured PHJ solar cells.
While ITO and V2O5 devices show very similar performance, the WO3 devices show very different performance (Fig. 6). For this reason a closer look on J–V characteristics of the WO3 and V2O5 cells with the 10 and 20 nm thick donor layers is particularly interesting (Fig. 7). The WO3 cells, with the 10 nm thick donor layer, show “normal” J–V characteristics whereas the 20 nm thick cells demonstrate S-shaped curves. Instead, both the 10 and 20 nm thick V2O5 cells feature “normal” J–V curves (Fig. 7a). Correspondingly, fill factor of the WO3 cells drops from 55 to 18% when the donor layer thickness increases from 10 to 20 nm, respectively, whilst the FF of the V2O5 cells decreases only from 68 to 53% for the same donor layer thicknesses. The sudden drop of the FF and formation of the S-kink in the J–V characteristics of the WO3 devices are attributed to poor hole transport characteristics of the active layers. This is illustrated in Fig. 7b that depicts the dark curves of the corresponding V2O5 and WO3 cells at the forward current range. By looking at the dark curves, it is evident that the charge transport properties of the WO3 cells with 20 nm thick donor layers are significantly lower compared to the V2O5 devices with the same donor layer thicknesses. This is also observed in the series resistance RS (estimated from the slope (dV/dJ) close to V = 1.5 V) of the WO3 cells which increases from 16 to 2100 Ω cm2 when the active layer thickness rises from 10 to 20 nm, respectively. The corresponding RS of the V2O5 devices are 11 and 72 Ω cm2.
The poor hole transport properties of the WO3 cells may be explained by the HB364 neat film structure (Fig. 1). The 10 nm thick dye film on the WO3 modified substrate is amorphous whilst the 20 nm thick film features mixed growth of the [10] and [020] preferred orientations. In turn, both the 10 nm and 20 nm thick HB364 films on the V2O5 modified substrates show a single strong peak which is attributed to the [10] reflection. The low degree of crystallinity and the mixed growth of the preferred orientations on the WO3 modified substrates are expected to result in a more pronounced energetic disorder and a high number of grain boundaries which lower the hole mobility of the donor layer. Hence, the poor hole mobility results in an imbalanced charge transport of the holes and the electrons which is observed as the S-kinks in the illuminated J–V characteristics. Instead, the highly crystalline donor films on the V2O5 modified substrates result in a more balanced charge transport and, thus, higher fill factors in the PHJ devices. In addition to the FF also the VOC of WO3 PHJ cells rapidly decreases as the HB364 layer thickness increases. This effect is also attributed to the imbalanced charge transport of the cells and the energetic disorder of the donor layer. Especially in the WO3 devices with a HB364 film >10 nm the holes are expected to accumulate at the heterojunction leading to increased charge recombination which has been shown to reduce VOC. An additional explanation for the observed differences could be the variation of the hole-injection barrier depending on the orientation of the molecules relative to the contacts.

Fig. 8 depicts the absorption spectra (measured in reflectance mode) of ITO devices with nominally 5 and 10 nm thick donor layers. Due to the high absorption coefficient of the HB364 film, the absorption of the PHJ cells is extremely high as well. However, irrespective of the two times higher absorption strength (at 590 nm) of the cells with 10 nm thick donor layers, the JSC is only marginally (∼0.1 mA cm−2) higher compared to the devices with 5 nm thick HB364 layers. The marginal improvement in JSC, when the donor layer thickness increases from 5 to 10 nm, can be explained by the structure of the film (Fig. 3). The AFM scans of the film show an island like growth of crystallites of a size beyond the typical exciton diffusion length of organic materials (1–20 nm). Therefore, it is likely that a major part of the formed excitons upon illumination are not able to reach the D/A interface, which, in turn, explains the marginal improvement in JSC when the donor layer thickness increases. In order to investigate this possibility, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 5 and 10 nm thick dye films with and without a 5 nm thick C60 exciton quenching layer were recorded (see Fig. S3 in the ESI). Despite the overlap of the excitation wavelength (the 532 nm line of an Ar laser) and the C60 absorption band, the contribution of the C60 layer to the PL intensity is assumed to be negligible. The 5 and 10 nm thick dye films, without the quenching layer, demonstrate similar emission bands with a maximum at ∼775 nm. However, deposition of the C60 quenching layer on top of the 5 nm thick dye film results in an emission band with 30% of the original PL intensity. Instead, the 10 nm thick HB364 film with the overstanding C60 layer shows a significantly higher residual emission (65% of the intensity of the sample without the quenching layer). These results clearly demonstrate that the exciton quenching is more efficient in devices with 5 nm thick donor layers. In turn, this indicates a very short exciton diffusion length (below 5 nm), in contrast to general belief which assumes 10–20 nm. Furthermore, both thin films with the quenching layer show significant residual PL intensities suggesting that substantially higher JSC could be achieved by a better control over the particle size of the donor layer in HB364/C60PHJ devices.

For comparison also bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices were fabricated with the following cell architecture: ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/HB364:C60 (10–40 nm)/C60 (25 nm)/BPhen (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm), where the thickness of the active layer (HB364:C60 40:60 wt%) was changed in steps of 10 nm from 10–40 nm (Fig. 5c). Fig. 9 shows the key device parameters with respect to the active layer thickness. The JSC improves from 4.4 to 7.7 mA cm−2 when the active layer thickness increases from 10–30 nm, respectively, whilst the FF decreases from 65 to 45%. The PCE (2.5%) is maximized at the active layer thickness of 30 nm (for the J–V characteristics of the BHJ devices see Fig. S4a).

The absorption spectrum of the BHJ devices with a 30 nm thick active layer (HB364:C60) is depicted in Fig. 8. The absorption band is remarkably different from those of PHJ devices and resembles the solution spectrum with a clear maximum at 655 nm and a shoulder at 610 nm. The solution-like spectrum suggests an amorphous film structure. Hence, the donor phase does not grow into large crystalline domains as seen for the neat films (Fig. 3). Because the donor and acceptor components are finely intermixed in the active layer, efficient exciton collection at the D/A heterointerface in the BHJ cells is expected. Indeed, despite the lower absorption of the BHJ cells (Fig. 8), the JSC of the best devices is approximately 30% higher compared to the best PHJ cells. The thin film absorption spectra and the measured short circuit current densities are also in good agreement with the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices (Fig. 8). For the ITO PHJ and BHJ devices shown in Fig. 8JSC values of 5.5 and 8.6 mA cm−2, respectively, were calculated from the EQE spectra (Fig. 8). However, the fill factor of the BHJ devices is lower and strongly dependent on the HB364:C60 thickness which is attributed to the poor charge transport properties of the amorphous active layer. Consequently, the PCE (2.5%) of the best BHJ devices remains lower compared to the best PHJ cells (2.7%).

As shown above, the short circuit current density of the BHJ devices is clearly higher compared to the PHJ cells. However, the PCE stays lower due to the poor FF which is attributed to the modest charge transport properties of the amorphous active layer in the BHJ cells. In order to improve the photon harvesting efficiency of the cells but at the same time maintain good FF, hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) devices were fabricated. The HHJ cells present the following device architecture: ITO/V2O5 (5 nm)/HB364 (5 nm)/HB364:C60 (5–20 nm)/C60 (35 nm)/Bphen (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (Fig. 5d). The thickness of the HB364 layer was fixed to 5 nm which is a compromise between the photon collection efficiency and the charge transport property of the film.

Note that the thin HB364 neat film can also be considered as a p-type buffer layer.Fig. 9 shows the evolution of the key device parameters with respect to the active layer thickness (for the J–V characteristics of the HHJ devices see Fig. S4b). Every cell parameter of the HHJ devices shows improvement compared to the BHJ cells with the same HB364:C60 layer thickness. The best HHJ cells with 15 and 20 nm thick HB364:C60 active layers demonstrate a PCE of 2.9% which is clearly higher than the highest PCE (2.5%) of the BHJ cells. However, compared to the best PHJ devices (2.7%) the efficiency improvement is small. This is attributed to the rapidly declining FF of the HHJ cells with increasing HB364:C60 layer thickness, which is only partially compensated by the improvement of JSC.

We have shown that the morphology of HB364 merocyanine thin films can be modified through insertion of a transition metal oxide layer between the ITO covered glass substrate and the dye film. We have also shown that deposition of the molecules on an ITO or V2O5 modified ITO substrate results in highly crystalline dye films where the chromophores have adopted an edge-on orientation with respect to the substrate surface. In turn, the merocyanine films on WO3 or MoO3 modified ITO surfaces exhibit a lower degree of crystallinity as well as a simultaneous growth of the edge-on and face-on orientations. A highly crystalline film showing exclusively the face-on arrangement is obtained when the dye molecules are deposited on top of a C60 layer.

Planar heterojunction HB364/C60 devices were fabricated employing the transition metal oxides as the anode buffer layers. The PHJ devices with highly crystalline HB364 donor layers (pure ITO or V2O5 modified anodes) demonstrated the highest device performances up to 2.7% whereas the efficiency of the devices with less ordered donor films (WO3 buffer layers) was clearly inferior. The best PHJ cells outperformed also the HB364:C60 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) cells whose efficiencies reached 2.5%. The lower power conversion efficiency of BHJ devices was attributed to poor FF owing to the amorphous active layer structure. However, despite the broader and stronger absorption of the PHJ devices, the JSC remained lower compared to the BHJ cells. This was explained by the particle size of the HB364 donor film which is larger than the exciton diffusion length of the dye. Finally, the highest power conversion efficiency of 2.9% could be achieved with the HB364/HB364:C60 hybrid heterojunction device architecture.
