High efficiency perovskite solar cells can be made through the Lewis adduct approach. The interaction between PbI2 and the Lewis base is a key factor to make high quality perovskite films. Here, we combine a two-step method with the Lewis adduct approach to fabricate high quality organometallic perovskite films by tuning the strength of the Pb–O bond in Lewis acid–base adducts via adding different Lewis base additives. By optimizing the strength of the Pb–O bond, smooth CH3NH3PbI3 films with large perovskite grains are prepared. The high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films lead to a low recombination rate, long carrier life time and highly efficient charge transfer process. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the best perovskite solar cell increases from 12.79% to 17.26%.

Organometallic halide perovskites, especially CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), have attracted enormous attention due to their great potential in photovoltaics. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been boosted significantly from the initial 3.8% to above 20% within the last few years. Until now, several methods have been developed to fabricate high quality perovskite films, such as the one-step method, two-step method, dual-source evaporation, and vapor-assisted deposition method. Very recently, Park's group proposed a modified one-step method to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells through Lewis acid–base adducts. They mixed PbI2, MAI, and some electron-pair donor solvents (such as dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and thiourea) in dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a precursor solution. By spin coating, perovskite related Lewis adducts formed on the substrate, which were then converted to perovskite film by removing the solvent molecules through annealing. In their method, the perovskite related Lewis adducts played a major role in forming high quality perovskite films.

The two-step method is also widely used to fabricate efficient PSCs. In the traditional two-step method, MAPbI3 formed through intercalation of MAI into the PbI2 lattice. After reaction, the volume of the unit cell expands from 124 Å3 to 248 Å3. Meanwhile, some small grains might exist on the surface of the perovskite film, which increase its roughness. Zhu et al. found that they can prepare smooth perovskite films by suppressing the volume expansion during the intercalation. Actually, it also forms a Lewis adduct of PbI2·DMF through weak dative Pb–O bonds between Pb atoms and DMF molecules during spin coating, where PbI2 acts as a Lewis acid and DMF acts as a Lewis base. In the Lewis adduct PbI2·DMF, the PbI2 lattice was expanded ∼30% by the intercalation of DMF molecules. But, the PbI2 related Lewis adducts were converted to PbI2, followed by reaction with MAI in the traditional two-step method. Very recently, we reported a modified two-step method to fabricate perovskite films from the PbI2 related Lewis adducts through molecule exchange. The average PCE increased from 8.7% to 15.3% by adding a small amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) in the DMF solution. It shows that the PbI2 related Lewis adducts play an active role in the formation of high quality perovskite films. Therefore, it is possible to control the morphology and quality of the perovskite films by modulating the formation of Lewis adducts.
Donor number (DN) is a quantitative measure of the electron-pair donating ability of Lewis bases. A stronger Lewis base has a larger DN. Commonly used polar aprotic solvents, such as DMF, NMP, DMSO, and HMPA, are O-donor Lewis bases with donor numbers of 26.6, 27.3, 29.8, and 38.8, respectively. These solvents can be used to prepare PbI2 Lewis adducts coordinated through Pb–O bonds. However, the solubility of PbI2 in NMP and HMPA is too low to prepare continuous films. In order to increase the solubility of PbI2, we add these strong Lewis bases into DMF to form binary mixed solvents. It has been demonstrated that the length of the metal–oxygen bond is shortened in binary mixed solvents due to the solvation steric effect. Meanwhile, Pb2+ prefers to coordinate to the solvent with a stronger coordination ability in binary mixed solvents. The donor number of the binary mixed solvent can be adjusted by changing the concentration of the Lewis base.
Here, we combine the two-step method with the Lewis adduct approach to control the quality of perovskite films by tuning the strength of Pb–O bonds in the PbI2 Lewis adducts via choosing solvents with suitable donor numbers. Compared to the traditional two-step method, the lattice of PbI2 is pre-expanded by the solvent molecules, resulting in high quality perovskite films and high efficiency PSCs.

FTO glass (TEC7, Pilkington) was sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, 2-propanol, ethanol, and deionized water, dried using nitrogen gas and then exposed to a UVO cleaner at 150 °C for 15 min. To deposit a compact layer of TiO2 on the FTO glass, a titanium isopropoxy solution in ethanol was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. To form the mesoporous TiO2 layers, diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol-18NRT, Dyesol) in ethanol (2:7, weight ratio) was then deposited on the compact layer by spin coating at 4500 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the annealed mesoporous TiO2 was about 200 nm. The PbI2/DMF (1.2 M) solution with different volume percentages of Lewis base additives (NMP, DMSO, and HMPA) was spin coated on the substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form Lewis acid–base adduct thin films. The Lewis adduct films were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (MAI) in 2-propanol with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 for 60 s to prepare perovskite films. Afterward, the perovskite films were washed with 2-propanol and annealed at 100 °C for 60 min to remove the residual solvents in the perovskite film. After drying, a hole-transporting layer (HTL) was deposited by spin coating 100 mg mL−1 solution of spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene, oxidized by the addition of 60 μL cobalt(III) dopant (FK209), and then 40 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 36.3 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) were added into the solution. Spin coating was carried out at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a gold electrode (60 nm) was deposited on the top of HTL to form a complete perovskite solar cell. The active area of the electrode was fixed at 0.06 cm2.


The morphology of perovskite films was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN VP Compact), atomic force microscopy (AFM5500, Agilent), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Smartlab, Rigaku), and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy (Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR, Agilent Technologies). The Lewis adducts PbI2·xSol were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (VERTEX 70v) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/Q5000IR). Impedance spectra (IS) of the PSCs were obtained in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) under a bias voltage of 0.9 V and an alternative signal of 10 mV in a frequency range from 1 to 1 MHz. The obtained impedance spectra were analysed by Z-view software. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using an Edinburgh FLS 920 instrument (Livingston, WL, UK). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were measured under a solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, 91195, Newport) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.


The perovskite films are fabricated by a modified two-step method by immersing the as-prepared Lewis adducts PbI2·xSol (here, Sol = DMF, NMP, DMSO, and HMPA), rather than PbI2, into MAI/2-propanol solution. The Lewis adducts PbI2·xSol are prepared from the PbI2/DMF solution with different Lewis base additives by spin coating. The Lewis adducts convert to perovskite through molecular exchange between the solvent molecules and MAI. The concentration of additives in the DMF solution is optimized to maximize the perovskite grain size. A high concentration of additives will lead to precipitation of PbI2 in the solution or decrease of grain size (see Fig. S1). Under our conditions, the optimized volume percentage of the additives in DMF is 10% for NMP, 8% for DMSO, and 2% for HMPA. Fig. 1 shows top-view SEM images of the MAPbI3 films fabricated from solution with different Lewis base additives. It is clearly seen that the grain sizes depend on the Lewis basicity. The average grain sizes are 197, 237, 340 and 146 nm for the perovskite films prepared from pure DMF, 10% NMP, 8% DMSO, and 2% HMPA, respectively (see Fig. S2), which are in accordance with the annealed PbI2·xSol films (Fig. S3). Large perovskite grains with size exceeding 1 μm are observed in the sample prepared from the solution with 8% DMSO (Fig. S4). The roughness of the perovskite film is characterized by atomic force microscopy. As shown in Fig. S5, the average roughness (Rrms) values are 43, 15, 12, and 20 nm for the perovskite films fabricated from pure DMF, 10% NMP, 8% DMSO, and 2% HMPA, respectively. The smooth surface is derived from lattice expansion in the Lewis adducts of PbI2·xSol (Fig. S6). The perovskite films fabricated from solution with NMP and DMSO have large grains and smooth surfaces, which are desired for high efficiency perovskite solar cells with high stability. The donor number of the mixed solutions of DMF/Sol (Sol = NMP, DMSO, HMPA) might differ from those of the additives. The additives of NMP, DMSO and HMPA have higher priority in forming Lewis adducts of PbI2·xSol than DMF due to larger DN. Therefore, the morphologies of PbI2·xSol and perovskite films change evidently after adding some strong Lewis base additives in the DMF solution.


Fig. 1e–h present cross-sectional SEM images of the PSCs fabricated from different solutions. The PSC contains a FTO bottom cathode, a compact and a mesoporous TiO2 layer, a perovskite capping layer, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer, and a gold top anode. The perovskite capping layers are about 310 nm thick for all devices. The capping layer contains mainly only one grain in the thickness direction for the samples prepared from DMSO and NMP, while it might contain 1–3 grains for the samples prepared from pure DMF and HMPA additive. The grain boundaries distribute randomly in the perovskite films prepared from pure DMF (see Fig. 1e). But the boundaries become perpendicular to the substrate when Lewis bases are added into the DMF solution (see Fig. 1f and g), which are beneficial for reducing non-radiative charge carrier recombination at grain boundaries.
The perovskite films are further characterized by XRD. The MAPbI3 peaks are identified and marked by asterisks (Fig. S7a). According to XRD curves, the MAPbI3 fabricated from 8% DMSO exhibits the best crystallization (Fig. S7b). Fig. S7c shows the UV-absorption spectra of the perovskite films. The perovskite films exhibit an onset of absorption at ∼775 nm, corresponding to the bandgap of ∼1.6 eV for the MAPbI3. The MAPbI3 fabricated from 8% DMSO exhibits the highest light harvesting ability in the range of 400–800 nm. There are obvious sharp drops at ∼530 nm in all absorption spectra, which may originate from the residual PbI2 (∼2.35 eV), or the intrinsic band structure of MAPbI3 film.
Polar aprotic solvents, such as DMF, DMSO, NMP, and HMPA, can form Lewis adducts with PbI2 through Pb–O bonds. These solvents have different Lewis basicity and structures (Fig. S8). In order to investigate the interaction strength between PbI2 and the polar aprotic solvents, we measure the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmittance spectra of the solvents and the corresponding Lewis acid–base adducts (Fig. 2a–d). The characteristic peaks at 1670, 1683, 1050, and 1209 cm−1 are derived from the stretching vibration of CO, CO, SO, PO for pure DMF, NMP, DMSO, and HMPA, respectively. After forming Lewis adducts PbI2·xSol, these characteristic peaks downshift to 1627, 1662, 990, and 1195 cm−1, respectively. It indicates that Pb atoms interact with solvent molecules through Pb–O bonds.

Fig. 2e shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the different Lewis adducts. The initial decomposition temperature (Ti) is defined as the temperature at 95% weight. The Ti are 114, 129, 147, and 170 °C for the Lewis adducts prepared from the solution of pure DMF, 10% NMP, 8% DMSO, and 2% HMPA, respectively. In addition, the Lewis adducts decomposed completely to PbI2 at temperatures of 138, 210, 263, and 275 °C, respectively. It shows that the Lewis adducts prepared from stronger Lewis bases are more thermally stable due to the stronger Pb–O bond.
The donor number can be used to measure the strength of Lewis basicity. Fig. 2f shows plots of the decomposition temperature and the mean grain size of the perovskites depending on the donor numbers of the Lewis bases. Ti increases with increase in the donor number. It implies that the Pb–O bonds in PbI2·xSol become stronger as the Lewis basicity increases. However, the perovskite fabricated from DMSO (DN = 29.8) has the largest grain size. The average grain size drops sharply when the donor number increases to 38.8, which indicates that the Lewis basicity influences the growth of the PbI2·xSol greatly.

Fig. 3a shows J–V curves of the champion perovskite solar cells fabricated from different solutions. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PSC fabricated from the solution with the DMSO additive exhibits the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 17.26%, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.74 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.716. The PSC fabricated from the solution with the NMP additive has a PCE of 15.41%, which is comparable with that of our previous report. The photovoltaic performances of the PSCs fabricated from solution with DMSO and NMP are better than that from pure DMF (PCE = 12.79%, Jsc = 21.08 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V, FF = 0.619). The IPCE spectra further confirm that the PSCs fabricated from 8% DMSO exhibit a better quantum yield through the whole wavelength than the PSCs fabricated from pure DMF (Fig. S9). It is noted that the Jsc integrated from the IPCE spectrum is lower than that obtained from the reverse scan. This discrepancy may be related to the slow response of Jsc as can be seen in the time-dependent current density plot as shown in Fig. 3b. As expected, the performance of PSCs fabricated from the HMPA additive decreased considerably due to the significantly smaller size of the perovskite grains (Fig. S2). The statistical results based on a series of PSCs fabricated for each condition also show a similar trend (Fig. 3c–f). Fig. 3b shows the stabilized power output of the best PSCs at the maximum power point voltage (Vmp) under one sun illumination. The devices fabricated from strong Lewis bases exhibit higher PCE than that from pure DMF. They also take a shorter time to reach the maximum PCE. The fast response speed indicates that the devices have high quality perovskite films with low trap densities. It needs to be noted that the stabilized PCEs are lower than those obtained from the reverse scan for all devices, which were widely observed in the PSCs with evident hysteresis (Fig. S10).

Fig. 4a shows impedance spectra of the PSCs measured in the dark under 0.9 V forward bias. The simplified equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 4a) is used to analyse the recombination and transportation in the PSCs. In the circuit, Rs is the series resistance between two electrodes; Rrec in parallel with capacity Crec reflects the recombination in PSCs; the recombination rate in the device is the inverse of recombination resistance (Rrec);RHTM in parallel with capacity CHTM is related to the diffusion of holes into the hole transport layers. In our situation, Rs reduces from 35.1 Ω to 12.5 Ω when DMSO is added in DMF solution. The Rrec of the PSC fabricated from the DMSO additive is 588.9 Ω, which is about 3.7 times higher than that from the pure DMF solution (160.7 Ω). The high Rrec indicates a low recombination rate in the device, which is ascribed to the large perovskite grains and small grain boundary in MAPbI3 film (Fig. 1). Therefore, PSCs fabricated from the solution with the DMSO additive have high FF and Voc.
The steady-state analysis of the charge transport process and the dynamics of recombination are also measured. The configuration of the sample for steady PL measurement is composed of MAPbI3 film deposited on the TiO2 substrate (see the inset of Fig. 4b). The intensity of the PL spectrum decreased significantly by incorporating 8% DMSO into solutions, indicating the high electron injection from MAPbI3 into TiO2 film. The PL intensity of the PSC fabricated from 10% NMP increases slightly, which may be caused by the residual PbI2 in the film. The residual PbI2 can block the transportation of electrons due to its wide bandgap. To confirm the charge transport process, time-resolved PL spectra are also characterized (see Fig. 4c). The time-resolved spectra can be well fitted by a bi-exponential decay containing a fast decay (τ1) and slow decay (τ2)
I(t) = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2
(1)
The fast decay process is related to quenching of free carriers in the perovskite film transporting through to TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD, whereas the slow decay is related to radiative decay. The fast decay components (τ1) are 0.99 ns, 1.02 ns, and 0.87 ns for the perovskite fabricated from the solutions of pure DMF, 10%NMP, and 8%DMSO, respectively, which are consistent with the steady PL spectra. The reduced fast decay life indicated that the charge transfer is fast in PSCs fabricated from the 8% DMSO additive. So, the enhanced Jsc in PSCs fabricated from 8% DMSO can be ascribed to the fast transfer, better injection of free carriers and stronger light harvesting ability (Fig. S7c).

In summary, high quality organometallic halide perovskite films are fabricated by combining the two-step method with the Lewis adduct approach. The Lewis adduct PbI2·xSol coordinated through a Pb–O bond is formed. The growth of PbI2·xSol is greatly influenced by the strength of the Pb–O bond, which depends on the donor number of solvents. High quality CH3NH3PbI3 films with large perovskite grains and smooth surface are prepared by optimizing the strength of the Pb–O bond. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the best perovskite solar cells increased significantly from 12.79% to 17.26%. This work provides a new vision to understand the formation of organometallic halide perovskite films, which benefit improvement of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
