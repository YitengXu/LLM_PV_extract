In this paper, we report on the photovoltaic properties of conventional organic photovoltaic solar cells integrating a sputtered ZnO interfacial film deposited on the absorber P3HT:PCBM layer. An emphasis has been put on the influence of the annealing temperature and time for restoring and controlling the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface morphology, which can be damaged by the sputtering process. We show a significant improvement in the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics upon annealing up to 160 °C. This is evidenced by the reduction of the S-shape of these curves systematically observed for the cells integrating thick (100 nm) sputtered ZnO films. This approach was also highlighted on cells containing thinner (20 nm) ZnO films using a longer annealing process at 140 °C, which led to a significant improvement of the power conversion efficiency compared with the value recorded in as-prepared cells or in cells with no interfacial ZnO layer. These photovoltaic performances have been related to the change of the morphology of the absorber layer and to the vertical phase segregation of P3HT:PCBM at the interface with ZnO. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy have been performed in order to confirm this approach.

On the road towards commercial applications, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have to develop higher power conversion efficiency (PCE), lightness, flexibility, lifetime, and lower price. The major challenge is to combine all these features into a finished product, especially by means of large-scale industrial operations. Over the last few years, PCE of OPV cells has been increasing continuously, reaching 6 to 8% for a conventional structure (holes extracted at the bottom electrode) and 4 to 5% for an inverted architecture (holes extracted at the top electrode). However, in spite of better photovoltaic performances, the conventional structure is vulnerable to oxidation and electrode degradation in ambient air when aluminum is used as a low-work function metallic cathode. Recently, it was reported that suitable interface engineering at the electron-collecting electrode can improve the photovoltaic and stability performances of a conventional structure. The insertion of interfacial materials between the cathode and the photoactive layer allows conservation (or even increase) of the PCE while improving the lifetime of the OPV cells. These materials, which prohibit chemical and physical reactions, can also act as a multifunctional buffer layer to adjust the energetic barrier, select the carriers at the contact, act as optical spacer and determine the device polarity. Different interfacial layers such as TiOx and ZnO have been successfully used for this purpose. Nevertheless, the use of ZnO as an interfacial material in OPV cells has been reported to be more interesting with respect to that of TiO2. This is mainly due to the higher electron mobility in ZnO and consequently to the lower series resistance induced in the OPV cell.

Among the techniques that can be used to grow ZnO at room temperature, sputtering allows, with respect to chemical methods, dense and reproducible films and is compatible with roll-to-roll coating processes. The sputtering technique is also considered for the deposition of electric contacts ensuring sharp interfaces between ZnO and the metallic electrode. However, when a sputtered layer is grown on organic materials, interface defects are frequently observed, leading to poor device performances. Consequently, this technique has been so far avoided for the growth of ZnO. However, it was recently reported that sputtering deposition of metallic contacts on the photoactive layers has been successfully carried out in OPV devices. These studies showed that damage observed on the absorber layers can be avoided by using appropriate annealing treatments. In our group, we have already studied the possibility to grow, at room temperature by rf magnetron sputtering, interfacial ZnO films on the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer of a conventional structure (Fig. 1a). It appeared that under specific sputtering conditions, the OPV cells presented no functional damage and showed even an improvement of the photovoltaic performances. However, as reported, the sputtering process also induced important transformations at the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface (Fig. 1b and c). These effects lead to a counter-diode behavior observed in the current–voltage (J–V) variation of the OPV devices integrating a 100 nm thick ZnO layer. This points out the possible existence of an energy barrier at the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface that hampers efficient charge collection. The physical explanation of such undesirable effects is still controversial. However, recent studies demonstrated the crucial role of the morphology at the interface between the active layer and the electron transport layer. These results showed that the preparation of the OPV devices can be directly correlated to variations of the interface properties leading to a performance improvement.
In this paper, we report on the effects of thermal annealing on the performances of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/Al conventional OPV cells integrating interfacial sputtered ZnO films of 20, 54 and 100 nm. According to the ZnO thickness, a suitable annealing has been carried out. Both annealing time and temperature have been varied in order to repair the functional defects and optimize the device performances.
The preparation of the samples was reported in a previous paper. We recall here that after the deposition of the complete stack, all samples undergo a thermal annealing step at 140 °C for 15 min under N2 atmosphere. This treatment was widely used by other authors in order to improve the performances of the P3HT:PCBM based devices and became for many authors an integral part of the sample preparation. Therefore, in the present work, these samples will be referred to as “as-prepared” samples. The additional annealing treatments as well as the transport measurements were performed under N2 atmosphere. All the results are discussed with respect to a reference as-prepared sample which did not contain any ZnO interfacial layer.
In our previous work, the as-prepared OPV cells integrating ZnO layers of 54 and 100 nm showed a strong S-shape (inflection point) in the J–V curves, suggesting the existence of a barrier that hampers the efficient charge collection at the Al electrode. This was associated with possible defects existing at the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface and the effect was found to be stronger as the ZnO thickness increased. The J–V curve recorded under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination of the as-prepared sample containing a 100 nm thick ZnO layer is reported in Fig. 2 along with the curve of the reference sample. It can be clearly observed that the presence of the sputtered ZnO layer reduces drastically the performances of the cell illustrated by the reduction of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). In order to heal the defects induced by sputtering at the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface, we annealed our samples at 160 °C for 15 min. This leads to a drastic correction of the J–V curve, to a strong parallel resistance, and therefore to a remarkable improvement of the photovoltaic characteristics: Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE. The annealing at 160 °C leads to better results even in regard to the reference cell. The PCE converges to a value of 2.4%, larger than the value of 2.1% measured for the reference (ZnO-free) device. In order to check if further performance increase is possible, a second (cumulative) annealing at 180 °C was carried out. Unfortunately, a degradation of the OPV cell performances is observed, suggesting that above a critical temperature, further annealing no longer has a positive effect on the defect healing. These observations were confirmed on the sample containing the 54 nm thick ZnO film, although the counter-diode effect was initially less important and the Voc more stable upon annealing. All data are summarized in Table 1.

Annealing treatments were also carried out on the cell containing a 20 nm thick ZnO layer. Since the as-prepared sample already showed large photovoltaic performances, due to the smaller ZnO thickness we could expect a more rapid dynamic of the defect healing. Therefore, softer annealing treatments were carried out in which the temperature was kept constant at 140 °C and the annealing time was increased progressively (cumulative annealing) up to 60 min. The J–V curves under illumination are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, increases in Jsc, Voc, PCE and FF values are observed upon annealing. The maximum PCE value of about 2.9% is obtained after 60 min of annealing (Table 2), which is significantly larger than the value of the reference device. The series resistance estimated in the J–V curves remained important in all cases. The cell containing the 20 nm ZnO layer issued from the 60 min annealing was subsequently heated at different temperatures (between 140 and 160 °C) for 15 min. During this annealing procedure, the cell parameters remained constant up to 155 °C, above which a slow decrease of the performance is noticed. By neglecting the role of the cumulative effect, this may let us think that the annealing at 160 °C during 15 min is somehow equivalent to the annealing at 140 °C during 60 min since between these two annealings the cell properties do not vary much. This points out that similar results can be obtained either by varying the annealing temperature or the annealing time.

The observed variation of the cell performances upon annealing can not be due to changes in the ZnO morphology and properties. Annealing treatments at temperatures lower than 180 °C of as-prepared samples (which are already annealed at 140 °C within the preparation process) were already shown to have no significant influence on the structural and electrical properties of ZnO layers. In order to confirm this hypothesis, cumulative annealings were carried out on a 150 nm thick ZnO layer deposited on a glass substrate. The sample, as prepared (without any annealing) and annealed at different temperatures (140, 160 and 180 °C) for 15 min, was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical transmission techniques. Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of the ZnO layer before and after annealing. All diffractograms show the expected ZnO(002) peak at about 34.42°, indicating a preferential orientation with the c-axis perpendicular to the glass substrate. A closer look shows however that some structural disorder (probably related to defects such as oxygen vacancies or Zn in interstitial positions) is obtained for as-prepared ZnO or ZnO annealed below 180 °C. Indeed, while the sample annealed at 180 °C presents the most compact structure with the smallest c lattice parameter (about 5.201 ± 0.005 Å, close to the value of 5.206 Å reported in ref. 15), the c parameter increases progressively upon decreasing the annealing temperature and reaches about 5.268 ± 0.005 Å for the as-prepared sample. This is also supported by the ZnO(002) peak width and intensity which slightly increases and decreases, respectively, when decreasing the annealing temperature. We may, however, expect that these defects do not affect the optical properties of the layer. Indeed, optical transmission measurements show for all samples identical transmission spectra (Fig. 4b), with no changes in the band gap or additional absorption edges related to structural defects. These measurements suggest very little changes of the ZnO properties following the annealing treatment between 140 and 180 °C. Another approach can be exploited by estimating the series resistance (RS), which is often used by considering the slope of the J–V curve in the forward current quadrant. In the case of significant influence on the structural and electrical properties of ZnO layers, the successive annealing processes should have led to improved active layer crystallinity and therefore reduced RS values (due to increased mobilities of the more crystalline component materials). In the J–V curves showed in Figs 2 and 3, the forward current behavior is similar no matter what the annealing conditions, which indicates no change of the RS values, and therefore no change of the ZnO properties. Thus, we can conclude that the improvements of the OPV cell performances are related mostly to the morphology changes in the organic active layer and not to the improvement of the quality of the adjacent electrodes.
Many authors reported a vertical phase segregation of the P3HT:PCBM composite film in which the electron acceptor material (PCBM) moves towards the cathode (often Al), while the electron donor material (P3HT) diffuses towards the anode (ITO/PEDOT:PSS). This seems also to occur in our case where a ZnO/Al cathode was used instead of pure Al. Although this segregation was evidenced by many analysis techniques such as HRTEM,AFM,VASE,SEM, or even optical microscopy, the precise mechanism driving this segregation is not well understood. Most authors agree, however, that the segregation is related to the surface energy of the components, associated with the large mobilities that P3HT and PCBM acquire while increasing the temperature. Upon annealing, P3HT crystallizes (this is reported to start just above 100 °C) to form lamellar structures and PCBM diffuses preferentially along the disordered low-density regions between the P3HT crystallites. This segregation, which gives rise to a vertical concentration gradient of the two components inside the active layer, is beneficial for the performances of the device. Such a vertical concentration gradient, combined with the existence of rich-fullerene and rich-polymer nanometric size domains inside the core of the active layer, allows i) an efficient exciton dissociation and ii) an efficient charge transport associated with a strong electrode selectivity. Thus, annealing may improve the contact between P3HT:PCBM and ZnO, and the molecular ordering of P3HT:PCBM near the interface with ZnO. Indeed, it can be expected that the sputtering deposition of ZnO introduces disorder in the near-surface region of the active layer by increasing the amorphous fraction of P3HT or by mixing both polymer and fullerene components. These damages seem to be more important when the thickness of the ZnO layer is increased. However, the annealing step within the standard preparation procedure (140 °C for 15 min) is probably not enough to heal these defects. Further annealings, which could also induce a beneficial segregation of P3HT and PCBM towards the electrodes, are needed to restore and improve the performances of the OPV cells.
The outcome of this process is sketched in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a illustrates the disorder that can be induced at the top surface region of the P3HT:PCBM blend by ZnO sputtering deposition. Fig. 5b describes the possible ordering of P3HT and diffusion of PCBM in the same sample region, as a consequence of the annealing treatment. Further annealing is supposed to form PCBM aggregates at the ZnO interface, as shown in Fig. 5c. The insets in Fig. 5 highlight the formation of a PCBM-rich region at the active layer/ZnO interface. Meanwhile, an enhanced concentration of aligned donor P3HT is expected at the active layer/PEDOT:PSS interface.
In order to support our model and the strong changes that occur in the P3HT:PCBM active layer upon annealing, XRD measurements of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO structures integrating a 100 nm thick ZnO layer, as-prepared and subsequently annealed at 140, 160 and 180 °C for 15 min, are reported in Fig. 6a. The diffraction patterns show peaks corresponding to ITO, ZnO and P3HT. If the peaks of ITO and ZnO show no changes in all cases (in agreement also with the results reported in Fig. 4), the peaks corresponding to P3HT [(100) at 5.4° and (200) at 10.8°] change upon annealing. The positions of these peaks suggest a lattice spacing of 1.64 nm, which corresponds to the distance between the main chains of P3HT. These results suggest that the orientation of the P3HT chains is, at least partly, parallel to the growth direction. Although the positions of the P3HT peaks remain unchanged, their intensity increases with the annealing temperature up to 160 °C. This indicates an improved order of the P3HT side chain, and therefore an important dynamic of the polymer especially after annealing at 160 °C. To highlight these annealing effects on the growth and organization of the P3HT crystallites in the near interface with ZnO, we compared the X-ray diffraction peaks of P3HT (100) and (200) obtained with the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO (0, 20, 100 nm) samples annealed at 140 °C for 15 min and the 100 nm-thick ZnO sample annealed at 160 °C for 15 min. These diffractograms are presented in Fig. 6b. We observe no difference between the X-ray peaks intensities of P3HT (100) with a 20 nm-thick ZnO film and without ZnO, which suggests a similar crystallization between the main chains of P3HT that occurs at the ZnO interface after or without sputtering damage. When the ZnO layer is 100 nm thick, the XRD peak intensity of P3HT (100) is significantly reduced, suggesting the disorder of the P3HT chains that occurs at the ZnO interface. An ordering of the P3HT chains, similar to that observed in the samples with a 20 nm thick ZnO layer and without ZnO, can be evidenced immediately after the annealing process at 160 °C. These results show that, according to the sputtering process time, a further annealing step is required to restore the P3HT crystallite properties as they were without a sputtering process (or after a short one).
Further details on the morphology and dynamic of the P3HT:PCBM layer with the annealing temperature were obtained by optical microscopy. In this sense a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO (25 nm) structure was subsequently heated at 140, 150, 160, 170 and 180 °C for 15 min. In order to highlight also the influence of the ZnO sputtering process on the morphology change of the active layer and on the thermal stability of the active layer, we compared these effects with those recorded on a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM structure (without interfacial sputtered ZnO). The images collected in the two cases using a CCD camera are reported in Fig. 7. After annealing at 140 °C for 15 min, no obvious change of the surface morphology was observed in both cases (with and without ZnO, Figs 7a and b). Only the existing defects, used here as reference points to locate the same observation area, are noticed. Upon annealing at 150 °C, some elliptical aggregates appear at the P3HT:PCBM surface for the sample without the sputtered interfacial ZnO (Fig. 7d). Based on previous studies, these features can be attributed to PCBM that segregates from the P3HT:PCBM layer and diffuses towards the surface. This phenomenon intensifies at higher temperatures where the density and size of aggregates increase. In the case of the structure integrating the ZnO layer, the segregation and diffusion of PCBM towards the surface starts at 160 °C (Fig. 7e) and, as in the previous case, is amplified at higher annealing temperature. This delay may be caused by the damage induced in the absorber layer during the sputtering deposition of ZnO. The annealing at 160 °C of the OPV cell is probably needed to heal the sputtering defects and reorder the P3HT chains before the vertical phase segregation of P3HT:PCBM occurs (demixing of amorphous P3HT/PCBM domains may enhance the PCBM mobility). Finally, it is also interesting to note that the PCBM aggregates in the sample capped with ZnO have different shapes (circular instead of elliptical) and sizes (less spread at the surface) with respect to the one observed for the structure without ZnO. In order to have a close look at the PCBM aggregates in the two cases and to confirm that these aggregates are indeed composed of PCBM, scanning electron microscopy observations were carried out on the samples annealed at 180 °C.

Fig. 8 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples with and without ZnO, annealed at 180 °C. The images were recorded in “composition” mode to enhance the Z-number contrast. For both samples, the aggregates appear with a dark contrast suggesting a large amount of small Z elements. This suggests a large amount of carbon (i.e. of PCBM) in these aggregates. EDX analyses (not shown here) carried out in the middle of the aggregates evidenced a strong C line but almost no trace of S characteristic of P3HT. In the case of the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM sample, the elliptical aggregate shape is confirmed and a darker contrast is observed in the middle and the border of the aggregates. This let us think that the thickness of the PCBM aggregates is larger in these regions. It appears therefore that PCBM diffuses towards the surface and crystallizes from a central nucleation center in the middle of the aggregate. The aggregates are consequently wide and rather flat. The fact that their borders are irregular suggests that the aggregates are very probably polycrystalline. In contrast, in the case of the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO sample, the aggregates are of spherical shape, i.e. much less spread and much thicker in the middle than on the borders. It is interesting to point out that these PCBM aggregates form at the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface without breaking the ZnO layer. This can be clearly seen by the streaming shape contrast existing on the ZnO layer, which is a result of the active layer damage during the sputtering process of ZnO and which is also observed on the top of the aggregate [clearly seen on topographic contrast images—not shown here—and on the AFM images reported further in this paper). The fact that the PCBM aggregates appear at the interface between two layers (P3HT:PCBM and ZnO) may also explain why the aggregates are less spread with respect to the previous case and why they appear only at higher temperatures (160 instead of 150 °C) at the P3HT:PCBM surface.
Similar conclusions to the ones obtained by SEM observations were obtained by analyzing the same samples by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. Fig. 9 shows clearly the difference of morphologies for the samples capped or not with the 25 nm thick ZnO layer. When the ZnO layer is absent, the PCBM aggregates are indeed flat with a maximum peak-to-peak (PtP) height (corresponding to the center and the borders) of about 340 nm (Fig. 9d). For the structure integrating the ZnO layer, the aggregates are much higher reaching about 600 nm. It is also noteworthy to point out that the base rms roughness is much larger in the case of the sample with ZnO due to the damage of the active layer during sputtering.
In summary, we have reported on the influence of annealing on the performance improvement of conventional OPV cells integrating interfacial sputtered ZnO films. Annealing treatments play a crucial role in restoring and controlling the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM/ZnO interface. We showed also that this can be tuned by varying either the annealing time and/or temperature. The PCE is clearly larger after thermal annealing in devices containing a ZnO interfacial layer. Further, the PCE is greatly enhanced in devices with a ZnO interfacial layer compared to ZnO free devices. This underlines the importance of the ZnO interfacial layer for the photovoltaic performances of the devices.
