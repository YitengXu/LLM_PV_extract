Pentaaryl[60]fullerene derivatives, C60(C6H4Ph)5Me, C60(C6H4OPh)5Me, C60(C6H4nBu)5Me, Fe[C60(C6H4nBu)5]Cp, and Ru[C60(C6H4nBu)5]Cp have been used as acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction-type organic photovoltaic cells in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a donor material. High open-circuit voltages (up to 0.76 V) were obtained, which are attributed to the high LUMO of the penta(organo)[60]fullerenes. Scanning electron microscopic analyses of the cross-section of the devices indicated a homogeneous distribution of the donor and the acceptor compounds, which accounts for the moderate short-circuit current and photocurrent conversion efficiency (η = 1.08).

Organic photovoltaics have become the subject of intensive studies in industry and academia, with the aim of producing low-cost, low-weight, flexible solar cells. A combination of a light-absorbing electron donor such as a polythiophene and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative, typically a PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester) that possesses a 58π-electron conjugated system, has been widely examined for the production of such cells. Good contact between the donor and the acceptor domains through formation of an interpenetrating microscopic structure (bulk heterojunction, BHJ) is widely believed to be important to achieve ultrafast charge transfer (∼40 fs) as well as high power conversion efficiency (PCE, η). The high PCE of photovoltaic devices arises from three major factors, a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and a large fill factor (FF). Of these, Voc is considered to depend primarily on the intrinsic electronic properties of the donor and acceptor components; that is, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor. Therefore, several attempts to increase Voc through structural modification of the π-conjugated donor (e.g., polythiophenes) and of the fullerene acceptor (e.g., modification of PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester)) have been reported. A recent report showed that as the LUMO level of the PCBM congeners is raised, the Voc value indeed increases. However, the LUMO control through side chain modification of PCBM (a 58π-electron system) is inherently limited in scope. We decided to investigate the acceptor properties of penta(organo)[60]fullerenes (hereafter abbreviated to penta-adducts), 50π-electron fullerenes that have a LUMO level inherently higher than that of PCBM because of the contracted π-system. In addition, the syntheses of these compounds are very simple and high-yielding, and provide a wide variety of structures, including organometallic derivatives. After submission of this article, Tolbert, Schwartz and Rubinet al. tested the penta-adducts as acceptor materials in the polymer OPV cells and reported some useful implications.

Some potentially attractive features of the penta-adducts are given below. First, the conically shaped penta-organofullerenes are prone to form ordered structures in the solid state through polar columnar or lamellar assemblies. This may assist charge transportation in the solid state. We have thus chosen to study penta(organo)[60]fullerenes 1–6 that have the penta-organo structure in common while having some specific structural feature on the organic addends (e.g., long alkyl chains) and on the fullerene core (e.g., a metal atom) (Fig. 1).
Second, the penta-adducts can be converted into a variety of metal η5-cyclopentadienide complexes. Metal complexation may significantly change the electronic properties of the fullerene, as is known for an iron derivative in which photoinduced charge transfer from the metal atom to the fullerene core is known to take place readily. In addition, metal complexes may have higher dipolar or quadrupolar moments than the parent organic analogues, and may form ordered structures. We examine buckyferrocene and buckyruthenocene, 7 and 8, which are stable enough to be used for OPV devices (Fig. 1). Third, a wide structural variety of organic parts can be added to the penta-adducts, as illustrated by the compounds in Fig. 1. Finally, the high yield and scalability are desirable features of the synthesis of these compounds.
Herein we describe the basic physical data of the new fullerene derivatives (e.g., ionization potentials and LUMO levels) of the penta-adducts, and then report on the performance of the OPV devices assembled by the use of the organic and organometallic penta-adducts and a polythiophene hole transporter P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)). Most of these fullerenes indeed exhibited much higher Voc values than PCBM, whereas the Jsc and overall PCE did not improve. Scanning electron microscopic analyses of the cross-section of the devices indicated the penta-adduct-based devices form much more homogeneous phase-separated structures than the PCBM-based device. We consider that this homogeneity is responsible for the modest charge transport ability of the overall system.

Electron affinities and ionization potentials are the experimental measures of the LUMO and HOMO energies. Although these values in the solid state are the data most relevant to the design and analysis of OPV devices, such data have not been readily available. We thus estimated the LUMO levels of the fullerenes by measurements of cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution phase. As for HOMO energy, we have been able to examine the ionization potential of a thin film of the fullerenes with the aid of a relatively new experimental method – photoemission yield spectroscopy (PYS), which allows one to quickly determine the ionization potentials of molecules as films. The PYS measurements can be performed under vacuum conditions, and this is a merit of this method because the photoexcited fullerene samples react readily with molecular oxygen. The accuracy of the PYS measurements against ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was recently reported. In our hands the ionization potential of [60]fullerene was 6.25 eV, which is comparable to the UPS value of 6.20 eV.

We first describe the synthesis of the compounds. The parent compound 1, which has a hydrogen atom attached to the fullerene core (denoted as a protio-compound), is unstable because the hydrogen atom is both reductively and oxidatively labile. To increase the chemical and electrochemical stability, we replaced the hydrogen atom by a methyl group and used the fullerenes 2–6 for the present study. Similarly, replacement by an iron and a ruthenium atom generated the fullerenes 7 and 8.
The new compounds 6–8 were synthesized by a reported method. The iron complex 7 was characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis (Fig. 2). The packing diagram of 7 shows a quasi-hexagonal columnar arrangement with antiparallel orientation. We think this structure is formed as a result of the intrinsic properties of the molecule, that is, the molecular polarity and the concave structure created by the five aryl groups.
The electrochemical properties of 6–8 as well as PCBM and P3HT were determined by cyclic voltammetry, and are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2. All cyclic voltammograms except for the protio-compound 1 showed reversible reduction waves because of the fullerene core. The first reduction potentials of the penta-adducts fall between −1.41 and −1.44 V (vs. Fc/Fc+), which is in the range of those reported for penta-adducts. These reduction potentials suggest that the LUMO of the penta-adducts are higher than those of PCBM (E1/2 = −1.00 V vs. Fc/Fc+). The iron complex 7 exhibited reversible oxidation behavior because of the ferrocene moiety.

The ionization potentials of the fullerene films were measured using photoemission yield spectroscopy (PYS). In this new method, the electric current required to neutralize the sample molecules ionized by UV–VUV (vacuum ultra-violet) irradiation is measured. The PYS measurements can be performed under vacuum conditions, and this is a merit of this method because the photoexcited fullerene samples react readily with molecular oxygen. The ionization potentials of fullerenes 6–8 were found to be higher than those of PCBM. Among fullerene derivatives 6–8, the ionization potential of the buckyferrocene 7 was the highest. We consider that this is because of the presence of the iron(II) atom, which is known to quickly donate an electron to the excited state of the fullerene core.
Based on the LUMO levels estimated by CV and the HOMO levels estimated by PYS (Table 1), an energy diagram for the fullerenes and P3HT was obtained (Fig. 3). As expected from the contracted π-system, LUMO levels of the penta-adducts 6–8 are much higher than those of PCBM, but are slightly lower than those of P3HT. If we are to expect smooth electron transfer from excited P3HT, the LUMO levels of 6–8 are at the highest possible limit. The HOMO levels (estimated by PYS) do not appear to have any direct correlation to the LUMO level (estimated by CV).
Solubility in organic solvents is a non-trivial parameter in the fabrication of thin-film devices by a solution process. The use of penta-adducts is particularly beneficial because we can control the solubility with the aid of the five organic groups. Thus, all the penta-adducts in Fig. 1 are soluble in toluene, chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon disulfide and various other solvents. The solubilities of fullerenes 6–8 are higher than 3 wt% in CB. This level of solubility is enough to perform solution processing, for instance, spin-coating of PCBM in CB at a concentration of 0.7 wt% to 2.7 wt% was reported in the literature.

With the estimated HOMO/LUMO data in hand, we fabricated photovoltaic cells to study the correlation between material properties and device characteristics. We employed the popular BHJ device structure relying on P3HT and PCBM, and simply replaced PCBM with the penta-adducts. The structure is thus denoted as indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:penta-adducts/Al (see Fig. S1). We used equimolar amounts of the donor and the acceptor. The P3HT/fullerene active layer formed by spin-coating of the donor/acceptor solution on the PEDOT:PSS layer was visually uniform and homogeneous. Each device was annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 5 min. The photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 2 and the current–voltage (J–V) curves under AM1.5G illumination in Fig. 4a.

The J–V curves of the P3HT:penta-adduct devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the IPCE spectra in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c illustrates a very clear correlation between the LUMO levels and the Voc values for the devices made from the conically shaped penta-adducts 2, 3, and 6–8 (marked with a circle) as compared with the device based on PCBM. Note that the structures of the compounds 4 and 5 showing very low Voc are special, in that 4 bears as many as ten non-conducting dodecyl chains, and that molecules of 5 are not conical and cannot stack with each other.
The maximum Voc of 0.76 V was obtained when the penta(phenoxyphenyl) derivative 3 was used as an acceptor (entry 3). Following an argument regarding substituted PCMB derivatives, we conclude that the large Voc values of the penta-adducts are due to the high LUMO levels of these molecules. However, the penta-adducts were less efficient overall than PCBM (η = 2.30%), because of lower Jsc values than that of PCBM (8.6 mA/cm2). The microscopic study discussed below provides a clue to understand this issue.
The factor affecting Jsc is the charge mobility of the device, which in turn depends on the nano- to microscopic supramolecular structures of the film. To address these issues, we analyzed the cross-section of the devices by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 5).
The SEM images of the device based on the P3HT:penta-adduct 6 showed a homogeneous distribution of nano-sized aggregates (which we assume to be P3HT; diameter: 10–20 nm) in the active layer (Fig. 5a). Clearly, this is not an ideal structural feature required for the BHJ devices. In contrast, the P3HT:PCBM device displayed a layered distribution of the aggregates, which agglomerate (layer b, Fig. 5b) dominantly in the bottom region next to the PEDOT:PSS layer (layer a). Assuming this assignment to be correct, we can assign the top layer c as a layer of PCBM, and we then can attribute the higher Jsc of the PCBM devices to the closer-to-ideal ITO (bottom)–donor/Al (top)–acceptor distribution. Being able to stack together, the penta-adducts are often more prone to crystallize than common fullerene derivatives that tend to form amorphous solids. We thus consider that the penta-adducts tend to form many crystal seeds and form the homogeneous morphology. The SEM images of the devices derived from the penta-adducts 7 and 8 also showed homogeneous morphology, as shown in the ESI.
There is a complete lack of information on the correlation between the molecular structure and the bulk morphology of a mixture of compounds such the P3HT/fullerene mixed phase discussed above. It is therefore impossible to discuss any details of the structure–activity relationship for the penta-addition products. Nonetheless, we briefly discuss the issue of supramolecular structure vs. device performance. Among the penta-adducts examined, the molecules 2, 3 and 4, which have well-defined conical shapes, have a priori a larger propensity to form a columnar stacking structure than others entirely incapable of forming stacked structures (such as 5, η = 0.12%). Among 2–4, the PCE and Jsc of the devices based on the penta-adduct 3 (η = 1.08%, Jsc = 2.8 mA/cm2) are much higher than that of the device based on 2 (η = 0.45%, Jsc = 1.9 mA/cm2). One possible reason for the higher device performance of 3 than 2 is the deeper (through the presence of the oxygen linkage between the two phenyl groups) shuttlecock structure, which may cause better molecular organization. This however may cause the formation of a homogeneous bulk phase and may lower the device performance (see above).
The conical molecule 4, which is known to form a columnar liquid crystalline phase, showed poor performance (η = 0.02%) with the standard platform optimized for the P3HT:PCBM devices. We attribute this unexpectedly low efficiency to the presence of excessively large alkyl groups (i.e., ten of the dodecyl chains accounting for 120 non-conducting carbon atoms as opposed to the conducting 60-atom fullerene core). The protio-compound 1 showed poor performance, likely because of its crystallinity being too high, making the film macroscopically crystalline. The instability of 1 under redox conditions is another possible reason for the poor performance.
We next focused on the effect of adding an iron or ruthenium atom to the cyclopentadiene part on the fullerene (7 and 8). The compound 8 showed much the same Voc value as compared with their methylated congener 6 (Table 2). Fig. 4b shows the IPCE spectra of the devices P3HT:penta-adducts 3 and 6–8. All spectra except that of the buckyferrocene 7 showed the same intensity profile characterized by the small peak at ca. 425 nm, and this profile reflects the absorption spectra of the mixture of P3HT and the fullerene derivatives as expected (e.g., see Fig. 6 for 6, and Fig. S3 for 6–8). Although the exact reason for the uniqueness of the IPCE curve of 7 is unclear at this time, one may note that the buckyferrocene molecules undergo a rapid self-quenching process because of the quick intramolecular electron transfer from the iron atom to the excited fullerene moiety and the subsequent back-electron transfer.
Finally, we describe the annealing effect of the OPV device of the penta-adducts 6–8. It is known that in P3HT-based OPV devices the performance increases with annealing. This is attributed to the π–π interaction of P3HT, which is considered to be responsible for a shoulder peak at 600 nm in the UV–vis absorption spectra. While the device with P3HT:PCBM was found to show this 600 nm peak only after annealing (Fig. 6b), the device with the penta-adduct 6 exhibited this peak before annealing (Fig. 6a). The implication is that the penta-adducts 6 assisted the stacking of P3HT. In this respect, one may speculate that the improvement of the OPV performance of the device of 6 through annealing at 150 °C (η = 0.42% before annealing, 0.91% after annealing) is because of reorganization of the solid-state structure of the penta-adduct domain. Clearly, this speculation requires confirmation by further experimentation.

We have shown that the penta(organo)[60]fullerenes possessing a higher LUMO level than PCBM act as acceptor materials and show higher Voc values for the bulk heterojunction cells when combined with P3HT as a donor material. The Voc was previously considered to improve as the gap between the HOMO level of donor and the LUMO level of the fullerenes increased, and the present data provides strong experimental support to this hypothesis. The overall efficiency of the devices, however, had a maximum of 1.1%, which is close to the maximum of 1.5% mentioned in a recent paper. This is due to the modest Jsc values. The SEM analyses of the cross section of the devices indicated that the devices made from the organofullerenes 6, buckyferrocene 7 and buckyruthenocene 8 form a homogeneous BHJ active layer as opposed to the phase-separated active layer made from PCBM. We can ascribe the modest Jsc to such homogeneous morphology, and perhaps this homogeneity to the high propensity of the penta-adduct molecules to crystallize because of their shuttle-like structure. Nonetheless, we expect that the morphology control should be possible, since immense flexibility is available in the design of the penta(organo)[60]fullerenes. To achieve this goal, further studies on the correlation of the molecular structures and the solid-state structures will be necessary.


P3HT was purchased from Aldrich, and PCBM and fullerenes 2 and 3 were purchased from Frontier Carbon Corporation. The bulk heterojunction cells were fabricated on patterned ITO-coated glass substrates. The substrate was ultrasonically cleaned using surfactant, rinsed in deionized water and finalized with UV-ozone treatment. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron AI 4083 from H.C. Starck) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass with a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 120 °C in ambient atmosphere and annealed for 3 min at 180 °C in a glovebox filled with nitrogen. Blended solutions of P3HT:fullerenes (thiophene unit:fullerenes 1:0.15 molar ratio) in chlorobenzene (1.6 wt%) were prepared and spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. Then, the Al electrode was evaporated through a shadow mask with an active area of 4 mm2. The photovoltaic cells were then encapsulated with backing glass using UV-curable resin under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the cells were annealed on a hotplate at 150 °C for 5 min.

The encapsulated cells were subject to J–V measurement both in the dark and under irradiation. The J–V characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) controlled by a computer. The photocurrent was measured under AM1.5 solar illuminator (Sumitomo Heavy Industries Advanced Machinery) with 100 mW/cm2 (1 sun). For the IPCE measurement, constant power mode was employed using monochromatized photon form both halogen and mercury lamps.
Photoemission yield spectroscopy (PYS) was measured using PCR-101 (Sumitomo Heavy Industries Advanced Machinery). Fullerene derivatives were spin-coated onto ITO substrates and then the substrates were baked on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min under nitrogen atmosphere. After that, they were set in a chamber of PCR-101 as soon as possible to avoid their oxidation.

SEM images were taken using a Carl Zeiss Ultra55 SEM instrument. For the observation, Pt/Pd (particle size: ca. 1.5 nm) was evaporated onto the sample to prevent charging of the sample. The sample was prepared by spin-coating on the ITO substrate that PEDOT:PSS layer was coated on. A chlorobenzene solution was used for the spin-coating.
Electrochemical measurements were performed using a Hokuto HZ-5000 voltammetric analyzer. A glassy-carbon electrode was used as the working electrode. The counter electrode was a platinum coil, and the reference electrode was a Ag/Ag+ electrode. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. All half-wave potentials are given as E1/2 = (Epc + Epa)/2, where Epc and Epa are the cathodic and anodic peak potentials, respectively. The potentials were corrected against ferrocene/ferrocenium.

Absorption spectra of the spin-coating films were measured using V-570 (JASCO Corporation). Each film was prepared by spin-coating on the ITO substrate that PEDOT:PSS layer was coated on. A chlorobenzene solution was used for spin-coating of the P3HT:fullerene and the fullerene layers.

Microcrystalline [60]fullerene (4.00 g, 5.55 mmol) was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (180 mL), and the solution was degassed and flushed with nitrogen. To a suspension of copper(I) bromide–dimethyl sulfide complex (17.1 g, 83.3 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (94 mL) was slowly added a tetrahydrofuran solution of n-butylphenylmagnesium bromide (1.03 M, 80.8 mL, 83.4 mmol) at 0 °C, and after stirring for 15 min then added the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of [60]fullerene at once. After stirring for 2 h at 25 °C, saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (10 mL) was added to the reaction mixture. Volatile materials were removed under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) at room temperature. The concentrated mixture was diluted with degassed toluene and filtered through a pad of silica gel with toluene as eluent. The filtrate was collected and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (10 mmHg) at 40 °C. To remove 1,2-dichlorobenzene, the bath temperature was warmed to 80 °C until a solid just began to appear on the inside wall of the flask. Degassed methanol was added to obtain a precipitate, which was collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel and dried under reduced pressure (1 mmHg).

C60(C6H4nBu)5H (1.00 g, 0.718 mmol) was dissolved in 150 mL of degassed dry THF, followed by the addition of 0.790 mL of 1.0 M t-BuOK in THF (0.790 mL). After stirring at room temperature for 15 min, 0.400 mL of iodomethane (2.82 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The solvent of the mixture was removed under reduced pressure (10 mmHg). The remaining solid was dissolved in carbon disulfide, and subjected into silica gel column chromatography (eluent: carbon disulfide–n-hexane = 1:2).

To a solution of C60(C6H4nBu)5H (500 mg, 0.359 mmol) in THF (75 mL) was added a solution of t-BuOK (0.395 mmol, 1.1 eq) in THF (0.395 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min. To the resulting blackish solution, [RuCp(CH3CN)3]PF6 (187 mg, 0.431 mmol, 1.2 eq) was added directly. After stirring for 15 min, volatile solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in toluene, and the solution was filtered through a pad of silica gel to remove insoluble side products. The filtrate was purified by silica gel chromatography with carbon disulfide–n-hexane = 1:2 as eluent. To the fractions of the product were added ethanol to precipitate the product, which was collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel. Drying the product under reduced pressure (1 mmHg), gave the title compound as an orange solid in 49% overall yield. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.97 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 15H, CH3), 1.37–1.42 (m, 10H, CH2), 1.63–1.66 (m, 10H, CH2), 2.66 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 10H, CH2), 3.55 (s, 5H, C5H5), 7.01 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 10H, C6H4), 7.60 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 10H, C6H4). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): δ 13.98 (5C, C4H9), 22.24 (5C, C4H9), 33.66 (5C, C4H9), 35.22 (5C, C4H9), 58.14 (5C, C60(sp3)), 77.37 (5C, Cp), 99.94 (5C, C60(Cp)), 127.38 (10C, C6H4), 129.01 (10C, C6H4), 141.39 (5C, C6H4), 142.12 (5C, C6H4), 143.29 (10C, C60(sp2)), 144.48 (10C, C60(sp2)), 147.53 (5C, C60(sp2)), 148.24 (10C, C60(sp2)), 148.53 (5C, C60(sp2)), 152.83 (10C, C60(sp2)).
