In this work, a comparative degradation analysis of high-efficiency inverted organic solar cells (iOSCs) is presented, with the PTB7-Th:PC70BM blend as the active layer and hole transport layers (HTLs), of V2O5, MoO3 and their stacks. Five groups of iOSCs, were fabricated with V2O5 (3 nm), V2O5/MoO3 (3/1 nm), V2O5/MoO3 (3/2 nm), V2O5/MoO3 (3/5 nm) and MoO3 (10 nm), respectively. The performance parameters obtained from illuminated J–V curves of the devices were analyzed. The long-term operational stability of encapsulated iOSCs is studied following the ISOS-D1 protocols for 19600 h. The maximum PCE obtained using stacks of V2O5/MoO3 (3/1 nm) is 10.58%. The best stability was obtained for devices using 10 nm MoO3 as the HTL, for which after 19600 h, the PCE reduced to 51%. The cell using 3 nm V2O5 degraded to 50% of its initial PCE (T50) after only 775 hours. The use of stacks of V2O5/MoO3 (3/1 nm), V2O5/MoO3(3/2 nm), V2O5/MoO3 (3/5 nm), increased the long-term stability of iOSCs, with T50 values equal to 3140 h, 4865 h, and 6808 h, respectively. Our study provides the details of the causes of the differences in behavior observed for the different materials used as HTLs. Although the physical degradation mechanism seems to be the same, the intensity is lower as the MoO3 thickness increases, which acts as a diffusion barrier reducing the diffusion rate of O2 and H2O toward the active layer. The impedance spectroscopy measurements confirm that, in this study, the degradation of the active layer is the main cause of decrease in performance of the device.

In the last few years, Organic Solar Cells (OSCs) have attracted attention due to their light weight, low-cost, and the possibility for large-scale preparation on flexible substrates, using roll-to-roll fabrication. OSCs with an inverted structure (iOSCs) based on the polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as an active layer, have shown to be a better alternative, compared to conventional OSCs. Intensive efforts have also been focused on the research and development of new polymeric materials with low bandgaps, while a diversity of materials and their combinations have been studied as selective anode and cathode layers to improve energy conversion efficiency (PCE) and the stability of iOSCs. This has allowed organic solar cells to be used in their first commercial applications. Recently, power conversion efficiencies as high as 18%, for single-junction OSCs, have been reported. However, despite these high PCE values, the stability of the electrical performance parameters of the OSCs continues to be their major limitation for commercial applications.

Charge transport layers, electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs) play a key role in both, enhancing PCE and increasing long-term stability of OSCs.
Materials such as poly [(9,9-bis (30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiOx) have been studied as ETLs, comparing their effect on cell performance, stability and lifetime.
Several metal oxides such as molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), nickel oxide (NiO) or tungsten trioxide (WO3) have been studied as HTL, due to their electronic properties for charge injection and extraction in organic electronic devices.
In this work, the effect of using V2O5, MoO3, and their stacks, as HTLs on both iOSC performance and stability is studied and compared.
All iOSCs were fabricated using a blend of {poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] and (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl} (PC70BM) as the active layer. As ETL, the PFN material was used in all fabricated iOSCs. Five different HTLs were studied. Type I consisted of a V2O5 layer, 3 nm thick, Types II, III and IV consisted of a stack of 3 nm of V2O5, on top of which 1 nm, 2 nm, and 5 nm of MoO3 were deposited, respectively. Type V consisted of a MoO3 layer with 10 nm thickness. The thickness of each layer was measured by the spectroscopic ellipsometry technique.
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured for all organic solar cells in the dark and under illumination (AM 1.5G light conditions), from which the performance parameters were extracted. Immediately after the first measurement, the photovoltaic devices were encapsulated to study their degradation over time. The study was carried out by following the ISOS-D1 protocols until the devices reached 30% of their initial PCE (13700 h). For Type V cells, the degradation time was 19600 h.
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) characterization was done under illumination (AM 1.5G light conditions), at different bias voltages, to study the transport processes taking place in the cell. An equivalent circuit, consisting of three RC elements in series, was associated with each layer (ETL, active layer and HTL) of the iOSC and used for this purpose.

The inverted solar cell structure used in this study is shown in Fig. 1a.


Fig. 1b shows the energy levels for the different materials used in the iOSCs.

Fig. 2a shows the current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing iOSCs under light (1.5G spectrum, 100 mW cm−2) of Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV, and Type V iOSCs, respectively. Fig. 2b shows J–V curves under darkness for the all previously mentioned iOSCs.

Fig. 2c, left axis shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the different devices, while the right axis, shows the calculated JSC values of the devices, obtained by integrating the EQE spectra shown in the left axis.

Table 1 shows a summary of the device performance parameters after fabrication, such as short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE, before and after encapsulation), and both series and shunt resistances (RS and RSH) of the iOSCs as a function of the different configurations of the HTLs. The measurements were done under AM 1.5G illumination. For a reliable comparison, the average and standard deviation values were obtained from 12 devices of each analyzed iOSC group.

Type II cells, with the V2O5/MoO3 (1 nm) stack, showed the best performance, with highest PCE values of 10.58% and an average of 10.30 ± 0.24%. They also showed the highest JSC and FF values, with a JSC maximum of 18.4 mA cm−2 and average of 18.09 ± 0.30 mA cm−2, an FF maximum of 72.75% and an average of 72.27 ± 0.5%.
This behavior of JSC can be explained from what is observed in Fig. 2c, where all iOSC types exhibited a similar spectral shape from 300 nm to 800 nm. This is expected, because they have the same active layer. Small differences are detected in the wavelength region from 350 nm to 420 nm, where it is clear that Type II and III devices showed an increment in photon conversion efficiency, compared to Type I cells. Type IV cells also presented a slight increment, although somewhat smaller. In the wavelength region between 430 nm and 650 nm, a reduction in EQE is observed for Types III and IV devices compared to Type I cells, while Type II cells started with values above, but finished with values below, those observed for Type I cells. This slight differences in the EQE spectra can be associated with the configuration of the HTL. Devices with thinner MoO3 layers (1 and 2 nm) showed the highest EQE values of around 375 nm of wavelength. On the other hand, the EQE values were lower for devices with a thicker layer of MoO3 (5 nm) at the same wavelength. It is well known that the EQE relates the efficiency of absorption, separation, transport and collection of charge within the device. The slight increase in EQE values exhibited by the Type II and Type III iOSCs compared to Type I, can be attributed to a greater balance in the collection of charge carriers, which can be the result of a better HTL/Ag interface, thus leading to a better Ohmic contact at the anode. This is also reflected in the obtained RS values, which are smaller when the MoO3 is added on top of V2O5. This qualitatively justifies the slight increase and decrease in the JSC, respectively, as shown in Table 1.
From Fig. 2c, the calculated JSC values for Types I, II, III, and IV cells were found to be 18.09, 18.19, 17.80, and 17.58 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the extracted values from the measured J–V characteristics, by confirming that JSC is the predominant performance parameter on the behavior of PCE.
It has previously been observed that when the deposited film is too thin (<3 nm), the MoO3 coverage on the surface can be small. However, when the film thickness is further increased, the particles grow, forming an almost continuous film, which decrease the barrier height, producing an increase of PCE as indicated by Yoosuf, et al. and Matsushima et al. Thinner MoO3 layers (1 and 2 nm) may not guarantee a homogeneous surface coverage and for this reason the behavior of the HTL is dominated by the underlying 3 nm thick V2O5 layer. In this sense, a slight increase in JSC is observed due to the probable tunneling of charge carriers through a very thin MoO3 layer.
The observed behavior of JSC and FF for all cells is also consistent with their behavior of PCE.
On the other hand, iOSCs with 10 nm of MoO3 (Type V), showed the lowest performance parameters with a PCE maximum of 9.06% and an average of 8.95 ± 0.09%. The maximum JSC obtained was 17.40 mA cm−2, and its average value was 17.01 ± 0.32 mA cm−2. The maximum FF was 69.30% and its average value was 68.90 ± 0.30%.
Regarding VOC, the higher average values (of around 0.79 V) were obtained for Type III devices (V2O5/MoO3: 3/2 nm). Interestingly, all the devices with the stack layer V2O5/MoO3 show higher VOC values than that of a device with single V2O5 or MoO3. However, iOSCs with a single MoO3 layer (Type V) exhibited the lowest VOC value.

A long-term degradation analysis was carried out for encapsulated devices of the five different types of iOSCs. The encapsulated devices were left under ambient conditions (22 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5% RH) after fabrication, following the ISOS-D1 protocols. All the devices were encapsulated using a top glass sealed to the bottom glass with an adhesive (ELC-4908 UV light curing).

Since in this work, the ETL and active layer materials are identical for all devices, the difference in the degradation trend observed can only be attributed to the difference in the behavior of the HTL.
The normalized performance parameters, JSC, VOC, FF and PCE, for Types I, II, III, IV and V, are depicted in Fig. 3a, b, c and d, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the experimental (symbols) and fitted (lines) degradation behavior over time of the normalized PCE for the five groups (Types I, II, III, IV and V). A fast initial decay followed by a slower decay, is modeled by the superposition of two exponential functions with different time constants as was previously reported.
(1)
where PCE (0) is the relative initial PCE at
t = 0 h. A1 and A2 are the degradation power factors, T1 and T2 are the time constants degradation, and b is the value at which it tends to stabilize over time.

It is reported that the degradation mechanisms represented by the first and second time constants (T1 and T2) are due to diffusion of water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) toward the active layer of the photovoltaic device, respectively. In this sense, if the T1 and T2 values are high, this means that the solar cells degrade slowly, and their performance parameters also slowly decrease over time. Table 2 shows a summary of the extracted parameters from the modeled PCE for the five groups of iOSCs by eqn (1). The slowest degradation is observed for Type V cells with the highest T1 and T2, 4900 h and 12500 h, respectively while the fastest degradation is shown by Type I cells with the lowest values of T1 and T2, 70 h and 2100 h, respectively. This suggests that the effect of the MoO3 layer becomes determinant in the stability of the iOSCs. As the thickness of MoO3 increases, higher values of T1, T2 and b are observed. In this sense, the addition of a thin layer of MoO3 on top of the V2O5 layer (Types II, III and IV) makes, undoubtedly, the photovoltaic cells more stable over time. Nevertheless, the best stability was shown for devices using only 10 nm of MoO3 as a HTL (Type V). 80% of its initial PCE is reached after 2556 h (T80). Moreover, after 13752 h, its PCE only reached 55% of its initial value and after 19600 h, 51%. Table 3 shows the times at which the PCE reached 80%, 50%, and 30% (T80, T50 and T30, according ISOS-D1, respectively) of its initial value for each type of device.

We can suggest that the degradation mechanism of the devices for T1 and T2 is due to the chemical reaction of materials and oxygen, respectively. After a period, the oxygen present in the encapsulating material can become active and reach the device, causing the degradation process to occur faster and have more influence. This behavior indicates that, the diffusion rate of the reactive species is high in devices with only V2O5, and consequently the PCE degradation is very fast. On the other hand, the degradation rate is reduced in devices with the stack V2O5/MoO3. Although the physical degradation mechanism may be the same, the intensity is decreases as the MoO3 thickness increases, which seems to act as a diffusion barrier, preventing, or lowering the diffusion rate of O2, H2O and Ag toward the active layer. There are some studies regarding the degradation mechanism of OSCs through different pathways. Norman et al. developed a technique to study the degradation of organic solar cells, which makes it possible to map the oxygen/water diffusion process into OPV devices by detecting the reaction products. This is carried out by exposing OPV devices to isotopically labeled oxygen (18O2) or isotopically labeled water (H218O) while either storing in the dark or under illumination using a subsequent time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) analysis. It was found that oxygen and water diffuse through the outer electrode (counter electrode to ITO). Using TOF-SIMS methodologies, Krebs et al. have demonstrated that the oxygen was diffused into the Al electrode through Al grains and microscopic holes on the Al film. Once inside the devices, oxygen was continually diffused in the lateral and vertical plane until the counter electrode was reached. Another prominent degradation pathway was found to be the diffusion of electrode materials into the devices. Using XPS depth profiling, Greenbank et al. demonstrated that inter-diffusion of the HTL and metallic contact occurs in the iOSCs, leading to Voc loss via charge trap formation due to an increased trap-mediated recombination rate. Chambon et al. performed Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and Auger Electron Spectrometry (AES) measurements, in order to detect elemental diffusion in the different layers of the OPV devices. The results showed a diffusion of silver atoms in the HTL and active layer.
The rapid burn-in decay typical of the photovoltaic devices was observed for all cells during the first 84 h. Greenbank et al. pointed out that diffusion between metal oxide HTL and Ag top electrode seems to play an important role in this initial degradation of the performance parameters of the cells.
During this initial burn-in, Type I cell PCE reduced to 75%, Type II and Type III PCEs reduced to 89%, and while for Type IV and Type V the PCE decayed only to 95% and 97%, respectively.
The current density degradation is shown in Fig. 3b. All the device types presented a small increase of JSC during the first 800 h. Afterwards, the JSC of Type I cells reduced linearly, reaching 55% of its initial value after 13700 h. For cell Types II, III and IV, the JSC remains constant until around 11000 h, after which it starts to decay more rapidly, reaching 80%, 77% and 62% of its value, respectively. The JSC for Type V cells showed very small variations over time, remaining above 97% after 13700 h and 92% after 19600 h.
The behavior in JSC stability can be attributed to a phase separation of the donor and acceptor domains, which reduces the chances that charge carriers are collected in the electrodes, leads to a decrease of JSC.

Fig. 3c shows the variation of FF with time, which exhibited a similar variation as PCE. All devices presented an exponential FF decay for times shorter than 4220 h, where the FF of Type I cells decreased the fastest. At time values of above 4220 h, a linear decay was observed, reaching the normalized value between 26% and 40% for Types II, III and IV cells, and 54% and 53%, for Type V, after 13700 h and 19600 h, respectively. This slow FF decay over time is related to the variation of the series resistance (RS) and parallel resistance (RSh). Ideally, RS and RSh should be as low and as high as possible, respectively. This can be confirmed by observing the behavior of RS and RSh over time in Fig. 4a and b.

Fig. 3d shows the VOC behavior over time of all iOSC groups. It was observed that VOC is the most stable parameter over time. Type I iOSCs show the most pronounced decrease after 4200 h, remaining stable afterwards, at around 77%. The VOC decay rate for Type II, Type III and Type IV is slower, reaching 96%, 88% and 83%, respectively, after 13700 h. Notice that, the VOC of Type V cells presented a slight increase of 5% during the first 1000 h of operation, which can be associated with the slight increase observed in RSh. Then, it decreased slowly, remaining practically around 100% of its initial value after 19600 h. The slight increase in VOC can also be caused by a lower Langevin recombination rate, which decreases mobility. A higher charge carrier density and a more balanced charge distribution has also been reported to reduce the variation of VOC.
From J–V measurements over time the overall series resistance (RS) and the shunt resistance (RSh) were calculated and shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows the comparison of the normalized RS over time for the five types of iOSCs. It is observed that, RS increased with a linear dependence for all iOSC types. This suggests that the variation of RS does not depend on the MoO3 thickness in the stack (V2O5/MoO3), is determined by the V2O5 layer; see the curves with a similar trend for Types I, II, III and IV in Fig. 4a. This is confirmed by the behavior of RS against time, for Type V cells, which showed a variation of RS over time with a much smaller slope. RS increased from 2.95 to 57.78 Ω cm2 for Type I, from 2.49 to 59.16 Ω cm2 for Type II, from 1.99 to 37.13 Ω cm2 for Type III, and from 1.82 to 42.08 Ω cm2 for Type IV after 13700 h. For Type V, RS increased from 2.71 to 17.27 Ω cm2 after 19600 h.

Fig. 4b shows the comparison of the normalized RSh over time for the five types of iOSCs. As expected, a reduction of the RSh over time is observed; however, not all groups followed the same decay rate. RSh decreases showing a lower decay rate as the MoO3 thickness is increased for each type of device. The lowest RSh decay is observed for Type V cells, which decreased to 68% and 65% of the initial RSh value after 13700 h and 19600 h, respectively. For the rest of the devices, RSh decreased to values less than 35%, after 13700 h. The RSh decreased from 1711 to 337 Ω cm2 for Type I, from 1862 to 654 Ω cm2 for Type II, from 2833 to 778 Ω cm2 for Type III, from 1397 to 475 Ω cm2 for Type IV and from 2536 to 1672 Ω cm2 for Type V.
The increase of RS can be attributed to several factors such as the creation of an isolation layer between the active layer and the metallic contact. This barrier reduces the collection of charge carriers and it is associated with the creation of deep and shallow traps due to the interaction of O2 and H2O with the polymer of the active layer, as was reported in ref. 31, 39 and 52. On the other hand, the reduction of RSh can be related to the recombination of charge carriers near the donor/acceptor interface of the active layer. As mentioned above, the slow variation of RS and RSh over time, displayed by Type V cells, is reflected in the best stability observed of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE for these cells.
In order to analyze the effect on charge transport properties, of the different HTLs, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed on the different cells. Fig. 5a, b, d and e show the experimental and fitted Nyquist plots of the IS data for Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV iOSCs, respectively, at applied voltages of 0 V, 0.25 V, 0.79 V, and 1 V, under AM1.5 illumination. Nyquist plots show a semicircle for all applied voltages, which is the classical behavior of BHJ solar cells, associated with charge transfer at the electrode/active layer interface. One common feature observed is that the radii of the arcs decrease as the applied voltage increases, since the charge extraction layer becomes more efficient.
The experimental impedance spectra were fitted using an equivalent electrical circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 5a.
The series resistance (RS) is related to the ohmic contact resistance and wire effects, which are mostly related to the ITO layer. One of the RC circuits is related to the capacitance and resistance of the ETL, the second one to the bulk active layer and the third one to the HTL. RETL and CETL correspond to the PFN layer, RBulk and CBulk to the bulk active layer (PTB7-Th:PC70BM), and RHTL and CHTL to the HTL. The geometrical capacitance of each layer can be theoretically calculated to be Cg = εlayerε0A/L, where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric permittivity, εlayer is the relative dielectric permittivity of the layer, A is the device area and L is the layer thickness. Table 4 shows the calculated capacitance values for each layer in the structure.

The extracted resistance and capacitance values of the equivalent RC circuits for each iOSC type are plotted as a function of the applied bias voltage in Fig. 5c and f. Since the ETL and active layer materials are identical for all cells, the average, and the standard deviation for PFN and the bulk layers are also shown. As expected, the resistance reduces as the applied voltage increases. It is also noted that the dominant resistance is associated with the PFN layer and the dominant capacitance to the HTL. When the MoO3 layer was added, the resistance associated with the HTLs increased with the thickness of the MoO3 while the capacitance, on the contrary, reduced.

Fig. 6 shows the IS variation as the cells degrade. Fig. 6a and e show Nyquist plots for different degradation time (0 h, 118 h and 188 h), while Fig. 6b and d show Nyquist plots for 0 h, 118 h and 388 h. It is observed that the Nyquist plot diameter increases with degradation time. From Fig. 6c we noticed three regions for capacitance over time, corresponding to PFN, Bulk and HTL. The capacitance values over time of PFN and active layer shows a slight increase. On the other hand, the capacitance values over time of HTL shows a slight decrease. In Fig. 6f, the normalized values of all resistances are plotted. It is important to notice that although the active layer resistance for all cell types increased with time, the presence of a MoO3 layer in the HTL reduced its ratio of the increment. The thicker the MoO3 layer, the smaller the increment ratio. At the same time, the most important increment of the resistance among all cell layers, was observed for the active layer. That is, the degradation is mostly due to the degradation of the active layer and the MoO3 is the one providing best protection against degradation of the active layer. Fig. 6g, h and i show the normalized values of the time constant (Tau = R × C) over time for bulk, PFN and HTL, respectively. From the calculation of the Tau values over time for each layer, as expected, the greatest variation of Tau over time was presented for the active layer. It is important to notice that, although the Tau of the bulk for all cell types increased with time, the thicker the MoO3 layer in the HTL, the smaller the increment ratio of Tau (Fig. 6g).
Since the HTL is the upper buffer layer, located closer to the encapsulation material, the increase in stability when using MoO3 as HTL can be attributed to prevention of the diffusion of oxidizing agents toward the active layer. It may also protect the possible reaction of the Ag, with underlying layers.
The present work shows that after studying MoO3, V2O5 layer and their stacks as HTL, the use of 10 nm thick MoO3 provides the longest lifetime, with the PCE remaining over 50% of the initial PCE after 19600 h (about 2 years). However, the selection of an adequate V2O5/MoO3 stack as HTL provides a promising strategy in OPVs, since a longer lifetime can be obtained with a higher initial PCE value.

Indium thin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, with a nominal sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 and 220 nm thickness were purchased from PsiOTec Ltd. PTB7-Th and PFN materials were purchased from One-Material Inc. PC70BM (purity ≥ 99%, Mw of 1031 g mol−1) was purchased from Solenne BV. 1,8-Diiodooctane was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Vanadium oxide (V2O5) and molybdenum oxide (MoO3) materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Silver (Ag) wire (99.99%) was purchased from Testbourne Ltd.


The organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the inverted structure of ITO/PFN/PTB7-Th:PC70BM/HTL/Ag. PFN solution was prepared by dissolving the PFN material in methanol with a small amount of acetic acid (1.84 μl mL−1) as an additive. Afterwards, the solution was spin-coated on top of the pre-cleaned ITO substrate at 4000 rpm during 60 s, obtaining a thickness of 10 nm. The active layer was prepared by dissolving PTB7-Th and PC70BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (97:3% v/v) with the total concentration of 25 mg mL−1. The solution was then heated on a 40 °C hotplate and stirred for 18 h. Subsequently, the solution was left to age for 48 h. The active layer solution was spin-cast onto PFN at 750 rpm for 30 s to obtain a layer thickness of around 100 nm.

V2O5 and MoO3 layers, used as HTL or in the HTL stack were deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions (1.33 × 10−6 mbar). Finally, 100 nm of Ag was deposited for all cells. The effective area of the devices was 0.09 cm2. The devices were encapsulated using a top glass sealed under N2 to the bottom glass with the glue adhesive (ELC-4908 UV light curing).

The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements in the light and in the dark of the encapsulated iOSCs were performed at room temperature using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit and a solar simulator (Abet Technologies model 11000 class Type A, Xenon arc). The light intensity of the AM 1.5G spectra was calibrated by an NREL certified monocrystalline silicon photodiode at 100 mW cm−2.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the iOSCs were measured under a forward wavelength sweep direction from 300 nm to 800 nm using Lasing IPCE-DC model equipment.
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) analyses were performed under AM 1.5G using an HP-4192A impedance analyzer. Impedance measurements were done for four different DC applied voltages: 0, 0.25, 0.79, and 1 V, superimposing an AC signal of 20 mV amplitude, sweeping the frequency range between 5 Hz and 2 MHz.

In summary, inverted organic solar cells were fabricated using PTB7-Th:PC70BM as the active layer, PFN used as ETL, and five different HTLs were obtained. The stacks were Type I with 3 nm of V2O5, Type II, Type III and Type IV with stacks of V2O5/MoO3, in which the MoO3 layers of 1, 2 and 5 nm, respectively. Type V cells were only manufactured with MoO3 layer with thickness of 10 nm. The highest value for PCE was 10.58% for cells fabricated with V2O5/MoO3 (1 nm) as the HTL and the lowest 8.90% for 10 nm of MoO3 as the HTL. After encapsulation, following the ISOS-D1 protocols, the best stability was obtained for cells with 10 nm thickness of MoO3 as the HTL with a 50% decay (T50) of the PCE after 19600 h, while the least stability corresponded to cells with V2O5 as the HTL, with the same 50% decay after only 775 h. It is known that MoO3 is more stable than V2O5, but using the two materials in a stack, more stable devices were obtained. The cells with V2O5/MoO3 stacks, the T50 was equal to 3140 h, 4865 h, and 6808 h, for MoO3 of 1 nm, 2 nm, and 5 nm respectively, indicating that for the stack HTL, the thicker the MoO3 layer, the longer cell lifetime. The IS measurements confirmed that in this study the degradation of the active layer is the one determining the overall cell degradation. MoO3 is the one that provides the best protection acting as a diffusion barrier, preventing or lowering the diffusion rate of O2, H2O and Ag toward the active layer.
