Isomer-free fullerene bisadducts have been predicted to be high-performance acceptors for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. They can afford a higher open-circuit voltage compared with monoadducts because of the higher LUMO levels, and can also provide a higher short-circuit current and fill factor compared with the isomer mixture because of reduced energetic disorder. However, the application of isomer-free fullerene bisadducts in BHJ solar cells has met synthetic challenges. In this work, a new regioselective synthesis method, the so-called prebisaddition-confined bisfunctionalization (PCB), was developed for preparing isomer-free C60 bisadducts. This synthesis was highly selective for obtaining homo- and hetero-bisadducts with an “e configuration”. Isomer-free C60 bisadducts, e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, e-NC60BA and e-PPMF, were successfully synthesized via PCB. The gram-scale synthesis of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 was realized. Single crystals of e-PPMF and two intermediates were obtained. Electrochemical studies proved that a single isomer has reduced energetic disorder. e-PPMF featuring a compact methano group and a solubilizing side chain showed good performance in P3HT and low-bandgap polymer solar cells. A decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.11% was achieved in solar cells consisting of e-PPMF and the low-bandgap polymer PPDT2FBT. The outstanding photovoltaic performance of e-PPMF among the fullerene bisadducts results from its better packing and reduced energetic disorder.

Fullerenes are among the best acceptor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to their strong electron affinity and isotropic electron-transporting capability. The synthesis of high-LUMO fullerene bisadducts is an effective strategy for increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs. Theoretical studies have indicated that energetic disorder caused by the isomers mainly accounts for the low electron mobility of common bisadducts. Isomer-free bisadducts with reduced energetic disorder have been predicted to be efficient acceptors for PSCs, but they have met synthetic challenges. This article reports a prebisaddition-confined bisfunctionalization (PCB) approach for the synthesis of isomer-free bisadducts. PCB is highly selective for obtaining homo- and hetero-bisadducts with an “e configuration”. We realized the gram-scale preparation of a homo-bisadduct, e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, and succeeded in the synthesis of e-NC60BA, which was only achievable via HPLC previously. An isomer-free hetero-bisadduct, e-PPMF, was also obtained, featuring a compact methano group and a solubilizing side chain, and it demonstrated the highest PCE (8.11%) for fullerene bisadducts to date. The preparation of isomer-free bisadducts with compact side groups can simultaneously reduce the packing and energetic disorder. This innovative approach will be used to produce many high-performance fullerene acceptors in the future.


Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have advantages like low cost, light weight, flexibility and solution processing. As excellent electron accepting and transporting materials, fullerenes have been widely used in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.8% has recently been achieved. Great efforts have been made in the development of high-performance fullerene acceptors. An effective strategy is to synthesize fullerene bisadducts with high LUMO levels, which can offer a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) than monoadducts, e.g. phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Bisadducts are quite effective for improving the performance of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based solar cells. Indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) and indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA) gave PCEs of over 7%. However, for non-P3HT solar cells, especially low-bandgap polymer solar cells, bisadducts usually gave low PCEs with low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which result from low electron mobility. The unsatisfactory electron transporting properties of bisadducts originate from two aspects: (1) “packing disorder”, poor packing due to increased steric hindrance of side chains; and (2) “energetic disorder”, variation in the LUMOs of regioisomers. According to a molecular dynamics model, Steiner et al. indicated that the latter is the main reason for the low electron mobility of fullerene bisadducts. Isomer-free bisadducts with reduced energetic disorder were predicted to possess comparable electron mobility to PC61BM and may afford higher PCEs not only in P3HT-based solar cells. However, the preparation of such promising “isomer-free” fullerene bisadducts has met challenges.

There are two approaches to obtaining isomerically pure fullerene bisadducts. One is to separate a single isomer from the as-prepared bisadducts (i.e. isomer mixture) using chromatography. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Meng et al. and Wong et al. obtained single isomers of dihydronaphthyl C60 bisadduct (NC60BA) and IC70BA, respectively, which showed better performance than the corresponding isomer mixtures in P3HT-based solar cells. However, chromatographic separation is tedious. Another approach is to obtain a target isomer via controlled synthesis. Diederich's “tether-directed remote functionalization” is a useful strategy. Using a molecular tether to carry two or more addition groups, multiaddition to fullerenes will present regioselectivity, because the length, rigidity and conformation of the tether can confine the reaction sites. Several groups have applied this strategy to synthesize isomer-reduced or isomer-free fullerene bisadducts with enhanced photovoltaic performance. However, issues like unsatisfied regioselectivity, inter-fullerene side reactions, and remaining tethers always exist.
In this work, a prebisaddition-confined bisfunctionalization (PCB) approach was applied for synthesizing isomerically pure C60 bisadducts (Scheme 1). It includes a decagram-scale preparation of a pre-added fullerene (trans1 anthracene C60 bisadduct (trans1-AC60BA)), a highly selective bisaddition to trans1-AC60BA at two orthogonal equatorial double bonds, and a quantitative removal of anthracenes. The e-isomers of homo- or hetero-bisadducts were selectively prepared. We realized the gram-scale preparation of a homo-bisadduct, e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 and succeeded in the synthesis of e-NC60BA, which was obtained by HPLC previously. Further, an isomer-free hetero-bisadduct (e-PPMF) was synthesized, featuring a compact methano group (>CH2) and a solubilizing side chain. With reduced packing disorder and energetic disorder, e-PPMF possesses decent electron mobility and showed good performance in solar cells with P3HT or low-bandgap polymers. e-PPMF:PPDT2FBT solar cells showed a PCE of 8.11%, demonstrating the highest efficiency for fullerene bisadducts to date.

In 2001, Kräutler et al. found that under solvent-free conditions, bisaddition of anthracene to C60 was highly regioselective, producing trans1-AC60BA in 44% yield. When a large excess of addition reagents were used, the two anthracene addends on trans1-AC60BA confined the reaction sites and led to a high-yield (95%) tetraaddition at the four equatorial double bonds. We thought that this reaction might be manipulatable at the bisaddition stage and would help us to realize the PCB strategy.

We first improved Kräutler's method for synthesizing trans1-AC60BA (Scheme 2a). By using a vacuum valve-equipped flask instead of a sealed capillary as the reaction container and heating it inside a muffle furnace, we scaled up the production from the milligram-scale to the decagram-scale (see the ESI). The crude product was a mixture of trans1-AC60BA and unreacted C60 (∼1:1), which is consistent with a previous report. Owing to its low solubility and similar polarity to C60, it was very difficult to separate trans1-AC60BA from the mixture. But this problem was solved by directly using the mixture as the starting material for the next Bingel reaction. As C60 shows a higher reactivity than trans1-AC60BA in the Bingel reaction, treating the mixture with 4 equivalents (relative to 10 g C60) of di-tert-butyl-2-bromomalonate and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) completely converted C60 to highly polar multiadducts, while the Bingel reaction on trans1-AC60BA stopped at monoaddition. Then, unreacted trans1-AC60BA (1.8 g) and two isomers of the monoadduct of trans1-AC60BA, compound 1 (3.0 g) and compound 2 (2.8 g), can be separated from C60 multiadducts. 1 and 2 were characterized using spectroscopic methods. The minor structural difference between 1 and 2 was reflected by their bridgehead proton signals in the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1 and S3, ESI). As the four bridgehead protons in 1 are equivalent, only one singlet peak at 5.85 ppm was observed. In contrast, two singlet peaks at 5.87 and 5.53 ppm were observed for 2 because the Bingel addition broke the chemical equivalence of the two bridgehead protons on the same anthracene addend. The 13C NMR spectra of 1 and 2 indicated their C2v molecular symmetry (Fig. S2 and S4, ESI). The structure of 2 was further confirmed by single crystal XRD analysis (vide infra). Next, we used 1 and 2 as the starting materials for synthesizing tetraadduct 3. Both 1 and 2 can undergo a selective Bingel addition at the orthogonal equatorial double bonds to produce 3. Treating a mixture of 1 (3.0 g) and 2 (2.8 g) with 3 equivalents of di-tert-butyl-2-bromomalonate and potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) afforded 3.6 g of compound 3 in 53% yield (67% yield based on the actually reacted amounts of 1 and 2) and small amounts of higher adducts. KOtBu was chosen instead of DBU because the more basic KOtBu can speed up the addition (reaction completed in 15 minutes) and produce 3 more favourably than higher adducts. The structure of 3 was also confirmed by single crystal XRD analysis (vide infra). The addition sites of 3 (red) are shown in Scheme 2a. The selective addition at the orthogonal equatorial double bonds might be driven by the formation of two separate benzenoid rings (blue) on fullerene, which could improve the aromaticity of the target molecule. This viewpoint was generally accepted for the understanding of the regioselective functionalizations of fullerenes. Refluxing 3 (3.6 g) in toluene quantitatively removed anthracene via retro-Diels–Alder reaction and afforded 2.7 g of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2. The overall yield of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 (17%) is higher than that of e-C60[C(CO2Et)2]2 (16%) obtained from HPLC. The absorption spectrum of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 is consistent with the spectra for typical e-bisadducts obtained from the Bingel reaction. A sharp peak is located at 422 nm and a broad band with a maximum at 481 nm (Fig. S23a, ESI). The 1H NMR spectrum of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 is shown in Fig. 1a. The two half-intensity peaks at 1.63 and 1.60 ppm can be assigned to the two tBu groups on the symmetry plane of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, while the full-intensity peak at 1.62 ppm can be assigned to the two tBu groups separated by the symmetry plane. The 13C NMR spectrum confirmed the Cs symmetry of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 (Fig. S8, ESI).

e-NC60BA showed good performance in P3HT-based solar cells, and it was obtained from HPLC. We realized its regioselective synthesis via the PCB approach (Scheme 2b). trans1-AC60BA reacted with excess amounts of 1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,2]oxathiine 3-oxide in boiling carbon disulfide (CS2) to produce trisadduct 4 in 9% yield. Unlike the Bingel reaction performed at room temperature, this Diels–Alder reaction was carried out at 46 °C for promoting diene production, though the high temperature can cause anthracene loss and a low yield of 4. Compound 4 contains two regioisomers because of two addition sites (Fig. S9, ESI). Tetraadduct 5 was obtained in 23% yield by further addition at the orthogonal equatorial double bonds of 4. Refluxing 5 in toluene gave e-NC60BA in 94% yield. In this step, o-quinodimethane addends survived in the retro-Diels–Alder reaction since the aromatic benzene ring can stabilize the molecule. e-NC60BA shows an identical absorption spectrum to that of e-NC60BA obtained from HPLC (Fig. S23b, ESI). Compared with e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, e-NC60BA shows a similar absorption peak at 423 nm, while presenting a strong absorption at short wavelengths. The 1H NMR spectrum of e-NC60BA at room temperature is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI). The varying-temperature NMR spectra were studied (see Fig. S13, ESI), and it was found that at high temperatures, e-NC60BA presented simplified CH2 signals, which results from the fast flapping of o-quinodimethane side groups (Fig. 1b).
Fullerene hetero-bisadducts with a compact methano group (>CH2) are good acceptors in BHJ solar cells since the small >CH2 does not affect fullerene packing, thus keeping decent electron mobility. Using the PCB approach, we synthesized an isomer-free fullerene bisadduct, e-PPMF (Scheme 2c). Treating compound 1 with 4 equivalents of phenethyl 2-bromo-2-phenylacetate (PP-Br) and KOtBu produced 6 in 27% yield. Refluxing 6 in toluene gave bisadduct 7 in 98% yield. Then, >C(CO2tBu)2 group of 7 was converted to >CH2via a two-step decarboxylation and e-PPMF was obtained in 42% yield. e-PPMF was characterized using spectroscopic methods and single crystal XRD analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of e-PPMF is shown in Fig. 1c. >CH2 shows a characteristic dd signal at 3.69 ppm, with coupling constants of 62.7 and 6.5 Hz. The crystal structure of e-PPMF confirmed the e configuration of the molecule, with the cyclopropane ring of >CH2 bisected by the plane of the cyclopropane ring of the PP moiety (vide infra). The absorption spectrum of e-PPMF is quite similar to that of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 (Fig. S23c, ESI).
For comparison, we prepared isomer mixtures of C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, NC60BA and PPMF (designated as m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, m-NC60BA and m-PPMF) via conventional approaches (see the ESI). Theoretically, m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, m-NC60BA and m-PPMF consist of 8, 8 and 16 regioisomers, respectively. The 1H NMR spectra of m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, m-NC60BA and m-PPMF are presented in Fig. S20–S22 (ESI).

Single crystals of compounds 2 and 3 were obtained by slowly diffusing ethanol into their CS2 solution, while e-PPMF single crystals were obtained by slowly diffusing methanol into its toluene solution. The crystal structures of 2, 3 and e-PPMF are presented in Fig. 2. The structure of 2 indicates that Bingel addition took place at the double bond on the equatorial plane of trans1-AC60BA. The structure of 3 proved that the second Bingel addition took place at the orthogonal equatorial double bonds. A disorder was found when analyzing the single crystal structure of e-PPMF. The methano group of e-PPMF can be present at two opposite positions, C61 and C62, with 50% probability each (Fig. 2c). In single crystals, e-PPMF molecules stack, while >CH2 groups may point to opposite directions. e-PPMF single crystals have a lamellar structure, and two well-packed fullerene bilayers are separated in an orderly manner by a layer of PP side chains (Fig. 2d). >CH2 groups in the voids do not affect fullerene packing. The shortest distance between fullerenes is 3.19 Å, guaranteeing good packing for electron transport.


The materials developed in this work were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The cyclic voltammograms of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, e-NC60BA, m-NC60BA, e-PPMF, m-PPMF and PC61BM (as reference) are shown in Fig. S24 (ESI). All potentials corrected against the Fc/Fc+ redox couple and the estimated LUMOs are listed in Table S1 (ESI). All bisadducts except e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 and m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 show elevated LUMO levels compared to PC61BM due to the shrinkage of fullerene π-conjugation. e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 and m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 show similar LUMOs (−3.65 and −3.64 eV, respectively) to that of PC61BM (−3.65 eV) as four electron-withdrawing ester groups might pull down the LUMOs. Compared with PC61BM, 0.16 eV and 0.07–0.09 eV elevation in LUMOs were observed for NC60BAs and PPMFs, respectively. e-Isomers show similar LUMOs to those of the corresponding isomer mixtures.

The differential pulse voltammograms of e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 and m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, e-NC60BA and m-NC60BA, e-PPMF and m-PPMF are compared in Fig. 3. It was indicated that the energetic disorder of fullerene materials was proportional to the standard deviation (σ) of DPV peaks. By fitting DPV peaks with a Gaussian model, we found that all isomer-free bisadducts show smaller σ compared to the corresponding isomer mixtures (Fig. S25, ESI). The average σ values for e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, e-NC60BA and e-PPMF are 44.8, 45.6 and 45.3 mV, respectively, being similar to those of ferrocene (45.7 mV) and PC61BM (45.1 mV), but much smaller than those of m-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2 (49.1 mV), m-NC60BA (55.1 mV) and m-PPMF (51.3 mV). This indicates that isomer-free bisadducts have less energetic disorder. e-NC60BA shows a higher electron mobility than m-NC60BA, corresponding to its reduced energetic disorder. So it is reasonable that e-PPMF possesses a higher electron mobility than m-PPMF.

With good packing and reduced energetic disorder, e-PPMF can be an efficient acceptor for BHJ solar cells. e-PPMF was blended with P3HT or a low-bandgap polymer (PPDT2FBT and PBDTTT-C-T, see Fig. 4) to make inverted solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:fullerene/MoO3/Ag. PC61BM and m-PPMF were used as references. PPDT2FBT and PBDTTT-C-T show narrower bandgaps of 1.76 and 1.58 eV, respectively, compared to P3HT (1.91 eV). The optimal conditions reported previously were applied to the corresponding devices. The J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best cells are shown in Fig. S26–S28 (ESI) and the device performance data are listed in Table 1. For P3HT and PPDT2FBT cells, e-PPMF showed the best performance among the three acceptors, giving the highest PCE of 4.51% and 8.11%, respectively. PBDTTT-C-T:e-PPMF cells gave a PCE of 5.92% lower than that of PBDTTT-C-T:PC61BM cells. The good performance of e-PPMF cells benefits from the higher Voc (∼0.1 V increase) and decent Jsc and FF. In sharp contrast, m-PPMF cells deliver even slightly higher Voc (0.02–0.03 V increase) than e-PPMF cells, but the significant decrease in Jsc and FF pulls down the PCE of m-PPMF cells. Such Voc–Jsc or Voc–FF tradeoffs are often observed in solar cells using m-bisadducts. The 8.11% PCE obtained for PPDT2FBT:e-PPMF cells is the highest PCE for BHJ solar cells using a fullerene bisadduct as the acceptor to date. The PPDT2FBT:e-PPMF solar cell exhibits >80% EQE at 590–668 nm, confirming its good photovoltaic performance (Fig. S27b, ESI). The integrated photocurrent from EQE spectra is consistent with that from J–V measurements (Fig. S26–S28, ESI).

Compared with m-PPMF, e-PPMF showed a PCE enhancement in the three polymer solar cells, which resulted from the increase in Jsc and FF, suggesting its better electron-transporting properties. The electron mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S29, ESI). e-PPMF possesses a mobility of 2.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of m-PPMF (1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result proves the theoretical prediction on the transport properties of isomer-free bisadducts. As up to 16 isomers might exist in m-PPMF, those isomers with low LUMOs could act as electron traps to deteriorate electron transport and decrease Jsc and FF. Replacing m-PPMF with e-PPMF could reduce traps in the fullerene phase and reduce trap-assisted recombination. This hypothesis was proved by studying the dependence of Voc on light intensity (Fig. 5). The plot slope decreased from 1.83 (kBT/q as the unit) for m-PPMF cells to 1.56 for e-PPMF cells, indicating the reduction of recombination.e-PPMF shows much better performance than m-PPMF in thick devices. For thick P3HT and PPDT2FBT cells (∼250 nm and ∼290 nm thick, respectively), 43% and 61% enhancements in PCE, respectively, were observed by replacing m-PPMF with e-PPMF. These results demonstrate the potential of isomer-free fullerene bisadducts since they can meet the thick-film requirement of roll-to-roll production. The electron mobility of e-PPMF is lower than that of PC61BM (7.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In this regard, side chain engineering may help, i.e. reducing the size of PP side chain to improve molecular packing.
The morphologies for the blend films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see Fig. S30–S32, ESI). Nanofiber-like phases were observed in all phase images, and this phase separation feature is favourable for exciton dissociation. Compared with PPDT2FBT:fullerene and PBDTTT-C-T:fullerene blend films, the P3HT:fullerene blend film presents uniformly distributed nanofibers with diameters of around 10 nm. It is very difficult to find the morphological difference between e-PPMF:polymer and m-PPMF:polymer blend films here. Future work using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and other techniques may help us to obtain more details about the molecular packing, orientation, nanoscale phase separation and interface.

A prebisaddition-confined bisfunctionalization (PCB) approach was designed for synthesizing isomer-free fullerene bisadducts. The synthesis was highly selective for preparing homo- and hetero-bisadducts with an e configuration. We realized the gram-scale preparation of a homo-bisadduct, e-C60[C(CO2tBu)2]2, and succeeded in the synthesis of e-NC60BA, which was obtained by HPLC previously. An isomer-free hetero-bisadduct, e-PPMF, was also developed, and the good packing and reduced energetic disorder endowed e-PPMF with a decent electron mobility. e-PPMF demonstrated outstanding performance in P3HT and low-bandgap polymer solar cells. Further efforts towards modifying the side chains of potential bisadducts to improve molecular packing and electron mobility are ongoing for the development of highly efficient acceptors for BHJ solar cells.
