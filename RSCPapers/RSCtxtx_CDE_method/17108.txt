TiO2 sub-microspheres applied as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been reported to have dual functions with high specific surface areas and light scattering capabilities. Large voids are left in the sub-microsphere film and lead to the poor connectivity between the neighboring sub-microspheres, which will limit the enhancement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the power conversion efficiency (η). Herein, we develop a closely linked network by introducing TiO2 nanocrystallines into the voids to construct a continuous electron transport pathway. It is found that pore sizes, porosity, and specific surface area could be effectively tuned by simply adjusting the content of TiO2 nanocrystallines. As confirmed by the intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), when the content of TiO2 nanocrystallines in the sub-microspheres is 10 wt% (NP10), the electron transport time, electron collection efficiency, and electron diffusion length are optimized compared with the other contents. As a result, the η of the optimized NP10 photoanode based DSSC is up to 11.22%, which is higher than the 10.58% efficiency demonstrated by the pure sub-microsphere photoanode based cell.

Over the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as a promising alternative to conventional p–n junction solar cells for renewable energy due to their relatively high conversion efficiency and low-cost fabrication processes. Normally, for an efficient DSSC, photoanodes are simultaneously satisfied with both large specific surface areas and high light scattering abilities. Recent progress with 3D TiO2 hierarchical structures (including hollow spheres, solid spheres, and different spherical aggregates of diverse diameters) could satisfy the above requirements for high-performance DSSCs.

The 3D hierarchical structures have integrated nanoparticle building blocks into three-dimensional structures. Those hierarchical structures have the dual functions of enhancing the specific surface area and light scattering, and they have been verified to improve light harvesting and cell performance. However, 3D spherical structures always have large sizes and inevitably bring many voids among these structures, which would lead to low connectivity among neighboring spheres and restrict electron transport. In order to improve the connectivity of films, nanospindle-based microspheres have been synthesized as bridges to embed each other and enhance the connectivity of the film. The embedded high quality nanospindle, microsphere-based photoanode possesses a longer electron lifetime and higher electron diffusion coefficient compared with the conventional microspheres, which contributes to a ∼30% power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement. Nevertheless, the microspheres assembled by the nanospindles have a low specific surface area, which will restrict the enhancement of the dye loading capacity. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a simple and effective method for preparing an ideal photoanode with high surface areas, efficient light harvesting, and continuous electron transport pathways.
Herein, we develop an approach aiming to construct continuous electron transport pathways by enhancing the connectivity of neighboring sub-microspheres with nanocrystallines. Those nanocrystallines fill the voids between the neighboring sub-microspheres, and they are inclined to mingle together to form a closely linked network. It is expected that an appropriate amount of nanocrystallines would strengthen the connectivity between the neighboring sub-microspheres to allow continuous electron transport and increase the amount of dye adsorbed per unit photoanode area. This provides a different approach to the design of sub-microsphere films, which is generally not indicated by previous reports. Our approach yields a high surface area for better dye loading, focuses on the improvement of transport channel for better electron transport, and holds for a more convenient way to optimize photoanode performances for efficient DSSCs.

In this study, TiO2 sub-microspheres (500 ± 100 nm in diameter) and nanocrystallines (20 nm in diameter) were prepared the same as described in ref. 19 and 20, respectively. Five pastes containing TiO2 nanocrystallines and sub-microspheres were prepared with TiO2 nanocrystalline contents of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 wt%, (labeled as NP0, NP5, NP10, NP20, and NP50), respectively.


In view of the weak connectivity between TiO2 sub-microspheres and FTO substrates, a ∼2.5 μm thick TiO2 nanocrystalline layer functioning as a bridge was created prior to screen-printing on the FTO glass (TEC, 15 Ω sq−1). The as-obtained five mixed pastes were repeatedly screen-printed onto the FTO glass (TEC, 15 Ω sq−1) and then sintered in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The cell active area was 5 × 5 mm, and the cell was masked with 6 × 6 mm aperture prior to measuring. The thickness of the films was measured by a profilometer (XP-2, AMBIOS Technology, Inc., USA). The five freshly synthesized TiO2 photoanodes were soaked in 0.1 M TiCl4 aqueous solution and stored in a closed container at 65 °C for 40 min. Those films were sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min after washing with distilled water. Then, the five different films were immersed into a 300 μM C101 dye with cheno-3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholic acid, for the whole night. After being washed by acetonitrile and dried in air, the dye-loaded photoanodes were assembled with the Pt-modified TEC 15 TCO counter-electrode and high-efficiency electrolyte composed of 30 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) in a solvent mixture of 85% acetonitrile and 15% valeronitrile by volume.


The cross-sectional morphologies of the photoanodes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, HITACHI, Japan). The surface area, pore volume and pore size were evaluated by using a micromeritics (TriStar II 3020 V1.03, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation) nitrogen adsorption/desorption apparatus. Diffuse reflection and transmittance spectra were obtained from a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SOLID3700, Shimadzu Co. Ltd, Japan). The J–V measurements were carried out on a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter controlled by Test point software under a xenon lamp (100 mW cm−2). The IPCE values were confirmed as a function of wavelength from 300 to 900 nm (PV Measurements, Inc.) for DSSCs. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded by a computer controlled potentiostat (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzer land) in a frequency range of 10 mHz to 1000 kHz applied in the dark. An electrochemical workstation (IM6e, Zahner, Germany) was conducted to measure the intensity of the modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) with light emitting diodes (LED, λ = 610 nm) driven by Export (Zahner, Germany). Small amplitude is 10% or less than that of the dc component provided by the LED, and the frequency range was from 300 mHz to 3 kHz.


Fig. 1 shows field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) cross-section (a–f) and top (g–k) images of sub-microsphere based photoanodes with different contents of nanocrystallines. As shown in Fig. 1f, the NP10 based photoanode, similar to the other four photoanodes, is composed of monolayer of pure TiO2 nanocrystallines and two layers of sub-microspheres. The compact TiO2 nanocrystalline layer is well-connected to FTO glass, and the TiO2 sub-microspheres are distributed compactly and uniformly on top of the TiO2 nanocrystalline layer, which contributes to the rapid collection of electrons. From the image presented in Fig. 1a and g, the NP0 film is composed of pure sub-microspheres with a diameter of 500 ± 100 nm, and the adjacent sub-microspheres are stacked on each other at a single point of contact, which leaves a large amount of voids in the film (indicating a poor connectivity among the neighboring sub-microspheres). As the nanocrystalline content increased, the amount of voids decreased because the nanocrystallines filled into part of voids (Fig. 1b–d and h–j). It is obvious that the nanocrystallines are more homogeneously dispersed in the sub-microsphere matrices and stick on the surface of sub-microspheres. Therefore, a higher connectivity among the sub-microspheres is formed. That good connectivity supplies a continuous electron transport pathway in the photoanode. However, as shown in Fig. 1e and k, when the content of nanocrystallines is over 20 wt%, the excess content of nanocrystallines embeds into almost all of the voids and even takes up the sub-microsphere matrices, resulting in the increase of grain boundaries and inhibiting the electron transport.

Fig. 2a and b show the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves calculated from adsorption isotherm of composite films, respectively. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of all five photoanodes are confirmed as type IV with H1 type hysteresis loops at high relative pressures (P/P0 = 0.8–0.95), which is typical of mesoporous materials. The pore sizes of five photoanodes centered at 20 nm are due to the inherently built inner pores within sub-microspheres. As summarized in Table 1, the NP0 based photoanode has a specific surface area of 77.5 m2 g−1 and a relative wide pore size distribution located at 20.9 nm. Increasing the content of nanocrystallines decreases the large mesopore size and porosity of the film, but it increases the specific surface area from 77.5 to 78.9 and 80.2 m2 g−1 for the photoanodes NP5 and NP10, respectively. This phenomenon occurs because parts of the nanocrystallines are filled in the voids between the neighboring sub-microspheres, which serves to provide additional specific surface area and block part of voids. The enlargement in specific surface area along with the roughness factor results in a corresponding increased dye loading from 1.076 to 1.135 and 1.255 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1, respectively. The increased specific surface area can be observed from the observations of morphology. As discussed above, the specific surface area of the nanocrystallines is smaller than that of the sub-microspheres. As the nanocrystalline concentration is increased (e.g., 20 and 50 wt% in this study), the nanocrystallines will not only fill into the voids, but they will also take up part of original sub-microsphere positions. Thus, these assemblies can perturb the skeleton construction of sub-microspheres, resulting in a significant decrease of specific surface area, roughness factor, and dye adsorption.

Fig. 3 compares the diffused reflection and transmittance spectra of the five photoanodes. According to the Mie theory, the light scattering effect of particles is dominated by the size of the particle and the wavelength of the incident light. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, introducing nanocrystallines into the TiO2 sub-microspheres leads to a gradual decrease in the diffuse reflection capacities, especially in the long wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm. This can be explained by the increased number of nanocrystallines, which results in the increase of Rayleigh-type scattering according to the previous report by M. Grätzel group. It can be concluded that the photoanode composed of TiO2 nanocrystalline and sub-microspheres in different weight ratios can produce a significant effect on the light scattering ability and further influence the light harvesting efficiency of the corresponding DSSCs. As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the transmittance spectra of the photoanodes (NP0, NP5, NP10) exhibits a very low transmittance in the 400–800 nm regions, suggesting that almost all of the incident light is scattered within the photoanodes, whereas among these photoanodes, the transmittance of NP20 and NP50 are higher in the visible and near-infrared regions, indicating their inferior light scattering properties. Thus, the weight ratio of TiO2 nanocrystalline and sub-microspheres should be optimized to guarantee the superior light adsorption, which is an important factor for the high short-circuit photocurrent density of DSSCs.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the five composite photoanodes, we fabricated DSSCs using a C101 dye combined with a less viscous acetonitrile-based electrolyte. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4, and the parameters of DSSCs are summarized in Table 2. The five DSSCs exhibit similar open-circuit voltages (Voc) and fill factors (FF). It is notable that when the content of TiO2 nanocrystallines reaches 10 wt%, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (η) are increased obviously, from 18.89 mA cm−2 to 20.19 mA cm−2, and from 10.58% to 11.22%, respectively. The improved Jsc might result from two aspects. One aspect is the increased dye loading amounts, which enhances light utilization. The other aspect is the effective contact between nanocrystallines and sub-microspheres, which promotes continuous electron transport. While the weight ratio of nanocrystalline and sub-microspheres increases continuously, the Jsc and η decrease rapidly, which is consistent with the dye uptakes and light scattering capabilities (Fig. 3a and Table 2). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that 10 wt% of nanocrystallines inserted into the voids between the adjacent sub-microspheres is the optimized ratio to provide an additional dual effect on dye loading and electron transport.

Intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) are utilized to investigate the electron transport and recombination in these five different photoanodes. The IMPS mainly studies the electron transport process in TiO2 photoanodes at a short circuit, and the transport time (τd) can be directly obtained. The IMVS investigates the process of electron transfer at the dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface at an open circuit, and the electron lifetime (τn) is obtained. The τd as a function of Jsc for DSSCs with different contents of nanoparticles, is shown in Fig. 5a. The Jsc dependence of τd is expressed by the relation: τd ∝ Jscα−1, where the parameter α is related to the steepness of the exponential trap state distribution. The value of τd is observed to decrease with the increase of Jsc. It can be obviously seen that among these photoanodes, the NP10 photoanode exhibits the lowest τd, followed by NP5, NP0, NP20, and NP50 in turn. A simple schematic of electron transport is shown in Scheme 1, proving possible reasons for significant differences in the NP0, NP10, and NP50 photoanodes. One reason is that the electron transport in the normal working conditions of DSSCs is based on the random-walk approach and trap-limited transport. Traps are mostly located either at grain boundaries or in the bulk of the TiO2. However, for a large surface area TiO2 film, the electron is primarily trapped at the grain boundaries. Such grain boundaries are likely to be more abundant in the NP0 photoanode due to the poor connectivity of the pure sub-microspheres. As more electrons are trapped in these grain boundaries, the electron transport time becomes longer. However, the incorporation of slight nanocrystallines is expected to decrease pore sizes in the NP10 film and offers the possibility to connect the adjacent sub-microspheres. Such good contact between the nanocrystallines and sub-microspheres eliminates or reduces the probability of the trapping incident. Another reason for the fast electron transport can be explained by the electron concentration, which decides the electron transport and separation through the network of photoanodes (diffusive transport). As discussed above, owing to the highest dye loading capacity, electron concentration is relatively higher in the NP10 photoanode under the light condition, indicating that the driving force of the electron transport from the top electrode to the bottom electrode is strongest. Moreover, as depicted in Scheme 1c, the nanocrystallines are going to almost all of the voids left between the neighboring sub-microspheres, and part of nanocrystallines even occupy the original positions of sub-microspheres. This phenomenon will produce numerous grain boundaries and prolong the electron transport time.

As shown in Fig. 5b, when the nanocrystalline content increases from 0 to 20 wt%, τn is increased. In terms of the photoanode of NP0, a large number of electrons are accumulated in the surface of the nanoparticle and could not be transferred promptly to another particle, which would accelerate the electron recombination in the dyed-TiO2/electrolyte interface. Introducing a certain amount of nanocrystallines can fill into the large voids, and this would then reduce the porosity and strength of the connectivity between the sub-microspheres and the nanocrystallines. Thus, electrons step randomly through the three-dimensional network easily, resulting in the decrease of electron recombination. Adding 50 wt% of nanocrystalline into sub-microspheres can simultaneously introduce abundant grain boundaries, which play a dominant role in the electron transport and recombination, resulting in a shorter τn.
The charge collection efficiency (ηcc), which is determined by the kinetic competition between electron transport and interfacial recombination, can be further obtained from τd and τn using the relation of ηcc = 1 − τd/τn. As a consequence, ηcc values of 95.5% and 96.4% were demonstrated in the NP0 and NP10 based cell at 96 mW cm−2, respectively, while the NP50 based cell only showed a limited ηcc of 80% at the same illumination intensity. Taking the film thickness into consideration, the effective diffusion length (Ln) is introduced to demonstrate the competition between the collection of electrons and the electron back-reaction by diffusion to the substrate. Specifically, Ln can be estimated as , where Dn is the diffusion coefficient of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, and d is the film thickness. Normally, a TiO2 photoanode requires the electron diffusion length to be greater than that of the film thickness in order to avoid undergoing recombination in the electron transport process. Certainly, the precondition is to keep the five photoanodes with similar thicknesses. As can be seen in Fig. 6b, all Ln are longer than the thickness of photoanodes (∼14 μm), and the sequence of Ln at 96 mW cm−2 is NP10 (∼38 μm) > NP5 (∼33 μm) > NP0 (∼32 μm) > NP20 (∼31 μm) > NP5 (∼16 μm), which is basically in accordance with their Jsc sequence in Table 2. It can be concluded that the NP10 photoanode has the highest ηcc and Ln resulting from the fewer grain boundaries and more efficient electron transport pathways.

Generally, Jsc can be approximated by the follow equation,


IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)φinjηcc

(1)

Jsc = q × IPCE(λ) × I0

(2)
where LHE(
λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency, φinj is the value of injection efficiency, q is the elementary charge, and I0 is the light intensity. In this study, the values of φinj are similar because of the same TiO2 photoanodes, dye, and identical performed conditions. Therefore, the IPCE is mainly decided by the light harvesting ability of the dyes, the adsorbing capacities of dye onto the photoanodes, and the charge collection efficiency. It can be seen in Fig. 7, as expected, that the NP10 based photoanode exhibits the dramatically highest IPCE among the five types of photoanodes. NP10 has the most compact and interconnected network, which dominates as the most significant enhancement of the charge collection efficiency within the cells. Moreover, based on the similar transmittance, such NP10 photoanode has the highest dye adsorption capacity compared to the pure sub-microspheres based photoanode, resulting in the highest IPCE, Jsc, and η in the NP10-based solar cell. Resulting from the increased content of nanocrystallines, the dye adsorbed by the NP20-based photoanode gradually increased at the expense of the charge collection efficiency and light harvesting efficiency. The opposite but combined factors jointly determine the final IPCE.


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Fig. 8, is frequently used to characterize the interface electrochemical behavior within DSSCs at −0.70 V in dark conditions, and the fitted data are summarized in Table 3. In the five Nyquist plots, two well-defined semicircles are observed in the high frequency region (>1 kHz, small semicircle) and in the mid-frequency region (1–100 Hz, large semicircle), which reflect the charge transfer at the interfaces of Pt/electrolyte and dyed TiO2/electrolyte, respectively. The small semicircles are basically the same due to using an identical counter electrode material. The results indicate that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) initially decreases with an increasing content of nanocrystallines, and then it gradually increases with the nanocrystalline concentration. This phenomenon might be explained by different light harvesting efficiencies and specific surface areas of the five photoanodes. Increasing the specific area causes a greater recombination probability, resulting in low recombination resistance at the dyed TiO2/electrolyte interface. The values of the electron lifetimes (τn(EIS)) are calculated according to the equation τn(EIS) = Rct × Cμ1, where Cμ1 is the chemical capacitance. The calculated τn(EIS) of the NP0, NP5, NP10, NP20, and NP50-based DSSCs are 146.4, 156.6, 158.9, 192.4, and 147.2 ms, respectively, which is consistent with the results of τn in Fig. 5b.

In summary, TiO2 nanocrystallines were introduced into sub-microspheres with different contents, and prepared as photoanodes in DSSCs. Our research suggests that the specific surface area and dye loading capacity are increased by the nanocrystallines embedded into the voids between neighboring sub-microspheres. In addition, TiO2 nanocrystallines link the adjacent sub-microspheres and then provide a continuous electron pathway so as to accelerate the electron transport and decrease electron recombination. Excessive nanocrystalline content (50%) could not only fill the empty space inside the sub-microspheres, but also could take up the sub-microsphere matrices, which resulted in a decrease of specific surface area and light scattering ability. Embodied by J–V, the introduction of nanocrystallines at 10 wt% into sub-microsphere photoanode-based DSSCs shows a higher efficiency (11.22%) than that of pure sub-microsphere photoanode-based cells (10.58%).
