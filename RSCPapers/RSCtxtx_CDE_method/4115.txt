A thermal precursor approach can serve as a solution-based process to form high-quality organic thin-films from small molecules with low solubility such as pristine fullerenes. In this study, highly-soluble C60–9-methylanthracene (9MA) adducts, of which the appended 9MA groups can be easily detached and evaporated by heating, were used as thermal precursors to C60. In a composite film of C60–9MA adducts with an amorphous polymer, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, the C60 aggregation was suppressed even after the thermal detachment of the 9MA groups at high temperature up to 160 °C. This result is contrasted with a composite film of the C60–9MA adducts and a crystalline conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), yielding undesirable large aggregates by thermal annealing. The organic photovoltaic (OPV) device based on the composite film of the C60–9MA adducts and PCDTBT showed a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.69%, which was remarkably improved up to 3.51% by a factor of ca. 5 after the thermal annealing treatment. Importantly, the maximum PCE was achieved at 140 °C, where an increase of the short-circuit current density (JSC) and a decrease of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) are well-balanced with increasing the annealing temperature. The results obtained here demonstrate the potential utility of the unique thermal precursor approach to form high-quality BHJ films from amorphous conjugated polymers and highly-insoluble fullerenes, expecting higher LUMO levels and VOC for applications in organic thin-film OPV devices made by cost-effective solution-based processes.

Film structures of the active layers in organic electronic devices such as field-effect transistors (FETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) profoundly affect the device performances, and therefore their optimization plays a crucial role for the achievement of high-efficiency devices. However, the optimization of the film structures, especially mesoscopic phase-separation structures of composite films, is often difficult owing to the intense self-aggregating nature and low miscibility of organic semiconducting molecules. For instance, pristine fullerenes, i.e., C60 and C70 are excellent candidates as electron-acceptors in OPVs due to their high electron mobilities, but their strong π–π interactions as well as rigid and symmetrical spherical structures retard their dissolution, thereby necessitating the incorporation of appended groups to be used in cost-effective solution processes. The mainstream route for the construction of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure in OPV devices has involved highly-soluble fullerene mono-adducts, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) and its C70 analogue ([70]PCBM). As the π-conjugation size is the major determinant of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of fullerene derivatives and thereby an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the BHJ OPV devices, various fullerene bis-adducts have also been utilized widely. However, the existence of non-conjugated substituents occupying a significant volume in the BHJ film would hinder the efficient light absorption, charge separation (CS) and electron transport, all of which are requisites for the achievement of a high short-circuit current density (JSC). In addition, these soluble substituents may also negatively impact the thermal and photochemical stabilities of the films.

A potential strategy to overcome the solubility problems of organic semiconductors with low solubility is a precursor approach. In this method, a film of a highly-soluble precursor compound is formed by a solution-process such as spin-coating, and then the precursor is converted to a target semiconducting material by external stimuli such as heat and light. In pioneering works by Ono and coworkers, bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene (BCOD)-fused porphyrin and thiophene were utilized as thermal precursors for benzoporphyrin (BP) and isothianaphthene (ITN). While BP and ITN themselves are prone to aggregation and difficult to be handled in solution processes, the ability to produce the rigid, planar BP and ITN structures via a post-deposition thermal annealing step led to the construction of BHJ structures with electron-accepting fullerene derivatives for OPV applications. Various other small molecules and polymers containing structures with high rigidity and coplanarity and thereby low solubility, i.e., acenes, were also incorporated in BHJ films as electron-donating materials by the precursor approach. In addition, conjugated polymers with thermocleavable side chains were developed to construct BHJ OPVs with higher thermal and photochemical stabilities. These precursor approaches are also beneficial to construct multi-layered structures in active layers by taking advantage of the drastic change in solubilities before and after the conversion process.
As contrasted with the wide applications of the precursor approaches for the electron-donating materials in OPV devices, precursors to electron-accepting fullerenes for the OPV devices have not been fully investigated so far. A sole example was reported by Heeger and coworkers in 2009, where fullerene–2-(alkoxycarbonyl)cyclopentadiene mono-adducts (C60–CpCO2R) were prepared as thermal precursors to C60 for the OPV applications. Devices based on the composite films of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and C60 obtained by the retro Diels–Alder reaction induced by heating exhibited enhanced photovoltaic performances compared to the as-prepared device with P3HT:C60–CpCO2R before the thermal treatment. However, the precursor fullerene derivatives have long alkyl chains (R = hexyl, octyl, and 2-ethylhexyl) to endow the sufficient solubility, and thus high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) drying after annealing at high temperature (>120 °C) was necessary to remove the detached CpCO2R. In addition, undesirable large aggregations were formed when the annealing temperature was above 140 °C. Therefore, there is still plenty of room for the exploration of suitable fullerene precursors and the optimization of device fabrication conditions.
In this study, we focused on C60–anthracene adducts as thermal precursors to pristine C60 as an electron-accepting material in BHJ OPV devices. It is well known that C60–anthracene adducts formed by Diels–Alder reaction are not thermally stable and easily cause retro Diels–Alder reaction at higher temperatures. Herein, methyl group is introduced at 9-position of anthracene to reduce the crystallinity and thus improve the solubility of the fullerene adducts (Scheme 1). The appended 9-methylanthracene (9MA) has no long alkyl chains, and thereby can be removed through evaporation from the composite films simply by thermal annealing without vacuum drying. To provide the sufficient solubility for the spin-coating processes, C60–9MA bis-adduct (C60(9MA)2) instead of mono-adduct (C60(9MA)) is mainly employed. Moreover, we did not use highly crystalline conjugated polymers such as P3HT, but an amorphous conjugated polymer, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) as an electron-donating material with an expectation of the aggregation suppression at high annealing temperature. The investigations on the effect of the annealing temperature on film structures and photovoltaic properties of the composite films have been conducted in detail.

The Diels–Alder reaction between C60 and 9MA in a molar ratio of 1:10 was conducted in toluene at 70 °C for 18 h (Scheme 1). This reaction yielded three fractions containing fullerenes; yellow-brown, black-brown and red-brown solutions, which were eluted in this order by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/toluene (3/2). Removal of the solvent from these fractions provided brown powders in a weight ratio of 1.0:2.8:1.0. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses with a Buckyprep column for the first and second fractions using a UV absorption detector at 330 nm were conducted and the profiles are shown in Fig. 1. A peak area ratio of C60(9MA)2:C60(9MA):C60:9MA obtained for the first fraction is 2.0:91.3:4.9:1.8, while that for the second fraction is 75.4:24.1:0.1:0.4. The peak assignments for C60(9MA)2 and C60(9MA) are supported by the measurements of electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra (see Experimental section). Apparently, main products of the first and second fractions are C60(9MA) and C60(9MA)2, respectively.

It should be noted here that we intended to use the C60–9MA adducts as thermal precursors to obtain pristine C60 in the blend film with PCDTBT by thermal treatment. The existence of the higher adduct, i.e., C60(9MA)2, as the main component in the blend film before the thermal treatment would not have a significant effect on optical and electronic properties of the film after the thermally induced retro Diels–Alder reaction because 9MA is evaporated during the heating (vide infra). In other words, the isolation of C60(9MA)2 and C60(9MA) is also of little significance for preparing the film containing pristine C60, because both of C60(9MA)2 and C60(9MA) give pristine C60 by heating. Additionally, the solubility tests of the powders obtained from the first and second fractions revealed that the latter possesses a much higher solubility in organic solvents (135, 69, and 145 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), toluene, and o-xylene, respectively) than the former (13, 2, and 10 mg mL−1 in ODCB, toluene, and o-xylene, respectively). Therefore, we decided to use only the second fraction for preparing the blend films with PCDTBT. Hereafter, the fullerene mixtures obtained from the first and second fractions are denoted as C60–9MA-1 and C60–9MA-2, respectively.
It should be pointed out that the third fraction includes a significant amount of the detached 9MA as well as the C60–9MA tri- and higher-adducts. Due to the instability of the multi-adducts it was difficult to purify the third fraction. Taking into account that C60–9MA-2 has the sufficient solubility, the third fraction was not considered for the following experiments.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of C60–9MA-2 exhibited clear weight loss between 100 and 240 °C (Fig. 2), suggesting the occurrence of the retro Diels–Alder reaction. The 35% mass loss at >240 °C corresponds to the evaporation of the 9MA detached from C60(9MA)2 and C60(9MA) as well as that of the 9MA originally included in the sample. The existence of a point where the slope becomes minimum at 195 °C indicates the sequential detachment of 9MA from C60(9MA)2.

Electrochemical properties of C60–9MA-1 and C60–9MA-2 as well as pristine C60 and [60]PCBM as references were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (Fig. S1, ESI). The first (E1) and second (E2) reduction potentials together with the LUMO energy levels are listed in Table S1 (ESI). C60–9MA-2 shows the reduction peaks attributable to both C60(9MA)2 and C60(9MA) due to the coexistence. The experimental LUMO levels are raised in the order of C60(9MA)2 (−3.50 eV) > C60(9MA) (−3.64 eV) ≃ [60]PCBM (−3.68 eV) > C60 (−3.75 eV), which is reasonable because the appended groups destroy the π-conjugation of fullerene. The difference in the LUMO levels of C60(9MA)2, C60(9MA), [60]PCBM, and C60 is consistent with that in the corresponding theoretical values (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI).

The surface morphology of the blend film of C60–9MA-2 and an amorphous conjugated polymer, PCDTBT, was visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3a). The film was fabricated on a glass substrate by spin-coating an ODCB solution with [PCDTBT]:[C60–9MA-2] = 1:5, which was optimized for the photovoltaic performance (vide infra). The PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 film reveals smooth morphology with a root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of 0.50 nm (Table 1), which is significantly more uneven than that for a blend film of PCDTBT and [60]PCBM (rms = 0.27 nm) (Table 1 and Fig. S3, ESI).

The PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 films fabricated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were heated at 120, 130, 140, 160, and 180 °C for 20 min in an inert atmosphere. The color of the blend films changed from purple to brownish purple during the heating, indicating the occurrence of retro Diels–Alder reaction. The PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 films were dissolved in toluene after the thermal treatment, and PCDTBT and PEDOT:PSS were removed by a short gel permeation chromatography (GPC) column. The change in the composition of C60(9MA)2, C60(9MA), C60, and 9MA were analyzed by the HPLC with the Buckyprep column. The chromatograms are displayed in Fig. 4 and the peak area ratios are listed in Table 2. The ratio of C60(9MA)2 monotonically decreased with increasing the annealing temperature and disappeared completely at 180 °C. Contrastingly, the peak area ratio of C60 became large with raising the temperature. The proportion of C60(9MA) increased when heated at 120 and 130 °C, then dropped rapidly at ≥140 °C. The thermal treatment of the blend film at 180 °C predominantly left C60 with a small amount of C60(9MA). These results clearly corroborate the occurrence of the detachment of 9MA groups from C60(9MA)2 and C60(9MA) by the thermal treatment, yielding the pristine C60 in the blend film with PCDTBT.

It should also be emphasized here that the HPLC profiles (Fig. 4) suggest the disappearance of detached 9MA groups in the blend films after the heating as a result of the absence of long alkyl chain in 9MA and thereby relatively high volatility of 9MA. The thickness of the blend films became thinner with increasing the annealing temperature (98, 63, 55, 52, 48, and 30 nm before and after annealing at 120, 130, 140, 160, and 180 °C), exemplifying the removal of 9MA from the blend films as well as the closer packing of the pristine C60 molecules than C60–9MA adducts. The relatively high volatility of 9MA is advantageous because the vacuum drying is unnecessary to remove the solubilizing agents as contrasted with the case of C60–CpCO2R.
Despite the high agglomerating nature of C60 with no substituents, AFM measurements of the blend films after annealing at ≤160 °C exhibit surface morphologies similar to that before the heating (Fig. 3b–e). The rms values range from 0.53 to 0.57 nm (Table 1), which are comparable to that of the film before annealing (0.50 nm). Although the AFM surface structure of the blend film after annealing at 180 °C (Fig. 3f) is also similar (rms = 0.70 nm, Table 1), sub-micrometer-sized phase separations are visible in the optical micrograph with lower magnification than that of the AFM (Fig. S4, ESI). The sub-micrometer-sized domains can be attributed to the C60 aggregations. Nevertheless, this is still in sharp contrast with the blend film of C60–9MA-2 and crystalline P3HT, yielding large aggregate domains of C60 after annealing at 140 °C (Fig. S5, ESI). The rms value of P3HT:C60–9MA-2 increases from 6.4 nm to 10.5 nm by the annealing. The amorphous nature of PCDTBT significantly hindered the C60 aggregation with keeping the well-mixed BHJ structure in the blend film.
UV-vis absorption spectra of the PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 films before and after annealing are depicted in Fig. 5a. The absorption intensity of the blend film was enhanced by the heating in the whole visible region. The absorptions increased especially at 420–520 nm with raising the annealing temperature. It is known that the closer packed structure of C60 makes the electronic interaction between the C60 molecules stronger in the C60 aggregates, and thus caused red shift and enhancement of the absorptions in the visible region. The thermally induced retro Diels–Alder reaction of C60–9MA adducts may yield such densely-aligned C60 domains in the blend film. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the blend films before and after heating exhibited no clear emission signals in the range of 600–800 nm, where the neat PCDTBT film showed intense fluorescence with a peak at 690 nm (Fig. 5b). This result reveals that the quenching efficiencies of PCDTBT fluorescence are almost unity (>0.995) in all the blend films. Due to the amorphous nature of PCDTBT as well as the high composition ratio of the fullerenes ([PCDTBT]:[C60–9MA-2] = 1:5), essentially all the polymers in the blend films are well mixed with at least a certain fraction of the fullerenes on a scale of exciton diffusion length (<10 nm).

BHJ OPVs were fabricated with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2/TiOx/Al to evaluate the annealing condition effect on the photovoltaic properties. The photoactive layer was formed by spin-coating the blend solution of PCDTBT and C60–9MA-2 with an optimized weight ratio of 1:5 in ODCB and then annealed at a given temperature for 20 min under an argon atmosphere. Device performances were characterized by current density–voltage curves measured under a simulated AM1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 6 and S6, ESI) and the averaged photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1.

The JSC and fill factor (FF) values of the OPV devices based on PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 increase with raising the annealing temperature up to 160 °C, and then decrease in the device heated at 180 °C (Fig. 6 and Table 1). Consistently, the devices annealed at higher temperature up to 160 °C exhibit higher incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) in the whole visible region (Fig. S7, ESI). On the other hand, the device based on PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 without annealing shows a VOC value of 0.982 V, which is larger than the reference device based on PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (0.880 V, Table 1). This is not surprising because the main component of C60–9MA-2 is C60(9MA)2 that has a higher LUMO level than [60]PCBM (Table S1, ESI). The VOC values of the OPV devices monotonically decrease with an increase of the annealing temperature (Fig. 6 and Table 1). The enhanced detachments of 9MA at higher temperature lower the LUMO level of the fullerene materials and thereby deteriorate VOC. Overall, a maximum PCE of 3.51% was achieved at annealing temperature of 140 °C, where the increases in JSC and FF and the decrease in VOC are well-balanced with increasing the annealing temperature. The high OPV device performance also demonstrates the creation of well-mixed polymer–fullerene BHJ structures in the blend films after the thermal annealing. At this stage the maximum PCE is still lower than that of the device based on the widely-used, high-performance [60]PCBM (4.16%). Nevertheless, the JSC values of the device annealed at 140–160 °C (7.63–7.83 mA cm−2) exceed that with [60]PCBM (7.48 mA cm−2) (Table 1), suggesting the potential application of this strategy to the other fullerenes (i.e., endohedral metallofullerene with higher LUMO levels).
It is known that the JSC of OPV depends on the efficiencies of (1) light-harvesting, (2) exciton collection at polymer–fullerene interface, (3) exciton dissociation, and (4) charge collection. Here, the collection efficiency of excitons generated in PCDTBT domains (step 2) should be unaffected by the annealing temperatures because the fluorescence of PCDTBT was thoroughly quenched irrespective of the heating temperatures (Fig. 5b). With regard to step 1, light-harvesting efficiencies of the PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 blend film was improved with increasing the annealing temperature (Fig. 5a). The efficiency of exciton dissociation (step 3) may also be enhanced at higher annealing temperatures because higher cohesive nature of the pristine fullerene C60 would suppress the geminate recombination at the polymer–fullerene interface and thus facilitate the exciton dissociation. Therefore, the improvements of efficiencies in steps 1 and 3 contribute to the increase in JSC values at higher annealing temperature. In addition, the thinner film by the removal of insulating 9MA in the devices heated at higher temperature lowers the series resistance of the OPV devices, resulting in the higher FF values. However, the heating of the blend film at 180 °C induced sub-micrometer-sized phase separations (Fig. S4, ESI), which should be a factor that decreases JSC and FF in the device annealed at 180 °C (7.60 mA cm−2 and 0.526, respectively) in comparison with those in the device heated at 160 °C (7.83 mA cm−2 and 0.583, respectively).
Meanwhile, charge mobilities of the blend films exert an influence on the charge collection efficiency (step 4). The electron mobility (μe) values estimated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method for PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 after annealing (>1.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) are significantly higher than that before annealing (0.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 1). As expected, the detachment of 9MA groups improved the μe value of the fullerene domains due to the formation of more densely-packed structures of C60 molecules. However, the μe value measured by SCLC gradually decreases in the device heated at higher temperatures, in spite of the more progressed detachment of 9MA (Fig. 4). The maximum μe value is obtained in the blend film annealed at 130 °C (6.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is smaller than that of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (18.11 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 1). This undesirable decrease in μe in the blend film heated at ≥140 °C can be responsible for the formation of polymer wetting layer on top of the blend films. Hoppe and coworkers reported such a wetting layer formation in PCDTBT:[70]PCBM blend films annealed at ≥140 °C that increases the charge recombination and decrease charge extraction in the OPV device with conventional configurations. Although it is not evident from the AFM images (Fig. 3), the PCDTBT wetting layer may also be formed on the PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 blend films annealed at ≥140 °C, and thereby hinder the construction of the electron transport pathway that connected to the TiOx/Al cathode in the OPV devices. This may cause the underestimations of the μe values for the films annealed at ≥140 °C.

The present study has demonstrated that thermal precursor approach enables the formation of blend films with BHJ structures containing highly aggregating pristine C60 molecules in combination with an amorphous conjugated polymer, PCDTBT. Employing C60–9MA bis-adduct as the main component allows us to obtain the precursor solution with sufficient concentrations for solution processes (135 mg mL−1 in ODCB) and remove the solubilizing agent from the spin-coated film without vacuum drying. The PCE value of the OPV devices based on PCDTBT:C60–9MA adducts improved from 0.69% to 3.51% by a factor of ca. 5 associated with significant enhancement of JSC and FF when the device was annealed at 140 °C. One of the factors that hamper the achievement of excellent PCE is the recovery of the π-conjugation and thereby the lowered LUMO levels of fullerenes by the thermal annealing. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the improvement in PCE by using fullerene materials with intrinsically higher LUMO levels such as endohedral metallofullerenes. Fabrication of the OPV devices with the inverted configurations may also pave the way for the superior device performances with suppressing the negative effect of the formation of the polymer wetting layer on top of the heated blend films. With all of the observations combined, we expect that the high-performance thermal precursors to pristine fullerenes obtained in this study will add a new dimension to the solution-processing methodology for fabrication of fullerene-containing blend films.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted with a SHIMADZU TG-60 under flowing nitrogen at a scan rate of 5 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed using an ALS 630A electrochemical analyzer in o-dichlorobenzene/acetonitrile mixture (v:v = 5:1) containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte.

Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured by Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under an argon atmosphere and simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5) with OTENTO-SUN III solar simulator (Bunkoukeiki). Photocurrent action spectra were recorded with CEP-2000RR (Bunkoukeiki). Current–voltage characteristics of the electron-only devices for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were conducted using Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under an argon atmosphere.

All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program. The calculations were performed by the density functional theory (DFT) method with restricted B3LYP (Becke's three-parameter hybrid exchange functionals and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional) level, employing a basis set 6-31G* for C, H and O.


C60 (99.50%) was obtained from MTR Ltd. and used as-received. Phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM, >99.5%) was purchased from American Dye Source, Inc. PCDTBT was prepared according to the reported procedure. All other solvents and chemicals were of reagent-grade quality, purchased commercially, and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography were performed with Silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) and SiliaFlash F60 (230–400 mesh; SiliCycle Inc.), respectively.


In a previous report, C60(9MA) and C60(9MA)2 were prepared by Diels–Alder reaction between C60 and 9MA in CS2 at −20 °C and thermolysis of the obtained C60(9MA) at 180 °C in a solid state, respectively. Here, we conducted the Diels–Alder reaction in toluene at a moderately elevated temperature to obtain C60(9MA)2 more readily, as described below. In a flame-dried 2-neck round-bottom flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar, C60 (300 mg, 0.416 mmol) and 9-methylanthracene (9MA) (800 mg, 4.16 mmol) were dissolved in degassed toluene (150 mL) by sonication for 15 min and stirred at 70 °C for 18 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the reaction mixture was added into methanol. After filtration with a membrane filter, the crude product was purified by silica-gel column chromatography with toluene/hexane (2:3) as eluent. Three fractions were collected, and removal of the solvent provided brown powders (79.0 mg, 224 mg, and 80.4 mg for the first, second, and third fractions, respectively). The first fraction mainly contains the mono-adduct. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3:CS2 = 3:1, ppm): δ 7.72–7.74 (m, 4H); 7.45–7.48 (m, 4H); 5.80 (s, 1H), 2.80 (s, 3H). FTMS (n ESI): found, 912.1, 913.1, 914.1, 915.1; calcd (M + H)−, 912.1. The second fraction mainly contains the bis-adduct. FTMS (n ESI): found, 1105.2, 1106.2, 1107.2; calcd (M + H)−, 1105.2.


Saturated solutions of C60–9MA-1 and C60–9MA-2 were prepared by adding an excess amount of the fullerene materials to organic solvents (ODCB, toluene, and o-xylene) followed by sonication at room temperature for 1 min. Then, the saturated solutions were filtered through a membrane filter (Cosmonice Filter S, COSMOSIL, pore size: 0.45 μm) to remove the aggregates. The amounts of the fullerene materials dissolved in the filtrates were determined by weighing the solid contents that remained after evaporation of the solvent and thorough drying under vacuum.


Indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 5 Ω sq−1 (Geomatec) was used. The substrates were sonicated consecutively with water, chloroform, acetone, semico clean (Furuuti Chemical), 2-propanol, and ethanol. After blow-drying and UV-ozone treatment, the substrates were spin-coated at 1000 rpm and then 4000 rpm with poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P) and dried at 200 °C. For the fabrication of the active layer with bulk heterojunction structure, a mixed solution of polymer ([PCDTBT] = 7 mg mL−1)/fullerene ([C60–9MA-2] = 35 mg mL−1, [[60]PCBM] = 28 mg mL−1) in ODCB were spin-coated at 1000 rpm onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS. After spin coating, thermal annealing of the PCDTBT:C60–9MA-2 film was conducted at 120–180 °C for 20 min. For the fabrication of the buffer layer, a solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol was spin-coated at 4000 rpm onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:fullerene. Then, Al was deposited to obtain the OPV device denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:fullerene/TiOx/Al.

The electron-only devices were fabricated as follows. A 100 nm Al film was first thermally deposited onto the glass substrate. The PCDTBT:fullerene blend film with the same ratio as in the OPV device was spin-coated at 800 rpm. Then, the active layer was annealed and capped by a 100 nm Al electrode.
