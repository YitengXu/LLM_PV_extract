Additives are key to achieving optimal morphologies and efficient performance in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics. In this work we analyze the impact of three insulating polymers [ethylene acrylic elastomers, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate)] in prototypical small molecule and polymer photovoltaic devices. We find that small molecule–semiconductors and polymer–semiconductors vary remarkably in their tolerance of the type of insulator as well as the degree of insulator incorporation. Insulating polymers capable of self-assembly or infiltration into the organic–semiconductor matrix have a positive or negligible impact on the performance of both small molecule and polymer devices. The spontaneous migration of ethylene acrylic elastomers to the device surface make them adverse additives, however our preliminary data indicates their potential application as a spontaneously forming cathode interlayer in small molecule devices where they match or exceed the performance of evaporated LiF interlayers.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising candidates for the development of cost-effective, light weight, flexible solar conversion devices. Recent advances have resulted in devices with more than 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE) through development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture, which allows considerable control over morphology through the formation of interpenetrating donor and acceptor domains. In order to reliably produce BHJ OPVs optimal device thicknesses and morphologies must be accessible from solution through controlled (ideally spontaneous) assembly of the photoactive components. Several strategies have been developed for achieving optimal domains in BHJ cells including solvent annealing, thermal annealing, copolymer assembly and additive incorporation. Though the mechanisms governing these strategies are the subject of continuing study additive use in polymer and small molecule devices has been widely reported to help control donor–acceptor phase separation, tailor domain crystallinity, optimize active-layer thickness, and minimize losses associated with charge extraction while maximizing light absorption. To date the highest efficiency OPVs use additives of one type or another to optimize morphology.

In recent years semiconductor–insulator blends have attracted considerable attention. These blends retain the electronic and optical properties of the semiconducting component even at high insulator incorporation. Substitution of semiconducting polymers with as much as 97% insulator in transistors and 25% insulator in OPVs has little impact and can even improve performance. Similarly, addition of insulating polymers in small molecule devices has led to increases in performance by improving surface wetting and increasing film thickness. Small molecule devices generally employ significantly lower insulator incorporation than conjugated polymer devices due to the greater sensitivity of small molecules to disruption by insulating polymers.
The mechanism for improving both polymer and small molecule devices with insulators remains the subject of ongoing investigation. The formation of isolated insulating domains within the active layer to limit their adverse impact on charge extraction is essential. Further examination of the impact of insulating polymers in OPVs is needed to improve the application of insulting polymers in both polymer and small molecule devices. In this work we investigate the effect of several insulating polymers on the performance of polymer and small molecule devices employing the donors poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and 2,5-di-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-bis-(5′′-n-hexyl-[2,2′,5′,2′′]terthiophen-5-yl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (SMDPPEH), that are both paired with a [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor. P3HT and SMDPPEH were selected due to their commercial availability and established history in conjugated polymer and molecular OPVs. We assess the impact of a range of insulating polymers on device performance, provide structural characterization, and discuss a further application of insulating polymers in OPVs as interlayers.

Ethylene acrylic elastomers (EAE), polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Fig. 1a) were incorporated into SMDPPEH:PC71BM and P3HT:PC71BM devices in a conventional BHJ architecture consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer, solution processable semiconductor blend layer/lithium fluoride (LiF)/aluminum (cathode) (Fig. 1b). The active semiconductor blend of small molecule films were cast from chlorobenzene solutions of SMDPPEH:PC71BM (1:1) with insulating polymers added to the solutions at 0.5, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 weight percent (wt%) of total solid weight. Polymer blends were deposited from ortho-dichlorobenzene solutions of P3HT:PC71BM (1.2:1) with insulating polymers added at 10 wt% of total solid weight. Control devices for both small molecule and polymer devices were prepared from analogous solutions that did not contain insulating polymers.

EAE was selected due to its good solubility in a range of solvents and stability towards thermal degradation. It has never been tested in organic electronic devices. PS and PMMA are well-known commercial polymers, and have been examined in a variety of organic electronic applications. The three polymers enable comparative analysis of the effects of insulating polymers with diverse chemical functionalities and physical properties. Moderate incorporation (10 wt%) was selected for preliminary screening experiments to assess the degree of tolerance of polymer and small molecule devices toward the insulating component.
Small molecule devices exhibited a decrease in performance when the insulators were added relative to control devices with no insulating component (Fig. 1c). This was primarily observed through lower short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). The open circuit voltage (Voc) of all devices matched control values, except for those incorporating EAE. EAE addition at 10 wt% dramatically lowered all device metrics, resulting in a decrease in PCE from 2.7% in control devices to <0.5% with EAE. To further examine the tolerance of SMDPPEH to all additives insulator incorporation was reduced (5, 2.5 and 0.5 wt%) and the devices were examined. Reduced incorporation improves performance primarily due to increases in Jsc. At all levels EAE-containing devices have the poorest performance with lower Jsc and FF than those incorporating PS or PMMA (Table 1). Decreases in Voc were observed with as little as 2.5 wt% EAE incorporation (Fig. 1d). In contrast, devices exhibit the greatest tolerance to PMMA incorporation, with minimal difference in performance between 0.5 and 10 wt% (Table 1).

Devices based on P3HT are only minimally impacted by the incorporation of insulating additives. P3HT:PC61BM exhibits considerable tolerance to incorporation of insulating polymers. In the case of the three insulating polymers examined here, incorporation at 10 wt% results in only modest decreases in current, no change in Voc, and an increase in FF, relative to control devices (Table 2 and Fig. S1, ESI). Unlike the SMDPPEH:PC71BM devices, EAE addition to P3HT:PC71BM has no adverse impact on Voc, and these devices exhibit improved performance relative to both PS and PMMA. Thus it appears that the polymer based devices and small molecule based devices behave in a fundamentally different manner in the presence of these insulting additives.

Variations in current density in both SMDPPEH and P3HT samples impact device performance upon additive incorporation. To examine the impact of additives on recombination, optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were performed on samples of SMDPPEH and P3HT containing 10 wt% of the additives. Absorbance peak shape and vibronic structure is preserved following incorporation of additives (Fig. 2a and Fig S2a, ESI) suggesting that the insulating components had minimal impact on the arrangement of donor domains. All additive containing films have a total absorbance equal to or exceeding that of control samples. Despite the higher absorbance of the additive containing samples they exhibit similar fluorescence intensity relative to control samples (Fig. 2b and Fig S2b, ESI). This suggests additives themselves do not quench excitons. To examine the potential of insulating domains to disrupt charge separation the absorbance and fluorescence spectra of SMDPPEH devices [SMDPPEH:PC71BM (1:1)] and P3HT devices [P3HT:PC71BM (1.2:1)] were obtained. Absorbance spectra again show minimal variation between samples (Fig. 2c and Fig S2c, ESI). In small molecule devices containing PC71BM, the SMDPPEH fluorescence is equal in all samples except those containing EAE (Fig. 2d). The presence of EAE results in a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity, attributed to disruption of charge transfer between SMDPPEH and PC71BM. This suggests that EAE interferes with the formation of an interface between the active components, resulting in increased recombination. In polymer devices minor increases in fluorescence intensity were observed in additive containing samples that may suggest that reduced charge transfer between P3HT and PC71BM is responsible for the small decreases in current density.
Distribution of additives in SMDPPEH devices has a considerable impact on performance. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) was performed to study distribution of additives in the semiconducting active layer through the full depth of the sample. Qualitatively, SIMS analysis shows all additives are heavily retained in the active layer (Fig. 3). PS exhibited the greatest degree of retention in the active layer with few characteristic signals at the interfaces. The retention of PS in the active layer suggests that it may be displacing some semiconducting material, resulting in lower current. In contrast, EAE and PMMA are concentrated within the active layer but are excluded to a greater degree than PS. This does not account for the significant decrease in performance associated with EAE relative to PMMA. While EAE was the sole additive to demonstrate the ability to limit exciton quenching these losses do not account for the substantially lower Voc. In order to further evaluate the impact of the additives, surface analysis of both SMDPPEH and P3HT devices was carried out using atomic force microscopy (AFM).
The localization of insulating polymers in SMDPPEH and P3HT at the device surface (the interface between the active layer and cathode) differs. Minimal changes in the surface topography were observed from AFM in SMDPPEH devices incorporating 10 wt% PS (Fig. 4). This is consistent with SIMS analysis, which showed that the additive polymer was contained within the active layer. In contrast, SMDPPEH devices containing 10 wt% PMMA and EAE have a different surface topography than control and PS devices. PMMA addition produces isolated islands of PMMA while preserving the features of the control sample surface. Higher PMMA content yielded an increase in the number and size of island features (Fig. S3, ESI). EAE containing device surfaces had noticeably different surface profiles than control devices. The change in surface topography at high EAE incorporation levels is suggestive of the formation of a layer of EAE on the surface. In contrast, P3HT samples exhibited similar surface topography with all insulating polymers even at high levels of addition (Fig. S4, ESI). In the case of EAE in P3HT, a top-layer was not observed even at 10 wt% additive. This suggests that the formation of an EAE top-layer is unique to small molecule devices. The inability of additives to freely migrate to the surface in P3HT protects devices from the adverse effects of insulating layers, in agreement with the uniform Voc observed for all polymer–insulator devices (Table 2).
The distinct manner in which the additives assemble in the bulk and on the film surface is responsible for the dramatic difference in their impact on small molecule devices. Additive accumulation was further examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) on samples containing 10 wt% of the respective additives. Additives result in modest alteration of the surface composition of SMDPPEH:PC71BM films by XPS (Table 3). This is evident in SMDPPEH:PC71BM films containing EAE and PMMA primarily through increased presence of oxygen (from the insulator) and decreased presence of nitrogen and sulfur (from SMDPPEH) (Table 3). KPFM provides more detailed information about the electrical properties of the upper surface and how additives interact with the active layer. Surface height and potential were compared for the SMDPPEH:PC71BM films containing 10 wt% of each additive (Fig. 5). In control films (no additives) the contrast between the “leaf-like” PC71BM crystallites and SMDPPEH matrix are observed in the potential images. These distinct domains arise from differences in the surface potential of the semiconducting components. In both PS and PMMA containing samples the SMDPPEH and PC71BM domains are still observed in the potential images suggesting the donor and acceptor domains are still accessible on the surface. Films with high levels of PMMA exhibit distinct features that correspond to the isolated insulating domains.

The presence of EAE results in a distinct potential and adhesion image. In the adhesion image a surface layer containing the PC71BM crystallites is visible and appears embedded in a different matrix. In the potential image however, the PC71BM crystallites are obscured, most likely due to coverage by EAE. Further characterization of the adhesive character of the sample surfaces is consistent with the topography of each sample (Fig. S5, ESI). While the PC71BM is visualized in all samples the EAE and PMMA sample have distinct adhesion behaviour. In PMMA the insulating unit is the source of changes in adhesion that correspond to changes in the topography. In EAE the adhesion appears more uniform and is not as strongly correlated with topography, which is consistent with EAE coating the surface.
The manner by which PMMA and EAE accumulate at the surface dictates whether they have an adverse effect on SMDPPEH devices. At 10 wt% both PMMA and EAE clearly modify the surface. The ability of PMMA to assemble into isolated domains minimizes its adverse impact on films, while the ability of EAE to form a thin insulating top-layer is sufficient to significantly disrupt charge collection. Efficient charge collection depends on the formation of an unimpeded contact between the semiconducting organic layer and the evaporated metal electrode. Characteristic S-shape J–V curves were observed for small molecules incorporating EAE, indicating the accumulation of charge carriers, accounting for the large recombination losses (Fig. S6, ESI). The insulating layer limits charge collection and leads to the observed decrease in PCE, primarily through lower Voc. Combined analysis of SIMS, KPFM and XPS suggests the insulating EAE layer in SMDPPEH devices is less than a few nanometers in thickness with the remaining EAE incorporated into or underneath the film. Profilometry of samples containing 5 wt% of the respective additives indicate modest increases in the thickness (by ∼6 nm) when PS and PMMA is added (Table S1, ESI), and a significant increase in the thickness (by ∼19 nm) when EAE is added. The large increase in thickness for EAE is likely due to its higher solution viscosity, which increases the thickness of spin coated films.
The unique behaviour of additive polymers in small molecule and polymer devices reflects differences in self-assembly, molecular weight, and interaction with the bulk active layer matrix. In small molecule devices the bulk matrix comprises smaller fullerene and SMDPPEH components which allow unhindered assembly of the additives and free migration to the interfaces. In polymer based devices P3HT chains limit the mobility of the additive polymers resulting in greater retention in the active matrix and reduced self-assembly. Contact angle measurements performed on additive films show minimal differences between PS and EAE with some variation compared to the more highly ordered PMMA (Fig. S7, ESI). Thus, differences in performance likely arise based on the molecular weight and ability of the insulating polymers to self-assemble. Specifically, the higher molecular weight of PMMA (350000 MW) leads to an increased propensity to aggregate relative to the lower molecular weight EAE (226000 MW) and PS (192000 MW). The ability of EAE to accumulate on the surface is the result of its lower degree of self-assembly leading to its exclusion from the bulk.
Bulk retention, surface segregation and assembly collectively account for the impact of additives. Polymer and small molecule devices incorporating PS and PMMA all exhibit a decrease in Jsc relative to control devices. In all additive containing devices the insulating component is incorporated into the bulk film suggesting this effect is responsible for the consistent decreases in current density. Exclusion from the active layer, as observed with EAE and PMMA, can result in significant adverse impacts if the additive is capable of hindering charge collection. Though PMMA is clearly present at the sample surface, device metrics show that the isolation of the insulating domains into self-assembled regions results in a negligible change in performance due to decreased disruption of the active layer (as with PS) and no impact on charge collection (as with EAE). From these findings it is clear that ideal additives must balance bulk incorporation with self-assembly.
BHJ devices often employ evaporated cathode interlayers to reduce contact resistance at the active layer–electrode interface, mitigate adverse effects of metal deposition, and enhance device stability. Spontaneous assembly that leads to the formation of interlayers could lead to viable replacements for evaporated interlayers. Given that EAE spontaneously forms a thin top layer on small molecule BHJs we considered whether it could act as a spontaneously forming interlayer. To test this we incorporated low levels of EAE (0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 wt%) in solutions of SMDPPEH:PC71BM (1:1) spin cast onto PEDOT coated ITO. Devices were prepared by direct evaporation of aluminum electrodes onto the spin cast film without lithium fluoride.
Preliminary device results suggest that EAE may serve as spontaneously forming polymer cathode interlayer (Table 4). At 0.1 wt% EAE addition optimal devices matched or exceeded control devices containing LiF. Further examination of devices incorporating EAE as an interfacial layer will help determine the potential of these polymers for use in small molecule OPVs.

We have investigated the effects of a series of structurally diverse commercial insulating polymers on the performance of prototypical small molecule and polymer-based organic photovoltaic devices. We observe significant differences in the tolerance of small molecules and polymers to ternary insulating components. The considerable differences in tolerance are related to the capacity for assembly and migration in the bulk semiconductor matrix. Insulating components with a propensity to assemble into isolated domains have negligible impact on device performance over a range of concentrations in small molecules. The unique ability of EAE to both accumulate in the active layer and spontaneously migrate and form insulating thin films at device interfaces highlights both a key limitation and new opportunity for this type of insulating component. At low content in small molecules devices EAE can improve device performance, while higher content disrupts charge collection and separation. Polymer devices are able to restrict spontaneous migration of additives and their optical and electronic properties are preserved at lower additive content and are less affected at higher additive content regardless of the additive polymer structure. The ability of EAE to migrate to and coat the surface of small molecule devices appears to be unique to the structure of that polymer. This introduces the potential for new types of solution processable cathode interlayers based on commercial insulating polymers. Preliminary efforts suggest optimization of insulating polymer interlayers could lead to performance exceeding that of traditional evaporated materials.


All chemicals were used as received unless otherwise specified. SMDPPEH, polystyrene (192000 MW), poly(methyl methacrylate) (350000 MW), chlorobenzene and ortho-dichlorobenzene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PBDTTT-EFT was purchased from Solarmer Energy Inc.

Ethylene acrylic elastomers (226000 MW as determined by GPC) were supplied by E. I. DuPont Canada.


ITO coated glass substrates (Thin Film Devices Inc.) were successively cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of aqueous detergent, deionized water, acetone and methanol for 10 minutes followed by treatment in an oxygen plasma-cleaner for 15 minutes. PEDOT:PSS solution was filtered through 0.45 μm PVDF filters, spin coated at 3000 rpm onto substrates, and annealed at 135 °C for 15 minutes under ambient conditions before transfer to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. P3HT was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 17 mg mL−1 and was then mixed with PC71BM in a 1.2:1 ratio. SMDPPEH was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and was then mixed with PC71BM in a 1:1 ratio. PBDTTT-EFT was dissolved in chlorobenzene at 14 mg mL−1 and was then mixed with PC71BM in a 1:1.5 ratio. For PDBTTT-EFT 1,8-diiodooctane was added at 3 vol% one hour prior to use. Additive polymers were incorporated into solutions at 0.5, 2.5, 5 or 10 weight percent of total solid mass. Active layers were spin coated at 1000 rpm (for SMDPPEH based devices), 800 rpm (for P3HT based devices) or at 3000 rpm (for PDBTTT-EFT based devices) onto PEDOT coated ITO at room temperature. SMDPPEH and P3HT solutions were first passed through 0.45 μm PTFE filters. PDBTTT-EFT devices were washed with methanol at 4000 rpm 30 minutes after deposition. LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation using an Angstrom Engineering (Kitchener, Ontario) Covap II at 1 × 10−6 Torr. Device areas were 0.07 cm2 as defined by shadow masking. J–V curves were collected with a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G conditions at a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
