Using poly (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as an effective hole collecting layer, high-efficiency PEDOT:PSS/n-Si hybrid solar cells are fabricated and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.13% is obtained. After being treated by HNO3 vapor, the PCE value of PEDOT:PSS/n-Si hybrid solar cells enhances from 12.13% to 13.44%. NO2 gas molecules in HNO3 vapor play a significant doping role in raising the PCE of solar cells. As the doping level raises, NO2 would get more electrons from PEDOT and lead to the increase of hole carriers in the films, which improves the polymer film’s conductivity and PCE of solar cells.

The hybrid solar cells have attracted much attention in recent years due to their high PCE and low costs. In hybrid solar cells, a photovoltaic heterojunction structure could be built between the crystalline silicon and conductive thin films, in which the polymer films are used as functional layers with the advantages of low processing temperature, easy solution operations and low costs. Among them, the conductive hole-transporting polymer of PEDOT:PSS stands out owing to its high transparency, excellent mechanical flexibility and thermal stability. PEDOT:PSS works as a hole collecting layer and forms a heterojunction with n-type crystalline Si, generating a space charge region, where the photo-generated carriers are separated to produce photocurrent.

The first publication about PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells, which has been reported in 2010, inspires the research interests in the PEDOT:PSS/Si solar cells around the world. It is reported that many methods have been used to improve the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si solar cells by optimizing the Si surface structure, the back electrodes or the composition of PEDOT:PSS solutions. Typically, Wan-Rou Wei etc. reported a hierarchical Si surface structure consisting of micro-pyramids and nanowires which enables the omnidirectional light harvesting characteristics of the cells and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 11.48%. Yun fang Zhang etc. found that the Cs2CO3/Al back electrodes could set up a much better ohmic contact than the Al back electrode, which improves the properties from 10.8% to 13.7%. Joseph Palathinkal Thomas etc. reported the prescription optimization of the PEDOT:PSS solution by adding a 0.25 wt% fluorosurfactant (FS) and 7 wt% EG into it, and achieved a PCE of up to 13.3%. Moreover, in order to further improve the efficiency of the cells, chemical treatments have been reported. For example, HNO3 treating has been used in Graphene/Si solar cells to increase the PCE from 5.53% to 9.27% by modulating the work function of graphene leading to a p-type doping in the graphene and a decrease of the sheet resistance. Our group also used HNO3 to treat PEDOT:PSS/n-Si hybrid solar cells in order to improve the properties of the cells. However, the mechanism of HNO3 treating has not been deeply discussed.
Therefore, in this work, Ag/PEDOT:PSS/planar n-Si/Al structure solar cells were fabricated and treated by 70% HNO3 vapor, and the experimental results showed that the HNO3 vapor treatment could significantly improve the PCE value of solar cells from 12.13% to 13.44%. What is more, the influence and mechanism of HNO3 on PEDOT:PSS/planar n-Si hybrid solar cells has been investigated.


Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrate the schematic diagrams and photograph of the Ag/PEDOT:PSS/planar n-Si/Al hybrid solar cell respectively. Fig. 1(c) shows the key fabrication processes of such cells. The cells were fabricated using single crystal n-type Si (100) wafers (Silicon Valley Microelectronics, Inc., USA) with a resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm and a thickness of 525 μm. A 300 nm thick SiO2 layer was thermally grown on the silicon surface as the insulating layer and the backside was etched by BOE (1:6) solution. Then, 200 nm Al layers were deposited backside by electron beam evaporation as the bottom electrodes. An active area of 0.1 cm2 was patterned by lithography and the SiO2 layer in this region was wet etched by BOE solution until the Si surface was exposed, while the un-etched area works as the insulting region. After that, the wafer was cut into small pieces as the cell substrates. The substrates were dipped into diluted HF solution for 10 s immediately after being ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water to remove the native oxide layer of active area. Then PEDOT:PSS (Clevios, PH1000) solutions mixed with EG (7 wt%) and non-ionic surfactant Triton-X100 (TX, 0.25 wt%) were then spin-coated (700 rpm, 10 s; 3000 rpm, 120 s) onto the substrates, followed by thermal annealing processes at 140 °C for 10 min. Finally, silver paste was applied on the PEDOT:PSS films in the insulating region as top electrodes and Ag/PEDOT:PSS/planar n-Si/Al hybrid solar cells were prepared for the electrical measurements.


After the same above processes, other different technologies were be used. Samples 1–4 were treated by 70% HNO3 vapor. As for Sample 5 the prepared PEODOT:PSS solution was mixed with 7% HNO3 solution (5 wt%), and then spin-coated to the silicon substrates. Samples 6–8 were also treated by 70% HNO3 vapor. However, before treated by 70% HNO3 vapor, the PEDOT:PSS films of Sample 6 and the Ag electrodes of Sample 7 were covered. While, the Sample 8 has the same processes as Sample 1, without being covered.


The photovoltaic properties of the cells were measured using a solar simulator (Newport 91195 class A), under air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5G) at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a standard cell unit. The FTIR spectra of the PEDOT:PSS films were recorded using a FT-IR Spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum Two).



Fig. 2(a) shows the light current density–voltage (J–V) curves of four typical cells (Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3 and Sample 4), and the inset shows the dark current of the four cells. It can be seen that these four samples have higher performance with a PCE of 12.13%, 11.84%, 10.47% and 10.97%, respectively. In the experiments, it is found that the performances of the cells enhance after HNO3 treatment and the treatment time affects the cell properties. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the cell was gradually treated with HNO3 vapor from 0 s to 40 s. With the increase of treating time, it could be easily observed that the slope of the curves increases, which means the fill factor (FF) and PCE of the solar cell increase gradually. In order to make the photoelectric parameters change more clearly, the normalized statistical results of the solar cell parameters are shown in Fig. 2(c). It can be concluded that as the treatment time increases (≤40 s), the value of short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) change less than 2% and no definite trend which could be ascribed to the measurement error was observed. While, the values of the PCE and FF have a similar increasing trend. It reveals that HNO3 vapor treatment can improve the FF of the cells which is attributed to the cell performance enhancement. The detailed values of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE for Sample 1 are exhibited in Table 1.

It is clearly seen that the efficiency increases after being treated by HNO3 vapor, and the PCE increases from 12.95% to 13.44% with the treatment time from 10 s to 40 s, respectively. The tendency of other three samples is similar to Sample 1 with HNO3 vapor treatment. The PCE change of the four samples before and after 70% HNO3 vapor treatment has been listed in Fig. 2(d). However, when treated longer than 40 s by HNO3 vapor, the performance of solar cells would decrease. The particular results of treating time from 40 s to 110 s have been listed in Fig. S1 (ESI).
Concentrated HNO3 vapor will volatile and decompose which can be illuminated as:
Therefore, the HNO
3 vapor contains NO2, O2 and HNO3 mist. As an ionic compound, NO2− ions are the most significant parts in HNO3. In order to make sure whether NO2− ions indeed work on the cells, Sample 5 was fabricated. J–V curves of Sample 1 and Sample 5 before and after HNO3 vapor treatment have been shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). And, other values of Sample 1 and Sample 5 have been listed in Table 2. Compared to the Sample 1, Sample 5 displays no enhancement but decreases, including dark situation and light situation. Also, the change of the PCE value is more clearly listed in Fig. 3(c). It indicates that NO2− ions have no distinct improving effect on the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si solar cells, which implies that NO2 molecules volatilized from HNO3 vapor play an important role in the property enhancement.

In order to further prove the effect of NO2 on the performance of PEDOT:PSS/Si solar cells, we design experiments to testify whether NO2 from HNO3 vapor works on the PEDOT:PSS films or the Ag electrodes. Samples 6–8 were fabricated as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). The three samples were then treated in HNO3 vapor and their resistances were real time tested. It is found that Sample 6 shows no resistance change with treatment time, but the resistance of Sample 7 decreases quickly with the treatment time in the former 75–100 s and then keeps a stable status. In order to cover all the Ag electrodes in Sample 7, we have to cover a litter part of PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, during HNO3 vapor treating, some area of PEDOT:PSS would not be treated, which of course makes the resistance change of Sample 7 is smaller than the Sample 8. Above all, it indicates that NO2 treatment has no effect on the Ag/PEDOT:PSS contact, but just improves the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films. The resistance of Sample 8 significantly decreases with the exposure time in HNO3 vapor till the resistance of PEDOT:PSS films lowers nearly 30%. As we know, the FF is relevant to series resistance (Rs). So, the FF would increase with decreasing Rs, and then leads to PCE enhancement. What is more, in order to more precisely determine that the improvement is from NO2, another NO2 gas-sensitive experiment would be set out and the result is shown in Fig S2 (ESI). Thus, the stability of HNO3 vapor treating was investigated in Fig. S3 (ESI).
As reported by Hua Bai etc., NO2, as an electron acceptor, could remove electrons from the films with the aromatic rings, and Fig. 5(a) illustrate the chemical reaction between PEDOT and NO2 molecules. When PEDOT:PSS films contact with the NO2 gas molecules, PEDOT gives electrons to NO2 producing NO2− ion groups, and simultaneously, holes are obtained in PEDOT:PSS films. It indicates that NO2 has a p-doping effect on PEDOT and the doping level of NO2 increases with the increase of HNO3 vapor treating time, which results in a large number of holes produced in PEDOT:PSS films. The PEDOT:PSS films before and after HNO3 vapor treating were also characterized by the FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), the similarities and differences between them could be easily found. The FTIR bands near 1010 cm−1 and 1653 cm−1 are the intrinsic absorption spectra of PSS and PEDOT. However, the FTIR bands near 1305 cm−1 appear in HNO3 vapor-treated PEDOT:PSS films which suggests the vibrating modes of N–O. At the same time, the FTIR bands of PSS and PEDOT do not clearly shift. This reveals that NO2 in HNO3 vapor does not react with PEDOT or PSS but only exchanges the electrons with PEDOT.
Therefore, due to the charge transfer effect of NO2, the holes in PEDOT:PSS films would increase. As a hole transport layer, the increase of holes would improve the conductivity of the films, and then lead to the resistance reduction. The decrease of resistance could improve the FF value, which finally deduces the property enhancement of the PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells.

In summary, PEDOT:PSS/n-Si hybrid solar cells with a high performance have been fabricated, which exhibit a Jsc of 32.73 mA cm−2, a Voc of 578.7 mV and an FF of 64.04%. What is more, the value of PCE increases from 12.13% to 13.44% after HNO3 vapor treatment. It is found that NO2 volatilized from HNO3 vapor plays an important role in the property enhancement of the cells. PEDOT gives electrons to NO2 producing NO2− ion groups, and more holes are obtained in PEDOT:PSS films, which would enhance the conductivity of PEDOT. It indicates that NO2 has a p-doping effect on PEDOT, which improves FF values and PCE of the PEDOT:PSS/n-Si hybrid solar cells.
