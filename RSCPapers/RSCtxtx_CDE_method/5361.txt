In this work, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets are successfully introduced into the conductive polypyrrole (PPy) matrix as conductive channels and co-catalyst, through simple incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) into PPy and subsequent in situ reduction from GO/PPy to RGO/PPy composite film. The RGO/PPy film is fabricated as a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells, and it exhibits excellent catalytic performance for reduction of triiodide. For this reason, the incorporated RGO sheets significantly improve short-circuit photocurrent density from 14.27 to 15.81 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency from 7.11% to 8.14%, which is comparable with that for the cell based on a Pt cathode.

Since the seminal paper published by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received widespread scientific and technological attention because of their simplicity of fabrication and cost-effectiveness compared with silicon based photovoltaic devices. Recently, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE), 12.3%, under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) sunlight was achieved by Yella and co-workers. Usually, a DSSC comprises a dye sensitized TiO2 nanocrystalline film as a working electrode, an electrolyte containing a redox couple iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) and a platinum (Pt) coated conductive glass as a counter electrode (CE). The operation of the DSSC involves the photoexcitation of the sensitizer, followed by ultrafast electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2 film. The dye molecule is regenerated by I−, which is oxidized to I3− and then restored through the reduction of I3− at the CE interface.

As one significant component, CE fulfils electrocatalyzing reduction of I3− to I− by the electrons flowing through the external circuit, which is responsible for photocurrent and PCE in a cell. Pt is an excellent electrocatalyst for reducing triiodide due to its outstanding conductivity, electrocatalytic activity and stability. However, the high price prevents Pt from being used for large-scale manufacturing of DSSCs, which stimulates great efforts to develop competent substitutes in order to reduce the overall cost and simultaneously retain the performance of DSSCs. Several carbonaceous materials, such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes and graphene, have been proposed as CEs to replace Pt in DSSCs. Also, some conductive polymers, such as poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene), polyaniline and polypyrrole, were introduced to DSSCs as cathodes for catalyzing I3− reduction and good results were obtained. Among these polymers, polypyrrole (PPy) has been considered as one of the most promising electrode materials on account of its low cost, easy synthesis and relatively high conductivity. Although PPy nanoparticles (NPs) show considerable potential for application as cost-effective CE in DSSCs, electron conduction within conductive polymer film may be hindered by random boundaries between particles, which would cause loss of photocurrent in the cell circuit, and further affect photovoltaic performance.
It is well known that graphene is a zero band gap material and has an excellent electrical conduction in two dimensions even at temperatures close to absolute zero and the Dirac point. The incorporation of graphene in the PPy matrix may improve the electron collection and conduction within the conductive polymer film. To the best of our knowledge, no research explores polypyrrole in conjugation with graphene as a CE for DSSCs. In this work, we propose reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets embedded in PPy NPs film as conductive channels and co-catalyst to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. The results reveal that the incorporation of RGO sheets in the PPy matrix significantly enhances photocurrent and PCE of DSSC due to improved electrical conductivity. The cell with RGO/PPy CE produces a PCE of 8.14%, which is better than that of PPy CE (7.11%) and comparable with that for Pt CE based DSSC (8.34%).

PPy NPs were prepared by a chemical polymerization method described as follows. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 2.4 mmol, Alading Reagent Inc.) was dissolved in 95 mL deionized water with stirring for 1 h. Then, a distilled pyrrole monomer (3.6 mmol, Alading Reagent Inc.) was added to the solution and stirred for another 1 h, followed by dropping ferric chloride (FeCl3, Acros Organics) solution (7.2 mmol dissolved in 5 mL water) into the above solution. After polymerization for 6 h at room temperature, the resulting black precipitate was filtered and washed with ethanol and distilled water several times for purification, and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h.

GO was synthesized from natural graphite powder (Alading Reagent Inc.) via the modified Hummers method. First, pre-oxidized graphite powder was synthesized through reaction of graphite powder (2 g), concentrated H2SO4 (3 mL), K2S2O8 (1 g), and P2O5 (1 g) at 80 °C for 6 h. The mixture was then carefully diluted with distilled water, filtered, and washed until the rinsed water pH became neutral. The product was dried in air at 60 °C overnight. This dry pre-oxidized graphite (2 g) was then put into cold (0 °C) concentrated H2SO4 (46 mL). KMnO4 (6 g) was added into the mixture gradually with stirring and cooling. The mixture was then stirred at 35 °C for 2 h, and distilled water (92 mL) was carefully added. In 15 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of a large amount of distilled water (280 mL) and 30% H2O2 solution (5 mL), after which the color of the mixture changed to bright yellow. The mixture was filtered and copiously washed with 1:10 HCl solution and water. The GO product was dried in air at 60 °C overnight. The RGO suspension was synthesized by hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) reduction of 0.25 mg mL−1 exfoliated GO suspension in water, which was obtained by mild ultrasonication for 0.5 h, according to the literature. For preparing GO/PPy NPs composite, 10 mg PPy NPs and 1.5 mg GO were dispersed in 10 mL absolute alcohol with the assistance of ultrasonication, and the mixture without macroscopical aggregates could be obtained. We have prepared several samples with various mass ratios, such as 0.5/10, 1/10, 1.5/10, 2/10, and 2.5/10. The 1.5/10 ratio gave the best electrocatalytic performance, so we selected this ratio to conduct the experiments through this work. As we focus on the effect of incorporation of RGO in PPy, we did not study the solar cell performance with various ratios.

The CEs with three catalytic materials, viz. RGO, PPy NPs and RGO/PPy, were fabricated through a simple drop-cast method. A certain amount of RGO, PPy or GO/PPy suspension was drop-casted onto conductive glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, FTO glass, 15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd.), which was masked by a 3M Scotch tape with an exposed area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The films were dried on a heating plate at 50 °C. For comparison, the loading amount of catalysts (RGO, PPy, or the mixture amount) for the three CEs were controlled at ∼0.5 mg cm−2. Whereafter, the PPy CE was dipped in 0.2 M HCl aqueous solution for 5 min and rinsed with water before sufficient drying. The GO/PPy composite loaded electrode was immersed in 0.05% N2H4·H2O solution and in situ reduced at 95 °C for 2 h, followed by the same procedure as treatment for PPy CE. For contrastive analysis under the same conditions, pyrolytic Pt CE was also prepared by deposition of 50 μL H2PtCl6 in ethanol (5 mM) on a 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 FTO glass followed by 400 °C heat treatment for 30 min.

15 μm-thick TiO2 films were coated on FTO glass using a screen-printing method according to a previous paper. TiO2 films were soaked overnight in the cis-di(isothiocyanato)-bis-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutyl-ammonium (the so-called N719) solution (Lumtec Corp., 0.3 mM in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol by a volume ratio of 1:1). The dye-loaded TiO2 film as the working electrode and the CE were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm thick) and sealed together by hot-pressing. The iodine based redox electrolyte (0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine using anhydrous acetonitrile as a solvent) was injected into the interspace between the photoanode and CE through a predrilled hole (all materials were obtained from Acros and Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, the hole was sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra for the products were recorded on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 FTIR spectrometer. The Raman scattering measurements are performed at 25 °C using a Renishaw spectrometer at 633 nm, and 100× objective is used. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL) were employed to study the morphologies of the composites. Measurements of the apparent electrical conductivities of the pressed samples were carried out at an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany). To investigate the catalytic activity and electrochemical behavior of the various CEs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were executed at the electrochemical workstation mentioned above. CV was carried out in a three-electrode system containing an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, using a platinum wire as the counter electrode, the graphene based CEs as the working electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the pseudo-reference electrode, which was calibrated with a ferrocene solution after the CV measurements. Symmetrical sandwich cells filled with the redox electrolyte between two identical CEs were fabricated and used for the EIS measurements. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91193 equipped with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5 filter), and light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). The DSSC was fully covered with a black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 to avoid stray light during measurements. Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained using an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel Instruments).



Fig. 1a presents the FTIR spectra for GO, RGO, PPy, GO/PPy and RGO/PPy products. For GO, the characteristic peaks appear for carbonyl CO stretching vibration (1734 cm−1), aromatic CC stretching vibration (1626 cm−1), carboxy C–O stretching vibration (1404 cm−1), C–OH stretching vibration (1224 cm−1), and epoxy C–O stretching vibration (1058 cm−1). After chemical reduction, the peaks (the curve for RGO) for the oxygen functional groups were reduced significantly or entirely vanished. The remaining peaks at 1574 and 1224 cm−1 are attributed to the aromatic CC and residual –OH. The results are in coincidence with a previous report. It is clearly seen that the characteristic polypyrrole peaks are located at 1562 and 1472 cm−1, due to the stretching vibrations of pyrrole rings. The peaks at 1215 and 941 cm−1 indicate the doping state of polypyrrole. Furthermore, the peaks at 1329 and 1052 cm−1 are attributed to C–N stretching vibrations and C–H deformation vibrations, respectively. Because minor amount of GO nanosheets are mixed into PPy dispersion, the FTIR spectra for GO/PPy and RGO/PPy present similar peaks to pure PPy. For GO/PPy composite, weak GO absorption peaks at 1710 and 1385 cm−1 appear, which should be the red shifted carbonyl CO and carboxy C–O absorption peaks due to the π–π interaction between PPy and GO sheet. The two peaks disappear after in situ reduction, which can prove that the in situ reduction in 0.05% N2H4·H2O solution is effective for the GO/PPy composite film.

The Raman spectra for pure GO, RGO, PPy and GO/PPy, RGO/PPy composites are illustrated in Fig. 1b. The spectrum of GO displays two prominent bands located at 1594 cm−1 (G band) and 1335 cm−1 (D band), which are usually assigned to zone center phonons of E2g symmetry and K-point phonons of A1g symmetry, respectively. Thus, the intensity ratio of the D and G band (ID/IG) is usually taken as an indication of the relative disorder present in graphitic structures. The spectrum of RGO also contains both G and D bands (at 1583 and 1334 cm−1). The G band shifts from 1594 to 1583 cm−1, which confirms the reduction of GO during the chemical treatment. Furthermore, the ID/IG varies from 1.10 to 1.37. This change suggests a decrease in the average size of the sp2 domains upon reduction of the exfoliated GO. For pure PPy, the spectrum has two broad peaks at 1577 and 1338 cm−1, attributed to the CC backbone stretching and the ring stretching mode of PPy, respectively, and the intensity ratio ID/IG is ∼0.93. The Raman spectrum of the GO/PPy composite shows the bands for PPy, and the ID/IG value and peak positions are between the corresponding values for GO and PPy. ID/IG of the spectrum for RGO/PPy increased from 1.03 to 1.08, implying that GO embedded in PPy film could be converted to RGO after in situ reduction.
The morphologies of the composites or as-prepared CEs were characterized using HRTEM and FESEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, the PPy NPs assume spherical shape with 80–100 nm diameters. When GO sheets were added into PPy NPs dispersion, the particle aggregates could be tightly wrapped by GO sheets, which could be seen from the wrinkles of GO sheets in Fig. 2b. FESEM images depict the surface morphologies of PPy and RGO/PPy CEs (Fig. 2c and d). The PPy NPs loosely pack together and form a porous structure which facilitates the electrolyte permeation within the PPy film. The inserted RGO sheets serve as scaffolds and the PPy NPs are wrapped tightly or supported by RGO, and a porous structure can also be obtained, as shown in Fig. 2d and its inset.

To investigate the effect on the electrical conductivity by incorporating RGO in the PPy matrix, pressed samples of PPy NPs and RGO/PPy composite (with same area and thickness) were prepared for simple current–voltage test (see ESI, Fig. S1). The incorporation of RGO sheets into the PPy film dramatically increases the current from 63.3 μA to 2.51 mA when the voltage is 1 V, which means that the embedded RGO sheets could significantly enhance the conductivity of PPy film and thus the charge transportation within the conductive polymer matrix.

CV is an efficient tool for analyzing the electrochemical catalytic activities of CEs for reducing I3− under the same conditions. As depicted in Fig. 3, two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox-1/Red-1, Ox-2/Red-2, as labeled in Fig. 3) are well resolved in the range of −1 V to 1 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) except the RGO CE. The left and right pairs are assigned to eqn (1) and (2), respectively. In view of that the CE is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−, the characteristics of peaks Ox-1 and Red-1 are at the focus of our analysis. In addition, the peak currents and the peak to peak separation (Epp) that is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction are two important parameters for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs. The CV curve for the PPy electrode exhibits an obvious Red-1 peak at −0.53 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), which is, however, absent for the RGO CE, which means that PPy CE has better catalytic activity than RGO CE. With RGO sheets integrated in PPy film, the peak currents are greatly enhanced from PPy to RGO/PPy CE. Moreover, Epp for Ox-1 and Red-1 is reduced from 0.92 to 0.70 V upon incorporation of RGO in PPy. These results indirectly prove that the embedded RGO sheets could efficiently meliorate the charge collection and transportation within the PPy film. Also, the enhanced electrocatalytic activity should result from more catalytic sites on the co-catalytic RGO sheets.
To test the stability of the CEs, consecutive 50 cyclic voltammograms for the CEs were recorded, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). The peak currents attenuated significantly for the PPy and RGO electrodes whereas the peak currents decreased slightly for the RGO/PPy electrode after consecutive 50 CV scans, indicating that the RGO/PPy electrode was more stable than the two single-component CEs for the iodine based electrolyte. The improved stability likely resulted from the structure of RGO/PPy composite, where PPy NPs were encapsulated by RGO. For comparison, the stability of the Pt CE was also tested, and we found that the RGO/PPy electrode had a comparable good stability with Pt CE.

Fig. 4a gives the cyclic voltammograms of RGO/PPy CE at various scan rates. The cathodic peak shifts to the negative direction and the corresponding anodic peak shifts to the positive direction gradually and regularly, and the current densities increase with the increasing scan rate. The anodic and cathodic peak current densities show good linear relationship with square root of the scan rate (Fig. 4b), which reveals that the redox reactions (eqn (1)) on the surface of the RGO/PPy electrode are controlled by ionic diffusion in the electrolyte, and the transfer rate of both electrons and ions are fast enough for the reduction rate of I3− on the surface of RGO/PPy CE. This result also suggests that the adsorption of iodide species is hardly affected by the redox reaction on the RGO/PPy CE surface and no specific interaction occurred between I−/I3− and the electrode.
To further elucidate the catalytic activities of different CEs on the reduction of triiodide, EIS measurements were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots at different impedance ranges of the symmetric cells with various CEs. According to the equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 5b), the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the ohmic series resistance (Rs) of the device. The left arc arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, which changes inversely with the catalytic activity of different CEs on the reduction of triiodide, and the constant phase element (CPE), while the right one stems from the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte. In these parameters, Rct is the most intuitive one for evaluating the electrochemical catalyst. The EIS spectrum for RGO displays the largest Rct, indicating the lowest catalytic ability. Rct for PPy is 15.5 Ω cm2, which is significantly reduced to 5.0 Ω cm2 when RGO sheets are embedded in the PPy matrix. This reflects the improved conductivity of PPy and the acceleration of the electron transfer process at RGO/PPy CE/electrolyte interface with the RGO sheets as a dopant. Besides improving conductivity, the integrated RGO sheets can also catalyze the reduction of I3−. Thus, the lower Rct value of RGO/PPy CE should be a comprehensive result. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 6 compares the photovoltaic performance of N719 sensitized solar cells assembled with various cathodes, and the derived photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC with RGO CE exhibits a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.54 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 715 mV, and fill factor (FF) of 0.34, yielding a PCE of 3.05%. In contrast, the cell based on PPy CE produces a PCE of 7.11% with Jsc = 14.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 722 mV and FF = 0.69. The DSSC with the PPy CE is superior to that with the RGO CE particularly in Jsc and FF, attributed to the much higher electrocatalytic activity (smaller Rct) for PPy CE. Upon incorporation of RGO in PPy, Jsc is improved significantly while FF is raised slightly, resulting in much improved PCE. The increased FF is also attributed to the reduced Rct. The much improved Jsc is the collective effect of smaller Rct and increased catalytic sites due to the enhanced conductivity in the presence of RGO. For DSSC devices with different CEs but others keeping the same, Jsc is determined by the electron collecting efficiency, which is influenced by the electrocatalytic performance of the CE. A smaller Rct indicates a higher catalytic performance and should result in higher Jsc. The device assembled with RGO/PPy CE produces a PCE of 8.14% with Jsc = 15.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 725 mV and FF = 0.71, respectively, which are comparable with those for Pt CE based DSSC (PCE = 8.34% with Jsc = 16.00 mA cm−2, Voc = 724 mV and FF = 0.72). By using the PPy CE, the efficiency obtained in this work is slightly lower than the reported results. For example, 7.73% with PPy CE versus 8.20% with Pt CE was obtained by Kim et al. However, the efficiency (8.14%) obtained from the PPy/RGO CE in this work is higher than that (7.2%) with PPy/carbon CE as reported by Peng et al., where the efficiency for Pt CE was 7.8% under the same conditions.

Fig. S3 (ESI) presents the IPCE spectra of the DSSCs with different CEs. The IPCEs of all of the cells were maximized at around 530 nm, which reflects the maximum absorption of the N719 dye. The IPCEs between 400 and 700 nm increase in the order of RGO < PPy < RGO/PPy < Pt, which is consistent with the Jsc trend.

In conclusion, RGO sheets have been successfully introduced in the PPy NPs matrix as conductive channels and co-catalyst for the cathode of DSSCs by in situ reduction of GO/PPy composite deposited on conductive glass. The presence of RGO sheets greatly improves the catalytic performance of PPy CE, resulting in enhancement of the Jsc and PCE for the cell. We conclude that the RGO sheets remarkably reduce the resistance of electron transportation within the PPy film, which is verified by electrochemical characterization. The obtained PCE for the DSSC with the RGO/PPy electrode achieves 8.14%, which is higher than PPy CE by ∼14%, and comparable with that for the Pt-based cell (8.34%), indicating that the incorporation of RGO is an efficient means for enhancing the photovoltaic performance based on the conductive polymer cathode. The cheapness and facility of this strategy may have a considerable significance in fabrication of highly efficient and cost-effective DSSCs.
