It is demonstrated that the use of silica-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the buffer layer improves the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). It is found that only large sized AgNPs are advantageous for increasing the electric field distribution in the active layer, and therefore, increasing light absorption, caused by the localized surface plasmonic resonance and far-field scattering. Furthermore, the scattering of silica-coated AgNPs is more important to the light harvesting because of the existence of the silica coating. It is also demonstrated that the silica coating is favorable for enhancing the exciton dissociation because of the reduction of the exciton quenching that occurred at the interface between the bare AgNPs and the active layer. Furthermore, silica-coated AgNPs also promote hole transport and extraction, which is presumably explained by the introduction of “dopant” levels within the band gap of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) and reduction of hole trapping of a bare silver surface. The combination of all these benefits results in a 25.4% improvement in photocurrent density and an increase of 19.2% in power conversion efficiency. This work indicates that using silica-coated AgNPs as light trapping elements is more efficient than using bare AgNPs in plasmonic organic solar cells. The systematic exploration of the optical and electrical effects of silica-coated AgNPs contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of performance improvement of the plasmonic OSCs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have great potential as a clean and renewable energy source because of the solution-based fabrication process, their light weight, transparency as well as their compatibility with large area flexible substrates. At the moment, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is less satisfactory when compared to their inorganic counterparts. One of the limitations is insufficient light absorption in the thin organic photoactive layers. Absorption enhancement in OSCs cannot be simply realized by using a thicker active layer because of the mismatch between the optical absorption length and the charge transport scale, which is caused by the low carrier mobility in organic materials. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to effectively enhance light absorption in the active layer without increasing its thickness. Different approaches have been reported including incorporating metal nanoparticles (NPs) and periodic surface plasmonic structures in OSCs to boost light absorption. In OSCs with metal NPs incorporated in them, the metal NPs function as sub-wavelength antennas; the increase of the absorption in the active layer is attributed to the enhanced electromagnetic field because of the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). However, metal NPs, serving as scattering centers, also increase the length of the optical path contributing to light absorption enhancement in the solar cells.

In research up to the present time, the metal NPs with different materials, shapes, and sizes have been introduced into various layers in the OSCs. The plasmonic OSCs seem attractive, but there exist significant challenges as well. There are some controversial reports, about their favorable and unfavorable effects on the performance of OSCs. Although light absorption enhancement in OSCs based on metal NPs was observed, the bare metal NPs in the active layer also induce charge recombination and exciton quenching near the vicinity of metal surface because of the dipole–dipole and charge-trapping coupling. Therefore the electrical losses because of the undesired exciton quenching and charge-trapping offset the optical enhancement generated by the metal NPs. In order to avoid the exciton quenching and charge-trapping and maintain the advantage of the absorption enhancement induced by the metal NPs, the strategy of forming a thin dielectric layer coated metal NP was proposed. The solution of placing the metal NPs outside the active layer is more effective for improving the absorption in the cells, and thereby the PCE, resulting from the LSPR and/or far-field scattering of metal NPs. But Choy et al. suggested that the strong near field around gold nanoparticles has a limited contribution to the light absorption enhancement in the active layer as the LSPR effect is mainly distributed laterally along the anode/buffer layer interface. The improvement in PCE originates from the enlarged contact area between the active layer and the buffer layer and improved the conductivity of the buffer layer.
In this research, the large size silica-coated silver nanoparticles (Ag@SiO2NPs) were incorporated in the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) buffer layer to improve the PCE. Indeed, incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs in the interface of the active layer/buffer layer for improving PCE has been reported by other groups. The difference with the existing research is that here Ag@SiO2NPs are incorporated within the buffer layer and some large NPs are able to protrude partly into the active layer. This solution has advantages in improving the PCE by: (1) increasing light absorption in the active layer by inducing simultaneously the far-field scattering effect and laterally distributed LSPR, caused by the large size Ag@SiO2NPs; (2) reducing exciton quenching occurring at the interface between bare metal and the active layer by coating AgNPs using a SiO2 insulating thin layer and thus increasing exciton dissociation; (3) promoting hole transport and extraction by introducing “dopant” levels within the band gap of the PEDOT:PSS and reducing hole trapping in the bare silver surface; and (4) the way that Ag@SiO2 is positioned is less disturbing to the morphology of the active layer, which is also a key factor for a high PCE. The combination of all these benefits results in 25.4% improvement in photocurrent density and 19.2% in PCE when compared to the optimized control cell without NPs. These results confirm that such a positioning of Ag@SiO2 leads to an excellent OSC compared to placing the Ag@SiO2NPs in the interface active layer/buffer layer, which is the method adopted in the literature. This work offers a more optimized design for the Ag@SiO2NPs integrated OSC. Additionally, the optical and electrical effects of Ag@SiO2 NPs were systematically explored to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of improvement of performance for the Ag@SiO2NPs integrated OSC.

The AgNPs and the Ag@SiO2NPs were synthesized using a simple and low cost wet chemical method. Firstly, the ethylene glycol reduction agent was used to reduce the silver ions (Ag+) in silver nitrate forming AgNPs in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) at a high temperature. The size of the AgNPs could be tuned by controlling the amount of PVP used and the reaction temperature. After reaction at 120–130 °C for 1 h, the AgNPs were collected by centrifugation and washed sequentially several times using ethanol and water. Next, the AgNPs were then encapsulated with silica in the following way: the homogeneous Ag in ethanol solution was mixed with ammonium hydroxide with stirring, and then tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was slowly injected with continuous stirring. The reaction was continued for 6 h. The Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation and washed sequentially several times using ethanol and water. The thickness of the silica coating layer increases gradually with increase of the TEOS doping ratio in the reaction.


The OSCs which have Ag@SiO2 incorporated in them have the device structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS:Ag@SiO2NPs (30 nm)/poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC60BM, 220 nm)/lithium fluoride (LiF, 1 nm)/Al (150 nm), as shown in Fig. 1(a). ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then treated using ultraviolet (UV) ozone. An approximately 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer with different Ag@SiO2 doping ratios was spin-coated onto ITO at 3500 rpm for 60 s, and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min in air. Next, a 220 nm active layer was spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS using the P3HT (9 mg ml−1) and PC60BM (9 mg ml−1) blend solution in chlorobenzene at 600 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the devices were completed by deposition of a top electrode (LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm)), which was then thermally evaporated in a vacuum with a base pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. A set of structurally identical control OSCs with and without AgNPs were also fabricated for comparison studies. The cross-sectional view of the control cells is shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c).


Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images of the AgNPs and Ag@SiO2NPs were measured using a fifth-order, aberration corrected STEM (Nion UltraSTEM 100) with a cold field emission electron source. The absorption spectra of the pristine AgNPs and Ag@SiO2NPs in ethanol solution were measured using a UV-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900) at room temperature. The absorption spectra of the multilayer film (MLF) of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM with and without NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer were also recorded using the same measurement system. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices in the dark and under illumination were measured using a programmable SourceMeter (Keithley 2400). The cells were illuminated using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (ABET Technologies Sun 3000 Solar Simulator) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a standard silicon cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength was recorded using ZOLIX CSC1011, where the light source is provided by an Ushio UXL-553 xenon short arc lamp.


STEM images of AgNPs and Ag@SiO2NPs are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). It is found that the diameter size distribution of the majority of nanoparticles is over the range 15 nm to 36 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(a). But there exist some small sized NPs that have diameters in the range from 2 nm to 10 nm in the samples. It is also clearly seen from Fig. 1(b) that the Ag@SiO2NPs were successfully synthesized. The silica shell with an average layer thickness from 6 nm to 8 nm is coated uniformly and completely on the surface of the individual AgNPs. Fig. 2(c) shows that the UV-vis absorption spectra of Ag@SiO2NPs and AgNPs dispersed in ethanol solution. The absorption peak of AgNPs from the LSPR is localized at 404 nm, while that of Ag@SiO2NPs is red shifted to 414 nm.

To investigate the effect of Ag@SiO2NPs on the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, devices made with and without Ag@SiO2NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer were measured for comparison studies. Fig. 3(a) and (b) present J–V characteristics measured for OSCs made with different doping ratios of Ag@SiO2NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer under illumination and in the dark.
Performance parameters of OSCs made with different doping ratios of Ag@SiO2NPs in PEDOT:PSS, and the optimized control cells with and without incorporating AgNPs are summarized in Table 1. The open circuit voltage (Voc) remains almost a constant of about 0.6 V for all devices, while the short circuit current density (Jsc) increases dramatically after incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer. Jsc increases gradually with the doping ratio of Ag@SiO2NPs increase from 0 to 3 mg ml−1, but begins to decrease as the doping ratio of Ag@SiO2NPs increases to 4 mg ml−1. For 3 mg ml−1 Ag@SiO2 NPs, Jsc is increased to 9.67 mA cm−2 with a 25.4% enhancement factor relative to the control cell without NPs. The existence of the optimal doping ratio is presumably because of the transformation of incident light to thermal loss caused by the intrinsic absorption of Ag@SiO2NPs; alternatively, it could be associated with the disturbed transport and extraction of charge carriers by Ag@SiO2NPs, which will be discussed below. On the whole, the fill factor (FF) decreases with the increase in the doping ratio of Ag@SiO2NPs. It has been well known that the FF is associated with series and shunt resistances, which can be obtained from the inverse slope of illuminated J–V curves at short-circuit and open-circuit voltage, respectively. The smaller the series resistance (Rs) and the larger the shunt resistance (Rsh), the larger the FF. One can see from Table 1 that the series resistances are slightly reduced, while the shunt resistances are greatly decreased as the doping ratio of Ag@SiO2NPs increases, leading, as a result, to the decreased FF. But the enhancement of Jsc overwhelms the reduction of FF so that a PCE of 3.35% with 19.2% enhancement factor was obtained for the optimized Ag@SiO2NPs-integrated cell relative to the control cell without NPs. Fig. 3(b) presents the J–V characteristics of the OSCs made with different doping ratios of Ag@SiO2NPs in the dark. It can be seen from Fig. 3(b) that the current rectification ratio of OSCs decreases and leakage current increases after incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs. The highly elevated leakage current is consistent with the significant decrease of the shunt resistance of the Ag@SiO2-integrated OSCs. Incorporating the Ag@SiO2NPs into the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer could induce some interface defects. Furthermore, the small AgNPs existing in the sample could not be coated by SiO2, which introduces the surface recombination centers. These defects and impurities result in the recombination current, which is responsible for the elevated leakage current density at the driving voltage of less than 0.5 V and then the reduced shunt resistance.

As a comparison, Fig. 3(c) and (d) present J–V characteristics of the optimal OSCs with and without NPs under illumination and in the dark. The Jsc of the optimized OSC with Ag@SiO2NPs is noticeably higher than that of the optimized control cells with AgNPs. It is also found from Fig. 3(d) that the AgNP integrated OSCs possess a smaller shunt resistance and higher leakage current than that of the cells with Ag@SiO2NPs. This may be ascribed to the larger loss of charges because of recombination and because they are trapped in the bare metal surface.
To better elucidate the increment of Jsc, the EQE spectra of the optimized cells with and without NPs were measured, as shown in Fig. 4(a). It was observed that the larger enhancement in EQE is achieved by incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs rather than AgNPs, which is in agreement with the change tendency of Jsc. The EQE enhancement factor is calculated by subtracting the EQE of the cell without NPs from that of the cell with Ag@SiO2NPs and then dividing by the EQE of the cell without NPs, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). A broad increase in EQE over a wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm is displayed for the Ag@SiO2NP integrated OSCs relative to the control cell without NPs.
To understand the enhancement in EQE, the optical effects of NPs were investigated. The absorption spectra of the MLF of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM with and without NPs in PEDOT:PSS were measured, as shown in Fig. 4(b). And the absorption enhancement factor was obtained by subtracting the absorption spectrum of the MLF without NPs from that of the MLF with Ag@SiO2NPs and then dividing by the absorption spectrum of the MLF without NPs, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b). It was found that the EQE enhancement is highly dependent on the absorption enhancement of the active layer, but there also exists some mismatch between them. This means that EQE is also related to the electrical effects such as carrier transport and collection, except for the light harvesting.
One can see from the inset of Fig. 4(b) that a broad increase in absorption of P3HT:PC60BM over a wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm is obtained by incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs into the MLF, mismatching with the narrow plasmonic resonance spectrum of Ag@SiO2NPs (see Fig. 2(c)). It is suggested that this inconsistency could originate from the far-field scattering effect of Ag@SiO2NPs. To confirm this hypothesis, the distributions of the electric field, |E|, at 580 nm under transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized light were investigated for the OSCs with Ag@SiO2NPs and AgNPs in PEDOT:PSS using the finite element method in three-dimensional (3D) model, as shown in Fig. 5. The calculated device structure was completely the same as the experimental device structure, where the AgNP has the diameter of 36 nm, while Ag@SiO2NPs have a 6 nm thick SiO2 shell and a core with a diameter of 30 nm or 15 nm. These numerical methods were verified by studying the problems discussed by Islam et al. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the small sized Ag@SiO2NPs (15 nm@6 nm) incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS layer do not contribute to the absorption enhancement because of the lateral field distribution feature of the LSPR along the PEDOT:PSS layer, which is consistent with the results reported by Fung et al. However, when large size Ag@SiO2NPs (30 nm@6 nm) were incorporated in the PEDOT:PSS layer, as illustrated in Fig. 5(b), the strong electric field round the Ag@SiO2NPs clearly penetrates into the active layer. But one can see from Fig. 6(c) that the plasmonic near-field around AgNPs is far stronger than that around Ag@SiO2NPs. It is well known that the probability of transition of a molecule from one ground state to the excited state is proportional to the square of electric field strength the molecule experiences, so it can be deduced that introducing AgNPs should lead to larger enhancement in the light absorption of the active layer. But the experimental results are the reverse of the theoretical analysis [see Fig. 4(b)]. Usually for a metal NP, two factors contribute to the light absorption enhancement: firstly, local enhancement of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the metal NP; secondly, the scattering lengthening of the optical path in the active layer. This inconsistency means that Ag@SiO2NPs induces much stronger far-field scattering because of the presence of the SiO2 shell. Furthermore, the scattering of AgNPs@SiO2 should be a more important contributor to the light harvesting than the plasmonic near-field enhancement.
In order to further explore the effects of NPs, the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) were determined for the optimized OSCs with and without NPs. The current density–voltage characteristics of the optimized OSCs without and with NPs were measured under illumination and in the dark when the devices were bias swept from +1 to −10 V. Following the analytical approach reported by Wu et al., the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) is revealed, as shown in Fig. 6. The values of Jph and Veff were determined using the equations Jph = JL − JD and Veff = Vo − Va, respectively, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, Vo is the voltage when Jph equals zero and Va is the applied voltage. It can be seen from Fig. 6(a) that the value of Jph reaches a saturated level at a sufficiently high Veff. Therefore the values of the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) were determined and then Gmax was calculated using the equation Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer, as shown in Table 2. It can be seen that incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs leads to the largest Gmax. The enhanced Gmax is associated with the increased light absorption, which is consistent with the absorption spectra characteristic of the MLF.

Based on the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax), the exciton dissociation probabilities [P(E, T)] were calculated, which are related to the electric field (E) and temperature (T), for the optimized OSCs with and without NPs. For OSCs, when the excitons are photogenerated, only a portion of them can be dissociated into free carriers. Jph can be expressed using the equation Jph = qGmaxP(E, T)L. As a result, the value of P(E, T) at any bias can be obtained from the plot of the normalized photocurrent density (Jph/Jsat) with respect to Veff. Under the short-circuit conditions (Va = 0 V), P(E, T) is 76%, 80% and 85% for the OSCs with and without AgNPs together with Ag@SiO2 NPs, respectively. It was found that the exciton dissociation probability is higher for the OSC with integrated Ag@SiO2 NPs. This means that the exciton quenching occurred at the interface between bare AgNPs and that the active layer is reduced by coating the SiO2 insulating layer. The enhanced charge separation is also responsible for the enhanced EQE and then for Jsc except for the increased light absorption.
To further clarify the electrical effects of the NPs, the current–voltage characteristics of a hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (100 nm)/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3, 5 nm)/Ag with and without Ag@SiO2NPs in PEDOT:PSS were investigated by adjusting the doping ratio of Ag@SiO2NPs. The results indicated that the current–density of the hole-only device first increases and then reduces with an increase in the doping ratio of Ag@SiO2NPs at the same voltage, as shown in Fig. 7(a), which is consistent with the change trend of the series resistance. This means that the electrical performance of PEDOT:PSS can be improved by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ag@SiO2NPs. The improved electrical performance is presumably attributed to the introduction of “dopant” levels within the band gap of the PEDOT:PSS by introducing Ag@SiO2NPs, which could increase the hole transport and reduce the energy barrier of hole injection from ITO to PEDOT:PSS. However, if the doping ratio is too large, the possibility of contact between Ag@SiO2 and ITO is increased, which leads to enhanced contact resistance and thus, inhibition of the hole injection. In order to confirm this concept, the current-voltage characteristics of hole-only devices of ITO/Ag@SiO2NPs/PEDOT:PSS (100 nm)/MoO3(5 nm)/Ag were investigated, as shown in Fig. 7(b), where Ag@SiO2NPs are located at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface by spin-coating the ethanol solution of Ag@SiO2NPs with different concentrations of 2, 6 and 10 mg ml−1. One can see that the conductivity of the hole-only devices is first increased and then decreased as the amount of Ag@SiO2NPs at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface increases. This means that an appropriate amount of Ag@SiO2NPs was inserted at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface to promote hole injection or extraction. However, too large an amount of Ag@SiO2 NPs at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface inhibits hole injection or extraction because of too large a contact area between ITO and SiO2.
The current–voltage characteristics of a hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (100 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag with Ag NPs and Ag@SiO2NPs in PEDOT:PSS with the same doping ratio as the optimized OSCs were also compared, as shown in Fig. 8. One can see that the current–density of the hole-only device with Ag@SiO2NPs is higher at the same voltage than that with AgNPs. This means that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is lower when AgNPs are introduced than if Ag@SiO2 NPs are used. This unexpected result could originate from the higher degree of charge loss because of surface recombination of bare metal.
In other words, the presence of the SiO2 shell could inhibit hole-trapping and reduce the space charge accumulation and thus increase the hole transport.
Another electrical parameter, the ideality factor (n), of the optimized OSCs with and without NPs is derived from the J–V characteristics in the dark by using the relationship:
where
q is the electronic charge, T is the absolute temperature, K is the Boltzmann constant, n is the ideality factor, and Rs is the series resistance. The n values were determined from the y-axis intercept of the dV/dlnJ–J plot. The values of n obtained are presented in Table 2. For an ideal diode, the value of n is one, but experimentally obtained value of n are greater than unity. A departure from unity gives an indication of the imperfections in a diode. It was found that the degree of deviation of the behaviour of the NP-integrated OSC is less than the control cell without NPs.

Finally, we compared the performance of OSCs with Ag@SiO2NPs incorporated in different positions including within the buffer layer and at the interface of buffer layer/active layer. The results confirmed that the performance of OSCs with Ag@SiO2NPs in the buffer layer is better than in any other position, as shown in Table 3, because in such a position the Ag@SiO2NPs disturb the morphology of the active layer less than at the interface of buffer layer/active layer, which is also a key factor for obtaining a high PCE with OSCs.

In summary, it was demonstrated that the performance of OSCs is improved by incorporating Ag@SiO2NPs within the PEDOT:PSS layer. The short-circuit current increases from 7.71 mA cm−2 for the optimized control cell without NPs to 9.67 mA cm−2 for the optimized Ag@SiO2NPs-integrated cells, with an enhancement factor of 25.4%. The current gain gives a rise of the conversion efficiency of 3.35%, with an enhancement factor of 19.2%. The enhancement is attributed to three factors: (1) the increased light absorption by the near-field enhancement effect and the far-field scattering of the large size Ag@SiO2NPs because of the LSPR, thus, the scattering is a more important contributor to the light harvesting; (2) the increased hole transport and extraction, which is presumably explained by introducing “dopant” levels within the band gap of the PEDOT:PSS and reducing hole trapping in bare silver surface; (3) the enhanced exciton dissociation because of the reduction of exciton quenching that occurred at the interface between the bare AgNPs and the active layer by SiO2 coating. This research not only offers a more optimized design for the Ag@SiO2NPs integrated OSC, but also contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of the improvement of performance.
