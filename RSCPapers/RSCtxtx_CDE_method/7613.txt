Conductive fullerene surfactants, FPPI, Bis-FPPI, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG, are developed as electron transporting materials for achieving efficient organic and perovskite solar cells (OSCs and PVSCs) under mild solution-fabrication. One common structural feature of these fullerenes is a quaternary ammonium halide moiety, which enables electron transfer from constituent Lewis basic halides to adjacent π-acidic fullerene, resulting in anion-induced n-doping of the derived fullerenes. These polar fullerenes, herein with suitable conductivities, work-function tunability and orthogonal solution-process abilities (to common organic semiconductors and perovskites), possess advantages as interlayers not only enabling good photovoltaic performance of OSCs and PVSCs, with over 19% power conversion efficiency made from mild fabrication, but also showing device performance insensitive to the interlayer thickness.

Extensive efforts have been devoted to advance organic and perovskite solar cells (OSCs and PVSCs) due to their remarkable advantages of low-cost solution fabrication at large scale. Over the past few years, significant progress has been made for surpassing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14% for OSCs and 23% for PVSCs. For all of these most efficient devices, interfacial materials are generally inserted between the active layer and electrode for the primary function of selective charge extraction from semiconductors to the electrode, with simultaneous suppression of charge recombination within the bulk and at the interface. In recent development, some active layers can approach near 100% internal quantum efficiencies for the conversion of absorbed photons to electrons. In such devices, the interfacial properties become more influential, even deterministic to the overall performance of solar cells, and face more challenges for further optimization.

In general, multifunctional interfacial materials are required to possess good charge conductivity for efficient carrier extraction, work–function (WF) tunability for energy level alignment between the active layer and electrode, and most importantly mild solution-processing capabilities to be compatible with flexible plastic substrates. Significant amounts of effort have been devoted to developing interfacial materials for solar cell application. So far, polyelectrolytes, such as poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] bromide (PFN-Br), polyethylenimine (PEI) and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) have been widely used as cathode interfacial materials due to their excellent WF tunabilities towards electrodes. Their polar functional groups, such as ammonium and amine moieties, induce strong interfacial dipoles to the contacted metals and metal oxides, and thus can efficiently tune the WFs of electrodes. However, these polyelectrolytes show electrical insulating properties that mostly limit the interlayer thickness to be ultrathin (5 to 10 nm) for effective charge tunnelling. It would be an obstacle for large-scale fabrication with poor thickness control capabilities. Metal oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiO2), are typical n-type semiconductors as electron transporting materials (ETMs), which, however, require harsh temperature sintering (i.e. ∼200 °C for ZnO and ∼400 °C for TiO2) to improve crystallinities, as well as electron mobilities. The harsh processing conditions make them incompatible with plastic substrates with intrinsic low glass transition temperature. Also, the mismatched energetics and charge trapping surface hydroxyl groups of metal oxides affect the electronic properties of the heterointerface between the metal oxide and active layers. Therefore, additional surface modifiers and doping strategies are often needed to alleviate this problem.
Conductive organics with mild solution-processing capabilities are a catalogue of promising interfacial materials, as they can not only facilitate Ohmic contact between active layers and electrode by WF tuning, but also themselves possess good conductivity to significantly enhance charge extraction (or injection) between semiconductors and electrodes. In our previous work, conductive fullerenes and small molecules were developed consistent with the close adjacency of ammonium (and phosphonium) halides to n-type semiconductors, wherein electrons transfer from the constituent Lewis basic halides (i.e. F−, OH−, AcO−, Cl−, Br−, and I−) to adjacent π-acidic fullerenes (arenes), resulting in anion-induced n-doping of semiconductors. With the much improved conductivity, some of the conductive organics served well as cathode interfacial materials. Naphthalene diimide (NDI) based conjugated polymers with ammonium halide addends have been developed by Huang et al., and they also exhibit the advantages of good conductivity and film-formation from water/alcohol-processing as polymeric ETMs. However, most of the previous conductive ETMs mainly focused on fullerene acceptor-based OSCs. When considering that the energy levels and surface energies of state-of-art non-fullerene and perovskite systems are largely different from previously studied fullerene OSCs, new interfacial materials are of imperative need.
In this work, new fullerene surfactants, fullropyrrolidine pyridinium iodide (FPPI), bisfullropyrrolidine pyridinium iodide (Bis-FPPI), bisfulleropyrrolidinium tris(methoxyethoxy)phenyl iodide (Bis-FIMG) and bisfulleropyrrolidinium tris(methoxtriglycol)phenyl iodide (Bis-FITG), are developed as electron transporting materials for efficient organic and perovskite solar cells under mild solution fabrication. These polar fullerenes, with suitable conductivity, WF tunability and orthogonal solution-processing capabilities (to common organic semiconductors and perovskite), can be applied as interlayers for both OSCs and PVSCs. Our research reveals that these conductive fullerenes not only improve the photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene solar cells over those based on traditional interlayers (ZnO and PFN-Br) but also make device performance insensitive to the interlayer thickness (up to 60 nm). Also, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG are used in PVSCs to gain good performance, ∼19% efficiency. These results establish that these conductive fullerenes have good potential to be widely used in OSCs and PVSCs.

The chemical structures of these new fullerene surfactants are shown in Scheme 1, and they can be easily produced from a two-step synthesis through the Prato reaction, and then quaternization of nitrogen atoms (see also the ESI, Schemes S1 & S2). Pyridine and pyrrole moieties are attached to fullerene cores in this study. It turns out that the generation of pyridium is much easier than that of pyrrolidinium (deactivated by fullerene) upon quaternization. The inserted schematic diagram shows the in situ doping mechanism: electron transfer from Lewis basic iodide to adjacent fullerene results in the generation of a fullerene radical anion, which improves the free carrier concentration of fullerene film, thus increasing conductivity. The optical and electrochemical properties of new fullerenes have been characterized and are shown in Fig. 1. Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG are well soluble in both chloroform (CF) and methanol (MeOH), whereas Mono-FPPI and Bis-FPPI without flexible polar chains are only soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and insoluble in MeOH and CF (see photoimages in Fig. 1a). Additionally, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and transmittance spectra of fullerene films (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1) exhibit the principal absorptions from 300 to 500 nm. The optical bandgaps determined from absorption onsets are 2.00 eV, 2.03 eV, 2.05 eV and 2.05 eV, for FPPI, Bis-FPPI, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG, respectively. These fullerenes show good transparencies for visible and near-infrared wavelengths, similar to those of ZnO and PFN-Br, ensuring the good light harvest of active layers. Compared with mono-adducts and ZnO, bis-adducts have a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) that matches better with those of non-fullerene acceptors with upshift energy levels (Fig. 1c, Fig. S2 and Table S1). Note that Bis-FPPI in DMF solution cannot form a good thin-film upon spin-coating. It is therefore noted that Bis-FPPI with a polymeric PFN-Br co-mixture in DMF solution is later employed as the electron transporting layer (ETL) in the inverted solar cell. Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG with good alcohol processing abilities are employed in the conventional architecture.


With the above information in hand, we first chose non-fullerene active layers, PBDB-T:ITIC based solar cells to evaluate the photovoltaic performances of different ETLs, with the inverted architecture (Fig. 2a) of ITO glass/ETL/active layer/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1, the device based on a ZnO ETL as cast gave a PCE of 9.58%, and the parameters were open-circuit voltage (VOC) 0.86 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) 15.75 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) 0.71. The best device based on Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br (1:1 v/v commixture from the DMF solution of Bis-FPPI (5 mg ml−1) and PFN-Br (0.5 mg ml−1), respectively, (hereafter all comparisons were made based on this condition unless stated otherwise) gave a PCE of 10.01% (VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 17.09 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.69). Devices based on FPPI and FPPI:PFN-Br ETLs gave poor PCEs (Table S5) that may be due to the mismatched energetics with non-fullerene acceptors. Compared with devices based on ZnO, the devices based on the Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br ETL obtained higher JSC and external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 2e). The calculated integral current Jcal matched well with the experimental values (error range <5%). This can be attributed to the enhanced charge extraction capability of fullerene ETLs.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG ETLs, we fabricated conventional devices based on ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC/ETL/Ag (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2d and Table 1, solar cells based on PFN-Br gave a PCE of 10.06% (VOC = 0.91 V, JSC = 15.13 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.73). Compared with those based on PFN-Br, the conductive fullerene Bis-FIMG exhibited a better PCE of 10.82% (VOC = 0.91 V, JSC = 16.57 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72).However, Bis-FITG gave a lower PCE of 8.99% (VOC = 0.88 V, JSC = 15.65 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.65) partially due to non-ideal film formation since the long triglycol chains make Bis-FITG a sticky solid at room temperature. Fig. 2f reveals that both devices based on Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG have higher EQE than that based on PFN-Br, which was consistent with the improved current densities, indicating the improved charge extraction of fullerene ETLs.
The recombination kinetics of PBDB-T:ITIC OSCs with different ETMs are further investigated by measuring JSC and VOC under varied light intensities (I). Fig. 3a and b show that VOC varied logarithmically (ln(I)) with light intensity, in which the slopes for inverted and conventional devices based on different ETLs were 1.47, 1.44, 1.27, 1.40 and 1.30 kT/e for ZnO, Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br, Bis-FIMG, Bis-FITG and PFN-Br devices, respectively. The slope will be 1.0 kT/e when bimolecular recombination is dominant, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. In our study, fullerene ETLs have smaller slopes compared with traditional ETLs (ZnO and PFN-Br). Fig. 3c and d show that JSC ∝ Iα, where α = 0.982, 0.998, 0.993, 0.994 and 0.997 for ZnO, Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br, Bis-FIMG, Bis-FITG and PFN-Br devices, respectively. These factors of α close to 1 means that charge carriers based on these ETLs could be efficiently extracted from active layers prior to charge recombination.
Since the large-scale fabrication has difficulty in the fine control of film thickness, a thick film or thickness-insensitive ETL should be a desirable feature for solution-process OSCs. We further carried out the device performance measurement under varied thicknesses of ETL. Both inverted and conventional devices remained highly efficient with varied ETL thicknesses from 10 nm to 80 nm (Fig. 3e & f and Tables S2 & S3). This means that device performance is insensitive to ETL thicknesses to some extent, owing to these fullerene ETLs providing high enough conductivities to extract and transport charge within thick films.
Also, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG as buffer layers were employed in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with the architecture ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/PCBM/buffer layer/Ag. Devices based on Bis-FIMG showed a PCE of 19.31% (VOC = 1.08 V, JSC = 22.92 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.795) and Bis-FITG showed 19.01% PCE (VOC = 1.07 V, JSC = 22.15 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.804), which are higher than that of BCP (PCE = 18.80%, VOC = 1.07 V, JSC = 22.30 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.789) (Table S4). The J–V and EQE curves are shown in Fig. S3. These results revealed that conductive fullerenes could also achieve high-performance PVSCs.

To further explore the properties of these ETLs, conductivity estimation was carried out in Schottky-junction devices (ITO glass/ETL/Ag, Fig. 4a), where ETLs were with the thickness of about 60 nm. Fig. 4b shows the J–V characteristics of Schottky-junction devices based on different ETLs in the dark and a histogram of I/V (ratios of current to voltage in Schottky-junction devices) is presented in Fig. 4c, which stands for conductivity at a certain extent. ZnO showed a lower I/V value, while quaternary ammonium fullerenes and fullerene:PFN-Br co-mixtures obtained higher I/V values (around 5 times as high as ZnO), representing higher conductivities of fullerene ETLs than that of ZnO. It can be explained that in situ n-doping between halides and adjacent fullerenes induces high conductivities of these ammonium fullerenes. In addition, FPPI:PFN-Br and Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br have higher conductivities than pure FPPI (and Bis-FPPI) fullerene films since PFN-Br bears additional Lewis basic bromide, and promotes stronger doping and better film-formation of fullerene ETLs. These good conductivities of fullerene ETLs ensure optimal charge carrier extraction and transport at the interfacial layer to achieve better OSC and PVSC device performance.


We employed a Veeco MultiMode atomic force microscope (AFM) to characterize the surface morphologies of these ETLs. From the topographic and phase images (Fig. 5a–g) of thin films based on these ETLs, the ZnO film was of a larger roughness (Rq = 6.19 nm) than those fullerene films. The roughnesses of those films based on Bis-FPP, FPPI, FPPI:PFN-Br, Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG were 3.14, 2.17, 1.85, 2.60, 2.86 and 2.75 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, there exist a large number of striped aggregates in the ZnO film. Fullerene ETL films (Fig. 5b–g) were smoother and more comfortable to contact with the above organic films and metal films. The surface wettability of the ETL layer significantly affects the morphology of active layers. We also carried out water contact angle measurements on varied ETLs/ITO surfaces, and the water contact angles were 34.6°, 40.2°, 79.8°, 75.7°, 94.8°, 77.6°, 82.6°, 35.6° and 18.5° for ITO, ZnO, PFN-Br, FPPI, FPPI:PFN-Br, Bis-FPPI, Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG, respectively (Fig. 5 and S4). The contact angles of fullerene ETLs show that they can tune surface wettability through the tailored side chains. Compared to the hydrophilic ZnO surface, rigid fullerene (FPPI and Bis-FPPI) ETLs are more hydrophobic. However, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG with flexible ethoxyl chains showed hydrophilic surfaces, stating that more ethoxyl chains lead to more hydrophilicity of fullerene films.


In conclusion, we have developed a series of conductive fullerenes, FPPI, Bis-FPPI, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG, as electron transporting materials for achieving high-efficiency organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells. In the studied non-fullerene active layer (PBDB-T:ITIC) based devices, Bis-FPPI:PFN-Br ETL produced 10.01% PCE, which is slightly better than that of ZnO (9.58% PCE) in the inverted architecture. Devices based on conductive fullerene ETLs can achieve better performance in mild solution-fabrication. In addition, Bis-FIMG based devices achieve 10.82% PCE which is even higher than that of PFN-Br (10.06% PCE) in the conventional architecture. Conductive fullerenes as interfacial layers show device performance insensitive to the interlayer thickness (up to 60 nm). Furthermore, Bis-FIMG and Bis-FITG are also employed as buffer layers in the PVSCs, wherein Bis-FIMG achieves a better PCE of 19.31% than BCP (18.80% PCE). Our studies indicated that fullerene surfactants, with suitable conductivity, work function tunabilities and orthogonal solution-processing capabilities have good potentials to be widely used in OSCs and PVSCs under mild solution processing.
