Two new D–π–A organic dyes containing a tert-butyl-capped indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole unit as a donor, bithiophene unit as a π-linker and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor (CL-10 and CL-11) have been designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). By comparison, two dyes exhibit almost the same absorption and electrochemical properties, because the introduction of two hexyl groups at non-ortho β-positions of the 2,2′-bithiophene unit dose not destroy the planarity of the molecular skeleton of CL-11. However, the DSSC devices based on them show very different photovoltaic performances with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.96% for CL-10 and 2.85% for CL-11, which can be attributed to the existence of the hexyl groups in CL-11 that lead to a big decrease of the dye adsorption onto TiO2. The addition of chenodeoxylic acid (CDCA) as a coadsorbant can significantly improve the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs with a big increase in the PCE for CL-10 (4.68%) and CL-11 (4.66%).

After the first report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely and deeply investigated due to their easy and low-cost fabrication procedure, as well as reasonably good power conversion efficiency. And these characteristics make them a possible competitor to traditional inorganic silicon-based photovoltaic cells. Especially, Ru-based metal dyes and some metal-free organic dyes prepared for DSSCs have achieved power conversion efficiencies over 11% under AM 1.5 simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). However, compared with the metal-free organic dyes, the rareness and cost of ruthenium metal and also the purification complexity of Ru-based sensitizers have limited their development and application. So ever-increasing amounts of research are focusing on metal-free organic dyes due to their high molar extinction coefficients, inexpensive cost, amenity to molecular modification and tailoring flexibility and eco-friendly nature.

Over the past decades, the permutation and combination of many organic functional moieties have generated a lot of D–π–A structured organic dyes. Among them, triphenylamine and its derivatives, thiophene or oligothiophene moieties, and the cyanoacrylic acid unit are the most widely used building blocks as the electron donor, π-bridge, and electron acceptor/anchoring group, respectively.
Indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazoles are fused indolo- and carbazole rings in a not highly strained model. They are nearly planar and show strong electron donor ability. However, they are seldom applied to build metal-free organic dyes for DSSCs. Recently, Luo and his co-workers reported four indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole based sensitizers containing different π-bridges (IC-1–IC-4) for DSSCs. They found that the π-bridges exerted a great impact on the photovoltaic performance for these indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole based dyes. Although indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole unit showed better molecular planarity than triphenylamine or N-phenyl carbazole unit, this kind of IC dyes did not present good photovoltaic performances in DSSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized two new D–π–A organic dyes (CL-10 and CL-11) containing indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole unit as an electron donor for DSSCs. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. In order to suppress the intermolecular aggregation and improve the solubility and also to enhance the light resistant ability of the dyes, two tert-butyl groups have been introduced into indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole unit. At the same time, bithiophene unit has been selected to be a π-linker, because it exhibits good thermal, electron-rich and electrochemical stability. Moreover, β-substituted alkyl chain can block the bad charge recombination and also increase the open-circuit voltage effectively, thus to enhance the photovoltaic performance of indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole based dyes in DSSCs. In our previous work, it has been demonstrated that 3′,4-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene as the π-bridge is the most optimized π-bridge among four different β-substituted 2,2′-bithiophene geometric isomers (namely, 4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, 3,3′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, 3′,4-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene). Thus, we only choose 3′,4-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene unit as π linker by comparison with the β-unsubstituted bithiophene unit. Here, we presented the synthesis of two organic dyes, and detailedly investigated the photophysical properties and photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs based on them.

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were measured by a Varian MERCURY-VX300 in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with TMS as the internal reference. UV-vis absorption spectrometry was performed on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical behaviors of CL dyes were investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a CHI600A electrochemical work station, the cyclic voltammograms of CL dyes were measured in a solution of 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 in DMF. A three electrode cell containing a Pt-coil working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode were employed. The ferrocene/ferricenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal reference. Prior to the electrochemical measurements, all solutions were degassed with high-purity argon. The elemental analysis was carried out on a CARLOERBA-1106 micro elemental analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded with a VJ-ZAB-3F-Mass spectrometer or a Bruker 320-MS triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.


The catalyst of Pd(PPh3)4 was synthesized in our own lab, and anhydrous THF was purified by refluxing with a Na–K alloy in the Schlenk system. Compound 1, 4, 5 were prepared according to the corresponding literatures. All the other reagents and solvents were used as commercially purchased without further purification.


The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was prepared by the procedure reported in the literature. The DSSCs devices employing acetonitrile electrolyte, photoanodes consisted of a 12 μm layer of mesoporous TiO2 (18NR-T) and a 3 μm scatter layer (18NR-AO) were prepared. The conducting glass substrates were immersed in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, then washed with water and ethanol, and finally dried. After that, by employing the screen printing technique, the TiO2 nanoparticle paste was deposited onto a conducting glass substrate (OPV glass with 7 Ω cm−2 resistance). The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min. After that, the heated TiO2 electrodes were dipped once more in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, and then washed with water and ethanol. In the end, the electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled. After the TiO2 films were prepared, they immersed overnight into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of the corresponding dyes at room temperature. For the coadsorption, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was added. The sensitized electrodes were washed with ethanol and dried under air. The counter electrode was made by spreading a 5 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in isopropyl alcohol onto a conducting glass substrate (OPV) with a small hole to allow the introduction of the liquid electrolyte using vacuum, followed by heating at 390 °C for 15 min. Finally, the working and counter electrodes were sandwiched together using a thin thermoplastic (Surlyn) frame that melts at 100 °C. For the sake of reducing the scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dye-sensitized TiO2 layer, a black light shading mask was used on the DSSCs, so the active area of the DSSCs was fixed to 0.09 cm2. The volatile electrolyte was consisted of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (1:1, v/v).


Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5G simulated sunlight equipped with a 450 W xenon arc lamp (Model 94023A, Newport Co.). The power of the light intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 by using a Newport Oriel PV reference monocrystalline silicon cell system (Model 91150V, Newport Co.). The current–voltage (J–V) curves for the fabricated DSSCs were collected by using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The cell active area was tested with a black metal mask of 0.09 cm2. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were implemented with applying a bias of the open circuit voltage (Voc) under the conditions and recorded over a frequency range from 0.05 Hz to 105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. All of the measurements mentioned above were taken under ambient conditions. Incident photon-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a DC Power Meter (Model 2931-C, Newport Co.) under irradiation of a 300 W xenon arc lamp light source with a motorized monochromator (Oriel).

After stirring for 1 h, 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (2.08 g, 11.2 mmol) was added. The resulting solution was stirred for another 1 h at −78 °C, and then allowed to warm to room temperature.

The synthetic route of the CL-10/CL-11 dyes is depicted in Scheme 1. 2,5-Di-tert-butylindolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole (1) was prepared according to the corresponding literature. After bromination, 5-bromo-2,10-di-tert-butylindolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole (2) was treated with n-BuLi to eliminate the halogen atom at −78 °C for 1 h, then 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane was added to yield the corresponding compound 2,10-di-tert-butyl-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole (3). After then, compound (3) reacted with α-monobromobithiophene aldehyde (4 or 5) via Suzuki coupling to produce the corresponding compounds (6) and (7), respectively. In the end, the cyanoacetic acid block was linked to (6) or (7) via the Knoevenagel condensation to give the target dyes (CL-10 and CL-11) in high yields. Because of the introduction of several alkyl group into the molecular backbone, both of them showed good solubility in common organic solvents such CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and THF etc.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the CL-10 and CL-11 dyes in THF and absorbed on TiO2 films are presented in Fig. 2. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, each of them exhibits absorption bands at three distinct spectrum regions. Two absorption bands locate at about 250–350 nm region that can be assigned to the localized aromatic π–π* electron transition of the conjugated molecules. Another absorption band occurs above 400 nm, which is attributed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). By comparison, a little red-shifted ICT absorption maximum (about 3 nm) occurred for CL-11 because the two hexyl groups with weak electron-donating effect at non-ortho β-positions of bithiophene unit has small steric hindrance that can not destroy the molecular planarity of CL-11. This is much different from those of two hexyl groups locating at ortho β-positions of bithiophene unit in our previous work (such as the dyes DH-42 (ref. 19) and DH-12 (ref. 23)), in which the planarity of molecular skeleton has been almost completely destroyed and ICT has greatly retarded due to the large steric hindrance between two hexyl groups. In addition, both of them show high extinction coefficient at absorption maximum, indicating that their light-harvesting performance may be very efficient.

After being adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 film, the energy of the π* level was directly decreased because of the increased delocalization of the π* orbital of the conjugated framework caused by the interaction between the carboxylate group and the Ti4+ ions. Therefore, the absorption of the CL sensitizers is red-shifted as compared with those in solution, and the absorption intensity from 350 to 600 nm is significantly enhanced. It should be noted that the stronger and broader absorption of CL-10 in the TiO2 film is observed than CL-11, implying more preferable and efficient light-harvesting ability in the DSSCs.
The redox behaviour of CL dyes was studied by cyclic voltammetry (in Fig. 3) for the purpose of investigating the electron transfer ability from the excited dye molecules to the conductive band of TiO2. The cyclic voltammograms of CL dyes were measured in a solution of 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 in DMF. A three-electrode cell containing of a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, Pt wire counter electrode and Pt-coil working electrode were employed. The ferrocene/ferricenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal reference. Prior to the electrochemical measurements, all solutions were degassed with high-purity argon.
As can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table 1, CL-10 and CL-11 show much similar redox behaviour with the onset oxidative potentials at about 1.05 V, which can be assigned to the oxidation of the donor group. Generally, the initial oxidation potential (Eox) can be used to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dyes. Thus, the HOMO level of the CL dyes locates at about −5.30 eV, which is lower than the I−/I3− redox potential (−4.90 eV) as shown in Fig. 4. This indicates that there is enough driving force for efficient dye-regeneration. The LUMO energy levels of the dyes are estimated to be about −2.98 eV for CL-10 and −3.00 eV for CL-11, respectively, coming from the difference between the optical band gap and corresponding HOMO energy level. This LUMO energy level is higher than the TiO2 conduction band (−3.9 eV) as shown in Fig. 4, indicating that the electron injection process is energetically favourable compared with the conduction band edge energy level of the TiO2 electrode (0.5 V vs. NHE).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to gain further insight into the molecular structures and the electronic distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the dyes. And the frontier molecular orbitals of the dyes at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level are shown in Fig. 5, the surfaces are generated with an isovalue of 0.03. The tert-butyl group has been replaced with methyl group to simplify the calculation procedure.

As can be seen, the electron density is uniformly distributed along the tert-butyl-capped indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole and bithiophene unit at the HOMO state. While the excited electrons are shifted to the bithiophene and cyanoacrylic acid unit at the LUMO level, which can be assigned to the ICT along the π-conjugated skeleton. So we can speculate that the excited electrons could be sufficiently injected into the conduction band of TiO2 through the acceptor group.
At the same time, the structure of CL dyes has been optimized as shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the dihedral angle of two β-unsubstituted thiophene rings is about 7.15° in CL-10. For CL-11, the dihedral angle of two β-substituted thiophene rings increases to about 20.47° due to a small steric hindrance of two hexyl groups locating at 3′,4-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene unit, indicating that the geometry of two thiophene rings is slightly twisted. But its dihedral angle of 20.47° is still less than that (∼27°) of the bithiophene bridge and the donor ring, indicating that the planarity of molecular skeleton as well as ICT can be maintained. This can also explain that both of the dyes show almost same absorption property. Moreover, the partially twisted geometric structure caused by two hexyl groups at non-ortho β-positions of 2,2′-bithiophene unit can suppress the charge recombination that is favorable for the enhancement of the open-circuit voltage.

The photovoltaic properties of the solar cells based on CL dyes were measured under standard AM 1.5G irradiation. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on CL dyes are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. The corresponding results are summarized in Table 2.

The IPCE of the sensitizers illustrated that the visible light can be converted to photocurrent efficiently in the range of 350–700 nm, which is in line with their absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. It should be noted that the IPCE exceeds 45% in the spectral range 370–530 nm for CL-10, and the maximum value reaches 65% at 430 nm, while the CL-11-based cell only gives a moderate IPCE response which is in agreement with the result of Jsc of CL-based cells. As we know, IPCE is a product of the electron injection efficiency, light-harvesting efficiency, and charge collection efficiency. Therefore, CL-10 with higher and broader IPCE value indicates more efficient light-photocurrent conversion, resulting in higher short circuit current density (Jsc) in DSSCs.
As can be seen from Fig. 8 and Table 2, CL-10 exhibits a more impressive photovoltaic performance with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.41 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.53 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, resulting in an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.96% than CL-11 (Jsc = 7.01 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.55 V, FF = 0.74, η = 2.85%). By comparison, the short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.41 mA cm−2 for CL-10 based solar cell is much higher than that of the CL-11-based cell (Jsc = 7.01 mA cm−2). This could be mainly attributed to its more dye adsorption for CL-10 that caused more efficient light-harvesting than CL-11, which is confirmed by the measurement of amount of dye adsorption on TiO2 by a colorimetric method. Because of the introduction of two hexyl chains into bithiophene unit, the congestion of intermolecular aggregation is greatly increased thus to reduce the dye loading and create more un-adsorbed TiO2 sites. Therefore, the amount of dye adsorption on TiO2 surface for CL-11 is much lower than that of CL-10 as shown in Table 2.
Due to strong intermolecular interaction, the π–π stacking of organic dyes always occurs, which leads to the inefficient electron injection and low power conversion efficiency. It has been proved that CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) can effectively prevent the dye-aggregation, and thus improve the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. So the performances of the DSSCs in the presence of the co-adsorbent CDCA (1 mM and 10 mM) are studied (Fig. 9 and Table 3).

When the concentration of CDCA is increased from 0 to 10 mM for CL-10 and CL-11 based cells, respectively, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) are almost all improved to some extent, thus led to a power conversion efficiency (η) increased 5.81% with 1 mM CDCA and 18.18% with 10 mM CDCA for CL-10, 63.51% with 1 mM CDCA and 11.23% with 10 mM CDCA for CL-11. Especially, for CL-11 based cells, after co-adsorbed with 1 mM CDCA, the Jsc is significantly improved from 7.01 to 11.43 mA cm−2, which is similar to the results reported by Lin's group. As we known, the CDCA has an adverse effect on dye adsorption density, the increment of Jsc provides further support of dye aggregation suppression by CDCA and result in a more efficient electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2. However, it should be noted that for CL-11 based cells, when the concentration of CDCA is increased from 1 to 10 mM, the Jsc, Voc and η are all significantly decreased, although photovoltaic performance still improved in relative to the dye without CDCA. This may be the result of the excess CDCA that reduces the adsorption of the dye. From another perspective, the lower concentration (1 mM) of CDCA is more preferable for CL-11 while the higher concentration (10 mM) for CL-10. This is well in agreement with the molecular structure of the dyes. In CL-11, the presence of two alkyl chains in π-bridge can prevent the dye aggregation and suppressing the charge recombination to some extent, but it also significantly reduces the dye loading and creates more un-adsorbed TiO2 sites. Therefore, a small amount of the added CDCA molecules can help to occupy these exposed TiO2 sites and suppress the close contact of the TiO2 surface with the oxidized electrolytes. But more CDCA molecules added will greatly reduce dye loading that finally results in inefficient light-harvesting and impairs the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) visibly. As for CL-10, nonexistence of two alkyl chains in π-bridge can reduce the molecular size and guarantee more dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 interface. However, it can also increase the intermolecular aggregation and the charge recombination, which is unfavourable for improving the photovoltaic performances. Therefore, compared with CL-11, more amount of CDCA molecules added can retard the molecular aggregation and suppress the charge recombination.

Under a forward bias of −0.70 V with a frequency range of 10−1 Hz to 105 Hz, we measured the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark, to clarify the correlation of the open circuit voltage (Voc) with the dyes. The Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of the DSSCs based on the CL dyes are shown in Fig. 10. In the Nyquist plot, the larger semicircle was attributed to the charge transfer impedance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Rrec, which is the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2 surface, can be estimated from the radius of the larger semicircle in the Nyquist plot. The larger the Rrec, the slower the charge recombination rate.

As shown in Fig. 10(a), CL-11 with two hexyl chains in π-bridge presents a larger radius of the middle semicircle than CL-10. The bigger Rrec value of CL-11 means more effective retardation of charge recombination between the injected electron into the TiO2 and oxidized species (I3−) in the electrolyte, which reveals the superiority of its structure than CL-10. The characteristic frequency in the Bode plot is also related to the charge recombination rate. Its reciprocal is connected with the electron lifetime. As can be seen, the characteristic frequency peaks of CL-11 is decreased compared to CL-10, indicating that two hexyl chain in π-bridge favours to the improvement of electron lifetime, due to the formation of a alkyl chain blocking dye layer, generating a higher Voc.
However, the long-chain alkyl groups at bithiophene unit greatly increase the molecular size, which significantly reduce the amount of dye-loading onto the TiO2 surface. This is much unfavourable for improving photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs. The structural modification, especially for choice of the alkyl group at bithiophene unit, needs to be further optimized, which has been under progress.

A new kind of metal-free organic dye with tert-butyl-capped indolo[3,2,1-jk]carbazole unit as a donor, bithiophene unit as a π bridge and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor has been designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells. The introduction of two hexyl groups at non-ortho β-positions of 2,2′-bithiophene unit is favourable to retard the molecular aggregation and suppress the charge recombination. However, it also significantly reduces the amount of adsorbed dyes onto the TiO2 surface. The photovoltaic devices based on the dyes show a power conversion efficiency of 3.96 and 2.85% for CL-10 and CL-11, which are further significantly improved to 4.68 and 4.66%, respectively, upon the addition of chenodeoxylic acid (CDCA) as a coadsorbant. It is found that a moderate concentration of CDCA has a big influence on the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs based on the dye structure.
