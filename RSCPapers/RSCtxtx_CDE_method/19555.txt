In recent years, the dramatic increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) coupled with a decrease in the total cost of third-generation solar cells has led to a significant increase in the collaborative research efforts of academic and industrial researchers. Such interdisciplinary studies have afforded novel materials, which in many cases are now ready to be brought to the marketplace. Within this framework, the field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is currently an important area of research due to their extraordinary light-harvesting properties. In particular, PSCs prepared via facile synthetic procedures, containing hole transport materials (HTMs) with versatile triphenylamine (TPA) structural cores, amenable to functionalization, have become a focus of intense global research activity. To optimize the efficiency of the solar cells to achieve efficiencies closer to rival silicon-based technology, TPA building blocks must exhibit favourable electrochemical, photophysical, and photochemical properties that can be chemically tuned in a rational manner. Although PSCs based on TPA building blocks exhibit attractive properties such as high-power efficiencies, a reduction in their synthetic costs coupled with higher stabilities and environmental considerations still need to be addressed. Considering the above, a detailed summary of the most promising compounds and current methodologies employed to overcome the remaining challenges in this field is provided. The objective of this review is to provide guidance to readers on exploring new avenues for the discovery of efficient TPA derivatives, to aid in the future development and advancement of TPA-based PSCs for commercial applications.

Energy is essential for modern life, and as such, population growth and industrial developments are reflected in the correlation between energy consumption and the economic prosperity of a nation. Over the past decade, energy shortages have become an important global issue as the demand for diminishing natural resources such as oil, natural gas, and fossil fuels continues to increase. If left unchecked, higher fuel prices could cause industrial facilities to close, laying off workers to reduce heating costs. Furthermore, if this situation is not resolved it has the propensity to develop into a global humanitarian crisis should heating, cooking, and water supplies become severely restricted. To ease the increasing demand for natural resources, alternative sources of electricity are therefore urgently needed. Renewable energy sources such as solar energy, hydropower, geothermal energy, and wind energy provide reliable power supplies that lower the risk of fuel spills, reduce the need for imported fuels, enhance energy security, and aid in the conservation of natural resources. A review done in 2020 on the various energy sources utilized to meet the world's electricity needs revealed that ∼73% of the electricity came from fossil fuels and nuclear power, with only ∼2.7% of the world's electricity harnessed directly from the sun, Fig. 1.

Approximately 1.08 × 1014 kW of the sun's energy reaches the earth's surface in various forms such as heat and light. The sun is therefore the earth's prime renewable energy resource, since it is both inexhaustible and has a solid efficiency and higher output when compared to other renewable energy sources such as hydropower and wind energy. Solar photovoltaics (PVs) that harness energy directly from the sun are therefore rapidly gaining in popularity as a cost-effective source of mainstream electricity. Since the intensity and distribution of solar radiation vary considerably from country to country, and solar energy is not centralized or detrimental to the environment, it is particularly advantageous for developing countries. As a consequence, the need to develop renewable solar energy technology currently motivates intense scientific research efforts, worldwide.

Solar cells function by converting the energy of incident photons to electricity. As this field has developed over the past couple of decades, PV technologies are now classified into three discrete generations, i.e., first- (1G), second- (2G), and third-generation (3G), or as emerging solar cell technology, vide infra.


First-generation solar cells contain silicon wafers, which, although having high PCEs, are expensive to produce. Second-generation thin-film solar cells contain a layer of amorphous silica; however, their performances are poorer than their 1G counterparts. Hence after two decades of research, efforts are now centered on the development of a third generation (3G) of newly emerging PVs.


Third-generation solar cells include copper/zinc/tin sulfide solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells, polymer solar cells, quantum dot (QD) solar cells, and PSCs. In this field, the employment of new materials to achieve high photo-conversion efficiencies per unit area and reduce the cost per watt is a major goal. Third-generation devices do not require the usual p–n junctions to separate the charge carriers produced by light, and thus have quite different configurations from their first- and second-generation counterparts. An important feature of these solar cells is that they are comprised of several energy levels and several pairs of carriers (electrons and holes) that they can pick up before heating. Three emerging families of 3G solar cells are the focus of this review, namely, polymer:fullerene solar cells, hybrid polymer solar cells, and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs in particular show exciting promise for the generation of large-scale solar energy in light of their high PCEs and compatibility with scalable manufacturing processes. Third-generation solar cells have been well studied in recent years owing to the nature of their molecule-to-molecule interactions, adjustable bandgaps, and ability to absorb light from different parts of the solar spectrum, and the construction of devices based on flexible substrates. Within this field, new approaches to light manipulation such as solar spectral correction, plasmonic enhancement, and surface texturing are also being adopted. Third-generation solar cells have also received much attention for their simple manufacturing processes and high conversion efficiencies. In this respect, the discovery of 3G solar cells with high conversion efficiencies from cost-effective starting materials is a major challenge at the forefront of this field, Fig. 2.

The historical development of PSCs is summarized in Fig. 3. The first solar cells containing a perovskite mineral together with MAPbI3 or MAPbBr3 (where MA = CH3NH3) sensitizers were reported in 2009 by Kojima et al. with efficiencies of 3.81% and 3.13% respectively. At the same time, nanocrystalline QDs and similar DSSCs were developed by Park and co-workers, who managed to increase the efficiency of the resulting devices to 6.54%; however, stability issues caused by the dissolution of the perovskite in the liquid electrolyte prevented further exploitation of these systems.
3G DSSC devices comprising mesoporous titania (m-TiO2) that are typically sensitized with ruthenium dyes have been developed over the past decade to increase light absorption. The limitations of these devices, however, initiated research concerning the utility of perovskites and QDs as molecular dyes, affording a new class of 3G devices with record PCEs. In this respect, nanostructured organic–inorganic halide PSCs are currently receiving much attention due to their low fabrication costs, high efficiencies, and excellent PCEs. By employing hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite halides CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), researchers have developed 3G devices with PCEs >21%, which far exceed the best values reported for their organic thin-film based DSSC counterparts. In light of the above advances, PSCs are now the most intensively studied class of 3G devices. As such, their historical development is outlined in the next section.

The original perovskite mineral comprising calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO3) was first discovered in 1939 by Gustav Rose and named after the Russian mineralogist, Count Lev Alekseevich Perovski. In the 1990s Mitzi et al. demonstrated that, due to their exciton properties, organic–inorganic perovskites could be utilized in transistors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and the phenomenon of photovoltaics (PV) was first observed by Kojima et al.

In 2011, Im et al. improved the quality of the m-TiO2 electron transport material (ETM) and employed MAPbI3 QD sensitizers, increasing the efficiency of the resulting PSCs to ∼6.5%. Overcoming issues concerning the utilization of liquid electrolytes was finally achieved in 2012 by Kim et al., who replaced them with a solid hole conductor. Following this breakthrough Burschka et al. achieved 15% efficiency by employing a sequential two-step deposition process. Shortly thereafter, MAPbI3-based solar cells were developed using the same two-step process reported by Im and co-workers. However, by controlling the size of the MAPbI3 cuboid, more efficient light-harvesting and better charge transport properties were achieved. In the same year, Zhou et al. studied the carrier extraction process at the electrode and concluded that ethoxylated polyethyleneimine together with doped TiO2, when combined with the perovskite MAPbI3−xClx, increased the solar cell efficiency to 19.3%. Important progress has also been made by Giordano and co-workers, who added lithium to the m-TiO2 layer, to enhance its electronic properties, resulting in devices with a PCE of 19.3%. In 2015, Jeon et al. combined FAPbI3 with MAPbBr3 to increase the stability of the devices, affording FAPbI3-based solar cells with significantly enhanced PCEs, ranging from 4.3 to >18%. In 2015, Yang and co-workers utilized a FAPbI3 film with modified properties that included large, dense microstructures. This study revealed that as the crystallization properties of the (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x material increased, the quality of the perovskite film also improved, resulting in devices with a maximum PCE of 20.2%. The vacuum flash-assisted solution process (VASP) was first employed by Li and co-workers in 2016 for the preparation of perovskite films with uniform crystalline morphologies, and in the same year, a polymer was also employed for the preparation of perovskite films that afforded devices with enhanced electronic properties. A benchmark PSC with the highest efficiency of 23.3% was reported by the Chinese academy researchers in 2018, and 3 years later, the solar cell conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reached 30%.

A schematic representation of the operation principle of a PSC is illustrated in Fig. 4.

As previously mentioned, PSCs use perovskite structured light absorbers for PV activity. In this respect, when sunlight hits a PSC, the perovskite absorbs the light, excitons are generated, and charge carriers (electrons and holes) are produced upon exciton dissociation. Exciton dissociation occurs at the interface of the perovskite and the charge-transporting layers. When the electron is separated from the hole and injected into the electron-transporting layer (ETL), it migrates to the anode, which is typically comprised of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. At the same time, the hole is injected into the hole-transporting layer (HTL), and it subsequently migrates to the cathode. The electrons and holes are collected by the working and counter electrodes, respectively, and transported to the external circuit to produce the current. The principles behind the operation of a PSC are further outlined using the band diagram shown in Fig. 5 and as previously described involve (i) the absorption of a photon and free charge generation, and (ii) charge transport and (iii) charge extraction processes.
Perovskites used in the manufacture of PSC devices follow a design strategy similar to DSSCs, and are typically classified as regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structures, depending on which transport material is present on the exterior portion of the cell that is first encountered by the incident light. These two classes are then further sub-divided into mesoscopic and planar structures. PSCs without electron and hole-transporting layers have also been tested, and the most commonly used configurations are shown in Fig. 6.
Although mesoporous PSCs tend to show better PCEs than their planar counterparts, in contrast to planar PSCs that are fabricated at room temperature, they require thin mesoporous layers <300 nm, prepared by high-temperature syntheses.

Both the architecture of the overall perovskite cell and the component materials have a significant effect on the electronic and optical properties of the resulting PSC devices. As shown in Fig. 4, the materials currently used for the fabrication of PSCs comprise a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer, an ETL, a light-harvesting perovskite material, a hole-transport layer (HTL), and the metal contact material. Additional details concerning the key components of PSCs are briefly discussed below.


Lead halides with a perovskite ABX3 structure are used as active layer materials (light absorbers) for conventional PSCs, where A = CH3NH3+ (methylammonium, MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (formamidinium, FA+), or Cs+; B = Pb2+ or Sn2+; and X = I−, Br−, or Cl−. Currently, the most common material is MAPbI3, which has a tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature, with PbI64− octahedra at the corners of the cell and a large monovalent cation in the center.


Inorganic and organic electron transport materials (ETMs) with both regular and inverted configurations are commonly employed in PSCs. The most important role of transition-metal oxides in most PV solar cells is that they function as selective contacts for electron transfer to the anode, i.e., as ETLs. Currently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most commonly used ETL in conventional n–i–p PSCs due to its excellent electron transport properties. Good band gap alignment, adequate electron mobility, and compatibility with the low-temperature solution-based deposition process make n-type organic materials such as fullerenes (C60) and their derivatives (including [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), indene C60 bis-adduct (ICBA), and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)) suitable ETLs for perovskite solar cells with inverted-architectures.


Hole transport materials (HTMs) are essential components of high-efficiency PSCs that facilitate extraction of the photo-generated holes and transport the holes to the metal contact. By preventing direct contact between the counter electrode and the perovskite layer, the ETL averts charge recombination, resulting in an increase in the overall PCE of the device. Ideal HTMs should have well-matched HOMO energy levels relative to the perovskite layer to ensure efficient interfacial hole transfer. They should also be thermally and photochemically stable and have good internal hole mobilities. Solid-state hole carriers (HTMs) are typically classified into three classes: (i) inorganic, (ii) polymeric, and (iii) small organic molecules. An energy-level diagram for the most common HTMs employed in PSCs is summarized in Fig. 7.

All three diverse classes of HTMs have both advantages and drawbacks. In this respect, inorganic CuI, CuSCN, and NiO HTMs are cheap to use and have excellent hole mobilities. However, the solvent used for their deposition can partially dissolve the perovskite layer, compromising the stability of the resulting PSCs. The polymeric materials also suffer from time-consuming purification methods, poor solubilities, unknown molecular weights, and low penetration into the perovskite nanostructures. These limitations have subsequently paved the way for the development of a third class of HTMs that consist of small organic molecules. Fig. 8 shows a diagram of an “efficiency tree” that presents the best efficiency levels (>21%) of the HTMs applied to PSCs to date. In this respect, spiro-OMeTAD is recognized as the benchmark HTM in the field, since it efficiently transports holes to the counter electrode and minimizes resistance and recombination losses.

For the future commercialization of PSC technology, several key requirements need to be met which include: (1) controllable thin film growth and deposition; (2) scalable and manufacturable processes; (3) high stability and long lifetimes; and (4) low toxicity. Furthermore, to compete with current PV technology, the cost of manufacturing PSC devices is also an important consideration. Fortunately, the basic components of PSCs are cheap and abundant; however, recent analyses of performance and business needs indicate that there are still plenty of hurdles to overcome. These include the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for residential use, which was 9.0 cents per kWh in 2020 and is expected to fall to 5.0 cents per kWh by 2030. Although the design and construction of large surface area modules and panels have been achieved (Fig. 9), their suitability for perovskite deposition and thin film formation needs further work, as does understanding the mechanism of perovskite film formation and the factors that are important for the quality of the thin films that include crystallinity and morphology. Finally, the current deposition methods need to be optimized to reduce the number of processing steps, and the successful integration of several solar modules is necessary before these systems make their way out of research laboratories into the real world.

Industrial and commercial standards require about 20% PCE for PSCs which as previously discussed has now been achieved; however, the phase and moisture stabilities of these systems are still problematic. Interdisciplinary collaborations between materials chemists and device physicists are still much needed to resolve these issues. The development of unique encapsulation materials and packaging technology without PCE degradation and compromising the stability of the PSC stability is also needed. Although, as discussed, the potential for developing low-cost PSCs is promising for commercialization, success hinges on the delicate balance between achieving high efficiencies and other business considerations such as long-term stabilities and large-scale construction. The utilization of perovskites on a commercial scale currently suffers from several drawbacks, the most important of which is stability, since the cells only survive for a few months in the open air, in sharp contrast to silicon solar panels that typically work for a minimum of 25 years. In this respect, climate change and extreme levels of light, temperature, and humidity all contribute to the breakdown of perovskite cells. Humidity is the most challenging problem since reaction with water creates hydrates that alter the structure of the crystals, preventing them from absorbing visible light. To solve this environmental instability, a water-resistant layer is typically applied to the surfaces of PSCs. In order to further improve the stability of PSC devices, hydrophobic additives are often used together with the perovskite, and cross-linking of the crystals with modified molecules is also employed. Over the last decade, the lifetimes of PSCs have increased from a few minutes to 6 months, but still much more work is needed. In the family of organic–inorganic halide perovskites, important physical properties such as strong broad intrinsic light absorption, low exciton bond energy, high charge carrier mobility, long diffusion length for the free carrier, and high PCEs have been effectively combined. However, there are still obstacles and problems in the way of the complete commercialization of the resulting PSCs. In addition, the improvement and development of cost effective, environmentally friendly synthetic pathways to new products with unique physical properties is also important, and represents an active area of research within this field to date.

Dopant-free HTMs play an important role in paving the path for the commercialization of PSCs. Small organic molecules, polymers, organometallic compounds, and inorganics make up the class of dopant-free HTMs. Thus far, high PCEs of about 23% have been obtained for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as polymeric dopant-free HTMs. Nevertheless, the most important factor limiting their large-scale applications is the very high synthetic cost of P3HT ($460 per g) and PTAA ($1980 per g). A facile synthetic strategy with limited steps, and involving inexpensive raw materials and minimal purification is an effective approach to decrease the cost of the HTM. The importance of the low quantity of usage and processability of inexpensive solutions in reducing production costs is also highly emphasized. Despite the low-cost advantages of inorganic HTMs, the limiting factor still hindering their large-scale production is solution processability. To the best of our knowledge, DFH with a value of $3 per g has the lowest cost amongst all dopant-free HTMs.

In addition to spiro-OMeTAD, a comparison was made between the synthetic costs and the PCEs of cells fabricated from small organic HTMs containing a TPA-AZO (20) HTM synthesized by Shahroosvand et al. In this respect, a PCE of up to 11.8% was obtained for a set of star-shaped HTMs made of TPA with diphenyl ethenyl side arms. An increase in PCE of up to 13.63% was demonstrated by introducing p-methoxy side groups. Furthermore, modification of the side arms of this group of materials with a bis-dimethylfluorenyl amino segment increased their charge transport properties, prevented their aggregation and improved their stability. A PCE of ∼18% was obtained for PSCs containing star-shaped structures. Among the TPA-based organic HTMs reported in Fig. 10, bis[(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenyl]ethene (EtheneDTPA) and tetrakis[(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenyl]ethane (EtheneTTPA), with values of $101.34 and 52.59 per g, respectively, have the lowest synthetic cost per g, after TPA-AZO. Despite the significant numbers of reported PCEs containing spirobifluorenes, thiophenes, triazatruxenes, azulenes and other small organic cores, their synthetic costs are all higher than that of TPA-AZO. Eqn (1) is typically employed to determine the cost-per-peak-Watt ($ per Wp, denoted here as Cw), where η is the solar cell efficiency in the range of 5–30%, Cg is the cost per gram, ρ is the density which is assumed to be 1.1 g cm−3, t is the thickness of the donor material and I is the solar insolation under peak conditions, which are assumed to be 100 nm and 1000 W m−2 respectively.

From the perspective of redox-active organic compounds, TPA is a strong electron donor that is commonly employed as an HTM in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), DSSCs, OPVs, and organic field-effect transistors. Structurally, the core of TPA has a butterfly-like shape with an sp2 central nitrogen that gives it a non-planar structure that can be used to control the packing of the molecules in the solid state and prevent aggregation, which in turn affects the optoelectrical properties of the resulting material. Together with their high hole mobilities, TPA molecules are sterically hindered and have hyperconjugation electronic effects, which in turn increase the stability of central nitrogen. After the innovation of doped conducting organic polymers by Heeger, MacDiarmid, and Shirakawa in 1976, organic materials were later revisited as possible candidates for organic optoelectronics, after which time the electronic properties and applications of phenylamine compounds were the first to be realized. Phenylamines are now widely used as HTMs in many organic electroluminescent devices due to their excellent charge transport capabilities. Furthermore, the presence of phenylamines in the molecular structure of organic polymers confers unique mechanical features. Ni(II) was first employed as a catalyst in a coupling polymerization affording TPA conjugated polymers in 1991. Furthermore, the environmental stability after doping and the high electrical conductivity of polyaniline make it an outstanding HTM when compared to other classes of TPAs and diphenylamine polymers.

HTMs that contain TPA show good thermal and morphological stabilities, as well as excellent charge transport and ionization potentials (IPs). Hole transport in aromatic amines is facilitated by the nitrogen donor atoms of the molecules, and as a consequence, the presence of different substituents on the aromatic amine affects their IPs. Non-amine type HTMs reported to date cannot compete with their TPA counterparts, with only one or two reported examples offering any promise. As a consequence, the electron-donating TPA unit has been utilized in many HTMs since it undergoes highly effective charge transport and the amine nitrogen atoms can be easily oxidized. HTMs based on linear oligomeric TPAs were shown to exhibit increased hole mobility as the number of TPA units increased, which was also accompanied by a shift in glass transition temperature (Tg) to higher values, Fig. 11. Research shows that the solubility of TPA containing HTMs is directly related to the number and type of alkyl chains in their structures, which also serve to improve their pore penetration in the resulting devices. To enhance the hole mobilities of TPA-based linear oligomers, the molecular structures of the molecules can be further modified by varying their heteroatoms and olefinic bonds. Nevertheless, researchers are mindful that certain features such as the facile packing and crystallization of ordered molecules can also significantly affect the stability of HTMs in the amorphous state. Although the planar molecular structures of TPA materials are uncomplex, their syntheses can be quite challenging. Researchers have therefore invested much time and effort over the past decade to develop facile synthetic strategies for these compounds. An overview of the design and development of TPA compounds for applications as HTMs in PSC devices is provided in the next sections of this review. Given the large number of TPA derivatives developed in this field to date, we have chosen to highlight only progress made in this field after 2017. We have also only included compounds that afforded PSCs with PCEs >15.

Spirobifluorene, which has a rigid spiro conjugated structure, containing an sp3 carbon that connects two orthogonal π-systems lends itself to be easily synthetically modified by chemists working to increase the hole transport properties of PSCs. A summary of the most significant advances made in this area is presented below. Firstly, the correlations between the molecular structures of four spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) HTMs, mp-SFX-3PA, mm-SFX-3PA, mp-SFX-2PA (Fig. 12), and mm-SFX-2PA (3PA = bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine and 2PA = bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline), and the photovoltaic (PV) performances of conventional (n–i–p) mesoporous devices were carefully investigated and optimized by varying the substitution positions of the TPA, or the diphenylamine side-chains (para- vs. meta). After doping, the HOMO energy levels range from −4.9 to −5.1 eV, and the hole mobilities range from 2.2 to 15 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Interestingly, the substitution positions had a negligible impact on the absorption properties and the energy levels of this family of HTMs. PSCs made from active layers of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) using mp-SFX-2PA exhibited a PCE of 16.8%, vs. 15.5% for the benchmark 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenyl amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) devices measured under the same conditions. Slightly lower HOMO energy levels, higher hole mobilities, better extraction, and enhanced charge-transfer capabilities are the most important factors that increase the PCEs. Devices based on mp-SFX-2PA, using a mixed FAPbI3/MAPbBr3 perovskite layer, had a PCE of 17.7%, which is within the experimental error of the value of 17.6% obtained for spiro-OMeTAD. The most important features of the mp-SFX-2PA-based device are the improved stability and hole mobility and the greater hydrophobicity of the doped compound, which maintains more than 90% of its original performance on exposure to air after 1000 h of storage. The authors also observed that these devices show higher stabilities than their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, studied under the same conditions.

Two novel D–A–D HTMs comprising two (Yih-1) or four (Yih-2) (Fig. 12) triarylamines appended to a spiro[fluorene-9,9′-phenanthren-10′-one] acceptor unit are the first reported examples of HTMs with spiro linkages for n–i–p planar PSC applications, Fig. 11. A cost-effective facile synthetic method afforded these compounds in high yields (US$29.14–US$29.57 per g). PV studies on the resulting PSCs reveal a slightly higher hole mobility and shunt resistance Rsh, a lower series resistance Rs, improved PSC performance, and a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) for Yih-2, when compared to Yih-1. As a consequence, PSCs fabricated from the superior HTM Yih-2 achieved a Jsc of 22.18 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.02 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.71 and a PCE of 16.06%. This PCE is very close to the value obtained for spiro-OMeTAD (16.08%), which is attributed to its similar hole mobility and charge transfer efficiency. The Yih-2-based PSC device showed better durability in a 216 h experiment versusspiro-OMeTAD. Also, the moisture resistance of D–A–D HTMs is much better than those of their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, which is important to increase the lifetimes of PSCs in ambient environments.
A recent study by Lee et al. reported the novel, symmetrical spiro-bifluorene spiro-tBuBED (Fig. 12), comprising di-t-butyl-TPA end groups and 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) π-bridges. This compound can be synthesized on a gram scale via facile C–H arylation, which lends itself to both academic and industrial applications. The n–i–p mesoscopic perovskite-based devices containing spiro-tBuBED hole transfer layers showed a promising PCE of 18.6%, without the need for any additional oxidation process. This value is higher than the PCEs reported for spiro-OMeTAD employed in standard devices.
A new star-shaped spiro-OMeTAD derivative, 2,6,14-tris(5′-(N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenol-4-yl)-3,4-ethylene dioxy-thiophene-2-yl)-triptycene, TET, was reported (Fig. 12 and 13a), which has an interesting 3-D structural topology due to the attachment of a triptycene core to three triarylamine arms via 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene linkers. The use of TET as a hole selective layer (HSL) for the fabrication of n–i–p planar PSCs gave the best PCE of 19.1% under reverse voltage scans, and a steady-state efficiency of 18.6%, which is comparable to the PCE of 19.5% and a steady-state efficiency of 19.0% for PSC devices containing spiro-OMeTAD. The laboratory preparation and purification costs of TET are estimated to be ∼$123 g−1, which is approximately a quarter of the cost of the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD (ca. $500 g−1). More importantly, efficient PSCs containing thin films of TET (about 30 nm) are reported to show very good stabilities under continuous illumination.

Two new donor–acceptor (D–A) HTMs containing co-oligomers prepared via an S,N-heteroacene substitution reaction were subsequently fabricated into triple cation-based PSCs (Fig. 14). Optical and electrochemical studies on both HTMs revealed that they have suitable energy levels for n–i–p mesoscopic PSC applications. The PSC device containing HTM-1 afforded the highest PCE of 17.7%, possibly due to lower non-radiation recombination. The potential of these novel HTMs was investigated based on optoelectronic properties in terms of conductivity, series resistance, and charge carrier recombination. The injection of the hole from the perovskite valence band into the HTMs follows a process that is consistent with the position of the energy level of the HOMO, as revealed by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The simple, high yielding synthetic pathway together with high device performances make these new D–A substituted S,N-heteroacenes promising candidates as HTMs for PSCs.

More recently, several novel small organic surface passivation molecules containing the same tri-phenylamine group have been prepared and characterized as HTMs for n–i–p planar PSCs (Fig. 15a). The most important features of these newly designed molecules are the transportability of the carrier and the potential for defective passivity. The authors found that the Voc of devices containing the surface passivation molecule N-((4-(N,N,N-triphenyl)phenyl)ethyl)ammonium bromide (TPA-PEABr) (Fig. 14) increased from 1.02 V to 1.09 V, which subsequently increased the efficiency of the PSCs from 16.69% to 18.15%. This study reveals that the introduction of a simple TPA-PEABr molecular layer at the perovskite/spiro-OMETAD interface simultaneously facilitates moisture resistance, good energy level alignment, and a reduction in the density of defects. The results of this study also successfully show that the precise design of functionalized small organic molecules to passivate the perovskite surface can afford PSCs with high stabilities and good efficiencies.

The utilization of thiophene cores for the development of HTMs for applications as cost-effective, high-performance PSCs is an active area of research. In this respect, the PV data for PSCs containing linear HTMs with terminal TPA units are summarized in Table 1.

In 2019 a novel HTM with a thiophene-core, D1, prepared via a straightforward, low-cost synthetic route was reported (Fig. 15b). The authors demonstrated the utility of D1 for n–i–p mesoscopic PSC applications due to its good solubility, high hole mobility, and suitable HOMO energy level. PSCs containing D1 gave the best PCE of 16.5%, which is lower than the PCE of 19.8% recorded for benchmark spiro-OMeTAD-based systems. Devices based on D1 exhibited higher stabilities than their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts at room temperature without any encapsulation at a relative humidity of 40%, after continuous operation at 1 sun illumination in the dark, and under a nitrogen atmosphere with maximum power-point tracking. Furthermore, the cost of these HTMs is approximately 1/30 that of spiro-OMeTAD.
An easy, low-cost synthetic strategy for the realization of HTMs involves the insertion of double bonds, to prepare highly efficient, stable PSCs, suitable for commercial applications. Following this strategy in 2017, two HTMs with novel thiophene-cores, Z25 and Z26, were synthesized via simple low-cost processes by Li et al. The latter was prepared by introducing two double bonds into Z25, and when employed in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs, it has a higher conductivity, more homogeneous surface and higher hole mobility. As a consequence, devices made from Z26 as the HTM exhibit a high PCE of 20.1%, which is close to the PCE of 20.6% for spiro-OMeTAD. Studies revealed that the stability of devices fabricated from Z26, when compared to Z25 and spiro-OMeTAD (when aging at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere including a humidity of approximately 30% or 85%, without encapsulation in the dark and under full radiation sunlight), is higher with maximum power point tracking. In 2017, two thiophene-arylamine HTMs, H-3,4 and H-2,5, were also reported in which the substitution positions on the thiophene π-linker of the arylamine fragments were varied (Fig. 19c). Photophysical, hole mobility, electrochemical and PV studies of these compounds confirmed that the substitution pattern of the arylamine fragments greatly influences the performance of the resulting n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. In this respect, when the arylamine fragments are located on the 2,5-substitution position of the thiophene ring, the π-conjugation ability and hole mobility are obviously better than that of 3,4-substituted analogue, thus devices containing H-2,5 have better performances. The use of the 2,5-system as an HTM in a solar cell containing CH3NH3PbI3 afforded a PCE of 15.13%, which is 40% higher than that of its H-3,4-counterpart and comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD. This is attributed to the superior π-conjugation in H-2,5 over H-3,4, since in the latter it is decreased due to the presence of the single bond in the thiophene unit.

A series of recent studies on D–π–D HTMs are presented in this next section demonstrating how the nature of the π-linkers has a significant effect on PSC performance and highlighting the promise of using carbazole units for the development of efficient small molecule HTMs.

The role of o,p-dimethoxy phenyl units in the advancement of small molecule HTMs for n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs with high stability and high performance was investigated through the discovery of two HTMs, HL-1 and HL-2, containing biphenyl and carbazole moieties in their π-system, respectively. Devices containing HL-2 had the highest efficiencies, with the best PCE of 18.34%, when compared to 16.14% for HL-1. A comparison of the hystereses in both devices showed a significant hysteresis in the HL-1 based system and a small hysteresis in the HL-2 PSC. Furthermore, HL-2 devices had higher hole mobilities due to the better electron-donating nature of the carbazole unit when compared to biphenyl. A comparison of the steady-state photoluminescence studies for both systems also confirmed that HL-2 is better at efficiently extracting charge carriers at the perovskite/HTM interface when compared to HL-1. Studies also revealed that the preparation of a dense film of HL-2 void of any pinholes improved the FF and Voc since it prevents non-radiative charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface. What is notable is the presence of long hexyl chains in HL-2, which create a steric barrier to prevent migration of the halogen from the perovskite layer to the Ag electrode. This results in a small reduction in the hysteresis of the device and an increase in thermal stability at 85 °C, without encapsulation, when compared to its HL-1 counterpart.
Three novel D–π–D TPA-based HTMs (H-Bi, H-Fi, and H-Ca) containing biphenyl, fluorene, and carbazole π-linkers were prepared via the facile synthetic strategy shown in Fig. 16a. Although all three compounds have compatible HOMO energy levels with respect to the perovskite, compounds containing carbazole and biphenyl π-linkers exhibited higher hole mobilities than their fluorene analogue, affording better hole extraction capacities at the perovskite/HTM interface. Studies reveal that n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs containing carbazole units (H-Ca) have the highest efficiencies, which are close to those of standard spiro-OMeTAD. Despite the fact that the HOMO of the fluorene-based compound was determined to be the best match to the perovskite layer, its low hole mobility limited its PV performance in devices. In more recent studies, a new HTM, LD22, containing carbazole and TPA moieties, has been prepared and subsequently employed in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs (Fig. 17a). It should be noted that LD22 has a HOMO energy of −5.27 eV, a hole mobility of 1.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a Tg of 132 °C. Its comparable ability to extract charge when compared to spiro-OMeTAD was demonstrated by photoluminescence measurements. A promising improvement in PCE was achieved from 13.04 to 17.18% after doping the LD22-based PSCs. This value is comparable to the PCE of 17.73% measured for devices doped with spiro-OMeTAD. It is also noteworthy that the cost of synthesizing LD22 in the laboratory is reported to be significantly less than that of the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD.
Simple, inexpensive, highly efficient HTMs for the fabrication of inverted perovskite devices prepared via the appropriate combination of linear π-conjugated cores and end-capping TPA are a major goal of researchers working in this field.
In 2017, Lam et al. developed two inexpensive, solution-processable small molecule HTMs (E)-4,4′-(ethene-1,2-diylbis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline), TPA-TVT-TPA and 4,4′-(naphthalene-2,6-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline), TPA-NAP-TPA. These compounds contain linear planar π-conjugated cores and TPA end-capping methoxy groups and were successfully employed in inverted p–i–n planar perovskite devices. Both compounds have HOMO energy levels that are suitable for hole injection, and sufficient LUMOs for electron blocking capabilities. The PCEs of the resulting devices are 16.32% for TPA-TVT-TPA and 14.63% for TPA-NAP-TPA, which are among the highest reported to date for inverted p–i–n planar perovskite systems. Furthermore, PSCs containing TPA-TVT-TPA have an effective Voc of 1.07 V.

The development of simple, TPA-based HTMs with π-conjugated linkers, as alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD, is currently an active area of research in the field of PVs. In this respect, two new, cost-effective small molecular HTMs, N4,N4,N4″,N4′″-tetrakis(4-methoxy phenyl)-[1,1′:4′,1″:4″,1″′-quaterphenyl]-4,4″′-diamine (TPA-BP-TPA) and (E)-4′,4″-(ethene-1,2-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxy phenyl)-[1″,1″-biphenyl]-4-amine) (TPA-BPV-TPA), synthesized by conventional Suzuki coupling reactions have been investigated for application in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. These compounds contain linear π-conjugated linkers and TPA end caps. Their good solubilities and suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels are the most significant features of these two compounds. Under the same test conditions (AM1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2), PSCs containing TPA-BPV-TPA had a PCE of 16.42%, which is comparable to the PCE of 16.81% for the benchmark HTM, spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, the maintenance of approximately 87% of the initial performance of the device after 10 days, versus the reference device, is consistent with the excellent stability of the HTM.

Organic molecules comprising two-dimensional π-conjugated triphenylene cores are also promising for applications as HTMs in PSCs. In this respect, two organic HTMs containing a 2-D triphenylene core and methoxy-arylamine end units, 4,4′-(triphenylene-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (TPH-T) and N2,N2,N7,N7-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)triphenylene-2,7-diamine (TPH-D), were developed and applied in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. The introduction of methoxy-TPA side groups into the TPH-T based PSC devices afforded a remarkable PCE of 19.4%, which is significantly greater than those of the comparable devices containing spiro-OMeTAD. This superior device performance is attributed to their favorable energy level distribution, charge extraction ability, and very high charge mobility.

The realization of efficient, stable, flexible PSCs by exploiting the properties of small molecule HTMs, with desirable conductivities, suitable energy levels, and good chemical stability, is also an important area of research. In recent years, the TPA-based small molecule N,N′-bis-(1-naphthalenyl)-N,N′-bis-phenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine, NPB, has been investigated for use as a multifunctional buffer at a PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. In this respect, the NPB buffer layer is introduced to prevent the reduction reaction between the PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite precursor, to adjust the mismatch between the PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite layer, and improve the quality of the perovskite film by reducing defects and pinholes at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. Consequently, when PEDOT:PSS was coated with NPB, a significant improvement in the PCE of these inverted p–i–n planar devices was achieved from 15.4 to 18.4%. The best efficiency of 14.4% was obtained for flexible devices without hysteresis. Most importantly, the NPB-modified device displayed excellent long-term resistance to humidity and ultraviolet light in an ambient environment and after UV-light soaking, consistent with its superior stability.

The excellent performance of semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) is promising for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and tandem devices. In this respect, a solution-processed cross-linked HTL prepared via the polymerization of N4,N4′-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N4,N4′-bis(4-vinylphenyl)biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (VNPB) was evaluated as a new HTL to replace conventional spiro-OMeTAD in n–i–p planar device architecture comprising FTO/SnO2/C60-SAM/Perovskite/HTL/MoOx/ultra-thin gold/MoOx ST-PSC. Studies revealed that high efficiency could be achieved by post-annealing the completed devices including poly-VNPB and a dielectric–metal–dielectric transparent electrode, MoOx/Au/MoOx. Following this strategy, it was possible to obtain PCEs between 7.4 and 16.7%, with an average visible transmittance (AVT) (defined here between 400 and 800 nm) between 10 and 30%. These values are close to the PCE of 16.1% obtained for a benchmark spiro-OMeTAD-device. The doping of poly-VNPB with MoOx was determined to be the most important factor in improving the conductivity. In this respect, it is more likely that the increase in charge extraction and the suppression of the recombination of the charge carriers improve the performance of the devices. Although the efficiencies of these devices are similar to those of spiro-OMeTAD, poly-VNPB HTLs afford devices with remarkably increased long-term stabilities, under both continuous light and high humidity conditions.
Non-spiro(TFSI)2 organic salts for spiro-OMeTAD doping have also been employed for the realization of highly efficient and stable PSC devices. Subsequent application of two new organic salts (MeO-TPD)TFSI and (TBD)TFSI with a spiro(TFSI)2 sub-structure as dopants for spiro-OMeTAD was reported in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Firstly, when both organic salts were used for spiro-OMeTAD doping, a PCE of 18.6% was obtained in the absence of LiTFSI, which is close to the value of 19.1% for co-doped standard cells with FK209 and LiTFSI. The significant improvement in the moisture resistance of the doped (MeO-TPD)TFSI device was attributed to the removal of the moisture-sensitive LiTFSI additive.
A new HTM with a planarized quart-p-phenylene core was synthesized and fully characterized by Grätzel et al. The presence of four lateral tetraketal substituents appended to two central rings on a planar tetrahydropyrene core protects the core from oxidation. Passivation via coordination to the perovskite surface was confirmed by UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence studies, as well as theoretical, electrochemical, and thermal studies. The development of solution-processable HTMs was possible using electron-donor diphenylamine substituents that have appropriate energy levels and improved solubilities. The characterization of regular n–i–p mesoscopic triple-cation perovskite Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)(100−x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 devices containing quart-p-phenylene derivatives showed a PCE of 15.3%, a Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.042 V, and a FF of 0.73, values that are very similar to those of spiro-OMeTAD.

Three simple molecular semiconductors containing 9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene, 9,9-dimethyl-2,7-diphenyl-9H-fluorene, and 2,6-diphenyl dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene have been employed as conjugated quasi-linear fractions together with two bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino end-capping groups (Z1–Z3). Among them, Z3 containing a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene moiety was identified as a promising HTM for PSC applications (Fig. 18). Space charge-limited current and X-ray diffraction measurements on solution-deposited films reveal that, for these systems, crystallinity is the most important factor governing the mobility of the thin films. Given that decreasing the energetic driving force of the hole extraction is an unfavorable effect, increasing the interfacial interactions between the perovskite and Z3 reduced this unfavorable effect as confirmed by photoluminescence and photoelectron spectroscopy. The n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs fabricated from Z3 are very efficient with PCEs of 20.84%, which are slightly higher than the PCEs of 20.42% obtained for devices containing spiro-OMeTAD. This study established that the suitably aligned HOMO energy level of Z3 and its propensity to afford a highly mobile thin film are the two most important factors underpinning the effective operation of these devices.

Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) derivatives have fused thiophene rings that permit effective π-conjugation, highlighting their importance as organic PVs in this field. The HTMs H16 and H18 were prepared via the cross-linking of donor groups based on triarylamine to new 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (MPDTP) and N-(4-(4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-4-yl)phenyl)-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (TPDTP) cores respectively (Fig. 19a). The n–i–p mesoscopic device studies revealed that H16 is the most efficient due to the presence of a central MPDTP core which affords improved conductivity, higher hole mobility, and a better-quality thin film. The performance of HTM-based optimized devices was evaluated under the same conditions. A PCE of 18.16% was observed for H16, which is close to the PCE of 18.27% obtained for the standard spiro-OMeTAD, and much higher than the PCE of 15.29% obtained for H18. In addition, the good stabilities of devices fabricated from H16 after two months of storage in the dark at 20% controlled humidity were ascertained via long-term aging tests. The synthetic cost of producing H16 is around 1/5 that of spiro-OMeTAD, highlighting the economic advantage of utilizing DTP building blocks for the development of efficient PSCs.
In 2018, Wang et al. prepared two cost-effective HTLs containing dimethyltriphenylamino moieties bearing dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole substituents, AZ1 (with one n-propyl lateral substituent) and AZ2 (with 4-methoxyphenyl), for application in n–i–p mesoscopic triple-cation lead halide PSCs. Structural studies supported by theoretical modeling of the microscopic hole transport paths revealed that the shortening of the dimer-to-dimer distance due to a significantly attenuated slip in the direction of the short molecular axis is attributed to the presence of the 4-methoxyphenyl substituents appended to the dithienopyrrole framework in AZ2. Furthermore, the higher hole mobility of the AZ2 thin film is attributed to its microstructural properties. The improvement of its hole extraction kinetics, despite its smaller stimulus energy, is most likely due to the weak interactions between the Pb2+ ions in the perovskite layer and the 4-methoxyphenyl substituents. Most importantly, the slight hysteresis during potential reverse and forward scans, together with the higher mobility of the thin film, is attributed to the passivity of trap states at the perovskite grain boundary. The best performance with a value of 19.4% for the PCE was obtained for PSCs containing AZ2, which is higher than the PCE of 19.1% obtained for a standard device containing spiro-OMeTAD.

The attractive semiconductor properties of thiophene-based p-type molecules have led to the widespread study of these molecules and their use in optoelectronic devices. In recent years, TPA-based HTMs with 4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene cores have been prepared and characterized. The influences of methoxy and alkyl substituents appended to TPA and cyclopentadithiophene moieties on the thermal and optoelectronic properties as well as the performance of these HTMs in n–i–p mesoscopic PSC devices were investigated. These systems can be prepared in high yields via cross-coupling reactions, in a strategy that involves minimal synthetic and purification steps to reduce the overall synthetic costs. Two molecules CDTh 1 and CDTh-EtHex 2 exhibited superior thermal stabilities when utilized as HTMs in fabricated PSCs (Fig. 20) and gave competitive performances when compared to the benchmark HTM, spiro-OMeTAD. Their excellent thermal stabilities are attributed to the functionalized cyclopentadithiophene cores, and both HTMs are able to effectively extract holes from the perovskite. The authors concluded that CDTh 1 and CDTh-EtHex 2 are interesting alternatives to the expensive spiro-OMeTAD for the development of commercial PSCs in light of their facile syntheses, purification, and excellent performances in devices.

The multistep synthesis of HTM-1 containing an acridine–cyclopentadithiophene central core with tri-arylamine moieties has been reported. The molecule has C2v symmetry with a spiro configuration and its application as a hole conductor for the fabrication of highly efficient, stable n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs has been investigated. Studies showed that HTM-1 has higher hole mobility, better thermal stability, and better moisture stability when compared to spiro-MeOTAD. Furthermore, the use of a 40 nm thin layer of HTM-1 was suitable for hole extraction, and also showed a stabilized efficiency of nearly 21% under standard illumination conditions. The Jsc and FF were 24.7 mA cm−2 and 0.77, respectively, attributed to the higher hole mobility (µh) in a low electric field. Most importantly, the superior long-term operational stabilities of HTM-1 devices under continuous light for 400 hours and good thermal stability at 80 °C are assigned to the high Tg of 168 °C and excellent moisture resistance. Given the high performance and remarkable stability of this system, it is particularly attractive for the future development of stable, efficient PSCs.
Two-dimensional materials based on 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) are also promising candidates as HTMs for highly efficient and stable n–i–p mesoscopic perovskite PV devices. In this context, several new two-dimensional HTMs based on small molecules with 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene central cores bearing TPA- and carbazole substituents were designed and utilized for the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. The central sections of the π-bridge were altered in a rational manner to explore the correlation between the chemical structures of the HTMs and their PV performance. In this respect, solar cells prepared from the ring-bridged CT series exhibited considerably higher performances when compared to the non-bridged S2. This is ascribed to: (i) the good match of the HOMO energy level to that of the perovskite, (ii) their high uniform coating on the perovskite layer, (iii) the more effective hole injection ability from the perovskite layer into the HOMO of the HTMs, and (iv) their higher hole mobility, indicating the impact of the planarity of the central core on the crystal packing of the molecules and thus the PV performance. After optimization, devices fabricated from CT1 as the HTM showed an excellent PCE of 17.71% with an FTO/TiO2 compact layer/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/MoO3/Ag configuration, which is comparable to the PCE of 16.97% recorded for spiro-OMeTAD, under the same conditions. Furthermore, CT1-containing devices had higher stabilities after 1300 h when compared to their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, without any encapsulation.
The use of a central 4-dicyanomethylene-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene core also shows promise for the design of efficient HTMs. Recently, three new D–A–D HTMs, YC-1–YC-3, were developed for use in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. These systems contain 4-dicyanomethylene-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (DiCN-CPDT) central cores connected to two peripheral arylamino groups (Fig. 13b). A systematic investigation and comparison of this family of compounds with spiro-OMeTAD with respect to hole mobility, steady-state photoluminescence, the surface morphology of the thin films above the perovskite layer, and PV performance were performed. The highest hole mobility and extraction properties at the perovskite/HTM interface were obtained for YC-1. In addition, its improved FF and Voc are attributed to the homogeneous and dense coating of the YC-1 layer on the thin films, without any pinholes on the perovskite layer. Consequently, a PCE of 18.03% was obtained for PSCs fabricated from YC-1 with low hysteresis, which is close to the value of 18.14% obtained for their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts. Most importantly, the hydrophobic nature of YC-1 and the homogeneous nature of the thin films improved the long-term stabilities of YC-1 based devices, so that they maintained 85% of their original efficiency over 500 h, at a relative humidity of 30%.
To extract carriers from the adsorbent to the cathode, the HTM acts as a pump that is necessary to facilitate PCEs in PSCs. In this regard, naphtha[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene (NDT) or 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bis-thiophene (PBT) π-bridges have been employed to connect two electron-rich, 4′,4″-dimethoxy donors for the discovery of a new family of HTMs. Studies have shown that hole mobility, UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and optoelectronic properties (including photoluminescence (PL), recombination kinetics, charge collection probability (Pc), PCE, and IPCE) are strongly related to the different π-bridge between the donor groups. DFT calculations confirm that the two compounds have similar matching frontier orbital energies to the perovskite layer. A comparison of the central cores shows that the NDT annulated core has better hole mobility, PV conversion, and thermal properties in the n–i–p planar PSCs when compared to PBT. As a consequence, the PCE for NDT is 18.8%, which is much higher than the PCE of 13.6% obtained for PBT, and close to the value of 18.1% obtained for the standard spiro-OMeTAD.
More recently, two novel HTMs comprising indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) cores bearing different side chains, IDT1 and IDT2, were reported. Studies revealed that IDT1 featuring alkylbenzene side chains exhibited a better morphology and hole transport properties, leading to a higher hole mobility, a better matched HOMO energy level, and a superior thin film. Both compounds were applied as HTMs for the fabrication of n–i–p mesoporous structured PSCs. IDT1 achieved the highest PCE of 19.55% and better stability when compared to spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 19.25%) and IDT2 (PCE = 15.77%) based PSCs. The IDT1 based device also displayed good long-term environmental stability with PCE loss <15% after 500 h in air. These results clearly demonstrate that IDT fused rings can be exploited as promising cores for the development of highly efficient HTMs.
Two novel HTMs with a D–A–D configuration, YN1 and YN2, containing a TPA donor and a benzothiadiazole (BT) or thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) acceptor were also synthesized and used in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Both HTMs have low HOMO levels and good mobilities. The YN2-based PSCs afforded PCEs of 19.27% in air (Fig. 21), which is superior to the value of 17.80% for devices fabricated from spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, the PCE is much lower for the YN1-containing PSCs (16.03%). The authors concluded that the PCEs of YN2-based PSC devices can be improved by inserting a stronger electron-acceptor into the molecular structure of YN2. In addition, PSC devices containing YN2 maintained 91.3% of their original when compared to just 42.2% for the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs, after 1000 h in a dark environment. As a consequence, this study highlights the promise of rationally designed D–A–D HTMs for the realization of highly stable, efficient PSCs.
The improved performance of amide based HTMs, despite their lack of a conjugated backbone, provides an alternative family of building blocks for the discovery of novel low-cost PSCs. To target the synthesis of such cost-effective HTMs, the compound 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT-amide-TPA) was synthesized via a simple condensation reaction, which was amenable to preparation on a large scale, resulting in an estimated material cost of only $5 g−1 (Fig. 22). When EDOT-amide-TPA was applied in n–i–p planar PSCs, the resulting devices showed stabilized efficiencies of up to 20.0% and reproducibly outperformed their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts. Studies revealed that the improved performance of this compound can be attributed to the fast charge injection at the perovskite/EDOT-amide-TPA interface. The unique ability of the amide bond to coordinate with the Li-additive (LiTFSI) provides a novel strategy to prohibit the migration of the additive migration and is more likely the reason for the improved lifetime of the resulting PV devices.

The development of cost-effective, high-performance linear HTMs with non-fused oligothiophene cores also offers an interesting strategy for the development of 3G PSCs. In the past few years, Liu et al. reported a one-pot synthetic strategy (Fig. 19b) to access oligoaryls with a D–π–D–π–D configuration. This involves sequential C–H (hetero)arylations, rather than the more established Stille or Suzuki coupling reactions. Studies of n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs fabricated from the best HTM M104, versusspiro-OMeTAD, performed using continuous PCE versus time measurements, revealed that within 10 s, high PCEs were achieved that remained constant for more than 600 s. In this respect, the PCE of PSCs containing M104 was 15.3%, which matched well with the value achieved from the J–V curves. A significant reduction in the number of synthetic steps from 7–8 to 2 steps and a comparison of the synthetic methodology with the most commonly used Stille or Suzuki reactions demonstrate the potential of this strategy to afford affordable building blocks for application in materials chemistry and organic electronics. As previously mentioned, for high-performance linear HTMs, the core plays the most important role in dictating their suitability for PSC applications. Most strategies presented to date have focused on the advancement of fused heterocyclic cores. However, non-fused heterocycles are also worthy of consideration since they can be easily synthesized. In this respect, the use of various non-fused cores to prepare a low-cost series of TPA-containing linear HTMs, M101–M106, was reported in 2018 by Liang et al. Detailed studies on these systems revealed that their energy levels, conductivity, solubility, and hole mobility are again significantly affected by the core. In this respect, M101 and M102 have thiophene and 2,2′-bithiophene cores, respectively. Taking the prototype M102 as the structural reference, the authors introduced an additional 3-hexylthiophene unit in the center of the core to afford M103, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) to afford M104, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to give M105. Compound M106 containing a carbazole group was also prepared as the reference system. The role of these dumbbell-shaped molecules in effecting π–π stacking and orthogonal interactions, as well as the provision of possible channels for charge transfer among the HTM molecules, was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies. HTMs with improved hole mobility and conduction were achieved by extending the degree of conjugation as the number of thiophene rings increased. The surface morphology, conductivity, and hole mobility of M103 and M104 containing non-fused oligothiophene cores were the highest. Under the same illumination conditions of AM1.5 sun, the highest PCE was 16.50% for n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs fabricated from M104, which was comparable to 16.67% for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, the lowest PCE was reported for devices fabricated from M105, which was attributed to the low quality of the HTM layer. The synthesis of M104 was reported to cost $49.38 per g, which is just 1/3 the cost of spiro-OMeTAD estimated to be $166 per g (purchased from p-OLED (China)).

As mentioned previously, the development of low-cost alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs is one of the bottlenecks preventing the acceleration of commercial applications of these devices. As previously discussed, the combination of electron-rich conjugated cores with arylamine terminal groups with a D–π–D configuration has resulted in the discovery of several families of alternative compounds. However, these are not without their problems, and although several novel HTMs that perform better than spiro-OMeTAD have been reported, undesirable changes in HOMO energy levels and lower stabilities often result from the combination of electron-rich cores. To address these challenges, efficient electron units offer lots of benefits for creating efficient, stable PV dyes and polymers. In this context, to rationally adjust the HOMO energy levels of small molecules, two HTMs, TQ1 and TQ2 with a D–A–D configuration containing quinoxaline, were designed and synthesized for use in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. A comparison of the performance of TQ1/2-based PSCs under the same conditions showed that TQ2 has the highest PCE of 19.62% in a working area of 0.09 cm2, while the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD- and TQ1 devices had PCEs of 18.54% and 14.27% respectively. Photoluminescence quenching, mobility, and conductivity experiments, together with single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, were carried out to study the differences in the hole extraction and charge transfer properties of TQ1 and TQ2. In this regard, changing the substituents appended to the quinoxaline core from phenyl in TQ1 to thienyl in TQ2 not only reduced the time of the hole extraction from 16.6 to 3.4 ns but also increased the hole mobility from 9.45 × 10−5 to 2.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the conductivity from 6.58 × 10−5 to 9.19 × 10−4 S cm−1. It is apparent from this work that the thienyl substitutes in TQ2 cause charge transfer in the HTM layer through strong intermolecular S⋯S and S–π interactions, thereby decreasing the intermolecular distances and enhancing the hole hopping channels identified by single-crystal analysis. A promising efficiency of 18.50% was achieved by scaling the TQ2-containing device to 1.02 cm2, which is attributed to the high uniformity of the thin film. The extremely low synthetic cost of preparing these compounds, together with their excellent PV performances, offers exciting promise for the future development of new D–A–D systems suitable for commercial applications.
Four HTMs, CS01, CS03, LCS01, and EP02, were prepared via a short, low-cost synthetic route. These compounds contain a benzothiadiazole (BT) central core and methoxyphenyl substituents and were studied for their potential applications in n–i–p mesoscopic triple-cation mixed-halide PSCs (Fig. 23a). In this work, LCS01 and CSO1 had the best PCEs of 18.05 and 17.84%, respectively. There was a suitable alignment between the HOMO and LUMO levels of these two compounds with the valence band of the triple-cation mixed-halide perovskites, and their hole mobilities were similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD. Smoother films and minimal carrier recombination kinetics were subsequently achieved by incorporating methoxy groups and enhancing the conjugation in molecules. Consequently, following the latter strategy, the carrier losses decreased significantly, and the solar cell efficiency increased remarkably, attributed largely to the presence of the phenyl ring in the molecular structures of CS01 and LCS01. The authors concluded that in addition to tuning the HOMO energy levels of the HTMs to improve their alignment with the perovskite, other important factors must also be considered for the successful discovery of novel, efficient HTMs, which include their hole mobility, thermal stability, and solubility in organic solvents.

The PV data of PSCs containing HTMs with star-shaped structures and TPA units are summarized in Table 2. In contrast to employing traditional multistep syntheses, a greener two-step synthetic route to several star-shaped HTMs with TPA cores, involving sequential Sn-free direct C–H arylation reactions, has been reported for the facile synthesis of small-molecule HTMs for n–i–p mesoscopic PSC applications (Fig. 24). It is noteworthy that this synthetic strategy did not require the preparation or use of toxic organotin reagents and afforded the target compounds in moderate to excellent yields. In this study, the authors investigated how (i) the length of the side groups (from –OMe to –OC6H13 and from –SMe to –SC12H25) and (ii) the size/bulkiness of the side chains/groups affected the properties of the resulting PSC devices. In this respect, there were significant differences in the PCEs for devices YC02 and YC03, containing sulfur side chains, whereas no significant changes were observed on changing the size of the chain from –OMe to –OC6H13 in [BMPA-EDOT]3-TPA and YC01. More importantly, the authors proposed that the t-butyl group could be a useful alternative to the most commonly employed methoxy groups since a promising efficiency of 17.69% was obtained for the YC04-based solar device, with t-Bu side chains.

PSCs of up to 17.7% have been reported for TPA-based starburst HTMs by Lee et al. via a tin-free synthetic route for use in n–i–p PSCs. This work was expanded in 2019, to include a family of new small starburst molecules, comprising four different carbazole end groups. Simple sequential direct C–H activation/arylation cross-coupling reactions afforded these compounds in good, isolated yields (70–84%) (Fig. 25). The advantage of this synthetic method is that it does not employ toxic organotin reagents and so it is a practical alternative to the Stille coupling reactions, most commonly employed to prepare π-conjugated organic materials. Studies revealed that PSC devices prepared from the HTM core YC05–08 displayed moderate to good PCEs of 13.3–17.4%.
The spontaneous absorption of organic molecules on the surfaces of molecular components of a vapor or liquid phase results in the formation of ordered arrays referred to as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). SAMs are 2D nanomaterials with thicknesses of one or a few molecules. It is possible to control the ability of molecules or ligands to adsorb onto the surface via chemical functionalization. The classification of SAMs into crystalline, semi-crystalline, or amorphous structures depends on the packing of molecules and the organization of the layer. SAMs usually consist of three parts: (i) an anchoring group that connects molecules to the surface through chemical bonding, (ii) a linkage that influences the packing arrangement of the SAMs, and (iii) a functional group (terminal or tail group) that changes their surface and interfacial properties. Use of SAMs is the most effective way to improve the performance of solar cell devices in photovoltaics. The main focus of using SAMs is to minimize trap passivation and charge recombination at the m-TiO2 interface. In addition, improved electronic states and stability are achieved by passivating metal oxide oxygen vacancies and perovskite defects through chemical bonding by SAMs. Facilitating charge extraction and improving device performance are achieved in SAMs by changing the interfacial layer from Pb-rich to Pb-poor composition. The migration of ions, I− oxidation, or the evaporation of methylammonium iodide (MAI) results in trap states at the surface and grain boundaries, which are usually represented as under-coordinated metal cations or halide anions. To date, the addition of various types of passivation materials (also known as passivators) to perovskite films has led to the induction of defect passivation through coordination with under-coordinated metal cations or halide anions. Lewis acids or bases, as a group of passivator substances, are reported to have special effects on certain defects. For example, the Lewis acid phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) eliminates notorious photocurrent hysteresis by passivating trap states through coordination with halide ions. Atoms with lone pairs of electrons, especially nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, act as Lewis bases and electron donors. Hence, the effective passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ ions in perovskite films has been demonstrated by molecules with specific functional groups that include amino, amide, carboxylic acid, sulfonate, cyano, and carbonyl groups.
Following this study, two SAMs TPA and MC-43 constructed from semiconducting organic molecules as HTMs have been employed instead of the p-type contact, PEDOT:PSS, in inverted p–i–n planar methylammonium lead iodide PSCs. Studies revealed that the SAMs exhibited increased hole extraction in inverted PSCs since they can function as surface modifiers if assembled directly onto an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The effects of the SAMs on perovskite formation, surface wettability, and the PV function of solar cells were also investigated. Studies showed that perovskite p–i–n-based solar cells exhibited high efficiencies and did not require any mineral oxides or HTMs based on semiconductor polymers. Significant PCEs were obtained by fabricating solar cells with SAMs that have a planar p–i–n structure. The MC-43-based cell showed the best performance with a PCE of 17.3%, a FF of 80%, a Voc of 1.07 V and a Jsc of 20.3 mA cm−2. In contrast, the TPA-based cell had a PCE of 15.9%, a FF of 77%, a Voc of 1.06 V, and a Jsc of 19.4 mA cm−2. A comparison of the device parameters of the two systems revealed that MC-43 is superior to TPA due to its better charge transferability. In other words, its more facile redox properties result in better energy alignment with the perovskite layer. The most important advantages of this study are the employment of a very easy deposition method and the ability of these HTMs to form strong covalent bonds with the metal oxides, which reduces charge losses and ensures contact selectivity. Making more durable perovskite films by combining D–π–A organic dyes with perovskites is an important strategy for the development of efficient, stable PSCs. More recently, the organic donor–π–acceptor chromophore (E)-3-(5-(4-(bis(2′,4′-dibutoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (D35) was used to enhance the performance of perovskite devices in an effective versatile strategy, where it was employed as an interlayer between the perovskite adsorbent and the HTM in n–i–p mesoporous PSCs. In this respect, the organic D–π–A interlayer was primarily utilized to improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film and create a very smooth perovskite/HTM interface, decrease grain boundary defects, and align the energy levels of the adjoining layers. ESP analysis revealed that the carboxylate group in D35 gives the dye the ability to coordinate or passivate uncoordinated Pb2+ cations, and thus delay non-radiative recombination. The presence of butoxy hydrophobic chains at the other end of the D35 molecule serves to improve the moisture stability of the perovskite films. The best PCE of 18.57% was obtained for PSCs containing an interlayer of D35. The ability of the D35-based solar cells to maintain 83% of their original efficiencies in the dark after 37 days of aging under open circuit (OC) conditions highlights their excellent stability.
The preparation of both perovskite films and hole-transfer layers in PSCs via an “all evaporation” method was reported by Dong and co-workers in 2020. In this respect, the sequential flash-evaporation of PbI2 and MAI films afforded homogeneous MAPbI3 films with large surface areas, accomplished via a “solid–solid” reaction during the post-annealing process. Furthermore, the vapor-deposition of a layer of a composite material containing the small organic molecules 2T-NATA and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) to aid in hole mobility afforded remarkable improvements in the performance and stability of the fabricated PSCs. In this respect, an inverted p–i–n planar PSC device containing a hybrid HTM (h-HTM) exhibited a PCE of 19.23%, versus 14.79% for its PEDOT:PSS counterpart. This increase is attributed to the improved conductivity of the HTM and more efficient hole extraction. Furthermore, using this fabrication approach, PCEs of 15.06% and 13.15% were obtained for rigid and flexible perovskite solar modules, respectively, with an active area of 16.0 cm2.
A facile CuI catalytic reaction has been employed for the synthesis of a TPA-N-phenyl-4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline (TPA-AZO) HTM for n–i–p mesoscopic PSC applications, to replace the expensive spiro-OMeTAD. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies of this system together with DFT calculations demonstrate that the HOMO of TPA-AZO is lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD, which makes it a better match to the perovskite light-absorbing conduction band. A PCE of 17.86% was obtained for TPA-AZO-based PSCs, which is close to the PCE of 19.07% recorded for spiro-OMeTAD. Despite its slightly lower PCE, TPA-AZO is much more cost-effective to prepare at $22.76 per g vs. $170–475 per g for spiro-OMeTAD.

In recent years, three simple benzene-arylamine HTMs were prepared, H-Di, H-Tri, and H-Tetra, by varying the number of terminal groups. The effects of modifying the terminal groups on the absorption spectra, electrochemical properties, hole mobility, film formation, and PV properties of the resulting PSCs were subsequently investigated. Such studies revealed that the performance of n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs was significantly improved using H-Tri, which has the lowest HOMO, and whose thin film has the best morphology when deposited on the perovskite layer. The better performance of the H-Tri-containing PSC devices is attributed to its higher electron–hole separation efficiency, resulting in reduced charge recombination, as confirmed by photoluminescence and impedance spectroscopy studies. After optimization, devices fabricated from H-Tri showed a promising PCE of 16.31% and were much less costly to prepare when compared to spiro-OMeTAD.

Low-cost HTMs based on chalcogenides that can efficiently compete with spiro-OMeTAD are also considered to be promising candidates for HTMs. Three novel star-shaped HTMs with C3 symmetry, comprising benzotrifuran, benzotripyrrole, and benzotriselenophene central cores containing three TPA arms, BTF-1, BTP-1, and BTSe-1, have been prepared and characterized for n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Studies revealed that their central scaffold with N, O, S, or Se heteroatoms has a marked influence on the electrochemical and photophysical characteristics, as well as on the PV performances of the resulting devices. When compared to their sulfur-rich counterpart, (the benzotrithiophene-based HTM) BTT-3, all three compounds showed good thermal stabilities >410 °C, suitable solubilities, electron-blocking capabilities, and appropriate film-forming abilities. All three HTMs have good HOMO levels and compatibilities with the perovskite valence band, which ensures effective hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. The molecular structures of BTF-1, BTT-3, and BTSe-1 were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction as their toluene solvates, which revealed that BTF-1 contains stronger molecular π–π contacts. It is noteworthy that the lack of π–π interactions in BTT-3 and BTSe-1 is due to the placement of solvent molecules between the conjugated cores of the neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice. Significant PCEs of up to 18.5% were obtained for optimized (FAPbI3)0.85 (MAPbBr3)0.15-containing PSCs, utilizing these tailor-made, chalcogenide-based HTMs, which are close to the values obtained for the standard spiro-OMeTAD. PCEs much lower than 15.5% with notable hysteresis were achieved for n–i–p mesoscopic (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-containing PSCs fabricated from BTP-1. The isomeric forms of benzotrithiophene (BTT) were used to design and synthesize two HTMs, BTT-4 and BTT-5 (Fig. 17b). The impacts of the various isomers on the electrochemical, optical, and photophysical properties, as well as the PV performances of the resultant n–i–p mesoscopic devices, were systematically studied. A cross-linking of the BTT cores with p-methoxy TPA was performed in four simple steps, affording BTT-4 and BTT-5. The most important feature of these compounds is that they are electron donors whose HOMO energy levels are aligned with the valence band of the perovskite to facilitate efficient hole injection. PSCs fabricated with BTT-4 and BTT-5 HTMs not only exhibit good thermal stabilities up to 430 °C but also have excellent PCEs of 19.0% and 18.2%, respectively, under standard measurement conditions. The highest conductivity for BTT-4 is consistent with the trend in the device properties. In this respect, the authors concluded that because the sulfur atoms are facing each other in the BTT-4 core in a cis arrangement, they are likely to benefit more from interacting with the perovskite layer, and therefore facilitate better hole extraction.
The linking of two stacked benzene rings via ethylene groups in close proximity affords the aromatic compound [2.2]PCP, which promotes charge transport via through space interaction between the benzene rings of the [2.2]PCP unit. In this respect, an HTM with a [2.2]PCP core and four TPA arms in pseudo-para and pseudo-ortho orientations, respectively, was employed for the fabrication of an n–i–p planar PSC. The compound was prepared via a much shorter synthetic route when compared to the standard spiro-OMeTAD. As part of this study, three D–π–D WS-HTMs, WS-1, WS-2, and WS-4, were studied. Values of 23.85 mA cm−2 for Jsc, 1.07 V for Voc, 0.75 for the FF, and 19.13% for the total PCE, when compared to 17.71% for spiro-OMeTAD, indicate a better performance for the solar cell containing WS-1 together with a conventional SnO2 ETL. Under the same conditions, the device containing WS-2 exhibited very similar values: a Jsc of 22.68 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.06 V, and a fill factor of 0.74, corresponding to a PCE of 17.79%. PSCs fabricated from pseudo-para-PCP HTMs WS-1 and WS-2 with spherical structures due to their good hole mobilities and good charge transfer efficiencies showed higher Jsc and FF values when compared to the device containing the pseudo-ortho-PCP HTM, WS-4. Furthermore, the PSC device containing WS-1 showed better durability after 240 h compared to spiro-OMeTAD. This study demonstrates the high performance of PSCs made from WS-1 as an HTM, which is a good candidate for the replacement of spiro-OMeTAD.
Four carbazole-TPA HTMs (3,6-Pyr, 3,6-Ben, 2,7-Pyr, and 2,7-Ben) with either pyridine or benzene substituents on the carbazole N were designed and developed for n–i–p mesoscopic PSC applications. The influence of their molecular structures on the photophysical, electrochemical, thermal, and PV properties of the resulting PSCs was analyzed. In this respect, it was noted that incorporation of pyridine into the molecular structures of the HTMs leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra, slightly lowers the energy of the HOMO, and confers higher thermal stability when compared to their benzene counterparts. Photoluminescence studies show that the pyridine-containing HTMs exhibit better hole extraction properties at the perovskite/HTM interface. Consequently, when employed in PSCs, the pyridine systems exhibited higher efficiencies and better stabilities than their benzene analogues. The 3,6-Pyr HTM exhibits the best PCE of 18.45% with good light-soaking, long-term stability, and lower cost than conventional spiro-OMeTAD.
Several novel HTMs with methylsulfonyl, N,N-dimethylamino and methoxy groups appended to the N of the carbazole unit of carbazole-arylamine, 3,6-S, 3,6-N, and 3,6-O, respectively, were synthesized for n–i–p mesoscopic PSC applications (Fig. 16b). The N,N-dimethylamino-based system shows a hypsochromically shifted absorption spectrum, higher thermal stability, and lower carrier mobility compared with the methylsulfonyl and methoxy counterparts. The authors found that although the N,N-dimethylamino derivative, 3,6-N, has less carrier mobility, it has a superior ability to extract holes, which improves the performance of the resulting PSC devices. PSCs containing primitive N,N-dimethylamino as the HTM had a PCE of 16.12%; doping with Li-TFSI and TBP resulted in an increase to 19%, which is close to the device performance of spiro-OMeTAD.
A novel star-shaped small-molecule HTM, LD29, containing a carbazole core and TPA side arms was recently employed for application in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Studies reveal that LD29 has a low-lying HOMO of −5.24 eV and is thus suitable for effective hole transfer in PSCs. Furthermore, it has a relatively high glass-transition temperature (121 °C) and high hole mobility (1.72 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), coupled with excellent thermal stability and film-forming capabilities. The use of dopant-free LD29 in PSCs afforded devices with a maximum PCE of 14.29%. After doping with TBP, FK209, and Li-TFSI, an increase in efficiency of up to 18.04% was observed, which is close to the values achieved for doped spiro-OMeTAD under similar conditions. The synthetic cost of LD29 is significantly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The most important outcome of this study is the small effect of changes in the concentration of LD29 on device performance, regardless of whether dopants are used or not. Devices fabricated from LD29 showed comparable stability to their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts.
In 2020, Roldán-Carmona and co-workers reported three novel HTMs, CS02, CS04, and CS05, containing a TPA moiety with dimethoxy phenyl substituents that were successfully applied in n–i–p mesoscopic triple-cation mixed-halide PSCs (Fig. 23b and c). The efficiencies of the resulting devices were comparable to those of spiro-OMeTAD, making them promising candidates for readily available, low-cost PSCs. There is an alignment of the energy levels of these HTMs with the mixed perovskite-triple cation halide, and they have similar hole mobility values to spiro-OMeTAD. Superior PCEs of 19.4% and 18.0% were obtained for CS05 and CS04 respectively. The authors demonstrated that controlling the efficiency of a solar cell is possible by minimizing the recombination kinetics of the carrier by rationally adjusting the structure of the HTMs. For example, a negative effect was observed on both solar cell efficiency and carrier recombination for CS02, versusCS04 and CS05. This was attributed to the formation of a weaker film for CS02, whereas insertion of a carbazole unit in CS05 results in significantly reduced carrier losses, increasing the overall efficiency of the solar cell. This work serves to highlight that the rational design of HTMs is essential to match or surpass the efficiency of benchmark HTMs such as spiro-OMeTAD and poly-TPA, most currently employed in the field of PSCs.
The novel, organic small molecule-based acridine-based HTM 4,4′-(10-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydro-acridine-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline), ACR-TPA, was successfully prepared via a straightforward synthetic route involving inexpensive chemicals and subsequently utilized for the fabrication of high-efficiency n–i–p planar PSCs (Fig. 19d). The hole mobility for the ACR-TPA thin film with Li-TFSI and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP) additives was 3.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the mobility of 2.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 recorded for the standard spiro-MeOTAD. The film also afforded a HOMO level of −5.03 eV, which is lower than its spiro-MeOTAD counterpart (−4.97 eV). Different thicknesses of ACR-TPA layers were used for the fabrication of MAPbI3 PSCs. In this respect, increasing the thickness of ACR-TPA increased the PCE owing to the enhanced resistance to recombination and more rapid charge separation. A similar device configuration using a thin film of ACR-TPA with a thickness of ca. 250 nm showed a higher PCE of 16.42% which is close to the PCE of 16.26% for the device based on spiro-MeOTAD.
The design and synthesis of two new low-cost HTMs, POZ9 and POZ10, with phenoxazine (POZ) cores, were reported for application in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Although the structural similarities of POZ9 and POZ10 confer similar energy levels to them, their PV performances are different due to differences in the N-substituent on the POZ ring. Studies reveal that the number of donor groups has a large effect on the characteristics of the HTMs. PSCs fabricated from POZ10 containing three N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino groups showed a higher PCE of 19.4%, without any hysteresis due to their efficient resistance to Shockley−Read−Hall (SRH) recombination during the working process. In contrast, PSCs comprising POZ9 had lower a PCE of 17.1%. The POZ10-based device showed better stability than its POZ9 counterpart, maintaining almost 93% of its initial performance after aging for 480 h. The costs of synthesizing POZ9 and POZ10 were calculated to be $121 per g and $126 per g, respectively, which are lower than that of the benchmark HTM spiro-OMeTAD, estimated to be around $200 per g. Moreover, the better hole transferability of POZ10 and charge recombination resistance were demonstrated through light intensity dependence studies.
With careful design strategies, phenothiazine-based HTMs are also inexpensive and potential options for PSCs. Two compounds with phenothiazine cores, PTZ1 and PTZ2, were synthesized via a relatively cheap, straightforward synthetic procedure involving Buchwald–Hartwig and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, respectively, to connect diarylamine or triarylamine donor units to the phenothiazine core for use in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. In this study, the two compounds were utilized as HTMs for the fabrication of solution-processed solar cells containing a lead trihalide perovskite. Studies revealed that the slight structural differences between the two compounds significantly affected their molecular geometries and optoelectronic properties. Furthermore, the presence of phenylene spacers had a considerable effect on the PV performance of the devices. A significant enhancement in the PCEs measured under AM1.5 of the sun from 2.1% for PTZ1 to 17.6% for PTZ2 was observed, where the latter value rivals that of spiro-OMeTAD (17.7%). Modulation of the electron density distribution that controls the stability of the molecules during the charge transfer dynamics at the perovskite/HTM interface was attributed to the significant differences in the PV performances of the two phenothiazine derivatives. Following this work, Wang et al. synthesized three new HTMs with phenothiazine cores and 4,4-dimethyl TPA (Z28), N-ethyl carbazole (Z29), and 4,4-dimethoxy TPA (Z30) side groups linked by double bonds. Adjustment of the hole mobility, energy levels, and thermal properties of the molecules was performed by chemically varying the peripheral groups. These compounds were successfully applied in n–i–p mesoscopic mixed cation/anion PSCs of the composition [(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]. The HTM Z30 had the best PCE of 19.17% under AM1.5G standard conditions. Furthermore, Z30-based devices showed better stabilities than those of Z28 and Z29 when aged without encapsulation, in an ambient environment for 1008 h at a humidity of approximately 40% in the dark, as well as after soaking in continuous sunlight for 600 h.
Recently, two novel phenothiazine-based organic HTMs, AZO-I and AZO-II, functionalized with triarylamine(s) through azomethine moieties were developed and prepared from inexpensive precursors by employing facile, cost-effective Schiff-base chemistry for use in n–i–p planar PSCs. Substantial enhancements in the PCEs of 12.6% and 14% were obtained for AZO-I and AZO-II, respectively. Furthermore, stabilities of 68 and 91% were retained after 2 months of storage for the two non-encapsulated devices under ambient conditions including a humidity of approximately 30%. The low costs of $9 and $12 per g estimated to prepare AZO-I and AZO-II, respectively, together with the facile catalyst-free synthetic route, make these materials promising candidates for the future development of low-cost, eco-friendly PSCs.
The use of phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (PDO) building blocks, as low-cost, efficient HTMs, opens up a new path for the future development of PSCs. In this respect, the preparation of two new HTMs with PDO cores, PDO1 and PDO2, has been reported. Studies of the HTMs show that the energy levels, electron density distributions, and charge carrier mobilities of the two compounds are significantly affected by the presence of a sulfuryl group in the core building block. Furthermore, the oxidation of sulfur to sulfuryl produces HTMs with significantly different molecular configurations and PV properties. The two PDO-based HTMs showed appropriate alignment of their HOMO energy levels, high hole mobilities, and conductivities, as well as efficient hole transfer. Within the PDO core unit, the more planar geometry and propensity to facilitate stronger π–π stacking interactions in the crystal packing are the most important factors that contribute to the best n–i–p planar PSCs. In this respect, an excellent PCE of 20.2% was recorded for devices containing PDO2 which also showed good stability in the dark under ambient conditions for 500 hours.

The design of bridging linkers in hexaaryl benzene-based compounds is particularly important and provides fundamental knowledge to further the optimization of HTMs for PSCs. In addition, one of the most important challenges in developing new HTMs for commercial applications is to use reduce the number of synthetic steps. To address this, Meng et al. successfully synthesized a “flower-like” small molecule HTM, hexakis[4-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)phenyl]benzene, F-1 (Fig. 26), which was subsequently fabricated into high-efficiency n–i–p planar PSCs. This compound comprises a benzene core containing six “bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino” hole-transport functional groups. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies reveal that F-1 has a low HOMO energy level of −5.31 eV. Notably, because it contains many hole-transport functional groups, it has a high hole mobility of 4.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which increases its Jsc and FF when compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Consequently, F-1-containing PSCs showed a significantly higher performance of 17.73%, when compared to their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts. In addition, studies also revealed that F-1 devices maintained over 60% of their initial efficiency, without any encapsulation after exposure to air for 8 days, highlighting their improved stabilities.

Two low-cost hexa-substituted benzene derivatives containing six dimethoxydiphenylamine units linked by fluorenyl or phenyl bridges attached to the central benzene core, namely HFB-OMeDPA and HPB-OMeDPA (Fig. 26), were successfully synthesized and subsequently utilized as efficient HTMs for high-performance n–i–p planar PSCs. These compounds are highly soluble due to the presence of the hydrotropydimethoxydiphenylamine substituents and additional flexible alkyl chains. The relationship between the molecular structure and electronic properties of these semiconductors and their effect on their PV performances were investigated. Due to their different bridging linkers, the two compounds exhibited different photophysical, electrochemical, thermal, and hole transport properties. Both compounds presented high hole mobility, good solubility, superior thermal stabilities, and suitable energy levels. Planar PSCs employing these two HTMs exhibited PCEs of 15.9 and 16.7% for HFB-OMeDPA and HPB-OMeDPA, respectively, which are close to the PCE of 16% obtained for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD-based cells, under AM1.5G illumination conditions.
Two new propeller-shaped organic HTMs have been realized by attaching six triarylamine groups to a hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) core, HPB-OMe, or a hexakis(2-thienyl)benzene (HTB) core, HTB-OMe (Fig. 26 and 27a). Fig. 28 shows the morphology of the HTB-OMe film of an n–i–p planar PSC device with an ITO/ETL/MAPbI3/HTB-OMe/Au configuration. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image reveals the thickness of the different layers, which for the PVSK layer is about 610 nm, which is uniformly covered by an HTB-OMe layer that is ∼60 nm. The SnO2 ETL is about ∼30 nm thick and the Au electrode is ∼80 nm. PCEs above 12.9% and 17.3% were obtained for solid-state planar perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells comprising HPB-OMe and HTB-OMe, respectively, in forward scans, without doping, under AM1.5G illumination conditions. Hole mobility and interfacial charge transfer are higher for the HTB-OMe-based PSCs than for their HPB-OMe counterparts, due to the presence of multi-thiophene units that afford a better PV conversion. A comparison of the two HTMs in terms of their energy level compatibilities, hole transfer capabilities, PCEs, and recombination abilities has paved the way for the development of new families of multi-triarylamine and thiophene-rich molecules for applications as efficient dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.
In 2020 Xu and co-workers designed and prepared a bipolar-transport starburst molecule. This compound contains a calix[4]resorcinarene (CRA)-TPA core, a TPA hole transport unit together with triazole electron transport groups (triazole) (Fig. 26) that was subsequently employed as an additive in an n–i–p planar perovskite, where it functions as an adjustment buffer for charge transport (Fig. 29). In this respect, the CRA-TPA molecule participates in the crystallization of the triple-cationic perovskite, and the functional hole and electron transport groups interact with the ionic defects in the perovskite. The defect density (Ndefects) of a perovskite film doped with CRA-TPA reached 4.20 × 1015 cm−3, when compared to the control film (Ndefects = 1.43 × 1016 cm−3), which represents a reduction factor of ≈1/4 that significantly benefits the overall stability of the device. Notably, the PCE of 18.5% measured for the control device was increased to 20.0% by introducing an optimal amount of CRA-TPA.

The PV data of star-shaped compounds with tetra-arm (X-shaped) structures containing TPA units are summarized in Table 3. The most important role of these organic hole transport layers (HTLs) is to achieve highly efficient, cost-effective inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. With these goals in mind, two low-cost, X-shaped organic HTLs, SiTP-OMeTPA, and Si-OMeTPA, with silicon cores and TPA branches were designed, prepared, and subsequently employed in planar p–i–n PSCs (Fig. 30, 31). This molecular design strategy substantially simplified the synthetic procedure, thus reducing the overall fabrication cost of the devices. In this respect, Si-OMeTPA was synthesized in a straightforward manner in two steps in overall yields >60%, from commercially available compounds. The compounds have high thermal stabilities, high crystallinity, and appropriate energy levels to transfer holes with a long-range ordered lamellar structure, and superior hole mobilities. The facile successive growth of high-quality perovskite films is the most important feature of these HTLs since it results in fewer trapping modes when compared to the polycrystalline perovskite films, as well as an improved ability to extract holes and align the bands at the interface. The subsequent use of doped/annealed Si-OMeTPA as the HTL and C60/BCP as the dual cathode buffer layers in p–i–n Pero-SCs led to a remarkable enhancement in the PV performance, where the best PCE of 19% was obtained, which is one of the highest reported for p–i–n PSCs. Additionally, the low hysteresis and good reproducibility and stability of these devices are also important advantages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported HTL material that shows superior performance when compared to the standard HTL, PTAA. Since it can be easily synthesized, it is very promising for future applications for the fabrication of planar p–i–n PSCs.

Two novel HTMs containing a tetraphenylmethane core and bulky arylamine terminal lateral groups, DPA-TPM and TPA-TPM, together with the reference Ph-TPM comprising anisol terminal groups were reported for use in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. These compounds were prepared via the facile synthetic procedure shown in Fig. 27b. Amongst these compounds, the most important features of TPA are its improved solubility in organic solvents, suitable film-forming ability, high hole mobility, high thermal stability, high water contact angle, and suitable bond alignments with CH3NH3PbI3. Due to these advantages, the resulting TPA PSCs exhibited superior PCEs and better long-term stabilities, when compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, photoluminescence and impedance spectroscopy studies indicate that TPA-TPM has comparable hole extraction capabilities when compared to spiro-OMeTAD. The facile synthesis of this family of compounds from cheap starting materials demonstrates that tetraphenylmethane-arylamines offer promise as HTMs for the fabrication of efficient, stable PSCs. Furthermore, modification of the tetraphenylmethane core by strategically modifying the functional groups provides a good strategy to optimize the properties of the resulting PSC devices.
Three new organic TPA-based HTMs, D101, D102, and D103, were synthesized from commercially available, low-cost starting reagents via a one-step Corey–Fuchs reaction for application in n–i–p planar PSCs (Fig. 27c). All three compounds have a benzene–π–TPA configuration with suitable energy levels. Extensive studies on these systems show that they have higher PCEs than spiro-OMeTAD, under similar conditions due to their faster charge transport and lower recombination losses. Among the three compounds, D101 shows the fastest charge transport and has the highest hole mobility. EIS studies reveal that D101 and D102 are the most effective in preventing charge recombination. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements supported by theoretical calculations indicate that the structure of D101 is more planar when compared to D102 and D103 where the double bonds are in the m- and o-positions, respectively. The thermal stability of these HTMs within the perovskite layer was determined from Tg and DSC studies. High PCEs of 18.47%, 17.33%, and 14.36% were obtained for D101–D103 respectively. The reproducibility of all three devices was confirmed by PCE distribution diagrams. Significant suppression of hysteresis for PSCs containing these new HTMs was obtained by analyzing cells under both reverse and forward bias conditions. The PV performances of devices fabricated from D101 and D102 are directly comparable to cells made from benchmark spiro-OMeTAD (17.20%).
The molecular engineering of tetraphenyl butadiene derivatives as HTMs for high-performance PSC optoelectronic devices is currently in progress. Following this strategy, two three-dimensional symmetric tetraphenyl butadiene derivatives, CJ-03 and CJ-04 containing diphenylamine or TPA substituents, were synthesized and studied as HTMs in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. The unique molecular configuration of these HTMs offers several advantages that include: (i) an increased conjugation and thus delocalization of the intramolecular charge due to the planarity of their tetraphenyl butadiene cores which is beneficial for charge transfer; (ii) a favorable three-dimensional charge transport system via the employment of a twisted “four-blade screw-like” configuration, which confers a good ability to transfer holes and useful features for charge transport that include abundant hydrogen bonds; (iii) a significant number of hole-hopping sites and short N–N distances; and (iv) good solubilities in organic solvents that facilitate the formation of weak intermolecular interactions and support the formation of high-quality films. The two HTMs were prepared via a straightforward synthetic strategy. The estimated cost of preparing CJ-03 is ∼USD34.43 per g, which is only 23.1% of the cost of preparing the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD from commercial sources. A PCE of 13.75% was obtained for the PSC containing CJ-04, while a much higher PCE of 20.06% was determined for the CJ-03 devices, which have a Jsc of 22.89 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.111 V, and a FF of 78.9%, and is superior to the PCE of 18.90% obtained for spiro-OMeTAD-based cells.
The concept of molecular doping enables controllable tailoring of the band structure of perovskite-based materials that can substantially improve the performances of the resulting optoelectronic devices. In this respect, the symmetrical donor–acceptor system 4,4′,4″,4″′-(pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (PT-TPA), containing a paradiazine electron-deficient core and electron-donating methoxy TPA peripheral groups, was reported and applied in n–i–p planar PSCs, which were effectively p-doped onto the surfaces of FAxMA1−xPbI3 (FA: HC(NH2)2; MA: CH3NH3) perovskite films. Due to the intermolecular charge transfer properties of PT-TPA, the acceptance of electrons from the perovskite layer occurs via the formation of a stabilized resonance structure. A significant increase in perovskite dark conductivity and carrier concentration is achieved because of this doping effect. Computational studies revealed that the transfer of electrons from the first two layers of the octahedral cages of the perovskites to PT-TPA takes place. Furthermore, use of PT-TPA in PSCs facilitates the extraction of holes into the hole transport layer effectively, due to the doped induction band bending in the perovskite that reduces charge recombination by expelling electrons towards the cathode. The increase in photovoltage from 1.12 to 1.17 V and values of 23.4% for the efficiency of the photocurrent scan and 22.9% for the stabilized efficiency were recorded for the optimized devices. This study demonstrates the control of interfacial charge recombination using molecular doping in PSCs, which is complementary to extensive defect passivation techniques.
Two new classes of star-shaped HTMs containing fused tetrathienoanthracene (TTA1–3) and non-fused tetrathienylbenzene cores (TTB1–3) were recently designed, synthesized, and characterized in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs (Fig. 27d). Both series of compounds contain four-terminal 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine substituents that are connected either directly to the core (TTA1 and TTB1), or connected through phenyl (TTA2 and TTB2) and thiophene-phenyl (TTA3 and TTB3) linkers. The hole extraction from the perovskite layer of the device is achieved due to the good compatibility of the HOMO energy levels of the new HTMs with the mixed-perovskite VB, which in this respect is comparable to spiro-OMeTAD. The new HTMs were examined in triple-cation (Cs+, FA+, and MA+) dual-halide (Br− and I−) mixed perovskite (Cs0.1FA0.74MA0.13PbI2.48Br0.39) solar cells. PSCs containing non-fused TTBn HTMs showed very poor performances when compared to their fused TTAn counterparts (Fig. 32). In this respect, the π–π stacking of the planar compounds with aromatic TTA cores expands the π-conjugation, resulting in superior hole-transport properties and increased intermolecular interactions. Remarkably, TTA3 with phenyl-thiophene linkers and (4,4′-dimethoxy)diphenylamine moieties achieved the highest PCE of 18.8%, in mixed PSCs, which is close to the efficiency achieved for the reference spiro-OMeTAD PSC under 1 sun irradiation. This study highlights that TTA3 is a promising replacement for spiro-OMeTAD in light of its facile synthesis, low cost, thermal stability, and high efficiency in mixed-perovskite devices.
An excellent approach for the design of highly efficient HTMs has been to employ fused oligothiophene-based π-conjugated systems to facilitate intermolecular assembly via π–π and S⋯S interactions. Adopting this strategy, Molina-Ontoria et al. synthesized and characterized two novel small-molecule HTMs, TTPA–DBQT and TTPA–DBST, for PSCs (Fig. 17c). These compounds contain 2-D dibenzoquinquethiophene (DBQT) or dibenzosexithiophene (DBST) cores together with four tetrakis TPA (TTPA) arms. The Tg values for both HTMs are above 100 °C, confirming that these compounds have high thermal stabilities. Their similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels lead to good alignment with the edge of the perovskite valence band. By evaluating both HTMs in n–i–p mesoporous devices, significant efficiencies of 18.1% for TTPA-DBQT and 14.27% for TTPA-DBST were obtained, versus 17.96% for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD. TTPA-DBQT, therefore, exhibits the highest performance without hysteresis, as well as better solubility and conductivity which is an order of magnitude higher than its DBST counterpart. The device performance is significantly influenced by the solubility of the HTM; in this case, poorer solubility results in a less efficient coating of the perovskite surface that results in the formation of pinholes. The formation of high-quality homogeneous films for TTPA-DBQT was established by SEM. Although the more planar π-scaffold of TTPA-DBST improves its hole extraction properties, it has a lower FF due to the formation of thinner TTPA-DBST films with pinholes.
Along similar lines, aromatic central benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienopyrrole (DTP) cores, with four appended triaryl amine substituents, TTPA-BDT and TTPA-DTP, were reported by Ortí and co-workers in 2018. Their performance as efficient HTMs in n–i–p mesoscopic PSC devices were subsequently investigated. Rapid quenching of the fluorescence emission by PL experiments demonstrates the ability of both compounds to effectively collect π-scaffold holes created in the perovskite active layer. Mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (MA: CH3NH3+, FA: NH=CHNH3+) based devices under 1 sun illumination were used for the PV studies. The results showed that an increase in PCE from 15.6% to 18.1% could be achieved by replacing the central pyrrole ring in the DTP with a benzene ring in BDT. Notably, this is higher than the PCE of 17.7% obtained for the spiro-OMeTAD device measured under the same conditions. Despite having a slightly lower conductivity than spiro-OMeTAD, TTPA-BDT surpasses in terms of its performance since its HOMO (−5.36 eV) is more efficiently aligned with the valence band of the perovskite (−5.65 eV), together with its remarkably lower reorganization energy (λ) of 0.101 eV (versus 0.139 V computed for spiro-OMeTAD). Furthermore, TTPA-BDT films between 50 and 100 nm can be prepared, which are significantly thinner than those obtained from spiro-OMeTAD, which helps increase the FF and improve the device performance. DFT calculations helped gain a more comprehensive understanding of the structural, electrochemical, and optical properties of these derivatives. In this respect, although TTPA-DTP is the more efficient electron donor, it has higher reorganizational energy (0.285 eV), which leads to lower conductivity. Thus, fixing triaryl amine-based HTMs onto an aromatic BDT core is beneficial for the development of efficient HTMs.
A new HTM containing an anthradithiophene (ADT) central core and four TPA branches with methoxy substituents, BTPA-7, was prepared in only 3 steps, which significantly reduces its cost. Studies reveal that although it has a lower conductivity than the spiro-OMeTAD reference, it shows higher hole mobility and a higher Tg attributed to the conjugation of the anthradithiophene core. The n–i–p planar perovskite FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 devices containing BTPA-7 and spiro-OMeTAD showed PCE values of 17.58% and 18.88% respectively. For PSC MAPbI3 devices containing BTPA-7 and spiro-OMeTAD, the PCEs were lower at 11.90% and 13.25% respectively. In both devices the PV performances were lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD; however, PSCs fabricated from BTPA-7 had a higher Jsc due to their higher hole mobility and improved long-term stability when compared to their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the HTM. These results indicate that anthradithiophene-based HTMs are promising candidates for the replacement of spiro-OMeTAD to increase the stabilities of the HTMs in next-generation PSCs.
The 2-D π-conjugated and star-shaped molecule 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[5-(N,N-di(p-methoxyphenyl)amino-p-phenyl)-thiophen-2-yl]pyrene, OMe-TATPyr, was synthesized and subsequently employed as a highly-efficient HTM in n–i–p planar PSCs. OMe-TATPyr contains a pyrene core and four triarylamine arms connected via a phenyl–thiophene bridge. It can be easily produced in gram quantities with a laboratory cost of about US$50 per g, via a short synthetic procedure. The molecular structure facilitates effective delocalization of charge and intermolecular stacking, which leads to increased mobility of the hole carrier. Detailed studies of this system by electrochemical impedance analysis, photoluminescence, and depth-profiling XPS indicate possible trap passivation through Pb–S interactions, for which the incorporation of phenyl-thiophene units is useful. As a result, cationic PSCs mixed with OMe-TATPyr with an area of 0.09 cm2 showed an impressive PCE of ∼20% with good stability, while devices with larger areas of 1.08 cm2 fabricated from OMe-TATPyr had a slightly lower PCE of 17.3%. OMe-TATPyr with its superior performance and facile, cost-effective synthesis can therefore be considered a promising new HTM for the replacement of spiro-OMeTAD, and a useful component for the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs on an industrial scale.
The novel sulfur-rich two-dimensional small organic molecule 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[5-(N,N-di(p-(methylthio)phenyl)amino-p-phenyl)-thiophen-2-yl]pyrene, SMe-TATPyr, was designed and prepared as a functional layer to effectively passivate perovskite surface defects and simplify hole transfer at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. It has a perfectly matched energy level alignment with the perovskite layer (Fig. 19e) and the presence of sulfur atoms affords adequate Pb–S interactions with the perovskite to facilitate efficient interfacial defect passivation. Consequently, the PCE of n–i–p planar devices containing SMe-TATPyr was enhanced from 20.4% to 22.3%. In addition to increasing the stability of the PSCs without encapsulation, these devices also maintained 95% of their original efficiency under ambient conditions after 1500 hours of storage vs. just 70% for devices without this functional layer studied under the same conditions.
A fused tetraphenylethylene is also a promising unit for the development of novel HTMs for PSCs with high efficiency and stability. In this respect, n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs have been fabricated from the fused tetraphenylethylene derivative F-TPE, which has a lower HOMO level and higher hole mobility than its non-fused counterparts. Studies reveal that these PSCs perform better than benchmark spiro-OMeTAD, also showing better PV properties in the absence of dopants. A promising PCE of 18.30% was obtained using the best device based on doped F-TPE, which is higher than the PCE of 15.84% obtained for doped TPE. The increased hydrophobic nature of the fused HTM improves the stability of the resulting device when compared to its unfused TPE counterpart, affording similar properties to the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD.
A new “lucky clover” HTM, BTPA-8, containing four dimethoxy TPA branches and an anthracene-based central core, was prepared and characterized by Zhang et al. and successfully employed in n–i–p planar PSCs. Good alignment between the HOMO of BTPA-8 and the bands of the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) or FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 (FA = HC(NH2)2) perovskites afforded PSCs with Tgs similar to spiro-OMeTAD, high hole mobilities, and good thermal stabilities. Consequently, the employment of BTPA-8 in both MAPbI3 and FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 PSCs resulted in similar device performances to spiro-OMeTAD. In this respect, the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device containing BTPA-8 had a PCE of 17.99% in reverse scan mode, with an aperture of 0.09 cm2, compared to the PCE of 18.92% for its spiro-OMeTAD counterpart. The MAPbI3 device containing BTPA-8 had a lower PCE of 12.31%, which was close to the PCE of 13.25% obtained for spiro-OMeTAD with an aperture area of more than 1 cm2. In contrast to their similar PCEs, devices made from the more hydrophobic BTPA-8 had better environmental stabilities than those from spiro-OMeTAD, which together with their lower synthetic costs makes them promising HTMs for PSCs.
A cyclooctatetrathiophene family of HTMs was also developed as potential candidates to replace spiro-OMeTAD for the discovery of highly efficient n–i–p planar PSCs. In this respect, two HTMs containing a rigid 3D cyclooctatetrathiophene, COTT-1 and COTT-2, were prepared, and their photophysical, thermal, and electrochemical characteristics were systematically studied by both experimental and computational methods. Both HTMs displayed high thermal and electrochemical stabilities. The lower performance of the COTT-1 PSCs is attributed to COTT-1's poor solubility since its molecular structure is end-capped with four TPA groups. In contrast, the eight methoxy groups in the molecular structure of COTT-2 improved its solubility and afforded higher frontier orbital energy levels. The PCEs for PSCs containing COTT-1 and COTT-2 were 8.4% and 17.7%, respectively, under AM1.5G conditions, which in the case of the latter is close to the value of 18.2% achieved for devices containing spiro-OMeTAD, measured under the same conditions. In addition, deactivating the perovskite film using a very thin interfacial layer of COTT-1 and COTT-2 as the HTM increased the PCE to 19.2%. The stability of the COTT-1/COTT-2 device was much better than its spiro-OMeTAD counterpart studied under similar conditions. Furthermore, this device maintained 87% of its original PCE for 7 days after storage under high humidity.
A novel saddle-like, flexible, π-conjugated cyclooctatetrathiophene (CoTh) HTM containing four fused thiophene rings appended to four p-methoxy TPA units, CoTh-TTPA, was recently prepared and studied for application in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Direct conjugation between the electron-donating p-methoxy TPA groups and a central CoTh framework, functioning as a weak acceptor, afforded a novel bright red colored HTM, attributed to the presence of a charge transfer band. The higher Tg recorded for PSCs containing CoTh-TTPA, when compared to their conventional spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, is consistent with their more stabilized HOMO energy level. This allows the holes to be extracted more effectively at the perovskite/HTM interface. Decomposition of CoTh-TTPA above 400 °C again indicates good thermal stability. Studies reveal that the photogenerated charge carrier quenches more efficiently at the interface between spiro-OMeTAD and the perovskite when compared to the CoTh-TTPA/perovskite interface. In addition, the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD-based thin-film transistors is about an order of magnitude higher when compared to the CoTh-TTPA-based device. CoTh-TTPA was combined with a mixed perovskite ([FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15) and a more advanced triple cation perovskite ([(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08) and applied as HTMs. Under the same conditions, significant PCEs of 16.3 and 15.9% were obtained, which are slightly lower than the value obtained for standard spiro-OMeTAD. Detailed analyses of the photoluminescence and conductivity data revealed better hole extraction and conductivity for spiro-OMeTADvs.CoTh-TTPA. This lower performance of the new HTM is attributed to its higher reorganizational energy, lower conductivity, and poorer ability to extract holes.

The use of planar porphyrin cores due to their conjugated structures and intermolecular π–π stacking interactions affords HTMs with high hole mobilities and subsequently PSCs with high efficiencies. Following this strategy, two coordination complexes comprising zinc, Y3 and Y4 (Fig. 33), have been developed and employed as HTMs for n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. The structure of Y3 contains two separate ligands and a disconnected porphyrin. In contrast, connecting the two ligands in Y3 and the formation of a porphyrin core as a single ligand in Y4 result in a more planar, conjugated molecule. Both molecules quench the emission from the perovskite layer and show very similar optical and redox properties. Nevertheless, the hole mobility of Y4 is ∼2 times higher than that of Y3, and the conductivity of the macroscopic material prepared from Y4 is also significantly higher. In addition, the champion device when Y4 was used as an HTM in PSCs showed a PCE of 16%, which is quite close to the PCE of 17% observed for devices made from spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, a PCE of only 0.01% was observed for the PSCs fabricated from Y3. The difference in the crystal packing of the non-planar vs. planar components in the two compounds is attributed to their different device properties.

A 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino phenyl])-porphyrin was successfully prepared on a gram scale via the direct condensation of pyrrole and 4-[bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]benzaldehyde (Fig. 34a). Coordination to Cu(II) and Zn(II) afforded HTMs with superior electrochemical and thermal stabilities, high hole mobilities, and suitable energies for hole extraction. In this respect, both porphyrins were exploited for the fabrication of organometallic halide n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. The CuP complex (Fig. 33) has a PCE of 15.36%, a Voc of 1.072 V, a Jsc of 21.60 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.3%. The best PCE of 17.78% was obtained for the ZnP complex (Fig. 33), which has a Voc of 1.099 V, a Jsc of 22.68 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.3%. Notably, the ZnP PSCs are reported to have better stabilities than their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts and are prepared via a less costly, more facile methodology. Along similar lines, in 2018, Yoon et al. developed two Zn porphyrin (PZn)-based small-molecule HTLs, PZn-2FTPA and PZn-3FTPA (Fig. 33), by conjugating fluorinated TPA (FTPA) units to a PZn core for application in n–i–p planar low-temperature perovskite solar cells (L-PSCs). The introduction of fluorine substituents into the molecular structure of the PZn-HTL enhances the charge injection/transfer of the resulting devices by better matching the HOMO levels and improving the hole mobility. In this respect, the shorter distance of the F substituent to the PZn core in PZn-2FTPA results in a large decrease in the HOMO level and therefore a subsequent increase in the hole mobility. L-PSCs made from PZn-2FTPA have very high PCEs of 18.85% vs. 16.37% obtained for non-fluorinated devices fabricated from PZn-TPA (Fig. 33) in the presence of dopant. The cost-effective synthetic route to PZn-2FTPA and its excellent PV performance make it a promising HTL for the development of dopant free PSCs, which rival those fabricated from the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD.
In nature, the long-term exposure of plants to UV radiation without damage is due to the existence of organic compounds that play the role of sunscreens. Interestingly, an ester derivative of sinapic acid, sinapoyl malate, was employed as a natural plant sunscreen (Fig. 34b), to modify the surfaces of ETMs as the interlayer of an ETM/perovskite interface together with porphyrin HTMs with a Co(II)/(III) redox couple (Fig. 35). The reduction of weak interfacial contacts between the ETM and the perovskite afforded n–i–p planar PSCs with efficiencies of up to 19.6%. Since the diffusion of I− and CH3NH3+ (MA+) ions from the perovskite to the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD causes thermal degradation of the resulting PSCs above 80 °C, Co(II)/Co(III) porphyrins (Fig. 33) were employed as more thermally robust alternative HTMs. Following this strategy, stable porphyrin-based PSCs with a superior efficiency of 20.5% have been successfully constructed.
In addition to porphyrins, phthalocyanines have also been explored as HTMs for PSC devices. In this respect, solution-processable tetra-4-(bis(4-tert-butyl)phenyl)amino)phenoxy substituted copper phthalocyanine, CuPc-OTPAtBu (Fig. 32), was synthesized and explored as an HTM in mixed-ion perovskite light absorber based-n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs, containing a cost-effective vacuum-free carbon cathode. A PCE of 15.0%, a Voc of 1.01, a Jsc of 21.9, and a FF of 0.68 were obtained for optimized devices under AM 1.5G illumination that were doped with 6% (w/w) tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ). EIS studies showed that the incorporation of the CuPc-OTPAtBu HTM layer effectively alleviated the energy barriers between the perovskite and carbon cathode, facilitated hole transportation/collection, and thus prevented the charge recombination at the interface. It is noteworthy that the presence of the hydrophobic HTM interlayer also prevented moisture penetration into the perovskite film, affording PSC devices with very good long-term durability for 720 hours, under ambient conditions.

The PV data for PSCs assembled from polymer structures containing TPA units are summarized in Table 4.

The facile addition condensation of arylamines and paraldehyde allows for the molecular design of arylamine polymers with tuneable energy levels and thin-film properties. In this respect, the linear arylamine polymers MPA and MTA were designed and prepared via the one-step condensation of N,N′-diphenyl-N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)-1,4-phenylenediamine and 4-methoxy TPA with paraldehyde. Paraldehyde was selected for the addition condensation because of its high reactivity, and the formation of an ethylidene linker, which afforded amorphous, soluble polymers. The resulting non-conjugated arylamine polymer structure was characterized and found to comprise homogeneous, amorphous layers with a Tg of >200 °C, which can be deposited onto a substrate by a simple spin-coating process. The polymer has excellent solubility in conventional organic solvents. Phenylenediamine or electron-donating methoxy substituents were introduced to tune the HOMO level and the hole mobility of the resulting polymer. The polymer layers exhibited hole mobilities on the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and HOMO levels of −5.38 eV, rendering them suitable for applications as hole-transport layers of PSCs. The n–i–p mesoscopic perovskite cells fabricated with MPA afforded a PCE of 16.0%. The cells exhibited both high PV conversion efficiencies and high thermal durability, revealing that MPA is a promising HTM for the fabrication of solar cells.

PTAA has also been investigated as an HTM for application in inverted p–i–n solar cells with a planar structure. This was achieved with PTAA, using a sequential doping method, without the need for any complex surface passivation methods. Compared to the usual PEDOT:PSS, PTAA enhances the quasi-Fermi separation of the electron–hole pair to significantly improve the Voc. The PTAA was subsequently doped with F4-TCNQ in an orthogonal solvent base using the sequential method, which provides a facile, stable route to regulate the doping level. Improvement in the quality of the perovskite film was achieved using the modified inter-diffusion method. Grains larger than 2 µm and about 450 nm thick were obtained for high-quality perovskite crystals. The highest PCE of 15.3% was obtained under AM1.5 irradiation. The authors postulated that the most important reason for the low Voc of this system is the interface traps between the PTAA and the perovskite layers. Further improvement in the performance of the resulting solar cells could be achieved by optimizing this system.
More recently, a novel HTM consisting of a methoxy substituted PTAA (CH3O-PTAA) was developed and prepared for the advancement of efficient, thermally stable PSCs. Compared to conventional CH3-PTAA, the CH3O-PTAA HTM exhibited a higher doping ability and conductance, due to its higher HOMO energy level, more favorable interaction with the Li dopant, and higher resonance stabilization ability. For n–i–p mesoscopic PSC devices containing CH3O-PTAA and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, high PCEs of over 20% were obtained. Moreover, a reduction of only 3% of the initial PCE was observed for encapsulated PSCs with CH3O-PTAA under dark storage conditions (ISOS-D-3), after more than 1000 hours at a temperature of 85 °C and a relative humidity of 85% (RH). The new HTM, therefore, has much better long-term thermal stability when compared to the reference PSCs comprising CH3-PTAA.
The π-conjugated small molecule NPB (N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine) doped into PTAA (poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine)) was investigated as an efficient HTL for inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Improved perovskite crystal growth was achieved through doping with NPB since it forms strong π–π interactions with PTAA and cation–π interactions with CH3NH3+ (MA+). Furthermore, the increased PTAA hydrophilicity helps in regulating the crystallization process of the perovskite, affording larger grain sizes and better crystallinity. The doping also adjusts the HOMO energy level of the HTL for better alignment with the perovskite valence band. Consequently, devices fabricated from NPB doped PTAA have more efficient hole extraction and higher carrier transport performances, with a PCE of 20.15% and a Jsc of 22.60 mA cm−2 together with an enhanced Voc of 1.14 V and FF of 0.7843, and significantly improved stabilities when compared to pristine PTAA.
A new doping strategy in perovskite PVs for the fabrication of PSCs with high efficiency and stabilities was studied by Jia et al. In this respect, effective doping of PTAA with the hydrophobic Lewis acid LAD was achieved, using the new infiltrated diffusion doping (INDD) method as an alternative processing method for n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. The improvement of hole extraction and the reduction of charge recombination were attributed to the formation of a Lewis acid–base adduct within the HTL, which was obtained via charge transfer during the doping reaction by dropping soluble LAD onto the PTAA to facilitate its infiltration into the PTAA layer (Fig. 36). The LAD plays a key role in the effective passivity of the Pb–I anionic antisite defects in the hole–conductor heterojunction of the p-type perovskite and subsequently leads to a decrease in the density of trap states, as shown by DFT calculations. Consequently, a champion PCE of 20.32% was obtained for an optimized PSC comprising LAD doped PTAA by INDD processing, which is the highest PCE for any single dopant PTAA reported to date. At the same time, the device maintained 93% of its maximum PCE value (18.90%) without encapsulation for 1500 hours after exposure to air, confirming that it has superior long-term stability, which is attributed to the hydrophobicity of the LAD and the micron-sized perovskite grains.
In recent years, a new fluorinated hydrophobic Lewis acid dopant (LAD) was developed for PTAA to obtain highly efficient, stable n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs without any hysteresis. The resulting PTAA-LAD adduct, prepared via the combination of doped PTAA with the Lewis acidic LAD, significantly improves hole extraction and reduces charge recombination by decreasing the energy of the HOMO and thus increasing the hole mobility. Because of these excellent features, devices containing LAD doped PTAA had a PCE of 19.01%, which is the highest ever reported for PSCs containing new dopants, together with an exceptional FF of 0.81. The improved performance of this new dopant for developing HTLs versus standard Li-TFSI/t-BP bi-dopants is revealed in studies of the resulting PSCs. In this respect, LAD-doped PTAA shows lower J–V hysteresis and superior long-term stability of up to 70 days when non-encapsulated. Studies also reveal that the non-external migration of the Li+ ions and trap conditions at the perovskite surface that is passivated by the LAD reduce hysteresis. High hydrophobicity, uniformity of the HTL layer without aggregation and crystallization, and the absence of any hydrophilic and harmful dopants are the most important factors contributing to the excellent environmental stabilities of this family of LAD-based PSCs.
The development of p-type organic semiconductors with hole transfer properties via efficient, facile synthetic methods and the possibility of extending their applications to other photoelectric fields are important challenges at the forefront of the field of PVs. The improved conductivity of poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) by employing the Lewis acid tris-(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) as a p-type dopant, using the light soaking (LS) method, was reported by Ye et al. in 2019. In this respect, a two-fold increase in the conductivity of PTAA films was obtained, attributed to the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) between PTAA and BCF. An improvement in the efficiency of PSCs from 13.60 to 15.49% was reported after doping and the LS treatment. Using LS-PTAA films with 8 wt% BCF for 5 minutes in inverted PSCs with a p–i–n planar heterojunction HTL, a PCE value of 17.12% was obtained for a Jsc of 20.73 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.04 V and a FF of 79.40%.
The passivity of a prefabricated perovskite film was developed using pseudohalide-induced film retreatment technology. In this study, the evolution of a controlled decomposition-to-recrystallization of the perovskite film could be achieved through a retreatment process. The most important advantages of this strategy are that it enlarges the grain size of the film in all crystallographic directions, improving the crystallization and preventing trap density. The lack of change in the orientation of the crystal and the absence of impurities in the modified NH4SCN films are attributed to an intermediate pseudohalide catalytic effect. A champion inverted p–i–n planar heterojunction pseudohalide device with a PCE of 19.44% was obtained. The authors also found that flexible devices with the best PCE of 17.04% could be realized and concluded that this facile, low-temperature film retreatment procedure could be very useful for the future development of flexible PSCs.
Achieving high PV performance by reducing ELoss and improving device stability under ambient conditions for the realization of next-generation PSC devices could be possible by adopting an interfacial engineering strategy. In 2020 Yang et al. adopted this strategy using an interfacial thin layer of TPA:polystyrene (PS) coated onto a hybrid perovskite layer. The key role of the TPA Lewis base was to decrease non-radiative recombination and reduce ELoss through Lewis acid–base interactions, which inactivate defects in the film. In this respect, Lewis acid–base interactions between the aromatic electron-donor polystyrene core in the PS and tertiary amines of the TPA result in passive surface defects in the hybrid perovskites. Thus, by reducing the energy loss from 0.49 eV to 0.35 eV, it was possible to achieve inverted p–i–n planar PSCs with a PCE of 22.1%, a Voc of 1.18 V and a FF close to 80%. The significant improvement in the stability of this device is attributed to the strong hydrophobic nature of the TPA:PS interfacial layer, which was confirmed by the higher contact angle of 91.1° than the angle of 64.0° for the primary perovskite film. Interestingly, this device maintained 91% of its maximum efficiency for 10 days after storage under ambient conditions, which includes a relative humidity of 40–60%.
Recently, the p-type doped conducting polymer 9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-bis-N,N-((-4-butyl phenyl)-bis-N,N-phenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine) (PFB) was successfully employed as an HTM in PSCs. The highest PCE obtained for the fabricated n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs was 14.04%, which is 57% higher than that of the pristine PFB HTL. Increased bulk conductivity as a result of electron transfer from the PFB HOMO energy level to the F4TCNQ LUMO level was achieved through p-doping and confirmed by UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 37). The improved conductivity of the HTM layer is further reflected in a relatively high solar cell PCE of 15.81%. The authors also noted that the hydrophobicity of the HTM layer increases with doping, which better protects the active layer from humidity, thus improving the device's stability. Additional improvements could be achieved by optimizing the thickness of the HTM, as well as using new device structures.
Another HTM was prepared by optimizing the doping of the conjugated polymer (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)]), TFB, with the non-hygroscopic p-type dopant F4-TCNQ. In this respect, the strategy employed was to facilitate efficient charge extraction and thus increase the Jsc and PCE of the n–i–p planar PSC devices to reduce the charge extraction barrier between the perovskite photoactive layer and the F4-TCNQ in doped TFB HTLs. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies revealed that these doped PSCs had the best PCE of 17.46% and performed much better when compared to reference devices based on LiTFSI+ TBP-doped spiro-OMeTAD and LiTFSI+ TBP-doped TFB, which had efficiencies of 16.64% and 11.01% respectively. Furthermore, the improved long-term stability of the TFB (F4-TCNQ)-based device, which maintains approximately 80% of its maximum efficiency after 10 days under ambient conditions with an RH of 45%, is due to the hydrophobic nature of TFB (F4-TCNQ). Comparing it with its LiTFSI+ TBP-doped spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 30%) and LiTFSI+ TBP-doped TFB (ca. 10%) counterparts reveals that it shows a better performance.
The growth of highly crystalline perovskite grains, the development of passive interfacial trap-states, uniform perovskite coating, and appropriate energy alignment are the most important factors required to achieve efficient, large-scale PSCs. To address these challenges, Yao et al. devised a creative strategy where conjugated polyelectrolyte PTFTS interlayers were placed between perovskite and graphene oxide (GO) HTLs in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. A remarkably, strong bond between the GO and PTFTS afforded a uniform interlayer of films via an easy dip-coating procedure. PCEs of 18.2% and 17.0% were obtained for the performances of rigid and flexible devices (1.08 cm2) (Fig. 38), respectively, which were successfully constructed using scalable, PTFTS-modified GO easy processing. Notably, these are amongst the highest PCE values reported to date for large-scale flexible PSCs. The key advantage of this approach is that it affords flexible devices with high mechanical and environmental stabilities that can be scaled up for commercial applications.

A novel small molecule HTM with a π-conjugated molecular structure containing a pyridine central core and electron-donating moieties, PyThTPA (Fig. 39) or 4,4′-(5,5′-(pyridine-2,6-diyl bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline), was developed as a HTM for applications in long-term performance n–i–p PSCs. The HTM had a HOMO energy of −5.06 eV, a high molar absorption coefficient, a high Tg of 120 °C, high hole mobility, and good solubility. A PSC fabricated from PyThTPA had an average PCE of 16.57%, which is 34% higher than the PCE (12.3%) of spiro-OMeTAD doped with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). Only a small reduction in the PCE for devices with no encapsulation together with a slight hysteresis was observed after more than 720 hours, which indicates the outstanding long-term stability of these systems. All PV parameters obtained for this device were superior to those of spiro-OMeTAD, measured under the same conditions. Given the importance of developing stable PSCs for industrial-scale applications, stability tests for devices containing PyThTPA were carried out (Fig. 40). Such studies revealed that increased film uniformity, a smoother morphology, and higher selectivity for the holes were achieved due to the formation of Lewis acid–base adducts (LABA) formed between the pyridine of the HTM and the BCF at the MAPbI3/HTM interface. This in turn enhances the hole extraction, reduces charge recombination at the interface, and improves the hydrophobicity of the film, which enhances the long-term stability of the cell. PSCs containing PyThTPA doped with BCF showed greater mobilities and conductivities, and a PCE of 17% was obtained for the first highly π-conjugated pyridine HTM reported in this field.

The achievement of efficient molecules for effective application in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs is also possible via the molecular engineering of HTMs with non-linear structures. In this respect, the facile synthesis of two non-linear molecules with Y- and X-shaped structures, XSln847 and XSln1453 (Fig. 39), and the relationships between their non-linear π-conjugated structures and physical properties as HTMs were explored. The Y-shaped XSln847 was designed to replace standard PEDOT:PSS and the X-shaped XSln1453 was developed as a reference HTM for use in i-PSCs (Fig. 41). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed the presence of several short intermolecular contacts stabilizing the crystal packing of XSln847 in the solid-state versusXSln1453, which provides a nest-like charge transport layer for more efficient hole transport. Consequently, pristine Y-shaped XSln847 has the highest hole mobility and is, therefore, more effective at quenching photoluminescence. XSln847-based inverted PSCs showed reduced charge recombination and therefore the highest PCE of 15.02% vs. 12.65% for the XSln1453 devices under AM1.5G illumination. Moreover, due to the increased hole mobility and higher quality of the MAPbI3 perovskite, an improvement in the PCE of up to 17.16% was obtained for a solar cell containing XSln847 after doping with F4TCNQ, which is much higher than the PCE of 11.95% recorded for devices containing conventional PEDOT:PSS, measured under the same conditions.
A novel structure comprising two carbazoles and five electron donor groups, Z1 (Fig. 39), was developed as an HTM in n–i–p planar PSCs to inhibit the formation of a V-shaped, twisted structure. This unique structure of this compound prevents crystallization, thus permitting the formation of high-quality homogenous films that are void of pinholes. It also reduces the moisture exposure of the perovskite that, after doping with additives, affords devices with enhanced stabilities due to the aggregation of the HTM. A second reference molecule, Z2, containing fewer electron-donors, and a third X2 (Fig. 39) HTM, with higher symmetry, were introduced for direct comparison to optimize the reproducibility and the performance of the PSCs. For Z1, more efficient hole transfer and uniform, stable amorphous films were obtained, vs. its X2 counterpart. In addition, the presence of electronegative carbazole units and several electropositive electron donors in the structure of Z1 leads to a strong molecular polarization. For this reason, despite its twisted, less symmetrical V-shaped molecular structure, devices containing Z1 had higher conductivities and hole mobilities than their benchmark spiro-OMeTAD counterparts. Furthermore, when compared to Z2, the lower HOMO of Z1 provided a stronger driving force to transfer the excited and separated holes from the perovskite to the HTM Z2 layer. Doped Z1-devices achieved a PCE of up to 18.57% without current hysteresis and retained 72% of their maximum performance after 144 days of storage without encapsulation (Fig. 42). This is in sharp contrast to the doped spiro-OMeTAD reference devices that lose their initial performance after 134 days.
The non-covalent functionalization of an HTM with multi-walled carbon nanotubes is an interesting approach for increasing the device stability of inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Applying this strategy, Zong et al. reported the design and synthesis of four new binaphthylamine-based HTMs bearing different side chains. Although the optoelectronic properties and molecular configurations of these compounds are comparable, they exhibit different thin film properties. Inspired by the structural properties of polymers and the π–π stacking capabilities of carbon nanotubes with large π-spacers, two types of optimized HTMs (Fig. 39) comprised of multi-walled carbon nanotubes bearing amine and methyl substituents (HTM@MWCNTs) were employed for the fabrication of inverted PSCs (Fig. 43). A PCE of 17.17% was obtained for a non-encapsulated device containing the Z7 HTM (Fig. 39) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Z7@MWCNTs). This value is comparable to the value obtained for the pristine HTM (17.32%). Notably, devices containing HTMs@MWCNTs exhibited the greatest stability after storage without encapsulation for 14 days in air.
Several HTMs containing TPA and dibenzofulvene with different MeO substituents (zero for YC-1 (Fig. 39), i.e., four for YC-2, and six for YC-3) were prepared via a facile, cost-effective synthetic strategy and employed for the development of p–i–n type PSCs. The optoelectronic properties of the HTMs were studied, revealing that the inverted p–i–n planar PSC devices comprising YC-1 showed the best PCE of 15.78%, together with greater air stabilities, and relatively low hysteresis when compared to the benchmark PEDOT:PSS-based cells (PCE = 12.80%), measured under the same conditions. The role of YC-1 as an interfacial modified layer in NiOx-derived PSCs with an ITO/NiOx/YC-1/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/bathocuproine/Ag configuration was also investigated. The presence of YC-1 serves to facilitate the growth of micrometer-sized perovskite grains and aid in the formation of smaller amounts of grain boundary defects, which ultimately improves the carrier extraction. The authors observed that in typical NiOx devices, the PCE increased from 17.16 to 18.81%, while the champion cell showed a PCE of 19.37% with a slight hysteresis. A stabilized efficiency of approximately 19% was observed after storage of the devices under argon in the dark for over 1000 hours.
More recently, in 2020, Park et al. developed and prepared TPA/imidazole-based small molecule HTMs (DPI and DNI) (Fig. 39), which have a large dipole moment in the excited state. In this respect, the characteristics of organic HTMs in their excited states, such as transition dipole moments, can be important factors that can be tuned to optimize the charge extraction properties and reduce carrier recombination in the resulting PVs. Moreover, the aggregation properties of organic semiconductors, which have been crucial for improving the carrier transport properties of high-performance organic HTMs, can induce a synergistic effect with their excited state properties, ultimately resulting in high-efficiency perovskite PVs. Studies revealed that the absorption properties of the organic HTMs could be tailored to the UV region, and therefore utilized to block out UV light that degrades the perovskite photoabsorber, which significantly improves the stability of the p–i–n planar type perovskite PVs.

Some of the major advantages of HTLs with spiro structures are the suitability of their energy levels for hole transfer, high thermal stabilities, and their ability to suppress aggregation. Additional oxidizing dopants are needed for the effective performance of pristine spiro-OMeTAD due to its low hole mobility. The placement of benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups with different conjugated lengths between an SFX spiral core and an electron donor was performed to design and prepare three new dopant-free HTMs with spiral structures. Theoretical calculations based on the parent molecule (X59) were initially performed to target the most suitable molecules, Y-1 to Y-3 (Fig. 44), which were prepared via facile synthetic methods. The presence of conjugated groups in these newly designed molecules creates an ICT state that leads to a self-doping effect, affording excellent hole mobility, without the need for any external dopant. The n–i–p PSCs made from Y-1 and Y-3 dopant-free HTMs showed superior hole mobilities, experimental observations that are supported by computational studies. Severe twisting of the molecular structure of Y-2 prevents efficient intermolecular stacking, leading to lower hole mobility when compared to X59. PSCs made from dopant-free Y-1 as the HTM showed the best performances, where a PCE of 16.29% for a champion device under 1 sun illumination was obtained, which is higher than the value of 14.64% for devices containing the dopant free X59 HTM. This investigation shows that the insertion of conjugate groups is a useful strategy for generating isolated charge states that leads to the formation of dopant-free HTMs for application in high-performance PSCs.


The molecular design of efficient linear-shaped HTMs with a D–π–A configuration comprising rigid, flexible substrates has afforded new systems with enhanced PCEs, smaller hysteresis, and good stabilities for application in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Following this strategy a novel D–π–A HTM was developed and prepared by combining the electron-donating properties of TPA, biphenyl, and oxadiazole together with a π-spacer and an electron-acceptor TPA-BP-OXD (Fig. 45) group, where TPA-BP-OXD = 4″′-(5-(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N,N-bis(4-methoxy phenyl)-[1,1′:4′,1″:4″,1″′-quaterphenyl]-4-amine (Fig. 15c). Studies reveal that this compound has a hole mobility of 3.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, a suitable energy level of 5.10 eV, good solubility, and high thermal stability with a Td = 411 °C, making it a favorable HTM for PSCs. The increase in π–π interactions due to the presence of the biphenyl π-spacer, together with the OXD-based section of the molecule, improves its charge transport properties. This system was employed as an HTM for the fabrication of dopant-free solution-processable i-PSCs, which exhibited PCEs of 15.46% and 12.90% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively, with long-term stabilities of more than 700 h. The high PCEs are attributed to the effective extraction of holes from the perovskite and their subsequent rapid transfer to the electrode. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the TPA-BP-OXD molecule increases the stability of the device. It is also noteworthy that for dopant free TPA-BP-OXD-based devices the same performance was observed for both forward and reverse scans with minimal hysteresis, due to the superior compatibility of the linear HTM.

The design and synthesis of three new triarylamine derivatives, TPAC0M, TPAC2M, and TPAC3M (Fig. 45), have also been reported. These molecules share a common conjugated scaffold and are prepared via a simple Suzuki-type coupling reaction (Fig. 16c/Fig. 23d). These compounds can control the carrier extraction and recombination behavior in p–i–n inverse-type planar PSCs, and their properties as high-performance HTMs can be adjusted by varying the number of electron-donor methoxy groups, without the need for dopants. PSCs made from TPACs show superior PCEs when compared to their PEDOT:PSS counterparts due to their superior charge extraction and better ability to suppress non-radiative recombination, as verified by time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photo-voltage experiments. Passivation of HTM–perovskite interface defect sites is expected to occur as the number of methoxy groups in the arylamine moiety increases. In this respect, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements confirmed that the charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTM improved, and the charge recombination in the PSC devices was suppressed, increasing the Jsc and Voc. Consequently, the PCEs for PSCs with an inverse p–i–n configuration fabricated from this family of dopant-free HTMs gradually improved from 13.92% for TPAC0M, with no methoxy units, to 17.54% for TPAC3M containing three methoxy substituents in the arylamine moiety.

The PV data for dopant-free PSCs built from linear structures with TPA terminal units (end groups) are summarized in Table 5. In recent years, two novel small molecule HTMs, ACE-ANT-ACE and TPA-ANT-TPA, were designed and prepared to contain an anthranthrone (ANT) dye molecule at their core and studied for the development of highly efficient, moisture resistant PSCs. Here ACE = 4,10-bis(1,2-dihydro-acenaphthylen-5-yl)-6,12-bis(octyloxy)-6,12-dihydronaphtho[7,8,1,2,3-nopqr]tetraphene and TPA = 4,4′-(6,12-bis(octyloxy)-6,12-dihydronaphtho[7,8,1,2,3-nopqr]tetraphene-4,10-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (Fig. 19f). Both compounds were employed as dopant-free HTMs in n–i–p mesoscopic solid-state PSCs with the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM configuration. A detailed comparison of the optoelectronic properties of the resulting PSCs revealed a good match between the HOMO energy level of TPA-ANT-TPA and the absorption maximum of the valence band of the perovskite, which subsequently affords better hole transfer with a minimal energy offset. The best PCE was obtained for TPA-ANT-TPA in the absence of any dopant. Furthermore, for this device, a slight hysteresis of 17.5% was obtained after optimizing the metal oxide scaffolding and the processing conditions, versus 16.8% for the spiro-OMeTAD reference, measured under the same conditions. As a result of the photocurrent density and the higher FF of 0.79, an excellent current of 21 mA cm−2 was also achieved. The authors concluded that these PSC devices are more cost-effective and can more easily be synthesized and purified and have better environmental stabilities when compared to the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD system.

In closely related work, a novel group of low-cost small molecule dopant-free HTMs was developed by functionalizing a fluoranthene core molecule and TPA units with methoxy substituents at the 3-, 8- or the 3-, 8-, 9-positions to afford linear (BTF2, FBA1, FBA2, FBA3) and star-shaped (FTA1, FTA2) compounds. In addition, the effect of several structural changes to the molecules was studied including varying the linkage between TPA groups, the central core of the fluoranthene, and the substitution positions of methoxy units in the TPA groups (para versus meta), to examine how such structural changes impact the crystal packing, thermal and photophysical properties and their performances as HTMs in n–i–p planar PSCs. In their design strategy, the authors considered the following factors: (i) in D–A type HTMs, lowering the HOMO levels and increasing the hole mobilities of HTMs are achieved by replacing diphenylamine with TPA capping units; (ii) increasing the π-ethylene bridges slightly increases the HOMO energies and the π–π interactions that subsequently increases the hole mobilities of the HTMs; and (iii) the tendency of branched materials to significantly increase the Tg of the HTMs by more than 20 °C when compared to linear structures. In this respect, the possibility of creating a high-quality thin film on the surface of the perovskite layer will more likely result in fewer hole mobilities, and (iv) the most effective design strategy is to introduce methoxy groups at the meta positions of the molecules since this lowers the HOMO levels and improves the mobilities of the HTMs. Addressing these parameters, a new compound, FBA3, costing $14.75 per g for laboratory preparation was employed as a dopant-free HTM in PSCs with a PCE of 19.27%. Interestingly, this molecule is one of the cheapest dopant-free organic HTMs reported to date.
A novel D–A–D molecule, TPA-BPFN-TPA, comprised of a biphenyl fumaronitrile (BPFN) acceptor and a conjugated TPA donor (where TPA = 2,3-bis(4′-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)fumaronitrile), with a low-lying HOMO, was successfully prepared and subsequently used as an HTM, without the addition of hygroscopic additives such as LiTFSI, in devices with the n–i–p mesoporous perovskite architecture (Fig. 16d). Dopant-free TPA-BPFN-TPA devices showed a PCE of 18.4% under 1 sun illumination. With respect to their indoor applications, remarkable efficiencies of 30% under 1000 lux and 20.1% under 200 lux illumination, without hysteresis, were obtained for devices fabricated from undoped TPABPFN-TPA. In addition, devices using TPA-BPFN-TPA without encapsulation showed significant improvement in device stability when compared to the spiro-OMeTAD-containing devices measured under conditions of 70% relative humidity. This is attributed to their improved hole transfer properties, which are a consequence of better hole mobility, efficient photoluminescence quenching, and hydrophobic properties.
A bi-component HTL, comprised of inorganic NiOx and an organic small molecule with a D–A–D configuration, was employed in a p–i–n planar perovskite PV cell. The new compound (4′,4″′-(1,3,4-oxadiazole-2,5-diyl)bis(N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine)), consisting of TPA and oxadiazole (Fig. 17d), was shown to be an effective OX-HTM in the absence of any dopant. The increased performance of the resulting PV cells by more than 20% efficiency was attributed to the introduction of methoxy substituents that inactivate defects in the perovskite layer, improving the crystalline nature of the perovskite, which in turn suppresses non-radiative recombination. The authors also reported that the overall stability of the p–i–n planar PSC devices containing OX-HTMs is due to the reduction of defect sites associated with their UV-blocking properties.

One of the most important factors for the realization of high-performance, stable PSCs is the management of perovskite defects and their interface together with the interlayer. Several methoxy-functionalized TPA-imidazole derivatives (TPI, TPI-2MEO, TPI-4MEO, and TPI-6MEO) have been developed, which simultaneously function as both HTMs and surface-modifiers. These molecules have subsequently been applied at the interface between NiOx and the perovskite layer in p–i–n planar-type PSCs for the development of high-performance, stable PSCs. The authors reported that the molecules function as HTLs with high hole mobilities, appropriate energy levels, and visible transparency. Furthermore, the introduction of methoxy substituents into their organic framework lowers the HOMO energy levels that subsequently improve the hole extraction process. In addition, the formation of Lewis adducts between N and O atoms in HTL molecules with uncoordinated Ni and Pb ions in NiOx and perovskite passivates those defect sites bifacially and improves the crystallinity of the perovskite. Consequently, improved hole extraction and decreased charge recombination properties were obtained for the resulting p–i–n PSCs in the absence of any dopant, properties which were optimized further by increasing the number of methoxy substituents in the TPA-imidazole conjugated scaffold. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy studies were carried out to observe the formed Lewis adducts. Time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photovoltage studies also confirmed enhanced charge extraction and decreased recombination kinetics. In addition, a significant increase in the stability of the PSCs without encapsulation under constant UV irradiation in air is due to the UV-blocking ability of organic HTLs, which in turn improves the interfacial properties and enhances the crystallinity of the perovskite layer.

In high-performance PSCs, the development of solution-processable HTLs that do not require dopants is important. In this respect, a π-conjugated small molecule, N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB), was utilized as an efficient, dopant-free HTL in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs to replace the commonly used PEDOT:PSS. Using NPB gave the best value of 19.96% for PCE with a Jsc value of 22.92 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 78.4%. This Voc is one of the highest obtained values in CH3NH3PbI3-based inverted PSCs and is comparable to those of devices with regular structure. The contact of NPB with the perovskite active layer afforded a larger grain size and better crystallinity and significantly reduced recombination loss in inverted PSCs. Moreover, when compared to PEDOT:PSS, NPB exhibited more efficient hole extraction and transport properties, which further enhanced the Jsc. In addition, the much greater long-term stabilities of PSCs containing NPB HTLs were attributed to their hydrophobic nature.

In 2019, Liang et al. employed three TPA organic HTMs, TZ1, TZ2, and TZ3, with different conjugate bridges for application in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. The optical and electrochemical properties and PV performances of these HTMs were subsequently investigated. TZ3 has a 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene conjugate bridge with a more stable HOMO (−5.26 eV) and increased hole extraction capability, and afforded the highest PCE of 16.33% in inverted PSCs with no dopant, when compared to TZ1 (4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (MPDTP)) (12.96%) and TZ2 (2,2-bithiophene (BT)) (14.83%). The nature of the conjugated bridges (MPDTP, BT, and DTTT) had a significant impact on the performances of the PV cells with different device configurations. In this respect, inverted PSCs comprising TZ1, TZ2, and TZ3 showed the opposite trends in their PCEs when fabricated into direct devices. The authors also found that molecules with a linear TPA, containing a highly conjugated, fused bridge, are also suitable HTMs for direct PSCs, and foster intermolecular interactions. The conductivity of such systems could be increased by enhancing the thickness of the HTM film. An increase in the HOMO was observed via the insertion of such a bridge due to the reduction of the HTM energy gap, which has a negative effect on the Voc of the inverted PSC. It is noteworthy that the efficiency of such inverted PSCs is strongly dependent on the Voc, which was also confirmed by PV studies. This study serves to highlight that the efficiencies of HTMs can differ significantly when used in PSCs with different configurations.

Most small-molecule HTM-based dopant-free PSCs developed to date have PCEs less than 20% and are thus not yet optimal for commercialization. Recently, a facile method was reported for the preparation of two dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) molecular semiconductors (DTPC8-ThTPA and DTPC13-ThTPA) (Fig. 19g). In this respect, the judicious combination of extended π-conjugation and N-alkylation of the DTP cores allowed their energy levels, hole mobility, and film-forming deposition properties over the perovskite layer to be optimized. These conjugated molecules exhibited HOMO energy levels of −4.82 eV and hole mobilities of up to 2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Due to their superior film-forming properties and high (99%) photoluminescence quenching efficiencies, they were effectively used as HTMs in PSCs with an n–i–p planar configuration. In this study, N-alkyl chains were introduced into the DTP cores to modulate the crystallinity and solubility of the molecules, fine-tuning their hole mobilities and film-forming characteristics. Perovskite MA0.7FA0.3PbI2.85Br0.15 based devices exhibited encouraging PCEs of over 20%, with DTP-core based, undoped HTMs, surpassing those of the fully doped standard spiro-OMeTAD HTMs. This family of dopant-free HTM based-PSC devices exhibited PCEs of up to 20.38%.
A new small molecule dopant-free HTM was developed with a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole core, DTP-C6Th (Fig. 13c). A similar energy level and a hole mobility of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were recorded, again affording more efficient hole extraction when compared to spiro-OMeTAD, which in turn afforded efficient, high-stability HTM-based n–i–p planar PSCs without the need for any dopants. The best PCE reported to date for PSCs containing this HTM in the absence of any dopant is 21.04%, which was obtained after careful device optimization by placing a very thin passive layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) and correctly adjusting the composition of the perovskite adsorbent layer with Br. Devices fabricated from DTP-C6Th retained more than 85% of their original PCE, after storage in a glove box for 60 days without encapsulation in air at a relative humidity of ca. 35%. Hence, the conclusion is that DTP-C6Th is a very attractive dopant-free HTM that could be further exploited as a more stable candidate for PSC commercialization.
An effective small molecule HTM, H2, was developed by Li et al. containing fluorinated methoxy TPA, which simultaneously improves the performance and stability of dopant-free inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Improving the alignment of the energy levels, the hole extraction, and the film morphology, and thus facilitating better contacts at the HTM/perovskite interface, increased the quality of the perovskite active layer in devices containing the fluorine-methoxy TPA hybrid H2. Consequently, inverted PSCs made of dopant-free H2 showed the highest PCE of 18.69% with a Jsc of 22.93 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.06 V and a FF of 76.9%, together with a small hysteresis; thus H2 represents one of the best dopant-free organic small molecule HTMs reported to date for traditional MAPbI3 PSCs. In addition, good stabilities were also observed for devices containing H2 without any encapsulation under ambient conditions.
Smart design strategies are important to provide new avenues for the development of high-performance PSCs containing dopant-free SM-HTMs. Two novel D–A-type SM-HTMs comprising a phenylamine donor and imide-functionalized thiophene acceptor groups, 2,8-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-octyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-c:2′,3′-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (MPA-BTI) and 2,8-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-dodecyl-4H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-c]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (MPA-BTTI), were designed and prepared. These compounds synergistically integrated the previously mentioned key design principles for the realization of highly efficient HTMs and exhibited similar electrochemical and photophysical properties, but different molecular configurations and thin-film morphologies. Excellent efficiencies of 21.17% for reverse scan and 21.01% for forward scan, with low hysteresis and excellent thermal stability and long-term stability under illumination, were recorded for inverted p–i–n planar PSCs fabricated from MPA-BTTI, in the absence of any dopant. Furthermore, these devices maintained 90% of their maximum efficiency after 500 hours of constant illumination and 94% of their original PCE after heat stress at 80 °C for 800 hours in an inert environment. Good alignment of the energy levels, good hole mobilities, and, most importantly, superior film morphology contribute to the unique performance of the MPA-BTTI device (Fig. 46). In recent years, Guo and co-workers expanded the previous study and developed three new donor–acceptor (D–A) MPA-BTTI derivatives containing alkyl side chains that were varied in length (i.e., n-dodecyl, n-octyl, and n-hexyl, in BTTI-C12, BTTI-C8, and BTTI-C6, respectively), while maintaining the original molecular scaffolds, as HTMs for normal n–i–p planar PSCs. Although comparable photophysical and electrochemical properties were observed for these molecules with different side chains, they were quite different in terms of their film-forming capabilities that significantly influence the processes of charge extraction, transportation, and recombination. Therefore, the length of the side chains ultimately has a significant influence on the performance of the resulting PSCs. The sharp reduction in root means square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite layers due to the capping with HTMs, and the creation of a uniform, pinhole-free HTM layer in the devices was obtained by comparing topographic AFM images. Studies revealed that a device prepared from BTTI-C6 maintained over 85% of its original efficiency after 100 days, in contrast to the device comprising doped spiro-OMeTAD that underwent a reduction in performance to about 45% over the same time period. Increasing the static contact angle (α) of deionized water droplets from 72.1° for spiro-OMeTAD to 98.7° for BTTI-C6 indicates an improvement in the hydrophobic properties of the BTTI-C6 film, which in turn increases its long-term stability (Fig. 47). Furthermore, the results from this study suggested that PCEs of 19.69%, 18.89%, and 17.49% were obtained for BTTI-C6, BTTI-C8, and BTTI-C12 based devices, respectively, indicating that shortening the BTTI side-chain resulted in a significant improvement in hole mobility, film morphology, stability, and device performance. Notably, these values are comparable to the PCE of 19.90% for a device fabricated from conventional doped spiro-OMeTAD. The authors concluded that long-term storage, light soaking, and thermal stability are the most important advantages of these non-encapsulated BTTI-C6 devices when directly compared to their spiro-OMeTAD counterparts.
Two dopant-free HTMs with planar indacenodithiophene (IDT) cores and different electron-rich TPA methoxy sidearms, IDTC4-TPA and IDTC6-TPA, were reported, which were subsequently employed in CH3NH3PbI3 n–i–p planar PSCs to adjust the electronic properties, solubility, and crystal packing of molecules. These HTMs were obtained from commercially available, inexpensive precursors via a simple one-step strategy, without the need for any costly, complex purification methods. Crystallographic studies reveal that, in the crystal lattice, intermolecular interactions involve predominantly CH/π or CH/O hydrogen bonds. Moreover, the IDTC6 backbone facilitates close π–π stacking interactions (3.399 Å). Studies reveal that thin films of IDTC-TPA show higher mobilities when compared to their IDTC4-TPA counterparts. In addition, analyzing the structure of the perovskite/HTM film reveals that, at the perovskite/IDTC6-TPA interface, the photoluminescence quenching is much more efficient than that at the perovskite/IDTC4-TPA interface. As a result, excellent PV properties with an optimum performance of 15.43% were observed for devices fabricated from IDTC6-TPA, versus devices containing DTC4–TPA.
An efficient strategy was developed to enhance the performance of dopant-free HTMs comprising a quinoxaline core (Fig. 17e). Two HTMs, TQ3 and TQ4, were prepared that have very different molecular structures and charge transport properties. The co-planar π-extended quinoxaline core in TQ4 not only greatly enhances its thermal stability, but also results in close face-to-face π–π stacking interactions in the crystal lattice (Fig. 48). Dopant-free thin films containing TQ4 achieved a high hole mobility of 2.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost double that of TQ3. Studies also reveal that TQ4 has a suitable alignment of its energy levels and high thermal stability that makes it suitable for application in PSCs. In this respect, dopant-free PSCs containing this HTM with a planar n–i–p configuration exhibited a PCE of over 21%, with excellent long-term stabilities representing a significant advancement in the development of dopant-free HTM based PSCs.
The twisted organic small molecule XY1 was reported as a robust dopant-free HTM for application in high-performance inverted p–i–n planar PSCs (Fig. 49). The authors successfully appended four TPA groups with methoxy substituents onto a small thieno[2,3-b]thiophene core via a one-step reaction. Much higher hole transfer properties and specific UV absorption spectra are observed for XY1 when compared to traditional PEDOT:PSS. It forms a uniform, smooth film that facilitates the growth of a dense and homogeneous perovskite layer without any pinholes. Additionally, the PV performance of the device containing XY1 is characterized by a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 22.21 mA cm−2, and a FF of 76.18%, versus comparable devices containing PEDOT:PSS which have a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 21.39 mA cm−2, a FF of 74.03% and a PCE of 16.31%. The hysteresis-free inverted PSCs using XY1 as the dopant-free HTM exhibit excellent photovoltaic performance with Voc and PCE values of up to 1.11 V and 18.78%. This increased performance is mainly attributed to the much higher mobility of the holes and the suitability of the frontier orbital energy levels with the valence band edge of the perovskite layer, which facilitates highly efficient hole extraction/transport processes. The preservation of 95% of the original PCE of the device containing XY1 after soaking in light for 200 hours indicates a significant improvement in its operational stability. Finally, undoped XY1-based inverted PSCs with large-areas (aperture 1.00 cm2) could be fabricated with excellent performances and device parameters that include a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 21.52 mA cm−2, a FF of 75.28% and a PCE of 17.82%.

As previously mentioned, an attractive strategy for developing efficient, cost-effective inverted p–i–n planar PSCs is to use dopant-free HTMs that are prepared by low-cost, facile synthetic routes. Following this approach, two novel organic small molecules with fluorene-bridge-benzene (FB) or fluorene-bridge-thiophene (FT) central cores, coupled with triarylamine groups (TPA), FB-OMeTPA and FT-OMeTPA, respectively, were recently developed as dopant-free HTMs for application in inverted PSCs. Replacement of one of the FB-OMeTPA benzene rings with thiophene afforded FT-OMeTPA, which is remarkably more co-planar as evidenced by its red-shifted absorbance and smaller bandgap. FT-OMeTPA has much higher hole mobility when compared to FB-OMeTPA, which is attributed to the introduction of the thiophene unit. FT-OMeTPA-based devices, when compared to FB-OMeTPA systems, allow surface passivity and facilitate charge transfer through the interfaces, which facilitate increased hole mobility, higher PCEs, operational stability, and a smaller hysteresis. The authors proposed that this is mainly attributed to the strong Pb2+–S interactions at the FT-OMeTPA/perovskite interface, which is also supported through DFT calculations. The optimized PCE for inverted PVSCs based on FT-OMeTPA was 17.57%, which was higher than that of its FB-OMeTPA counterpart (14.35%). The good hole extraction ability and cost of only ∼$28 per g make FT-OMeTPA a promising HTM for the realization of efficient, low-cost PVSCs.

In 2019, Bolink and co-workers designed, synthesized and fully characterized two organic HTMs based on functionalized 9,9-bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)fluorenes and TPA moieties, 4,4′-(3,6-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline), TPA-3,6-FLTPA-TPA, and 4,4′-(2,7-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline), TPA-2,7-FLTPA-TPA. The two compounds were prepared from inexpensive starting materials via an elegant synthetic pathway. Various techniques were used to study how the diverse substituents (2,7- vs. 3,6-positions) on the FLTPA cores affect the optical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of these materials. Studies were then carried out to compare their performances as dopant-free HTMs in inverted p–i–n planar PSC devices, versus standard N4,N4,N4″,N4″-tetra([1,10-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4,1″-terphenyl]-4,4″-diamine (TaTm)-containing devices. The newly synthesized materials exhibited superior thermal stabilities with a high Tg that are comparable to values obtained for spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions. This study was the first to integrate fluorene-based HTMs into inverted PSC devices. Under 1 sun conditions, a PCE of 13.9% was achieved for devices based on TPA-3,6-FLTPA-TPA, while for TPA-2,7-FLTPA-TPA the highest PCE was 17.1%, attributed to its better FF. This is the highest PCE reported for inverted devices using a CH3NH3PbI3 active layer and a TPA derivative-based HTM. The synthetic cost of these two compounds is quite low. Given that devices prepared from the standard TaTm HTM exhibited a total efficiency of 15.9%, the results obtained from this study suggest that a linear molecular structure is better than its twisted counterpart. Devices made from TPA-2,7-FLTPA-TPA not only show the highest performances but also show comparable stability under similar aging conditions to TaTm. Deposition of dopant-free, small organic molecule HTMs onto flexible, rigid substrates in both inverted-type p–i–n planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (i-PSCs) and bulk heterojunction inverted organic solar cells (BHJ IOSCs) afforded devices with suitable long-term stabilities and no hysteresis, which are two of the most important factors that need to be addressed to improve the commercial applications of PCEs. With this strategy in mind, the design and synthesis of a novel organic small molecule HTM (N-(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-7-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-N-(7-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine, CzPAF-TPA, was reported. The compound was prepared via a simple coupling strategy and utilized for the preparation of both highly efficient solution-processable flexible and rigid inverted-type planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (i-PSCs) as well as flexible, rigid bulk heterojunction inverted organic solar cells (BHJ IOSCs). For the undoped flexible i-PSCs, the best PCE of 12.46% was obtained, and for flexible BHJ IOSCs the best PCE of 7.52% was recorded. These performances were attributed to the extensive conjugation of the HTMs resulting in a suitable HOMO energy level of −5.07 eV, as well as the uniform properties of the films with no pinholes, which afforded high hole mobility. Interestingly, high PCE values of 15.71% and ∼8.74% were obtained for i-PSCs and BHJ IOSCs, respectively, in the absence of any dopants, which were built onto rigid ITO substrates. The efficient hole transfer of MAPbI3 to CzPAF-TPA was demonstrated by flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity studies. Flexible solar cells containing dopant-free CzPAF-TPA deposited onto PET/ITO and rigid substrates displayed high performances and maintained their initial performance for more than 500 hours, with only a minimal reduction observed after 20–30 days. This long-term stability is attributed to the optimal hydrophilicity of the alkyl chains of the HTMs. It is noteworthy that the superior compatibility of the novel HTM and the easy transfer of holes to the electrode lead to low hysteresis and similar efficiencies in the forward and reverse scans for devices containing the dopant-free CzPAF-TPA.

The star-shaped molecule 4,4′,4″-tris(3-methylphenylphenylamino)triphenylamine, m-MTDATA (Fig. 50), was investigated as an effective HTM in PSCs. The authors demonstrated that a solution-processable m-MTDATA film, in the absence of dopant, was energetically beneficial as an HTL to replace PEDOT:PSS for inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. A non-stoichiometric precursor solution with a molar ratio of 0.96:1 (PbI2/MAI) afforded the best device performance of 17.73% and a FF of 79.6%, which contributes to the intense passivity of traps and low resistance loss from unreacted PbI2 in the perovskite layer. The replacement of PEDOT:PSS with m-MTDATA was carried out in order to evaluate its potential as a new HTL for dopant-free inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Inverted PSCs fabricated via a simple solution process were compared to PEDOT:PSS systems and showed a PCE of 18.12% vs. 13.44%, a Jsc of 22.50 vs. 20.37 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1035 vs. 837 mV, and a FF of 77.8% vs. 78.9%. In this respect, PSCs comprising m-MTDATA performed better than their PEDOT:PSS counterparts. The authors found that the increased electrical conductivity, optimal energy level alignments, and efficient hole extraction were the most important reasons for the observed improvements in device performance. In addition, the stability of devices containing m-MTDATA without any encapsulation was much better than the stability of those containing PEDOT:PSS, under ambient conditions for 1000 h at a relative humidity of 30%. These results demonstrate that the small molecule m-MTDATA could be employed as a promising HTM for the fabrication of efficient, stable inverted planar PSCs.

An alternative approach is to build stable, cost-effective devices from star-shaped TPAs as dopant-free HTMs. Following this strategy, two dopant-free starburst HTMs based on TPA, Z1012 and Z1013 (Fig. 50), were prepared and subsequently applied in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Studies reveal that these compounds have high hole mobilities, appropriate thermal stabilities, and energy levels for PSCs with CH3NH3PbI3. PV cells consisting of Z1013 with no dopants or additives achieved superior performances with a PCE of 15.4%, which is amongst the highest efficiencies recorded to date for PSCs comprising star-shaped HTMs. Importantly, these two devices presented superior stabilities when compared to devices containing spiro-OMeTAD, after aging under ambient conditions at both room temperature and at 80 °C in the dark.

The PV data for dopant-free PSCs built from X-shaped, star-shaped compounds with tetra-TPA arms are summarized in Table 6. Five imidazole-based star-shaped oligo(arylamines) (Ph-TPA-2A, Ph-TPA-4A, Th-TPA-4A, Ph-TPA-6A, and TPE-TPA-8A) were prepared in good yields via a cost-effective synthetic strategy and used as non-doped HTMs for the fabrication of efficient PSCs with conventional n–i–p planar cell configurations (Fig. 51). The best-recorded efficiency for solar-to-electricity conversion was ∼17.5%, which was better than the values obtained for LiTFSI/t-BP devices doped with the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD. The Ph-TPA-4A-based cells retained ∼90% of the original amount of PCE after 25 days, which is far superior to that of standard doped spiro-OMeTAD cells. Furthermore, the larger contact angle of these HTMs on a glass substrate supports the hypothesis that the better stability of the Ph-TPA-4A cells is most likely ascribed to the absence of hydrophilic dopants.

Several cost-effective HTMs referred to as TOP-HTMs have been designed and synthesized in recent years for use in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. These molecules are prepared from inexpensive starting materials, via a facile synthetic pathway. The structure of the molecules contains several 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA units attached to a central benzene core through trans-vinylene groups (Fig. 34c). The electronic properties of these compounds are strongly affected by the position and number of vinyl triarylamine units around the benzene core. In this respect, the highest hole mobility and best amorphous stability were observed for the X-shaped TOP-HTM 3, with four substituents at the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-positions of the benzene core. PCEs of 17.5% in the forward scan and 18.6% in the reverse scan were obtained for CH3NH3PbI3-containing solar cells fabricated from TOP-HTM 3 in the presence of additives. These values are comparable to the PCEs of 18.0% and 18.4% achieved for standard PSC devices containing spiro-OMeTAD with additives. Furthermore, PCEs of 16.0% in the forward scan and 16.6% in the reverse scan were obtained for TOP-HTM 3-based devices in the absence of any additives, which are significantly higher than the PCEs of 11.4% and 12.1% recorded for additive-free devices containing spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, the device stability achieved when using these X-shaped HTMs is far superior to that of reference devices with spiro-OMeTAD.
Azomethine compounds pave the way for the synthesis of highly efficient, environmentally friendly HTMs via palladium-free synthetic pathways. Following this strategy, three new organic dopant-free molecules with X-shaped structures, D31, D32, and D33, were successfully synthesized and characterized. These compounds contain simple benzene cores with four arms, comprising two TPA electron donors (D), and two azomethine π-bridges linking phenyl units bearing various substituents (H for D31, OMe for D32, and CN for D33), which were employed for the fabrication of inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. The compounds were isolated in three steps and the final compounds were purified by recrystallization. These HTMs have well-matched energy levels to the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The highest performance was achieved for a champion device containing D33, which has a PCE of 17.85%, while PCEs of 15.83% and 13.47% were obtained for devices containing D32 and D31, respectively. The impressive performance of D33 is due to its high solubility, superior hole mobility, well-matched energy levels, and more uniform layers that facilitate faster hole transfer. In this design, it was determined that the hydrophobicity of the three novel molecules not only affords large grain formation and dense perovskite films but also improves the overall stability of the p–i–n PSC devices. After optimization, retention of 70% of the initial performance, without encapsulation under ambient conditions after 400 h, was demonstrated for devices fabricated from D33.
The new organic molecule DMZ was synthesized as a dopant-free HTM and used for the realization of inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Studies showed that the thickness of the HTL layer effectively increases the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite layer that in turn serves to reduce the series resistance and defects within the crystalline material. As a result, for DMZ-based devices with a thin film thickness of ∼13 nm (2 mg mL−1) under standard AM 1.5 illumination conditions, a champion PCE of 18.61%, with a Jsc of 22.62 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.02 V and a FF of 81.05% (with an average of 17.62%), was obtained, which is ∼1.5 times higher than the values obtained for conventional PEDOT:PSS systems. Furthermore, the DMZ-based devices demonstrate long-term stability, maintaining 90% of their maximum efficiency without any encapsulation, after 556 h in air (RH ≈ 45%–50%). In contrast, the comparable PEDOT:PSS devices retained only 36% of their maximum PCE after 77 h under the same conditions. Hence, we can conclude that DMZ is an attractive cost-effective alternative HTM to PEDOT:PSS, or polytriarylamine for the fabrication of planar, inverted PSCs.
In 2020, Wang et al. successfully prepared and characterized two novel HTMs based on pyrene, PYR16 and PYR27. In these systems, arylamine units N4-[4-[bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-phenyl]-N1,N1-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-benzenediamine were introduced into different positions (1,6- and 2,7-positions) of the pyrene core to study their effect on the optical and electronic properties of the pyrene-based HTMs, and on the performances of the resulting n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Such studies revealed that PYR16 has higher dihedral angles than PYR27, leading to a lower degree of planarity which affords better film formation, higher hole mobility, and a lower HOMO level. The highest PCE of 17.00% was obtained for PSCs fabricated with PYR16 without any dopant, versus a PCE of 14.67% recorded for PYR27. In addition, PSCs fabricated from PYR16 showed better stability when compared to devices using PYR27 (Fig. 52). PSCs comprising PYR16 also retained 98% of their original values for 1080 hours under ambient conditions at 80 °C in the dark, and 85% of their original values for 672 hours under continuous simulated AM1.5G light soaking under ambient conditions at 45–50 °C.
The development of state-of-the-art HTMs suitable for commercial applications is faced with the constant challenge of designing molecules that have optimal molecular configurations, afford suitable morphologies and uniformity, and exhibit excellent charge transport properties when fabricated into devices. The first class of semi-locked building blocks containing tetrathienylethene (TTE) was recently reported as promising HTMs that permit fine control over their molecular planarity (Fig. 27e). In this study, two new HTMs, TTE-1 and TTE-2, were developed. TTE-1 had an orthogonal configuration with a non-locked TTE core and four end-capped TPA units but showed only average performance in PSCs due to its low mobility. Using a semi-locked TTE core together with four TPA groups, a second compound, TTE-2, was prepared, which for the first time had a hybridization that affords a molecular conformation that lies between orthogonal and planar, resulting in an incredible balance between its hole-transport properties and morphology modulations in solution-processed thin films. Due to its high hole mobility, low lying HOMO level and superior thin-film quality, PSCs with n–i–p planar architecture containing TTE-2 as the HTM without dopant showed a maximum PCE of 20.04%, which is 50% higher when compared to devices containing TTE-1 and is one of the best-reported results to date for dopant-free HTM-based PSCs with superior long-term stabilities (PCE loss <15% after 1000 h storage). The development of solution-processable organic semiconductors, using promising semi-locked TTE building blocks, is, therefore, a facile way to finely tune both the molecular structure and the planarity of HTMs to achieve an optimal balance between morphology and charge-transport properties.
The design and preparation of two π-conjugated small molecule HTL materials BDT-TPA-sTh and BDT-TPA-sTPA were reported. Chemically modifying the fused BDT core (BDT-TPA) via the introduction of conjugated 2-ethylhexyl-thienyl groups (sTh) and TPA units bearing terminal methoxy groups (sTPA) allowed the molecular structure of the molecules to be finely tuned (Fig. 16e). In this respect, BDT-TPA-sTh had a planar conformation due to the presence of its planar fused benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) core and conjugated thiophene side chain. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that π⋯π and S⋯π contacts stabilized the crystal packing of the molecules in the solid-state. This led to a significant improvement in the hole mobility of the HTL without the need for any dopants. The possibility of reverse diffusion into the perovskite film was achieved due to the marginal solubility of the BDT-TPA-sTh HTL in p–i–n planar PSCs. This led to further inactivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ ion defects by the Lewis-base S atoms of BDT-TPA-sTh, without damaging the HTL. A champion device with a PCE of 20.5% was obtained, accompanied by an improvement in the moisture stability of the planar p–i–n PSCs. Most importantly, a weak PV-thickness dependence for this material afforded an optimal PCE of 15.30% for a 1 cm2 modular PSC device containing the BDT-TPA-sTh HTL that was applied via blade coating.
Recently, dopant-free HTMs have received a great deal of consideration in the search for stable PSCs. Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole star-shaped derivatives as HTMs are promising options for advancing the large-scale production of PSCs. In this respect, a novel star-shaped dopant-free HTM, DTPC8-ThDTPA, was successfully developed by linking a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole core to four TPA arms via flanking thiophene bridges. Interestingly, the existence of the thiophene bridge modulates the electronic and geometrical structures of the molecule. The most important features of this star-shaped molecule are its favorable HOMO energy level (4.85 eV), optimal IP (5.13 eV), suitable thermal stability with a Tg of >120.3 °C, and high hole mobility (6.50 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hydrophobicity of the molecule is higher when compared to films containing the gold standard spiro-OMeTAD. The n–i–p planar device containing MA0.7FA0.3PbI2.85Br0.15 and the dopant-free HTM as a cap on the perovskite layer showed the best PCE of 19.42% vs. 19.59% for the device containing fully doped spiro-OMeTAD (19.59%).
PSCs need to exhibit both high PCEs and good operational stabilities to be suitable for future commercial applications. The number of PSCs reported to date containing dopant-free small molecule HTMs, which show superior stability under both heat and light illumination, are scarce. To address this problem, Wang and co-workers reported the design and preparation of two novel HTMs containing benzodithiophene and 9-(4-methoxyphenyl)carbazole cores, namely N1,N1′-(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(N1-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-N4,N4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzene-1,4-diamine), BDT-4MeOTPA, and N1,N1′-(9-(4-methoxy phenyl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)bis(N1-(4-(bis(4-methoxy phenyl)amino)phenyl))-N4,N4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzene-1,4-diamine), PhCz-4MeOTPA. Adjustment of the solubility and molecular packing of these compounds was performed via the introduction of methoxyphenyl substituents on the carbazole core of the molecules. The subsequent influence of these cores on the physicochemical characterization of the HTMs and the performance of the resulting n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs were studied. Suitable energy levels, high Tg, and good hole mobilities are the most important features of these HTMs. Of the two, PhCz-4MeOTPA is the most planar and has the most electron-rich carbazole. In contrast, BDT-4MeOTPA lacks the molecular stacking arrangement needed to enhance the quality of the film and increase hole-transport mobility and charge transport properties. PSCs fabricated from the dopant-free PhCz-4MeOTPA showed a PCE of 16.04% under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2), which was higher than that of the dopant-free BDT-4MeOTPA, and slightly lower than that of HTMs containing doped spiro-OMeTAD (19.20%), measured under similar conditions. The higher molecular weight, more rigid structure, and absence of dopants result in the two HTMs having good thermal stability, and the interfacial degradation of the HTM layer is, therefore, less in these PSC devices. Non-encapsulated PSCs containing PhCz-4MeOTPA maintained 82% of their maximum efficiency for 672 h under continuous ambient sun illumination at 40–45 °C, and 92% of their initial PCE for 1200 h at 80 °C in the dark.
A novel organic small molecule was prepared with a bifunctional saddle shape, namely 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-aniline)-α,β-cycloocta[1,2-b:4,3-b′:5,6-b″:8,7-b″′]tetrathiophenyl, α,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD, and studied as both the interfacial layer and dopant-free HTL in high-performance PSCs. When compared to spiro-OMeTAD, this new material has a higher HOMO energy level (−5.30 eV) and higher hole mobility (2.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The n–i–p mesoporous PSCs made from α,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD without dopants and an interfacial layer combined with chlorobenzene (CB) as the anti-solvent had a PCE of 17.22% under AM1.5 conditions, which was very competitive with the PCE of 16.83% obtained for PSCs containing doped spiro-OMeTAD, measured under similar conditions. Most importantly, PSC devices containing α,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD maintained 86% of their initial efficiency without dopant after approximately 800 hours of storage under dry conditions, without encapsulation in the dark, versus only 20% for their doped spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, after 600 hours under similar conditions. PL, SEM, XRD, SCLC, TrPL, and theoretical DFT calculations were used to investigate the small molecule (SM) mechanism in the devices. All these studies show that the improved charge separation, transport properties, and stability of the resulting PSCs occur because of the use of a small molecule.
Following this work, the design and preparation of two novel saddle-shaped HTMs, α,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD (MF-1) and β,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD (MF-2), were reported. These molecules contained a flexible core, with a tunable conformation, and were employed as dopant-free HTMs for application in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. For the device containing MF-2, the best performance afforded a PCE of 18.53%, a Jsc of 22.68 mA cm2, a Voc of 1.04 V, and a FF of 78.48%, versus a PCE of 17.59%, a Jsc of 21.32 mA cm2, a Voc of 1.02 V and a FF of 80.75% for MF-1. The maintenance of 80% of the maximum PCE after 150 days of storage in a glovebox and 60% of the maximum efficiency for 300 h after storage in an ambient environment including a humidity of approximately 40% was achieved for devices containing both HTMs without any encapsulation. These results suggest that α,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD and β,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD compounds are promising HTMs, for the fabrication of highly efficient, stable PSCs.

The advancement of solution-processable, dopant-free HTMs is crucial for the future broadscale applications of PSCs. Recently, a tetra-methoxy TPA substituted zinc phthalocyanine, OTPA-ZnPc, (Fig. 53) was designed, prepared, and subsequently applied as a dopant-free HTM for (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. The introduction of 4,4′-dimethoxy TPA side chains onto the ZnPc core afforded excellent solubility in various solvents, including dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, and chlorobenzene. Optimized PSC devices achieved a PCE of 16.23% with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 22.36 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.43, under AM1.5G standard conditions. Furthermore, owing to the hydrophobicity of the OTPA-ZnPc, the solar cells maintained approximately 80% of their maximum PCE without encapsulation, after storage for 720 h under ambient conditions, including 45% relative humidity, which was better than spiro-OMeTAD devices measured under similar conditions.

Two new, dopant-free HTMs containing arylamine-substituted phthalocyanines, the methoxydiphenylamine-substituted copper phthalocyanine, OMe-DPA-CuPc, and the methoxy TPA-substituted copper phthalocyanine, OMe-TPA-CuPc (Fig. 53), were developed and prepared, guided by computational modeling. These compounds were prepared via a facile, cost-effective, two-step synthetic route and were subsequently used as HTMs for the fabrication of solution-processable single, and mixed ion PSCs with an n–i–p planar configuration. These compounds were both designed to be HTMs containing a highly stable MPc core with an extensive conjugated π-system, together with electron-rich TPA substituents in the peripheral positions of the Pc ring. Both compounds displayed excellent hole transfer properties and high thermal and good chemical stabilities. The highest PCE of 19.7% together with remarkably high stability was obtained for PSC devices containing Cs0.05(MA0.13FA0.87)0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 (MA: methylammonium; FA: formamidinium) as the light-absorbing material and OMe-TPA-CuPc as the dopant-free HTM that were measured under AM1.5G standard conditions, which matches the PCE achieved for the reference device containing doped spiro-OMeTAD (average PCE = 19.1%) (Fig. 54). The better performance of devices containing OMe-TPA-CuPc was attributed to its lower HOMO energy level, slower recombination rates, and more efficient hole transfer properties. Studies also revealed that, when compared to their doped spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, PSCs fabricated from substituted CuPcs are much more stable at room temperature under conditions of 75% humidity.

The PV data for dopant-free PSCs built from polymer structures containing TPA units are summarized in Table 7. The development of low-cost, stable, green-solvent processable PSCs containing side-chain polymers as HTMs with high mobilities is a new strategy currently being pursued in this field. Two novel HTMs containing side-chain polystyrene units and TPA substituents on a carbazole core have been successfully synthesized in a facile manner. The position of the TPA substituents on the carbazole unit was varied to afford two dopant-free HTMs, P1 with substituents at the 2,7-positions and P2 with substituents at the 3,6-positions. In this way, the π-conjugation of the HTMs could be chemically modified to finely adjust the energy levels of the frontier orbitals in these systems. Studies revealed that the dopant-free HTMs, P1 and P2, have suitable solubilities, excellent homogeneous film-forming capabilities, good energy levels, and high charge mobilities that render them favorable for use in n–i–p planar PSCs. The better performance was recorded for the P2 polymer, which had the higher PCE of 18.45% than 17.78% for P1. This is attributed to its higher mobility and greater ability to extract charge. The aging of devices fabricated from these two polymers under ambient conditions and exposed to 90% humidity in the dark for 30 days confirms their good stabilities. This study demonstrates that the development of low-cost, stable, green-solvent processable PSCs from side-chain polymer HTMs with good solution processability and high mobilities is a promising new synthetic strategy.

A better alternative to 3D PSCs is highly stable quasi-2D perovskites. In 2020, Yin et al. designed and synthesized a new non-conjugated polymer comprising a polyethylene backbone, poly[3,6-(4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamino)-9-vinyl-9H-carbazole], PVCz-OMeTPA, and studied it as a promising dopant-free HTM for inverted p–i–n planar quasi-2D PSCs. PVCz-OMeTPA shows good hole mobility and energy levels that are well-matched with quasi-2D perovskites. Furthermore, PVCz-OMeTPA also has an excellent thin film morphology and a small contact angle with the perovskite precursors, which aids in the formation of high-quality quasi-2D perovskite films (Fig. 55). Studies revealed that PVCz-OMeTPA-based quasi-2D PSCs afforded a maximum PCE of 17.22%, which is comparable with those of standard PTAA and PVCzOMeDAD devices. The devices maintained 82% of their maximum PCE for 1400 h under 40% humidity. Furthermore, more than 81% of the maximum PCE was observed for quasi-2D PSCs fabricated from PVCz-OMeTPA, without encapsulation, after aging at 70 °C for over 600 h.
Recently, three polycarbazole dopant-free HTMs were designed and synthesized with various linkages on their core carbazole groups, 3,6-PCzTPA, 2,7-PCzTPA, and 3,6-2,7-PCzTPA. In this study, 3,6-PCzTPA and 3,6-2,7-PCzTPA showed the highest hole mobilities due to the formation of radical cations on the nitrogen atoms of their carbazole units. As depicted in Fig. 56, the formation of a quinoidal structure by 2,7-PCzTPA allows the delocalization of charges and efficient migration in the polymer backbone. However, by carefully tuning the molecular structures, the quinoidal molecules 3,6-PCzTPA and 3,6-2,7-PCzTPA were employed. With these two systems, it was possible to produce conjugated discontinuities in the nitrogen atoms and cause conjugation breakage in the polymer backbone. Unfortunately, the mismatch of the HOMO level with the perovskite layer resulted in a relatively low Voc for 3,6-PCzTPA. 3,6-2,7-PCzTPA was therefore chosen as the best HTM for the fabrication of PSCs with the inverted p–i–n planar configuration. PV studies on this system revealed a best PCE of 18.4% in the absence of any dopants, demonstrating its usefulness as an ideal HTM for inverted PSCs.
Attaching carefully designed small molecules onto a polymer chain is also being employed for the construction of dopant-free HTMs, for the future development of highly efficient, stable PSCs. Following this strategy, the design and preparation of a new side-chain polymer were reported by merging a methoxy TPA-conjugated-thiophene moiety HTM with an HTM-P1 polystyrene sidechain via radical polymerization of the corresponding HTM-M1 monomer (Fig. 15d). These two compounds together with HTM2 as a similar model compound without the styrene component were applied in n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. Studies revealed that PSCs fabricated from the dopant-free HTM-P1 exhibited much higher PCE (17.2%) than those from HTM2 (3.2%) and HTM-M1 (9.5%). The higher hole mobility of HTM-P1 is attributed to its better performance, which is beneficial for charge transfer to the anode. Moreover, efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to the HTM is achieved due to the lower HOMO level of the HTM-P1, and its more efficient electron blocking ability is attributed to its higher LUMO. An important advantage of devices containing HTM-P1vs.HTM-M1 and HTM2 is their higher stabilities without encapsulation for 30 days in a relative humidity of 30%.
The photo-cross linkable HTM CL1-2 was also reported for PSC applications. In this study, a cross-linkable acrylate random co-polymer with both hole-transport bis(triarylamine) and photocross-linkable cinnamate side chains was employed as an HTM and compared to the widely used poly(4-butyl-triphenylamine-4′,4″-diyl) (polyTPD) in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. The initial studies of the resulting PSC devices were promising since it has a similar performance to polyTPD, but with superior thermal stability (85 °C) and improved UV photostability. The most important advantage of CL1-2 is that, unlike polyTBD, it does not require any doping, and there was great reproducibility in PV performance across several batches of devices. Furthermore, unlike polyTPD, CL1-2 is a transparent HTM in the visible region. These properties coupled with easy perovskite processing on top of CL1-2 demonstrate that it is a promising crosslinkable-polymeric HTM, for application in both single-junction and tandem solar cells.
The fabrication of efficient PSCs and other optoelectronic devices using polyamine electropolymerization is a simple and inexpensive method currently being pursued in this field. Following this strategy, efficient, stable inverted p–i–n planar PSCs have been successfully developed containing in situ electropolymerized polyamine films as dopant-free HTMs (Fig. 15e). Poly-1 films with network structures that are strongly hydrophobic in nature were formed via oxidative electropolymerization of the readily available star-shaped monomer 1 that contains a pyrene core and four TPA sidearms. The development of a device with an ITO/poly-1/(FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)(1−x)/PC61BM/BCP/Ag configuration yielded PCEs of 16.5% and an average PCE of 15.5%, which is higher than the control device containing PTAA as the HTM, without any dopant, measured under similar conditions. In this respect, steady-state and time-resolved PL studies revealed that the electropolymer film has superior hole extraction capabilities and good carrier transport properties. Due to the relationship between the thickness of the electropolymer film and the performance of the resulting PVs, after optimization, a value of ca. 50 nm was determined to be the ideal thickness of the HTM. The authors concluded that the molecular structure of the network and the strong hydrophobicity of the polymer films play key roles in retaining the stable performance of the resulting solar cell devices. In this respect, devices containing poly-1 as the HTM, in the absence of dopant, retained 91% of their initial performance under ambient conditions for 1000 hours, versus only 66% for devices containing PTAA.
The concept of using 2-D squaraine-based π-conjugated polymers has also been pursued in the successful development of an efficient p-type polymeric semiconductor, PASQ-IDT. This polymer has been used for several applications that include high-performance bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) and PSCs (Fig. 23e). Blending the polymer as a donor with a PC71BM acceptor with an optimal D/A weight ratio of 1:5 afforded a newly fabricated single-junction BHJ PSC, without any additives. This study using PASQ-IDT afforded a PCE of 6.35% with a high FF of 0.58, which is attributed to the more balanced charge transfer and the uniform penetration network of the BHJ layer. The narrow intense adsorption of this compound in the NIR region together with its acceptable PCE of more than 4% and an average visible transmittance (400–700 nm) of ∼28% rendered this compound also suitable for the fabrication of semitransparent PSCs. Thus, inverted p–i–n planar PSCs fabricated from PASQ-IDT without dopants show a very promising PCE of 18.29%, with a small hysteresis and good stability, which is far superior to the control devices containing PEDOT:PSS, which have a PCE of 16.14%. The authors also showed that PASQ-IDT not only is efficient at extracting and transferring holes, but also provides a very good surface for the precursor perovskite solution that ultimately supports the facile growth of high-quality perovskite films.
High-performance dopant-free HTMs with comprehensive passivation effects are well-suited for the development of all-inorganic PSCs. In this regard, squaraines (SQs) are natural passivation materials for perovskites and could be used as dopant-free HTMs. A novel design strategy has been reported, employing dopant-free HTMs with SQs as the structural platform. The relatively low hole mobility of SQs is an important limitation (Fig. 23f). In this study, the authors demonstrated that the best way to overcome this problem is to polymerize SQs, forming quasi-2-D p–π conjugated polymers. Applying this strategy, from the rational employment of N,N′-diarylanilinosquaraines as co-monomers, the resulting polysquaraine HTMs for use in n–i–p planar PSCs not only exhibit suitable energy levels and have efficient passivation effects on the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions of the perovskites but also have high hole mobilities of about 0.01 cm−2 V−1 s−1. In this study high-hole mobilities of 1.09 × 10−3 and 9.87 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were reported for PSQ1 and PSQ2, respectively, due to the insertion of N,N′-diarylanilinosquaraine units into the p–π conjugated polymers, which are amongst the highest mobilities ever reported for semiconductors containing SQs. Using these compounds as HTMs, the best PCE of 15.5% was obtained for dopant-free inorganic PSCs containing PSQ2, which is higher than the PCE of 14.4% obtained for doped spiro-OMeTAD.

To further highlight the advantages of TPA-based hole transport materials, the properties of a selection of the best TPA-based HTMs are briefly discussed below and compared to newly emerging HTMs such as black phosphorane.

Firstly, suitable energy levels, efficient passivation effects, and high hole mobilities of 1.09 × 10−3 and 9.87 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been reported by polymerizing squaraines (SQs) to afford pseudo-two-dimensional p–π conjugated polymers, PSQ1 and PSQ2, which are discussed in Section 3.3 of this review. Interestingly, these device parameters are higher than those obtained for the indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based polysquaraine (PASQ-IDT), which has a lower hole mobility of 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, the reported values for both compounds are very close to the mobility of 3.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 recorded for doped spiro-OMeTAD measured under the same conditions.
The two phthalocyanine based compounds OMe-DPA-CuPc and OMe-TPA-CuPc, presented in Section 3.7 of this review, when utilized as dopant-free HTMs show impressive hole mobilities of 1.55 × 10−3 and 6.39 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are much higher than the value of 1.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported for dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD, demonstrating their exciting promise in this field to date.
An excellent hole mobility of 5.10 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been reported for a naphtha[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene (NDT) thin film, which is much higher than the value of 9.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for its 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bis-thiophene (PBT) analogue and comparable to the mobility of 4.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 recorded for spiro-OMeTAD under similar conditions. As discussed in Section 2.3.6, the intrinsic molecular structures and layer-by-layer stacking geometries contribute to the excellent hole mobility and performance of NDT bridges in PSCs.
As presented in Section 2.5, a hole mobility value of 3.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for the organic, small molecule-based acridine film ACR-TPA by employing Li-TFSI and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP) additives, which is close to the value of 2.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for classic spiro-MeOTAD. It is also noteworthy that the HOMO level of this compound (−5.03 eV) is slightly lower than that of spiro-MeOTAD (−4.97 eV). Compounds containing triphenylamine electron-rich units and electron-deficient imidazole units are discussed in Section 2.8 of this review. In this respect, DNI and DPI are worth mentioning as two examples of D–A systems with significantly improved hole transport properties. A hole mobility of 3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been reported for DNI, which is four times higher than the value of 8.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported for its DPI counterpart. A PV device containing DNI as the organic HTM displays the best PCE of 20.3%, due to the significantly higher hole mobility of its more highly conjugated core.
As outlined in Section 2.6, the use of planar porphyrin cores has afforded HTMs with high hole mobilities and in turn PSCs with high efficiencies. In this respect, two Zn(II) complexes Y3 and Y4 with porphyrin cores have been developed and employed as HTMs for n–i–p mesoscopic PSCs. It is noteworthy that the conductivity of the more planar, conjugated molecule Y4 is remarkably higher than that of Y3.
As discussed in Section 2.5.2, an increased hole mobility of 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was reported for the sulfur-rich, organic HTM SMe-TATPyr. Interestingly, studies of this system revealed that the employment of an interfacial layer increased the PCE of SMe-TATPyr-treated perovskite solar cells from 20.4% to 22.3%.
Recently, a newly emerging class of two-dimensional nanomaterials consisting of a monolayer or multilayers of thick black phosphorus (BP) have been employed in the fields of electronics and optoelectronics due to their tunable optoelectronic properties and high carrier mobilities. Interestingly, a significantly higher PCE value of 19.8% has been reported for a BP dually-incorporated device, when compared to 16.9% for its counterpart containing no BP, or PCEs of 18.2% and 18.7% reported for devices containing BP, together with ETL/perovskite or perovskite/HTL interfaces. Theoretical calculations on BP predict values of 1100–1140 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a lateral, in-plane μe_i, ≈ 80 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a vertical, out-of-plane μe_o, 640–700 cm2 V−1 s−1 for μh_i and 10000–26000 cm2 V−1 s−1 for μh_o. The hole and electron mobilities for bulk BP at room temperature are 350 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 220 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which increase to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the compound is fabricated into thin nanosheets. The hole mobilities of spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PS, the most widely used HTLs, are less than ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are also significantly less than those of perovskite absorbers (e.g., 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MAPbI3).
A PCE value of 16.69% was reported for devices in which BPQD was inserted into the HTL/perovskite interface, which indicates a better performance when compared to a PCE of 14.10% for devices without BPQD. A PCE value of 20.49% was obtained for a device containing a BP:PTAA HTL, which indicates a much better performance, when compared to the PCE of 18.26% reported for the control device.
As presented in Section 2.3.6, low HOMO levels, higher mobility, better performances, and solar cells with enhanced stabilities are reported for devices fabricated from compounds containing a TPA donor and a benzothiadiazole (BT) or thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) acceptor, YN1 and YN2. The hole mobility values of YN1 and YN2 are 7.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Studies reveal that the hole-mobilities of YN1 and YN2 are five-fold higher than the value of 1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD, measured under the same conditions. Furthermore, the best PCE of 19.27% was obtained for devices containing YN2, which is significantly higher than the PCE of 17.80% recorded for devices containing spiro-OMeTAD.
As discussed in Section 2.1, more efficient hole transport and a reduced charge transport imbalance have been achieved in planar PSCs, resulting in a higher hole mobility of 8.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the star-shaped spiro-OMeTAD derivative TET, when directly compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, as outlined in Section 2.5.2, the better intermolecular π–π stacking and conjugated nature of the fused tetraphenylethylene compound F-TPE afforded a high hole mobility of 7.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when compared to 3.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for its non-fused TPE counterpart.
As presented in Section 2.5.1, good solubility, superior thermal stability, high hole mobility, and suitable energy levels render HPB-OMeDPA and HFB-OMeDPA HTMs suitable for device applications. In this respect, hole mobilities of 5.54 × 10−5 and 7.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 are reported for devices containing these two molecules, respectively, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD (8.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Interestingly an increase in hole mobility to 1.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for HFB-OMeDPA by light soaking.
As discussed in Section 3.4.2, for HTMs containing semi-locked tetrathienylethene (TTE) building blocks, the best hole mobility of 6.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for TTE-2. Furthermore, a highly efficient, stable device with a PCE of 20.04% was prepared using dopant-free PSCs containing TTE-2, properties that are attributed to its high hole mobility, its low HOMO energy level, and the superior quality of its thin-film.
As mentioned in Section 2.4, after optimization a PCE of 20.2% was recorded for devices fabricated from the phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (PDO) HTM PDO2. In this respect, PDO2 has a higher hole mobility of 5.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, when compared to 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for its PDO1 counterpart.
A value of 4.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for the hole mobility of the HTM poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) doped with Li-TFSI/t-BP, which is an order of magnitude higher than the hole mobility of 7.47 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 recorded for the dopant-free PTAA. Furthermore, PTAA doped with 5% LAD showed a mobility of 5.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Studies revealed that the efficient hole transport and extraction properties together with improved hole mobilities for PSCs fabricated from PTA doped with 5% LAD afforded an increase in the total efficiency of the devices, resulting in PCEs of up to 19.01%.
As mentioned in Section 2.3.5, among HTMs containing fused thiophenes, Z1 to Z3, doped thin films containing Z1 display an average hole mobility of 4.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost double that reported for spiro-OMeTAD (1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and its Z3 counterpart (2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher hole mobility of Z1 is attributed to the semi-crystalline properties of its solution-processed thin film. An excellent PCE of 20.84% was achieved for PSCs containing the Z1 molecular semiconductor in light of its optimally aligned HOMO energy level and high-thin film mobility, which is slightly higher than the PCE of 20.42% reported for spiro-OMeTAD, measured under the same conditions.
As mentioned in Section 2.2, for PSCs built from linear structures containing a TPA end group, HTM-1 showed a much higher mobility of 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher thermal stability and better moisture stability when compared to the gold standard, spiro-MeOTAD. Furthermore, PSCs containing HTM-1 are reported to have an excellent PCE of 21.0%.
As described in Section 3.3.3, for compounds with fused thiophene derivatives, a high mobility of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for DTP-C6Thvs. 3.43 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the benchmark, spiro-OMeTAD. It is also noteworthy here that PSCs containing dopant free DTP-C6Th HTM exhibited a champion PCE of 21.04%.
As discussed in Section 3.3.2, for a neat film comprising the D–A-type SM-HTM, MPA-BTI, containing a phenylamine donor and an imide-functionalized thiophene acceptor group (2,8-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-octyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-c:2′,3′-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione), has a hole mobility of 3.99 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is close to 2.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 recorded for spiro-OMeTAD, measured under the same conditions. In contrast, the more amorphous compound 2,8-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-dodecyl-4H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-c]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (MPA-BTTI) displays a much higher hole mobility of 2.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As expected, a significant PCE of 21.17% was obtained for efficient inverted PVSCs containing dopant-free MPA-BTTI, which also exhibit low hysteresis, excellent thermal stability, and very good long-term stability under illumination.
As presented in Section 2.4, PSCs assembled from polymer structures containing TPA units include CH3O-PTAA that exhibits a high PCE of 21.00%, which is very close to the PCE of 21.16% recorded for its CH3-PTAA counterpart. In this study the hole mobilities of CH3-PTAA and CH3O-PTAA films were also found to be very similar – 4.38 × 10−5 and 5.59 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
A PCE of 21.03% was obtained for the dopant-free TQ4 based-devices previously discussed in Section 3.3.3, which also have superior long-term stabilities. The hole mobility of 2.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for thin films containing TQ4 thin films was reported to be 2 fold higher than that of their TQ3 counterpart attributed to the nature of its planar π-extended quinoxaline core.
As discussed in Section 2.5.2, in the case of the 2-D π-conjugated and star-shaped HTM molecule OMe-TATPyr, the phenyl-thiophene unit was employed to increase the degree of charge delocalization and mobility. In this respect, mixed-cation PSCs containing OMe-TATPyr showed a high PCE of 20.6% and good stabilities. A hole mobility of 2.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for OMeTATPyr, which is approximately twice as high as the mobility of 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 recorded for spiro-OMeTAD, under the same conditions.
As presented in Section 2.3.5, PSC devices containing DTPC13-ThTPA as the dopant-free HTM exhibited a PCE of 20.38%. The hole mobility of this HTM was reported to be 2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of the benchmark, spiro-OMeTAD (3.43 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), measured under the same conditions.
In the case of perovskite solar cells containing EDOT-amide-TPA, a PCE of 20.3% was obtained, which was a slight improvement compared with the PCE of 19.7% reported for spiro-OMeTAD, measured under the same conditions. Furthermore, the addition of Li-TFSI to the HTM resulted in a significant enhancement in its mobility to 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is attributed to the reduction in barrier height for the charge hopping.
As discussed in Section 2.3.1, for the utilization of molecules with thiophene cores, a PCE of 20.1% was obtained for devices containing Z26, which is close to a value of 20.6% for spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, mobilities of 7.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were reported for Z25, Z26 and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively.
As presented in Section 2.5.2 two three-dimensional symmetric tetraphenyl butadiene derivatives, CJ-03 and CJ-04, containing diphenylamine or TPA substituents were synthesized and subsequently employed in devices. The cell containing CJ-03 had a PCE of 20.06%, which is higher than 13.75% for its counterpart, CJ-04, and 18.90% for the gold standard, spiro-OMeTAD. The mobility values of 6.47 × 10−5, 9.66 × 10−5, and 9.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were reported for CJ-03, CJ-04, and dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD, respectively.
As outlined in Section 2.3.4, using the TPA-based small molecule N,N′-bis-(1-naphthalenyl)-N,N′-bis-phenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB) as an HTL, a maximum efficiency of 19.96% was obtained when compared to devices containing PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. In this case of the former compound, the easy and efficient hole extraction and transport from the perovskites are attributed to its high hole mobility, which is reported to be 6.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.

The development of new small molecule/polymer HTMs is important for the realization of the next generation of high-performance PSCs. To date, state-of-the-art PSCs employ spiro-OMeTAD or TPA HTMs. During the development of these systems, dopants are typically used to improve the hole mobility and conductivity, which in turn leads to device degradation due to the oxidation process associated with undesired ion migration and chemical interaction with the underlying perovskite layer. The current challenge at the forefront of this field is to develop dopant-free HTMs with similar performances to the gold standards. Consequently, interdisciplinary research efforts concerning the development of TPA-based HTMs have significantly increased over the past decade, resulting in an exponential increase in PCEs reported for this family of PSCs. As highlighted in this review, TPA is a versatile HTM for solar cell applications considering its outstanding properties that include its (i) facile chemical modification, (ii) synthetically easy extension of its π system, (iii) strong electron-donating properties, and (iv) high hole transport abilities. Considering the relationship between the molecular structures of TPA compounds and the optimized PV parameters of the resulting solar cells, it is clear that the following factors are of prime importance: (i) the nature and number of electron-donating/withdrawing substituents on the TPA framework; (ii) the length of the π-conjugated linker(s) and/or spacer(s); (iii) the simple bromination of one, two or three rings of the TPA and their subsequent substitution with other π-conjugated systems; (iv) the molecular structure (planarity) and strength of the molecular interactions of the TPA molecules in the solid-state; (v) the energy match of their HOMO to the perovskite layer; and (vi) surface passivation. In this respect, chemical modification of the TPA molecules allows the optical and electrical properties of the HTMs to be tuned in a rational manner to ensure more efficient packing and hole mobility, as well as to optimize the interactions at the interface between the HTM and the perovskite layer.

Despite recent efforts, the PCEs of dopant-free HTMs still lag behind their doped counterparts, and their thermal and light stabilities need to be further optimized for commercial applications. In the future the molecular design concepts described in this review will be essential for the discovery of next generation, small molecule TPA-based HTMs with high conductivities, excellent hole transfer mobilities, and energy levels that can be optimized to perfectly match the perovskite layer. Furthermore, to develop more cost-effective PSCs, it is important to optimize the PCE/total cost ratio by using inexpensive starting materials, avoiding the use of costly catalysts, and reducing the number of synthetic steps and purification procedures. With respect to the practical employment of these compounds in devices for large-scale production, solution processability and consistency with different solvents, as well the facial thin film layer deposition of the TPA derivatives, are also important considerations.
To summarise, we have presented a comprehensive overview of the rational design and applications of TPA compounds as HTMs for PSCs, from the original seminal work to the most recent developments in the field. Although hundreds of TPA derivatives have been reported to date and marked improvements in the PCEs and device stability have been achieved, several key challenges remain. In this respect, it is not yet clear if dopant-free TPA PSCs will be durable enough to work under extreme conditions that include rain, wind, heat, and freezing temperatures. Hence it is not clear if they will be competitive with the 25 years’ warranty that silicon panels currently promise, or if their efficiency recorded in the laboratory will translate to the commercial scale. For researchers aiming to develop next-generation TPA HTMs, efforts should focus on targeting the facile, cost-effective synthesis of small molecules that contain several of the best design concepts presented in this review. If such devices can be developed, time will tell if they have the efficiencies to significantly reduce the costs of generating solar energy when compared to their silicon rivals, and/or if their lightweight nature will lend them to niche commercial applications such as flexible solar cells.
