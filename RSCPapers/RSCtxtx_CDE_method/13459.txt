We demonstrate the application of a low-temperature carbon counter electrode with good flexibility and high conductivity in fabricating perovskite solar cells. A modified two-step method was used for the deposition of nanocrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 under high relative humidity. The carbon counter electrode was printed on a perovskite layer directly, with different sizes of graphite powder being employed. The interfacial charge transfer and transport in solar cells were investigated through photoluminescence and impedance measurements. We find that the existence of nano-graphite powder in the electrode has a noticeable influence on the back contact and cell performance. The prepared devices of hole-conductor-free perovskite heterojunction solar cells without encapsulation exhibit advantageous stability in air in the dark, with the optimal power conversion efficiency reaching 6.88%. This carbon counter electrode has the features of low-cost and low-temperature preparation, giving it potential for application in the large-scale flexible fabrication of perovskite solar cells in the future.

The global energy demand has been continually increasing with industrial development and population growth, especially the demand for conventional energy resources such as fossil oil, coal, natural gas, etc. Due to excessive exploitation by human beings, these energy sources are on the edge of exhaustion. Perovskite solar cells, due to their excellent properties of spectral absorption and carrier transportation, have caught people's attention since they were proposed for the first time in 2009. In the last five years, perovskite solar cells have achieved a tremendous improvement in photo-current conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 20.1% by using Spiro-MeOTAD or poly-triarylamine polymers as the hole conductor, which is comparable to the PCE of commercial silicon solar cells. More importantly, nanocrystalline perovskite as a core photoelectric conversion material, which can be obtained by solution methods, is cheaper compared to traditional organic solar cells, making it possible for large-scale fabrication of solar cells. However, the use of hole transfer materials (HTMs) bears a large proportion of the cost for such solar cells, limiting their application in low-cost photovoltaic devices. Recently, investigations on using nanocrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as both light harvester and hole conductor have been reported, implying great potential to bring down the cost of energy production. In the fabrication process of perovskite solar cells, a noble metal such as Au with a work function of −5.1 eV is used for the counter electrode (CE), usually prepared by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions. The high-cost metallic CE and the high energy-consuming evaporation process may hinder industrialization of these solar cells to a large extent. Carbon, with a similar work function (−5.0 eV), which is abundant on the earth, can be used as the CE of solar cells. Han et al. prepared HTM-free solar cells and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 12.8%, with the CEs screen printed on the photoanodes by a kind of special carbon slurry composed of carbon black, graphite and ZrO2 at a mass ratio of 1:3:1. The carbon CEs need a high temperature of 400 °C to volatilize the organic solvent, which will limit their application on plastic substrates for flexible devices. Wong and Mhaisalkar et al. proposed a semi-transparent carbon nanotube (CNT) film as the CE for perovskite solar cells. In the absence of an organic hole transfer material and metal contact, CH3NH3PbI3 and CNTs formed solar cells with an efficiency up to 6.87%. The fabrication of high quality CNT films is still challenging. Ma et al. tried remoulding a commercial conductive carbon paste to make it available for the fabrication process of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells. Their cells had a PCE above 9% and exhibited advantageous stability in air. In addition, Meng et al. presented a carbon counter electrode fabricated by a two-step process under low-temperature conditions. The final PCE of their solar cells reached 10.2% with an optimal counter electrode with a composition of graphite and carbon black. Nevertheless, the preparation of carbon CEs needs to be simplified to cater for large-scale industrial fabrication of perovskite solar cells.

In this work, we introduce a novel kind of low-temperature carbon CE for hole-conductor-free perovskite heterojunction solar cells prepared under high relative humidity, where the CE has a small sheet resistance and retains good contact with the substrate. The morphology and structure for the mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon CE heterostructure were examined, and the current–voltage characteristics and monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) were also tested to analyze the performance of the solar cells. We find that the size of the graphite powder has a significant influence on the back contact and performance of the solar cells. This carbon CE has the features of low-cost and low-temperature preparation, giving it potential for application in the large-scale fabrication of flexible perovskite solar cells in the future.

As shown in Fig. 1(a), a TiO2 layer is used for the transmission and collection of photo-generated electrons in the sandwich structure of the hole-conductor-free perovskite heterojunction solar cells. When the device is irradiated, an electron is easily excited from the valence band to the conduction band of the absorber because of a low exciton binding energy (∼0.5 eV), and then an exciton is generated. Exciton separation is achieved by the injection of an electron into the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.0 eV) and a hole into the valence band of the carbon CE (−5.0 eV). Here, the nanocrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 functions as the light harvester and hole transport material at the same time. The fabrication procedure of our perovskite solar cells with a carbon CE is shown in Fig. 1(b). A TiO2 compact layer is deposited on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate for collection of photo-generated electrons, and a mesoscopic TiO2 layer is used as the scaffold for the perovskite light-sensitive material. The deposition of nanocrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 is conducted by a modified two-step method. We pre-heat the substrates at a temperature of 50 °C before spin-coating PbI2, which is helpful to obtain a more uniform perovskite layer. Finally, carbon slurries mixed with ethyl acetate, graphite and carbon black are directly printed onto the perovskite layer to form carbon CEs. Fig. 1(c) illustrates the flexibility of the carbon film and Fig. 1(d) displays an optical image of our solar cells.

We obtain four types of carbon film (A, B, C and D), which contained 67% carbon material (graphite and carbon black) and 33% binders and ZrO2. Carbon film mixed with graphite flakes (10 μm) and carbon black powder (40 nm) at a weight ratio of about 3:1 is defined as A. Due to the large size of the graphite flakes, usually there are some undulations at the contact interface between the carbon film and substrate, which may lead to poor contact between the graphite flakes and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. Smaller graphite particles can fill the gaps among the graphite flakes. In order to improve the contact at the interface, we mixed graphite flakes (10 μm), carbon black powder (40 nm) and nano-graphite powder (400 nm) at a weight ratio of about 1:1:2, and defined it as B. In carbon film C, we replaced 400 nm graphite powder with 40 nm graphite powder. To further study the influence of the nano-graphite powder, we prepared carbon film D, which was mixed with graphite flakes (10 μm), carbon black powder (40 nm) and nano-graphite powder (40 nm) at a weight ratio of about 1:2:5. Due to the low boiling point of the ethyl acetate, the carbon film can be obtained at a very low drying temperature. What's more, the carbon film is suitable for numerous kinds of substrates, such as glass, polyethylene terephthalate, and metal foil, which gives it potential for large-scale manufacture of flexible devices.
A four-point probe resistivity measurement system was employed to measure the sheet resistance of the carbon films. The results are shown in Table 1. The sheet resistances of carbon films A, B, C and D are 17, 70, 110 and 170 Ω □−1, respectively. Carbon films that contain more graphite flakes, which can provide a major pathway for charge transportation, exhibit better conductivity. The differences in the conductivity of these four carbon films are probably caused by the different densities of the interfaces between the carbon flakes. For the carbon films with smaller particle-size graphite powder, there are more interfaces between each graphite particle and the graphite flakes, contributing to higher sheet resistance.

The humidity conditions have a great effect on the quality of perovskite films. It is a great challenge to obtain a smooth and uniform perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film under high humidity. As mentioned in a previous report, the substrate temperature was found to play a predominant role in determining the crystallinity and the surface coverage of the perovskite. By pre-heating the substrates at 50 °C before spinning PbI2·DMF solution, we can obtain a relatively complete perovskite surface with few pinholes, as displayed in Fig. 2(a) and S1, which is crucial to avoid direct contact between the carbon film and TiO2. The grain size of the perovskite crystallites is around 1 μm, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The highly roughened interface will strengthen internal light scattering, and the large crystallites and interface area will also be beneficial for charge transport.Fig. 2(c) shows the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the perovskite layer, including every possible chemical element in every layer. The carbon film exhibits a mesoporous structure with a thickness of 65 μm, as can be seen in Fig. 2(d). Fig. 2(e–f) clearly show the morphology of every layer under a higher magnification. The thicknesses of the FTO layer, the compact TiO2 layer, the mesoscopic TiO2 layer, the perovskite capping layer and the carbon layer are 500 nm, 40 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm and 65 μm, respectively. The inset in Fig. 2(f) shows the unsatisfactory interfacial contact in film A, due to a large number of gaps among the graphite flakes. The introduction of nano-graphite powder will make the carbon film more compact and improve the interfacial contact, as can be seen in Fig. 2(f). This is probably because the smaller graphite particles can provide a greater number of contact sites. Besides, an over-thin layer of the carbon CE may also decrease the fill factor (FF) of the devices owing to the lack of conductivity, while an over-thick layer of the carbon CE may increase the transmission distance for carriers. More details can be found in Fig. S2.

Fig. 3 displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of every layer in the solar cell. Excluding some diffraction peaks of FTO, we find one additional diffraction peak at 25.28, which belongs to the (101) lattice plane of the mesoporous TiO2 anatase film. During the reaction between CH3NH3I and PbI2, we observe the disappearance of a series of diffraction peaks at 12.64(001), 39.6(110) and 41.75(111) from PbI2. After that, the CH3NH3PbI3 film gives strong diffraction peaks at 14.01, 19.94, 23.44, 24.46, 28.38, 31.80, 40.46 and 43.06, which can be assigned to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure. It is obvious that the main peak of PbI2 has disappeared through the transformation to CH3NH3PbI3. Apart from some peaks introduced by FTO and TiO2, the final perovskite absorber is well crystallized.

Fig. 4a shows the absorption spectra of the perovskite film. After decoration by the nanocrystalline CH3NH3PbI3, the devices show good light-harvesting capabilities over the visible to near-IR spectrum, which greatly enhance the optical absorptivity of the TiO2 mesoscopic film. Note that an absorbance of ∼1 in the figure corresponds to ∼90% light absorption.
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching is often used to demonstrate the charge extraction ability of hole-conducting materials in contact with perovskite. As shown in Fig. 4(b), strong luminescence occurs at ∼770 nm for the PL of CH3NH3PbI3 on a glass substrate, and is suppressed with the existence of the carbon film, indicating the effective charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to the carbon film. The curves of our measurement are in good agreement with the reported results, highlighting the role of the hole acceptor for the carbon film. In fact, according to the band edge positions of TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3, and carbon, the heterojunction can provide a significant driving force (the effect of built-in potential) for hole injection from the perovskite layer, collecting and transporting holes to the external circuit.
The J–V characteristics of the HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells with different carbon CEs are evaluated as shown in Fig. 5(a). The detailed photovoltaic properties are given in Table 2. Furthermore, the IPCE spectrum vs. the wavelength of incident light is plotted in Fig. 5(b), confirming the difference in JSC. Fig. 5(c)–(f) are box charts, exhibiting the statistical features of the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), FF and PCE of all of the cells with different types of carbon CEs. These cells, prepared using carbon film A without any nano-graphite powder, have a VOC of 0.796, a JSC of 13.0, and a FF of 0.43, leading to a relatively poor performance (an average PCE of 4.47%). For carbon film B, the cell performances are significantly enhanced when the small-sized nano-graphite powder is introduced. The JSC is increased from 13.0 to 14.9, and the VOC is improved to 0.82, yielding a 5.31% PCE. After we replace 400 nm nano-graphite powder with 40 nm nano-graphite powder at the same weight ratio in carbon film C, the average JSC of the solar cells is improved to 16.87, and the highest PCE (6.88%) is achieved. However, with increasing 40 nm nano-graphite powder content (carbon film D), even though the VOC reaches a higher level (0.87 V), a worse cell performance (3.84% of PCE) is observed due to the dramatic decline of JSC and FF. These results show that the solar cells with carbon films containing smaller-sized nano-graphite powder exhibit much better photovoltaic performance compared to the cells prepared using the carbon films only consisting of large graphite flakes. Nevertheless, too much nano-graphite powder will have a negative effect on the electrical performance of the carbon films, which may lead to higher resistance and stronger recombination. As a matter of fact, all of the devices show relatively low FFs. This is probably related to the porous structure of the carbon films and the ununiform coverage of the perovskite film. A more condensed carbon film and a more uniform perovskite film may help in achieving an improved performance.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes in the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon solar cells. EIS was carried out under dark conditions at the desired applied bias in the frequency range from 1 to 106 Hz. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(b–c) display the Nyquist plots of one CH3NH3PbI3/carbon solar cell at a bias of 0.7–0.9 V. Here, the Nyquist plot is composed of two irregular arcs, namely, a small arc at high frequency and a large arc at low frequency. The small arc is usually attributed to the resistance (RCE) of hole transport in carbon and the charge transfer at the interface of carbon and perovskite. The large arc is derived from the charge-transfer resistance (RREC) between mesoscopic TiO2 and the perovskite layer, reflecting the resistance of charge recombination. In addition, the starting point in the real part of the Nyquist plot corresponds to the series resistance (RS). The performance of the solar cells is a result of the synergistic effect caused by all of these parameters. Fig. 6(d) shows the relationship of RS with the bias. Benefiting from the lower sheet resistance, the cells prepared using carbon film A have the lowest RS. The variation trends of RCE and RREC are revealed in Fig. 6(e) and (f). It is found that the solar cells with carbon films B and C exhibit relatively lower RCE at a given bias, indicating a more efficient charge transfer process at the carbon CEs. We also observe that the solar cells with carbon films C and D present a relatively higher charge recombination resistance. Considering the low recombination rate, it is reasonable that the solar cells with carbon film C and D show a higher VOC than those of other cells. After balancing the impacts of RS, RCE and RREC, the solar cells using carbon film C as CE exhibit the best photon-to-electron conversion performance.

Fig. 7 shows the long-term stability test results of the HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. The solar cells are stored in air at room temperature without any encapsulation. The test is performed on one solar cell with an initial efficiency of 6.21% for over 2000 h. The specific photovoltaic parameters of the solar cell are listed in Table S1. The VOC shows a slow decline from 0.87 V to 0.83 V. The JSC shows a gradual increase over the first 300 h, and then begins to decrease after that, remaining relatively stable for about 1000 h. The increase of the JSC may stem from the partial recrystallization of the perovskite, which will reach a critical point 300 h later, whereas the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 will lead to the decline of VOC and JSC if exposing the cell to ambient air for too long. The FF remains relatively stable over the entire testing period. Benefiting from the increment in JSC, the PCE of the solar cell reaches 6.8% after 400 h, and remains relatively stable at ∼1300 h. Along with the reduction of the photo-electric conversion ability, the PCE reaches a low point below 3.72% after 2000 h. The aged solar cells are displayed in Fig. 8, where the yellow area represents the degradation of the perovskite film. The carbon film can act as a protective layer to isolate the perovskite layer from water in air which would retard the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3, indicating the outstanding stability of our solar cells.

In summary, we have successfully developed a kind of conductive carbon paste and applied it to fabrication of hole-conductor-free perovskite heterojunction solar cells. A carbon film with excellent flexibility and conductivity can be prepared by a simple and low-temperature process. A modified two-step process is employed to obtain a more uniform CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The carbon film components have a noticeable influence on the back contact and cell performance. The perovskite solar cells with a CE consisting of graphite flakes and 40 nm graphite powder at a weight ratio of 1:2 demonstrate promising efficiency of up to 6.88% and excellent stability over 1300 h. More importantly, our research opens up new avenues for developing low-cost and highly efficient flexible perovskite solar cells in the future.


Carbon pastes with different weight ratios of graphite flakes, nano-graphite powder and carbon black were prepared. The total weight ratio of the carbon materials was 67%, where polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), occupying 17% of the total mass, acted as the binder in the carbon film. Hydroxypropyl cellulose, which accounted for 8% of the total mass, was added to the carbon film to adjust the viscosity of the carbon paste. The remaining 8% of the mass was nanocrystalline ZrO2 with a particle size below 50 nm, which was introduced to enhance the scratch resistance performance of the carbon film. The blended carbon powder was dispersed into an ethyl acetate solution of PVAc and hydroxypropyl cellulose, followed by vigorously milling for 2 h in an electromill (QM-QX0.4, Instrument Factory of Nanjing University).


Conductive FTO glasses with high transparency in the visible range were cut into small pieces of 12.5 mm × 25 mm and etched with dilute hydrochloric acid (2 mol L−1) and zinc powder. The FTO substrates were then ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol for 10 min, and rinsed with deionized (DI) water. After treatment with UV-ozone for 30 min, a hole-blocking layer of compact TiO2 was deposited by spin-coating a precursor solution (titanium isopropoxide, TTIP, 99.9%, Aldrich) in anhydrous ethanol (0.254 mol L−1) with the addition of 0.02 mol L−1 HCl, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. Spin-coating was carried out at 5000 rpm for 60 s. After cooling down to room temperature, a mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 20 nm-sized particles was deposited by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (DSL. 18NR-T, 20 nm, Dyesol, Australia) diluted in ethanol (2:7, weight ratio). After drying at 125 °C, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 °C, baked for 30 min and cooled to room temperature.

The deposition of the lead halide iodide perovskite on mesoporous TiO2 was based on a conventional two-step method (spinning and dipping) with several modifications to assist in controlling the lead halide iodide perovskite deposition on the mesoporous TiO2. PbI2 solution was prepared by dissolving 553.2 mg (1.2 mol L−1) PbI2 (99%, Aldrich) in 1 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Aldrich) at 60 °C. 30 μl of PbI2 solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 45 s on the mesoporous TiO2 film, which was pre-heated at 50 °C on a hot plate. After coating, the film was dried at 70 °C for 5 min. To convert the PbI2 layer to CH3NH3PbI3, the film was dipped into 2-propanol for 1–2 s before being dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 15 min and then rinsing with 2-propanol. The films changed color from yellow to black during the dipping process, indicating the formation of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. Finally, a 65 μm carbon counter electrode was printed directly on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer by the doctor blade method. All of the above procedures were conducted in ambient air with a humidity around 50%.

The thickness of the carbon CE films was measured by a profiler (Alpha-StepD-120, KLA-tencor). The resistance of the carbon films was measured by a four-point probe resistivity measurement system (Four Probes Tech, Guangzhou, China, RTS-8). The morphology of the perovskite surface and the cross-sectional structure of the solar cells were monitored by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL). The formation of the perovskite absorber layer has been further confirmed by XRD analysis (PANalytical PW3040/60) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) from 10° to 60°. The CH3NH3PbI3 was dip-coated on a mesoscopic TiO2 layer with FTO. A UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV 2600, Shimadzu) was utilized to obtain the absorption spectra of the perovskite solar cells. Raman and photoluminescence measurements were taken using a spectrometer (LabRAM HR800, Horiba JobinYvon) under an excitation laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance generated by a solar simulator (Oriel 94043A, Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). A black metal mask with a circular aperture (0.125 cm2) smaller than the active area of the square solar cell (1 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. The IPCE was tested under illumination of monochromatic light from a xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator (TLS1509, Zolix). In order to investigate the stability of the solar cells when stored in air without any encapsulation (temperature ∼20 °C, humidity ∼20%), a long-term stability test was carried out on one low-temperature carbon CE perovskite solar cell with an initial efficiency of 6.21% for over 2000 h. EIS of the solar cells was performed on an electrochemical workstation in the dark with the frequency ranging from 1 to 106 Hz.
