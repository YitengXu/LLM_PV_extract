Porous silicon (PSi) is an attractive building block for photonic devices, such as solar cells and photodetectors, due to its high surface to volume ratio, low reflection and high optical gain. In this work, PSi is prepared based on metal-assisted chemical etching by varying the deposition time (td) of Ag or Au nanoparticles (NPs) for the etching of Si from 1 to 7 s, thereby controlling the porosity of PSi. The co-doping of graphene with Au NPs and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide [(CF3SO2)2NH] is employed for the first time to enhance the performance of graphene/PSi Schottky-junction solar cells. Co-doping is proven to be very effective for increasing the work function of graphene as well as its electrical conductivity, resulting in efficient separation and collection of photo-induced electron–hole pairs in solar cells. The co-doped graphene/PSi solar cells show a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.69% at td = 5 s, and lose only 5% of the original PCE value after 15 days in air. These results provide a new route for fabricating highly efficient and stable graphene/PSi junction solar cells.

Silicon (Si) has a high absorption coefficient in a wide range from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR), useful for harvesting sunlight, and an excellent material quality and extensive technical understanding are further advantages for achieving a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) from Si-based solar cells. Si solar cells are currently a major cause of the rapid increase in the world photovoltaic market because of the abundance of the raw material and its low toxicity, low cost and simple cell and module manufacturing process. This trend is expected to continue in the future. However, Si has a high refractive index (∼3.5) that interferes with the absorption of sunlight, thereby limiting the efficient production of electron–hole pairs, which makes it necessary to lower the reflectance to enhance the PCE of Si solar cells. Recently, porous silicon (PSi) has been employed in solar cells because PSi has several benefits for photovoltaic applications, such as an efficient antireflection (AR) effect, a wide optical absorption/transmission range and surface passivation/texture effects. The high AR effect of PSi fundamentally originates from its high porosity because PSi can absorb light more effectively than bulk silicon by converting high-energy solar radiation into low-energy solar radiation.

Graphene/semiconductor Schottky junctions have been intensively studied for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices because graphene is a promising two-dimensional transparent conductive electrode (TCE). Very recently, graphene/PSi Schottky junctions have been fabricated for solar cell structures based on PSi, prepared by colloidal Ag nanoparticle (NP)-assisted chemical etching, but the PCE was low despite the doping of graphene TCEs with Ag nanowires. Here, we employ Au NPs as well as Ag NPs for the etching of Si, grown by sputtering for a uniform distribution, and control the deposition time (td) to optimize the porosity of PSi for enhancing the PCE of graphene/PSi solar cells. We also use the approach of co-doping graphene with Au NPs and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide [(CF3SO2)2 NH] (TFSA), both of which are commonly known as p-type dopants of graphene, to improve the electrical properties of the graphene TCEs, thereby achieving a maximum PCE of 10.69% with an active area of 9 mm2. The performance of the graphene/PSi solar cells is discussed based on systematic studies on their structural, electrical and optical properties.

Single layer graphene films were grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under the flow of a gas mixture of CH4 and H2 on Cu foil at 1000 °C, and subsequently transferred onto PSi/Si, Si and quartz substrates based on a conventional transfer method. TFSA powder was dissolved in nitromethane to prepare a TFSA solution. For the doping of graphene, the solution was dropped onto the whole surface of the graphene film, and after 1 min had elapsed, it was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 1 min.


N-Type (100) Si wafers of 5 ohm cm resistivity were used as substrates. For the fabrication of PSi, Ag or Au NPs as a catalyst for metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) were firstly deposited on the Si surface by sputtering. Immediately, each Si substrate with Ag or Au NPs was immersed in a mixed etchant of HF and H2O2 ([HF]:[H2O2] = 1:1) for 5 s at room temperature. During this process, the part of the Si attached to the Ag or Au NPs was selectively etched down, thereby generating pores on the Si surface. The porosity of Si was controlled by varying td of the Ag or Au NPs from 1 to 7 s. Finally, the remnant Ag or Au NPs were removed using aqua regia for several seconds.


A thin Au layer of 5 nm thickness was deposited on graphene by radio frequency sputtering, then annealed under nitrogen flow at 400 °C for 20 min to achieve a Au NP-doped graphene/PSi/Si Schottky solar cell. Sequentially, a solution of TFSA was dropped and spin-coated on the Au NP/graphene surface and annealed at 100 °C for 1 min to make the graphene uniformly doped (Fig, S1, ESI). The annealing temperature was optimized through repeated experiments for good quality doped graphene. Finally, Au and InGa films were deposited on the top of the graphene and the bottom of the Si substrate, as the top and bottom electrodes, to complete the device structures of the graphene/PSi/Si wafer solar cells. The molar concentration of TFSA (nD) was fixed at 20 mM. The illumination areas were 9, 14 and 30 mm2, respectively.


The surface morphologies of PSi and graphene/PSi were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The atomic bonding states of the Au NP/TFSA-doped graphene were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Al Kα line of 1486.6 eV. The film resistance, transmittance and work functions of graphene and TFSA-doped graphene were measured by the 4 probe van der Pauw method, UV-visible-NIR optical spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the Si solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) in air. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured under short circuit conditions while the cells were illuminated by a light source system with a monochromator.



Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic diagram of a typical graphene/PSi Schottky-junction solar cell on an n-type Si wafer, where the graphene is pristine or doped single layer (for the fabrication details, see Fig. S1, ESI). The high porosity of the PSi was confirmed by SEM images at various td values (Fig. S2, ESI). The pore depths were estimated to be ∼68 and ∼65 nm for the Ag and Au NPs, respectively, by cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S3, ESI). The CVD-grown graphene was transferred onto the PSi/Si substrates as well as onto the bare Si wafer. The SEM image also confirmed clear separation between the graphene-covered and uncovered regions on the PSi surface (Fig. S3, ESI). Fig. 1(b) shows the energy band diagram of the graphene/PSi/n-Si junction. We assume that the Fermi level of the PSi is located approximately at the center of the bandgap, regardless of the doping level of the starting Si wafer, based on the fact that the pores are formed predominantly at the sites of Si defects and dopants during MacEtch, resulting in the significant reduction of the doping concentration. The bandgap energy of the PSi is larger than that of the Si wafer due to the quantum confinement effect of Si nanostructures.


Fig. 1(c) shows typical photo J–V curves of the undoped graphene/PSi solar cells with various td values using Au NPs (see Fig. S4a, ESI for the photo J–V curves of the solar cells using Ag NPs). All of the photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves using Au NPs are summarized as functions of td in Table 1 (see Table S1, ESI for Ag NPs). For both types of NP, the PCE gradually increases with an increase in td from 1 to 5 s due to the decrease in reflectance, as shown in Fig. 1(d) (see Fig. S4b, ESI for Ag NPs), but is slightly reduced at td = 7 s, possibly resulting from the large trap density and low mobility caused by the high porosity of the PSi, despite the continued decrease in reflectance. These results are consistent with the td-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 1(e) (see Fig. S4c, ESI for Ag NPs). The variation of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), obtained by the integration of the EQE spectra as a function of td, is similar to that of the experimental Jsc value, as shown in Table 1 (see Table S1, ESI for Ag NPs), resulting from the strong correlation between Jsc and the EQE. The optimal photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, fill factor (FF) and PCE) for the best device, using Au NPs with td = 5 s, are 0.367 V, 21.69 mA cm−2, 44.21% and 3.52%, respectively (see Table S1, ESI for Ag NPs).

Despite the variation of the surface conditions by the etching process, the graphene/PSi cell exhibits a higher efficiency compared to the graphene/Si cell (td = 0 s). To clarify this behavior, we measured the transient photocurrent (PC) of the PSi (td = 5 s) and the Si solar cells (Fig. S5, ESI). The rise and decay of the PC in the PSi cell are faster than those in the Si cell. The rise time is the time required for carriers to be generated in the PSi region and swept out as a drift current proportional to the built-in electric field in the graphene/PSi/n-Si structure. In contrast, the decay time is the lifetime of the carriers. So, the decay time/rise time ratio is a parameter (gain) for evaluating the carrier collection efficiency in the solar cells. The rise/decay times are 1.76/17.65 and 4.95/36.55 μs, resulting in ratios of 10.38 and 7.38 for the PSi and Si cells, respectively. Therefore, better PC properties are obtained from the PSi cell, consistent with its higher efficiency.
Recently, the combination of a carbon material and PSi has been known to result in the overall coverage and passivation of PSi due to carbon minimizing surface charge recombination and lowering the charge transfer resistance. On the other hand, the air gap in PSi can eliminate residual molecules easily from the graphene/PSi interface, which can lead to a decrease in the roughness of PSi as demonstrated in our previous work, as well as the reduction of the recombination sites possibly formed on the PSi surface by the etching-induced termination of PSi. The influence of termination on the long term stability of the solar cell was studied by measuring the J–V curve with time in air (Fig. S6, ESI). The J–V curve was almost invariant for 7 days, resulting from the role of the graphene protective layer as an outstanding gas barrier.
To understand why the best PCE and Jsc were obtained at td = 5 s, we extracted the shunt resistance (Rsh) and the ideality factor (n) from the dark J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 2(a). At low voltages (region I), the J–V characteristics are generally determined by Rsh, and at intermediate voltages (region II) they are determined by n. At low voltages (region I, V < 0.1 V), Rsh varies from 2423 to 971 and 1051 ohm cm2 as td increases up to 7 s for the Ag and Au NPs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(b), indicating that Rsh is smaller at longer td values. In region II (V = 0.1–0.4 V), the J–V characteristics of the nonideal diode based on the thermionic emission model can be expressed by the equation J = Js[exp(eV/nkT) − 1], where Js is the ideal reverse saturation current density and n can be estimated from the slope of the curves derived through curve fitting, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The ideality factor of the graphene/PSi diodes ranges from 4.12 to 6.00 or from 3.68 to 4.78 with increasing td from 1 to 7 s for Ag or Au NPs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and Table 1 (see Table S1, ESI for Ag NPs). This is believed to result from the higher porosity obtained by etching with Au NPs (see SEM images in Fig. S2, ESI). For the best EQE and Jsc, the reflection should be minimized with Rsh being maximized. Due to this trade-off correlation, the EQE and Jsc are largest at td = 5 s, which is the optimal condition for obtaining the highest PCE (3.52%) at td = 5 s for Ag and Au NPs, as shown in Table 1 (see Table S1, ESI for Ag NPs). The td-dependent statistical deviations of the PCE, averaged for 16 solar cell devices, also show that the highest PCE (3.18 ± 0.34%) is achieved at td = 5 s for Au NPs, as shown in Table 1 (see also Table S1 and Fig. S7, ESI). Based on these results, the doping of graphene in the solar cells was done only for the PSi layers formed with Au NPs at a fixed td of 5 s.
To investigate the effectiveness of doping graphene, graphene was treated with a single dopant, Au NPs or TFSA, each of which makes graphene a p-type semiconductor, as well as with both of the dopants. The SEM image in Fig. 3(a) shows the morphology on the surface of the graphene layer co-doped with Au NPs and TFSA. In the XPS spectra, shown in Fig. 3(b), the peaks corresponding to the C 1s, N 1s, Au 4f and O 1s core levels are clearly seen, indicating the successful doping of graphene with Au NPs and TFSA. The doping effect was also confirmed by the Raman G and 2D band shifts (Fig. S8, ESI). The G/2D peaks of the Au NP-, TFSA- and Au NP/TFSA-doped graphene layers are blue-shifted by 7/4, 12/7 and 18/12 cm−1, respectively, compared to pristine graphene, which can be attributed to the change in the electronic configuration of graphene by doping, as described in the previous reports.
To evaluate the influence of treatments with Au NPs, TFSA or Au NPs/TFSA, the transmittance, sheet resistance, and work function of the doped graphene were measured, as shown in Fig. 3(c)–(e). Fig. 3(c) shows the transmittance spectra of the pristine and doped graphene layers on quartz. The transmittance at 550 nm is about 97.6% for pristine graphene, but decreases to 93.1, 96.6 and 92.71% when doping with Au NPs, TFSA or Au NPs/TFSA, respectively. The sharp reduction in transmittance when doping with Au NPs seems to be due to light scattering by the Au NPs. In contrast, the transmittance was reduced by only about 1% with TFSA treatment, which is extremely small compared to that for other kinds of chemical dopant. The sheet resistance of pristine graphene ranges from 1000 to 1200 Ω sq−1, and the averaged sheet resistance decreases from 1090 to 310, 230 and 195 Ω sq−1 by doping with Au NPs, TFSA or Au NPs/TFSA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the work function (WG) of graphene is 4.62 eV before doping, and it increases to 4.76 or 4.84 eV after doping with Au NPs or TFSA, respectively. Co-doping with Au NPs/TFSA results in a further increase of WG to 4.88 eV, which is beyond the upper limit that can be reached by single doping with Au NPs or TFSA. This suggests that the combination of Au NP and TFSA treatments can be regarded as a useful co-doping process for p-type graphene, leading to a remarkable increase of WG.

Fig. 4(a) shows typical J–V curves of the PSi heterojunction solar cells under illumination for the pristine and doped graphene layers. The photovoltaic performances are greatly improved by the doping of graphene, irrespective of the kind of dopant. The co-doped graphene/PSi/Si solar cell exhibits the largest photovoltaic parameters: 10.69% PCE, 0.508 V Voc, 32.75 mA cm−2Jsc and 64.25% FF, as shown in Table 2. Fig. 4(b) shows dark J–V curves of the solar cells, indicating the typical rectifying behavior of the Schottky junctions. Before doping, the diode ideality factor (n) is estimated to be 4.41 from the linear fit to the ln J–V plot, and it is reduced to 1.97, 1.93 and 1.81 after doping with Au NPs, TFSA and Au NPs/TFSA, respectively. The lowered n indicates that interface recombination is suppressed after the doping of graphene.

The series resistance (Rs) and Rsh of the solar cells were also determined from the dark J–V curves and are summarized in Table 2. All kinds of treatment led to smaller Rs and larger Rsh values, both of which are favorable for a higher FF. In particular, Rs is reduced from 12.8 Ω cm2 before doping to 2.44 Ω cm2 after co-doping. The reduced Rs can be attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity of graphene by doping and the resulting decrease of ohmic losses. On the other hand, Rsh increases from 1412 Ω cm2 before doping to 4716 Ω cm2 after co-doping. The increased Rsh also results from the decrease of interface recombination after doping, caused by the doping-enhanced barrier height at the graphene/PSi Schottky junction. The Schottky barrier height (ΦB) can be extracted from the ln J–V plots. ΦB is estimated to be 0.955 V before doping, and it increases to 1.028, 1.051 and 1.073 V after doping with Au NPs, TFSA and Au NPs/TFSA, respectively, as shown in Table 2.
The underlying physical mechanism of the performance enhancement by co-doping graphene can be understood based on the energy band diagram of the graphene/PSi Schottky junction solar cell before and after co-doping (Fig. S9, ESI). In a Schottky junction cell, photo-generated electron–hole pairs are separated by the built-in electric potential (Vbi) formed at the graphene/Schottky barrier, and Voc scales linearly with Vbi. Co-doping leads to the increase of WG, as shown above. Given the relationship ΦB = WG − χSi, where χSi is the electron affinity of Si, the increased ΦB is attributed to the doping-induced down shift of the graphene Fermi level, resulting in a larger Voc. The co-doping-induced increase of ΦB by ∼118 meV is consistent with that of Voc by ∼144 mV, as shown in Table 2. The photo-generated electron–hole pairs are rapidly separated under the higher built-in electric field, and the interface recombination of the carriers is inhibited by the increased ΦB, leading to the increase of Rsh. Jsc is also enhanced by doping due to the reduction of sheet resistance. Fig. 4(c) shows the EQE spectra of the solar cells before and after various doping treatments. The EQE is sequentially enhanced over a broad wavelength ranging from 300 to 1100 nm by doping with Au NPs, TFSA and Au NPs/TFSA, respectively, which is very much consistent with the doping-induced variation of Jsc, as shown in Table 2.

Fig. 5(a) shows the effect of the active area of the co-doped graphene/PSi/Si solar cells on the J–V characteristics. Three solar cells with different active areas of 9, 14 and 30 mm2 were fabricated and tested under the same conditions. About a threefold increase in the active area caused a significant drop in the FF from 64.25 to 55.57%, as shown in Table 3. The charge carriers should transport through the graphene layer to be collected by the external electrode, and the area of graphene is therefore a critical factor influencing the collection efficiency. In contrast, Voc and Jsc show almost no variations despite the increase of the cell area up to 30 mm2, indicating uniform doping on the graphene surface. These results suggest that the co-doping approach is very useful for the scalable fabrication of graphene-based solar cells.

We also studied the long-term stability of co-doped graphene/PSi solar cells by measuring the PCE for 15 days. The environmental temperature and humidity for the stability test were typically 25 °C and 40%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the solar cell with a 30 mm2 active area lost only 4.3% of its original PCE value, from 8.80 to 8.42% after 15 days, indicating an improvement in durability compared to the previously-reported chemical doping methods.

Graphene/PSi Schottky-junction solar cells were successfully fabricated based on MacEtch, and showed a maximum PCE of 3.52% at td = 5 s, resulting from the td-dependent trade-off correlation between the reflectance and the diode quality. Co-doping with Au NPs and TFSA increases the PCE of the solar cells from 3.52 to 10.69%. It was found that co-doping made the graphene a strong p-type semiconductor, resulting in a higher work function and lower sheet resistance compared to those for single-doped graphene, useful for the separation and collection of photo-induced carriers. This explains why the photovoltaic parameters are remarkably improved after co-doping graphene. Furthermore, the co-doped graphene/PSi/Si solar cell showed relatively small (∼5%) degradation in its PCE while preserved in air for 15 days. These results suggest that co-doping is an effective approach for achieving a high PCE in graphene-based solar cells.
