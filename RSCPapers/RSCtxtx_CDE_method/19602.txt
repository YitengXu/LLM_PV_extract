A series of narrow band gap conjugated copolymers comprising two electron-rich (donor, D) and one electron-deficient (acceptor, A) moieties regularly alternating along the polymer backbone were designed and synthesized. The ternary copolymers with the repeating unit in a D1–A–D2–A manner were constructed by copolymerizing a bisstannyled-D1 (D1 = cyclopentadithiophene or benzodithiophene-derivatives) and a dibromo-monomer (Br–A–D2–A–Br, D2 = dithienosilole, A = benzothiadiazole) through a palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization. It was recognized that the optical properties, frontier molecular orbital energy levels and the photovoltaic performance of the resulting copolymers can be influenced by modifying the copolymerized D1 moiety. By carefully optimizing the electron-donating behaviours and substitutions of the D1 unit, bulk-heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 4.11% were achieved based on an inverted device configuration of ITO/PFN-OX/PBDT-O-ADA:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. These results demonstrated that the construction of regularly alternating narrow band gap conjugated ternary copolymers can be an effective strategy for the development of electron-donating materials for polymer solar cells.

Semiconducting polymers have attracted considerable interest as the electron-donating materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) due to their specific merits of light-weight and cost-effective processing on the basis of flexible substrates. Remarkable progress in new π-conjugated polymers enables the bulk-heterojunction polymer/fullerene OPV to attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 10%. The basic requirements of the high performance conjugated polymers by virtue of high PCE involve the appropriated energy levels, narrow optical band gaps along with high absorptivity, as well as the high charge carrier mobility. A traditional molecular design strategy for such π-conjugated polymers concerns the combination of electron-rich (donor, D) and electron-poor (acceptor, A) moieties in an alternating push–pull fashion along the polymer chain, where the energy levels of the D–A skeleton can hybridize to give the extraordinary narrow band gaps. Of particular interest in this molecular framework is the easily tunable molecular structures and the substitutions of either donor or acceptor units, which allow for the access of tunable optical band gaps along with the precisely tailored frontier molecular orbital energy levels. While it appears straightforward in practice, only a limited number of donor or acceptor building blocks for polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been successful in achieving high performance.

Recently, an alternative molecular design strategy of ternary copolymers has emerged for the construction of conjugated polymers with specific optoelectronic properties. This strategy comprises the incorporation of an additional donor or acceptor component with an appropriate molar ratio into the D–A type of the polymer backbone, which allows for the integration of the merits of different moieties to attain delicately manipulated properties. Regarding the alternating binary D–A counterparts, such a ternary copolymer backbone that contains three components can lead to obviously extended absorption profiles, which is favorable for the photoactive layer to harvest sunlight. In this respect, a range of conjugated ternary copolymers containing different building blocks with appropriate donor/acceptor ratios have been developed and demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performance on account of the relatively high short circuit current densities.
On the other hand, one notes that the variation in the distribution sequences of different components can provide a randomly arranged backbone, which accordingly gives rise to the numerous possible chromophores with complicated hybridization of molecular orbitals and less favorable π-stacking of molecular backbones. These effects may also result in unanticipated trap sites and suppress charge carrier transportation. In this respect, ternary copolymers with regular organization of donor/acceptor moieties along the backbone are highly appreciated owing to their well-defined architectures, which can offer precise electronic structures together with the tendency of forming ordered π-stacking structures. To address this point, Wang et al. proposed and developed the D–A1–D–A2 type of regularly alternating ternary copolymer on the basis of thiophene as the donor unit and two electron-deficient quinoxaline and isoindigo as the acceptor units, which exhibited slightly broader absorption spectra due to better π–π stacking in the solid state and obviously enhanced device performance with respect to its random counterpart. Chen et al. demonstrated that the regular ternary copolymers based on thiophene alternating with phenanthrocarbazole and benzothiadiazole exhibited superior photovoltaic performance to the random analog. Very recently, Janssen et al. also compared the random and regular ternary copolymers comprising diketopyrrolopyrrole and thienopyrrolodione and bithiophene, and realized that the randomization of the electron-deficient units along the polymer chain has a negative effect on the photovoltaic performance.
Given the aforementioned beneficial photovoltaic performance that the regularly alternating ternary copolymers can offer, here we proposed a series of regular conjugated ternary copolymers consisting of ternary components, with the repeating units denoted as D1–A–D2–A. These ternary copolymers were constructed by copolymerizing a Br–A–D2–A–Br type of dibromo-intermediate with a bistannyled-D1 monomer, where the benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) were employed as the acceptor (A) and donor (D2) units, respectively, and several electron-donating cyclopentadithiophene (CDT) or benzodithiophene (BDT) derivatives were used as the D1 unit. The variation of the electron-donating behaviors and substitutions of the D1 unit exhibited significant influences on the optical properties, electrochemical properties and the photovoltaic performance.

As shown in Scheme 1, the palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of the 4,4-dioctyl-2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (Sn2-DTS) with 2 equivalents of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Br2-BT) gave the dibromo-intermediate of 7,7′-(4,4-dioctyl-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(4-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole), which was denoted as Br2-ADA. Further palladium catalyzed Stille polymerization of Br2-ADA with various bisstannyl compounds of (4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (Sn2-CDT), (4,8-bis(4,5-dioctylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (Sn2-BDT-T) and (4,8-bis((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (Sn2-BDT-O), gave the D1–A–D2–A type of target ternary copolymers PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, respectively, all of which bear the regularly alternating molecular architectures along the backbones.

All copolymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction by using methanol, acetone and hexane successively to remove the small-molecular weight fraction and catalyst residue. Then the solids were collected by using chloroform as the extraction solvent followed by precipitation in methanol and filtration. The molecular weight of these ternary copolymers was evaluated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) was determined to be 13.6, 64.6 and 48.4 kDa for PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, respectively, with the corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) in the range of 1.8–2.4.
Thermal properties of the resulting copolymers were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. No discernable phase transition was realized in DSC characteristics up to 300 °C. TGA measurements (Fig. 1) demonstrated that the decomposition temperatures (corresponding to 5% weight-loss temperatures) were 397, 396 and 322 °C for PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, respectively, implying good thermal stabilities of these copolymers.

The UV-vis profiles of all copolymers in dichlorobenzene solution with a concentration of 1 × 10−5 g mL−1 and as thin films (spin-casted from o-dichlorobenzene solutions) are shown in Fig. 2. All these ternary copolymers illustrate typical dual absorption features of the D–A type of conjugated polymers both in solution and as thin films, where the high energy absorbance band located in the range of 300–450 nm is originated from the π–π* transition of polymer backbones, while the low energy absorbance peak at 690–713 nm with relatively strong intensity could be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects between the donors and the acceptor moieties. In dilute 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution, PBDT-T-ADA exhibited slightly red-shifted ICT absorbance with the maximum absorption at 713 nm relative to that of 690 nm for PBDT-O-ADA, which may arise from the stronger electron-donating properties of the thienyl groups than the alkoxyl substitution.

Compared to the absorption profiles in dilute o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solutions, all polymers exhibit much broader absorbance as thin films owing to the increased intermolecular interactions. It is recognized that the absorption of PCDT-ADA centered at about 700 nm is slightly hypsochromic shifted along with the obviously broadened absorbance in the low-energy band relative to that of dilute o-DCB solution, which may be attributed to the increased interactions of various segments. We note that the absorption profile of PCDT-ADA, with the repeating unit of CDT-BT-DTS-BT, is essentially bathochromically shifted compared to the peak absorption located at about 672 nm for the DTS-BT based alternating copolymer. An analogous trend can also be realized for copolymers based on BDT derivatives as the D1 unit. It is also worth pointing out that PCDT-ADA exhibits slightly red-shifted absorbance relative to the copolymers based on BDT derivatives, which can be attributed to the stronger electron-donating properties of CDT than the BDT unit and the tendency of forming π-stacking as thin films. This observation agrees with other reported D–A type of conjugated polymer systems that are based on CDT/BDT derivatives as the electron-donating units and BT as the electron-accepting unit. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the resulting ternary copolymers as estimated from the onset of the absorbance of thin films are in the range of 1.49–1.61 eV.

To evaluate the frontier molecular orbitals of these ternary copolymers, the electrochemical characteristics of the polymer films on ITO glass electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The measurements were carried out by using the solution of tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile) as the supporting electrolyte and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The films of all copolymers were cast from o-DCB solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and all measurements were performed under an inert atmosphere. The obtained electrochemical characteristics of these copolymers are demonstrated in Fig. 3. The potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was measured as a standard. It is assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV to vacuum. Under the same experimental conditions as for the measurement of copolymers, the onset potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.47 eV with respect to SCE. Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (EHOMO) of the copolymers were calculated according to the following equation of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.33) (eV), where the Eox is the onset of the oxidation potential vs. SCE. Since the Eox referred to SCE of PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, they were determined to be 0.69, 0.92 and 0.96 V, hence the corresponding EHOMO were calculated to be −5.02, −5.25 and −5.29 eV, respectively. As the open circuit voltage (VOC) of OPVs is proportional to the gap between the EHOMO of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) of the acceptor, thus high VOC can be rationally expected due to the relatively deep EHOMO. The onset of the reduction potential (Ered) was determined to be −0.64, −0.61 and −0.70 eV for PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, respectively. According to the equation of ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.33) (eV), the ELUMO are calculated to be −3.69, −3.72 and −3.63 eV for PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, respectively (Fig. 3). Detailed electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1.

To further understand the molecular orbital geometry and electrical properties of the polymers, density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations are carried out on model compounds of D1–A–D2–A at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level by using the Gaussian 09 package. The alkyl side chains are replaced by methyl to simplify the calculation. Fig. 4 illustrates the calculated frontier molecular orbitals. For BDT-T-ADA and BDT-O-ADA, the LUMOs are predominantly located at the electron-deficient BT unit, which showed quite comparable LUMOs of about −2.61 eV. In contrast, the HOMOs are mainly located on the BDT-T or BDT-O unit, indicating that BDT-derivatives (D1) have weaker electron-donating properties than DTS (D2). On the other hand, for the model compound CDT-ADA with CDT as the D1 unit, the LUMO is distributed in the A–D2–A moieties while the HOMO is well-delocalized in the entire CDT-BT-DTS-BT moieties, resulting in a slightly increased LUMO of −2.55 eV and a decreased HOMO of −4.79 eV with respect to that obtained based on BDT derivatives as the D1 unit.


It is well-established that the hole mobility of donor polymers can play a key role in the performance of BHJ-type PSCs. Thus, to gain insight into the discrepancy in charge transportation of the copolymers, hole mobilities of these copolymers were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The measurement was carried out on the basis of hole-only device with a configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/copolymer/MoO3/Al. The mobility was calculated by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which was described by the Mott–Gurney square law: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ((V2)/(d3)), where J was the current, μ was the zero-field mobility, ε0 was the permittivity of free space, εr was the relative permittivity of the material, d was the thickness of the active layer; and V was the effective voltage. V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi, where V was the effective voltage, Vappl was the applied voltage, Vrs was the voltage drop, and Vbi was the built-in voltage. The slopes of the J1/2–V curves of these ternary copolymers were extracted by modeling the dark current in the SCLC region (Fig. 5). It was recognized that all these copolymers exhibited quite comparable hole mobilities with the values of 2.0 × 10−4, 1.7 × 10−4 and 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCDT-ADA, PBDT-T-ADA and PBDT-O-ADA, respectively.


The photovoltaic properties of these copolymers were investigated on the basis of the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the inverted structure of ITO/poly[9,9-bis(60-(N,N-diethylamino)hexyl)fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)hexyl)fluorene] (PFN-OX)/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. A thin layer of PFN-OX (∼5 nm) was spin-coated atop ITO, which can act as the interlayer to reduce the work function of ITO and can subsequently extract electrons. The photoactive layer of the copolymer:PC71BM was fabricated by spin-coating from dichlorobenzene solution of the polymer:PC71BM with an optimized weight ratio of 1:1. The processing solvent was o-DCB containing 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive with a volume ratio of 2%. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cell devices under AM 1.5 G at 100 mW m−2 conditions and the measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 6.


Table 2 summarizes the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated solar cell devices. The device based on PCDT-ADA showed a moderate performance with a moderate PCE = 2.80% (VOC = 0.64 V, JSC = 11.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.39), which may correlate to the unanticipated geminate recombination due to the straight octyl side chain in the DTS unit. The replacement of the CDT unit by a weaker electron-donating group of the BDT-T moiety provides a nearly unchanged PCE = 2.79% (VOC = 0.77 V, JSC = 8.78 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.39) for the copolymer PBDT-T-ADA. We note that the VOC of PBDT-T-ADA increases slightly relative to the PCDT-ADA based device, which is in accordance with the deeper EHOMO of the former. Further modification of the thienyl-substituted BDT-T with the alkoxyl-substituted BDT-O moiety leads to an enhanced PCE = 4.11% by virtue of the simultaneously increased JSC and FF. When considering the analogous hole mobilities of these copolymers as indicated by the SCLC measurements, the higher JSC of PBDT-O-ADA is likely correlated to the variation in the film morphology. The accuracy of the measured JSC values was confirmed by the calculated integration of the EQE with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum (Fig. 6b). It is worth noting that copolymer PCDT-ADA exhibits prolonged response beyond 800 nm, which agrees with the observation of extended absorbance as thin films. In addition, the PBDT-O-ADA exhibited much higher values in the range of 380–730 nm than copolymer PBDT-T-ADA, which is in good consistence with the higher short circuit current of the former.

Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) gave us insight into the surface topography of the bulk heterojunction ternary copolymer:PC71BM (1:1 in wt:wt) blend films (Fig. 7). The blend film of PCDT-ADA:PC71BM showed comparatively smooth surface topography with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of 0.4 nm. In contrast, films based on PBDT-T-ADA:PC71BM exhibited comparatively coarse surface topography with a RMS of 4.2 nm. One can also observe the distinct circular aggregations on the top of the film, which may originate from the poor miscibility of the ternary copolymer PBDT-T-ADA with PC71BM. In contrast, films based on the PBDT-O-ADA:PC71BM film exhibited relatively uniform film morphology with much less circular aggregations (RMS = 1.6 nm), and the nano-scale phase separation was essentially favorable for the charge carrier transport and can potentially reduce the probability of charge recombination within the photoactive layer, which was in accordance with the increased short circuit current and fill factor.


In summary, a series of narrow band gap conjugated ternary copolymers comprising two electron-rich (donor, D) and one electron-deficient (acceptor, A) moieties were designed and synthesized. The ternary components in these copolymers were regularly arranged along the polymer backbone in a D1–A–D2–A fashion. It was realized that the optoelectronic properties of these ternary copolymers can be significantly affected by the electron-donating behaviors and the substitutions of the D1 moiety. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 4.11% were achieved based on PBDT-O-ADA, which demonstrated the improved short circuit current and fill factor compared to the other copolymers. The enhanced device performance can be correlated to the relatively uniform film morphology with much less circular aggregations. These results demonstrated that the variation of the individual component of narrow band gap copolymers can be an effective strategy for the construction of polymers for solar cell applications.


All reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification.

The monomers (4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (Sn2-CDT, 72 mg, 0.1 mmol), Br2-ADA (84 mg, 0.1 mmol) were added to a 5 mL microwave tube with toluene (3 mL) and DMF (0.3 mL). After being purged with argon for 10 min, Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mg) was mixed in the solution, and the mixture was then purged with argon for 2 min. The tube was sealed and heated to 120 °C for 1 min, 140 °C for 1 min, 160 °C for 1 min and 170 °C for 45 min in a microwave reactor. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, then the reaction mixture was precipitated in methanol and collected via filtration. The polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone and hexane successively. After drying in the vacuum drying oven, a dark green solid was obtained (92 mg, 85%).

1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE Digital 300 MHz NMR workstation. Gel permeation chromatography (150 °C in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene) was performed on a Polymer Laboratories PL220 Chromatograph with linear polystyrene as the standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MODLI-TOF analyzer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a NETZSCH TG 209 under a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a N2 flow rate of 20 mL min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out with a Netzsch DSC 204 under N2 flow at heating and cooling rates of 0 °C min−1. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CHI 600D electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy images were obtained by using a Nano-Scope NS3A system (Digital Instrument) to observe the surface morphologies of the ITO interlayer.


The devices were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in a detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried under a nitrogen stream, followed by a UV-ozone treatment. The cross-linkable polymer PFN-OX (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-casted from its methanol:acetic acid (99:1 in v:v) solution onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrates to form ∼5 nm thin films, and the PFN-OX films were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. The ternary copolymer:PC71BM active blend layer with a thickness of around 90 nm was prepared by spin-coating the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution on top of the PFN-OX layer. Subsequently, about 10 nm molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and 100 nm aluminum were thermally deposited on top of the active layer under vacuum (∼10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask defining an active device area of 0.16 cm2. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were measured under an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). The power of the sun simulation was calibrated before the testing using a standard silicon solar cell, giving a value of 100 mW cm−2 during the test. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 236 source meter.
