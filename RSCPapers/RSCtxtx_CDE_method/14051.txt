Al2O3 films are deposited conformally and uniformly by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 150 °C throughout the surface of the nanoporous TiO2electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to serve as charge recombination barriers (CRB). The self-limiting film growth of ALD enables detailed analysis of the thickness dependence of the CRB effects on the DSSCs, revealing the optimal Al2O3 CRB thickness to be that produced by 1 ALD cycle (nominal thickness = 0.1 nm), at which the CRB increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs by 14% (to up to 7.8% PCE). Above 1 cycle, the ALD films excessively raise the Fermi level of the TiO2electrode surface, as determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), so as to block electron injection at the dye-to-TiO2 heterojunction and to cause significant degradation in the DSSC performance. Instead of its nominal 0.1 nm thickness, the 1-cycle ALD film has an effective CRB thickness of 0.3 nm because of steric hindrance among the ALD precursor molecules and the dye molecules, as analyzed by a graphical model. The optimal thickness of the ALD Al2O3 CRB is considerably thinner than the 0.9–2.5 nm reported for Al2O3 CRB formed by conventional sol-gel processes, but it should better reflect the true value, considering the better infiltrating capability and finer thickness resolution of the ALD films. The low temperature and fine thickness control of the ALD process will broaden the utility of CRB.


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising alternative to the commercial thin-film solar cells owing to their comparable power-conversion efficiency (PCE), low costs of ingredients, and ease of processing. To improve the PCE of DSSCs to a competitive level with the commercial technologies, much research has been conducted to address the issues limiting DSSCs' PCE, a main one among which is charge recombination. Charge recombination occurs at the interface between the porous electrode (most commonly made of TiO2) and the dye, where photo-generated electrons in the porous electrode tend to recombine with either the oxidized dye or the electrolyte, thereby reducing the photo-generated current, open-circuit voltage, and PCE. One effective approach for mitigating charge recombination is by applying at the porous electrode/dye interface a thin insulating metal oxide layer, which impedes charge recombination by forming an energy barrier for charge transport at the interface. Since the insulating layer impedes both charge recombination and charge injection, the latter being the normal mode of operation for DSSCs, there exists an optimal thickness for the insulating layer, above which its adverse effect on charge injection overshadows the improvement resulting from its reduction of charge recombination. On this front, improvements in PCE of up to 35% have been reported for TiO2-based DSSCs upon the addition of an 0.9–2.5 nm thick Al2O3 or Nb2O5 interface layer (referred to as a charge-recombination barrier), and even greater improvements have been achieved for SnO-based DSSCs. The application of the charge-recombination barrier (CRB) has so far relied on the sol-gel process, whose capability of infiltrating nanoporous structures ensures good coverage of the barrier over the surface of the nanoporous electrode. The sol-gel process, however, requires a sintering step at 450–500 °C to achieve CRB films of good quality and hence has limited compatibility with low-temperature fabrication processes, such as those for making plastic-based flexible DSSCs. Low-temperature (100 °C) sol-gel Al2O3 CRB has been demonstrated on flexible DSSCs by Haque et al., but the improvement provided by the CRB was not as pronounced as that by the high-temperature sol-gel CRB. Besides the temperature constraints of the sol-gel process, the thickness of the sol-gel films can only be altered with a resolution down to ∼1 nm, which is too coarse for the optimal thickness of the CRB to be accurately determined and for its benefits to be consistently reproduced; difficulty in reproducing the benefits of the CRB was reported by Bandaranayake et al.


Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is ideally suited as a method for forming the metal oxide CRB for DSSCs, as it offers high deposition conformality (which ensures uniform deposition onto the entire surface of nanoporous structures), low deposition temperatures (down to 33 °C for Al2O3), and high resolution (∼0.1 nm for Al2O3) in controlling the film thickness.ALD Al2O3 films have been used as recombination barriers for ZnO-based DSSCs, but contrary to expectation, no improvement in PCE was observed. In this work, we apply ALD Al2O3 CRBs to TiO2-based DSSCs, which are more well-characterized than DSSCs with other types of electrode material, to better characterize their effects and to determine their optimal thickness. We examine a low-temperature ALD process for forming the Al2O3 barriers to achieve compatibility with low-temperature DSSCs fabrication processes. We verify the coverage and uniformity of the ALD Al2O3 layer in the porous TiO2electrode with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). We estimate the effective CRB thickness of the ALD films with a graphical model that accounts for steric hindrance among molecules of the ALD precursors and the dye. We correlate the effects of the CRB on DSSCs with the shift in the Fermi level of the TiO2electrode determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).

The layer structure of the DSSC device employed in this study is as follows: transparent conductive glass/TiO2electrode with an optional Al2O3 film/dye/electrolyte/Pt/transparent conductive glass. The dye was the bis(tetrabutylammonium) salt of cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-ruthenium(II) (N719 dye). The transparent conductive glass (Geomatec Co. LTD) contained a bilayer indium tin oxide/antimony tin oxide film with 5 Ω/cm2 sheet resistance. The TiO2electrode was 6 mm in diameter and composed of two screen-printed layers with different levels of porosity: a 12 µm thick nanoporous layer at the bottom (adjacent to the ITO electrode) formed with ∼20 nm TiO2nanoparticles; and a 4 µm thick scattering layer at the top formed with 200–400 nm TiO2 particles. The ∼20 nm TiO2nanoparticles were prepared using a previously reported method.Atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 was done on the TiO2electrodes in a Cambridge NanoTech Savannah 100 ALD system, using trimethylaluminium (TMA) and H2O as precursors and a 150 °C deposition temperature. The ALD process consisted of a given number of identical cycles, each containing the following 6 steps: dosing with H2O for 0.05 s, soak in the H2O dose for 2 min, evacuation for 5 min, dosing with TMA by opening the TMA valve for 0.05 s, soak in the TMA dose for 2 min, and evacuation for 5 min. The precursors were carried with a constant 20 sccm N2 flow throughout the cycle. The ALD conditions had been optimized in terms of uniformity and purity of the deposited Al2O3 films on the TiO2electrodes. The deposition rate was 0.1 nm per cycle, as determined by HRTEM on Al2O3-coated TiO2electrodes (to be discussed in the Results section) and by ellipsometry on Al2O3 films deposited on flat silicon substrates. The TiO2electrodes with or without the ALD Al2O3 overlayer were sensitized with the N719 dye to saturation in an N2 glove box. The content of the electrolyte solution was as follows: 0.1 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PrMeImI) in anhydrous acetonitrile. The photocurrent-voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination simulated with a Peccell solar simulator. EDX analysis of the TiO2electrodes was made using an EDX analyzer (Oxford, INCA Energy-350) attached to a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-7000F). UPS analysis of the TiO2electrode was performed on a VG ESCAlab 250 UPS analyzer at a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 torr, using He I radiation (hv = 21.2 eV) from a He-resonance lamp. The energy resolution was 0.01 eV, as determined by the slope of the Fermi edge of a sputter-cleaned silver sample.


The uniformity of the ALD Al2O3 CRB throughout the porous TiO2electrode was verified by EDX analyses done at different depths into the electrode (see Fig. 1 and Table 1), which show that the Al/Ti ratio was constant in the nanoporous layer and was lower in the scattering layer. The lower Al/Ti ratio in the scattering layer is to be expected from a uniform Al2O3 layer, because given the same Al2O3 thickness in the scattering and the nanoporous TiO2 layer, the Al/Ti ratio will be smaller in the scattering layer due to the lower surface area/volume ratio of its larger constituent particles. The SEM micrographs in Fig. 2 show that the pores in both layers of the TiO2electrode were not clogged or narrowed by the ALD Al2O3 layer, as the appearance of the pores was the same with or without the ALD layer. (Note that the slight blurring of the with-ALD images, Fig. 2b and d, was due to the charging effect of the insulating Al2O3 layer.) The coverage and thickness of the Al2O3 layer on the TiO2electrode were further examined with HRTEM (see Fig. 3), which also shows a uniform and conformal Al2O3 layer. The thickness of the Al2O3 layer was ∼2 nm and ∼1 nm for 20 cycles (Fig. 3a and b) and 10 cycles (Fig. 3c), respectively, indicating a constant deposition rate of 0.1 nm per cycle, which agreed with the deposition rate determined by ellipsometry on flat substrates. The above results confirmed that with the ALD conditions selected for this study (see Experimental section), the ALD precursors were able to fully penetrate the bilayer TiO2electrode, while the excess precursors could be fully removed, so that uniform deposition was achieved on the entire surface of the electrode. It should be noted that the thicknesses reported below for the ALD Al2O3 layers deposited with fewer than 10 cycles on the porous TiO2electrodes were not experimentally measured values, as they were too thin to accurately observe experimentally, but instead nominal values estimated by multiplying the number of cycles by 0.1 nm/cycle.

The ALD Al2O3 CRBs significantly improved the characteristics of the DSSC devices (Table 2), consistent with previous reports on sol-gel Al2O3 barriers; however, the optimal thickness of the ALD barriers differed greatly from that reported for the sol-gel barriers. The optimal thickness for the ALD barriers was that produced by 1 cycle of ALD (0.1 nm in nominal thickness), which resulted in an average 14% increase in PCE among the 11 pairs of devices tested, with the highest PCE achieved being 7.82%; the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) all increased as well. As the thickness of the barrier increased to 0.2 nm (2 cycles), the resulting device started to show poorer characteristics than the controls, indicating that the barrier thickness had already exceeded the optimal value. As the thickness of the ALD barrier further increased to 0.5 nm (5 cycles) and 1.0 nm (10 cycles), the latter of which is within the range of the optimal thickness (0.9–2.5 nm) reported for sol-gel Al2O3 CRBs, the devices became nearly nonfunctional.

It appears unreasonable that even though the 1- and 2-cycle ALD CRBs were both ultra-thin films that differed by only 0.1 nm in their nominal thickness, they imparted opposite effects on the DSSCs. As discussed in the following, this drastic difference in the CRB effects between the 2 types of ALD films can be explained by considering their effective CRB thickness, which is the actual Al2O3 thickness between the dye molecules and the TiO2 surface, instead of the nominal thickness. The depiction of an ALD film as a uniform film with a nominal thickness is inaccurate for ultra-thin films, especially those deposited by 1 and 2 cycles, where the deposition actually consists of discontinuous Al2O3 monolayer stacks whose areal distribution is determined by steric hindrance among the precursors and by the distribution of chemisorption sites on the surface. Therefore, depending on the placement of the dye molecules over the electrode surface, there can be different numbers of Al2O3 monolayers between the dye and TiO2, and the effective CRB thickness will be the average of all the placement possibilities. To evaluate the effective CRB thickness of the 1- and 2-cycle ALD films, we establish a graphical model based on the molecular sizes of the precursors and the dyes as well as the distribution of chemisorption sites, as shown in Fig. 4. For the first ALD cycle, the chemisorption sites are the exposed oxygen atoms of the TiO2 surface, and Al2O3 is deposited through the following mechanism: (1) the dosed H2O converts the exposed oxygen atoms into Ti–OH groups; (2) the subsequently dosed TMA chemisorbs onto the Ti–OH groups, forming Ti–O–Al(CH3)2; (3) the Ti–O–Al(CH3)2groups are converted into Ti–O–Al(OH)2 upon the sample's release to air in the 1-cycle process or upon the H2O dosing step of the second ALD cycle in the 2-cycle process. The distribution of the exposed oxygen atoms (and thus the Ti–OH groups) shown in Fig. 4a is that of the (101) lattice plane of anatase TiO2, which was indicated to be the predominantly exposed surface by the spacing of the clearly defined fringes (3.53 Å) in the HRTEM image in Fig. 3. Accounting for steric hindrance among TMA molecules and among the dye molecules, the saturation coverage of the Ti–O–Al(OH)2 groups over the Ti–OH surface after the 1st cycle is shown in Fig. 4b, and the possible placements of the dye over the Ti–O–Al(OH)2/Ti–OH surface are shown in Fig. 4c. It can be seen from Fig. 4c that even though the 1st cycle produces Al2O3 on only part of the TiO2 surface, the dye can bond only to the deposited Ti–O–Al(OH)2 groups because its contact with the Ti–OH groups is prevented by steric hindrance, and therefore the effective CRB thickness of the 1-cycle film equals that of 1 Al2O3 monolayer, or 0.3 nm. Similarly, the 2nd cycle increases the coverage of the 1st monolayer and adds the 2nd monolayer on part of the surface (Fig. 4d), but the dye can bond only to the 2nd monolayer (Fig. 4e), making the effective thickness of the 2-cycle CRB that of 2 monolayers, or 0.6 nm. It was this large difference in the effective CRB thickness that caused their opposite effects. Importantly, it is one Al2O3 monolayer (0.3 nm) that is the optimal CRB thickness, not the nominal thickness of 0.1 nm, and doing one ALD cycle is the only way to achieve this optimal thickness. It should be noted that as the number of cycles increases beyond 2, the ALD film growth becomes more randomized, and the resulted films approach the nominal-thickness depiction.
Given our analysis that the optimal Al2O3 CRB thickness is one monolayer or 0.3 nm, we reason that the optimal thickness values of 0.9–2.5 nm reported previously for sol-gel Al2O3 films were likely to be overestimates due to the limited film-thickness resolution of the sol-gel method, whose minimum achievable Al2O3 thickness was ∼1 nm. The fact that positive CRB effects were still observed for the thick sol-gel Al2O3 films but not for the ALD Al2O3 of similar thickness was likely due to the poorer infiltrating capability of the liquid precursors of the sol-gel process compared with the vapor precursors of the ALD process. With poorer infiltrating capability of the precursors, the sol-gel films may be accidentally thinner in the electrode surfaces that are more difficult for the precursors to reach, where the thickness may fall into the desirable CRB thickness range. This is consistent with the reported difficulty in reproducing the CRB benefits using the sol-gel process.
The effects of the ALD Al2O3 CRBs as well as the dependence of the device characteristics on the CRB thickness are accounted for by the rise in the Fermi level of the TiO2electrode surface induced by the CRBs. A rise in the Fermi level of the TiO2 surface impedes both the dye-to-TiO2 electron injection and charge recombination, and therefore the requirement of a working CRB is to not raise the Fermi level so much as to significantly reduce electron injection, which occurs when the Fermi level is less than ∼0.1 eV below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye. To investigate this, the electron band structure of the TiO2electrode surface coated with different thicknesses of the ALD Al2O3 CRBs was determined using UPS, and the obtained UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The Fermi level, calculated by subtracting the secondary electron onset energy at the left edge of the spectra from the UPS excitation energy (21.2 eV), was raised from −4.36 eV of the uncoated TiO2electrodes to −4.24, −4.12, −3.04, and −2.40 eV for the TiO2electrodes coated with 1, 2, 5, and 10 cycles of ALD Al2O3, respectively (see Table 3). Following a similar trend, the valence band (VB) maximum of the TiO2electrode surface, calculated by adding to the Fermi level the x-intercept of the fitted straight line at the right edge of the spectra, was raised from −7.40 eV to −7.56, −7.58, −7.63, and −8.08 eV by the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-cycle CRBs, respectively. The measured Fermi level and valence band maximum of the uncoated TiO2electrode surface agree with the previously reported values that were determined using UPS. Compared with the LUMO of the N719 dye used in this study, −3.85 eV, only the Fermi levels of the 1-cycle and 2-cycle-coated TiO2 surface remained more than 0.1 eV below it (where electron injection is still significant), and the Fermi level was raised to above the LUMO (where electron injection is halted) with the thicker CRBs. This agrees with our observations that 1 ALD cycle produced the optimal thickness for the ALD Al2O3 CRB and that both 5- and 10-cycle CRBs rendered the DSSCs nearly nonfunctional. The fact that the 2-cycle CRB was detrimental to the DSSC performance even though its Fermi level was still more than 0.1 eV below that of the dye supports the conclusion of our graphic model: The effective CRB thickness of the 2-cycle CRB (0.6 nm) was much larger than its nominal thickness (0.2 nm).

In conclusion, a low-temperature (150 °C) ALD process produced Al2O3 films that served as effective CRBs for DSSCs, improving the PCE by an average of 14% among the 11 pairs of DSSC devices tested. The ALD films uniformly covered the entire surface of the nanopores of the TiO2electrode, as verified by EDX, HRTEM and SEM. The optimal thickness of the ALD CRB was produced by 1 ALD cycle, which corresponded to 0.1 nm of nominal thickness or 0.3 nm of effective CRB thickness, the latter of which was determined by considering steric hindrance among the ALD precursor molecules and the dye molecules. With the ALD CRBs that were thicker than the optimum, the Fermi level of the TiO2electrode surface, determined by UPS, was raised excessively so as to block the dye-to-TiO2 electron injection, thereby deteriorating the performance of the DSSCs. The optimal thickness of the ALD Al2O3 CRB was considerably thinner than the 0.9–2.5 nm reported for Al2O3 CRBs formed by the conventional high-temperature sol-gel process. We reason that the ALD value better reflects the true value, thanks to the better infiltrating capability and finer thickness resolution afforded by ALD. The excellent infiltrating capability and high thickness resolution of ALD will improve the reproducibility of the CRB effects; moreover, the low-temperature process demonstrated in this study will make accessible the benefits of the CRB to DSSCs fabricated at low temperatures, such as flexible DSSCs based on plastic substrates.
