In this communication, a novel bulk heterojunction solar cell based on an electron donor–acceptor conjugated triphenylamine dye was fabricated, and a high conversion efficiency of 1.23% was achieved under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2).

Recently, organic-based photovoltaic cells have been actively pursued as the future-generation solar cells due to their low-cost, ease of processing, and compatibility with flexible substrates. They can be prepared by multiple approaches with various architectures, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ), organic/inorganic hybrid cells, and layer-structured solar cells with small molecular weight organic materials. As one of the important research fields, the BHJ solar cells based on composites of electron-donor (D) and electron-acceptor (A) materials, for effective charge generation at their interface and subsequent hole/electron transfer in the corresponding donor/acceptor self-assembly phases, are regarded as the ideal system for photovoltaic applications. In the standard P3HT/PCBM-based BHJ device [P3HT: poly(3-hexylthiophene), PCBM: (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester], high efficiencies of 4–5% have been exhibited. However, the narrow absorption spectrum (300–650 nm) of P3HT limits the light harvesting portion of the solar spectrum, and thus hinders the further improvement of the efficiencies of P3HT-based devices. To overcome this problem, some low-band-gap polymers and small molecule dyes as donors have been synthesized and successfully applied to photovoltaic devices. In principle, small molecule materials have advantages such as a great variety, ease of synthesis and purification, and easy adjustment of structure to satisfy the special needs in photoelectronic devices. In addition, they possess a greater tendency to self-assemble into ordered domains, resulting in a high charge carrier mobility. More important is their high device reproducibility due to their single dispersity. Based on these considerations, a lot of small molecules were investigated as a promising class of donor materials for BHJ solar cell applications with efficiencies ranging from 0.3% to 2.67%.

In recent years, we successfully developed a series of triphenylamine-containing molecules with D–A structure as sensitizers in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells. For extending the development of materials in BHJ solar cells, a novel benzothiadiazole containing D–π–A conjugated organic dye (BzTCA, in Fig. 1), previously used in DSCs, was introduced for the first time as a donor material for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells in combination with the standard PCBM. Preliminary test presents a relatively high conversion efficiency of 1.23% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is one of the highest values reported in the BHJ solar cells with a small molecular weight compound as the donor.

BzTCA can be easily dissolved in common solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbon, THF, chlorobenzene, and toluene. Fig. 2 shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of BzTCA dye in THF (5 × 10−6 M) and solid film and BzTCA∶PCBM blend film (1∶2 w/w). The absorption spectrum of BzTCA in THF solution exhibits broad and strong absorption in the wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm with two major bands at about 393 nm and 557 nm. In the solid film, strong red shifts of the absorption spectrum were observed with edge at ca. 760 nm, indicating strong molecular aggregation in the solid film. The broad and strong spectrum of the solid film, covering the whole visible range in the solar spectrum, is key for light harvesting of the solar cell.
The BHJ solar cells were fabricated by using BzTCA as the donor, PCBM as the acceptor, and Al as the cathode with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BzTCA:PCBM/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate was first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried in air. The aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-coated on ITO glass to form a film of about 40 nm thickness, which was dried at 140 °C for 10 min in air. Then a solution containing a mixture of BzTCA∶PCBM with different weight ratios in o-chlorobenzene was then spin-coated on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer in air, and further dried at 80 °C for 10 min in air. Finally, 5 solar cells with the fixed active area of 4 mm2 were prepared through a shadow mask for aluminium deposition on one substrate. The Al electrode was deposited with a thickness of 80 nm by vacuum thermal evaporation below 10–7 Torr. The action spectra of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were carried out by using a commercial setup for IPCE measurement (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel, 67005).
It is well known that the blend ratio of the donor and acceptor strongly influences the carrier mobility in the photoactive layer and thus the performance of the BHJ devices. As listed in Table 1, the photovoltaic characteristics of the BHJ solar cells were measured at different blend ratios of comparable film thickness of about 40 nm. In the low PCBM blend (1∶0.5), the device gave low short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and thus power conversion efficiency (η). With the increase of the blend ratio from 1∶0.5 to 1∶3, the Jsc increased dramatically from 1.08 mA cm−2 to 6.32 mA cm−2, while the open-circuit voltages and fill factors (FF) did not give obvious and regular changes, resulting in the increase of the η from 0.16% to 1.23%, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3. Upon further increasing the blend ratio (1∶3), the Jsc decreased dramatically to 3.96 mA cm−2 with a decrease in η of 0.71%. The spectrum of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured for the BHJ cells with the 1∶2 blend ratio of BzTCA∶PCBM. As shown in Fig. 4, the broad feature appears covering the entire visible spectrum with one maximum (56%) at 445 nm and the other maximum (34%) at 605 nm. The action spectrum and the absorption spectrum overlapped well, indicating that the photon-to-electron conversion is achieved mainly from the photo excitation of BzTCA.

For further optimization of the device performance, the effect of the thickness of the photoactive layer on the performance was carried out at the 1∶2 blend ratio of BzTCA∶PCBM with the thickness ranging from about 20 nm to 80 nm, and the measured data are listed in Table 1. It is clear that the short-circuit current strongly depends on the thickness, while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) slightly decreases from 680 mV to 660 mV with the increase of the thickness from 20 nm to 80 nm, and not much change for the FF in the thickness range. The maximal Jsc was observed in the device with a 40 nm thick photoactive layer, and the Jsc dramatically decreases with further increase of the thickness. The decreased Jsc could relate to high series resistance in the thicker active layer, where the percolated pathway may be broken to some extent due to the difficulty to form a continuous hole-transfer phase from the small molecules in the relatively thick films. It should be noted that no noticeable change was found in the expectation to improve the performance through the annealing of the devices at the temperature ranging from 40 °C to 100 °C for 10 min. The tendency was reported previously, indicating that the BHJ solar cell with small molecular donors would give the highest device stability.
In order to scrutinize the effect of blend ratio of BzTCA∶PCBM on the device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to investigate the morphology of the film with different blend ratios as shown in the ESI. For all the films with a 1∶1, 1∶2 or 1∶3 blend ratio of BzTCA∶PCBM, relatively high quality films were observed without much difference in their morphologies. Generally, the high photovoltaic behavior of the device usually relates to the synergistic effects of its enhanced absorption of incident light, high hole mobility and high quality uniform spin-cast film. Thus, further research may be helpful to optimize the performance of photovoltaic devices.
In conclusion, a novel benzothiadiazole containing D–π–A conjugated organic dye was introduced as a donor material in BHJ solar cells for the first time. Initial test presents a relatively high conversion efficiency of 1.23% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is one of the highest values reported in the BHJ solar cells with a small molecular weight donor compound. Our report will open additional space for development of materials in BHJ solar cells.
