A series of D1–A–D2–A terpolymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as electron-deficient unit (A), alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) and thiophene-2,5-bis(2-alkyloxy)benzene-thiophene (TBT) as electron-rich units (D) have been designed and synthesized by Stille-coupling reaction. The effects of the TBT/BDTT ratios on the thermal, photophysical, electrochemical properties and crystallinity of the copolymers were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra, cyclic voltammetry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction, respectively. Compared with the binary copolymers (PDPPHT-TBT and PDPPHT-BDTT), the random terpolymers (PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT) exhibited significant improvement in thermal stability and hole mobility, and the optical, electrochemical properties, lamellar distance and π–π* stacking distance of the random terpolymers were successfully tuned with different TBT/BDTT ratios. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on the as-synthesized terpolymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor were fabricated. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.18% was obtained from the terpolymer PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention because of their solution processability, low cost, flexibility, and tunable band gap. The advance in donor (D)–acceptor (A) alternating low bandgap conjugated polymers has been the major driving force for the improvement of the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs. Up to now, the PCE of single junction PSCs has surpassed 10%. In these PSCs, the ideal copolymers used as donor materials generally possess broad absorption with a high absorption coefficient in the visible region, high hole mobility, suitable energy level matching with the fullerene acceptor, and a great discontinuous interpenetrating network for charge transport. However, further development of conjugated polymers is essential to achieve high-performance PSCs for commercialization.

Designing a copolymer with a broad and strong absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, high hole mobility and miscibility with fullerenes is an efficient strategy to obtain high-performance PSCs, one potential strategy towards broadening the absorption of the solar spectrum is to develop random terpolymers based on the copolymerization of two different electron-donating units and one electron-withdrawing group. Copolymers are typically blended with fullerene derivatives and the resulting so-called BHJ morphologies play a decisive role for device performance. And the good miscibility with fullerenes usually means high hole mobility. There have a series of methods to improve control the morphology. First, use the cross-linkable conjugated polymers. Second, construct stable copolymer/fullerene composite nanofibers through cooperation of noncovalent interactions. But there few paper reported varying the electron-donating units could achieve this aim as well.
Among the electron-donating monomers, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely used owing to its good planarity and excellent electron mobility. Moreover, the BDT based two-dimensional conjugated polymer by attaching the alkylthienyl side chains (BDTT) has good thermal stability, broad absorption spectra, low HOMO energy levels, which lead to a high photovoltaic properties. Furthermore, the BDTT could result in an increased polymer solubility in common organic solvents. Up to now, copolymer contain BDTT unit has low HOMO level (−5.44 eV) and high Voc (1.00 V) has been achieved. Recently, a series of papers have reported some approaches to designing crystalline photovoltaic copolymers, such as incorporating fused aromatic structures in a copolymer backbone, these approaches often increase the chain rigidity too much, reducing the solubility and decreasing miscibility with fullerenes. In order to avoid these disadvantages, a series of highly efficient semicrystalline photovoltaic polymers contain the thiophene-benzene-thiophene (TBT) unit have been designed and synthesized. The alkoxy side chains were anchored to the benzene ring, which can increase the solubility and miscibility with fullerenes, and compared with BDTT, the TBT unit make the polymer conjugated backbone has smaller twist, which would result a higher Jsc of the PSCs.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is electron-deficient lactam ring and has strong π–π interaction, which provides the possibility to design copolymer with strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and broad absorption spectrum ranging from visible to near-infrared region. But the electron-withdrawing effect of the lactam units causes the chromophore has a high electron affinity, and the strong hydrogen bonding between the lactam unit favors the chromophore forming physically cross-linked chain structure in the solid state, which lead to poor solubility. Therefore, Janssen reported the DPP bear two additional methyl substitute on the 3-position of the thiophene rings connected to the lactam units (PMDPP3T) to bring about an inductive electron-donating effect that raises the energy levels of frontier orbitals of the copolymer, without introducing any additional steric effects that could affect the solid-state properties of the material. There is no other paper reported the influence of long alkyl substituents on the 3-position of the thiophene rings connected to the DPP fragment, so we introduce two additional hexyl substitute the thiophene rings (DPPHT) to increase the solubility and decrease the crystallinity of copolymer containing DPP.
Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of novel terpolymers (Scheme 1) based on one electron-deficient unit (DPPHT), and two electron-rich units, alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) and TBT. For comparison, two binary copolymers incorporating DPPHT as electron-deficient unit and BDTT or TBT as electron-donating unit were synthesized. Subsequently, the effects of the TBT/BDTT ratios on the photophysical, electrochemical properties and aggregation of the random terpolymers were carefully studied.

4-Hexylthiophene-2-carbonitrile, (5,5′-(2,5-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-1,4-pheny-lene)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(trimethylstannane) (M2) and (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethyl-hexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M3) were synthesized according to already published procedures. The PC61BM was purchased from Solenne BV, and other chemical materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Chem Greatwall (Wuhan, China). Toluene was refluxed over sodium and benzophenone, distilled prior to use. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was dried and distilled under reduced pressure. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (merck, 200–300 mesh). All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and used without further purification.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured with Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements were performed on Bruker Autoflex III. UV-visible-Near Infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectra of the copolymers were conducted on a Perkin–Elmer Cary 100 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. The average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the copolymers were determined using Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with THF as eluent and polystyrene as standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was conducted on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer under nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode configuration and an electrochemistry workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. CV was conducted with the thin film on a Pt plate as the working electrode, Pt slice as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte is 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile solution. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) was obtained from Bruker d8 discover instrument. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on a Veecomulty mode 8 in a tapping mode. Thicknesses of thin film were measured with AMBIOS XP-100.


The synthetic routes for the monomers and the polymers are shown in Scheme 1, and the synthesis procedures are in the ESI. Bromination of compound 3 with NBS yielded compound M1. The structures of the monomers M1 was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR (Fig. S1 and S2) and MALDI-TOF MS. The copolymers were prepared through Stille coupling reactions between the monomer M2, M3 and the bromides M1 as shown in Scheme 1. All the copolymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, THF, chlorobenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The polymerization results and thermal properties of the copolymers are summarized in Table 1. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indexs (PDI), determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent, are 20.9 kg mol−1 and 1.7 for PDPPHT-TBT, 14.3 kg mol−1 and 1.8 for PDPPHT-BDTT, 33.6 kg mol−1 and 1.4 for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 32.5 kg mol−1 and 1.6 for PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT, 30.3 kg mol−1 and 2.1 for PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT respectively.

The thermal properties of the copolymers were investigated by TGA. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the TGA curves reveal that the onset temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) of PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT are 266 °C, 360 °C, 407 °C, 395 °C and 422 °C, respectively. Obviously, the thermal stabilities of the terpolymers are higher than those of binary copolymer, because terpolymers possess higher average molecular weight. Moreover, the thermal stabilities of the five polymers are good enough for the applications in optoelectronic devices. However, it did not show any noticeable glass transition in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis in the temperature range from 40 to 300 °C (see Fig. S3), due to the rigidity of conjugate skeleton.


The photophysical properties of the copolymers are investigated by UV-vis in diluted CHCl3 solution and thin films on quartz plates. Fig. 2 gives the absorption spectra of PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT in diluted CHCl3 solution (Fig. 2a) and as a thin film (Fig. 2b), and the correlated data are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the copolymers exhibit two distinct absorption bands. The first absorption bands at shorter wavelengths region (300–500 nm) with the absorption peak wavelength (λs,max) at 407 nm for PDPPHT-TBT, 348 nm for PDPPHT-BDTT, 360 nm for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 403 nm for PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and 403 nm for PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT are attributed to the π–π* transition of the polymeric backbone, as for the these copolymers, the relative position of the absorption peaks were fine tuned by changing the composition ratio of BDTT and TBT. By comparing their absorption spectra, a gradual red-shift was observed when increasing the content of TBT, which could be caused to the coplanarity conjugated block of TBT. The other absorption bands at longer wavelengths (550–900 nm) with the λs,max at 654 nm for PDPPHT-TBT, 652 nm for PDPPHT-BDTT, 680 nm for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 666 nm for PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and 657 nm for PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT, respectively, are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the donor unit and the acceptor unit in the main chain.

Compared with the absorption spectra in the solution, the maximum absorption peaks (λf,max) of copolymers PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT in solid films are red-shifted about 107, 17, 72, 86 and 90 nm, respectively. This can be explained as the strong interaction between the polymer chains in solid films.
Furthermore, it is noticed that the copolymers in film show a strong shoulder peak (733–763 nm), suggesting more orderly π–π stacking in the solid state. Obviously, PDPPHT-TBT shows the biggest difference between the solution and solid state, this indicated that PDPPHT-TBT film formed a stronger molecular stacking than other copolymers in film, which may result from the TBT unit lead PDPPHT-TBT stack more closely in the solid state. According to the absorption spectra of the films (Fig. 3b), the optical gaps of the copolymers, deduced from their absorption edges, are 1.48 eV for PDPPHT-TBT, 1.50 eV for PDPPHT-BDTT, 1.51 eV for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 1.52 eV for PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and 1.53 eV for PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT, respectively, both near ideal optical gaps (1.1–1.5 eV).

CV was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and evaluate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers. The CV curves were recorded using Pt plate as working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) electrode as a reference and Pt film as a counter electrode. Fig. 3 shows the CV curves of the copolymers and ferrocene, and their electrochemical data are listed in Table 2. The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.38 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, which is assumed to an absolute energy level of 4.8 eV under vacuum. Therefore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the electrochemical energy gaps (Eecg) of the copolymers can be calculated according to the following equations:


HOMO = −(Eox + 4.42) (eV)

(1)

LUMO = −(Ered + 4.42) (eV)

(2)

Eecg = e(Eox − Ered) (eV)

(3)
The onset potentials for oxidation (Eox) were observed to be 0.82 V, 0.98 V, 1.04 V, 0.86 V and 0.79 V for PDPPHT-TBT.
PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT respectively. Accordingly, the HOMO energy levels of the binary polymers were determined to be −5.24 eV and −5.40 eV, respectively. And the corresponding values of PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT were tuned by controlling the ratios of BDTT to TBT, with the values of −5.46 eV, −5.28 eV and −5.21 eV, respectively. Obviously, the HOMO energy levels of terpolymer PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT is highest compared with the other terpolymers, which may be explained by terpolymer PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT possesses smaller twist due to more contents of TBT. Similar calculations for the LUMO energy levels of all of the copolymers proceeded with the values −0.76 V, −0.89 V, −0.84 V, −0.86 V and −0.75 V, respectively. Given the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, all of the copolymers have enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation with fullerene derivatives. The electrochemical bang gaps (Eecg) of the copolymers were 1.58, 1.87, 1.88, 1.72 and 1.54 eV for PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT respectively. As shown in Table 2, Eecg was slightly larger than Eoptg due to the exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials.

To explain the structural properties of the terpolymer and understand the possibility of charge transfer from donor to acceptor on electronic excitation, the optimized structure of PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT was calculated geometrically using the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The optimized structure with torsion angles and electron densities of HOMO and LUMO of the terpolymer are shown in Fig. 4. Note that the alkyl side chains in these repeating units are replaced by a methyl group to simplify the calculation. In the optimized structures, the calculated result indicates that TBT conjugated block has relatively smaller torsion angle between the thiophene moiety and its adjoining benzene units in TBT. The torsion angle between the hexylthiophene moiety and the adjacent thiophene substituents in the BDTT units is much larger than the torsion angle between the hexylthiophene moiety and the adjacent thiophene moiety in the TBT units, which results PDPPHT-BDTT has lower HOMO energy level. This observation was in good agreement with the CV results. On the other hand, the electron density of HOMO in PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT was localized over the whole molecular skeleton, the electron density of LUMO in PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT was mainly located on the DPP and BDTT units. From those observations, it is clearly evident that, in PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT, the HOMO-LUMO excitation induced by light irradiation could move the electron distribution through the whole molecular skeletons more effectively, and the photo-induced electrons can be more efficiently transferred from the copolymer to the PCBM.


Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) measurement has been used to investigate the formation of ordered structures within polymeric thin films. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the copolymers films casted from chloroform, performed in reflection geometry at 40 mA, 40 kV with Cu-Kα radiation. Every copolymer exhibits a distinct diffraction peak in the small angle region of 4–6°, this was related to the polymer lamellar spacing, and another broad one in the large angle range between 15° and 25°, this was attributed to the stacking distances between coplanar conjugated polymers. The WAXRD clearly shows the 100 peaks at 5.65° for PDPPHT-TBT, 4.76° for PDPPHT-BDTT, 4.16° for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 4.56° for PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT 5.28° for PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT corresponding to the lamellar distances of 15.64 Å, 18.56 Å, 21.24 Å, 19.38 Å, 16.73 Å, respectively. Simultaneously, the 010 peaks are, observed at 22.28° for PDPPHT-TBT, 21.50° for PDPPHT-BDTT, 21.41° for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 21.52° for PDPPHT-TBT-21.41° for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, 21.52° for PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and 21.91° for PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT, indicating the π–π stacking distances of 3.99 Å 4.13 Å, 4.15 Å, 4.12 Å and 4.06 Å, respectively. Comparing all of the copolymers, we can found a gradual decrease of π–π stacking distances when increasing the content of TBT, which indicate the introduction of TBT can make the copolymers have more orderly π–π stacking in the solid state, and compared with the copolymers contain thiophene rings connected to the DPP (P8DTB-M, P8DTB-H and pPhDPP), PDPPHT-TBT showed smaller π–π stacking distances, which denoted introduce two additional hexyl substitute the thiophene rings (DPPHT) to improve the ordered degree of copolymer containing DPP is a feasible method.


Since the morphology of photoactive layer is also a critical factor for affecting the efficiencies of PSCs, the morphologies of the polymers/PC61BM (1/2, w/w) blend films were investigated by AFM, AFM devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/MoO3/polymer:PC61BM (1:2), the active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene. The height images and phase images of the copolymers are shown in Fig. 6. It could be observed that the blend film of PDPPHT-BDTT and PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT exhibited relatively obvious phase separation and higher RMS values of 3.81 nm for PDPPHT-BDTT, 1.76 nm for PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, however, the PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT blend film forms nearly invisible phase separation and small surface root mean square roughness (RMS of 0.696 nm, 0.68 nm, 0.52 nm, respectively), which indicated the homogeneous morphologies can be obtained by tuning the ratio of TBT and BDTT, obviously, by varying the electro-donating units, the morphology of polymer solar cells could be successfully controlled. For the binary copolymers, PDPPHT-TBT has an optimized nanoscale interpenetrating network which was beneficial for the charge transportation, thus leading to the highest Jsc. Compared with PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT exhibited more obvious phase separation, but it has higher Jsc, which may be due to the broad absorption bands.


The charge carrier transport properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of PSCs. To understand the influence of charge carrier mobility of the copolymers/PC61BM blend films on the photovoltaic properties, the hole mobilities of the target copolymers were measured by a space charge limit current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (25 nm)/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3 (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). The hole mobility data of the conjugated polymers are summarized in Table 3, the average hole mobilities of PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT, PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT ranged from 5.01 × 10−6 to 3.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared with the binary copolymers, the random terpolymers exhibited higher value, which indicated the better charge carrier transport properties of the random terpolymers. For terpolymer PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT, the hole mobility is 3.56 × 10−4, which increase nearly 2 magnitudes than the value (5.01 × 10−6 cm2 V−1) of binary copolymer PDPPHT-BDTT, because the introduction of TBT improved morphology of the terpolymers/PC61BM blend films. Compared with PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT shows higher hole mobility value as well, which can explained by the optical phase separation, the suitable crystallization and the better stacking manner of molecular skeleton. Which indicated synthetic terpolymer is an effective way to increase hole mobility.

To investigate whether the BDTT unit and TBT unit make a contribution to the power conversion efficiency in the PSCs, the bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/polymer:PC61BM (1:2)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm) under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination. The active layers were spin-coated from dichlorobenzene, and in some cases a small amount of the high boiling-point additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used to optimize the morphology. Fig. 7 shows the best J–V curves of the devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 3.

From Table 3, the Voc of PDPPHT-TBT is 0.63 V, PDPPHT-BDTT exhibited the higher value of 0.77 V, which is due to the lower HOMO energy level. It is observed that the Voc of the terpolymers ranges from 0.67 to 0.72 V. The non-linear trend is decided by a couple of other factors besides the HOMO levels of the copolymers, such as interchain distances and morphology of the active layers. Notably, the binary polymer PDPPHT-TBT has broad absorption spectra of film and relatively suitable phase separation (Fig. 6) exhibits preferable Jsc.
Furthermore, the PCEs of the random terpolymers showed a non-linear compositional dependence from 1.55% to 2.94% in the order: PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT (2.94%) > PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT (2.79%) > PDPPHT-TBT (2.55%) > PDPPHT-BDTT (1.98%) > PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT (1.55%). In particular, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT exhibited the highest PCE value of 2.94% (Jsc = 9.39 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.65 V, FF = 0.48) among all of the copolymers, which was attributed to the increased Jsc. In contrast, the PCE decreased in the device of PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT blended with PC61BM (1.98%), which mainly results from the significant decrease of the Jsc and FF.
Several optimization processes were taken to improve the PCE of the conjugated polymers (see the Table S1). One process used 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive, all of the copolymers are obtained higher PCE of 3.51%, 2.46%, 3.53%, 3.51% and 2.02% for PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT, PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT and PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT respectively, because the sharp increase Jsc. The other process involved a mixture of chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF) as the processing solvent. PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT exhibited the highest PCE of 4.18% (Jsc = 10.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.57), which was achieved when the volume ratio of CB to CF was 3:1, and PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT exhibited lower PCE of 3.64% due to the decreased of Jsc.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) curves were give in the similar results (Fig. 8). The devices based on copolymers are exhibited two major responses, 300–500 nm and 500–900 nm. The binary copolymer PDPPHT-BDTT device only shows a lowest maximum IPCE value of 33.40% at 660 nm, which is matched with the lowest Jsc values. The terpolymer PDPPHT-3TBT-BDTT device possesses a maximum IPCE value of 48.65% at 345 nm. Besides, PDPPHT-TBT, PDPPHT-TBT-3BDTT and PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT have a similar IPCE, suggesting that the photon electron conversion processes were similar.

In summary, a series of novel conjugated polymers with one electron-deficient unit DPPHT and two electron-rich units TBT and BDTT building blocks were designed and synthesized. The optical, electrochemical properties, lamellar distance and π–π* stacking distance of the random terpolymers were optimized by vary the ratio of TBT and DBTT. We found that, as the TBT content increased, the π–π stacking distances decrease, but the HOMO level heighten, which lead to a high Jsc and low Voc values. Due to the introduction of TBT, the solubility of random terpolymers and the morphology of PC61BM/terpolymers blend films have been improved, so as to improve the mobility of the blend and photovoltaic performance of the device. As a result, the morphology and hole mobility of conjugated polymers could be successfully controlled by varying the electro-donating units. Polymer solar cells based on PDPPHT-TBT-BDTT:PC61BM blends (1:2, w/w) exhibited a high PCE of 4.18% (Jsc = 10.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.57), indicating that the chemical structure of this conjugated random terpolymers composed of two different electron-rich units is an effective approach to balance the Jsc and Voc of conjugated polymers for high performance PSCs.
