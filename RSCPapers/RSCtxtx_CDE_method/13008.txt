The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has been recently increased from 3.81% to 24.2%, yet it still lags behind the Shockley–Queisser limit with an ideal value of 33%. It has been widely recognized that the effective defect passivation of perovskite films is crucial for further boost in the efficiency. Herein, we systematically summarized and reviewed the development, recent advances, and commercial applications of the methylamine (CH3NH2, MA)-induced defect-healing (MIDH) method, from the view of defect passivation and moisture stability. MA gas can recrystallize perovskites and form dense films with higher crystallinity and fewer defects, which can improve the carrier lifetime, carrier diffusion length, and moisture stability. Moreover, this MIDH technique has been successfully implemented in scalable perovskite module deposition process and recycling process, thus enabling the large scale fabrication of high quality perovskite films with lower trap state density. Lastly, the perspective of this promising technique and some remaining open questions about the future scale up of the manufacturing process for obtaining high quality perovskite thin films and related optoelectronics devices are proposed.

With the increasingly severe energy demands and the deteriorating ecological environment, improving the current energy structure and exploring sustainable green energy has become a topic of great concern worldwide. Among many new energy sources, solar energy has attracted much attention due to its abundant reserves, clean and pollution-free energy generation, renewability, and limited geographical restrictions. In terms of the effective use of solar energy, photovoltaic conversion is the fastest growing and most promising research field in the recent years. In the current times, crystalline silicon solar cells and silicon-based thin film solar cells have achieved high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) and have been widely used in the photovoltaic market. However, due to its high raw material and manufacturing prices, silicon solar cells have been limited in the application to residential solar cells.

Since Kojima et al. first used methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) perovskite as a light absorber material in sensitized solar cells in 2009, the research of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted tremendous attention in the field of emerging new-generation solar cells both from the academia and industries. During the last decade, the PCE of PSCs has achieved a huge enhancement with the certified record of PCE of 24.2% from the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). The organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have an AMX3 structure, where the A site is a monovalent organic cation or cesium ion that occupies eight vertices of the cube. Due to space-constrained effects, it is usually the formamidine cation (NH2CHNH2+, FA+), methylammonium cation (CH3NH3+, MA+), and cesium ion (Cs+). M site is the transition metal cation, located in the body of the cube, such as Pb2+ or Sn2+. The X site is a halogen (Cl−, Br−, I−) or a halogen-like anion (SCN−) located at the faces of the cube. The crystal structure of an ideal perovskite AMX3 can be regarded as a [MX6]4− octahedron in a three-dimensional space with a common apex angle connecting to form a network frame; the A site ions fill up the gap of the octahedron and the structure is stabilized by van der Waals forces. A stable perovskite structure can only be formed when the ionic radii of A+, M2+, and X− is limited within the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t, eqn (1)) and the octahedron factor (μ, eqn (2)). These factors are defined as follows:
(1)
(2)
where
RA, RM, and RX refer to the corresponding ionic radii of A+, M2+, and X−, respectively. The most stable, typical 3D perovskites have corner shared structure with the values 0.8 < t < 0.9 and 0.442 < μ < 0.895. Otherwise, this leads to octahedra sharing the sides or sharing the faces with significant deviation.

Due to its low cost and high universality, solution processing is the preferred preparation method for perovskite films. However, the perovskite films processed in solution are typically polycrystalline and always contain defects such as pores and pinholes. Furthermore, trap states exist at the grain boundary and trap carriers, thus aggravating the recombination of non-equilibrium carriers and reducing the lifetime of non-equilibrium carriers. At the same time, due to large lattice mismatch, non-uniform contact with the corresponding buffer layer (hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL)) leads to the distortion of the interface crystal structure, which always produces deep trap states and seriously reduces the output voltage. On the other hand, low-cost deposition technologies such as blade coating, screen printing, and inkjet printing have been implemented to the prepare thick perovskite films with a large area, high yield, and repeatable light absorption layer. However, these defects increase exponentially with the increase in thickness. High quality perovskite films with lower defect density are necessary for industrial applications. Therefore, the preparation of low-trap perovskite thin films or effective defect passivation is of significant importance for scaling up the fabrication of perovskite films and other related optoelectronic devices.
Although novel advanced fabrication techniques including two-step deposition method, anti-solvent methods, and hot casting methods have been applied to form large, uniform, smooth, and pinhole-free perovskite films, it has been found that there is still a considerable amount of defects within the perovskite films; it is highly desired to further reduce the density of the defect states and reach the Shockley–Queisser limit for the resultant solar cell devices (ideal value of 33%). In this respect, mixed cation or anion perovskites have been developed to reduce the defect density of the resulting perovskite films. Saliba et al. found that the perovskites of ternary cations (Cs/MA/FA) had fewer defects compared with that of the binary cations (MA/FA). Quaternary cation (Rb/Cs/MA/FA) perovskite layers were further investigated and a lower defect density with a champion PCE of 21.8% was obtained. The addition of a small amount of Cl− and Br− anions could enhance the charge recombination lifetime of the MAPbI3 perovskite films. On the other hand, post-treatment processes have been developed to further reduce the defect density of pristine perovskite films. Xiao et al. increased the crystallinity and grain size of MAPbI3 to 1 micrometer by solvent annealing in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) atmosphere, resulting in an optimal device efficiency of 15.6%. Peng et al. introduced an ultra-thin passivation layer composed of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture to effectively passivate the defects at or near the perovskite/TiO2 interface, which significantly inhibited the interface recombination and provided an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.18 V.
This review focuses on a new method for the preparation of low-defect perovskite thin films and solar cells using the MIDH method. Firstly, the development of MIDH method is introduced, and we summarize the recent advances and research status of the MIDH method. Secondly, the improvement of the perovskite film quality by the MIDH method from the perspective of defect passivation is systematically discussed. Thirdly, the derivative of the gas healing method, cationic displacement, is introduced for the deposition of the perovskite thin films with organic cations beyond MA+. The implementation of this MIDH method in the scale up and commercialization of the perovskite related optoelectronic devices is also discussed. Finally, the perspective of this promising technique and some remaining open questions for the evolution of this method are answered.

The optical bleaching of MAPbI3 by amines was first reported by Zhao et al. and they pointed out that the bleaching of amines on perovskites, unlike the effect of water, is reversible and rapid, as shown in Fig. 1a. It was also observed that the XRD pattern of the MAPbI3 film in the presence of NH3 (Fig. 1b, green line) cannot match the XRD patterns of other possible compounds such as NH4PbI3, Pb(NH3)4I3, and NH4PbI3·xH2O. It was further reported that the bleaching of amines can be used for NH3 sensor applications.

The perovskite film treated by MA gas, which was named MIDH, was first proposed by Zhou et al. Similar to amine bleaching, in the MIDH process, the original MAPbI3 perovskite film was visually translucent and matte. At the moment of exposure to the MA gas, the film was bleached, forming an intermediate liquid phase of MAPbI3·xMA. After removal from the MA gas atmosphere, the film rapidly crystallized in 2–5 seconds to form a highly reflective (glossy) and dense surface. The entire process took place in an alarmingly short time and caused the MAPbI3 perovskite film to transform from a defective state to a healed state. It was shown that after the MIDH treatment, the (110) crystalline peak of the perovskite phase (Fig. 1c and d), the flatness (Fig. 1e), and photoluminescence (PL) signal and uniformity (Fig. 1f) were significantly increased, which is attributed to the higher density and quality of the perovskite films. As a result, the short-circuit current (JSC, 13.5 to 19.6 mA cm−2), the VOC (0.72 to 1.08 V), and the fill factor (FF, 58.6 to 71.4%) increased after MIDH, which led to a significant increase in the total power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5.7% to 15.1%, as summarized in Table 1.

After this pioneering work, the MIDH process has drawn worldwide research attention both from the academia and the industries due to the easy process and prospectives for scalable implementation. In order to better control the gas loading and the healing process, different treatment configurations have been developed, as summarized in Fig. 2, and the photovoltaic performance using MDIH treatment is tabulated in Table 1. The perovskite film is obtained by simple spin coating and annealing at 100 °C. Then, the film is placed on a glass Petri dish containing the MA/ethyl alcohol (EA) solution at room temperature (Fig. 2a), and the MA gas is volatilized and adsorbed by the film, which causes the film to turn transparent. When the film is removed from the MA atmosphere, the film desorbs the MA gas, and change back to black and shiny. The MA gas can also be obtained by reacting MACl powders and KOH, and a layer of calcium oxide is used to prevent moisture from affecting the perovskite (Fig. 2b). It is also possible to put the film into a closed container and control the partial pressure of MA by controlling the amount of MA entering (Fig. 2c), and the MA gas can be removed by heating or N2 insufflation. It is even feasible to add MA/EA solution to the perovskite precursor solution (Fig. 2d).
The effect of MIDH on the film defects was probed by electron energy loss spectroscopic (EELS) study of the cross section of solar cells with a pristine perovskite and an MA-treated perovskite layer by Conings et al. The rough shape and uneven covering of perovskite film causes the contact between the ETL and HTL, leading to a leakage of current and poor carrier extraction. It was observed that the MA treated sample completely penetrated the perovskite in the mesoporous TiO2, while in the untreated sample there was a significant void in the region below the large perovskite structure, which may hinder electron collection. It was particularly prone to stacking defects during the rapid evaporation of DMF, which resulted in the observed pores. The spiro-OMeTAD penetrated into these observed pores, resulting an alternating layer of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/Au that was disadvantageous in terms of energy level alignment, thus leading to a reduced VOC of the corresponding device and depriving them of better electron blocking capability, which in turn affected the FF.
The reaction PbI2 + MAI → MAPbI3 is considered as the neutralization reaction of the electrophile PbI2 (acid) and the nucleophile MAI (base). However, the interaction between the two salts is relatively weak due to their low acidity/alkalinity, thus resulting in slow insertion kinetics of the MAI species into the two-dimensional layered PbI64− octahedral array. The new HPbI3–MA precursor for the formation of the MAPbI3 perovskite was developed by Pang et al. As compared with the conventional PbI2–MAI precursor, the perovskite formation using the HPbI3–MA precursor is driven by the strong acid–base interaction between H+ and MA. In the HPbI3 structure, the Pb–I bonds are fully formed, whereas for the conventional PbI2–MAI precursor, the intercalation reaction of PbI2 with MAI entails the formation of new Pb–I bonds.
Grain boundary is a kind of body defect that has an adverse effect on the performance of PSC devices. Thermally induced recrystallization under MA atmosphere (TIRMA) instead of natural volatilization to passivate the grain boundary defects was reported by Jacos et al. They recrystallized the perovskite film by heating the intermediate of perovskite and MA for 2 minutes at 100 °C to obtain high quality and uniform large area MAPbI3 film with grain size up to 10 μm. Compared to the original film, the sample treated by the TRIMA method shows a 2-order-magnitude increase in the XRD peak intensity and reduction in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) diffraction peak (from 0.1061 to 0.0681°), thus confirming the significantly enhanced crystallinity. The FWHM of the characteristic peaks in the PL spectrum reduces from 74 to 46 nm, indicating a decrease in the grain boundary defects.
MA post-annealing (MPA) method was further proposed by Jiang et al. Compared with the traditional MIDH method, the MPA method showed obvious advantages: (I) After the perovskite is spin-coated, it is directly annealed in the MA atmosphere. This means that residual solvents (such as DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) are evaporated from the perovskite film in the MA gas atmosphere during the annealing process. This greatly improves the inward and outward diffusion of MA during the formation of the perovskites, resulting in large area uniformity. (II) According to the Arrhenius equation, the rate constant of the reaction kinetics increases by several orders of magnitude with increasing reaction temperature; therefore, the fusion effect of MA is significantly increased. They also compared thermal annealing (TA) and DMF solvent annealing (SA) methods, and found that GB impurities were greatly reduced and the carrier recombination in the perovskite layer is inhibited in the MPA sample. The formation of disconnected grains during the evaporation of the residual solvent was avoided and almost eliminated the possibility of direct contact between ETL and HTL. The MPA treated device showed a high PCE of 18.4%, compared to 17.1% for TA and 13.3% for SA devices, respectively.
Jen et al. confirmed the core importance of inorganic halides in the coordination reaction of MA by using different perovskite materials, which is consistent with the report by Cui et al. By studying the conversion of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 in different MA vapor pressures, the formation of MAPbI3 was due to proton transfer between MA and FAPbI3. The formation of I2 at low partial pressure and the conversion to I− at low partial pressure of MA, which is hardly generated at high partial pressure, is also reported. It is reported that most perovskite precursor solutions are actually colloidal dispersions. Lewis bases (such as DMSO) have been found to coordinate with lead(II) ions, with a lone pair of electrons on the N atom, and MA can also act as a complexing agent. Liu et al. studied the coordinated effects of MA by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. They observed that the colloidal particle radius follows a Gaussian distribution and the reference sample has a peak at ∼1000 nm. With the addition of MA/EA and EA, the colloidal particle radii decreased to approximately ∼300 and ∼800 nm, respectively. This indicates that MA/EA and EA interact with the colloid in the precursor solution to trim the large particles into smaller ones. In solution, MA and EA can act as ligands for the coordination of Pb(II) ions and compete with other ligands such as I− and DMF. On the other hand, it effectively suppresses I2 impurities, which are generally considered to be interstitial defects during film processing. They added MA/EA to the perovskite precursor solution to reduce the defect density and improve the quality of the perovskite film.
It has been reported that PbI2 at the grain boundaries contributes to the passivation of defects but excess of PbI2 can lead to performance and stability degradation. Zhang et al. demonstrated the controllable formation of grain boundary PbI2 nanoplate passivated MAPbI3 perovskite for high performance solar cells with an efficiency of up to 17.8%. A PbI2 passivated planar perovskite film was readily prepared by direct gas/solid reaction of a hydrogen halogen-deficient PbI2·xHI precursor with MA gas. The amount of PbI2 impurities can be controlled by adjusting the hydrogen halide deficiency in the precursor. PbI2 is formed at the grain boundaries between the perovskite crystals with a controlled amount to effectively passivate the perovskite film and promote charge separation.
A high-efficiency gas–solid reaction of PbI2, MA gas, and hydroiodic acid (HI) gas was reported by Raga et al. to prepare high quality perovskite films. In ambient air, MA gas reacts directly with PbI2 to form a stoichiometric CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (eqn (3)). Due to the high permeability of the MA gas and the 2D layered structure of PbI2, the reaction is completed in a few seconds. This process also resulted in the formation of a relatively large amount of lead oxide and lead hydroxide as by-products (eqn (3)–(5)), which could be removed by post-treatments, such as HI gas exposure (eqn (6) and (7)) or simultaneous HI and MA gas treatment, thus resulting in a high quality perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 3, this conversion was proven to be universal for a variety of halogen anions. Besides, the mixed-anion perovskites can be formed by exposure to different hydrogen halide gases (except for PbCl2 treated by HI, which can only form CH3NH3PbI3)
3PbI2 + 2CH3NH2 + H2O → 2CH3NH3PbI3 + PbO
(3)
CH3NH2 + H2O → CH3NH3OH
(4)
3PbI2 + 2CH3NH3OH → 2CH3NH3PbI3 + Pb(OH)2
(5)
PbO + 2HI → PbI2 + H2O
(6)
Pb(OH)2 + 2HI → PbI2 + 2H2O

It has been widely recognized that the efficiency of PSCs is directly related to the defects in semiconductor materials; understanding and controlling these defects in perovskite materials is critical to further improve the PCEs. Fortunately, the major defects in perovskites are known to produce very shallow traps near the conduction band and the valence band. This is the main reason for the unexpectedly high PCE for PSCs, although the perovskite deposited from the solution contains many defects. However, theoretical calculations indicate that in addition to the vacancies (VMA, VPb, and VI) and interstitial atoms (MAi, Pbi, and Ii), cationic substitutions (MAPb and PbMA) and reverse substitutions (MAI, PbI, IMA, and IPb) are also possible. The defects caused by cation and reverse substitutions that form deeper pits below or above the valence band are directly related to the decrease in PSC performance.

It has been previously reported that small molecule Lewis base solvents such as water, acetone, acetonitrile, nitromethane, isopropanol, DMF, and DMSO can reversibly penetrate the perovskite crystal lattice. A small Lewis base is easily inserted by hydrogen bonding interaction to destroy the three-dimensional perovskite structure. The decomposition of perovskite starts from the grain boundary of the film, in which H2O can react easily with the perovskite film because the chemical bond at the grain boundary of low crystallinity is weaker than the chemical bond in the crystal. Monoclinic MAPbI3·H2O is an initial degradation product, in which MA+ and H2O are linked by a H-bond. Therefore, if there are lattice vacancies (I, MA+) at the grain boundary, the H2O molecules can be conveniently accommodated inside, thus forming a H-bond with MA to accelerate the degradation process. The degradation process took place as shown in eqn (8) and (9). On the other hand, the presence of trace amounts of I2 in the perovskite films leads to severe degradation of the perovskites.
CH3NH3PbI3(s) + H2O(g) → CH3NH3PbI3·H2O(s)
(8)
CH3NH3PbI3·H2O(s) → PbI2(s) + HI(g) + CH3NH2(g) + H2O(g)
(9)
Therefore, Jacos et al. and Jiang et al. introduced the annealing process into the MIDH method to obtain larger grains and to decrease the grain boundary. Moreover, the hydrophobic macromolecules such as BA, IM, and 4-FAL are introduced at the grain boundary to prevent H2O invasion and to passivate the defects. There were two main possible mechanisms for the MIDH treatment, one of which is the shielding effect. The coordination binding energies of MA and H2O with lead(II) from the calculation results are 80.04 and 29.1 kJ mol−1, respectively. This means that the bonding strength of MA–Pb bonding (Pb–N) is 3.63 times stronger than that of the common H-bonding in water. The much stronger binding energy of MA–Pb(II) than that of H2O–Pb(II) rules out the possibility of H2O adsorption in association. The other one is redox reaction. Huang et al. indicated that the performance of PSCs after MIDH treatment is maintained at 80% of the original devices without encapsulation in air, while the performance of PSCs without MIDH treatment shows a sharp decrease only in 10 days. Due to its low redox potential, I− is easily oxidized to I2, which are generally considered to be interstitial defects during film processing, and the addition of MA can eliminate the residual I2 in the film, in which the disproportionation reaction of I2 occurs with the introduction of MA under alkaline conditions (ref. 49). Liu et al. indicated that the film stability after MA treatment is improved because the ions in the highly crystalline perovskite film have high chemical binding energy to prevent self-migration, which contributes to light and thermal stability.Fig. 4a shows the factors that influence film stability of the perovskites. After MA treatment, the films have better crystal orientation, fewer defects, and fewer grain boundaries than the pristine film.
In order to obtain the carrier relaxation characteristics, Zhang et al. performed electronic impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the range from 100 Hz to 4 MHz for solar cells under light with different bias voltages. The carrier lifetime τ can be calculated as τ = 1/(2πfp), where fp is the angular frequency of the characteristic peak. The τ of the original and repaired MAPbI3 films is 1.15 and 5.58 μs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, compared to the original film, the carrier lifetime of the repaired MAPbI3 film showed a relatively weak decrease with an increase in the bias voltage, indicating excellent sustained characteristics of carrier diffusion, which is attributed to the preferred (110) orientation of the perovskite film repaired with MA gas.
In addition, Zhang et al. fabricated thin film field effect transistor (FET) devices to measure the mobility of the MAPbI3 films, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. The mobility at VSD = 1 V was calculated to be 10.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 22.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the original MAPbI3 and MIDH treated film, respectively. Obviously, the repaired MAPbI3 film has a much higher mobility than the original film, indicating superior carrier transport characteristics, which are attributed to the reduction in grain boundaries or the increase in grain size.
As shown in Fig. 4e, Liu et al. characterized the evolution of space-charge-limited current (SCLC) under different bias voltage with the structure of FTO/perovskite/Au and derived the defect density (Nt) in the perovskite film. The estimated defect densities of the 1.1 μm thick MAPbI3(Cl) film and the MAPbI3 film prepared by the HPbI3(Cl)/MA method are 2.13 × 1015 and 2.51 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. These defect density values were significantly lower than that of the anti-solvent method (1.48 × 1017 cm−3).
The presence of surface traps in perovskites, resulting from under-coordinated ions or structural defects, can significantly affect the photophysical processes and damage the device behavior. Zhou et al. examined the steady-state PL on PSCs by confocal laser scanning microscopy and the spectrum is shown in Fig. 4f. As the MA treatment time gradually changes, the PL intensity increases, indicating an increase in radiation recombination due to a decrease in the concentration of surface traps. In addition, they also observed a progressive blue shift in PL as the MA gas treatment time increased (the dotted arrow in Fig. 4f). Unfortunately, the underlying reason for this shift was unexplored.
Time-resolved PL of MAPbI3 at 760 nm on a mesoporous ZrO2 scaffold prepared by one-step drop-casting was reported by Hong et al., as shown in Fig. 4h, with a double exponential decay function fit curve. The fast decay process is derived from Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, while the slow decay process is derived from the direct recombination of free carriers. The lifetimes of the above two processes for pristine MAPbI3 perovskite films are 1.49 ns (31.27%) and 8.09 ns (68.73%), respectively, with an average lifetime of 6.03 ns. For the MIDH perovskite film, these values are 33.38 ns (44.53%) and 142.29 ns (55.47%), respectively, and the average lifetime is 93.79 ns, which is 15 times larger than that of the pristine film. An increase in the lifetime of SRH recombination after MA treatment was observed, indicating a decrease in the recombination center.

Zong et al. first investigated the effect of composition on the transformation behavior in the precursor films and explored the generality of this behavior in other APbX3 compounds. It was observed that the halogen anions had no significant effect on the whole chemical transformation process. For A cation, when A site is occupied by non-volatile inorganic cations (for example, Cs+), there is no H+ site in the structure, so cationic substitution reaction will not occur. As a result, after the interaction between CsPbI3 and MA, only the less stable embedded compound CsPbI3·xMA was formed, which was converted to CsPbI3 after mild heating. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) results show that the bond between protonated MA+ (CH3NH3+) and [PbX6] is an order of magnitude stronger than the bond between MA and [PbX6], which highlights the importance of the presence of H+ in the precursor film for transformation into the transparent intermediate phase. Moreover, the conversion of (C16H33NH3)2PbI4 to MAPbI3 does not occur when long chain lead alkylammonium iodide were used because the complete replacement of heavy C16H33NH3+ cations using MA is difficult, thus indicating that the relative volatility of component A is also an important factor in the transformation behavior.

The conversion of NH4PbI3 non-perovskites to MAPbI3 perovskites by cation exchange was first realized by Zong et al. Using the MIDH method, the photo-insensitive material (porous, coarse, polycrystalline NH4PbI3, non-perovskite film) is gradually converted into an excellent photoactive material (dense, ultra-smooth, textured MAPbI3). The conversion of the components was observed by XRD and 2D XRD patterns from the initial NH4PbI3 film (stage 1) to MA gas treatment (stage 2), followed by the bleached state (stage 3), and finally to the pure MAPbI3 state (stage 4), as shown in Fig. 5b and c.
The yellow non-perovskite photoactive (1D) phase δ-FAPbI3 (Eg = 2.88 eV) acts as a parasitic phase during the formation of α-FAPbI3 and is always considered as a “garbage” product. However, it has recently been found that the accompanying presence of δ-FAPbI3 can stabilize the α-FAPbI3 structure and have no adverse effects on its absorption. Moreover, the FAPbI3 film treated with MA gas must be completely converted to δ-FAPbI3; although MA gas can convert FAPbI3 to MAPbI3 through cation substitution reaction but the reaction rate is slow.
The assumed photo-insensitive δ-FAPbI3 was formed in situ by MA gas treatment on the MA/FA alloy perovskite film, which acts as an organic scaffold on the interior and on the surface of the perovskite film to passivate the trap states, enhance the tunneling contact between the perovskite and the carrier transport layer, and limit the organic-cation diffusion. In this way, the device PCE is increased from 18% to 21% and the phase structure is also stabilized. As shown in the XRD pattern of MA gas treated MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 perovskite film (Fig. 5d and e, g-FA20), the (110) diffraction peak was shifted from 14.11° back to 14.15°, which is identical to the MA gas treated pure MAPbI3 perovskite film (Fig. 5d and e, g-MA). At the same time, a non-negligible diffraction peak appeared near 11.5°, indicating the formation of a 1D (PbI3−)n chain polymorph (expressed as δ-FAPbI3), which is consistent with the FAPbI3 film treated by MA gas (Fig. 5d and e, g-FA).
The morphological retention of MAPbI3 → FAPbI3 perovskite conversion was first realized by Zhou et al. using the following single cation displacement reaction:
MAPbI3(s) + FA(g) ⇌ FAPbI3(s) + MA(g)
(10)

Eqn (10) involves the reduction of MA+ to MA and oxidation of FA to FA+. As shown in Fig. 5f and g, the MAPbI3 perovskite film was simply exposed to FA gas (150 °C, 4 minutes) to complete the MAPbI3 → FAPbI3 conversion while maintaining the film morphology. In detail, FA gas (boiling point ∼ 90 °C) was produced by reacting formamidine acetate with sodium hydroxide at 150 °C and dehydrating with CaO desiccant. The hot FA gas then reacted with the pre-deposited MAPbI3 film. Partial or complete conversion of MAPbI3 to FAPbI3 is achieved by performing a reaction for a specific duration (up to 4 minutes). Similarly, the FAPbI3 film can be converted to MAPbI3 although the process is very slow, thus confirming the limited reversibility of eqn (10). Note that the overall MAPbI3 → FAPbI3 phase transition kinetics is an order of magnitude faster than the ion exchange process in the solvents reported by Eperon et al. due to fundamentally different conversion mechanisms. In the ion exchange process, perovskite conversion is carried out by gradual alloying of FA+ to MAPbI3 until an equilibrium in the solid–liquid system is reached, in which a FA+-rich perovskite alloy (FAxMA1−xPbI3) is the final product. The slow reaction kinetics allows sufficient time for the FA+ and MA+ to mix throughout the film. However, during the cation replacement process, the reaction was faster and the reaction proceeded until the MAPbI3 phase was depleted.
Wang et al. further expanded the conversion and found that when the R1NH3+ based organic iodide is treated with another micromolecular alkylamine (R2NH2), the following proton exchange equilibrium results in the system, consisting of two alkylamines and two alkylammoniums:
R1NH3+ + R2NH2 ↔ R2NH3+ + R1NH2
(11)
These amines and ammonium compete with each other to coordinate with Pb2+ and to form certain R2NH2 soluble intermediates. After the R2NH2 vapor is removed and heated, it is converted to a new iodide of R2NH3+. Fig. 6a shows an example of proton exchange of 3 different alkylamines. It is noteworthy that the ease of conversion mainly depends on the volatility of the amine. This is because R2NH2 is always in a large excess compared to R1NH3+ in the conversion. If R1NH2 is volatile, it will be easily removed from the system and the conversion will be easy. This provides a new idea for the preparation of perovskite films with lower dimensionality. For example, a yellow solid film was obtained by subjecting the MAPbI3 film to BA gas. XRD characterization indicated the formation of the BA2PbI4; expectedly, PbI2 was produced as the by-product (in Fig. 6b and c). Therefore, the cation substitution reaction of amines occurs in an equimolar ratio. If the stoichiometric composition before and after the conversion is different, the corresponding adjustment is necessary. Taking MAPbI3 and BA2PbI4 as an example, if the initial film is MAPbI3, the film will be converted to BA2PbI4 perovskite film with PbI2 contaminants after BA treatment, as shown in Fig. 6b and c, and in eqn (12). If the initial film is prepared from a DMF solution containing PbI2 and 2 eq. MAI, the film will be converted to a pure BA2PbI4 perovskite film without PbI2 contaminants, as shown in Fig. 6b and c, and in eqn (13).
MAPbI3(s) + BA(g) → BA2PbI4(s) + PbI2(s) + MA(g)
(12)
MAPbI3(s) + MAI(s) + BA(g) → BA2PbI4(s) + MA(g)
(13)
Two-dimensional perovskites (2DPs) have better light, humidity, and thermal stress stability compared to 3D perovskites. Therefore, the combination of high stability of 2D components and high efficiency of 3D structures has become a trend recently. However, the performance will greatly reduce with a slight increase in the 2DP doping using a direct mixing method. Therefore, in order to maintain the high PCE of 3DP, it is desirable to use a post-treatment technique, in which a trace amount of 2DPs was introduced at the surface of 3D perovskite and was not destructive to the original perovskite. Generally, there are two types of post-processing methods. One is solvent or steam annealing, which is destructive due to the coordination effects and leads to recrystallization. The other one is solution post-treatment, in which isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or chlorobenzene solutions are used to dissolve alkylamines and polymers for trap passivation and performance improvement.
As a macromolecular dipole, 4-fluoroaniline (FAL) can provide a dipole field for charge separation, which facilitates the transfer of holes, and fluorination imparts it hydrophobicity, which contributes to humidity stability. The alkalinity of FAL is reduced by the aromatic ring and the conjugated amine of the fluorine substituent (pKb (FAL) = 10.8, pKb (aniline) = 9.94, pKb (MA) = 3.38, pKb (benzylamine) = 4.66). As a result, FAL acts as an anti-solvent for perovskites over a wide range of temperatures and time. Zhao et al. controllably passivated perovskite with FAL through a vacuum-free hot vapor assisted colloidal process (HVACP). The molecular exchange between MA/FA and FAL on the surface and grain boundaries occurred, forming an ultra-stable layer instead of the MA/FA vacancies. This treatment does not interfere with the overall quality of the original perovskite film and will repair the grain boundaries at the interface, resulting in the enhanced luminescence performance, stability, and charge transfer.
Imidazolium (IM) iodide was doped with a high concentration (10–30 mol%) of perovskite by Zhang et al. Given that the pKb (base dissociation constant) of methylamine is 3.24 and the pKb of imidazole is about 7, as the IMxMA1−xPbI3 membrane is exposed to MA gas, the deprotonation of IM cations occurs with the formation of MA cations, thus releasing the neutral IMD. The resulting neutral imidazole (IMD) is extruded from the 3D perovskite crystal and distributed around the crystal, resulting in automatic passivation of the crystal defects, as shown in eqn (14).
IMPbI3 + MA → MAPbI3 + IMD
(14)
Compared to the reference material, IM0.1MA0.9PbI3 with MA gas treatment shows a larger grain size, a smoother surface, and less carrier recombination. As the dopant concentration increases, the grain size increases correspondingly. However, the amorphous substance attached to the film increases as the IMI content increases, which seems to separate the crystals and is not conducive for electron transport.
A novel method for constructing a 2D/3D stacked structure by reacting 3D perovskites with n-butylamine (BA) was reported by Lin et al. Unlike the conventional treatment of n-butylammonium iodide (BAI), in which BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 2D perovskite phases with different n values were formed (in Fig. 7a, c and e), the reaction of BA with MAPbI3 only produces two-dimensional BA2PbI4 perovskites, as shown in Fig. 7b–d. Compared with the BAI treatment, the BA treatment produces a smoother 2D perovskite layer on the 3D perovskite, forming a thinner 2D perovskite layer at the grain boundary than that formed in the BAI treatment, thus resulting in zero effect on the carrier transport. Therefore, the defects were passivated; meanwhile, a protective layer was formed to improve the coverage, stability, and flatness, thereby improving the efficiency. Other methods such as anti-solvent containing methylamine and benzylamine have also been mentioned for improving the quality of the perovskite film and passivation of the defects.
Due to the face-centered cubic crystal structure, CsBr has a very strong Cs–Br ion bond of about 4 eV per molecule energy, which is much larger than the van der Waals interlayer interaction in PbI2. Therefore, it is difficult for MA molecules to break the Cs–X–Pb chemical bond in the inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite phase and form a liquid mesophase (in Fig. 8a). As shown in Fig. 8c and d, there is no difference in the XRD patterns of CsPbI3 before and after the MVPT method. To solve this problem, an excess (0.5 M) of MAX was introduced into the initial CsPbX3 film to form a mixed cationic perovskite structure (⋯MA–X–Pb–X–Cs⋯), as reported by Shao et al. It was found that the MA+ site can be used as a breakthrough site for inhaling a large amount of MA molecules, rapidly forming a flowing liquid intermediate phase, and finally achieving MA gas healing of the inorganic perovskite film (in Fig. 8b). In addition, the following thermal evaporation of the sacrificial organic component can further induce the Ostwald ripening process so as to improve the film crystallinity (shown in Fig. 8e). Therefore, a high-quality pinhole-free CsPbI2Br perovskite layer was deposited and the VOC of the PSC increased from 1.11 V to 1.25 V with a maximum PCE of 13.1%.
Change et al. further revealed that CsI can also melt under the atmosphere of MA. Benefiting from this phenomenon, a 10% Cs+-doped MAPbI3 perovskite film was deposited by the MIDH method. It was found that Cs can be incorporated into the crystal lattice and the PCE increased from 15% to 17%. Most importantly, the PbI6 octahedron deformation was reduced with non-polar Cs doping, in which the breaking of the Pb–I bond is suppressed along the c-axis and the (110) orientation is improved, which is important for improving the humidity stability.

For the scale up and commercialization of the PSCs, the toxicity, repeatability, cost, and recycling are all important indexes. Through low-cost deposition technologies such as blade coating, screen printing and inkjet printing, the thick heterojunction can provide a large area, high yield, and repeatable light absorbing layer, in which problems such as thickness variations and pinhole defects are easy to occur. However, the defects increase exponentially with increasing film volume, therefore perovskite films with low defect density are highly necessary for industrial applications.

So far, lead-based organic–inorganic perovskites have been invariably used as light-absorbing layers for high-efficiency PSCs, while organic–inorganic perovskites have poor humidity stability, resulting in the degradation and precipitation of PbI2 (eqn (9)), which leads to severe cardiovascular diseases, developmental diseases, neurological diseases, and reproductive diseases. Therefore, it is essential for overcoming the toxicity challenge in perovskite-based solar cells by replacing Pb with other environment friendly absorbers. In this regard, Sn2+ is considered to be a promising alternative to Pb2+ due to the similar ionic radius (Sn2+: 112 pm, Pb2+: 119 pm) and electronic configuration (ns2), which has a crucial impact on the optical and electronic properties of the perovskite materials. The charge neutrality of the perovskite is destructive due to the oxidation of SnII to SnIV, thus resulting in the formation of the oxide/hydroxide of Sn and MAI. Bismuth (Bi) is also a good choice, with a fairly effective ionic radius (Bi3+ = 103 pm, Pb2+ = 119 pm), electronic configuration, and similar electronegativity (Bi: 2.02 and Pb: 2.33), thus providing strong light absorption and long carrier lifetime. More importantly, it is much less toxic than lead and has been used in organic synthesis and pharmaceuticals. However, the efficiency of Sn-based and Bi-based perovskites is not very high.
The cation substitution reaction was used for the preparation of Bi-based perovskites by Li et al. MA cation substitution was performed on the PA3Bi2I9 film to obtain a dense and uniform MA3Bi2I9 film, while the one-step MA3Bi2I9 film showed a poor morphology and micron-sized pinholes, resulting in a lower photocurrent. The champion device obtained by cation substitution showed a PCE of 0.33%, compared with 0.15% PCE for the one step film.
As a distinct advantage, perovskites can be formed by low-cost solution processing. However, since the lead halide salts are hardly or completely insoluble in most of the solvents commonly used in large-scale deposition techniques, it is necessary to use toxic, highly coordinated, high-boiling aprotic solvents (mainly DMF, DMSO, γ-butyrolactone (γ-GBL), and dimethylacetamide (DMA)), which form uniform films on large areas with great difficulty and are also difficult to remove completely. Noel et al. introduced a new low boiling, low viscosity solvent MA/acetonitrile (ACN) to deposit the perovskite film. ACN is a low boiling, highly polar aprotic solvent, which is commonly used for non-aqueous ink; however, PbI2 is completely insoluble in ACN, so the introduction of MA dissolves MAPbI3 by forming the co-ligand MAPbI3·MA, while MA can be easily dissolved in ACN. Using this solvent, a dense, pinhole-free film is obtained by rapid crystallization at room temperature with uniform coverage, high specular reflectance, and enhanced optoelectronic performance.
Currently, long term operational stability can be considered one of the major issues in the commercial applications of PSCs. The correct identification of these released gases is one of most significant ways to prevent degradation and to extend the stability of the MA+ based PSCs, which can be regarded as the best strategy for device encapsulation. Juarez-Perez et al. studied two degradation pathways (CH3NH2 + HX and CH3X + NH3) that occur simultaneously under ambient temperature and vacuum conditions. Under different temperature conditions, the release of CH3I and NH3 is understood to be a thermodynamically favorable degradation pathway, and CH3NH2 and HI release is a kinetically favorable process. Due to the uniqueness of the CH3NH2 and HX reaction product, the perovskite can be reversibly generated in the presence of PbI2 (eqn (15)). Unfortunately, due to the diversity of reaction products, such as N(CH3)4I, CH3NH3I, and NH4I, MAI can be irreversibly lost in the CH3I and NH3 reaction (eqn (16)). There are two ways to retard this MAI loss. One is to improve the tightness of the encapsulation and prevent the escape of CH3NH2 and HI gases. The other is to prevent the degradation of perovskite to NH3 and CH3I gases.
HI + CH3NH2 → CH3NH3I
(15)
CH3I + NH3 → N(CH3)4I + CH3NH3I + NH4I
(16)
A new deposition route for MAPbI3 perovskite films has been reported by Chen et al., which does not rely on the use of common solvents or vacuum. The perovskite was formed by pressing MAI·mMA (m = 3) and the PbI2·nMA (n = 1) amine complex precursor to desorb the MA (as shown in Fig. 9a). As shown by the results of 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and FTIR (Fourier transform infra-red), CH3NH3X (X = Cl, Br, I), PbX2 (X = Cl, Br, I), and MA can form complexes due to the proton exchange or hydrogen bond between –NH2 and positive –NH3+, and the interaction between –NH2 and Pb2+, respectively. Besides, the interaction force was so weak that MA could be easily desorbed. The perovskite grain size increased significantly from 300 nm to 1 μm, and the uniformity of the large-area film and the crystallinity improved remarkably, compared with the conventional spin-coating process (in Fig. 9b).
Compared to the thin perovskite films, the thick films can have better light utilization and reproducibility but the higher presence of defects can induce more carrier recombination. So far, high efficiency PSCs mainly have perovskite films with thickness ranging from 400 to 800 nm. Liu et al. prepared a perovskite film with a thickness of more than 1 μm under ambient conditions by the MVPT method (in Fig. 9c). It was found that the crystallinity was improved and the defect concentration was reduced due to the passivation of defects by Cl doping and MVPT methods, thus resulting in a better reproducibility, and moisture and thermal stability.
A prototype reactor was developed to perform coordination engineering between low partial pressure MA vapor and HPbI3 solid, and to facilitate the large-scale fabrication of perovskite films by Long et al. The perovskite films show smooth and mirror-like uniform surface produced on a large scale by this prototype reactor (Fig. 9d). It consists primarily of a MA gas cylinder, a critical pressure buffer for controlling the MA partial pressure, a reaction chamber for reaction with MA, and a large area drawer for final perovskite transport (Fig. 9e). The MA-rich passivation through Pb–N bonding at the interface and boundary contributes to the substantially improved stability. Besides, the MA-rich atmosphere triggers an anti-degradation reaction in the presence of moisture and thus endows stability above two months under ∼65% humidity.
Huang et al. combined a hot casting technique (HC) and MIDH to produce a dense and uniform perovskite (MAPbI3) film under ambient conditions of about 60% relative humidity. They showed significant humidity stability, which retained 60% of the original efficiency without encapsulation in air for 60 days, compared to the PSCs prepared by the anti-solvent method (nearly inefficient after 35 days). Unlike others, the perovskite film does not need to be annealed after the MIDH method, which results in excess MA combination with the infiltrated moisture to reduce the erosion by moisture of the perovskite at the grain boundaries. At the same time, with the slow evaporation of excess MA, the infiltrated water can be taken away. The positive evolution of eqn (9) is inhibited due to the residual MA, resulting in the slow decomposition of perovskite.
Recycling is another important issue in the scale up of PSCs. Due to their limited lifespan, the management of the disassembled parts and waste cannot be avoided; thus, resources are consumed and environmental problems are caused. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the service life of photovoltaic power generation and achieve an effective way for sustainable circulation. McDonald and Pearce analyzed the existing agreements for five major types of commercial PV materials, and quantified the amount of recyclable materials and glass in a 1 square meter solar module. However, after the end of device life, only the corresponding materials but not the entire photovoltaic device could be recovered. For PSCs, Ku et al. suggested that the perovskite material can be reloaded into a mesoscopic device multiple times, thus demonstrating that the mesoscopic scaffold is reusable. Binek et al. reported a procedure for removing each layer of solar cells and indicated that PbI2 could be reused for the preparation of new solar cells. However, all of these methods involve component disassembly and reorganization.
In this regard, Hong et al. reported that the crystals of the perovskite films deposited on triple-layer mesoporous TiO2/ZrO2/carbon can be reconstructed by post-treating the MAPbI3 devices with MA gas and then a compact perovskite layer is obtained with a high PCE up to 15.26% (Fig. 9f). This MIDH process allows the regeneration of the photo-degraded PSCs via crystal reconstruction and the PCE can recover to 91% of the initial value after two cycles of the photo-degradation-recovery process. More importantly, this simple method and specific cell structure allow for the regeneration of PSCs without reconstruction or replacement of any of the components, thus prolonging the service life of the PSCs. Fig. 10a shows the schematics of the cycle of photo-degradation-recovery of the MAPbI3 film at different stages (degradation and recovery). It can be observed that the PCE could recover from 40% to 91% of the initial level in both the cycles. As the photo-degradation-regeneration cycle increases, the iodide content becomes less and less due to the volatilization of HI, according to eqn (9). Therefore, the mitigation of iodide deficiency by resupplying is necessary for permanent recycling. Fig. 10b shows the XRD spectra of the degraded/regenerated perovskite films in each cycle on the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold. As can be seen, the PbI2 peak (2θ = 14.6°) occurred after the degradation and disappeared after the regeneration. In addition, the peak strength of perovskite (110) decreased sharply after degradation and increased again after regeneration, indicating the effective regeneration of the degraded perovskite film. The energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) further verified the iodide deficiency caused by degradation, for the I/Pb molar ratio of 3.21, 2.70, 3.02, 2.41, and 2.94, respectively, as shown in Fig. 10c. As MAPbI3 is decomposed into PbI2, the molar ratio of I/Pb decreases after each cyclic degradation, while it increases again after MIDH regeneration due to crystal reconstruction, as shown in Fig. 10d.

In this review, we discussed the defects of perovskites from viewpoint of stability and decomposition, and introduced a new method for preparing low-defect perovskite films, i.e., MIDH and its derivative methods. This method can significantly improve the crystallinity and film flatness of the perovskite, and reduce the grain boundary defects. This method is applicable to various device structures, including normal and inverted planar structures, mesoporous structures, and triple mesoporous monolithic structures. Moreover, the cation substitution reaction provides novel pathways for the preparation of FAPbI3 with a narrower optical bandgap than MAPbI3 and two-dimensional (2D) perovskite films. The all-inorganic perovskite film could also be healed using this technique with an additional excess of MAI as the MIDH process initiator. The scale up and commercialization of the PSC techniques require thicker and larger areas of the absorbent layer, which inevitably leads to a huge increase in the defect densities. The MIDH method is undoubtedly a suitable and fast post-treatment method to improve the film quality and reduce the defects. More importantly, the MIDH process can regenerate the perovskite film to achieve the extension of lifetime without the reconstruction or replacement of the components.

However, there are still some open questions in this promising technique. As mentioned before, the widely investigated MAPbI3 perovskite obtained using this MIDH process is less ideal due to the slightly larger band gap than the ideal value for single junction photovoltaics, resulting in low photocurrent density of the resultant PSCs. α-FAPbI3 with a more suitable bandgap can be converted into δ-FAPbI3 in the atmosphere of MA gas, which indicates that the MIDH method is not suitable for the perovskite with a FA/MA mixed cation as the mainstream trend of high-efficiency PSCs nowadays. Therefore, a novel process for the precise control of FA/MA ratio is highly needed to further boost the PCE using this MDIH process. Long-term stability is another important issue governing the future development of the PSCs technology. For mixed dimension perovskites, a rapid cation substitution reaction results in the inability to form a mixed cationic perovskite after the MVPT method, which limits the diversity of its components and is also the reason that mostly pure phase perovskites have been reported. Due to the volatility of MA, its desorption from the MAPbI3·xMA intermediate phase can easily occur at room temperature, resulting in recrystallization of the perovskite. This rapid removal of MA makes the physical and chemical properties of the intermediate phase difficult to characterize, which is critical and urgent for further development of the MIDH method.
The FA-based perovskite with Cs-doping can be considered as the desired precursor for FA gas treatment as Cs+ cannot be substituted during the gas treatment and the perovskite phase of FAPbI3 can be stabilized by the addition of cesium instead of conversion to the yellow photo-insensitive δ-FAPbI3. Considering the rapid reaction of MIDH, the gentler displacement can be introduced for surface passivation. Meanwhile, more functional macromolecules, such as 4-fluoroaniline and IM, should be used for cation substitution. The recent work on machine learning also summarized the properties of the amines that are less reactive with the MAPbI3 perovskite film as the passivation layer. Due to the formation of MAPbI3·MA and the volatility, MA can be seen as a competitive green additive candidate.
The PCE of PSCs has experienced a rapid increase since the perovskites were first introduced as light-absorbing materials into solar cells in 2009 and currently, the highest certified PCE is as high as 24.2%. However, there is still a large gap between the recorded PCE value and the value defined by the Shockley–Queisser limit (ideal value of 33%), indicating that there is a large room for improvement in device performance. As a result, the defects in the perovskites and/or the defects at the interface with charge selecting layers have been widely recognized as one of the main reasons that limit the PCE of a device. The MIDH method is focused on reducing the grain boundary defects and improving the quality of the perovskite film. On the other hand, the traditional spin coating method wastes 90% of the raw material; therefore, blade coating, screen printing, inkjet printing, and other processing techniques are the future scale up trends. The MIDH process can find wide implementation in conjunction with these novel deposition techniques without changing the film thickness to passivate the defects, increase the carrier diffusion, and reduce the carrier recombination process. Moreover, the MIDH method has already shown notable advances in the regeneration and recycling of PSCs without the reconstruction or replacement of any of the components, thus prolonging the service life of the PSCs.
