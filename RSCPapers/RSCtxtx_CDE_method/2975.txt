Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) derivatives are one of the most important organic photovoltaic materials due to better π-conjugation across fused thiophene rings. In this work, two new hole transport materials (HTMs), H16 and H18, have been obtained through a facile synthetic route by cross linking triarylamine-based donor groups with a 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (MPDTP) and N-(4-(4H-dithieno[3,2 b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-4-yl)phenyl)-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (TPDTP) unit, respectively. The H16 HTM outperforms the H18 in terms of conductivity, hole mobility, and hole transport at the interface. This result could be attributed to the enhancement of the conductivity, hole mobility and high quality of the film exerted by the MPDTP core. The optimized device based on H16 exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.16%, which is comparable to that obtained with the state-of-the-art-HTM spiro-OMeTAD (18.27%). Furthermore, the long-term aging test shows that the H16 based device has good stability after two months of aging under controlled (20%) humidity in the dark. Importantly, the synthesis cost of H16 is roughly 1/5 of that of spiro-OMeTAD. The present finding highlights the potential of DTP based HTMs for efficient PSCs.

Since the first report by Miyasaka et al., perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained enormous attention in the past several years. PSCs combine many excellent properties such as efficient light harvesting, high charge-carrier mobility and long exciton diffusion length. Using mixed cations and halide materials, a PCE of over 20% has been achieved. In general, n–i–p junction PSCs are composed of an electron-transport layer (i.e. TiO2, SnO2), perovskite, and hole transport material. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis (N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is a state-of-the-art hole-transport material (HTM), featuring a spiro framework and four electron-rich arylamine substituents. However, the challenging synthesis routes and exorbitant cost of the spirobifluorene central core make spiro-OMeTAD a relatively expensive material. In addition, the PCE of PSCs highly depends on the sublimation grade of the spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, a wide number of HTMs including inorganic, polymer, and metal–organic compounds and small organic molecule HTMs have been synthesized and investigated.

Small organic compounds are one of the most studied HTMs because they are structurally simple and easy to synthesize. One strategy used for the design of small organic HTMs focuses on developing central cores. Initially, spiro-like derivatives were developed as central cores for small organic molecule HTMs. For example, Sun et al. reported a series of low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based HTMs, exhibiting impressive PCEs over 19%. Recently, Wang et al. established a new spiro skeleton based on spiro-phenylpyrazole-9,9′-thioxanthene for HTMs. They demonstrated that the PCE of PPyra-TXA (18.06%) surpasses that of spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that simple triarylamines such as carbazole and phenothiazine are good cores for constructing HTMs. In addition, thiophene derivatives such as cyclopentadithiophene and silolothiophene have been introduced as central cores for small organic molecule HTMs because of their high hole mobility and electrical conductivity. Nazeeruddin and co-workers have molecularly engineered a small molecule FDT (fluorene–dithiophene) HTM, yielding a PCE up to 20.2%. This work suggests that there is a strong adhesion and enhanced interfacial coupling between FDT and perovskite due to the thiophene–iodine interaction. These results demonstrated that the performance of small organic molecule HTMs highly depends on the design of central cores. In the race for exploring new central cores, we focus on fused thiophene derivatives because the thiophene–iodine interaction is beneficial for improving hole transport at the HTM/perovskite interface. In our previous work, we found that dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole(DTP) based organic dyes showed impressive photovoltaic performance for dye-sensitized solar cells. However, to the best of our knowledge, reports on HTMs based on DTP derivatives for PSCs are very limited.
In this work, we introduce 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (MPDTP) and N-(4-(4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-4-yl)phenyl)-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl) aniline (TPDTP) as new central cores for the H16 and H18 HTM (Scheme 1), respectively. This design allows us to understand the influences of substituent groups on the transporting properties of DTP HTMs. Recently, Dai and co-workers found that H-Tri with three 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylaniline (MMP) arms show better performance than the H-Di HTM with two arms. Unexpectedly, H16 with two MMP arms outperforms H18 with three MMP units in terms of conductivity, hole mobility and photovoltaic performance.
Experimental measurements have shown that the DTP core improves the conductivity and hole mobility of HTMs. Steady-state photoluminescence revealed that DTP HTMs achieved a highly efficient hole transfer yield over 96%. Devices fabricated with the H16 HTM achieved a PCE up to 18.16% under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which is close to the PCE of 18.27% obtained with the spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, the H18 HTM with three TPA arms shows a relatively lower PCE. Moreover, the long-term aging test reveals that the H16 based device has good stability after two months of aging under controlled (20%) humidity in the dark. Importantly, the synthetic cost of the HTM of H16 (182 RMB per g or 30 $ per g) is much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (1000 RMB per g or 166 $ per g, purchased from p-OLED (China)). The detailed cost evaluation of H16 can be found in the ESI. This finding suggests that DTP derivatives are promising building blocks for efficient HTMs.

The absorption spectra of H16 and H18 HTMs were recorded in dichloromethane (DCM) to evaluate their photophysical properties (absorption coefficients of both HTMs are presented in Fig. S1). The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1a shows the major absorption peaks of spiro-OMeTAD, H18, and H16 are at 383, 426, and 425 nm, respectively. Both the H16 and H18 DTP HTMs showed a red-shift in light absorption relative to that of spiro-OMeTAD, indicating that there is a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the subunit arms to the core in H16 and H18. This can further be confirmed by the frontier orbitals of HTMs, which were calculated using the Gaussian 09 program package. The molecular structure of H16 and H18 were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G level. The isodensity surface plots of HOMO and LUMO were constructed with Gaussview and are shown in Fig. 1b. It can be found that the HOMO is delocalized throughout both the triarylamine and MPDTP/TPDTP units, while the LUMO is primarily localized on the DTP core. Apparently, the electronegativity of sulfur atoms induces an intramolecular charge transfer and thus enhances the conjugation effect.

This deduction could further be confirmed using the calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) map (implemented in the Gaussian 09 program and constructed with Gaussview) shown in Fig. 1c. Red colour is concentrated at the DTP core, indicating that the negative electron is mainly distributed in the DTP core while the more electropositive part is spread out over the side triphenylamine units. Apparently, the strong dipole in H16 and H18 could facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer. In addition, the dihedral angles between triarylamine and MPDTP/TPDTP units are small, around 25°. This contributes to the conjugation between the two triphenylamine units of H16/H18. Recently, Zhang et al. introduced two double-bonds in HTM Z26. They found that a better conjugation effect is beneficial for a higher hole mobility. In this regard, the DTP core favours the higher hole mobility of HTMs. On the other hand, the effects of the substituents on HOMO/LUMO were found to be insignificant, indicating that both substituents on MPDTP/TPDTP are not involved in the lowest-level charge transfer. This leads to the same optical band gap (E0–0) for H16 and H18, being 2.65 eV. The E0–0 was determined from the intersections of the normalized absorption and emission spectra, which are exhibited in Fig. 1a.
The electrochemical properties of H16 and H18 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the DCM solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. As presented in Fig. 2a, the redox peaks of H16 and H18 are reversible, suggesting the high electrochemical stability of both HTMs. The HOMO values of H16 and H18 were calculated to be −4.97 and −4.96 eV, respectively, which are slightly higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.13 eV). Therefore, the open circuit voltage of PSCs based on H16 and H18 may be lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2b, the HOMO values of H16 and H18 are much higher than that of mixed-ion (FAI/MABr/PbI2/PbBr2/CsI) perovskite (−5.65 eV vs. vacuum), providing enough driving force for hole transport.

To estimate the photovoltaic performance of H16 and H18, two key parameters including conductivity and hole mobility were recorded. The conductivity of the doped HTMs was determined using a two-contact electrical conductivity set-up (glass/HTM/Ag). Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of in-plane hole-only devices based on the H16, H18 and spiro-OMeTAD. The conductivity obtained for H16, H18 and spiro-OMeTAD was 9.79 × 10−5, 7.92 × 10−5 and 8.76 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively. The conductivity of H16 is slightly higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD, while that of H18 is slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD.

The hole mobility of HTMs was investigated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using the Mott–Gurney equation. Their J–V curves and fitting results are shown in Fig. 3b. The hole mobility of H16, H18 and spiro-OMeTAD was determined to be 5.55 × 10−4, 2.33 × 10−4 and 2.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Clearly, the hole mobility of H16 is much higher than that of H18. This may be related to molecular ordering in the HTM layer. As shown in the inset pictures of Fig. 3b, H18 displays a cross geometry from the top view of the molecule, while H16 exhibits a planar structure. Therefore, the molecules of H16 could form a higher packing, which can improve the hole transport process at the perovskite–HTM interface.


Fig. 4a shows the reverse J–V curves of solar cells fabricated using spiro-OMeTAD, H16 and H18, respectively. The champion data of H16, H18 and spiro-OMeTAD are also presented in Table 2. In this work, cesium-containing triple cation perovskite solar cells were fabricated to estimate the photovoltaic performance of the target HTMs. Detailed information on device fabrication can be found in the ESI. Fig. S2 shows the typical device configuration of the H16 based PSC imaged by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Around 150 nm thick H16 films were deposited on the perovskite film, which was fabricated by a one-step method using the Cs/MA/FA perovskite precursor solution.

The difference in the DTP cores for H16 and H18 significantly influenced the photovoltaic performance of the DTP-based HTMs. The H16-based PSCs exhibited a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.28 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.108 V and a fill factor (FF) of 70.42%, yielding a PCE of 18.16% under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). This value is nearly on par with the PCE of the state-of-art HTM spiro-OMeTAD (18.27%), which displays a JSC of 22.92 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.123 V and a FF of 70.97. The superiority of H16 over spiro-OMeTAD is clear from the photocurrent, which can be observed from the incident photon to current (IPCE) spectra of the champion PSCs (devices shown in Fig. S3) displayed in Fig. 4b. In contrast, the JSC as well as the VOC of the H18 based PSCs are lower than those of spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, H18 displays a relatively lower photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 15.29%.
Similar hysteresis behaviours were observed for the three HTM based PSCs (Fig. S4). Nevertheless, the difference between the forward and reverse J–V characteristics is small. We think the hysteresis behaviour does not arise from the HTM, but from the intrinsic properties of the perovskite layer. Perovskite has ionic characteristics which can be segregated into positively charged and negatively charged ionic species leading to ion migration, and the accumulation of excess ions can facilitate the polarization of the perovskite to cause hysteresis. The average forward-reverse PCE follows the trend of spiro-OMeTAD (16.96%) > H16 (16.91%) > H18 (14.08%). In short, our results clearly show that the photovoltaic performance of H16 is comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD.
FF is another important photovoltaic parameter responsible for the difference in device performance between H16 and H18. Apparently, the FF of J–V curve (reverse) for H18 (FF = 62.82) is lower than that of H16 (FF = 70.42). It has been demonstrated that FF is sensitive to the photoactive layer/electrode interface, which can be determined from the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). In this work, Rs and Rsh were directly extracted from the J–V curves. As presented in Table 2, the Rs of H16 is 7.23 Ω cm2, which is much lower than that of H18 (11.16 Ω cm2). This comparison suggests that the hole transfer between the perovskite layer and H16 is better than that between the perovskite layer and H18. This is consistent with the hole-mobility measurement results. In addition, as H16 was replaced by H18, the Rsh decreased from 3192.81 to 1744.59 Ω cm2, implying that there is more charge recombination and leakage current. Due to the smaller Rs and higher Rsh, the FF of the H16 based PSC (0.70) was much higher than that of H18 (0.62). Note that, the FFs of H16 based PSCs are close to those of spiro-OMeTAD, which can be explained by their comparable Rs and Rsh.
To investigate the reproducibility of devices with the three HTMs, 30 devices in several different batches were fabricated. In comparison, the H16 based PSCs exhibited higher reproducibility than their H18 counterparts. Fig. 5 shows that more than 90% of the 30 devices using H16 obtained a PCE higher than 16%.

The thermal behaviour of H16 and H18 was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The decomposition temperature and glass transition temperature (Tg) of H16 and H18 were determined by TGA and DSC, respectively. It was found that H16 and H18 have a relatively high decomposition temperature of 392 and 403 °C, respectively, with a weight loss of 5% (Fig. S5), indicating good thermal stability of DTP based HTMs. The glass transition temperature of H16 and H18 exhibit a similar trend as decomposition temperature. As shown in Fig. S6, the Tg of H18 (140 °C) is higher than that of H16 (128 °C). It can be concluded that both HTMs are stable in the amorphous state during the operation of the device.

Moreover, we investigate the stability of PSCs based on H16 and H18. Fig. 6a shows the stability of the JSC and PCEs while maintaining the PSCs at the maximum power point. It can be found that the H16 and H18 based devices exhibit a rapid current response, indicating their good capabilities of hole transport and collection. The H16-based device shows a very stable JSC and PCE response within 120 s of exposure under maximum power point conditions. In contrast, the JSC and PCEs of the H18 based device decreased slowly with increasing time. Therefore, H16 is more stable than H18 when used as the HTM. Moreover, the spiro-OMeTAD based device also showed a good reliability. However, we can see that the speed of the response of spiro-OMeTAD is slower than that of H16.
We further investigate the stability of cells without encapsulation. As presented in Fig. 6b, the non-encapsulated H16-based device exhibited excellent stability with 90% of the initial efficiency being retained after long-term aging (two months) under ambient air conditions with a humidity of 20%. Note that, the data were obtained with 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as the additive, which has a negative effect on the long-term stability of devices. It can be found that the there is no obvious degradation of perovskite from the back view and front view of the device based on H16 (Fig. 6c). This indicates that the H16 layer could protect the perovskite layer against degradation under moisture. In contrast, the non-encapsulated device based on H18 retained 78% of its initial PCE after storage for two months in the dark. Therefore, H16 outperforms H18 in terms of the cell stability.

To understand the effect of different hole transport materials on the photovoltaic parameters, we measured their morphology using atomic force microscopy (AFM). All AFM samples have the same structure FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTM, which were prepared under the same processing conditions mentioned in the Experimental sections. As shown in Fig. 7a–c, the film of H18 (Fig. 7c) has a higher RMS roughness of 4.68 nm compared to H16 (Fig. 7b) with a RMS of 3.25 nm and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 7a) with a RMS of 4.48 nm. Apparently, the H16 HTM layer is smoother than the spiro-OMeTAD, while the H18 film is the roughest HTM. The higher film roughness hinders charge transport in the film and across the interface at the perovskite/hole transport layer, thus decreasing the JSC. These results are in good agreement with the J–V characteristics which showed that the JSC of the PCSs made of H16 > spiro-OMeTAD > H18. The CS-AFM images are presented in Fig. 7d–f. The results revealed that the surface current of the HTMs follow the trend of H18 < spiro-OMeTAD < H16, with surface current values of −50.1 < −50.4 < −51.2 PA, respectively. Also, these results are in good agreement with those of the conductivity measurements.


To scrutinize the charge recombination behaviour in the new HTM based PSCs, we recorded the transient photovoltage (TPV, Fig. 8a) of the studied devices. The charge carrier lifetime of H16, H18 and spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs were determined to be 32.22, 31.55 and 42.77 μs, respectively. A longer lifetime means a reduced charge recombination, contributing to a higher VOC in devices. This can explain the higher VOC obtained for the H16 based PSCs compared to those containing H18. We also recorded the transient photocurrent (TPC, Fig. 8b) of PSCs based on different HTMs. The TPC is closely related to the conductivity of the HTMs since different HTMs cause different photocurrent decay times. A charge transport time of 1.31, 2.31 and 1.96 μs were found for H16, H18 and spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs, respectively. Apparently, the H16 based devices show a faster charge transport compared to the H18 and spiro-OMeTAD based ones. Therefore, perovskite solar cells using H16 as the HTM outperforms their H18 and spiro-OMeTAD counterparts with respect to the JSC. Note that, the hole mobility and homogeneity of HTM films can affect the hole transport properties in devices. The fast hole transport in the H16 based PSCs originates from the combination of a relatively higher hole mobility and smoother film. In contrast, the H18 ones shows a slower charge transport, which is the integrated outcome of a lower hole mobility and less homogeneous surface.


To understand the hole-transfer behaviour of the DTP based HTMs, we monitored the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite/H16 and perovskite/H18 bilayers. As shown in Fig. 9, there is a strong emission peak at 700−850 nm for the pristine perovskite upon excitation at 500 nm. After the DTP HTM coating, the normalized PL intensity was reduced to roughly 3.72% (H18) and 3.15% (H16) with respect to the pristine perovskite. The higher PL quenching efficiencies in H16 than H18 indicates that the hole extraction is more efficient at the perovskite/H16 interface than that at the perovskite/H18 interface. Note that, a high hole transfer yield over 96% was achieved by both DTP HTMs, suggesting that nearly all the holes generated transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTMs. This is crucial for achieving a high VOC because an efficient interface charge separation could suppress the charge recombination in the bulk perovskite. As a result, the H16 based PSCs achieve a higher VOC over 1.1 V. It is found that the normalized PL intensity of spiro-OMeTAD (2.08%) is slightly lower than that of H16. Thus, the lower hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD may be compensated by its better hole extraction. As discussed above, there are both advantages and disadvantages to H16 and spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, the photovoltaic performance of H16 is on par with that of spiro-OMeTAD.


In summary, two DTP based HTMs with different substituents (MPDTP and TPDTP) have been designed and synthesized as efficient HTMs for perovskite solar cells. The H16 with the MPDTP substituted DTP core exhibits a high PCE of 18.16% in PSCs with good reproducibility under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar illumination. It is clearly much higher than the efficiency of 15.29% obtained while using H18 as the HTM under the same conditions. Note that, the photovoltaic performance of H16 is comparable to that of the well-known HTM spiro-OMeTAD (18.27%), and the device shows a long-term (two months) stability under ambient air conditions with a humidity of 20%. The results revealed that H16 shows advantages in conductivity, hole mobility, surface morphology, and charge transport over spiro-OMeTAD. Importantly, the synthesis cost of H16 is around one-fifth of that of spiro-OMeTAD, which is very important for PSCs to further their commercial application. Thus, H16 could be a promising alternative to spiro-MeOTAD for commercialization. The present work also reveals the potential of DTP building blocks for the further development of efficient molecule HTMs for PSCs.
