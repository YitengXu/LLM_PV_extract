Poly(3-butylthiophene) nanowires (P3BT-nws) were incorporated into poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to modulate the morphology of the active layer for enhanced photovoltaic performance. The P3BT-nws were found to induce the crystallization of P3HT as revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore, the existence of P3BT-nws facilitated the aggregation of PCBM molecules into larger clusters as revealed by grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The power conversion efficiency of the ternary blend device could reach the highest value of 4.2% at a P3BT-nw weight percentage of 7 wt%, in comparison with the pristine P3HT:PCBM system of 3.0%. The improved performance should be associated with the enhanced hole and electron mobilities, due to the formation of interconnected pathways along the crystallites of P3HT and P3BT-nws for efficient long-range charge transport.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention in the past decades due to their light weight, low-temperature solution processing, good mechanical flexibility, and large area manufacturing. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) has reached 10%, by designing novel donor and acceptor materials, using an efficient device structure, tuning interfacial materials, and applying new preparation technologies. One of the most widely studied systems in PSCs is a blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with the efficiency of 3–5%, and the primary method of improving the efficiency has been the optimization of the two-phase nanostructure of the donor and acceptor materials. Various approaches have been used to control the nanoscale film morphology, including thermal and solvent annealing, use of mixed solvents as a means to control aggregation of the polymer, incorporation of a third additive such as high-boiling-point 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), amphiphilic molecules of thiophene-C60 derivatives, rod-coil copolymers as interfacial compatibilizers, liquid crystalline molecules, narrow band gap polymers, dyes, semiconductor nanocrystals, and so on. Unlike typical inorganic semiconductors with a crystalline structure, the charge dynamics of P3HT are severely limited by the presence of amorphous portions between the ordered crystalline regions. The formation of interconnected pathways along the crystallites of P3HT is desired to ensure highly efficient long-range charge transport in the P3HT:PCBM system.

Recently, the self-assembled 1D nanostructures of P3HT have been shown to largely enhance the crystallinity, mechanical flexibility, and the speed of charge transport, as compared with the 2D thin film counterparts. The directional transport of the holes along P3HT nanowires may lead to increased carrier mobility and remarkable improvement in the PCE value even without any annealing process. There are numerous methods to prepare P3HT nanowires, including ultrasonic-assisted nanowire formation in co-solvent systems, UV irradiation in chloroform and toluene, self-seeded growth of nanowires by a cycle of cooling and heating in solutions and so on. It should be noted that the growth of P3HT nanowires is difficult in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) which is demonstrated to be the optimized solvent for the P3HT and PCBM system, due to the similar solubility parameter for P3HT and ODCB. In contrast, the poly(3-butylthiophene) nanowires (P3BT-nws) were easy to obtain in the ODCB solution, simply via cooling from 90–100 °C to room temperature in a dark environment as reported by Jenekhe. They have performed a systematic study using P3BT-nws as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor in photovoltaic applications. Although the hole mobility of P3BT is 9 times lower than that of P3HT, the solar cell device based on P3BT-nws and PC71BM could reach an efficiency of 3.0%, which is comparable to the P3HT:PC71BM system of 3.0%. By optimizing the donor and acceptor ratio and combining thermal annealing, the PCE reached the highest value of 3.35%.
In conclusion, incorporation of polymer semiconductor nanowires into the BHJ solar cell exhibits many advantages: (a) the polymer nanowires with widths of 10–20 nm and lengths of microns have sizes that perfectly match with the exciton diffusion lengths; (b) high carrier mobilities and high absorption coefficients are achieved because of the high crystallinity of the self-assembled nanowires; (c) it avoids the difficulties of blend phase-separation phenomena, including domain coarsening and time-dependent instability. As far as we are concerned, the incorporation of P3BT-nws as a third additive into the conventional P3HT:PCBM system has not been reported. Additionally, the influence of P3BT-nws on the crystallization of P3HT and the aggregation of PCBM is not known.
In this work, P3BT-nws were incorporated into the P3HT:PCBM system via solution blending in ODCB. The P3BT-nws are supposed to serve as the template to induce the crystallization of P3HT and play the role of a bridge between different P3HT crystalline domains to offer multi-charge-transfer channels for more efficient charge separation and transfer, which eventually leads to the increase of photovoltaic performance. The crystallization of P3HT in the presence of P3BT-nws, as well as the relationship between the morphology of the P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM ternary system and performance of the solar cells has been extensively studied. The approach was demonstrated to largely increase the short-circuit current (Jsc) from 7.79 mA cm−2 to 9.84 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) from 65.1% to 70.1%, thereby enhancing the power conversion efficiency from 3.0% to 4.2% in polymer and fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells. This article presents a novel method to build an interconnected pathway of conjugated polymers with 3D network formation from solution by nanowire induced crystallization.

Regioregular P3HT (Mw = 48300 g mol−1, head-to-tail regioregularity >90%) and PC61BM (99.5% purity) used in this study were purchased from Rieke Metals, Inc. and Nano-C, respectively. P3BT (Mw = 15000 g mol−1, head-to-tail regioregularity of 97%) was purchased from Aldrich. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios, Heraeus PVP Al 4083) was obtained from Bayer Inc., whereas indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was purchased from Delta Technologies Limited. 1,2-Dicholorobenzene (ODCB) was purchased from Aldrich. All the reagents were used directly as received without further purification.


3 mL and 1 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solvent were added into two 5 mL bottles containing 6 mg and 10 mg P3BT, respectively. The P3BT suspensions (2 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1) were stirred at 90 °C for 10 h until P3BT was completely dissolved. Then, the hot solution was kept in a dark environment for more than 24 hours at room temperature to allow P3BT chains to self-assemble. The original orange brown color of the solution changed to dark violet after the formation of P3BT-nws as a dispersion. The nanowires did not dissolve in ODCB by dilution, but they can be re-dissolved by heat treatment at 90 °C. The P3BT solution (2 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1) was prepared by stirring at 90 °C for 10 h until P3BT was completely dissolved. The solution was used immediately in order to avoid the formation of nanowires.


The P3HT (60 mg) and PCBM (60 mg) were charged into two bottles, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL ODCB to obtain the 40 mg mL−1 P3HT and 40 mg mL−1 PCBM solutions, respectively. Then, the suspensions were stirred in a glovebox at 60 °C overnight. The P3BT-nw suspension, P3HT solution and PCBM solution were mixed together (1:0:1, 0.97:0.03:1, 0.93:0.07:1, 0.9:0.1:1, 0.75:0.25:1, and 0.5:0.5:1 of P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM in weight ratio) to obtain the ternary blend solution. The detailed weight or volume fraction of the ternary blend solution comprising of the P3BT-nw suspension, P3HT solution, PCBM solution and ODCB is shown in the ESI (Table S1). Furthermore, the P3HT:P3BT:PCBM blends were prepared simply by mixing the solution together in the same weight ratio of P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM blends.


The desired geometric configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates was patterned by etching. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned with a detergent, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol sequentially with ultrasound treatment and dried under nitrogen flow, followed by UV treatment for 20 min. The cleaned ITO glass substrates were covered by spin coating with a layer of PEDOT:PSS (40 nm), drying at 140 °C for 20 min in air, and transferring into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The P3HT:PCBM blends with different weight percentages of P3BT-nws or P3BT were spin-coated onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer producing a 120 nm thick active layer and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Finally, 0.7 nm LiF and 100 nm Al were deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask at a pressure of approximately 10−6 Torr as an electrode.


Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine phase-transition temperatures on a TA DSC Q2000 differential scanning calorimeter with a constant heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. The corresponding melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (ΔHm), crystallization temperature (Tc) and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) were measured. The preparation of the blends used for DSC analysis is described in the ESI (Table S2). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer with a copper target (λ = 1.54 Å). The ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectra of the samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurement for photoluminescence (PL) of the polymers was carried out on a Hitachi F-7000 PC spectrofluorophotometer with a xenon lamp as the light source. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded on a nanoscope III A (Digital Instruments) scanning probe microscope using the tapping mode. The morphology of the films was studied by employing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2010 HR) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000) and in the dark. The current–voltage characterization was performed by using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) on the BL16B1 beamline using a photon energy of 10 keV with a sample to detector distance of approximately 2025 mm. The incident angle was set to 0.4°, which was above the critical angles of P3HT and PCBM and therefore the structure of the full film thickness was detected. The GISAXS signal was shielded with a rod-like beam stop.


The P3BT-nws were prepared as dispersions by solution-phase self-assembly similar to the previously reported method. As shown in Fig. 1a, the pristine P3BT solution is orange brown, in contrast to the dark violet P3BT-nw suspension in ODCB. The UV-vis absorption profile of the original P3BT solution is different from that of the P3BT-nw suspension. In addition to the absorption maximum (λmax) of the P3BT-nw suspension (λmax = 494 nm) which is red-shifted from the P3BT solution (λmax = 457 nm), two additional lower-energy shoulder peaks at 564 nm and 615 nm are characteristic of the crystalline P3BT. The absorption spectra of the spin-coated films of pristine P3BT and P3BT-nws are also presented in Fig. 1a. In contrast to the solution state, the maximum absorption peaks in the solid-state films for both P3BT and P3BT-nws exhibit an obvious red-shift. The shoulder peak at about 615 nm in the P3BT-nw film is stronger than that in the P3BT film and solution, showing that the crystallinity of P3BT-nws is higher than P3BT. Furthermore, the AFM images of the spin-coated films from original P3BT solution and P3BT-nw suspension are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. It is noted that the specimen from the P3BT-nw suspension exhibits interconnected structures, attributing to the formation of nanowires. However, unconspicuous nanowires could be noticed in the sample from original P3BT solution. The topography images of P3BT and P3BT-nw films are shown in Fig. S1. It is revealed that the P3BT-nws have been successfully obtained based on the color and absorption change in solution as well as the morphology variation in films.

In order to explore the effect of P3BT-nws on the crystallization behavior of P3HT, the binary blends at different P3BT-nw weight ratios were prepared via the solution blending method. Fig. 2a shows the X-ray spectra of the P3HT:P3BT-nw blends and one or two intense and sharp diffraction peaks contributing to P3HT or P3BT could be noticed. For the pristine P3HT and P3HT:P3BT-nw blends, the diffraction peak at 5.48° assigned to the (100) diffraction of P3HT remains almost the same, and the lamellar spacing of P3HT crystallites is calculated to be about 1.61 nm according to the Bragg equation. The shape of the reflection peaks is found to be dependent on the P3BT-nw weight percentage. By increasing the P3BT-nw content from 3 wt% to 10 wt%, the reflection peak of P3HT becomes stronger, illustrating higher crystallinity. Moreover, the grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) spectra of the films are shown in Fig. S2. The relative intensity of (100) and (200) diffraction peaks attributing to P3HT becomes stronger upon incorporation of P3BT-nws, demonstrating that P3BT-nws could induce the crystallization of P3HT.
To further investigate the effect of P3BT-nws on the crystal size of P3HT, the crystalline correlation length (CCL) of P3HT and P3BT was calculated from Scherrer's equation by fitting the diffraction peaks:
(1)
where FWHM is the full-width-at-half-maximum of the fitted Pseudo-Voigt function. The CCL is a measure of the crystallite size and/or perfection.
 The calculated parameters from XRD are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S3. The CCL value for P3HT decreases from 9.10 nm to 7.57 nm as the P3BT-nw weight percentage reaches 50 wt%. It is concluded that the P3BT-nws could induce the P3HT to form crystals smaller in size.

The interactions between P3BT-nw and P3HT were further investigated by DSC analysis. On the DSC heating curves, the melting peaks contributing to P3HT and P3BT could be noticed for the binary blends (Fig. 2b). The Tm of P3HT decreases gradually from 228.4 °C to 218.1 °C as the P3BT-nw content increases to 50 wt% (Table 1). The melting enthalpy of P3HT almost increases upon adding more P3BT-nws. In addition, the Tm of P3BT increases from 272.6 °C to 285.8 °C, accompanied by the increase of melting enthalpy from 5.0 J g−1 to 10.4 J g−1 for the blend containing 10 wt% P3BT-nws and pristine P3BT-nws, respectively. While cooling from the melting state, the crystallization temperature and enthalpy of P3HT reach the highest value of 182.8 °C and 11.3 J g−1 at a P3BT content of 10 wt% (Fig. 2c). The P3BT-nws at low weight percentage facilitate the crystallization of P3HT while cooling from the melting state. Moreover, the crystallization peak of P3HT becomes less obvious with the Tc value showing no significant change in the P3BT-nw content above 25 wt%. In contrast, both the crystallization temperature and enthalpy values for P3BT decrease at the existence of P3HT, due to the dilution effect of P3HT.

It is generally accepted that the melting temperature of a crystalline polymer is mainly related to the lamellar thickness of the crystals. As revealed by the XRD result, the P3BT-nws are believed to induce the crystallization of P3HT during the solvent evaporation process, leading to the formation of thinner and smaller P3HT crystallites due to the existence of a large amount of P3BT-nw nucleating points. Therefore, the Tm of P3HT decreases in the blends as the P3BT-nw content increases, attributing to the formation of thinner lamellae. Additionally, the melting enthalpy value could indirectly represent the crystallinity of the polymers, and the enhanced ΔHm value for the P3HT component reveals that the P3BT-nws (below 10 wt%) do induce the crystallization of more P3HT chains. The simulative model that P3BT-nws induce the crystallization of amorphous P3HT chains serving as the nucleating agent is shown in Fig. S4.
The X-ray spectra of the P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM ternary blend are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding parameters of lamellar spacing and CCL value are illustrated in Fig. S5 and Table S4. The position of the P3HT (100) peak remains unchanged as the P3BT-nw content reaches 10 wt%, and the peak slightly shifts to a higher 2θ value at a P3BT-nw content of 25 wt% and 50 wt%. Moreover, the intensity of the diffraction peak for P3HT gradually increases upon the incorporation of P3BT-nws, and the position of P3BT diffraction peaks remains constant. In the ternary blends, the P3BT-nws are supposed to play the role of a nucleating agent to induce P3HT crystallization.

Fig. 3b displays the UV-vis absorption spectrum of P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM ternary blend films at different contents of P3BT-nws. The spectrum of the pristine P3HT film shows a peak at 510 nm associated with the π–π* transition, while two additional absorption peaks at 555 and 605 nm are attributed to the π–π stacking of P3HT chains. The P3BT film also exhibits absorption peaks at about 510, 550 and 602 nm, and the peaks at 550 and 602 nm are attributed to crystalline P3BT. By increasing the P3BT-nw content, the intensity of absorption peaks at about 510 and 550 nm reaches the maximum at a P3BT-nw weight percentage of 10 wt%. Moreover, the intensity of the absorption peak at about 605 nm contributing to P3HT becomes stronger upon the incorporation of P3BT-nws. According to Jenekhe, the absorption peaks at about 550 nm and 605 nm are characteristic of the crystalline P3HT. The crystallinity of P3HT is improved by P3BT-nws, which is consistent with the XRD result.
The photoluminescence spectra (Fig. 3c) of P3HT:PCBM (black line) show a strong PL emission peak at 638 nm assigned to the radiative decay of excitons to the ground state. But the P3BT-nws show a weak PL emission peak at 653 nm thanks to the easy transportation of nanowires causing the low opportunities of recombination of the photogeneration carrier. For the PL spectra of P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM films, the emission intensity decreases sharply as the content of P3BT-nws increases, suggesting that versatile heterojunction interfaces offer multi-charge-transfer-channels for more efficient charge transfer. In addition, the surface morphology of the ternary blend films was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. S6. The surface roughness continuously declined from 6.76 to 3.42 nm with the P3BT-nw content increasing from 0 wt% to 50 wt%.
Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM films with various weight percentages of P3BT-nws were fabricated with a device structure (Fig. 4a) of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM/LiF/Al. Fig. 4b presents the illuminated current–voltage (J−V) curve characteristics of the devices under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light intensity illumination, and Fig. 4c shows the J−V characteristics of PSCs based on the P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM that were measured without illumination. Fig. 4d exhibits the illuminated current–voltage (J−V) curve characteristics of the devices based on the P3HT:P3BT:PCBM system for comparison. It is found that the leakage current of the device with P3BT-nws is considerably restrained, indicating that the recombination of carriers could be suppressed by P3BT-nws. A summary of the photovoltaic performance parameters is given in Tables 2 and 3. The devices based on P3HT:PCBM have a PCE of 3.0%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 7.79 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.597 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.1%. With the increase of the P3BT-nw content to 7 wt%, the PCE reaches the highest value of 4.2% for the corresponding solar cell device. As expected, both the Jsc and FF reach the maximal value of 9.84 mA cm−2 and 70.1%, respectively. In addition, the series resistance (Rs) decreases from 5.387 Ω cm2 to 2.506 Ω cm2 and the shut resistance (Rsh) increases from 455.7 Ω cm2 to 8212 Ω cm2, in contrast to the pristine P3HT:PCBM device. Consequently, the reduced Rs and enhanced Rsh values contribute to the enhanced device performance by improving the Jsc and FF. The variation of Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE values with the P3BT-nw content is displayed in Fig. 5, and it is observed that the Voc shows no significant change for devices with the P3BT-nw content below 10 wt%. However, the Voc gradually decreases at the P3BT-nw content above 25 wt%. Generally, the Voc value depends on the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor materials, as illustrated in eqn (2):
Voc ≈ Eaccepter(LUMO) + Edonor(HOMO) + 0.3

The depression of the Voc value in the presence of a large amount of P3BT-nws should be due to the difference in the HOMO energy level between P3HT and P3BT. In contrast, the PCE value of the devices based on the P3HT:P3BT:PCBM system gradually reduces from 3.0% to 1.3%, accompanied by the decrease of the Jsc value. It is concluded that the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:PCBM system should be due to the incorporation of P3BT-nws. The existence of P3BT-nws in the active layer induces the crystallization of P3HT and provides multi-charge-transfer channels for efficient charge transport, leading to the increase of the Jsc value.
In order to evaluate the apparent charge carrier mobility in the active layer, J0.5–V characteristics of single charge carrier devices were measured using the space charge-limited-current (SCLC) model according to the Mott–Gurney equation:
J = (9/8)με0εr(V2/L3)
(3)
where
J is the current density, μ is the charge carrier mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the dielectric constant of P3HT or PCBM (assumed to 3), μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, and L is the film thickness.

The thickness of the BHJ blend for SCLC measurement was about 120 nm. The J0.5–V characteristics of hole-only and electron-only devices are plotted in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. A summary of the carrier mobility that was fitted with the SCLC model is given in Table 4. The apparent hole mobility reaches the highest value of 7.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a P3BT-nw content of 10 wt%, in contrast to 3.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pristine P3HT:PCBM. The enhancement of the hole mobility is mainly attributed to the improved crystallization of P3HT induced by the P3BT-nws. In addition, the P3BT-nws are supposed to play the role of a bridge between P3HT crystalline regions and offer multi-charge-transfer channels for more efficient charge transfer. However, the electron mobility always increases as the content of P3BT-nws increases, and the pristine P3BT-nw:PCBM has the highest electron mobility which might be due to the increase of the sizes of PCBM clusters as revealed by the GISAXS analysis (Fig. 8). The results indicate that the addition of the P3BT-nws into the active layer can lead to an increase of both the electron and hole mobility and a more balanced charge transport in the devices.

To correlate the photovoltaic performance of the device with the morphology of the active layer, the corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. 7 and S7. For the pristine P3HT and P3BT specimens, in addition to the P3HT:P3BT blend (7 wt% P3BT), no characteristic morphology could be observed. In Fig. S7d, nanowires with the diameter of about 10 nm could be noticed for the P3HT:P3BT-nw blend. In addition, more dense nanowires are observed for the pristine P3BT-nw specimen as shown in Fig. S7e. It is demonstrated that the nanowires could be obtained simply by blending the P3HT solution with the P3BT-nw suspension, and the nanowires are found to be stable in the P3HT:P3BT-nw films. In the P3HT:PCBM blend, the phase-separated morphology with black PCBM clusters in the diameter of about 40–100 nm could be observed. However, no nanowires could be noticed in the TEM image. In the P3BT-nw:PCBM blend, P3BT-nws with the diameter of about 8–10 nm are observed. These nanowires form an interconnected network surrounded by a continuous PCBM phase, forming a quasi-bicontinuous nanoscale morphology. Upon the incorporation of 7 wt% P3BT-nws into the P3HT:PCBM system, the morphology of the ternary blend shows a significant change. The nanowires distributing in the matrix exhibit lower density and larger width as compared with the P3BT-nw:PCBM blend. Some of the nanowires seem to be covered by an additional layer, attributing to the P3HT phase.
Furthermore, GISAXS can provide interpretations for structures across different lengths in the form of fractal sizes and provide more details on the hierarchical structures. We used the Fit GISAXS and IGOR Pro software to obtain the 2D and 1D profiles from GISAXS data, as shown in Fig. 8. Extracting quantitative information from GISAXS profiles is extremely challenging given the irregularly shaped, polydisperse, interconnected and randomly distributed domains characteristic of a BHJ morphology. There exists no widely accepted GISAXS model for BHJ PSC blends, although Su et al. have successfully used the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) model and the polydisperse hard sphere model to describe the cluster size and distribution of PCBM domains. Therefore, we elect to interpret the data qualitatively based on the analysis of the intensity variation of the profiles. It is observed that the as-cast P3HT:PCBM film exhibits a power-law dependence of 2 and does not show an obvious Guinier regime, both indicating that the domains are poorly phase segregated (i.e., highly intermixed) with no well-defined domain sizes within the length scales probed. However, the P3HT:P3BT-nw:PCBM (0.93:0.07:1) and P3BT-nw:PCBM films show a discernible shoulder at about 0.25 nm−1, and the power-law exponent increases to higher values. These features indicate that phase-segregation takes place during the solvent evaporation process, and the PCBM molecules tend to aggregate into larger PCBM clusters in the presence of P3BT-nws which may facilitate the electron transport as revealed by the SCLC analysis.
Based on the above analysis, a model describing the morphology of the ternary blend is illustrated in Fig. 9. The P3BT-nws could serve as the template to induce the heterogeneous crystallization of P3HT and play the role of a bridge to connect the separated crystalline domains of P3HT, and also induce the aggregation of PCBM molecules into bigger clusters. Therefore, the enhanced photovoltaic performance and hole and electron mobilities should contribute to the optimized morphology of the active layer upon incorporation of P3BT-nws.

The P3BT-nws were incorporated into the P3HT:PCBM system via the solution blending method. As revealed by XRD, GIXRD and DSC analyses, the existence of P3BT-nws could induce the crystallization of P3HT. The P3BT-nws played the role of a bridge connecting the different P3HT crystalline regions to offer multi-charge-transfer channels for more efficient charge separation and transfer, which eventually led to the improvement of photovoltaic performance. The PCE value of the device could reach to the highest value of 4.2%, in contrast to the pristine P3HT:PCBM system of 3.0% and the P3HT:P3BT:PCBM systems ranging from 1.3% to 3.1%. The addition of the P3BT-nws into the active layer could lead to an increase of both the electron and hole mobility and a more balanced charge transport in the devices, as well as enhancement of light absorption. Moreover, the P3BT-nws are supposed to induce the PCBM molecules to form bigger clusters.
