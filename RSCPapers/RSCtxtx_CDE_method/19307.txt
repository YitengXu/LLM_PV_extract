MoS2 nanosheets obtained through a simple sonication exfoliation method are employed as a hole-extraction layer (HEL) to improve the efficiency and air stability of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). The reduction in the wavenumber difference, appearance of a UV-vis peak, and atomic force microscopy images indicate that MoS2 nanosheets are formed through the sonication method. The OPVs with MoS2 layers show a degraded performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.08%, which is lower than that of OPVs without HEL (1.84%). After performing the UV/ozone (UVO) treatment of the MoS2 surface for 15 min, the PCE value increases to 2.44%. Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy data show that the work function of MoS2 increases from 4.6 to 4.9 eV upon UVO treatment, suggesting that the increase in the PCE value is caused by the bandgap alignment. Upon inserting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) between MoS2 and the active layer, the PCE value of the OPV increases to 2.81%, which is comparable with that of the device employing only PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, the stability of the OPVs is improved significantly when MoS2/PEDOT:PSS layers are used as the HEL. Therefore, it is considered that the use of UVO-treated MoS2 may improve the stability of OPV cells without degrading the device performance.

Recently, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have attracted much attention because of their low cost, light weight, flexibility, and ease of enlargement through the roll-to-roll coating process. The most common materials for OPV fabrication are poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor, which are used because of their good solubilities in common solvents. One strategy for improving the performance of OPVs is to insert a buffer layer between the active layer and the electrode to facilitate the collection of holes and electrons. Other approaches for improving the light harvesting of OPVs include the synthesis of new polymers or the tuning of the absorption of the active layer to a suitable wavelength range. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used as a hole-extraction layer (HEL). However, it has been reported that PEDOT:PSS is not suitable for practical applications owing to its hygroscopicity and acidity, which causes fast degradation of OPVs. To resolve this problem, transition-metal oxides such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3), vanadium oxide (Va2O5), nickel oxide (NiO), and tungsten oxide (WO3), are under intensive investigation as possible substitutes for PEDOT:PSS. Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets of transition-metal sulfides have also attracted much interest because of their superior mechanical and electrical properties such as their thermal conductivity and carrier mobility. The application of MoSx as the HEL in OPVs has also been reported recently. However, the use of transition-metal sulfides in OPVs remains a great challenge because of the inherent difficulties in the exfoliation process for the synthesis of MoS2 and a mismatch of the work function between the MoS2 HEL and the active layer. Therefore, in this study, a simple sonication process is used to make MoS2 nanosheets, and the UV/ozone (UVO) treatment method is utilized for modulating the work function of the MoS2 layer to improve the performance and stability of the OPVs.

In this work, UVO-treated MoS2 was used as the HEL in OPVs to extend their stability. Ultrathin nanosheets of MoS2 obtained through the sonication method were spin-coated onto indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates to afford a uniform and complete single layer. Raman spectroscopy was performed to identify the effect of the thickness after the sonication process. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the change in the bandgap, while the thickness and size of the MoS2 nanosheets were confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) was used to investigate the effect of the UVO treatment on the atomic composition and work function of MoS2. On the basis of these measurements, the effect of UVO-treated MoS2 as the HEL in OPVs is discussed.

MoS2 powder and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. An ultrasonicator (Sonicator Microtip Probes, SONICS VCX-750) was used to induce the exfoliation of the MoS2 powder. MoS2 (200 mg) was mixed with NVP solvent (40 mL) in an 80 mL flask. The solution was sonicated with a power of 200 W for 8 h, which formed the optimized conditions for this experiment. After sonication, the samples were centrifuged using a DAIHAN WiseSpin CF-10 instrument at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The floating solution, which contained the exfoliated MoS2 layer of small diameter, was collected with a pipette. Then, the solvent was removed by washing with ethanol, and the final product was dried at 30 °C in a vacuum oven.

A patterned ITO glass substrate was utilized for OPV fabrication. First, the substrate was cleaned sequentially with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water for 15 min each, with ultrasonic assistance. Then, the cleaned ITO glass was dried at 80 °C for 15 min before performing the UVO treatment for 15 min. Four types of OPVs were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1: ITO/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al (Type I), ITO/MoS2/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al (Type II), ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al (Type III), and ITO/MoS2/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al (Type IV). The ultrathin layer of MoS2 was spin-coated at the rate of 5000 rpm for 30 s in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at the rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min under a N2 atmosphere in a glove box. P3HT:PCBM in a 6:4 weight ratio with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was spin-coated at 700 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. Finally, the cathode with LiF (1 nm thickness) and Al (100 nm thickness) was thermally deposited at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of the device was approximately 4 mm2.
Raman spectra for investigating the changes in the thickness of the exfoliated MoS2 were obtained using LabRAM HR (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 514.54 nm. UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a V-670 UV-vis spectrophotometer. AFM (XE-100/PSIA) in the contact mode was employed to confirm the thickness of the exfoliated MoS2. SPRES experiments were performed in an ultra-high-vacuum chamber (base pressure of ≈10−10 Torr) with a 4D beam line, equipped with an electron analyzer and a heating element, at the Pohang Acceleration Laboratory. The onset of photoemission, corresponding to the vacuum level at the surface of MoS2, was measured using an incident photon energy beam of 250 eV with a negative bias on the sample. The results were corrected for charging effects by using Au 4f as an internal reference. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve was measured in air with a Keithley 2612 sourcemeter under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the conversion of solar radiation to electrical power was calculated using the equation

Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor, and Pin is the illumination power.



Fig. 2(a) shows the Raman spectra of bulk MoS2 and MoS2 nanosheets. Two optical phonon modes (E12g and A1g) and one longitudinal acoustic mode are observed in ultrathin and bulk MoS2; E12g is an in-plane optical mode, whereas A1g corresponds to out-of-plane vibrations of the sulfur atoms. For bulk MoS2, the E12g and A1g modes appear at approximately 384 and 410 cm−1, respectively. The frequencies of these modes are similar to the reported values from Raman and neutron scattering. After sonication, the E12g and A1g modes in the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets appear at 386 and 411 cm−1, respectively. The increase in wavenumber for both peaks corresponds to the results of a previous report. The energy difference between E12g and A1g was reduced by the sonication process, suggesting a decrease in the layer thickness. The UV-vis absorption spectra of bulk MoS2 and MoS2 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2(b). No peak was detected in the bulk MoS2 sample; it is believed that bulk MoS2 has an indirect bandgap, and therefore, its absorption peak does not appear in the UV-vis absorption spectrum. After the sonication process, absorption peaks appeared at 460, 610, and 671 nm, indicating that the indirect bandgap had changed to a direct bandgap owing to the exfoliation process. These peaks correspond to 2.7, 2.03, and 1.85 eV, which are the same as the values reported for the bandgap energy of single-layer MoS2.Fig. 2(c) shows an AFM image of MoS2 nanosheets spin-coated on the SiO2/Si substrate. Many small particles of MoS2 are seen in the image. The height difference was measured along the red line in the AFM image. The thicknesses of individual particles, indicated by two triangles of the same color, were 1.3, 0.8, and 1.4 nm. This result confirmed that the thickness and lateral size of the MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated through the sonication method were approximately 1 and 100–300 nm, respectively, in agreement with the results for MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated using the lithium intercalation method. These data indicate that bulk MoS2 was changed to MoS2 nanosheets upon sonication.


Fig. 3 shows the (a) Mo 3d and (b) O 1s spectra of the MoS2 films as a function of the UVO treatment time. The surface contaminations of the spin-coated MoS2 sample were removed using argon ions before SRPES measurement. Two main peaks of Mo 3d are located at 228.5 and 231.63 eV in the spin-coated sample, which correspond to Mo4+ d5/2 and Mo4+ d3/2 of MoS2. After performing the UVO treatment for 15 and 30 min, two new peaks appeared, at 232.7 and 235.6 eV, which correspond to Mo6+5/2 and Mo6+3/2 of MoO3. As the UVO treatment time was prolonged, the Mo4+ intensity decreased. The appearance of Mo6+ and decrease in the Mo4+ intensity indicated that MoS2 was changed to MoOx upon UVO treatment. In the case of the O 1s spectra, the peak of O 1s was located at 532.3 eV in the spin-coated MoS2 sample, indicating adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the sample. After performing the UVO treatment for 15 and 30 min, a new peak of O 1s appeared at 531.0 eV, indicating that the O2− peak bonded with Mo6+. Furthermore, the intensity of the O 1s peak located at 532.3 eV decreased upon increasing the UVO treatment time. These results suggest that the MoS2 nanosheets are converted to MoOx by UVO treatment.
The change in the work function of MoS2 after each treatment in the fabrication of the OPV was measured by using secondary electron emission spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. The onset of the secondary electron was determined by extrapolating two solid lines from the background and straight onset in the spectra.
The work function of MoS2 was measured to be 4.6 eV. The onset of the secondary electron of MoS2 shifted by 0.7 eV to a lower work function after dipping into the DMF solvent. After the sample was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min, the work function was recovered to 4.55 eV. The work function increased to 4.9 and 5.2 eV after performing the UVO treatment of MoS2 for 15 and 30 min, respectively. It is considered that the UVO treatment changes MoS2 to MoOx, leading to an increase in the work function. This result indicates that the UVO-treated MoS2 is adequate for use as the HEL in OPV devices.

Fig. 5(a) shows the J–V curves of OPV cells based on the device structure and UVO irradiation time. The same experiments were performed at least five times to confirm the effect of MoS2. The Type-II device without UVO irradiation shows the lowest PCE of 1.08%, with Jsc = 8.03 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.29 V, and FF = 46%, which are much lower than the values of the Type-I device, which has a PCE of 1.84% with Jsc = 6.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.48 V, and FF = 55%. After performing the UVO treatment of the MoS2 layer for 15 min, the PCE of the Type-II device improved to 2.44%, with Jsc = 7.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.50 V, and FF = 63%. These phenomena can be explained by the change in the work function of MoS2 upon UVO irradiation. The work function of the spin-coated MoS2 nanosheets was 3.9 eV, as shown in Fig. 4, which is not suitable for the HEL in OPV cells. Although the work function of the MoS2 layer increased to 4.6 eV upon annealing at 150 °C, it was still not sufficient for transferring holes to the electrode. After performing the UVO treatment for 15 and 30 min, the work function of MoS2 reached 4.9 and 5.2 eV, respectively, decreasing the hole-extraction barrier and improving the device performance, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The energy levels of ITO, PEDOT:PSS, P3HT:PCBM, and LiF/Al were obtained from other reports in the literature. It is shown that upon performing the UVO treatment for 30 min, the Type-II device properties are degraded in comparison with those after performing the UVO treatment for 15 min. It is considered that UVO treatment for a period longer than the optimized duration damages the MoS2 surface, inducing the breakdown of the MoS2 network. These data indicate that UVO has a strong effect on devices with MoS2 nanosheets. Although the properties of the Type-II device that has undergone the UVO treatment for 15 min improved, they were still worse than those of the Type-III device, with PCE = 2.87%, Jsc = 8.14 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.52 V, and FF = 68%. In the case of the Type-IV device with both PEDOT:PSS and UVO-treated MoS2 nanosheets, the values of PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF were 2.81%, 7.97 mA cm−2, 0.52 V, and 68%, respectively. The properties of the Type-III and Type-IV devices are similar, and superior to those of Type-I and Type-II devices. A summary of the device properties is given in Table 1. These results indicate that the UVO-treated MoS2 nanosheets could play the role of the PEDOT:PSS layer; however, more treatments on MoS2 are needed to improve the device properties.

The stability of the Type-III and Type-IV OPVs was investigated under an air atmosphere without encapsulation. Fig. 6 shows the (a) normalized Jsc, (b) normalized Voc, (c) normalized PCE, and (d) normalized FF on the basis of the time the OPVs are kept in air. Each property was normalized against its initial value. Regarding Voc and FF, no significant difference was found between Type III and Type IV, although the Voc value was maintained and the FF value decreased to 0.85 as the time was extended to approximately 120 h. The values of Jsc and PCE decreased to 0.6 for Type IV and 0.2 for Type III after keeping the devices for 120 h in air, indicating that a longer lifetime was achieved for devices using MoS2/PEDOT:PSS layers than for those employing only the PEDOT:PSS layer. It seems that most of the degradation difference between the two types of OPVs was owing to the decrease in Jsc. Previous studies have shown that the acidity and hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS causes damage to both the PEDOT:PSS/ITO surface and itself. Thus, it is considered that the difference in device degradation between Type III and Type IV is owing to the HEL and interface degradation. These results indicate that sandwiching the MoS2 layer between PEDOT:PSS and ITO could extend the stability of OPV cells by protecting the ITO surface from the hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS.

MoS2 was exfoliated by using the sonication method and applied to OPVs as the HEL. The increase in the wavenumber and reduction of the energy difference in the E12g and A1g modes of the Raman spectra and the appearance of a UV absorption peak suggested that the layer thickness of MoS2 decreased upon sonication. Furthermore, the AFM images confirmed that the thickness and lateral size of the MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated via sonication were approximately 1 and 100–300 nm, respectively. After the UVO treatment on MoS2, Mo6+ and O2− bonded with the Mo6+ peaks appearing in the SRPES results, and the work function increased from 4.6 to 4.9–5.2 eV. The use of UVO-treated MoS2 nanosheets as the HEL in OPV cells increased their PCE value to 2.44% (from 1.84% for the OPV cell without the HEL). It is considered that the work-function modulation of MoS2 upon UVO treatment enhances its hole-extraction property. The PCE value of the OPV with MoS2/PEDOT:PSS was 2.81%, which is comparable to that of the OPV with only the PEDOT:PSS layer. However, the use of the MoS2/PEDOT:PSS layer extended the air stability of the OPV cells by protecting the ITO surface from the hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, it is considered that damage caused by the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS could be prevented by sandwiching MoS2 between the ITO/glass substrate and PEDOT:PSS without any degradation of the device performance.
