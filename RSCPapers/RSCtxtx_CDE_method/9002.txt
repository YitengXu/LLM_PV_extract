In this study, we design and synthesize a new non-fullerene electron acceptor, SF(DPPB)4, in which a spirobifluorene (SF) core is installed with four benzene endcapped diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) arms. SF(DPPB)4 exhibits energy levels matching perfectly with those of the commonly used poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) donor in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Furthermore, a designed cross-shaped molecular geometry helps in suppressing strong intermolecular aggregation in the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blend, leading to efficient non-fullerene PSCs. The resultant devices give a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.16% with an extremely high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.14 V. In contrast, the devices based on P3HT:PC61BM blends provide a PCE of 3.18% with a Voc of 0.62 V. Finally, we observe that the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices exhibit significantly improved thermal stability from that of the P3HT:PC61BM devices; upon thermal treatment at 150 °C for 3 h, the PCEs of P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices remain unchanged, whereas those of the P3HT:PC61BM devices drop drastically to below 1%. The abovementioned results demonstrate that the new design strategy of employing a high-performance non-fullerene acceptor, SF(DPPB)4, is promising for the future practical application of PSCs.

Fast development of polymer solar cells was made in the previous decades with the promise of eventually producing light weight, flexible and low-cost clean energy alternatives. The prospect of material innovation has long been a strong driving force to move the field forward. However, the development of electron acceptors occurred at a relatively slower pace than that of donor components. This is because the fullerene derivative based acceptors were being widely used in devices with no rival alternatives, though their clear drawbacks, such as limited chemical and energetic tunabilities, poor light-absorption, high-cost purification, and morphology instability, have become bottlenecks to constrain the further advancement of PSCs. Recently, the exploration of non-fullerene electron acceptors have gained considerable attention and we report herein the design of a new non-fullerene acceptor, SF(DPPB)4, which shows a cross-shaped molecular geometry to help suppress strong intermolecular aggregation. In addition, the energy levels of SF(DPPB)4 match well with those of P3HT, which not only allows achievement of efficient exciton dissociation, but also ensures high Voc (1.14 V) and efficiency (5.16%) in P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 PSCs. Moreover, the devices show excellent thermal stability. The abovementioned results demonstrate that the new design strategy of employing a high-performance non-fullerene acceptor has promising practical applications.


Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10%, which are very attractive because of their potential to be transformed into light-weight, flexible and low-cost photovoltaic technology devices. However, current high-performance BHJs are predominantly made with narrow band-gap polymer donors together with fullerene acceptors (e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM and PC71BM). Note that these two types of materials are relatively expensive. In addition to this, there are also some intrinsic drawbacks for fullerene materials, such as limited chemical and energetic tunabilities, poor light absorption, high production cost, and morphological instability, though fullerene acceptors exhibit high electron mobility, isotropic electron-transporting ability, and the capability of forming nanoscaled phase separation favorable for exciton dissociation. This somehow has become the bottleneck to material development for further advancing PSCs. Recently, attention has been paid to the development of non-fullerene acceptors. It has been encouragingly shown that PSCs based on non-fullerene electron acceptors allow for exhibiting PCEs of 4–7%.

In particular, efficient BHJs made with a novel non-fullerene acceptor and economic polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are attractive. This is because P3HT or poly(3-alkylthiophene) (P3AT) based block copolymers, as a type of low-cost and easy-process polymers, represent one of the most profoundly studied donor materials and show great potential to produce effective and low-cost PSCs. To pair well with a large band-gap donor such as P3HT, new acceptors should have high-lying energy levels that maintain a suitable energetic difference from those of P3HT, to simultaneously promote exciton dissociation and mitigate potential loss to gain a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) for the device. On the other hand, the engineering of the molecular geometry that could influence the blend morphology is the other crucial aspect. Recent studies have proved that small molecule acceptors with twisted quasi-3D or 3D structures could be good candidates for achieving this in PSCs. However, a few studies report PSCs based on P3HT and a non-fullerene acceptor with PCEs over 3%. Very recently, Zhan et al. reported an indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit based non-fullerene acceptor,
IDT-2BR, and the resulting PSCs based on P3HT:IDT-2BR blended films gave a PCE of 5.12%, which is the highest value for P3HT-based non-fullerene PSCs to date. In our previous study, a non-fullerene acceptor, F(DPP)2B2, was developed through installing two benzene endcapped diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) onto a fluorene core. It was found to possess relatively high electron mobility and suitable energy levels matching those of P3HT. The P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 blend based PSCs provided a PCE of 3.17% with a very high Voc of 1.18 V. Unfortunately, the abovementioned PSCs gave a small short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.35 mA cm−2, which could be ascribed to large phase separation (40–60 nm) in the blended films.
Taking the abovementioned considerations into account, we explore herein a new non-fullerene acceptor, SF(DPPB)4 that is equivalent to the cross-shaped molecular configuration of two F(DPP)2B2 units (Fig. 1a). Because the two fluorene rings are perpendicular to each other in a spirofluorene (SF) core, the new SF(DPPB)4 materials are less crystalline and can prevent the forming of large aggregates when blended with P3HT to fabricate PSCs. This potentially assures high exciton dissociation efficiency and large Jsc in the device. Moreover, the relatively high electron mobility and similar appropriate energy levels of F(DPP)2B2 are preserved in SF(DPPB)4. After proper optimization of the device fabrication, we achieved a maximum PCE of 5.16% with a Voc of 1.14 V, a Jsc of 8.29 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.55 for the PSCs based on P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blends. More importantly, the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices exhibit much better thermal stability than the P3HT:PC61BM ones; upon thermal treatment at 150 °C for 3 h, the PCEs of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices remain unchanged, whereas those of the P3HT:PC61BM devices drop drastically to below 1%.

SF(DPPB)4 was synthesized via a one-step palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling between a tetra-boric ester functionalized SF and four brominated benzene-endcapped DPP units in good yield (80%). Its chemical structure was fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. S1–S3, ESI). Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the energy-optimized molecular geometry of SF(DPPB)4 was shown to be, as expected, a cruciform configuration with two orthogonal conjugated backbones. The two dihedral angels between DPP and the aromatic six-membered rings (fluorene and benzene), φ1 and φ2, are calculated as 17.8° and 17.9°, respectively (Fig. 1b). This molecular arrangement prevents the strong intermolecular aggregation of SF(DPPB)4, while maintaining long and effective conjugation in each arm for photon harvesting and exposing sufficient π-surface for electron transport. The thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). SF(DPPB)4 shows excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 403 °C under nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S4, ESI). As expected, we do not observe melting or crystallization peaks during the temperature range of 30–350 °C for SF(DPPB)4 (Fig. S5, ESI).


Fig. 1c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of SF(DPPB)4 in CHCl3 solution and as a thin film. A red-shift (21 nm) of the maximum absorption peak is observed from the solution to film, implying effective π–π stacking in the solid state. SF(DPPB)4 film shows intense absorptions in the range of 550–700 nm, which complement well with the main absorptions of P3HT (400–600 nm). This is suggestive of the excellent light-harvesting capability of PSCs based on the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blend. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to estimate the energy level structure of SF(DPPB)4. From the onset oxidation potential (0.86 V versus SCE) and the onset reduction potential (−0.89 V versus SCE) presented in Fig. 1d, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of SF(DPPB)4 are obtained as −5.26 and −3.51 eV, respectively. These values are close to those of F(DPP)2B2 (−5.21 and −3.39 eV), implying that the replacement of fluorene with SF has minimal effect on the energy levels.

From the abovementioned results, we observed that both the HOMO and the LUMO of SF(DPPB)4 are sufficiently lower than those of P3HT (−4.76 and −2.74 eV) but significantly higher than those of PC61BM (−5.8 and −4.0 eV), as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The offset between the LUMO of SF(DPPB)4 and the HOMO of P3HT (1.25 eV) is much larger than that between PC61BM and P3HT (0.74 eV), which is favorable for achieving a high Voc for the PSCs based on P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blends. It suggested that SF(DPPB)4 could potentially be a superior electron acceptor compared to PC61BM for P3HT-based PSCs. Then, PSCs with P3HT as the electron donor and SF(DPPB)4 as the electron acceptor were prepared and the device structure is presented in Fig. 2b. Fig. 2c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and all photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. We found that thermal annealing could significantly improve the device performance. Without annealing, a poor PCE of 0.63% with a Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 1.91 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.28 is obtained when the blend weight ratio of donor (P3HT) and acceptor (SF(DPPB)4) is 2:1. Upon thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min, the device with the same D:A blend ratio can give a maximum PCE of 5.16% with a Voc of 1.14 V, a Jsc of 8.29 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.55. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is one of the highest values ever reported for P3HT and non-fullerene acceptor based PSCs. PSCs with other weight ratios of P3HT and SF(DPPB)4 (1:1 and 3:1) were also fabricated, but decreased PCEs were observed from those of devices with the D:A weight ratio of 2:1. For comparison, the P3HT:PC61BM device only provides a PCE of 3.18% with a Voc of 0.62 V, a Jsc of 8.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.62. Apparently, the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 devices (with D:A weight ratio of 2:1 and annealing treatment) exhibit superior performances compared to those of fullerene based devices, which is mainly attributed to the particularly higher Voc and the approximate Jsc and FF. This is in perfect agreement with the energy level values from the CV measurements. In Fig. 2d, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based PSCs are shown. It is clear that the shapes of the EQE spectra resemble those of the sum of the donor and acceptor absorptions, suggesting that each component in the active layers contributes to the photovoltaic responses.

To understand the reasons for the performance improvement of the annealed devices, we obtained the UV-vis absorption spectra of P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 films with and without annealing (Fig. S6, ESI). After annealing, the absorptions for both P3HT and SF(DPPB)4 are dramatically enhanced, implying that thermal annealing promotes improved molecular interaction and perhaps molecular orientation. We also employed the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to investigate the influences of thermal annealing on the charge-transporting properties of P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blended films. Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI) show the J0.5–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices taking the 2:1 P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 films with or without thermal annealing as the charge-transporting layers. From Fig. S7 (ESI), the hole mobility of the as-cast blended film is calculated to be 8.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and after annealing, the hole mobility increases to 14.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. A similar change is observed for the electron mobilities; thermal annealing can elevate the electron mobility from 6.70 × 10−5 to 12.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S8, ESI). Therefore, we speculated that thermal annealing may promote intermolecular π–π stacking in the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 films, leading to stronger absorptions and better charge transport, which are responsible for the improvement in photovoltaic properties.


Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were further used to investigate the crystallinity and molecular orientation in both neat and blended films. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns are shown in Fig. 3, which presents the intensity profiles versus wave vector qz and qr, corresponding to the molecular arrangement order in out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively. It was found that the neat SF(DPPB)4 films, with or without thermal annealing, did not show any clear diffraction peaks, which indicates that SF(DPPB)4 is nearly amorphous, agreeing with the results from the DSC measurements. In contrast, the neat P3HT film shows a (100) lamellar diffraction peak centered at qz ≈ 0.38 Å−1 (d ≈ 16.5 Å), consistent with previous studies. After annealing, a much stronger (100) peak, even up to three orders of lamellar diffraction peaks for P3HT appear along the qz direction at qz ≈ 0.38, 0.76, and 1.14 Å−1, corresponding to edge-on oriented P3HT domains. There is also one lamellar peak observed at qr ≈ 0.36 Å−1 (d ≈ 17.4 Å), indicating the co-existence of face-on oriented domains in the annealed P3HT film. In addition, the (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak is found to concentrate along the qz axis at qz ≈ 1.65 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.8 Å), arising from the face-on oriented P3HT domains as well. For the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blended film without annealing, we can only observe a lamellar diffraction peak at qz ≈ 0.35 Å−1 (d ≈ 18.2 Å). After the annealing of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blended film, the lamellar diffraction peaks corresponding to edge-on stacked P3HT domains are observed up to three orders along the qz axis at qz ≈ 0.38, 0.76, and 1.13 Å−1. At the same time, face-on oriented P3HT domains give rise to a lamellar peak along the qr axis at qr ≈ 0.36 Å−1 (d ≈ 17.4 Å) and a π–π peak along the qz axis at qz ≈ 1.66 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.8 Å). The abovementioned results demonstrate no doubt that annealing can promote the crystallization and preferred face-on stacking of P3HT in the blended film, resulting in the much better light-harvesting and charge-transporting capabilities of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blended film. Thereby, the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs are elevated tremendously.


The morphologies of the as-cast and annealed 2:1 P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blended films were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4). It can be observed that in the as-cast film, P3HT is completely compatible with SF(DPPB)4, and the RMS roughness of the blended film is only 0.394 nm. After thermal annealing, due to the self-organization of P3HT and SF(DPPB)4, the RMS roughness of the blended film increases to 0.633 nm. Moreover, interconnected grains were identified at the top surface with a size of 20–30 nm, indicating that suitable-sized component domains and a percolated network are formed. Thus, thermal annealing results in the enhanced photovoltaic performances. It is worth noting that, because of the cross-shaped molecular geometry of SF(DPPB)4, the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 film exhibits much finer domains (20–30 nm) than that of the previous P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 film (40–60 nm). This plays an important role in ensuring a higher exciton dissociation efficiency and a larger Jsc for the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based PSCs. Therefore, the PCE is 5.16% for the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based PSCs, whereas it is only 3.17% for the P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 based PSCs.


To explore the morphological stability of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 and P3HT:PC61BM blended films, optical microscopy was used to obtain the morphological images for the films with thermal treatment at 150 °C for various times (Fig. 5a). It was observed that the P3HT:PC61BM films produce numerous micrometer-scale aggregates after thermal treatment for only 0.5 h, and the aggregation significantly increased with the extension of treating time. Furthermore, the PCE of the corresponding device drops rapidly to below 1% after 3 h of thermal treatment. These phenomena regarding the P3HT:PC61BM film and the related device are in agreement with previous study in the references. In contrast, due to the near amorphous nature of SF(DPPB)4, the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 film remains homogenous in morphology and no aggregates can be observed even after 3 h of thermal treatment. As a result, the PCE of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based device remains nearly steady during thermal treatment (Fig. 5b). The excellent thermal stability in the morphology of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 film is inevitably favorable for the future practical application of SF(DPPB)4 as an acceptor in the field of PSCs.


In summary, a spirobifluorene core based non-fullerene electron acceptor, SF(DPPB)4, was designed and synthesized. SF(DPPB)4 possesses a cruciform molecular configuration, which assures fine phase separation in the active layer of corresponding PSCs. In addition, SF(DPPB)4 exhibits appropriate absorption bands and matching energy levels for P3HT. Owing to the good morphology and an outstandingly high Voc of 1.14 V, the PSCs based on the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blended films provided the best PCE of 5.16%. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is one of the highest values reported in the literature to date for P3HT-based fullerene-free PSCs. The P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based devices also show excellent thermal stability upon thermal treatment at 150 °C for up to 3 h, demonstrating that SF(DPPB)4 is a promising non-fullerene acceptor for future practical application in PSCs.
