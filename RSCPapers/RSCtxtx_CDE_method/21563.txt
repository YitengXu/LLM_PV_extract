Highly efficient photo-generated carrier transfer is one of the key factors in determining the performance of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we demonstrate a strategy for improved hole transfer and collection by employing a composite hole transporting material (HTM) consisting of free standing Ni nanobelts dispersed in the widely used 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). It is found that power conversion efficiency (PCE) and ambient stability of mesoscopic PSCs have been improved. To be more specific, in order to prevent significant charge recombination induced by direct contact of the metal Ni with a perovskite absorber, a spiro-OMeTAD intermediate layer was spin-coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer prior to the sequentially deposited layers of Ni nanobelts and spiro-OMeTAD. With this architecture, the optimized PSC achieved a champion PCE of 16.18% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.64 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.3% under reverse scanning. Despite the small J–V hysteresis, a higher stabilized efficiency up to 14.47% near the maximum power point could be reached for the device fabricated with 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts compared with the pristine one (12.05%). However in the presence of highly hygroscopic lithium-bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (Li-TFSI), PSCs in conjunction with Ni nanobelts present an impressively favorable ambient stability with an observed PCE retention rate of over 85% after 4-week storage with exposure to ambient air without any encapsulation.

Very recently, a great breakthrough in the performance of photovoltaic cells has been achieved through the use of semiconducting organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, which have high extinction coefficients, direct bandgaps, large exciton diffusion lengths, excellent absorption throughout the UV-vis-NIR spectrum and ambipolar charge transport capability. The highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% has been achieved for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Following light absorption, the generation and separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs occur within the bulk of the perovskite absorber, which then need to be in contact with charge-selective n type and p type transport layers for efficient extraction and transportation with minimal recombination losses. In a typical mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction, the TiO2 compact layer works as a hole-blocking layer and simultaneously provides pathways for electron transfer together with a thicker mesoporous TiO2 layer. Generally, a p-type organic small-molecule, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), is the most commonly used hole transporting material (HTM). Owing to the poor conductivity of the amorphous spiro-OMeTAD, it generally needs to be p-doped with lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Li-TFSI) for increasing the carrier density in the presence of oxygen. However, the highly hygroscopic nature of the lithium-based dopant could have a significant role in introducing water molecules in the air into the perovskite crystal structure, where the unbound methylammonium iodide is water-soluble and can readily escape the compound structure leaving behind a residual layer of lead iodide thus losing its function as a light harvester. Hence, a great deal of efforts have been devoted to developing dopant-free novel p-type organic molecules (e.g. poly(triarylamine), carbazole derivatives, tetrathiafulvalene derivatives, polyfluorene derivatives, and PFI/PEDOT:PSS) and inorganic semiconductors (e.g. NiO, CuI, Cu:NiOx, CuSCN, PbS colloidal quantum dots, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes) as efficient and stable HTMs. In addition, the intrinsically low hole mobility of the amorphous spiro-OMeTAD can be improved to a certain extent by adding new chemical dopants (e.g. spiro(TFSI)2, cobalt dopants, palladium nanosheets or iodide reduced graphene oxide), which can be viewed as a facile means of controllably increasing the conductivity of HTMs instead of Li-TFSI. Furthermore, Mei et al. developed hole conductor-free PSCs, yielding a certified PCE of 12.8% and high stability. Even so, lithium salts are still widely used for high performance PSCs, and how to solve the negative impact of the hygroscopic nature on the device ambient stability is one of the primary targets.

In this contribution, we present a new strategy for improved hole transfer and ambient stability of mesoporous PSCs in the presence of Li-TFSI. Briefly, as highly efficient hole collectors, free-standing Ni nanobelts were dispersed in spiro-OMeTAD to enhance the hole transfer rate. To suppress the charge recombination induced by the direct electric contact of Ni nanobelts with a perovskite layer, a thin intermediate layer of spiro-OMeTAD (∼65 nm) was first deposited on the as-prepared perovskite absorber by spin coating, followed immediately by the successive deposition of Ni nanobelts and spiro-OMeTAD. A total of ∼20% improvement in the stabilized efficiency near the maximum power point can be achieved when using 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts compared with the pristine one (14.47% vs. 12.05%). Although Li-TFSI still exists in HTMs in this study, encouragingly, devices in conjunction with Ni nanobelts present a superior stability when exposed to air with a relative humidity of ∼30–40% (retaining over 85% of the initial value after 28 days). The role of using Ni nanobelts was justified and interpreted to improve PCE and inhibit water ingress for an improved ambient stability.

Ni nanobelts were prepared by the facile hydrothermal method, and the detailed synthesis procedure has been described in ref. 33. Typically, NiCl2·6H2O (50 mM), Na2C4H4O6 (0.75 M), NaOH (5 M), and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) (15 mM) were mixed in 50 mL distilled water and stirred until dissolved in a glass bottle with magnetic stirring. Afterwards, NaH2PO2·H2O (0.4 M) was added into the mixed solution and subsequently transferred to a stainless poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon)-lined 100 mL capacity autoclave. The autoclave was put into an oven at 110 °C for 24 h. After cooling, a black fluffy solid product floating upon the solution surface could be easily observed. The final product was filtered, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times to remove any alkaline and surfactant that remained in the final product, and then finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h.


Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass was first cut into 15 mm × 15 mm pieces and then etched with Zn powder and HCl to obtain the desired electrode design. Then the etched substrates were cleaned with soapy water, deionized water, anhydrous ethanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol by sonication for 20 min. The dried substrate was treated by means of UV/ozone cleaning for 15 min before use. The TiO2 precursor solution for the compact layer coating was prepared by slowly adding solution A (350 μL, isopropyl titanate in 2.5 mL anhydrous ethanol) into solution B (35 μL, 2 M HCl in 2.5 mL anhydrous ethanol) under vigorous stirring for 30 min. A ∼40 nm thick electron-accepting TiO2 compact layer was spin-coated (2000 rpm for 60 s) and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The solution of mesoporous TiO2 for spin-coating was prepared by diluting the commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18NR-T) with ethanol in a weight ratio of 2:7. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was afterward deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s followed by an annealing process at 500 °C for 30 min. After having cooled down to room temperature, all substrates were transferred to a glovebox for further processing. A thin layer of PbI2 was initially deposited onto the as-grown mesoporous scaffold TiO2 layer by spin coating with a solution of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1.2 M) at 5000 rpm for 60 s, and immediately placed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min. After that, the pre-deposited PbI2 was immersed into CH3NH3I solution dissolved in anhydrous isopropanol (10 mg mL−1) for 5 minutes and then rinsed gently with isopropanol to remove the excess reagents. Subsequently, the films were left on a hot plate in the glovebox at 100 °C for 30 min to promote crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Then a thin intermediate layer of the organic HTM was deposited by spin-coating (6000 rpm for 60 s) with a solution mixture, which was prepared by adding 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 17.5 μL 520 mg mL−1 LiN(CF3SO2)2N (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile to 1 mL chlorobenzene. The Ni nanobelts were dissolved in chlorobenzene with four concentrations (1.2, 1.8, 7.4, 29.4 mg mL−1), which were then spin-coated onto the spiro-OMeTAD thin layers, respectively. Afterwards, spiro-OMeTAD was further deposited at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed immediately by leaving in air overnight. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Au electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact under a vacuum level of 10−6 Torr. Under the condition that other factors are kept constant, the pristine device applying the HTM without Ni nanobelts was simultaneously prepared for comparison. The effective area of all the cells was 0.10 cm2.


SEM imaging was conducted on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL, Japan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Ni nanobelts was recorded by using a SHIMADZU XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. For measuring the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, simulated sunlight with AM 1.5G was generated with a class AAA solar simulator (Sun 3000 Solar Simulators, ABET Technologies, USA), which was calibrated using a certified silicon reference cell to give simulated 100 mW cm−2 equivalent irradiance. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled PSCs were recorded with a software-controlled sourcemeter (Keithley 2401, U.S.A.) under the solar simulator. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) with wavelengths ranging from 300 to 800 nm was measured with a quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at an applied bias of open circuit voltage (Voc) and a frequency range from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with an alternating current modulation signal of 10 mV under illumination of simulated solar light. Z-View analyst software was used to model the Nyquist plots obtained from the EIS measurements. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the HTM/CH3NH3PbI3/m-Al2O3 samples were recorded by using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). In order to characterize the water absorbing ability of different HTMs, the 40 μL HTM solution mixture with and without Ni nanobelts was added dropwise onto cleaned glass slides (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm), respectively, and then allowed to dry completely. Both samples were measured by means of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Bruker Optic, Tensor27).



Fig. 1A gives a typical FESEM image of hydrothermally synthesized Ni nanobelts with the long belt-like nanostructures (see Experimental section for details). An individual nanobelt has a fairly uniform width, ranging from several tens of nanometers to 300 nm. Fig. 1B presents the side of an individual nanobelt, only ∼12 nm in thickness. The XRD pattern of Ni nanobelts is shown in Fig. 1C, in which the sharp diffraction peaks at 44.52°, 51.82° and 76.36° can be assigned to the (101), (200) and (220) planes of the cubic phase, indicating the pure crystallinity of Ni. The top view FESEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the TiO2/FTO glass (Fig. 1D) clearly indicates the formation of high-quality polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 with a crack-free coverage, a well-developed grain structure and large crystallites (200–500 nm). It is known that a direct electrical contact between the perovskite and Ni nanobelts would lead to significant charge recombination losses. Thus, a 65 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD intermediate layer was spin-coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer prior to the deposition of Ni nanobelts, Fig. 1E. Fig. 1F shows a continuous and flat surface of spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting a complete isolation between Ni nanobelts and CH3NH3PbI3. A representative cross-sectional FESEM image of a complete mesoscopic PSC in conjunction with Ni nanobelts exhibits a typical multilayer structure, Fig. 1G, consisting of ∼600 nm-thick conductive FTO, a ∼40 nm-thick compact TiO2 layer, a ∼290 nm-thick CH3NH3PbI3 filled mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, a ∼190 nm-thick CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer, a ∼235 nm-thick HTM, and a ∼100 nm-thick Au back electrode. It should be noted that the HTM contains a ∼170 nanometer-thick Ni nanobelt/spiro-OMeTAD composite layer, in addition to the spiro-OMeTAD intermediate layer. Fig. 1H and I show the top surface morphologies of Ni nanobelt-based PSCs, where the twisting and winding Ni nanobelts are apparently protruded from the Au back electrode. The FESEM images from the top view of the HTM surface with different Ni nanobelt concentrations are provided in Fig. S1. When the concentration of Ni nanobelts reaches 7.4 mg mL−1, some of them aggregate to form larger bundles than in the case of 1.2 and 1.8 mg mL−1. With a further increase of Ni nanobelts (29.4 mg mL−1), a large number of randomly distributed Ni nanobelts become a significant obstacle for the formation of a continuous spiro-OMeTAD layer under the same spin coating process conditions. Hence, the surface of the HTM was almost completely covered by the Ni nanobelts.


Fig. 2A shows photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics with the reverse scan for the best performing devices by incorporating different contents of Ni nanobelts into spiro-OMeTAD. The J–V curve of the device fabricated with 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts exhibits the best photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.64 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.3%, yielding a champion PCE  of 16.18% under simulated AM 1.5 100 mW cm−2 solar irradiation, as listed in Table 1. As a proof of principle for selective charge transport of photogenerated holes mediated by the Ni nanobelts, we initially fabricated pristine devices without the addition of Ni nanobelts, yielding a relatively low PCE of 13.29% with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 19.55 mA cm−2, and an FF of 67.7% (Table 1). Impressively, a total of ∼22% improvement in the overall average value of PCE has been achieved for 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-based devices compared with the pristine one (15.57% vs. 12.76%), indicating the great potential for further optimization of photovoltaic performance. But as aforementioned, a further increase of Ni nanobelts would lead to larger surface roughness, which makes it difficult to form continuous spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrode layers. This situation might explain why the decreased performance was observed when the doping concentration of the Ni nanobelt was increased from 1.8% to 7.4% and to 29.4%. The corresponding J–V results with the forward scan are given in Fig. S2 and Table S1, indicating the existence of small J–V hysteresis behavior. Besides, as shown in Fig. S3, the 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-based devices exhibit relatively poor J–V characteristics with low FF and Voc values when no spiro-OMeTAD intermediate layer is applied. This poor performance most likely arises from a direct electrical contact between the CH3NH3PbI3 and Ni nanobelts, which results in the increased charge recombination losses. Fig. 2B shows the IPCE spectra in the region from UV-visible to near infrared (300–800 nm). The integrals of IPCEs over the whole spectral response region (JIPCE) are in good agreement with the measured Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves of all the devices, within a 5% error (Table 1). It is known that the IPCE value is determined by the synergistic effect of light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), electron injection efficiency (ηe-inj), hole injection efficiency (ηh-inj) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) by an external circuit. The cell using 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts exhibits a little improvement of the IPCE values at wavelengths ranging between 350 and 750 nm, suggesting that the use of Ni nanobelts has made predominate contribution to the improvement of photo-generated hole extraction and collection.

Fig. 3A exhibits the energy level diagram of a completed PSC in conjunction with Ni nanobelts. The work function of Ni (−5.04 eV) is a little higher than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV) and sprio-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV), indicating that Ni nanobelts could afford an efficient hole-extraction pathway to the Au back electrode. Fig. 3B shows the schematic illustration of the hole transport pathway when incorporating free-standing Ni nanobelts into spiro-OMeTAD. The hole conductivity of the HTM is one of the crucial factors for efficient charge transfer and collection. As an alternative route for hole transport, the holes arriving at the interface between two spiro-OMeTAD layers are subsequently collected by neighboring conductive Ni nanobelts and passed to the Au back electrode rapidly. Hence, Ni nanobelts can be viewed as efficient hole collectors, which can be beneficial in reducing the hole transfer path and accelerating the hole transfer rate from the perovskite to the back electrode.

Fig. 4A shows the transient behavior of photocurrent density, in which the device fabricated with 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts is stabilized within seconds to the largest Jsc of 20.89 mA cm−2 among the cells (see the dash line). All the Jsc values are in excellent agreement with the corresponding integrated IPCE values (Fig. 2B). In order to avoid erroneous PCE estimation induced by the negligible hysteresis from our J–V measurements, the photocurrent density of PSCs with different HTMs held at a forward bias (Vm) was set close to the maximum power point as a function of time, which can achieve stabilized power output as shown in Fig. 4B. The 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-modified device can reach the highest steady-state current density (Jm) of 19.56 mA cm−2 at a faster rate, and consequently results in the highest stabilized power output efficiency (PCEm = (Vm × Jm)%) as high as 14.47% with a Vm of 0.74 V. However, the pristine cell only delivered the highest PCEm of 12.05% with a Jm of 17.21 mA cm−2 and a Vm of 0.70 V (Table 2). This result indicates that the poor performance of the pristine device is mainly due to the loss of Jm, which conforms to the transient Jsc behavior. To illustrate the reproducibility of these high-efficiency PSCs, the statistical data obtained from 5 devices are shown in Fig. S4. The mean value of PCE for the pristine device was 11.41 ± 0.55% while it increased to 13.79 ± 0.57% for the 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-based one.

The characteristics of hole extraction and collection can be directly reflected in the PL emission spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively (Fig. 5). EIS of PSCs was performed from 1 MHz to 100 mHz under illuminated conditions. Fig. 5A exhibits Nyquist plots of devices applying (a) 0 and (b) 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts, which can be used to provide insights into the internal charge carrier transport and recombination. The inset in Fig. 5A presents the equivalent circuit model used for fitting Nyquist plots. For both devices, two typical arcs can be distinguished from the Nyquist plots. The high-frequency arc was assigned to the process of hole transport (Rtrans), and the main arc at low frequency was attributed to the recombination resistance (Rrec), the larger Rrec implicates a stronger suppression of charge recombination. Rs, consisting mainly of conducting wires, contacts, and the sheet resistance of the collecting electrodes, is equal to the value of the high frequency intercept on the real axis. The Rs value in Fig. 5A(a) is a little larger than that in Fig. 5A(b) (1.44 vs. 1.02 Ω cm2), which is probably due to the fact that the presence of Ni nanobelts leads to the increase of the HTM surface roughness (see Fig. S1) and thus results in the increased contact resistance between the HTM and the Au back electrode. Compared to the pristine device, the lower Rtrans of the 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-based one indicates that the holes extracted from the perovskite absorber layer can be transported to the external circuit throughout the HTM at a fastest rate, which verifies the correctness of the analysis results from Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 5B, Rtrans decreases along with the increase of the Ni nanobelt concentration and the 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-based device reaches the lowest value of Rtrans. However, the presence of a high carrier concentration in Ni nanobelts would induce a significantly enhanced charge recombination rate, thereby reducing the cell efficiency. It is known that ηcc is determined by the competition between charge transportation and recombination. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the content of Ni nanobelts for the maximum ηcc and PCE. Fig. 5C shows the steady-state PL spectra of the Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM and both samples display characteristic emission peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 at around 775 nm. The PL emission peak in Fig. 5C(b) exhibits a significant quenching effect and is quenched to a lower level compared to that in Fig. 5C(a), indicating that the photogenerated holes can be quickly extracted to the HTM by incorporating 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts before bulk recombination. As a consequence, highly efficient hole extraction and collection synergistically lead to increases in both FF and Jsc, thereby resulting in a significant increase in the average PCE value compared to that of the pristine device (15.57–12.76%).
The application of PSCs in real life requires not only a high PCE, but also a stable photovoltaic performance under outdoor conditions. Hence, we investigate the ambient stabilities of the unencapsulated devices as a function of storage time, Fig. 6A. The devices were maintained in the dark under a controlled condition with a relative humidity of ∼30–40% at ambient temperature. The measurements were carried out under the simulated AM 1.5G one sun illumination under ambient conditions. The efficiency of the pristine device was found to drop significantly and decrease by more than half of the original level after 28 days, while the one using 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts showed an improved stability in air and its PCE was retained as high as 85% of the initial value. This may be ascribed to the fact that the highly hygroscopic nature of the lithium-based dopant could be efficiently inhibited by shielding it from atmospheric moisture with the action of Ni nanobelts with a high specific surface area. Fig. 6B presents the FT-IR spectra of HTMs deposited onto glass slides. It is obvious that all three samples have an obvious broad absorption peak at ∼3500 nm−1, contributing to the infrared absorption characteristic peaks of H2O. As indicated by the arrows, the absorption peak intensity of the HTM applying 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts (Fig. 6B(a)) is lower than that of the one without modification of Ni nanobelts (Fig. 6B(c)), which confirms that the addition of Ni nanobelts results in remarkably enhanced resistance to water ingress. Hence, the Ni nanobelts could efficiently prevent the infiltration of water molecules into the perovskite crystal structure, and thus slow down the degradation process and maintain the long-term stability of solar cells. However, the pure glass slides exhibit the lowest peak (Fig. 6B(b)), implying that the Ni nanobelts can only prevent the lithium-based dopant from absorbing atmospheric moisture to a certain extent.

In summary, highly conductive Ni nanobelts can be viewed as an efficient hole collector to benefit in reducing the hole transfer path and accelerating its transfer rate from the perovskite to the back electrode. The optimized 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelt-based devices with the advantages of enhanced hole extraction and transport result in up to ∼22% increase in the average PCE when compared with the pristine device (15.57% vs. 12.76%). Despite the small J–V hysteresis, a higher PCEm as high as 14.47% can be reached for the devices fabricated with 1.8 mg mL−1 Ni nanobelts compared with the pristine one (12.05%). Additionally, the Ni nanobelt-based PSCs display outstanding ambient stability under a controlled humidity condition of ∼30–40% in the dark. Overall, this work provides a new insight into the design and fabrication of effective HTMs, which would undoubtedly facilitate the industrial production of PSCs with high efficiency as well as long-term stability.
