In this paper, a series of new metallophthalocyanines, including ferrocene groups, were designed, synthesized and, characterized, and their photovoltaic properties were investigated as alternative electron-donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. These products were synthesized by a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between tetraiodophthalocyanine and ethynyl ferrocene. The newly synthesized phthalocyanines (4–6) were characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis, 1H NMR, and MALDI-TOF spectroscopic methods and elemental analysis. The electrochemical characterizations were carried out by cyclic voltammetry as well as differential pulse voltammetry. Density functional theory calculations were realized to prove the charge separation between ferrocene as an electron-donor and the phthalocyanine ring as an acceptor. According to UV-Vis measurements, a 25 nm red-shift was observed for complex 4 compared with complexes 5 and 6. Finally, the photovoltaic performance of these compounds used as an electron-donor moiety in a BHJ device were investigated. A function of different blend ratios was tested by fabricating a series of BHJ devices with the architecture of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/4–6: PCBM blend/Ag with an identical thickness of the active layer. The results indicated that the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of BHJ devices exhibited a strong blend-ratio dependence. The maximum power conversion efficiency was obtained by 5-based devices, as 3.65%, with a blend ratio of 1.5:1.0 under standard AM 1.5 illumination.

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are aromatic heterocyclic conjugated macrocycles bearing delocalized 18π-electrons. Their properties such as application-oriented designability, thermal-chemical stability and high absorption coefficient have made phthalocyanine compounds indispensable in many areas. Pcs have a strong absorption due to the π–π* transition in the red/near infrared region and bathochromic effect, which occurs when increasing the π conjugation in the system. Pcs that have a bathochromic effect in the absorption band become more sensitive to light and have exhibited strong properties in photovoltaic applications. The physicochemical properties of metallophthalocyanines are related to the extensive π-electron delocalization of the Pc rings, redox activity of the central metals and functionality of the substituent environments of the ring. Combining phthalocyanines with redox active molecules, such as the ferrocene group, allows maximizing their optical and electrochemical properties. Ferrocene and ferrocenyl derivatives easily undergo reversible oxidation driven by some chemical oxidizing agents. Thus, the electrochemical and physicochemical effects from the ferrocene group and its substituents can be easily determined. The physicochemical properties of metallated ferrocene-phthalocyanine compounds are excellent due to the ongoing conjugation from the substituent to the Pc cavity and thanks to the strongly electron-donating nature of the ferrocene group.

As is known, the active layer of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell consists of a blend of electron-donating and -accepting materials. More recently, commercially available poly(3-hexylthiophen-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) has gained more importance as an electron-donor material in this type of device. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT-based devices is still not enough for practical applications because of the limited absorption wavelength and substrate-dependent orientations of microcrystalline P3HT. Various strategies have been adopted in order to overcome these limitations, such as the synthesis of new donor materials, and employing an interfacial layer. [3-(2-Benzothiazolyl)-7-(diethylamino)coumarin], P3OT, MEH-PPV, and merocyanine dye MD 304 have been developed and characterized as donor materials for BHJ devices. More recently, it was reported that functionalized phthalocyanine compounds, which are known as small molecule semiconductors, have great potential as donor materials for BHJ solar cells. For this purpose, various Pc compounds bearing different substituted groups have been explored to develop efficient BHJ solar cells. The good electron-donation capability and considerably low oxidation potential of ferrocene and its derivatives make them potential options for the development of new materials for various purposes. On the other hand, although there are many studies in the current literature on the synthesis and characterization of ferrocene and phthalocyanine compounds separately, there is a very limited number of studies on the synthesis of ferrocene-containing phthalocyanine complexes and their applications in BHJ as donor materials.
Herein we report on the preparation of new metallophthalocyanines connected with peripheral ferrocene units by using a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. The influence of the central metal atom (zinc, indium and lutetium) on the photovoltaic performance is explained by clarifying the electrochemical and optical behaviours of metallophthalocyanines containing ferrocene moieties. The band gap as calculated from the absorption edges changed from 1.68 eV to 1.59 eV depending on the central metal atom. In addition, the HOMO–LUMO band gaps measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were found between 0.97 eV and 1.19 eV. As a result, a 3.65% efficiency was achieved in a BHJ device containing indium-based metallophthalocyanines as a donor unit in the active layer.

Novel target peripheral-substituted metallophthalocyanines (4–6) bearing ferrocene groups that were directly connected to the Pc ring by ethynyl bonds were synthesized by the reaction of ethynyl ferrocene and the corresponding tetra-iodo metallo (zinc, indium and lutetium) phthalocyanines using a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction at room temperature in an argon atmosphere (Scheme 1). All the novel ferrocene-phthalocyanines were characterized by common analytical methods, such as FT-IR, UV-Vis, 1H NMR, TGA, DSC, MALDI-TOF-MS, elemental analysis and cyclic voltammetry spectroscopic methods. The geometry optimization and HOMO–LUMO orbitals presentations of the compounds were theoretically calculated using the B3LYP/SDD basis set by density functional theory (DFT).


The starting ethynyl ferrocene compound showed an intense vibration peak around 3275 cm−1 and a sharp moderate peak at 2101 cm−1 in its FT-IR spectrum, belonging to (–CC–H) and (–CC–) stretching vibrations, respectively. One of these peaks, (–CC–H, at 3275 cm−1) disappeared and the other (–CC–) peak was nearly 90–100 cm−1 shifted after the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between ethynyl ferrocene and tetra-iodo-metallophthalocyanines (1–3) in the FT-IR spectra of the novel ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines (4–6). Also, the –CO stretching peaks observed at 1725–1720 cm−1 were due to the axially acetate group for the ethynyl ferrocene-substituted indium (5) and lutetium (6) phthalocyanines.

Comparing the initial metallophthalocyanines (1–3) with the targeted metallophthalocyanines (4–6), nearly 30 nm red-shifted Q bands were observed in the UV-vis spectra of these novel Pcs due to the direct conjugation between the ferrocenyl group and phthalocyanine skeleton (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1–S5 in the ESI). The optical band gap (Eg) values were calculated as 1.06, 0.97 and 1.19 eV for compounds 4, 5 and 6, respectively, with respect to Eg (eV) = hc/λonset (h = 6.626 × 10−34 J s, c = 3 × 1010 cm s−1, 1 eV = 1.602 × 10−19 J) (Table 1).

UV-Vis spectra of all the ferrocene-bearing metallated phthalocyanines (4–6) were recorded at different concentrations (1–10 μM) and no aggregation was observed by increasing the concentration. The three phthalocyanine compounds were in compliance with Lambert–Beer's rule, and the graphics curves were found to be linear (Fig. 2 and Fig. S6, S7 in the ESI).
Generally, the 1H-NMR spectra of metal complexes containing cobalt or iron metals do not perform well due to the paramagnetic nature of these metals. However, 1H-NMR spectra of complexes containing diamagnetic iron(III) atoms, such as ferrocene, are available in the literature. Based on this information, the 1H-NMR spectra of 4–6 showed two main signals at 7.81–7.33 for phthalocyanine-ring protons and at 5.07–4.17 ppm for ferrocene-ring protons. Additionally, compounds 5 and 6 showed a singlet peak at 2.51 or 2.26 ppm due to the acetate groups on the central metal (Fig. S8–S10 in the ESI).
The MALDI-TOF mass spectra also confirmed the proposed structures of the novel ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines 4, 5 and 6. Dithranol (DHB) was used as a MALDI matrix. The molecular ions were easily identified at m/z: 1412.64 [M + 2H]+ for 4, 1461.51 [M-OAc]+ for 5 and 1740.28 as [M + DHB + 5H]+ for 6 (Fig. S11–S13 in the ESI).

Electrochemical measurements of the ethynyl ferrocene and ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines (4–6) were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as well as differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) on a GCE working electrode in nonpolar and non-coordinating dichloromethane (DCM) media, including TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. The aim of this investigation was to determination of the effect of the metal and to determine the band gap values with the redox behaviour of the phthalocyanines. The HOMO/LUMO band gap energy values obtained from all the measured redox potential onsets are given in Fig. 3 and Table 1. All the calculations were carried out using the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = [(Eox/red − E1/2(ferrocene) + 4.8] eV. In the anodic region, the characteristic Fc/Fc+ redox couple on 4–6 was observed with a half-wave potential at E1/2,ox = 0.75 eV; E1/2,ox = 0.69 eV; E1/2,ox = 0.58 eV, respectively. On the other hand, two reversible redox couples were observed in the cathodic regime of 4–6 attributed to the reduction of the phthalocyanine unit bearing different central metal ions. The multistep reduction could be confirmed according to these results. The HOMO/LUMO band gap values calculated from the oxidation/reduction edges on DPV were found to be 1.06, 0.97 and 1.19 eV for 4–6, respectively. The low band gaps could be due to the intermolecular interaction between the peripheral ferrocene unit and the central metal ion in the phthalocyanine cavity. When the optical and electrochemical band gap values were compared, it could be seen that they were not compatible. It was shown that the electroactive and photoactive centres of 4–6 were different from each other. This charge process can be advantageous for photovoltaic applications.


The thermal stabilities of the ferrocene-bearing phthalocyanines (4–6) were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Measurements were obtained at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from +25 °C to +900 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere.

The decomposition of zinc(II) ferrocene-phthalocyanine (4) was found to be 91.45% at 215.50 °C of the residual substance and 60.93% at 751.76 °C. The decomposition of indium(III) ferrocene-phthalocyanine (5) was found to be 94.14% at 515.79 °C of the residual substance and 46.28% at 676.64 °C. The decomposition of lutetium(III) ferrocene-phthalocyanine (6) was found to be 86.37% at 210.93 °C of the residual substance and 67.54% at 347.18 °C. In the first decomposition, indium phthalocyanine was more stable than the zinc and lutetium phthalocyanines. In the second decomposition, the zinc phthalocyanine compound was much more durable than the indium and lutetium phthalocyanine compounds (751.76 °C) suggesting that more stable structure of the zinc Pc due to the zinc metal fitted perfectly into the phthalocyanine centre. The indium and lutetium metal ions did not fit inside the phthalocyanine's cavity because of their large atomic sizes. Indium metal was more stable than the lutetium metal ion in the phthalocyanine because indium metal was closer to the centre (Fig. S14–S16 in the ESI).
The glass transition temperatures (Tg) for the ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines (4–6) were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the peaks were observed at 176.84 °C, 176.53 °C and 206.27 °C, respectively. The thermal decay curves and glass transition values of the phthalocyanines (4–6) are given in Fig. S17–S19 in ESI.

In order to understand of electronic/structural properties and also the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the iodine- and ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines, they were optimized by the density functional theory method (DFT) with the Becke-3-Lee-Young-Parr (B3LYP)-SDD basis set. Considering the optimized geometries of both the iodine- and ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines (1–6), it was seen that the substituents were planar together with the phthalocyanine skeleton and the total energy value of both the iodine (1–3)- and ferrocene (4–6)-substituted phthalocyanines were calculated as 52715.73 eV for 1, 52804.71 eV for 2, 86397.78 eV for 3, 115310.33 eV for 4, 115399.32 eV for 5 and 148992.38 eV for 6. In addition, zinc metal appeared to enter the phthalocyanine cavity while indium and lutetium were outside of the cavity due to their larger metal atomic size than the zinc metal (Scheme 1 and Fig. S20 and S21 in the ESI).

The HOMO and LUMO orbital energy levels of the ferrocene-substituted phthalocyanines decreased due to the electron-donating ferrocenyl group and its direct bonding to the Pc core. This is shown by the electron density map given in Fig. S22 in the ESI. All the electrons in the molecule can easily move from the ferrocene groups to the phthalocyanine centre because of the direct conjugation. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy band gap levels showed that zinc phthalocyanines bearing iodine/ferrocene (1 and 4) had higher band gap values than the indium (2 and 5) and lutetium (3 and 6) phthalocyanines (Fig. 4) and these values were determined as 2.19 eV for 1, 2.12 eV for 2, 2.13 eV for 3, 2.04 eV for 4, 1.96 eV for 5, 1.97 eV for 6.

At the first stage of the characterization studies, we focused on fabricating BHJ devices based on 4–6 and PCBM as donors and acceptors, respectively. In order to be sure that any changes in the measured I–V characteristics were due to the adsorption behaviour of 4–6, devices were fabricated with an identical blend ratio and thickness. BHJ devices were also fabricated and characterized with P3HT and PCBM for comparison purposes. For 4–6, PCBM-based devices were first optimized for the donor (4–6):acceptor (PCBM) ratio by examining the I–V characteristic of the devices. The optimum donor:acceptor ratio resulting from the optimization was then used for fabrication of the reference P3HT:PCBM devices. The J–V characteristics of the best-performing BHJ devices obtained from an average of three devices with an individual area of 0.32 cm2 per device under 100 mW cm−2 irradiance conditions with 4–6 as the donors are presented in Fig. 5.

We must mention here that, various solvents were investigated during the active layer formation, and it was observed that chlorobenzene offered for its best film homogeneity properties. It was obvious that the photovoltaic performance of the devices strongly depended on the molecular structure of the donor material. The best photovoltaic performance in terms of short circuit current density and open circuit voltage was obtained from the 5-based devices with a blend ratio of 1.8:1 (n: 3.59%) for all compositions of 4–6 and PCBM (Table 2).

After that, we focused on the fabrication of 5-based devices with different blend ratios of 5. The results obtained from this investigation are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 3. As is clear from Fig. 6, the open circuit voltage improved with 5 ratios of 1.5:1.0 in the blends. When the blend ratio of 5 reached 1.5:1.0, the open circuit voltage began to decrease with further increasing the 5 ratio.

In order to be sure that the observed blend-ratio-dependent photovoltaic behaviour of the 5-based device was repeatable, the I–V characteristic measurements were repeated on another set of 5:PCBM devices. It was verified from these measurements that the observed dependence of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current density on the blend ratio were reproducible.
The blend-ratio dependence of the photovoltaic parameters is a well-known phenomenon in BHJ devices. More recently, the effects of different composition ratios of donor:acceptor (P3HT:PC61BM) in the active layer on the photovoltaic parameters of the BHJ solar cells were systematically studied by Patra et al. The authors reported that the BHJ devices exhibited good photovoltaic performance when the P3HT:PC61BM composition ratios ranged from 1.0:0.4 to 1.0:1.2. It was also reported in this study that the devices showed poor photovoltaic conversion efficiency with further increasing or decreasing of the P3HT:PC61BM ratio.
The effect of the acceptor concentration on the photovoltaic parameters of [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester-based BHJ devices were investigated by Jimbo et al. and it was found that the charge separation between the donor and acceptor could be improved by modification of the donor:acceptor ratio. Another study on the dependency of the performance parameters of BHJ-based devices on the blend ratio indicated that the performance of a BHJ solar cell device could be improved by decreasing the ratio of the electron-acceptor material in the active layer.
The effects of the acceptor concentration on the photovoltaic parameters of [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester-based BHJ devices were investigated by Jimbo et al. and it was found that the charge separation between the donor and acceptor could be improved by modification of the donor:acceptor ratio. Another study on the dependency of the performance parameters of BHJ-based devices on blend ratio indicated that the performance of a BHJ solar cell device could be improved by decreasing the ratio of the electron-acceptor material in the active layer.
In order to comparatively investigate, the performance of the Pc compounds in BHJ devices as electron donors, a reference BHJ device (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM blend/Ag) with the same blend ratio of donor:acceptor (1.5:1.0) was also fabricated and characterized. Fig. 7 compares the photovoltaic behaviour of 5:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM with the same blend ratio of both devices. It should be mentioned here that all of the results presented in Fig. 7 were obtained under the completely same conditions. A close investigation of Fig. 7 indicates that compound 5 had good photovoltaic performance, at least in terms of the open circuit voltage.

We demonstrated in this study that the ratio of novel zinc(II), indium(III) and lutetium(III) phthalocyanines containing ferrocene groups as a donor material can show a detrimental effect on PCBM-based BHJ solar cell devices. Analysis of the electrochemical and optical properties showed that all the synthesized phthalocyanine derivatives have suitable HOMO–LUMO band gap levels for BHJ solar cell applications. According to the theoretical DFT results, good charge separation was observed using ferrocene as donor and phthalocyanine as acceptor moieties for all the synthesized products. It was observed that the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of the devices increased by the increase in the donor (4–6 in our case) ratio in the blend up to 1.8:1.0, but then the performance of the devices began to decrease by further increasing of the donor ratio. This study shows that a high photovoltaic power conversion efficiency in BHJ solar cells could be achieved by utilizing compound 5 as a donor material with a blend ratio of 1.5:1.0. The results demonstrate that the synthesized ferrocene-phthalocyanines are suitable donor materials for BHJ solar cell applications.


4-Iodophthalonitrile, ethynyl ferrocene, zinc(II) acetate [Zn(OAc)2], indium(III) acetate [In(OAc)3], lutetium(III) acetate [Lu(OAc)3], Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI and all used solvents were purchased from Aldrich. All the reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere.

The purity of the products was checked by thin-layer-chromatography (TLC). FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Schimadzu FT-IR 8300 spectrometer with ATR capability. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Schimadzu UV-1601 UV-vis spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a BRUKER Autoflex mass spectrometer using the MALDI-TOF technique. Dithranol (DIT, 20 mg mL−1 in THF) was used as the matrix. The MALDI samples were prepared by mixing the complex (2 mg mL−1 in THF) with the matrix solution (1:10 v/v) in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf micro tube. Finally, 1 μL of this mixture was deposited on the sample plate, dried at room temperature, and then analyzed. Elemental analyses were carried out using a LECO CHN 932. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851 instrument (heating rate of 10 °C min−1), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed with a Mettler Toledo DSC 821e equipped with Stare software (scanning rate of 10 °C min−1) and operated under a nitrogen flow (50 mL min−1).
To understand electrochemical properties and for calculation of the band gap energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a three-electrode cell system comprising a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, and platinum wire and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Also, these measurements were recorded on a CH instruments 617D instrument in CH2Cl2, containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte recorded at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1.
All the theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 suite program. The molecular geometries of the ferrocene-phthalocyanine compounds (4–6) were optimized using the density functional theory (DFT)-B3LYP-SDD basis set. The molecular orbital contours were visualized using GaussView 5.


4–6: PCBM blend-containing devices were fabricated on patterned F-doped indium tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates. After routine cleaning, a thin (∼30 nm) layer of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the FTO substrates and thermally treated at 120 °C for 40 min. The photosensitive layer was formed by spin coating of the blend solutions of 4–6 and PCBM with various compositions (0.3:1, 0.6:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, 1.8:1, 2.2:1, by weight). During the fabrication of the BHJ devices, the ratio of the acceptor material (PCBM in our case) was fixed at 1 and the ratio of the donor materials (4–6) was varied from 0.3 to 2.2 because of their well-known critical impact on the device performance. Then, a cathode electrode with a thickness of 150 nm was formed by thermal evaporation of the Ag metal (with a 99.99% purity). The photovoltaic performance of the Pc compounds in BHJ as the donor material was investigated by means of current–voltage (I–V) measurements on the fabricated devices both in the dark and under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiance conditions. For the duration of the I–V measurements in both the dark and illumination conditions, a source meter (Keithley 2400 source meter) was used. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the devices, as usual, the following formulas were used, where the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the BHJ devices were defined as;

η = Pmax/Pin
(1)
where
Pin is the power of incident light, and Pmax is the maximum power output obtained, which is defined as

Pmax = JSC × VOC × fill factor (FF)
(2)
where the fill factor is defined as the maximum power output of the solar cell per unit area divided by the product of short circuit current density (
JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC), which is defined as

FF = Jm × Vm/JSC × VOC
(3)
