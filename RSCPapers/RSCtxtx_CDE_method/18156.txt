Indacenodithiophene-based multi-fused aromatic structures have been largely developed as non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells and gained great successes. However, they are less explored as electron transporting materials for perovskite solar cells, despite their compatible energy levels and good electron mobilities. In this work, three n-type non-fullerene acceptors are applied as electron transporting materials in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). All three compounds are of a rigid ladder-type structure with different conjugation lengths of the central multi-fused ring and end-capped with 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN). Consequently, IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC with five, six and seven fused-rings are obtained. The longest conjugation length in ITCPTC leads to the enhanced electron mobility, and electron extraction and electron transporting ability. In addition, the ITCPTC molecule shows a predominant “face-on” orientation in neat films, which is favorable for charge transport in PSCs. As a result, inverted PSCs using the ITCPTC ETL deliver a champion efficiency of 17.42%, while the devices with IDT6CN and IDTCN exhibit a lower efficiency of 15.56% and 13.86%. Moreover, the non-fullerene acceptors also perform well when applied as interfacial materials in PSCs; ITCPTC delivers a remarkable efficiency of 19.51%, with a FF value as high as 82%. This work reveals the great potential of indacenodithiophene-based non-fullerene acceptors as efficient electron transporting materials for PSCs. The investigation towards the structure–electron transporting property relationship could provide insights for future design of efficient ETMs for inverted PSCs.

Solution-processed organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted extensive attention in recent years, because of their outstanding performance and facile preparation. The superior optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, such as strong absorption in a wide range, long charge diffusion lengths and low cost, enabled a dramatic increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from initially reported 3.8% to currently over 22.0%. Undoubtedly, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a rising star in the solar cell community. So far, leading efficiencies in PSCs have been mostly achieved in the conventional n-i-p type device, in which the perovskite layer is sandwiched between a bottom electron transporting layer (ETL, usually TiO2) and a top hole transporting layer (HTL). However, in such conventional devices, the metal oxide layer usually requires high temperature calcination, which hampers the low-cost mass production and flexible applications.

Inverted perovskite solar cells, also known as p-i-n devices, with a bottom hole transporting layer (for example, PEDOT:PSS) and an electron transporting layer on top of the perovskite layer, can avoid the high temperature sintering procedure. Such devices incorporating organic HTLs and ETLs are solution-processable at low temperature. Moreover, p-i-n devices tend to show much less hysteresis effect compared to normal PSCs (n-i-p type). These features make inverted PSCs quite prospective for future application, especially in flexible devices. However, their development is limited by electron transporting materials (ETMs). The most widely used ETMs in highly efficient inverted PSCs are fullerene-based derivatives, including C60 and PCBM. Although fullerene derivatives show high electron mobility and matching energy levels with perovskite, their structures are difficult to modify. Meanwhile, fullerene derivatives suffer from poor ambient stability and easily aggregate upon annealing, which is detrimental to device stability. In this regard, there is an urgent need to explore new cost-effective organic ETMs to replace fullerene-based ones.
A qualified electron transporting material should have matched energy levels with perovskite materials, high electron mobility, and good solubility. ETMs based on n-type organic molecules, particularly those with large planar π-conjugated structures were developed and introduced in inverted PSCs, including hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA) derivatives, hexaazatrinaphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (HATNT), and imide derivatives such as perylenediimide (PDI) and naphthalene imide (NDI). The rigid planar structure of the above-mentioned materials as well as the low-lying LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level was proved to be beneficial for electron transport. As a well-known rigid ladder-type polycyclic aromatic unit, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) and its analogues have been currently studied as small molecule non-fullerene acceptors in organic solar cells. Their energy levels are easily tunable by structural modification, and the rigid multi-fused ring provides a large conjugation plane which is favourable for charge transport. However, there have been few reports on their application in perovskite solar cells to date. Zhan and co-workers reported the IDIC and INIC series used as the interlayer between perovskite and the C60 ETL in inverted PSCs. These interlayers were proved to modify the surface of the perovskite film, promote charge extraction, and also contribute to the ambient stability of the devices. Zhou and Zhan et al. introduced a solution-processed fused-ring electron acceptor based on indacenodithiophene (IDIC) to replace TiO2 in a planar n-i-p type device. IDIC facilitated electron extraction and transport and contributed to a higher power conversion efficiency than the TiO2-based device. Quite recently, our group incorporated the rigid ladder-type backbone ITCPTC-based n-type small molecules as the electron transporting materials in inverted PSCs. ITCPTC-Th with thiophene side groups exhibited high electron mobility, and excellent electron extraction and electron transporting properties, and the corresponding device delivered a high PCE of 17.11%. Overall speaking, ITIC-like ladder-type units are still less investigated in perovskite solar cells, particularly as electron transporting materials to replace fullerene ETMs. Considering the rigid π-conjugation plane, tunable energy levels and easy modification of their structures, the ITIC-like molecules hold great promise to be explored as ETMs for inverted PSCs.
In this work, we develop three ITIC-like small molecules with different conjugation lengths of the rigid fused ring as ETMs for inverted PSCs and systematically investigate the effect of conjugation length on the electron transporting properties of these ITIC-like small molecules. Indacenodithiophene (IDT), 4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b]thiophene-alt-[5,6-d]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDT6), and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) were selected as central multifused rings. The rigid ladder-type structures were end-capped with 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN), and three molecules IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC were obtained, containing five, six and seven fused-rings, respectively (Scheme 1). Obviously, these three compounds are discriminated by the conjugation length of the central ladder-type units. These molecules were introduced as the electron transporting layer in inverted PSCs. It turned out that the increased conjugation length enhances the electron mobility, and also the electron extraction and electron transporting ability. Inverted PSCs using the ITCPTC ETL deliver the highest efficiency of 17.42%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 21.49 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1049 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.77, while the devices with IDT6CN and IDTCN exhibit a lower efficiency of 15.56% and 13.86%, under the same testing conditions. Moreover, ITCPTC also shows excellent performance when applied as the interlayer between perovskite and the C60 ETL, and a remarkable efficiency of 19.51% was achieved. These results demonstrate that the large conjugation plane is favourable for enhancing electron transport. This work reveals the great potential of ITIC-like non-fullerene acceptors as efficient electron transporting materials. More importantly, the investigation towards the relationship between the structure and electron transporting properties could provide insights for future design of new ETMs for inverted PSCs.

The synthetic procedures and characterization of these ladder-type compounds have been reported elsewhere. The device architecture in this work is depicted in Fig. 1a, and the cross-sectional images of the device are shown in Fig. S1. The perovskite photoactive layer was sandwiched between a water-soluble conjugated polymeric HTL and an organic ETL. As shown in Fig. 1b, the LUMO levels for IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC calculated from the cyclic voltammetry curves were −3.92 eV, −3.97 eV and −3.96 eV, matching well with the conduction band of perovskite and thus ensuring sufficient driving force for electron transport. The electron mobilities of the neat films of IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method were 4.68 × 10−4, 7.70 × 10−4 and 7.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These three compounds exhibit compatible energy levels and high electron mobilities, and thus they have potential for use in perovskite solar cells.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to study the surface morphology of IDTCN, IDT6CN and ITCPTC on top of perovskite films. It is observed that films of these three compounds can fully cover the perovskite film. From Fig. 1c, perovskite films covered with IDT6CN and ITCPTC show smoother surfaces (the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 13.1 nm for IDT6CN and 18.2 nm for ITCPTC) than that covered with IDTCN (20.4 nm). These results suggest that IDT6CN and ITCPTC may provide more effective contact between the electrode and the perovskite layer and thus enhance selective electron extraction at the IDT6CN or ITCPTC/perovskite interface. Based on our previous work, the results of 2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAX) measurements of the three compounds are quite different from each other. The ITCPTC neat film tends to exhibit a face-on orientation. IDT6CN showed a strong (100) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction and also a typical edge-on orientation with a π–π stacking peak in the in-plane direction, while the IDTCN film showed an edge-on orientation and (100) peak dominated by a series of diffraction peaks. We know that the face-on orientation on the substrate is preferable, which is advantageous for the vertical direction charge transfer in PSCs. In this respect, molecular orientation of the ITCPTC film is the most favourable among the three compounds studied, whereas that of IDTCN indicated its polymorphic nature and is detrimental to charge transfer in PSCs.
Inverted PSCs with the structure of ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/ETLs/rhodamine 101/LiF/Ag were fabricated (Fig. 1a), and the effect of different ETLs were discussed. Each ETL with different thicknesses was also systematically studied, and the results are shown in Fig. S2 and Tables S1–S3. According to the literature and our previous work, too thin an ETL usually leads to leakage current and concurrently a rather poor photovoltaic performance, so ETLs with thicknesses more than 20 nm were prepared. Generally, for the three ETLs, PCEs of their corresponding devices increase with the increasing ETL thickness. But too thick an ETL may increase the series resistance, thus causing declined efficiency. As a result, the optimized thicknesses are about 27 nm for IDTCN, 36 nm for IDT6CN and 38 nm for ITCPTC, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under optimal conditions for PSCs based on these three ETMs are presented in Fig. 2a, and the data are summarized in Table 1. The optimized PCE of PSCs using the ITCPTC ETL is 17.42%, with a Voc of 1049 mV, a Jsc of 21.49 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.77. The IDT6CN-based device shows a lower power conversion efficiency of 15.56% under optimal conditions, with a Voc of 1018 mV, a Jsc of 20.80 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.73. However, the optimized performance of the IDTCN-based device is relatively poor, with an inferior PCE of 13.86%, a low Voc of 964 mV, a Jsc of 20.13 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.71. Clearly, ITCPTC outperforms the other two compounds when used as ETMs in inverted PSCs, which may be related to its higher electron mobility and the dominant “face-on” molecular orientation in neat films. Structurally speaking, with the same acceptor unit (CPTCN), the three ITIC-like compounds are distinguished by the conjugation length of the central multi-fused rings. Obviously, the conjugated plane of ITCPTC is the largest while that of IDTCN is the smallest, and therefore, we can conclude that the increased π-conjugation should account for the better electron transport properties in this series of molecules. A control device with a PCBM ETL was also studied, and the highest efficiency of 15.27% was obtained.

20 devices were fabricated and measured in one batch, as observed from the statistics of photovoltaic parameters in Fig. S3. These data suggest good reproducibility of the devices studied. The average PCEs for IDTCN-, IDT6CN- and ITCPTC-based devices are 13.13%, 15.13% and 17.10%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with different ETLs (under the optimal conditions) show responses exceeding 80% from 400 to 800 nm. The integrated Jsc is about 18.78 mA cm−2 for IDTCN, 19.77 mA cm−2 for IDT6CN, and 20.30 mA cm−2 for ITCPTC as determined from the EQE spectra, which are in good agreement with the Jsc values measured from J–V curves. Fig. 2c shows the J–V curves of the ITCPTC-based device scanned in forward and reverse directions. It is observed that the curves scanned in different directions overlap very well, the forward scanning offers a PCE of 17.10% and the reverse scanning provides a PCE of 17.42%. J–V curves scanned at different delay times are shown in Fig. S11, and little distinctions were observed, further confirming negligible hysteresis in inverted PSCs using the ITCPTC ETL. In the meantime, little hysteresis is also observed in IDT6CN- and IDTCN-based devices (Fig. S4). The steady Jsc and PCE measured at the maximum power output point of the optimized devices with the ITCPTC ETL are shown in Fig. 2d. At a bias voltage of 0.87 V, the device shows a stabilized photocurrent density of 19.74 mA cm−2 and a stable power output of 17.18%. Similarly, for the devices with IDTCN and IDT6CN ETLs, a stabilized Jsc of 17.21/18.02 mA cm−2 and PCE of 13.43/15.32% are observed at certain bias voltages (Fig. S5). These results suggest the good stability of these devices.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured to evaluate the electron extraction properties of these newly developed ETLs. The measurements were conducted on a perovskite film and perovskite films covered with different ETLs (Fig. 3). The perovskite film exhibits an intense emission band at about 780 nm. After spin-coating ETLs on perovskite films, significant fluorescence quenching is observed. Apparently, the quenching efficiency of ITCPTC is higher than that of the other two analogues. In addition, from the TRPL spectra, the PL lifetime of the perovskite/ITCPTC film decays faster than that of the other films. The fitted PL lifetime for the perovskite film is 246.3 ns. The coverage of ETLs prominently accelerates PL decays to 25.1 ns for perovskite/IDTCN, 15.3 ns for perovskite/PCBM, 10.2 ns for perovskite/IDT6CN and 5.3 ns for perovskite/ITCPTC, respectively. These results suggest the excellent electron extraction properties of ITCPTC, which could more efficiently extract electrons from the perovskite material. Combined with its high electron mobility, the ITCPTC ETL exhibits the highest performance among the ETMs studied.
The interfacial charge transfer properties can be reflected from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS of the PSCs using different ETLs was performed at an applied voltage close to Voc (0.9 V) under the dark conditions (Fig. S6). The equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. S6, which is composed of the series resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the interfaces. For devices using different ETLs, there is not much difference in the series resistance Rs due to the identical fabrication process. The difference in interfacial charge transfer should be from the RCT. From Fig. S6, among the ETMs studied, the RCT of PSCs using ITCPTC is the smallest, while that of the IDTCN-based device is the largest, indicating that the charge transfer at the perovskite/ITCPTC interface is the most effective. These results further confirm that the increased conjugation in ITCPTC promotes charge transport in PSCs, and moreover, the enhanced charge transfer may also contribute to the elevated FF value of ITCPTC-based devices.
Ambient stability is an important issue when evaluating the performance of PSCs. The stability of the inverted PSCs with the ITCPTC ETL (champion ETL in this work) is measured in ambient air with a controlled humidity of 25–30%. The control device using the PC61BM ETL is also tested for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4, the device based on ITCPTC shows a 25% decrease in 10 days, while the control device using the PC61BM ETL exhibits a 38% decrease under the same testing conditions. These differences in stability should come from the different ETLs. To further elucidate this point, water contact angles of the ITCPTC/PC61BM film on the perovskite layer were measured (inset of Fig. 5). Compared with PC61BM, the more hydrophobic nature of ITCPTC has a larger contact angle, which accounts for the higher ambient stability of the corresponding PSCs. Among the three ETMs, ITCPTC has the largest π-conjugation plane, together with the hydrophobic alkyl chains, resulting in its better hydrophobic nature, which can enhance the water resistance of the underlying perovskite layer, and is beneficial for the ambient stability of inverted PSCs. In addition, we also conducted thermal stability tests of the inverted PSCs using ITCPTC or PCBM (Fig. S10). We can see that the devices based on the ITCPTC or PC61BM ETL show good thermal stability below 100 °C. However, the PCBM-based device shows a more severe decrease in PCE compared to the ITCPTC-based device measured at 130 °C. We also note that when heated at 150 °C, the devices using different ETLs all exhibit a significant decrease, which should come from the perovskite degradation.
To further address the superior electron transport properties of indacenodithiophene-based molecules, inverted PSCs using them as the interlayers were also studied. The device architecture is ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/interlayer/C60/BCP/Ag, as presented in Fig. 5a. The C60 electron transporting layer together with the BCP buffer layer was incorporated, and the thin interlayer was deposited between the perovskite active layer and the C60 ETL. According to the literature, the carbonyl and cyano groups in the ITIC-like molecules play the role of a Lewis base, which can passivate the trap states in the perovskite film by the Lewis acid–base reaction with the under-coordinated Pb atoms. In addition, the interlayer can assist electron transfer due to the n-type nature of the materials, and this hydrophobic interlayer may also improve the ambient stability of PSCs. The optimized J–V curves of the inverted PSCs in the absence and presence of the interlayers are presented in Fig. 5b, and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. ITCPTC as the interfacial material offers the highest PCE (19.51%) among the three n-type molecules, with a Voc of 1076 mV, a Jsc of 22.14 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 0.82. It is noteworthy that this FF value (0.82) represents one of the highest values reported for PSCs. IDT6CN also shows a decent performance as the interlayer, resulting in a PCE of 18.89%, while IDTCN exhibits a relatively lower PCE of 17.54%, which is only a little higher than the PCE of the control device (16.93%) not containing the interlayers. These results reveal that introduction of the interlayers help promote electron transport and also facilitate trap passivation, thus enhancing the Jsc, Voc and FF values. The ITCPTC interlayer with the largest conjugation length contributes to the highest efficiency compared to the other two analogues, agreeing well with the performances of PSCs using them as the ETLs. Fig. 5c shows the EQE spectra of PSCs incorporating the interlayers. In all cases, strong spectral responses ranging from 400 to 800 nm are observed. The integrated current density derived from the EQE spectra is 20.97 mA cm−2 for the ITCPTC interlayer, 20.62 mA cm−2 for the IDT6CN interlayer, and 20.19 mA cm−2 for the IDTCN interlayer. These inverted devices also show quite good reproducibility, as observed from Table 2 and Fig. S7. Moreover, J–V curves scanned in forward and reverse directions are also recorded, and little hysteresis is observed in these devices (Fig. S8 and Table S4). The steady Jsc and PCE measured at the maximum power output point of the optimized devices with the ITCPTC interlayer were recorded (Fig. S9). It turned out that the inverted PSC shows a stabilized photocurrent density of 20.54 mA cm−2 and a stable power output of 19.10%.

In conclusion, three ladder-type compounds based on indacenodithiophene were developed as efficient electron transporting materials for inverted PSCs. The three compounds all have compatible energy levels with perovskite. ITCPTC with the largest conjugation length shows the highest electron mobility, and the most efficient electron extraction and electron transporting ability. Inverted PSCs using the ITCPTC ETL shows a leading efficiency of 17.42%, significantly higher than 15.56% for IDT6CN and 13.86% for IDTCN under the same testing conditions. Moreover, ITCPTC also shows an excellent performance when applied as the interlayer between perovskite and the C60 ETL, and a superior efficiency of 19.51% was achieved, with a remarkable FF value of 0.82. The results in this work reveal the great potential of the ITIC-like non-fullerene acceptors as efficient electron transporting materials for PSCs, and the large conjugation plane is demonstrated to be favourable for enhancing electron transport.
