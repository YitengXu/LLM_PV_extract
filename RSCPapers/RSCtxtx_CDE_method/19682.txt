Towards increasing the stability of perovskite solar cells, the addition of Cs+ is found to be a rational approach. Recently triple cation based perovskite solar cells were found to be more effective in terms of stability and efficiency. Heretofore they were unexplored, so we probed the Cs/MA/FA (cesium/methyl ammonium/formamidinium) cation based perovskites by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and correlated their compositional features with their solar cell performances. The Cs+ content was found to be optimum at 5%, when incorporated in the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 lattice, because the corresponding device yielded the highest fill factor compared to the perovskite without Cs+ and with 10% Cs+. XPS studies distinctly reveal how Cs+ aids in maintaining the expected stoichiometric ratios of I:Pb2+, I:N and Br:Pb2+ in the perovskites, and how the valence band (VB) edge is dependent on the Cs+ proportion, which in turn governs the open circuit voltage. Even at a low content of 5%, Cs+ resides deep within the absorber layer, and ensures minimum distortion of the VB level (compared to 0% and 10% Cs+ perovskites) upon Ar+ sputtering, thus allowing the formation of a stable robust material that delivers excellent solar cell response. This study which brings out the role of Cs+ is anticipated to be of paramount significance to further engineer the composition and improve device performances.

The unprecedented progress in the field of thin film photovoltaics (PV) with the arrival of perovskite has stunned the photovoltaic community. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is now at par with the mature thin film PV technology and is now seen as the next big thing in PV. This surge in device performance was possible due to compositional and process engineering. Until recently, the classical perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 remained the most investigated perovskite for solar cell applications, however its thermal instability, halide segregation and higher moisture sensitivity have been a subject of intense discussion. Perovskites with a methyl ammonium (MA) lead cation (CH3NH3Pb) and a mixed halide (BrxI3−x or ClxI3−x or BrxCl3−x) or iodide (I3) anion have been exhaustively investigated in terms of their structure and composition to understand the extraordinarily high PCEs. However, the leaching of lead at low temperatures and the air- and moisture-stability of these solar cells still pose daunting challenges that must be addressed especially in view of scale-up and deployment of these cells for practical roof-top or similar applications in future. To counter the toxicity issue, a lead-free perovskite (CH3NH3SnI3) with a band gap of 1.23 eV was reported, and the resulting cell delivered a mere PCE of 6.4%. But the instability of Sn in the +2 oxidation state outside a glove box or under non-inert conditions (as Sn2+ readily oxidizes to Sn4+ which causes the breakdown of the perovskite structure!), apart from being more hygroscopic and environmentally unfriendly, again raised concerns about the practicality of using Sn as a viable substituent for Pb. Pb has special affinity for PV and is a highly polarizable element. Furthermore, it was observed that thin films of MAPbI3 due to the volatile organic cation tend to undergo thermal decomposition to PbI2 above 85 °C, thus preventing their high temperature operation.

The formamidinium (FA) based cation (HC(NH2)2+) showed superior thermal stability and charge transport properties compared to the methyl ammonium ion. It has been demonstrated that mixtures of organic and inorganic cations – FA and cesium (Cs+) ions – are structurally and thermally stable at temperatures above 100 °C. The absolute replacement of organic cations with lead free inorganic ones is very much desirable, as it allows the possibility of developing environmentally benign cells with the ability to operate at high temperatures, but it is only attainable at the expense of cell performance. In the past, cells with a Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite yielded a PCE of 1.09%, and the authors also found that the MA3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9Clx analogues delivered much lower efficiencies of 0.12 and 0.003%, clearly highlighting the advantage of Cs+ ions in improving the PCE due to enhanced light absorption and emission characteristics, a unique morphology of hexagonal sheets, and a different valence band position, compared to the other two perovskites. This PCE is low compared to MAPbX3 (X: mixed halide or halide) based cells.
Despite the superior thermal stability of FAPbI3 relative to MAPbI3, pristine FAPbI3 is structurally unstable at ambient temperature. It crystallizes to photo-unresponsive d-phases or to moisture sensitive photo-active phases, thus limiting its practical usage. Similarly, while CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 are thermally stable, the latter has an unfavorable band gap for PV applications, and the former forms a photo-inactive phase at room temperature and a photo-active phase at very high temperatures, again restricting their applicability. Recent reports show that pristine perovskites due to thermal, structural or electronic (unfavorable band gap) reasons, tend to be poor photovoltaic performers. Therefore mixtures of cations and/or halide ions are preferred to overcome these limitations, so that optimal solar cell performances are achieved. In a previous study of note, a dual source evaporated CsPbIBr2 (with a mixed halide) and hole transport free planar perovskite cell was found to be free of halide segregation, and gave an efficiency of 4.7% in the reverse scan. In another study, inverted CsxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite (with 10% Cs doping concentration)/PCBM heterojunction devices showed an outstanding increment in PCE from 5.51 to 7.68% due to increased light absorption, improved film morphology and a broadened energy difference between the levels of active components.
Cells with a FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 perovskite showed a PCE increase from 14.9% to 16.5% by partial substitution of the FA cation with the Cs cation due to suppressed charge recombination. The photo- and moisture-stabilities of FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 were considerably improved in comparison to control FAPbI3, owing to stronger FA–I interactions. Cells with a crystalline and photo-stable perovskite ([HC(NH2)2]0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3) with a band gap of ∼1.74 eV reached open-circuit voltages (VOC) of 1.2 V and PCE >17% on small areas and 14.7% on 0.715 cm2 cells. A perovskite with a mixture of a triple cation (Cs/MA/FA), namely, Cs5(MA0.17FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (having 5% of Cs+) was successfully implemented to achieve a stabilized PCE of 21.1%. This remarkable performance was an outcome of the design principles employed therein: (i) even a small amount of Cs was effective in preserving FA in its photoactive black perovskite phase due to the large size difference between Cs and FA ions and (ii) the presence of MA ions reduced the crystallization rate of the FA perovskite, thus resulting in improved defect-free perovskite films.
It is evident that the use of a triple cation coupled with a mixed halide anion is a competitive approach towards developing stable yet efficient perovskite solar cells. Since these perovskites with three cations and two halide ions have been developed recently, not much is known about the compositional aspects of these perovskites, and how the composition affects the solar cell behavior. Recently, for pure MAPbI3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies have been performed. To bridge this lacuna, herein, we present a study on (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskites without Cs+ and with 5 and 10% Cs+ incorporation in the lattice, to yield Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskites. The PV performance parameters of the three perovskites are correlated to the compositional features or differences, on going from the control (without Cs+) perovskite to the perovskites with Cs+ for the first time. This is accomplished by elaborate X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations, where the core level and the valence band spectral information is analyzed and associated with solar cell responses. Furthermore, depth profiling is also attempted on the three perovskites, to understand how the surface composition varies from the innards of these materials. We believe that this fundamental study will be of immense significance for further optimization in developing high performance devices.


Scheme 1 depicts the architecture of the device adopted for the fabrication of solar cells. The device PV parameters represented as the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves using the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite with and without Cs+ addition are shown in Fig. 1a, for the hero cells. The addition of 10% Cs+ significantly improves the open circuit voltage but at the expense of short circuit current density, due to the downshift of the valence band to more negative energies (versus a vacuum), which is verified by the valence band diagram. The perovskite obtained upon addition of 5% Cs+ to (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 shows the best cell performance compared to the pristine perovskite (without Cs+) and the one with 10% Cs+ (Table 1). The fill factor (FF) and the short circuit current density (JSC) are the highest for the cell based on the perovskite with 5% Cs+. Previously, for triple cation based perovskites, enhanced FF was observed upon Cs+ inclusion in the perovskite lattice, and this was attributed to the formation of more uniform perovskite grains, induced by Cs+ seeds. The statistical data and deviation for the perovskite cells without and with 5 and 10% Cs+ are presented in Table S1 (ESI) and are also shown graphically as Fig. 1b. It is apparent from the statistical data on the cells that the differences between the PCEs of the champion cells and the average values of PCEs (Table S1, ESI) are not very high. The variation of PCEs over the number of cells is also the least for the cell with the perovskite containing 5% Cs+ (16.03 ± 1.09), followed by the cells with 0% Cs+ (PCE: 14.43 ± 1.26) and 10% Cs+ (PCE: 14.09 ± 1.41). Therefore, it is expected that these cells across batches will yield similar values of PCEs, compared to the remaining two cells (with 10% Cs+ and without Cs+). This also serves as an indicator for improved stability of the cells with 5% Cs+. In an earlier report on Cs doped MAPbI3 perovskites, it was found that the surface of MAPbI3 doped with 10% Cs was smoother than that of pristine MAPbI3. This resulted in a better and more intimate interfacial contact between the Cs doped perovskite and the PCBM overlayer, and also improved the quality of the PCBM/Al contact. Due to these reasons, the FF was improved for Cs doped perovskite compared to the pristine perovskite. Accordingly, in the present study, Cs doping imparts a smoother morphology to the perovskite, and improved the interfacial contact at the Cs-doped perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, which allows us to achieve an increment in the fill factor. However at relatively higher Cs+ levels, the wider band gap of CsPbI3 (2.05 eV) and the presence of undesirable phases such as CsI, PbI2, and Cs4PbI6 were touted to be the reasons for the performance decline. Similar to this, an improved FF was obtained at optimal doping (5% Cs+), and thereafter it declines.

The cell fabricated with the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite shows a PCE of 15.24%, while its analogue device fabricated with the perovskite containing 5% Cs+ gave an improved PCE of 17.1%, and in the same batch, the best device fabricated from 10% Cs+ perovskite showed a value of 15.71% (Table 1).

Fig. 2 illustrates the variation of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) versus wavelength responses of the fabricated devices using the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite and with Cs+ (5 and 10%) addition. The light harvesting abilities of these systems approach 90% in the bulk of the visible spectrum except in the case of the cell with the pristine perovskite, which shows lower IPCE values. It is to be noted that the addition of Cs+ improves the light harvesting abilities of these systems, while also significantly increasing the stability to a large extent. The derived integrated current value is plotted on the secondary y-axis and is in accordance with the J–V measurements.
An almost flat photon-to-electron conversion profile was observed between 400 and 700 nm with Cs+ addition. These results are in accordance with the absorption measurements of the samples where the perovskite with 10% Cs+ shows lower light absorption compared to pristine (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and the one with 5% Cs+ (Fig. S1, ESI). The direct band gaps were determined from Tauc plots, by plotting (αhν)2versus hν for all three perovskites, where “α” is the absorption coefficient of the perovskite and “hν” is the photon energy. The plots are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). The band gaps (Eg) were estimated by drawing tangents from the straight line portions of the (αhν)2versus hν plots to the corresponding abscissas. The band gaps for the perovskites without Cs+ and with 5 and 10% Cs+ are 1.62, 1.612 and 1.611 eV respectively.

The deconvoluted Pb4f core level spectra of (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 before and after Ar+ sputtering, respectively, are shown in Fig. 3a and b and those of Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI). MA and FA are CH3NH3 and HC(NH2)2 respectively. The Pb4f spectra before sputtering for all three perovskites show two peaks at 138.5 and 143.3 eV corresponding to the spin–orbit split components of Pb4+4f7/2 and Pb2+4f5/2. The intensity ratio is approximately 1.2 for Pb2+4f7/2:Pb2+4f5/2, and it remains unchanged upon sputtering and is also not affected significantly by inclusion of Cs+ ions in the composition. Table S2 (ESI) provides the assignments corresponding to the deconvoluted core level and valence band spectra of perovskite electrodes. For all three perovskites, a noticeable change in the Pb4f profile was observed after Ar+ sputtering. The Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2 signals are observed to be unsymmetrical, and each peak was characterized by a distinct shoulder in the low energy side. The deconvolution of the spectra of all the sputtered perovskites yielded four peaks. Besides the Pb2+ signals, two peaks are observed at ∼136.7 and 141.5 eV, and these are attributed to Pb04f7/2 and Pb04f5/2 components. Ar+ sputtering reduces lead, as the same effect is observed in Cs+ containing perovskites as well. MAPbBr3 and FAPbI3 possibly decompose to yield MAI and PbBr2 and FAI and PbI2. PbI2 and PbBr2 then undergo further reduction to liberate metallic Pb, and I2 and Br2.

Previously, for a Pb2+ salt, peaks were observed at 138.3 and 143.2 eV corresponding to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 components. In the same report, for metallic lead, signals were observed at 136.6 and 141.5 eV due to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 components. The peak separation in both cases was found to be 4.9 eV. These values are close to the values observed by us for Pb2+ and Pb0. In another report, for the clean lead metal, the Pb4f7/2 peak was observed at 137.0 ± 0.1 eV, which too matches with the peak observed here and assigned to Pb0. The proportions of Pb0 to Pb2+ content in the three sputtered perovskites: (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 are 0.27, 0.23 and 0.26, respectively, thus indicating that compositionally, 73, 77 and 74% of the three perovskites retain their structural integrity, upon sputtering. This indicates that the perovskite with 5% Cs+ is the most resistant to compositional decomposition.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskites before and after exposure to UV-irradiation for 60 min are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). Before UV exposure, the patterns of the as-prepared perovskites match very well with the patterns previously observed for (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 containing Cs+. An additional low intensity peak is however observed for the as-prepared (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, at 2θ = 12.7°, which matches with the cubic phase of PbI2. After UV exposure, the intensity of this peak was found to increase in comparison to the intensity of the (110) peak at 2θ = 14°, indicating the degradation of the perovskite. The PbI2 peak was not observed in the diffractograms of the perovskites containing Cs+, both before and after exposure, thus illustrating that Cs+ incorporation stabilizes the perovskite lattice.
From the XPS data analysis, we found that at 5% Cs+ incorporation, the structure is the most stable, and it is this perovskite which also delivers the highest PCE (compared to perovskites with 0 and 10% Cs+). The Cs+ ion has a smaller ionic radius compared to the radii of FA and MA cations and therefore in the triple cation of Cs/FA/MA, at a higher loading of Cs+, as in the 10% Cs+ based perovskite, the ionic radius mismatch is more dominant compared to what it is at 5%. So, when subjected to sputtering in XPS, the lattice (with 10% Cs+) is more susceptible to degradation compared to the one with 5% Cs+. XRD data also support the stability imparted to the perovskite upon Cs+ incorporation.
In an earlier report on Cs+ containing perovskites ((MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3), two peaks were observed at 11.6° and 12.7° in the XRD pattern of the perovskite devoid of Cs+, corresponding to the photo-inactive hexagonal δ-phase of FAPbI3 and the cubic PbI2, respectively. The authors propounded that this was characteristic of the mixed perovskite and serves as evidence for the partial conversion of the FA perovskite into the photoactive black phase. Since we did not observe the peak at 2θ = 11.6° in the XRD patterns of all three as-prepared perovskites, it is evident that the inactive FAPbI3 is not present in the perovskites. However, a very low intensity peak is registered at 11.6°, after UV exposure, only in the XRD pattern of (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, without Cs+, indicating that Cs+ addition also prevents the conversion to FAPbI3.
The slight decrease in the band gap upon Cs+ incorporation (0% > 5% ≈ 10%) is possibly due to the differences in the perovskite crystal sizes. The XRD peaks of the 0% Cs+ based perovskite are broader in comparison to the 5 and 10% Cs+ based perovskites (Fig. S4, ESI). The latter two have almost similar full widths at half maximum for the dominant peaks. This implies that the 0% Cs+ based perovskite is characterized by a smaller crystal size (at a given orientation) compared to the 5 and 10% Cs+ based perovskites. Hence a higher band gap is obtained for the 0% Cs+ based perovskite. Ideally, with an increase in the proportion of Cs+ (which is smaller in size compared to the MA and FA cations), the lattice is expected to expand, and the band gap is expected to decrease and should result in a red-shift of the absorption onset. However, in our case, we assume that particle size effects (crystal formation recipe) will also influence the band gap to a certain extent. Since this effect is not a dominant one, the change in the band gap upon Cs+ inclusion is small and not large. At levels greater than 10% Cs+, perhaps the band gap may increase, as pristine CsPbI3 has a wider band gap (Eg = 2.05 eV).
The N1s and Pb4d5/2 signature peaks are observed in the 400–420 eV binding energy regime. All three perovskites show similar profiles corresponding to before and after Ar+ sputtering treatments (Fig. 3c and d and Fig. S5, ESI). For all three samples, the peak height of the Pb4d5/2 component (at ∼414 eV) almost doubles upon sputtering, whereas the intensity of the N1s component (observed at ∼401 eV) decreases significantly upon sputtering. The survey spectra of (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). All six spectra show distinctive signals corresponding to I4d, Pb4f, N1s, Pb4d, I3d, Pb4p and Pb4s. A weak signal corresponding to C1s is observed only in the non-sputtered samples and weak signals due to Cs3d in the 720–735 eV range are observed for the perovskites containing 5 and 10% Cs+.
The I3d5/2 and I3d3/2 components are observed at 619 and 631 eV, respectively, for all three sputtered and non-sputtered perovskites (Fig. 3e and f and Fig. S7, ESI). However, while the peak height of the I3d peaks (arising from the PbI6 octahedra) decreases on going from the non-sputtered (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 to the sputtered perovskite, the peak heights increase with increasing Cs+ content in the sputtered perovskites containing Cs+ cations. This peak height increase for I3d signals in the perovskite with 10% Cs+ or Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 indicates that Cs+ predominates across the depth of the perovskite, compared to the surface. This is feasible, since Cs+ is introduced into the perovskite precursor, in the form of CsI. However it must be noted that the relative peak areas for the I3d5/2 and I3d3/2 components are nearly the same in all the I3d spectra. While all three perovskites showed the presence of Pb0 (as per the Pb4f spectra), surprisingly, the I3d spectra do not reveal any change upon sputtering except for the variations in peak heights. One reason why a distinct signal due to I2 was not observed in the sputtered samples could be because of the fact that the 3d signals of I2 (where the bonding is covalent) and I− (where the bonding is ionic) are not very well separated in terms of their binding energies. The 3d5/2 signal is expected around 619.9 eV in molecular I2, which is close to the 3d5/2 signal of I− (which we observed at 619.5 eV).
The deconvoluted C1s core level spectra are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI). All the spectra comprise two broad peaks, the lower energy (higher intensity) one at 284.6 eV arises from the C–C groups, and the higher energy (lower intensity) component which is obtained in the ∼287–288 eV range is assigned to the C–N bonds. The signal strengths for both these peaks decrease on going from the non-sputtered to sputtered perovskites, which is also accompanied by a slight broadening of the peaks. This intensity difference could be because of the contribution from adsorbed carbon on the surface of the perovskites. However, the Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite shows equal intensity C–C and C–N components before sputtering, which changes to a 2:1 intensity ratio, after sputtering.
The Br3d signal is observed as a broad peak centered at 68.4–68.7 eV in all three perovskites (sputtered and non-sputtered) (Fig. 4). The signal appears to be substantially weaker in the sputtered perovskites, compared to the respective sputtered samples. Furthermore, these signals are also observed to be weaker across the depths of the (sputtered) perovskites containing Cs+, relative to the one which does not contain Cs+.
This again indicates that iodide is dominant in the perovskites with Cs+. Furthermore, from the compositional perspective of the three perovskites, the Br− content in the perovskites is also lower compared to I−, while Br− is 15% and I− is 85%.
The Cs3d spectral profiles obtained for the two perovskites with Cs+ – Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 – show a noticeable variation (Fig. 5). The Cs3d5/2 and Cs3d3/2 peaks are observed at ∼725 and 739 eV, respectively, in both sputtered and non-sputtered perovskites containing 5 and 10% Cs+. However, the intensity ratio is 1.7 for the non-sputtered perovskite with 5% Cs+, and it drops to 1.2, upon sputtering. For the perovskite with 10% Cs+, this ratio is ∼3 and 1.1 before and after sputtering. While the I3d signal becomes stronger, the Cs3d signal becomes weaker, upon sputtering. An additional peak is observed at ∼717 eV in all the Cs3d spectra. The intensity of this peak drops by nearly half after sputtering in the perovskite with 5% Cs+, and drops nominally post-sputtering in the perovskite with 10% Cs+. This peak is attributed to the altered chemical environment of Cs+, as each Cs+ ion besides being ionically bound to I− and Br− ions is also surrounded by the MA+ and FA+ ions, because it is an integral part of the triple cation mixture. The strong electrostatic interactions between the Cs+ and halide ions also contribute towards stabilizing the perovskite lattice. The higher the proportion of Cs+, the lesser would be the impact on this signal across the depth of the sample, which is the reason for the signal remaining unaffected upon sputtering for the 10% Cs+ based perovskite.
From the intensity (integrated area) ratios of total iodide content (100% for the perovskite without Cs+, and 95 and 90%, respectively, for the perovskites containing 5 and 10% Cs+) to the C–N proportion in the (FAPbI3)0.85 entity obtained as 85% of the integrated area of the C–N component in the deconvoluted C1s spectrum, the II(total)(I3d)/I(C–N)(C1s) values are found to be 3.79, 3.17 and 2.15 in the non-sputtered (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskites. This ratio represents the I:N stoichiometry in (FAPbI3)0.85, which is theoretically expected to be 3:1. Except for the perovskite with 10% Cs+, the remaining samples show values around the expected value. Similarly, the I:Pb ratio is also expected to be 3:1 in (FAPbI3)0.85. This ratio is determined by using the II(total) (100, 95 and 90% for the perovskites without and with 5 and 10% Cs+ respectively) for IPb4f7/2(Pb4f)2+ (85% of the integrated area under the Pb2+4f7/2 peak).
In the past, Philippe et al. also used the Pb4f7/2 component to study the compositions of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx perovskites. The II(total)/IPb4f7/22+ ratios are 2.12, 2.02 and 1.92 for the non-sputtered perovskites: (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3. For the sputtered samples, these ratios are 3.27, 2.67 and 2.66 respectively. The ratios are closer to the stoichiometric values across the depth, due to non-interference from (top) surface contaminants. Previously, the I:Pb ratio was found to be 3.3 for MAPbI3, and the Cl:Pb ratio was determined to be 2.4 in MAPbCl3. Even in structurally less complex perovskites such as the ones reported by Phillippe and co-workers, the values show appreciable digression from the expected values. From the survey spectra, the proportions of Cs, from the ICs3d contributions were found to be 5.5 and 9.3%, respectively, for the non-sputtered perovskites: (MAPbBr3)0.15(FAPbI3)0.85 containing 5% and 10% Cs+, which align reasonably well with the experimentally incorporated amounts of 5 and 10% CsI. The ratio of Br:Pb is anticipated to be 3:1 in (MAPbBr3)0.15, in all three perovskites. This ratio is determined from the survey spectra, from IBr3d/IPb4f, where IPb4f is taken as 15% of the net integrated area under the Pb4f peaks. It is found to be 2.67, 3.06 and 3.2 for non-sputtered-(MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (without Cs+), and the 5% and 10% Cs+ samples, respectively, which are close to the expected value of 3. The Br3d signal, however, is hardly discernible in the survey spectra of the sputtered perovskites.
The C:N ratio of (MAPbBr3)0.15 in all three perovskites is expected to be 1:1. The ratios of IC–C (15% of the C–C integrated area in the C1s profile) to IPb4f7/22+ (15% of the integrated area under the Pb2+4f7/2 peak) are calculated to be 1.24, 1.24 and 0.9 for the non-sputtered perovskites: (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3. Cs+ aids in maintaining the expected stoichiometric composition of the perovskite.
The core level Pb5d spectra are shown in Fig. 6. Two peaks corresponding to Pb2+5d5/2 and Pb2+5d3/2 are observed at 19.5 and 22–22.3 eV; the positions of these peaks and the intensity ratio do not vary either with sputtering or with Cs+ inclusion in the lattice. However, in all three sputtered perovskites, a shoulder is observed at 17.8 eV, corresponding to a Pb05d signal. This is also supported by the presence of the Pb04f signals which manifested in the form of shoulders in the Pb4f spectra. The broad peak spanning 0.8–7 eV, and centered at ∼3.1–3.2 eV in the non-sputtered perovskites, is due to the densities of states (DOSs) of iodide and bromide. The DOS of lead produces a peak at 9.75 eV. The peak due to the DOSs of I− and Br− downshifts to 2.9–3.0 eV in the sputtered perovskites and the peak due to the DOS of lead remains unaltered. Similar structures were observed in the valence band (VB) spectra of conventional MAPbI3 perovskite and of (ethyl ammonium)x(MA)1−xPbBr3 perovskite. No shoulder is observed at ∼2.3 eV, which corresponds to PbI2, thus indicating that the sputtered perovskites contain metallic lead and no PbI2. The magnified views of the VB spectra, where the DOS approaches zero, are shown in Fig. 7. The VB positions are 5.45, 5.4 and 5.5 eV, with respect to 0 eV (or at vacuum level as a reference), for the non-sputtered (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 and Cs0.1(MA0.15FA0.85)0.9Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskites. These values were extracted from Fig. 7, and these are the points on the abscissas, where the solid perpendicular lines intersect the abscissas (Fig. 7a, c, and e). In the energy band diagram in Fig. 8, the valence band maxima are represented as solid lines and the conduction band (CB) minima are obtained and shown as well. The CB minima are calculated by adding the optical band gaps obtained from Tauc plots, by using the equation: (−)ECB = (−)EVB + Eg. A similar exercise was done for the sputtered samples as well and the VB edges are found to be 5.08, 5.45 and 5.3 eV for the sputtered samples respectively. They were determined from Fig. 7b, d and f.
The open circuit voltage is the highest for the perovskite with 10% Cs+, both the average value and also the value of the champion cell. The VB is downshifted to the maximum extent for this perovskite, compared to the remaining two perovskites. A deeper VB level appears to provide more driving force for hole injection to the hole transport material (HTM) and this in turn leads to the highest VOC (at 10% Cs+). For a perovskite solar cell with the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cs doped MAPbI3/PCBM/Al, the authors explained on the basis of observed differences in VOC values that upon Cs-doping, the quasi-Fermi energy at the perovskite/anode interface changes by 0.1 eV compared to MAPbI3, which increased the energy difference between the valence band maximum of the perovskite (electron donor) and the conduction band minimum of PCBM (electron acceptor). In their study, the authors obtained the highest VOC of 1.05 V for a 10% Cs doped perovskite cell, compared to a VOC of 0.89 V for the MAPbI3 cell. In a similar manner, in the present case as well, a reasonably high Cs+ doping level (as in the perovskite doped with 10% Cs+) induces a change in the interfacial electronic properties at the TiO2/perovskite interface compared to the perovskite without Cs+, and as a consequence, the VB maximum shifts downwards towards more negative values (with respect to a vacuum level), and this is also supported by the highest VOC obtained for this particular cell. These values indicate that the electronic or valence band structure is least perturbed for the perovskite with 5% Cs+, and most disturbed for the perovskite without Cs+, followed by the one with 10% Cs+, indicating that 5% Cs+ addition imparts robustness to the perovskite, thus making it relatively more impervious to compositional change. A comparison of the energetics of the three photo-absorber layers is presented in Fig. 8. The energy band diagram clearly shows that the extent to which the VB is altered follows the order: 0% > 10% > 5%. Incorporation of Cs+ in a MA/FA cation based perovskite prevents the formation of inactive FAPbI3 phases and imparts robustness to the perovskite structure, as is confirmed from XRD studies. Furthermore, XPS studies also show that upon sputtering, the minimum change (in terms of electronic structure, evidenced in the form of change in the VB position upon sputtering) is experienced by the 5% Cs+ perovskite, thus indicating that low proportions of Cs+ stabilize the perovskite.

All chemicals were procured from Sigma Aldrich and used as such; PbI2 was obtained from TCI, while MAI and FAI were procured from Dyesol and employed without any treatment or purification. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was acquired from Merck KGaA.


Perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated on FTO-coated glass (TEC15, Pilkington) pre-patterned by laser etching. Prior to usage (perovskite deposition), the substrates were cleaned using Hellmanex® solution and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. Following this, the samples were ultrasonicated in acetone, rinsed using 2-propanol and dried by using compressed air. A TiO2 compact layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using a titanium diisopropoxide-bis(acetyl acetonate) precursor solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma Aldrich) using dry air as a carrier gas. The TiO2 blocking layer was then annealed for 30 minutes at 450 °C for the formation of the anatase phase. Once samples reached ambient temperature, a TiO2 mesoporous layer (Dyesol, 30NRD) was deposited by spin-coating (4000 rpm for 20 s), and the samples were annealed progressively at 450 °C. Subsequently a 1.2 M mixed cation perovskite ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15) layer was then deposited, by a one-step method. The perovskite solution was spin-coated in two steps: at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s respectively. In the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the spinning substrate (during the last 15 seconds) as an anti-solvent approach. The samples were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in an argon filled glove box. For the triple cation based perovskite (Cs/FA/MA), CsI was separately dissolved (1.5 M stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), and added to the mixed perovskite precursor to achieve the desired composition (5% and 10%).

Once the perovskite film was annealed and left to cool down, 35 μL of a Spiro-OMeTAD solution was then deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 20 seconds as the hole transport material. The Spiro-OMeTAD material (72.3 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene by using additives: 17.5 μL of a lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) stock solution (520 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile), 21.9 μL of a FK209 (tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide)) stock solution (400 mg in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP). Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited as a metallic contact by thermal evaporation at a vacuum level of between 1 × 10−6 and 1 × 10−5 torr. All the solutions were prepared inside an argon filled glove box under controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (H2O level: <1 ppm and O2 level: <10 ppm).

The transmittance and reflectance spectra of the perovskite films were collected using a Cary 60 spectrophotometer. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were documented with a Keithley 2400 source-measurement-unit under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2 illumination from a 450 W AAA solar simulator (ORIEL, 94023 A). This was calibrated using a NREL certified calibrated mono-crystalline silicon solar cell. A black metal mask (0.16 cm2) was used over the square solar cell active area (0.5 cm2) to reduce the influence of scattered light.

Photovoltaic parameters including JSC, VOC, fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were extracted from the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells. The scan rate and the active surface area used for measuring the devices were optimized as such to calculate the real value for efficiencies without having a hysteresis effect. (Active surface area: 0.16 cm2, scan rate: 100 mV s−1, pre-sweep delay: 20 s). The IPCE measurements were performed using a Newport 150 W xenon lamp coupled to an Oriel Cornerstone 260 motorized ¼ m monochromator as the light source, and a 2936-R power meter to measure the short circuit current.
For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization, films were prepared by spin-coating the perovskites onto FTO glass. For XPS, an Omicron Nanotechnology GmbH system operating at a base pressure of ∼6 × 10−11 Torr with a non-monochromatized Mg Kα line at 1253.6 eV was used. The acquired resolution of core levels was 0.1 eV measured at 90% of peak height and the spectra were acquired at 25 eV pass energy. The survey spectra were acquired with 100 eV pass energy, and the resolution is 1 eV. An EKF 300 ion source, operating at a pressure of 1.6 × 10−5 mbar, was used for depth-profiling and sputtering and it was effected by an Ar+ ion beam energy of 0.5 kV. The target current was 59.3 μA, and the sputtering time was 5 min. The sputtering rates employed were small enough to remove the top layers. The core level spectra were deconvoluted using a non-linear iterative least squares Gaussian fitting procedure. For all fitting multiplets, the FWHMs were fixed accordingly. Corrections due to charging effects were taken care of by using C(1s) as an internal reference and the Fermi edge of a gold sample. The Jandel Peak FitTM (version 4.01) program was used for the analysis. XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku powder diffractometer using a CuKα source. The wavelength range of the UV lamp used was between 250 and 365 nm and the samples were kept in an ambient atmosphere (55–60% RH) in our lab. Absorption spectra were recorded for the perovskites by using an Agilent Carry 60 spectrophotometer. The ETM, absorber and HTM layer thicknesses were 150, 480 and 270 nm respectively.

To conclude, efficient solar cells were fabricated by using Cs/MA/FA as a triple cation. Although 5% Cs+ addition in the (MA0.15FA0.85)Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite has a profound influence on the fill factor and JSC of the cell, 10% Cs+ addition resulted in a lower device performance. It was found that at higher proportions, Cs+ pre-dominates across the depth of the perovskite, compared to the surface. At 5% Cs+ addition, the expected I:N and Br:Pb2+ ratios of 3, are closest to this value compared to the perovskite without Cs+ and the one with 10% Cs+. The I:Pb ratio of 3 is better maintained across the depth of the perovskite compared to the surface, in all three cases. The C:Pb2+ ratio is closest to the expected stoichiometric ratio of 1 for the perovskite with 10% Cs+. The valence band position for the perovskite with 10% Cs+ is most downshifted compared to the ones without Cs+ and with 10% Cs+, which again aligns well with the highest value of VOC obtained for 10% Cs+. The perovskite with 5% Cs+ is the most robust among the three perovskites, for post-sputtering it retains the highest Pb2+ proportion, and its electronic structure or valence band edge is least perturbed. The Cs3d region also produces an unusual signal, thus indicating the presence of strong electrostatic attractive interactions between Cs+, I− and Br−, which too contribute to stabilizing the lattice. These studies show that Cs+ certainly preserves the compositional and electronic (structural) integrity of the perovskite, and therefore incorporation of small quantities of Cs+ appears to be the way forward for developing high performance chemically robust perovskites.
