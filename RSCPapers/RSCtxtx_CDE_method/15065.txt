The ethynyl group has been widely employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as an efficient π-spacer to prolong conjugation and promote electronic coupling at the interface of TiO2 films. However, systematic studies of the ethynyl position on metal-free organic sensitizers remain relatively rare. Herein we report indoline-based organic dyes bearing an ethynyl group at different positions of D–A–π–A organic dyes. Based on the reference dye D1, we inserted an ethynyl unit in either the left or right side of benzothiadiazole to construct two novel dyes D2 and D3. It was found that inserting an ethynyl unit to the side of the anchoring group obtained a higher molar extinction coefficient with a red shift in the absorption band. Interestingly, D2 and D3 displayed a better photovoltaic performance with respect to D1. In particular, D3 exhibits an over 90 mV enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) than D2 owing to a longer electron lifetime and slower charge recombination. With this incredible increase of VOC, D3 bestows a high efficiency of 7.13% with respect to D1 and D2. Coadsorption strategies are exploited for further improving the cell behaviour. As a result, cosensitization with a long-wavelength-responsive dye WS-2 was demonstrated to efficiently compensate the light-harvesting, achieving an excellent efficiency of 9.83% in the iodine electrolyte. This work has paved a useful and practical way for molecular engineering in D–A–π–A metal-free organic dyes.

Recently, tremendous research has been carried out endeavoring to exploit solar energy for the strategy of renewable energy sustainable development. As an effective method of utilizating solar energy with low cost and facile fabrication, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained extensive attention. Here the structural engineering of the sensitizing dyes plays a vital role, which can rationally affect the performance of fabricated solar cells by influencing the molecular planarity, light-harvesting ability and molecular interaction.

Since Diau et al. reported the “push–pull” of porphyrin dyes by incorporating ethynylcoboxyphenyl as an anchoring group, the ethynyl unit has been widely exploited to link with porphyrins to construct new types of sensitizers, which can effectively promote strong electronic coupling at the interface of TiO2 films and broaden the light-harvesting region, resulting in better photovoltaic performances. For example, Grätzel et al. reported two ethynyl-containing porphyrin sensitizers SM315 and SM371, achieving a record efficiency of 13% in 2014. Xie et al. also successfully inserted multiple triple bonds into porphyrin sensitizers, along with a cosensitization strategy to achieve a high efficiency of 10.45% in an iodine electrolyte. More recently, Wang et al. also introduced an ethynyl group into a metal-free donor–acceptor dye, realizing a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 12.5%. However, systematic studies into the ethynyl position on metal-free organic sensitizers remain relatively rare.
Alternatively, a molecular so-called D–A–π–A model formed by incorporating an auxiliary acceptor into the π bridge has been demonstrated to be an effective way to decrease the optical band gap, stabilize the electron-rich donor, and improve the dye stability. With the introduction of an auxiliary group such as benzothiadiazole (BTD), both metal-free organic dyes and porphyrin dyes show a significant enhancement in their photovoltaic performances.
With this in mind, we designed three novel D–A–π–A dyes (Fig. 1). D1 is an indoline-based D–A–π–A sensitizer featuring a BTD group as an auxiliary acceptor and benzoic acid as an anchoring group. The DSSCs fabricated with D1 displayed a power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 6.12%. Based on D1, we attempted to insert an ethynyl unit in different sides of the BTD group to construct another two novel dyes named D2 and D3, respectively. Both of them demonstrated enhanced efficiencies compared with D1. Interestingly, with a small change in the molecular design, D3-based DSSCs exhibited a great enhancement in photovoltage compared to D2, which can be ascribed to the longer electron lifetime of D3-based devices. Moreover, the cosensitization strategy of D3 with broad absorption spectra WS-2 was adopted to further improve the photovoltaic performances, increasing from 7.13% to 9.83%.


1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained with a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were obtained with a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were obtained using a model CARY 100 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in dichloromethane with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) based on a three electrode system, using Pt as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode.


The fabrication of solar cells as well as the relevant preparation of TiO2 photoanodes (a 6 μm nanoporous layer and a 8 μm scattering layer) and counter electrodes were carried out following previous work. Each dye was dissolved in a mixture of solvents (CHCl3:C2H5OH = 1:1), which was used as a dye sensitized solution with a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M. For single DSSCs, the TiO2 films were dipped in the dye solution for 12 h, rinsed with ethanol and dried. For the cosensitization process, the TiO2 films were firstly immersed in a solution of WS-2 for 1 h, and then were immersed in a solution of D3 for 12 h, rinsed with ethanol and dried. The liquid redox electrolyte was made according to ref. 35.

The photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light using Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter Instruments. The incident photon-to-charge carrier efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured using the Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed for DSSCs using a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation, with an alternative sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mV and a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. The original spectra were further analyzed by Z-View software.

Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was refluxed using sodium for dehydration under argon atmosphere before use. All other chemical reagents and solvents were commercially available and used without further purification.

The synthetic routes of dyes D1 to D3 are shown in Scheme 1. The common intermediates 1c and 1d were synthesized according to the ref. 10, 26 and 27. Dye D1 was conveniently obtained by the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction of 1c and 1d, and then hydrolysis of 1e. For the ethynyl-containing dye D2, we firstly introduced the triple bond to the intermediate 1cvia the Sonogashira reaction, and obtained the intermediate 2b. It was further reacted with 1d to give the dye precursor 2c, and eventually gained dye D2 after hydrolysis. The synthetic procedure of dye D3 was similar to that of dye D2. The only change is that the insertion of triple bond is close to the anchoring group, rather than the neighboring donor.


Fig. 2a depicts the UV-Vis absorption spectra of D1, D2 and D3 in CH2Cl2 solution (3 × 10−5 M), and the corresponding spectral parameters are summarized in Table 1. All three dyes presented two similar absorption bands. The short wavelength band around 340 nm could be ascribed to the π–π* transition, while the long wavelength band at 500 nm was due to the interfacial charge-transfer (ICT) transitions. Besides, upon insertion of a triple bond to the neighboring donor, D2 exhibited a slight hypochromatic shift in the absorption band with respect to D1. Remarkably, when incorporating an ethynyl unit to the right side of auxiliary group, dye D3 exhibited a significant redshift from 484 to 508 nm in the absorption band, along with an obvious increase in the molar extinction coefficient (2.57 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 508 nm). Obviously, inserting an ethynyl unit to the side of anchoring group could obtain a higher molar extinction coefficient with a red shift in the absorption band.

Upon adsorption onto a 3 μm transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 film, the absorption spectra of all organic dyes (Fig. 2b) were obviously hypsochromic shifted compared to those in solution due to the intermolecular interaction and deprotonation of the carboxylic acid. The ICT bands of dyes D1, D2 and D3 showed a hypsochromic shift by 22, 29 and 34 nm, respectively. Besides, D2 and D3 exhibited higher and broader absorption spectra compared to D1, indicating that the insertion of an ethynyl unit is beneficial to prolong conjugation and improve light-harvesting capability after anchoring onto TiO2 films.
To evaluate the process of electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2 and explore the ability of dye regeneration, CV of three organic dyes in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell was carried out to investigate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (Fig. S1, ESI). The calculated HOMO level of dye D1 obtained from the first oxidation potentials is 0.87 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (Fig. 3). After incorporating the ethynyl unit, the HOMO levels of D2 and D3 were both slightly shifted downward to 0.91 and 0.88 V, which obviously lay below the iodide/triiodide (0.40 V vs. NHE), guaranteeing efficient dye regeneration. The band gap energy (E0−0) was estimated from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity as shown in Table 1. Interestingly, changing the ethynyl position from the donor side to the acceptor side leads to a band gap of D3 (2.07 V) that is narrower than D2 (2.18 V). Herein, the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of D3 was −1.19 V, showing a relatively downward shift compared to D1 (−1.30 V) and D2 (−1.27 V). Besides, all of the LUMO levels can guarantee the ample electron injection from the excited dyes into the TiO2 conduction band (−0.50 V vs. NHE).
To gain insight into the effect of the ethynyl unit on the molecular structure and electron distribution, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of all three dyes were used to optimize the ground state geometries of the molecules, using the hybrid B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set (Tables S1 and S2, ESI). All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian09 program package. As shown in Fig. 4, the dihedral angles between the donor and auxiliary group (α) and between the auxiliary group and phenyl unit (β) of the three dyes exhibited very different values, indicative of a good molecular planarity. For dye D1, both of the dihedral angles possess the largest values of 33.5° and 35.5°. With insertion of a triple bond to the neighboring donor, the corresponding dihedral angle of α was 0.7°, distinctly becoming planar at the side of the donor compared to D1. Accordingly, the molecular structure of D3 showed a similar change, leading to a nearly 0° dihedral angle of β upon incorporation of the ethynyl unit into the neighboring side of the anchoring group. In addition, the computed spatial distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals also shows the insertion influence of the ethynyl unit. It was found that both the HOMO and LUMO of D2 receive certain contributions from the ethynyl moiety, as well as that of D3. This change in electron distribution is beneficial to the transition process from HOMO to LUMO.
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs based on the three dyes were measured under an irradiance of simulated AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) using iodide/triiodide electrolyte (Fig. 5a), and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table 2. D1-based DSSCs performed an efficiency (η) of 6.12%, with a short-circuit current (JSC) of 12.6 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 728 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.67. As expected, JSC values of 13.22 and 13.44 mA cm−2 were obtained with dyes D2 and D3, which were slightly higher than that of D1, probably due to the larger conjugation in the molecular structure upon inserting the ethynyl unit. As shown in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 5b), D2 and D3 exhibited a slightly broader plateau than that of D1, along with no obvious change in the initial response wavelength. Besides, D3 achieved over 70% in the range of 440–600 nm, with a highest IPCE value of 80% at 480 nm. As a consequence, the improvement in the JSC of D2 and D3 could be attributed to the broader absorption spectra and the enhanced absorption coefficients.

Moreover, with the insertion of a triple bond to the side of the anchoring group, the DSSCs based on D3 brought forth a distinct increase of 91 mV in the VOC value as compared to that of D2, which incorporated an ethynyl unit to the side of the donor, resulting in a relatively higher efficiency of 7.13%. It should be noted that, with a small change in molecular engineering, the DSSCs based on D3 obtained a predominant contribution from the enhancement in VOC compared to that of D2.
As is well known, the variation of VOC is dependent upon the position of the TiO2 conduction band (ECB) and the electron density in the semiconductor. The electron density is strongly dependent on the rate of charge recombination, which can usually be evaluated by the electron lifetimes. To analyse the variances of the three dye-based sensitizers in the voltage as well as to further investigate the interfacial charge transfer and recombination process, we performed EIS in the dark with a series of bias voltages. The values of chemical capacitance (Cμ) of these identical devices are shown in Fig. 6a, which is relevant to the shift of the conduction band of TiO2. It was found that for all three dyes, the logarithm of Cμ increases linearly with the bias voltage in the same order of magnitude. Here, the same level of Cμ values meant that the positions of the TiO2 conduction band of D2 and D3 based sensitizers saw little fluctuation after inserting the ethynyl unit as compared to that of D1.
On the other hand, the recombination resistance (RCT) of all three sensitizers are presented in Fig. 6b. At a fixed potential, the RCT increased as D2 < D1 < D3, which is in very good agreement with their relevant tendency of the VOC values. The electron lifetimes as a function of potential were also measured to further elucidate the degree of electron recombination at the TiO2 electrolyte interface, which could be obtained from the equation τ = CμRCT. As shown in Fig. 6c, D3-based DSSCs exhibited longer lifetimes in all regions of tested potential than that of D2, which implies that the insertion of an ethynyl unit to the neighboring side of the anchoring group can more effectively suppress the process of charge recombination, resulting in an obviously higher electron density in the TiO2 conduction band. As a result, it renders the superior photovoltage performance of D3 based cells. Generally speaking, after inserting an ethynyl group on the side of the anchoring group, D3 exhibited an extraordinary open circuit voltage as compared with D1 and D2, which could provide an effective method to improve solar cell performance in future design. Herein, the HOMO levels may not be the major reason inducing the variation of VOC.
As mentioned above, D3 showed a narrow IPCE response leading to low JSC values along with a cutoff wavelength at 700 nm, and a moderate dip in the IPCE spectrum is observed around 400 nm, which mainly results from the effects of the low absorbance of the dyes in this region and the competitive absorption of triiodide in the electrolyte. Given that D3 exhibited a potentially high photvoltage, D3-based DSSCs are expected to be optimized when the IPCE spectrum would be improved, especially at long wavelength regions. We further exploited chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a coadsorbent with D3 to improve the photovoltaic performance. Indeed, the relevant solar cells achieved a higher JSC with a slight decrease of VOC, resulting in a higher efficiency of 8.22% (VOC: 775 mV; JSC: 15.1 mA cm−2). Its IPCE spectrum also showed an obvious increase in the range of 350–630 nm compared to the individual dye (Fig. 7b). This improvement could be attributed to the influence of CDCA, which can reduce dye aggregation and the intermolecular interaction to some extent. Besides, the amount of adsorbed D3 has almost no significant change after coadsorption with CDCA (Table 3).

Although the utilization of CDCA can improve the cell performance by suppressing dye aggregation, there is no dramatic promotion in photovoltaic efficiency, especially the relatively narrow IPCE response, which still restricted the performances of D3-based solar cells. Here, another strategy of cosensitization with a broad spectral response dye for pursuing better cell performances was carried out. According to our previous work, WS-2 (Fig. S2, ESI) exhibited efficient IPCE values above 70% from 400 to 680 nm with the cutoff wavelength at 800 nm, which is apparently compensated with dye D3. Besides, D3 showed an extremely high open-circuit voltage, which can significantly improve the poor performance in photovoltage of WS-2.
For the cosensitized cells of WS-2 and D3, the IPCE spectra showed above 80% from 450 to 650 nm with the cutoff wavelength extending to 800 nm. The adsorption amounts for WS-2 and D3 in the cosensitized condition are 0.45 × 10−7 and 1.87 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. After cosensitization, the amount of D3 decreased from 2.33 × 10−7 to 1.87 × 10−7 mol cm−2, but a considerable amount of WS-2 was adsorbed, which resulted in a significant enhancement in the IPCE spectra. Furthermore, the VOC of cosensitized cells became 737 mV, an obvious increase relative to the single WS-2 (653 mV). Finally, as shown in Fig. 7a and Table 3, the strategy of cosensitization with WS-2 resulted in a significant enhancement in JSC, and showed an excellent efficiency of 9.83% in the iodine electrolyte.

In summary, we have synthesized three novel D–A–π–A organic dyes, and have obtained systematic insight into the effect of ethynyl position on photovoltaic performances. Compared to D1, dye D2, incorporating an ethynyl group between the donor group indoline and auxiliary group, showed little change in absorption and a limited enhancement in molar extinction coefficients, and eventually had no significant enhancement in photovoltaic performance. However, upon inserting an ethynyl group between the auxiliary group and benzene ring, dye D3 successfully red-shifted the absorption band and enhanced the molar extinction coefficients, finally achieving a better efficiency of 7.13%. Strikingly, D3 exhibited excellent VOC values (786 mV), higher than D1 and D2, indicating that this triple bond position could effectively retard the electron recapture, which was proven by EIS measurements. The addition of coadsorbent CDCA with dye D3 exhibited dramatically higher JSC values, resulting in a performance of 8.22%. The cosensitization strategy of WS-2/D3 also achieved an obvious enhancement compared to the individual dye, reaching an optimized efficiency of 9.83% (JSC = 18.30 mA cm−2, VOC = 737 mV, and FF = 0.73). Our results indicate that insertion of an ethynyl group to the appropriate position can effectively broaden the spectral response and develop high efficient D–A–π–A organic sensitizers, paving the way to a practical molecular engineering approach in the development of D–A–π–A metal-free organic dyes.
