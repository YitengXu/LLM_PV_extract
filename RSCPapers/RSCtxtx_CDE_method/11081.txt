A novel heteropolyacid (HPA) K6SiW11O39Ni(H2O)·xH2O (SiW11Ni) modified TiO2 has been successfully synthesized and introduced into the photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The performance of the cell with the HPA-modified photoanode (SiW11Ni/TiO2), mixed with P25 powder in the ratio of 2:8, is better than the cell with a pristine P25 photoanode. An increase of 31% in the photocurrent and 22% improvement in the conversion efficiency are obtained. The effect of the heteropolyacid was well studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, spectro-electrochemical spectroscopy, dark current, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy, open-circuit voltage decay and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the interfacial layer modified by SiW11Ni can enhance the injection and transport of electrons, and then retard the recombination of electrons, which results in a longer electron lifetime. What's more, the introduction of SiW11Ni can simultaneously broaden the absorption in the visible region, eventually leading to an efficient increase in energy conversion efficiency.

The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) developed by Grätzel have been widely studied by researchers due to their low cost, high efficiency and easy fabrication. The typical device structure of DSSCs is composed of a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, an electrolyte with a redox couple, and a counter electrode. The semiconductor photoanode is one of the key factors that affect the final device performance because it relates directly to the light absorption and electron transport in DSSCs. TiO2 is the most common photoanode used in DSSCs. To develop more efficient TiO2 photoanodes, many studies have been done and they mainly concentrated on enhancing the photoabsorption, tuning the energy level, the charge transport and retarding the charge recombination.

Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of inorganic anionic clusters, have been widely applied in medicine, magnetism, nonlinear optics, and catalysis because of their versatile properties. Recently, POMs have been introduced into DSSCs to modify photoanodes. Chen et al. developed a H3PW12O40-based TiO2 photoanode and they found that the H3PW12O40-based TiO2 photoanode can accelerate electron transfer and retard recombination, eventually leading to a 19% increase in photocurrent. Xu et al. prepared multilayer film photoanodes consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (Au) and Dawson-type polyoxometalate K6P2W18O62 by the layer-by-layer self-assembly method, and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) was used as a film forming auxiliary material. They found that K6P2W18O62 could also retard charge pair recombination and enhanced the photovoltaic performance of DSSC with an efficiency of 0.014%. These pioneering studies indicate that POMs are promising candidates to modify the photoanode in DSSCs and to enhance the cell performance.
In this work, we synthesized a novel kind of SiW11Ni modified TiO2 semiconductor (SiW11Ni/TiO2). By mixing SiW11Ni/TiO2 with P25 in different mass ratios and applying them as photoanodes in DSSCs, the performance of the cells was enhanced dramatically compared to the pristine P25 cell. A 31% and 22% improvement in the photocurrent and efficiency was obtained for the DSSC using SiW11Ni/TiO2:P25 = 2:8 as the photoanode. Compared to the pioneering studies, SiW11Ni modified TiO2 as a photoanode has a better performance on the absorption of visible light and power conversion efficiency. We have studied the working mechanism for SiW11Ni/TiO2 in DSSCs in detail. The light absorption, electron injection, electron transport, charge recombination and the physical processes of enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer behavior of the SiW11Ni modified TiO2 were well studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, spectro-electrochemical spectroscopy, dark current, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), respectively. A working mechanism of the SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 photoanode for efficient DSSCs has been proposed.

SiW11Ni was synthesized using a similar method to that discussed in the literature. According to the FT-IR spectrum shown in (Fig. S1a, ESI), the characteristic stretching vibrations for SiW11Ni were observed at 953 cm−1 (W–Od), 908 cm−1 (Si–Oa), 790 cm−1 (W–Ob–W) and 704 cm−1 (W–Oc–W), respectively. The same peak at 527 cm−1 confirmed the Keggin structure of SiW11Ni as reported in the literature. Fig. S1b (ESI) shows the TG curve of SiW11Ni and a high thermal stability can be observed.

TiO2 was modified with SiW11Ni through a hydrothermal method. 0.5 mL HNO3 was diluted into 60 mL deionized water in flask. 10 mL titanium tetraisopropoxide was slowly added with vigorous stirring. Then 0.1 g SiW11Ni was added and a flaky white precipitate could be obtained. This solution with vigorous stirring was kept at around 98 °C for 3 hours, following which the white precipitate re-dissolves and produces an opaque solution. The opaque solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained in an electric oven at 200 °C for 24 hours. After naturally cooling to room temperature, it was centrifuged and washed thoroughly with deionized water and absolute ethanol. After drying at 100 °C under vacuum, the precipitate was calcined at 450 °C for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. Finally SiW11Ni modified TiO2 powders were obtained. Fig. S2a (ESI) shows the high resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p. Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are situated at 458.9 and 464.7 eV for pristine TiO2. After modifying, both of them shifted toward a lower binding energy of about 0.2 eV. This slight change of Ti 2p peaks and 5.8 eV between Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 indicates that they are Ti4+. A similar shift was previously attributed to the change of the local chemical environment of Ti ions influenced by SiW11Ni incorporation and to the formation of Ti⋯O bonds on the surface of TiO2. So, Ti 2p will shift to lower binding energy, and the peaks become slightly broader. Fig. S2b (ESI) displays the O 1s spectra in comparison to SiW11Ni/TiO2 and pristine TiO2 samples. The O 1s region of the pristine TiO2 is located at 530.2 eV, while the peak of SiW11Ni/TiO2 centered at 530.0 eV, further confirming the presence of Ti⋯O weak interaction. The slight shift of these peaks can be attributed to the hydrothermal conditions, which can reduce the number of defects and impurities in TiO2.

All photoanodes were fabricated using a screen printing method. There are two kinds of samples for photoanodes: photoanode SiW11Ni/TiO2 blended with TiO2 nanoparticles (commercial Degussa P25 nanoparticles, which consists of about 20% rutile and 80% anatase and a particle size of about 25 nm) in a weight ratio of 2:8 and pristine TiO2 paste without modification for comparison. Ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol were used as a binder to disperse the mixed powers while ethanol was used as a dispersant. Then the ethanol was removed using rotary evaporation. The resulting slurry was screened-printed onto an F-doped SnO2-coated conductive glass plate (FTO, 90% transmittance in the visible region, 15 Ω cm−2) and sintered at 450 °C for 15 min. The photoanode film with a thickness of 8 μm and an active area of 0.16 cm2 was covered on the FTO substrate by using the screen printing method to create 4 mm × 4 mm electrodes. Fig. S3 (ESI) shows the images of pristine TiO2 and SiW11Ni/TiO2. After modifying with SiW11Ni, we can see some big blocks among TiO2 particles.

The SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 and pristine TiO2 (P25) photoanodes were then immersed in absolute ethanol solution containing 0.3 mM N719 (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) and kept at room temperature for 24 hours. The sandwich-type solar cell was assembled by placing a platinum-coated conductive glass as a counter electrode on the N719 dye-sensitized photo-anode, a drop of liquid electrolyte with 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M TBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) was added to fill the void between two electrodes and clipping together as open cells for measurement.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs were analyzed by FEI Company Helios Nanolab 600i focused ion electrons double beam SEM. Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR Spectrometer with samples prepared as KBr pellet. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were performed on Perkin-Elmer STA 6000 Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in flowing nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a UV-2250 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). A custom jacketed three electrode electrochemical cell was incorporated into an Agilent Technologies Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer such that the mesoporous TiO2 film was positioned normal to the optical path. The photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a CHI660D electrochemical analyzer. The light intensity of AM1.5 global sunlight from a filtered 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XM500, Changtuo, China with an AM1.5 global filter from Newport) was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (calibrated at National Institute of Metrology, P. R. China). EIS and OCVD were recorded by CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer (Chenhua, China) and the applied forward bias was generally −0.8 V while IMPS-IMVS was obtained by applied voltage under illumination with different light intensities from 30 to 150 W m−2. A 300 W Xe lamp was used for incident photon-to-current quantum conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements, a monochromator (Newport 74125) with sorting filters focused on a spot with additional optics. The current response of the devices was recorded in 10 nm increments using a power meter (Newport 2936–C). The measured currents were referenced to a calibrated Silicon detector (Newport 71675).


We mixed the new composite material SiW11Ni/TiO2 with P25 in different mass ratios and applied them as a photoanode in DSSC, and bare P25 based DSSC was also fabricated for comparison. Photovoltaic parameters of a series of DSSCs based on SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 are listed in Table 1. As the wt% of SiW11Ni increases, η rises first and then descends. When the blending ratio is 2:8, the cell gives the best performance. This may attribute to the higher SiW11Ni/TiO2 contents brought about by more grain boundaries for more recombination within DSSCs and result in the poor performance. Fig. 1 shows the optimized current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the P25- and SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25-based DSSCs. The DSSC based on SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 photoanode gives a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.38 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V and a fill factor of (FF) 0.61, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.82%. Compared with that of the DSSC using bare P25 as the photoanode, a 31% and 22% increase in Jsc and η was obtained. The performance of P25 is analogous to the references.

The corresponding IPCE spectra of the DSSCs were also measured and shown in Fig. 2, the photoanode DSSC based on SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 exhibits a significant effect on absorbed photon-to-collected electron efficiency. The improvement of the charge collection yield in the IPCE spectra were in good agreement with the measured photocurrent density. To explore the reason of the enhancement, we studied on the working mechanism of SiW11Ni modified TiO2 in detail.

Fig. 3 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra and the band gap (the inset graph) of TiO2 and SiW11Ni/TiO2. For both pristine SiW11Ni and SiW11Ni/TiO2, an absorption in the visible region is observed. It is well known that TiO2 only absorb UV light (λ < 387 nm) without any absorption in visible and infrared regions. After the modification with SiW11Ni, the absorption of TiO2 in the visible region changed obviously from 365 nm to 525 nm, which effectively compensates the weak absorption of titania in the visible region. More importantly, N719 has weak absorption in the range of 400–450 nm and this compensation effect is conducive to improve the utilization efficiency of light, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The band gap of SiW11Ni/TiO2 is found to be 2.92 eV, which is lower than the band gap of the TiO2 (3.14 eV). According to the Tauc plot equation, the direct band gap energies of samples are calculated using the point of intersection of the tangents to the plots of (αhν)2vs. (hν). In addition, the reduction of the band gap energy of SiW11Ni/TiO2 compared to the pristine TiO2 indicates that an obvious red shift on the absorbance toward the visible region and increasing energy difference from the LUMO of N719 to the CB of TiO2, and then increase the driving force of the electron injection.
To make clear the contribution of SiW11Ni/TiO2 in the electron injection and transport, spectro-electrochemistry spectroscopy and dark current were studied. The chemical capacitance of the TiO2 and SiW11Ni/TiO2 photoanode films as a function of the applied potential was measured and is shown in Fig. 4a. The chemical capacitance of the SiW11Ni/TiO2 film shifts leftward compared with that of the pristine TiO2 film, which is because of the band edge of SiW11Ni/TiO2 decrease downward the I3−/I− potential. From Fig. 4a, we can deduce the flat band potential (Vfb) which is a very important parameter in spectro-electrochemistry and it can directly reflect the location of the energetic position of the valence band and conduction band edge of a given semiconductor material. Michael Grätzel proposed that the main contribution to the optical absorption at 780 nm comes from interband transitions or from free carrier absorption, therefore the absorbance is proportional to the density of electrons in the conduction band. The Vfb of TiO2 and SiW11Ni/TiO2 was shown in Fig. 4b. We can see that the absorbance of TiO2 and SiW11Ni/TiO2 transparent films at 780 nm with the applied potential. By introducing SiW11Ni into the photoanode, the Vfb of TiO2 (around −0.6 V) positively shifts to −0.4 V, which indicates that the Fermi level of SiW11Ni/TiO2 is lower than that of pristine TiO2. The shift of the conduction band edge will be accompanied by an equal displacement of the quasi-Fermi level relative to the I3−/I− Fermi level. If the band edge shifts positively, the electrons' quasi-Fermi level also shifts toward the positive direction. The lower Fermi level increases the energy gap between the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2, which results in an enhanced injection driving force of electrons and then improves the photogenerated electron injection efficiency from the LUMO of dye to the conduction band of TiO2. This result will benefit for charge transfer. At the same time, the recombination between injected electrons, dye cations and iodide ions is reduced. In addition, the decrease of the Fermi level of SiW11Ni/TiO2 results in the decrease of Voc. It is because Voc is related to the difference between the Fermi level of the photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte. The schematic energy level diagram for the electrode interface is presented in Scheme S1 (ESI).
The electrons transfer of SiW11Ni/TiO2 was studied by the dark current vs voltage. As shown in Fig. 5a, the onset of the dark current of the bare DSSC occurred at 0.3 V, whereas for the SiW11Ni/TiO2 based DSSC, the onset of the dark current was suppressed. The reduction of the dark current demonstrates that the SiW11Ni based photoanode successfully reduced the recombination reaction of the electrons. Therefore, the dark current density in the DSSCs with SiW11Ni was obviously suppressed, which enhanced the η values of the DSSCs. The result is also supported by the outcome of IMPS-IMVS shown in the following.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to study the electron transport behavior and the internal resistances of the DSSCs.Fig. 5b is the EIS measurements that we carried out in the dark to further determine the effect of SiW11Ni modified TiO2 about electron recombination progress. In the dark, there were no electrons injected from dye sensitizer into TiO2 network, electrons were just transported through the TiO2 nanoparticles and reacted with the redox electrolyte (I3−). Fig. S5 (ESI) is the equivalent circuit obtained by using transmission line model: Rs(C1(R1O))(R2Q2). The series resistance (Rs) can account for the resistance of the FTO glass substrate, the contact resistance of the cell and the resistance of the external circuits. The semicircle in high frequency corresponds to R2, which represents the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface; the second semicircle (R1) in the intermediate frequency region reflects the electron transport resistance in the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface related to the charge transport/recombination. The corresponding parameters obtained by the equivalent circuit were listed in Table 2. The two values of R2 are similar because of the identical Pt counter, and the R1 values of P25 and SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 are 11.08 and 28.77 ohm, respectively, which indicates that the SiW11Ni/TiO2 photoanode based DSSC is better at retarding the recombination progress than the pristine TiO2 between the injected electron and the redox electrolyte. The EIS result is in good agreement with the dark current discussed above.

In DSSCs, the electron recombination time (τn) and the electron transport time (τd) are very important factors for the performance of DSSCs. They are the consequence of the competition between the recombination and transport of electrons across the photoanode. τn and τd are calculated by IMVS and IMPS measurements through eqn (1) and (2) respectively:
(1)
(2)
where
fn and fd are the characteristic frequency minima of the IMVS and IMPS imaginary components, respectively. The τn and τd of P25 and SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 as a function of the incident light intensity are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a and b show the τn and τd of the DSSCs based on two different photoanodes noted above. τn of SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 is higher than that of P25 while τd of SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 is lower than that of P25. It is because of the excellent electron injection and good electron transport of the SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 photoanode, which suppresses the excited electrons to react with iodine in the interfacial region between the electrolyte and the photoanode. The above results strongly demonstrate that the prepared SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 is a promising photoanode candidate for the DSSCs.

The electrons recombining with the electrolytes can be further revealed by the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) technique which monitors the decay of Voc after turning off the illumination in a setting time.Fig. 7a shows the OCVD curves of the DSSCs with the pristine P25 and SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 photoanodes. It can be seen that the electron lifetime in the DSSCs with SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 photoanode was longer than that of pristine P25, which indicates that its rate of decay is much slower. The recombination rate between electrons and the oxide electrolyte has been restrained effectively, finally resulting in the much longer electron lifetime. Fig. 7b shows the electron lifetime derived from eqn (3) as a function of Voc.

The electrons lifetime of pristine TiO2 photoanode was shorter than that of the modified one. The results were consistent with the ones we concluded from IMVS and IMPS.
Based on the above analyzation, the considerable improvement in Jsc and η can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) for the modified TiO2, the flat band (Vfb) (about −0.6 V) shifts positively to −0.4 V. This result increases the driving force for electron injection, improving the electron injection efficiency from the LUMO of N719 to the conduction band of TiO2. The modified SiW11Ni on TiO2 also improves the electron transport. The improved electron injection and transport for the new photoanode restrains the electrons recombining between the oxide electrolyte and dye cations effectively and prolongs the lifetime of electrons; (2) the band gap of SiW11Ni/TiO2 turns narrow and the response in the visible region is expanded. The good electron transport makes it possible to increase the utilization percentage of visible light.
Finally, a possible working mechanism of the SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 photoanode for efficient DSSCs is proposed and shown in Scheme 1. Upon being excited by the illumination, the sensitizer dye molecules (N719) absorb the visible light and reach their excited state (Dye*), by which electrons are excited from the HOMO to the LUMO of the dye and photoelectrons will be injected from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. At the same time, SiW11Ni particles absorb the visible light into HPB (heteropolyblue) and remove holes from the photoanode and then inject them into the electrolyte. Unfortunately, a certain amount of injected electrons return back from the CB of TiO2 to HOMO of the dye before flowing into the external circuit and some occur at the SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25/dye/electrolyte interface (dotted lines in Scheme 1). Particularly at the interfacial region, electron recombination may be overcome by introducing a powerful electron acceptor. HPA leads to a decrease in the recombination of electrons–hole because it accepts electrons from the TiO2 conduction band so that electrons and holes can be separated as effective charge carriers. Thus, HPA can serve as an electron mediator, which shuttles electrons from the electrolyte to the electrode effectively and helps to enhance the efficiencies. Under illumination, the most injected electrons are recaptured by I3− before being extracted to the external circuit. SiW11Ni captured the returning electrons to reduce itself to form HPB. In this process, HPB also plays an important role in the DSSCs, absorbing visible light into HPB*, and HPB* can inject electrons into the CB of TiO2. The intermediate HPB was excited and reduced to the excited SiW11Ni, which subsequently returned to the ground state of SiW11Ni. Thus, it avoided the photoreduction of iodine on the surface of the photoanode. Such an effective electron transfer in SiW11Ni can remove the fast electron–hole recombination on TiO2 and is ascertained from the lifetime of the transient species available in the literature. Meanwhile, the oxidized dye and SiW11Ni are regenerated by I−. As a result, the absorbed photon energy is converted to heat through the two coupled redox cycles involving sensitized electrons injection, dye regeneration and electron recapture by I3−. In general, the introduction of SiW11Ni can inhibit most of the backward reactions that take place in the standard dye sensitized solar cell system and then increase the photocurrent generation by enhancing the absorption and retarding the regeneration of the electrode. All the above merits improved the performance and stability of DSSCs.

In summary, we have successfully synthesized a novel composite material of SiW11Ni/TiO2 that can effectively modify a photoanode. The DSSC based on the SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 (2:8) photoanode exhibits high performance in both Jsc and η, increasing from 13.28 mA cm−2 and 6.42% (P25 as photoanode) to 17.38 mA cm−2 and 7.82% (SiW11Ni/TiO2-P25 as a photoanode). The overall improvement in the photocurrent and efficiency is 31% and 22% respectively. The considerable improvement in the Jsc and η can be attributed to the following reasons by the introduction of SiW11Ni: (1) excellent electron injection and good electrons transport; (2) retarding the electrons recombination between the oxide electrolyte and dye cations; (3) the narrowed band gap of SiW11Ni/TiO2 and the expanded response to the visible region. All these merits are beneficial to the improvement of the performance of the device.
