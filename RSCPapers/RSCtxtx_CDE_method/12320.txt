Realizing the triple functions of simultaneously improved open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) enabled by material design is a vital challenge for achieving efficient and stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we developed a new wide-bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer, J101, with a down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level by chlorine substitution on its 2-alkyl-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTz) unit. The PSCs fabricated by combining the J101 donor with the indenoindene-containing fused-ring electron acceptor ZITI demonstrated a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.43% with a high Voc of 0.937 V, a high Jsc of 21.25 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 72.48%, benefitting from the low HOMO level of the donor, suitable nanoscale morphology, efficient charge transport properties and reduced recombination losses. Furthermore, semitransparent PSCs based on the optimized J101:ZITI blend exhibited the best PCE of 11.04% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 21.69%. This work demonstrates that the chlorine substituted BTz unit is an excellent electron-accepting building block for high-performance opaque and semitransparent PSCs.

Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the acceptor have attracted significant attention in the last three decades due to the advantages of light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility, and capability to be fabricated into semitransparent devices with tunable color. To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction PSCs have surpassed 14% due to the development of new polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). The highly tunable optoelectronic properties of the NFA-based photoactive layers have enabled the precise optimization of molecular energy levels, complementary absorption spectra and charge carrier mobilities of the electron donor and acceptor materials. Thus, great efforts have been made toward the development of NFAs in the last few years, leading to higher PCEs than fullerene acceptor-based PSCs. Along with the development of acceptor materials, it is also extremely important to develop well-matched conjugated polymer donor materials via fine molecular design strategies.

Many efficient molecular design strategies have been developed to efficiently modify the optoelectronic properties of polymer donor materials, including donor–acceptor (D–A) structural modifications, conjugated bridge modulations, heteroatom substitutions, and side chain engineering, among which the heteroatom substituents (e.g. fluorine and chlorine) represent critical adornments on the molecular skeleton to significantly impact inter/intramolecular reactions and material absorption coefficients, and to serve as a meticulous adjustment avenue of energy levels. Recently, it has been demonstrated that fluorination is a very promising molecular design strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance. However, fluorination reactions usually involved the use of toxic chemic reagents and the steps in the introduction of fluorine into molecular structures are tedious and time-consuming. These disadvantages of fluorinated photovoltaic materials may limit their further commercial application. More recently, an emerging trend in PSCs has been to replace the most electronegative fluorine atom with a chlorine atom, which is a second-highest electronegative element in the halogen group. As implied in a few recent studies, the synthesis of the chlorinated conjugated polymer is simpler, and the raw material was easier to obtain. Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the chlorinated polymers are even deeper than its fluorinated analogs benefited from the free 3d empty orbital of Cl available for π-electron delocalization. Besides, compared to a fluorine atom with a small van der Waals radius of 1.35 Å, a chlorine atom has a much larger van der Waals radius (1.75 Å). As expected, chlorine atoms would suitably disrupt the backbone planarity to modify the BHJ morphology.
Previous investigations on PSCs showed that fluorinated 2-alkyl-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (FBTz) based conjugated polymers paired with various NFAs demonstrated excellent photovoltaic properties. However, chlorinated BTz (ClBTz)-containing polymer materials have not been investigated so far. Given all this, in this work, a new D–A conjugated polymer J101 based on ClBTz as the acceptor unit was designed and synthesized. Compared with its fluorinated analog J71, J101 possesses a higher oscillator strength and absorption coefficient and shows a more down-shifted HOMO energy level. Combined with the indenoindene-containing fused-ring electron acceptor ZITI in the PSCs, a PCE of 14.43% for an opaque device and a PCE of 11.04% for a semitransparent device were achieved, respectively, which, to the best of our knowledge, are among the highest PCEs for opaque and semitransparent binary OSCs reported in the literature to date.
The synthetic route of J101, which was prepared by typical Stille polymerization, is shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data can be found in the Experimental section of the ESI. Both the donors (J71 and J101) and acceptors (ITIC and ZITI) can be dissolved in common solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of J101 and J71 are 28.1 and 25.9 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.89 and 2.00, respectively (Fig. S1 in the ESI).
The optimal dihedral angle and the twisting barrier of 2ClBTz-T are different from those of 2FBTz-T, as presented in Fig. 1a. In the stable state, the optimal torsional angle of 2FBTz-T is 0°, 180°, or 360° and that of 2ClBTz-T is 38°, 136°, 223°, or 321°. From 0° to 180°, 2FBTz-T exhibits a metastable state at 91°, yet 2ClBTz-T shows a metastable state at 90° and 180°. The energy barriers from the stable state to the metastable state of 2FBTz-T are 21.7 KJ mol−1 and 18.2 kJ mol, and these barriers of 2ClBTz-T are 3.9 KJ mol−1, 4.3 KJ mol−1, and 7.9 kJ mol−1, respectively. Therefore, compared to 2FBTz-T, 2ClBTz-T shows a less planar structure. In other words, 2ClBTz-T could more easily rotate to its stable state compared to 2FBTz-T. We also calculated the optimal geometries of BTz-T-2Cl and BTz-T-2F, as shown in Fig. S2. Compared to the torsional angle of BTz-T-2F (−1.78°), BTz-T-2Cl possesses a higher torsional angle of −54.9° due to the higher steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, and the chlorine atoms would disrupt the planarity and induce torsion in the backbone. Besides, Fig. 1b exhibits the oscillator strength (f1) as a function of the number of π-electrons (Nπ) calculated for several conjugated oligomers of J71 and J101 in the linear all-cis configuration. It can be found that J101 shows a larger value of f1 than J71 with a corresponding oligomer length of up to N ≈ 160, probably due to a superlinear increase in polarizability with oligomer length. This result is also in agreement with the measured absorption coefficients of J101 and J71. As presented in Fig. S3a, J71 exhibits an absorption maximum at 540 nm with an extinction coefficient of 8.55 × 104 cm−1 in the thin film, while J101 grafting two chlorine atoms at the BTz unit provides a red-shifted maximum at 545 nm and a slightly higher extinction coefficient of 8.68 × 104 cm−1.
Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the chlorinated polymer J101 and fluorinated polymer J71 in chloroform solution and thin film, as well as the reference spectra of the acceptors ITIC and ZITI in thin films are shown in Fig. 1c and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table S1. The absorption of the J71 film is only red-shifted a little compared to that of its solution, which reveals that strong aggregation exists in the solution. In contrast, in comparison to the absorption of J101 in solution, its film was significantly red-shifted, extending the absorption maximum from 507 nm to 544 nm with a new long-wavelength peak at 581 nm. Temperature-dependent absorption (TD-Abs) spectra of J71 and J101 in dilute o-dichlorobenzene solutions were recorded to get more insight into their aggregation behaviors. As shown in Fig. S3c and d, the absorption intensity of the J71 shoulder peak in dilute o-DCB solution obviously decreases as the temperature increases from 30 to 110 °C, while that in the J101 solution changes slightly. These phenomena indicate that J71 has a stronger interchain π–π interaction in dilute o-DCB solution than J101. Nevertheless, the molecular absorption bandgaps (1.97 eV) of these two polymers are identical.
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) are measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4). As depicted in Fig. 1d, the EHOMO/LUMO for J71 and J101 is −5.27/−3.60 eV and −5.30/−3.50 eV, respectively. The slightly lower HOMO level (−5.30 eV) of chlorinated J101 as than fluorinated J71 (−5.27 eV) can be attributed to the empty 3d orbitals of the chlorine atom and the larger twist angle of the backbone conjugated polymer. Meanwhile the results are in agreement with the theoretical data calculated with density functional theory (DFT). As exhibited in Fig. S5, the introduction of chlorine atoms into J101 has a little influence on the wave function distributions and molecular configurations of their frontier orbitals, while it can obviously down-shift the HOMO energy level.
To study the photovoltaic performance of the polymers, conventional photovoltaic devices with the structure indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/J101(or J71):ZITI (or ITIC)/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al(100 nm) were fabricated. Detailed photovoltaic performance is shown in Fig. S6–S8 for the PSCs based on J101:ITIC, in Fig. S9–S11 for the PSCs based on J101:ZITI and in Fig. S12 for the PSCs based on J71:ZITI, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing PSCs are plotted in Fig. 2a. As presented in Table 1, the PSCs based on the J101:ITIC (1:1, w/w) film give the best PCE of 12.47%, with a Voc of 0.951 V, a Jsc of 17.69 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.65%, which is higher than the reported PCE value (11.40%) of the J71:ITIC-based PSCs. Meanwhile, the optimized J101:ZITI device shows slightly lower Voc (0.937 V) and FF (72.48%) values, but presents a significantly higher Jsc of 21.25 mA cm−2 compared to the J101:ITIC solar cells, and thus results in an increased PCE of 14.43%. The higher Jsc is attributed to the increased absorption of the ZITI acceptor in the long wavelength region. Besides, the photovoltaic performance of the J71:ZITI solar cells was also investigated for comparison (see Table 1). The average PCE value of the J71:ZITI devices is 12.82%, with a Voc of 0.912 V, a Jsc of 20.23 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.49%, approaching that of the optimized devices with an average PCE of 13.04% as reported by Prof. Zhu' group. Importantly, the introduction of chlorine atoms to replace the fluorine atoms in the BTz unit can simultaneously improve Voc, Jsc and FF values, and thus achieve one of the highest PCE values for single junction PSCs reported in the literature. As exhibited in Fig. 2b, J101:ZITI devices show the highest response with a maximum value of 81.28% in the EQE curve, which is slightly higher than that of the J71:ZITI device (79.22%), implying the efficient photoelectron conversion. The calculated Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves match well with those obtained from the J–V measurements within 5% mismatch.

To verify the reliability, statistical photovoltaic metrics and PCE histogram were obtained from J71:ZITI and J101:ZITI PSCs as presented in Fig. 2c. In addition, since light and accumulated heat from illumination are inherently unavoidable in the working solar cells, the thermal stability of photovoltaic materials is of special importance. Here we further investigated the thermal stability of the J71- and J101-based devices by thermal treatment at 80 °C for 196 hours (Fig. 2d). It can be found that the thermal stability of the J101-based devices is slightly better than that of the J71-based devices. Besides, Fig. 2e shows the plots of the PCE versus years for the reported efficient BTz-based PSCs (see Table S9 in the ESI), including BTz-based polymer:PCBM solar cells, Jseries polymers:ITICs solar cells and BTz-based non-fullerene solar cells. In addition, Fig. 2f exhibits the plots of the PCE versus energy loss (Eloss) distribution in various fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs (see Table S10 in the ESI). The J101:ZITI PSC shows a relatively smaller Eloss of 0.593 eV compared with the J71:ZITI PSC (0.618 eV), while indicates a better trade-off between the PCE and Eloss in the J101:ZITI PSCs. Overall, these promising photovoltaic data shed light on the correlation between molecular structures and photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs.
Hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the optimized J71:ZITI blend films estimated using the space charge-limited current method (SCLC, Fig. S14 and S15) are 3.55 × 10−4 and 4.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively,while μh and μe of the optimized J101:ZITI films are calculated to be 2.18 × 10−4 and 1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh/μe ratios are 7.85 for the J71:ZITI blends and 1.72 for the J101:ZITI blends, respectively. The photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurement was also carried out to investigate the carrier mobility in the optimal devices. As shown in Fig. S16, although charge extraction (characterized by the maximum charge extraction current, tmax) occurs faster for the J71:ZITI optimized device than the J101:ZITI optimized device, the average mobility of J101:ZITI (2.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is still higher than that of J71:ZITI (2.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, the J101:ZITI device shows a higher charge-carrier density than the J71:ZITI device. Thus, the relatively high and balanced carrier mobilities in the J101:ZITI devices can reduce recombination and improve carrier collection, which are responsible for the higher Jsc and FF values in PSCs.
The high Jsc and FF are generally correlated with decreased charge recombination. Thus, we further measured the light-intensity (Plight) dependence of Voc and Jsc. In principle, the Plight dependence of Jsc follows the relationship Jsc ∝ Plightα, when α value equals to 1, suggesting that free-charge carriers can be efficiently swept out and collected at electrodes without bimolecular recombination. In Fig. 3a, the α values are 1.02 for the J71:ZITI device and 1.00 for the J101:ZITI device, respectively. The similar fitted α values suggest that bimolecular recombination is efficiently suppressed in both active layers, which results in the high Jsc and FF values for these two systems. In addition, the light intensity dependence of Voc data is fitted to the linear law: Voc ∝ nkT/qlnPlight (Fig. 3b), where T, q, and k are the temperature in Kelvin, the elementary charge, and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. The slopes for J71:ZITI and J101:ZITI devices are 1.32kT/q and 1.29kT/q, respectively, indicating that both the devices show small trap-assisted recombination losses.
Detailed information about the charge extraction process in the optimized devices based on J71:ZITI and J101:ZITI was probed by using transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3c, the charge extraction time is 0.55 μs for the J71:ZITI blend and 0.41 μs for the J101:ZITI blend, respectively. The reduced charge extraction time in the J101:ZITI device suggests more efficient charge extraction from the BHJ blends. In addition, combining the transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction (CE) techniques, we can determine the non-geminate recombination order R (R = λ + 1), which can be calculated via the equation τ = τ0(n0/n)λ, where τ0 and n0 are constants and λ is the so-called recombination exponent. Fig. 3d exhibits the charge carrier lifetimes measured by TPV (calculated from Fig. S17) as a function of the charge carrier density obtained from CE measurements (calculated from Fig. S18). A lower recombination order value (R = 2.14) for the J101:ZITI device can be directly correlated to the spatial uniform charge carrier distributions through the active layer, and strongly indicates the reduced recombination losses as compared to the J71:ZITI device (R = 2.47). The charge recombination can be influenced by the blend morphology, which will be discussed in detail later.
To further investigate the effect of different blend morphologies on the photovoltaic performance and physical dynamics in both systems, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) have been carried out. Both J71 and J101 based blend films exhibit a smooth surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.92 and 1.69 nm, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). Moreover, Fig. 4c and d show the TEM images of the J71:ZITI and J101:ZITI optimized blends. It can be found that the J101:ZITI blend forms defined phase separation with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network, which is beneficial to suppress the exciton recombination and improve the charge separation and transport properties as discussed above. The molecular orientations were studied by the two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS measurements. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, compared with the neat films (Fig. S19), these blends remain in the preferred face-on orientation, evidenced by the appearance of an obvious (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction, responsible for the charge transport of the PSCs. The (010) peaks are located at q ≈ 1.70 A−1 for the J71:ZITI blend film and 1.68 A−1 for the J101:ZITI blend film, respectively, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.69 and 3.74 Å. The lamellar crystal coherence length (CCL) in the (100) direction estimated by using the Scherrer equation was 60.28 Å for J71:ZITI and 94.28 Å for J101:ZITI, respectively. The longer CCL in the J101:ZITI blend indicates stronger crystallinity, contributing to reduce the probability of carrier recombination and yield a higher FF than the J71:ZITI devices.
The high photovoltaic performance of J101:ZITI opaque solar cells further drives us to fabricate semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J101:ZITI/PDINO/Ag (x nm). To determine the trade-off between transparency and efficiency, ST-OSCs with Ag thicknesses of x = 8, 10 and 15 nm were fabricated. The J–V, transmission and EQE spectral characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 5a, b and S20, and the related data are listed in Table 2. The average visible transmittance (AVT) of the devices, which is calculated from the simple arithmetic mean of the transmittances from 400 to 650 nm, varied from 21.69% to 26.11%, with 15 nm ≥ x ≥ 8 nm. For x = 10 nm, the ST-OSC showed a PCE of 9.04%, and for x = 15 nm, the optimized device exhibited an excellent PCE of up to 11.04% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a high Jsc of 19.06 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.51%, and the device exhibits an AVT of ≈21.69%. Fig. 5c shows a photograph of a ST-OSC covered with a 15 nm thick Ag layer. Moreover, Fig. 5d exhibits the plot of the PCE versus AVT of some representative single-junction ST-OSCs reported in the literature and this work (see Table S11 in the ESI), which illustrates that the achieved PCE is a new record for ST-OSCs reported in the literature. These results not only demonstrate excellent visible light transparency of the J101:ZITI semitransparent devices, but also can facilitate the development of building-integrated organic photovoltaics.

In summary, a new wide-bandgap chlorinated polymer, J101, was synthesized and successfully used as the donor polymer for application in non-fullerene PSCs. Its synthetic route is simple, and the raw materials are much cheaper than the fluorine-substituted analog J71. Moreover, the J101 film shows a higher oscillator strength, a slightly higher absorption coefficient and a lower HOMO energy level compared to its counterpart J71. Importantly, the optimized conventional single-junction PSC based on J101:ZITI achieved an impressive PCE of 14.43%, with a Voc of 0.937 V, a Jsc of 21.25 mA cm−2, and a decent FF of 72.48%, which is the highest efficiency reported in the literature to date for BTz-containing polymer-based PSCs. Theoretical calculations and material physical properties revealed that the substitution of chlorine atoms in the BTz unit instead of fluorine atoms has a significant impact on intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, which affect various solid-state properties. Based on the light intensity dependence analysis of J–V characteristics as well as SCLC, photo-CELIV, TPV and CE measurements, the J101:ZITI device shows efficient and balanced charge transport properties as well as low recombination losses. The morphological characterization illustrates that the J101:ZITI blend exhibits more suitable phase separation, while those in the J71:ZITI blend in contrast are unobvious. Importantly, the design strategy in this study realized a fine balance between the energy loss and photovoltaic performance. Besides, we also fabricated a ST-OSC based on the J101:ZITI active layer, which showed a PCE of up to 11.04% with an AVT of 21.69%. Overall, the utility of heteroatom engineering is of crucial importance to elucidate structure–morphology–property relationships. Insight into such a relationship will be beneficial for the judicious choice of new materials with appropriate heteroatoms for use in organic photovoltaics.
