Semi-transparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs) have attracted great attention recently because of their potential for application in smart windows, etc. Here, we fabricated ST-PSCs based on a low band-gap conjugated polymer, PTB7-Th, as the donor and a narrow band-gap n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS), ITVfIC, as the acceptor. The active layer (with a thickness of 100 nm) of the ST-PSC exhibits a high average transmittance (AT) of 73.46% in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm. The as-cast ST-PSC with 15 nm Ag as the cathode without any additive or thermal-annealing treatment shows a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.21% with an AT of 33.7%, which is one of the highest values for ST-PSCs without extra treatment. In addition, the ST-PSCs show good thermal stability with 91% of their original PCE value retained after high temperature treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours. The higher PCE and good stability indicate that the ST-PSC has potential for practical application and the narrow bandgap ITVfIC could be a promising n-OS acceptor for the fabrication of ST-PSCs.

In recent decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to their advantages of low cost, light weight, and easy to realize large-scale production. Until now, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have reached 11–13% (ref. 7–12), benefitting from the development of high performance conjugated polymer donor and n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptor materials. In the development of new n-OS acceptors, narrow bandgap acceptors with the absorption edge red-shifted to over 900 nm have attracted interest for enlarging the light harvesting range to achieve higher Jsc. For example, Zhu et al. synthesized two n-OS acceptors, ATT-1 and ATT-2, which possess a low bandgap of 1.52 eV and 1.32 eV, respectively, and the Jsc of the ATT-2-based PSC reached 20.75 mA cm−2. Our group also developed several acceptor materials including SJ-IC, ITVfIC, ITVffIC and ITVIC with the absorption edge red-shifted to 900–950 nm, and the Jsc of the ITVffIC-based PSC can reach 22.83 mA cm−2.

Inspired by the near infrared (NIR) absorption of the narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors, high performance semi-transparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs) were fabricated with a narrow bandgap polymer as the donor and a NIR absorbing n-OS as the acceptor. The ST-PSCs are appealing for applications in many areas, such as building windows, roofs and cars shelters, and even in wearable electronics and future solar-powered automobiles. Apart from these wide application prospects, ST-PSCs also have some advantages owing to their transparent top electrodes which could result in higher power generation efficiency because of their capabilities of receiving incident light from both sides.
Though tremendous attention has been paid to PSCs since 1995, ST-PSCs were not realized until 2006 when the devices with thin Au film electrodes (≈12 nm) were first reported by Yang's group. But the first ST-PSCs showed quite low PCEs of 0.85% and 0.52% under the light illumination of AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) from the ITO and Au electrode sides, respectively. Very recently, the PCE of ST-PSCs has been improved to 10% by Zhan's group. However, the progress made in this specific area still lags far behind that of normal opaque PSCs. Moreover, the high photovoltaic performance of the present ST-PSCs has usually been obtained by extra treatments that involve the use of additives, high temperature thermal annealing and/or solvent annealing to optimize the morphology of the active layer. However, not only is the use of toxic additives detrimental to the environment, but also the residual additive in the device can induce undesirable morphological changes and can sometimes even accelerate photo-oxidation degradation of the blend active layers. In addition, high temperature annealing is also not compatible with the simple, low-cost, industrial scale production through roll-to-roll technology and unfavourable for energy saving. Therefore, it's necessary to develop new high performance ST-PSCs without extra treatments that involve additives and annealing processes.
For the fabrication of ST-PSCs, the biggest challenge in designing materials and devices is to make better use of the NIR solar radiation with less absorbance in the 400–600 nm region, which is most sensitive to human vision. Considering the narrow bandgap PTB7-Th polymer donor with weak absorption in the wavelength range of 400–550 nm and the NIR absorption characteristic of our n-OS ITVfIC acceptor (see Fig. 1a and b), we fabricated the ST-PSCs based on PTB7-Th: ITVfIC with a transparent thin Ag layer as the top cathode. The ST-PSCs without treatments that involve additives and thermal annealing demonstrated a higher PCE up to 8.21% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.54 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a fill factor (FF) of 63%, and an average transmittance (AT) of 33.71% between 400 and 600 nm. This is one of the highest PCEs reported so far for ST-PSCs without extra treatments that involve additives and thermal annealing.


Fig. 1b shows the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectra of PTB7-Th and ITVfIC thin films. The n-OS acceptor ITVfIC film displays an absorption peak at 772 nm with a maximum molar extinction coefficient of 1.02 × 105 cm−1, a shoulder absorption peak at 700 nm and an absorption edge at 900 nm which corresponds to a narrow bandgap of 1.37 eV. This NIR absorption character makes ITVfIC suitable for fabricating ST-PSCs. For polymer donor PTB7-Th, the absorption peak is at 690 nm. The blend film of PTB7-Th:ITVfIC displays a strong complementary absorption between 600 and 900 nm (Fig. S1 in the ESI), which is the maximum photon flux density region in the solar spectrum and is beneficial for improving Jsc of PSCs.

For the choice of donor and acceptor materials, besides the complementary and NIR absorption, efficient charge separation at their interface and their matchable energy levels are also very important. As shown in Fig. 1c, the HOMO energy levels of PTB7-Th and ITVfIC are −5.20 and −5.56 eV, respectively, and the LUMO energy levels of PTB7-Th and ITVfIC are −3.59 and −4.01 eV, respectively. Their ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO are 0.36 and 0.42 eV, which are sufficient for exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the donor and acceptor materials.
For studying the photo-induced charge transfer behavior, a photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI. For the blend film, 99% of the PL emission of PTB7-Th (excited at 690 nm) was quenched by ITVfIC, but for the emission of ITVfIC (excited at 770 nm), only 73% was quenched by PTB7-Th. From this result, we can conclude that PTB7-Th could be mixed very well with ITVfIC, every exciton generated in PTB7-Th can transfer an electron to ITVfIC and then the PL is quenched. As for ITVfIC, because of its strong crystallization behavior, there exist some larger degrees of aggregation in the blend film with aggregation size larger than the maximum diffusion length of the exciton, which could cause the lower degree of PL quenching.

The ST-PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PTB7-Th:ITVfIC/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Ag (15 nm), where PDINO was used as the cathode interface to effectively alleviate the interfacial energy barriers. And the device fabrication conditions, including the donor:acceptor weight ratio, concentration of the blend solution, spin coating speed and thickness of the Ag cathode, were optimized. We also fabricated the corresponding opaque PSCs with an Ag cathode thickness of 100 nm for comparison.


Fig. 2a shows the typical J–V characteristics of the optimized ST-PSC based on PTB7-Th:ITVfIC (1:2, w/w) with a 15 nm Ag cathode and the opaque PSC with a 100 nm Ag cathode under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm2. And the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices are listed in Table 1 for a clear comparison. Compared with a PCE of 7.14% (with a Voc of 0.733 V, Jsc of 15.44 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.63) for the ST-PSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 and a PCE of 5.87% (with a Voc of 0.731 V, Jsc of 12.57 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.63) for the ST-PSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1:3, the ST-PSCs with a D/A weight ratio of 1:2 demonstrated a higher PCE of 8.21% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 17.54 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63% at 33.71% AT between 400 and 600 nm. When we increased the thickness of the Ag cathode to 100 nm, the PCE of the opaque PSC reached 9.09%, while the PCE of the PSC with a 100 nm Al cathode was found to be 9.21% (Table S1 in the ESI), which illustrates that Ag can be used as a cathode to replace the Al cathode in the PSCs with PDINO as the cathode buffer layer. Comparing the photovoltaic parameters of the ST-PSCs and the opaque PSCs with the Ag cathode, we found that the lower PCE of the ST-PSCs mainly arises from the decreased Jsc value, due to the penetrating absorption in the visible region, the reduced reflection on the cathode, and the slightly lower FF which might be ascribed to the inadequate electrical conductivity of the thinner Ag cathode of the ST-PSCs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the ST-PSCs with the 15 nm Ag cathode and the opaque PSCs with the 100 nm Ag cathode are shown in Fig. 2b. It can be seen that the EQE value at 470 nm is as high as that at 650 nm in the opaque PSCs, while the absorption of the blend film is low (see Fig. S1 in the ESI), indicating that photons absorbed at 470 nm have been mostly converted into electrons and holes. In addition, the EQE values are almost the same for the ST-PSCs and the opaque PSCs in the longer wavelength range from 600 nm to 800 nm, while the EQE values of the ST-PSCs in the shorter wavelength range from 350 nm to 580 nm are significantly lower than those of the opaque PSCs. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the high reflection of the 15 nm Ag electrode in the longer wavelength range with good transparency in the shorter wavelength range, which is beneficial to the semitransparency of the ST-PSCs in the visible region. The integrated current density values from the EQE curves with the simulated AM1.5G light are 16.83 mA cm−2 for the ST-PSC and 18.08 mA cm−2 for the opaque PSC, which are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves within 5% mismatch.
We also did comparison experiments to investigate the influence of additive and thermal annealing on the device performance. As shown in Table S1 in the ESI, the PCE decreased from 8.21% to 6.75% and the FF decreased from 63.11% to 53.46% when 1% (volume ratio) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was used as the additive, while the PCE (8.07%) and FF (61.65%) of the ST-PSC after thermal annealing at 160 °C for 2 min (ref. 17) were nearly the same as those of the one without the thermal annealing treatment. The results can be explained by TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI, there was almost no morphological difference between the as-cast film and the thermally annealed film. But the phase size became bigger for the active layer with the CN additive treatment, which is harmful to the FF and Jsc values of the ST-PSCs. This result indicates that the optimal PCE of the ST-PSCs can be obtained without extra treatments that involve additives or thermal annealing.
To investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties of the ST-PSCs and the opaque normal PSCs, we measured the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices, as shown in Fig. 2c. Here the Jph is the result of JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The term Veff is defined by V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and V is the applied voltage. It can be seen that Jph reaches saturation when Veff is higher than 2 V, which indicates that all the photo-generated excitons dissociated into free charge carriers and were collected by the electrodes and the charge recombination is minimized at the higher voltage. The Jph/Jsat ratio shows positive correlation with the charge dissociation probability (P(E,T)), where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density. The Jph/Jsat ratio for the ST-PSCs and opaque normal PSCs is calculated to be 0.912 and 0.979 under short-circuit conditions. This result indicates that the ST-PSCs indeed have a lower exciton dissociation rate and a less efficient charge collection because of the decreased thickness of the Ag cathode.
Furthermore, in order to understand the charge recombination behavior of the PSCs, we measured the relationship between the short-circuit current density and the light intensity (P), as displayed at Fig. 2d. The relationship between Jsc and light intensity should follow the formula Jsc ∝ Pα; if all the free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes with negligible bimolecular recombination, the value of α would be 1. In our experiment, with the same experimental conditions, the α values of the ST-PSCs and opaque normal PSCs are estimated to be 0.973 and 0.983 under short-circuit conditions, respectively, indicating efficient exciton dissociation and negligible bimolecular recombination in both the ST-PSCs and the opaque PSCs.
The effect of the Ag cathode thickness on the photovoltaic performance and on the transparency of the ST-PSCs was studied by depositing Ag cathodes with different thicknesses of 10 nm, 15 nm and 20 nm. Fig. 3(a–c) show the J–V curves, EQE curves and transmission spectra of the optimized device with different thicknesses of the Ag cathode. The transmittance spectra of the Ag film electrodes with thicknesses of 10 nm, 15 nm and 20 nm are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI. When the thickness of Ag is 15 nm, the device exhibits a PCE of 8.21% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 26.40% between 370 and 740 nm and an average transmittance (AT) of 33.71% between 400 and 600 nm, which is the wavelength region most sensitive to human vision. This relatively high transmittance ensures considerable transparency in the region where the human eye is most sensitive. Upon decreasing the thickness of Ag to 10 nm, the AVT increased to 34.98% and the AT increased to 44.98%, but the PCE of the device decreased to 7.05% because of the sharp decrease of Jsc and FF. When the thickness of Ag was increased to 20 nm, the PCE increased from 8.21% to 8.55%, but the AVT decreased to 18.20% and the AT dropped to 22.74%, which is too small to call the device a ST-PSC. Therefore, the thickness of 15 nm is the optimal choice for the ST-PSCs.
The transparency of the active layer on the ITO anode and the PDINO/Ag cathode was measured separately to understand the contribution of the device components to the transparency of the ST-PSCs. Fig. S5 in the ESI shows the visible transmission spectra of the Ag layer, the active layer with the ITO electrode and the ST-PSC. The AVT of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (100 nm) and Ag layer (15 nm) is 58.6% and 40.5%, respectively. Obviously, the AVT of the Ag cathode plays an important role in the transparency of the whole ST-PSC device. The AVT values of the Ag layer with thicknesses of 10 nm, 15 nm and 20 nm are 46.0%, 40.5% and 30.1%, respectively (Table S2 in the ESI). The relatively low AVT of the Ag cathode results in a lower AVT of the ST-PSC. If we can obtain a new highly transparent and highly conductive cathode or high photonic crystal reflector, the performance, especially the AVT of the ST-PSCs, could be further improved.

Fig. 3d shows colorful pictures of the ICCAS background covered with ITO glass (Fig. 3d(1)), glass/ITO/active layer (100 nm) (Fig. 3d(2)), ITO glass/Ag (15 nm) (Fig. 3d(3)), and the ST-PSC (Fig. 3d(4)). Although the AVT of the ST-PSC (26.4%) is relatively low, we can still see the characters of the picture clearly and the color distortion is small. Fig. S6 in the ESI shows the color coordinate of the ST-PSC on The Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 xyY chromaticity diagram. The ST-PSC device exhibits a CIE color coordinate of (0.29, 0.36) and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7422 K. The coordinate on the CIE chromaticity diagram is marked in the blue area, which suggests that the device is beneficial for application in windows because its color coincides with the color of the blue sky, as shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI.

The thermal stability of the PSCs was studied by thermal treatment at 200 °C. We found that the photovoltaic performance of the devices is only slightly decreased after the thermal treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours, as shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI and in Table 1. After the 2 hour high temperature treatment, the ST-PSCs still showed a relatively high PCE of 7.46% with a Voc of 0.734 V, a Jsc of 17.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58.97%. The PCE of 7.46% is 91% of the initial PCE value (8.21%) before the high temperature treatment. The PCE of the opaque PSC after the high temperature treatment decreased only slightly from 9.09% to 8.82%.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance and thermal stability of the ST-PSCs, the active layer morphologies of the PSCs were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 4. The AFM image shows a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.91 nm for the as-cast blend film. After high temperature thermal treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours, the roughness of the blend film increased slightly to 0.925 nm. The corresponding TEM images (Fig. 4b and d) show that the thermal treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours leads to slightly enlarged phase separation, which is in agreement with the morphologies observed in the AFM images. This almost unchanged morphology after high temperature thermal treatment further confirms the good thermal stability of the ST-PSCs.
To further evaluate the photovoltaic performance and the thermal stability of the device, we measured the hole and electron mobilities using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device configurations of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:ITVfIC/PDINO/Al for electron and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:ITVfIC/Au for hole transport measurements. The measurement results are shown in Fig. S9 and S10 in the ESI. The hole mobility and electron mobility values of the as-cast PTB7-Th:ITVfIC film were calculated to be 4.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively with μh/μe of 0.99, which could account for the high FF and PCE of the ST-PSC. After thermal treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours, the hole and electron mobilities were 2.97 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively with μh/μe of 0.71, which is only slightly lower than that of the as-cast blend film and can partly explain the thermal stability of the ST-PSC.

In summary, by using a low-bandgap polymer, PTB7-Th, as the donor and a narrow bandgap n-OS, ITVfIC, as the acceptor, we fabricated ST-PSCs with 15 nm Ag as the top cathode. The ST-PSC based on PTB7-Th:ITVfIC (1:2, w/w) without extra treatments that involve additives and thermal or solvent annealing shows a higher PCE of 8.21% with an AVT of 26.40% between 370 and 740 nm, and an AT of 33.71% between 400 and 600 nm. The PCE of 8.21% is one of the highest values reported so far for as-cast ST-PSCs. The thermal stability of the ST-PSCs was studied by high temperature treatment at 200 °C for 2 hours. After the high temperature treatment, the PCE of the ST-PSC dropped slightly to 7.41% which is 91% of its original value, indicating good thermal stability of the ST-PSCs. The higher PCE and good stability indicate that the ST-PSC has potential for practical application and the narrow bandgap ITVfIC could be a promising n-OS acceptor for the fabrication of ST-PSCs.
