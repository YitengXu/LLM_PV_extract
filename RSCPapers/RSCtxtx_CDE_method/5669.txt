A novel double layered photoanode consisting of oriented hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays (HNW) and nanoparticles (NP) has been successfully fabricated on a Ti-foil substrate via a two-step hydrothermal and screen-printing process, respectively. Compared to a NP based cell, the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 HNW cell highlights several outstanding properties, including superior light scattering, rapid electron transport and lower electron recombination rate. Furthermore, the effect of the TiO2 NP film thickness (top layer) on the power conversion of the DSSCs has been investigated in detail. The DSSC based on a Ti/TiO2 HNW + NP photoelectrode with a total thickness of 31 μm (HNW: 13 μm; NP: 18 μm) shows the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.92%, which is remarkably higher than those of 13 μm HNW (4.52%), 18 μm NP (6.50%) and 31 μm NP (5.99%) photoelectrodes. The enhancement of the efficiency for the double layered photoanode based cell compared to the single NP is mainly attributed to better light scattering capability, faster electron transport and lower electron recombination for the former.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the excessive exhaustion of fossil fuels and rising global energy demand have driven the development of new types of renewable and sustainable alternatives. Compared with traditional petrochemical energy, such as coal, fuel, natural gas, etc., solar energy can be utilized in a cost-effective, eco-friendly way. During the past decade, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has drawn intense attention since it is low cost, renewable, carbon-free, and clean.

The photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of DSSC has reached more than 12% based on a TiO2 nanoparticles electrode, zinc porphyrin dye and Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl) based redox electrolyte. However, the TiO2 nanoparticle based photoelectrode is one of the main factors to limit the predicted high efficiency (31%) because of its large amount of grain boundaries (more electron recombination losses) and poor utilization of near infrared light. Though one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured photoelectrodes (e.g. nanorod, nanowire, nanotube) have been regarded as a promising candidate due to their fast electron transport, slow recombination and excellent light scattering ability, the smaller surface area ascribed to the large diameter and free space between the neighboring 1D structures leads to less amount of the dye molecule loading on the photoelectrode, which limits the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC. Up to now, relatively higher conversion efficiencies were achieved by using rigid fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, however, their applications would be limited due to the material’s fragility and inflexibility. Grätzel and co-workers have reported the highest conversion efficiency (7.2%) of flexible DSSCs using TiO2 nanoparticles based on a Ti foil substrate in 2006. Recently, a TiO2 nanotube array/Ti electrode prepared through anodization of Ti foil has shown a significant power conversion efficiency of 7.75%, which is the highest one for a 1D nanostructure/Ti substrate electrode. And Lin et al. have reported a TiO2 nanoparticle/nanotube bilayer structure on FTO substrates with an overall conversion efficiency of 7%. Compared with single 1D nanostructures, hierarchical 1D nanostructures consisting of long nanowires, nanorods or nanotube trunks and short nanorods (or nanoparticles) would probably improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs because of the advantages of more dye loading, superior light scattering ability and efficient electron transport rate. However, to date, fewer studies can be found in the literature for hierarchical nanoarray structures on flexible Ti foil substrates which is very important for efficient flexible DSSCs.
Based on our previous successful preparation of TiO2 HNW, the present paper is going to design a new double layer structured photoelectrode consisting of hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays (down layer) and nanoparticles (top layer), which combine the advantages of hierarchical nanowires (fast electron transport, slow electron recombination and excellent light scattering ability) and nanoparticles (large amount of dye adsorption). As a result, the DSSC based on a TiO2 HNW + NP double layered photoelectrode and a Pt/FTO glass counter electrode shows an efficiency of 7.92% which is much higher than of the TiO2 NP photoelectrode (5.99%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time there has been a report on such a kind of double-layered photoanode with hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays and nanoparticles on a Ti foil substrate, and the conversion efficiency (7.92%) is the highest for DSSCs based on a Ti foil substrate.

The hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays (HNWs) and 20 nm anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared according to our previous report. Briefly, TiO2 HNWs have been prepared via a two-step hydrothermal treatment, (1) titanium foil firstly underwent a hydrothermal reaction in 50 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 30 mL 1 M NaOH aqueous solution and was maintained at 220 °C for 24 h, (2) the as-prepared TiO2/Ti foil went through an ion exchange process and heat treatment in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 3 h, and then the second hydrothermal reaction was performed with 0.05 M K2TiO·C4O8, 20 mL H2O and 20 mL diethylene glycol (DEG) at 150 °C for 6 h, which led to the formation of TiO2 HNW consisting of long nanowire trunks and short nanorod branches. Nano-sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs, 20 nm) were also prepared through a hydrothermal treatment with a precursor solution containing 10 mL Ti(OBu)4, 20 mL ethanol, 18 mL acetic acid and 50 mL deionized water. The synthesized NPs powder was mixed with ethanol, acetic acid, terpineol, ethyl cellulose and vigorously stirred to form a viscous paste. The TiO2 NP paste was then coated onto the surface of the as-prepared HNW/Ti foil substrate via screen-printing. The thickness of the TiO2 NP layer can be easily controlled via different times of screen-printing. For comparison, TiO2 NPs/Ti foil films with similar thicknesses were also prepared via the screen printing method. The TiO2 films were gradually heated through a procedure of heating at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min in order to remove the organic substances. Then the TiO2 films were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C. After sintering at 520 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 electrode films were immersed into N719 dye solution (0.5 mM N719 in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butylalcohol, 1:1 volume ratio), and sensitized for about 16 h at room temperature. The active area of the TiO2 photoelectrode film was approximately 0.16 cm2, which was measured by a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).


The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode on the Ti foil substrate and Pt coated FTO glasses were assembled into a sandwich type cell. Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by thermal deposition of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 min. Electrodeposited PEDOT on an ITO-PET substrate is also used as counter electrode to assemble fully flexible dye-sensitized solar cells. PEDOT/ITO-PET films were synthesized as in the method reported in the literature. I−/I3− based liquid electrolyte containing 0.03 M I2, 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15), was injected into the interspace between the photoanode and counter electrode.


Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F) was used to characterize the thickness and the cross-sectional microstructures of the TiO2 films. The diffuse reflectance spectra and adsorption spectra of the desorbed-dye solution (dye-adsorbed TiO2 film was immersed into 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution) were measured on a UV/Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3150) to evaluate the reflectance performance and the dye amount of the TiO2 films. The current–voltage characteristics (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η)) and voltage decay of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). A 1000 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel, Model: 6271) served as a light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer at a bias potential of −780 mV in the dark with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were also carried out on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated green light emitting diode (457 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211), which can provide both dc and ac components of the illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1 kHz to 0.1 Hz.


The TiO2 HNW array prepared through the present two-step hydrothermal process has the length (or thickness) of 13 μm. To evaluate the superior optoelectric properties of HNW, DSSCs based on photoelectrodes of TiO2 HNW array or nanoparticles of 13 μm in thickness were firstly fabricated. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the TiO2 HNW/Ti based DSSC displays a lower short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) but higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) compared to that of the NP/Ti-based DSSC. The Jsc greatly enhanced from 7.47 mA cm−2 for the HNW cell to 10.48 mA cm−2 for the NP cell which is probably attributed to the larger surface area adsorbing more dye molecules for the latter (HNW: 132.9 vs. NP: 166.9 nmol cm−2). The DSSC based on the HNW/Ti photoelectrode has higher FF and Voc compared to the NP/Ti photoelectrode, which could be attributed to a smaller sheet resistance at the HNW/substrate interface, and higher electron lifetime, respectively. Finally, the power conversion efficiency of the HNW/Ti based DSSC (4.52%) is worse than that of the NP/Ti based DSSC (5.69%). It is mainly because of the smaller Jsc originating from less dye adsorption.

The time constants of electron transport (IMPS) and electron lifetime (IMVS) as a function of light intensity for the two DSSCs are shown in Fig. S1. Clearly, the electron transport time of the HNW cell is shorter than that of the NP cell, showing a faster electron transport rate in the HNW cell (Fig. S1). And the electron lifetime (obtained from IMVS measurement, Fig. S1) of the NP cell is shorter than that of the HNW cell, coupled by a decreased open-circuit voltage for the former. It's well known that there would be a mass of trap/detrap events in nanocrystalline films resulting in a more abundant electron back reaction with I3− in the electrolyte. Fig. S2 represents the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) of the two cells as a function of light intensity, which was obtained by using the analytical expression Dn = d2/(4τd),d is the film thickness and τd is the electron transport time (from the IMPS measurement). The Dn of the DSSC based on TiO2 HNW is much larger than that of the NP cell. This significant improvement of electron transport can be related to the direct and fast electron transport pathway in the HNW photoanode.
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2 HNW and NP films were measured to investigate the light scattering ability of the two materials. As shown in Fig. S3, the reflectance of the TiO2 HNW array film is much higher than that of the TiO2 NP film in the range of 400–800 nm. The increase of light scattering capabilities within the film would maximize the use of solar light and enhance the light harvesting efficiency and photocurrent of the cell.
Although TiO2 HNW arrays have shown many promising advantages such as superior light scattering ability, faster electron transport rate and longer electron lifetime, the lower dye adsorption leads to lower photovoltaic performance. For better balancing the functions of dye adsorption, light scattering and electron transport or lifetime, a novel double photo anode containing a HNW layer and NP layer were designed to improve the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. For the sake of optimizing the film thickness, TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) layers with four different thicknesses (6, 12, 18 and 24 μm) have been screen-printed on the surface of the TiO2 HNW/Ti film. As an example, Fig. 2a is the cross-sectional SEM image of the double-layered photoelectrode with TiO2 HNW arrays and NP on a Ti-foil substrate, which shows that the TiO2 NP was completely adhered to the top surface of the HNW arrays and the length of the TiO2 HNW arrays and thickness of NP film are 13 μm and 18 μm, respectively. Fig. 3 is the schematic illustration of the three kinds of photoelectrode structures (hierarcical TiO2 HNW, TiO2 NP, double layered TiO2 HNW + NP) for the present DSSCs study.
To evaluate the effects of the thicknesses of TiO2 NP on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, four kinds of double layered photoanode: A (TiO2 HNW + 6 μm NP); B (TiO2 HNW + 12 μm NP); C (TiO2 HNW + 18 μm NP) and D (TiO2 HNW + 24 μm NP) were assembled into a sandwich type cell together with a Pt coated counter electrode of FTO glass. Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the double layered structured DSSCs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the cells are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, the Jsc varies from 12.24 mA cm−2 to 14.02 mA cm−2, as the TiO2 NP film thickness increases from 6 to 18 μm, which could be attributed to the larger amount of dye molecules on the photoelectrode with the thicker film which can excite more photogenerated electrons and thus lead to higher photocurrent. Moreover, thicker films with stronger light-scattering effects would also improve the light-harvesting efficiency resulting in a higher Jsc, which was confirmed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Fig. 5 shows the reflectance of the double-layered TiO2 HNW + NP/Ti film enhanced along with the increasing film thickness in the light wavelength range of 400–800 nm. Furthermore, the reflectances of the double-layered TiO2 HNW + NP/Ti films are higher than those of the single TiO2 NP film or single TiO2 HNW film in the visible region (see Fig. S3 and Fig. 5), revealing the improvement of light scattering capabilities for such a kind of double layered photoanode. In spite of higher dye amounts and superior light scattering ability for the cell D (TiO2 HNW + 24 μm NP) compared to the cell C (TiO2 HNW + 18 μm NP), the Jsc shows a slight decrease from 14.02 to 13.60 mA cm−2, which can be attributed to the larger amount of defects and recombination centers for a thicker film. The open-circuit voltage decreases gradually with the increasing film thickness due to the augmentation of the surface area, which provides additional charge-recombination sites for higher recombination rates within the films (see the following discussion of EIS, IMPS and IMVS measurement). As a result, the power conversion efficiencies of double layer structured solar cells with TiO2 NP film thickness of 6, 12, 18, and 24 μm were 6.98%, 7.54%, 7.92% and 7.33%, respectively.
Electrochemical impedence spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the influences of the film thickness on the photovoltaic performance of the four DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 6, two semicircles were achieved in the Nyquist plots. The larger semicircle in the frequencies of 103–10 Hz corresponds to the recombination resistance (R2) and chemical capacitance (C2) across the TiO2/redox electrolyte interface, and the small semicircle in the frequency range of 1 K–1 MHz fits to a charge-transfer resistance (R1) and the capacitance (C1) should be ascribed to the process at the interface of the redox electrolyte/Pt counter electrode. DSSCs based on different film thickness of photoanodes display similar R1 due to the use of the same counter electrode (Pt/FTO glass) and electrolyte. However, the electron lifetime value (τr) fitted by using Z-view software decreases with the increasing film thickness of the photoanodes (Table 1), which implies smaller Voc for thicker films. This result is in good agreement with the J–V data.
The electron transport and charge recombination of the DSSCs based on four kinds of films were further characterized by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), which were conducted under illumination of a LED light source (λ = 457 nm) with different light intensities from 30 to 150 W m−2. Fig. 7 shows the electron transport time (τd = 1/2πfd; fd is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS imaginary component) and the electron lifetime (τr = 1/2πfr; fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component) as a function of light intensity. Under various light intensities, longer electron transport times (slower transport rates) and shorter electron lifetimes (larger recombination rates) were obtained for increasing thickness of TiO2 NP, indicating more traps and recombination centers in the thicker films lead to serious recombination of the DSSC. The decreasing electron lifetime correlates with the lower Voc (Table 1).
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was further employed to investigate the electron recombination process in the DSSCs based on double layered TiO2 photoanodes with different NP thickness.Fig. 8 shows the plots of Voc decay rate as a function of time under the open-circuit conditions. It is evident that the increasing thickness of TiO2 NP leads to higher recombination kinetics which means a shorter electron lifetime for the DSSCs. The plot shows cell D has the fastest voltage decay rate among the four DSSCs indicating the largest recombination rate within it. This result is in agreement with the EIS, IMPS and IMVS studies shown above. Based on the dye amounts, light scattering ability, electron transport and recombination, the DSSC with an optimum film thickness of TiO2 HNW + 18 μm NP/Ti achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (7.92%) with a Jsc of 14.02 mA cm−2; Voc of 762 mV and FF of 0.74 under simulated AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination.
Moreover, the DSSCs based on a TiO2 HNW + NP double layer photoelectrode (C: TiO2 HNW 13 μm + NP 18 μm) show a remarkable enhancement of the photovoltaic performance compared to the TiO2 NP photoelectrode (E: 31 μm TiO2 NP) based cell (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The IMPS/IMVS, OCVD and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the two cells (C and E) are shown in Fig. S4–S6, respectively. The highly improved Jsc and Voc of the cell C can be mainly attributed to the superior light scattering capability, faster electron transport and slower electron recombination. These results could also be explained by the following factors. Firstly, the HNW arrays of the double layered photoelectrode (C) can utilize the light in a multi-reflection mode and thus enhance the light harvesting efficiency when the incident light moves through TiO2 NP to HNW. Secondly, the HNW arrays have long vertical nanowire trunks providing a direct conduction pathway for rapid electron transport and smaller electron recombination, hence resulting in excellent charge collection efficiency, which can be proved by the IMPS, IMVS and OCVD measurements (Fig. S4 and S5). Last but not least, the HNW arrays were fabricated via an in situ hydrothermal process, therefore, the HNW + NP/Ti photoanode has a lower electrical resistance at the interface of the TiO2 film and Ti foil substrate, which is also conducive to electron transport within the DSSCs.
Flexible DSSCs have currently attracted intense attention because of their light-weight, low cost roll-to-roll production and potential applications in powering mobile electronic products. Recently, Jennifer et al. reported an electrodeposited PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode which shows a comparable catalytic activity to the Pt coated FTO glass counter electrode. Here, in our present work, the double layered photoanode with TiO2 HNW (13 μm) and NP (18 μm) based on a Ti substrate is used as a photoelectrode and electrodeposited PEDOT on an ITO-PET substrate is used as counter electrode to assemble a fully flexible DSSC. Fig. 9 displays the J–V curve and the photovoltaic parameters which show that the fully flexible DSSC has achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 6.71% accompanying a Jsc of 12.54 mA cm−2, a Voc of 782 mV and a FF of 0.69. Compared with the rigid Pt/FTO cell, the decreased Jsc and FF for the fully flexible DSSC can be attributed to the larger sheet resistance and interface resistances of the counter electrode/electrolyte, and the poor electric conductivity of the PEDOT catalyst at the PEDOT/ITO-PET plastic counter electrode.

In summary, a novel double-layered photoanode based on oriented hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays and nanoparticles on a Ti-foil substrate was designed for efficient DSSCs. The detailed study of the photoelectrodes with TiO2 HNW (13 μm) and different thickness (6–24 μm) of the NP layer shows the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs is strongly dependent on the electron transport, recombination, light scattering ability and dye adsorption. The DSSC based on the TiO2 HNW (13 μm) + NP (18 μm) photoelectrode showcases the best power conversion efficiency of 7.92%, which is much higher than that of TiO2 NP (5.99%) with the same thickness (31 μm). The remarkable enhancement of the photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the faster electron transport, lower electron recombination and superior light scattering ability, which is confirmed by the IMPS, IMVS, EIS and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy characterizations. Furthermore, an overall power conversion efficiency of 6.71% was achieved with the fully flexible DSSC based on the double layer photoelectrode and electrodeposited PEDOT/ITO-PET plastic counter electrode, which shows a promising perspective for its commercial application in the near future.
