To explore enhancing photocurrent in organic solar cells (OSCs) via harvesting triplet excitons, two novel bicycloiridium complexes (R1 and R2) are designed and synthesized. Conventional bulk-heterojunction triplet OSCs are solution processed using R1 or R2 as sole electron donors and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor. A decent short circuit current (Jsc) of 6.5 mA cm−2 is achieved though the overlap between the absorption spectrum (with ∼550 nm absorption onset) of R2 and the solar flux is relatively small. With an open circuit voltage of 0.74 V and a fill factor of 0.42, an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 2.0% is achieved in the OSCs based on R2 and PC71BM without any processing additives and post-treatments. Our preliminary result demonstrates the possibility of utilizing Ir complexes as sole electron donors in OSCs, which extends available soluble small molecules for OSCs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained increasing interest in both academia and industry due to their promising potential to provide green and low-cost electricity. Efficiencies approaching 10% have been reported in both polymer- and small-molecule-based OSCs. Photon absorption in organic materials produces strongly bound excitons (electron–hole pairs). As a result, the concept of bulk heterojunction (BHJ), where electron donor and electron acceptor materials are intimately mixed together, has been at the heart of the operation of OSCs. At present, singlet excitons play a dominating role in high photovoltaic performance achievement, although triplet excitons work well in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Fortunately, the investigation on the utilization of triplet excitons in OSCs is gathering momentum. Owing to strong spin–orbital coupling of heavy-metal ions in phosphorescent complexes, singlet excitons can be converted into triplet excitons through intersystem crossing (ISC). Yang and co-workers pioneered the employment of triplet excitons in OSCs. They fabricated bilayer structure OSCs composed of evaporated 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphineplatinum(II) (PtOEP) and C60, and obtained a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.1%. Other groups also have done much valuable work on bilayer OSCs based on triplet materials. However, the evaporation process is not compatible with low-cost large-scale production. In addition, the bilayer structure limits the full potential of the device performance. Therefore, it is desirable to synthesize solution-processed metal complexes and apply them in BHJ OSCs.

Most previous reports on solution-processed triplet-based OSCs proposed to dope or bond metal complexes into polymer donors, aiming to harvest triplet excitons. However, Lee et al. recently demonstrated that the rate and probability of electron transfer from the metal complexes to phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were much higher than those of triplet–triplet energy transfer between metal complexes and polymer donors. On one hand, this work indicated that simple blending of polymer donors with a metal complex does not ensure a triplet effect in OSCs. On the other hand, this work confirmed an effective photovoltaic process between metal complexes and PC61BM, and hence it is promising to only employ metal complexes as donors in BHJ OSCs. However, metal complexes are rarely used as the donor materials in solution-processed OSCs, partially due to their low carrier mobility, poor light absorption and film-forming ability. A PCE of 0.8% was reported by using cruciform-shaped oligo(phenylenevinylene) with a rhenium(I) chromophore as the donor in BHJ OSCs. As the most popular phosphorescent materials in OLEDs, cyclometalated (C⁁N) iridium(III) complexes may be potential candidates as sole donors in BHJ OSCs.
In this article, we synthesized two novel iridium (Ir) complexes, bis(5-4′-methoxybenzene-2-(2′-benzo[4,5-α]thienyl)pyridinato-N,C3′)iridium(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione) (R1) and bis(5-4′-triphenylamine-2-(2′-benzo[4,5-α]thienyl)pyridinato-N,C3′)iridium(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione) (R2). R1 and R2 are derivatives of a red light-emission Ir complex, bis(2-(2′-benzothienyl)-pyridinato-N,C3′)iridium(acetylacetonate) [(btp)2Ir(acac)]. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione, p-methoxybenzene and triphenylamine are introduced into the ligand of R1 and R2, for achieving better film-forming ability, higher carrier mobility and broader absorption. A PCE of 2.0% was obtained in the solution processed OSCs by using R2 as the sole donor without processing additives and any post-treatments.


1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 400 (Varian in American) in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K. Elemental analysis was performed on a Flash EA1112 Elemental Analysis Instrument (Elementar Co.). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co. in Japan). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out by using a CHI610A electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Co. in China) with glass-carbon electrodes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 against a calomel reference electrode with an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutyl-ammonium perchlorate (TBAP)–acetonitrile (CH3CN). The deposition of small molecules on the electrode was carried out by the evaporation of a dilute chloroform solution. Field effect transistor (FET) measurements were performed under high vacuum conditions with a parameter analyzer using prefabricated bottom contact/bottom gate substrates with photolithographically patterned gold electrodes and a 100 nm thick SiO2 insulator. The hole mobility of the Ir complexes in BHJ blends was also measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole only devices were fabricated in a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/R1 or R2:PC71BM (1:2)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). Photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra were obtained with an Andor spectrometer (Shamrock sr-303i-B, coupled to a Newton EMCCD detector) and both pure Ir complex and blend based devices connected to an external current/voltage source for the measurements of EL. PL lifetimes of excitons were measured with an Edinburgh FL-920 spectrometer under 405 nm excitation of a PMM-208G-VT laser. A green CW AGLM2 532 nm laser with an intensity of 5 mW cm−2 was used as the pumping light source for the absolute PL measurements. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed directly on these films, with a Dimension 3100 system (Digital Instruments/Veeco) by using antimony (n) doped silicon cantilevers (SCM-PIT, Veeco) in tapping mode.


All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Alfa Aesar and were used as received. All solvents were carefully dried and purified under a nitrogen flow.

The mixture was first kept in an argon atmosphere and was refluxed with vigorous stirring for 24 h. The reaction solution was poured into water, extracted with dichloromethane and saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Then sodium sulfate was filtered, and the solvent was removed.

Bis(5-4′-triphenylamine-2-(2′-benzo[4,5-α]thienyl)pyridinato-N,C3′)iridium (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione) (R2) was synthesized by the following procedure: under an N2 atmosphere, 15 mg Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 was added to N,N-diphenyl-4-phenylamine stannane (134 mg, 0.25 mmol) and R0 (95.3 mg, 0.1 mmol) in toluene. The mixture was refluxed for 24 h, cooled to room temperature, poured into water, and then extracted with dichloromethane.

The OSCs were fabricated using a device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO covered glass substrates were cleaned using detergent and acetone prior to TL-1 (a mixture of water, ammonia (25%), and hydrogen peroxide (28%) (5:1:1 by volume)) treatment. PEDOT:PSS (40 nm) was spin-cast onto the cleaned substrate and heated for 30 minutes at 120 °C. Then, the substrates were transferred into a glove box filled with N2. The active layers were spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions on top of the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO glass substrates. The substrates were moved into a vacuum chamber where 0.6 nm LiF and 100 nm Al were thermally evaporated at a pressure less than 4 × 10−4 Pa. The active areas of all OSCs are roughly 4.5 mm2 defined by the overlap between two electrodes, which were measured by optical microscopy. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under illumination of AM 1.5 filtered light, with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (solar simulator Model SS-50A, Photo Emission Tech., Inc.). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a Newport Merlin lock-in with the solar cells illuminated with chopped monochromatic light through the ITO side.


Because (btp)2Ir(acac) presents poor miscibility with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to form the homogeneous BHJ, chemical modification must be made on it to obtain the required Ir complexes used in the solution processed BHJ OSCs. The synthetic routes of the complexes are depicted in Scheme 1. R0 was coupled with 4-methoxybenzeneboronic acid by Suzuki reaction to acquire R1, with a moderate yield of 34%. R2 was achieved through coupling R0 with N,N-diphenyl-4-phenylamine stannane by the Stille reaction. The 1H-NMR analysis indicated that the target complexes were obtained. Both R1 and R2 have good solubility in organic solvents and good miscibility with PC71BM.

To estimate the energy levels of R1 and R2, CV measurements were performed (Fig. S1). The onsets of the irreversible oxidation wave (Eox) of R1 and R2 are 0.65 eV and 0.70 eV, respectively. Based on the empirical formula [EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) (eV)], the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of R1 and R2 are determined to be −5.05 and −5.10 eV. The HOMO levels of bicycloiridium complexes are determined by the 5d orbital of Ir with substantial mixing with the p orbitals of the ligand. Therefore, it is reasonable that HOMO levels of R1 and R2 are very close to that of (btp)2Ir(acac) (−5.10 eV). The LUMO level of R2 was estimated to be −3.50 eV from the onset reduction potential according to an empirical formula [ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) (eV)]. We were not able to record n-doping processes of R1. Since the LUMO levels in metal complexes are related to the p* orbitals of the ligand, the LUMO levels of R1 and R2 are supposed to be C⁁N ligand dependent. The LUMO level of (btp)2Ir(acac) is −3.20 eV. Considering a relative delocalization degree of the C⁁N ligand of R1, R2 and (btp)2Ir(acac), the LUMO level of R1 may be between −3.50 eV and −3.20 eV.
Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of R1 and R2 and their blends with PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1. For R1, the absorption peak at ∼370 nm can be assigned to the spin-allowed singlet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (1MLCT) transition. And the absorption peak at ∼500 nm results from the triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) transition of the complexes. The absorption spectrum of R2 presents a peak of 1MLCT at around 380 nm and a peak of 3MLCT at around 510 nm. Compared with solutions, a slight red shift and broadening of the absorption spectra can be found in the solid states. In the blend films, there is some overlap between the absorption peaks of the Ir complexes and that of PC71BM.
The hole mobilities of pure R1 and R2 are measured using the FET structure. The hole mobilities of R1 and R2 are determined to be ∼3 × 10−6 and ∼3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The configuration we used for measurements was the bottom contact/bottom gate, which usually introduces large contact resistance, and hence underestimates the real mobility to some extent. The FET measurement focused on pure donors along the film surface, which is slightly different from the real condition in the OSCs. So the hole mobility of the Ir complexes in BHJ blends was also measured by the SCLC method with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/R1 or R2:PC71BM (1:2)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). By fitting the dark J–V curves based on the Mott–Gurney law:

here,
εr ≈ 3 is the average dielectric constant of the blended film, ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, μ is the carrier mobility, L ≈ 50 nm is the thickness of the film and V is the applied voltage. The J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices are shown in Fig. S2. The hole mobilities of R1 and R2 are estimated to be 2.0 × 10−6 and 4.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 , respectively, by the SCLC measurement. As we expect, with triphenylamine in the C⁁N ligands, R2 presents one order of magnitude higher hole mobility than R1.

Solution-processed OSCs based on Ir complexes and PC71BM were fabricated with the conventional configuration, i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The weight ratio between the Ir complex and PC71BM was varied from 1:1.5, 1:2 to 1:2.5, and DCB was used as the solvent. J–V characteristics under AM 1.5 and in the dark are shown in Fig. 2a and S3. The rectification ratios around 103 are shown in the dark J–V curves of the OSCs at ±1.2 V, indicating no obvious leakage current in the devices. Photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs based on the R1 and R2 blend with three ratios of PC71BM are summarized in Table 1. The standard deviation of the PCE is less than 5% based on eight devices. For R1:PC71BM devices, a PCE of 1.2% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.30 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.77 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.35 is obtained with a weight ratio of 1:2.5 between R1 and PC71BM. For R2 devices, the PCE increases to 2.0% mainly resulting from the increase of Jsc (from 4.30 to 6.52 mA cm−2) and FF (from 0.35 to 0.42). We attribute the improved efficiency of the R2:PC71BM device to the improved light absorption and charge transport, as demonstrated by the absorption and mobility measurements. Generally, the hole mobility of the donor in the active layer is a main limiting factor for most OSCs. Therefore, enhanced mobility of R2 over R1 will improve the balance between the hole and electron transport, which is favorable for free charge collection. As a result, both Jsc and FF of the R2:PC71BM device are improved compared with those of the R1:PC71BM device. We understand that the FF of 0.42 in the R2:PC71BM device is still lower than those of highly efficient polymer solar cells. This is reasonable considering that the hole mobility of pure R2 is in the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is lower than those of the efficient polymer donors. In addition, the existence of the discontinuing pathways in the amorphous small molecular donors might also hamper the charge carrier transport, affecting the FF. The EQEs of the OSCs were measured under illumination of monochromatic light (Fig. 2b). For both devices based on R1:PC71BM and R2:PC71BM with a weight ratio of 1:2, broad photo responses cover 300 nm to 700 nm. Consistent with the difference in Jsc, the EQE of the R2:PC71BM device is much higher than that of the R1:PC71BM device. This indicates that the ligands of the Ir complexes play an important role in their photovoltaic properties. By wisely designing the molecule structure, both light absorption and carrier mobility can be further improved.

Steady state and time-resolved PL measurements demonstrate that long-range dipole–dipole interaction is mainly responsible for electron transfer from triplet excitons of the donor to the singlet state of the acceptor. PL spectra of the pure R1 and R2 in the solid state are compared with their corresponding R1/R2:PC71BM blends with a weight ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 3a). All of the films were spin-coated on cleaned glass substrates, and the excitation wavelength was 405 nm. Organometallic compounds with transition metal centers show a fast ISC from the singlet state S1 to the lowest triplet state T1. Thus the T1 → S0 rate becomes relatively large to present efficient phosphorescence. The peaks of phosphorescent emission at 663 nm and 673 nm are observed in the PL spectra of pure R1 and R2, respectively. Compared with (btp)2Ir(acac), 50–60 nm red-shifts are due to the increased conjugated length of the C⁁N ligands, which also leads to an extension of the absorption towards longer wavelength. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL spectra of the blends exhibit emission bands around 1000 nm, which could not be found either in the emission spectra of pure Ir complexes or in the emission spectrum of pure PC71BM (725 nm). Therefore, this emission at around 1000 nm should be assigned to the interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states formed between complexes and PC71BM. Many reports proposed that, before photoexcited excitons separated into free charges, there was an intermediate CT state involved in the exciton dissociation process, which assisted in the formation of free charge carriers. The CT state is a ground state, and is generated by the interaction between the donor and the acceptor. In order to show the CT emission clearly, the PL counts in R1/R2:PC71BM blends are multiplied by 5. Completed PL quenching of pure R1 and R2 suggests that almost all donor excitons reach the donor/acceptor interfaces of the BHJ within their lifetimes.
Since the CT emission intensities are generally much weaker than the T1–S0 transitions in Ir complexes and S1–S0 transitions in PC71BM, EL measurements are an easy and efficient way to detect the CT state and to determine the CT state energy. EL measurements are performed on the OSCs based on pure Ir complexes and their blends. The same injection current was used to perform all the EL measurements, and the normalized EL spectra are plotted in Fig. 3b. Similar to the PL emission, the EL emission at around 1000 nm (1.2 eV) in the blend is attributed to the recombination of CT states. In the OSCs, the driving force for charge transfer is equal to the difference between the energy of the excited donor (ED*) and the energy of CT states (ECT). The driving force ED*–ECT estimated by the gap between the EL peaks of the donor and the CT state is around 0.60 eV (ED*–ECT) for both devices based on R1 and R2. This demonstrates that the triplet levels of R1 and R2 are much higher than the levels of CT states in the blend, which confirms the effective utilization of triplet excitons in the photovoltaic process (Fig. 3b). The driving force around 0.60 eV is beneficial to dissociate triplet excitons with high binding energy. In addition, it is obvious that the EL emission from the pure Ir complex around 660 nm is completely suppressed in the blend, which implies a good phase separation in the blends and a large D/A interfacial area. Without strong polar substituents in the ligands, R1 and R2 have a good miscibility with low polar PC71BM, which is confirmed by the AFM images (Fig. 4), in which the 1:2 blends processed from DCB show uniform films with the root mean square roughness of 0.3–0.4 nm.
Lifetime (τ), diffusion lengths (Ld) and bonding energy are the key factors for the exciton dissociation and diffusion in the photovoltaic process. Compared with singlet excitons, triplet excitons have wider ranges of τ (from hundreds of microseconds to dozens of nanoseconds) and Ld (from micron to nanometer) in various complexes at different states. Triplet excitons' τ of Ir complexes are within the range of hundreds of nanoseconds to several microseconds. The probability of the excitons reaching the donor/acceptor interfaces is proportional to τ through the formula:  where D is a diffusion constant. Therefore, it is expected that more excitons reach the donor/acceptor interfaces with longer τ. Many factors may affect the triplet exciton lifetime of phosphorescent dyes, such as the metal of the core, structure of the ligands and the distance between cores. Triplet–triplet annihilation can decrease the excitons' lifetime distinctly. Exciton–exciton annihilation occurs when two excitons meet and form a single higher excited state, thus leading to the loss of an exciton. The probability of exciton–exciton annihilation depends on the concentration of excitons. At high concentrations, excitons meet more frequently, leading to faster decays. The PL decays of R1 and R2 in chloroform (CF) solutions with two different concentrations (3 × 10−5 mol L−1 and 3 × 10−4 mol L−1) and their films from CF solution were recorded and are shown in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the samples of R1 and R2 have the same trends, that is, the longest τ (229 ns and 275 ns) presented in the lower concentration solutions (3 × 10−5 mol L−1) and the shortest τ (108 ns and 122 ns) shown in the solid films. The decay characteristics of these samples are mono-exponential with τ from 100 ns to 300 ns (Table 2). The coefficients of determination χ2 around 1.0 ensure the reliability of the resulting lifetimes. Since the large size of triphenylamine results in a long distance between the cores, τ of R2 is a little longer than that of R1. The τ of concentrated solutions is shorter than that of the diluted solution, and τ of the films is shorter than those of the solutions due to the enhanced exciton–exciton annihilation. The τ of 100 ns may not be long enough if D of these Ir complexes is not very high. A moderate PCE of 2.0% is reasonable considering the narrow absorption spectrum and low hole mobility of R2. Furthermore, there is huge pace in molecule design for phosphorescent dyes to possess longer diffusion exciton length, higher hole mobility and broader absorption. So our work will cast light on highly efficient solution processed BHJ OSCs based on triplet donors. However, the rate of ISC and electron transfer in the triplet OSCs needs to be studied by ultrafast spectroscope furthermore.

Two Ir complexes are designed and synthesized to explore enhancing photocurrent in OSCs via harvesting triplet excitons. With a Jsc of 6.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.74 V and a FF of 0.42, an overall PCE of 2.0% is obtained in the conventional OSC structure taking the Ir complexes as sole electron donors and PC71BM as the electron acceptor. Our results demonstrate the possibility of using phosphorescent dyes as sole electron donors in solution processed OSCs, which not only enrich donor materials of OSCs by extending to phosphorescent dyes, but also provides an important guide for designing new metal complexes with low band gaps, desired HOMO and LUMO levels as well as molecular packing for enhancing the absorption or Jsc and FF for triplet OSCs.
