Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have a promising future in reliable energy harvesting to drive low power consumption devices for indoor applications. In this article, the outdoor (1 sun) and indoor (2700 K LED) performance of an inverted OPV, PTB7-Th:PC70BM, with three different solution-processed electron transport layers (ETLs = PFN, TiOx, and ZnO) was compared. The morphological, optical, and electrical measurements indicated the strong dependency of the OPV performance on the illumination conditions. The sample with PFN-ETL showed the highest outdoor performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.55% and the best reported fill factor (FF) of 75.00% among the PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based OPVs; surprisingly, it exhibited the lowest performance when illuminated under 250–2000 lux 2700 K LED light. Meanwhile, the lowest outdoor performance was demonstrated by ZnO with a PCE of 10.03%; it displayed the best indoor performance with a PCE of 13.94% under 1000 lux LED light and a PCE of up to 16.49% under 1750 lux LED light. The changes in the FF values could be estimated by incorporating the parasitic resistance effect due to the type of ETL used. Additionally, using impedance spectroscopy, we observed that the indoor performance agreed well with the trend of the charge collection efficiency.

The potential application of photovoltaics (PVs) for indoor energy harvesting has attracted considerable attention, providing off-grid energy sources for tens of billion low power consumption devices used for the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT enables communication system between wireless electronic devices, such as sensors, displays, and actuators, through the internet; these devices are essential to lead the future generation of smart buildings, factories, and retail sectors. These low power consumption devices are usually operated in an indoor environment, in which the light intensity ranges from 0.5 to 1 mW cm−2 for a well-lit room. Therefore, a self-sustainable power source that operates with high power densities and high efficiency is required.

PV cells offer great promise to efficiently convert low light levels under indoor light conditions due to their high output voltage and good spectral response in the visible region. The emission spectra of common indoor light sources, such as incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), range from 400 to 800 nm, which are narrower than the spectral irradiance of an AM 1.5G light source with the range from 400 to 2000 nm. In consequence, PV cells developed for outdoor applications, such as crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, show high power conversion efficiency (PCE) under 1 sun but show low PCE under indoor illumination due to their mismatched spectrum ranges and decreased photovoltage. Unlike the c-Si solar cells, several emerging photovoltaic technologies, including organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, dye-sensitized cells and perovskite solar cells, show remarkable performance under room lighting illumination due to their highly tunable light-absorption photoactive material properties (∼390–760 nm) and well-matched spectral responses in the visible light region; thus, they are efficient energy sources for low-power indoor applications. OPV cells are taking more steps toward the commercialization of indoor PVs than their dye-sensitized and perovskite counterparts due to their low cost, light weight, and large-area modules fabricated by solution-based technologies.
Recent studies of OPV devices under different incident light illumination conditions and different indoor artificial light sources have been reported. Mori et al. found that the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based devices (8.43%) is lower than the PCE of c-Si solar cells (13.49%) under 1 sun; however, when illuminated under LED light at 890 lux (0.4 mW cm−2), their PCE of 11.63% is higher than that of c-Si solar cells (9.65%). Using the same photoactive materials, Cutting et al. achieved a PCE of up to 21.04% under 20.5 mW cm−2 of LED illumination. On the other hand, Aoki and Minnaert et al. studied the performance of OPVs for indoor applications under artificial light sources: fluorescent light, sodium lamp, metal halide lamp, cool LED light, and warm LED light. They suggested that it is unnecessary to test the devices under all artificial light sources to demonstrate their potential indoor application. Depending on the active material, a good match of the absorbance spectrum of the OPV device with the emission spectrum of the light is important to characterize the suitability of an OPV for indoor energy harvesting. The following characteristics are required to obtain efficient indoor PV devices: (i) well-matched photoresponse spectrum with indoor light and high external quantum efficiency (EQE), (ii) suppressed trap-mediated recombination and (iii) high open-circuit voltage (VOC).
Several strategies to improve OPV performance under indoor light illumination have been investigated by several research groups. Lee et al. optimized the photoactive layer BTR:PC71BM and improved its PCE to over 28% under fluorescent lamps using the solvent vapor annealing technique. Another group, Cui et al., used a material design engineering approach to synthesize photoactive materials whose absorption spectra match those of indoor light sources; the devices fabricated from those materials showed low energy loss, resulting in a high VOC of 1.10 V and a high PCE of 26.1% under LED illumination. Yin et al. and Nam et al. adopted ternary blend approaches to improve the overall performance of OPVs by enhancing their carrier mobilities to improve the fill factor (FF), complementing the optical absorption to escalate the short circuit current density (JSC) and matching the energy levels of the photoactive materials to enlarge the VOC. Interface engineering is another strategy employed respectively by Goo et al. and Shin et al. to improve the shunt resistance and reduce the work function of ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) modified with zinc oxide nanoparticles ((ZnO NPs)/PEIE) as an electron transport layer (ETL).
In this work, we employ the cathode interface engineering approach to improve the indoor performance of PTB7-Th:PC70BM inverted OPV cells using three different commonly used ETL materials, i.e., poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), titanium sub-oxide (TiOx), and zinc oxide (ZnO). These ETL materials were chosen due to their reported success under 1 sun to reduce the electron extraction barrier from the active layer to the cathode and to modify the surface of ITO. However, their performance under indoor illumination has not been studied in depth. Here, using atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, J–V characteristic measurements, and impedance spectroscopy, we found that by expediently optimizing the materials and deposition condition of the ETLs, the performance of OPV cells can be enhanced under both outdoor and indoor illumination. However, the cells show opposing performance under different lighting conditions. A PCE of up to 16.49% under LED illumination at 250–2000 lux, together with an attractive PCE of up to 10.55% under 1 sun illumination, is presented. The effects of the choice of ETL on the device performance agree well with the parasitic resistance effect, the charge recombination, and the trend of the charge collection efficiency.


Fig. 1(a) shows the chemical structures of the donor polymer PTB7-Th and the fullerene acceptor PC70BM. The polymer donor PTB7-Th was chosen due to its high VOC (∼0.8 V). The binary bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM solar cells were fabricated using an inverted structure of ITO/ETL/PTB7-Th:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). An inverted structure device was used because this is a preferred architecture for indoor performance; also, it provides vertical phase separation and a concentration gradient in the active layer. A PFN layer, TiOx layer, or ZnO layer was used as the ETL. Fig. 1(c) displays the energy level diagram of each material in the inverted OPV (iOPV). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the donor PTB7-Th are −5.22 and −3.63 eV, while the HOMO and LUMO of the acceptor PC70BM are −6.10 and −4.30 eV, respectively. A large energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor is needed to obtain a high VOC. A higher VOC under 1 sun illumination is more favorable for the indoor light application of iOPVs due to the extra voltage loss when the light intensity is reduced. A minimum LUMOdonor − LUMOacceptor difference of around 0.3 eV is preferred to ensure efficient electron separation of excitons at the donor–acceptor interfaces.

The evolution of the surface morphologies of the three different ETLs on the glass/substrate was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Fig. 2(a)–(d) display the surface topologies of the bare ITO and ITO modified with the three different ETLs. The root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness values estimated from the AFM height profiles in an area of 5 μm × 5 μm were 3.67 nm (bare ITO), 2.52 nm (ITO/PFN), 2.50 nm (ITO/TiOx), and 2.47 nm (ITO/ZnO). The bare ITO showed the highest RMS values, while smooth surfaces were observed for the ITO modified by ETLs. However, the latter samples showed no significant differences in their RMS roughness. The smooth surfaces observed for all the ETLs-modified ITO samples are believed to aid the formation of the photoactive layer, leading to effective electron collection. The optical effect is another essential factor for effective ETL. Fig. 2(e) shows the optical transmittance spectra of the different ETLs, measured with a UV-vis spectrometer. In the spectral range of around 400–500 nm, all the samples, including the reference ITO, had transmittances above 75%. Therefore, the ZnO-based ETL, which had the highest transmittance, would be preferable as a highly transparent cathode that can allow the maximum photon flux to reach the active layer and generate photocurrents.


Fig. 3(a) shows the best current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PTB7-Th:PC70BM iOPV with PFN, TiOx, or ZnO film as ETL under 1 sun simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5G solar irradiation). The detailed photovoltaic parameters, such as short circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), FF, power conversion efficiency (PCE), and both series and shunt resistances (RS and RSh), measured under AM 1.5G illumination are summarized in Table 1. For reliable data and reasonable comparison, the average and standard deviation values were measured from more than 12 devices. It can be seen that the device performance was improved by using PFN as the ETL. All of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM cells with different ETLs show the same high VOC values (0.79 V) due to the deep HOMO energy level of the donor PTB7-Th (5.22 eV). This indicates that the VOC values do not depend on the choice of ETL material. The VOC value is proportional to the difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels of the active layer materials. It is also shown that both types of devices have outstanding FFs (>70%), as high VOC values lead to high FF values. It is worth mentioning that the highest FF of 75.00% obtained by PFN-ETL is the best reported value for a PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based organic photovoltaic device (see Table S1). The device with ZnO as an ETL exhibits a JSC of 16.63 mA cm−2, FF of 72.85%, and VOC of 0.79 V, resulting in an average PCE of 9.57 ± 0.29% (with a maximum of 10.03%). With the TiOx as an ETL, the JSC increases to 17.06 mA cm−2, FF decreases slightly to 72.03%, and VOC remains at 0.79 V, leading to an average PCE of 9.71 ± 0.24% (maximum PCE of 10.20%). By replacing ZnO and TiOx with PFN, the device performance was improved, affording the highest PCE of 10.55% and the highest FF of 75.00% (with an average PCE value of 10.04 ± 0.31%, JSC of 17 mA cm−2, and VOC of 0.79 V). In the outdoor conditions, the device performance (JSC, FF, and PCE) under 1 sun illumination could be improved by using PFN as the ETL; meanwhile, the VOC values were similar, indicating that the PCE was mostly determined by the photon absorption yield. This result is in good agreement with the result obtained by He et al. using PFN as the ETL in a PTB7:PC71BM BHJ system. In addition, the calculated values of RS and RSh from Fig. 3(a) at open-circuit and short-circuit voltages, respectively, exhibit similar values for all devices. A slightly higher RS value for the device with the TiOx ETL was observed. Meanwhile, the highest RSh value belongs to the PFN-based device. In general, the values of RS and RSh for the three types of devices are lower than 3 Ω cm2 and around or more than 1 kΩ cm2, respectively; these are preferable values to operate in both indoor and outdoor illumination.

Fig. 3(b) depicts the J–V characteristics of the devices based on PFN, TiOx, and ZnO ETLs measured in the dark, which gives a better understanding of the performance of the devices (leakage current, ideality factor, series and shunt resistances) under low light conditions. Table S2 summarizes the extracted device performance parameters from the J–V dark curves. At reverse and low forward voltages (V < 0.2 V), the J–V characteristics were mainly determined by RSh, which is correlated with the leakage current of the devices. The value of RSh for the PFN-ETL device is one order of magnitude lower than the RSh values of the TiOx- and ZnO-ETL devices. As a result, the PFN-based device has the highest leakage current. Hence, a high leakage current can dominate the photocurrent when the incident light intensity is low. Although the PFN ETL has the highest leakage current, the three types of devices show leakage currents below 10−3 mA cm−2; this is still suitable for devices operating under typical indoor illumination, as reported by Lee et al. In addition, the fitting from the dark J–V model (Fig. S1(a) and Table S2) shows that the three ETLs have an exponential region (0.65 < V (V) < 0.85) with ideality factors in the range of 1.1–1.2, which implies almost ideal recombination processes. Finally, at high forward voltages, the sample with TiOx-ETL shows higher series resistance. Fig. S1(b) shows the experimental and fitting values for the ZnO-ETL device. To fit the medium forward voltage biases (0.2 < V (V) < 0.65), a second exponential region with an ideality factor close to 2 can be defined. This is typical for trap-assisted recombination processes.

Fig. 3(c) displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the iOPV cells with different ETL materials. All of the devices display photoresponse spectra in the range of 300 to 800 nm, which matches well with the absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:PC70BM and AM 1.5G solar irradiation (Fig. S2). The devices based on the PFN, TiOx, and ZnO ETLs show photoresponses with maximum EQE values of 68%, 64%, and 59% at the wavelengths of 485, 510, and 515 nm, respectively. Table 1 also shows that the calculated JSC values of the devices based on the PFN, TiOx, and ZnO ETLs obtained by integrating the EQE spectra in Fig. 3(c) with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum are 16.00, 15.86, and 15.43 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the measured values of the J–V characteristics with a maximum error of less than 8%.

Fig. S2 also presents the normalized absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:PC70BM along with 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in comparison with the illumination spectrum of the 2700 K LED light source in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. With the optical band gap of 1.37 eV, their optical response nicely covers the entire LED emission range, which may be better suited for indoor application. Fig. 4 displays the J–V characteristics for the best-performing devices with the different ETLs under 1000 lux LED illumination (measured light power irradiance: 0.415 mW cm−2). In this work, the devices were investigated under a 2700 K LED lamp with a luminance range of 250–2000 lux; this corresponds to the intensity of indoor lighting sources, which is typically in the range of <1 mW cm−2. LED light was employed due to its low power consumption as a versatile light source; it is expected to become widespread for residential and office use. Moreover, LED light offers a deduction of up to 58.4% of the Shockley–Queisser limit on photovoltaic performance.

We tested the best devices with each ETL under 1 sun conditions to determine their indoor performance under a 2700 K LED lamp. Table 2 shows that unlike the outdoor performance, the ZnO-based device exhibits the best performance among the three ETLs under the luminance of 1000 lux LED light, with a PCE of 13.94%, a JSC of 133.31 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.66 V, an FF of 65.83%, an RS of 1.94 Ω cm2, and an RSh of 40.94 kΩ cm2. The TiOx-based iOPV shows slightly decreased indoor performance, with a PCE of 13.83%, a JSC of 122.10 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.66 V, a FF of 71.21%, an RS of 3.31 Ω cm2, and an RSh of 63.21 kΩ cm2. Unexpectedly, the PFN-based device, which showed the highest performance under outdoor illumination, exhibited the lowest performance under indoor illumination, with a PCE of 11.40%, a JSC of 107.00 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.66 V, a FF of 67.13%, an RS of 1.85 Ω cm2 and an RSh of 158 kΩ cm2. The detailed indoor performance of all devices with different lux intensities ranging from 250 to 2000 lux is summarized in Table S3. For the indoor illumination conditions given, it can be observed that all of the devices possess varying values of VOC, JSC, FF, RS, and RSh for different ETLs used, indicating that the indoor performance shows a dependency on the choice of ETL.

Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the power-law dependence of the JSC and VOC values on the incident light intensity (Plight), which can give information on recombination within the devices. As displayed in Fig. 5(a), the value of JSC is proportional to the light intensity according to the relationship JSC ∝ PlightS1, where S1 is the determined exponential factor. The fitted S1 values for the PFN-, TiOx-, and ZnO-based devices were 0.95, 0.94, and 0.92, respectively, under solar irradiation at strong light intensities (>10 mW cm−2), and these values increased up to unity when exposed to LED light at weak light intensities (<1 mW cm−2). The S1 values close to unity (i.e., S1 ≈ 1) for the devices illuminated under both indoor and 1 sun conditions suggest low levels of non-geminate charge recombination and limited space charge effects due to the low photogenerated carrier density in these OPVs under LED and 1 sun lighting conditions. In other words, it can be inferred that the ratio of photons to electrons remained constant with decreasing light intensity. It is worth noting that the ZnO-based device under indoor performance showed the highest JSC due to the higher transmission of the ZnO ETL in the LED spectral wavelength, which allows the active layer to absorb the maximum photon flux of LED emission and generate more photocurrent. This result is in good agreement with the transmission spectral analysis (vide supra) and its high output power density (Pout) of 57.85 μW cm−2.
The VOC is a key parameter to gain more insight into the recombination kinetics. Fig. 5(b) shows the logarithmic dependence of the VOC values upon the light intensity for illumination under 1 sun and LED light, which can be expressed using the equation derived from the Shockley diode equation below:
(1)
where
n is the recombination ideality factor of the diode (n = S2/S1), kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the cell temperature, and q is the electron charge. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the obtained S2 values of 1.12, 1.00, and 1.09 lead to obtained n values of 1.18, 1.05, and 1.18 for devices with PFN, TiOx, and ZnO under 1 sun illumination (>10 mW cm−2), respectively. These values are close to 1 and similar to the values obtained from the dark fitting model (see Table S2), indicating that these devices may act as ideal diodes under 1 sun due to the absence of trap-assisted recombination. Additionally, the S2 values of 1.99, 1.44, and 1.55 lead to n values of 1.83, 1.40, and 1.49 for the PFN-, TiOx-, and ZnO-based devices under indoor illumination (<1 mW cm−2), respectively. These fitted slopes under indoor illumination are higher than those under 1 sun illumination, indicating the enhanced trap-assisted recombination under indoor light intensity. This trend is coherent with the presence of the second exponential region at medium-dark bias, as stated before. Thus, the photovoltage loss of ∼0.2 V is observed due to the significantly reduced light intensity and enhanced trap-mediated charge recombination.

The results obtained from the VOCvs. light intensity corroborate the dark J–V experiment and modeling results (Fig. 3(b), S1 and Table S2), in which the current density of the diodes (JD) for all the ETLs shows the same exponential dependency on the applied voltage at VOC ≈ 0.8 V; it also shows a leakage region at VOC ≈ 0.6 V. It is worth noting that at a low illumination level, the PFN-based device has the highest leakage current, and the n value is closer to 2 than those of the other two ETLs. As a result, the overall current within the device can be dominated by leakage current, and the trap-assisted recombination process may be enhanced. This may explain why the PFN ETL performs opposingly and shows poor device performance under artificial light conditions.
As shown in Fig. 5(c), the influence of the leakage current may be reflected in the dependence of FF on the incident light intensity. When the light intensity strengthens from 10 to 100 mW cm−2 (under simulated solar irradiation), the FF appears to be steady and then shows a decreasing trend. The decrease of FF as the light intensity increases can result from two origins, namely bimolecular recombination and series resistance. Based on the JSCvs. incident light intensity fitting (see Fig. 5(a)), slopes of ≈ 1 for all ETLs can be observed, indicating the suppressed bimolecular recombination. Thus, bimolecular recombination may not play a significant role in the decreasing trend of FF under strong light intensity within these devices. From the J–V dark measurements in Fig. 3(b), the TiOx ETL exhibits the highest RS value; this can explain the sharp decrease of FF for TiOx compared to the other two ETLs, as shown in Fig. 5(c). Thus, the series resistance probably influences the decreased FF at the strong light intensity (>10 mW cm−2) for these iOPVs. On the other hand, the reverse trend was observed under weak light intensity (<1 mW cm−2, under 2700 K LED illumination). The low light intensity in which FF decreases is determined by the shunt resistance. As shown in Table S3, the PFN ETL has the lowest RSh value, which may explain its steeper FF decay under weak light intensity than those of the TiOx- and ZnO-ETL-based devices.
This FF behavior depending on the ETL type under indoor illumination can also be explained within the context of a single diode-based equivalent circuit model (Fig. S1(a)). The expression to calculate FF ((Jmax× Vmax)/(JSC × VOC)) can be defined using the normalized RS (rs = RS × (JSC/VOC)), normalized RSh (rsh = RSh× (JSC/VOC)), and normalized VOC (voc = eVOC/nkT), where the characteristic resistance (RCH) is defined as RCH = VOC/(JSCA). When RS = 0 and RSh = ∞, the ideal FF of OPVs can be expressed as follows:
(2)
As shown in Table S4, the calculated FFO is higher than those of the experimental FF values for all of the samples under both outdoor and indoor conditions. Using PFN-iOPV under 1 sun as an example, the VOC is about 0.79 V and the normalized voc is 28.07. According to eqn (2), the calculated FFO is 83.01%, while the experimental FF value of PFN under 1 sun is 75.00%. The difference between the experimental value and the calculated value from an ideal solar cell model suggests that there are other losses in practical OPVs.
In the real case of OPVs, parasitic resistances are inevitable factors. Thus, the effects of RS and RSh were introduced to the equivalent circuit model to consider these energy losses. A semi-empirical and approximated expression for FF incorporating the effects of RS and RSh is shown as follows:
(3)
where FF
RS is the fill factor influenced by the series resistance. The calculated fill factor values from eqn (3) are summarized in Table S4 and Fig. 6. It can be seen that the experimental (FF) and predicted values (FFRS+RSh) have the same trend, indicating that FF within these devices was influenced by parasitic resistance effects due to the type of ETL used. In the case of the device performance for all devices, the RCH values under the LED lamp were larger than those under AM 1.5G illumination. This is because the JSC values decreased by two orders of magnitude under the LED lamp. Moreover, the values of RS (in ideal OPVs, RS = 0) are theoretically small compared to the values of RSh (in ideal OPVs, RSh = ∞). For this reason, the calculated rs values (<0.01) appeared to be too negligible to influence the indoor performance, while the effects of rsh were more significant to reduce FF under dim light conditions. In this case, the PFN-based device has the highest rsh value under indoor illumination, which is expected to increase FF and PCE. However, its low FF0 value derived from the lowest value of the normalized VOC (voc) causes the PCE to decrease more sharply than those of the other two ETLs; see Fig. 5(d). This low voc is associated with the presence of trap-assisted recombination in PFN-iOPVs because their ideality factor (n) value is close to 2 (Fig. 5(b)).

The presence of trap-assisted recombination in PFN is coherent with the alignment of the work function (WF), as shown in Table S5. A larger energy mismatch between the WF of PFN (4.08 eV) and the LUMO of the PC70BM (4.30 eV) induces a higher level of recombination and limits the electron selectivity at the interface, leading to lower FF and PCE. Interestingly, the ZnO-iOPV has the lowest FF, the highest PCE and the highest max output power (Pmax) under LED light. Its high performance under indoor illumination was mainly affected by the photon absorption yield (the highest photocurrent generated), which is in good agreement with the AFM and transmittance optical analysis (Fig. 2).
To gain more insight into the effects of the different ETL materials on the charge transport properties under outdoor and indoor conditions, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed at open-circuit voltage. IS is an effective tool to gain information about carrier accumulation at open circuits, rapid extraction at short circuits, and carrier transport mechanisms within each layer of an organic photovoltaic cell.Fig. 7(a) and (b) display the Cole–Cole plots of the impedance spectra for PFN, TiOx, and ZnO as ETLs taken near VOC under AM 1.5G and 2700 K LED illumination, respectively. All plots under outdoor or indoor illumination show typical arc behavior for all applied voltages, which is correlated with the carrier transfer at the active layer/electrode interface. The observed radius of the semicircles varies for the different ETLs under both 1 sun and LED illumination, which is usually associated with different charge injection or charge extraction processes within these devices. To understand this behavior, we fitted the experimental data with the equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. S3, which consists of one series resistance connected to three resistor capacitance ladders (RC) in series. The series resistance takes the ITO layer into account. Each element of the 3RC circuit is correlated to the capacitance and resistance of the ETL, the bulk active layer, and the hole transport layer (HTL). Using the proposed electrical equivalent circuit to fit the experimental impedance spectroscopy data, we were able to observe different behaviors for outdoor and indoor performance. Moreover, we were able to identify the impact of each interlayer on the device performance. The calculated geometrical capacitance values of each layer are displayed in Table S6; these values depend on both the dielectric permittivity and the thickness of the layer. The different expected capacitance values for each layer allow us to assume the correlation between each layer-RC ladder.
On one hand, the outdoor fitting values do not show a dominant RC ladder for applied voltages close to open-circuit conditions, as displayed in Table S7. The measurement is strongly affected by the ITO series resistance. Thus, the low resistance values signify smooth charge transport at the interface between each layer. On the other hand, the indoor fitting values are mainly due to the bulk RC ladder because the resistance of the bulk is orders of magnitude higher than the other resistances used for the fitting; see Table S8. As shown in Fig. 8, the bulk resistance values decrease exponentially with the applied voltage. This is typical for the recombination resistance:

where
R00 is the pre-exponential factor and the other parameters are the same as in eqn (1). As expected from the recombination resistance, the slope is related to the ideality factor n. From the fitting, similar values close to 2.5 were obtained for all the samples, which is in good agreement with the ideality factor values obtained not only in the dark current density–voltage measurements (exponential region for medium voltage bias) but also the incident light intensity-VOC measurements. In all the analysis, the results can be explained when we assume that the currents are limited by trap-assisted recombination for indoor illumination conditions. In addition, the charge collection efficiency (CCE) is defined as:

(5)
where
Rrec is the recombination resistance in open circuit (OC) or non-open circuit (NOC) conditions used in eqn (4). As shown in Fig. S4, the values obtained from the CCE at the maximum power bias point, Vm ∼ 0.4 V, follows the same trend as the indoor PCE (CCEZnO = 96.7% > CCETiOx = 96.1% > CCEPFN = 94.5%).


Indium thin oxide (ITO)-patterned glass substrates (sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1) were purchased from PsiOTec Ltd. Poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]-thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) as a polymer donor (weight-average molecular weight, Mw = 125 kDa, polydispersity index, PDI = 2.7) and the small-molecule acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) (purity ≥ 99%, Mw of 1031 g mol−1), were purchased from One-Material Inc. and Solenne BV, respectively. 1,8-Diiodooctane was received from Alfa Aesar. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyl fluor-ene)] (PFN), titanium(IV) isopropoxide and zinc acetate dihydrate as electron transport layer (ETL) materials were purchased from One-Material Inc. Vanadium oxide (V2O5) and high purity silver (Ag) wire (99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Testbourne Ltd., respectively. Other chemical reagents were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.


The devices were fabricated with the inverted structure of glass/ITO/ETL/PTB7-Th:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag. The ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned with deionized water/detergent and then sonicated in acetone, methanol, and isopropanol solution in sequence for 10 min, followed by drying under a nitrogen stream and transfer to an oven for 5 min at 100 °C. The dried ITO–glass substrates were treated in ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min to remove any organic residues. The optimized diluted precursor solutions of PFN, TiOx, and ZnO were prepared according to our previous work and spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO–glass substrates at 4000, 6000 and 3000 rpm, respectively. Thermal annealing was not performed on the resulting ITO/PFN samples. In contrast, the ITO/TiOx and the ITO/ZnO samples were annealed at 400 °C and 200 °C for 1 h in ambient conditions, respectively. Afterward, the devices were transferred to a nitrogen glove box for the active layer deposition. The active layer solution was prepared by dissolving PTB7-Th and PC70BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (97:3% v/v) with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 on a 40 °C hot plate and stirring it overnight. The active layer solution was spin-casted onto the ETL at 750 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 5 nm layers of V2O5 and 100 nm Ag were sequentially deposited under high vacuum conditions (≤1 × 10−6 mbar). The effective area of the devices was 0.09 cm2.


The J–V measurements were performed at room temperature using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under both a solar simulator (Abet Technologies model 11000 class type A, Xenon arc) and LED lamp (warm white lamp with a color temperature of 2700 K Philips A60 13W E27, Philips, Netherlands). The light intensity of the AM 1.5G spectra was calibrated by an NREL-certified monocrystalline silicon photodiode at 100 mW cm−2. J–V curves were measured in the forward direction from −1 to 1 V with a scan step of 0.01 V. The different illuminances of the LED were obtained by adjusting the power supply calibrated by a silicon-cell pyranometer (model MP-100, Apogee Instruments, Inc.) with a calibration factor of 5.0 W m−2 mV−1. The illuminance of the indoor light source was measured by a digital light meter (Spectra Cine, Candela II-A, Model C-2010 EL). The distance between the artificial light source and the devices was kept constant. VOC and JSC over different light intensities were obtained by J–V measurements under a solar simulator using a set of optical density filters. The EQE spectra were measured under a forward wavelength sweep direction from 300 nm to 800 nm using a Lasing IPCE-DC model with a series number of LS1109-232. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images were extracted using silicon probes with a spring constant of 1–5 N m−1 and a resonant frequency of 75 kHz in tapping mode. The surface morphology images were analyzed using a Molecular Imaging Pico SPM II instrument (pico+). The transmittance and absorbance spectra were obtained at room temperature using an integrated sphere in a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) analyses were performed under AM 1.5G and 1000 lux LED light using an HP-4192A impedance analyzer. Impedance data were extracted at five different dc levels of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 V, superimposing an ac signal with 1 mV amplitude and 0.05 oscillation level in the frequency range between 5 Hz and 5 MHz.


In conclusion, the photovoltaic performance of OPV devices based on PTB7-Th:PC70BM using different types of ETL materials has been studied under one sun AM 1.5G and indoor light illumination with warm light color (2700 K LED). The results showed significant differences in the performance of the OPV devices depending on the ETL used. The PFN-iOPV displayed superior performance under 1 sun, with a higher PCE compared to TiOx- and ZnO-iOPV and the best reported FF of 75.00% among the studied PTB7-Th:PC70BM-based devices. Unexpectedly, PFN-iOPV showed the lowest performance when it was exposed to indoor illumination under 250–2000 lux illumination. The highest PCE values were obtained from the ZnO-ETL, with a PCE of up to 16.49%. The changes in the FF values observed in indoor and outdoor conditions can be estimated by incorporating the parasitic series and shunt resistance effects due to the type of ETL used. These results correlate well with the leakage current and the presence of trap-assisted recombination under low light intensity. In addition, the indoor PCEs for the different ETLs agreed well with the trend of the charge collection efficiency. Our work presents the proper considerations that must be taken into account to design and optimize an effective ETL for further improvement in the performance of iOPVs for indoor applications.
