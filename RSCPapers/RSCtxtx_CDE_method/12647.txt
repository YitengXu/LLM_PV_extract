Transition metal sulfides are a kind of potential candidates for efficient and stable CE materials in DSSCs due to their good electrocatalytic ability and stability towards I3− reduction. However, the low conductivity of sulfides is harmful for the electron collection and transfer process, and the absorption/desorption and diffusion process of I−/I3− should be optimized to achieve high electrocatalytic activity over Pt. Herein, a hierarchical CoFeS2/reduced graphene oxide (CoFeS2/rGO) composite was rationally designed and prepared via the in situ conversion of CoFe layer double hydroxide anchored on rGO. Due to the synergistic effects of Co and Fe, unique 3D hierarchical structures formed by nanosheets, and the conductivity of rGO, the CoFeS2/rGO CEs exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the reduction of I3− to I−, and the DSSCs could also achieve a high efficiency of 8.82%, higher than those of the devices based on Pt (8.40%) and pure CoFeS2 (8.30%) CEs. Moreover, the devices also showed the characteristics of fast activity onset, good stability, and high multiple start/stop capability. The results indicated that the developed CoFeS2/rGO composite could be a promising alternative for Pt in DSSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted worldwide attention because of their low cost and simple fabrication approach. Counter electrode (CE), one of the important elements in DSSCs, plays a critical role in promoting electron transfer from the external circuit back to the electrolyte by catalysing the reduction of I3− to I−. CE materials should have good electrical conductivity, high catalytic activity, and good stability. Although platinum (Pt) is widely used as a CE material, its easy corrosion by I−/I3− electrolyte to PtI4 and H2PtI6 deteriorates the long term stability of DSSCs. Therefore, the research for developing efficient and stable alternatives to Pt is receiving significant interest. Transition metal sulfides have a variety of advantages, such as easy synthesis, low-cost, good electrocatalytic ability, and stability towards the reduction of I3−, over other counterparts. These features make them potential candidates for efficient and stable CE materials in DSSCs.

In general, the electrocatalytic reduction of I3− involves the absorption and desorption of iodine ions, the interfacial charge transfer to reduce I3− to I−, and the diffusion of iodine ions between CE and the electrolyte. The absorption energy of iodine is generally dependent on the composition, phase, and surface state of CE materials. Recently, some multiple sulfides have been developed and they offer more opportunities to adjust the absorption energy than single metal compounds, which can further improve the electrocatalytic activity of CE materials. For example, transparent CE prepared via the electrophoresis of NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) glass had comparable electrocatalytic activity with Pt CE, and its DSSCs had a power conversion efficiency of 6.14%, similar to that of Pt (6.29%). DSSCs with CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 CE could reach a comparable power conversion efficiency of 4.96% and 5.27% with that of Pt (7.46%), respectively. However, the low conductivity of sulfides always lead to higher series resistance (CoMoS4 CE of 14.0 Ω, and NiMoS4 CE of 15.8 Ω vs. Pt CE of 8.2 Ω), which is harmful for the electron collection and transport. To further improve the conductivity of CE materials, composites have been prepared with graphene, graphite, and other conductive carbons as a matrix. For instance, the conversion efficiencies of DSSCs can be improved to 7.31% and 7.14% by adding graphite into CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 CEs. DSSCs based on the composite of CoS nanoparticles and functionalized graphene nanosheets showed a power conversion efficiency of 5.54% as compared to 4.79% of CoS nanoparticles. CoS2–graphene composite CE had higher electrocatalytic activity than Pt CE, and its power conversion efficiency of 8.34% is also higher than that of Pt (7.50%). On the other hand, the structure of CE materials also affects the diffusion process of I3−/I− ions, and a porous structure is beneficial for diffusion. Hierarchical architectures made of nanoblocks can synergistically combine the advantages, including higher surface/volume ratio, larger porosity, and accessible inner surface, of nanostructures and microstructures, which are less-pronounced in low-dimensional nanomaterials. These unique features can improve the wetting of the electrolyte and the diffusion of I3−/I− ions. Furthermore, larger surface area of hierarchical architectures can offer more active sites for interfacial charge transfer process and electrocatalytic reduction process.
To simultaneously optimize the diffusion, absorption, and charge transfer processes in the electrocatalytic reduction of I3−, hierarchical CoFeS2/reduced graphene oxide (CoFeS2/rGO) composites were rationally designed and prepared via the in situ conversion of CoFe layer double hydroxide (LDH) anchored on rGO. The CoFeS2/rGO CEs exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the reduction of I3− to I−, and the DSSCs achieved a high efficiency of 9.06%, higher than those of the devices based on Pt (8.57%) and pure CoFeS2 (8.46%) CEs.

Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. For the synthesis of CoFeS2/rGO, 2.4 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.8 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 40 mL deionized water and 20 mL butyl alcohol, and then, 0.05 g GO was added to the solution. Then, 6.4 mmol of urea and 15 mg of citric acid trisodium salt dehydrate were added and stirred for 30 min. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined steel autoclave and heated in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h. After being naturally cooled down to room temperature, 24 mmol (1.87 g) of Na2S·9H2O was added to the intermediate products and stirred for 60 min. Then, the mixture was hydrothermally treated at 120 °C for 12 h. After being naturally cooled down to room temperature, samples were filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times. CoFeS2 was also prepared under similar conditions with CoFeS2/rGO composite, but in the absence of GO.


The CoFeS2/rGO CEs were prepared by a slurry coating procedure on a cleaned FTO substrate (fluorine-doped SnO2, 15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd, Japan). The slurry was CoFeS2/rGO dissolved in ethanol (200 mg ml−1). It was sonicated for 30 min and allowed to stir for 1 h. Subsequently, the as-prepared slurry was coated onto the FTO substrates using a doctor blade method. The electrodes were dried at room temperature for 20 min in air. For comparison, pyrolytic Pt CE was prepared by drop-casting H2PtCl6 (50 μl) in ethanol (5 mM) on a 2 × 1.25 cm2 FTO glass, followed by sintering at 400 °C for 30 min


TiO2 photoanodes with an active area of 0.16 cm2 were commercially available (Ying kouOpvtech New Energy Co., Ltd) and were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min before being sensitized by dyes. After being cooled down to 80 °C, the TiO2 films were immersed in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) for 20 h.

DSSCs were fabricated by assembling the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and CEs with a hot-melt film as a spacer (Surlyn 1702; DuPont, 60 μm in thickness). The cell internal space was filled with an electrolyte using a vacuum pump. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.60 M of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M of I2, 0.50 M of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.10 M of guanidinium thiocyanate with acetonitrile as the solvent. The sealed DSSCs with an active area of 0.16 cm2 were used for the photocurrent–voltage test.

The phase of the as-prepared products was characterized using a powder XRD (Shimadzu XRD-6000) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scanning rate of 6° min−1 (2θ from 10° to 70°). The morphology and crystal lattice of the samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100). The top sectional morphologies of the CoFeS2/rGO CEs were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM NPE218).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system containing an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of LiClO4 (0.1 mol L−1), LiI (10 mmol L−1), and I2 (1 mmol L−1) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Pt worked as the counter electrode, the as-prepared CE acted as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl worked as the reference electrode. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the symmetrical dummy cells were assembled with two identical CEs filled with the same electrolyte (CE//electrolyte//CE) as used in the DSSCs. The apparent active area of the dummy cell was 0.25 cm2. In the EIS tests, the samples were scanned from 100 kHz to 100 mHz at a 0 V bias and an ac-amplitude of 10 mV. The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed using the Z-view non-linear least-squares fitting program. Tafel-polarization measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
The photocurrent density voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs were obtained using a mask under the illumination AM 1.5G simulated solar light coming from an Oriel Sol (450 W) and an AM 1.5G filter with the scan direction from the open-circuit to the short-circuit at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). All the electrical data were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium CIMPS-1, Germany).

To fabricate the composite of hierarchical CoFeS2 and rGO (CoFeS2/rGO), CoFe-LDH nanosheets anchored on rGOs (CoFe-LDH/rGO, Fig. S1) were first synthesized via a hydrothermal process with n-butyl alcohol/water as a solvent in the presence of graphene oxides. XRD patterns (Fig. 1a) reveal the successful phase conversion of hexagonal CoFeS2 (JCPDS No.75-607) from CoFe-LDH in a Na2S aqueous solution via a simple sulfuration process. SEM images (Fig. 2b and c) reveal that flower-like CoFeS2 built by the nanosheets are randomly anchored on rGO. For comparison, hierarchical CoFeS2 (Fig. 1a and d) were also prepared by sulfurating hierarchical CoFe-LDH microspheres (Fig. S2). TEM and HRTEM images of the as-prepared CoFeS2 and CoFeS2/rGO composite (Fig. 2) indicate that the CoFeS2 nanosheets are built by small nanoparticles with an interplanar distance of 0.29 nm and 0.25 nm corresponding to the (100) and (101) planes of the hexagonal CoFeS2, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 to study the electrocatalytic activity of the CoFeS2/rGO electrode towards the reduction of I3− in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM of LiI, 1 mM of I2, and 0.1 M of LiClO4. All electrodes exhibit typical oxidation–reduction peaks (Fig. 3a), corresponding to the oxidation (Ox) and reduction (Red) of I−/I3−. Although all electrodes show similar oxidation peaks, the reduction peaks of CoFeS2 and CoFeS2/rGO electrodes are more positive than those of Pt, demonstrating the better electrocatalytic ability of CoFeS2 and CoFeS2/rGO electrodes for the reduction of I3−. This result can be made quantitative using the peak-to-peak (Epp) separation between anodic and cathodic peaks. The Epp of CoFeS2 and CoFeS2/rGO electrodes are 0.21 and 0.20 V, respectively, which are obviously less than those of Pt (0.30 V). The lower Epp values suggest that the electrochemical reversibility of I−/I3− has been improved with CoFeS2 and CoFeS2/rGO electrodes, which may be derived from the synergistic effects of Co and Fe that optimize the absorption energy of I atom and decrease the activation energy of the I−/I3− redox reactions. The cathodic peak current density (JRed) of the CoFeS2 (2.0 mA cm−2) electrode is slightly smaller than that of Pt (2.06 mA cm−2), whereas CoFeS2/rGO electrode delivers a higher JRed of 2.15 mA cm−2 because of the effects of rGO.
To further understand the electrochemical process of I−/I3− redox reactions with different electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with symmetric cells (electrode/electrolyte/electrode) to investigate the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and charge transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots conducted in dark with the bias DC voltage of 0 V show two typical semicircles (Fig. 3b). The intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs) including the sheet resistance of two identical electrodes and the electrolytic resistance. The characteristic in the frequency regions between 100 kHz and 100 mHz is assigned to the resistance capacitance of the electrode/electrolyte interface, including the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding double-layer capacitance (Cμ). The characteristic in the low-frequency regions is attributed to the Nernst diffusion impedance of the I−/I3− redox species in the electrolyte. Typically, Rct is regarded as an indicator to reveal the charge transfer process and thereby to evaluate the catalytic activity of the catalysts. A small Rct facilitates the electron transfer from electrode to electrolyte to catalytically reduce I3− and consequently results in less interfacial recombination; this would further promote the dye regeneration on photoanodes and improve the photocurrent density of DSSCs.
As shown in Table 1, the value of Rct for the CoFeS2/rGO electrode (1.24 Ω cm2) is smaller than those of CoFeS2 (3.06 Ω cm2) and Pt (2.45 Ω cm2) electrodes because of the synergistic effect of the hierarchical structures of CoFeS2 and good electrical conductivity of rGO. Moreover, the value of Rs for the CoFeS2/rGO electrode is smaller than that of the CoFeS2 electrode because rGO can improve the conductivity of electrode materials and enhance the adhesion between the active materials and FTO substrate. The double-layer capacitance (Cμ) at the interface between the electrolyte and electrode reflects the active surface area for the electrocatalytic reaction. The higher Cμ (53.71 μF) of the CoFeS2/rGO electrode as compared to those of Pt (40.22 μF) and CoFeS2 (37.14 μF) electrodes demonstrates that hierarchical microstructure made of nanosheets can offer larger specific surface area for electrolyte penetration. In addition, the Nernst diffusion impedances with the order of CoFeS2/rGO (0.91 Ω cm2) < CoFeS2 (1.90 Ω cm2) < Pt (2.22 Ω cm2) reveal a faster diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte and higher limiting current density of the CoFeS2/rGO electrode. The larger slope and limited current density of the CoFeS2/rGO electrode in the J–V plots in Tafel curves (Fig. 3c) also indicate higher exchange current density (J0) of the CoFeS2/rGO electrode as compared to those of the CoFeS2 and Pt electrodes, further confirming the high electrocatalytic activity of the CoFeS2/rGO electrode for the reduction of I3−.

DSSCs were fabricated with CoFeS2, CoFeS2/rGO, and Pt CEs, and their photovoltaic performances are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S4. As shown in Table 2, the DSSCs with CoFeS2 and CoFeS2/rGO CEs have the same Voc of 780 mV, whereas that with Pt CE has a Voc of 790 mV because the open circuit voltage (Voc) is mainly determined by the energy level between the Fermi level of photoanode and the redox potential of the electrolyte. The DSSC with CoFeS2/rGO CE reaches a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.82% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 15.85 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.71. Moreover, the DSSC with CoFeS2 CE exhibits a η of 8.30%, a Jsc of 15.23 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.71. The DSSC with Pt CE exhibits a η of 8.40%, a Jsc of 14.56 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.73. The higher Jsc of DSSC with CoFeS2/rGO CE is derived from the increased electronic conductivity of the composite, rapid reduction of I3− to I−, and enhanced interfacial electron transfer between FTO and active materials. Therefore, the DSSC assembled with CoFeS2/rGO CE exhibits higher photovoltaic performances than those assembled with CoFeS2 and Pt CE. For the reliability of the data, we provided average photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs with deviation using 8 cells. The J–V curves for their photovoltaic performances are shown in Fig. S5a (CoFeS2), S5b (CoFeS2/rGO), and S5c (Pt). The photovoltaic parameters are shown in Tables S1–S3.

Multiple cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and EIS measurements (Fig. S5) reveal that the CoFeS2/rGO CE has stability similar to that of Pt CE (Fig. 4b and c) and is more stable than CoFeS2 CE (Fig. 4a) after 150 cycles. The start-up behaviour, multiple start/stop capability, and photocurrent stability (related to CE) are also important parameters for DSSCs.Fig. 4d shows the start/stop switching of the DSSCs with different CEs at alternate on/off illumination. All DSSCs have an abrupt photocurrent density up/down at on/off illumination that demonstrates their high catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−. Further studies reveal that the DSSC with CoFeS2/rGO CE can retain 99.5% of its initial photocurrent density, whereas that with CoFeS2 CE can retain only 98.3% after a simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5) for 400 s. The stability of the DSSCs under prolonged irradiation was evaluated by measuring the device under sustained irradiation for 2 hours, as shown in Fig. S6. The results indicate that rGO can improve the stability of CoFeS2, which is in good agreement with the results of multiple CVs.
Based on the abovementioned electrochemical analysis, including CV, EIS, Tafel measurements, and J–V characteristics, CoFeS2/rGO CE displays the highest electrocatalytic performances in DSSCs due to the synergistic effects of Co and Fe, unique 3D hierarchical structures built by nanosheets, and conductivity of rGO. First, the synergistic effects of Co and Fe can optimize the absorption energy of I atom and decrease the activation energy of the I−/I3− redox reactions, which further improve the reversibility of the electrocatalytic redox reactions. Second, high percentage of surface atoms on nanosheets composed of nanoparticles can provide more electrochemical active sites and shorten the electron diffusion path to catalyse the reduction of I3−. Third, hierarchical architectures built by nanosheets have a higher surface/volume ratio, rich porosity, and accessible inner surface that can facilitate the wetting of electrolyte and diffusion of I−/I3− ions. Fourth, conductive rGO can enhance the electron transfer and adhesion between active materials and FTO substrate. Additionally, the in situ conversion from CoFe-LDH/rGO to CoFeS2/rGO can maintain the strong interactions between 3D hierarchical structures and rGO, which can improve the stability of the overall structure and facilitate the electron transfer from rGO to hierarchical CoFeS2.

In summary, a hierarchical CoFeS2/reduced graphene oxide (CoFeS2/rGO) composite was rationally designed and prepared via the in situ conversion of CoFe layer double hydroxide (LDH) anchored on rGO. Due to the synergistic effects of Co and Fe, unique 3D hierarchical structures built by nanosheets, and the conductivity of rGO, the CoFeS2/rGO CEs exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the reduction of I3− to I−, and the DSSCs achieved a high efficiency of 8.82%, higher than those of the devices based on Pt (8.40%) and pure CoFeS2 (8.30%) CEs. Moreover, the devices also showed the characteristics of fast activity onset, good stability, and high multiple start/stop capability. The results indicated that the developed CoFeS2/rGO composite could be a promising alternative for Pt in DSSCs.
