Manipulation of the alkyl chain branching point has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the performance of conjugated polymers in optoelectronic devices. In this work, an efficient lactone polymer donor L3 is developed via shifting the alkyl chain branching point from the β position to the γ position on the thiophene bridges of a known polymer L2. Such a near-backbone manipulation leads to enhanced backbone planarity, a smaller bandgap, varied energy levels, different packing behavior, improved hole mobility, reduced surface free energy and superior photovoltaic performance to L3. L3 demonstrates a power conversion efficiency of 17.81% (certified 17.1%) in ternary organic solar cells. L3 is among the few donors that can offer >17% certified efficiencies in organic solar cells to date.

Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential in solution-processed optoelectronic devices, such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photodetectors (OPDs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). The conjugated backbones and the alkyl side chains are the key elements for constructing CPs. For a long time, research has been focused on the development of novel conjugated backbones since they determine the optoelectronic properties of CPs. In recent years, side chain effects have received considerable attention. The alkyl chains not only guarantee good solubility of CPs, but also influence polymer packing and crystallinity, thus showing impact on the performance of CPs in devices. Nowadays, many high-performance CPs in OSCs and OFETs contain branched alkyl chains. Some studies indicate that changing the branching point of alkyl chains can vary the packing of CPs, leading to different film morphology and device performance. Manipulating the alkyl chain branching point has become an effective strategy to improve the performance of CPs in OSCs and OFETs. However, previous studies focused on the alkyl chains that are relatively far away from the polymer backbone. Although distant-from-backbone branching point manipulation affects the packing and crystallinity of CPs, it generally shows less influence on backbone planarity and optoelectronic properties. To get a full picture of the branching point effects, especially those on backbone configuration and optoelectronic properties, it is necessary to pay more attention to the near-backbone manipulation.

3-Alkylthiophenes are frequently-used bridge units for constructing high-performance donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer donors in OSCs. Their alkyl chains are close to the polymer backbone and therefore may influence the planarity and optoelectronic properties of the polymers. However, branching point manipulation on thiophene (Th) bridges was less explored. Previously, our group reported a lactone-type D–A copolymer donor L2. The OSCs based on L2 and a nonfullerene acceptor Y6 (ref. 38) delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.57%. In this work, we developed a new lactone polymer L3 via shifting the alkyl chain branching point from the β position to the γ position on the Th bridges of L2 (Fig. 1a). Such a near-backbone manipulation led to enhanced backbone planarity, smaller bandgap, varied energy levels, different packing behavior, improved hole mobility and reduced surface free energy of L3. Ternary solar cells based on L3, a nonfullerene acceptor N3 (ref. 39) and a fullerene acceptor PC61BM afforded a PCE of 17.81%.

The synthetic details for L3 are given in the ESI. L3 has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 42.3 kDa and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.64. The reference L2 with a Mn of 57.5 kDa and a PDI of 1.62 was also prepared for comparison. The absorption spectra for L2 and L3 are shown in Fig. 1b. Compared with L2, L3 shows bathochromic-shifted spectra in either solution or film. In solution, the 0–0 and 0–1 transition peaks for L3 are located at 604 nm and 562 nm, respectively, while those for L2 are located at 592 nm and 552 nm, respectively. In film, all peaks show a hypochromatic shift and the 0–1 transition peak intensifies for L2 and L3, suggesting that both polymers exhibit a H-aggregation tendency in the solid state. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) estimated from the absorption onsets of the films are 1.95 eV and 1.93 eV for L2 and L3, respectively. It can be concluded that the shift of the branching point from the β position to the γ position shrinks the polymer bandgap and leads to a bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum. The frontier molecular orbital levels were estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S9) and an energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1c. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels for L3 are −5.50 eV and −2.92 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels both increase in L3 as compared to L2, and the HOMO level increases more. This leads to a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap of L3, consistent with the smaller Eoptg of L3 (L3 vs. L2).

To understand why the β-to-γ shifting led to a reduced bandgap and different energy levels of L3, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Molecular models for L2 and L3 are shown in Fig. 2. To simplify the calculation, 2-ethylhexyl chains on the benzodithiophene (BDT) units were replaced by methyl groups, 2-butyloctyl chains on the Th bridges of L2 were replaced by isobutyl groups, and 3-butylnonyl chains on the Th bridges of L3 were replaced by isopentyl groups. The geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. It was interesting to find that the β-to-γ shifting reduced all dihedral angles (in orange color) between BDT and Th. The average dihedral angles between BDT and Th are 40.3° and 39.3° for L2 and L3, respectively. In contrast, the average dihedral angles (in green color) between Th and the lactone unit 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran-5-one (DTP) are 14.1° for both L2 and L3. This means that the β-to-γ shifting selectively reduces the torsion between BDT and Th while showing less influence on the torsion between Th and DTP. Since the alkyl chain is closer to BDT than DTP, moving the branched alkyl groups away from the polymer backbone should decrease the steric repulsion between the alkyl chain and BDT, thus selectively reducing the torsion at the BDT side. The DFT calculations confirmed the better backbone planarity of L3 due to the reduced torsion between the BDT and Th units. The enhanced backbone planarity can increase the conjugation length, thus narrowing the bandgap. The DFT-predicted HOMO and LUMO levels are −5.09 eV and −2.51 eV for L2, and −5.07 eV and −2.50 eV for L3, respectively. The variation trends in DFT-predicted HOMO and LUMO levels as well as the HOMO–LUMO gap are in good agreement with those from CV measurements (Fig. 1c). For comparison, we also investigated the distant-from-backbone manipulation case by DFT (Fig. S11). In this case, two molecular models L2-BDT-β and L2-BDT-γ were built (the alkyl chains on BDT are isobutyl groups and isopentyl groups, respectively), and the alkyl chains on the BDT units are far away from the backbone. The optimized molecular geometries indicate very similar backbone planarity for L2-BDT-β and L2-BDT-γ. The average dihedral angles between BDT and Th and between DTP and Th are 40.5°/14.0° for L2-BDT-β, and 40.6°/14.1° for L2-BDT-γ, respectively. L2-BDT-β and L2-BDT-γ show identical HOMO and LUMO levels. These results indicate that unlike near-backbone manipulation, distant-from-backbone manipulation has neglectable influence on polymer backbone planarity and energy levels.
Polymer packing and orientation were investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The GIWAXS patterns for pure L2 and L3 films are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. L2 adopts a typical “edge-on” packing mode, with a (010) π–π stacking peak in the in-plane (IP) direction and a (100) lamellar stacking peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. In contrast, L3 shows a more complex packing behavior. A distinct (010) peak in the IP direction and a strong (100) peak in the OOP direction indicate the predominant “edge-on” packing in the L3 film. A weak (010) π–π stacking peak was also observed in the OOP direction, suggesting that partial L3 adopts the “face-on” orientation. The “edge-on/face-on” bimodal packing was found in some CPs. It is a favorable packing mode for OSCs since it facilitates both lateral and vertical charge transport. The π–π stacking and lamellar stacking d-spacings estimated from the q values of the (010) and (100) peaks are 3.74 Å and 19.55 Å for L2, and 3.74 Å and 20.77 Å for L3, respectively (Table S1). The larger lamellar stacking d-spacing of L3 could be due to the longer 3-butylnonyl side chains on the Th bridges, which increases the interlamellar distance. It should be noted that for either L2 or L3, the (200) and (300) peaks were also observed in the OOP direction. This suggests the long-range ordering and good crystallinity of both polymers. We measured the hole mobility (μh) for pure L2 and L3 films by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S14). The μh for L2 and L3 films are 6.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher μh of L3 could be due to the partial L3 with a “face-on” orientation, which enhanced vertical hole transport in hole-only devices. It can be concluded that the β-to-γ shifting on Th bridges changes the packing behavior of the polymer. The existing “face-on” packing improves vertical hole transport and increases SCLC mobility.
We evaluated the performance of L2 and L3 in binary OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:N3/PDIN/Ag. The D/A ratio, active layer thickness and additive (diphenyl ether) content were optimized (Tables S3–S8). The best L2:N3 cells afforded a PCE of 16.69%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.870 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.99 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 76.8%, while the best L3:N3 cells gave a higher PCE of 17.23%, with a Voc of 0.860 V, a Jsc of 26.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.9% (Fig. 4a, Table 1). Compared with L2 cells, L3 cells show a slightly lower Voc and FF, but higher Jsc. The lower Voc can be attributed to the higher HOMO level of L3. The higher Jsc is due to the higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) of L3 cells in a wide spectral range. L3 cells show a higher EQE response than L2 cells at 357–920 nm (Fig. 4b). The highest EQE for L2 and L3 cells are 78% and 82%, respectively, suggesting more efficient charge generation in L3 cells. We evaluated the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) and charge collection probabilities (Pcoll) for L2 and L3 cells by plotting photocurrent density (Jph) against efficient voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4c). L3 cells showed a higher Pdiss of 96.8% and a comparable Pcoll of 86.5% as compared to L2 cells (Pdiss, 95.8%; Pcoll, 86.6%). To figure out why L3 cells gave a lower FF, we measured μh and electron mobility (μe) in L2:N3 and L3:N3 blend films by using the SCLC method (Fig. S15 and S16, Table S10). Although L3:N3 films showed a higher μh than L2:N3 films, the μe is lower. The μh/μe ratios for L2:N3 and L3:N3 films are 1.08 and 1.94, respectively. The less balanced hole/electron transport in L3 cells should account for the relatively low FF. We also investigated the bimolecular recombination of L2 and L3 cells by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Fig. 4d). L2 and L3 cells show similar α values of 0.963 and 0.969, respectively, suggesting similar bimolecular recombination in the active layer.

The molecular packing and the morphology for L2:N3 and L3:N3 blend films were studied by GIWAXS and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, both films present a strong (010) π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction and a strong (100) lamellar stacking peak in the IP direction, suggesting that either the polymer or N3 adopts a “face-on” orientation in the blend films. The π–π stacking and lamellar stacking d-spacings are 3.61 Å and 20.39 Å for the L2:N3 film, and 3.60 Å and 21.09 Å for the L3:N3 film, respectively (Table S2). By using the Scherrer equation, the corresponding crystallite coherence lengths (CCL) for the (010) and (100) peaks were calculated to be 20.78 Å and 67.07 Å for the L2:N3 film, and 21.09 Å and 72.26 Å for the L3:N3 film, respectively. The larger CCL010 and CCL100 for the L3:N3 film suggest its higher crystallinity. The AFM height and phase images are shown in Fig. 5. The surface of the L3:N3 film is much smoother than that of the L2:N3 film as indicated by the root-mean-square roughness (Rrms). The Rrms for the L2:N3 and L3:N3 films is 2.85 nm and 1.61 nm, respectively. Both films present nanofiber structures. The L3:N3 film shows finer nanofibers with a diameter of ∼17 nm. We measured the surface free energy (γ) of L2, L3 and N3 by carrying out the contact angle experiments with water and ethylene glycol as the liquids (see the ESI). The γ for L2, L3 and N3 is 19.67 mJ m−2, 17.42 mJ m−2 and 16.21 mJ m−2, respectively (Table S11). The branching point manipulation reduces the γ of the polymer. L3 has a surface free energy closer to that of N3. Since the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter is proportional to the surface free energy difference between the two interacting components, the interaction parameter for L3 and N3 should be smaller than that for L2 and N3. The smaller Flory–Huggins interaction parameter confirms the higher miscibility between L3 and N3. And the resulting morphology provides more donor/acceptor interfaces for exciton dissociation, thus leading to higher Jsc of L3:N3 cells.
To achieve higher efficiency, we thought about using acceptor PC61BM to improve the electron transport in L3:N3 cells. With 8.3 wt% PC61BM in the active layer, the L3:N3:PC61BM (1:1.2:0.2) ternary cells gave a PCE of 17.81%, with a Voc of 0.864 V, a Jsc of 26.97 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.4% (Fig. 6a, Table S9). The ternary cells were also measured at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), and a certified PCE of 17.1% (Voc, 0.851 V; Jsc, 25.93 mA cm−2; FF, 77.6%; effective area, 2.580 mm2) was recorded (Fig. S17). L3 is among the few donors affording >17% certified PCEs to date. The SCLC measurements gave a μh of 6.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 6.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μh/μe ratio is 1.07 for the L3:N3:PC61BM (1:1.2:0.2) blend film (Table S10). PC61BM enhanced the μe and led to more balanced hole/electron transport in the ternary cells, thus improving the FF. The ternary cells presented a higher EQE response (EQE maximum 84%), more efficient charge generation and collection (Pdiss, 97.7%; Pcoll, 88.2%) and less bimolecular recombination (α, 0.974) than the L3:N3 cells (Fig. 6b, S18 and S19). The GIWAXS patterns and AFM images for the L3:N3:PC61BM (1:1.2:0.2) blend film indicate that the addition of PC61BM has insignificant influence on molecular packing and film morphology (Fig. S20).

By shifting the alkyl chain branching point from the β position to the γ position on the Th bridges of a conjugated polymer L2, we developed a highly efficient polymer donor L3. DFT models indicate that such a near-backbone branching point manipulation reduces the torsion between the BDT and Th units and enhances the polymer backbone planarity. In contrast, conventional distant-from-backbone manipulation has neglectable influence on the backbone planarity. Consequently, L3 exhibits a smaller bandgap, higher energy levels, different packing behavior, higher hole mobility, reduced surface free energy and superior photovoltaic performance as compared to L2. L3 achieved a PCE of 17.81% (certified 17.1%) in solar cells and is among the best polymer donors to date. This work provides an insight into the branching point effects, which would be instructive for designing high-performance CPs for optoelectronic devices.
