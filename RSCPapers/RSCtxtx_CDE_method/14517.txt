Dendrimers with benzothiazole–benzoxazole surface groups and electron transporting triazole as bridging units and diphenyl sulfone as core unit were synthesized successfully by Cu(I)-catalysed Huisgen ‘click reaction’ using a convergent approach. All the dendrimers exhibit excellent optical and electrochemical properties. Higher-generation dendrimers exhibit better current generating capacity and show better power conversion efficiency than lower-generation dendrimers when used as additives in dye-sensitized solar cells.

The world's energy needs are growing constantly and all the while more and more environmental issues are observed as a consequence of increasing carbon dioxide emission. Hence there is an increase in pressure to use renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, but the production of solar cells is still too costly to compete with available energy sources. Though in 1991, Michael Grätzel and Brian O'Regan invented the Grätzel cell in order to reduce the energy demand, still practical applications require further research to be carried out in this area. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are low cost solar cells characterized by thin films. DSSCs are electrochemical devices comprising a light-absorbing molecule anchored on to semiconducting titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles which make use of sunlight to generate electricity.

Frechet and Vögtle made a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of dendrimer chemistry through the synthesis of various types of dendrimers with varied applications. Dendrimers have received much attention in the areas of material science and biological science such as in versatile biomimetic catalysts, drug delivery systems, sensors, solar cell additives and efficient light harvesting antenna, multivalent diagnostics for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), molecular encapsulation and bioconjugate chemistry. Heterocycles such as thiazole, oxazole, imidazole systems play a vital role in the conformational landscape because of charge–charge interaction and charge delocalization over two or more sites. Such charges can rapidly and efficiently explore all sites of the molecule with respect to their reactivity so affecting the photophysical properties. In this context benzothiazoles, benzoxazoles and benzimidazoles have the capability of producing a range of colours with good transport properties, so that they can be used as both emissive and electron transport materials in OLEDs.
Benzoheterazole-based dendrimer systems have been applied as additives in DSSCs and light emitting materials. According to the literature survey, only very few benzothiazole dendrimers have been synthesized through click chemistry in order to study their application in material chemistry. The architypal click reaction that has gained tremendous attention since it was reported by Fokin and Sharpless and which fulfills all the criteria for the construction of dendritic structures is the Cu(I) salt catalyzed reaction of azides with terminal alkynes. This reaction is highly efficient and occurs under benign conditions in the presence of other reactive groups with no byproducts. Due to its orthogonal, robust nature, click chemistry has attracted significant attention of the material science community, especially for the construction of complex polymeric materials and dendrimers. Characteristics of click reactions include high yields, short time duration, stereospecificity, mild reaction conditions, inexpensive, environmentally as well as eco-friendly reagents and with no protection and deprotection protocols, in addition to air- and moisture-tolerant reaction conditions.
Recently, water-soluble glycodendrimers, chalcone dendrimers, quinolone dendrimers, benzothiazole dendrimers and diphenylamine dendrimers have been reported from our laboratory through click chemistry. We report herein the synthesis, photophysical properties as well as DSSC application of dendrimers 1–6 with benzothiazole–benzoxazole as surface groups and 1,2,3-triazole as bridging units and diphenyl sulfone as core unit through click chemistry using a convergent approach (Scheme 1).

The synthetic pathway leading to dendritic wedges 12 and 13 from 2-mercaptobenzothiazole/2-mercaptobenzoxazole is outlined in Scheme 2. 2-(Prop-2-ynylthio)benzo[d]thiazole 7 and 2-(prop-2-ynylthio)benzo[d]oxazole 8 were obtained in 95 and 94% yield by the reaction of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole/2-mercaptobenzoxazole with 1.1 equiv. of propargyl bromide, TBAB (5 mg) and KOH (1.5 equiv.) in a mixture of toluene and water (1:1) at room temperature for 2 h (Scheme 2).

This may be due to the electronic transition that occurs in the benzothiazole unit. Similarly, dendrimers 2, 4 and 6 have almost identical surface units, which showed three absorption bands, between 245 and 286 nm (Fig. 1), this may be due to the electronic transition occurring in the benzoxazole unit. As the number of triazole and benzothiazole–benzoxazole units increases from zeroth generation to the second generation, the absorption intensity also increases which indicates that the amount of light absorbed by the dendritic antenna increases from lower generation to higher generation which is otherwise known as valence effect in dendrimer chemistry.

The fluorescence properties of dendrimers 1–6 parallel the absorption spectra. All the dendrimers showed only one intense band between 382 and 396 nm and λem values of the fluorescence spectra are shown in Table 1.

Unlike in the absorption spectra, the emission spectra showed fluorescence quenching with increasing number of triazole and benzothiazole–benzoxazole units (Fig. 2). The fluorescence intensity is found to decrease as the number of triazole and benzoheterazole units increases in the dendritic architectures.

The redox behaviour of dendrimers 1–6 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CHCl3 (1 × 10−4 M) at room temperature. All the compounds exhibited an electrochemical response, and the cyclic voltammogram of the dendrimers 2, 4 and 6 are shown in Fig. 3, with redox potentials listed in Table 1. A glassy carbon working electrode was used with Pt wire counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as reference electrode. CV studies were carried out from solutions of the substrates (1 mM) in CHCl3 using tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte. The redox behaviour of zeroth-generation dendrimer 1 and second-generation dendrimer 3 are similar, exhibiting one irreversible cathodic peak which is shifted to slightly higher negative potential in 3 and one anodic peak which is shifted towards slightly higher positive potential in 3 due to the presence of additional triazole and benzoheterazole units. The dendrimers 2, 4 and 6 also show a similar shift in redox potentials (Fig. 3).

Dendrimers 1, 3 and 5 showed a gradual decrease of Epc from −0.52, −0.55 and −0.60 V and Epa increases slightly as 1.24, 1.25 and 1.28 V. Among the dendrimers 2, 4 and 6, Epc varied as −0.43, −0.44 and −0.46 and Epa values as 1.51, 1.52 and 1.52 V. The change in Epc and Epa values for 1, 3 and 5 when compared with 2, 4 and 6 could be due to change in the heterocyclic unit and there is only a gradual change on increasing the dendrimer generation. In conclusion, the electrochemical behaviour is slightly altered on increasing the number of triazole and benzoheterazole moiety in the dendritic architectures.

The nature of the electrolytic solution can improve the solar cell performance in dye sensitized solar cells. Against the background provided in the Introduction section, adding various nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrimidine and alkylpyridines to the electrolyte solution increased the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) values and improved the efficiency (η). Hence, nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds as additives might enhance Voc and Jsc due to the electron donating ability of the nitrogen atom. In the current investigation, benzoheterazole dendrimers, whose heterocyclic ring consisted of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon were examined as additives in DMF solution of I−/I3− redox electrolyte.

The solar cell performance of dendrimers 1–6 were compared to that without an additive (Table 2). The photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dendrimers were also investigated. It was found that on passing from zeroth to second generation dendrimers, photophysical properties became altered, which helps to elucidate the influence of the dendrimer additives on the dye-sensitized solar cell performance.

In our previous work, Voc, Jsc and η values of 780 mV, 6.2 mA cm−2 and 7.1%, respectively, were reported. In order to achieve higher short circuit current density and efficiency, the benzothiazole–benzoxazole dendrimers were synthesized up to the second generation and used as additive in DSSCs. The tested dendrimers significantly affected the performance of the dye-sensitized solar cell as shown in Fig. 4. On passing from zeroth-generation dendrimers to second-generation dendrimers, Voc, Jsc and current also increase due to the presence of increasing number of triazole and benzoheterazole units. All of the Voc values for solar cells containing dendrimers were greater than that for the cell without an additive. Among the tested dendrimers, second-generation dendrimers 5 and 6 displayed the largest Voc (883, 885 mV) and Jsc (11.8, 12 mA cm−2) values and highest efficiency of 8.0 and 8.2%, respectively.

In conclusion, synthesis of dendritic structures with triazole as bridging unit and benzoheterazole as surface group has been achieved through a ‘click’ chemistry approach. UV studies indicate that as the number of triazole units increases, absorption also increases, and hence the light absorbed by the dendritic antenna increases with increase in the dendrimer generation. The CV study reflects a mild change in the redox behaviour as a function of the dendritic generation. Further as the number of triazole units increase in the dendrimers of higher generation, the DSSC performance also increases. Dendrimers 5 and 6 exhibited better power conversion efficiency (η) values of 8.0 and 8.2%, respectively, when used as additives in DSSC than the control (N3 dye/KI/I2) as well as other benzothiazole/benzoxazole dendrimers as additives. Synthesis of similar benzoheterazole dendrimers and their DSSC studies with higher efficiency are underway.
