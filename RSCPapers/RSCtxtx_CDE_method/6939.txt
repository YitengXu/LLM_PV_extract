A new quaternized ammonium polyfluorene polyelectrolyte poly[3,3′-(2-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexyl-5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-methyl-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)]dibromide (PFBTBr) is applied as the cathode interfacial layer of a polymer solar cell based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurements of PFBTBr layers demonstrate the formation of the interfacial dipole between the active layer and the cathode by inserting a PFBTBr interfacial layer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of PFBTBr layers with varied concentrations show that the morphology of the PFBTBr layer plays a direct, important role in the contact quality between the active layer and the PFBTBr interfacial layer, which can strongly affect the performance of devices. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (XPS) indicate that PFBTBr may serve as a protective agent for the active layer against Al-induced degradation, since it prevents hot aluminum atoms from diffusing into the active layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs with the PFBTBr layer reaches 3.9% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, which is 1.6 times higher in comparison with that (2.4%) of the device without the PFBTBr layer. The significant increase in efficiency and easy utilization indicate that this interfacial material has promising and practical application prospects.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention because of their potential to enable the fabrication of low-cost and flexible devices. Significant improvements have been made due to materials design, device optimization and interface engineering. The interface between the active layer and the electrodes is of fundamental importance to the charge transport and extraction process, which determines the device performance and long term stability.

Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), which are conjugated polymers with pendant groups bearing ionic functionalities, have been applied in organic electronic devices such as organic light-emitting devices, thin-film transistors, and polymer solar cells. Comparing with the previous cathode interfacial layer materials, CPEs have several advantages. First, the methanol-soluble CPEs will not damage the underlying active layer and can be used to fabricate vacuum-deposition-free PSCs. Besides, the conjugated main chain of CPEs can provide better compatibility and conductivity with the active layer. Furthermore, the CPEs can induce a large interfacial dipole layer between the active layer and the cathode to enhance the open-circuit voltage and charge extraction. Bazan et al. employed two poly(thiophene) derivatives as cathode interfacial materials and increased the PCE of PSCs based on poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) to 6.5%. Polyfluorene derivatives PFN and WPF-6-oxy-F have reported as cathode interfacial layers in PSCs by Wu et al. and Kim et al., respectively. Yang et al. combined the conjugated polyelectrolyte with a surfactant as an interlayer and reached a PCE of 4.1% for PSC based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). In addition, Woo et al. employed a combination of titanium oxide and a CPE FPQ-Br as an electron transporting layer. Recently, Wu et al. improved the efficiency of inverted PSCs based on thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) to 9.2% via the incorporation of a conjugated polyelectrolyte PFN interfacial layer. Although previous studies have shown that CPEs have great potential in the optimization of PSCs, the influence of the morphology of the interfacial layer of CPEs on the performance of PSCs and the interaction between CPEs and the cathode are not understood clearly.
In this study, we synthesized a new quaternized ammonium polyfluorene polyelectrolyte poly[3,3′-(2-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexyl-5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-methyl-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)]dibromide (PFBTBr) and incorporated it as a cathode interfacial layer in polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). We demonstrate that the insertion of a PFBTBr layer between the active layer and the Al cathode can be an effective strategy for increasing the PCE of a PSC based on P3HT:PC61BM from 2.4% to 3.9%. We also found that the morphology of the PFBTBr layer had a strong impact on device performance. It was interesting to note that the PFBTBr layer may serve as a protective agent for the active layer against Al-induced degradation. The significant increase in efficiency and easy utilization indicate that this interfacial material has promising and practical application prospects.

All reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich and Acros and used as received. Compounds 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) and 2,2′-(9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (2) were prepared according to the literature, and all of them were recrystallized to reach the desirable purity for the following reactions.


Elemental analysis was carried out with a Thermoquest CHNS-Ovelemental analyzer. Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was carried out with a Waters 410 instrument using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent (flow rate of 1 mL min−1, at 35 °C) and polystyrene as the standard. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker AVANCE-500 NMR spectrometer and a Varian Mercury-300 NMR, respectively. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured by a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were performed with a Bioanalytical Systems BAS 100 B/W electrochemical workstation.


Poly[3,3′-(2-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexyl-5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-methyl-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)]: monomers 1, 2 and Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mg) and several drops of Aliquat 336 were dissolved in a mixture of 6 mL of toluene and 2 mL of aqueous 2 M Na2CO3. The mixture was refluxed with vigorous stirring for 72 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was poured into a mixture of methanol and water (10:1). The precipitated material was recovered by filtration through a funnel. The resulting solid material was washed for 12 h using acetone to remove oligomers and catalyst residues. The synthesized neutral polymer was named PFBT. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, TMS): δ (ppm) 8.11–8.07 (m, Ar–H), 7.92–7.88 (m, Ar–H), 7.56–7.52 (m, Ar–H), 2.83–2.63 (m, Ar–CH2–), 2.00–1.98 (m, –(CH2)n–), 1.41–1.33 (m, –(CH2)n–), 0.91–0.79 (m, –CH3).


Poly[3,3′-(2-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexyl-5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-methyl-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)]dibromide: a 100 mL flask with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with the neutral polymer PFBT (100 mg) dissolved in 40 mL of THF. 2 mL of bromoethane and 10 mL of DMSO were added to the polymer solution. The solution was stirred at 50 °C for 120 h. THF and extra bromoethane were evaporated. The polymer was precipitated in about 100 mL of ethyl acetate, collected by centrifugation and washed with chloroform and THF, and dried overnight under vacuum at 80 °C. The obtained polyelectrolyte was named PFBTBr. 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO, TMS): δ (ppm) 8.22–8.12 (m, Ar–H), 7.79–7.65 (m, Ar–H), 3.46–3.12 (m, Ar–CH2–), 2.59–2.50 (m, –(CH2)n–), 1.29–1.06 (m, –(CH2)n–), 0.88 (br, –CH3).


The alcohol-soluble PFBTBr was used as an interfacial dipole layer in PSCs. The structure of the devices was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (180 nm)/PFBTBr/Al (100 nm). The glass substrate, pre-coated with indium-tin-oxide (ITO) having a sheet resistance of around 15 ohm sq−1, was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath sequentially with a 2% Helmanex soap in water mixture, deionized water, and acetone, followed by isopropyl alcohol, and dried at 120 °C in an oven. The surface was cleaned by UV-ozone treatment. The hole-injecting layer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulphonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P VPAI 4083) was spin coated on the ITO at a thickness of 30 nm and baked at 120 °C for 10 min on a hot plate under air. In the glove box, a solution of 17 mg of P3HT (Rieke Metals) and 17 mg of PC61BM (1-material) in 1 mL of dichlorobenzene was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layers for 20 s, followed by solvent annealing for 1 h to obtain a thickness of 180 nm, and subsequent baking at 150 °C for 10 min under N2. A solution of PFBTBr in methanol was spin coated on the active layer as an interfacial dipole layer. Al was deposited as the cathode through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr. The photoactive area was defined by the shadow mask (9 mm2). For comparison, devices without interfacial layers were also fabricated using experimental procedures identical to those for devices with interfacial layers.


Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 SMU instrument under the 100 mW cm−2 illumination from a solar simulator (ABET Technologies) with an AM 1.5G filter in a N2-filled glove box. A calibrated AIST-certified silicon photodiode was used to confirm the measurement conditions. All the device performance data in this manuscript represent the average for a minimum of 20 devices. EFM measurements were carried out on an XE-70 high accuracy small sample scanning probe microscope (AFM, Park Systems Co., Korea). Conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips (Multi 75-E, Park Systems Co., Korea) used for this study had a typical spring constant of 3 N m−1 and a resonance frequency of 75 kHz. The AC modulation for the EFM scan was 3 V in amplitude and 10 kHz in frequency. The resulting images were plane fit with XEI software. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was investigated using a VG ESCALAB MKII spectrometer with Mg K excitation (1253.6 eV). Binding energy calibration was based on C 1s at 284.6 eV.


The synthesis route to the polymer is shown in Scheme 1. The compounds 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) and 2,2′-(9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (2) were prepared according to procedures which have been described elsewhere. The neutral polymer derived from compounds 1 and 2 was obtained by using Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling methods. The co-monomer feed ratio of 1 to 2 was 1:1 and the corresponding polymer was named PFBT. Conversion of the neutral polymer was achieved by stirring with bromoethane in DMSO–THF (1:4) at 50 °C for 120 h. The obtained polymer was named PFBTBr.

The solubility of the quaternized polymer is different from its neutral precursors. The obtained neutral polymer has good solubility in common organic solvents such as THF and chloroform, but is insoluble in methanol, DMSO and water. After quaternization, the resulting polyelectrolyte is completely soluble in methanol. The solubility of the polymer in methanol offers an opportunity to fabricate multilayer PSCs by spin-coating without damaging the underlying layers.
The average molecular weights were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) against the polystyrene standard with THF as an eluting solvent. The related data obtained from GPC are given in Table 1. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the neutral polymer is 59400 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 1.44. Since quaternization was conducted under mild conditions, it is safe to assume that the polyelectrolyte would have a molecular weight of the same order as its neutral precursor.

We employed the conjugated polyelectrolyte, PFBTBr, as a cathode interfacial layer in bulk heterojunction solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). The structure of each device is as follows: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM (180 nm)/PFBTBr/Al (100 nm). We also prepared control devices without PFBTBr as the cathode interfacial layer. All devices were fabricated from the same batch.


Fig. 1a presents the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs with (device 1) and without (device 2) the PFBTBr interfacial layer, under the 1000 W m−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination. Device 2 exhibits poor performance with a Voc of 0.51 V, a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2, an FF of 53.5% and a PCE of 2.4%. In contrast, the open circuit voltage of device 1 drastically rises by 0.12 V to 0.63 V. The short circuit current of device 1 is 10.1 mA cm−2, which shows a 12% increase compared with device 2. Meanwhile, the fill factor of device 1 goes up to 61.5% with an enhancement of 8%. Thus the PCE of device 1 with PFBTBr reaches 3.9% which is 1.6 times higher than that of device 2.
The dark J–V curves of the devices with and without the PFBTBr layer were measured to get a better understanding of the electrical characteristics of devices with a PFBTBr layer. It can be observed from Fig. 1b that the dark J–V characteristic has three distinct regimes. At low voltage, the measured current is dominated by local leakage currents due to weak spots in the film, giving rise to ohmic behavior, which is symmetric for reverse bias. In the diffusion current dominated regime, where the current increases exponentially with voltage, the current is diffusion dominated since the built-in electric field opposes the direction of the current. When the flat band condition is reached, the current becomes space-charge limited. Consequently, the built-in voltage can be read at the cross point between the exponential and SCLC regimes, which can be taken as an upper limit for Voc in this device. As shown in Fig. 1b, at reverse and low voltage (−2 to 0.3 V), the device with the PFBTBr interfacial layer has a smaller leakage current which indicates that the introduction of the PFBTBr layer reduces the hole–electron recombination loss at the P3HT/Al interface. What's more, the device with the PFBTBr layer also achieved higher current in the space charge limited current dominated regime (0.64–2 V), indicating the efficient charge transport and the decrease of series resistance, which may explain the increase of FF from 53.5% to 61.5%. Moreover, in the diffusion current dominated regime, the turn-on voltage of the device with the PFBTBr layer shifts from about 0.4–0.55 V to 0.6–0.7 V (the diffusion current dominated regime of the device with PFBTBr ranges from 0.3 V to 0.64 V, while the diffusion current dominated regime of the device without PFBTBr ranges from 0.14 V to 0.55 V), suggesting that the built-in potential (Vbi) across the device drastically increases by the introduction of the PFBTBr layer. Therefore, we suspect that a dipole layer formed between Al and the P3HT:PC61BM active layer, resulting in an increase in Vbi within the devices and thus an increase of Voc.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices illuminated by monochromatic light are shown in Fig. 1c. The EQE also increases from 52.9% to 60%, which corresponds to the increase in Jsc.
To visualize the interfacial dipole upon the incorporation of the PFBTBr layer, we directly probe the surface potential variation by electrostatic force microscopy (EFM). Fig. 2 shows the topographic and EFM images of the active layer half covered by the interfacial layer, obtained simultaneously. The concentration of PFBTBr solution used in the EFM measurements is 0.5 mg mL−1. The surface potential is uniform in the right active layer area and the left PFBTBr interfacial layer area. However, from Fig. 2b and d, the surface potential of the PFBTBr layer is about 200 mV higher than that of the active layer, which proves the fact that there is an electric dipole layer with the positive charge end pointing towards the Al cathode and the negative charge end pointing toward the active layer. The direction of the dipole layer is aligned with the built-in potential, which results in a reinforced built-in potential across the device. Consequently, the incorporation of the PFBTBr interfacial dipole layer forms a strong electrical field, which can not only enhance Vbi, but also facilitate the charge transport and extraction.
In order to understand the influence of the morphology of the interfacial layer on the photovoltaic properties of PSCs, the morphologies of the PFBTBr layer prepared by spin-coating the PFBTBr solution with different concentrations were investigated by AFM. Devices A, B, C, D, and E were fabricated by spin-coating 0.1 mg mL−1, 0.25 mg mL−1, 0.5 mg mL−1, 1 mg mL−1 and 2 mg mL−1 of the PFBTBr solution at 4000 rpm on the active layer, respectively. The performance of devices with varied concentrations is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3. When the concentration of the PFBTBr solution is reduced from 2 mg mL−1 to 0.5 mg mL−1, a significant enhancement in fill factor (FF) from 39.6% to 61.5% and Jsc from 9.2 mA cm−2 to 10.1 mA cm−2 is observed, while Voc remains steady at 0.63 V. As a result, PCE increased from 2.3% to 3.9%. When the concentration of the PFBTBr solution is less than 0.5 mg mL−1, the decrease in concentration resulted in a drop in FF from 61.5% to 58.2% and Voc from 0.63 V to 0.60 V. The device with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 exhibits the best performance: Voc: 0.63 V, Jsc: 10.1 mA cm−2, FF: 61.5%, and PCE: 3.9%.

Fig. 4 shows the AFM topographic images of the PFBTBr layer prepared by PFBTBr solutions at different concentrations. It can be seen that when the concentration of PFBTBr is 2 mg mL−1, a dense and homogeneous PFBTBr layer with nanoscale morphology is observed. With the decrease in concentration to 1 mg mL−1 and 0.5 mg mL−1, the size and distribution density of the pores increase. When the concentration is further decreased to 0.2 mg mL−1 and 0.1 mg mL−1, the PFBTBr layer is too thin to cover the surface of the active layer. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness values of the PFBTBr interfacial layers with different concentrations are also listed in Table 3. The RMS values of PFBTBr layers increase as the concentration decreases from 2 mg mL−1 to 0.5 mg mL−1, and decrease as the concentration keeps going down to 0.1 mg mL−1, which is consistent with the trend of the size and distribution density of pores on the surface. When the concentration is 0.5 mg mL−1, the RMS reaches the maximum value of 1.756; simultaneously, the AFM image also shows the biggest pore size and distribution density. To sum up, the performance of the PSC is strongly dependent on the coverage of the PFBTBr layer. When the coverage decreases, Jsc and FF increase from 9.2 mA cm−2 to 10.1 mA cm−2 and from 39.6% to 61.5 and then drop to 9.9 mA cm−2 and 58.2%, respectively, while the Voc only decreases slightly. When the concentration is 0.5 mg mL−1, there is an optimal trade-off between the PFBTBr coverage and the pore size/distribution and the PCE of the device reached 3.9%.
The interfacial contact quality can be reflected by the values of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the PSCs. It is known that the existence of contact resistance and charge recombination at the interface are the major factors that give rise to the increase in Rs and a drop in Rsh, respectively. It has been reported that Rsh and Rs can be independently calculated from the inverse slope of the J–V curves of the device at I = Isc (V = 0) and V = Voc (I = 0), respectively. The Rs and Rsh values of devices with the PFBTBr layer prepared from solutions at different concentrations are also listed in Table 3. When the concentration of the PFBTBr layer rises from 0.1 mg mL−1 to 0.5 mg mL−1, the Rs decreases from 142.69 to 132.84 and the Rsh stays steady. The stable Rsh indicates that the PFBTBr layer effectively suppresses the leakage current at the interface between the active layer and Al, which can also be demonstrated from the dark J–V curve.
The decreased Rs results from the improved electron collection and transportation caused by the PFBTBr layer. When the concentration of the PFBTBr solution exceeded 0.5 mg mL−1, there was a dramatic increase in Rs and decrease in Rsh. It is probable that the PFBTBr layer prepared by the solution with 2 mg mL−1 is too dense, leading to the formation of an insulated interface between the active layer and Al. In summary, the morphology of the PFBTBr layer plays a direct, important role in the contact quality between the active layer and the PFBTBr interfacial layer, which strongly affects the performance of devices. When an optimal trade-off between PFBTBr coverage and pore size/distribution is achieved, the PFBTBr layer resulted in a better contact between the active layer and the PFBTBr layer, which effectively lowers the contact resistance and caused a high efficiency of the device.
In order to investigate the interaction between the PFBTBr layer and the Al cathode, XPS analysis is performed on the PFBTBr layer and the PFBTBr layer with a 3 nm thermally evaporated Al layer. Fig. 5 presents N 1s and S 2p spectra of pristine PFBTBr and PFBTBr with aluminum. As demonstrated from the peak-fitting of the N 1s spectra (Fig. 5a), there are two species of nitrogen in pristine PFBTBr, namely in the benzothiadiazole (N1) and quaternary ammonium units (N2). After Al deposition, the peak of N1 in benzothiadiazole is drastically decreased and the peak of N2 in quaternary ammonium still existed. In addition, the sulfur 2p spectrum of pristine PFBTBr exhibits two species of sulfur in PFBTBr, namely in the thiophene and benzothiadiazole units. The peaks of S in thiophene and benzothiadiazole almost disappeared and a peak of S(VI) appeared. The N 1s and S 2p spectra indicated that the thiophene and benzothiadiazole units in PFBTBr are damaged after the deposition of the Al. As we know, Al is the most commonly used electrode material in solar cells, which is generally deposited by thermal evaporation. However, the thermally deposited hot aluminum atoms may react with the polymer and oxygen species remaining in the vacuum chamber and diffuse into the organic layers. Logdlund et al. and Antoniadis et al. demonstrated that the instability of the Al electrode is related to the Al–C bond formation, which interrupts the pi-conjugated systems. Kouji Suemori et al. reported that the possible metal diffusion into the active layer during the thermal deposition process would result in increased leakage current and low shunt resistance, and therefore limits the leakage current, low shunt resistance and PCE. During the thermal evaporation under a low vacuum (the base pressure around 1 × 10−4 mbar), some residual oxygen species still existed in the chamber, and hot aluminum species were perceived to react with the oxygen, thiophene and benzothaidiazole units in PFBTBr molecules. It is plausibly speculated that PFBTBr may serve as a protective agent for the active layer against Al-induced degradation, since it prevents hot aluminum atoms from diffusing into and damaging the active layer.

In conclusion, a new conjugated polyelectrolyte, PFBTBr, is synthesized and incorporated as a cathode interfacial layer in bulk heterojunction solar cells based on P3HT and PC61BM. EFM measurements show an interfacial dipole layer formed by the PFBTBr layer, which enhances Vbi and increases the charge transport and extraction. AFM measurements of PFBTBr layers with varied concentration show that the morphology of the PFBTBr layer strongly affects the performance of devices. When the concentration of the PFBTBr solution is 0.5 mg mL−1, the pores and coverage in the PFBTBr layer get balanced, the Rs reduces and Rsh increases, and the performance of PSCs is optimized. XPS measurements indicate that PFBTBr may react with hot aluminum atoms and oxygen instead of the active layer and serve as a protective agent for the active layer against Al-induced degradation. As a result, the introduction of the PFBTBr layer as an interfacial layer drastically increased the Voc from 0.51 V to 0.63 V, Jsc from 9 mA cm−2 to 10.1 mA cm−2, FF from 53.3% to 61.5% and the PCE from 2.4% to 3.9% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2.
