Herein, we employ a simple star-shaped hole-transporting material (HTM) consisting of a carbazole core and triphenylamine side arms, termed LD29, in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). LD29 exhibits a deep HOMO level of −5.24 eV, a high hole mobility of 1.72 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a relatively high glass-transition temperature of 121 °C, as well as good film-forming ability. PSCs using dopant-free LD29 as the HTM layer exhibit a maximum efficiency of 14.29%. Promisingly, when LD29 is doped, a champion efficiency over 18% has been achieved, which is even comparable with that of the conventional doped spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the laboratory synthesis cost for LD29 is significantly lower than that for spiro-OMeTAD. Importantly, the PSC performance does not change greatly with the concentration of LD29 regardless of whether the dopants are used, which has the potential to further reduce material usage. The device employing LD29 also shows comparable stability to that employing spiro-OMeTAD. Consequently, our results provide an important step forward for the commercialized application of PSCs.

In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have drawn global attention as light-absorbing materials in photovoltaic devices due to their direct bandgaps, long hole/electron diffusion lengths, and high charge-carrier mobility. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising photovoltaic technology because of their dramatic increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from an initial value of 3.8% to a current value of over 23% in the past few years. The rapidly improved PCE also resulted from the application of hole-transporting materials (HTMs), which facilitate hole extraction and migration, prevent internal charge recombination and enhance stability. So far, the most used HTM is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). However, spiro-OMeTAD has many drawbacks for the commercialized application of PSCs, including: (1) high costs for synthesis and purification; (2) relatively low hole mobility; (3) requirements of many dopants, such as Li-TSFI, TBP and cobalt complexes; and (4) high thickness, typically about 200 nm, to get high performance, resulting in more material usage. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop efficient and low-cost candidates for replacement of spiro-OMeTAD. To date, lots of organic HTMs have been applied in PSCs, including polymer HTMs and small-molecule HTMs. Small-molecule HTMs have some advantages compared with polymers, such as simple structures, easy modification and purification, and smaller batch-to-batch variations. Therefore, lots of small-molecule HTMs have been developed, such as triphenylamine derivatives, thiophene derivatives, phthalocyanine derivatives, etc. However, some of the reported small-molecule HTMs still suffer inferior performance, relatively bad stability or need lots of dopants when used in PSCs.

Herein, we introduce a novel small-molecule compound (LD29) as a HTM for PSCs, and the chemical structures of it and spiro-OMeTAD are displayed in Fig. 1. Characterizations reveal that LD29 has a suitable HOMO level for effective hole transfer in PSCs, high hole mobility, good film-forming ability and good thermal stability. When used in PSCs, dopant-free LD29 exhibits a maximum PCE of 14.29%. After doping with Li-TFSI, TBP and FK209, the champion PCE is improved to 18.04%, which is even comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD. The synthesis cost of LD29 in the lab is far lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD and most of the reported alternatives (shown in ESI). Most importantly, the PSC performance did not change with the concentration of LD29 regardless of whether the dopants are used. Therefore, our results provide a significant step forward for the commercialized application of PSCs.

In the following, we examine the optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, conductivity, and hole mobility of LD29, and compare with those of spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions. Meanwhile, we also study the dopant-free or doped LD29, and the influence of concentration on the performance in PSCs.


Fig. 2 exhibits the UV-vis absorption spectra of LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD in dichloromethane solution, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. The absorption peak for LD29 is located at 337 nm, which depicts weaker absorption in the visible region compared with spiro-OMeTAD, illustrating it does not compete greatly with the perovskite for light harvesting in PSC devices. The photoluminescence emission spectra of LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD display an emission center at 428 nm and 429 nm with a Stokes shift of 91 nm and 43 nm, respectively, indicating that LD29 would undergo larger conformational changes in the excited state. Moreover, the optical band gap (Eg) estimated from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra (Eg = 1240/λintersection) is 3.31 and 3.01 eV for LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of LD29 and reference spiro-OMeTAD are recorded by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements to evaluate the energy levels, as displayed in Fig. 3. The DPV curves of LD29 and spiro-OMeATD depict first oxidation peaks of +0.57 V and +0.40 V, and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the external standard is located at +0.44 V. Therefore, the HOMO level of LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD is estimated at −5.24 eV and −5.07 eV, respectively. The valence band of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is −5.65 eV, suggesting that LD29 is favorable for hole transfer. Moreover, the HOMO level of LD29 is obviously lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting that higher Voc values of the prepared PSCs may be obtained compared to the PSC with spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the LUMO energy level of LD29 is calculated to be −1.93 eV from Eg on the basis of the equation: ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg. The significantly higher LUMO level of LD29 than the conduction band of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (−3.92 eV) can inhibit electron migration to the counter electrode. Thus, LD29 can act as a both hole-transport and electron-blocking layer in PSCs.
The hole mobility and conductivity of LD29 are measured to estimate its ability as a HTM. The hole mobilities of LD29 and reference spiro-OMeTAD are evaluated by the space charge limitation of current (SCLC) method. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4a; the hole mobilities of dopant-free LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD are 1.72 × 10−5 and 1.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The conductivities of them are measured with a device of FTO/HTM/Au; obtained J–V curves are illustrated in Fig. 4b. The estimated conductivities of doped LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD are 9.65 × 10−6 and 6.23 × 10−6 S cm−1. The relatively high hole mobility of LD29 may positively affect the performance of the PSCs.
We further employ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements to evaluate the thermal stability of LD29. As shown in Fig. 5, LD29 exhibits a high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 121 °C, which is comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD (122 °C).
The hole transfer ability of LD29 is further studied by using steady-state photoluminescence (TIPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and compared with spiro-OMeTAD. Doped LD29 and doped spiro-OMeTAD are coated on the perovskite films (deposited on glass substrates), which is the same as the PSC fabrication process. Theoretically, the effective quenching and reduction of the TRPL decay time (τe) in perovskite/HTM bilayer films mean hole transfer from the conduction band of the perovskite into the HOMO level of the HTM.
In TIPL measurements, the excitation wavelength is 473 nm. In corresponding TRPL measurements, the excitation wavelength is located at 445 nm, and we monitored at 765 nm. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the quenching values of perovskite/HTM bilayer films are 87% and 89% for doped LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD. The TRPL curves (Fig. 6b) show that the τe values are: 22.1 ns for pristine perovskite, 3.80 ns for perovskite/LD29 (doped), and 2.77 ns for perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, the results illustrate that LD29 exhibits comparable hole extraction ability to spiro-OMeTAD.
During development of LD29 and fabrication of corresponding PSC devices, we find that it has good solubility in commonly used solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane and so on. Therefore, we further study the film morphology of LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD deposited on the perovskite layer by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), both of the perovskite layers spin-coated with LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD films exhibit a uniform and smooth capping layer. Therefore, LD29 can create fine interfacial contact of perovskite/HTM/Au, which is comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD.
In order to further confirm the possibility of LD29 acting as a HTM for PSCs and compare with spiro-OMeTAD, conventional (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based mesoscopic PSCs are fabricated through a one-step solvent engineering method. The detailed fabrication procedure is also given in the Experimental section. The device architecture is outlined in Fig. 7a, and the corresponding energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 7b.
We studied in detail the influence of dopants and concentration of LD29 on the performance of corresponding PSCs. Each group of PSCs with different HTMs contains 5 independent samples. The photovoltaic properties of PSCs were measured under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), and their detailed parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves and parameters of best-performing devices are shown in Fig. 8a and summarized in Table 2. The best device with dopant-free LD29 shows a PCE of 14.29%, together with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 19.60 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71. When LD29 is used with dopants (TBP, Li-TFSI and FK209), the performance the PSCs exhibits an obvious improvement, which is in agreement with lots of reported HTMs. As shown in Fig. 8a, the PCE of the best device with doped LD29 reaches a promising 18.04%. Under the same conditions, doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a PCE of 18.25%, which demonstrates the application potential of LD29 for high-performance PSCs. Importantly, as shown in Fig. 8b, it can be found that the concentration of LD29 has a minor influence on the device performance regardless of whether dopants exist. The results demonstrate good reproducibility of LD29 as a HTM for PSCs, and LD29 also has the potential to further reduce material usage.

As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI), the hysteresis behaviors of the devices based on doped LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD are similar to each other. The main reasons for hysteresis behavior of our devices may be charge trapping, ferroelectric polarization and ion migration. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the best cells employing doped LD29 and doped spiro-OMeTAD are displayed in Fig. 8c. There is no great difference in the range of 400–750 nm, which further indicates that doped LD29 has comparable hole extraction ability to that of spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, the IPCE values also coincide well with J–V measurements. Impedance spectroscopy of the PSCs with pristine LD29, doped LD29 and doped spiro-OMeTAD is performed to further understand the effect of HTMs on recombination processes. The concentrations of pristine LD29, doped LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD are 20, 60, and 73 mg mL−1. The devices are measured at 1.0 V forward bias in the dark. In general, the arc in Nyquist plots is ascribed to the chemical capacitance of the ETM/perovskite/HTM interface and recombination resistance (Rrec). As shown in the inset of Fig. S3 (ESI), the fitting results are obtained by an equivalent circuit. The pristine LD29-based device shows the minimum Rrec value; by contrast, the devices with doped LD29 and doped spiro-OMeTAD show similar values. Except for the HTMs, the other influencing factors of the PSCs are identical, therefore, larger Rrec values mean the interface with doped HTMs can reduce the carrier recombination better than that of pristine LD29, thus showing better device performance.
Interestingly, we found that light-soaking plays an important role in improving the performance of dopant-free LD29-based devices during measurement of the J–V curves. As illustrated in Fig. 8d and Table S3 (ESI), the PCE of the dopant-free LD29-based PSC gradually improved due to the improved FF and saturated after around 6 minutes with continuous light soaking. As shown in conductivity measurements, light soaking exhibits negligible influence on dopant-free LD29. Moreover, after the devices with dopant-free LD29 are stored for 1 day under dark conditions, the light soaking still exhibits a similar influence on performance enhancement. Therefore, we speculate that the photoinduced doping of LD29 upon light exposure could be the main reason for the above results. Besides, we do not find that light soaking shows any additional effect on the performance of devices based on doped LD29.
The long-term stability of the devices with doped LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD is also measured. The devices were stored in a dry box under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI), the devices with doped HTMs show obvious performance degradation, which mainly resulted from the corrosion effect of dopants. The devices with doped LD29 or doped spiro-OMeTAD show an obvious reduction in PCE, which may result from the instability of the perovskite and hygroscopicity of doped HTMs (Fig. S5, ESI). Moreover, the retained PCEs of the devices with LD29 and spiro-OMeTAD are also similar to each other after 30 days. As shown in Tables S4–S6 (ESI), we also estimated the synthesis and purification cost of LD29 in the lab according to previous reports. The cost of LD29 is around $30 g−1, which is significantly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (about $90–500 g−1). As shown in Tables S7 and S8 (ESI), LD29 also has a lower cost than most of the reported HTMs. The results further demonstrate that LD29 would be a promising candidate for replacement of spiro-OMeTAD.

In summary, we have developed a facile HTM, that is LD29, which has excellent optoelectronic, electrochemical, and carrier mobility properties. The PSCs using dopant-free LD29 exhibit a PCE of 14.29%. Promisingly, a maximum PCE over 18% can be achieved when LD29 is doped with commonly used dopants, comparable with that of the PSC employing spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions. The laboratory synthesis cost for LD29 is significantly lower than that for high-purity spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the concentration changes of LD29 exhibit a small influence on the performance, regardless of whether the dopants are used, therefore, LD29 has the potential to further reduce material usage. The device with LD29 also shows comparable stability to that of spiro-OMeTAD. The results prove that the new HTM has significant potential to replace spiro-OMeTAD.


The PSC devices were fabricated according to the reported method. FTO glass plates were washed using an ultrasonic bath, deionized water and acetone. The compact TiO2 layer were deposited on the FTO by the spray pyrolysis method at 430 °C using a precursor solution of 0.6 mL titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 6 mL anhydrous isopropanol. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the above substrates by spin-coating of diluted particle TiO2 pastes (Dyesol 30NR-T, 1:5 w/w diluted in ethanol) at 5500 rpm for 20 s, then heated at 510 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the perovskite film was deposited by spin-coating the precursor solution through a single step procedure. The perovskite precursor solution included PbBr2 (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), and FAI (1 M) dissolved in a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO (800 μL, v/v = 1:4). The spin-coating procedure was performed first at 1500 rpm for 10 s, and second at 5000 rpm for 30 s. ∼90 μL chlorobenzene was dripped on spinning substrates in the process of the second spin-coating step 15 s after the start of the procedure. The obtained film was immediately sintered at 100 °C for 1.5 h on a hotplate. After cooling to R.T., the HTM layer was spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The HTMs were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (LD29: 20–60 mg mL−1, spiro-OMeTAD: 73 mg mL−1) with 5–20 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 5–13 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile). Finally, a layer of ∼60 nm Au counter electrode was deposited on top of the obtained film using thermal evaporation.


The used characterizations also can be found in our previous papers, and the detailed test methods are shown as follows. The UV-vis spectra of HTMs were measured on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (U3900H, Hitachi, Japan). Cyclic voltammetry was performed with a CHI660d electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., China). A normal three electrode system was used and contained a calomel reference electrode (SCE) in saturated KCl solution, a platinum working electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. The redox potential of them was measured in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate at 50 mV s−1 (vs. Fc/Fc+ as an external reference). The glass transition temperature (Tg) was obtained by using differential scanning calorimetry (Q2000, TA Instruments-Waters LLC, USA) with a scan rate of 20 °C min−1 under N2 flow. The PL measurements were performed on a fluorescence detector (QM400, Photo Technology International, USA) with a 450 W xenon CW lamp and a pulsed nitrogen laser. The current–voltage characteristics of PSCs were obtained under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination and measured under a 3A grade solar simulator (94043A, Newport, USA). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined with a QE/IPCE measurement kit (Newport, USA). The morphologies of the samples were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020, Hitachi, Japan). The moisture resistance of HTMs was measured on a contact angle tester (METATEST E3-300).
