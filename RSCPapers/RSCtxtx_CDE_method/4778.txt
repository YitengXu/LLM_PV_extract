A novel thiophene-fused diketopyrrolopyrrole unit (7H-pyrrolo[3,4-a]thieno[3,2-g]indolizine-7,10(9H)-dione, PTI) has been designed as an electron acceptor with the 4,4′-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) unit as a donor to construct a new kind of A–D–A molecule (DTS–2TPTI) for solution-processed solar cells. DTS–2TPTI exhibits excellent thermal stability with the decomposition temperature over 400 °C and shows strong absorption from 550 to 750 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient. The optical band gap (Eg) estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film is about 1.44 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of DTS–2TPTI determined from CV is about −4.99 eV. Through optimizing the photovoltaic performances of devices, the DTS–2TPTI/PC71BM-based solution processed bulk-heterojunction solar cell with 0.5% DIO as a solvent additive exhibits the best photovoltaic performance with a JSC of 11.28 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.64 V, FF of 59.5% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.28%, indicating that the PTI unit can act as an efficient acceptor moiety to construct D–A small molecules for OPVs.

Over the past decade, solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively researched due to their light-weight, low-cost, solution-processing to form large-area and flexible devices. By optimizing polymer materials and device structure, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs over 9% has been achieved. Meanwhile, solution-processed small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have emerged as a competitive alterative to their polymer counterparts due to some promising advantages, including (1) uniform and well-defined molecular structure, resulting in less batch-to-batch variation; (2) facile control of energy levels via delicate chemical structure design; (3) generally intrinsic high mobility and open circuit voltage (VOC).

In recent years, an enormous amount of progress has been made to improve the PCE of SMOSCs from 4–6% to higher than 8%. Recently, the best PCE of 9.95% has been achieved that is comparable with the best performance of PSCs. There are four major types of SMOSCs, including (1) star-shaped molecules such as based on triphenylamine; (2) oligothiophene and its derivatives end-capped with electron-deficient units, such as alkyl cyanoacetate and 3-ethylrhodanine; (3) dithienosilole and pyridy[2,1,3]-thiadiazole based bow-shaped molecules; (4) donor–acceptor type small molecules based on the DPP (diketopyrrolopyrrole, that is 7H-pyrrolo[3,4-a]thieno[3,2-g]indolizine-7,10(9H)-dione) unit and other acceptor units.
Among these materials, DPP based small molecules have been widely investigated because of their strong electron-withdrawing ability, excellent charge carrier motilities, strong light absorption and facile synthesis and structural modification. SMOSCs using DPP as an acceptor combined with different donors such as benzodithiophene, benzofuran and naphthodithiophene show desirable photovoltaic performances, yielding PCE from 4% to 6%, especially BDTT–2DPP. To the best of our knowledge, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) have been proved to be the best donor molecules in PSCs and SMOSCs due to their well-coplanar and moderate electron-donating ability. Though DPP–BDTT shows perfect photovoltaic performances, DPP–DTS based small molecules are rarely researched and less than satisfactory.
In this paper, a novel thiophene fused DPP unit (7H-pyrrolo[3,4-a]thieno[3,2-g]indolizine-7,10(9H)-dione, PTI, as shown in Fig. 1) has been designed as an electron acceptor to build a D–A molecule with DTS for SMOSCs. Compared with thiophene substituted DPP, the fusion of a thiophene ring via a carbon–carbon double bond into a DPP unit extends the conjugation backbone and strengthens the molecular co-planarity that is beneficial to the charge transportation and light absorption. Also, it can retain good solubility in common organic solvents through introducing a long-chain alkyl group at a nitrogen atom. Here, we report the synthesis of a new kind of A–D–A small molecule (DTS–2TPTI) based on PTI and DTS units, and present the photovoltaic performances of solution-processed small molecule solar cells based on DTS–2TPTI as a donor material blending with (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor material and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. The optimized photovoltaic device exhibits a relatively high PCE of 4.28% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 11.28 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.64 V and fill factor (FF) of 59.5%.

The synthetic routes for TPTI and DTS–2TPTI are outlined in Scheme 1. As shown, 2-(2,2-diethoxyethyl)-5-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (2) was obtained from the N-alkylation of 3,6-bis-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione with 2-ethylhexyl bromide and bromoacetaldehyde diethylacetal, respectively. Via an intramolecular Friedel–Crafts-type reaction of compound 2, the thiophene fused DPP unit (PTI) was constructed to yield 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-8-(thiophen-2-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[3,4-a]thieno[3,2-g]indole-zine-7,10(9H)-dione (TPTI) (3). And then, the bromination of 3 generated 8-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-9-(2-ethylhexyl)-7H-pyrrolo[3,4-a]thieno[3,2-g]indolizine-7,10(9H)-dione (4). Through the Stille coupling reaction of compounds 4 and 5, DTS–2TPTI was afforded in 60% yield.

All the compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, ESI-MS or TOF-MS and elemental analysis. DTS–2TPTI can be soluble in some common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties of DTS–2TPTI were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It exhibits excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) over 400 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 2.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DTS–2TPTI in chloroform (CF) and in thin film are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, in solution DTS–2TPTI shows a broad and strong absorption in the range of 550–750 nm with a maximum absorption at 696 nm and the molar absorption coefficient reaches 9.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1. This can be attributed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer. In the thin film state, the maximum absorption is almost the same as that in solution. However, the film absorption is greatly broadened with a larger full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 209 nm than that of 126 nm in solution. Moreover, an obvious shoulder emerges at a red-shifted wavelength of around 750 nm, indicating the presence of strong molecular self-organization with J-aggregate formation, very similar to those observed in the analogues BDTT–2DPP and DTS–2DPP. The optical band gap (Eg) estimated from the absorption edge (860 nm) of the thin film is about 1.44 eV, suggesting that it is a narrow-band gap semi-conductor.
In addition, it is found that DTS–2TPTI shows more red-shifted absorption and higher molar absorption coefficient than the analogue DTS–2DPP containing thiophene substituted DPP unit. This result indicates that the fusion of the thiophene ring into the DPP unit through a carbon–carbon double bond can improve the light-harvesting properties of DTS–2TPTI due to the extension of the conjugation length and enforcement of the molecular co-planarity.
To investigate the electrochemical properties of DTS–2TPTI and estimate its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a platinum disk as a working electrode and a silver wire as a reference electrode. Fig. 4 shows its cyclic voltammogram, which was obtained in a 0.1 M Bu4N·PF6 acetonitrile solution at room temperature under argon with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and calibrated against an internal standard of ferrocene (Fc) with the ionization (IP) value of −4.8 eV for the Fc/Fc+ redox system below the vacuum level. The formal potential of Fc was measured to be 0.46 eV against the Ag electrode. As can be seen, it exhibits irreversible oxidative behavior with the onset oxidation potential of about 0.65 V. Therefore, its HOMO energy level can be estimated to be −4.99 eV according to the formula EHOMO/eV = −e(Eox + 4.34). The LUMO energy level is about −3.55 eV coming from the difference between the optical band gap of 1.44 eV and the corresponding HOMO energy level.
A solution processed small-molecule organic solar cell based on DTS–2TPTI as a donor material blending with PC71BM as an acceptor material was fabricated with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DTS–2TPTI:PC71BM/Ca/Al to evaluate its photovoltaic performances, in which chloroform was used as the spin-coating solvent. The corresponding results of the photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. To balance the absorbance and the charge transporting network of the photoactive layer, different weight ratios of DTS–2TPTI and PC71BM were chosen for optimization. It seems that the 1:1.5 D–A ratio is the optimal ratio to afford a maximum PCE of 2.19% with JSC of 6.20 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.58 V and FF of 54.2%. Obviously, the low VOC is closely related to its relatively high HOMO energy level.

In order to further improve the photovoltaic performances, different amounts of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) of 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5% and 0.6% were added as a processing additive to optimize the morphology of the active layer. As shown in Table 1, when 0.5% DIO was used, not only the JSC and FF were greatly improved, but the VOC was also enhanced. Generally, the addition of less volatile solvent additives such as DIO selectively solubilizes the PCBM component, which results in the aggregation of the donor materials during the film drying process and leads to the formation of more highly ordered D–A phases, thus improving the device performances. However, in this process, the VOC is usually slightly decreased after the addition of DIO owing to the aggregation of the donor materials. Interestingly, in our work the VOC was not sacrificed, but increased a little. This similar phenomenon has also been observed in some other recent work.

Fig. 5a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based on DTS–2TPTI/PC71BM with different D/A ratios (D/A = 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:1.5 (0.5% DIO), respectively) under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. An optimized device of 1:1.5 D/A ratio with 0.5% DIO shows the best PCE of 4.28%, VOC of 0.64 V, JSC of 11.28 mA cm−2 and FF of 59.5%. Especially, the VOC is increased from 0.58 to 0.63 V when DIO was used. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of an optimized device of 1:1.5 D/A ratio with 0.5% DIO as well as three different D/A ratios without DIO was also tested. As shown in Fig. 5b, all of them exhibit a broad response from 300 to 850 nm, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption in the film. Clearly, the addition of a 0.5% DIO to 1:1.5 D/A ratio blend leads to the great increment of the EQE. The maximum EQE reached 45% at 500 nm.
Hole mobilities of DTS–2TPTI/PC71BM (1:1.5 ratio) films spin-coated from CF solution without and with DIO (0.5%) were evaluated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that the hole mobility of 2.33 × 10−5 cm2 A−1 s−1 for the DTS–2TPTI/PC71BM film containing DIO (0.5%) is about 2.5 times higher than that without DIO (μh = 8.90 × 10−6 cm2 A−1 s−1). This implies that the addition of DIO improves the crystallization and molecular ordering in the blended film. The higher hole mobility is beneficial to the charge transport in the thin film that will improve the JSC of the OPV device.
The surface morphology of DTS–2TPTI/PC71BM blended (1:1.5) films without and with 0.5% DIO spin-coated from CF was studied by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 7. The blended film without DIO shows a very smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.76 nm, indicating the presence of poor donor–acceptor phase separation. After addition of 0.5% DIO additive, the RMS roughness of the DTS–2TPTI/PC71BM blended film increases to 2.76 nm. At the same time, a rather large cluster-like domain is observed from the AFM image (Fig. 6d), meaning better phase separation, which is favorable for the exciton separation and charge transportation, offering preferable PCE.

A novel thiophene fused DPP unit (PTI) has been designed as an electron acceptor with the DTS donor to build a new kind of A–D–A small molecule (DTS–2TPTI). Due to the extension of the conjugation backbone and enforcement of the molecular coplanarity, DTS–2TPTI exhibits strong and broad absorption spectra with a narrow band gap of Eg = 1.44 eV. The optimized solution processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on DTS–2TPTI blending with PC71BM and DIO exhibit the best power conversion efficiency (PCEmax) of 4.28% with a JSC of 11.28 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.64 V and FF of 59.5%. This implies that PTI can act as a strong acceptor to construct low band gap D–A molecules for highly efficient SMOSCs. However, the relatively high HOMO level is unfavorable for improving VOC. The structural modification needs to be further optimized to enhance VOC and improve the PCE of PTI-based small molecules, which has been under progress.



1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer in CDCl3 and CD3COCD3 using tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. ESI-MS analysis was performed on a Finnigan-LCQ advantage mass spectrometer and MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer 155 mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out on a 73 CARLOERBA-1106 microelemental analyzer. The thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a NETZSCH STA449C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 cm3 min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on a CHI voltammetric analyzer at room temperature in CH3CN containing 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, using a platinum disc as a working electrode and a silver wire as a quasi-reference electrode. The potentials were determined using ferrocene as a reference. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. The film morphology was characterized with an atomic force microscope (SPA-400) in the tapping mode.


Bulk heterojunction small molecule solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DTS–2TPTI:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 30 min. A thin layer (40 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was then spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 25 min. The mixture of DTS–2TPTI:PC71BM in chloroform solvent (10 mg mL−1 for DTS–2TPTI, 15 mg mL−1 for PC71BM) with or without additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) was spin-coated on a PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer. Calcium (ca. 20 nm) and aluminum layers (ca. 80 nm) were then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The thickness of the DTS–2TPTI:PC71BM layer was measured using a Profilometer (Ambios Tech. XP-2). The J–V curve was measured using a computer-controlled B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (Agilent Technologies). An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM 1.5 G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

The hole mobility was measured using the architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DTS–2TPTI:PC71BM/Au. And the mobility was calculated by fitting the dark J–V curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).

The solvents and chemicals were obtained commercially and used without further purification unless stated otherwise. Toluene was distilled from a sodium–potassium alloy under nitrogen prior to use. Compound 1 and compound 5 were synthesized according to the literature.

The flask was vacuumized and then filled with Ar, which was repeated twice to guarantee an argon atmosphere. Then toluene (10 mL) was added. The mixture was refluxed for 48 h and then cooled to room temperature. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the crude product was chromatographed through silica gel using dichloromethane/EtOAc (25:1) as an eluent to give the DTS–2TPTI black solid in a yield of 60% (0.13 g). 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ ppm): 8.80 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 1H), 7.81 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 1H), 7.32 (s, 1H), 7.17 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 1H), 7.08 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H), 6.80 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 4.05 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 2H), 1.97 (m, 1H), 1.56 (m, 7H), 1.40 (m, 15H), 1.09 (m, 2H), 0.91 (m, 7H). 13C-NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 160.01, 155.92, 149.05, 145.47, 145.41, 142.67, 142.24, 141.26, 138.15, 136.68, 133.85, 133.74, 127.90, 127.82, 124.20, 124.17, 122.92, 107.17, 106.12, 98.61, 45.98, 39.22, 38.13, 35.95, 35.70, 31.22, 30.43, 29.69, 28.91, 28.65, 23.74, 23.09, 17.61, 14.16, 10.88, 10.65. MS (MALDI-TOF): calculated for C72H82N4O4S6Si, 1286.44; found: 1287.3 (M + H+). Anal. calcd for C72H82N4O4S6Si (%): C, 67.14; H, 6.42; N, 4.35. Found (%): C, 67.13; H, 6.64; N, 4.36.
