Molybdenum carbide nanotubes (Mo2C-NTs) were synthesized and showed remarkable catalytic activity for regeneration of an organic sulfide redox shuttle. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using Mo2C-NTs as the counter electrode (CE) showed a high power conversion efficiency of 6.22%, which is much higher than the DSCs using a conventional Pt CE (3.91%).

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have received increasing attention due to their specific strengths such as simple fabrication procedures, environmental friendliness, transparency, good plasticity, and ease of building combination. In addition to the key components such as the semiconductor and dye, great advancements have also made in the other two components, the counter electrode (CE) catalyst and redox shuttle. In the DSCs system, the CE functions as a catalyst, being responsible for the regeneration of the redox shuttle. Therefore the CE and redox shuttle relate to each other closely. Pt deposited on conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass is commonly used as an effective CE. However the limited availability and high cost of Pt restricts its application in industry. I−/I3− is a widely used redox shuttle, however, this redox shuttle has the disadvantages of absorbing short-wave light and being highly corrosive, which are potential adverse factors for long-term use.

Given the disadvantages of the Pt CE and I−/I3− redox shuttle, exploration of low-cost and Pt-free catalysts and iodide-free redox shuttles has become a hot research topic in the DSCs field. It has been established that early transition metal carbides (TMCs) showed Pt-like behavior. Recently, we applied economical molybdenum carbide as the CE in an I−/I3− electrolyte based DSCs which produced a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.83%; this is lower than a Pt CE based DSCs (7.50%). Regarding redox shuttles, several iodide-free redox shuttles have been developed for DSCs to replace the defective I−/I3− redox shuttle, such as the organic sulfide redox shuttle of 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole N-tetramethylammonium salt/di-5-(1-methyltetrazole) disulfide (denoted as T−/T2 for short). This T−/T2 based electrolyte has the merits of transparency and low viscosity. Interestingly, we and another group found that Pt was not suitable for the regeneration of the T−/T2 redox shuttle. Thus the development of new CE catalysts for the new redox shuttle is urgent. In this work, Mo2C particles (Mo2C-Ps) and Mo2C nanotubes (Mo2C-NTs) were synthesized for the T−/T2 redox shuttle for the first time. As a result, the prepared Mo2C, Mo2C-NTs especially, showed remarkable catalytic activity for T−/T2 regeneration, far surpassing expensive Pt.
First, Mo2C-Ps were synthesized via a urea glass route with MoCl5 used as the metal source and urea as the carbon source. In brief, an appropriate amount of MoCl5 was added to absolute ethanol to form Mo-orthoester. Then, an amount of urea was added to the Mo-orthoester to form urea–metal precursors. After removing the residual ethanol solvent and sintering the urea–metal precursor, Mo2C-Ps were achieved. In order to achieve Mo2C-NTs, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was used as the metal source and phenylamine as the carbon source. In this experiment, the pH value should be strictly controlled at 4–5 to achieve the wire-like precursor (Fig. S1, ESI). After sintering the precursor, Mo2C-NTs were collected. The XRD patterns in Fig. 1 indicate that Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs were synthesized successfully (no. 11-0680, PDF-2 database). For the Mo2C-NTs synthesized at 750 °C, the diffraction peak showed a low intensity, implying a weak crystallinity. In contrast, increasing the sintering temperature from 750 to 1000 °C, Mo2C-NTs with high crystallinity were obtained (Fig. S2, ESI).

Fig. 2 shows the morphologies of the prepared Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs. The Mo2C-Ps interacted strongly and showed a worm-like appearance with an average size of 20–50 nm. In Fig. 2b and Fig. S3 (ESI), the SEM images show that the Mo2C exhibited a typical nanotube profile with a mesoporous structure. Slight aggregation was observed as evidenced by the TEM image (Fig. 2c). The diameters of the Mo2C-NTs synthesized at 750 °C were around 25 nm (Fig. 2d). At a high sintering temperature of 1000 °C, a number of Mo2C-NTs adhered to each other and formed a thick Mo2C-NTs. The diameter increased to 350–500 nm (Fig. S4, ESI). The BET surface areas of the Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs were 18.31 and 43.70 m2 g−1, respectively. XRD, SEM, and TEM confirmed that Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs were synthesized successfully.
As pointed out above, Mo2C-Ps have been used in an I−/I3− electrolyte based DSCs which generated a PCE of 5.83%; this is much lower than a Pt CE based DSC (7.50%). In this work, Mo2C was applied in a T−/T2 electrolyte based DSCs. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). For the T−/T2 redox shuttle, the Mo2C-Ps showed a high catalytic activity and the DSCs gave a PCE of 5.50% (short-circuit current density, Jsc = 13.66 mA cm−2; open-circuit voltage, Voc = 636 mV; fill factor, FF = 0.633). Most impressively, Mo2C-NTs performed better than Mo2C-Ps and the DSCs yielded a higher PCE of 6.22% (Jsc = 14.06 mA cm−2, Voc = 637 mV, and FF = 0.694). In contrast, the DSCs using the Pt CE gave a low PCE of 3.91% (Jsc = 13.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 625 mV, and FF = 0.479). It can be clearly seen that the Jsc and FF of the DSCs using the Mo2C-NTs CE are both higher than the corresponding parameters of the DSCs based on the Pt CE. This shows the fact that the Mo2C CE is more effective than Pt for the organic T−/T2 redox shuttle, rather than the conventional I−/I3− redox shuttle.
To evaluate the catalytic properties of the as-prepared Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs for the T−/T2 redox shuttle, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system. Fig. 3b depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the Pt, Mo2C-Ps, and Mo2C-NTs electrodes. In the case of Pt, a typical pair of redox peaks were observed, representing the redox reaction of T−/T2. On the one hand, the current density of the reduction peak for the Mo2C-NTs was much higher than the Mo2C-Ps and Pt. On the other hand, the oxydic and reductive potentials of the redox peaks of Pt were around −0.40 and 0.49 V, and the peak–peak separation (ΔEP,Pt) was 0.89 V. Compared with Pt, the cathodic peak for the Mo2C-NTs shifted towards a more positive value (−0.22 V), whereas the anodic peak shifted towards a more negative value (0.29 V). Thus, the ΔEP,Mo2C-NTs was only 0.51 V. According to the Nernst equation, the electrode can be recognized as reversible for the T−/T2 redox reaction. Moreover, ΔEP varied inversely with ks (the charge transfer rate). The Mo2C-NT electrode showed a larger ks value than Pt, which was constructive for the high catalytic activity. Similar to the Mo2C-NTs, the Mo2C-Ps also provided a small ΔEP value as well, indicating a good reversibility. Based on an overall consideration of the CV results, it was proven that the Mo2C-NTs and Mo2C-Ps are more effective than Pt for the regeneration of the T−/T2 redox shuttle and the Mo2C-NTs performed the best.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective tool to reveal the charge transfer process and to further evaluate the catalytic activity of a catalyst. Fig. 4a shows the Nyquist plots for the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes. In the case of Pt, the intercept on the real axis can generally be attributed to the series resistance (Rs). The left arch can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (Cμ) of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The right arch can be assigned to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the T−/T2 redox shuttle in the electrolyte. The EIS data were obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots with an equivalent circuit diagram (inset in Fig. 4a), and the fit parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). No obvious difference in the Rs was found for the three electrodes. The Rct values of the Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs were 2.0 and 0.8 Ω, which are much lower than the Rct of Pt (8.1 Ω). This implies that Mo2C has a high catalytic activity for T2 reduction. In addition, the Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs showed low ZN values relative to Pt. Additionally, the ZN of the Mo2C-NTs was much lower than that of the Mo2C-Ps, stemming from the mesoporous structure of the Mo2C-NTs as shown in the TEM images. Both the Rct and ZN demonstrated that the redox reaction between T− and T2 occurred easily on the Mo2C-NTs electrode, followed by the Mo2C-Ps and Pt electrodes. Moreover, Tafel polarization measurements were also applied to reconfirm the catalytic activity of the Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs. Fig. 4b shows the Tafel curves for symmetrical cells similar to the ones used in the EIS measurements. The curves show logarithmic current density as a function of voltage and detailed information about the Tafel curves can be obtained in previous work. The curves of the Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs exhibited a large exchange current density (J0) compared to the Pt electrode. This means that the Mo2C-Ps and Mo2C-NTs have superior catalytic activity for T2 reduction, which is in good accordance with the EIS results. In theory, J0 varies inversely with Rct. According to the EIS results, the tendency of J0 to change for various electrodes is generally in accordance with those presented in the Tafel curve plots. After performing a comprehensive analysis of the EIS and Tafel polarization curve results, we conclude that Mo2C is more suitable than Pt for the T−/T2 redox shuttle and among the two kinds of Mo2C compounds, the behaviour of the nanotubes is undoubtedly better.
In summary, combined with the T−/T2 electrolyte, Mo2C nanotubes were used as a counter electrode catalyst in a DSCs system for the first time. The Mo2C nanotubes gave an impressive catalytic activity and the device yielded a high power conversion efficiency of 6.22%. This is a great enhancement of 59% compared to the Pt CE based DSCs (3.91%). The results reveal that Mo2C nanotubes are a promising alternative to expensive Pt in a DSCs system.
