Precise control of π-bridge segments is of vital importance in the construction of conjugated polymers, which are extensively used in organic solar cells. In this work, three conjugated polymers, P1, P2 and P3, with different asymmetric π-bridges in the main chains, were produced for the first time through a simple one-pot chemical synthesis method. Compared to their symmetric control counterparts (P4 and P5), asymmetric structures show larger dipole moments, strong intermolecular interactions, and regulated energy levels. By blending with the non-fullerene acceptor Y6, the three conjugated polymers based on asymmetric π-bridges exhibited better photovoltaic properties. In particular, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the fill factor (FF) of a P2-based device could reach 16.22% and 74.81%, respectively. In contrast, an inferior PCE of 1.32% is obtained for a symmetric polymer P5-based device. The results reveal that the asymmetric π-bridge strategy is promising for tailoring the backbone configuration of conjugated polymers and improving the photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells.

In the last few decades, with issues such as energy crises and environmental deterioration becoming increasingly severe, organic solar cells (OSCs) with unique advantages, such as lightweight, flexibility and their processability into large-area devices, have been developed in leaps and bounds, with the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) having now reached more than 20%. Typically, a device is prepared by adopting a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure with p-type semiconductors as the donor and n-type semiconductors as the acceptor, where use of the BHJ structure has been proved to be the most effective strategy. Recently, small molecule acceptor materials have witnessed great progress, with their structures and processes being further studied and optimized. Meanwhile, although their development relatively lags, polymer donors show great prospects.

Generally, both the main skeleton design and precise selection of side chains are of vital importance in the construction of high-performance donor materials. Side chains are critical for improving polymer solubility and for influencing molecular stacking. A suitable main skeleton can endow molecules with appropriate charge transport and light absorption properties. In addition, as an important block for constructing the main skeleton, the π-bridge inserted in D–A polymers plays a crucial role in controlling molecular conformation and stacking, as well as photophysical properties. The most common π-bridge units are thiophene, selenophene, thiazole, furan, etc. Among them, the thiophene unit, as the most commonly and successfully used π-bridge, exhibits less distortion with adjacent groups and moderate electronegativity. In comparison with thiophene, the selenophene unit has a larger radius, which makes its lone pairs easier to interact with the neighboring molecules and improve the intermolecular interactions, thus enhancing the charge transfer characteristics. Moreover, the reduced aromaticity of selenophene can enhance the ground-state quinoidal resonance to result in narrower optical band gaps in the corresponding materials. The thiazole π-bridge is quite different from the electron-rich thiophene and selenophene, as the methine of thiophene is replaced by a more negatively charged nitrogen atom, which results in a thiazole unit with an electron-deficient state. Negative nitrogen atoms in thiazole can decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the donor material, which can lead to a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) in the resulting OSCs. To date, state-of-the-art donor polymers commonly adopt symmetrical π-bridge structures. For example, Hou et al. reported a polymer donor material with symmetric thiophene π-bridges, called PM6, which has become the most famous polymer donor in recent years. Ding et al. developed a novel polymer donor material with symmetric 3-(2-butyloctyl)thiophene π-bridges, referred to as D18, which realized a PCE of 18.2% when blended with Y6. However, there are few studies on the synergistic effect and design strategy of introducing different, especially asymmetric, π-bridge units into the main chain.
Therefore, in this work, a series of polymer donors were synthesized with thiophene, selenophene, and thiazole as the π-bridge units in the main chains. Among these, three new conjugated polymers, P1, P2 and P3 (shown in Fig. 1), containing asymmetric π-bridges between the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 1,3-dibromo-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) units, were prepared, respectively. Meanwhile, two control polymers, P4 and P5 (shown in Fig. 1), with symmetric π-bridges were also synthesized for comparison. It was found that the asymmetric polymers possess larger dipole moments, strong intermolecular interactions, and regulated energy levels.
Afterward, OSCs were prepared by introducing the non-fullerene small molecule Y6 as the electron-acceptor. As a result, a PCE of 16.22% for the devices based on P2:Y6 was obtained. In contrast, the device based on P4:Y6 exhibited a PCE of 12.04%, and the P5:Y6-based OSCs showed a pretty low PCE of 1.32%. We also analyzed the diversity in photovoltaic properties of the OSCs based on the foundation of those polymers, primarily via exploring their morphology features and energy loss. The results revealed that the asymmetric π-bridges in the polymer backbone had a significant influence on various properties of the resultant polymers, such as their optical–electrical, morphological, and photovoltaic features, suggesting that introducing asymmetric π-bridges is a promising strategy in OSC polymer design.

As presented in Fig. 1, the five conjugated polymers reported in this work exhibited quite similar chemical structures: the BDT unit and the BDD unit were co-polymerized with thiazole, thiophene and selenophene as the asymmetrical π-bridge, respectively; the detailed synthesis routes of P1, P2 and P3 are provided in Fig. S1 in the ESI. Two control polymers, P4 and P5, with symmetric π-bridges were also prepared according to previously reported methods. The three asymmetric polymers could be easily dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and chloroform (CF). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) was recorded to be 58, 53, and 44 kDa, with PDIs of 3.27, 2.82, and 3.17, respectively, which were identified via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as the standard and TCB as the eluent under 150 °C.


Theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the effects of the asymmetric backbone on the molecular geometry and electronic structure using the density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set. To reduce the number of calculations, the side alkyl chain was simplified to methyl. As shown in Fig. 2, the optimized dihedral angles between the planar BDT core and the conjugated main chain for the three asymmetric π-bridge polymers were different, ranging from 8.22° to 12.47°, larger than those for the symmetric π-bridge polymers. The larger twisting geometry was beneficial to improving the solubility and inhibiting the strong aggregation of the corresponding polymers. Furthermore, the two distinct dihedrals could facilitate controllable crystallinity of the polymers, which can ensure appropriate phase separation and good miscibility when blending with Y6. The calculated HOMO/the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 are shown in Table 1, which were consistent with the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectra of the five polymers were measured in CF, and the resultant data are presented in Fig. 3a and Table 1. Notably, the five polymers with different π-bridges inserted in the backbone exhibited completely different absorption bands. P5 with a symmetric thiazole π-bridge displayed a strong absorption band in the 500–620 nm range with a maximum peak at 596 nm. By replacing the thiazole π-bridge with thiophene or selenium units, the absorption peaks of the asymmetric polymers P1, P2, and P3 significantly redshifted by 15, 35, and 27 nm, respectively, accompanied by strong shoulder peaks, which can be ascribed to the changed electron-donating ability of different π-bridge moieties. The absorption onset of P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 was ∼654, 693, 670, 699, and 637 nm, respectively, corresponding to the optical bandgap Eoptg of 1.89, 1.78, 1.85, 1.77, and 1.91 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that all the asymmetric π-bridge-based polymers exhibited higher maximum molar absorption coefficients compared to their symmetric counterparts, as shown in Table 1, indicating that the polymers with asymmetric π-bridges possess a more intense intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect and stronger molecular interaction properties than those with symmetric ones, which could be beneficial for light harvesting and charge transportation. To analyze the aggregation properties of the five conjugated polymers, temperature-dependent absorbance (TDA) measurements were conducted. As presented in Fig. S11, the shoulder peak intensities of the polymers with substituted asymmetric π-bridges weakened when the temperature was raised from 30 to 100 °C, suggesting that the polymers in dilute chlorobenzene exhibited distinct aggregation, which can be attributed to the slightly twisted conjugated backbone, while polymer P5 with symmetric thiazole π-bridges retains a strong shoulder peak. This suggests that the asymmetric π-bridge strategy can easily regulate the TDA properties of polymers.

To estimate the energy levels of the five polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out using ferrocene/ferrocenium (−4.80 eV) as the external standard. As shown in Fig. 3b, according to the onset of the oxidation and reduction potentials, the HOMO/LUMO levels were calculated to be −5.57/−2.77 eV for P1, −5.62/−3.01 eV for P2, −5.56/−2.99 eV for P3, −5.37/−2.66 eV for P4, and −5.66/−2.88 eV for P5, respectively. These results indicate that with the introduction of selenophene as π-bridge units in the skeleton (replacing the thiophene unit), the polymer exhibits elevated HOMO levels, whereas an inverse trend can be observed in the thiazole-substituted polymer. Such changes can be attributed to energy-level distributions in selenophene-based materials, where the HOMO of selenophene has a nodal plane across the heteroatom, while the LUMO is clearly delocalized over the heteroatom. This means that selenium substitution can efficiently lower the LUMO level of the resulting materials while leaving the HOMO level less affected, which echoes the reduction in the band gap of selenium-containing materials. In brief, the asymmetric π-bridge strategy can effectively control the energy level of polymers.

To explore and compare the photovoltaic performance of these polymers, BHJ OSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:Y6/PDINN/Ag were prepared and characterized. The detailed approach to device preparation is offered in the ESI. The J–V curves of the OSCs under optimum conditions are displayed in Fig. 4a, and relevant data are listed in Table 2. The devices based on P5 containing the symmetric thiazole π-bridge showed the lowest PCE of 1.32%, with a Voc of 0.74 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.50 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 32.41%. In contrast, a dramatically improved performance was observed in P1- and P3-based devices, which can be attributed to the optimization of the blended film morphology probably regulated by the introduction of asymmetric π-bridge units in the skeleton, as confirmed by TEM measurements in the following sections. Furthermore, a similar trend can be seen in the asymmetric π-bridge polymer P2-based OSCs that exhibited a remarkably higher PCE of 16.22% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 26.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.81%.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4b, and Table 2 lists the integrated Jsc values extracted from the EQE spectra, which were well consistent with those obtained from the J–V curves under a deviation of less than 5%. Similarly wide response ranges and profiles for the P1:Y6-, P2:Y6-, and P3:Y6-based devices are observed. However, the P5:Y6-based devices present an extremely weak response over the whole range of absorption spectra.
Meanwhile, the charge extraction and exciton dissociation efficiencies were analyzed via photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff), and the resultant Jph–Veff curves are presented in Fig. 4c. The Jph can reach a saturated current (Jsat) under a voltage of over 2 V, which indicated that each photo-generated exciton could be converted into a free charge carrier via dissociation and be captured by the electrodes. In addition, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), described by Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, at the short-circuit current status, were found to be 90.56%, 96.57%, 89.31%, 93.22%, and 27.78% for the P1:Y6-, P2:Y6-, P3:Y6-, P4:Y6-, and P5:Y6-based devices, respectively. The asymmetric conjugated polymer based OSCs displayed greater Pdiss in contrast to symmetric conjugated polymer based OSCs, demonstrating a more efficient exciton dissociation to realize greater values for FF and Jsc.
Moreover, we analyzed the bimolecular recombination from the dependence of Jsc on luminous intensity, via the power law formula Jsc ∝ Plightα, where Plight is the incident light intensity and α denotes an index assessing the level of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 4d, the α value decreased from 0.996 (P2:Y6), 0.986 (P1:Y6), and 0.957 (P3:Y6) to 0.955 (P4:Y6) and 0.948 (P5:Y6), indicating that the asymmetric π-bridge based OSC devices showed steeper slopes (larger α values) than the symmetric π-bridge-based devices, revealing that relatively severe bimolecular recombination had occurred in the symmetric conjugated polymer based OSCs. The α values closer to 1 suggest less bimolecular recombination and higher efficiency in carrier extraction in asymmetric conjugated polymer-based OSCs.
Besides, the trap-assisted recombination was analyzed via the Voc–Plight curves, which are shown in Fig. 4e. The P1:Y6-, P2:Y6-, and P3:Y6-based OSCs presented smaller slopes of 1.238kT/q, 1.229kT/q, and 1.265kT/q, respectively, revealing that less trap-assisted recombination occurred in the asymmetric conjugated polymer based OSCs, which is consistent with the greater Jsc and FF. In contrast, the symmetric π-bridge based OSC devices showed larger slopes of 1.351kT/q (P4:Y6) and 1.557kT/q (P5:Y6), which might be caused by the poor morphology and low charge transport induced by the symmetric π-bridges.

It is critical to determine the efficiency ceiling by knowing the energy loss (Eloss) of organic solar cells. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of the asymmetric π-bridges on Eloss for all devices, and the results are presented in Fig. 5 and Table 3. The optical bandgaps (Eg) of the devices were extracted from the intersection points of the normalized EQE and the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum. The Eloss of the P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5-based devices were calculated by the equation Eloss = Eg − qVoc, and the calculation results were 0.55, 0.58, 0.57, 0.62 and 0.68 eV, respectively.

The Eloss can be considered to contain three contributions based on the SQ limit. The first part (ΔE1 = Eg − qVSQoc) is the thermodynamic loss, which is determined by the band gap and temperature. The devices above achieved almost identical ΔE1 of 0.26 eV.
The second part (ΔE2 = qVSQoc − qVradoc) is from the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap, where Vradoc can be estimated through the highly sensitive EQE and EL spectrum. According to Table 3, Vradoc was calculated and found to be 1.13, 1.14, 1.14, 1.14 and 1.15 V for the P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5-based devices, respectively, corresponding to similar ΔE2 of 0.07, 0.08, 0.08, 0.09 and 0.09 eV, respectively. The third part, ΔE3, is from the non-radiative recombination loss, which can be determined from the luminous efficiency of the material. As shown in Fig. 5g, with an injection current close to the Jsc under solar illumination, the EQEEL of the device based on asymmetric π-bridges reaches around 1 × 10−4, corresponding to ΔE3 of 0.22 eV to 0.24 eV. In contrast, higher ΔE3 values of 0.27 and 0.33 eV were calculated for the P4 and P5-based devices. These results demonstrate that asymmetric π-bridge engineering for photovoltaic polymers can serve as a useful strategy to reduce the non-radiative recombination loss and then lead to high Voc values.

Given that the photovoltaic property is closely associated with the BHJ morphological features, TEM was therefore utilized to analyze the characteristics of the blends and explore the remarkable diversity of photovoltaic properties of the asymmetric and symmetric π-bridge polymers. As shown in Fig. 6e, the P5:Y6 blend films exhibited obvious aggregations and large-scale domain sizes, which could strongly influence the charge transport and cause serious bimolecular recombination, leading to a quite low PCE. In contrast, although P1, P2, P3 and P4-based blended films showed similar morphology properties, the P2-based blended film displayed more distinct phase separation with ideal nano-scale domains and successive interpenetration networks, which facilitate efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, leading to an increase in Jsc and FF, and thus, a dramatically improved PCE. This can also be found in the AFM images (Fig. S12), except for P4, and other blended films that have many convex features, which are considered to be related to their crystallinity and correspond to the TEM images.

To examine the compatibility between the polymer donor (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5) and the molecular acceptor (Y6), contact angle characterization was performed with water (H2O) and methylene iodide (CH2I2) as the probe liquid. The contact angle images of neat films are shown in Fig. S13. According to the Owens model, the surface energy (γ) of neat P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and Y6 films is estimated to be 37.77 mN m−1, 36.47 mN m−1, 38.03 mN m−1, 37.22 mN m−1, 39.97 mN m−1 and 39.99 mN m−1, respectively. Polymers and Y6 should have good compatibility due to their similar γ values. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ could be calculated from the surface energy by an empirical equation:
It can be found that χP1:Y6, χP2:Y6, χP3:Y6 and χP4:Y6 are in the same order of magnitude, while χP5:Y6 shows an extremely low value of 2.50 × 10−6 K, which may lead to higher miscibility. It is difficult for the P5:Y6 based devices to phase separate due to high miscibility, resulting in inferior charge recombination and a poor device efficiency of only 1.32%.
Then, ellipsometry was used to investigate the orientation of molecules in blended films. Generally speaking, when the molecular stacking in the material has a certain spatial orientation, the refractive index and extinction coefficient in the horizontal and vertical directions will be different. Therefore, the degree of molecular orientation in the film can be determined by the anisotropy of the film extinction coefficient:
where,
S is the Hermans orientation parameter, representing the average orientation of molecules, and kmaxe and kmaxo are the maximum extinction coefficients in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. When the orientation parameter S = −0.5, the molecules are supposed to be in a completely horizontal orientation; when S = 0 the parameter suggests that the molecules have a random orientation; and when S = 1 it indicates that the molecules are completely perpendicular to the substrate direction.


Fig. 7 shows the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of five blended films. The orientation parameter of the P1:Y6, P2:Y6, P3:Y6, P4:Y6 and P5:Y6 blended films are 0.077, −0.018, 0.072, 0.070 and 0.147, respectively. It can be considered that the P1:Y6, P2:Y6, and P3:Y6 blended films have a disordered orientation, which may lead to similar photovoltaic properties. The P5:Y6 blended film exhibits a more vertical orientation, which is not conducive to charge transport in the device, resulting in a low PCE and Jsc. However, the P2:Y6 blended film exhibits a more horizontal orientation, which is more conducive to charge transport in the device, consistent with the higher PCE and Jsc.

In summary, a series of donor polymers containing asymmetric π-bridges were synthesized in a simple one-pot chemical synthesis method and the structure–property/performance relationships were comprehensively studied. Compared to their symmetric counterparts, the polymers with asymmetric π-bridges possess larger dipole moments, stronger intermolecular interactions, regulated energy levels and lower energy loss. The optimal P2:Y6 based device presented the highest PCE of 16.22%, with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 26.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.81%, which is probably due to the ideal morphology, balanced carrier mobilities and suppressed recombination. These results suggest that the asymmetric π-bridge strategy has promising potential in developing new high-performance donor materials.
