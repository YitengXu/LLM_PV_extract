The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of poly(3-hexylthiophene)/fullerene (P3HT/PCBM) bulk heterojunction solar cells is enhanced through the addition of Ni(II) porphyrin–oligothiophene conjugates to typical P3HT/PCBM blends. The introduction of the porphyrin dyes increases the efficiency by up to 63 ± 20% compared with P3HT/PCBM control devices containing no additives. Moreover, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements show a 10 ± 5% enhancement in photocurrent compared to control blends. These results lead us to conclude that the photo-induced dissociation of P3HT excitons is promoted in the presence of the Ni(II) porphyrin–oligothiophenes and that the Ni(II) porphyrin subunits act as light-harvesting sensitizers as well as energy conduits for the P3HT excitons at P3HT/PCBM interfaces.

Research activity in the area of photovoltaics has intensified in recent years in response to increasing global energy demands and a recognized need for renewable and/or abundant energy sources. Organic photovoltaics, in particular, offer potential advantages over silicon based solar cells on account of their light weight, flexibility, and low cost of production. It is estimated that such solar cells could be commercially viable if a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 10% were achieved. In the last decade the PCEs of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have risen steadily, with companies such as Solarmer Energy Inc., Heliatek and Konarka recently reporting lab-scale devices with PCEs greater than 8%. Of the many candidate materials that have been studied for use in conjugated polymer-based solar cells, BHJ blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have been the most extensively studied. These two materials have many advantages, including excellent light-harvesting and charge transport properties. Possibly the greatest appeal of these two materials, however, is that they form a fairly ordered BHJ morphology with interpenetrating nanoscale networks through simple processes such as thermal annealing. Thermal annealing above the glass transition temperature of P3HT enables crystallization and interdiffusion of P3HT and PCBM, leading to nanoscale phase separation with domain sizes of approximately 20 nm, commensurate with typical exciton diffusion lengths in conjugated polymers. Although abetting performance as a general rule, thermal annealing is not a method that leads to detailed control of the morphology within the BHJ blend; furthermore, excessive thermal annealing can lead to over-ripening of microphase separated domains, leading to formation of large aggregates of P3HT and PCBM crystallites which ultimately cripples the device efficiency.

Beyond annealing, many different approaches have been taken in order to enhance the formation of an ordered morphology in P3HT/PCBM blends; these include: addition of transition metal complexes, addition of high boiling solvents or the use of solvent mixtures, use of discotic liquid crystals, or addition of small molecule sensitizers to the blends. One distinct advantage of using a small molecule dye or sensitizer is that the morphology of the BHJ blend may be influenced in a performance enhancing manner while also allowing more of the incoming photons to be harvested. To achieve the parallel goals of both increasing light absorption in the active layer and stabilizing an ordered morphology in the P3HT/PCBM BHJ blend, we designed several new porphyrin–oligothiophene conjugates (Fig. 1). Here, the design expectations were that these systems would not only function as sensitizers but also act as compatibilizing agents for the P3HT and PCBM domains. We anticipated that compatibilization would be achieved as the result of favorable supramolecular interactions. These could include donor–acceptor interactions between the flat porphyrin surfaces in the compatibilizer and fullerene (PCBM) present in the blend, as well interdigitated, van der Waals-like interactions between the oligothiophene chains on the porphyrin–oligothiophene conjugates with the hexyl substituents on the P3HT present in the blend. These putative interactions, in turn, were expected to allow for a more intimate mixing of the components and better control of local morphology. Ultimately, we proposed this would translate into improvements in device performance. Herein we report the synthesis of five new porphyrin–oligothiophene compatibilizers, as well as their effect on photovoltaic device performance after incorporation into P3HT/PCBM-based devices.

As shown in Scheme 1, a Suzuki reaction between nickel(II) porphyrin 6 and bromoterthiophene 7 afforded the bis-terthiophene–porphyrin 2 in 23% yield. The 1H NMR spectrum (CDCl3) recorded for this compound contained resonances for the terthiophene moiety, and displayed an absence of a resonance at 1.68 ppm ascribable to the pinacol ester. The bis-quaterthiophene–porphyrin 4 was prepared in an analogous manner from nickel(II) porphyrin 6 and quaterthiophene 8 and was obtained in 27% yield. As summarized in Scheme 2, the synthesis of porphyrin–oligothiophenes 1, 3, and 5 was performed in a similar fashion using the mono-functionalized nickel(II) porphyrin 9.


The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of P3HT/PCBM/porphyrin–oligothiophene ternary blend solar cells containing the porphyrin–oligothiophene conjugates described above were studied under conditions of AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as were the corresponding control solar cells consisting of P3HT/PCBM (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 displays the best cell data obtained for the blend P3HT/PCBM/3 wt% 1; however, similar J–V characteristics were observed for all of the devices containing P3HT/PCBM/porphyrin–oligothiophene ternary blends studied. A summary of the averaged J–V characteristics (based on the analysis of at least 12 devices) is given in Table 1.

In general, the addition of the porphyrin–oligothiophenes to the P3HT/PCBM blend led to an increase in the overall PCE. The best results were observed for devices that contained porphyrin 3. In fact, a 63 ± 20% increase in the average PCE was observed for devices incorporating 1 wt% of 3 compared with the control devices (Table 1 entry 11). For this device, a decrease in short-circuit current (Jsc) was observed from −3.0 ± 0.9 mA cm−2 in the P3HT/PCBM control devices to −2.4 ± 1.0 mA cm−2 in the ternary blend; however, a slight increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was also observed from 0.56 ± 0.1 V in the control devices to 0.58 ± 0.2 V in the P3HT/PCBM/3 wt% 1 blend.
Despite the decreased Jsc value, the combined increase in both Voc and fill factor (FF) led to the ternary blend device having a higher PCE value than the control devices. In general, all of the porphyrins studied affected device performance in a similar manner by slightly decreasing Jsc and increasing Voc. On the basis of this observation, we conclude that all of the porphyrin–oligothiophenes integrate themselves into the P3HT/PCBM blend in a similar fashion. We further infer that neither the number of thiophene units in the oligothiophene chain, nor the level of substitution (mono- or di-) on the porphyrin ring significantly affected the device performance.
We subsequently investigated the effect of porphyrin loading on the device performance; representative J–V curves for dye loadings of 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt% are shown in Fig. 3. In general, as the dye loading was increased, the PCE decreased, with 1 wt% loading giving the best results; a representative example is the device containing porphyrin 3, which exhibited average PCEs of 1.06 ± 0.5%, 0.72 ± 0.1%, and 0.43 ± 0.1% for loadings of 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt%, respectively. This trend was also observed for porphyrins 1, 2 and 5, whereas with porphyrin 4 the average PCE values for 1 wt% and 3 wt% loading were similar. The decrease in PCE with increasing dye concentration was the result of a progressive decrease in both Jsc and Voc, and consequently a decrease in FF as well. These results were consistent with the notion that high porphyrin loading levels lead to aggregation within the P3HT/PCBM blends, which likely limited the transport of photogenerated charges at the interface.
To confirm that the covalent linkage between the porphyrin and oligothiophene was necessary for improved device performance of the P3HT/PCBM blend, we fabricated further control devices containing multicomponent blends of the P3HT/PCBM and either nickel porphyrin 11, sexithiophene 12 (Fig. 4) or a mixture thereof (Table 1, entries 2, 3 and 4, respectively). An additive loading of 1 wt% was chosen for all studies involving these devices, as this concentration had proved most effective at increasing the PCE for the devices based on the porphyrin–oligothiophenes 1–5.
In contrast to what was seen for the devices containing the porphyrin–oligothiophene conjugates (i.e., 1–5), a decreased performance was seen for the control devices containing 11, 12, or a mixture of these two species. The control systems appeared to perform less efficiently than devices based on P3HT/PCBM alone. For example, the PCE decreased from 0.65 ± 0.2% to 0.5 ± 0.07% upon inclusion of 1 wt% 11, representing a 23 ± 10% loss in efficiency.
The relatively limited performance of the control devices was ascribed to significant decreases in Jsc, Voc and FF values compared to those observed for P3HT/PCBM (Table 1). Commonly, when dyes are added to polymer solar cells the device performance is degraded, and this is considered to be due to the formation of dye aggregates in the blend films. Such aggregates are expected to reduce the absorption efficiency or change the charge mobility of the active layer. Given the planarity of the nickel porphyrin 11 and sexithiophene 12, it is likely these compounds will stack in the solid state. To the extent that the aggregates of additives 11 or 12 do form, we consider it likely they would be located at the interface of the P3HT and PCBM domains, as has been previously reported for phthalocyanine-based devices, thereby interfering with electron transfer between P3HT and PCBM. Conversely, the porphyrin–oligothiophenes 1–5 are considerably less planar than the nickel porphyrin 11 or the sexithiophene 12. They are thus less likely to be crystalline or to aggregate within the P3HT/PCBM blend. Accordingly, they were expected to improve device performance, as seen by experiment. Collectively, the above results lead us to conclude that a covalent bond between porphyrin and oligothiophene is necessary for optimal performance of P3HT/PCBM devices containing this class of adjuvant.
In order to obtain further insights into the origin of the observed improvements in photocurrent generation, we measured the EQE spectra of the P3HT/PCBM binary blend, and compared the spectra with those recorded for the ternary blends containing 1 wt% porphyrin. Fig. 5 shows the EQE spectrum for P3HT/PCBM/1 wt% 4, as well as that for P3HT/PCBM alone. For the P3HT/PCBM blend, a photocurrent signal was only observed in the range 400–650 nm, which corresponds well with the band gap of this material as well as with EQE spectra of similar blends reported elsewhere. The EQE spectrum for the ternary blend has the same overall shape, with the photocurrent being observed between 400 and 650 nm; however, the intensity of the photocurrent at the peak maximum was enhanced by approximately 10 ± 5%. The increased EQE, although modest, leads us to suggest that the porphyrin–oligothiophenes are playing an active role. Further work will be needed to ascertain the determinants of the effect. Nevertheless, based on the underlying chemistry, we suggest that either these additives are being photoexcited and contributing directly to the photocurrent, or are promoting charge generation from P3HT excitons indirectly (i.e., without direct photoexcitation), or are operating via a combination of both mechanisms. Similar qualitative findings were seen for blends of P3HT/PCBM containing small amounts of a silicon phthalocyanine.

To determine the relationship between device performance and film morphology, we studied blends of P3HT/PCBM and blends of P3HT/PCBM/1 wt% 3 by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see ESI). The addition of small amounts of 3 to the P3HT/PCBM blend resulted in subtle changes in the surface morphology of the resultant thin films. In comparison with what was seen for P3HT/PCBM, the surface morphology of P3HT/PCBM/1 wt% 3 exhibited smaller features. These features correspond to a smaller grain size and may indicate a more intimate blending of the P3HT and PCBM components within the bulk heterojunctions. To the extent that this interpretation is correct, it would lead to a greater donor–acceptor interfacial surface area, and improved EQE performance, as is indeed seen by experiment. It is also noteworthy that the AFM images of the thin films of P3HT/PCBM/11 and 12 resemble those of the binary P3HT/PCBM blend. This is taken as further evidence that the covalent bond between the nickel porphyrin and oligothiophene plays a crucial role in terms of providing optimized device performance.


We have successfully synthesized and characterized five new porphyrin–oligothiophene conjugates and studied their ability to act as compatibilizing agents for solar cells based on P3HT/PCBM blends. The addition of small amounts of these porphyrins to the P3HT/PCBM blend led to an overall improvement in device efficiency that, to a first approximation, was independent of the length of the oligothiophene chain and the substitution pattern on the porphyrin ring. The largest improvement in PCE occurred when 1 wt% of the nickel(II) porphyrin was incorporated within the P3HT/PCBM blend. On the basis of the results obtained from the EQE and AFM experiments, we conclude that the increased device performance was due to an increase in photocurrent generation, as well as subtle changes in the morphology of the active layer.


The following chemicals were used without further purification: P3HT (regioregular, ADS, Mw = 20000–70000 g mol−1), PCBM (ADS, 99%), PEDOT:PSS (Ossila), o-dichlorobenzene (Aldrich, 99%) and aluminum (Kurt J. Lesker, 99.99%).


Porphyrins 1–5 were synthesized according to procedure A or procedure B.


Procedure A: a solution of porphyrin 9, the appropriate bromide (1.5 equiv.) and cesium carbonate (12 equiv.) in toluene (10 mL) was subject to 3 freeze–pump–thaw cycles and was then warmed to 20 °C. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (10 mol% relative to the porphyrin) was then added and the resulting solution was heated to 120 °C overnight. The solution was cooled and then filtered through celite. The solvent was then removed in vacuo and the crude material was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane, 10% dichloromethane/hexane eluent) to give the target porphyrin as a purple solid.

Procedure B: this procedure is identical to procedure A except that 2.5 equiv. of the thiophene bromide were used and porphyrin 6.

Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (Delta Technologies, 5–15 Ω) were etched with a CH4/O2 plasma (Oxford Instruments Plasma Lab 80+) and were then washed by ultrasonication in a solution consisting of powdered labware detergent, water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes, dried with N2, and then treated with Ar/O2 plasma (Oxford Instruments Plasma Lab 80+). A thin layer (≈30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the cleaned substrates at a spin-rate of 4000 rpm for 60 s, and the layer was dried in air at 150 °C for 15 minutes. An active layer of P3HT:PCBM:porphyrin was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene at a rate of 600 rpm for 300 s, after being filtered through a 0.45 μM PTFE filter, on the PEDOT:PSS film to give an active layer thickness ≈ 260 nm. The active layer was left to anneal in an N2 atmosphere overnight, then aluminum (70 nm) was thermally evaporated on the active layer through a shadow mask (Denton). The first 5 nm was deposited at ≈1.0 Å s−1 followed by a further 65 nm at ≈5.0 Å s−1. Finally, the contacts were painted with flash-dry conductive silver paint (SPI) and the devices were annealed at 150 °C in the air.


AFM images of the devices were acquired in tapping mode (AC mode) using an Asylum MFP-3D AFM/SPM setup. Experiments were performed at room temperature in the air using standard silicon cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 50 N m−1 and resonance frequency of ∼300 kHz. The images were acquired at a scan frequency of 1 Hz in dimensions of 2 × 2 μm2.


PV response was measured using a Keithley 2400 General Purpose Sourcemeter and a Xenon Lamp Solar Simulator (Newport) equipped with an AM1.5 filter. External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) spectra were gathered using a home-built spectrophotometer with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, model SR830), a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260 1/4M), and a Si photodiode calibrated by the manufacturer (Hamamatsu). EQE studies were carried out under ambient light.
