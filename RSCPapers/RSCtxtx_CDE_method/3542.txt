A dispersion of platinum-on-graphene was prepared essentially by a two-step process, involving uniform distribution of graphene nanoplatelets in a cosolvent of ethanol–water in the presence of a polymeric dispersant and subsequent in situ reduction of dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate to metallic platinum on the graphene surface. The process generated platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) of ca. 4.0–10 nm in diameter on the graphene surface. The platinum-on-graphene dispersion was coated on an FTO glass to prepare a counter electrode (CE) for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The hybrid film of platinum nanoparticles and graphene nanoplatelets (PtNP/GN) showed a transparency of 70% at 550 nm, indicating its suitability as a CE material for a rear-illuminated DSSC. The DSSC with the CE having the film of PtNP/GN exhibited a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.00%, superior to 7.14% of the DSSC with a conventional sputtered platinum (s-Pt) CE. In the case of rear-illumination the DSSC showed an η of 7.01%, while the DSSC with the conventional s-Pt showed an η of only 2.36%. HRTEM and FE-SEM were used to observe the dispersion of the hybrid material in the solvent, UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the films, and IPCE spectra and electrochemical impedance spectra were used to explain the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are low cost photovoltaic cells. They can be fabricated easily and show relatively high efficiencies. Basically, a DSSC consists of a photoanode with titanium dioxide, adsorbed with a photosensitizing dye, a redox electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE). The CE is not only an essential part of a DSSC, but also an important component in determining its performance. It should have, at its interface with the electrolyte, a minimum charge transfer resistance and an excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions (I3−); these conditions are required to reduce the voltage loss at the CE that may occur due to the charge transfer overpotential at its interface with the electrolyte. Fast I3− reduction kinetics at the CE leads to minimum energy loss. Platinum (Pt) is the most common material for catalyzing the reaction of I3− ions at the CE of a DSSC, owing to its excellent electrocatalytic activity. However, Pt is expensive, rarely available, and is already in demand for various chemical and electrochemical industries. In the development of DSSCs, challenging issues are not only to achieve a high solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency for the DSSC but also to reduce its cost of fabrication. By reducing the amount of Pt used in a DSSC, the cost of fabrication of the cells in an industrial scale can be greatly reduced.

The manipulation and utilization of carbon based nanofillers, including carbon black, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and graphene, have been well documented. Among these materials, graphene is unique for its 2D geometric shape and for its chemical composition of hexagonally arrayed carbon atoms in a single atom-thick sheet. Owing to its high surface area, electrical conductivity, optical and mechanical properties, graphene is potentially useful in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells. A few researchers have already introduced it as the catalytic film on the CE of a DSSC. However, sheet-like graphene has the inherent property of aggregating through interlayer piling, and is therefore incompatible for being dispersed in an organic medium during the process of preparing a homogeneous film. One of the key challenges for the practical application of graphene is how to improve the dispersibility of exfoliated graphene in a suspension while at the same time maintaining its intrinsic physical and electric properties. In addition, the ultrahigh aspect ratio of the exfoliated graphene provides perfect support for metal nanoparticles.
Considering the aforesaid inherent properties of graphene, platinum nanoparticles were introduced into graphene to prepare counter electrodes for DSSCs. A nanohybrid material of graphene nanoplatelets (GNs) and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) was prepared in this work by using a dispersant, synthesized previously in our laboratory. A new strategy was developed for preparing the nanohybrid material of graphene nanoplatelets and platinum nanoparticles using this dispersant. The dispersion of platinum-on-graphene nanoplatelets (PtNP/GN) was coated on the FTO glass to prepare the counter electrode of the DSSC. The composite film of PtNP/GN was optimized, by using different wt% of the PtNPs with a fixed wt% of the graphene, for preparing the counter electrode with high electrocatalytic ability for a DSSC. The DSSC fabricated by using the CE with the film of PtNP/GN showed a high power conversion efficiency of 8.0%, while the DSSC with a conventional platinum sputtered counter electrode (s-Pt CE) showed a power conversion efficiency of 7.14%; in the case of rear-illumination, the corresponding power conversion efficiencies are 7.01% and 2.36%, respectively. The close values of the ηs of the DSSC with PtNP/GN (5/1) for rear and front illumination indicate its potential to be used as both the rear and front illuminated DSSC. In contrast, the DSSC using the conventional s-Pt as the catalytic material on its CE is established to be highly unsuitable for this purpose. This study reports on the deposition of a PtNP/GN hybrid film as the catalytic film on the CE of a DSSC by using the novel dispersant. The significance of the cell using the composite film of PtNP/GN lies in the fact that the amount of PtNPs is greatly reduced, because the matrix of the film is graphene. In other words, the production cost of the DSSC with the PtNP/GN will be much cheaper, in a large scale, in spite of the fact that its power conversion efficiency is much higher (8.00%) than that of the cell with the s-Pt film (7.14%).

Graphene was obtained from Legend Star International Co., Ltd. Poly(oxyethylene)-diamine, with the molecular weight (Mw) of 2000 g mol−1 (abbreviated POE 2000) and with a mixed block of 6 oxypropylene and 39 oxyethylene units, was a waxy crystalline and water-soluble amine (melting point 37–40 °C, amine content 0.95 meq. g−1). 4,4′-Oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA, 97% purified by sublimation), Ti(IV) tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP, >98% purity), acetonitrile (ACN), acetylacetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6, 99.95% purity) was bought from Alfa Aesar Company. The solvents, dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) and ethylalcohol were supplied by Teida Chemicals. Lithiumiodide (LiI, chemical grade), iodine (I2, chemical grade), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 20000 Mw) were procured from Merck Chemical Co. tert-Butanol (96%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) were acquired from Acros Chemicals. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN) and 2-methoxyethanol (99.95%) were received from Fluka Chemical Co. and Sigma-Aldrich Company, respectively. Large-sized TiO2 (PT-501A, 99.74% purity, 15 m2 g−1 surface area, 100 nm diameter) was obtained from Ya Chung Industrial Co. Ltd, Taiwan.


The requisite dispersant poly(oxyethylene)-segmented oligo(imide) (POE-imide) was synthesized from an aromatic dianhydride and a poly(oxyethylene)-diamine, with the optimized molar ratio of 5:6. To a 100 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (RB flask), equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet–outlet lines, and a thermometer, 6.0 mmol of POE 2000 (12.0 g in 15 mL of DMAc) was added. Then 5.0 mmol of ODPA (1.6 g in 10 mL of DMAc) was added to the RB flask through a funnel in a drop-wise manner. The reactants were heated to 180 °C, stirring the contents continuously, and maintained at this temperature for 3 h. During the reaction, samples were taken periodically and monitored by FT-IR analyses. Finally, the reaction was terminated by cooling to room temperature. The product mixture was then subjected to a rotary evaporation to remove the solvent under reduced pressure. The product (POE-imide) was recovered as a yellowish waxy solid.


The nanohybrid of “PtNPs on GN” was prepared by an in situ reduction of dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6) in the presence of POE-imide. The graphene (0.025 g) was first added into ethanol (5.0 g) in a vial and then agitated with a VCX 500 ultrasonicator for an hour at ambient temperature. The resultant graphene–ethanol solution appeared to be dark black with aggregates at the bottom of the vial, indicating a low degree of dispersion for graphene, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1a. In a separate vial, a solution of POE-imide (0.25 g) was prepared in deionized water (5.0 g) and poured into the graphene–ethanol solution to obtain a homogeneous dispersion as shown in the inset of Fig. 1b. Different weights of H2PtCl6 (0.025, 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 g) were then added to the homogeneous dispersion. Fig. 1c shows the final homogeneous dispersion containing PtNP/GN in POE-imide.


The PtNP/GN dispersion was spin-coated on an FTO glass at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The thus coated film was then annealed at 390 °C for about 20 min. The PtNP/GN-coated FTO glass was used as the counter electrode of a DSSC.


According to a sol–gel method, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was hydrolyzed at 88 °C for 8 h in a solution containing HNO3. The resultant solution was further subjected to 240 °C in an autoclave for 12 h. The autoclaved solution was concentrated to 13 wt% to obtain a paste of nanocrystalline TiO2. 10 wt% of PEG (with respect to TiO2) was then added to the slurry to prevent the paste from being cracked during its casting on a FTO glass and also to control the pore size of the TiO2. The paste was then doctor-bladed on the FTO, and the TiO2/FTO was further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The coating and annealing were repeated for 4 times. The TiO2 film was shaved to obtain an active area of 0.16 cm2. Then it was immersed for 12 h in ACN–tert-butanol (1:1 in volume ratio). This photoanode was separated from the CE with the film of PtNP/GN by using 25 μm-thick Surlyn® (X1170-25) as a spacer. A liquid electrolyte, containing 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN, was injected between the photoanode and the CE through a hole on the CE, via a capillary method.


The surface of the DSSC was illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (XES-3003S-100, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd, Japan) and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). The organic content of the POE-imide was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1) in air. The temperature was increased from 100 to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1. Surface morphologies of PtNP/GN films were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (NanoSEM 230, Nova™). The graphene–ethanol solution with and without POE-imide were observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JOEL JEM-1230 electron microscope, operated at 100 kV and photographed with a Gatan DualVision CCD Camera). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained by the aforesaid potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The explored frequency range was 65 kHz to 10 mHz. The applied voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC between the CE and the FTO–TiO2-dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The catalytic abilities of the CEs were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode electrochemical system, with PtNP/GN as the working electrode, a Pt foil as the CE, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference; the electrolyte contained 10 mM I−, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained under short-circuit conditions. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.), and the light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was moved in steps through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ), which is defined as follows.
IPCE (λ) = 1240(JSC/λφ),
where
λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).


The synthetic scheme of the dispersant, POE-imide, is outlined in Fig. 2a. The ideal structure of POE-imide, consisting of polar POE (–CH2CH2O–)x segments, aromatic imide (–CONCO–), and amido acids (–CONH–COOH–) is illustrated in the figure. The POE-imide was synthesized through the reaction between poly(oxyethylene)-diamine (POE2000) and an aromatic anhydride (oxydiphthalic dianhydride) at the molar ratio of 6:5. The temperature of the reaction needs to be raised up to 180 °C for 3 h to achieve complete formation of imide functionalities from the intermediates of cyclic amido acids. As shown in Fig. 2b, characteristic absorptions were identified at 1680 and 1720 cm−1 for amide and at 1713 and 1770 for imide functionalities, during the progression of the reaction. POE-imide contains polar functionalities such as the poly(oxyethylene) segment and imide groups. These functionalities serve as non-covalent bonding forces for anchoring the platinum nanoparticles and the use of dispersing graphene from its aggregated state. Consequently, the exposed surfaces of exfoliated GN are sufficient for supporting an in situ reduction of H2PtCl6 and for stabilizing the thus generated PtNPs. The dispersion of graphene is supposed to occur through non-covalent interactions; the aromatic imide functionalities of POE-imide facilitate the π–π interactions between the POE-imide and the graphene. The presence of lone pairs of electrons of POE-imide in its poly(oxyethylene) and imide functionalities is supposed to be capable of facilitating the polar interactions between the PtNPs and the graphene nanoplatelets. In the process of dispersing the graphene nanoplatelets in the mixed media of water and ethanol, the POE-imide acts against strong van der Waals forces among GN. As a result, graphene is delaminated and exists in the form of exfoliated nanoplatelets in a homogeneous solution. With the addition of H2PtCl6 in the mixture of ethanol and water, the graphene dispersion remains homogeneous and the reduction of the Pt salt into PtNPs occurs under mild heating conditions. The homogeneous reduction of PtNPs on GN can be seen in the TEM micrographs of Fig. 1. The figure shows a TEM image of the pristine graphene in the mixture of ethanol and water in the absence of POE-imide; the graphene is in a self-piled or aggregated form. Fig. 1b shows the image of the pristine graphene in the mixture of ethanol and water in the presence of POE-imide; the medium is almost transparent and shows well-dispersed or delaminated graphene. The inserted picture in Fig. 1a shows a macro-view of the vial containing the graphene without POE-imide, indicating the undispersed graphene; aggregates of graphene can be seen on the glass wall in the picture. Fig. 1b shows the vial of graphene with POE-imide, depicting a well-dispersed graphene in the medium of ethanol and water; a homogeneous dispersion of graphene without any aggregates on the vial sidewalls or at its bottom can be seen. Fig. 1c shows the final homogeneous dispersion containing PtNP/GN in POE-imide. Fig. 3a shows a SEM image of the dispersed GN and PtNPs. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was employed to confirm the compositional distribution and successful synthesis of Pt nanoparticles. Fig. 3b and c show corresponding EDX-mappings for carbon and platinum, respectively.

A series of experiments in our laboratory have confirmed the fact that the POE-imide dispersant is absolutely necessary for the reduction of H2PtCl6 to PtNPs on the surface of GN. In the absence of POE-imide, the graphene in its aggregated form failed to generate a homogeneous Pt/GN hybrid. Large aggregates of graphene could be seen on the sidewalls of the vial. Different weights of H2PtCl6 (0.025, 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 g) were added to a homogeneous solution, containing POE-imide and graphene at the fixed ratio of 2/1 by weight. Films formed by using PtNPs and graphene at the weight ratios of 1/1, 2/1, 5/1, 10/1, and 20/1 are designated PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (2/1), PtNP/GN (5/1), PtNP/GN (10/1), and PtNP/GN (20/1) for further discussions. Fig. 4a–c show SEM images of PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (5/1) and PtNP/GN (20/1), respectively, while Fig. 3d shows the image of a sputtered platinum (s-Pt) film. The average size of the PtNPs remains almost the same for all the three films. A careful observation indicates that PtNP/GN (5/1) shows more platinum nanoparticles, compared to PtNP/GN (1/1). PtNPs began coagulating with further increase in the amount of platinum, as can be seen in the SEM image of Fig. 4c. Coagulation of PtNPs leads to a decrease in the surface area of the film and thereby in the power conversion efficiency of the pertinent DSSC, as will be seen later.
The performances of the DSSCs with different PtNP/GN counter electrodes were evaluated in comparison with that of the cell fabricated by using a conventional s-Pt counter electrode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5). The open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs are listed in Table 1. The table also gives the size of PtNP/GN particles, as judged by the SEM micrograph. With the increase in the ratio of PtNPs to GN from 1/1 to 5/1, there is an increase in the power conversion efficiency from 6.71% to 8.0%. With further increase in the Pt loading up to the ratio of 20/1 for PtNPs to GN, the efficiency rather decreases, as can be seen in Table 1. The power conversion efficiency has peaked at 8.00% in the case of the DSSC with PtNP/GN (5/1), which is significantly superior to 7.14% of the cell with s-Pt. The optimized particle size (4.8 ± 0.7 nm) and particle distribution of PtNP/GN (5/1), with reference to those of films with other ratios of PtNPs to GN and those of the sputtered platinum film (particle size: 10–20 nm), have endowed the former film with a higher catalytic ability, as can be seen in Fig. 8. This higher catalytic ability of PtNP/GN (5/1) is vindicated in the higher short-circuit current density and higher power conversion efficiency of its DSSC, compared to those of the DSSC with the s-Pt film. These results demonstrate the significance of incorporating GN in the catalytic film of a counter electrode.

Furthermore, IPCE curves were obtained for the DSSCs with the counter electrodes using the films of PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (5/1), PtNP/GN (20/1), and s-Pt; the curves are shown in Fig. 6. The broad IPCE curves in the figure, covering almost the entire visible spectrum from 400 to 800 nm, exhibit the maximum IPCE value of about 88% at 520 nm for the cell with PTNP/GN (5/1) and about 78% for the cell with s-Pt. These values are consistent with the corresponding JSC values (Table 1). Fig. 7 shows EIS data of the DSSCs with the counter electrodes using the films of PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (5/1), PtNP/GN (20/1), and s-Pt film. The equivalent circuit is illustrated in the inset of the figure. In general, the EIS spectra of an FTO/TiO2/dye/electrolyte/Pt/ITO device show three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The ohmic series resistance (Rs) is determined at the high frequency range of the impedance spectra, where the phase is zero. The first and second semicircles are assigned to the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface (Rct1) and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct2), respectively. The Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Rw) is associated with the third semicircle. However, the diffusion resistance in this work is inconspicuous due to the low viscosity of the solvent used in the electrolyte (viscosity of ACN and MPN are 0.37 cP and 1.60 cP, respectively). Rs values of 14.8, 13.5, 13.9, and 15.2 ohm were obtained for the DSSCs using PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (5/1), PtNP/GN (20/1), and bare s-Pt, respectively (Table 2). Table 2 shows Rct1 values of 11.8, 10.7, 11.9, and 12.3 ohm for the DSSCs using PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (5/1), PtNP/GN (20/1), and s-Pt, respectively. These Rs and Rct1 values are very much consistent with the JSC and η values of the corresponding DSSCs (Table 2). It can be noticed that, in both the cases of the cells using the graphene, the series resistance is considerably smaller than that in the case of the cell with bare s-Pt; this implies that the conductivities of the counter electrodes with PtNP/GN (5/1) and PtNP/GN (20/1) have increased due to the presence of graphene in them. These increased conductivities have apparently enhanced the catalytic abilities of the counter electrodes with PtNP/GN (5/1) and PtNP/GN (20/1), and thereby the corresponding JSCs and ηs, compared to the catalytic ability of the counter electrode with s-Pt and to the JSC and η of its DSSC. CVs were obtained for the counter electrodes using the films of PtNP/GN (1/1), PtNP/GN (5/1), PtNP/GN (20/1) and s-Pt CE, and are shown in Fig. 8. Each CV in the figure indicates an anodic peak current density (Ipa) and a cathodic peak current density (Ipc), corresponding to the oxidation of I− ions to I3− ions and the reduction of I3− ions to I− ions, respectively. A careful observation indicates that the redox peaks of the electrode with PtNP/GN (5/1) are slightly higher than those of the electrode with s-Pt, revealing a slightly higher electrocatalytic ability in favor of the electrode with PtNP/GN (5/1), with reference to that of the electrode with s-Pt.

In addition, a UV-vis spectrophotometer was employed to measure the transmittances of PtNP/GN films formed by using PtNPs and graphene at the weight ratios of 1/1, 2/1, 5/1, 10/1, and 20/1; photographs of the counter electrodes with these films are shown in Fig. 9a. The counter electrode with PtNP/GN (5/1) shows a transmittance of about 70% at 550 nm (Fig. 9b). The transmittances of the counter electrodes with s-Pt and bare FTO glass are 35% and 78%, respectively. These data indicate that the transparency of the counter electrode with PtNP/GN (5/1) is close to that of the counter electrode with bare FTO glass, and is far superior to that of the counter electrode with s-Pt. This result prompted us to test the suitability of the DSSC with PtNP/GN (5/1) for a rear-illumination. Fig. 10 shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs with PtNP/GN (5/1) and s-Pt, obtained for both front and rear illumination. The VOC, JSC, FF and η values of the cells are listed in Table 3. The power conversion efficiencies of the cell with PtNP/GN (5/1) are 8.00% and 7.01% for front and rear-illumination, respectively, while those of the cell with s-Pt are 7.14% and 2.36% for front and rear-illumination, respectively. It appears that the DSSC with the hybrid film of platinum nanoparticles and graphene nanoplatelets (5/1) can be used both as a rear-illuminated and front-illuminated cell, provided the transparency of the hybrid film is brought close to that of the FTO glass, which does not seem to be impossible, because of the proximity of their values (transparency of PtNP/GN (5/1) is about 70% at 550 nm, while that of FTO is 78% at 550 nm). Interestingly the DSSC with a platinum counter electrode is highly unsuitable for rear illumination.

This study points to the excellent property of the home-made polymeric dispersant POE-imide for the dispersion of PtNPs and graphene and thereby for the deposition of the nanohybrid film of PtNPs and graphene on an FTO electrode. The DSSC with the counter electrode of PtNP/GN yielded a power conversion efficiency of 8.00%, at 100 mW cm−2, when the weight ratio of platinum and graphene was 5/1, which is significantly superior to 7.14% of the cell with s-Pt. The optimized particle size (4.8 ± 0.7 nm) and particle distribution of PtNP/GN (5/1), with reference to those of the sputtered platinum film (particle size: 10–20 nm), have endowed the former film with a better catalytic ability. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and EIS values of the DSSCs are consistent with the JSC values of the cells. Due to the facts that the transparency of the counter electrode with PtNP/GN (5/1) is close to that of the counter electrode with bare FTO glass and superior to that of the counter electrode with s-Pt, the DSSC with this novel counter electrode has a potential to be used for both rear and front illumination. The power conversion efficiencies of the cell with PtNP/GN (5/1) are 8.00% and 7.01% for front and rear-illumination, respectively, while those of the cell with s-Pt are 7.14% and 2.36% for front and rear-illumination, respectively.
