Two new non-fullerene acceptors, namely QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl, containing a novel imide-functionalized quinoxaline (QI) moiety fused with a thienylthiophene unit as the central building block, and fluorinated or chlorinated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as end-capping groups, were designed and synthesized, respectively. An optimized device based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl presented a power conversion efficiency of 13.3%, with an impressively high open-circuit voltage of 0.94 V. These results demonstrate the great potential of QI-containing fused units as central building blocks for high-performance acceptors.

Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have shown great commercial application prospects due to their low cost, light weight, flexibility, and large-area fabrication. In recent years, bulk-heterojunction OPV devices based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have enabled great technological advances by virtue of their significantly enhanced power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Among the so far reported NFAs, those incorporating fused-ring electron acceptors have demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance, which is attributable to their wide absorption profiles associated with high absorption coefficients, appropriately aligned energy levels, and excellent miscibility with electron-donating polymers. However, molecular engineering strategies are also critical, specifically in terms of designing new central building blocks to facilitate the charge-carrier transport and promote the formation of optimal morphology of the bulk-heterojunction light-harvesting layer.

Currently, most fused-ring electron acceptors are constructed by using building blocks with a fused-ring moiety as the core unit, such as indacenodithiophene, indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithieno[3,2-b′]thiophene, and so forth, which typically contain the 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile moiety as the flanked peripheral unit. In contrast to these aforementioned electron-donating units, recently developed NFAs containing electron-withdrawing benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BTz) or benzoquinoxaline (BQ) units fused with thieno[3,2-b′]thiophene units attracted much attention, as they present remarkably extended absorption profiles with high absorption coefficients and high electron mobilities, as well as appropriate frontier molecular orbital energy levels. These remarkable properties enable the achievement of high PCEs of over 16% when combined with wide-bandgap conjugated polymers that have complementary absorption profiles. Quinoxalineimide (QI) units, which have a strongly electron-accepting planar π-conjugated framework containing electron-withdrawing quinoxaline and imide units (Fig. 1), have been utilized as acceptor units to construct donor–acceptor-type small molecules and conjugated polymers for organic electronic devices. The QI unit has better electron-withdrawing capability and solubility than its precursor. In particular, the benzo-unit allows for the integration with two thieno[3,2-b′]thiophene moieties through a nitrogen atom as the bridge, leading to a π-conjugated planar structure that is favourable for charge transport.
In this study, we have designed two novel NFAs based on QI as the central unit fused with a dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene moiety. These NFAs were end-capped with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile and 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, and were denoted as QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl, respectively. Both NFAs presented similar absorption profiles, with strong intramolecular charge-transfer characteristics up to 800 nm, and both also had a relatively a deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of approximately −5.75 eV. By combining the resulting NFAs with the electron-donating conjugated polymer P2F-EHp, we observed a relatively high open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.94 V and an impressively high PCE of over 13%.
The targets QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation of an intermediate dialdehyde compound and the fluorinated or chlorinated 3-(dicyanomethylidene)-indan-1-one (IC) with a relatively high yield of over 80%. Details of the synthesis and characterization data for the compounds are presented in the ESI. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements of both QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl did not provide reliable evidence of the phase transition in the range of 30–300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI).
As shown in Fig. 2, both QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl presented relatively broad absorption spectra in the range of 500–800 nm, which gives rise to their strong intramolecular charge-transfer characteristics. The maximum absorption coefficients of QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl thin films were 8.8 × 104 and 9.4 × 104 cm−1, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI), and the P2F-EHp:NFA blended films presented relatively wide absorption profiles from 350 nm to approximately 850 nm (Fig. S3, ESI). Also, these two new NFAs exhibited similar maximum absorption values of approximately 750 nm, although QIP-4Cl had a slightly extended absorption spectrum as compared to QIP-4F. Such a slight red-shift might be correlated to the larger size of the chlorine atom and the greater length of the chlorine–carbon bond, which may have resulted in the stronger intermolecular π–π packing and the stronger intramolecular charge-transfer effect. The absorption onsets of QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl were located at 806 nm and 839 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.54 eV and 1.48 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b). We noted that the absorption coefficient of QIP-based NFAs is slightly lower than that of Y6, which can be understood as their aggregation may not be so good as Y6 due to the presence of the additional alkyl-side groups in the imide moiety (Table S2, ESI). The less pronounced aggregation of these QIP-based NFAs might also account for the blue-shifted absorption profiles and larger optical bandgaps compared to that of Y6 and the benzoquinoxaline-based NFAs.
The electrochemical properties of QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, by using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard (0.39 V vs. Hg/Hg2Cl2). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level were calculated to be −5.75/−3.86 eV and −5.77/−3.89 eV for QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl, respectively, from the equations EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)] and ELUMO = −e[Ered + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)] (Fig. 2c). The electrochemical data of the two QI-based fused-ring electron acceptors are summarized in Table S1 (ESI), and the energy-level diagram is shown in Fig. 2d. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the HOMO of these compounds was mainly distributed along the conjugated central core, whereas the LUMO was delocalized throughout the entire molecule (Fig. S4, ESI).
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the QI-based NFAs, polymer solar cells (PSCs) were constructed with a conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/P2F-EHp:NFAs/PFN-Br/Ag. We used the wide-bandgap electron-donating polymer P2F-EHp because of its complementary absorption spectra and appropriately aligned energy levels with respect to QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl (Fig. 2). The initial characterization of these devices showed that they had an optimum weight ratio of P2F-EHp:NFAs of 1:1, and they were processed in chloroform (CF) in the presence of 0.5 vol% of dibenzyl ether (DBE) as the solvent additive. The resulting spin-cast films were thermally annealed at 110 °C for 10 min (Tables S3–S5, ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a, and the detailed parameters are presented in Table 1.

The device based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4F as the light-harvesting layer exhibited an impressive PCE of 12.11%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.27 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.53%. In contrast, the device based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl exhibited a higher PCE of 13.30% (VOC = 0.94 V, JSC = 19.62 mA cm−2, and FF = 72.11%). The slightly enhanced JSC of the QIP-4Cl-based device might be correlated with its slightly extended absorption spectra (Fig. 2b). To our knowledge, the PCE of 13.3% is among the highest PCE values observed for devices based on quinoxalineimide-based electron acceptors (Table S6, ESI). The relatively high open circuit voltage of approximately 0.94 V is higher than those obtained from binary PSCs based on BTz and BQ-based NFAs (Table S7, ESI), which can be understood from the deeper HOMO levels of these QIP-based NFAs. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra of devices based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4F and P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl were calculated to be 18.04 mA cm−2 and 19.37 mA cm−2, respectively, which are very close to the corresponding values obtained from J–V measurements (Fig. 3).
To investigate the charge-transport properties of the QI-based devices, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe, respectively) of these blended films under optimal conditions were calculated using the spacechargelimited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5 and Table S8, ESI). The P2F-EHp:QIP-4F blended film showed a μh of 0.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 4.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In contrast, the P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl blended film showed a greater μh of 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a greater μe of 5.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The relatively greater hole and electron mobilities enable less charge recombination, thus contributing to the higher Jsc of the P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl–based devices.
The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the efficient applied voltage (Veff) was studied to evaluate the charge-dissociation and charge-collection efficiency of the devices based on QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl, with relevant characteristics shown in Fig. S6a (ESI). At large reverse bias (Veff > 1 V), the Jph of the P2F-EHp:QIP-4F and P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl devices gradually approached saturated values (Jsat) of 18.99 and 19.85 mA cm−2, respectively (Table S9, ESI). Thus, the charge dissociation probability, denoted as P(E, T), can be estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat. Under short-circuit and maximal power-output conditions, the P2F-EHp:QIP-4F and P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl devices exhibited ratios of 97.58% and 98.98%, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat ratio of the P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl–based devices suggested that they enacted a more efficient excitation dissociation and charge collection process, leading to their higher EQE and JSC.
For the VOCversus Plight characteristics (Fig. S6b, ESI), slopes of 1.45 kT/q and 1.37 kT/q were observed for the devices based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4F and P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl, respectively. The lower slope of the device based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl clearly indicates the existence of reduced Shockley–Read–Hall recombination. From the characteristics of JSC as a function of light intensity (Plight), shown in Fig. S6c (ESI), the exponential factor (S) of Jsc ∝ (Plight)S was determined to be 0.97 and 1.01 for the devices based on P2F-EHp:QIP-4F and P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl, respectively. These results indicate that bimolecular recombination was effectively suppressed in both devices, and the negligible bimolecular recombination in the P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl–based device supported its high FF.
To reveal the molecular packing properties of the acceptors and the corresponding blends, we measured two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the pure QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl films exhibited intense π–π stacking reflections in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with q positions of 1.66 Å−1 (d = 3.78 Å) and 1.69 Å−1 (d = 3.71 Å), respectively. Thus, the introduction of chlorine atoms in QIP-4Cl is helpful to densify the molecular co-facial packing. For BHJ blends, multiple scattering interference generated from the crystal unit cells of the NFAs is observed. We attributed the emergence of the molecular crystals in blends to the DBE addition during spin-casting, since DBE substantially prolonged the film drying processes and improved the crystallization. Due to the overlap of the scattering features from the P2F-EHp and NFAs, the π–π stacking regions cannot be easily fitted. However, as shown in Fig. 4e, more intense π–π characteristics are seen in the OOP averaged profile of the P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl blend, indicative of the better-developed face-on crystallites. Such a structural order ultimately led to the enhanced charge transport in the P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl blend, in good agreement with the enhanced JSC and FF of the resulting devices. The morphologies of the P2F-EHp:QIP-4F and P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl blended films were also investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; see Fig. S7 in the ESI). The AFM images show that both blended films exhibited smooth and relatively uniform surfaces, and relatively small root-mean-square roughness values. Also, an obvious interpenetrating network with nanoscale phase separation was observed in the TEM images of the QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl-based blended films, which was beneficial to charge-carrier generation and transportation.
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two new non-fullerene acceptors, namely QIP-4F and QIP-4Cl, containing imide-functionalized quinoxaline building blocks fused with thienylthiophene as the central unit, and the fluorinated and chlorinated IC as the end-capping groups, respectively. The optimized P2F-EHp:QIP-4Cl-based device showed an impressive PCE of 13.3%. To our knowledge, such an efficiency is among the highest values reported for quinoxaline-based electron acceptors with a fused ring structure in binary polymer solar cells. Our results also demonstrate the great potential of the imide-functionalized quinoxaline unit as central building blocks for constructing high-performance non-fullerene acceptors for polymer solar cells.
