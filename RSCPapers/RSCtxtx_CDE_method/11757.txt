Two kinds of new conjugated polymers (P1 and P2) with benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and thiophene as the donor unit were designed, synthesized and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). These polymers show a broad absorption in the visible region, a medium band gap of about 1.75 eV, and a low-lying HOMO energy level of about −5.65 eV. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of both P1 and P2 was greatly improved to 0.85 V mainly due to the introduction of a carboxylate group at the 3-position of the thiophene spacer. Fluoro substitution on the polymer backbone of P2 can greatly enhance the interchain interaction, leading to a huge increase of short-circuit current density (Jsc). P2-based devices with the active layer spin-coated from 1,2-diclorobenzene (DCB) solutions that contain 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and washed with methanol showed a synergistic positive effect, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 8.67%. The PCE could be further improved by constructing inverted devices and the best efficiency of 9.26% was finally obtained. In addition, the mechanism for achieving such a high PCE for P2 based devices was also proposed based on the morphological analysis of the blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing incident angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). The improvement can be ascribed to the enhanced molecular packing and proper phase separation of the blend films and the reduced charge recombination.

Over the past few years, research on bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs) with conjugated polymers or small molecules as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor has made significant progress. This has been achieved by exploiting the distinctive flexibility of these materials for the design of new polymer materials, for adjusting the physical properties of PSCs during the manufacturing process, and for studying the close relationship between the chemical structure of polymers and the photovoltaic performance of devices. As one of the most important components of the active layer, conjugated polymers are employed as electron-rich donor materials and tremendous efforts have been devoted to studying these materials. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% has been achieved for single junction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) via the synthesis of novel donor materials and optimization of the device structure as the main strategies. However, the relatively low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of most widely used polymers hampers further enhancement of their photovoltaic performance. For example, the widely used polymer donor material PBDTT-TT has a Voc of only 0.78 V, which limits further improvement of the photovoltaic performance. Cui established an effective strategy for improving the Voc of this material to 0.84 V via the introduction of alkylthio substituents. Chen presented POD2T-DTBT as a promising polymer with an adequate thin-film transistor (OTFT) hole mobility and PCE; however, it was difficult to further enhance the PCE because of the low Voc of 0.72 V. A variety of versatile strategies have been developed to improve the Voc of OPVs. The introduction of fluorine (F) atoms onto the polymer chain is considered as one of the most effective strategies. By decreasing the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the polymer donor, high open circuit voltage (Voc) can be realized. Nevertheless, it is generally highly challenging to decrease the HOMO level of a polymer by introducing F atoms while maintaining the solution processability of the polymer because fluoro substitution normally leads to increased coplanarity of the polymer chains. Therefore, it is essential to explore other methods to adjust the HOMO levels of the polymer without compromising its solubility. Toward this end, functional groups such as carboxylate, sulfonyl, and ketone moieties have been widely utilized, as exemplified by Hou et al. who, in 2014, developed polythiophene derivatives with a carboxylate group attached to the thiophene unit that exhibited a high PCE of 7.2%; this polymer was demonstrated to exhibit an increased Voc in comparison with P3HT. Huang et al. reported a new BDT-type polymer with a new electron-withdrawing group (sulfonyl) that resulted in a higher Voc of 0.76 V and an improved PCE of 6.22%. Notably, these groups are generally embedded in the acceptor units. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two conjugated polymers (P1 and P2; see Scheme 1) by attaching carboxylate groups to the thiophene units of POD2T-DTBT, which results in a significant increase in the Voc to above 0.85 V. Crystalline POD2T-DTBT with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.26% was first synthesized by Chen et al. in 2011. Attracted by its superior properties, especially its high hole mobility, intensive studies have been performed to further improve the OPV performance of POD2T-DTBT in recent years. Hsu et al. succeeded in introducing F atoms into the acceptor units of POD2T-DTBT and achieved a slightly increased PCE of 6.41%. Chen et al. achieved further enhancement of the PCE to 7.64% by changing the location of the alkyl chain of PTh4FBT, which resulted in strong interchain aggregation and very high hole mobility. Almost at the same time, Yan et al. achieved a much higher PCE of over 10% by optimizing the morphology of the active layer. Unfortunately, the best Voc of these donor materials was only about 0.80 V, which becomes a hindrance to accomplishing significant PCE improvement as the other two parameters, i.e., the short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), have reached a relative threshold based on extensive research. In this study, we demonstrate the synergistic effect between carboxylate groups introduced onto the donor unit and F atoms in the backbone, which not only makes the HOMO level of PTh4FBT theoretically lower but also guarantees good enough solubility for experimental solution processing. The strategy of including F atoms in the polymer backbone has been adopted in many studies so as to investigate its positive influence on the photovoltaic performance. In particular, we designed monomer 4 with the carboxylate group and produced polymer P1 with a high Voc of 0.85 V compared to 0.72 V for POD2T-DTBT. Devices based on P1:PC71BM showed poor photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 1.42%, probably due to the much better solubility of P1 than P2, where the PCE achieved with P2 was as high as 7.30% due to the presence of the F atoms. Treatment of the blend active layer with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and methanol enhanced the PCE of the P2-based devices to 8.67%, and the construction of inverted devices gave rise to a further PCE improvement. An overall PCE of 9.26% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 14.91 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.71 was achieved by integrating all the positive effects.


The syntheses of P1 and P2, and the intermediates are outlined in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was synthesized according to the literature procedure. Compound 2 was prepared in a yield of 76% by the reaction of compound 1, 2-octyl-1-dodecanol, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the catalyst. Homocoupling of compound 2 in the presence of bis(pinacolato)diboron, Pd(dppf)Cl2, and K2CO3 afforded compound 3 in a yield of 70%. Monomer 4 was obtained in a yield of 65% by bromination of 3 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in chloroform. Stille polycondensation of 4 with 5a and 5b afforded polymers P1 and P2 in yields of 69% and 60%, respectively. The bromo and tributylstannyl end groups were capped by reaction with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene and 2-bromothiophene, respectively. In short, P1 and P2 were obtained by Stille polycondensation. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1 and P2 were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 80 °C with chlorobenzene as an eluent and narrowly distributed polystyrenes as calibration standards, and the results are summarized in the ESI. It should be mentioned that only lower molecular weight polymers were obtained for P1 under normal polymerization conditions. To exclude the molecular weight influence on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, high molecular weight P1, namely, P1-H was therefore synthesized under microwave conditions. The details are provided in the ESI. Since side chains have a significant influence on the solubility of polymers, branched side chains were used to guarantee reasonable solubility of the polymer. As expected, the non-fluorinated polymer P1 was fully soluble in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) even at room temperature; whereas fluorinated P2 exhibited poor solubility in DCB at room temperature.

Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated the good thermal stability of P1 and P2 with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of up to 342 °C for P1 and 351 °C for P2 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Notably, fluorinated P2 is more stable than non-fluorinated P1. No obvious glass transition point was observed for P1 and P2 in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements in the range of 60–250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powdery polymer samples were used to investigate the packing of the polymer chains in the solid state. As shown in Fig. S2, all polymers showed one diffraction peak in the wide angle region, which reflects the π–π stacking distance between the polymer backbones (3.57 Å for P1 and 3.54 Å for P2). Such a short π–π stacking distance indicates that these two polymers have a relatively planar conformation and can be closely stacked in the solid state.

The UV-vis absorption properties of P1 and P2 in DCB solution and as thin films spin-coated on quartz substrates were investigated as shown in Fig. 1. In DCB solution, P1 exhibited a broad and intense absorption in the range of 400–700 nm with the absorption maximum located at 564 nm. In DCB solution at room temperature, P2 exhibited a broad absorption in the range of 400–700 nm with two intense peaks located at 590 and 640 nm. The weak absorption peak in the short wavelength region can be attributed to the localized π–π* transition, and the intense absorption peak in the long wavelength region can be ascribed to the internal charge transfer (ICT) transition from the thiophene donor unit to the benzothiadiazole acceptor unit. The red-shift, broadening, and appearance of a shoulder peak at about 650 nm in the absorption spectrum of P2 in DCB solution indicate aggregation of the polymer chains in solution at room temperature. Heating the solution to 100 °C caused a blue shift and narrowing of the absorption bands, indicating dissociation of the aggregates at higher temperature. On going from solutions to films, as shown in Fig. 1b, these two polymers exhibited almost superimposed absorption spectra with the two absorption peaks further red-shifted and broadened. Moreover, a shoulder peak located at about 650 nm was observed in the absorption spectrum of the film due to aggregation of the polymer chains. The optical band gaps (Eg) of the P1 and P2 films, calculated from their absorption edges, were 1.72 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively.


The electrochemical properties of P1 and P2 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 2, quasi reversible cyclic voltammograms were acquired in the scanning range of 0 to 1.5 eV. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of 0.89 eV for P1 and 1.01 eV for P2versus Ag/Ag+ were obtained. Using the equation: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71 eV), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were calculated to be −5.60 eV for P1 and −5.72 eV for P2. It is worth noting that due to the fluoro substitution, the HOMO energy level of P2 decreased by 0.12 eV in comparison with that of P1. This observation is consistent with previous reports. The attachment of a strong electron-withdrawing carboxylate group onto the polymer backbone can markedly decrease the HOMO level of the polymers, and further enhancement of the Voc can be expected in PSCs. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels derived from the HOMO level and Eg are summarized in Table 1.

The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were initially investigated using the conventional device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Mg/Al (100 nm), where ITO represents indium tin oxide, PEDOT indicates poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and PSS denotes poly(styrene sulfonate). A detailed description of the fabrication process as well as the donor/acceptor (D/A) ratios of the blend in the active layer obtained by initial investigations is presented in the ESI. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3a and the corresponding device characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The optimal D/A weight ratio was determined to be 1:1.5, and under these conditions, the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were 1.42% for P1 and 7.30% for P2. For devices based on P1-H, the PCE was improved to a large extent to be 2.81%, but it was still significantly lower than that based on P2 as we demonstrated in the ESI. Notably, P1 exhibited the smallest PCE among the four evaluated polymers, as shown in Chart 1. The low efficiency of P1 is mainly due to its much lower short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, P1 displayed a greatly improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.85 V in comparison with P3 and P4, indicating that the introduction of the carboxylate group onto the polymer backbone can greatly enhance the Voc of devices. The chemical structures of these four polymers are quite similar, where they possess the same backbones and alkyl chains, but the alkyl chains are connected to the polymer backbone by different functional groups, as illustrated in Chart 1. As reported,P3-based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 6.26% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 12.3 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.71. When the benzothiadiazole acceptor unit was replaced by the 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole acceptor unit, the PCE of the fluorinated polymer P4 increased only slightly to 6.41% with an increase in the Voc to 0.78 V; the Jsc remained nearly the same at 12.2 mA cm−2, and the FF decreased to 0.68. Therefore, the positive effect of introducing F atoms into P3 was not significant for the overall PCE enhancement. However, in the case of P2, which contains both a fluorinated benzothiadiazole acceptor unit and a bis(carboxylate) substituted bithiophene acceptor unit, the situation was different. P2 gave rise to the highest PCE of 7.30% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 12.53 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.67. Taking into account the only structural difference between P4 and P2, we can conclude that the significant increase in the PCE observed with P2 is due to the carboxylate substitution on the thiophene unit, which produced a significant increase in the Voc. In comparison with P1, fluoro substitution of P2 produced a marked increase in the Jsc. Consequently, we can conclude that fluoro substitution on the benzothiadiazole unit and carboxylate substitution on the thiophene unit produced a positive synergistic effect on the performance of the PSCs.

It has been reported that the photovoltaic performance of devices can be greatly improved by using a solvent additive such as 1,8-diiodooctance to process the active layer in combination with washing the active layer with methanol. For further promoting the photovoltaic performance of the P2-based PSCs, solvent additives and washing the active layer with methanol were employed. When the active layer was spin coated from the DCB solution with the use of 1.0% DIO (by volume) as the additive and the active layer was washed with methanol before deposition of the cathode, the PCE was further enhanced to 8.67% while the Jsc increased to 14.11 mA cm−2 and the FF increased to 0.70. The detailed device characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The use of DIO as an additive can improve the morphology of the active layer (vide infra) and methanol washing can completely remove the high boiling point DIO additive to improve the morphological stability.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for the P1 and P2-based devices fabricated under the optimal conditions were performed under monochromatic irradiation to verify the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. As shown in Fig. 3b, all devices exhibited a broad photo-to-current response in the range of 350 to 750 nm. However, the maximum EQE value of the P1-based devices was only 15%, which rationalizes the low Jsc. Fortunately, the EQE was enhanced to 70% for the P2-based devices, giving rise to an obtainable Jsc as high as 12.53 mA cm−2. Furthermore, additional EQE enhancement was achieved by the synergistic effects of the DIO additive and methanol treatment, leading to a Jsc of 14.11 mA cm−2.
In order to better understand the influence of the solvent additive and methanol treatment on the performance of the PSCs, the morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4a and 5a, the AFM and TEM investigations both revealed coarse phase separation with spherical PC71BM domains having diameters of 100 to 200 nm in the blend films. The good solubility of P1 in DCB led to undesired liquid–liquid phase separation to form large aggregates. The domain size larger than 100 nm markedly exceeds the exciton diffusion length and greatly reduces the efficiency of exciton dissociation, leading to lower Jsc and FF values. Although fluorinated P2 exhibited low solubility, it could still be used to fabricate the active layer by spin-coating from the blend solution at elevated temperature. The AFM 2D height images presented in Fig. 4b show that the P2:PC71BM blend films that were spin coated from the hot DCB solutions exhibited a relatively smooth topography with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.61 nm. After the use of 1.0% DIO as the solvent additive and washing the active layer with methanol, the morphology of the blend films became more homogeneous and the RMS value further decreased to 1.81 nm, as shown in Fig. 4c. This was further corroborated by the TEM images shown in Fig. 5b and c. For the plain blend films fabricated without DIO and methanol treatment (Fig. 5b), the morphology was slightly less homogeneous. For the blend films fabricated with the DIO additive and methanol treatment, a highly homogeneous morphology with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network formed by nanofibrils was observed, as shown in Fig. 5c. The morphological investigations can be used to adequately interpret the results of the device analysis (vide supra).
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was also employed to probe the phase separation of the blends in the bulk under various conditions. A photon energy of 284.2 eV was selected to provide highly enhanced contrast between the materials. Fig. 6 shows the R-SoXS profiles of the P1:PC71BM blend films and P2:PC71BM blend films with and without DIO and methanol treatment. The median of the distribution (smedian) of the scattering corresponds to the characteristic median length scale, ξ, of the corresponding log-normal distribution in real space, where ξ = 1/smedian, a model independent statical quantity. For the P1:PC71BM blend film, a scattering peak was observed at q ≈ 0.03 nm−1, which corresponds to a value of ∼200 nm. The scattering peak at q ≈ 0.06 nm−1 originated from the form factor. The P2:PC71BM blend film processed with pure DCB shows a smaller value (∼40 nm) than the P1-based blend film. When 1% DIO was used as an additive followed by methanol washing, the value decreased slightly to ∼30 nm. It is known that smaller domains are favorable for enhancing the charge dissociation efficiency, which explains why the P2:PC71BM blend processed with the additive shows the highest Jsc. R-SoXS can also be used to evaluate the average composition variations (relative domain purity) via integrating the scattering profiles and calculating the total scattering intensity (TSI). The relative domain purity of the P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P2:PC71BM blends processed with additives were 95%, 99%, and 100%, respectively. The purer domains can reduce bimolecular recombination, which explains why the Jsc and FF values of the P2-based blends were higher than those of the P1-based blend.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) was used to garner molecular-level structural information concerning the molecular orientation and packing of the blend films. Fig. 7a and (b) show the GIWAXS 2D pattern and line profiles of the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM blend films with and without the additive. Compared with the P1-based blend films, all the scattering peaks, (h00) and (010), of the P2:PC71BM blend films were sharper/stronger, which indicated higher molecular ordering in the P2-based blend films. The coherence length (CL) of P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM was calculated (via the Scherrer equation) to be 3.7 and 4.2 nm, respectively. This confirms improved molecular packing in the P2-based blend films. When P2:PC71BM was processed with an additive, the CL was further increased to 4.5 nm. The improved π–π stacking ordering should be favorable for charge transport and thus the device performance.
To further elucidate the effect of the DIO additive and methanol treatment on the performance of the PSCs from the charge transport point of view, we studied the hole and electron mobility of devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Au (Al) structure (ESI). The hole and electron mobilities of these BHJ PSCs were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model and calculated according to equations reported in the literature. The dark J–V curves were fitted by using the Mott–Gurney equation: J = 9εoεrμV2/8d3, where J is the space charge limited current, εo is the vacuum permittivity (εo = 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the permittivity of the active layer (εr = 3 F m−1), μ is the hole mobility, and d is the thickness of the active layer. As shown in Fig. S4, the μ values of the P1- and P2-based devices were calculated to be 1.97 × 10−6 and 3.38 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This rationalizes the higher Jsc of the P2-based devices than that of the P1-based devices. After mixing with 1% DIO and washing the P2 film with methanol, the hole mobility increased dramatically to 6.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is noteworthy that the electron mobility of P2 remained almost unchanged at 1.20 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Notably, a hole/electron mobility ratio of 1 to 2 is considered as optimal to achieve balanced electron and hole mobility. Herein, the enhanced hole mobility matches with the electron mobility much better, which signifies more balanced charge transport in the devices, and overall, a higher FF was achieved for the P2-based devices.
The vertical distribution of the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer is very crucial for adequate device performance. Herein, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to determine the surface components of the blend active layer. Detailed sample preparation, measurements, and initial data are presented in the ESI. From these XPS results (Fig. S5), the content of fluorine on the top surface (close to the LiF layer) is nearly twice that on the bottom surface (close to the PEDOT:PSS layer), which indicates vertical phase separation in the blend films with a polymer-rich top surface and a PC71BM-rich bottom surface. Due to the intrinsic electron-deficient nature of the polymer, the polymer-rich top surface is unfavorable for electron collection in the devices constructed with the conventional structure. Therefore, inverted devices with a ITO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Al structure were fabricated, where PFN is poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]. As shown in Table 2, the Jsc increased to 14.91 mA cm−2 for the inverted devices compared with 14.11 mA cm−2 for the conventional device, which reflects the EQE enhancement in Fig. 3b. This probably resulted from the better charge collection and transmission of PFN relative to PEDOT:PSS. Overall, a PCE as high as 9.26% was obtained.

In summary, two medium band gap conjugated polymers (P1 and P2) based on benzothiadiazole and thiophene units were successfully synthesized and used as donor materials to construct PSCs. These two polymers both show broad absorption in the visible region and have low-lying HOMO levels. The introduction of carboxylate and fluoro functional groups into the molecular structure not only leads to a significant increase in the Voc from 0.72 to 0.87 eV, but also guarantees the planarity of P2 to form a close packing arrangement in the solid state (d = 0.35 nm). The best photovoltaic performance achieved with the P1-based devices involved a PCE of only 1.42% because of the low Jsc, whereas the P2-based devices exhibited a PCE as high as 7.30%. After optimization of the device fabrication conditions by using a DIO additive and methanol treatment, the PCE was improved to 8.67% for conventional devices and to 9.26% for inverted devices. Evaluation of a possible mechanism behind the achievement of these high PCEs was attempted based on the characterization of diverse blend films. We conclude that the best PCE achieved with the P2-based devices is mainly attributed to the high Voc and improved Jsc and FF, which can be ascribed to the proper phase separation in the blend films and reduced charge recombination, as deduced from the measured hole/electron mobility. These results demonstrate that the combination of carboxylate and fluoro functional groups in the polymer structure has a synergistic effect on the performance of PSCs.

The residue was chromatographically purified on a silica gel column by eluting with DCM/petroleum ether (1:2, v/v) to give compound 3 as a colorless oil (2.22 g, 70%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 7.90 (d, J = 1.2 Hz, 2H), 7.50 (d, J = 1.2 Hz, 2H), 4.12 (d, J = 5.72 Hz, 4H), 1.67–1.68 (m, 2H), 1.17–1.40 (m, 64H), 0.70–0.90 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 162.42, 136.93, 134.67, 131.59, 124.59, 67.78, 37.43, 31.89, 31.88, 31.44, 29.92, 29.62, 29.57, 29.53, 29.32, 29.28, 26.75, 22.64, 14.06.


According to the literature procedure, compound 4 was synthesized from 3 (2.00 g) as a colorless oil (1.5 g, 65%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 7.19 (s, 2H), 4.14 (d, J = 5.56 Hz, 4H), 1.66–1.70 (m, 1H), 1.18–1.47 (m, 64H), 0.79–0.81 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 161.61, 135.27, 132.37, 126.05, 118.87, 68.11, 37.35, 31.89, 31.38, 29.92, 29.63, 29.58, 29.54, 29.32, 29.29, 26.73, 22.65, 14.06. Anal. calcd for C50H84Br2O4S2: C 61.71, H 8.70. Found: C 61.79, H 8.64.


A mixture of monomer 4, monomer 5, toluene, and DMF was carefully degassed before and after adding Pd(PPh3)4. The mixture was stirred and reacted at 110 °C under N2 for 24 h. After the reaction, 2-bromothiophene was added and stirred at 110 °C for 4 h; subsequently, 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene was added and stirred at 110 °C overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 200 mL methanol. The resulting precipitate was filtered and Soxhlet extracted successively with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was collected, concentrated to a small volume, and precipitated into a large volume of methanol. The resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum.


Compound 4 (146 mg, 0.15 mmol), compound 5a (94 mg, 0.15 mmol), toluene (5 mL), DMF (1 mL), and Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mg, 4.5 μmol) were used to prepare P1. P1 was obtained as a dark solid (115 mg, 69%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4) δ: 7.49–8.44 (m, 8H), 4.45–4.92 (m, 4H), 1.36–1.82 (m, 66H), 1.03–1.17 (m, 12H). Mn = 16.3 kg mol−1, Mw = 39.9 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.5.


Compound 4 (129 mg, 0.13 mmol), compound 5b (88 mg, 0.13 mmol), toluene (5 mL), DMF (1 mL), and Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mg, 3.9 μmol) were used to prepare P2. P2 was obtained as a dark solid (90 mg, 60%). Mn = 42.2 kg mol−1, Mw = 154.5 kg mol−1, PDI = 3.7. 1H NMR spectra could not be obtained due to the poor solubility in common solvents at room temperature.
