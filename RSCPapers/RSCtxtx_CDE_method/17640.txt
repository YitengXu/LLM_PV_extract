Hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) is a discotic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with good charge transport characteristics while the light harvesting property of porphyrins is well-known. In order to take advantage of the properties of both materials, a porphyrin-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene-porphyrin triad 6 was synthesised for the first time. In photoluminescence studies, the emission from the higher energy HBC unit was completely quenched by the porphyrin unit indicating efficient energy transfer. This novel hybrid material 6 was tested in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices reaching a power conversion efficiency of 1.2%.

Hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) is a discotic polycyclic aromatic molecule consisting of thirteen fused six membered rings. HBC and its derivatives have been shown to self-assemble into columnar structures giving rise to ordered morphology in films. The self-association property has brought a certain amount of interest in the use of HBC-based materials as semi-conductors in organic electronic applications. Charge mobility of 5 × 10−3 cm2/Vs was achieved in organic field effect transistor (OFET) devices using a dodecyl-substituted HBC molecule. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) consisting of alkyl-substituted HBC materials have also been reported. However, most HBC derivatives rely on alkyl chains at the periphery for solubility, which limits the potential for further functionalization. Recently, we reported the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of highly-soluble easily-functionalized HBC building blocks carrying conjugated substituents. The primary challenge in the synthesis of these systems is the incorporation of conjugated substituents as well as alkyl groups for solubility. The 9,9-dioctylfluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (FHBC) moiety has emerged as a material with excellent solubility and the potential for further derivatization. FHBC core molecule 1 has shown exceptional performance in OFETs as well as bulk heterojunction OPVs (Fig. 1). One strategy to further improve the OPV performance is to broaden the absorption profile of the FHBC material. We have recently demonstrated this strategy by attaching dendritic oligothiophenes of varying sizes to the periphery of the FHBC core.

Porphyrins are the primary light harvesting molecules in photosynthesis. They have absorption that extends well into the red region of the visible spectrum and have high extinction coefficients. The properties of porphyrins can be tuned easily by incorporation of metals and by functionalization of the substituents on their periphery. A number of porphyrin derivatives have been designed for artificial photosynthesis where they can act as light harvesters, initiators of charge separation and/or charge carriers. While porphyrins have been successfully employed as organic dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), the use of porphyrins in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs has been less successful. The challenge in the incorporation of porphyrins in BHJs is to provide a solid state morphology that allows the efficient transport of charges to the electrodes after the photoexcitation and charge separation events. A recent study has shown the possibility to use porphyrins as the electron donor material in a BHJ OPV. The formation of nano-scale crystalline porphyrin domains enables efficient charge separation and transport. In this study, a quinoxalinoporphyrin 2 will be combined with the FHBC core 1 (Fig. 1). It is envisaged that this hybrid material will carry the light harvesting properties of the porphyrin while the self-assembling behaviour of the FHBC is maintained.

The FHBC-porphyrin hybrid material 6 was prepared by Suzuki coupling between the FHBC boronic acid pinacol ester derivative 4 and the bromo-quinoxalinoporphyrin 5 (Scheme 1). Compound 4 was prepared from previously reported FHBC derivative 3 under palladium catalysed borylation conditions while the bromo-quinoxalinoporphyrin 5 was prepared by reaction of the 2,3-dioxo-porphyrin with 1,2-diamino-4-bromobenzene. The FHBC-zinc porphyrin hybrid 6-Zn was similarly prepared by Suzuki coupling between compound 4 and zinc porphyrin 5-Zn. Zinc metallation of porphyrin 5 was achieved by dissolving zinc acetate in a chloroform–methanol solution of the porphyrin followed by heating at reflux to give zinc(II) bromo-quinoxalioporphyrin 5-Zn in 99% yield. Both FHBC-porphyrin hybrids 6 and 6-Zn were purified by size exclusion chromatography. The synthesis of the quinoxalinoporphyrins 2 and 2-Zn required for comparison studies is reported elsewhere (Fig. 1).

Evidence for the self-association behaviour of FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 (Fig. 2). The resonances assigned to the protons on the FHBC unit shift up-field with increasing concentration. This is indicative of π–π stacking of the discotic FHBC unit. In contrast, the shift in the resonances assigned to the porphyrin unit (β-pyrrolic H) is relatively small. This is probably due to the fact that the bulky 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl groups are preventing close aggregation of the porphyrin units. These observations are in good agreement with other FHBC systems reported previously where the FHBC moieties were shown to π–π stack in a staggered arrangement. In this way, the FHBC units are in close contact with each other while the porphyrin units are relatively separated.
The UV-Vis spectrum of the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 is simply a super-position of the individual spectrum of the FHBC and porphyrin units (Fig. 3a). This suggests that the electronic interaction between the FHBC and porphyrin moieties is weak. Similarly, the UV-Vis spectrum of the FHBC–Zn porphyrin hybrid 6-Zn also matches the spectra of the FHBC core 1 and the zinc porphyrin 2-Zn (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, there are differences in the UV-Vis spectrum of the FHBC-porphyrin hybrids in solution and in solid state (Fig. 3c and d). For compound 6 and 6-Zn, the absorption maxima at 366 nm in solution can be assigned as the absorption maxima of the FHBC core. This absorption band is significantly broadened for both compounds in solid state which can be attributed to aggregation behaviour of the FHBC core. On the other hand, the absorption bands belonging to the porphyrin moiety (Soret and Q bands) remain at similar wavelengths (Table 1). It is likely that the bulky di-tert-butylphenyl substituents on the porphyrins are preventing aggregation of the porphyrin units. The HOMO–LUMO energy gap of these materials can be obtained from the absorption onset of their UV-Vis spectra (Table 1). The HOMO–LUMO gap of the FHBC core is 2.87 eV while the HOMO–LUMO gap of the porphyrin derivatives are all of the order of 2 eV. This compares favorably with the values obtained from electrochemical experiments (vide infra).

The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of FHBC 1 and FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 in CH2Cl2 solution are shown in Fig. 4a (excitation wavelength = 365 nm). The emission maximum of the FHBC compound 1 in solution is centered at 491 nm. The solution PL spectrum of FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 mainly consists of the emission from the porphyrin moiety (657 amd 728 nm) with very weak emission from the FHBC core. This is indicative of energy transfer from the FHBC core to the peripheral porphyrin units. The solution PL of a mixture of FHBC core 1 and quinoxalinoporphyrin 2 (1:2 mole ratio) shows a strong emission from the FHBC molecule and a relatively weak emission from the porphyrin (Fig. 4a). This comparison confirms that efficient energy transfer is only occurring for the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid where the FHBC and porphyrin units are linked covalently. Detailed theoretical calculations and ultra-fast laser spectroscopic studies are underway to elucidate the kinetics of these energy transfer processes in the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid system as they play an important role in determining device performance.
In solid state, the PL spectra of hybrid 6 as well as the FHBC 1/quinoxalinoporphyrin 2 blend only show the porphyrin emission (Fig. 4b) with the FHBC emission completely quenched (Fig. 4b). The proximity of the FHBC and porphyrin molecules in the blend film allows the energy transfer from the FHBC molecule to the porphyrin even with no covalent linkage between the two units. Similar observations were recorded for the FHBC–Zn porphyrin system (Fig. 4c and d). By blending these FHBC-porphyrin electron donors with an electron acceptor (PC61BM), all thin film PL was quenched. This indicates efficient charge transfer from the donors to the acceptor and suggests that these blends may be suitable for bulk heterojunction solar cell applications.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the materials in this study were measured using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 5). All porphyrin derivatives show quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction processes in solution (1 × 10−3 M in chlorobenzene with 1 M Bu4N+BF4− electrolyte). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the compounds were determined from the onset of the oxidation and reduction processes, respectively. Ferrocene was used as the reference. The electrochemical behaviour of the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 was very similar to that of porphyrin compound 2 (Fig. 5a and c). FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 has slightly deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels than porphyrin 2 and the HOMO–LUMO gap of both compounds are close to 1.9 eV (Table 2). The Zn porphyrin derivatives 6-Zn and 2-Zn also exhibited similar electrochemical properties. In this case, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are essentially the same, within experimental error, and the HOMO–LUMO gaps are both 1.8 eV. These electrochemical energy gap values compare favourably with the optical energy gap values shown earlier. The energy levels of all organic semi-conductors in this study are shown in Fig. 6. All donor materials have appropriate energy levels for application in bulk heterojunction solar cells with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the electron acceptor.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices with the structure ITO|PEDOT:PSS|active layer|TiOx/Al were fabricated and characterized. The ratio of donor and acceptor materials was optimized at 1:2 w/w while the active layer thickness was typically between 60 and 70 nm. TiOx layers were introduced following literature procedures. The devices were tested in air and, in general, all devices showed good diode-like behaviour in the dark and photovoltaic effects under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination.

In preliminary experiments, BHJ OPV devices containing FHBC-porphyrin 6 and PC61BM in the active layer were fabricated and tested. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.3% was obtained (Fig. 7). The performance of these devices was lower than that of devices containing FHBC 1 and PC61BM even though the porphyrin moiety in 6 is absorbing at a broader range of wavelengths of light (Fig. 7 and 3a). Device parameters, including short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) were lower for the device fabricated using compound 6 compared with that using FHBC 1 (Fig. 7). The most telling parameter is the fill factor where the FHBC 1 devices had an average FF of 0.45 and the FHBC-porphyrin 6 device had an average FF of 0.27. This indicates that the charge transport in FHBC 1 devices is much more efficient than in FHBC-porphyrin 6 devices and suggests a difference in the solid state morphology of the active layer blend films. In a previous study, we have shown that the self-assembly of FHBC 1 into ordered structures is an important factor in determining BHJ OPV device performance as this material characteristic promotes better charge transport in thin films. As such, one of the reasons for lower device performance for compound 6 could be the steric bulk of the di-tert-butylphenyl solubilized porphyrin unit disrupting the assembly of ordered structures in solid state. With this in mind, it is envisaged that the incorporation of FHBC-porphyrin 6 as a dopant into a FHBC 1/PC61BM blend (1:2 weight ratio) could be advantageous for broadening spectral absorption and maintaining efficient charge transport in the BHJ OPV devices.

Fig. 7 shows the device characteristics of a set of BHJ devices with different ratios of FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 in FHBC 1/PC61BM blends. As the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid was introduced into the BHJ, the current density of the device increases (Fig. 7b). This fits with the fact that the active layer of the device is absorbing more light as the ratio of the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid increases. However, at around 0.25 weight ratio of 6 to 1, the current density began to decrease (Fig. 7b). Although the active layer may be absorbing more light with increasing proportion of 6, the steric bulk of 6 is likely to change the morphology of the blend film. This can lead directly to the decrease in charge transport ability of the blend film and hence the decrease in photocurrent density measured. This hypothesis is also supported by the trend in the fill factor (Fig. 7c). The fill factor for the devices started at around 0.45 without compound 6 in the active layer. The fill factor remained at approximately the same level until 0.2 weight ratio of 6 was added after which the fill factor decreased to around 0.25 for the 6/PC61BM device. Voc of over 0.9 V was recorded for all devices except for the two devices containing the highest ratios of 6 (Fig. 7a). Given the trends in current density and fill factor, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.3% was recorded for the device containing 0.2 weight ratio of 6 to 1 (Fig. 7d). The spectral response of devices containing various donor blends is shown in Fig. 8. All blends converted light into current in the 300 nm to 500 nm range. This corresponds to the UV-Vis absorption of the FHBC and fullerene components of the devices, with a very weak contribution from the porphyrin (Fig. 3 and 8). A more detailed analysis by calculating the internal quantum efficiencies of the devices is required to quantify the contribution of each active layer component to the photocurrent generated. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) maximum improved from 30% to nearly 45% with up to 25% by weight of FHBC-porphyrin 6 added to the FHBC core 1 (Fig. 8). The improvement in IPCE cannot be attributed only to the increase in light absorption by the FHBC-porphyrin 6 in the blend. This increase in IPCE between 300 and 450 nm is likely to be the result of morphology changes in the active layer caused by the addition of the FHBC-porphyrin additive. Further addition of FHBC-porphyrin 6 caused a decrease in IPCE. This is probably a result of inefficient transport of charges through the active layer of the device stemming from further morphology changes.
The performance of BHJ devices containing FHBC 1 with a well defined mole ratio of porphyrin additives and PC61BM were compared (Fig. 9 and Table 3). The ratio of FHBC 1 to porphyrin additive was chosen to match the ratio of the best performing blend device between FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 and FHBC 1 at 0.2 wt. ratio as observed in Fig. 6. A weight ratio of 0.2 between compounds 6 and 1 is equivalent to a ratio of 0.16 between porphyrin units and FHBC units in the blends (Table 3). The incorporation of porphyrin 2 into the FHBC 1/PC61BM bulk heterojunction device did not significantly enhance the overall efficiency of the device. Although there is an increase in current density compared with the FHBC 1/PC61BM bulk heterojunction, it is accompanied by a decrease in Voc and fill factor, leading to comparable power conversion efficiencies (PCE 0.8%). This is in contrast to devices containing the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 where there is an increase in Jsc while similar levels for Voc and FF are maintained. This result can be rationalized in the following way. With the porphyrin covalently attached to the FHBC core, the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 will have the tendency to reside in the donor FHBC domain of the bulk heterojunction. This allows more efficient charge separation and transport after photo-excitation of the active layer. On the other hand, the incorporation of porphyrin 2 into the FHBC 1/PC61BM bulk heterojunction may interrupt desirable ordered morphology and adversely affect device performance. The zinc porphyrin 2-Zn and the FHBC-zinc porphyrin hybrid 6-Zn were also used as dye additives in FHBC 1/PC61BM bulk heterojunction OPVs. As in the case of the free-base porphyrin derivatives, the FHBC-zinc porphyrin hybrid 6-Zn outperformed the zinc porphyrin 2-Zn as an additive in the FHBC 1/PC61BM bulk heterojunction devices (Table 3). It is interesting to note that the free-base porphyrin additives functioned better than the zinc porphyrin additives. The reason behind this observation is unclear at this stage and will be the subject of a further study. During synthesis and purification, the zinc porphyrin derivatives appear to be less stable than the free-base porphyrin derivatives. Metallated porphyrins have been known to de-metallate in solution and/or in acidic media. This may be a factor affecting their device performance as device fabrication involves solution processing and exposure to acidic environments.

In preliminary studies, morphology of blend films was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface morphology of thin films was examined using tapping mode AFM. The samples were prepared by spin coating the material of interest on silicon substrate (25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, 2000 rpm). The tapping mode AFM images of the thin films of blends of FHBC 1, FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 and quinoxalinoporphyrin 2 with PC61BM are shown in Fig. 10. Nano-scale phase separation was observed in all three blend films. The blend of 1 and PC61BM film gave the roughest surface topography (0–10 nm roughness) with domain sizes of ∼100 nm (Fig. 10a). The blend films became smoother (<3 nm roughness) with the addition of the porphyrin additives 2 and 6 (Fig. 10b and c). Interestingly, the addition of the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 caused greater phase separation while the addition of the quinoxalinoporphyrin 2 appeared to give smaller phase domains. These differences in film morphology are likely to influence device performance. However, it is premature to discuss correlations between morphology and device performance for this system at this stage, as further experiments are required. X-Ray scattering experiments on blend films are currently under investigation to determine the degree of ordered structures in these blends.


A fluorenyl hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (FHBC)-porphyrin hybrid material was synthesised for the first time. Photoluminescence studies showed quenching of the FHBC fluorescence by the porphyrin units indicating efficient energy transfer. The performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices with the FHBC-porphyrin hybrid 6 as the donor material and fullerene derivative (PC61BM) as the acceptor material was modest (PCE = 0.3%) compared with the FHBC 1 device (PCE = 0.8%). Interestingly, BHJ devices containing ternary blends of 1, 6 and PC61BM performed better than blends of 6/PC61BM or 1/PC61BM. A maximum efficiency of 1.2% was achieved with a 1/6/PC61BM blend ratio of 5:1:12 by weight. The spectral response of the devices indicate a small contribution to the photocurrent by the porphyrin units. As such, the improvement in device performance in the ternary blends is likely to be a result of changes in active layer film morphology. Qunioxalino-porphyrin 2 and metallated derivative 2-Zn and 6-Zn were also tested in devices and showed a decrease in performance compared with FHBC-prophyrin hybrid 6. Studies are in progress to probe the changes in thin film morphology in ternary blends.


All reactions were performed using anhydrous solvent under an inert atmosphere unless stated otherwise. Silica gel (Merck 9385 Kieselgel 60) was used for flash chromatography. Thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck Kieselgel 60 silica gel on glass (0.25 mm thick). 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were carried out using either the Varian Inova-400 (400 MHz), the Varian Inova-500 (500 MHz) or the Bruker AMX 400 (400 MHz) instruments. Mass spectra were recorded with a MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Reflex 2 (DCTB as matrix). IR spectra were obtained on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer while UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Cary 50 UV-vis spectrometer. Photoluminescence was measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter. Melting points were determined on a Büchi 510 melting point apparatus. Elemental analyses were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer EA 2400 (for C H) and commercially through CMAS, Victoria. FHBC compound 1 and quinoxalino-porphyrins 2, 2-Zn and 5 have been reported previously. All other compounds and reagents are commercially available.

At this stage, sublimation of the bis(pincolborolane) was observed. Freshly distilled DMF (10 mL) was added and the reaction was heated at 80 °C for 14 h. The reaction was cooled and MeOH (10 mL) was added. The resulting yellow precipitate was collected and washed with MeOH (3 × 50 mL).

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P AI 4083) was spin coated (5000 rpm) on patterned ITO glass which was washed by detergent, deionized water, methanol, acetone and 2-propanol in ultrasonication bath and UV/ozone treated. The films were baked at 150 °C for 5 min in air. Solution of FHBC compounds and PC61BM (25 mg mL−1) were prepared in chlorobenzene separately. The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 2 h and cooled down to room temperature before they were mixed together. Blend solutions (donor–acceptor 1:2) were made by mixing appropriate volumes of the solutions. The resulting solutions were stirred for 30 min and spin coated (1500 rpm) on the PEDOT:PSS films. TiOx precursor solution (1:200 in methanol) was deposited on the active layer by spin coating (2000 rpm) to form ∼10 nm of TiOx layer. The films were exposed to air for about 20 min at room temperature for hydrolysis or baked at 150 °C for 15 s (total air exposure time was about 10 min). The films were transferred to a metal evaporation chamber and aluminium (100 nm) was deposited through a shadow mask (active area was 0.20 cm2) at approximately 1 × 10−6 torr. Film thickness was determined by Veeco Dektak 150 + Surface Profiler. The thickness of the photoactive layers was optimised for each of the donor–acceptor blends and was typically between 60 and 70 nm. The solar cells were illuminated at 100 mW cm−2 using 1 kW Oriel solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter in air and J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. For accurate measurements, the light intensity was calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell (PVmeasurements Inc.) certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Spectral response was measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter, using monochromatic light from a Xe lamp in combination with a monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 130). A calibrated Si cell was used as a reference.


Tapping mode AFM (NanoScope II, Dimension, Digital Instrument Inc.) was carried out with commercially available tapping mode tips. The scanning area was between 10 × 10μm2 and 1 × 1 μm2. The AFM samples were prepared by spin casting PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P AI 4083, 5000 rpm) on silicon substrate followed by the material of interest (25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, 2000 rpm).
