We design and synthesize monodisperse fused-ring oligomer molecules benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) flanked with electron-withdrawing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). A tiny change in the side chain induces significant variation in crystallinity, phase separation, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the semiconductors. BDTS-2DPP with linear alkylthio substituents exhibits a much higher hole mobility of 1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the branched alkyl substituted BDT-2DPP (3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The LUMO (−3.49 eV) and HOMO (−5.28 eV) energy levels of BDTS-2DPP are lower than those of BDT-2DPP (−3.46 eV and −5.23 eV) due to the π-acceptor capability of the sulfur atom. Fullerene-free organic solar cells using BDTS-2DPP as a donor and monodisperse fused-ring oligomer molecule IEIC as an acceptor exhibit higher open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill factor and power conversion efficiency (PCE, 5.29%) than the BDT-2DPP control devices (PCE = 4.00%) with the conventional structure. The inverted devices based on BDTS-2DPP:IEIC show an improved PCE of 6.03% relative to the conventional devices. Atomic force microscopy, grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction and resonant soft X-ray scattering are used to deeply investigate the molecular packing, phase separation and surface aggregation of the blended films and to understand the effect of molecular side chains. We find that the linear alkylthio substitution in BDTS-2DPP improves the crystallinity and unexpectedly reserves small phase separation domains in the blend.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure are under intense investigation in academic and industrial laboratories because of their potential to enable mass production of light-weight, flexible and cost-effective devices. Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs surpassed 10%, comparable to what was achieved with inorganic materials, such as amorphous silicon. Furthermore, OSCs can be solution-processed over a large area with extrapolated lifetime approaching 7 years.

Monodisperse oligomer molecules (OMs) are “big” molecules with relatively large molecular weights (generally 1000 to 10000), which are between those of small molecules (SMs, molecular weight < 1000) and polymers (molecular weight > 10000). OMs present the advantages of both SMs and polymers, such as a defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, good batch reproducibility, good solution film-forming properties and easy purification. Recently, considerable efforts were dedicated to developing OMs for OSCs, and the highest PCEs of solution-processed OSCs based on OM donors and fullerene acceptors were >9% in single junction devices.
Fullerenes and their derivatives are the dominant electron-acceptor materials in BHJ OSCs, because they possess chemical properties that facilitate exciton dissociation and electron transport. However, fullerenes have a few disadvantages, such as restricted electronic tuning, weak absorption in the visible region, and easy diffusion and aggregation, leading to instability of morphology in the blended films. Therefore, novel alternative electron acceptors with strong and broad absorption spectra and appropriate energy levels are necessary for OSCs. In the past years, considerable efforts were dedicated to the development of non-fullerene acceptors, but fullerene-free OSCs significantly underperformed fullerene-based devices and most of them exhibited low PCEs of <4%. Very recently, promising PCEs of >6% were achieved for fullerene-free OSCs. Polymer electron donors were widely applied in fullerene-free OSCs, whereas very limited SM and OM donors were investigated for solution-processed fullerene-free devices, and most of them showed relatively low PCEs of 2–3%. Very few papers reported that fullerene-free OSCs based on SM and OM donors have shown PCEs of 4–5%.
In terms of morphology control, high-crystallinity SMs and OMs are expected to form a highly ordered structure and improve charge mobility, but tend to self-aggregate and form large phase separation domains in donor:acceptor blends, which are unfavorable for exciton dissociation. Usually, high crystallinity and small phase separation do not coexist in blended films. Finding a trade-off between crystallinity and phase separation through molecular design is a challenge for SM and OM-based blended films.
In this study, we designed and synthesized OMs based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) flanked with electron-withdrawing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units (Fig. 1a). A tiny change in the side chain induces significant variation in crystallinity, phase separation, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the OMs. BDTS-2DPP with linear alkylthio substituents exhibits a much higher hole mobility of 1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the branched alkyl substituted BDT-2DPP (3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), measured by space charge limited current (SCLC). Moreover, due to the π-acceptor capability of the sulfur atom, the energy levels of BDTS-2DPP are lower than those of BDT-2DPP. Fullerene-free all-OM OSCs with conventional structure using BDTS-2DPP as a donor and OM IEIC as an acceptor exhibit higher PCEs (5.29%) than the BDT-2DPP control devices (4.00%). The inverted OSCs based on BDTS-2DPP:IEI1C show an improved PCE of 6.03% relative to the conventional structure. The PCE of 6.03% is the best value reported for solution-processed fullerene-free SM and OM OSCs. Interestingly, we find that the linear alkylthio substitution in BDTS-2DPP improves the crystallinity and unexpectedly reserves small phase separation domains in the blend.

The only difference between BDTS-2DPP and BDT-2DPP is the side chain on thiophene. Side chains in conjugated molecules and polymers play an important role in tuning solubility, electronic energy levels and charge transport. The sulfur atom has some π-acceptor capability due to the formation of pπ(C)–dπ(S) orbital overlap where divalent sulfur accepts the π-electron from the p-orbital of the carbon–carbon double bond into its empty 3d-orbitals. Furthermore, the topology of the alkyl chains appended to the molecular backbone is a critical factor impacting the structural order and thereby charge transport properties; relative to branched alkyls, linear alkyls benefit intermolecular packing. The bond angle of C–S–C for BDTS-2DPP and C–C–C for BDT-2DPP, calculated by density functional theory (DFT), is 106° and 116°, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI). The different bond angles, the S⋯S interaction and the alkyl shape affect the molecular packing and further blend film morphology.

Due to the same molecular main chain, thin films of BDTS-2DPP and BDT-2DPP show a very similar broad absorption profile and an optical bandgap of 1.65 eV (Fig. 1b). BDTS-2DPP in solution shows a slightly higher maximum extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S2, ESI) at 622 nm than BDT-2DPP (1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 620 nm). The LUMO (−3.49 eV) and HOMO (−5.28 eV) of BDTS-2DPP calculated from CV measurements (Fig. 1c and S3) are slightly lower than those of BDT-2DPP (LUMO = −3.46 eV, HOMO = −5.23 eV), because of the π-acceptor capability of sulfur atoms (Table 1).

The BDTS-2DPP film shows a strong X-ray reflection peak (100) at 2θ = 5.18°, a second-order diffraction peak (200) at 2θ = 10.08° and even a weak third-order diffraction peak (300) at 2θ = 15.04°, corresponding to a d100-spacing distance of 17.09 Å, a d200-spacing distance of 8.78 Å and a d300-spacing distance of 5.89 Å (Fig. S4). Relative to the BDT-2DPP film, the BDTS-2DPP film exhibits a stronger sharp peak (100) with a smaller d100-spacing distance (BDTS-2DPP: 17.09 Å; BDT-2DPP: 18.40 Å), suggesting stronger intermolecular interaction and more ordered structure. As a result, the BDTS-2DPP film exhibits a very high hole mobility of up to 1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by SCLC (Fig. S5), which is higher than that of the BDT-2DPP film (3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).
The OM electron acceptor IEIC also exhibits broad and strong absorption and a relatively high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by SCLC. IEIC has a LUMO of −3.82 eV and a HOMO of −5.42 eV (Fig. 1c), which are lower than those of BDT-2DPP and BDTS-2DPP. The LUMO gaps of 0.33 eV (BDTS-2DPP/IEIC) and 0.36 eV (BDT-2DPP/IEIC) are larger than the empirical value of 0.3 eV needed for efficient exciton dissociation. The difference between the LUMO of IEIC and the HOMO of BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP is >1.4 eV, which could result in high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells. Furthermore, BDT-2DPP, BDTS-2DPP and IEIC have strong absorption at ca. 700 nm (the maximum photon stream density of solar spectra) and relatively high charge carrier mobilities (>10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which are beneficial to producing a high photo-current and fill factor (FF).

We used BDT-2DPP and BDTS-2DPP as donors and IEIC as an acceptor to fabricate all-OM OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP:IEIC/Ca/Al using chloroform (CHCl3) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as processing solvents for active layers. The BDT-2DPP:IEIC (1:1, w/w)-based devices processed with CHCl3 have a weak photovoltaic response, with a low short-circuit current density (JSC) of 1.67 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.55%; while the devices processed from o-DCB show a higher PCE of 2.83%, with a higher JSC of 6.70 mA cm−2 and a higher FF of 0.47 (Table 2). The devices based on BDTS-2DPP:IEIC processed from CHCl3 and o-DCB yield PCEs of 0.76% and 3.56%, respectively, higher than those of the control BDT-2DPP:IEIC system. The lower HOMO energy level and higher hole mobility of BDTS-2DPP are responsible for its enhanced efficiency.

To improve the photovoltaic performance of BDT-2DPP or BDTs-2DPP:IEIC based OSCs, we used the binary solvent method to optimize the morphology of the blended film. The binary solvent consisting of o-DCB and CHCl3 is used as the processing solvent, and different volume ratios (CHCl3/o-DCB, v/v) are scanned (Table 2). The best photovoltaic performance of both BDT-2DPP:IEIC and BDTS-2DPP:IEIC systems is achieved when CHCl3/o-DCB is 2:1 (v/v) (Fig. 2a). The BDT-2DPP-based device shows a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 8.24 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.54 and a PCE of 4.00%. For over 10 devices, the average PCE is 3.81%, which is higher than those achieved from CHCl3 (0.53%) and o-DCB solution (2.62%). The BDTS-2DPP:IEIC based device processed from the CHCl3/o-DCB binary solvent exhibits a VOC of 0.93 V, a JSC of 9.80 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.58, and a PCE of 5.29%. For over 10 devices, the average PCE is 4.98%, which is higher than those achieved from CHCl3 (0.75%) and o-DCB solution (3.50%). The PCE of 5.29% is higher than that obtained from the control BDT-2DPP:IEIC device (4.00%). For these two blended systems, when increasing the o-DCB content in the binary solvent, the VOC is insensitive, while the FF and JSC synchronously first increase and then decrease; when the CHCl3/o-DCB ratio is 2:1 (v/v), both FF and JSC reach the maximum, leading to the highest PCE.
In Fig. 2b, the BDT-2DPP:IEIC blended film processed from CHCl3/o-DCB (2:1, v/v) shows a broad incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum from 300 to 800 nm with the maximum of ca. 40%. The JSC calculated from the integration of the IPCE spectrum with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum is 8.06 mA cm−2, 2% mismatch with the value from the J–V curve. Compared to the BDT-2DPP:IEIC film, the BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended film shows a similar broad IPCE spectrum with a higher maximum of ca. 45% at 700 nm. The JSC calculated from the integration of the IPCE spectrum is 9.61 mA cm−2, 2% mismatch with the value from J–V curves.
Furthermore, we fabricated the inverted OSCs based on BDTS-2DPP:IEIC systems with the structure of ITO/ZnO/BDTS-2DPP:IEIC (1:1, w/w)/MoOx/Ag using the o-DCB/CHCl3 co-solvent. The inverted devices show the PCEs up to 6.03%, with a JSC of 10.87 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.94 V, and a FF of 0.59 (Fig. 2a). The average PCE is 5.69%, which is the highest value reported for solution-processed fullerene-free SM and OM OSCs. Compared to the conventional structure, the inverted device shows a similar broad but higher IPCE spectrum (Fig. 2b).

CHCl3 (boiling point (bp) = 61.2 °C) and o-DCB (bp = 180.5 °C) have very different volatility, leading to different drying rates of the organic film. Slow drying of films processed from o-DCB facilitates the formation of aggregation domains in BHJ films. To confirm this speculation and understand the effect of surface aggregation on photovoltaic performance, the surface morphology of blended films is examined using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The BDT-2DPP:IEIC and BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films processed from the o-DCB solution show much larger aggregation domain sizes relative to the films from the CHCl3 solution (Fig. 3). The use of binary solvent CHCl3/o-DCB (2:1, v/v) further increases the surface roughness and aggregation domain size of the blended films.


Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) is used to investigate the molecular packing of BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films spin-coated from different solvents (Fig. 4). The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of BDT-2DPP:IEIC blended films show only a (100) diffraction peak at q ≈ 0.3–0.4 Å−1 and no (010) peaks are observed, indicating the poorly ordered structure in the blend. Moreover, GIWAXS patterns show no obvious changes among these blended films, indicating that different solvents do not affect the molecular packing. However, molecular side chains affect the molecular packing to a great extent: the strong diffraction peak at q ≈ 1.6–1.7 Å−1 of the BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blend indicates that the π–π stacking is well ordered, which is in contrast to the BDT-2DPP:IEIC system.


The hole and electron mobilities in the BHJ blended films are measured using the SCLC method (Fig. S6–S9,Table 3). The same trend is observed in BDT-2DPP:IEIC and BDTS-2DPP:IEIC systems; as varying processed solvents from CHCl3 to o-DCB and further to CHCl3/o-DCB (2:1, v/v), hole and electron mobilities of both BDT-2DPP:IEIC and BDTS-2DPP:IEIC systems increase gradually. This improvement in charge transport is partly attributed to the increase in the aggregation domain size in blended films. The enhancement in hole and electron mobilities in BHJ films from CHCl3 to o-DCB and further to CHCl3/o-DCB leads to enhancement in JSC and PCE (Table 2).

All BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films processed from CHCl3, o-DCB and the binary solvent exhibit higher hole mobilities (μh = (0.3–1.5) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than BDT-2DPP:IEIC blended films (μh = (0.54–2.5) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films show slightly higher electron mobilities (μe = (0.6–1.6) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than BDT-2DPP:IEIC blended films (μe = (0.46–1.2) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 3). This enhancement in hole and electron mobilities is attributed to the well-ordered π–π stacking in BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films observed from GIWAXS.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) is used to probe the phase separation in BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films. The resonant energy 284.8 eV is selected due to highly enhanced material contrast. There are two peaks (q ≈ 0.01 and 0.08 nm−1) observed for the BDT-2DPP:IEIC blends processed with o-DCB and CHCl3/o-DCB (Fig. 5a). Scattering at off-resonant energy, i.e. 283 eV (where the material contrast is low), does not show a peak at q ≈ 0.08 nm−1 (Fig. S10). This indicates that the peak at q ≈ 0.08 nm−1 is induced by the phase separation of BDT-2DPP and IEIC at 284.8 eV. Scattering at 270 eV (Fig. S11), where the vacuum-material contrast is high, shows a very intense peak at q ≈ 0.01 nm−1, which demonstrates that the peak at q ≈ 0.01 nm−1 is generated from the surface roughness. This can be confirmed by AFM (Fig. 3). Further analysis reveals that BDT-2DPP:IEIC films from o-DCB show reasonably small phase separation with a characteristic median length scale of 37 nm, which is similar to previous cases of high-performance all-polymer or polymer: fullerene systems. Relative to films from o-DCB, high-performance films from the CHCl3/o-DCB solvent (2:1, v/v) have a slightly smaller characteristic median length scale of average 34 nm, which is more close to the exciton diffusion length (ca. 20 nm) in organic materials. In contrast, the BHJ film from CHCl3 with poor photovoltaic performance has almost no phase separation.

R-SoXS can also reveal the average composition variations (relative domain purity), which are indicative of the average purity of donor material and acceptor material domains. In Fig. 5a, the higher the total scattering intensity (integration of the scattering profiles over q), the purer the average domains. Thus, the films from CHCl3, o-DCB and the CHCl3/o-DCB solvent (2:1, v/v) have step by step increased average domain purity. It was reported that the purer domains are favorable to reduce bimolecular recombination. As a result, the devices based on BDT-2DPP:IEIC blended films with the pure domains and appropriate domain sizes spin-coated from the CHCl3/o-DCB solvent (2:1, v/v) show relatively higher JSC and FF, finally the best PCE. The appropriate domain sizes and the pure domains are beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transport, respectively.
For the BDTS-2DPP:IEIC system, the peaks at q ≈ 0.01 of R-SoXS of films processed with o-DCB and CHCl3/o-DCB are generated from the surface roughness as previously demonstrated (Fig. 5b). The median domain size revealed by R-SoXS for BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blends processed with CHCl3, o-DCB and CHCl3/o-DCB is ∼50 nm, ∼28 nm and ∼30 nm, respectively. The big domains are unfavorable for exciton dissociation and thus reduce JSC for BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films processed with CHCl3. It should be noted that, compared to low crystallized BDT-2DPP:IEIC blends, highly ordered BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blends processed with o-DCB and CHCl3/o-DCB show even a smaller domain size and thus higher JSC. Also, the BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blend from the CHCl3/o-DCB has purer domains than that from o-DCB, leading to the enhanced JSC, FF, and PCE.

We designed and synthesized OMs with different side chains based on BDT and DPP units. The linear alkylthio substituted BDTS-2DPP exhibits stronger crystallinity, more ordered structure and much higher hole mobility than the branched alkyl substituted BDT-2DPP. This difference in charge transport properties between BDT-2DPP and BDTS-2DPP affects their photovoltaic properties.

All-OM OSCs based on BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films were fabricated by using different solvents. Relative to single solvent CHCl3 and o-DCB, the use of the binary solvent CHCl3/o-DCB (2:1, v/v) leads to appropriate phase separation domain sizes, higher domain purity, better charge transport properties and better photovoltaic performance of the blended film. The devices based on BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blended films coated from the binary solvent yield higher PCE (5.29%) than the BDT-2DPP:IEIC-based devices with conventional structure (4.00%). The inverted OSCs based on BDTS-2DPP:IEIC show an improved PCE of up to 6.03%.
Molecular packing, surface morphology, phase separation and domain purity in these blended films are investigated by using AFM, GIWAXS and R-SoXS methods. It is clear that the molecular side chain determines molecular packing, the processing solvent greatly affects the morphology, and the phase separation is susceptible to both the molecular side chain and processing solvent. The linear alkylthio substituent enhances the molecular packing and reduces the phase separation size. High crystallinity and small phase separation can coexist in blended films, which is very valuable to molecular design towards high-performance BHJ OSCs.

The synthetic route is shown in Scheme S1. To a three-necked round bottom flask were added compound 1 (224 mg, 0.37 mmol), compound 2 (154 mg, 0.16 mmol), and toluene (20 mL). The mixture was deoxygenated with argon for 30 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (30 mg, 0.026 mmol) was added under argon. The mixture was refluxed for 48 h and then cooled down to room temperature. Water (25 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with chloroform (2 × 25 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. After removing the solvent from filtrate, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether/chloroform (1:1) as an eluent yielding a blue black solid (203 mg, 75%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.96 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 8.93 (d, J = 3.9 Hz, 2H), 7.66 (s, 2H), 7.55 (d, J = 5.1 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 7.33 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 7.30 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 7.23 (m, 2H), 3.99 (m, 8H), 3.02 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.85 (m, 12H), 1.29 (m, 48H), 0.86 (m, 30H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 161.58, 161.48, 141.83, 141.33, 139.97, 139.33, 139.09, 138.09, 137.47, 137.29, 136.90, 135.63, 132.94, 130.56, 129.92, 129.42, 128.91, 128.58, 126.26, 123.27, 120.12, 108.46, 108.24, 46.12, 45.96, 39.58, 39.32, 39.16, 32.03, 30.60, 30.38, 29.76, 29.45, 28.84, 28.74, 28.49, 23.92, 23.68, 23.34, 23.30, 22.87, 14.33, 14.30, 14.23.

OSCs were fabricated with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP:IEIC/Ca/Al (conventional) or ITO/ZnO/BDTS-2DPP:IEIC/MoOx/Ag (inverted). The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 10 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. For conventional devices, a thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 15 min. For inverted devices, ZnO electron transport layers were prepared onto the ITO glass through spin coating at 3000 rpm from a ZnO precursor solution. Then the ZnO substrates were immediately baked in air at 200 °C for 30 min. A solution (totally 20–30 mg mL−1) of the BDT-2DPP or BDTS-2DPP:IEIC blend was subsequently spin-coated (800 rpm) to form a photosensitive layer (ca. 130 nm). The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Calcium (ca. 15 nm) and aluminium (ca. 50 nm) layers were subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. A thin layer (5 nm) of MoOx was deposited as the anode interlayer, and 80 nm of Ag was deposited as the top electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5 G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell. The IPCE spectrum was measured by using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.


GIWAXS measurements were performed at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). Samples were prepared on Si substrates using identical blend solutions to those used in OSC devices. The 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.11°–0.15°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected using a Dectris Pilatus 2M photon counting detector.


R-SoXS transmission measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the ALS. Samples for R-SoXS measurements were prepared on a PSS modified Si substrate under the same conditions as those used for OSC device fabrication, and then transferred by floating in water to a 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 mm thick Si frame (Norcada Inc.). Two dimensional scattering patterns were collected on an in-vacuum CCD camera (Princeton Instrument PI-MTE). The beam size at the sample is B100 mm by 200 mm. The composition variation (or relative domain purity) over the length scales probed can be extracted by integrating scattering profiles to yield the total scattering intensity. The purer the average domains are, the higher the total scattering intensity.
