Three new chlorine substituted non-fullerene acceptors (COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m) based on a highly electron-rich core, COi6, are designed and synthesized, showing ultra-narrow bandgaps as low as 1.31 eV. The oxygen-containing conjugated COi6 possesses a strong electron-donating capacity, resulting in strong intramolecular charge transfer and intermolecular π–π stacking at the derived acceptors. Three kinds of chlorine-substituted end groups have been chosen to react with the COi6 core in order to study the effect of the chlorine atom positioning on the performance of the final acceptor materials. The solar cells based on these three acceptor materials and a spectrally complementary polymer donor, PTB7-Th, have been systemically studied. It is noted that the mixed acceptor, COi6-2Cl-m, shows a relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.22%, which is better than that of the other two isomer-free acceptors. With detailed investigations on five different mixing ratios of ternary cells using two isomer-free small molecules as a co-acceptor (COi6-2Cl-γ:COi6-2Cl-δ), the highest PCE of 9.30% was obtained in ternary cells when the ratio of COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ was 1:1. From this observation, it is demonstrated that mixed materials in appropriate proportions are better than certain structure materials, COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ, in our system.

Since the first bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have been reported, scientists have put a lot of effort into materials or devices. In addition to optimizing the device structure of organic solar cells (OSCs), the most important thing for improving the PCE of solar cells is to design and synthesize new organic solar cell materials. In recent years, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecules have become effective acceptor materials for organic solar cells. In this structure, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) formed, which is caused by light induction and leads to a red shift of the absorption spectrum and a decrease in energy gap. In addition, the molecular energy level could be easily tuned by adjusting the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor (A) unit in the A–D–A nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), which can match the energy level of the donor materials.

The photovoltaic performance of solar cells is closely related to the light absorption, energy levels, charge mobility and morphology. Extensive research has proven that introducing halogen atoms into the end group is an effective strategy for regulating the π-electron behavior of organic semiconductors. As is well known, fluorination is a common method to modify the distribution of π-electrons of organic semiconductors due to the smallest atomic radius and strongest electronegativity of fluorine in the halogen group. Besides, the addition of fluorine can enhance the intermolecular and intramolecular interaction through F⋯S, F⋯H, and F⋯π noncovalent effects, and meanwhile improve the electron transfer ability, which is beneficial for increasing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Although the electronegativity of the chlorine atom is weaker than that of the fluorine atom, several studies have shown that chlorination can downshift the LUMO energy level of the small molecular acceptor more efficiently than fluorination due to the empty 3d orbitals of Cl, which are not available in F. Our group and other researchers have tried to introduce chlorine atoms into the donors and acceptors, and achieved good results in the past few years. In the recent research work of our group, the differences between the introduction of chlorine and fluorine atoms to small-molecule acceptors were deeply investigated. According to the report, the chlorine substituted acceptor material (IDIC-4Cl) forms a molecular interlocked network induced by the strong Cl⋯S intermolecular interactions in single crystals, which leads to a more planar molecular configuration and more compacted molecular packing. As a result, introducing Cl atoms in the acceptor materials to adjust the π-electron behavior of organic semiconductors has been proven to be a very effective method to enhance the PCE of the corresponding devices.
Last year, Ding and his coworkers synthesized a series of molecules, by inserting electron-rich oxygen atoms into the traditional fused-ring electron acceptors. As a result, the planarity and electron donating ability of the fused-ring core are improved. For example, CO5 with a ladder-type backbone shows better planarity and electron-donating capability than IDT with a carbon-bridge. Then, they reported the hexacyclic carbon–oxygen-bridged ladder-type building block, COi6, and use COi6 to synthesize three narrow band gap A–D–A acceptors, COi6IC, COi6FIC and COi6DFIC. These acceptors all show a narrow optical band gap, near-infrared absorption and high PCE.
In order to study the effect of the position of chlorine atoms on the properties of the acceptor materials, we chose the electron-rich core COi6 and three different chlorine-substituted end groups to synthesize three acceptors COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m, as shown in Scheme 1. COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ are dichloro-substituted materials with determined chlorine atom positions, while COi6-2Cl-m is a blend of COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and an isomer with asymmetric end groups. Calculated according to the 1H NMR of COi6-2Cl-m as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI), the ratio of the two end groups (IC-Cl-γ and IC-Cl-δ) is 0.43:0.57 in COi6-2Cl-m. All of the three acceptors have intense absorption from 600 to 950 nm. Due to the 3d empty orbitals of chlorine atoms, chlorinated end-groups can enhance non-covalent interactions between molecules, resulting in good molecular stacking and charge transfer. PTB7-Th with complementary absorption of the three oxygen-containing acceptors was selected as a polymer donor to manufacture devices. As a result, the two dichloro-substituted materials with determined chlorine atom positions, COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ, show a PCE of 8.82% and 8.41%, respectively. Moreover, the PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-m cells gave the best PCE of 9.22%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 20.78 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.3%, which is better than the two isomer-free materials. For further study, we made five ternary solar cells using COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ as the co-acceptor. The weight ratios between donor polymer and co-acceptors were fixed to 1:1, while the content of COi6-2Cl-γ in the co-acceptors is 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70%, respectively. The highest PCE of 9.30% was obtained in ternary cells with an equal ratio of the two isomer-free small molecules, and this device also showed the highest electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, the mixed isomers of COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ reported here showed better PCE, which indicated that the mixing of isomers may also be a strategy to optimize the performance of the relative systems.

The final synthetic route is shown in Scheme 2. Knoevenagel condensation of COi6-CHO with IC-Cl-γ, IC-Cl-δ and IC-Cl-m gave COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m in yields of 84%, 86% and 76%, respectively. The structure of the molecules was confirmed by NMR (1H NMR and 1H–1H COSY) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The exact structures of the two isomer-free acceptors are determined by combining the 1H–1H COSY (Fig. 1) of the two isomer-free acceptors and the 1H NMR of the two end groups (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI), respectively. The 1H–1H COSY correlations between H-ε and H-δ determine the exact structure of COi6-2Cl-γ, while the 1H–1H COSY correlations between H-β and H-γ indicate the structure of COi6-2Cl-δ. And the ratio of IC-Cl-γ to IC-Cl-δ is about 0.43:0.57 in mixture COi6-2Cl-m calculated from their NMR data in Fig. S9 (ESI). These compounds have good solubility in common solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene. And the synthesis and purification details are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI).

As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI), the extinction coefficients of COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m are 2.31 × 105, 2.09 × 105 and 2.31 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1, respectively. The three materials all show high extinction coefficients, which is mainly due to the enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer effect. Moreover, all acceptors have very intense absorption from 600 to 950 nm in the near infrared region. In the films (Fig. 2a), the absorption peaks of COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m are about at 743 nm and 819 nm, showing not much difference. From solution to film, the redshifts for the low-energy peaks of the three dichloro-substituted materials are 49 nm, suggesting that the intermolecular Cl⋯S interaction leads to strong J-aggregation in the solid state. In the film, three dichloro-substituted materials have two absorption peaks, which greatly broadens the absorption range. And all three acceptors have an approximate onset absorption of 946 nm, corresponding to the optical band gap (1.31 eV). As a result, the chlorine atoms enhance the electron-withdrawing ability of the terminal unit and enhance the ICT, resulting in a narrow band gap and a more obvious absorption redshift. By comparison, the PTB7-Th film absorbs 500–800 nm light, which is complementary to the absorption of COi6 acceptors (600–950 nm). The energy levels for COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energy levels estimated from CV measurements are shown in Table 1. The HOMO levels for COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m are −5.46 eV, −5.46 eV and −5.47 eV, respectively, and the LUMO levels are −4.05 eV, −4.02 eV and −4.02 eV, respectively. From the results, although chlorine atoms can lower both the HOMO and LUMO levels, they are more capable of downshifting the LUMO level. As Fig. 2b shows, the donor PTB7-Th exhibits a HOMO at −5.27 eV and a LUMO at −3.48 eV, which matches with all three acceptors. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) model to obtain a deep understanding of the geometric and electronic properties of COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ, bearing methyl substituted alkyl chains for simplicity. The optimized geometries of the acceptors in the energy minimization structure are shown in Fig. S21 (ESI). The calculated HOMO levels of COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ are −5.49 eV and −5.48 eV, respectively, and the calculated LUMO levels are −3.54 eV and −3.54 eV, respectively. From the side view, the backbones of the two molecules twist into an S shape, because the two oxygen atoms in the core unit are not in the same plane. In addition, the torsional angles between the end group and core unit in two dichloro-substituted molecules are about 0.61°, which is not conducive to the intermolecular π–π packing.

The OSCs were prepared by the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The effect of introducing chlorine atoms on the photovoltaic performance of A–D–A small molecules was studied. We choose polymer PTB7-Th as the donor material, which absorbs 500–800 nm light in the film, complementary to that of COi6 acceptors. The most-optimized photovoltaic parameters of the three polymer solar cell (PSC) devices are listed in Table 2. The optimal donor:acceptor weight ratio was 1:1 with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene solution, including 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. The PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-γ-based device had a PCE of 8.82% with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 20.33 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.84%, while the PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-δ-based device presents a lower Voc (0.67 V), Jsc (20.65 mA cm−2) and FF (60.81%), leading to a lower PCE of 8.41%. However, the device of mixing material COi6-2Cl-m with better FF (64.32%) gave the best PCE of 9.22%, with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 20.78 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.32%. As Fig. 3b shows, the integrated Jsc of COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m related devices are 19.45 mA cm−2, 19.72 mA cm−2 and 19.88 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the device results. In order to study the effect of mixing ratio on the performance of the device, we fabricated five solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/D:A1:A2/MoO3/Ag, where D is PTB7-Th, A1 is COi6-2Cl-γ and A2 is COi6-2Cl-δ. The weight ratio between D and A1 + A2 was fixed to 1:1, while the content of A1 in the acceptors is 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70%, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters and electron mobility of five ternary cells are shown in Table 2. We found that adjusting the ratio of D:A1:A2 can achieve good efficiency by improving FF and electron mobility. The highest PCE of 9.30% was obtained in ternary cells (D:A1:A2 = 1:0.5:0.5) with the highest FF of 67.62% and the highest electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In order to further study the exciton recombination process, Jsc was measured as a function of light intensity and shown in Fig. S19 (ESI), while the slopes of PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-γ, PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-δ and PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-m based devices were 0.942, 0.936 and 0.959, respectively. And the best ternary cell (D:A1:A2 = 1:0.5:0.5) shows the highest slope (0.976) indicating that mixing materials in appropriate proportions can lead to efficient dissociation of excitons and reduce bimolecular recombination.

The morphological characteristics of three donor:acceptor blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4a–c, three PTB7-Th:dichloro-acceptor blend films presented a relatively uniform and smooth surface with root-mean square roughness (Rq) about 1.5 nm. Moreover, the blend films of PTB7-Th:dichloro-acceptor exhibit a uniform fibrillar interpenetrating network structure with a suitable scale, which helps to achieve better exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in higher Jsc and FF. In the TEM images (Fig. 4d–f), the bright and dark regions of all the PTB7-Th:dichloro-acceptor blends are relatively uniformly distributed in those three samples and the phase separation scales are suitable, resulting in a decent PCE. The results of TEM are consistent with AFM, which demonstrates that introducing a suitable number of chlorine atoms will improve the film morphology.

In order to further explore the molecular packing and microstructure of the corresponding blends, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the fully apparent (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction were observed in the 2D GIWAXS patterns, indicating the presence of a face-on oriented π–π stacking in the blends, which may result in better charge transport. And the other two similar GIWAXS patterns (Fig. 5b and c) show weaker (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction. As shown in Fig. 5d, the (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction located at 1.74, 1.66 and 1.68 Å−1, which correspond to the π–π stacking distances are 3.61, 3.78 and 3.74 Å for PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-γ, PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-δ and PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-m blend films, respectively. In addition, the calculated lamellar distances are 23.27, 22.44 and 22.44 Å for PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-γ-, PTB7-Th-COi6-2Cl-δ- and PTB7-Th:COi6-2Cl-m-based blend films according to the (100) diffraction peaks shown in Fig. 5e, respectively. The π–π stacking distances of the three materials are similar, which indicates that the intermolecular Cl⋯S and Cl⋯π interaction makes the molecules pack more closely but the position of chlorine substitution has little effect on the π–π stacking.

In conclusion, three new chlorine substitution NFAs (COi6-2Cl-γ, COi6-2Cl-δ and COi6-2Cl-m) are synthesized. After blending with donor polymer PTB7-Th, the COi6-2Cl-m-based device shows the highest PCE of 9.22% benefited from the higher Jsc (20.78 mA cm−2) and FF (64.32%). However, two chlorine atom position determining dichloro-substituted materials, COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ, show the PCE of 8.82% and 8.41%, respectively. In order to study the effect of mixing ratio on the performance of the device, we fabricated five ternary cells with different ratios of the materials in the active layer, and the best ternary cell (D:A1:A2 = 1:0.5:0.5) shows the PCE of 9.30%. As a result, in ternary cells, mixed materials in appropriate proportions are better than the certain structure materials, COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ. Being different from some reported systems, the mixed isomers of COi6-2Cl-γ and COi6-2Cl-δ reported here showed improved PCE in this oxygen-bridge containing fused core system, which indicated that mixing isomers may also be a strategy to further pump the performance of a relative system.
