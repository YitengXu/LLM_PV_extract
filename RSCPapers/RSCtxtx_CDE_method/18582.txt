Small donor–acceptor molecules with EDOT as donor unit have been synthesized and evaluated as active material in organic solar cells.

Donor materials based on conjugated molecules are subject to a growing interest in the general context of organic photovoltaic cells (OPV). Compared to polydisperse conjugated polymers, molecular donors present the advantage of unequivocal chemical structure and better reproducibility of synthesis, purification, electronic properties of the materials and performances of the resulting devices. On the other hand, molecules appear as more appropriate for detailed analyses of structure–properties relationships.
During the past few years this approach has generated much research effort and many donors derived from various basic structures such as triphenylamines, oligothiophenes, squaraines, diketopyrrolopyrroles or borondipyrromethenes have been synthesized and evaluated in OPV devices. These molecular donors generally combine donor (D) and acceptor (A) units to create an internal charge transfer (ICT) which produces at the same time a narrowing of the optical band gap and a decrease of the HOMO level and thus an increase of the OPV cell voltage.
In recent years, conversion efficiencies in the 4–7% range have been reported for OPV cells based on various structures. Many of these donors associate symmetrical D–A–D, A–D–A, D(A)3 or even more complex structures with rather large molecular weights.
However, recent work has reported high efficiencies obtained with simple D–A systems. In fact, minimizing the structural complexity and molecular weight of active materials and defining simpler and cleaner synthetic routes will have important implications regarding the economic and environmental aspects of future industrial development of OPV. Until now, aryl amines have been used as donor block in most of these small D–A molecular systems. In this context, we report here the first examples of small D–A systems in which 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) units are used as donor group. EDOT is known as an interesting building block which combines strong electron-donor properties with self-organisation ability associated with non-covalent sulfur-oxygen interactions. D–A molecules with variable EDOT content have been synthesized (1–3) and a preliminary evaluation of their potential as donor material in OPV cells is presented.
The synthesis of the target compounds is depicted in Scheme 1. Compounds 14,12,10,7 and 5 were prepared using known procedures. Bromination of 2-formyl bithienyl 14 with NBS gave compound 13 which was coupled with the Stille reagent of EDOT 12 to give aldehyde 11 in 60% yield. The Stille reagent of di-EDOT 10 was coupled with bromoaldehyde 9 to give aldehyde 8 (yield 50%). Aldehyde 7 was brominated with NBS and the resulting compound 6 was coupled with the stannylated derivative of 2-hexyl-EDOT 5 to give aldehyde 4 in 48% yield. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes 11, 8 and 4 with malonodinitrile gave the target compounds 1, 2 and 3 in 72, 78 and 82% yield respectively.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of compounds 1–3 in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 1) show that introduction of EDOT units in the structure produces a progressive bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (λmax) and an increase of the molecular absorption coefficient (ε) (Table 1). As expected, the optical band gap Eg estimated from the long wavelength absorption edge of the spectra of thin films spin-cast on glass decreases from 1.89 eV for 1 to 1.71 eV for 3. X-ray diffraction study showed that all materials are amorphous. An analysis of the effects of thermal treatment on the film reveals a progressive decrease of absorbance and blue shift of λmax above 100 °C in air, indicative of a beginning of degradation without any sign of material reorganization.

Cyclic voltammetry was performed in CH2Cl2 in the presence of Bu4NPF6 as supporting electrolyte. The anodic peak potential Epa decreases from 1.06 V for 1 to 0.70 V for 3, reflecting the increasing donor character of the chain with the EDOT content. The oxidation wave of compounds 1 and 2 is irreversible due to the subsequent coupling of the cation radical to form longer conjugated systems. In contrast, oxidation is quasi-reversible for the end-capped compound 3. The CV of the three compounds, exhibits an irreversible reduction wave in the −1.00 to −1.20 V region with a peak potential (Epr) shifting to more negative potential as the number of EDOT increases (Table 1).
The potentialities of compounds 1–3 as donor material for OPV have been evaluated on bilayer planar heterojunction solar cells of 0.28 cm2 active area, realized by thermal deposition under high vacuum. The donor layer was evaporated on ITO substrates pre-coated by a 40 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS. A 30 nm layer of C60 was then deposited and the devices were completed by deposition of 40 nm of calcium and 100 nm of aluminium. In each case, the optimal thickness of the donor layer (d) was determined by a cursory optimization. Table 2. lists the main photovoltaic characteristics of the three cells under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination with a power light intensity of 90 mW cm−2. The cell based on donor 1 gave a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.51 mA cm−2 and a surprisingly low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.347 V, combined with a low fill factor (FF) these data lead to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.41%. The small optimal film thickness (d) found in this case (15 nm) suggests that PCE is limited by low hole mobility and/or short exciton diffusion length.

Although better results were obtained with donor 3 with in particular a better Voc, Jsc and PCE remain low. Finally the best results were obtained with donor 2 with a Jsc of 5.40 mA cm−2 and PCE exceeding 2.0% (Fig. 2).
As expected from CV data, donor 2 leads to a higher Voc than 3, while the optimal donor thickness (30 nm) is the largest among the series. This suggests that for donor 2 the molecular packing leads to better hole mobility and/or exciton diffusion length. Attempts to determine the hole mobility of compounds 1–3 in field-effect transistors failed. This result is strongly reminiscent of previous work on a large series of EDOT-containing systems in which field-effect was observed only in one case. The hole mobility of compounds 2 and 3 has been evaluated by the space-charge limited current method on hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donor/Au. The obtained values of 1.60 × 10−5 and 5.20 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively confirm the expected higher mobility for donor 2.
The external quantum efficiency spectra of the cells based on 2 and 3 exhibit a broad response extending from 350 to 700 nm (Fig. 3). For donor 3 two maxima of ca 10% are observed around 400 and 560 nm. The spectrum of the cell based on 2 also shows two maxima that are tentatively assigned to the contribution of the π–π* and charge-transfer bands to the photo-current, although the relative contribution of the π–π* transition is larger than what could be expected on the basis of the absorption spectrum.

Fig. 4 compares the UV-Vis absorption spectra of compounds 2 and 3 in solution and as thin films vacuum deposited on glass. For donor 2 the spectrum of the film shows a slight red shift of λmax, a ca 100 nm shift of the long wavelength absorption edge and a broadening of the absorption band which presents a FWHM of 220 nm.
For donor 3, λmax undergoes a ca 30 nm hypsochromic shift and a smaller broadening of the spectrum (FWHM = 162 nm). These contrasting behaviours suggest that replacement of one thiophene by EDOT strongly affects the molecular organization in the solid state. The spectrum of donor 2 appears consistent with the formation of J aggregates whereas that of compound 3 suggests the presence of H aggregates. Such opposite behaviours have been previously observed for EDOT containing systems and have been shown to strongly affect the OPV performances.
To summarize the first examples of small D–A systems using EDOT as donor unit have been synthesized and evaluated in OPV cells. While these preliminary results clearly demonstrate that EDOT can represent an interesting building block for the design of D–A systems, our results also confirm that a judicious use of the EDOT unit remains delicate. Therefore, deeper investigations of structure–properties relationships are needed to elucidate the intra- and inter-molecular effects of EDOT on the electronic properties of D–A systems and hence to design materials with optimum performances.
