In this study, we determined that the film morphologies, crystallinities, and optical properties of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite (PVSK) layers can be manipulated by incorporating a small amount of ethylammonium iodide (EAI) into the perovskite precursor solution. For our EAI-derived films, we observed higher absorbances at higher wavelengths and higher degrees of crystallinity, both of which were associated with the higher surface coverage of the PVSK films. The optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from 9.4 ± 0.76 to 10.2 ± 0.58% after the addition of 0.5 vol% of EAI. Devices based on EAI-containing PVSK exhibited extremely high stability, retaining approximately 80% of their PCEs (T80) under accelerated heating (65 °C) in a dark N2-filled glove box for over 360 h. In contrast, the corresponding normal device was relatively sensitive to this temperature, with a T80 value of only 45 h. The improved device performance (PCE, stability) arose as a result of the presence of EAI suppressing the crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.

Photovoltaic (PV) devices based on organic lead halide perovskites (PVSK) have several attractive features, including the ability to use solution processing, their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), the ease of synthesis of their active layer materials, and the capacity to use roll-to-roll production methods. PVSK PV devices became even more popular after their PCEs skyrocketed from 3.8% to greater than 19.3% within a mere four years. PVSK materials have been used as efficient light harvesting absorbers in solar devices based on thick or thin planar heterojunctions or mesoscopic metal oxides. For example, when combined with a compact yttrium-doped TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and a cobalt and lithium co-doped spiro-OMeTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene] hole transport layer (HTL), the PCE of a device featuring a CH3NH3(MA)PbI3−xClx-derived planar heterojunction reached 19.3%. Improvements in processing—including varying the fabrication conditions (interdiffusion of a precursor stacking layer; varying the precursor's composition and employing a non-stoichiometric precursor ratio), applying post-treatment conditions (thermal or solvent annealing), solvent engineering, applying additives, and incorporating interfacial layers—have also led to enhancements in the performance of PVSK devices.

Long-term stability is the biggest challenge in the commercial application of perovskite-based PV devices. With the focus in the past on mainly improving PCEs, the aspect of stability has not yet been addressed thoroughly, with only a few reports demonstrating the stability of PVSK cells. In previous investigations, we found that the planar ITO/PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate))-based PVSK devices are sensitive to air, especially under high humidity. The stability of these types of devices in air can be enhanced by embedding the protective metal oxide layer. The most commonly studied PVSK devices with metal oxides (TiO2 and ZnO) inserted between the PVSK layer and the indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) ETL, and spiro-OMeTAD embedded between the PVSK layer and metal electrodes (Ag or Au) as the HTL have also exhibited higher stability in air. For instance, Grätzel et al. investigated the long-term stability of encapsulated mesoscopic PVSK cells (FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) toward light exposure (full sunlight; temperature: 45 °C) and found that the PVSK device could maintain greater than 80% of its initial PCE after a period of 500 h. Seok et al. studied the stability of unencapsulated FTO/TiO2/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/polytriarylamine (PTAA)/Au devices in air at low humidity (35%) in the dark. Han et al. demonstrated that a mesoscopic-type PVSK device having the structure FTO/TiO2/ZrO2(5-AVA; 5-ammonium valeric acid)x(MA)1−xPbI3/carbon showed a certified PCE of 12.8% and was stable for more than 1000 h in ambient air under light at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Although the stability during long-term storage under N2 or in air with or without irradiation of light at temperatures below 45 °C has been investigated, the stability under high temperature accelerated conditions has not yet been determined clearly, suggesting a need for further studies on the effects of thermal stressing. The morphology of PVSK can change significantly under thermal annealing. Because the true operating temperature of PV devices is often higher than 50 °C, PVSK is likely to degrade into PbI2 or change its morphology far from its optimized state after prolonged thermal treatment at elevated temperatures. Our goal in this study was to use an additive, ethylammonium iodide (EAI), to optimize the properties and enhance the stability (especially at high temperatures) of PVSK devices. The EAI cation has been used previously for PVSK applications; because the ionic radius of the EA cation (0.23 nm) is greater than that of the MA cation (0.18 nm), the bandgap of the resulting PVSK decreases from 2.2 to 1.55 eV, respectively. A relatively poor PCE of 2.4% has been observed for a device incorporating an EAI-derived PVSK, primarily because of inefficient light harvesting. In this study, we adopted the architecture—ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al—to study the influence of this additive on the device performance. We performed experiments to determine the correlations among the processing conditions (additive concentration, temperature, and time) and the optical properties, crystallinity, and morphology of the resulting PVSK films. We used tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-vis spectroscopy, and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to examine the relationship between the film quality and the device performance. Previous reports have indicated that additives [diiodooctane (DIO) and NH4Cl] can enhance the PCEs of the resulting devices through their ability to increase the crystallinity and optimize the morphology of the PVSK film. In the present study, EAI served as an additive that improved the film quality, but also as a retarding agent to suppress and decelerate the degradation of PVSK; accordingly, we observed an increase in the PCE from 9.4 ± 0.76 to 10.2 ± 0.58% and improved stability under thermal stressing. The corresponding normal devices (prepared without EAI) were much more sensitive to high temperatures, degrading rapidly under ISOS-D-2 conditions (65 °C, dark, Ar); their T80 value (the period of time required for the PCE of the device to decay by 20% from its initial value) was typically 45 h. In contrast, our EAI-containing devices were much more stable, having T80 values of approximately 360 h.

We prepared the PVSK precursor solution and fabricated planar PVSK PV devices using methods similar to those we had reported previously. To study the effects of the additive on the morphology, absorption, and crystallization of the PVSK films, we fabricated such films under the same conditions as those described above, but with different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 vol%) of EAI in the precursor solution and variations of the annealing time. Previous reports have indicated that if the annealing temperature of a planar-type MAPbI3−xClx cell is greater than 110 °C, the surface coverage will decrease significantly and this phenomenon would not favor solar cell applications. A low temperature, between 80 and 100 °C, can be used to attain maximum coverage while enabling full crystallization of the PVSK layer. The most common annealing temperature for ITO/PEDOT:PSS–based planar MAPbI3−xClx cells has been 90 °C, with the time necessary to fully crystallize MAPbI3−xClx being between 2 and 3 h. Typically, the generation of MAPbI3−xClx can be observed clearly by the naked eye, with a color change from yellow to dark brown. Here, we used GIWAXS and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy to study the effect of the additive EAI on the crystal structure and light absorption of these films. Optimized annealing times for our normal (no EAI) and EAI-derived MAPbI3−xClx films were 2.5 and 3.5 h, respectively. For comparison, we also fabricated EAPbI3−xClx films. Notably, we could not fabricate EAPbI3−xClx films when using a high precursor concentration (25 wt%); we observed a rapid change in color due to excessive crystallization for the films annealed at 90 °C. Instead, we fabricated the EAPbIxCl3−x films using a lower precursor concentration (10 wt%) and adopted a two-step annealing process; first, we annealed the precursor films at 90 °C for 6 h, without any change in color, and then applied additional annealing at 110 °C for 2 h, during which time we observed desired transition in color. Fig. S1 displays the UV-vis spectrum, GIWAXS profile, and AFM image of the EAPbI3−xClx thin film. We plotted the azimuthally integrated scattering intensities of the various GIWAXS patterns against the scattering vector q [equal to 4πsinθ/λ, where θ is half of the total scattering angle and λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.145 nm)]. We attribute the high intensity of the scattering peak at a q value of 9 nm−1 to PbI2, suggesting the incomplete transformation of the precursor into PVSK. The EAPbI3−xClx film displayed a relatively strong absorption between 300 and 600 nm, with a weak shoulder at a longer wavelength (Fig. S1b). The root-mean-square (rms) roughness and the surface coverage of the EAPbI3−xClx film were 24.8 nm and 78%, respectively. Fig. 1a displays the UV-vis spectra of MAPbI3−xClx films prepared in the presence of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 vol% of EAI under the optimized conditions; they feature broad absorptions with an onset wavelength of 800 nm. We observed higher optical densities for the films prepared with EAI as the additive. The intensities of the signals in the UV-vis spectra of these films decreased when the concentration of the additive followed the order 1 > 0.5 > 2.5 > 5 > 0%. Using cross-sectional SEM, we determined the thicknesses of the PVSK films prepared at EAI concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 vol% to be 120, 123, 123, 122, and 127 nm, respectively (Fig. S2). Thus, the thickness of the PVSK films increased when the EAI concentration reached 5%. Fig. 1b presents the GIWAXS profiles of these thin films; their diffraction patterns are consistent with that expected for MAPbI3−xClx. We attribute the scattering peak at a q value of 10 nm−1 to the (110) plane of the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite structure. The full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of the scattering peak at a q value of 10 nm−1 for the films prepared at concentrations of EAI from 0 to 5 vol% were 0.391, 0.382, 0.385, 0.383, and 0.394 nm−1, respectively. Because the thicknesses of these films were similar, the lower values of FWHM for the PVSK films derived from 0.5–2.5% EAI suggest an overall increase in the PVSK crystallinity for the films prepared in the presence of this additive. We also observed changes in the intensities of the signals in the absorption spectra after the addition of EAI. We attribute the increases in the absorbance intensities at higher wavelengths to the higher degrees of crystallinity of the PVSK films fabricated in the presence of EAI.


Fig. 2 and S2 reveal the AFM topographies of our PVSK films. We observed dramatic changes in the morphologies and surface coverages of these films depending on the EAI concentration. The rms roughnesses of the films obtained when the concentration of EAI was 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 vol% were 9.7, 9.2, 10.6, 11.3, and 17.5 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 and S3); the coverages of these films were 91, 94, 91, 89, and 85%, respectively. (The rms and the coverage values are the average of three measurements.) In general, a rougher surface was accompanied by a lower surface coverage. The film fabricated in the presence of 0.5 vol% of EAI exhibited the lowest surface roughness, the highest surface coverage, and larger crystallites than those of the other films. The performance of a planar PVSK device can decrease as a result of pin-hole formation; such poor coverage of the perovskite will result in low-resistance shunting paths. Furthermore, regions without PVSK coverage will decrease the available photocurrent and, hence, the performance. We suspected that the improved light harvesting and surface coverage of our crystalline MAPbIxCl3−x thin films prepared in the presence of EAI would lead to higher PV performance.

Table 1 and Fig. 3 summarize the open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit current densities (Jsc), fill factors (FFs), and PCEs of devices containing PVSK films prepared in the presence of various concentrations of EAI. For comparison, we also fabricated corresponding EAPbIxCl3−x devices. Because of inefficient light harvesting, poor coverage, and incomplete transformation of the precursor into PVSK, the device incorporating EAPbIxCl3−x displayed poor performance, with a Jsc value of 6.4 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.25 V, an FF of 46.1%, and a PCE of 0.7%. The PCEs of the devices prepared with EAI at concentrations at 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5% were 9.4 ± 0.76, 10.2 ± 0.58, 9.9 ± 0.45, 8.5 ± 0.26, and 7.3 ± 1.32%, respectively (Fig. 3a). The Jsc value increased significantly when the device had been prepared using 0.5 or 1% of EAI; further increases in the concentration led, however, to decreases in the PCEs, due to the lower values of Jsc and FF. The dependence of the performance on the EAI concentration can be explained by considering the morphologies, crystallinities, and absorption properties of the MAPbI3−xClx films (Fig. 1 and 2). Higher values of Jsc were associated with higher intensity and longer wavelength absorptions. Relative to the normal (no EAI) device that prepared with 0.5% EAI exhibited a significant increase in PCE—indeed, the highest among the tested devices—to 10.9%, along with a Jsc value of 17.2 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.89 V, and an FF of 70.9% (Fig. 3a). The average PCE of the 0.5% EAI device was 10.2 ± 0.58%, along with a Jsc value of 16.8 ± 0.52 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.86 ± 0.03 V, and an FF of 70.4 ± 1.49%. To confirm the accuracy of our PCE measurements, we also measured the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of our devices. The EQE responses of these devices reveal (Fig. 3b) a significant contribution at wavelengths between 350 and 800 nm, consistent with the absorption spectra of PVSK films, with the maximum EQE appearing near 520 nm. Convolution of the spectral responses with the photon flux AM 1.5 G spectrum allowed us to estimate Jsc values of 13.8, 14.8, 14.8, 12.8, and 12.8 mA cm−2, respectively, for the devices prepared at concentrations of EAI from 0 to 5 vol% under irradiation. Because of a mismatch between the EQE spectra and the photon flux AM 1.5 G spectrum, there was a mismatch of approximately 10% between the convolution and solar simulator data. This mismatch was probably due to inaccurate calibration of the instrument and the decay of the devices when we performed the EQE measurements outside the glove box. These devices were sensitive to the ambient conditions. The presence of 0.5 or 1% of EAI caused the MAPbI3−xClx film to grow uniformly with high coverage and a continuous phase, and, accordingly, with higher absorption and crystallinity; hence, it allowed the corresponding devices to display improved performance.

In previous studies, we found that devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx exhibited excellent stabilities in the dark at room temperature under N2. We could not draw any assertive conclusions about their relative stabilities because these devices degraded only minimally during long-term (>1000 h) storage at room temperature under N2. To determine whether our EAI-containing devices outperformed the normal device, we recorded their stabilities using the accepted consensus protocol (ISOS-D-2). Known mechanisms for the deterioration of OPV devices include H2O- and O2-mediated degradation of the active and interfacial layers, electrode diffusion, and morphological changes. Among all present commercial PV technologies, the low robustness of PVSK under ambient conditions (air with high humidity) is most closely related to that of copper–indium–gallium diselenide (CIGS) cells. Similar to CIGS, this problem can be controlled to acceptable levels by employing suitable encapsulation. Because MAPbI3−xClx is metastable, the morphology and the optoelectronic properties of PVSK are sensitive to rising temperatures. We examined the stability of our devices at an accelerated test (65 °C) in the dark under Ar so that we could ignore the effects of O2 and H2O on the degradation process. Fig. 4 summarizes the PCEs of the devices prepared using various concentrations of EAI after various lengths of time. The initial PCEs of the devices prepared using 0, 0.5, and 1% of EAI were 9.9, 9.5, and 9.4%, respectively (Table S1). We observed improvements in the PCEs of these devices initially after thermal stressing. The PCE of the device prepared using 0.5% EAI increased from 9.5 to 10.1% after storage at 65 °C for 0.5 h; this enhancement was accompanied by an increased FF, while the Jsc and Voc values had increased only slightly. We observed a similar phenomenon for the device prepared using 1% EAI: an increase in FF and, hence, an increase in the PCE from 9.4 to 10.2% after 1 h of storage. The normal device underwent only a slight increase in the PCE, from 9.9 to 10.1%, after storage for 0.5 h. From a previous study, we reported the increases in PCEs of PVSK devices after long-term storage at room temperature under an inert gas. Boschloo et al. used X-ray diffraction (XRD) to demonstrate the conversion of PVSK from disordered to more crystalline after storage at room temperature under Ar for several weeks. They suggested that the rate of conversion to more-crystalline PVSK could be accelerated by increasing the temperature of the device. We attribute the enhancements in PCEs for our cells during the initial stages of the accelerated tests to transformations of their local disordered PVSK into films of higher crystallinity in the dark and under Ar. Further increases in the accelerated time led to worsening of the PCE of the normal (no EAI) device; it decreased from 9.9 to 7.7% after 45 h of storage, suggesting some thermal stability for MAPbI3−xClx devices, but degraded further to 60% of its initial value (T60) after an extended thermal treatment for 200 h. The devices prepared using EAI were much more stable, retaining over 96% of their initial PCEs after annealing at 65 °C for 45 h (Fig. 4). The devices prepared using 0.5 and 1% EAI exhibited T80 values of approximately 290 and 360 h, respectively; the period of time required for the PCEs of these devices to decay to 60% (T60) of their initial values was approximately 580 h.
We used AFM, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and GIWAXS to study how the morphologies of the blend films evolved during the accelerated process. For direct comparison, we also prepared MAPbI3−xClx films for these studies under the same device fabrication conditions, and stored them under the same conditions (65 °C, dark, Ar). We compared the AFM images, UV-vis spectra, and GIWAXS data of the MAPbI3−xClx films prepared using various concentrations of EAI after they had been annealed for their various values of T80 and T60. Fig. 5 displays the AFM images of MAPbI3−xClx films prepared using 0–1% EAI after various thermal annealing periods at 65 °C. The morphology of the normal device changed dramatically after annealing (Fig. 5a and d). We observed an increase in surface roughness from 9.7 to 10.9 nm after annealing the normal film for 45 h; it remained similar (rms roughness: 10.9 nm) after annealing for 200 h. The surface coverages of the normal films annealed for 45 and 200 h were 87 and 86%, respectively. For the films prepared using 0.5 and 1% EAI, we observed increases in their surface roughness after annealing. The rms roughnesses of the film prepared using 0.5% EAI after T80 and T60 were 9.7 and 10.1 nm, respectively, with surface coverages of 92 and 88%, respectively. The rms roughnesses of the film prepared using 1% EAI after annealing at its T80 and T60 values were 11.2 and 11.4 nm, respectively, accompanied by surface coverages of 88 and 87%, respectively. These results suggest that the rougher surface and the lower surface coverage were somewhat responsible for the degradation of the devices.
In addition to the coverage, the crystallinity of the PVSK domains can also affect the PCEs of the corresponding devices because defects in the crystals will create severe trapping or shorting sites for charge recombination; furthermore, they will affect the exciton diffusion and transportation length and the charge dissociation process. Very recently, Snaith et al. reported the stability of PVSK cells having the structure ITO/TiO2/Al2O3-coated PVSK/MAPbI3−xClx/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/Ag that had been subjected to thermal stress at 80 °C (ambient air). They observed a great enhancement in stability after 96 h for the devices as a result of the protecting effects of PMMA and the hybrid HTL (SWNTs:P3HT). In contrast, PVSK films coated with spiro-OMeTAD underwent significant degradation, with the films becoming predominantly yellow. Their XRD spectra indicated that the degradation and color change were due to the transition from PVSK to PbI2. A close look at Fig. S4 reveals an overall decrease in the intensity for our PVSK films after prolonged thermal stressing at 65 °C, notably for the (110) peak. We did not observe the formation of PbI2 from the films, suggesting a certain degree of thermal stability of our MAPbI3−xClx films under Ar and that the PVSK structure was not destroyed under these conditions of thermal stressing. We observed a decrease in the long-wavelength absorption for the normal film and overall decreases in intensity for the films prepared using 0.5 and 1% EAI (Fig. S5). The deteriorated surface coverage and lower crystallinity of these PVSK thin films were responsible for their decreased absorption. The lower coverages and higher roughnesses of the thermal annealing-accelerated films suggested that one of the key factors for the degradation in the performance of PVSK devices was the morphological change, in addition to the deteriorated absorption and crystallinity of the PVSK films. Our study reveals that judicious selection of additive materials when preparing PVSK devices can critically influence their resulting PCEs and thermal stabilities. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the device stability and the properties of PVSK under thermal stressing has not been described in detail previously; herein, we reveal that the morphology and optoelectronic properties depend markedly on the application of thermal stress for various lengths of time. There remains considerable room for improvement in stability; we anticipate that a robust form of PVSK cell could be prepared after replacing the PEDOT:PSS layer with a p-type metal oxide material (e.g., NiOx) or by using a structure with PMMA/P3HT/SWNTs as the HTL, or even by using an HTL-free device architecture. Further development of these devices—through the replacement of the PEDOT:PSS layer and enhancing the device stability—is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

We have demonstrated the capability to use EAI as an additive to improve the PCEs of devices having the structure glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al. Compared with the corresponding normal device, we observed an improvement in the PCE from 9.4 ± 0.76 to 10.2 ± 0.58% for the device prepared using 0.5 vol% of EAI as an additive. We examined the thermal stabilities of these PVSK solar cells through accelerated testing at 65 °C in the dark under Ar. We found that devices prepared using EAI as an additive exhibited much higher stabilities, with T80 and T60 values of 360 and 580 h, respectively. In contrast, the values of T80 and T60 of the normal device were 45 and 200 h, respectively. Using UV-vis spectroscopy, GIWAXS, and AFM, we concluded that morphological changes, as well as deteriorated absorption and crystallinity, of the PVSK films played important roles affecting the degradation in the performance of the PVSK devices under thermal stressing. The devices prepared using EAI exhibited competitive PCEs while, crucially, displaying higher stabilities against thermal stressing.


All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received, unless otherwise specified. MAI and EAI were synthesized according to previously reported techniques. Ethylamine (2.0 M in MeOH, Aldrich; 5.46 mL) and hydroiodic acid (57% w/w aq. soln, stab with 1.5% hypophosphorous acid, Alfa Aesar; 3.00 mL) were stirred at 0 °C under N2 for 2 h. The solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator under vacuum. The crude residue was dissolved in MeOH (5 mL) and poured into Et2O (200 mL). The precipitate was collected and dried under vacuum to afford EAI as a white product.


PVSK cells were prepared using the following device fabrication procedure. Glass/ITO substrates [Sanyo, Japan (8 Ω □−1)] were sequentially patterned lithographically, cleaned with a detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried on a hot plate at 140 °C for 10 min, and treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P-VP AI4083) was passed through a 0.45 μm filter and deposited onto ITO (thickness: ca. 40 nm) through spin-coating (3000 rpm) in air; the sample was then dried at 140 °C for 20 min inside a glove box. The PVSK precursor solution was prepared by dissolving MAI and lead(II) chloride (molar ratio, 3:1) at 25 wt% (with various vol% of EAI) in DMF and then stirring continuously overnight at 60 °C in the dark. PVSK devices, having the layered configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM/Al, were fabricated using methods similar to those reported previously. Prior to deposition of the PVSK layer, the PEDOT:PSS film was preheated at 60 °C for 5 min. The precursor solution was also preheated at 60 °C for 5 min and then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. PCBM was spin-coated (2000 rpm) from a chlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL−1). The layers of Al (100 nm) were deposited thermally under vacuum. The active area of the device was 10 mm2. The cell performance was measured inside a glove box. The current–voltage (I–V) properties of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel® Sol2A Class ABA Solar Simulators) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell and a KG-5 filter. EQEs were measured using an Enlitech QE-R spectral response measurement system to calibrate the current densities of the devices. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-3300 spectrophotometer. The morphologies of the perovskite surface were analyzed through AFM using a VEECO DICP-II instrument operated in the tapping mode at ambient temperature; the etched Si probe exhibited a resonant frequency of 131 kHz and a spring constant of 11 N m−1. ImageJ was used to calculate the surface coverages of the films. GIWAXS patterns were collected using a Philips Panalytical-x'PertPROMRD instrument; the incident beam angle was above the critical angle (ca. 0.5°). Cross-sectional SEM images were measured using a JEOL JSM 6701F field-emission scanning electron microscope.
