Two arylamine-based hole transporting materials with an anthracene π-linker have been synthesized and tested for perovskite solar cells. Improved power conversion efficiency and stability were achieved by employing A102 compared with that of spiro-OMeTAD.

Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted immense attention due to their high performance in converting sunlight into electricity at low cost. In PSCs, hole transporting materials (HTMs) are important to achieve high performance. At present, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been widely used as an HTM in PSCs. However, the development of a low-cost and efficient HTM to replace expensive spiro-OMeTAD is highly in demand for commercial applications of PSCs. To date, due to the superior hole transporting ability of arylamine moieties, it has been widely used in hole transporting materials (including conventional spiro-OMeTAD). Researchers have developed many arylamine-π-arylamine types of HTMs by changing the π-linker because their molecular structures are relatively simple. The reported π-linkers include 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, silolothiophene, furan, silafluorene, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, alkyne, azomethine, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene, triazole, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene], fluorene-dithiophene,etc. However, among these materials, some of them also have drawbacks such as relatively high price, low PCE and bad stability. Therefore, seeking new efficient and low-cost π-linkers for high-performance arylamine-based HTMs is still necessary.

Previously, highly planar anthracene units were reported in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, etc., due to their superior carrier mobility, high stability, and easy modification. To elucidate the advantage of anthracene units, we introduced anthracene as a π-linker to develop new efficient and low-cost arylamine-based HTMs. As shown in Fig. 1, two new molecules (A101 and A102) with anthracene linkers and arylamine terminal groups were designed and developed. They were synthesized through simple Buchwald–Hartwig and Suzuki cross coupling reactions with high yields. The synthetic procedure is provided in the ESI.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra in dichloromethane (DCM) of new compounds and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 2a. A101 and A102 show absorption bands in the visible region compared to spiro-OMeTAD in the UV region. The absorption maximum peaks of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD is centered at 491, 401 and 385 nm, respectively. A101 shows a bathochromic spectrum shift compared to that of A102, which could result from the stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction in A101 than that in A102 (TDDFT calculations, Fig S3 (ESI)). Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the corresponding UV-Vis absorption in film and solution. It should be noted that the onset points of all compounds are red-shifted. Interestingly, the red-shifts of A101 (9 nm) and A102 (7 nm) are higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (3 nm), suggesting that the anthracene core has the potential to be more favorable for intermolecular packing due to its high planarity. On the other hand, a larger bathochromic shift of A101 compared to that of A102, from solution to film, implies the stronger intermolecular interaction of A101.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S2, ESI) of A101 and A102 show maximum emissions at 602 and 549 nm in DCM, respectively, with a large Stokes shift exceeding 100 nm, which is significantly larger than that of spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the optical band gaps (Eg) of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD calculated from the absorption onset wavelengths of the corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2a) are 2.25, 2.75 and 2.98 eV, respectively.
The electrochemical properties of the new molecules and spiro-OMeTAD are studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in a DCM solution, and the cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 2b. The pair of redox peaks of new molecules are highly reversible, indicating that they have excellent electrochemical stability. The calculated HOMO levels of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD are −5.26, −5.31 and −5.13 eV, respectively. The reported valence band of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is −5.65 eV, suggesting that the new molecules reported here would be favorable for hole transfer (Fig. 2c). As shown in Fig. 2, the extension of π-conjugation decreases the HOMO level, which indicates that the benzene ring spacer in A102 weakens the electron-donating effect. Moreover, the LUMO levels of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD calculated from CV and absorption data are −3.01, −2.56 and −2.15 eV, respectively. Their significantly higher LUMO levels compared to the conduction band of perovskite can block the electron transfer from perovskite to an Au counter electrode.
The electron density distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of A101 and A102 is studied using TDDFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G** level. The molecular-orbital energy diagrams are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). It is noted that the HOMO orbitals of A102 are distributed on the two periphery arms. Therefore, the structure of A102 is extended, and the steric hindrance is smaller than that of A101. It is noted that electron density is localized in arylamine in the HOMO, whereas electron density is localized in anthracene in the LUMO, which indicates the ICT interaction between arylamine and anthracene. Thus, the more red-shifted absorption maximum and the lower bandgap of A101 indicate the stronger ICT interaction between the diphenylamine and anthracene moieties. The benzene ring spacer in A102 weakens the efficient ICT interaction between diphenylamine and anthracene, resulting in a blue-shifted absorption maximum. The TDDFT results are consistent with UV-Vis absorption.
To estimate the charge carrier mobility of new molecules and spiro-OMeTAD, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au devices are fabricated and the space charge limited current method was used to record the J–V characteristics, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The hole mobilities of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD evaluated by Mott–Gurney are 7.85 × 10−5, 9.02 × 10−5 and 2.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobility value of A102 compared to that of A101 could be the result of the reduction of steric hindrance between the benzene ring and anthracene due to the extension of π-conjugation by inserting a phenyl ring between anthracene and diphenylamine. Moreover, the developed compounds show a comparable hole mobility with spiro-OMeTAD, which may be beneficial to improve the performance of PSCs.
During the preparation of A101 and A102, we found that A101 shows a pretty bad solubility in CH2Cl2, chlorobenzene and toluene. Subsequently, we measured their solubility values in toluene, and we found that 8–12 mg of A101, 72–77 mg of A102 and 101–110 mg of spiro-OMeTAD can be dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous toluene at room temperature. Then the film-forming ability of the developed compound was analyzed by AFM. Fig. S6 (ESI) shows the AFM topographical images of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of films A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD are around 2.49, 0.88 and 1.02 nm, respectively. Therefore, the results illustrate that the insertion of a phenyl group between anthracene and nitrogen suppresses the severe intermolecular aggregation of A101.
The hole extraction and transporting ability of developed molecules and spiro-OMeTAD were evaluated by steady-state PL spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI), the quenching values of perovskite with A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD are 77%, 88% and 91%, respectively, compared to the pristine perovskite film. It is noted that the quenching value is not consistent with the HOMO values. The bad film-forming property of A101 may lead to an inferior charge-extraction capability compared to that of A102 and spiro-OMeTAD.
To investigate and compare the photovoltaic performance of A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs, the mesoscopic PSCs were fabricated by a similar one-step method with solvent-engineering technology. A detailed procedure is shown in the ESI. Each group of devices with different HTMs contains 10 samples, and their detailed device parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI).
The photovoltaic performance of the PSC devices employing new molecules and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs are measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 1. The best device with A101 yields a PCE of 13.41%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 19.37 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.67. When the HTM layer is replaced by A102, the PSCs show a higher PCE of 17.56%, and yield a Jsc of 21.37 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.07 V and an FF of 0.78. Under the same conditions, the best-performing PSC with spiro-OMeTAD show a PCE of 17.27%, which is even lower than that of A102. In order to perform a comprehensive investigation, Table 1 lists the mean values with the standard deviation (STDEV) of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of each group. All data exhibit a relatively low STDEV, which shows high reproducibility and reliability of the experiments. The A102-based devices show higher Voc, Jsc, and FF than that of A101. This can be attributed to the lower HOMO level and better hole mobility of A102 due to the insertion of an extra phenyl unit between anthracene and nitrogen than those of A101. Moreover, the inferior charge-extraction capability of A101 also leads to bad performance in PSCs, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). A low concentration of 12 mg mL−1 of A101 was used to spin the HTM layer due to the bad solubility and bad film-forming ability, which also lead to a higher STDEV of all photovoltaic parameter values of the PSC devices. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices based on A102 or spiro-OMeTAD are recorded to confirm the photocurrent density, as presented in Fig. 3b. It is noted that the devices employing A102 or spiro-OMeTAD show similar trends, which suggest that the absorption of A102 has a negligible effect on the PSC device performance. Moreover, the obtained integrated Jsc from the IPCE spectra is consistent with the Jsc from J–V curves.

As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S3 (ESI), the hysteresis behavior of the PSC devices with different HTMs are measured through forward and reverse scans. All hysteresis were mainly reflected in the different values of Voc and FF. The PCEs of the devices with A101, A102 and spiro-OMeTAD are 11.04%, 15.64% and 15.31% for the forward scan, respectively. And the performance of the A102-based device is also better than that of spiro-OMeTAD.
Long-term stability is very important for PSCs, and we performed an aging test of the devices with A101 and A102 and compared it with that of spiro-OMeTAD. The devices are stored without encapsulation under the same conditions (around 30% relative humidity). As shown in Fig. S10 and Table S4 (ESI), after around 25 days of aging, the A101-, A102- and spiro-OMeTAD-based cells show a reduction of 28%, 7% and 15% in PCE. The better performance of the A102-based cell than that of A101 could result from the controlled intermolecular interaction, and then the vertical charge transport was improved and the film surface made uniform compared to that of A101. Promisingly, A102-based devices show a relatively high stability than spiro-OMeTAD. On the other hand, the cost of the HTM is also important for large-scale production of PSCs. As shown in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI), the cost of materials for the synthesis of A102 is around 34.6 $ per gram, which is considerably lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, all the results reveal that A102 is a new promising HTM for PSCs.
In summary, we have developed two simple hole transporting materials that incorporated anthracene as a π-linker by a facile synthesis process. Between the developed molecules, A102 shows a higher hole mobility, lower HOMO level, and good solubility in toluene. When used in PSCs it even showed a better performance than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The design and development of new anthracene-based HTMs for more efficient and stable PSCs will be promising in future by further molecular engineering, and related work to this goal is in progress.
