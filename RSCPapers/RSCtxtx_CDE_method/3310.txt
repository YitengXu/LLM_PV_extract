A diketopyrrolopyrrole-based small bandgap polymer (DPPT-TT) with high mobility is introduced as an additive to D–A1–D–A2 type thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based random copolymer (P3):(6,6)-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) polymer solar cells (PSCs). The average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were improved from 6.15% to 8.30% with the addition of 0.5% DPPT-TT. The photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves, short-circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) as functions of incident light intensity, photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved transient PL (TRTPL) spectra were investigated, and the results certified the effect of DPPT-TT as the third component material in terms of efficient exciton dissociation and weakened charge carrier recombination. The relationship between VOC and the weight ratio of DPPT-TT was explained with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the electron density of states of unit mass (Ne), indicating the formation of a polymer alloy in ternary blend. With proper addition of DPPT-TT, the mobility of electrons and holes becomes more balanced and the efficiency of exciton utilization is improved due to the existence of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which also contributes to the enhanced JSC and PCEs. Our work demonstrates that appropriate donor polymers forming a polymer alloy in blend is a rational strategy to improve photovoltaic performance.

In the past decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been widely studied for their advantages of low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and roll-to-roll production. Recently, excellent materials and novel manufacturing technologies have been developed, and the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 14% has been achieved. It is widely believed that low fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (JSC) are confirmed as major factors hindering the device performance of PSCs which strongly depend on exciton generation, exciton dissociation and charge transport processes in blend films. It is assumed that the exciton diffusion length is 10–20 nm in conjugated polymers. The appropriate blending compatibility could afford an unexceptionable interpenetrating network and a fine nanoscale phase-separated morphology, which is beneficial for the dissociation of excitons into free charges at the donor–acceptor interface, and thus reduce carrier recombination and increase JSC. Various methods have been employed to form a bi-continuous interpenetrating network morphology in the blend film, such as thermal annealing, solvent annealing, post-additive soaking, or using additives. The use of additives, in particular, is the simplest and more effective approach to optimize the morphology of the active layer in the device. The introduction of high-mobility materials as additives in the active layer is a reasonable approach to obtain better device performance, which is beneficial for carrier extraction. The efficiency of hole extraction should increase with hole mobility because the geminate recombination (GR) pair is conclusively limited by the nonradiative decay of the charge transfer states at the donor–acceptor interface. Kim et al. found that the device performance can be enhanced by adding carbon nanotubes into the active layer. Yu et al. confirmed that N-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes served as both extra exciton dissociation centers and efficient charge transport channels in organic solar cells. Yan et al. reported that by adding a high-mobility conjugated polymer to build a ternary system, the PCE can be increased from 8.75% to 10.08%, which is mainly attributed to the suppressed carrier recombination for the cascade band structure and improved hole mobilities in the devices. It has been found that high-mobility materials have a critical effect on the improvement of the performance of PSCs, and a ternary strategy as an efficient method to improve the device performance has been extensively studied. The preliminary principle of the third component selection not only served as a complementary absorption spectrum to a host donor:acceptor (D:A) blend system but also promoted favourable charge generation, charge transport and/or charge extraction properties in ternary active layers.

Diketopyrrolopyrrole (such as DPPT-TT) polymers have attracted great interest in the field of organic electronics because of their advantages of wide absorption range, good stability and high mobility (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1). In this work, we introduced high-mobility DPPT-TT as an additive to the active layers of binary PSCs based on a D–A1–D–A2 type thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based random copolymer P3:(6,6)-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). As reported, P3 exhibited good planarity and similar highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels to DPPT-TT, and only ∼0.08 eV related to the HOMO energy difference was observed, near to the product of the Boltzmann constant kB and room temperature T (kBT ∼ 0.026 eV) and lower than the normal conjugated polymer density-of-states (DOS) distribution of a HOMO level of 0.1 eV, ensuring that holes can transport in a mixture of two polymer networks and realizing a noticeable enhancement of hole mobility in ternary PSCs. A noteworthy improvement of the PCE from 6.18% to 8.29% was acquired after the addition of only a small amount of DPPT-TT (0.5%). The results indicated that a moderating ratio of DPPT-TT incorporated into the ternary system could produce synergistic effects in regulating morphology, charge carrier split/transport/collection, tuning energy levels, and thus enhance device performance.

DPPT-TT and PC71BM (99.5%) was purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co Ltd and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. P3 is synthesized according to Yang's method.


Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were washed by a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, with de-ionized water, acetone, de-ionized water and isopropanol in turn. After drying under nitrogen flow, the substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 6 min, then a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, ca. 40 nm, Clevios PVP Al4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates and annealed at 160 °C for 20 min. After that the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box and the active layer was prepared. P3 with various contents of DPPT-TT/PC71BM active-layer solutions (total concentration 20 mg mL−1, 1:1.5) were prepared from a mixed solution of chlorobenzene (CB) with 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and the weight percentages of introduced DPPT-TT proportionated to a donor component were found to be 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10%, respectively. Next, an ultrathin layer of PFN (0.2 mg mL−1 in methanol) was spin-coated on the active layer. Finally, the aluminium layer (∼100 nm) as the cathode was thermally evaporated under a vacuum pressure of 10−4 Pa. The conventional PSCs’ structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3:DPPT-TT:PC71BM/PFN/Al. Under each condition, at least five separated devices were fabricated to calculate the average PCEs. Moreover, the all effective device area in this work was 0.1 cm2, which was ascertained by a shadow mask.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination (XEC-300 M2, San-EI Electric Co.) using a Keithley 2400 source meter instrument unit. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured using an incident photon-to-charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) setup (7-SCSpecIII, Beijing 7-star Optical Instruments Co.) equipped with a standard Si diode. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRTPL) spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films were obtained using a Nano LOG-TCSPC from HORIBA JOBIN YVON. Surface energy was measured using a DSA100 optical contact angle/surface tension meter (Kruss, Germany). The surface morphology of active layers was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, NanoMan VS, Veeco, USA). The thicknesses of active layers were measured using a surface profilometer (VDS-9400QS by BRUKER USA).

The chemical structures and the related energy levels of P3, DPPT-TT and PC71BM are depicted in Fig. 1. The energy levels of P3 and DPPT-TT were measured in parallel by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S4, ESI). As shown in Fig. 1b, the HOMO levels of P3 and DPPT-TT are −5.25 and −5.17 eV, respectively. Fig. 2a and b show the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) maximum absorption peaks of P3 and DPPT-TT appeared at around 725 and 825 nm, respectively. Evidently, the absorption peak of DPPT-TT widened to the near infrared region, which was propitious to harvest more sunlight and thus yield the higher JSC in PSCs.

The J–V characteristics of PSCs with different weight ratios of DPPT-TT are shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1. The control device (0% DPPT-TT) showed an average PCE of 6.15%, with VOC, JSC, and FF of 0.743 V, 13.27 mA cm−2, and 62.39%, respectively. However, the device with 0.5% DPPT-TT showed a remarkable enhancement in JSC, and a significant improvement of PCE (8.30%) was achieved. Clearly, compared to the control device, a pronounced improvement of PCE raised by 34.8% was observed. With further increase in the amount of DPPT-TT from 1% to 10%, correspondingly, the PCEs were gradually reduced from 6.93% to 5.02%. And the control device based on DPPT-TT:PC71BM showed the PCE to be only 3.6% due to the obvious decrease in JSC and VOC of the devices. Additionally, after doping DPPT-TT, the FF is higher than that of the control device, which indicates that an ideal charge transport channel or phase separation should be formed in the ternary active layer.

In order to further illustrate the effect of DPPT-TT on device performance, the EQE was measured, as shown in Fig. 2d. All devices exhibited good photoresponses ranging from 300 to 750 nm, which were in accordance with UV-visible absorption spectra. As expected, the control device without DPPT-TT had lower EQE than that with 0.5% or 1% DPP across the entire visible spectrum. PSCs with 0.5% DPPT-TT show the highest average EQE of 74.68% around 350–700 nm, resulting in the best JSC value of 16.41 mA cm−2. In the wavelength range greater than 750 nm, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2d, there was a weak photo-response and the increase in the EQE value can be ascribed to the light absorption of DPP-DTT. However, it was clear that the contribution of DPPT-TT absorption to the increase in the photocurrent of PSCs was limited, which should not be the main reason for the improvement of device performance.

The intermolecular charge transfer or energy transfer processes between DPPT-TT and P3 may effectively increase the utilization efficiency of excitons on P3 and thereby improve the device performance. There are three latent utilization routes of excitons on P3 to improve the JSC values: (i) directly dissociate into free charge carriers at the P3/PC71BM interface; (ii) directly dissociate into free charge carriers at the P3/DPPT-TT interface; (iii) energy transfer from P3 to DPPT-TT and then dissociate into free charge carriers at the DPPT-TT/PC71BM interface. In order to further certify the mechanism of DPPT-TT as an additive to improve the performance of PSCs, photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved transient PL (TRTPL) spectroscopy were used to study the effect of DPPT-TT on the dynamic process of the blend film. The PL spectra of the P3 films with different DPPT-TT doping ratios were measured under 510 nm excitation and are shown in Fig. 3a. The pure P3 film exhibits strong PL around 770 nm, and the PL emission of the blend films was markedly quenched by doping a small amount of DPPT-TT, indicating that there existed some PL quenching channels, such as electron transfer and/or hole transfer between P3 and DPPT-TT in the blend films, and photo-generated excitons were dissociated before luminescence occurred. It is still confusing to confirm whether exciton dissociation or energy transfer results in P3 emission quenching in the blend films. The PL spectra of neat or blend solutions were further measured to identify the dynamic process between P3 and DPPT-TT, as shown in Fig. 3b. The neat P3 solution shows strong PL emission from 650 nm to 850 nm with an emission peak at about 730 nm, and the PL emission of P3 solution was also markedly quenched by doping a small amount of DPPT-TT. The PL emission peaks of P3 and DPPT-TT solutions showed an apparent blue-shift compared with that of the corresponding films, resulting from the enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking in solid state films. Then, we employ TRTPL spectra to probe the exciton dissociation kinetics of neat P3 and blend films by monitoring 770 nm emission under 510 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. 3c, and the corresponding fitted lifetimes are listed in Table S1 (ESI). The lifetime of neat P3 films was 1.04 ns and decreased to 0.90 ns for P3:DPPT-TT blend films (0.5%), and was gradually declined to 0.47 ns for blend films with 10% DPPT-TT. The measured TRTPL spectra indicated that the incorporation of DPPT-TT could accelerate exciton transfer and sequentially shorten the fluorescence lifetime, which should be attributed to energy transfer from P3 to DPPT-TT. According to FRET theory, the absorption spectrum of DPPT-TT was obviously overlapped with the PL spectrum of P3, and there might be energy transfer from P3 to DPPT-TT, as shown in Fig. 3d. To further verify charge transfer from P3 to DPPT-TT, a series of devices were assembled with neat P3 or DPPT-TT or their blend as the active layers. The J–V curves of the devices were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. S2, ESI). The JSC values of the devices with P3:DPPT-TT as active layers were between that of cells with P3 and DPPT-TT active layers, indicating that exciton dissociation at the P3/DPPT-TT interface can be negligible. For global analysis, some excitons in P3 were dissociated but not diffused at the P3/PC71BM interface and can transfer its energy to DPPT-TT through FRET. And then excitons in DPPT-TT generated by FRET can be dissociated into free charge carriers at DPPT-TT/PC71BM interfaces, which may improve the exciton utilization efficiency generated in P3 and enhance the EQE values in the short wavelength range, which was one reason for the substantial enhancement in JSC. Another possible reason was the addition of DPPT-TT which eliminated the energy loss in the P3:PC71BM binary blend such as non-radiation decay and trap energy levels. These implied that there might be two paths for the exciton dissociation in the ternary blend at the interface between P3/PC71BM and DPPT-TT/PC71BM and provide an additional exciton dissociation route in the ternary PSCs.


A linear relationship of the VOC emerges in some ternary systems with similar structures and could blend completely and form the alloy. There was also a ternary system with a quasi-linear correlation of VOC whose chemical structure of the two acceptors were drastically different. As shown in Table 1, the VOC of ternary devices exhibited a monotonic decreasing correlation trend with the increase of the DPPT-TT mass fraction in the donor blend. To probe the mechanism of forming an alloy and changed VOC due to the addition of a third component DPPT-TT, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to calculate the total electron density of states of unit mass (Ne).

Based on Gaussian distribution theory, Geff can be calculated using eqn (1).
(1)
where
Geff is the effective Gaussian density of states (DOS), Ne is the total electron DOSs of the repeating unit mass of the polymer, EHOMO is the donor energy level, and the parameter σ defines the broadening of the DOS.


V
OC of ternary PSCs, VOC,ternary, can be calculated using eqn (2), which is derived in detail in the ESI.
(2)
where
VOC,ternary1 and VOC,ternary2 are the VOC values of binary PSCs, donor1:acceptor and donor2:acceptor, respectively. Ne1 and Ne2 are the frontier orbital densities of donor 1 and donor 2 in the donor, and f1 and f2 are the weight composition ratios of donor 1 and donor 2 in the blend.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that P3 and DPPT-TT possessed no quasi-degenerate HOMOs (<0.1 eV) due to their fused structures and electron delocalization among the whole backbone. The molecular orbitals (MOs) and density-of-states (DOS) of P3 and DPPT-TT were calculated using the Gaussian program using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set and are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). Here, Ne1 of P3 was 1 × 6.02 × 1023/1896 g−1 = 3.17 × 1020 g−1 and Ne2 of DPPT-TT was 1 × 6.02 × 1023/930 g−1 = 6.47 × 1020 g−1. We simulated the curve of VOCvs. DPPT-TT doping ratios with different Ne1/Ne2 values, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). When 2Ne1 was approximately equal to Ne2, the experimental data of this ternary system can fit a simulation curve well, as shown in Fig. 4a. The results implied that the total DOS of Ne was a momentous parameter that could influence VOC of ternary solar cells and the addition of second donors with lower Ne2 values can increase VOC more effectively. According to the results from CV measurement (Fig. S5, ESI), the HOMO of the donor blend varied along with the change of the mass ratio of DPPT-TT in the donor blend, demonstrating that the donor alloys were formed.

Surface energy plays a decisive role in the segregation of components and thus the film morphology. According to the surface energy of all components, the position of one component in the ternary blend film can be predicted. To investigate the distribution of DPPT-TT in the ternary blend films, the surface energies of pure P3, DPPT-TT and PC71BM films were measured by contact angle measurements as shown in Fig. 5, which were 36.36, 27.93 and 50.12 mN m−1, respectively (Table 2). According to the interfacial surface energy, the wetting coefficient of DPPT-TT (ωDPP-TT) in blends of P3 and PC71BM can be calculated, and the position of DPPT-TT in the ternary blend film could be predicted according to ωDPP-TT. The ωDPP-TT value in P3:PC71BM blend films was calculated to be 2.11, indicating that DPPT-TT molecules may tend to locate at the P3 domain (the detailed discussion was provided in the ESI). The phenomenon conforms well to our proposed donor alloy model in this ternary system.

In order to study the effect of DPPT-TT on the morphology of the P3:PC71BM blend film, the surface morphology of the P3:PC71BM active layer doped with different DPPT-TT contents has been measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 6. It was evident that the statistical average data for all the blend films showed low surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness. Accompanied by the increase of DPPT-TT content in the donor blend, the RMS roughness values with slight change were 1.887 nm (0%), 2.042 nm (0.5%), 2.063 nm (1%), 2.204 nm (2.5%), 2.148 nm (5%), 1.885 nm (10%), respectively. These relatively smooth surface morphologies and no large domains in these blends can be found, indicating the admirable miscibility of DPPT-TT with the P3:PC71BM system.


In order to contribute to the free charge population, the bound electron–hole pairs should dissociate into free charge carriers and subsequently move to the electrodes before recombination. To understand the efficiency of light absorption, exciton dissociation and extraction processes in the active layer, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves for PSCs with different DPPT-TT doping ratios were investigated. When Veff is large enough, all photonic excitons can be dissociated into free charge and the current density reaches saturation. At this time, the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) is mainly related to the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of PSCs. Hence, Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the basic electrical quantity and L is the thickness of the active layer (∼100 nm). The calculated values of Gmax for PSCs with different DPPT-TT doping ratios are summarized in Table S3 (ESI), a remarkable enhancement in Gmax occurred after incorporating DPPT-TT into the device, from the control device 7.79 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 12.4 mA cm−2) to the best performance content 1.13 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 18.1 mA cm−2) with 0.5% DPPT-TT. Since the value of Gmax showed the maximum number of photons absorbed, such a significant increase implied enhanced light absorption in the blend film with 0.5% DPPT-TT, as shown in Fig. 7b. For the PSCs, the photo-generated excitons are only partially dissociated into free carriers, so the charge dissociation probabilities (P(E,T)) could be estimated by Jph = qGmaxp(E,T)L, which is actually the result of intense competition between recombination and carrier extraction. The results revealed that about 89.3% of all photo-generated carriers were dissociated for the control devices and 92.0% for the devices doped with 0.5% DPPT-TT under short-circuit conditions, indicating that the trace of DPPT-TT into blend films caused highly efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection properties. However, the P(E,T) value decreased with the increase of the DPPT-TT mixing weight ratio, which may be due to the carrier recombination acceleration at the DPPT-TT/PC71BM interface. These can also be reflected in the low EQE of high DPPT-TT doped PSCs, as shown in Fig. 2d.

To gain deeper insight into the charge–carrier recombination in the active layers with different DPPT-TT doping ratios, the J–V curves of binary and the optimized ternary PSCs were measured under various light intensities (I). According to the J–V curves of the PSCs, the JSC or VOC value as a function of light intensities (I) are shown in Fig. 7c and d, respectively. The results showed that JSC follows the power law of JSC ∝ Is if the exponential factor (s) is close to 1, indicating the effective sweep-out of carriers prior to recombination. That is to say, there is weak charge–carrier recombination in the active layers. The fitted s values are approximately 0.9794, 0.9925, 0.9899, 0.9816, 0.9896 and 0.9894 for PSCs with different DPPT-TT contents from 0 to 10%, respectively. The s value of 0.992 is very close to 1, indicating the less bimolecular recombination in the 0.5% DPPT-TT content PSCs. This deduction can be further confirmed from the VOC dependence on the light illumination intensity according to the following formula (3)
(3)
where
k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and the basic electrical quantity, respectively. The parameter (n) can be used to describe the order of the recombination processes in the BHJ film. Trap-assisted recombination becomes more serious when a slope is larger than kT/q. In Fig. 7d, the slope of the control device is 1.29kT/q, while the slope of the optimized PSCs is 1.18kT/q, suggesting that the addition of 0.5% DPPT-TT in the active layer can effectively reduce the trap-assisted recombination.


In contrast to the control device, the FF of the PSCs increases significantly with the addition of DPPT-TT in the active layer. To further investigate the mechanism of FF enhancement in the DPPT-TT doped system, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to determine the charge carrier mobility of blend films. The J–V curves of electron-only (μe) and hole-only (μh) devices with different DPPT-TT doping ratios are shown in Fig. 8. The device structure and calculations are described in the ESI. The calculated μe and μh values are summarized in Table 3. It is interesting to note that μh increased with the increase in the DPPT-TT percentage while the electron mobility decreased, which may mainly attribute to the formed donor alloy with high mobility polymer mixing, and the small difference of HOMO levels P3 and DPPT-TT is also benefited to hole transfer between two polymers. The μe and μh values are 5.12 × 10−4 and 5.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the optimized ternary active layers, respectively. Meanwhile, the photo-generated electron and hole transport becomes more balanced with the μe/μh value of 0.95 in the optimized ternary PSCs, which is very vital for obtaining high PCE. The relatively low loss of photo-generated carriers can well explain the enhanced FF of the ternary PSCs. The hole mobility of the ternary systems was significantly enhanced, in accordance with their desirable FFs (66.2–68.87%), indicating that the incorporated DPPT-TT may influence the solid-state packing of the donor materials, as discussed previously, resulting in the enhancement of the SCLC mobilities.

In summary, ternary solar cells were fabricated with P3:PC71BM as the dominating system and DPPT-TT as the third component additive. The champion PCE of the ternary solar cells reached up to 8.30% with a JSC of 16.41 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.742 V and a FF of 66.67%, which preceded that of 6.15% for P3:PC71BM-base binary solar cells and that of 3.60% for DPPT-TT:PC71BM-based binary solar cells. An approximately 35% improved PCE was achieved compared with P3-based binary PSCs. The PCE enhancement of the optimal ternary solar cells can be obviously attributed to the increase of JSC due to the enhanced hole mobility, FFs, and improvement in exciton dissociation and less recombination losses simultaneously by synergistic effects of two polymers. The quasi-linear relationship between the VOC and the DPPT-TT content was investigated by the theory of DOS and DFT calculations, providing evidence of decreasing VOC in this donor alloy ternary systems. The results implied that appropriately choosing donor polymers could form a polymer alloy in the blend and the addition of the second donor with a lower Ne2 value can increase VOC more effectively. What's more, DPPT-TT was just one type of high mobility polymer, implying that there are many meaningful works to do in the ternary organic solar cells. This study has made important progress in understanding and designing ternary blend systems, and has provided an effective strategy for achieving high performance ternary PSCs.
