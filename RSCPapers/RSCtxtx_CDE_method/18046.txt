In this article, we present a wet ultrasonochemical synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 powders in the anatase form in ethanol solution and their surface decoration using uniformly dispersed Ag metallic nanoparticles of about 4 nm at concentration of n = 0.5 to 2.5 wt% and those of 10–20 nm larger at a higher concentration than 1 wt%. The structure of the prepared composites was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Optical properties were determined using UV-vis spectroscopy. Six polymer solar cells with modification by an TiO2/n-Ag hole transporting layer were manufactured and studied under AM 1.5G-simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The best performance was obtained for a device with the ITO/(PEDOT:PSS):1.5%Ag in TiO2/P3HT:PCBM/Al architectures. Under these conditions, a PCE of 2.07% with open circuit voltage Voc = 0.612 V, short circuit current density Jsc = 5.94 mA cm−2, and fill factor FF = 0.57 was achieved. Additionally, devices were tested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under illumination and a well-fitted equivalent circuit was proposed. Finally, our idea of the linkage of TiO2/n-Ag with PEDOT:PSS and P3HT in the constructed devices taking into account the amount of Ag in TiO2 was proposed.

An inorganic compound, titanium dioxide of chemical formula TiO2, was found naturally in three main crystalline polymorphs: anatase (tetragonal: space group I41/amd), brookite (orthorhombic: space group Pbca), and rutile (tetragonal: space group P42/mnm). The crystalline form of TiO2 influences both the properties and applications of titanium dioxide. TiO2 has been widely used in various applications, like Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, supercapacitors, electrochemical solar cells, photocatalysis and so on.

Several methods have been applied to synthesize TiO2 in the form of powder and thin films, including solid state synthesis as well as chemical routes such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol–gel or precipitation syntheses.
As of today, there are several notable examples proving that the value of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells has increased during the last few years. Presently, polymer solar cells based on the poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) mixture achieve a power conversion efficiency value from below 1% to more than 6%, according to the architecture of devices, the kind of hole transporting layer (HTL), and the applied conditions.
Whereas various active layers have been studied in depth, quite limited research concerns the investigation of the HTL in organic solar cells. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most common HTL in photovoltaics. Instead of the advantages of PEDOT:PSS such as a high work function, high transparency and good conductivity various disadvantages of PEDOT:PSS in polymer solar cells are defined. The decrease in the long-term stability and performance of devices with PEDOT:PSS is caused by the following factors: (i) aggregation of particles in the water solution of PEDOT:PSS, (ii) the strong acidic character of PSS in PEDOT:PSS and (iii) the hydrophilic character of PEDOT:PSS. To solve these problems, various inorganic and organic compounds are proposed instead of PEDOT:PSS applied in polymer solar cells. Among inorganic materials, mainly compounds such as V2O5, WO3, NiO, and MoO3 are proposed, however, their fabrication requires complicated thermal processes. Moreover, chemical modification of the PEDOT:PSS layer, synthesis of new organic compounds, addition of Ag and Au nanoparticles or application of graphene oxide as the HTL are proposed.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an attractive material as an electron acceptor and transport material and can be used as an optical spacer in polymer solar cells and also in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
In most cases TiO2 is proposed as the HTL in polymer solar cells. For example, Watanabe et al. proposed TiO2 as an HTL in polymer solar cells. For the ITO/dense TiO2/porous TiO2/P3HT/Au open circuit voltage Voc = 0.134 V, short circuit current Isc = 0.231 mA cm−2, fill factor FF = 0.38, and PCE = 0.012% in vacuum; while in an air atmosphere Voc = 0.490 V, Isc = 0.310 mA cm−2, FF = 0.40, and PCE = 0.061% were found.
Baek et al. showed that the solar cell ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PCBM/Au with nanoimprinted nanoporous TiO2 exhibited a higher PCE equal to 1.49% than on flat TiO2 (1.18%). The improved efficiency using nanoporous TiO2 was interpreted with the enhanced charge separation and collection by increasing the interface area betweenTiO2 and P3HT:PCBM.
In another approach TiO2 was applied as an additive to the active layer. For the hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the phenylenevinylene copolymer and perylenebisimide and the PCE value of TiO2 enhanced up to 1.32% compared with the device without TiO2 (0.72%).
We report here a simple and novel approach for the surface decoration of TiO2-anatase grains using 0.5–2.5 wt% of Ag metallic nanoparticles. We used this approach to modify the surface of TiO2-anatase powders synthesized by a wet ultrasonochemical synthesis.
To our knowledge, the wet ultrasonochemical method for obtaining TiO2/n-Ag nanopowders has not been used in organic photovoltaics until now. In this paper, we have deposited the TiO2/n-Ag on ITO coated glass substrate using PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution.
We evaluated the optimum amount of Ag in titanium dioxide for obtaining thin films with good morphology and we then used these substrates for the fabrication of organic solar cells.

Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and dichlorobenzene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass with a sheet resistance of 20 Ohm per square and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with a viscosity of 5–12 cP were purchased from Ossila.


A wet ultrasonochemical synthesis was used to produce nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) of the anatase structure. The anatase phase of the titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the starting reagent. The TiO2 powder was ground in an agate mortar and placed in a borosilicate glass beaker. The ultrasonochemical synthesis of the titanium(IV) oxide powder was performed in an ethanol solution. The TiO2 solid phase (powder) was dispersed in alcohol solution using an ultrasonic water bath cleaner for 1–3 hours from 25 to 60 °C to obtain a white-slurry form of TiO2–EtOH–H2O. Then, the slurry was heated from room temperature to 150 °C for a few hours under an air atmosphere. In the second step, the obtained powder was ground in an agate mortar. The flowchart of the wet ultrasonochemical synthesis of the TiO2-anatase powder is shown in Fig. 1.


To synthesize the TiO2/n-Ag composites, AgNO3 was firstly dissolved in an ethanol solution. Then, the prepared nanocrystalline TiO2 powder was added to the silver nitrate solution to obtain a suspension. In subsequent processes the weight ratio of Ag and TiO2 was 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02 and 0.025 respectively. The mixture was magnetically stirred for a few hours to obtain a homogenously dispersed suspension and then was dried in air for a few hours at 150 °C. In the last step, the composites were ground in an agate mortar to obtain a fine powder.


Phase identification of the prepared samples was carried out by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray Powder Diffractometer Siemens D-500. X-ray profiles were measured between 10 and 60° (2θ angle) with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.542 Å).

The TEM observations were performed using a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) Hitachi HD-2700 (Hitachi High Technologies Corporation, Japan) operating at 200 kV. Its various detectors like bright field (BF-STEM) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF), also called Z-contrast and a secondary electron (SE) detector, were applied to characterize the material structure. The TEM specimens were prepared by deposition of a small amount of the powder onto a carbon coated copper grid.
The surface was examined using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Raman studies were performed using a Renishaw inVia confocal micro-Raman spectrometer and a Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 532 nm.
XPS measurements were performed using a Microlab 350 (Thermo Electron) having a lateral resolution of several millimeters for XPS. The chemical state of surface species was identified using the high-energy resolution spherical sector analyzer of an XPS spectrometer (the maximum energy resolution is 0.83 eV for the XPS method). The XPS spectra were excited using AlKα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation as a source. The high resolution spectra were recorded using 40 eV pass energy. A linear or Shirley background subtraction was used to obtain the XPS signal intensity. The peaks were fitted using an asymmetric Gaussian/Lorentzian mixed function. The measured binding energies were corrected with reference to the energy of C 1s at 285.0 eV. Avantage-based data system software (Version 5.41) was used for data processing.
The measurements were performed using an AFM instrument Innova from Bruker equipped with a 100 μm × 100 μm scanner. TappingMode was used in order to minimize the tip-sample interaction and avoid the surface modification. The diagnostic procedure was carried out under ambient conditions (temperature approximately 25 °C and relative humidity 35%). The RTESPA-300 probes from Bruker were used (nominal tip radius rtip = 8 nm, resonance frequency range fres = 300–400 kHz, and spring constant k = 20–80 N m−1). The data were processed using the SPIP software from Image Metrology company.
Relative reflectance spectra in the powder were recorded by using a Jasco V670 spectrophotometer with a reflectance measurement system. The incident angle was set to be 90 degree and the reference sample was a white block of PTFE.

The solar cells were constructed on an ITO-coated glass substrate with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al structure. First, the ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned with deionized water and then ultrasonicated in isopropanol for approximately 20 minutes. Hole transporting layers (HTL) based on PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS with TiO2/n-Ag were spin cast (2500 turns per minute, 25 s) from an aqueous solution to form a film on the ITO substrate. The solution of TiO2/n-Ag in water was made by the following procedure: 50 mg of TiO2/n-Ag (as a powder) were added to 50 ml of water and then it was ultrasonicated in a bath by 1 h. Next, dispersed TiO2/n-Ag was centrifuged with 4000 rpm speed and this solution was decanted. The supernatant aqueous solution of TiO2/n-Ag was added to aqueous (PEDOT:PSS) in 1:1 volume ratios.

In our experiments the weight of the initial amount of the TiO2–Ag powder indicated only the amount of the starting portion of TiO2–Ag. In our case, the TiO2–Ag powders were dispersed in water to obtain a homogenous suspension. If these powders of 60–200 nm size were dispersed in water by ultrasound and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm, the particles of this size are unable to separate at this centrifugation speed from the solution and settle on the walls. If the TiO2–Ag powders were added to PEDOT:PSS, the agglomerates could be formed.
The HTL was annealed 30 minutes at 130 °C. Then, a P3HT:PCBM (1:1) mixture in a dichlorobenzene solution was spin cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. An aluminum electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum of about 5 × 10−5 Torr. The obtained devices were oven annealed for 10 minutes at 130 °C in an air atmosphere.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Solar Simulator Model SS100AAA with AM 1.5G equipped with a 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp. The area of one photovoltaic pixel was 4.5 mm2.
The solar cells were also measured using impedance spectroscopy on a Solartron precision LCR meter Model SI1260 in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with a 20 mV test signal. To study the photogeneration of charge carriers in the bulk heterojunction solar cells measurements under illumination (xenon lamp, 100 klx) were performed.


Fig. 2 depicts the XRD patterns of the pure and silver-decorated TiO2-anatase powders. For each sample (A–G see Fig. 2) including those with high concentration of Ag (2.5 wt%) all the peaks associated with titanium(IV) oxide are in good agreement with the tetragonal (space symmetry group: I41/amd (141)) anatase phase pattern (ICDD PDF Card – 21-1272) confirming that decoration on the surface of pristine TiO2 does not lead to any phase segregation. As shown in Fig. 2 all 7 characteristic peaks feature at 2θ angles (in the measurements range from 10° to 60°) of 25.32°, 36.98°, 37.83°, 38.59°, 48.08°, 53.94°, 55.11° for CuKα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å), corresponding to the crystal planes (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105) and (211), respectively.

Lattice parameters (a and c), cell volumes of the titanium dioxide powders and their average crystallite sizes, calculated based on the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2, are listed in Table 1.

No significant change in the Ag content was observed. In particular, for all samples, the average crystallite sizes of TiO2 (as calculated from the Scherrer formula, allowing for the instrumental line broadening) were in the range of 67 to 82 nm. No crystallite size of Ag nanoparticles was estimated from the XRD data due to very low peak intensities and low silver weight content. The unit cell parameters and the unit cell volumes of TiO2 powders decorated with n-silver nanoparticles (see Table 1) calculated from the XRD data are consistent with the standard values (a0 = 3.785 Å, c0 = 9.513 Å, V0 = 136.29 Å3) of the ICDD PDF card.

The morphologies of different contents of Ag surface modified TiO2 powders observed in secondary electrons are presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen the powder contains agglomerates with particle sizes in the range of 60 to 200 nm. The particles have circular shape and show rather homogeneous size distribution. On the surface of TiO2 particles very fine silver particles can be found. In the case of the powder with the lowest content of silver 0.5 wt% the diameter of the deposited nanoparticles did not exceed 4 nm. A similar size of Ag nanoparticles was noted in previous work where the same technique was applied for the surface modification of Li4Ti5O12. For a higher content of silver 1.5 wt% nanoparticles similar in diameter were observed, however, singular larger nanoparticles with diameter 15–20 nm were also found. For 2.5 wt% larger silver nanoparticles with diameter 10–15 nm were observed more often. It must be said that the distribution of the smallest (below 4 nm) silver nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface is homogeneous, which is similar for all contents of used Ag.

It should be mentioned that the particle size data presented in Table 1 were obtained from XRD measurements, where the crystallite size can be estimated from the width of peaks. Fig. 3 presents images of TiO2 particles in the SE mode, with size in the range from 60 to 200 nm. In this case it is possible that one particle consists of few smaller crystallites. It may be the reason for the differences in the size of particle measured by XRD and SEM experiments.
The visualization of the abovementioned size of silver nanoparticles on the titanium dioxide surface as a function of silver concentration used to obtain TiO2/n-Ag composites is in Fig. 4.
The details of the deposited silver nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. In HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 5a and b) silver nanoparticles are clearly seen as bright objects. They have bimodal size distribution with larger nanoparticles of about 20 nm and finer nanoparticles below 4 nm diameter. Both types of silver particles are homogeneously distributed on the TiO2 powder surface. A closer view of the silver deposited on TiO2 was obtained by HR-STEM (Fig. 5c). The measured interplanar spacing of the nanoparticles is about 0.23 nm corresponding to (111) atomic planes of the pure silver phase. It can be seen that the analyzed particles contain different oriented crystallites which are clearly visible. In the case of the finest nanoparticles, the crystalline structure was not verified because of the problems with imaging such a small volume deposited on much larger particles. The lattice spacing measured as being about 0.35 nm corresponds to the anatase phase (101) plane, where d = 0.352 nm (21-1272 ICDD PDF card number). Fig. 5d shows the TiO2 powder after surface modification in the BF-STEM mode.

There are six Raman active phonon modes (A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg) expected for tetragonal anatase TiO2 from group theory and reported in experiments. They can be observed in the range from 140 to 640 cm−1. Raman scattering has been measured on a reference Ag-free sample and on all TiO2/n-Ag samples, at room temperature.

As shown in Fig. 6 all samples revealed typical TiO2-anatase Raman spectra. The observed Raman lines at 144, 197, 396, 515 and 638 cm−1 could be assigned to: Eg, Eg, B1g, (A1g + B1g) and Eg, respectively. The doublet of the A1g and B1g modes was represented by the peak at 515 cm−1. The strongest peak was related to the lowest frequency Eg mode at 144 cm−1, which was in agreement with earlier reports. The observed Raman lines were very sharp, for example, the strongest Eg mode had full width at half maximum of 9 cm−3. In addition, the Raman spectral analysis of our powders showed that the surface modification of TiO2 with Ag NPs at concentrations from 0.5 to 2.5 wt% affected the intensity of the Raman signal reducing it about 3 times. It was probably due to absorption on plasmons in the Ag precipitates. The increase in visible light absorption is analyzed in Section 3.1.6.
As compared to the reference, an additional peak at 1049 cm−1 could be observed (see Fig. 6) for samples containing Ag. The peak corresponded to the symmetric stretching vibration of the NO3 (ν1) anion. The intensity of the AgNO3 peak increased with the silver nitrate amount used during the modification process. The same effect of the decomposition of silver nitrate in ethanol solution to metallic silver and a small residue of silver nitrate which covered the Ag NP precipitates was observed in the surface modified anode material of a spinel structure for lithium-ion batteries: Li4Ti5O12/n-Ag. The difference between the presented here and above mentioned in our article surface modification process using Ag NPs of the anatase material are water solution of decomposition of AgNO3 and less than by half content of AgNO3 used to the surface modification.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments were performed to elucidate both the titania powder structure and the chemical state of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 7a shows the XPS survey spectra of pure TiO2 and 1.5 wt% Ag/TiO2 powders prepared by the ultrasonochemical method. The TiO2 powder contains only Ti and O elements and a trace amount of carbon. The C element is ascribed to the adventitious hydrocarbon from an XPS instrument itself. The survey XPS spectrum of 1.5 wt% Ag/TiO2 confirmed the presence of Ag in the modified TiO2 powder. Fig. 7b shows the Ti 2p core level XPS spectra of both TiO2 and 1.5 wt% Ag/TiO2 powders. A clear single peak set (Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 at approximately 464.9 eV and 459.1 eV, respectively) corresponding to the Ti4+ state can be observed. The split between the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 core levels is 5.8 eV, also indicating the Ti4+ oxidation state. The XPS spectrum confined to the Ag window (see Fig. 7c) gave the binding energies of Ag 3d doublet peaks to be 368.1 eV (Ag 3d5/2) and 374.1 eV (Ag 3d3/2) which implies that Ag exists in 1.5 wt% Ag/TiO2 composites as metallic silver. TiO2 powders with different contents of Ag nanoparticles such as 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 wt% also show that the Ag species deposited on TiO2 powders are all in metal Ag.



Fig. 8 shows the examples of the acquired images. In order to improve the readability of the data, the Sobel transform of the topography images was applied and presented. Such a non-directional derivative of the image reveals subtle features and details that one could miss while analyzing typical height images. Such a transform was successfully used before. The obtained results clearly show an ordered structure of the grains, as the facets can be distinguished. Also the presence of single silver nanoparticles can be noted on the surface of bigger TiO2 crystals.

The topography analysis enabled the determination of the size of the grains. Few dozen grains have been measured in order to provide the statistical analysis. Three size fractions were observed: 1126 ± 88 nm, 757 ± 75 nm and 498 ± 83 nm. In addition, the analysis of the cross-sections of the grains allowed distinguishing the fractions of angles between the facets (10–20 angles for each fraction was determined, providing statistical analysis): 132.9 ± 1.2 deg, 136.9 ± 2.3 deg, 140.9 ± 0.9 deg, 146.8 ± 1.5 deg, 154.8 ± 1.3 deg. After matching attempts to certain facets of various anatase forms, we propose following sets of facets, respectively, using Miller indices: no. 11 – (001)/(46.19), no. 3 – (101)/(10–1), no. 33 – (001)/(013), no. 51 – (112)/(23.19), no. 51 (001)/(23.19). It should be underlined that due to crystal's rotational symmetry, whole sets of Miller indices are valid for the presented angles.


Fig. 9 shows the diffuse reflective UV-vis spectra and Kubelka–Munk function of TiO2/n-Ag samples.

All investigated samples exhibited one absorption maximum band at 400 nm and an optical energy gap (Eg) of 3.32 eV, independent of the amount of Ag in TiO2. Moreover, a weak and narrow absorption band was observed in the range of 400–600 nm for pristine TiO2 and for 0.5, 1 and 2.5% of Ag in titanium dioxide (see Fig. 9c). A second absorption band of 0.5% Ag in TiO2 was red shifted compared with other samples to 524 nm. The presence of the second absorption band for the selected TiO2 samples with Ag is caused by the so-called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced by visible light. Similar behavior was found in ref. 74 and 75.

To assess the influence of the different amounts of Ag in TiO2 on photovoltaic parameters, polymer solar cells were fabricated. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were constructed in a standard device architecture: ITO/HTL/P3HT:PCBM/Ag with a hole transporting layer (HTL) blend using a (PEDOT:PSS):TiO2/n-Ag ratio of 1:1, with n = 0–2.5%. The PV performance of these devices under 1.5 AM illumination is presented in Fig. 10 and summarized in Table 2.

The best performance was obtained for the device with the HTL based on (PEDOT:PSS):TiO2/1.5%Ag. Under these conditions, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.07% with open circuit voltage Voc = 0.612 V, short circuit current density Jsc = 5.94 mA cm−2, and fill factor FF = 0.57 was achieved.
The open circuit voltage (Voc) is similar in all devices, 0.601–0.612 V, and independent of the amount of Ag in TiO2 nanoparticles. The short circuit current density (Jsc) depends on the efficiencies of the light absorption of the active layer and broadness and maximum of the absorption band. In our case the increase in Jsc is evident for the device with 1.5% Ag in TiO2 as compared with other devices (see Table 2). The analysis shows that PV parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) of the devices constructed with (PEDOT:PSS):TiO2/n-Ag hole transporting layers depend mostly on the amount of Ag in the HTL as graphically presented in Fig. 11. It can be noticed that all parameters reach a maximum at a 1.5% Ag in TiO2.
Our study shows that photovoltaic parameters of the device with 1.5% Ag in TiO2 increased compared with the device with TiO2 or without TiO2 (see Fig. 11). A higher increase in the PCE equal to 51% of the device with 1.5% Ag in TiO2 was found compared with the device with TiO2.
Finally, we can conclude that all created devices with Ag in TiO2 showed performance increase compared to solar cells without Ag in titanium dioxide (see Table 2).
The polymer solar cells were additionally studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Nyquist and Bode plots along with the equivalent circuits of all devices are presented in Fig. 12. The EIS experiments were fitted based on previous reports and summarized in Table 3.

For all constructed devices defined semicircles are observed in Nyquist plots as well as phase angles below 90°, characteristic of RQ circuits. A noticeable decrease in the values of the real (Z′) and the imaginary (Z′′) parts of the complex impedance was observed under illumination along with a change in the amount of Ag in the HTL (see Fig. 12), which indicates the creation of additional charge carriers. A non-monotonous variation of the circle diameter and the impedance module is observed with the amount of Ag. The highest impedance module is observed with 1.5% and 1% of Ag in TiO2. Moreover, a shift is observed in the frequency with the maximum change in the phase angle with a similar tendency to circle diameter and impedance modulus (1.5% = 1% > 2% > ref. > 2.5% > 0.5% > 0% of Ag in TiO2), indicating variations in the space charge layer.
As shown in Fig. 12, the diameter of the semicircle for the devices with 0.5% of Ag in TiO2 and without Ag in TiO2 was the smallest in comparison to the other devices. Only for the devices with 1 and 1.5% Ag in TiO2 a huge increase in the diameter of the semicircle was observed, probably as a result of increased resistance (for 1% Ag: Rs = 4.5 Ω, for 1.5% Ag: Rs = 4.44 Ω, see Table 3).
The resistance value (R1) of the investigated devices with Ag in TiO2 in the HTL increases up to 2% of Ag incorporation, while R2 value increases up to 1.5% of Ag incorporation to the HTL (see Table 3). The mean relaxation times are defined as τm = (RmTm)1/pm, where T is Q–T and p is Q–P (Q is the constant phase element of the investigated layer, m = 1, 2, and corresponds to the relaxation time of processes that occur within the active layer and at the interface, respectively). The lowest values of τ1 and τ2 were found for the device with 1.5% of Ag in TiO2 in the HTL. However, the device without TiO2 in the HTL showed the lowest value of τ2 among all of the investigated solar cells.
It should be mentioned that the values of Q1–P of investigated solar cells are higher than 0.5, except for only two devices with TiO2, and 2.5% of Ag in TiO2 (see Table 3). For reference device and for devices with 1% and 1.5% of Ag in TiO2 the Q1–P value was about 0.7 (see Table 3). While for devices with 0.5% and 2% of Ag in TiO2 the Q1–P value was about 0.6. A low Q1–P value of about 0.3 was observed also in our previous work for solar cells with Ag nanoparticles in the PEDOT:PSS layer. This behaviour could be explained by various sizes, shapes, and surface of Ag nanoparticles coverages on the TiO2 influence on the electrical properties of the created devices. Moreover, the influence of aggregates cannot be excluded.
Capacitance (Fig. 13) seems to have a convoluted effect on the improvement due to the Ag effects on the HTL. Similar values of Rs (Fig. 13) seem to be affected by the entire device following the same tendency as capacitance.
As a summary of this part of our work, we demonstrate that the amount of Ag in TiO2 plays a significant role in the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS seems to bond to the crystalline structure of TiO2via S-atom bridging. Moreover interactions between P3HT and TiO2 cannot be excluded.
The oxygen vacancies (Ovac) in TiO2 are known as good electron traps and have a high number of recombination centers. In our case the amount of Ag in TiO2 in the HTL influenced the photovoltaic parameters of the constructed solar cells. Our preliminary interpretation of this effect could be explained by the different interactions of TiO2 with the HTL or active layer depending on the amount of Ag in TiO2 and oxygen vacancies. In our point of view for the devices with 0.5–1.5% of Ag in TiO2 mainly linkage between PEDOT:PSS and TiO2 is created while for the higher amount of Ag in TiO2 probably interactions between P3HT and TiO2 are preferred. This part of our work needs more investigations. A scheme for the linkage of PEDOT:PSS and P3HT to TiO2/n-Ag in the constructed devices is presented in Fig. 14.

We have successfully synthesized the single-phase TiO2-anatase powder using wet ultrasonochemical synthesis in ethanol solution. The surface of TiO2-anatase grains was modified with a very small content of 0.5–2.5 wt% of uniformly dispersed Ag metallic NPs of about 4 nm. We also observed larger Ag NPs in the range of 10–20 nm for a higher concentration of silver than 1 wt%.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the influence of the amount of silver nanoparticles in the TiO2 hole transporting layer based on PEDOT:PSS on the performance of polymer solar cells with a P3HT:PCBM active layer. For standard BHJ devices with 1.5% Ag in TiO2 added to PEDOT:PSS the highest value of PCE, equal to 2.07%, was found. An improvement in the device performance was observed and explained by the specific role of Ag in TiO2 in the modification of the hole transporting layer and the contact surface between titanium dioxide and P3HT.
