In organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, though the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis phenomenon is accepted to be caused by ion migration coupled with charge carrier recombination, there are still rich hysteresis characteristics (various J–V hysteresis loops) remaining to be explained. Here, a systematic drift-diffusion simulation study is conducted to explore the effect of interfacial recombination lifetime (τinterface), bulk charge carrier lifetime (τbulk) and mobility (μ) on J–V hysteresis behaviors. The simulation results show that, for devices with only interfacial recombination, the decrease of τinterface will lead to J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap on the open circuit side. For devices with only bulk recombination, the drop of τbulk will lead to J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap on the short circuit side. Meanwhile, in both cases, the decrease of μ aggravates the effect of interfacial and bulk recombination, while it has no effect on VOC. Our simulations reveal the effect of decreased τinterface, τbulk and μ on the J–V characteristics and explain the hysteresis loops with specific shapes, which have been reported in the literature.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have found their applications in X-ray detectors, light emitting diodes, optical sensors and photovoltaic devices, due to their high absorption coefficient in the visible light region, low exciton binding energy, long charge carrier lifetime, relatively high charge carrier mobility and high defect tolerance. Among these properties, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has reached 23.2% during the research and development in the last decade. Despite the success in photovoltaic application, hybrid perovskite materials are mixed ionic–electronic conductors, leading to the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis phenomenon in PVSCs. Previous reports show that iodine (I−) and methylammonium (MA+) ions are the major mobile species in methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3). By accounting for the ion migration effect in the drift-diffusion simulation, van Reenen et al. and Richardson et al. have successfully reproduced the commonly reported J–V hysteresis loops. To date, the J–V hysteresis phenomenon has been accepted to be caused by ion migration coupled with charge carrier recombination.

Previously, a set of J–V hysteresis loops with different characteristics have been reported, including: (1) J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap near the short circuit region, (2) J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap near the VOC region, (3) inverted J–V hysteresis loops with smaller open circuit voltage (VOC) in the reverse scan, and (4) inverted J–V hysteresis loops with smaller short circuit current density (JSC) in the reverse scan. Furthermore, the characteristic JSC reduction phenomenon (with a constant VOC) during the device aging process has also been reported. Among the hysteresis behaviors, the inverted hysteresis phenomena have been already studied and explained. Our previous work revealed that the interfacial barriers at the perovskite interfaces, originating from the presetting-bias-induced ion accumulation and film decomposition, exhibit a significant contribution to the inverted hysteresis. However, there are still rich hysteresis behaviors remaining to be explained.
In this work, in order to reveal the origin of various J–V hysteresis loops, a detailed drift-diffusion simulation is conducted to explore the effect of perovskite bulk charge carrier lifetime (τbulk), mobility (μ) and interfacial recombination lifetime (τinterface) on J–V hysteresis behaviors. The simulation results show that, for the device with only interfacial recombination at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge transport layers (CTLs), the decrease of τinterface results in lower VOC, while JSC remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, moderate interfacial recombination leads to J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap on the open-circuit side. For the device with only bulk recombination, the decrease of τbulk results in the drop of both VOC and JSC, and J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap on the short-circuit side. In both cases, the decrease of μ has no obvious effect on VOC. However, it will lead to lower charge extraction efficiency and higher charge carrier density in the perovskite layer, thus leading to a higher charge carrier recombination rate in the perovskite layer and at the perovskite/CTL interfaces. Thus, the decrease of μ will aggravate the effect of interfacial recombination and bulk recombination. Our simulated J–V hysteresis loops well resemble those experimentally reported in the literature and reveal the origin of different J–V hysteresis loops. Our work also indicates that the shape of the J–V hysteresis loops can be used as a measure for evaluating the dominant recombination pathways in PVSCs.

A PSISN device structure is adopted to perform the J–V characteristic simulation (refer to the ESI for a detailed description of the simulation model). Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the device structure and recombination mechanisms used in the simulation. The TiO2 (N)/interfacial recombination layer (S)/perovskite (I)/interfacial recombination layer (S)/Spiro-OMeTAD (P) (PSISN) device structure is adopted in our simulation. 0.01 nm thick interfacial recombination layers are inserted between perovskite and CTLs, at which the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination mechanism is used to mimic the interfacial recombination process, as illustrated by the blue sketches in Fig. 1. This SRH recombination lifetime is marked as τinterface (interfacial recombination lifetime). In the perovskite active layer, a radiative recombination coefficient (Bradiative) of 2 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 is added (green arrow), yielding a VOC of approximately 1.3 V, which is about the room temperature radiative limit for PVSCs with a band gap of 1.6 eV. The radiative recombination rate is Rradiative (Rradiative ∝ Bradiative·n·p, where n or p is the electron or hole density). Then, the SRH recombination mechanism is added in the perovskite active layer with a recombination lifetime of τbulk (bulk recombination lifetime), as illustrated by the red arrows.

And mobile cations and anions with the same concentration of 5 × 1023 m−3 are added into the perovskite active layer to mimic the ion migration effect and the ion mobility is 1 × 10−10 cm2 V−1 s−1. A uniform generation rate of 3.3 × 1027 m−3 s−1 is adopted in the perovskite active layer to mimic light absorption, yielding a JSC of 21.15 mA cm−2. In the simulation, the devices are first held at a forward bias voltage of 1.2 V (or 1.35 V, in cases with VOC > 1.2 V) to allow ions to migrate and achieve an equilibrium condition. Next, the bias voltage is scanned from 1.2 V (or 1.35 V) to −0.2 V (reverse scan), and immediately scanned back to 1.2 V (or 1.35 V) (forward scan) to obtain a complete J–V loop. The duration time (scan rate, scan rate = voltage range/duration time) for each J–V loop is fixed at 0.1 s (28 V s−1), 8.1 s (350 mV s−1), 20.1 s (140 mV s−1), 40.1 s (70 mV s−1) and 100.1 s (28 mV s−1) to mimic fast and slow scanning protocols. The main simulation parameters are summarized in Table 1. The doping concentration in the TiO2 (Spiro) layer is 1024 m−3, yielding a built-in potential of ∼1 V.

We first simulated the devices with only interfacial recombination. Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI) show the simulated J–V curves with τinterface = 20, 1, 0.2, and 0.05 ns (corresponding to the surface recombination velocity Vsurface = 1, 20, 100, and 400 cm s−1, see the ESI). For devices without mobile ions (Fig. S2, ESI), as τinterface decreases from 20 ns to 0.05 ns, VOC drops consequently from 1.216 to 1.016 V, FF drops slightly (from 0.845 to 0.803), while JSC remains unchanged (21.15 mA cm−2). For devices with mobile ions (Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S3a, ESI), the decrease of τinterface results in the hysteresis effect. As shown in Fig. 2a–c (τinterface = 20, 1 and 0.2 ns, respectively), the fast reverse scans (red line, duration time = 20.1 s) give higher VOC and fill factor (FF) than the fast forward scans (red dashed line, duration time = 20.1 s). But, there is almost no difference in JSC between the fast forward and reverse scans. The result indicates that a moderate interfacial recombination gives rise to a hysteresis loop with a large gap on the open-circuit side and has little effect on JSC. And, the device parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) for each J–V curve are summarized in Fig. 2d and Fig. S3b–d (ESI). This shows clearly that the reverse scans (lines) give better device parameters than the forward scans (dashed lines). For larger duration time (slower scan rate), the difference between the reverse and forward scans is diminished. In Fig. S3a (ESI), as τinterface drops further down to 0.05 ns, the severe interfacial recombination even imparts a pronounced impact at the low bias voltage region, with a narrow hysteresis gap under short circuit conditions (duration time = 20.1 s, red curves, reverse scan: JSC = 21 mA cm−2, forward scan: JSC = 19.7 mA cm−2). A slight JSC reduction (∼0.5 mA cm−2) is obtained at a slower scan rate (duration time = 100.1 s, blue curve). In summary, interfacial recombination has a more significant effect on the open-circuit side than on the short-circuit side, resulting in the J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap near VOC.

In order to explain this phenomenon, for J–V hysteresis loops with τinterface = 1 ns and duration time = 20.1 s (Fig. 2b, red curve), the ion density, energy level and carrier density profile at both 1.1 V and 0 V are extracted. Fig. 3a shows the ion density profile at 1.1 V for both the reverse and forward scans. Since the device is first held at 1.2 V to allow ions to migrate to an equilibrium state, the accumulated ions have no time to relax as the bias voltage is scanned from 1.2 V to 1.1 V during the fast reverse scan, resulting in anion accumulation at the perovskite/Spiro interface (position = 500 nm, black squares) and cation accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface (position = 100 nm, red circles). As the bias voltage is scanned backwards from −0.2 V to 1.1 V during the forward scan, the mobile ions have sufficient time to relax, resulting in negligible ion accumulation, as indicated by the nearly uniform distribution of cations and anions (blue and pink triangles). As a result, during the forward scan, the energy levels of the perovskite layer (from 100 to 500 nm) are bended downward, mainly owing to the electric field produced by the injected electrons (holes) in the TiO2 (Spiro) layer (blue and pink curves in Fig. 3b). On the other hand, during the reverse scan, the accumulated ions will compensate the electric field in the perovskite layer, resulting in negligible net electric field (or slightly upward band bending) in perovskite bulk (black and red curves in Fig. 3b, from 150 to 450 nm). Meanwhile, the net electric field is confined to the interfacial regions (black and red curves in Fig. 3b, from 100 to 150 nm and from 450 to 500 nm). The resulting carrier density (n, p) profile in the perovskite layer is shown in Fig. 3c. During the forward scan, a large number of electrons (holes) are swept towards the perovskite/Spiro (TiO2/perovskite) interface by the electric field (Fig. S4, ESI). The electron density at the perovskite/Spiro interface is approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than that at the TiO2/perovskite interface (blue triangle curves, from ∼2 × 1019 to ∼4 × 1021 m−3). In contrast, during the reverse scan, electrons and holes are approximately uniformly distributed in the perovskite layer (Fig. 3c, black and red curves), with lower electron (hole) density at the perovskite/Spiro (TiO2/perovskite) interfaces: ∼5 × 1020 m−3 (∼2 × 1021 m−3).

Fig. 3d shows the ion density profile at zero bias. For both the reverse and forward scans, the mobile ions have sufficient time to relax, resulting in significant anion (cation) accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite (perovskite/Spiro) interfaces. Due to the ion accumulation effect, there is almost no net electric field remaining in the perovskite layer, as indicated by the nearly flat energy levels (Fig. 3e, from 150 to 450 nm). The net electric field is confined to the interfacial regions (Fig. S4, ESI). It should be noted that the energy levels of the perovskite layer (from 150 to 450 nm) are slightly bended upward (downward) for the reverse (forward) scan, resulting in a higher carrier density during the forward scan than that during the reverse scan (Fig. 3f). The electron (hole) density at the perovskite/Spiro (TiO2/perovskite) interface is ∼2 × 1019 m−3 during the forward scan, which is 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than the case at 1.1 V.
The net carrier generation rate (the generation rate subtracted by the recombination rate) is shown in Fig. 4a. In the simulation, a uniform generation rate of 3.3 × 1027 m−3 s−1 is adopted in the perovskite layer, as mentioned above. And the recombination rate at the interface is proportional to p/τinterface (n/τinterface) at the TiO2/perovskite (perovskite/Spiro) interface (see the ESI). A negative rate means a higher recombination rate compared with the generation rate. In the perovskite layer (from 100 to 500 nm), the radiative recombination rate is pretty low and the net generation rate is ∼3.3 × 1027 m−3 s−1. However, at the TiO2/perovskite interface (position = 100 nm), the recombination rate is ∼7.3 × 1031 m−3 s−1 at 1.1 V in the forward scan (blue curve). This value is about twice that (∼3.7 × 1031 m−3 s−1) in the reverse scan (black curve). The same situation occurs at the perovskite/Spiro interface (position = 500 nm), with a recombination rate of ∼7.3 × 1031 m−3 s−1 (∼1 × 1031 m−3 s−1) at 1.1 V in the forward scan (reverse scan), thus resulting in larger recombination current for the forward scan than the reverse scan. A similar trend occurs at zero bias, although the carrier density is ∼1–2 orders smaller than that at 1.1 V and consequently the interfacial recombination rate is much lower (∼1–2 orders of magnitude smaller, green and violet curves). The result is in accordance with the J–V hysteresis loop shown in Fig. 2b (duration time = 20.1 s, red line and red dashed line). In other words, the interfacial recombination rate is sufficiently low at zero bias, while it is dominant with the bias close to VOC, since the recombination rate at the interface is proportional to p/τinterface (or n/τinterface). This can explain why moderate interfacial recombination induces large hysteresis on the open-circuit side.
We have also simulated the effect of interfacial recombination on the VOC–t dynamics, as shown in Fig. 4b. The device is first zero biased in the dark, allowing sufficient ion migration, followed by continuous light irradiation starting at t = 0 s. The VOC is recorded by measuring the voltage drop of a 106 Ohms resistor connected in series with the device. The horizontal black square curves show a room temperature radiative limit value of VOC (approximately 1.3 V), by considering radiative recombination in the perovskite layer (Bradiative = 2 × 10−11 cm3 s−1). As τinterface drops from 20 to 0.05 ns, a rising edge with a time interval of ∼8 s appears. The heights of the rising edges are about 30, 60, 100, 150 and 180 mV for τinterface = 20, 5, 1, 0.2 and 0.05 ns, respectively. Such VOC–t dynamic curves with a rising edge have been reported previously. For the devices with only interfacial recombination, the negative built-in electric field exists in the perovskite layer (Fig. S4b, red circle, ESI) during the fast forward scan (equivalent to the rising edge in VOC–t dynamics). The negative built-in electric field will drive electrons (holes) towards the perovskite/Spiro (perovskite/TiO2) interface (Fig. 3c, blue and pink triangles), resulting in a larger interfacial recombination current and a smaller VOC.
We further simulated the devices with only bulk recombination. Fig. 5 and Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI) show the simulated J–V curves with τbulk = 500, 200, 50, and 10 ns. Devices with and without ion migration are compared. For the devices without mobile ions (Fig. S5, ESI), as τbulk decreases from 500 ns to 10 ns, VOC drops from 1.24 V to 1.048 V. At the same time, a slight reduction of JSC (from 21.15 to 20.8 mA cm−2) and an obvious drop of FF (from 0.802 to 0.669) occur. On the other hand, for the devices with ion migration (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6, ESI), the hysteresis effect appears when decreasing τbulk. As shown in Fig. 5c (τbulk = 10 ns), a significant JSC reduction of ∼5.5 mA cm−2 is obtained for the slow scanning J–V loop (duration time = 100.1 s, blue curve) in comparison to the device without mobile ions (JSC = 20.8 mA cm−2). Furthermore, a large gap exists between the fast reverse and forward scans (duration time = 20.1 s, red line and red dashed line), with a characteristic bump at ∼0.7 V in the reverse scan. In contrast to the devices with interfacial recombination described above, here, there is no obvious difference of VOC between the reverse and forward scans (Fig. 5a, b and Fig. S6a, ESI). In a word, the bulk recombination will give rise to the J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap on the short-circuit side, with a clear JSC reduction and a characteristic bump in the reverse scan. Also, the device parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) for each J–V curve are summarized in Fig. 5d and Fig. S6b–d (ESI). This shows clearly that the reverse scans (lines) give better device parameters (JSC, FF, and PCE) than the forward scans (dashed lines), except VOC. And, for larger duration time (slower scan rate), the difference between the reverse and forward scans is diminished. Qualitatively, the reduction of JSC can be explained by the ion migration induced screening of the built-in electric field. During the fast reverse scans, the ion accumulation at the interfaces is diminished and there is sufficient net electric field remaining in perovskite bulk, resulting in lower carrier density in the perovskite layer. On the other hand, during the slow reverse or fast forward scans, severe ion accumulation will screen the built-in electric field in perovskite bulk, thus inhibiting charge extraction and resulting in higher carrier density in the perovskite layer. And higher carrier density means a larger recombination rate. Previously, Richardson et al. have reproduced this kind of J–V hysteresis loop in their simulation (only bulk SRH recombination is considered in their simulation). Here, based on our results, the bulk recombination is the predominant factor giving rise to the J–V hysteresis phenomenon with a large gap on the short-circuit side, and this phenomenon has nothing to do with interfacial recombination (Fig. 2). It is solely caused by ion migration and accumulation induced screening of the built-in electric field coupled with bulk recombination.
Similarly, we have extracted the ion density, energy level and carrier density profile for the device with only bulk recombination (τbulk = 10 ns) scanned with a duration time of 20.1 s (at both 0 V and 1.06 V), as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). The result is almost the same as those for the devices with only interfacial recombination shown in Fig. 3. The net generation rate in the device is shown in Fig. 6a. At zero bias (black and blue curves), due to the higher carrier density (Fig. S7e and f, ESI), the bulk SRH recombination rate in the forward scan is higher than that in the reverse scan, which is consistent with the large J–V hysteresis gap near zero bias (see Fig. 5c, duration time = 20.1 s, red line and red dashed line). On the other hand, since the bulk SRH recombination rate is determined by the density of the minority carrier (if n ≫ p, then the recombination rate is proportional to p/τbulk, see the ESI), the net generation rate at a bias of 1.06 V (Fig. 6a, green and violet curves) resembles the density distribution of the minority carrier (see Fig. S7c, ESI). As a result, during the forward scan, severe recombination takes place in the middle of the perovskite layer (violet curves, from 175 to 375 nm). During the reverse scan, severe recombination takes place in the region from 100 to 350 nm. Thus, at 1.06 V, the reverse scan gives larger recombination current than the forward scan, resulting in smaller VOC in the reverse scan. The result is in accordance with the J–V hysteresis loop shown in Fig. 5c (duration time = 20.1 s).

Fig. 6b shows the VOC–t dynamics of PVSCs with only bulk recombination. As τbulk drops from 500 to 10 ns, a falling edge (25–65 mV) with a time interval of ∼5 s appears. The falling edge in the VOC–t dynamic curve is in accordance with the characteristics of the J–V hysteresis loop in Fig. 5c, in which the fast forward scan gives a larger VOC than the reverse scan (duration time = 8.1 s, light-blue curve). This phenomenon was reported in the simulation work of Courtier et al. and has also been reproduced by Jacobs et al. by adopting very low surface recombination velocity (interfacial recombination rate). For the devices with only bulk SRH recombination, both the injection barriers at the perovskite/CTL interfaces and the negative built-in electric field in the perovskite layer (Fig. S8b, red circle, ESI) coexist during the fast forward scan. The injection barrier will hinder the charge injection and the negative built-in electric field will drive electrons and holes towards opposite sides in the perovskite layer (Fig. S7c, blue and pink triangles, ESI), resulting in a smaller bulk recombination current and a larger VOC. Such a picture is supported by the energy level profile in Fig. S7b (ESI) (blue and pink curves), the carrier density profile in Fig. S7c (ESI) (blue and pink curves) and the net generation rate profile in Fig. 6a (violet curve). Note that the falling edges on the VOC–t dynamic curves are simulated for the devices with only bulk recombination. Experimentally, although the VOC–t dynamic curves with a rising edge are common, those with a falling edge are rarely reported, implying the inevitability of the interfacial recombination in the real PVSCs.
At last, we investigated the effect of carrier mobility μ (mobility of the perovskite layer) on the J–V characteristics of the devices with only interfacial or bulk recombination. Fig. 7a–c and Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI) show the J–V hysteresis loops with only bulk recombination (τbulk = 50 ns). In the case of high carrier mobility (μ = 20 cm2 V−1 s−1, Fig. 7a and Fig. S10, ESI), the reverse and forward curves almost overlap with each other, exhibiting negligible hysteresis. As μ decreases to 2 (Fig. 7b and Fig. S10, ESI) and 0.2 (Fig. 7c and Fig. S10, ESI) cm2 V−1 s−1, JSC drops from 21 to 20 and 12 mA cm−2, leading to severe hysteresis with a large gap on the short-circuit side. Thus, in this case, the decrease of μ brings the same hysteresis behavior as the decrease of τbulk (Fig. 5). But there is no drop of VOC here (Fig. S9 and S10b, ESI). Qualitatively, the decrease of μ will hinder the charge extraction, resulting in higher charge carrier density, and thus a larger recombination rate in the perovskite layer. According to our simulation, a significant reduction of JSC with almost constant VOC, which has been frequently observed during the degradation process, may be ascribed to the decrease of carrier mobility. Fig. 7d–f and Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI) show the J–V hysteresis loops with different carrier mobilities for the devices with only interfacial recombination (τinterface = 0.05 ns). In the case of high carrier mobility (μ = 20 cm2 V−1 s−1, Fig. 7d and Fig. S12, ESI), there is an obvious gap between the fast reverse and forward scans near VOC (duration time = 20.1 s, red curve), while there is no gap on the short circuit side. As μ decreases to 2 (Fig. 7e and Fig. S12, ESI) and 0.2 (Fig. 7f and Fig. S12, ESI) cm2 V−1 s−1, the hysteresis gap near VOC is enlarged with a clear drop of FF and a slight drop of JSC (Fig. S12, ESI). As a result, a larger hysteresis gap appears. In other words, the decrease of μ brings the same hysteresis behavior as the decrease of τinterface (Fig. 2). As indicated by the VOC–t dynamics in Fig. S11b (ESI), the values of the steady VOC for different μ values are almost the same (∼1.04 V). Thus, the decrease of μ results in larger charge carrier density in the perovskite layer and will aggravate the effect of the interfacial or bulk recombination, but, has almost no effect on VOC.
In previous work, the J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap near VOC have been observed in the PVSCs experimentally. According to our simulation, in these PVSCs the perovskite layer is of high-quality with reduced bulk recombination and optimized carrier mobility and the dominant deficiency is the interfacial recombination. Meanwhile, for the PVSCs exhibiting the J–V hysteresis loops with a large gap near zero bias, which was also reported previously, the main deficiency is the bulk recombination and insufficient carrier mobility (the quality of the perovskite film is not optimized). Furthermore, the dramatic decrease of JSC with constant VOC, which has been observed during the degradation process, may be caused by the decrease of mobility in the perovskite layer. Our simulations reveal the effect of decreased τinterface, τbulk and μ on the shape of the J–V hysteresis loops. And, this should be useful to evaluate the dominant recombination pathways in the PVSCs, which is pursued in a recent work by Calado et al.

In summary, a systematic drift-diffusion simulation study has been conducted. Our simulation results show that the large gap on the open-circuit side of the J–V hysteresis loops is predominantly contributed by the severe interfacial recombination at the perovskite/CTL interfaces. On the other hand, the large gap on the short-circuit side is contributed by the severe bulk recombination in the perovskite layer with short carrier diffusion length (L), where L ∝ (μ·τbulk)0.5. In this case, either a decrease of μ or a drop of τbulk will lead to the reduction of L. Finally, the decrease of μ in the perovskite layer will aggravate the effect of interfacial and bulk recombination, while it has no effect on VOC. Our work can explain the origin of different J–V hysteresis behaviors which have been previously observed experimentally. Furthermore, according to our work, it is possible to develop a strategy for device diagnosis based on the detailed J–V characteristics.
