CsPbBr3 films have attractive applications in resistive switching memory, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and especially in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of their high stability and ease of fabrication under open air conditions. However, toxic solvents are usually employed to prepare CsPbBr3 films in these devices and pose potential threats to the health of manufacturers and the environment. Here, we develop a novel approach to achieve environment-friendly production of high quality CsPbBr3 films using water-soluble precursors of Pb(NO3)2 and CsBr in combination with phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr). In this approach, only green solvents of water and 2-propanol (IPA) are used to prepare CsPbBr3 films. After integrating into a solar cell with a typical configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon, the best solar cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.25% and has excellent stability in open air. This work not only provides a new approach to prepare high quality CsPbBr3 films, but also addresses the solvent toxicity during the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films, which makes it have extensive applications toward environment-friendly production of various CsPbBr3-based optoelectronic devices.

CsPbBr3 films have wide applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, resistive switching memory, photodetectors,etc. In these devices, it is key to obtain high performance by fabricating fully covered CsPbBr3 films. However, it is still a challenge to prepare fully covered CsPbBr3 films owing to the low solubility of CsBr in the common solvents. CsPbBr3 films are usually prepared through a two-step method which strongly depends on the usage of toxic solvents to prepare high quality CsPbBr3 films. Taking the CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as an example, toxic DMF and methanol are usually used to dissolve perovskite precursors of PbBr2 and CsBr in a sequential deposition process. However, most of the solvents used for the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films, including DMF and methanol, are toxic, which might lead to serious damage to the manufacturers’ health and the environment. For example, DMF used for dissolving the PbBr2 in the first step causes serious damage to various organs, especially to the liver of humans. Meanwhile, methanol used to dissolve CsBr also causes potential damage to the vision system. According to the occupational exposure standards in Europe, the 8 h time weighted average (TMA) limit of DMF is 15 mg m−3. TMA is the allowed maximum concentration value of hazardous agents in the workplace. Taking the actual production of PSCs into account, even if a worker manufactures PSCs in a space of 1000 m3, the TMA limits will be reached when only 16 mL DMF volatilizes into static air. The small amount of solvent will be a potential threat to human health when the manufacturers work in such conditions. It has been reported that the manufacturers, who work in the synthetic textiles industry, have more serious liver function injury than the general population owing to their long-term exposure to the DMF environment. Very recently, Vidal and co-workers assessed the health and environmental impacts of a series of solvents widely used for the fabrication of perovskite films. In their work, they use disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which quantifies the disease burden from mortality and disability, to evaluate the impacts of those solvents on the human population. According to their work, the most used solvent of DMF during the fabrication of perovskite films has the highest DALY, indicating the most deleterious effect of DMF on human health. Sooner after, Park concluded that ∼3500 L solvents are consumed for producing 1GW of solar power if the module is prepared by using blade-coated technology with a PCE of 15%. The enormous amounts of toxic solvents threaten the health of humans and the safety of the environment greatly. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a green approach, especially a DMF-free approach for the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films so as to guarantee the health of the manufacturers and environmental safety.

In order to reduce the solvent toxicity for preparing CsPbBr3 films, we developed an approach to prepare CsPbBr3 films, in which toxic methanol was replaced by water for preparing CsBr solutions, and then fully covered CsPbBr3 films were prepared by spin-coating concentrated CsBr/H2O solutions (∼250 mg mL−1) onto PbBr2 films, followed by annealing treatment. Obviously, the usage of CsBr/H2O solution has eliminated the solvent toxicity for the Cs source during the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films. However, toxic DMF was still used to dissolve PbBr2 in the first step, which is a tough obstacle toward environment-friendly production of CsPbBr3 films. In order to eliminate the toxicity of DMF during the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films, we also proposed a sustainable solvent system to prepare CsPbBr3 films. In this approach, a green solvent system composed of water, ethanol and ethylene glycol (EG) was used to prepare CsBr solutions, and a green solvent of triethyl phosphate (TEP) was used to prepare PbBr2 solutions. Then, the CsPbBr3 films were prepared via an anomalous sequential deposition route, in which CsBr films were firstly deposited, and then a drop of PbBr2/TEP solution (∼60 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto CsBr films through a dynamic spin-coating process, and then converted into CsPbBr3 films via annealing treatment. However, the CsPbBr3 films prepared using this approach exhibit rough morphology and a small grain size, which limits the enhancement of Voc for PSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new approach to prepare high quality CsPbBr3 films under green solvent systems.
If an aqueous lead precursor solution, such as Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution, and CsBr/H2O solution separately provided a Pb source and Cs source for the target CsPbBr3 films, it will not only achieve environment-friendly production of CsPbBr3 films, but also can reduce the cost for the production of CsPbBr3 films. Herein, we propose a new environment-friendly approach to prepare high quality CsPbBr3 films, where water-soluble perovskite precursors of Pb(NO3)2 and CsBr are used as Pb and Cs sources for the target CsPbBr3 films. Meanwhile, PEABr/IPA solution was used to supply the bromine (Br) for the Cs-Pb-Br films so as to obtain target CsPbBr3 films. After integrating the CsPbBr3 films into a solar cell with a typical configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon, it can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.25%, which is comparable to that prepared from the toxic solvents. The solar cell exhibits excellent stability under air conditions for 30 days without encapsulation. In this novel approach, only green and cheap solvents of water and 2-propanol (IPA) are used during the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films. Therefore, this work not only concerns the solvent toxicity during the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films, but also reduces the cost for fabrication of CsPbBr3 films, making it appealing for large-scale fabrication of CsPbBr3 film optoelectronic devices.

PbBr2 (99.0%), CsBr (99.5%) and Pb(NO3)2 (99.0%) were purchased from Aladdin. Phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%) was purchased from Innochem. Carbon paste was purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials. All chemical reagents were used without further treatment.


All solar cells were processed under air conditions with a relative humidity of 40% and a temperature of 30 °C. The cleaning of FTO and deposition of the TiO2 layer are similar to our previous work.


Fig. 1 illustrates the fabrication process of the CsPbBr3 films from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution. Firstly, Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution (1.2 M) was spin-coated onto the FTO/TiO2 substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to a form a Pb(NO3)2 film. Then, 90 μL phenethylammonium bromide/2-propanol (PEABr/IPA) with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 solution was dropped onto the Pb(NO3)2 film, and kept it for 60 s. Then, the substrates were spin-coated at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing treatment at 100 °C for 10 min to form an intermediate. After cooling to room temperature, a drop of CsBr/H2O solution (∼250 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the intermediates at a speed of 2000 rpm at the last 10 s, and then annealed at 250 °C for 5 min to form Cs–Pb–Br films. For the CsPbBr3 films fabricated from PbBr2/DMF, they were prepared by using two-step dynamic technology with the optimized conditions in our previous work. Briefly, PbBr2 films were first prepared by spin-coating from PbBr2/DMF solution (∼1.0 M) at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, 90 μL of CsBr/H2O solution (∼250 mg mL−1) was dropped onto the PbBr2 film at a speed of 2000 rpm for the last 10 s, and then annealed at 250 °C for 5 min to form CsPbBr3 films. For the construction of a typical solar cell, conducting carbon paste was deposited onto the CsPbBr3 film by blading technology to act as electrodes.

The XRD curves are obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert 3 Powder). The morphology of the films was investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (NoVaTM Nano SEM 430). The optical properties of films were recorded on a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (UV-2550). The steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra and TRPL signals of perovskite films were recorded using a photoluminescence spectrometer instrument (Edinburgh Instruments, LP 980). The J–V characteristics of devices were measured by using a Keithley 2400 under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination. The IPCE spectrum was recorded by using an integrated system from Enlitech (QE-R3011). Impedance spectra (IS) of the PSCs were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) under dark conditions. The effective area of the solar cells was 4 mm2 during the photovoltaic performance characterization.



Fig. 2a shows the XRD curves of the Pb(NO3)2 films before and after reacting with PEABr. There are three dominated diffraction peaks at 19.5°, 22.6°, 32.3° and 33.7° in the XRD of the Pb(NO3)2 film, which are assigned to the Pb(NO3)2 film. However, these characteristic peaks disappear, and some new diffraction peaks at 5.27°, 10.63° and 15.85° appear after reacting with PEABr. It implies that it forms some new complexes (denoted by Pb(NO3)2-PEABr) after the reaction between Pb(NO3)2 and PEABr. The formation of Pb(NO3)2-PEABr is further confirmed by an obvious difference in the UV-vis absorption spectra of Pb(NO3)2 and the new complex (see Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c illustrates the morphology of Pb(NO3)2 films, showing some large voids in the films. However, it exhibits a relative compact morphology (see Fig. 2d) after reacting with PEABr. The compact intermediates provide an excellent matrix to prepare high quality CsPbBr3 films. Fig. 2e shows an EDS spectrum of the new complex. Besides Ti and Sn elements from the TiO2 coated FTO substrates, Pb and Br elements are also detected in the samples, which come from Pb(NO3)2 and PEABr in the Pb(NO3)2-PEABr complex. Fig. 2f and g are the elemental mapping of Pb and Br in the Pb(NO3)2-PEABr complex, showing a uniform distribution in the films. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the Pb(NO3)2-PEABr complex. Further work is still needed to study the structure and properties of the Pb(NO3)2-PEABr complex in the future.

Hereafter, we try to prepare CsPbBr3 films by using PbBr2 and Pb(NO3)2-PEABr as the matrix, which are separately prepared from PbBr2/DMF solution and Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution. Fig. 3a shows XRD curves of the perovskite films prepared in different solutions. Both the XRD curves have three characteristic peaks at 15.2°, 21.6° and 30.6°, corresponding to the plane of (100), (110) and (200) of CsPbBr3, respectively. However, the intensity of XRD peaks of the CsPbBr3 films prepared from the Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution is much stronger than that prepared from PbBr2/DMF(see the inset in Fig. 3a), indicating the improved crystallization of CsPbBr3 films. Fig. 3b shows UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsPbBr3 films, showing an onset at ∼530 nm. The band gap fitted from the absorption spectrum (see the inset in Fig. 3b) is about ∼2.32 eV, which is consistent with previous works.Fig. 3c shows a SEM image of the CsPbBr3 films fabricated from general PbBr2/DMF solution. It shows compact morphology, which is consistent with our previous work.Fig. 3d shows a SEM image of the CsPbBr3 prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution. It shows that the films comprise large grains with full coverage, which are strongly desired for the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. Fig. 3e and f are cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding PSCs. The CsPbBr3 films in PSCs are in contact with other functional layers quite well. Compared with those prepared from the PbBr2/DMF solution, the PSCs prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution exhibit enlarged columnar grains accompanied by the thickness enhancement from ∼210 nm to ∼330 nm.

Fig. 4a shows the light J–V curves of the best solar cells, in which the CsPbBr3 films are prepared from different solutions. The PSC prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.25%, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.12 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.44 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.709. In contrast, the PSC prepared from the PbBr2/DMF solution exhibits a PCE of 5.95%, Jsc of 6.10 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.33 V and FF of 0.730. Fig. 4b shows the stabilized output at maximum power point of the best solar cell prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution. The stabilized current density is 4.64 mA cm−2, delivering a PCE of 5.38%. The stabilized PCE is located at the value between reverse scan and forward scan. This discrepancy is widely observed in the PSCs with obvious hysteresis behavior (see Fig. S1), which might come from the interface between FTO and the TiO2 layer.Fig. 4c shows the IPCE spectrum of the best solar cell, showing a light harvesting ability in a range from 300 nm to 530 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum (see Fig. 3b). The integrated Jsc from the IPCE spectrum is 5.19 mA cm−2, which is lower than that obtained from the J–V curve. This phenomenon is also widely observed in the organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs and CsPbBr3 solar cells, even in the certificated PSCs. Such a mismatch might relate to nonlinear behavior of the photocurrent with light intensity in PSCs. Importantly, we also achieve a high Voc of 1.50 V in a batch of PSCs. It exhibits a PCE of 5.15%, Jsc of 4.97 mA cm−2, FF of 0.691, and Voc of 1.50 V (see Fig. 4d). The Voc of 1.50 V is one of the highest values based on the unmodified device configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon. Fig. S2 shows the distribution of photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs prepared from different solutions, showing a good reliability of this novel approach for the fabrication of the CsPbBr3 solar cells. As summarized in our previous work, the PSCs with an unmodified configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon usually exhibit a PCE of ∼7%. These results show that it can obtain comparable PCE of PSCs by using an aqueous lead nitrate precursor in combination usage of green solvents to fabricate CsPbBr3 films, making this novel approach proposed in this work have a promising application in constructing CsPbBr3 film based devices.
In order to investigate the cause of the Voc enhancement of PSCs, we determine the trap density of CsPbBr3 films by recording dark I–V curves for the electron-only device with a device configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/PC61BM/carbon. The dark I–V curves from different devices are shown in Fig. 5a. The trap state density is calculated by the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) using the equation
(1)
where
e is elementary charge of the electron, nt is trap density, L is the thickness of the CsPbBr3 films, and ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant of CsPbBr3 (ε = 16.46) and vacuum permittivity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, the VTFL decreases from 1.06 V to 0.83 V when PbBr2/DMF solution is replaced by Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution for the fabrication of CsPbBr3 films, indicating that the electron trap density decreases from 4.37 × 1016 cm−3 to 1.39 × 1016 cm−3 in the CsPbBr3 films. Fig. 5b shows the steady PL of CsPbBr3 films on glass. As is shown, the intensity of the CsPbBr3 films prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O is markedly higher than that prepared from PbBr2/DMF solutions. The stronger PL intensity of perovskite films indicates a reduction in the nonradiative recombination induced by fewer trap sites in the CsPbBr3 films produced by the Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution. Meanwhile, a slight red shift in PL spectra is also observed in the CsPbBr3 films prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution in comparison with the ones prepared from PbBr2/DMF solutions. The emission peak of CsPbBr3 films prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution is much closer to the emission peak of CsPbBr3 single crystals (∼540 nm). Therefore, the red-shift in PL spectra may arise from the reduction of defect density in CsPbBr3 films, which can be attributed to the enlargement of CsPbBr3 grains in the films (see Fig. 3c and d). Those results are consistent with results in Fig. 5a. We also measure the time-resolved PL spectra of CsPbBr3 films on glass in Fig. 5c. The curves are well fitted by a bi-exponential decay as follows

(2)
where
τ1 and τ2 represent the fast decay time and slow decay time and A1 and A2 are the relative amplitude, respectively. The average life time (τave) is calculated using the following equation:

τave = (A1τ21 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)
(3)
For the CsPbBr3 film prepared from PbBr2/DMF solutions, it has a fast decay time τ1 = 1.00 ns (A1 = 76.36%) and a slow decay time τ2 = 2.51 ns (A2 = 23.64%). In contrast, the CsPbBr3 film prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O delivers a value of τ1 = 1.60 ns (A1 = 32.21%) and a slow decay time τ2 = 3.46 ns (A2 = 67.79%). Compared with CsPbBr3 films produced from PbBr2/DMF solutions, the average life time (τave) increases from 1.66 ns to 3.12 ns. These results strongly show that the CsPbBr3 films prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O have lower trap density than the ones prepared from PbBr2/DMF, and thereby suppress the non-radiative recombination and eventually result in Voc enhancement of PSCs (see Fig. 4a and Fig. S2d). In order to confirm this conclusion, we perform impedance spectroscopy (IS) to analyze the recombination in PSCs (see Fig. 5d). One typical semicircle can be distinguished under dark conditions in the low frequency range, which reflects the recombination rate in PSCs. The recombination rate in PSCs is inversely proportional to the radius of the semicircle. The equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance spectra is shown in Fig. S3. The fitting parameters are also listed in Table S1. As shown in Fig. 5d and Table S1, the recombination resistance (Rrec) increases from 4396 Ω to 6635 Ω when PbBr2/DMF solution is replaced by Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution to prepare CsPbBr3 films, demonstrating a low recombination rate in the PSCs prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O solution. Therefore, the CsPbBr3 films prepared from Pb(NO3)2/H2O with large grains and good crystallization contribute to the lower trap density and longer life time and thereby the suppression of recombination rate in PSCs, and eventually result in Voc enhancement in PSCs.
The stability of PSCs is an important factor for their practical application. Fig. 6 shows an evolution of the normalized photovoltaic parameters for an unencapsulated PSC under the 40% relative humidity at room temperature. It still maintains 94% of initial PCE even when stored for 30 days in open air, reconfirming the excellent stability of CsPbBr3 based solar cells. The high stability gives it great potential for its future practical application.

In summary, we developed a novel approach to achieve production of high quality CsPbBr3 films by using water-soluble precursors of Pb(NO3)2 and CsBr in combination with phenethylammonium bromide. The fabrication process only uses green water and isopropanol as solvents, which eliminates the potential pollution by toxic solvents. After integrating the CsPbBr3 films into a solar cell with an unmodified device configuration of FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon, it delivers a power conversion efficiency of 6.25%, which is comparable to those prepared from the perovskite precursors dissolved in toxic solvents. This work not only provides a green approach to prepare high quality CsPbBr3 films, but also can reduce the cost for the solvent during the fabrication of CsPbBr3 based devices.
