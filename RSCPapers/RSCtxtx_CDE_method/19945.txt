A novel polymer material, poly{5,10-bis(5-ethylhexyl-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione} (PDBT-F) is designed, synthesized, and used as a donor in polymer solar cells. Dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) with an extended conjugation length shows better π–π stacking, higher charge-carrier mobility, and broader absorptions to boost the photovoltaic performance. Further introducing fluorine atoms in side groups effectively deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level to enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc), promotes π–π stacking to increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc), thus obtaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.02% with IDIC. Moreover, ternary devices of PDBT-F:IDIC:PC71BM are constructed. As expected, the ternary device shows a higher Jsc by virtue of the absorption complementarity of PDBT-F:IDIC:PC71BM, thus gaining extended absorption; a higher Voc is caused by the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PC71BM. The cascaded LUMO levels of PDBT-F, PC71BM and IDIC facilitate the charge transfer, finally achieving a PCE of 11.86% with a PC71BM content of 10%. The results we report show the best performances based on DTBDT materials. This work also demonstrates that it is a wise strategy to combine a fullerene derivative with non-fullerene acceptors to construct high-performance ternary solar cells.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been brought into focus in recent decades due to their promisingly significant potentials as low-cost, easily large-area and flexible devices, which are likely to be applicable in roll-to-roll fabrications. For polymer heterojunction solar cells, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), which are the most indispensable parameters and equal to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) times the short-circuit current density (Jsc) times the fill factor (FF), have been improved to over 14% via new molecular designs, device optimization and so on. Designing new materials in the active layer both as donors and as acceptors is still the most essential cornerstone in this field for future efficiency promotion or industrialization. Over the past few decades, a series of outstanding materials has been reported for their applications in the active layer, called non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which were first reported by Zhan and his group. NFAs such as ITIC, IDIC, IT-4F and other acceptors, whose maximum absorption edge surpasses 800 nm or even 1000 nm, show unique advantages in near-infrared absorption, which occupies about 48% of the solar spectrum. Hence, to make full use of solar energy, a medium or wide bandgap polymer donor should be matched with these narrow bandgap acceptors. According to one proposed report, an ideal candidate for a polymer donor should follow the characteristics listed hereinafter. First, there should be a complementary absorption with a non-fullerene acceptor so that transfer of photons to excitons is as high as possible to achieve a high IPCE. Secondly, there should be an appropriate difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the donor and acceptor to achieve good exciton dissociation. Thirdly, the hole mobility of the polymer donor should be balanced with the electron mobility of the non-fullerene acceptor. Lastly, the polymer donor ought to have better crystallization than the acceptor and in this case, the morphology would be fine for forming a favorable phase separation, giving a better performance. Much ink has been spilled about polymer donor materials based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), which serves as a D-unit in a polymer donor, and copolymerization with several different A-units respectively, such as PBDB-T, PM6, PBDT-ODZ, or FTAZetc. on account of their high performance and easy synthesis. There is another structure called dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT), which has a larger conjugate plane and conjugate length, and would have better π–π stacking, a higher mobility rate, broader absorptions, and thus a better photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, polymer donors based on DTBDT have received less attention than BDT. Also, the efficiencies of DTBDT-based polymer donors are not as high as those of BDT-based polymers. The best performance of a DTBDT-based polymer is PDBT-T1, which was reported by Sun and Zhan. The PCE of the device achieved 10.3% with PDBT-T1 as donor and IDIC as acceptor. In view of the tremendous potential, there are still high values worth exploring for DTBDT-based polymer donors.

Herein, we design and synthesize a new structure based on DTBDT called PDBT-F (see Fig. 1b). In this work, we introduce two fluorine atoms onto the conjugated thiophene side group based on DTBDT. On the basis of research, because of their strong electronegativity, fluorine atoms can effectively tune the energy level of the polymers simultaneously without changing the bandgap. Specifically, compared to PDBT-T1, due to its strong electron-withdrawing ability, fluorine atoms would induce a deeper energy level in the polymer which would thus be of benefit in having a higher Voc. In addition, there is a relatively strong hydrogen bond between the fluorine atom and the hydrogen atom, which promotes the planarity of the molecule to form tighter π–π stacking, facilitates exciton diffusion and thus boost carrier mobility and enhance the Jsc. Moreover, the fluorine atoms can also affect the aggregation morphologies because they change the solubility of the polymers by adding interchain interactions. As expected, the polymer PDBT-F exhibits good performance with non-fullerene acceptors, with a PCE of 11.02% which surpasses that of PDBT-T1. Specifically, the Voc and Jsc of PDBT-F/IDIC are enhanced to 0.87 V and 17.65 mA cm−2 respectively compared to PDBT-T1/IDIC. Additionally, to gain a broader range of solar energy and further boost the performance of the device, we introduced the fullerene acceptor PC71BM as the third component to fabricate a ternary solar cell. Increasing the concentration of PC71BM from 0% to 10% also elevates the Voc and Jsc to 0.89 V and 18.69 mA cm−2 respectively with a PCE of 11.86%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance for DTBDT-based polymer solar cells.

The synthesis route of polymer PDBT-F is shown in Scheme 1. The detailed procedures of the experiments are shown in Fig. S1. The NMR spectra and data can also be found in ESI. The polymer PDBT-F was synthesized by a Pd-catalyzed Stille-coupling reaction. PDBT-F exhibits moderate solubility in toluene and chlorobenzene (CB), but good solubility in chloroform (CF) at room temperature. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) are 93.0 K and 141.5 K respectively with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.52. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to measure the thermal stability of the produced materials (see Fig. S2 in ESI). The polymer PDBT-F displays fair thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) at 350 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was also employed to demonstrate that there is no thermal transition (see Fig. S3).



Fig. 1c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of polymer PDBT-F and state-of-the-art NFAs and PC71BM films. The absorption spectra of the polymer in diluted chloroform is also illustrated in Fig. S4. The polymer PDBT-F exhibits a broadened absorption in the range of 300–700 nm in neat films with the maximum absorptions located at 578 nm and 623 nm, which have a slight red-shift compared to absorption in solution. The shoulder peak indicates that there are strong π–π stackings and ordered aggregations in the PDBT-F neat film. The absorption edge locates at 692 nm with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.81 eV which is similar to that of PDBT-T1 of 1.84 eV. This proves that the introduction of fluorine atoms does not affect the bandgap much by deepening the HOMO and LUMO simultaneously. Besides, the absorption of the donor and several acceptors are complementary to each other, which can make full use of solar energy in 400–700 nm. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to determine the onset oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer and then to calculate the energy levels (as seen in Fig. S7). According to Fig. S7, the onset oxidation potential and onset reduction potential are 0.68 eV and −1.14 eV. The HOMO and LUMO levels are −5.39 eV and −3.57 eV, respectively according to the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.71) (eV) when the bandgap is 1.82 eV, which is consistent with the bandgap calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra. The HOMO and LUMO levels are both deepened by the electron-withdrawal (from −5.36 to −5.39 eV for the HOMO level and from −3.43 to 3.57 eV for the LUMO level), which would promote a relatively high Voc.

Later, we fabricated devices based on PDBT-F and a non-fullerene acceptor (IT-M or IDIC), respectively. The device structure is indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PDBT-F:acceptor/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. Table 1 summarizes the data of devices based on the active layer with PDBT-F as the donor, and IDIC or IT-M as the acceptor. Fig. 2a also demonstrates the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices mentioned above. The device based on PDBT-F/IT-M shows a PCE of 10.52% with a Voc (0.97), Jsc (17.02) and fill factor (63.7%) in the ratio of 0.5% DIO. The high Voc is attributed to the relatively shallow LUMO of IT-M (−3.91 eV). It is worth mentioning that the Eloss, which is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVoc where Eg is the lower optical band gap between the donor and the acceptor, is 0.63 eV, which is smaller than for most reported PSCs. The best performance happened when PDBT-F and IDIC serve as an active layer. Compared to the as-cast device, the device based on PDBT-F/IDIC with 0.25% DIO shows the best performance with a PCE of 11.02% and a high fill factor (71.50%). Continuing to increase the concentration of DIO would decrease the Voc and FF slightly. Notably, this is the best device performance based on DTBDT, which admittedly is lower than for the donor based on BDT. Whereas there is still some room for improvement in PCE if we further invest in more research.

Well, in view of the absorption of PDBT-F/IDIC focus on 400–800 nm, which neglects solar energy whose wavelength is shorter than 350 nm. In this case, it is a wise option to fabricate a ternary device by introducing a fullerene acceptor into the active layer to establish a complementary absorption in the range of 200–800 nm. Hence, the UV-vis absorption of a ternary blend consisting of PDBT-F, IDIC and PC71BM was detected. It is clear from Fig. 2b that with the content of PC71BM increasing, the absorption in the range of 300–500 nm rises while in the range 650–800 it drops, corresponding to the absorption of PC71BM and IDIC. Also, the LUMO level of PC71BM (−3.85 eV) is higher than that of IDIC, indicating that the introduction of PC71BM would benefit the Voc of the device. In view of this, we further fabricated a device with structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT-F:IDIC:PC71BM/PDINO/Al to investigate the influence of different contents of PC71BM on the photovoltaic performance. The current density–voltage curves of the ternary devices are shown in Fig. 2c. As expected from Table 2, introducing PC71BM into the PDBT-F:IDIC blend can significantly elevate the Jsc, which is attributed to the introduction of PC71BM, which helps extend a wider absorption compared to the binary blend. Notably, it obtains the best photovoltaic performance when the content of PC71BM in the ternary blend reaches 10%, which exhibits a PCE of 11.86% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 18.69 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70.88%. The Voc of 0.89 V is thanks to the higher LUMO level of PC71BM, while the fill factor does not decrease much. Admittedly, introducing 20% PC71BM into the ternary blend can increase Jsc from 18.69 mA cm−2 to 19.41 mA cm−2. Nevertheless, the FF drops sharply from 70.88% to 64.53%, and thus the PCE decreases to 11.08%. Further increasing the content of PC71BM can raise the Voc while the Jsc, due to a relatively weak absorption in 500–800 nm, shows a tendency to decrease.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was also used to investigate the impact of the introduction of PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 2d, when the content of PC71BM increases from 20% to 100%, the spectral range from 650 to 800 nm obviously drops, which almost accords with the UV-vis absorption spectra of ternary blends. But when the contents of PC71BM are 10% and 20%, the EQE increases not only in the 300–500 range, which represents the absorption of PC71BM, but also increases beyond 550 nm, which could be explained by the introduction of a small amount of PC71BM being able to optimize the exciton dissociation between PDBT-F and IDIC.
To gain a better understanding of the charge-recombination mechanism, we investigated the relationship between Jsc and the illumination intensity (Plight) which could be generalized into a power law:Jsc ∝ PlightS, where S is a factor which is theoretically expected to be close to 1, so as to have fewer charge-recombinations. Fig. 3a illustrates that the fitted S values for the ternary blends are 0.958, 0.964, 1.029, 1.037, 1.036 for 0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 100% of PC71BM, respectively. All the S values are close to 1 while the optimized contents of PC71BM are 10% and 20%, which are consistent with the performances of the devices. In addition, we made further inquiry into photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff). Jph equals Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight is the photogenerated current density under 100 mW cm−2 and Jdark is the dark current density. Veff equals V0 − Vbias, where V0 is defined as the voltage when Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied voltage. The exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) could be described from the ratio of Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation current density, which is equal to Jsc when Veff ≥ 2.0 V. The Jph values for ternary devices can be calculated from Fig. 3b and are 18.27, 19.75, 18.97, 15.26, 11.83 mA cm−2, respectively. P(E, T) of the ternary devices equal to Jph/Jsat are 0.966, 0.997, 0.978, 0.950, 0.937, respectively, which are consistent with the PCEs of the ternary devices. The large values of P(E, T) indicate that there are good charge collections and extractions.
To measure the carrier mobilities of the binary and ternary devices, we used the space charge limited current (SCLC) method and fabricated hole-only and electron-only devices. The structures are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag for hole-only devices and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al for electron-only devices. The carrier mobilities, which were calculated from the equation , are shown in Fig. 3c. The J curves are shown in Fig. S5, S6 in ESI. The hole mobility and electron mobility are both decreased (from 2.34 × 10−4 to 6.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 for hole mobility, from 3.71 × 10−4 to 8.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1 for electron mobility) when the content of PC71BM increases. And the ratios of μe/μh, which refers to the balance of charge transport, are 1.58, 1.47, 1.49, 2.34, 1.37 for ternary devices with different contents of PC71BM. When the content of PC71BM in the blend increases from 0% to 20%, the charge transports for holes and electrons are balanced. Further increasing the content of PC71BM to 50% or more would make them unbalanced, thus impacting the performance of the devices.
Moreover, we had photoluminescence (PL) spectra measurements to confirm whether the energy transfer behavior exists in ternary blends. Fig. 3d demonstrates the PL spectrum of the pure and blended films. The pure film of PDBT-F exhibits PL emission spectra in the range of 650–800 nm with a peak at 690 nm (excited at 600 nm), and for IDIC in the range of 750–850 nm with a peak at 760 nm (excited at 710 nm). For the blended films when excited at 600 nm, the emissions of PDBT-F are almost quenched while the emissions of IDIC emerge (except for 100% PC71BM). This proves that there are effective energy transfers between PDBT-F and IDIC or PC71BM. It is worth noting that in general, when the content of PC71BM increases, the value of E760/E690 (the ratio of PL intensity at 760 nm and 690 nm) should have decreased because of the energy transfer between PDBT-F and PC71BM. Whereas the values of E760/E690 for 10% and 20% blends are relatively higher than those of 0% (see inset in Fig. 3d). By the way, we also measured the PL spectra of IDIC:PC71BM blended film (see Fig. S7). Partial quenching of the emission at 760 nm is observed when excited at 710 nm, which means there is an energy transfer between IDIC and PC71BM so that part of the excitons generated in IDIC could be separated into free charges and transferred to PC71BM. This could be answered by the LUMO level of PC71BM (−3.85 eV) which locates in the middle of PDBT-F (−3.57 eV) and IDIC (−3.91 eV). So, the configuration of orbitals makes it easier to have an effective electron transfer from PDBT-F and IDIC. In this case, the introduction of PC71BM can not only extend the absorption of the active layer, but also facilitate the energy transfer and charge transfer between PDBT-F and IDIC, thus improving the photovoltaic property.
Atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to detect the surface morphology and phase separation for the ternary blend films. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of all blends is displayed in Fig. 4a–e. When the content of PC71BM increases from 0% to 20%, the RMS of the blended films increases. Then the RMS drops when the content of PC71BM increases to 50% or more. In this way, introducing a small amount of PC71BM can influence phase separation to some extent, which has a great connection with the fill factor but no great adverse effect; thus, the PCE could still be improved. Further increasing the content of PC71BM would affect the phase separation and consequently influence the fill factor much more. A blend composed of PDBT-F and PC71BM with a small RMS means there is not such good phase separation as in the ternary blends. Hence, introducing PC71BM could indeed improve the photovoltaic property to a certain extent.

In summary, a novel polymer donor PDBT-F was designed, synthesized and employed as a donor in binary and ternary polymer solar cells. Compared to PDBT-T1, PDBT-F blended with IDIC performed with a relatively higher Voc and Jsc due to the introduction of fluorine atoms, thus giving a deep HOMO level and strong π–π stacking. Different contents of PC71BM were further blended to construct ternary devices, achieving an optimized PCE of 11.86% with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 18.69 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.88%. The introduction of PC71BM can not only contend with the absorption of solar energy, but also boost the Voc, and facilitate the charge transfer and energy transfer between PDBT-F and IDIC, thus improving the photovoltaic properties.
