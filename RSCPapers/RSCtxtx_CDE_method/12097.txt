A series of novel A–D–A structured small molecule photovoltaic (PV) materials [CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2] with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as an electron-withdrawing group were synthesized and characterized. These small molecular donors exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) behavior of the synthesized PV materials and an efficient charge separation was observed by a fluorescence quenching experiment. In addition, their photophysical and electrochemical properties show that they harvest sunlight over the entire visible spectrum range and keep appropriate energy levels to satisfy the requirement of solution-processable OSCs. Therefore, we explored the PV properties of the synthesized donors by fabricating BHJ solar cells with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donors:PC61BM/LiF/Al. Among them, CZ(TDPP)2 revealed a promising performance in PV devices with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.50%, along with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.66 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 4.12 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44, under an illumination of AM 1.5G (80 mW cm−2).

Organic semiconductors for photovoltaic devices have attracted tremendous investigation due to their advantages of easy-synthesis, flexibility, light-weight and large-scale fabrication. For solution-processable bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs), polymers exhibit outstanding PV properties with PCEs over 8%. Meanwhile, in order to overcome the short comings of semiconducting polymers, such as batch-to-batch variation, broad molecular weight distributions and difficult purification, π-conjugated small molecules have become attractive due to their well-defined structure, high purity and reproducibility. Currently, prominent efficiencies with 6–7% have been achieved for small molecule BHJ OSCs. Significantly, Zhou et al. recently reported a record PCE of 7.38% for small molecular donor based OSCs, which demonstrated that small-molecule solar cells are comparable with polymeric counterparts. Therefore, the exploration of novel small molecular semiconductors is of great value for preparing high performance solution-processable OSCs.

To extend the absorption range to longer wavelengths, small molecular PV materials were typically composed of π-bridged electron-donating (D) and electron-withdrawing (A) groups, because ICT transitions in this structure can effectively reduce the molecular band gap. Meanwhile, the energy levels of this push–pull structure are adjustable by incorporating different functional groups. Ideal donors for the active components of BHJ OSCs should possess a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to guarantee a high VOC of the devices, and own a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which is at least 0.3 eV higher than that of the acceptors to form a downhill driving force for electron separation. Rational energy level control of the p-type materials will result in desirable HOMO and LUMO compared with those of PC61BM, a soluble fullerene derivative which has been widely used as an acceptor in OSCs.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole is one exceptional chromophore with a strong fluorescence performance and broad light absorption, as well as possessing excellent photochemical, mechanical, and thermal stability. Consequently, DPP-based materials have been widely investigated for pigments, organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, dye-sensitized solar cells, and so on. Nguyen et al. firstly applied D–A–D-type materials containing DPP as an electron-withdrawing group in BHJ solar cells, achieving an absorption that extended to 820 nm in a film, and a PCE up to 2.3%. Afterward, a series of DPP-based materials were synthesized and utilized as donors or acceptors for OSCs, which obtained a PCE as high as 4.4%. Moreover, Marks and coworkers developed the first A–D–A DPP-based materials, with naphthodithiophene groups at the centre for efficient organic photovoltaics, exhibiting a maximum PCE of 4.1%. Thus, DPP-based materials functionalized with a D–A structure will have an even greater potential in high performance solar cells.
To examine the effect of novel aromatic donor units on the properties of DPP-based molecules, we successfully synthesized a series of A–D–A structured small molecular donors, all of which contain thiophene-ended DPP as an arm and include an alkylated carbazole, diphenylamine, phenothiazine and fluorene centre, respectively (see Scheme 1 for their molecular structures). All these donor units are extensively utilized in polymeric donor materials because of their electron rich structure. These small molecular donors exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents. In addition, their photophysical and electrochemical properties show that they harvest sunlight across the entire visible spectrum range and keep appropriate energy levels to satisfy the requirement of solution-processable OSCs. Therefore, we explored the PV properties of the synthesized donors by fabricating BHJ solar cells with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donors:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The PCEs of the devices based on CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2 are 1.50%, 0.53%, 0.75% and 0.78%, respectively.

The synthetic route for the small molecules is shown in Scheme 2. The Miyaura borylation reactions of the dibromo-substituted centre donating groups and bis(pinacolato)diborane (B2Pin2) were carried out using KOAc as a base and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 as the catalyst in toluene, resulting in compounds D1111–D4444. Afterward, CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2 were prepared by the Pd(PPh3)4-assisted Suzuki coupling reaction in yields of 81%, 81%, 37% and 74%, respectively. The chemical structures of the small molecules were identified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MALDI-TOF HRMS (see ESI for detailed spectra). At room temperature, these synthesized small molecules exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, because of the alkyl groups substituted on the DPP and donor units.


To estimate the ground-state geometries, electronic structures and energies of the frontier orbitals for the small molecules, DFT calculations were accomplished by Gaussian 09 software at the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with a polarized 6-31G(d) basis. The electron-density distributions of the HOMO and LUMO at the optimized ground-state configurations are illustrated in Fig. 1. The DFT calculated HOMO and LUMO values are summarized in Table 1. The theoretical calculation results demonstrated that the electronic density of the HOMO is distributed over the entire molecule, while that of the LUMO is partly migrated to the DPP moieties on the arms, as shown in the Fig. 1. Under the assumption that the long wavelength transitions are predominantly determined by the HOMO–LUMO transition, the excitation leads to an intramolecular charge transfer. When an electron is excited from the HOMO to the LUMO energy level, a charge transfer occurs in all of the small molecules from the centre donating group to the DPP units. Notably, there is a consistent trend between the theoretically calculated energy levels and the experimentally determined maximum absorption wavelength of these molecules in solution (see Fig. 2). This relationship shows that, despite the error in the calculated absolute values, theoretical calculations can serve as a valuable tool to guide the synthesis of future designed materials.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the studied small molecules in chloroform and in film are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) and optical band gaps (Eoptg) are listed in Table 1. The λmax of CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2 in solution were observed at 588 nm, 595 nm, 594 nm and 599 nm, respectively, owing to the ICT transition between the donating and withdrawing groups, while that of compound A was at 560 nm (Fig. 1 in the ESI). The increased λmax of compounds from CZ(TDPP)2 to FL(TDPP)2 indicated an enhanced ICT transition band, resulting in the extension of the absorption spectral range. The thin films exhibited similar absorption spectra to those in solution, but the λmax of the small molecules were red-shifted and the peaks were broadened, suggesting π–π intermolecular interactions in the solid state. For the UV-vis spectra in film, all small molecules displayed strong absorptions, almost covering the entire range of visible light, and presented extrapolated absorption edges from 671 nm for FL(TDPP)2 up to 738 nm for PTZ(TDPP)2.


In order to determine the HOMO and LUMO of the synthesized molecules, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) solution of dichloromethane as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Using the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple as an internal standard, the HOMO energy levels, LUMO energy levels and the electrochemical band gaps (Eecg) of the four molecules were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and onset reduction potentials (Ered) according to the following equations:
HOMO = −(Eox −Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8) eV
LUMO = − (Ered − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8) eV
Eecg = LUMO − HOMO
where
Eox and Ered are the measured onset potentials relative to Ag/Ag+. Eferrocene1/2 = 0.05 V versus Ag/Ag+.

The CV curves of these materials are shown in Fig. 3 and the electrochemical energy levels are summarized in Table 1. On the anodic scan, the four molecules showed onset oxidation potentials of 0.28 V for CZ(TDPP)2, 0.26 V for DPA(TDPP)2, 0.29 V for PTZ(TDPP)2 and 0.41 V for FL(TDPP)2. In contrast, the cathodic scan exhibited onset reduction potentials of −1.43 V for CZ(TDPP)2, −1.42 V for DPA(TDPP)2, −1.41 V for PTZ(TDPP)2 and −1.39 V for FL(TDPP)2. The corresponding band gaps (Ecvg) of the four compounds were estimated to be about 1.71 eV, 1.68 eV, 1.70 eV and 1.80 eV for CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2, respectively. The data imply that the electrochemical band gaps of these compounds were similar, except for FL(TDPP)2, where the Eecg was broader than for the others. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the four molecules showed that they were suitable for donors in solution-processable BHJ solar cells with PC61BM as the acceptor.

According to the DFT calculations and electrochemical properties of the synthesized donor molecules, all the materials have the potential to generate photoinduced charge separation with PC61BM, since their LUMO energy levels were higher than that of PC61BM (−4.3 eV). The differences in the LUMO energy levels was also over 0.3 eV, which is the requirement to guarantee a sufficient driving force for efficient charge separation at the interface of the donor materials and PC61BM. The fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out in order to investigate the photoinduced charge separation process and the characteristics are shown in Fig. 4. The emission maximum peaks of CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2 were revealed at 625 nm, 649 nm, 676 nm and 629 nm, respectively. The fluorescence of the synthesized materials was gradually quenched as the concentration of PC61BM was increased in CHCl3. This phenomenon suggested an efficient photoinduced charge separation process between the synthesized donor molecules and the acceptor material PC61BM. Furthermore, at low quencher concentrations, the dependencies of the fluorescence intensity on the concentration of PC61BM are linear in conformity with the Stern–Volmer equation:
F0/F = 1 + Ksv[C]
where
F0 and F represent the intensity of fluorescence in the absence and presence of PC61BM, respectively, Ksv is the quenching constant, and [C] is the concentration of PC61BM. The Ksv values of CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2 are 2.85 × 103 M−1, 1.90 × 103 M−1, 1.88 × 103 M−1 and 2.02 × 103 M−1, respectively. These values suggest that the photoinduced charge separation process of CZ(TDPP)2 is more efficient than that of the other three materials. In order to understand the photoinduced charge separation better, the mechanism for that of synthesized donor molecules (DSM) with acceptor PCBM (APCBM) was illustrated in ESI.


In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the synthesized donors materials, the bulk-heterojunction PV devices were fabricated with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donors:PC61BM/LiF/Al. Fig. 5 shows the I–V characteristics of the devices under an illumination of AM 1.5G (80 mW cm−2) and the energy levels of the materials utilized in these devices. The short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCEs for all devices are summarized in Table 2.

The PV cells based on CZ(TDPP)2 as the donor exhibited a VOC of 0.66 V, a JSC of 4.12 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.44 and a PCE of 1.50%, while the other three devices, based on DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2, and FL(TDPP)2, presented PCE values of 0.53%, 0.75% and 0.78%, respectively. Under the same conditions, the P3HT-based reference device gave a PCE value of 3.21% (Fig. 2 in ESI). These results are in agreement with the discussion of the photoinduced charge separation process. The relative higher PCE of the device based on CZ(TDPP)2 is due to a more coplanar structure than that of DPA(TDPP)2 and a more π-electron delocalized backbone structure than that of molecules PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2, which demonstrates that the promising PV performance of small molecule solar cells could be obtained through rational molecule design. The preliminary photovoltaic investigation suggests that optimization of the device composition, morphology, and annealing are needed, thus further work is under investigation.

In summary, a series of novel A–D–A-type small molecule PV materials CZ(TDPP)2, DPA(TDPP)2, PTZ(TDPP)2 and FL(TDPP)2 with DPP as an electron-withdrawing group were synthesized and characterized. The DFT calculations demonstrated ICT behavior of the synthesized PV donors and an efficient charge separation was observed by a fluorescence quenching experiment. In addition, their photophysical and electrochemical properties revealed that they harvest sunlight across the entire visible spectrum range and keep appropriate energy levels to satisfy the requirement of solution-processable OSCs. The PV properties of the synthesized donors were investigated by fabricating BHJ solar cells with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donors:PC61BM/LiF/Al. Among them, CZ(TDPP)2 revealed a promising performance in PV devices with a PCE of 1.50%, along with a VOC of 0.66 V, a JSC of 4.12 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.44, which revealed that the promising PV performance of small molecules could be achieved through rational molecule design.


All reagents were obtained commercially and used without further purification unless specified otherwise. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled over Na/benzophenone under nitrogen. All reactions were carried out under an air atmosphere unless otherwise stated. The following compounds were synthesized according to the procedures reported in the literature (see ESI for details): 3,6-dibromo-9-otcylcarbazole, 3,7-dibromo-10-octylphenothiazine,N-hexyl-4,4′-dibromodiphenylamine, 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dihexylfluorene and 3-(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dioctyl-6-thienylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione.



1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained by Bruker AVANCE II 400-MHz spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as the internal standard. High-solution mass spectra (HRMS) were collected using a MALDI Micro MX spectrometer. UV-vis spectra data were recorded on a HP8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature in chloroform using a quartz cuvette as a container. For the thin film spectra, the small molecules were firstly dissolved in chloroform, and then spin-casted on glass slides. Fluorescence spectra and fluorescence quenching experiments were performed on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on a CHI 610D electrochemical workstation from CH Instruments, Inc. In the electrochemical analyses, the redox properties of the molecules were measured in Bu4NBF4/CH2Cl2 solutions. The glass-carbon electrode served as the working electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution of MeCN) and platinum wire were chosen as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple was selected as an internal standard.

Bulk-heterojunction PV devices were fabricated with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donors:PC61BM(1:2, w/w)/LiF/Al. The conductivity of the ITO-coated glass was 20 Ω/□ and it was ultrasonicated in detergent, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, respectively. After being dried with a nitrogen airflow, the ITO substrates were spin-coated with a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VPAI 4083) at 4000 rpm s−1 for 1 min and subsequently baked at 140 °C for 30 min on a hot plate. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating at 800 rpm s−1 for 1 min with the dichlorobenzene solution of the blended small molecules and PC61BM (total concentration of 21 mg mL−1, purchased from Lumtec. Corp.) on the top of ITO/PEDOT:PSS. Finally, LiF (4 nm) and Al (100 nm) layers were deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask, yielding six individual devices with a 0.04 cm2 nominal area. J–V curves were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 80 mW cm−2. A controlled OSC with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al was fabricated and characterized under the same working conditions.
