As an emerging photovoltaic technology, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a great deal of academic and industrial interest due to their reasonably high power conversion efficiency, low material cost and facile fabrication process. Metal-free organic dyes, as one of the key components of DSSCs, play a pivotal role in light harvesting and electron injection. Among the various species of organic dyes, easily tunable 10H-phenothiazine-based dyes hold a large proportion. The electron-rich nitrogen and sulfur atoms render 10H-phenothiazine a stronger donor character than other amines, even better than triphenylamine, tetrahydroquinoline, carbazole and iminodibenzyl. On the other hand, the unique non-planar butterfly conformation of the 10H-phenothiazine ring can sufficiently suppress molecular aggregation and the formation of excimers. The positions N-10, C-3 and C-7 of the 10H-phenothiazine ring system can easily be furnished with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups. Thus, the structural features of 10H-phenothiazine-based dyes guarantee the fabrication of efficient DSSCs. Some 10H-phenothiazine-based dyes show high photovoltaic performance, even better than the commercial ruthenium complex (N719). This paper reviews the recent significant scientific progress in 10H-phenothiazine-based DSSCs and focuses especially on the relationship between the molecular structure and the photoelectric conversion properties.

As an emerging photovoltaic technology, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), so-called Grätzel cells, have attracted a great deal of academic and industrial interest due to their low material cost, facile fabrication process and reasonably high power conversion efficiency.

Metal-free organic dyes, as one of the key components of DSSCs, play a pivotal role in light harvesting and electron injection. Among the various species of organic dyes, 10H-phenothiazine-based dyes hold a large proportion due to their easily tunable structures, low cost and low environmental pollution. They were first applied in DSSCs by Sun et al. in 2007.
The electron-rich nitrogen and sulfur atoms render 10H-phenothiazine stronger electron donor character than other amines, even better than triphenylamine, tetrahydroquinoline, carbazole, iminodibenzyl and many other N-heterocycles. However, 10H-phenothiazine itself is a colorless compound with an absorption maximum at 316 nm in CH2Cl2. Attachment of an electron-acceptor group, for example, a 2-carboxy-2-cyano-vinyl group (2-cyanoacrylic acid group) at C-3 leads to a conjugated donor–acceptor system (D–π–A) 1, which exhibits a charge-transfer (CT) band in the range of visible light. Moreover, the carboxy group serves as an anchor group for adsorption on nanocrystalline TiO2 as a semiconductor (Fig. 1). The perpendicular arrangement of the dye molecules 1 in their monomolecular layer on the TiO2 surface is very favorable, because an easy electron transfer from the 2-cyanoacrylic acid unit to TiO2 can take place, and on the contrary, the back-transfer of an electron from the semiconductor to the remote phenothiazine moiety is difficult. Thus, the unwanted charge recombination is suppressed significantly. Hence, phenothiazine derivatives of general structure 1 have become widely used dyes (sensitizers) for DSSCs.
Apart from alkyl, aryl or aralkyl substituents on N-10, predominantly substituents on C-7 were introduced for the tuning of the photophysical and electrochemical properties, but compounds with additional substituents in other positions were studied as well. The conjugation and/or the electron density on the donor side can be enhanced by introducing (in the 7-position) a suitable substituent (D′–D–π–A). The conjugation on the acceptor side can also be extended by introducing styryl, aromatic or heteroaromatic units between the phenothiazine ring system and the 2-carboxy-2-cyano-vinyl group (D–π–π–A). Both strategies are realized in (D′–D–π–π–A)-systems. Moreover, sensitizers that contain two or more phenothiazine substructures and/or two or more 2-cyanoacrylic acid groups have been investigated. Other electron acceptors have been studied with limited success.

10H-Phenothiazine (2), the parent compound, is a cheap starting material, which is prepared in a technical synthesis by the reaction of diphenylamine and sulfur. It can be easily alkylated or Cu- or Pd-catalyzed arylated on N-10. Electrophilic substitution reactions occur in 3- and 7-positions of the benzene rings. Formylation and bromination in these positions are the most important processes. A lot of 3-(10-alkyl-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)-2-cyano-acrylic acids have been obtained by N-alkylation, formylation on C-3 and subsequent Knoevenagel condensation of the aldehyde and 2-cyanoacetic acid (Fig. 2). (E)-Configurations were postulated in all known examples. An exact proof of the stereoselectivity can be achieved by the measurement of the coupling constants 3J(1H,13C) of the olefinic hydrogen atom with the COOH and CN groups or by the heteronuclear Overhauser effects (HNO) between these substituents and the olefinic H.

A typical reaction sequence is shown for 2 → 1e in Scheme 1. Phenothiazine (2) and 1-bromooctane gave a high yield of 3, which was subjected to a Vilsmeier–Haack formylation to aldehyde 4. Then, a Knoevenagel condensation yielded the target system 1e. Instead of cyanoacetic acid, its t-butyl ester was used under hydrolytic conditions.
An example of a D′–D–π–A system, in which further donor groups are attached to the 10H-phenothiazine ring system, is shown in Scheme 2. Cu-catalyzed N-arylation of phenothiazine (2) yielded 5, which was transformed into aldehyde 6. NBS in chloroform gave the bromo-compound 7, which was subjected to a Suzuki coupling to yield 8. Alkylation of the phenolic OH group delivered 9, which in the final step was transformed into dye 10 by a Knoevenagel condensation.
Finally, the preparation of 16, which has an extended π-system between the phenothiazine donor and the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, shall be discussed here. A typical reaction sequence is shown in Scheme 3. 2-Methyl-phenothiazine (11) was first butylated to 12. Vilsmeier–Haack formylation yielded aldehyde 13, which gave 14 by a Wittig–Horner reaction. A second Vilsmeier–Haack reaction led to aldehyde 15, which then rendered in a Knoevenagel condensation the target compound 16. All five steps gave high yields, so that the total yield amounted to 50–52%.
Altogether more than 150 10H-phenothiazine derivatives have been synthesized by reaction sequences analogous to Schemes 1–3 and studied in DSSCs.

Thin films (4–10 μm) of the dye adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 represent the “heart” of the DSSCs. The focus of the present article lies on push–pull systems having 10H-phenothiazine as an electron donor D and 2-cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor A. According to DFT calculations, the energy gain of the adsorption of these dyes on the surface of anatase (101,TiO2) is high. Moreover, the π-conjugation between the donor D and the acceptor A is essential. The photovoltaic efficiency is much lower, when the conjugation is interrupted or impaired – for example, when the acceptor is fixed on a N-1,4-phenylene segment. It is favorable that the carboxy group, which serves as an anchor group for the adsorption on TiO2, is a part of the acceptor A, because the electron transition from the dye to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor TiO2 starts at the acceptor group, which has a negative partial charge in the excited state S1 (ICT state).

Light shines through the transparent anode and is absorbed by the dye. The sunlight ranges from the near UV (UV-A) to the infrared. Therefore, it is important to have dyes with a broad and intense absorption, up to the NIR region, where the absorbed photons become less efficient. Unsubstituted 10H-phenothiazine has absorption maxima at 355 nm and 316 nm (CH2Cl2). The introduction of an electron acceptor group on C-3 leads to an absorption of the push–pull system in the visible region. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectrum of (E)-3-(10-octyl-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)-2-cyano-acrylic acid (1e) measured in DCM/THF (1:1).
Compound 1e shall serve here as an example of a phenothiazine-based DSSC. The long-wavelength absorption (charge transfer band) of 1e has a maximum at λmax = 439 nm (Fig. 3). The compound exhibits a strong fluorescence F (Fig. 3). When adsorbed on TiO2, a significant broadening of the absorption occurs, which is caused by interactions of neighboring dye molecules (Fig. 4). Its long-wavelength tail ends then at about 650 nm. The deviation from the line A = 0 in the range of λ ≥ 700 nm in Fig. 4 is due to some light scattering. The absorption of the adsorbed dye 1e is not really panchromatic; however, much more photons of the daylight are absorbed than in solution, when the amount of dye loaded on TiO2 is compared to the corresponding concentration in solution. A strong optical response that reaches from the UV to the NIR region is an important feature of DSSCs. To cover the whole absorption area, phenothiazines can be mixed with other sensitizers.
The HOMO → LUMO transition is forbidden for simple push–pull systems 1. According to a DFT B3LYP/6-31G calculation of 1b, the charge transfer band is composed of the HOMO−1 → LUMO transition as the major component and the HOMO → LUMO+1 transition as the minor component. The orbitals HOMO, HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 are largely localized at the 10H-phenothiazine unit, whereas the LUMO is located on the 2-cyanoacrylic acid group (see also Fig. 6).
The ground state So of 10H-phenothiazines is non-planar. It has a tilt angle of the benzene ring planes of about 40°. The electronic excitation leads to a Franck–Condon state, which relaxes fast to S1, which is more planar (tilt angle of about 20°). The “butterfly” conformations hinder the formation of ground-state aggregates and excimers. Normally, such aggregates favor the internal conversion (IC) and are therefore unfavorable for photovoltaic applications.

Fig. 5 shows the working mode of an n-type solar cell sensitized by a donor–acceptor dye (D–π–A) such as 1e. Light, which shines through the transparent anode, is absorbed by the dye, which is adsorbed on a thin film of the nanocrystalline semiconductor TiO2. The generated excited singlet state S1 is characterized by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor unit to the acceptor unit. The transfer of an electron from the LUMO of the exciton to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor accomplishes the charge separation. Internal conversion (IC), particularly efficient in aggregates, fluorescence (F) and possible photoreactions of the excited state [D–π–A]*–TiO2 are competitive processes. In particular, irreversible photoreactions would deteriorate dramatically the DSSC. However, photoreactions and photocatalytic decompositions of the 10H-phenothiazine ring system in the daylight can be excluded and even E ⇄ Z photo-isomerization reactions of the olefinic double bond of 1 can be neglected. Accordingly, an efficient charge separation can take place. An impressive proof for this statement is provided by the fluorescence lifetime of 1a, which is reduced from τ = 0.99 ns in acetonitrile to 0.21 ns for 1a adsorbed on TiO2.
The electron transfer to the anode generates a dye cation [D–π–A]+, which has to be reduced to recover the dye. Iodine species 3I−/I3− are commonly regarded as redox couples although redox steps of the sequence 2I− ⇄ I2− + e ⇄ I2 + 2e seem to predominate. Iodine-free redox couples were seldom applied.
The redox system is present in the electrolyte, which infiltrates the mesoporous TiO2. A continuous regeneration of the dye requires a continuous regeneration of the redox system. This is ensured by the external circuit, which provides an electron transition from the cathode to I3−. A direct electron transfer from TiO2− to I3− impairs the DSSC (internal short-circuit, dark current).

Fig. 6 shows the energetic preconditions of the working mode of DSSC using 1e as the dye. Irrespective of the forbidden HOMO–LUMO transition, the LUMO is filled with electrons, which are then injected into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The injection as well as the regeneration of the dye 1e by the redox couple I−/I3− are exergonic processes (ΔG < 0) with certain activation barriers. Cyclovoltammetry was used to determine the ground-state oxidation potential of the dye (sensitizer). The energy gap E0–0, obtained by the intersection of absorption and fluorescence bands, is therefore used for the determination of the excited-state oxidation potential. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding values for 1e as a sensitizer. A too high lying HOMO (close to 0.42 V) or a too low lying LUMO (close to −0.5 V) of the dye would slow down and finally prevent the electron transfers. A difference of about 0.2 V seems to be sufficient to overcome the activation barriers.
DSSCs are usually investigated under sun simulator conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) as a function of the wavelength is depicted in Fig. 7. It shows values of over 50% in the range 400 nm < λ < 500 nm. The tailing to long wavelengths corresponds to the tailing of the absorption spectrum.
The overall efficiency of the 1e-based DSSC is characterized by the plot of the current density versus the voltage (Fig. 8). The solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) is obtained using the following equation,
where
Jsc describes the short-circuit current (V = 0) and Voc the open-circuit voltage (current density = 0). The maximum power point (MPP) determines the fill factor (FF). The solar photon flux I0 is related to standard conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).

The photovoltaic performance of the simple phenothiazine 1e is average (PCE = 4.87%, Table 1). How can it be improved? The three arrows in Fig. 8 reveal the three possibilities to enhance η (PCE) by increasing Jsc, Voc or FF. The latter possibility involves a (diagonal) shift of the maximum power point (MPP) in order to adapt area 1 more to area 2.

According to the theory, an ideal DSSC would have a maximum Jsc value of about 35 mA cm−2. It should contain a dye, which exhibits a complete absorption of all photons of the solar simulation (400–900 nm). Moreover, the quantum yield for the electron injection should be ϕ = 1 and charge recombination should not take place (FF = 1). When all competing processes (Fig. 5) can be excluded, the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) is the decisive factor that means the adsorbed dye should have a very broad and intense absorption.
The theoretical maximum of Voc amounts to the difference in the quasi Fermi level (−0.4 V) of the electrons in TiO2 and the potential (+0.42 V) of the redox couple I3−/I− in the electrolyte. Thus, a maximum of Voc ≈ 820 mV can be predicted. Recombination of injected electrons or of I3− and dye cations lowers Voc. The maximum values of Jsc and Voc and an ideal fill factor FF = 1.0 would lead to a maximum PCE of about 29%. The experimentally obtained η values are much lower. Until now the maximum PCE of 10H-phenothiazine-based DSSCs ranges at about 10%.
Variations of the phenothiazine structure 1 include an extension of the donor side (D′–D–π–A) or acceptor side (D–π–π–A) or both (D′–D–π–π–A). The major effects of such tunings consist of an increase of the LHE and alterations of the frontier orbital energies. Table 1 shows the photovoltaic parameters of some typical structure variants 17–19, in comparison to 1e. The increase of the light-to-current efficiencies η corresponds predominantly to the increase of Jsc governed by the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), which is determined by the amount of dye loaded on the TiO2 surface and by its absorption (wavelength range and intensity). The Voc and FF values of 1e and 17–19 differ only slightly.
Impedance measurements can be performed to elucidate the Voc values and their deviation from the mentioned theoretical maximum. We studied in this context the compounds 20–22.
The sensitizers 20 and 21 are D′–D–π–π–A systems, and 22 is a A–π–π–D–π–π–A system.

Fig. 9 shows the impedance spectra (Nyquist plots) of 20–22. Each plot contains a small () and a big (→) semicircle. The small semicircle is attributed to the charge recombination at the counter electrode, while the large semicircle is attributed to the charge recombination TiO2− + [D–π–A]+. Fitting of the curves gave the resistances Rrec of the recombination and the corresponding lifetimes τ of the injected electrons. Low recombination resistance Rrec causes a fast charge recombination and consequently a low lifetime τ of the injected electrons and a low open-circuit voltage Voc. Fig. 10 reveals the parallel behavior of Voc, Rrec and τ.

Table 2 lists the photovoltaic parameters of some simple 10H-phenothiazine-based DSSCs. The values spread significantly – even when the electrolytes with the redox couples are similar or exactly the same. The quality of the TiO2 nanoparticles and their dye loading play an important role. Therefore it would be a mere speculation, when photovoltaic parameters obtained in different laboratories are compared. The large number of sensitizers, compiled in Tables 3–10 of Section 4, provides a survey of the applications of phenothiazine-based dyes; however, reliable statements on the effects of structural variations should be confined to the examples of a specific reference.

Long CnH2n+1 or [CH2–CH2–O]n–CH3 chains can impede the unfavorable aggregation of the dyes and the approach of I3− to the TiO2 surface (dark current).

Since the first study of a 10H-phenothiazine-based DSSC in 2007, a vast number of structural modifications have been investigated with the aim of optimizing the photovoltaic parameters of solar cells. Tables 3–10 display the different types of modified 10H-phenothiazine dyes. All photovoltaic parameters registered in the tables are related to standard conditions (AM1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2).


Table 3 contains dyes 23–45, which have an extended electron donor moiety (D′–D–π–A). Additional electron-donating substituents D′ and/or groups D′, which extend the conjugation on the donor side, strengthen the donor–acceptor character and enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) upon excitation. A strong red-shifted absorption results, which increases the light-harvesting.
Dyes 26b and 26c, obtained by Hua et al., belong to the most effective 10H-phenothiazine-based sensitizers. Their Jsc values are particularly high and amount to about 15 mA cm−2. The corresponding PCE values of more than 8% exceed the commercial standard N719®, a ruthenium complex, which exhibited – under the conditions used – a PCE value of 7.73%. All compounds 26a–26d bear a 4-hexyloxyphenyl group on C-7 and alkyl groups on N-10, but obviously the length of the alkoxy chain has an important influence. 4-Diarylaminophenyl groups, present on C-7 in 29–31, cause a much weaker effect on the photovoltaic parameters.
Various thiophene groups were attached to C-7 of 10H-phenothiazine. An interesting study, published by Wong et al. revealed that increasing the HOMO level of the sensitizer close to 0.4 V renders the electron transfer from I− to the dye cation very difficult. Due to the activation barrier for the regeneration of the dyes, compound 43, which contains four alkoxy substituents on its thiophene rings, has a very low PCE value (Table 3 and Fig. 11). Moreover, an increasing electron density in the donor parts of the dyes 39–43 increases the unfavorable aggregation tendency.
Sensitizers, which have aryl groups as additional electron donors D′ fixed on N-10 are compiled in Table 4. Their PCE values are average. However, when 4-alkoxyphenyl groups are fixed on N-10 and C-7, the corresponding PCE values can become very high. Sensitizer 54 has a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of 9.98%, which represents the maximum of all up to now investigated phenothiazine-based DSSCs. Its short-circuit current is extremely high and its open-circuit voltage reaches the theoretical maximum.
Dye 47 has the same high Voc value, but the loading amount of this dye on the TiO2 surface is very limited. Therefore its Jsc value of 9.23 mA cm−2 and its PCE value of 5.74% are relatively low. The comparison of the sensitizers 46b–46d in Table 4 with the sensitizers 26b–26d in Table 3 reveals that identical substituents D′ fixed on N-10 or on C-7 give much better results for the C-7 derivatives. The same statement can be made for the comparison of 48 and 49 to 45 and 38, respectively.
The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs based on the dyes 57–84, which have an extended conjugated linker between 10H-phenothiazine as the donor D and 2-cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor A, are summarized in Table 5.
The PCE values of the D–π–π–A systems lie between 1.42 and 7.0%. Remarkably low (≤2.01%) solar-to-electric power conversions were measured for the sensitizers 58, 64, 71 and 82. In all four cases, the Jsc values were below 6.0 mA cm−2. Several factors are responsible for this result.
Ni et al. found that for example sensitizer 82 has a high dye density on TiO2 (0.22 μmol cm−2), but provokes a strong dark current and a slow dye regeneration, caused by the high-lying HOMO. Accordingly a reduced power conversion was observed. Slow electron transport and/or injection in the cell appear to be a further reason for the inefficient PCE.
The sensitizers 16 and 85–97, compiled in Table 6, contain extended linkers and additional electron donor units D′. Apart from alkylthio, 4-alkoxyphenyl, 4-diphenylaminophenyl, aryl and thienyl groups – like in the D′–D–π–A systems of Table 3, N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl groups were used as D′. The extended linkers contain predominantly the same building blocks as the sensitizers in Table 5. Recently, Kim and coworkers incorporated squaraine and indolium segments in the linker of compound 85. Although 85, absorbed on TiO2, exhibits a panchromatic absorption between 400 and 850 nm, its PCE value of 0.9% is extremely low. Two major reasons have to be specified, namely the aggregation of this dye and the low-lying LUMO at −0.74 V, which effects a difficult and slow electron injection in the conduction band of TiO2. Moreover, we think, that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is weak, since the central squaraine unit has large orbital coefficients in the HOMO and the LUMO. Kim and coworkers studied also some sensitizers, in which the 5-carboxy-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indolium building block represents the anchor and together with the squaraine segment the electron acceptor. On the whole, the PCE values of the D′–D–π–π–A systems are average to low; the simple compound 16 is the only exception.
Sensitizers with two or three phenothiazine building blocks D and one 2-cyanoacrylic acid group A are compiled in Table 7. Until now two different types of structures have been investigated, namely (Dn′)Dn–π–A (n = 2, 3), realized in the sensitizers 98–102, and D2D′–π–A, realized in the sensitizers 103–107. Each 10H-phenothiazine donor D can bear in the first type a further electron donor D′. Triphenylamine serves in the second type as donor D′, which carries two 10H-phenothiazin-10-yl groups D.
The comparisons 98/1d (Table 2)/100 and 99/46b (Table 4)/101 reveal a non-uniform effect of the number of 10H-phenothiazine units on the PCE values. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy elucidated the situation more precisely.Fig. 12 shows Nyquist plots of 102, 37 (Table 3) and standard N719®.Voc can be regarded as a function of lnωmax−1, whereby ωmax represents the frequency at the maximum imaginary resistance of the Nyquist plot. The open-circuit voltage increases in the order Voc(N719) < Voc(37) < Voc(102) because of a reduced charge recombination tendency (higher charge recombination resistance, lower dark current). However, the PCE values have the opposite order:

Obviously, the performance of the DSSCs is predominated by the short-circuit current Jsc, which is determined by the light harvesting, and by the fill factor FF.
The dyes 22 and 108–118 listed in Table 8 have the opposite structure design; one 10H-phenothiazine electron donor unit is connected to two 2-cyanoacryl acid units as electron acceptor and anchor groups. The linkers contain thiophene, 1,3-thiazole or boradiazaindacene building blocks. Bidentate anchors promise an efficient electron injection.
The PCE values of the sensitizers listed in Table 8 are on an average higher than the PCE values in Table 7. Two anchor groups guarantee in many cases a high loading of the dye and fast electron injections. A very good solar cell performance was reported by Lin and coauthors for the sensitizer 116. Its PCE value of 8.32% outperforms that of the standard N719® by 13%. Compound 116 has an allowed HOMO → LUMO transition and its intense charge-transfer band guarantees a good light harvesting. Consequently a high short circuit current Jsc of 16.23 mA cm−2 could be measured. The HOMO of 116 is centered, as usual, at the 10H-phenothiazine unit and the LUMO has high and symmetrically arranged coefficients at the 2-cyanoacrylic acid groups in the two linkers. Accordingly, the electron injection can occur on both anchors.

Table 9 summarizes the photovoltaic data of sensitizers which contain two or three 10H-phenothiazine electron donor units D and two or three 2-cyanoacrylic acid groups as electron acceptors. Pairs of D–π(–π)–A building blocks represent in most cases terminal functionalities on a saturated chain or a saturated center C: 119–129. Aromatic centers present in compounds 130–133 are responsible for the special molecular architecture of the sensitizers.
The PCE values of the cells containing these dyes are average with exception of compound 132, which has a very low solar-to-electric power conversion of 1.5%. An interrupted electron transfer pathway was assumed for this cruciform molecule.
Recently, a fourfold system C(D–π–A)4 was investigated, in which a porphine (or its complexes) served as center C.
Finally, two compounds, which have a related structure concept of two electron donor units connected to two 2-cyanoacrylic acid groups as electron acceptors, shall be mentioned here. 10H-Phenothiazine represents one donor moiety in dye 135 and 136, the other donor unit is a tertiary amine.
Some poly(phenothiazine–triphenylamine)s were also applied as sensitizers for DSSCs. The 2-cyanoacrylic acid groups were attached in the side chains of the polymers. The highest PCE value (4.7%) was observed for polymer 137 with unsubstituted thiophene rings (R = H).
A comparison of sensitizers with 2-cyanoacrylic acid groups A to the corresponding sensitizers with other electron acceptor and anchor groups A′ is compiled in Table 10. Rhodamine-3-acetic acid in dyes 138–140 and 143 and 1-hexyl-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indolinium-5-carboxylic acid in 142 gave lower PCE values than the corresponding 2-cyanoacrylic acid systems. Solely pyridinium-1-acetic acid as an acceptor group in 141 gave a better power conversion efficiency than the 2-cyanoacrylic acid derivative 27.

Dye aggregation normally reduces the PCE value of a DSSC, because π-stacked aggregates favor the deactivation of excitons by internal conversion (IC), so that the transformation of light to electrical power is declined. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 144 is a transparent compound, which impairs the formation of dye aggregates. Thus, the electron injection efficiency can be improved, therefore higher Jsc values are obtained. Many phenothiazine dyes were studied with CDCA as an additive.
The following Table 11 shows some successful examples of how very small PCE values can be increased by the presence of CDCA. The increase of the short circuit current density Jsc represents therefore the major effect. Voc and FF are not much affected by the presence of CDCA. However, when aggregation is not the prevailing effect, addition of CDCA can decrease the efficiency, because CDCA is adsorbed on TiO2, therefore reducing dye loading.

The dyes listed in Table 11 contain identical electron donors D′D, but different acceptor groups A and A′, respectively. A comparison of the influence of the acceptor moieties is not possible, because the linker between D and A in 85 differs from the linkers in 145–147. All examples in Table 11 show at least a doubling of the PCE values, when chenodeoxycholic acid is added.
When the absorption of the sensitizer does not cover the whole range of the sunlight, additives would be interesting, which exhibit an intense absorption and can transfer the energy to the sensitizer in the cell according to the Förster or Dexter mechanism. The motto is: sensitizing the sensitizer. Until now, such additives were seldom used.

Solar energy is wide-spread on earth, abundant in many regions, virtually endless and clean. Its transformation into electricity is a special challenge of our time. Dye-sensitized solar cells provide a promising approach to solve this problem. Among many organic dyes studied in this context, 10H-phenothiazines as electron donors connected to an electron acceptor group, such as 2-cyanoacrylic acid, offer the advantages of cheap fabrication, easily tunable structures and environmental safety.

The electronically excited singlet states S1 of these conjugated push–pull systems (D–π–A) are characterized by an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor moiety to the acceptor unit. This initial charge separation is completed by an electron transition from the LUMO of the dyes into the conduction band (CB) of nanocrystalline anatase (TiO2) as an n-semiconductor. The population of the LUMO in the vibrationally relaxed S1 state is guaranteed even when the HOMO → LUMO transition is forbidden. The redox couple I−/I3−, present in the electrolyte, ensures the permanent regeneration of the electroneutral dye (sensitizer).
In the previous decade, various structural modifications of 10H-phenothiazines bearing acceptor groups were studied. Apart from simple D–π–A systems, sensitizers with additional donor groups (D′–D–π–A) and dyes with an extended conjugation (D–π–π–A and D′–D–π–π–A) were studied. In addition sensitizers with more than one 10H-phenothiazine donor and/or more than one acceptor unit were investigated.
After the discussion of the synthesis and the working mode of 10H-phenothiazine-based DSSCs, a survey of the photovoltaic properties of many 10H-phenothiazine sensitizers tested up to now is presented (Tables 1–10). The solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies of these dyes range usually between 3 and 8% under standard conditions. The highest values of about 10% were found for some (D′)2D–π–A systems (Table 4). Further studies of 10H-phenothiazine-based dyes having such structures seem to be highly promising. The efficiencies of these dyes often exceed the efficiency of the commercial standard N719®, a ruthenium complex. Due to their thermal, photochemical and electrochemical stability, the 10H-phenothiazine sensitizers have great potential for future technical applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. The manifold technical applications of conjugated molecules with terminal donor–acceptor substitution find here a new area for research and development.
