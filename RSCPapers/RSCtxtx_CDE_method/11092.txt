We demonstrated the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Ni nanoparticles (NiNPs) on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Our study revealed that NiNPs in a conventional I−/I3− electrolyte (NiNPs@I−/I3−) increased the net optical absorption of a N719 dye over a broad wavelength range by LSPR, and concurrently improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in DSSCs. At an optimized concentration of the NiNPs@I−/I3− electrolyte (1 mg mL−1), N719-sensitized DSSCs with a photoanode thickness of ca. 2, 5, and 10 μm, exhibited net PCEs of 2.32, 6.02, and 9.83%, respectively. These efficiencies were consistent with a net improvement of 43.2, 20.4, and 12.7%, respectively and were mainly attributed to a significant enhancement of the short circuit current density (Jsc) by the LSPR from the NiNPs. Similar effects were observed for cells sensitized by the N3, Ru505, and Z907 dyes. Furthermore, the NiNPs exhibited excellent resistance to corrosion from a conventional I−/I3− electrolyte over a period of 60 days.

Over the last two decades, there has been an enormous increasing interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their high power-conversion efficiency (PCE), low material costs, and easy fabrication processes. In recent years, the development of new dyes has led to the continuous enhancement of the PCE in DSSCs. Unfortunately, the PCE in DSSC is still limited by the weak absorption of the novel dyes. Thus, the enhancement of light absorption efficiency of dyes over a wide wavelength range is one of the main challenges in increasing the PCE in DSSCs. The novel design of a tandem structure, sequential dye adsorption on TiO2 nanoparticles, and the introduction of energy-relay dyes (ERDs) have been used to improve the light absorption efficiency of the cells in a wide wavelength range. Recently, we have demonstrated that the application of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Hoechst 33342 (H33342) as ERDs can enhance the PCEs substantially via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and radiative energy transfer (RET).

Common strategies employed to overcome poor light absorption, and to improve carrier collection efficiency, include the use of thick photoanodes, scattering layers, back reflectors, co-sensitizers, and one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures. However, quite often, many of these strategies do not give the expected results. For example, increasing the thickness of the TiO2 photoelectrode, or changing the anisotropic nanostructure of TiO2 (e.g. nanotube, nanorod, nanofiber, etc.) does not often increase the PCE linearly. Therefore, improving the light harvesting efficiency in a wide wavelength range and the charge collection efficiency of DSSCs without affecting other factors are considered prospective strategies to enhance device performance.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) from metallic nanostructures can significantly increase the net absorption of dyes to enhance the PCE of DSSCs. Metallic nanoparticles were designed as subwavelength scattering elements to trap the freely propagating light waves through a dye-loaded TiO2 mesoporous network, via a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mode, or as a subwavelength antenna in which the plasmonic near-field is coupled with the dye/TiO2 interface. The biggest challenge for the development of stable SPR-induced high-performance liquid-electrolyte-type DSSCs is the protection of metallic nanoparticles (e.g. Au and Ag) from fast corrosion by iodide (I−)/tri-iodide (I3−) redox couples in a conventional electrolyte system. Consequently, several strategies with corrosion resistant core–shell plasmonic nanostructures such as Au@SiO2, Ag@SiO2, and Ag@TiO2, have been demonstrated. These core–shell type nanostructures were however only effective in leading the enhancement of light absorption by the SPR mode over a limited wavelength range (400–550 nm). Meanwhile, ionic liquid protective layer-based Ag nanoparticles, Ag2S-encapsulated Au nanorods (AuNR@Ag2S), and popcorn-shaped Au–Ag alloy core–shell nanoparticles were successfully introduced to enhance light absorption over a broadband region by SPR. On the other hand, the core–shell Ag@SiO2 nanoprisms enhanced the SPR effect over both broadband and narrowband regions. However, the synthesis and fabrication of most of these plasmonic nanostructures are quite complicated, and the porosity of the insulating shell layer often deteriorates the SPR effect with aging by corrosion. Furthermore, the insulating nature of the SiO2 layer of Au@SiO2 and Ag@SiO2 is partly responsible for the loss of the photogenerated carriers from the dye molecules, due to the inefficient electron injection into the conduction band of SiO2 (CBSiO2). Therefore, the investigation of other metallic nanostructures that are stable in an I−/I3− electrolyte, easy to fabricate, and help to increase dye absorption over a wide wavelength range via the SPR mode are desirable for the development of high-efficiency DSSCs.
A number of reports have explained the SPR behavior of nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs) on SiO2, ITO glass substrates, and BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices. The absorption spectra of NiNPs on SiO2 surfaces and BaTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices exhibited much broader SPR bands (i.e. intraband free electron excitation) than those of the Au and Ag nanoparticles. The application of NiNPs in DSSCs to enhance dye absorption via the SPR mode over a broad wavelength range was hardly investigated. On the other hand, it is well known that NiNPs are highly resistant to corrosion from KI salts containing 1 M H2SO4, and even from highly concentrated acidic media. Moreover, various NiNP composites, including NiNPs/carbon nanotubes and NiNPs/graphene, have been used as an efficient and stable counter electrode for I−/I3−-based DSSCs.
The present study demonstrates the application of NiNPs as subwavelength scattering elements by LSPR mode, to design high-performance I−/I3−-based liquid-type DSSCs, sensitized by the N719 dye, as shown in Scheme 1. The strong optical absorption of NiNPs over a wide wavelength range is highly advantageous to enhance the net absorption of the dye, induced by LSPR, over a wide wavelength range. The highly stable and corrosion resistant electrolyte, based on the dispersion of NiNPs in an I−/I3− redox mediator (NiNPs@I−/I3−), significantly enhanced the net absorption of N719 via LSPR, thereby improving the overall PCE of the DSSCs. A similar behavior was also observed for DSSCs sensitized by other well-known dyes, such as cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) (N3), cis-dicyano-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (Ru505), and cis-diisothiocyanato-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dinonyl) ruthenium(II) (Z907).

0.25 M NaBH4 and 0.025 M NaOH were added to a 20 mL solution of 0.25 M NiSO4 (aq) (Safety note: as soon as the NaBH4was added to the NiSO4solution, a vigorous reaction with gas evolution occurred). The solution mixture was allowed to stand for 24 h to ensure that the reaction was complete. The NiNP precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C. The final product was stored in an airtight vial for further use.

Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (Pilkington TEC Glass-TEC 8, Solar, 2.3 mm thickness) were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then rinsed with water and ethanol. The FTO glass plates were immersed in TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 layers on the FTO glass plates were prepared by screen printing the TiO2 paste (TTPH-20N, ENBKOREA Co., Ltd, Korea, particle size 20 nm) and then drying at 120 °C. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 350, 375, 450, and 500 °C for 5, 5, 15, and 15 min, respectively. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 layers were ca. 2, 5, and 10 μm, which were measured by using a surface profilometer (Accretech, surfcom 130A, Japan).
The sintered TiO2 photoelectrodes were dipped into the 0.4 mM ethanolic solution of cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, Solaronix SA), cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) (N3, Solaronix SA), cis-dicyano-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (Ru505, Solaronix SA), and cis-diisothiocyanato-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dinonyl) ruthenium(II) (Z907, Solaronix SA), separately for 18 h. The counter electrodes (CEs) were prepared by spin coating of 5 mM ethanolic solution of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) on FTO and sintered in an electric muffle furnace at 380 °C for 20 min. The dye-loaded photoelectrodes (active area ca. 0.25 cm2) and platinized CEs were sandwiched with a 60 μm thick surlyn film as a spacer and sealing agent. The liquid-type electrolyte with/without NiNPs was injected directly into the cells through the drilled holes at the CEs and the holes were sealed with a cover glass using surlyn.
The morphology, structure, elemental analysis, and the crystallographic pattern of the as-synthesized NiNPs was characterized by using a Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Jeol, JEM-1200 Ex II, Japan), an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS, INCAx-sight7421, Oxford Instruments), and a X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X'pert, Philips). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded by using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (S-3100, SCINCO). Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI430A potentiostat (CH Instruments Inc., USA). A conventional three-electrode system was used, where a platinum electrode (ca. 3 mm diameter), a platinum wire, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively. A solar simulator equipped with a 200 W xenon lamp (Polaronix® K201, McScience) was used to generate AM 1.5 G and a photovoltaic power meter (Polaronix® K101 LAB20, McScience) was used to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) curves. The incident light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) by a standard mono-Si solar cell (PVM 396, PV Measurement) being certified by the U.S. national renewable energy laboratory (NREL). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded by an IPCE measurement system (Polaronix® K3100, McScience) with a 300 W xenon light source. The intensity of the incident monochromatic light was also calibrated with the same standard mono-Si solar cell.


Fig. 1 shows the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image (A1), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectra (B1), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (C1) of the as-synthesized NiNPs. Both FE-SEM and TEM analyses clearly show that the NiNPs are spherical in shape, with a size distribution ranging from ca. 20 to 120 nm. The EDS and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses [inset, Fig. 1 (B1)] confirm the formation of pure nickel (Ni-Lα 0.853 keV, Ni-Kα 7.475 keV) with (111) and (200) face-centered cubic (fcc) reflections.

The as-synthesized NiNPs were stable in the I−/I3− electrolyte (5 mg mL−1) over a period of 60 days at room temperature as shown in the SEM, EDS, and TEM images in Fig. 1 (A2, B2, and C2, respectively). The EDS spectrum clearly indicates the formation of the I−/I3− adsorption layer (the corresponding extra iodine peak at ca. 3.9 keV) that could be easily eliminated by sonication in ethanol for 10 min. The inset in Fig. 1 (B2) clearly indicates the coloration of ethanol due to a desorption of the I−/I3− from the NiNPs. The TEM image, taken after the elimination of the residual I−/I3−, clearly demonstrates that there is no notable change in size and morphology of the NiNPs after I−/I3− treatment, over a period of 60 days.

Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) at the Pt electrode in solutions of Ni2+ (10 mM NiSO4), I−/I3−, and a solution taken from the mixture of I−/I3− and NiNPs after aging for 60 days [I−/I3− (NiNPs)]. The oxidation wave of Ni2+ to Ni3+ was observed at ca. 0.80 V (I′) in the CV of the Ni2+ solution, with the corresponding irreversible reduction wave at ca. 0.70 V (I′′). Similar voltammetric results were observed by Wang et al. for the deposition of NiO/Ni(OH)2 on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. Meanwhile, the two CVs obtained from both I−/I3− and I−/I3−(NiNPs) were essentially identical, clearly indicating that the two typical consecutive oxidation waves peaked at ca. 0.55 V (II′) and 0.90 V (III′) for the sequential oxidation of iodide to triiodide (I− to I3−) and triiodide to iodine (I3− to I2), respectively. This clearly showed the absence of an oxidative reaction of NiNPs with I−/I3− to form Ni2+, and therefore the stability of NiNPs in the I−/I3−-based electrolyte.
The LSPR effect of NiNPs on the absorption of the N719 dye was investigated both in the aqueous phase and at the N719-loaded TiO2 photoanodes (N719|TiO2) with a thickness of ca. 5 μm. These are schematically shown in Fig. 3 (A1, B1, and C1, respectively). The NiNPs showed a broad absorption behavior with the SPR band at ca. 560 nm (Fig. 3 A1). This broad absorption band of NiNPs might be due to their long range size distribution (20–120 nm), where the smaller sized NiNPs contributed mostly to broaden the absorption band. The absorption enhancement of N719 was monitored in the NiNP solution [Fig. 3 (A2–A4)], and clearly indicated the enhancement of the net absorption of N719 in the presence of NiNPs in the aqueous phase, without altering the absorption maxima. The net absorption enhancement (ΔOD), and the relative enhancement of the effective extinction coefficient (Δα/α) of N719 over the whole absorption range, suggested a LSPR effect of the NiNPs. A similar effect was observed when N719 was adsorbed on the TiO2 nanoparticles in the aqueous phase [Fig. 3 (B2–B4)]. The LSPR of the NiNPs was also observed over the entire spectral range of N719 absorption when the NiNPs were spin-coated onto an electrode of N719|TiO2 with a film thickness of ca. 5 μm [Fig. 3 (C2–C4)]. This is consistent with the net absorption enhancement of dyes via the LSPR mode with other metal nanoparticles reported previously. Therefore, this can be attributed to the interaction of the molecular dipole in N719 with a strong localized electric field surrounding the NiNPs in the thin film structure, as well as the possible additional enhancement of light scattering induced by NiNPs to prolong the optical path.
For a quantitative evaluation of the LSPR effect of the NiNPs on the performance of DSSCs, we compared the performance of the cell with NiNPs (NiNP-DSSC) with a conventional cell (R-DSSC). The photoelectrode of the R-DSSC was fabricated as previously reported, while that of the NiNP-DSSC was fabricated by introducing an optimum amount of NiNPs (1 mg mL−1) into the I−/I3−-based electrolyte, to prepare NiNPs@I−/I3− (Fig. S1, and see the ESI for further details). Fig. 4 (A1, B1, and C1) shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the R-DSSC and NiNP-DSSC being sensitized by N719 with a photoanode thickness of ca. 2, 5, and 10 μm, respectively. These J–V parameters are summarized in Table 1.

NiNP-DSSCs exhibited a net PCE (η), without an additional scattering layer, of up to 2.32, 6.02, and 9.83% for the cells with a thickness of 2, 5, and 10 μm, respectively. This corresponds to a respective net PCE (Δη/η) enhancement of 43.2, 20.4, and 12.7% when compared to those of R-DSSC. These results are mostly attributable to the significant enhancement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), that increased by 35.5, 24.8, and 10.4%, respectively, for 2, 5, and 10 μm thick TiO2 photoanode-based DSSCs. Conversely, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the fill factor (FF) did not exhibit any notable variations from the R-DSSC to the NiNP-DSSC. The relatively low value of the net enhancement of Jsc and the PCE for the 10 μm thick photoelectrode can be ascribed to the fact that the distribution of the NiNPs is mostly localized at the outer boundary of the TiO2 mesoporous layer, due to the size of the nanoparticles. Therefore, the enhancement of light harvesting by LSPR is effective only for dyes around the NiNPs. Further, the additional carrier collection by the light scattering effect from the NiNPs significantly decreased during the long diffusional transport of electrons through the thick photoanode. It is obvious that the relative enhancement of light harvesting efficiency by LSPR can be maximized with a thinner photoelectrode (with which the recombination loss is minimized during electron diffusion), and/or the introduction of smaller nanoparticles that can permeate into the mesoporous TiO2 layer of the photoelectrode, unless the quantum confinement effect is dominant. Fig. 4 (A2, B2, and C2) shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of both R-DSSC and NiNP-DSSC with a photoanode thickness of 2, 5, and 10 μm, respectively. The enhancement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the NiNP-DSSC over a wide absorption range (340–700 nm) is highly consistent with the higher Jsc. Additionally, the Jsc of R-DSSC and NiNP-DSSC were tested periodically for 121 h. The I−/I3− electrolyte based on acetonitrile and valeronitrile, which is a volatile electrolyte, degraded the Jsc as well as the device PCE over aging. However, the net decrease of Jsc for the NiNP-DSSC after 121 h was 22.08%, while it was 24.47% for R-DSSC and confirmed the stability of NiNPs@ I−/I3− (Fig. S2).
This effect was universal to other dyes for high-efficiency DSSCs. Fig. 5 and Table 1 show the PCE enhancement of NiNP-DSSCs sensitized by N3, Ru505, and Z907. The net PCE enhancement is 13.3, 8.4, and 7.26% for the NiNP-DSSCs sensitized by N3, Ru505, and Z907, respectively.

We described a very simple approach to utilize the highly stable and corrosion resistant LSPR effect of NiNPs, in a conventional I−/I3−-based electrolyte, to enhance the PCE of DSSCs. This induced the enhancement of the net optical absorption of N719 over a wide wavelength range, so that the net PCE enhancement was up to 43.2, 20.4, and 12.7% for 2, 5, and 10 μm thick TiO2 photoanodes, respectively. These results were mostly attributed to the significant increase in the Jsc caused by the LSPR of the NiNPs in the electrolyte, or localized on the outer boundary of the TiO2 mesoporous layer. Such an effect was universally observed with other conventional dyes such as N3, Ru505, and Z907. This approach is extremely simple and highly advantageous over other reported strategies, in that it does not require additional complex processes or steps to prepare sophisticated nanostructures to enhance light harvesting by the plasmonic effect. We believe that the current strategy will be highly useful to improve the performance of various types of solar cells, with much less processing costs, particularly for flexible and low-temperature processing type designs that require very thin photoanodes and highly effective light absorbers. We are currently extending this strategy to develop highly efficient cells fabricated under low-temperature conditions.
