Recently, highly efficient solar cells based on organic–inorganic perovskites have been intensively studied for developing fabricating methods and device structures. To improve the performance of perovskite film devices, delicate control of charge transfer material interconnectivity is required. Here, controlling the mesoporous TiO2 structure improves their charge collection and injection rate, and allows substantial enhancement of the corresponding device performance. We found that increasing the TiCl4 processing time deteriorates the device performance by introducing a large amount of excessively large perovskite particles, surface roughness and charge recombination. Proper TiCl4 processing dramatically improves the charge transport within the electron transfer layer, explaining the efficient performance of meso-superstructured solar cells.

Thin-film photovoltaics aim to reduce the cost of electricity generated from sunlight compared to that from conventional silicon solar cells. Several approaches have been developed for solar cells such as amorphous and nanocrystalline Si, inorganic compound semiconductors, quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and, currently, perovskite-based meso-superstructured solar cells (MSSCs). In particular, solid-state perovskite-based solar cells have risen to the forefront of emerging PV research. Evolving from DSSCs, MSSCs have demonstrated a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17%, broad light absorption, and open-circuit voltages (Voc) of over 1.05 V, by employing CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, as the absorber, coated upon the surface of a mesoporous TiO2via a two-step liquid sequential method. Although there is a potential toxicology issue of lead, a key component in the archetypical material, perovskite absorbers are also desirable by virtue of being easy to solution process at low temperature using low-cost materials and do not rely on the use of elements in limited supply, unstable solvents such as hydrazine, and high-temperature annealing.

So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in a single step, by co-evaporation of two precursors (PbCl2 and CH3NH3I), by vapor assisted solution process, and by two-step sequential deposition. Two-step sequential deposition of perovskite provides an efficient low-cost route to achieve high performance of perovskite solar cells and is better in tolerating I–V hysteresis. In this method, the transformation process from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3, different PbI2 concentrations, the spin coating step of PbI2, and different solvents for different crystallizing processing of PbI2 were studied, respectively. In addition, different CH3NH3I concentrations, pre-wetting process control, and reaction temperature control were used to study conversion processing and morphology controlling, which are closely related to the photovoltaic performance as they should facilitate rapid and efficient charge collection and transfer. However, the interconnection of TiO2 grains in mesoporous TiO2 films has remained experimentally unexploited. This would be highly advantageous to the device performance. On the one hand, the generated charge will be transported fast to the electrodes, hence raising the charge injection rate and suppressing the possibility of recombination. On the other hand, easily filling the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 layer with perovskite materials and decreasing the roughness of the mesoporous TiO2 film surface will form uniform perovskite particle size, increase the perovskite coverage and allow a greater fraction of the incoming sunlight to be absorbed. Planar perovskite and mesoporous Al2O3-based solar cells both transferred electrons through perovskite layers, which exhibited ambipolar transport of electrons and holes. Using mesoporous TiO2 films or MgO ultrathin film coated TiO2 nanoparticles as the electron-transport layer, S. I. Seok fabricated MSSCs with maximum PCE greater than 20%.
Herein, we systematically report controllable TiCl4 processing of mesoporous TiO2 films and the photovoltaic performance of CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite devices via a two-step sequential deposition procedure. The interconnection of electron transfer material TiO2 nanocrystalline grains and the roughness of the mesoporous surface can be controlled by varying the TiCl4 processing time. Moreover, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy revealed that electron injection with proper TiCl4 processing is important, which can effectively suppress charge recombination and thereby enhance the photovoltaic performance of the devices.

PbI2 and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, respectively. Spiro-MeOTAD was purchased from Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd. All other materials were purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd and used as received. Substrates of the cells are fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO, Pilkington, thickness: 2.2 mm, sheet resistance 14 Ω per square). CH3NH3I was synthesized as per the literature.


First, laser-patterned, FTO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in an alkaline, aqueous washing solution, and rinsed with deionized water, ethanol, acetone and 2-propanol, respectively. A hole-blocking layer of compact TiO2 with a thickness of about 50 nm was deposited by a dip-coating method with a TiO2 organic solution, followed by a sintering process at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated in a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer with a thickness of 180 nm was prepared as previously reported. The mesoporous TiO2 film was immersed in 20 mM aqueous TiCl4 (>98%, Aldrich) solution at 70 °C for different times (0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 60 min, respectively) and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.


PbI2 was dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 462 mg ml−1 (∼1 M) under stirring. The PbI2 solution was kept at 70 °C on the heating plate. The mesoporous TiO2 films were then infiltrated with PbI2 by spin coating at 6500 rpm for 5 s and dried. The films were then dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 120 min, rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min.

The HTM was then deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spin-coating formulation was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) (spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μl of a stock solution of 520 mg ml−1 lithium bis(trifluoro-methylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 ml chlorobenzene. Finally, approximately 200 nm Ag (measured by SEM) was thermally evaporated under vacuum to act as the cathode. The device fabrication was carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions and a humidity of <1% in the cleanroom.

UV-Vis absorption and TRPL spectra were recorded with Shimadzu UV-2550 (300–600 nm: xenon lamp, 300 W; 600–900 nm: tungsten–halogen lamp, 150 W) and Fls-800 spectrometers, respectively. XRD patterns were obtained using a D8 Advance (Germany) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA) with a scanning rate of 4° min−1 for wide angle test increments over the Bragg angle range of 10–70°. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Bruker Multimode 8 Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) in “tapping” mode. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis was performed on a Hitachi-S-4800 electron microscope. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source under the illumination of a simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Newport 69907) with an AM 1.5 filter. The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter for approximating 1 sun light intensity. While measuring the current and voltage, the cell was covered with a black mask with an aperture (aperture area is close to the active device area). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured in DC mode with a 1/4 m double monochromator (Crowntech DK242), a multi-meter (Keithley 2000), and two light sources depending on the wavelength range required (300–600 nm: xenon lamp, 300 W; 600–900 nm: tungsten–halogen lamp, 150 W). The monochromatic light intensity for IPCE efficiency was calibrated with a reference silicon photodiode. All the measurements of the solar cells were performed under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature without encapsulation.


The fabrication of perovskite solar cells with controllable TiCl4 treatment is described schematically in Fig. 1. Firstly, a mesoporous TiO2 film (thickness ∼180 nm) was deposited on a thin compact TiO2 blocking layer by a spin-coating method. Secondly, the mesoporous TiO2 film was immersed in 20 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for different times (0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 60 min, respectively) and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, followed by spin-coating of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Thirdly, the dried PbI2 film was dipped in a CH3NH3I solution for 120 min and heated at 70 °C for 30 min to form perovskite. Finally, a HTM film was spin-coated on the perovskite film before the Ag film evaporated. The present two-step sequential deposition method is expected to be more precise than the two-step dipping method, thanks to its uniform reaction procedure.

The photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells were measured under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5), which are shown in Fig. 2 and the relevant performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The solar cell with free TiCl4 solution treatment demonstrates a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 18.3 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, a series resistance (Rs) of 11.35 Ω cm2, a shunt resistance (Rsh) of 892.72 Ω cm2 and a fill factor (FF) of 53.2% to yield an efficiency of 8.4%. The Jsc of devices increased substantially from 18.3 mA cm−2 to 21.3 mA cm−2 when the TiCl4 processing time was increased from 0 min to 30 min. The increase in photocurrent density can be explained by the great interconnectivity of the TiO2 nanoparticles for 30 min processing. The high interconnectivity of TiO2 nanoparticles could accelerate the electron transport and collection, resulting in high photocurrents. The Voc increases from 0.87 V with free TiCl4 to 0.94 V for 30 min TiCl4 treatment, and the overall efficiency is improved from 8.4% (free-TiCl4 treatment) to 14.6% (30 min treatment). Increasing the TiCl4 processing time to 60 min degraded the PCE of the device, and the other three photovoltaic device parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF) decreased. Obviously, the open circuit voltage (Voc) for the champion device is 0.94 V, the short circuit current (Jsc) is 21.3 mA cm−2, and the filling factor (FF) is 73.1% with 14.6% power conversion efficiency based on the employed simple device structure. It is notable that the series resistance Rs and short-circuit resistance Rsh of the solar cell with 30 min TiCl4 treatment were 5.76 Ω cm2 and 2278.23 Ω cm2, respectively. This Rs was the smallest relative to other processing times. These were the results of the optimum interconnectivity of TiO2 nanoparticles, and the electron collection and transfer were fast and smooth, in accordance with measurements below. It is noticeable that improved electron-collecting and hole-blocking layers are necessary to obtain high short-circuit currents and fill factors.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of TiO2 films treated with a TiCl4 solution for different times. On processing the mesoporous TiO2 film with TiCl4 solution from 0 min to 60 min, the particle size of TiO2 nanoparticles gradually increased. Accordingly the AFM 3D topographic images in Fig. 4 display decreases of roughness with prolonging the processing time from 0 min to 30 min. The calculated rms roughnesses for films processed for 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min were 14.1 nm, 14.7 nm, 13.7 nm, 14.5 nm, and 13.2 nm, respectively, in Fig. 4g. However, the increase of roughness (13.8 nm) on 60 min TiCl4 processing was accompanied by large TiO2 nanoparticles, which was different from the changes made by short time TiCl4 processing. While the roughness of the TiO2 film declined with prolonging from 0 min to 30 min the TiCl4 processing time, the increasing interconnectivity of TiO2 nanoparticles improved the Jsc and reduced the Rs, as shown by the J–V curve in Fig. 2.

Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the perovskite film deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 films with different TiCl4 processing times. When the perovskite film deposited on mesoporous TiO2 with 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 20 min treatment, respectively, it was found that there were a loose arrangement of the perovskite crystallites and bareness of the mesoporous TiO2 (blue dotted loops) without perovskite particle coverage. While the perovskite particles deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 with prolonging the TiCl4 treatment to 30 min and 60 min, respectively, we hardly found bare TiO2 films on the capping layer of perovskite. It is noticeable that the SEM images (Fig. S1) and AFM images (Fig. S2) of PbI2 films on mesoporous TiO2 with different TiCl4 processing times show uniform and compact layers, which had calculated rms roughnesses less than 9 nm. However, after the PbI2 film reacted with CH3NH3I, the maximum grain size of perovskite crystallites with 30 min TiCl4 processing was 300 nm, and the maximum grain size was enlarged to 600 nm at 60 min in the perovskite capping layer. The calculated rms roughnesses shown in Fig. 5g for perovskite films processed for 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 60 min, corresponding to 116 nm, 92 nm, 81.7 nm, 73.9 nm, 54.2 nm, and 82 nm, respectively, were generally larger than those of PbI2 films, since volume expansion (∼75%) occurs due to the conversion of PbI2 into CH3NH3PbI3. The bigger perovskite crystallite grain size in the capping layer increased the surface roughness, which increased the number of defects in the perovskite/HTM interface layer; however, it was not favorable to device performance, where Voc and FF decreased in Fig. 2. The reason was that the roughnesses of the mesoporous TiO2 surface and the PbI2 or perovskite capping layer increased, and perovskite gradually became large and uneven, which would increase the interfacial defects and reduced the electron-extraction and -transport efficiency of the cells.

Fig. 7 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films deposited on mesoporous TiO2 films adjusted by different TiCl4 processing times. When the PbI2 film was treated with CH3NH3I solution for 120 min, three strongest diffraction peaks indexed to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 (14.09°, 28.37° and 31.83°) were observed, whereas there was still some PbI2 left unreacted, as evidenced by the 12.8° (001) diffraction peaks. A trace amount of leftover PbI2 was also observed in the CH3NH3PbI3 film produced through alternative processing approaches. However, this material may not be very harmful because of its large band gap. An appropriate amount of PbI2 species in the CH3NH3PbI3 film improved the carrier behavior, possibly due to reduced charge recombination in the grain boundaries and the TiO2/perovskite surface. The XRD pattern showed that the TiCl4 processing time hardly affected the perovskite crystallization, which is in agreement with the above UV spectra in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis spectra of the perovskite film as a function of TiCl4 processing time. The CH3NH3PbI3 conversion clearly exhibited an increased light absorption across the 400 nm into the band-edge 780–790 nm. The optimum absorption was greatly enhanced when the film was treated with TiCl4 solution for 30 min. While the processing time increased to 60 min, the absorption dramatically declined. The systematic increase of the absorption was a result of the increased coverage and uniform particle size of perovskites processed with additive TiCl4 processing time.

Fig. 9 shows incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) curves for the solar cells with controllable TiCl4 solution treatment. All of the IPCE curves have a photocurrent response from 400 nm to 800 nm. The integrated photocurrent from the IPCE is consistent with the measured Jsc value. A short processing time (0 min or 5 min) and a prolonged treatment time of 60 min would deteriorate the photovoltaic performance in accordance with IQE in Fig. S3. Since the large roughness of perovskite with increasing the defects prevented charge carrier diffusion in perovskite grains and the interfaces and enhanced the charge carrier recombination, the poor CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer from 0 min and 20 min decreased the absorption of photons in the long wavelength region 600–800 nm.
To gain insight into the underlying reason for the optimum performance of perovskite solar cells on mesoporous TiO2 with different TiCl4 processing times and further confirm charge transport processes, the time-resolved photoluminescences (TRPL) of the perovskites on mesoporous TiO2 with treatment (0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 60 min) and the perovskites on glass were investigated in Fig. 10. Normalizing the data with two exponential decay curves yields the lifetime of carriers and/or excitons, we observed a significant quenching effect when the perovskite layer establishes contact with the mesoporous TiO2 layer for 30 min treatment. All the curves are fitted with a biexponential function in accordance with reports [eqn (1)], as summarized in Table 2:

Typically, the photogenerated excitons diffuse into defects, and the large time constant τ2 reflects this early event and might come from bimolecular recombination. It is the small time constant τ1 that is associated with the exciton lifetime of CH3NH3PbI3. Thus, a small τ1 value will indicate a fast exciton-diffusion process. Indeed, of all the samples we studied, our CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 layers with TiCl4 treatment for 30 min exhibited the smallest τ1 value (0.379 ns), which corresponds to the highest electron-extraction and -transport efficiency. These high electron-extraction and -transport rates contribute significantly to the high Jsc value of the perovskite solar cell with TiCl4 treatment for 30 min. We assume that the radiative and nonradiative decay processes of CH3NH3PbI3 associated with TiO2 occur at rates otherwise identical to those of CH3NH3PbI3 in neat films in the absence of TiO2. Under these conditions, the observed fast lifetime can be correlated to the rate for interfacial electron transfer by eqn (2)
ket = 1/τads − 1/τun
(2)
where
τads and τun denote the emission lifetimes for the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 surface complex and for the neat CH3NH3PbI3, whereas ket is the specific rate constant for the charge injection process. The electron injection rate of 2.49 × 109 s−1 from CH3NH3PbI3 to mesoporous TiO2 with TiCl4 treatment for 30 min is 22.7% faster than that (2.03 × 109 s−1) of free TiCl4 treatment (see Table 2).

Apparently, the fast electron injection rate to the mesoporous TiO2 film with 30 min TiCl4 treatment is beneficial to charge separation at the interfaces of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 (shown in Scheme 1), thus suppressing charge recombination, resulting in improved Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE for the 30 min processing devices. M. Graetzel et al. reported that the DSSC performance of the film as a sensitized photoanode was improved by further deposition of TiO2 from aqueous TiCl4 solution, and ultrafast electron injection from the excited complex into the treated TiO2 film occurred. A similar fast electron extraction effect in perovskite solar cells has recently been reported in a graphene quantum dot modified TiO2 system, presenting better photovoltaic performance than the pristine TiO2-based cells.
To investigate the reproducibility of solar cells treated for 30 min, 30 separate devices were fabricated and tested, and histograms of the cell-performance Voc and PCE are presented in Fig. 11. It can be found that the Voc values of the devices were all exceeding 900 mV and the average Voc was over 928 mV. As can be seen from the results, the average PCE is located at about 13.89%, and all PCE are more than 13%. Fig. S4 shows the photos of perovskite solar cells with 30 min TiCl4 processing. A champion PCE up to 14.6% was achieved with the TiCl4 treatment for 30 min.
When the mesoporous TiO2 films were treated with TiCl4 solution from 0 min to 30 min, the increasing interconnectivity and decreasing roughness of TiO2 grains increased the charge transfer and decreased the recombination, and hence the charge injection rate and Jsc are improved and the Rs was decreased, as indicated in the J–V curve in Fig. 2 and the TRPL spectra in Fig. 10. Controlling the uniformity of the perovskite film on the mesoporous TiO2 layer with optimum processing time could improve the FF and Rsh, which is consistent with the previous observation in the mesoporous-structured solar cells. With increasing the TiCl4 processing time, the AFM images in Fig. 5 and SEM images in Fig. 6 show that the perovskite nanoparticles grew uniformly, and we hardly found the bare TiO2 film on the capping layer of perovskite. Meanwhile the roughness of the mesoporous TiO2 surface decreased, as can be seen from calculated rms roughnesses in Fig. 4. In contrast, as the TiCl4 processing time of the mesoporous TiO2 film increased to 60 min, the perovskite particles became enlarged, leading to a much rougher perovskite surface on the capping layer shown in Fig. 5, which increases the number of defects in the perovskite/HTM interface layer; however, it was not favorable to device performance, resulting in decreased Voc and FF.

TiCl4 processing on mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells for 30 min is modified to achieve a uniform and high-coverage perovskite absorber layer with great IPCE performance and high UV-visible absorption. A notable Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2 and efficiency of 14.6% as well as a high Voc of 0.94 V have been achieved using the perovskite solar cells at 1 sun light intensity. The structure with treatment for 30 min exhibits the optimum interconnectivity of TiO2 grains, and improves the electron-extraction and -transport efficiency and charge injection rate, which contribute significantly to the high Jsc value and PCE of the perovskite solar cell. We believe that the performance of the cell can be further improved if more investigations are carried out on materials and interfaces.
