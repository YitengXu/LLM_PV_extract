Non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) attract more attention due to the constantly refreshed power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on the versatile non-fullerene acceptors. In this work, PCEs of 10.51% and 11.02% were obtained for two kinds of non-fullerene PSC with IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC as the acceptor and PBDB-T as the donor. ITCPTC has a relatively narrow bandgap and a high absorption coefficient compared with IDT6CN-M, which explains well the relatively large short-circuit current density of 17.44 mA cm−2 for the ITCPTC based binary PSCs. Meanwhile, the IDT6CN-M based binary PSCs exhibit a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 75.3% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.915 V. A PCE of 11.92% and a FF of 76.5% were achieved for the ternary PSCs with 60 wt% ITCPTC content in the acceptors, which should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting and their good compatibility for a synergistic improvement of exciton utilization and charge transport in the ternary active layers. The FF of 76.5% is among the top values of ternary non-fullerene PSCs.

Recently, ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) with two acceptors have shown great potential for the achievement of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the rapid progress of highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors. Compared to the fullerene derivatives, non-fullerene acceptors possess many advantages, such as strong absorption in the visible and NIR region, tunable energy levels, and low cost. In ternary PSCs, the third component plays a critical role in increasing photon harvesting, facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. The key photovoltaic parameters of ternary PSCs can be simultaneously improved by elaborately selecting the third component and optimizing the device fabrication technology. Improvement of the fill factor (FF) is still a big challenge due to the complicated morphology in ternary PSCs which is affected by many factors. Until now, ternary PSCs with a PCE of over 11% and a FF of over 75% have not been reported. In this manuscript, the PBDB-T:ITCPTC based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.51% with a relatively large short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.44 mA cm−2. The PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 11.02% with a relatively large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.915 V and a FF of 75.3%. By inheriting the advantages of two binary PSCs, a PCE of 11.92% and a FF of 76.5% were achieved for the ternary PSCs with 60 wt% ITCPTC content in the acceptor, which should be among the top values of ternary non-fullerene PSCs.


Ternary strategy has been commonly demonstrated as an efficient method to improve the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs), especially in the past five years. The preliminary criteria of the third component selection is a complementary photon harvesting range with the host donor:acceptor (D:A) blend system, which is inspired from tandem solar cells. In fact, the third component is mixed into a host blend solution to prepare a bulk heterojunction active layer, which makes the dynamic process more complex in ternary active layers. The beneficial characteristics of the third component should be considered for simultaneously optimizing photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and utilization, charge transport and collection in the ternary active layers. Recently, efficient non-fullerene acceptors have been well developed to markedly improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs, which also provides more selection with which to prepare efficient ternary PSCs. Here, the recent development of efficient ternary PSCs with two acceptors (one fullerene/one non-fullerene or two non-fullerenes) is summarized in Table 1. Ternary PSCs with PCEs of over 9% were specifically selected to give more objective statistical results. A PCE improvement of more than 10% compared with the corresponding binary PSCs can be obtained by employing a ternary strategy, while also keeping the simple fabrication technology. In fact, there are only two cases of binary PSCs with PCEs of over 10% and ternary PSCs with PCEs of over 12%. There is enough room for PCE improvement of ternary PSCs based on two highly efficient binary PSCs. It is universally recognized that the short-circuit current density (JSC) of ternary PSCs can be markedly increased due to the enhanced photon harvesting by the third component. The key issues are how to simultaneously improve the other parameters for obtaining highly efficient ternary PSCs, especially for the fill factor (FF) of ternary PSCs. As seen from Table 1, an improvement of the FF should be a feasible strategy in ternary PSCs, although charge traps are unavoidable in the ternary active layer due to the different energy levels of the materials used. More deep investigations should be carried out to clarify its working mechanism. The working mechanisms of ternary PSCs have been commonly reported, such as energy transfer (ET), charge transfer (CT), a parallel-linkage model (PLM) and an alloy model (AM). The third component was also used as a morphology regulator or nucleating agent to adjust the molecular arrangement of the ternary active layers. The relationship between the materials used and the working mechanism has not been developed for guiding the selection of the third component and the device design. The corresponding binary PSCs should have complementary photovoltaic parameters to optimize the performance of the ternary PSCs. Many detailed investigations should be carried out to formulate the selection criteria of the third component according to a given host D:A blend system.

Novel donor materials need to be well developed to better match the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptor materials, resulting in a constant increase in the largest reported PCE of binary non-fullerene PSCs. In this work, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) was selected as the electron donor. The non-fullerene materials (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-cyclopentane-1,3-dione-[c]thiophen))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:20,30-d0]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b0]dithiophene) (ITCPTC) and (4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b]thiophene-alt-[5,6-d]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)-2-(5/6-methyl-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IDT6CN-M) were selected as the electron acceptors. The acceptors IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC can work well with PBDB-T to deliver a PCE of 11.02% and 10.51%, respectively. Meanwhile, ITCPTC has a narrower bandgap and slightly higher absorption coefficient compared with IDT6CN-M. The ITCPTC based PSCs exhibit a relatively large JSC of 17.44 mA cm−2. The IDT6CN-M based PSCs exhibit a relatively large FF of 75.3% and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.915 V. According to the characteristics of the two acceptors and the photovoltaic parameters of the binary PSCs, a series of ternary PSCs were prepared with different ITCPTC content in the acceptors. The PCE of the optimized ternary PSCs reaches 11.92% with 60 wt% ITCPTC content in the acceptors, which results from the simultaneously enhanced JSC of 17.81 mA cm−2 and the FF of 76.5%. The improvement of the JSC and the FF can adequately make up for the slightly decreased VOC, resulting in more than an 8% or 13% PCE improvement compared with the binary PSCs with PCEs of 11.02% or 10.51%. The PCE improvement of the ternary PSCs can be attributed to enhanced photon harvesting and their good compatibility for better exciton utilization and charge transport in the ternary active layers. The experimental details are described in the ESI.


Fig. 1a displays the chemical structures of PBDB-T, ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M, and a schematic diagram of the device structure. A series of PSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al, with the only difference being the ITCPTC content in the acceptors. The absorption spectra of the neat films were measured and the normalized absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The PBDB-T film exhibits a wide photon harvesting range with a major absorption peak at 630 nm. The IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC films show a strong photon harvesting ability in the long wavelength range with an absorption peak at 685 nm and 725 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra for these materials are obviously complementary, which may provide great potential for the preparation of efficient ternary PSCs by optimizing the ITCPTC content in the acceptors for the harvesting of as many photons as possible. The absorption coefficients of IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC were measured and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), and the maximum molar extinction coefficients of IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC are approximately 2.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Fig. 1c shows the absorption spectra of the D:A blend films with different ITCPTC content in the acceptors. An optimized photon harvesting ability in the whole wavelength range should be obtained by adjusting the ITCPTC content in the acceptors, which is the prerequisite for preparing highly efficient PSCs.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of all the PSCs with different ITCPTC content in the acceptors were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 (ESI). A PCE of 11.02% was achieved for the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M based PSCs, with a JSC of 16.00 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.915 V and a FF of 75.3%. The PBDB-T:ITCPTC based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 10.51% with a JSC of 17.44 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.836 V and a FF of 72.1%. Obviously, the JSC of the PBDB-T:ITCPTC based PSCs is larger than that of the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M based PSCs, which can be well explained from the corresponding absorption spectra. Meanwhile, the two kinds of binary PSC exhibited rather high FFs (>72%), suggesting that ideal charge transport channels or phase separation should be formed in the two kinds of binary active layer. It should be highlighted that the JSCs and FFs of the ternary PSCs can be simultaneously improved when the ITCPTC content in the acceptors is up to 60 wt%, and then decreased on the incorporation of more ITCPTC. The PCE reaches 11.92% for the ternary PSCs with 60 wt% ITCPTC in the acceptors, resulting from an enhanced JSC of 17.81 mA cm−2, a FF of 76.5% and an acceptable VOC of 0.875 V. It is also worth highlighting that the FF of 76.5% indicates the good compatibility of the materials used, and is among the top values for ternary non-fullerene PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all the PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. According to the EQE spectra, the calculated JSCs are slightly less than the measured values, with deviations of less than 3%, due to the use of cells without encapsulation for the EQE measurements. The measured and calculated key parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. The EQE spectra of the ternary PSCs are gradually extended toward the long wavelength range along with the increase of the ITCPTC content in the acceptors, which can be well explained by the absorption spectra of the corresponding blend films. Meanwhile, an apparent difference can be observed between the EQE spectra of all the PSCs and the absorption spectra of the corresponding blend films. Although all the blend films have rather weak absorption for light with wavelengths of less than 550 nm, the PSCs also exhibit relatively high EQE values. To clarify the underlying reason, the absorption spectra of the active layers (in real cells) were calculated according to the reflection spectra of the corresponding cells, and are shown in Fig. 2c. The reflection spectra of all the PSCs and a special device ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PMMA (∼120 nm)/PDIN/Al were measured and are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). It is apparent that the absorption spectra of the active layers are different from those of the blend films, which is attributed to an interference effect between the incident light and the reflected light from the Al electrode. The absorption spectral shape of the active layers is very similar to the EQE spectral shape of the corresponding PSCs.

Although both the JSCs and the FFs of the ternary PSCs are improved along with the ITCPTC content up to 60 wt%, the VOCs of the ternary PSCs exhibit a monotonously decreasing trend, as shown in Fig. 2d. For the PSCs with the same interfacial layers and electrodes, the VOC strongly depends on the energy levels of the materials used. It is known that photogenerated holes will be transported along the channels formed by the donor PBDB-T, and photogenerated electrons will be transported along the channels formed by IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC in the ternary PSCs. The energy levels of the electron transport channels will vary along with the change of the ITCPTC content in the acceptors. The oxidation and reduction potential onsets of the acceptor blend films were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the ITCPTC:IDT6CN-M blend films were calculated according to the CV curves. The key parameters of the acceptor blend films are listed in Table S1 (ESI). The dependence of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the ITCPTC:IDT6CN-M blend films on the ITCPTC content is shown in Fig. 2e. Obviously, the LUMO energy levels of the acceptor blend films are gradually decreased along with the increase of the ITCPTC content, indicating that alloy states of ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M may be formed in the acceptor blend films. The decreased VOCs of the ternary PSCs can be explained from the decreased LUMO levels of the acceptor blend films. The alloy model has been commonly proposed to explain the linearly varied VOC dependence on the content of the third component in ternary PSCs. To further confirm the efficient ternary strategy, the statistical PCE distribution histogram of the binary and optimized ternary PSCs is shown in Fig. 2f. The average PCEs are 10.76%, 10.32%, and 11.73% for IDT6CN-M, the ITCPTC based binary PSCs, and the optimized ternary PSCs, respectively. The average PCEs were calculated according to 20 cells prepared from different batches. The detailed J–V curves and the photovoltaic parameters of the optimized ternary PSCs are exhibited in Fig. S5 and Table S2 (ESI). The shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) of all PSCs were calculated according to the J–V curves, and are listed in Table 2. The Rsh increases and the Rs decreases with the increase in the ITCPTC content in the acceptors to 60 wt%, then the Rsh decreases and the Rs increases on the incorporation of more ITCPTC in the acceptors. The optimized ternary PSCs simultaneously exhibit a minimum Rs of 3.23 Ω cm2 and a maximum Rsh of 1830 Ω cm2, which is beneficial to charge transport and collection for obtaining the relatively high FF of 76.5%.
The intermolecular interaction between IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC was further investigated to clarify the working mechanism of the ternary PSCs. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectrum of ITCPTC and the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of IDT6CN-M, and the apparent spectral overlap is beneficial for energy transfer from IDT6CN-M to ITCPTC. To further confirm the energy transfer from IDT6CN-M to ITCPTC, the PL spectra of the acceptor blend films with different amounts of ITCPTC were measured under 650 nm light excitation and are shown in Fig. 3b. The thicknesses of the neat and blend films were about 100 nm for the PL measurement. Both the neat ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M films exhibit broad PL spectra with different emission peaks at 730 nm and 770 nm, respectively, resulting in an apparent PL spectral overlap. Meanwhile, the PL intensity of the neat IDT6CN-M film is much stronger than that of the neat ITCPTC film under the same excitation conditions. The PL emissions of the blend films exhibit a broader spectral range and a red-shifted emission peak along with the increase of the ITCPTC content. The red-shifted PL emission peak of the blend films along with the increase of the ITCPTC content should be mainly attributed to the enhanced PL emission intensity of ITCPTC and the decreased PL emission intensity of IDT6CN-M. The enhanced PL emission intensity of ITCPTC should be attributed to its increased content and the energy transfer from IDT6CN-M to ITCPTC. It is apparent that the PL emission intensity of the acceptor blend films with ITCPTC content of 80 wt% is stronger than that of the neat ITCPTC film under the same excitation conditions, which can further confirm the efficient energy transfer from IDT6CN-M to ITCPTC. The transient absorption spectra of the acceptor blend films were investigated to further confirm the energy transfer process, as exhibited in Fig. S6 (ESI). It is apparent that the ground state bleach (GSB) signal at 750 nm is rather weak for the neat IDT6CN-M film, which can be selected as the characteristic signal to monitor the energy transfer in the acceptor blend films. The 750 nm decay curves of the neat and blend films were extracted from the transient absorption spectra and are shown in Fig. 3c. The corresponding fitted lifetimes are listed in Table S3 (ESI). The lifetime of 750 nm is approximately 1.03 ps for the neat ITCPTC film and is gradually increased to 2.21 ps for the blend films with 20 wt% ITCPTC, which should be a result of the energy transfer from IDT6CN-M to ITCPTC. The utilization of the IDT6CN-M exciton can be improved through the energy transfer process in ternary PSCs. To exclude charge transfer between two acceptors, a series of cells were prepared with neat IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC or their blend as the active layers. The J–V curves of the cells were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). The JSC of the cells with IDT6CN-M:ITCPTC as the active layer is in between that of the cells with IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC as the active layers, indicating that exciton dissociation at the IDT6CN-M/ITCPTC interface should be negligible. According to the above analysis, the dynamic processes in the ternary PSCs can be schematically depicted, as shown in Fig. 3d. The two acceptors prefer to form an alloy state with mixed energy levels due to their good compatibility. The alloy state of the two acceptors may be beneficial for the energy transfer from IDT6CN-M to ITCPTC and efficient electron transport in the ternary active layers, which can be further confirmed from the rather high FF of 76.5%.
The J–V curves of the binary and the optimized ternary PSCs were measured under different light intensities (Plight) and are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). The dependence of VOC on Plight for the typical PSCs is shown in Fig. 4a. The relationship of the VOC dependence on Plight can be expressed as: VOC ∝ nKT/qln(Plight), where K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. It is known that bimolecular recombination may be the dominant charge loss mechanism in the active layer when the parameter (n) is close to one. Trap-assisted recombination becomes more important if the parameter (n) is larger than one. As seen from Fig. 4a, the parameter (n) is about 1.21, 1.14 or 1.09 for the two binary and the optimized ternary PSCs, respectively. The n of 1.09 for the optimized ternary PSCs indicates that trap-assisted recombination can be efficiently decreased in the optimized ternary active layers. The dependence of JSC on Plight can be expressed as JSC ∝ Pα, as shown in Fig. 4b. The fitted α value is approximately 0.95, 0.97 or 0.98 for the two binary and the optimized ternary PSCs, respectively. The α value of 0.98 is very close to one, suggesting that there is less bimolecular recombination in the optimized ternary PSCs. The curves of the photocurrent density versus the effective voltage (Jph–Veff) of the binary and optimized ternary PSCs were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency. Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined as V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which JL = JD, and V is the applied voltage. Jph becomes the saturated state (Jsat) when Veff reaches 3 V, at which point all photogenerated excitons can be efficiently dissociated into free charge carriers and all photogenerated charge carriers can be adequately collected by electrodes. The exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency can be evaluated using Jph*/Jsat and Jph#/Jsat, respectively. Jph* and Jph# represent the Jph value under the short circuit or maximum power output conditions, respectively. The corresponding values are listed in the table shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. The Jph*/Jsat and Jph#/Jsat values of the optimized ternary PSCs are slightly larger than those of the binary PSCs, indicating that the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies can be simultaneously improved by incorporating 60 wt% ITCPTC in the acceptors. The enhanced charge collection efficiency can be further demonstrated from the improved FFs of the ternary PSCs. Here, the FF values of efficient binary and ternary PSCs with PCEs of over 11% are summarized in Fig. 4d and Fig. S9 (ESI). In fact, highly efficient PSCs rarely exhibit a FF of more than 75%, especially for ternary non-fullerene PSCs. In this work, our reported ternary PSCs exhibit a PCE of 11.92% and a FF of 76.5%. To give more solid experimental results, charge carrier mobility was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. S10 (ESI) shows the J0.5–V curves of electron-only and hole-only devices with the corresponding active layers. The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) were improved to 6.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the optimized ternary active layers, respectively. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electron and hole transport becomes more balanced with a μe/μh value of 1.05 in the optimized ternary active layers, which can be well supported by the relatively high FF of 76.5% for the optimized ternary PSCs.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to investigate the effect of the ITCPTC content in the acceptors on the morphology of the blend films, as shown in Fig. 5a. No obvious aggregation can be observed for the binary and ternary blend films, indicating the good compatibility of the materials used, PBDB-T, IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC. Fibrillar features can be clearly observed for the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M blend films. It is very interesting that flocculent features can be clearly observed for the PBDB-T:ITCPTC blend films. The fibrillar and flocculent features can be simultaneously observed for the optimized ternary blend films, which should be mainly related to the molecular distribution of PBDB-T in the ternary blend films. Two dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) was used to study the molecular arrangement in the blend films. Fig. 5b and c show the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cuts of the blend films with different ITCPTC content in the acceptors. All the blend films exhibit obvious (100) diffraction peaks at q = 0.31 Å−1 in the OOP and IP directions. To further confirm the information from the diffraction peaks, the OOP line-cuts of neat PBDB-T, ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M were measured, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI). The neat PBDB-T film exhibits a relatively strong (100) diffraction peak at qz = 0.31 Å−1. The neat ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M films exhibit relatively weak (100) diffraction peaks at qz = 0.35 Å−1 and 0.40 Å−1, respectively. According to the peak location of the neat PBDB-T film, the (100) diffraction peaks of the blend films reflect the molecular orientation and crystallinity of PBDB-T. The acceptors of ITCPTC and IDT6CN-M should be well mixed into the PBDB-T matrix. The (100) diffraction peak in the OOP direction and the (010) diffraction peak in the IP direction represent the edge-on orientation, while the (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction and the (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction represent the face-on orientation. For the optimized ternary blend films, the (100) peak intensity was markedly enhanced in the IP direction. A rather weak (100) peak intensity is observed in the OOP direction. This phenomenon indicates that PBDB-T prefers to form in a face-on orientation in the optimized ternary blend films, which should be propitious to hole transport along the normal direction of the substrates. The optimized PBDB-T molecular arrangement can also be supported by the increased hole mobility and improved FF of the optimized ternary PSCs. To further confirm the positive effect of the ternary strategy on the performance of the PSCs, the stability of the typical PSCs was measured and is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI). The stability of the optimized ternary PSCs is slightly better than that of the binary PSCs, which may be due to the optimized morphology and molecular arrangement in the ternary active layers. Meanwhile, inverted PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The J–V curves of the binary and optimized ternary inverted PSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI). The key photovoltaic parameters of the inverted PSCs are summarized in Table S4 (ESI). The PCE of the optimized ternary inverted PSC is about 11.58%, which is better than 10.93% of the inverted PSCs with IDT6CN-M as the acceptor, and 10.19% of the inverted PSCs with ITCPTC as the acceptor. The ternary strategy can once again be demonstrated as an efficient and simple method for PCE improvement from the inverted PSCs.

In summary, two kinds of binary non-fullerene PSCs were fabricated with one donor PBDB-T and different bandgap non-fullerene acceptors IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC. A PCE of 11.02% was achieved for the IDT6CN-M based PSCs, with a JSC of 16.00 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.915 V and a FF of 75.3%. The ITCPTC based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 10.51% with a JSC of 17.44 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.836 V and a FF of 72.1%. Based on the efficient binary PSCs, a series of ternary PSCs were fabricated with different ITCPTC content in the acceptors. The PCE of the ternary PSCs reached 11.92% with a JSC of 17.81 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.875 V and a FF of 76.5% for the ITCPTC content of 60 wt% in the acceptors. The PCE of 11.92% and the FF of 76.5% are among the top values for ternary non-fullerene PSCs. An approximately 8% or 13% PCE improvement was achieved compared with IDT6CN-M or ITCPTC based binary PSCs, respectively. In addition to the complementary absorption of IDT6CN-M and ITCPTC, the advantages of the binary PSCs were inherited in the optimized ternary PSCs. The photovoltaic parameters of the binary PSCs should be well considered as the selection criterion of materials for obtaining efficient ternary PSCs.
