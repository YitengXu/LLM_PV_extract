A large number of previous studies demonstrate that excess PbI2 in perovskite films is essential for solar cells to achieve high efficiency due to defect passivation, but few studies consider its negative impact on the devices' long-term stability. Herein, we introduced CaI2 instead of PbI2 with much less additive content into the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film and obtained a dense, uniform and surface-smooth morphology with much enlarged crystal grains. It has been demonstrated that addition of only 0.5% CaI2 additive to MAPbI3 is enough to enlarge the average grain size from 260 nm to 550 nm; accordingly, the defect density is decreased from 5.76 × 1016 cm−3 to 3.35 × 1016 cm−3 and the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime is increased from 65 ns to 133 ns; as the reference, addition of 5% PbI2 additive to MAPbI3 results in an average grain size of 410 nm, a defect density of 4.06 × 1016 cm−3 and a PL lifetime of 98 ns. In all of these key parameters, CaI2 as a new passivator of the MAPbI3 film, is found to be more effective than conventional PbI2. As a consequence, the champion cell based on MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 achieved a high efficiency of up to 19.3%, superior to those based on pristine MAPbI3 (16.1%) and MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 (18.0%). In addition, 10 times less additive of CaI2 than PbI2 made the perovskite film much less deviated from the ideal stoichiometry of MAPbI3, which is found to be essential for the device to achieve long-term stability.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively investigated in the past several years and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed from the original 3.8% to currently 22.7%. Such a tremendous achievement in photovoltaic performance is mainly ascribed to the unique photoelectric properties of perovskite semiconductors, such as a favorable bandgap, large light absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and long charge carrier diffusion length. Meanwhile, a dense, uniform, surface-smooth film morphology with a large grain size is also of crucial importance for the perovskite film to achieve its optimal optoelectronic properties. Thus, in the research history of PSCs, much effort has been devoted to achieving high-quality perovskite films.

So far, various strategies have been implemented for the preparation of high-quality perovskite films, such as compositional engineering, solvent engineering, vapor-assisted post-annealing, additive-assisted deposition,etc. Among them, the approach of additive-assisted deposition has been widely adopted due to its ease of handling and practical effectiveness. In this approach, various additives, such as organic molecules, polymers, inorganic or ammonium salts, etc., have been attempted in the precursor solutions to control the as-deposited perovskite films' quality based on various mechanisms. The high doping tolerance, guaranteed by the perovskite's specific crystal and electronic band structures, allows for various kinds of additives to be safely incorporated into perovskite films. This fundamentally offers the additive approach much room for creativity.
Among different kinds of additives, PbI2 is special since it is a constituent part in perovskites. Actually, PbI2 could be present in the resultant perovskite films due to any of the following reasons: (1) purposive addition of PbI2 to the solution precursors, (2) incomplete reaction between PbI2 and amine halides, or overmuch thermal annealing induced evaporation of amine halides, both leading to a deviation from stoichiometry, and (3) weighing errors induced by the purity of raw materials. Seok and co-workers firstly reported that the incorporation of excess PbI2 could be beneficial to passivating the trap states of the resultant MAPbI3 film and improving the corresponding device's initial efficiency. And similar results have been verified by several other groups subsequently in different perovskite material systems. Currently, it is widely believed that excess PbI2 is beneficial to the photovoltaic performance of PSCs and even a prerequisite for some of the reported high efficiency devices. The optimal molar ratios of excess PbI2 to stoichiometric perovskites have been reported to be 3–10%. However, a subsequent study demonstrated that such perovskite films with excess PbI2 were detrimental to the corresponding PSC's long-term stability under real working conditions.
Considering the similar ionic radii of Sr2+ (1.32 Å) and Pb2+ (1.33 Å), several groups including our group recently reported the incorporation of SrI2 or SrCl2 into perovskites with the aim to improve their electronic quality. It can be generally found that Sr2+ has a large doping tolerance (the highest up to 30%) to the perovskite lattice, and the Sr2+ doping can lead to solid efficiency improvement of the PSCs owing to the removal of deep trap states or enhanced perovskite crystallization. Similar studies on other alkaline earth metal cations including Mg2+, Ca2+ and Ba2+ have also been implemented to dope perovskites and similarly higher device efficiency has been achieved, but perhaps due to their larger ionic radius differences compared to Pb2+, their optimized doping contents were normally reported in the range of 1–5%. Beyond efficiency, few studies have investigated the impact of alkaline metal doping on the device's long-term stability, especially when the doping content is below 1%.
In this study, we have investigated the incorporation of a very small amount of CaI2 (<2%) into perovskite films and its impact on the morphological, optical and electronic properties of perovskite films. At the same time, the performance of CaI2 additive based inverted PSCs has been compared with that of excess PbI2 and pristine MAPbI3 based ones. Their different impacts on the optoelectronic properties have been systematically compared. In all of the key parameters reflecting the perovskite film's quality, such as the crystal size, film surface smoothness, trap density and photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, 0.5% CaI2 additive is superior to 5% PbI2, suggesting that CaI2 is a more effective passivator than PbI2 for perovskite films. Moreover, an extremely low additive content of CaI2 holds the key to the formation of the perovskite film with a smoother top surface than the PbI2-additive based one. This is demonstrated to be of critical importance for the long-term stability of highly efficient inverted PSCs.

Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (TEC-15, NSG-Pilkington) substrates were first ultrasonically cleaned with cleaning fluid, deionized water, alcohol, and acetone, respectively, for 20 minutes in sequence. After drying with a stream of nitrogen, the NiMgLiO-based hole extraction layer was then deposited onto FTO-glass by spray pyrolysis at 570 °C. The precursor solution was composed of nickel(II) acetylacetonate in a super-dehydrated acetonitrile and ethanol mixture. After cooling, the NiMgLiO-coated FTO glasses were transferred quickly to a N2 filled glovebox. Then, anti-solvent assisted spin-coating technology was used for the MAPbI3(CaI2)x perovskite film (450 nm) deposition. Typically, a 1.5 M DMF/DMSO (4:1 by volume ratio) solution mixture of PbI2/MAI/CaI2 (1:1:x by molar ratio, x = 0, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02) was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds, followed by the diethyl ether (800 μl) drip during spinning. This was followed by the deposition of a thin PCBM layer (60 nm) by spin-coating its chlorobenzol solution (20 mg mL−1) at 1600 rpm for 30 seconds. Subsequently, a BCP layer (5 nm), used as the buffer layer, was thermally evaporated under high vacuum (<5 × 10−4 Pa). Finally, the device was completed by thermal evaporation of a 100 nm-thick Ag electrode.


Top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a high-resolution SEM (Hitachi-4800) at a 10 kV accelerating voltage. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Kratos Ultra spectrometer (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W). The surface morphologies of the perovskite films were examined by using an atomic force microscope (AFM: Shimadzu, SPM-9700). The crystal structures of the perovskite films were characterized using a Philips X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The UV-vis spectra were obtained from a Shimadzu UV/vis 3600 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Steady-state PL spectra were obtained from a Horiba Jobin Yvon system with an excitation laser beam at 532 nm. Transient PL spectra were recorded with time-correlated single photo counting system (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant GmbH). The photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A solar simulator (Oriel) fitted with a filtered 450 W xenon lamp was used to provide solar simulated radiation. The light intensity of the simulated sunlight was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 by using a standard c-Si solar cell and the effective area of the solar cell was defined to be 0.09 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. The IPCE measurements were carried out with a Newport IPCE system (Newport, USA). The Mott–Schottky plots were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany).


The top-view SEM images have been taken to explore the effect of varying CaI2 contents on the morphology of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1a–c, with the increase of CaI2 content from 0 to 0.5%, dense and smooth films can be obtained, while if the CaI2 content is further increased to above 1%, the perovskite film becomes non-uniform with many pinholes (Fig. 1d and e). At the same time, the perovskite grain size increases largely from originally 260 nm to more than 500 nm by just adding a very little amount of CaI2 (<0.5%), which achieves its highest value of ∼550 nm at 0.5% CaI2 content, as shown in Fig. 1f. This result indicates that the growth manner of the MAPbI3 film is very sensitive to the CaI2 additive. This sensitivity seems to be even higher than those observed for BaI2 and SrI2 additives in previous reports, since the addition of 3% BaI2 additive to MAPbI3 only led to the crystal size increasing from 75.5 nm to 91.0 nm and the SrI2 additive even led to the crystal size decreasing from 100–200 nm to 20–100 nm. We speculate that this may be related to polarity and/or ionic radii difference among CaI2, BaI2 and SrI2, which may largely affect the colloidal seed formation in the precursor solutions. According to most of the previous literature, an increased grain size, which also means a decrease of grain boundaries within the perovskite films, is extremely beneficial for the device to achieve high efficiency and stability.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns have been characterized to evaluate the effect of varying CaI2 content on the perovskite crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 2, when the CaI2 content ranged from 0 to 2%, two strong XRD peaks at 14.08° and 28.41° can be observed for all of the perovskite films, and these peaks should be assigned to the (110) and (220) reflections of the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3. The relative intensities of these two peaks are similar for all of the patterns, suggesting that the incorporation of a small amount of CaI2 does not change the growth direction of perovskite crystals. However, it is obvious that the absolute intensities of both (110) and (220) peaks for all of those patterns increase first and then decrease slightly with the CaI2 content increasing from 0 to 2%, and achieve the highest values at a CaI2 content of 0.5%, which is about twice that of the pristine MAPbI3. The results coherently indicate that 0.5% CaI2 additive is enough to largely improve the perovskite crystallinity, which is consistent with the SEM observations in Fig. 1. Besides, it is noteworthy that small shoulder peaks (highlighted by arrows) appear near the (110) and (220) perovskite peaks when the content of CaI2 is over 1%, suggesting that overmuch CaI2 will induce crystal phase impurity. We speculate that these shoulder peaks may be induced by MACaI3, and a similar phenomenon has been reported by Wang et al. that the MASrCl3 impurity phase with an orthorhombic crystal structure would emerge by incorporating overmuch SrCl2 to MAPbI3.
To explore the effect of the CaI2 additive on the surface composition of perovskite films, XPS measurements have been carried out on the MAPbI3 films with 0.5% and 2% CaI2 additives. The results are shown in Fig. S1. Based on the XPS results, the Ca/Pb atomic ratios on the film surfaces within the typical XPS detection depth of 10 nm are estimated to be 2.76% for the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 film and 14.75% for the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.02 film, both of which are much higher than the designed stoichiometric ratios in the solution precursors. The results indicate that these film surfaces are enriched with Ca2+ ions, which should rather not stay in the film bulk. The phenomenon is quite similar to the previous literature on Sr2+-doped perovskite films.
In order to study the effect of the CaI2 additive on the optical and electronic properties of the resultant perovskite films, we resorted to UV-vis and PL spectroscopy. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films (Fig. 3a) indicate that with the increase of the CaI2 content from 0 to 0.5%, the corresponding light absorption gradually increases in the whole range of 550–800 nm and achieves the highest value at the CaI2 content of 0.5%. This absorbance strengthening should be attributed to the better crystallization. However, if the CaI2 content is further increased to be over 1%, the absorbance decreases slightly, which may be ascribed to the emerged impurity phase and the incomplete film coverage on the glass substrate. Besides, the steepness of the absorption edge could also reflect the crystallization status; low trap density often leads to a steep slope of absorption tails. When we conduct linear fitting on the UV-vis absorbance edges within a 750–775 nm wavelength range, it can be obtained that the slopes increase from 0.01552 nm−1 for the pristine MAPbI3 film to 0.01736 nm−1 for the optimal 0.5% CaI2 doped film, and then decrease to 0.01617 nm−1 for the 2% CaI2 doped film. The results coherently indicate that the most perfect crystallization is achieved for the 0.5% CaI2 doped film. This is consistent with the above SEM and XRD characterization.
Steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra for MAPbI3(CaI2)x perovskite films on glass substrates have been recorded and the results are shown in Fig. 3b and c. In a typical PL experiment, a semiconductor is excited with a light-source that provides photons with an energy larger than the bandgap energy. Once the incoming photons are absorbed, electrons and holes are formed in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. After their relaxation towards the band gap minimums, the electrons and holes recombine under the emission of photons. The real materials normally embody trap states within the band gap, which will act as the recombination centers and lead to PL intensity change and PL peak position shift.
As demonstrated in Fig. 3b, with the increase of the CaI2 content from 0 to 2%, the steady-state PL peak intensity is strengthened firstly and then weakened, and achieves the strongest intensity for the 0.5% CaI2 doped film attributing to its best crystallinity and perhaps least trap density. This improved steady PL intensity accordingly prolongs the carrier lifetime, which has been confirmed by using time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. 3c. The fitted PL lifetimes of various CaI2 doped films have the following order of 0.5%-Ca2+ > 0.25%-Ca2+ > 0%-Ca2+ > 1%-Ca2+ > 2%-Ca2+. The longest PL lifetime (133 ns) for the 0.5% CaI2 doped film should be associated with the suppression of trap-induced recombination, while the decrease of PL lifetimes for the >1% CaI2 based films should be attributed to phase impurity within those films.
With the CaI2 additive based perovskite films, a series of inverted PSCs with the configuration of “FTO/NiMgLiO/MAPbI3(CaI2)x/PCBM/BCP/Ag” have been fabricated. The device structure is shown in Fig. 4a. The J–V curves of the champion cells tested under 1 sun simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4b and the performance parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). As expected, the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.3% is achieved at 0.5% CaI2 content, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.794. It is noteworthy that when the CaI2 content increases from 0 to 0.5%, the VOC increases from 1.03 V to 1.11 V, with the JSC increasing from 20.6 mA cm−2 to 21.9 mA cm−2, the FF from 0.76 to 0.794 and the PCE from 16.1% to 19.3%; when the CaI2 content further increases from 0.5% to 2%, the VOC, JSC and FF decrease significantly to 0.96 V, 6.0 mA cm−2 and 0.528, resulting in a much degraded PCE of 3.0%. It is noteworthy that all of the devices based on varying CaI2 contents exhibit almost no hysteresis, which should benefit from the interfacial layer's excellent charge extraction capability and surface traps' passivation by CaI2. As a good reference, the KI doped perovskite films could remove the hysteresis of the devices regardless of the perovskite compositions and device structures by decreasing the perovskite films' trap state density. From the statistic performance distributions of 16 devices for each CaI2 additive content shown in Fig. 4c–f, the reliability of the performance parameters' changing tendencies dependent on the CaI2 additive content could be clearly recognized.
From above, we know that a suitable amount of CaI2 additive can effectively enhance the perovskite film's quality and the corresponding device's performance. However, the CaI2 additive content should be strictly controlled within 0.5%. This small range of the additive content has normally been ignored in previous reports when using alkaline metal halides as additives to perovskites. Nevertheless, from the literature and this work, it is commonly recognized that the incorporation of alkaline metal halides does have positive effects. The commonly observed phenomenon is that the perovskite films with these controlled additives can achieve improved carrier lifetimes, which will be beneficial for efficient charge collection. Based on the similarity, it is easy to associate with another divalent metal halide, i.e., PbI2, which has been reported as an effective defect passivator in various perovskite films many times.
In order to identify the difference between CaI2 and PbI2, three kinds of controlled PSCs based on the pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 films have been carefully compared. The J–V curves of their champion devices are shown in Fig. 5a and the performance parameters are listed in Table S2. The device based on MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 achieves the highest efficiency of 19.3% among the three compared samples, which is 20% higher than that based on pristine MAPbI3 with the efficiency of 16.1% and 7% higher than that based on MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 with the efficiency of 18.0%. This comparison reflects that CaI2 is more effective than PbI2 to improve the device performance. If looking into the detailed performance parameters, all of the JSC, VOC and FF for the device based on MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 are slightly higher than those of the one based on MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05. These variations are consistent with the statistical averages shown in Fig. S3, proving the data's reliability and repeatability.
First, the measured JSC improvement matches well with the integrated JSC values from the IPCE data shown in Fig. S4. It should be ascribed to higher crystallinity which is beneficial to enhancing absorption and decreasing charge recombination. Obviously, the enhanced absorption has been confirmed by using the UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. S5a, while the decreased charge recombination could be proved by the detected longer PL carrier lifetime and smaller dark current, which will be discussed later in Fig. 5b and c.
Second, the VOC of the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based PSC achieves a high value of 1.11 V, higher than that of the pristine MAPbI3 based device (1.03 V) and MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 based device (1.08 V). From this parameter, it is found that the CaI2 additive is more effective than PbI2. In order to address the origin of improved VOC, we performed Mott–Schottky analysis on three controlled solar cells. Herein, the relationship between 1/C2 and V can be described as the following equation.
(1)
where
C is the measured capacitance in the dark, A is the active area, V is the applied bias, ε is the relative permittivity, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, q is the elementary charge and N is the free carrier concentration. Herein, the built-in potentials (Vbi) can be calculated using the intercepts of the linear region with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plots, which are equal to 0.77 V, 0.82 V and 0.87 V for the cells based on pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005, respectively (Fig. 5d). This result shows a similar trend with the VOC values from the J–V curves. Given that the built-in field assists in the charge separation of the photo-generated carriers and suppresses electron–hole recombination, the higher Vbi of the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 device should be associated with lower charge recombination attributed to the high quality perovskite film.

To further investigate the physical origins of the above Vbi difference, the I–V responses of three different simplified perovskite devices based on pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005, with the structure of FTO/perovskite/Au, have been tested in the dark. As shown in Fig. 5e, at the low voltage range, the current increases linearly with the increase of voltage, which demonstrates an ohmic regime. Further increasing the voltage over the kink-point, the current reveals a rapid nonlinear increase, which is known as the trap-filled regime. Herein, the kink-point voltage is known as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) which can be used to calculate the trap state density (Ntrap) with the equation of Ntrap = VTFL(2εε0)/eL2, where e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), L is the perovskite film thickness (∼450 nm), the vacuum permittivity (ε0) equals to 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1 and the relative permittivity (ε) for perovskite is ∼35. From Fig. 5e, it can be identified that VTFL for devices based on pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 is 3.01 V, 2.12 V and 1.75 V, respectively. The corresponding Ntrap is accordingly calculated to be 5.76 × 1016 cm−3, 4.06 × 1016 cm−3 and 3.35 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. It is obvious that the trap state densities are both decreased after the MAPbI3 films being passivated by PbI2 or CaI2, but the passivation of CaI2 is more effective than that of PbI2. It is noteworthy that, the improved quality of perovskite films is consistent with the corresponding steady-state PL and time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. S5b and 5b. The PL intensities of the three compared samples have the following order of MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 > MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 > pristine MAPbI3 (Fig. S5b). The same trend is found for their PL lifetimes, which are fitted to be ∼65 ns, 98 ns and 133 ns for pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005, respectively (Fig. 5b).
The lower charge recombination of the CaI2 additive based sample can also be verified by using the dark J–V curves as depicted in Fig. 5c. Compared with the solar cells based on pristine MAPbI3 (J0 = 1.32 × 10−9 A cm−2) and MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 (J0 = 3.27 × 10−10 A cm−2), the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based device shows a relatively lower saturation current density (J0 = 9.18 × 10−11 A cm−2) which means a lower charge recombination. This could also explain why the optimal VOC was achieved by MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005, according to the equation of VOC = Aln(Jph/J0 + 1), where A is a constant, Jph is the photocurrent density and J0 is the saturation current density.
Third, the FF of the three compared devices based on pristine MAPbI3, MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 is 0.760, 0.790 and 0.794, respectively. FF is determined by the shunt resistance (RSH) and series resistance (RS) of the solar cells. The RSH of the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based PSC is 12.44 kΩ cm2 which is obviously larger than those of the devices based on MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 (2.53 kΩ cm2) and pristine MAPbI3 (1.55 kΩ cm2), suggesting that the charge recombination has been minimized by 0.5% CaI2 passivation. Besides, RS for the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based PSC is 1.08 Ω cm2 which is the smallest among those of the three samples, possibly implying the accelerated charge transfer due to fewer grain boundaries and smaller trap density.
In addition to the enhanced efficiency, the PSC based on MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 demonstrates better stability than that based on pristine MAPbI3 and MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05. As shown in Fig. 6, the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based solar cell retains 93% of its initial PCE after 300 hours of light soaking (100 mW cm−2, provided by white LED light equipped with a UV blocking filter) in a N2 filled glovebox, which is superior to the devices based on pristine MAPbI3 (87% of its initial PCE) or MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 (74% of its initial PCE). It is noteworthy that this stability order is not the same as their initial PCEs. After PbI2 passivation, the crystal size of MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 is enlarged than that of pristine MAPbI3 (see the SEM images in Fig. 7) which is consistent with the literature. However, the drawback of adding PbI2 also emerged, detrimental to the stability under real working conditions.
The improved stability of the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based solar cell may be partially ascribed to the lower doping content of CaI2 (0.5%) than PbI2 (5%), especially considering the intrinsic instability of PbI2 under illumination; in addition, the smooth surface passivated by CaI2 may play a dominant role. Although the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 film (550 nm) has a larger average grain size than the pristine MAPbI3 (210 nm) and MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 (410 nm) films, its surface morphology is even smoother than those of the latter two which can be verified by AFM measurements. As shown in Fig. S6, the root mean square roughness (Rrms) for the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 film is 10.2 nm which is smaller than 11.5 nm for the pristine MAPbI3 film and 15.7 nm for the MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 film. As can seen in the SEM observations in Fig. 7, the MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 film (even the pristine MAPbI3 film) shows numerous nano-sized sharp protuberances with evident white color (highlighted by the circles). These protuberances are normally assigned to PbI2 crystals in the previous literature. The smooth surface prevents direct contact between corrosive halides and Ag electrodes by inserting a thin layer of PCBM (∼60 nm) in-between as depicted in Fig. 7 (d–f). Obviously, the 60 nm PCBM is not thick enough to fully cover the PbI2 protuberances as highlighted by the circles in Fig. 7d and e. To further verify the robust stability associated with the smooth surface of MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005, we compared the two Ag electrodes peeled off from the samples of MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05/PCBM/Ag and MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005/PCBM/Ag after thermal aging at 85 °C for three days. Their top-view SEM images and EDX results, as depicted in Fig. 8a–f, demonstrate that the Ag electrodes from the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 sample have been better protected by PCBM than those of the MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 sample. A lot of big holes are observed in the Ag electrode and much more I element is detected in the MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 sample, while in the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 sample, the Ag electrode's morphology looks much smoother and less contaminated (the EDX signal owing to the I element is much weaker). Such complete coverage prevents the released species from MAPbI3 from eroding the Ag electrode, which is confirmed by the XRD results shown in Fig. 8g. It is found that in the MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 sample, the peeled Ag electrode contains a big fraction of AgI, while in the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 sample, the AgI component is much less.

In conclusion, this study provides an effective CaI2 additive approach to obtain high quality perovskite films. With the incorporation of a very small amount (0.5%) of CaI2, uniform and dense perovskite films with an average grain size of ∼550 nm can be obtained, suggesting that the addition of CaI2 is extremely effective in enhancing crystallinity. The measurement of optical and PL spectra demonstrates that such Ca2+-doped perovskite films show excellent optical and electronic properties attributing to low trap state density. The champion PSC based on the above high quality MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 layer achieved a very high PCE of 19.3%, which is remarkably superior to those of the devices based on pristine MAPbI3 and MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05. In addition, compared with the MAPbI3(PbI2)0.05 based device, the MAPbI3(CaI2)0.005 based PSC reveals a superior long-term stability owing to smoother film surface facilitating full coverage by PCBM. The much lower additive content, more improved photoelectric properties and higher efficiency and stability of the corresponding device, all indicate that CaI2 is a more effective passivator than PbI2 of perovskite films for PSC applications.
