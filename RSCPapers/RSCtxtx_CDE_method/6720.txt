Three low-band-gap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers containing benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (BDT), 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (TDP) or 3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (FDP) were designed and synthesized. Their thermal stability, optical and electrochemical properties, device performances for organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells were systematically investigated. The device performances were significantly enhanced by the introduction of conjugated alkylthienyl side chains to the BDT core and the substitution of thiophene with furan moieties in polymer backbone. Compared to alkoxy side chains, conjugated alkylthienyl chains resulted in higher coplanarity, increased thermal stability (Td increased from 364 °C to 417 °C) and a lower HOMO level (from −5.10 eV to −5.24 eV). The incorporation of furan evidently improved the polymer solubility, leading to a finer phase separation morphology as proved by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. After optimization, the designed polymer showed excellent performance in both OFETs and PSCs with an optimal hole mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a high power conversion efficiency of 5.54%.

In recent years, organic electronic devices using semiconducting conjugated polymers have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest. These polymers demonstrate unique advantages such as low cost, light weight and potential applications in flexible and large-area devices, including organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). In the last decade, significantly improved mobilities of OFETs and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been achieved. In spite of the recent advances, the stability, processing issues and especially the device performance, still remain major factors that limit cost-effective mass production of PSCs. The synthetic versatility of organic chemistry allows the optimization of new low-band-gap polymers (LBPs) to further improve the device performance. Donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymerization has proven to be an efficient way to obtain materials with desired optical and electronic properties which can be precisely controlled by molecular design via adjusting electron-rich or electron-deficient units to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Solubility is another essential property which enables polymer solution-processability and allows for optimal film morphology. Solubility could be achieved by the introduction of solubilizing side-chains. However, long or bulky alkyl substituents could increase π-stacking distances, thereby hindering intermolecular packing, decreasing the polymer crystallinity in thin films and eventually leading to inefficient charge transport. Therefore, for application of LBPs in solution-processed organic electronic devices, a delicate balance is required between the polymer crystallinity and solubility. It is challenging to choose optimum side chains to achieve desired solubility without sacrificing the carrier transport or photovoltaic performance. For example, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and DPP based 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (TDP) have emerged as important n-type building blocks for active materials used in OFETs and PSCs. They both demonstrate excellent coplanarity, especially TDP which has proven to be a more planar moiety due to minimal steric repulsions of thiophene with the DPP core. The increased coplanarity requires long and bulky alkyl side chains to provide enough solubility, which will, however, hinder the formation of a interpenetrating network when blended with fullerene derivatives in polymer solar cells. In addition, the increased π-stacking distance and reduced intermolecular ordering, as aforementioned, will result in lower charge carrier mobilities. In order to solve the problem, Fréchet et al. have synthesized a new comonomer 3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (FDP) by replacing the original thiophene ring in TDP with furans. They showed that the introduction of furans can dramatically reduce the amount of aliphatic side-chains necessary to solubilize polymer backbones that otherwise require the presence of long and bulky substituents. By using the new polymer, they achieved an optimized PCE of 5% and very recently, a high PCE of 6.5% was reported by using the polymer containing FDP. The OFETs performances of FDP-based LBPs have also been investigated. Li et al. reported several solution processable FDP-based LBPs and these materials have exhibited high performance in p-type OFETs. Although FDP-containing polymers demonstrate great potential in the application of both OEFTs and PSCs, few polymers have been reported to show both good carrier mobility and excellent photovoltaic performance simultaneously. In this work, aiming to obtain materials with such remarkable dual properties, we designed three D–A copolymers based on TDP, FDP and benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (BDT). BDT has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure, which can easily realize ordered π–π stacking in a large domain size, making it one of the most employed donor moieties recently used for polymers in PSCs. The use of planar BDT and DPP based monomers are expected to result in copolymers showing enhanced coplanarity, carrier mobility and photovoltaic performance. In addition, the introduction of conjugated alkylthienyl side chains to the BDT core (BDT-T) results in a more planar configuration than BDT with alkoxy side chains, leading to an improved PSC performance. Herein, we carried out a systematic investigation on the effects of conjugated alkylthienyl side-chains on the polymer optical and electrical properties. The performance of OFETs and PSCs based on FDP or TDP containing polymers were also studied. In general, we have demonstrated new polymers showing excellent performance in both OFETs and OPVs due to the incorporation of π-conjugated side-chains and the substitution of thiophene with a furan block for improved polymer solubility and morphology.


The synthetic routes to obtain the monomers and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. Monomers 3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (1), 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (TDP-Br), 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene (4), 4,8-dehydrobenzo[l,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (5) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT-O) were prepared according to the literature. In order to achieve good solubility, a branched 2-ethylhexyl group was introduced to the FDP core with a yield of 80.1%. Bromination of compound 2 was then carried out using NBS in chloroform at room temperature to get monomer 3. Alkylthienyl groups were introduced to the BDT core as the side-chains. The bis(trimethylstannane) of compound 6 was obtained in a simple and straightforward reaction with chlorotrimethylstannane. Finally, D–A structured copolymers PBDT-FDP, PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-T-FDP were synthesized by Stille polycondensations. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers are listed in Table 1. Furan-containing polymers exhibit excellent solubility in commonly used solvents at room temperature, including tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CF), and chlorobenzene (CB), while thiophene-based PBDT-T-TDP shows limited solubility in THF, CB and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) without heating.

Thermal stability of the three polymers was investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, all these copolymers show good thermal stability under nitrogen with 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of 364, 417 and 417 °C for PBDT-FDP, PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-T-FDP, respectively. The introduction of alkylthienyl side chains significantly improved the thermal stability of the BDT-based polymers, which is consistent with previous reports. In the DSC measurement (Fig. S1), no obvious phase transitions below the decomposition temperatures were observed. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDT-FDP, PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-T-FDP in dilute chloroform solution and in thin films cast from chloroform are shown in Fig. 2, with the values of absorption maxima and edges listed in Table 2. The absorption peaks in the short and long wavelength ranges are attributed to the π–π* transition band and intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor monomers, respectively. The sharp absorption peaks at ∼750 nm indicate a strong ICT interaction and a low band-gap. We noticed that PBDT-T-FDP exhibits a red-shifted absorption maximum compared to PBDT-FDP, which may be attributed to the more effective π-electron delocalization that results from the extended conjugation of the alkylthienyl side chains of the 2D conjugated polymers. PBDT-T-TDP shows the most broad absorption range up to 900 nm. The significant broadened absorption of TDP based polymer is consistent with the previous report that the replacement of furan units with thiophene can lower the polymer band-gap. The limited solubility of PBDT-T-TDP may also lead to a certain degree of packing in even dilute solution, resulting in enhanced absorption. We observed that all the absorption spectra of polymer films are broadened and the absorption edges are red-shifted compared to those in solution, which have been observed for DPP-based D–A copolymers previously. However, It is worth noting that the absorption maxima of PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-T-FDP films show an unusual blue-shift to the spectra in solution state due to uncertain reasons. Judging from the absorption edges of polymer films, the optical band-gaps of the three polymers were calculated as 1.44 eV (PBDT-FDP), 1.35 eV (PBDT-T-TDP) and 1.41 eV (PBDT-T-FDP), which are all around the optimal value of 1.4 eV calculated to be the band-gap for achieving the highest PCE.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to study the electrochemical properties of the synthesized polymers. Typically, a three-electrode cell equipped with a Pt plate coated with polymer as working electrode, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a Pt-wire counter electrode was employed. The measurements were conducted in anhydrous acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Ferrocene was used as the internal standard (E1/2(ferrocene) = 0.71 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3, with the corresponding data summarized in Table 2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated according to the equationEHOMO/LUMO = [−(Eonset − 0.71) − 4.8] eV. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PBDT-FDP, PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-T-FDP were −5.10/−3.50 eV, −5.21/−3.60 eV and −5.24/−3.56 eV, respectively. All these values were in the desirable range for use in OPV applications. From the results, we concluded that the replacement of alkoxy side chains with alkylthienyl ones can lower the HOMO level, which will result in increased open circuit voltages (Voc) for PSCs. Note that the band-gap measured from CV is slightly larger than that obtained from the absorption spectrum, which has been observed in previous works for other BDT-based polymers.


The new polymers were characterized by using bottom-gate, bottom-contact OTFTs via solution processing. Detailed information of fabrication and characterization is shown in the experimental section. Different annealing temperatures were tried to optimize the morphology for achieving the best mobility (Table S1). The output and transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. 4 and the best values of hole mobilities, threshold voltages and on/off ratios are summarized in Table 3. The hole mobility of this P-channel transistor is 0.017–0.054 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-FDP, 0.001–0.107 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-T-TPD and 0.062–0.158 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-T-FDP under different annealing temperatures.

PBDT-T-FDP exhibits significantly higher mobility than both PBDT-FDP and PBDT-T-TPD. The better performance may partially be attributed to a higher degree of coplanarity induced by the conjugated alkylthienyl side chains. In addition, replacing the thiophene ring with furan was reported to enhance carrier mobility due to stronger intermolecular interactions and a highly interconnected thin film morphology. The correlation between annealing temperature and hole mobilities is shown in Fig. 5. With elevated annealing temperature, the hole mobilities of all OTFTs begin to increase, and reach a peak at the temperature of 80 °C, then gradually decrease at higher annealing temperatures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the morphology change of pristine polymer films annealed at different temperatures (Fig. S2).
Although all the morphologies have comparable features and feature sizes for different annealing temperatures, at the optimal annealing temperature, the contours of the domains are most clear. According to previous works on DPP-containing materials for OFETs, this phenomenon indicates the increased crystallinity of the polymer thin films.

The bulk hetero-junction PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). The device optimization was carried out by trying different solvents, additives, material concentrations and ratios (Table S2 and S3). PBDT-T-FDP shows excellent solubility in both o-DCB and CF due to the incorporation of furan moiety and conjugated side chains, while PBDT-FDP has a moderate solubility in both solvents and PBDT-T-TDP has poor solubility in o-DCB, but it can be dissolved better in CF. PSCs using o-DCB and CF were fabricated and their performances were compared (see Table S2). Improved fill factors (FF) were observed for all the devices using o-DCB than those using CF. For both PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-FDP, devices using o-DCB show better performance than those using CF. For PBDT-T-FDP, devices demonstrated excellent performance when using both solvents, with devices using CF giving a slightly higher PCE. Therefore we chose CF as the optimal solvent for PBDT-T-FDP and o-DCB for both PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-FDP. Since 2007, additives have been widely used to optimize the morphology of BHJ PSCs, and DIO (1,8-diiodooctane) has been reported as one of the most effective additives. After the inclusion of DIO, apparently enhanced PCEs were observed for PBDT-T-FDP and PBDT-FDP based devices. The performance enhancement is typically observed for PSCs using solvent additives which are considered to improve the polymer/fullerene phase separation and increase intermolecular packing. For PBDT-T-TDP, almost no change in PCE was observed, implying that the morphology change induced by DIO is not as apparent as that for the other two polymers. Because a certain degree of packing was already formed in the solution state due to limited solubility as indicated by Fig. S3, the improvement of intermolecular packing by using DIO is less efficient than for the other two polymers. In order to improve the short circuit current density (Jsc), we used PC71BM instead of PC61BM to enhance the absorption. As we expected, PSCs using PC71BM obtained higher Jsc and PCE values than those using PC61BM after the addition of DIO. The highest PCE of 5.15% was achieved for PBDT-T-FDP based PSCs. It is worth noting that PBDT-T-FDP:PC71BM has a lower PCE than PBDT-T-FDP:PC61BM before using additives, which has been observed in a previous report. In order to further improve device efficiency, we investigated the effect of mixed solvents on device performance (Fig. 6b). We found that the optimal condition is using a mixed solvent (o-DCB:CF = 1:1) together with 2% DIO. As a result, the PCEs of both PBDT-T-TDP and PBDT-T-FDP based devices were significantly improved. Especially the optimal PCE of the PBDT-T-FDP based device reached a value of 5.54%, mainly due to the improvement of Jsc. However, the PCE of PBDT-FDP based devices decreased from 3.42% to 2.97% due to the reduced FF (from 62% to 51%), which is possibly owing to the less ordered intermolecular packing induced by the addition of low-boiling-point CF. We also observed that more reproducible data can be achieved by using mixed solvents. Note that during the preparation of this manuscript, Yang et al. reported a polymer with a similar structure of our PBDT-T-FDP and obtained an average PCE of 5.5%, which is in accordance with our results.

To evaluate the photo-response of the three polymers and calibrate the Jsc data, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the efficient devices (PBDT-FDP with o-DCB + 2% DIO, PBDT-T-TDP with o-DCB/CF = 1:1 + 2% DIO, PBDT-T-FDP with o-DCB/CF = 1:1 + 2% DIO) were measured (Fig. 7). PBDT-FDP and PBDT-T-TDP based PSCs have a similar low EQE value of about 20–25% at 650–800 nm, and show significantly higher EQE at 350–650 nm. In contrast, PBDT-T-FDP based PSCs have a broad and uniform EQE response of 40–45% over 400–800 nm. The Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with AM 1.5G reference spectra is within a 7% error compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. The absorbance from 600 nm to 800 nm is mainly attributed to the absorption of polymers. The improved EQE in this range for PBDT-T-FDP based devices can be attributed to an improved polymer network morphology.

Film morphologies of polymer:PC71BM blends were investigated using AFM, as shown in Fig. 8. For all three polymers, increased roughness was observed after the addition of DIO, indicating more developed phase segregated structures. Before using DIO, all polymers show distinctive grainy structures implying limited charge transport hindered by discontinuous grain boundaries. PBDT-T-TDP film has a larger grain size than PBDT-FDP film, possibly due to its lower solubility. For PBDT-T-FDP film, the gaps between grains are most evident due to the use of low-boiling-point CF, which makes the carrier hopping between grains become extremely difficult and leads to the worst hole mobility and device performance among the three devices, as shown in Table S3. The hole mobilities of the three polymer films were measured using space charge limited current (SCLC) method and the results are consistent with our hypothesis (Fig. S4 and Table S4). When processed with DIO, the discontinuous grains merged and the film became smooth, as shown in image F (Fig. 8). The use of high-boiling-point DIO allows the formation of well developed phase segregation and bi-continuous network structures, which are responsible for the dramatically improved efficiency. However, we noticed that after using DIO, the three blended films show similar surface features. Thus we used TEM to further explore the bulk morphology of the three films (Fig. 9). We can observe that PBDT-T-TDP:PCBM blended film shows distinctive polymer fibers and large domain sizes due to its limited solubility, while well dissolved PBDT-T-FDP exhibits a much finer film structure and a domain size around 20 nm which is close to the polymer exciton diffusion length, implying efficient charge separation and high photovoltaic performance (PCE = 5.51%). PBDT-FDP film shows a moderate extent of phase separation in between the other two. Based on the observation, we concluded that the solubility of the polymers plays a critical role in determining the film morphology, especially the polymer/fullerene phase separation domain size. It is worth noting that although the three polymers demonstrated excellent hole mobility, no apparent diffraction peaks were observed in their X-Ray Diffraction spectra.


A series of donor–acceptor copolymers containing BDT, TDP or FDP were prepared using Stille cross-coupling reactions. All these polymers have high molecular weight, good thermal stability and desired band-gaps in the range of 1.37–1.44 eV for efficient photon harvesting. The device performances were significantly enhanced by the introduction of conjugated alkylthienyl side chains on the BDT core and the substitution of thiophene with furan moiety in the polymer backbone. The use of conjugated alkylthienyl chains resulted in polymers with higher coplanarity, increased thermal stability and lower HOMO levels than polymers using alkoxy side chains. The incorporation of furan evidently improved the polymer solubility, leading to a finer phase separation morphology, as proved by TEM results. After optimization, the designed polymer showed excellent performance in both OFETs and PSCs with a high hole mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of 5.54%.

Synthesis of PBDT-FDP: in a 50 mL reaction tube, BDT-O (0.23 g, 0.3 mmol) and monomer 3 (0.13 g, 0.3 mol), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.02 g, 0.08 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (0.01 g, 0.01 mmol) were added. The mixture was subjected to three cycles of evacuation and admission of argon, dry toluene (5 mL) and dry DMF (0.5 mL) were injected by syringe. After stirring at 110 °C for 12 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and precipitated in methanol (130 mL). The precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol (24 h) and hexane (24 h) in a Soxhlet apparatus to remove residual oligomers and catalyst. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform (10 h). The chloroform fraction was concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was filtered and dried in vacuum at 80 °C overnight.

A bottom-gate, bottom-contact OTFT device was fabricated using a heavily n-doped Si wafer with a 300 nm SiO2 layer (with a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) to serve as the substrate and dielectric layer, respectively. The bottom Au S-D electrodes (30 nm) were sputtered and patterned (by a lift off technique). The device channel lengths were varied from 20 to 50 μm, and the channel width was maintained at 1.4 mm. Before deposition of the polymer layer, the gate dielectrics were treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 120 °C for 3 h to form an OTS self-assembled monolayer. The treated substrates were rinsed successively with hexane, ethanol, and chloroform. A polymer layer was deposited on the OTS-treated Si–SiO2 substrates by spin-coating of a chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1). The spin-coated thin films were then annealed for 60 min at different annealing temperatures to finish the device fabrication. Device characterization of the fabricated OTFTs was carried out under N2 using a Keithley 4200 Semiconductor Characterization System. The field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the equation IDS = (μWCi/2L)(VG − VT)2, where IDS is the drain-source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, VG is the gate voltage, and VT is the threshold voltage.


Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatments in detergent, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol. The organic residue was further removed by treating with UV-ozone for 10 min. A thin film of PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm) was spin-coated on ITO substrates and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. Blends of PBDT-T-TPDs and PCBM with different ratios (the optimal condition is dissolving 5 mg polymer and 10 mg PCBM in 1 mL solvent) were dissolved in chloroform or o-DCB containing 2% (v/v) DIO, filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter, spin-coated at different speeds for 40 s; 0.6 nm LiF (0.2 A s−1) and 100 nm Al (2 A s−1) layers were then thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Kheithey 2400 (I–V) Digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using a certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc, SolarCellScan100).
