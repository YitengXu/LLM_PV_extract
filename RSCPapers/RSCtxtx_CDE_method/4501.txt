Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have been developing rapidly in the past several years, and their power conversion efficiency has reached over 20%, nearing that of polycrystalline silicon solar cells. Because the diffusion length of the hole in perovskites is longer than that of the electron, the performance of the device can be improved by using an electron transporting layer, e.g., TiO2, ZnO and TiO2/Al2O3. Nano-structured electron transporting materials facilitate not only electron collection but also morphology control of the perovskites. The properties, morphology and preparation methods of perovskites are reviewed in the present article. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the structure and property will benefit the precise control of the electron transporting process and thus further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been investigated enthusiastically in the past two decades due to their excellent optical and electronic properties. Organometallic halide perovskites can be written as ABX3, where X is a halogen ion (I−, Br−, Cl−), A is an organic ammonium ion, such as CH3NH3+ (MA+) and NHCHNH3+ (FA+), and B is Pb2+ or Sn2+. The most popular perovskites, MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx, both have a direct band gap of ∼1.55 eV, corresponding to an absorption onset of 800 nm and an intense absorption over the entire visible region. In 2009, a perovskite was first used as a semiconductor sensitizer in a liquid dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%. A solid-state mesoscopic solar cell based on MAPbI3 was reported in 2012, whose PCE was enhanced to 9.7%. Snaith et al. improved the PCE to 10.9% using Al2O3 to replace the mesoporous TiO2 as the pure scaffold. Grätzel et al. fabricated a high-quality perovskite film by employing a two-step sequential deposition method, and consequently obtained a high PCE of over 15%. Yang et al. reported a planar PSC with a PCE of 19.3% using precise interface engineering. Recently, the highest PCE of as high as 20.1% has been reported, nearing that of polycrystalline silicon solar cells.

Based on the unique properties of perovskites, two typical architectures are usually constructed, i.e., mesoscopic structures and planar p-(i)-n junction structures. Fig. 1 shows the schematic device structure and charge pathway. It was found that the diffusion length for the hole was longer than that for the electron in MAPbI3. To compensate for the shorter electron diffusion length, an extra electron transporting layer (ETL) is used, so that electrons separated from photo-generated excitons can be injected into the ETL, then collected by a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. In the case of mesoporous TiO2, electrons can be transported not only through the perovskite but also through the nanostructure scaffold, leading to a better charge collection. Besides this, the ETL should also serve as a hole-blocking layer (HBL) in both architectures to prevent the hole from reaching the FTO electrode.
The design of the ETL is crucial for determining the performance of PSCs. Generally, to make a highly efficient perovskite solar cell, the series resistance (RS) should be small while the shunt resistance (Rsh) and recombination resistance (Rrec) should be large. RS normally reflects the resistance of the photoactive layer and electrode, along with the contact resistance at each interface, which affects the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the device. Thus, the energy level of the ETL is supposed to be well-matched to that of the perovskite to facilitate electron injection and hole blocking simultaneously, and the electron mobility of the material is required to be high enough. In addition, the ETL should be porous to enhance the sufficient infiltration of the absorber. On the other hand, Rsh closely correlates with the leakage current due to the charge recombination or pinhole. Thus the HBL should be very thin and dense with few defects to obtain a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Recombination can also reduce photogenerated electrons and result in a lower JSC and thus the recombination should be suppressed to give a higher VOC and JSC.
Nanoscale semiconductors, including TiO2, ZnO and insulators, such as Al2O3 and ZrO2, are employed in PSCs as the ETL or scaffold. This review includes three parts according to the ETL material: TiO2, ZnO and others. In each part, we systematically summarize the morphology control and modification of the nanostructures. A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the structure (geometry and morphology) and properties could guide us to further optimize the design of ETLs and to improve device performances. Moreover, the present study on low-temperature fabrication of ETLs will help us to explore new practical methods for low-cost and high-performance PSCs for mass production.

TiO2 has been proved to be a leading electron transporting material (ETM) in PSCs, with a conduction band minimum (CBM) of 4.1 eV (ref. 19) and a large band gap (3.2 eV for the anatase phase and 3.0 eV for the rutile phase). Its CBM is slightly lower than that of CH3NH3PbI3, guaranteeing electron injection from the perovskite absorber to the ETL through direct contact, and its valence band maximum (VBM) is at a very low position, which gives TiO2 outstanding hole blocking properties. Besides this, the preparation and morphology control of TiO2 has matured and been reported by most researchers. All these factors make TiO2 a widely used material for ETLs in PSCs. There are two kinds of TiO2 morphologies applied in PSCs, compact layers and mesoporous layers, whose properties such as energy levels, porosity and electron mobility, can be improved by various modifications, including different synthesis methods, doping, size/geometrical shape control and so on, as shown in Fig. 2.


A thin compact TiO2 film (10–100 nm) can be used as an excellent HBL, due to its energy level alignment and high electron mobility (25 cm2 V−1 s−1). It was found that the electron diffusion length of the compact layer is over 1 μm, illustrating that the thickness may not be the key factor. Actually, the defects and crystal boundaries of compact TiO2 act as electron traps, which would increase the charge recombination, reduce VOC and destablize the device. In addition, there exist pinholes and cracks in the compact layer allowing intimate contact between the FTO electrode and perovskite or hole transporting layer (HTL), which further deteriorates the hole-blocking capability. Therefore, a thin uniform TiO2 HBL with few defects and pinholes is important to achieve high efficiency.

Traditionally, as widely applied in DSSCs, a TiO2 HBL is prepared by spin coating, spray pyrolysis, or sol–gel methods. An ethanol (or 2-propanol) solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (∼0.2 M), as a precursor, is spin coated or sprayed in short pulses onto a clean FTO glass substrate, then hydrolyzed and converted into TiO2. In the spray pyrolysis method, the substrate should be placed on a hotplate at about 500 °C. The thickness of the layer can be tuned by altering the concentration of the precursor, spin speed or the number of pulses. In the sol–gel method, a dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles was obtained by adding titanium(IV) isopropoxide dropwise into dilute nitric acid under constant stirring and heating. Only using solution and thermal treatment endues the three methods with easy operation and low cost. However, in many cases, pinholes, cracks and gaps between the TiO2 and FTO appear after the heat treatment (>450 °C) subsequent to the deposition, which is attributed to further crystallization and thermal stress, especially after sintering the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold. A comparison of the research shows that the HBL made by spin coating is highly porous, and that made by spray pyrolysis leads to good coverage and blocking action. Strikingly, the solar cells made with a porous HBL reached slightly higher PCEs, illustrating that porous HBLs can also prevent contact between the FTO and the HTL.
Although a compact perovskite layer can also reduce recombination, a high-quality TiO2 HBL is still needed for better blocking properties and reproducibility. Wu et al. fabricated a TiO2 compact layer with a much lower density of nanoscale pinholes by atomic layer deposition (ALD). TiO2 was deposited in pulse mode at 200 °C using tetrakis(dimethylamino) titanium (TDMAT) and H2O as the Ti and O sources, respectively. The ALD-TiO2-based device exhibited a high Rsh and at least 50% higher PCE compared with the device comprising the TiO2 layer fabricated by the solution method. Magnetron sputtering (MS) is another general way to fabricate TiO2 HBLs. A Ti film, coated on FTO glass by radio frequency magnetron sputtering from the Ti target, is oxidized and converted to a thin TiO2 compact film during the sintering process. A PSC with a TiO2 compact film prepared by thermal oxidation has a lower dark current density, lower RS and higher Rrec than when prepared by two-step sintering, resulting in a higher JSC and FF but the thermal oxidation process might leave a residue of Ti nanoparticles, consequently increasing the recombination of the charge. A TiO2 compact film can also be prepared by directly sputtering the TiO2 target onto the FTO glass, leading to a direct and full-range contact between MS-TiO2 and the FTO, which contributes to fast and effective transportation of electrons, leading to a high JSC. The morphology of the TiO2 compact layers fabricated by different methods is shown in Fig. 3.
Another way to improve the properties of TiO2 compact films is doping. Wang et al. added magnesium acetate tetrahydrate into a TiCl4 solution and obtained a Mg-doped TiO2 compact film. Mg in the blocking layer elevated the position of the CBM of TiO2, contributing to the improvement of VOC. Besides this, there was also a thin layer of magnesium oxide and magnesium hydroxide formed at the surface of the HBL, which could suppress the charge recombination at the compact TiO2 surface, achieving a further improvement of VOC. A low level of Al-doping by adding an aluminium isopropoxide precursor to Ti(IV) isopropoxide solution, can reduce non-stoichiometric oxygen-induced defects in TiO2, which are attributed to the substitution of two Al(III) ions for two adjacent Ti(III) ions with an oxygen vacancy. The substitution removes deep electronic traps and sub-band gap states, enhances the conductivity by orders of magnitude, and improves the stability of the devices. A Nb-doped TiO2 compact layer was prepared via spray pyrolysis. Thus, both the blocking effect and forward electron transport were improved. It was found that Nb doping decreased the RS of the device, resulting in a higher JSC and FF. A high-efficiency device has been realized by employing an yttrium-doped TiO2 compact layer. The existence of yttrium brings about a higher conductivity of TiO2, possibly attributed to a higher carrier concentration, which matches that of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and enhances JSC and FF. Wang et al. reported a graphene nanoflake modified TiO2 HBL by spin coating a dispersion of graphene–TiO2 nanocomposites. The graphene flakes were fully coated by TiO2 nanoparticles, acting as electron collectors, thus increasing Rrec. The high charge mobility of graphene reduces RS, and consequently enhances FF and PCE. These works demonstrate that graphene or metal oxide doping has the potential to improve charge transport. Table 1 shows the performance of devices with these modifications in compact layers.

Other than the blocking capability, obtaining TiO2 compact layers with lower cost is important as well. High temperature treatment, the most energy consuming process, obstructs the road towards roll-to-roll processing on flexible foils that can withstand no more than 150 °C. Thus, low-temperature fabricating methods are proposed. A graphene–TiO2 nanocomposite based device, using graphene as the electron collector and an Al2O3 scaffold, can be fabricated at a temperature less than 150 °C. Yella et al. employed a chemical bath deposition process. By immersing the FTO into dilute TiCl4 solution and heating at 70 °C, electrodes with a thin layer of crystalline TiO2 (rutile) nanoparticles were prepared. Snaith et al. fabricated a low temperature TiO2 compact layer by spin coating a colloidal dispersion of anatase particles synthesized by the sol–gel method in anhydrous ethanol, formulated with titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TiAcAc), followed by drying at 150 °C. TiAcAc serves as an “electronic glue” between the nanoparticles in the thin film, enhancing its conductivity and thus improving the PCE. The above-mentioned two methods both use TiCl4, which would produce HCl fumes when in contact with ambient water. Another low-temperature method using titanium isopropoxide as the titanium source was reported. The layer is deposited by TiO2 nanoparticle dispersion with TiAcAc and annealed at 135 °C in air. A planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with a high PCE of 13.6% makes this method promising for large scale manufacture.

Meso-structured devices generally employed a layer of mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3 (several-hundred-nanometer thick) as the scaffold, so as to facilitate the crystallization of the perovskite with enhanced nucleation at the nanoparticles’ surface and enlarge the contact area between the perovskite and the ETL to efficiently collect photogenerated electrons. It was found that photo-electrons are injected into TiO2 nanoparticles, then transported to the compact layer and FTO for devices with TiO2 scaffolds; by contrast, the dominant electron transport pathway is the perovskite absorber in devices with Al2O3 scaffolds due to its high CBM. Thus the TiO2 scaffold is also called an electron collecting layer. Usually, a sintering process is applied subsequent to the deposition of the TiO2 scaffold to enhance the electronic connectivity. Further research showed that even though the TiO2 nanoparticles share the same transport rate as compact TiO2, the recombination rate is higher for mesoscopic structures, which is ascribed to the shorter electron diffusion length. Permeability and electron transport should be simultaneously addressed in designing mesoporous TiO2 layers. A mesoporous TiO2 scaffold is usually prepared by screen-printing or spin coating a commercial paste composed of TiO2 particles (like 18NR-T), or by evaporating a weakly alkaline solution containing Ti4+ and H2O2. TiO2 nanoparticles can also be synthesized by the sol–gel method. The size of the particles can be very small (∼15 nm) and is easily controlled by the concentration, pH and heating temperature.

The size of the TiO2 nanoparticles is crucial to determining the properties of the scaffold, despite there being few reports about this in PSCs. Generally, if the size is too small, the pore will be dense and small, resulting in close pores, preventing the infiltration of the perovskite. On the other hand, excessively large particles will add further complications to controlling the morphology of the perovskite, increasing the risk of intimate contact between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the HTL. In addition, the total pore volume decreases with the increase of particle size, which is destructive to the light absorption of the perovskite that subsequently fills the pores. Thus, controlling the size of the TiO2 nanoparticles within an appropriate scale is essential for high efficiency. Han et al. investigated the size effect of TiO2 nanoparticles in a hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cell with a ZrO2 layer and carbon electrode. The results indicate that the size of the TiO2 particles affects not only the infiltration and contact of the perovskite, but also the charge transfer kinetics at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Both RS and Rrec decrease with the increase in size of the TiO2 nanoparticles, possibly due to the electronic contact between TiO2 and the carbon electrode. The device with particles of 25 nm diameter exhibited the best PCE of 13.4%. Seok et al. reported a well-organized mesoporous TiO2 layer with enlarged pores through a copolymer-induced sol–gel assembly method. The cell fabricated with a 15 nm (pore diameter) mesoporous layer is superior to that with a 10 nm layer, demonstrating the importance of the size effect in meso-structured solar cells.
A single-crystal TiO2 mesoporous layer that provides both the desired highly accessible surfaces and good electronic connectivity is reported in DSSCs. However, to our best knowledge, this technique has not been applied in PSCs. Instead, researchers usually fabricate an extra thin hole blocking layer on the surface of the mesoporous layer to suppress the recombination of the carriers. Sub-nanometer conformal TiO2 overlayers (1–4 nm thick) were deposited by ALD, which led to an overall reduction in the passivation layer capacitance, discouraging electron recombination and resulting in a higher VOC; the PCE was improved by over 50% with the addition of the overlayer. The overlayer brings about a better connection between the nanoparticles, which makes sintering unnecessary and consequently, the whole fabrication can be processed at a low temperature. Park et al. covered the TiO2 mesoporous layer with MgO by spin coating. The magnesium methoxide solution was added dropwise onto the mesoporous layer. Magnesium methoxide molecules would be chemisorbed onto the surface of TiO2 by reacting with surface hydroxyl groups and the absorbed water, which leads to the formation of a MgO ultrathin layer to retard charge recombination, thereby extending the carrier lifetime. Devices employing MgO-coated TiO2 films exhibited an increase in the FF and VOC but a decrease in the photocurrent because of the insulating nature of MgO, so that the PCE is enhanced only a little. Qin et al. employed yttrium to modify the electronic structure of TiO2 by an aliovalent substitution of cations in the crystal lattice. Yttrium's poor solubility in TiO2 makes Y2O3 only appear on the surface of TiO2. Thus, adding YCl3 to titanium isopropoxide solution in the synthesis of nanoparticles is an alternative. Yttrium's ability to block electron recombination results in a 15% increase of JSC.
Another way to improve the transport properties of the mesoporous TiO2 layer is to add electron acceptors, such as C60 and graphene. C60-coated TiO2 nanoparticles are obtained by immersing the substrates in a C60-substituted benzoic acid self-assembled monolayer (C60SAM) solution. The C60SAM acts as an electron acceptor to cause a decline in the electron back reaction but inhibit further electron transfer into the TiO2 nanoparticles due to energy level misalignment and poor electronic coupling. Thus, thermalized electrons from C60SAM are then transported to the perovskite phase. Though C60SAM can only reduce VOC loss, the device still achieved a PCE as high as 11.7%. By the electrochemical method, a thin layer of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) was deposited between the perovskite and TiO2. The induced photon-to-current conversation efficiency (IPCE) and absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) spectra show electrons can be extracted from photogenerated excitons faster (90–106 ps) with GQDs than without (260–307 ps), which boosts the photocurrent, consequently improving JSC and FF.

Highly crystalline TiO2 nanorods have been applied in PSCs due to their advantages, such as an open porous structure, easily controllable diameter and length, and two orders of magnitude higher electron mobility than particulate TiO2. TiO2 nanorods can be synthesized through a variety of methods such as metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), electrochemical anodization and the hydrothermal method. In particular, hydrothermal synthesis is a low-temperature, facile approach that does not require expensive facilities, so that it is widely adopted and suitable for large-scale applications. In a typical hydrothermal synthesis, Ti precursors are added into water or organic solutions under strongly acidic conditions. Because strong acids will increase the equipment cost and cause environmental damage, recently an acid-free medium growth method employing disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (Na2EDTA) is reported, and the PSC with the as-made rutile TiO2 showed a PCE of up to 11.1%.

Research about the length effect in TiO2 nanorods showed that the charge recombination rate is similar in nanorods with different lengths but electron diffusion is faster in longer nanorods. Strikingly, VOC, JSC and PCE degrade with the increase of the nanorod length, which is illustrated by the disorder in the longer nanorod array, reducing the pore filling. On the other hand, for a significant mesoscopic effect, TiO2 nanorods shouldn't be too short, or the device will be more similar to planar-structured PSCs. A comparison study showed that, though a planar architecture provides a higher initial VOC and PCE, a TiO2 nanorod layer is crucial to achieving a long term durable performance in PSCs. Thus, the length of the TiO2 nanorods is supposed to be well-designed.
The morphology of the TiO2 nanorods can be tuned by various modifications. Similar to TiO2 nanoparticles, an ultrathin TiO2 block layer was deposited on the surface of the TiO2 nanorods by ALD, which facilitates a low recombination rate with a high VOC, leading to a good FF and PCE. Metal ion doping can improve the performance of the TiO2 nanorod layer as well; e.g., Mg doping can elevate the CBM of TiO2, suppressing recombination but increasing RS, and Nb and Sn doping result in a lower RS and a higher Rrec by facilitating electron transport through the perovskite/TiO2 interface. The PCEs of devices based on these doped TiO2 nanorods are higher than those of devices with undoped TiO2 in each study by about 33%, 50% and 67% for Mg, Nb and Sn, respectively.
Nanorods would evolve to bendable nanowires with the increase of the ratio between the length and diameter under controllable conditions. A thinner diameter facilitates the infiltration of the perovskite, allowing a thicker mesoporous TiO2 layer to load more perovskite for higher absorption, resulting in an improved PCE. By fabricating a rugged surface through ALD, TiO2 nanowires can be further modified to become 3D nanowires, exhibiting advantages in terms of electron delivery and light scattering.

Unlike nanoparticles or nanowires, TiO2 nanotube arrays can be employed as perovskite hosts to improve infiltration and light absorption. Besides this, a reduced charge recombination in nanotube electrodes is observed, contributing to a higher PCE. Yuan et al. obtained a freestanding TiO2 nanotube array prepared by two-step electrochemical anodization and achieved a PCE of 6.5% with 2.3 μm of TiO2 nanotubes. However, restricted by the synthesis method, TiO2 nanotube arrays are too thick (over 2 μm). This means electrons have to travel further to be collected by the electrodes, which leads to inefficient charge extraction and accumulation, reducing JSC and PCE. Wong et al. fabricated aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays on Ti foil using electrochemical anodization and employed carbon nanotubes (C120) as a transparent counter electrode. A PCE of 8.3% was obtained with tubes of 300 nm in length and 60 nm in diameter. Such devices with double nanotube layers are highly flexible, maintaining a good performance after 100 bending cycles.


Other nanostructures of TiO2 were prepared by manipulating the growth process. A TiO2 nanofiber was electrospun directly on the TiO2 compact layer with a TiCl4 treated rough surface. However, the device using this structure exhibited an unsatisfying efficiency because of the poor conversion from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 in the nanofiber layer. Nanocones were obtained by fusing the nanorods consisting of ultrathin nanowires along the growth direction by adding Na2EDTA into the medium for the hydrothermal process. Nanocones provide faster electron transfer than nanorods, and are thus beneficial to suppressing the charge recombination and improving the performance of the devices. Nanohelices are obtained by an oblique-angle deposition technique using an electron-beam evaporator on silicon wafers. Nanohelical TiO2 plays an important role in the suppression of hystersis, since capacitive charges are likely to be quickly dissipated by charge separation in the presence of nanohelices. Thus, no differences in the current density–voltage curves in the forward and reverse scanning modes were observed. The morphology of the mesoporous layers with these nanostructures is shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, with oblique-angle deposition, by adjusting the deposition conditions, such as the tilt angle, substrate rotation speed, time interval between the substrate rotation, and deposition rate, a variety of 3D nanostructures, including different nanohelices, slanted nanorods, and nano zig-zags, were produced with precise control of the geometrical shape. PSCs with these TiO2 nanostructures are summarized in Table 2. Because of the sufficient maneuverability of its preparation process, more and more TiO2 nanostructures are expected to be applied in PSCs.

ZnO is another important II–VI semiconductor with a CBM of 4.2 eV, a direct band gap of 3.3 eV and an exciton binding energy of 60 meV at room temperature. Since the LUMO and HOMO of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 are 3.6 eV and 5.2 eV, respectively, an efficient electron extraction and dissociation of the excitons is expected.

Compared to TiO2, ZnO has advantages; e.g., the conductivity of ZnO is several orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO2, so the recombination loss will be less due to the higher electron mobility. Besides this, a high temperature sintering process is not necessary for the fabrication of ZnO, which means that it can be used in flexible solar cells. Its wurtzite structure has strong polarity in the c-axis direction, so the crystallization and anisotropic growth is superior, resulting in complex nanostructures and morphologies. Moreover, ZnO has excellent optical properties such as a high infrared reflectivity and transparency in the visible spectrum. In addition, it is abundant in nature and inexpensive. These interesting properties make it a promising ETL in PSCs. However, like TiO2, ZnO also suffers from photocorrosion, which will reduce the performance and stability.
The two main kinds of nanostructures in TiO2, compact films and a mesoporous structure with nanorods, are also applied in ZnO. Usually, films formed by nanoparticles have slower electron transport due to grain boundaries, which also cause higher recombination. Nanorods, however, have an internal electrical field in the direction of the c-axis to enhance charge transport and restrain the recombination of injected electrons.

To date, many perovskite solar cells with ZnO as the ETL consist of a compact ZnO layer, which functions as a hole blocking layer, preventing charge recombination. Without the ZnO layer, the FF and VOC are very low because of increased recombination at the ITO surface and a correspondingly low Rsh. Zhang et al. used electrochemical deposition to generate a ZnO layer made of large grains with an average size of 300 nm. The FF of the best-performing device is only 0.50, and it increases with the roughness of the ZnO–perovskite interface. Since the conductivity of the ZnO layer is rather high, the low FF may be attributed to the charge transfer resistance at the interfaces. Hu et al. used ALD to fabricate a compact ZnO layer at 70 °C, and then deposited a 350 nm thick mesoporous Al2O3 layer. After that, they used a single-step method to construct perovskite solar cells. A PCE of 13.1% was achieved, and the effective area was defined as 0.04 cm2. The ZnO layer is more condensed than that of solution-processed ZnO layers so that it can more effectively suppress charge recombination. Adding other dopants can improve the energy level alignment, tune the surface morphology and suppress recombination. Mahmood et al. used electrospraying and spin-coating to obtain ZnO and Al-doped ZnO films. The morphology of the films can be easily controlled by changing the deposition conditions. The VOC of the Al-doped ZnO based perovskite solar cell was improved due to the higher electron concentration in the conduction band of the ETL and lower recombination rate. Organic compounds can also improve the performance of PSCs with ZnO compact layers. For example, as discussed in our previous review, [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a widely used electron acceptor in perovskite solar cells, can tune the energy level of ZnO. Kim et al. deposited 30 nm-thick sol–gel processed ZnO onto ITO and spin-coated PCBM onto the ZnO film. The CBM of ZnO/PCBM is located between that of ZnO and that of the perovskite, facilitating a cascade charge extraction and higher VOC. The Rrec of the device with ZnO/PCBM is higher, which means that adding PCBM can suppress the surface charge recombination as well as the bulk charge recombination. However, solar cells with only PCBM on the ITO exhibited a poor performance. Thus, they concluded that the synergic effect of ZnO and PCBM is essential for a high performance. Chen et al. deposited 3-aminopropanoic acid SAM (C3-SAM) onto the sol–gel ZnO. It was found that C3-SAM made perovskite crystals in a more plate-like shape, enhancing the light absorption. The PCE was improved from 11.2% to 15.7%.

Compact layers can be formed by spin coating a dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles without sintering, which is convenient for flexible cells. Song et al. spin-coated ZnO nanoparticle ETLs and achieved a PCE of 13.9%. The PCE degraded negligibly over 20 days, while it decreased to 20% of the initial value without the ZnO layer. The authors attribute the stability of the ZnO-based PSC to a nicely controlled PbI2 passivation. Zhou et al. spin-coated ZnO nanoparticles on FTO and flexible ITO/polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates. They got a PCE of 8.7% for the FTO device and 4.3% for the flexible device. The flexible devices maintained 80% of their initial PCE after bending 1000 times. Liu et al. produced ZnO crystalline nanoparticles with a 5 nm diameter, then spin-coated them on ITO/glass and ITO/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates to form compact ZnO layers. Perovskite crystallites larger than 75 nm were observed on the interface between ZnO and the perovskite. Large crystallites also act as scattering centres for incoming light, increasing the effective optical path length of the device. The PCE of devices based on ITO/glass is 15.7%, and the PCE of flexible devices is 10.2%. Bending tests show that the flexible devices also perform well.

Another widely used structure is ZnO nanorods. Liang et al. used magnetron sputtering to obtain ZnO films consisting of aligned ZnO nanorods. JSC is found to be larger than that of devices with ZnO nanoparticles and devices with compact or mesoporous TiO2. It was found that after the deposition of 40 nm thick ZnO, the sheet resistance of the ITO decreased by more than 25%. This can be explained by the good conductivity of the c-axis oriented ZnO nanorods. Kumar et al. compared the performances of devices with ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods. Devices employing an FTO/glass substrate with nanorods give a PCE of 8.9%, while those using FTO/glass with nanoparticles give a PCE of 5.5%. Flexible devices on PET/ITO with nanorods exhibited a PCE of 2.6%, while those with nanoparticles yielded a PCE of 2.2%. The devices on the FTO substrate are generally better than devices on PET/ITO, because of the lower inherent resistance. Son et al. immersed a ZnO seed layer in solution and grew ZnO nanorods. The APCE of devices with ZnO is higher than that of devices with its TiO2 counterpart, while the light harvesting efficiency is similar. This suggests the charge collection limits the current density in TiO2 based PSCs. The higher VOC of devices based on ZnO is attributed to reduced recombination.

Some PSCs employ another layer between the ZnO nanorod and perovskite. Usually, this layer modifies the interface, changing the energy level or reducing recombination. Dong et al. introduced an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) shell on ZnO nanoparticles. The CBM of ZnO can be raised slightly using a small amount of Al to substitute the Zn site. AZO also gives a higher electron mobility. It is observed that the highest PCE of 10.5% occurs at 5% Al doping. There is almost no change in JSC when the Al doping concentration in the AZO is less than 10%, but JSC decreases with higher concentrations. Liu et al. deposited CdS quantum dots on ZnO nanorods to form a ZnO/CdS-core/shell nanoarray acting as the electron-selective layer. Though the photoluminescence spectrum shows a large amount of defects on the ZnO nanorod, these are effectively passivated by the CdS shell. The authors speculate that the increase in VOC is due to the increased quasi-Fermi level in ZnO.
There are variations based on ZnO nanorods. He et al. grew aligned ZnO nano-obelisks on stainless steel wire to form solar cell fibers and fabrics. The coaxial structure of the solar cell fibre makes the PCE insusceptible to the angle of incidence. The PSC maintains 93% of its initial efficiency after bending for 200 cycles, showing a high stability. Mahmood et al. devised a double layer with ZnO nanorods on ZnO nanosheets. They achieved a PCE of 10.35% and a high stability. The efficiency remains more than 80% of the initial value after 240 hours, and JSC is nearly constant. PSCs employing ZnO as the ETM have been summarized in Table 3.

Insulators, such as Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2, are used in PSCs to take the place of mesoporous TiO2. Of these materials, Al2O3 is the earliest and most widely adopted one, and devices of high efficiency have been obtained using it. In contrast to TiO2 and ZnO, Al2O3 is an insulator with a wide band gap (7–9 eV) and Al2O3 nanoparticles act purely as a scaffold. Thus, for Al2O3-based cells, the electrons must be transported through the film thickness in the perovskite until they are collected at the planar TiO2-coated FTO electrode. However, the chemical capacitance, caused by a high density of sub-band gap states, can be excluded by the insulating nature of Al2O3, leading to a higher VOC and the stability of devices with an alumina scaffold is much better because there is no electron trapping in these devices, but there are traps in aged TiO2-based solar cells arising from light-induced desorption of surface-absorbed oxygen, especially after being illuminated by ultraviolet light for a long time. A post-modification by aluminium oxide, immersing the substrates coated with the perovskite into triethylaluminum hexane solution, can protect the perovskite and sensitized film from degradation by moisture and sunlight, and retard the electron recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface. Besides this, the Al2O3 scaffold also plays an important role in the low-temperature fabrication of PSCs, because the sinter process (∼500 °C) is not necessary for Al2O3. In addition, spin-coating an alumina/perovskite co-deposition suspension can simplify the fabrication process, making it more convenient for mass production.

ZrO2 and SiO2, also as insulators, are similar to Al2O3. ZrO2 is used both in devices with a typical mesoscopic structure and as an efficient carbon-electrode device, showing the potential of ZrO2 nanoparticles in economical solar cells. The infiltration of perovskites is more important for such insulating mesoporous layers, so the pore size should be well addressed. SiO2 nanoparticles with various diameters were synthesized via the sol–gel method. It was found that the infiltration is optimized by controlling the size of the particle at 50 nm. This result may be useful to the design of a device with a mesoporous insulator layer. Snaith et al. added Au@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles, synthesized with the assistance of PVP, to the Al2O3 colloid solution prior to the porous alumina film deposition. The presence of the gold core possibly reduced the exciton binding energy and hence enhanced the generation of free charge carriers, leading to an improved JSC.
Some hole conductors can also be used to modify the interface and suppress charge recombination. For example, NiO is a p-type semiconductor with a CBM at −1.8 eV and a VBM at −5.2 eV. Liu et al. fabricated perovskite solar cells with NiO as an interfacial layer, and found that the hole transfer and electron blocking ability of NiO results in a faster charge transfer and lower recombination compared to those with ZrO2. The 11.4% efficiency is 39% higher than those with ZrO2.
Other semiconductors, SrTiO3 (STO), WO3 and SnO2, are employed to take the place of TiO2. STO has a wide band gap similar to that of TiO2, but its CBM is slightly higher, matching better with the band structure of perovskites, which is beneficial for electron collection, and the room-temperature electron mobility of bulk STO is much higher than that of TiO2. In addition, the ferroelectricity of STO helps to reduce charge recombination at the interface. Therefore, devices based on a mesoporous STO layer exhibit an ∼25% higher VOC than that of conventional ones. However, this is accompanied by a decrease in the photocurrent due to the large size of the STO particles, which requires further improvement. The band gap of WO3 is comparatively smaller than TiO2, but it has been shown to have a higher carrier mobility than TiO2. Furthermore, WO3 can be synthesized as a wide range of nanostructures by the electrospraying method. Devices with ETLs consisting of various WO3 nanostructures were fabricated, and the device performance with WO3 nanosheets is the best. In addition, a thin layer applied to the surface of WO3 nanostructures can suppress charge recombination at the WO3/perovskite interface, affording a much higher VOC and PCE. SnO2 has excellent electronic and optical properties, such as a good antireflection, suitable band edge position and high charge mobility, and thus was used as the ETL in PSCs recently. Ma et al. reported a SnO2 compact layer prepared by the sol–gel method. Devices based on such layers showed a surprisingly high JSC of 30.99 mA cm−2 due to the high electron mobility but comparatively lower VOC and FF than those for traditional PSCs, which resulted from extensive recombination at the interface but this disadvantage may correspond to the quality of the layer and didn't appear in other work. Yan et al. fabricated a SnO2 compact layer by spin coating the SnCl2·H2O precursor followed by annealing in air with an enhancement of JSC and no reduction of VOC and FF observed, contributing to a PCE as high as 17.2%. These works demonstrate that SnO2 is a promising ETM and has the potential to take the leading place of TiO2. The performances of devices using these materials are compared in Table 4.

In this review, we have given an overview of nanostructured electron transporting materials for perovskite solar cells. Two main aspects of the ETL should be focused on: the material and morphology. In terms of the material, TiO2 is the most widely used ETM, and the synthesis and modification methods for TiO2 have matured and been mastered by most researchers. More importantly, devices employing TiO2 as the ETM exhibit the highest PCE, which demonstrates that TiO2 is currently still the most appropriate ETM for PSCs. The traditional TiO2 fabricating technique uses a sintering process and defects in the TiO2 crystal grains decrease the stability of the devices, obstructing the large-scale application of TiO2-based PSCs. The sintering process can be avoided by using low-temperature fabrication methods, and applying various modifications, such as different synthesis methods and doping, will improve the electronic properties and stability. ZnO has a much higher electron mobility than TiO2, and thus gives better conductivity. ZnO doesn't require a sintering process, ensuring that it can be used in flexible PSCs, which is convenient for mass production. However, similarly to TiO2, ZnO also suffers from photocorrosion, leading to unsatisfying stability. The PCE of ZnO-based devices is relatively lower than TiO2-based ones. Further improvement for ZnO ETLs is needed. Transparent insulators, Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2, purely serve as scaffolds of perovskites. They can enhance the stability and VOC significantly. However, this is at the expense of conductivity. More and more new ETMs, such as SrTiO3, WO3 and SnO2, have been applied in PSCs. Remarkably, SnO2 is very similar to TiO2 but its electron mobility is much higher, leading to a surprisingly high JSC, which makes SnO2 a promising material for PSCs. In addition, the properties of the ETL can be improved by incorporating some functional structures as well. Plasmonic Au–Ag alloy popcorn-shaped nanoparticles are employed in the mesoporous TiO2 layer, resulting in a broader optical absorption and faster charge transfer.

The morphology of the ETL affects its performance as well. A thin compact layer with few pores and defects, acting as a selective layer, is needed in most PSCs. The morphology of this compact layer can be controlled by different synthesis methods, such as solution synthesis, ALD, and magnetron sputtering. A mesoporous layer containing thousands of nanostructures can give the device a better charge collection. Nanoparticles with a rough surface provide a large contact area between the ETL and perovskite, but recombination is extensive at the interface. This problem can be solved by coating the surface of the nanoparticles with another material. Nanorod arrays have an open structure and a higher electron mobility, suppressing the recombination, but nanorods aren't superior overall to nanoparticles due to the loss of the rough surface. Some other nanostructures, such as 1D-nanowires, 3D-nanowires, nanotubes, nanofibers, nanocones and nanohelices have been synthesized and tested in PSCs. Each of these nanostructures exhibits unique optical and electronic properties.
Precise control of the components, geometrical factors and morphology of the ETL may be an efficient method for further improving the performance of these devices but it requires a deeper understanding of the electron transporting mechanism in PSCs, especially at the perovskite/ETL interface.
