One novel C60 derivative F1 and its corresponding C70 derivative F2 were designed and synthesized by the [4+2] cyclic addition reaction. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of them were carefully characterized. The LUMO energy levels of them are about 0.06 eV higher than that of PCBM. The power conversion efficiency of the polymer solar cells based on P3HT as donor and F1 and F2 as acceptors, reached 3.63% and 3.35%, respectively. When using PBDTTT-C to replace P3HT as a donor, the performance of F1 and F2 based devices reached 3.00% and 5.07%, respectively.

Compared with solar cells based on inorganic materials, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have many advantages including their easy fabrication, low cost and being lightweight. After nearly twenty years of research, PSCs have already achieved great development, which was mainly achieved by designing and synthesizing novel polymer donor materials and optimizing device fabrication methods. Until now, the main structure of the PSC devices is still the bulk heterojunction photovoltaic device composed of a polymer donor material and fullerene acceptor, which was developed by Yu et al. in 1995. Many novel polymer donor materials with low band gaps for increasing the absorption of sunlight and thus improving the short-circuit current (JSC) of the devices, good energy level alignment with the acceptor material for getting high open-circuit voltage (VOC) while maintaining enough driving force for exciton separation at the polymer–fullerene interface, high molecular weight and good solubility have been developed, and they have very good photovoltaic performances. The case is different for fullerene acceptors: there are very few good acceptor materials. Due to the good solubility, low LUMO energy level, high electron mobility and good miscibility with most polymer donor materials, PC60BM and PC70BM still are the best acceptors for most of these polymer donors. Relative to the considerable research effort to develop superior polymer donor materials, there is not enough research work on developing novel fullerene acceptor materials, especially for application in low band gap polymer based devices. For the polymer donor materials with a big LUMO level offset with PCBM and good capability to supply high JSC and FF, novel fullerene acceptors with up-shifted LUMO levels relative to PCBM will be a viable way to further improve their performance. The PBDTTT series of polymers, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and poly[2,6-(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PSBTBT) have very high LUMO levels (ca. −3.20 eV) and suitable band gaps (ca. 1.70 eV). Their photovoltaic performance could be further improved by using novel fullerene acceptors with up-shifted LUMO levels.

Until now, most research work about novel fullerene acceptor materials focuses on the P3HT system, which is easily commercially available. Because of their higher-lying LUMO levels compared to PCBM, bisPC60BM, Lu3N@C80-PCBH, ICBA and IPC60BM have better performances in P3HT devices with a Voc of 0.73 V, 0.86 V, 0.84 V and 0.72 V, and a PCE of 4.5%, 5.3%, 6.48%, 4.3%, respectively, while the Voc and PCE of the devices based on PCBM are 0.60 V and 3.8% under the same experimental conditions. However, when mixed with low band gap polymers (PBDTTT-C, PSBTBT, et al.), all the above acceptors gave a worse performance than PCBM. The requirements for one high performance polymer donor material became more and more clear: a polymer donor material must have a high enough molecular weight, suitable molecular weight dispersion, high purity, good solubility and suitable band gap and energy levels for achieving excellent performance. However, it's still unclear how to get super high performance novel fullerene acceptor materials which could be used in many polymer donor systems.
In this paper, we synthesized two novel fullerene derivatives, F1, and F2, as shown in Scheme 1. They were synthesized by the [4+2] cyclic addition reaction. A solution of compound 1 and C60 or C70 in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was heated to reflux for several hours. Then the solution was cooled to room temperature, and was added drop wise to a stirring methanol. The solid was collected, washed with methanol for several times, then was adsorbed on silica gel and purified by a silica gel column with toluene as eluent. After removing the unreacted C60 or C70, the target compounds F1 or F2 were obtained as brown solids. Both fullerene derivatives have very good solubility in dichlorobenzene. The structures of the derivatives were characterized by MALDI-TOF, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra. The absorption, PL, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these fullerene derivatives were investigated. The relationship between the structures and many properties of above fullerene derivatives were also researched.
The optical absorption of F1, F2 and PC60BM in diluted THF solution with a concentration of 10−5 mol L−1 was characterized as shown in Fig. 1. In the visible region from 400 to 700 nm, the absorbance of the F2 solution is much stronger than that of the other two C60-based solutions, due to the stronger absorption of C70 than that of C60. The absorption shape and strength of F1 solution are very close to that of PC60BM solution.
The optical absorption of the blend films with P3HT and PBDTTT-C as donors and F1, F2, PC60BM and PC70BM as acceptors, were investigated as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). All three P3HT-based films have good absorption in the range from 350 nm to 650 nm, and nearly the same absorption shape. There are three peaks located at 518 nm, 554 nm and 602 nm. The vibronic features mean that P3HT already has good ordering in the film. The structures of the acceptors do not have a big influence on the positions of these peaks. The absorption shapes of PBDTTT-C/F2 and PBDTTT-C/PC70BM films are also nearly the same. There are two absorption peaks located at 633 nm and 690 nm, respectively. PBDTTT-C/F1 has weaker absorption in the range from 350 nm to 600 nm than other two films.

Fig. 3 shows the PL spectra of pure P3HT, PBDTTT-C films and their mixed films with the fullerene derivatives. Pure P3HT film has strong PL intensity in the range from 650 nm to 750 nm and peaks at 640 nm. After being mixed with fullerene acceptors, most of the P3HT PL was quenched. The PL intensity of P3HT/PC60BM was the weakest one of the four films, which is helpful for getting higher Jsc. When mixed with all the above fullerene derivatives, the PL of PBDTTT-C was totally quenched, which indicates that there is good charge separation at the interface between the donor phase and acceptor phase in the mixed films.
The electrochemical properties of F1, F2 and PC60BM in the potential range of 0 to −2.5 V vs. Ag/Ag+ were studied by cyclic voltammetry as shown in Fig. 4. All three reduction potentials of the two derivatives are negatively shifted in comparison with that of PC60BM. Table 1 listed the half-wave potentials of the reduction processes of the two fullerene derivatives. The first (E1) and second (E2) reduction potentials all shifted negatively from PC60BM to these two fullerene derivatives. E1 is shifted from −0.60 V for PC60BM to −0.65 V (shifted by −0.05 V) for F1, to −0.66 V for F2 (shifted by −0.06 V), and E2 is shifted from −1.02 V for PC60BM to −1.05 V for F1 (shifted by −0.03 V), to −1.06 V for F2 (shifted by −0.04 V), respectively. Both of the acceptors have a more negative reduction potential than PC60BM, which will be helpful for getting higher Voc.

The LUMO energy levels of these fullerene derivatives were calculated from the below equation: LUMO = −e(Eredon + 4.40) where Eredon is the onset reduction potential with the unit of V vs. Ag/Ag+. The onset reduction potentials (Eredon) of F1, F2, and PC60BM were −0.56 V, −0.55 V and −0.49 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of F1, F2, and PC60BM calculated in this way are −3.84 eV, −3.85 eV and −3.91 eV, respectively. These values were also listed in Table 1. The higher LUMO energy levels of these derivatives are desirable for their application as acceptors in PSCs to get a higher open-circuit voltage.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these fullerene derivatives, PSCs were fabricated with P3HT and PBDTTT-C as donors and these derivatives as acceptors. The details about device fabrication and testing were shown in the ESI. Fig. 5(a) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the three P3HT based PSC devices, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The results for the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices are listed in Table 2. Compared with PC60BM-based and PC70BM-based devices, it can be seen that the Voc of the devices based on F1 an F2 are increased, but the Jsc of the devices based on them are slightly decreased. The lowest FF of P3HT:F2 devices gave the lowest performance among three devices. In the end, we get a 3.63% and 3.35% performance for F1 and F2 based devices, respectively. The J–V curves of the three PBDTTT-C based devices, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, were shown in Fig. 5(b). The detailed results are listed in Table 2. Similar to those in the P3HT devices, the Voc of F1 and F2 based devices in the PBDTTT-C system are higher than the counterpart PC70BM devices. Due to the weak absorption of F1, the device Jsc of the PSCs based on F1 are a lot lower than those of the PSCs based on the other two acceptors. The Jsc and FF of F2 based devices are slightly lower than those of PC70BM based devices. The performance of F1-based and F2 based devices reached 3.00% and 5.07%, respectively.

In conclusion, two novel fullerene acceptors, F1 and F2, with 0.06 eV higher LUMO levels than PCBM were designed and synthesized. They have very good solubility in the device fabrication solvents such as dichlorobenzene, chloroform et al. PSCs based on P3HT and PBDTTT-C as donor materials, F1, F2 and PCBM as acceptors were fabricated. The devices based on F1 and F2 have higher Voc than the counterpart PCBM devices. In P3HT systems, the devices based on F1 and F2 reached performances of 3.63% and 3.35%, respectively. In PBDTTT-C systems, the devices based on F1 and F2 have a lower Jsc and FF than those of PCBM devices, and achieved a performance of 3.00% and 5.07%, respectively, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The results indicate that the two novel fullerene derivatives could be promising photovoltaic fullerene acceptor materials for high-efficiency PSCs.
