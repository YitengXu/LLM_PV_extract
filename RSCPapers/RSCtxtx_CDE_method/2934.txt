A series of three aza-Bodipy donor molecules namely Aza-Bthp, Aza-Sty, and Aza-Fhdt have been synthesized. The compounds exhibit panchromatic absorption spanning approximately 280–1000 nm in the solution state and possess suitable energy levels for their usefulness as donors in organic solar cells. Under the optimized conditions, using PC70BM as an acceptor, power conversion efficiencies (PCE%) of 2.44, 1.2, and 2.52 were afforded for Aza-Bthp, Aza-Fhdt, and Aza-Sty respectively.

Harvesting light in the near-infrared (NIR) region has a major control over the performance of organic dyes. Research and study on NIR materials have been receiving substantial interest by virtue of their diverse applications. NIR dyes have been recognized considerably in photodynamic therapy, cellular imaging, optoelectronics and organic solar cells (OSCs).

One of the main drawbacks of various organic dyes proposed for OSCs is the divergence between the absorption spectra of the active layer and the solar emission spectrum. Enhancing the light harvesting efficacy of the dye into the NIR region, where almost 50% of the sunlight power is exhibited, its performance can be improved remarkably. Therefore NIR absorbing materials have become essential for organic photovoltaics (OPVs).
Panchromatic absorbance can be accessed by justified structural modification of chromophore-based materials. Among such promising class of chromophores, borondipyrromethene (Bodipy) analogues are competent with remarkable photophysical properties, adaptability with desired functionalities, excellent photostability, and good solubility in organic solvents, allowing their utilization in various fields of modern materials science. Among various structural modifications of the Bodipy core to achieve NIR absorbance, a simple yet efficient way is developing the aza-Bodipy class of dyes. These dyes were accessed by accommodating nitrogen instead of meso-carbon in the Bodipy core. Aza-Bodipy derivatives mostly resemble Bodipy dyes in the aspects of flexibility for structural modification, photostability, and chemical stability, with an added advantage of red shifted absorption and emission profiles. In materials chemistry, aza-Bodipys have major contributions as conjugated polymers, sensors, and donor materials for OSCs. The combination of small molecules and solution-processability has promising advantages compared to vapour deposition. The merits include high throughput, and accessibility for roll-to-roll printing on flexible plastic substrates, which affords light-weight, low cost and large area coverage.
Herein, we report three aza-Bodipy based donor molecules namely Aza-Bthp, Aza-Fhdt, and Aza-Sty for OSCs (Fig. 1), exhibiting panchromatic absorption across the UV/Vis/NIR regions. This project is accomplished by tailoring the parent chromophore with electron donating groups (donors), and thereby constructing a donor–acceptor–donor (D1–A–D2) electronic system. The donor group (D1) has been chosen as an amine substituent for accessing longer wavelength and the other donor (D2) keeps varying in the series, in order to study the impact of solubility, π-conjugation and ease of electron donating capacity on OSC device performance. R Gresser et al. studied optical and electrochemical characteristics of thiophene-substituted aza-Bodipy dyes, reported the highest absorption maxima of the series as 742 nm in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent.

The amine-substituted aza-Bodipy (1) represented in Scheme 1 was prepared by following the reported procedure. The synthetic protocol involves an Aldol condensation reaction between 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde and 4-bromo acetophenone at RT to give the respective chalcone as a yellow solid. This chalcone on further Michael addition with nitromethane in the presence of diethylamine, in methanol under reflux gave its nitro methane adduct as a pale yellow solid. This solid under condensation with ammonium acetate in n-Butanol, under reflux obtained azadipyrromethene as a navy blue solid. The solid is subjected to complexation with BF3·Et2O using diisopropylethylamine as a base, in dry toluene under reflux. Monitoring by TLC and purification of the reaction mixture afforded aza-Bodipy (1) as a dark blue solid in 58% isolated yield.

The target compounds Aza-Bthp (2a), Aza-Sty (2c) and pre-target Aza-FCHO (2b′) were synthesized by employing Suzuki coupling with the respective boronic acids/esters using Cs2CO3 as a base in the presence of catalyst Pd(dppf)Cl2 in refluxing THF:PhCH3:H2O (1:1:0.15) solvent mixture. The precursor Aza-FCHO (2b′), on further Horner–Wittig reaction with 4,5-bis(hexylthio)-1,3-dithiole-2-thione (HDT) using triethylphosphite in refluxing dry toluene resulted in Aza-Fhdt (2b) as a dark green solid. HDT was prepared by adapting the synthetic procedure from the literature. The compounds were characterized by NMR (1H, 13C), elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF.

Absorbance of the dyes Aza-Bthp, Aza-Fhdt, and Aza-Sty was measured in chloroform and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvents (Fig. 2). A broad absorption profile with three major peaks, spanning UV-VIS-NIR was observed for all three dyes. Though the absorption profiles are similar, the optical parameters of these dyes have been changed with the presence of different donor groups (D2). In the absorption spectra of all the dyes, the aryl moieties represent higher energy peaks while the lower energy bands are due to the presence of the aza-Bodipy core. In chloroform, the absorption maxima were found at 795 nm, 828 nm, and 784 nm for Aza-Bthp, Aza-Fhdt and Aza-Sty respectively. The incorporation of HDT units resulted in enhanced absorption and increased solubility in organic solvents for the dye Aza-Fhdt. All the dyes display high molar extinction coefficients in a solution state (above 65000 M−1 cm−1) at their absorbance maxima. As depicted in Fig. 2, these dyes show substantial redshift (∼35–40 nm) in their absorption features on changing from chloroform to DMF. The absorption maxima of the dyes were also calculated by performing DFT computational studies (Tables S1–S3 in the ESI), and the data are in agreement with that of experimentally obtained results. Table 1 lists the optical properties of these dyes.

The aza-Bodipy derivatives were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to obtain the corresponding oxidation and reduction potentials. The measurements were carried out using 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in chloroform, using a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the ferrocene/ferrocinium (Fc/Fc+) couple as an external redox standard. The cyclic voltammograms of these dyes are presented as Fig. S1 in the (ESI). The optical band gaps (based on the onset of absorption) of these dyes in solution are in the range of 1.38–1.42 eV. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels were determined using cyclic voltammograms and the optical band gap of the respective dyes. These energy levels signify their good suitability as donors in combination with fullerene acceptors for efficient OPVs. The energy levels are also determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The obtained potentials and calculated frontier orbital energies of these dyes are in agreement with each other as listed in Table 2.

We optimized OSCs based on aza-Bodipy donors to a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/aza-Bodipy:PC70BM/Al (Fig. 3) with an active layer (100 nm) of the aza-Bodipy donors and PC70BM acceptor in a 1:1 ratio for the best performance in each case. The device architecture and energy levels of different components of the device are represented in Fig. 3a and b respectively.


Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of these devices. The devices with active layers composed of 1:1 weight ratio aza-Bodipy donors and PC70BM acceptor resulted in decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 2.44%, 1.2%, and 2.52% for Aza-Bthp, Aza-Fhdt, and Aza-Sty respectively. The photovoltaic parameters i.e., short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open circuit voltage (Voc), and the fill factor (FF) of these devices are presented in Table 3. All the devices resulted in a slight drop in PCE on annealing at 80 °C for five minutes showing the PCEs of 2.21%, 1.01%, and 2.01% for Aza-Bthp, Aza-Fhdt, and Aza-Sty respectively. Despite the presence of strong electron donating groups and broad absorbance spectra Aza-Fhdt shows low Jsc, which resulted in low PCE.

To further understand the low efficiency, we have carried out the charge carrier mobility study in blend films by using ‘hole only’ (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Au) and ‘electron only’ (ITO/ZnO/blend/Al) devices. The charge carrier mobility values are estimated using Mott–Gurney's space charge limited current (SCLC) model at higher voltages. The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the blend are shown in Fig. 5 and their ratio is shown in Table 3. It is clear that that there is significant imbalance of electron/hole mobility. However, this is more in the case of Aza-Fhdt, which could be a reason for their low performance.

We have tried using LiF or PFN as an electron transport layer (ETL) but it did not work. Since the LiF thickness is just a few nanometers, the surface morphology should be smooth. Therefore, we examined the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images as shown in Fig. 6.

From Fig. 6, it is clear that the surface of the films is very rough with highest in the case of Aza-Fhdt. Therefore LiF might not work as an ETL.
External quantum efficiency (EQE): EQE has been measured for all the devices with a 1:1 D/A blend ratio. The devices based on Aza-Bthp and Aza-Sty showed an EQE from 300 to 900 nm with the highest EQE of 45% at 794 nm, while the Aza-Fhdt based device exhibited EQE from 300 to 950 nm with the highest EQE of 39% at 832 nm (Fig. 7). The integrated current from the EQE curves is shown in Table 3. The deviations in the current density between both Jsc (I–V) and Jsc (EQE) are within 5%.

In order to visualize the distribution of frontier molecular orbital levels associated with the designed aza-Bodipy donor molecules, ab initio calculations were performed based on time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311g(d,p) basis set in Gaussian software. As shown in Fig. 8, the HOMO orbitals are mainly concentrated on –NMe2 and N2BF2 (aza-Bodipy core) for the dyes Aza-Bthp and Aza-Sty; whereas it is concentrated on Fhdt and N2BF2 units respectively for Aza-Fhdt dye. For all of them, LUMO orbitals are located largely on the N2BF2 core. These results point towards the better electronic communication between the units in the proposed molecular framework.


All precursor materials were purchased directly from commercial sources and used as such without any further purification. The solvents were dried under vacuum by following standard procedures. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-Avance spectrometer. All the NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with TMS as an internal reference. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600, UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a CH Instrument with a three electrode system.

The optimized geometry of the aza-Bodipy dyes was obtained by using the B3LYP/6-311g(d,p) basis set in Gaussian software. The excitation energy and oscillator strength for the lowest singlet–singlet transitions for these dyes were obtained by TD-DFT calculations using the same basis set and are presented in the ESI. The calculated frontier molecular orbital energy levels and absorbance maxima are well in agreement with the experimental values, as seen in Table 2 of this manuscript.


The ITO glass substrate (sheet resistance about 20 Ω □−1) was cleaned with soap solution, and ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone and propan-2-ol sequentially for 15 min for each case. The substrates were dried at an increased temperature overnight inside an oven. The ITO substrate was then exposed to ultraviolet ozone irradiation for 15 min. The aza-Bodipy dyes were tested as electron donor materials in a BHJ active layer. The standard device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/Al is followed for all the devices as shown in Fig. 3a. Initially, the above UV treated ITO substrate was coated with a 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer in order to form an anode. With the donor and acceptor concentration in chloroform being 5 mg ml−1 (1:1 w/w blend ratio), active layers were spin-coated at 1500 rpm in a glove box. The thickness of the active layer was measured to be 100 nm. Then 100 nm aluminum (Al) cathode was thermally evaporated. The active device area was measured to be 10 mm2 as defined by a shadow mask. These fabricated solar cells were encapsulated with epoxy and cover glasses and exposed for ultraviolet irradiation for 15 min.

The photovoltaic characteristics (J–V) of the solar cells were measured at room temperature by solar simulator from Sciencetech (model–SS 150, class–AAA) at 1 sun illumination, i.e., 1 kW m−2 light intensity. Current vs. voltage (J–V) data were acquired by using a Keithley 2420 source meter.

In summary, we have investigated three aza-Bodipy donors for BHJ OSCs namely Aza-Bthp, Aza- Fhdt, and Aza-Sty. Achieving NIR absorbance was demonstrated by the extended π-conjugation. Under the optimized conditions, a decent PCE of 2.52% was obtained for Aza-Sty. We believe that these findings offer design criteria for efficient donor molecules. Expanding the scope of these donors in tandem design is currently under study in our laboratory.
