Chloroboron (III) subnaphthalocyanine (SubNc) films have been characterized by ellipsometry, absorption, photoluminescence measurements, and atomic force microscopy. The films strongly absorb red light, as the extinction coefficient k peaks at 1.4 at a wavelength of 686 nm. Planar bilayer heterojunctions with fullerene (C60) on top of SubNc are measured under AM 1.5 simulated illumination at various light intensities, leading to an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 790 mV and a power conversion efficiency of 2.5%. The external and internal quantum efficiencies peaked at 36% and 70%, respectively. The combination of a strong red absorption and high Voc make SubNc an interesting material for organic solar cells, in particular for tandem cells.

Because of recent efficiency advances, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs) are promising candidates as a source of low-cost energy generation. By introducing the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface and using bulk heterojunctions, power conversion efficiencies (ηp) over 5% have been obtained. For vacuum deposited small-molecule solar cells, phthalocyanines with either Cu, Zn or H2 coordinated in the center have become frequently used donor materials.Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) in combination with fullerene (C60) has yielded efficiencies up to 4.2%. Nonetheless, this material pair only leads to an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼0.5 V at 100 mW cm−2 incident light, whereas the lowest energy photon absorbed by CuPc is of the order of 1.7 eV. The power conversion efficiency of a solar cell, which can be calculated as ηp = JscVocFF/Plight (Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor and Plight is the incident light power per unit area), shows the importance of obtaining simultaneously a high Jsc and Voc. There is, however, an intrinsic tradeoff between Jsc and Voc of an organic solar cell:Jsc is dependent on the optical gap of the absorbing material as well as the D–A energy offset which needs to be sufficiently high (>0.3 eV) to promote efficient exciton separation, whereas Voc is limited by the offset energy at the D–A interface.

Therefore, there has recently been interest in identifying new low bandgap donor materials which can continue to absorb light at wavelengths greater than 700 nm but with a larger Voc than that of CuPc–C60 devices. Subphthalocyanines (SubPc, chemical structure shown in Fig. 1(a)), appear promising because they yield a high Voc of ∼0.9 V in combination with C60 as an acceptor material. However, in contrast to the phthalocyanines, SubPc does not absorb light at wavelengths above λ = 600 nm, thus limiting its photon harvesting capabilities, and in turn limiting the maximum obtainable Jsc. Here, we characterize films and devices with chloroboron (III) subnaphthalocyanine (SubNc, chemical structure shown in Fig. 1(b)) and show that SubNc is a good candidate molecule for organic solar cells, combining an absorption spectrum which extends to λ = 730 nm with a high Voc of ∼0.8 V.
Thin films of SubNc (13 nm) were grown by thermal evaporation on indium-tin-oxide (ITO), on quartz and on Si–SiO2 substrates. Substrate preparation was as described in ref. 15. Fig. 2 shows the complex index of refraction, ñ = n − ik, as determined on a 50 nm thick SubNc film on SiO2viaspectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE, Sopra GESP-5). The obtained SubNc spectrum shows a peak value of the extinction coefficient, k, of 1.4 at λ = 686 nm. This value corresponds to a large absorption coefficient of 2.6 × 105 cm−1 and ensures that even thin films of SubNc absorb a significant amount of incident light.

Fig. 3 presents the absorption spectrum (Shimadzu UV-1601PC) and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of a 50 nm thick SubNc film on a quartz substrate. The PL measurements were carried out within a temperature range 80–293 K, using a temperature-regulating N2 cryostat, and were carried out in a N2 atmosphere to prevent photo-oxidation. Excitation was performed at λ = 337 nm using a N2-laser and the emission spectra were recorded using a triple-grating monochromator coupled to an intensified CCD camera (PI-MAX from Princeton Instruments). The absorption features correspond well with those obtained with ellipsometry (Fig. 2). The PL of SubNc is located in the near-infrared spectral region with a maximum near λ = 743 nm at 293 K. This peak becomes more pronounced and red-shifts to λ = 761 nm when cooling the sample to 80 K. The increase of PL intensity with decreasing temperature is a consequence of decreased contributions from nonradiative decay channels.
The morphology of the formed films was studied with atomic force microscopy in tapping mode (VEECO Dimension 3000). On the ITO substrate, which has a roughness with root mean square (rms) value 1.73 nm, the SubNc film has a smooth surface with rms = 0.71 nm. Due to this flat film formation, the 13 nm layers covered the ITO anode completely preventing leakage current and shunts in the bilayer solar cells.
Planar heterojunction devices of 3 mm2 area were made using the following stacks: ITO (100 nm)–SubNc (13 nm)–C60 (40 nm)–bathocuproine (BCP, 10 nm)–Al (100 nm) and ITO (100 nm)–SubPc (13 nm)–C60 (32 nm)–BCP (10 nm)–Al (100 nm). Due to a limited supply, SubNc was loaded in the vacuum system as received, and heated for 30 min at 200 °C to remove lightweight impurities before usage. The other organic materials were purified by thermal gradient sublimation (all organic materials were purchased at Aldrich). Current density vs. voltage characteristics in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2AM 1.5 illumination (L.O.T.-Oriel 1000 W Solar Simulator) for the SubPc (solid curves) and SubNc (dashed curves) are shown in Fig. 4. The SubNc device reaches an efficiency of 2.5%, with Voc = 790 mV, FF = 0.49, and Jsc = 6.1 mA cm−2. This value of Voc is substantially higher than that of other red-absorbing phthalocyanines such as CuPc, ZnPc, and H2Pc (typically ∼500 mV), and also considerably higher than that of some other nonplanar phthalocyanines (Voc = 600–670 mV). Compared to SubPc (Voc = 920 mV, Jsc = 5.4 mA cm−2, FF = 0.61, ηp = 3.0%), however, a slight decrease in Voc is observed. The Voc of organic heterojunction devices is for a major part determined by the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the acceptor, Eg. As the red-shift of SubNc is largely associated with a destabilization of the SubNc HOMO,Eg is expected to be smaller for SubNc–C60 than for SubPc–C60 devices, explaining the decrease in Voc. The drop in FF could be due to the low purity of the SubNc material. The red-shifted absorption of SubNc compared to that of SubPc, however, leads to an increase in Jsc from 5.4 to 6.1 mA cm−2.
Measurement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 5, procedure described in ref. 15) shows that both C60 and SubNc contribute to the generated current, with the C60 contribution at λ < 550 nm and that of SubNc at λ > 550 nm. Notably, the EQE remains appreciable over a broad wavelength range, being >10% from λ = 320 nm, where ITO and glass cut off incident light, until the absorption edge of SubNc at λ = 725 nm. The EQE peaks within the SubNc absorption region, with a maximum of 36% at λ = 694 nm. The complex permittivity obtained by ellipsometry is used as the input for a transfer-matrix based optical simulation of the absorption and EQE of the device. This treatment yields exciton diffusion lengths for SubPc and SubNc of approximately 9 nm. This modeling allowed us to fabricate planar heterojunction devices with optimal SubPc, SubNc and C60 thicknesses. Further optimization of the cells would thus require other architectures rather than thickness variation. The simulated absorption spectra for the SubNc and C60 layers within the device structure are shown in Fig. 5, along with their sum, and is observed to follow very closely the measured EQE spectrum. Dividing the EQE spectrum by the absorption allows for a calculation of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), also shown in Fig. 5, which demonstrates that the thin SubNc film (13 nm) employed in the device converts approximately 60–70% of absorbed photons into photocurrent. Most of the excitons generated in SubNc can diffuse through the 13 nm thick film towards the D–A junction, resulting in a high IQE.
In summary, we have characterized the optical and structural properties of SubNc films and introduced their use as a donor material for organic solar cells. The absorption spectrum of SubNc extends to the near-infrared portion of the solar spectrum, with an optical gap of 1.7 eV which is nearly optimal for single heterojunction cells. The SubNc based solar cells also maintain a high Voc of 790 mV, producing a power conversion efficiency of 2.5%. This combination of a strong and narrow red absorption with a high Voc make SubNc–C60 solar cells an excellent candidate for various organic solar cell concepts. For example, the dip in the EQE spectrum between λ = 500 nm and 600 nm indicates that there is still room for improvement for these devices. Since SubNc has a complementary absorption to that of SubPc (c.f.Fig. 2), using these two materials in a tandem cell could lead to an overall better coverage of the solar spectrum.
