In order to investigate the effect of the geometries of perylene diimide (PDI)-based small molecules, five different isomers were synthesized by using a cyclohexane core as a simple sp3-σ core. Diaminocylohexane is such an effective core for the systematic development of many kinds of isomers via geometric tuning as well as for reducing the self-aggregation tendency of PDIs. Depending on the anchoring position of the PDI units on the cyclohexane core (ortho-, meta- and para-), isomers exhibited differences in solubility and crystallinity. Among the studied isomers, ortho-substituted t-OCP was found to have a highly twisted molecular structure which minimizes the strong tendency towards crystallization due to individual PDI moieties. The unique geometrical nature of the t-OCP isomer led to the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE = 6.23%) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). It is mainly ascribed to the formation of a nanophase interpenetrating network with well-balanced carrier mobility in the blend film.

Perylene diimides (PDIs) are the most prominent materials among various non-fullerene acceptors employed in bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-polymer solar cells (PSCs). PDIs have excellent properties such as easy functionalization, strong electron-acceptor character, finely tunable solubility, intense light absorption capability, energy level tunability, and self-assembling properties. However, despite these favorable properties, the strong tendency for π–π stacking between PDI molecules negatively affects the performance of devices based on these species. This limiting factor leads to low solubility and consequently poor miscibility with p-type materials in BHJ-active layers. Moreover, PDIs generally form large aggregates (>1 μm) that allow strong self-trapping of excitons; this severely limits the exciton diffusion/separation process, resulting in relatively low fill factors (FFs) of the corresponding PSCs and a reduced short-circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, aggregate formation by PDIs is a deleterious factor influencing the efficiency of PSCs.

Due to these structural characteristics of PDIs, many strategies have been adopted to reduce the strong intermolecular π–π stacking interactions to enhance the processability of the materials and to form favorable BHJ domain structures. In order to reduce molecular aggregation, several groups introduced “twisted” structures by designing PDI dimers connected at either the N-position (i.e. end-on manner) or bay position (i.e. side-on manner) by direct attachment; non-planar structures have also been employed to modulate the twist angle by anchoring through aromatic rings. Furthermore, in our previous report, the sp3 σ-core (biphenyl cyclohexane) was used as a unique core (that has rarely been applied) to minimize intermolecular π–π stacking of PDI-units. The CP-V comprising 1,1-diphenylcyclohexane as a core unit showed satisfactory performance (PCE = 5.28% for PPDT2FBT:CP-V), even though the sp3 σ-core was used to tether two PDIs. Although the sp3-core was used as a mediating group to connect the PDI units, this core has shown great potential as an effective moiety for PDI-based small molecules.
Cyclohexane is a much simpler core than 1,1-diphenylcyclohexane and is beneficial for reducing the self-aggregation tendency of PDIs as well as for forming various kinds of isomers. Moreover, cyclohexane can be employed to form structural isomers, diastereomers, as well as enantiomers. In contrast to cyclohexane, aromatic rings such as benzene, spiro moieties, and fluorene derivatives, can only form a limited number of isomers. Therefore, cyclohexane has earned distinction as an effective core for the systematic development of many kinds of isomers via geometric tuning. Isomers have the same molecular formula and the same number of atoms, but differ in terms of the geometry of the molecules. Hence, observing different isomers for a compound is very valuable for the comparison of different chemical structures for an in-depth investigation of the specific geometry, because the different properties of isomers result from the explicit geometric characteristics. Previous reports revealed that the geometric characteristics of PDI-based small molecules have a definitive effect on the photovoltaic properties of BHJ-type PSCs.
In this study, we design five new PDI-based isomers containing a cyclohexane core. As shown in Fig. S1, isomers can be classified into broad categories such as constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. To concentrate on the exact effects derived from the geometries of the small molecules, three different constitutional (structural) isomers, t-OCP (ortho-), t-MCP (meta-), and t-PCP (para-) (see Fig. 1), were synthesized and the properties of the respective isomers were investigated. Additionally, two stereoisomers (t-OCP-m and c,t-MCP-m) were also developed (both t-OCP-m and c,t-MCP-m are mixtures). Theoretical calculations using a B3LYP-based DFT method revealed that the structural isomers, t-OCP, t-MCP, and t-PCP, have dihedral angles of 55°, 120°, and 180° between the two PDI subunits, respectively (Fig. 2). Furthermore, it was found that these isomers exhibited differences in solubility and crystallinity. The unique geometry of t-PCP induced high planarity, which is attributed to intermolecular interactions in spite of the anchoring of PDIs onto the sp3-cyclohexane core. In contrast, it should be noted that t-OCP has the most flexibly twisted structure, resulting in good solubility, which is beneficial for processability by reducing self-aggregation of the PDI units.
Additionally, non-fullerene-based BHJ devices were fabricated using these isomers as acceptors with a donor polymer, PPDT2FBT (Scheme S3). The effect of the geometry of these isomers on the device performance in terms of miscibility with the p-type polymer and the effect of the isomers on the internal morphology of the photoactive layer were investigated in detail. In brief, the device employing t-OCP showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) (>6.23%) because of superior nanophase separation that facilitated exciton diffusion/separation and provided a favorable morphology compared to that of the devices employing the other isomers. The differences in the PCEs of the PSCs employing the isomers containing the PDI and cyclohexane core were ascribed to the morphological difference, which is the main limiting factor influencing the device performance, especially affecting the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).

Diaminocyclohexane, as an sp3-core, is greatly beneficial compared with the aromatic core because it can suppress self-aggregation of the PDI subunits. In addition, diaminocyclohexane is advantageous for constructing various kinds of isomers such as structural isomers, diastereomers, enantiomers, etc. Five isomers (t-OCP, t-OCP-m, t-MCP, c,t-MCP-m, and t-PCP) were successfully synthesized by the typical imidization method for coupling the commercially purchased diaminocyclohexanes (C1–C5) and perylene monoimido anhydride (M1), as shown in Schemes S1 and S2. The synthesized isomers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), elemental analysis (EA), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) techniques to verify their corresponding structures. Among the five newly synthesized PDI-based isomers, t-OCP, t-MCP, and t-PCP can be classified as structural isomers depending on the position of anchoring of the PDIs (e.g. ortho-, meta-, and para-) to cyclohexane; these isomers allow systematic comparison of the properties based on the molecular geometry; an enantiomer mixture and a diastereomer mixture were also synthesized (C2 comprises a mixture of (±) optical isomers and C4 is a mixture of compounds with cis- and trans-configurations).

As shown in the theoretical calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis level (Fig. 2 and S2), the dihedral angles between the two PDI subunits gradually increased from 55° for t-OCP to 180° for t-PCP depending on the position of anchoring (e.g. ortho-, meta-, and para-) to the cyclohexane core. It suggested that the introduction of PDI into the ortho-position (t-OCP) results in a more twisted molecular conformation than that obtained with the para-substituted geometry of t-PCP, which is almost planar. The geometry of t-MCP falls between those of t-OCP and t-PCP, as can be expected. The t-OCP isomer, which has the most highly twisted structure, is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene at room temperature. However, t-PCP is soluble only in hot chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene.
The crystalline properties depending on the geometry of the three structural isomers were investigated and compared by preparing crystalline samples, as shown in Fig. S3. The shapes of the crystallites obtained from the vapor diffusion of methanol into a dilute chloroform solution were different; this difference may be governed by the mode of molecular packing. The t-OCP molecule displayed poor crystallite formation, whereas the t-MCP molecule crystallized in the form of wire-shaped crystallites. Moreover, plate-like crystallites were obtained from the solution of t-PCP. Based on the shape of the crystalline objects, it was deduced that the structural isomers might exhibit different crystalline behaviors and have different molecular packing modes.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of these isomers in chloroform solution and in the thin film state are shown in Fig. 3a, b and S4. The absorption maxima (λmax), corresponding absorption coefficients (εmax), and optical bandgaps (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 1. In common, the five isomers have narrow multiple absorption peaks in the range of 400–550 nm in the solution state. The absorption peaks of the molecules in the solution state (526–529 nm) were slightly red-shifted (to ∼535 nm) in the film state, which indicates that the intermolecular π–π interactions were enhanced in the solid state. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of the five isomers obtained from the absorption cut-off were almost identical. The five isomers showed similar intrinsic optical properties due to the use of the sp3-cyclohexane cores and tethering of the PDIs to the core in an end-on manner, while the PDI-based small molecules tethered to aromatic cores or tethered in a side-on manner (i.e. bay-position) were reported to show highly different optical properties. Interestingly, the 0–1 transition of t-OCP and t-OCP-m had relatively higher absorbance than that of t-MCP, c,t-MCP-m, and t-PCP. The solution state spectra indicated that intermolecular interactions existed with PDI units into t-OCP, owing to the smaller angle and the shorter spatial distance between the PDIs anchored in the ortho-sites of cyclohexane than those of the other isomers.

As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1, the emission spectra of the five small molecules are the mirror images of the UV-vis absorption spectra with a Stokes shift of 24 nm in chloroform solution when excited at 450 nm; in the film state, the emission spectra were broadened, similar to the absorption spectra of the film state under excitation at 510 nm.
The electrochemical properties of these isomers in the film state were evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene as the external standard, as shown in Fig. 3c. The reduction onset potentials ranged from −0.59 to −0.63 V and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (−3.81 to −3.85 eV) were almost identical, as estimated from the onset reduction potentials. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were also calculated using the optical band gaps and LUMO energies (Table 1).

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an inverted configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/PPDT2FBT:PDI-based isomers/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/Ag. Diphenylether (DPE) was employed as an additive to optimize the blend morphology to form a nano-phase morphology. The blend ratio of the donor polymer to the PDI-based acceptor for the active layer and the concentration of the solvent additive were varied to optimize the photovoltaic properties; the detailed results are presented in Fig. S6–S8, Tables S2 and S3 (ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP/t-MCP/t-PCP (1:1 w/w) PSCs were acquired under AM 1.5 G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (see Fig. 4a); the detailed optimized photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

The t-OCP-based device employing the ortho-substituted acceptor displayed the best performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 11.17 mA cm−2, a FF of 68.86, and a resultant PCE of 6.23%. The PSC made with t-MCP, had a much lower PCE of 2.45% with a lower Jsc of 5.74 mA cm−2 and an FF of 50.42. The device with t-PCP exhibited an inferior efficiency of 0.56%; in particular, the Jsc of 1.57 mA cm−2 was markedly lower, which is most likely due to the unfavorable internal blend morphology induced by the poor solubility and miscibility with PPDT2FBT and the tendency towards self-aggregation between the t-PCP molecules. The slightly lower-lying LUMO of t-PCP and the different blend morphology and thus different charge recombination and collection rates of the PPDT2FBT:t-PCP blends are possible reasons for the lower Voc (0.66 V) of the PPDT2FBT:t-PCP devices.
For comparison, BHJ devices employing t-OCP-m (a mixture of (±) optical isomers) and c,t-MCP-m (a mixture of cis-and trans-forms) were fabricated under the same conditions as those employed above. The PPDT2FBT:t-OCP-m devices showed higher performance (PCE = 3.88%) than those employing the meta- and para-positioned isomers due to the pliable geometry (i.e. ortho-position). However, with respect to the regularity, the performance of the PSC employing the mixture of enantiomers decreased compared to that of the device with t-OCP.
On the other hand, the devices containing PPDT2FBT:c,t-MCP-m showed better results compared with the PSC bearing PPDT2FBT:t-MCP. The enhanced performance of the devices employing c,t-MCP-m resulted from the improvement of the Jsc (8.18 mA cm−2) and FF (58.22%) relative to those of the t-MCP-containing devices. The mixture of cis- and trans-configurations diminished the high tendency of t-MCP towards aggregation, thereby resulting in a better morphology for achieving high efficiency.
The high Jsc values of the devices depending on the molecular geometry were confirmed from the EQE spectra (Fig. 4b and S6). The EQE spectra of all blend films exhibited broad bands in the 300–720 nm region. The EQE spectra were largely consistent with the optical absorption spectra of the corresponding blend active layers. The maximum EQE values reached 62, 40, and 10% for the PSCs based on t-OCP, t-MCP, and t-PCP, respectively, and the Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra were in good concurrence with those obtained from direct J–V measurements. The highest EQE value achieved with the t-OCP-based PSC indicates efficient photon harvesting and charge collection in the active layers. The significantly improved performance obtained based on the flexible geometry of the isomers in the blend films is due to the better morphology, which plausibly improves charge transport/collection and suppresses charge recombination.

The structural characteristics of the isomers in the solid state were investigated by using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). The 2D-GIXRD patterns of the isomers provided detailed information about the morphological differences in terms of molecular packing and orientation. The corresponding diffraction images, i.e. the out-of-plane and in-plane profiles of the neat film of t-OCP, t-MCP, and t-PCP, are illustrated in Fig. 5a and c. Azimuthal reflection was observed in the 2D-GIXRD patterns of the t-OCP film, whereas the pattern of the t-PCP film indicated crystallinity as evidenced by the (100) in-plane peak at qxy = 0.17 Å−1 and the (010) in-plane peak at qxy = 1.83 Å−1, corresponding to an intermolecular π–π stacking distance of ca. 3.39 Å. The (100) peaks of t-OCP, t-MCP, and t-PCP could be observed in the in-plane direction at qxy = 0.27 Å−1, 0.21 Å−1, and 0.17 Å−1, respectively, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) became narrower in moving from t-OCP to t-PCP (e.g. 0.13 Å−1 for t-OCP, 0.08 Å−1 for t-MCP, and 0.05 Å−1 for t-PCP). From these results, the crystal coherence lengths (or crystallite size) could be estimated according to the Scherrer equation (42.88 Å for t-OCP, 70.93 Å for t-MCP, and 106.47 Å for t-PCP). The crystallite size of t-PCP was the largest; this is attributed to the highly planar geometry driven by the strong tendency towards self-aggregation. From these supporting results, the relatively low Jsc obtained with t-PCP can be explained; on the other hand, the highly twisted structure of t-OCP is expected to undergo good mixing with the p-type polymer, PPDT2FBT, in the BHJ active layer.

As shown in Fig. 5b and d, highly resolved diffraction peaks indicative of higher crystallinity were observed for the PPDT2FBT:t-PCP blends compared to the blends with the other isomers. It can be deduced that the PPDT2FBT:t-PCP blends showed poor miscibility and contained large, individual crystalline domains, resulting from intermolecular self-aggregation between identical species.
Since in the blend films, the (010) diffraction peaks of the polymer are sustained in the qz direction, the face-on orientation of PPDT2FBT was found to be more prominent in the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP film than in the t-MCP and t-PCP blends with PPDT2FBT (Fig. 5d). It is clearly understood that the highly twisted molecular geometry of t-OCP can resist the formation of excessively large domains of single PDI small molecules, and t-OCP exhibited intrinsically suitable crystallinity by maintaining the nanophase blend morphology. These results can lead us to expect more efficient exciton diffusion throughout the continuous pathways of charge carriers to each electrode for the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP blend film, which might result in higher Jsc values for the PSCs employing the t-OCP and PPDT2FBT blend film. Fig. S10 shows the 2D GI-XRD patterns of the neat films and blend films of t-OCP-m and c,t-OCP-m with PPDT2FBT. The molecular orientation of t-OCP-m was the same as that of t-OCP, and the morphological properties of c,t-MCP-m were similar to those of t-MCP from the GI-XRD patterns of the neat films and the corresponding blend films.
The surface and internal morphologies of the photoactive layer are recognized to be important factors influencing the extraction and charge generation properties of organic photovoltaic cells. It is known that properly phase-segregated, crystalline donor and acceptor domains construct favorable morphologies for enhancing the PCEs of bulk-heterojunction PSCs. Therefore, the surface and internal morphologies of the blend active layers were also investigated herein using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The AFM image analyses shown in Fig. 6, S11, and S12 demonstrate that the PPDT2FBT:t-PCP blend film had significantly large crystalline domains (over 1 μm), similar to those observed in the image of the single PDI moiety. However, the t-OCP and t-MCP blend films showed relatively smaller domain sizes; notably, the t-OCP blend film had the finest surface morphology, which might be due to the interruption of the growth of large crystals in the solid state.
Among the three structural isomers, t-OCP formed the finest interpenetrating network structure bearing the donor polymers, producing multi-dimensional inter-connectivity between the crystallites. This might be ascribed to the generation of an interlocking geometrical structure between PPDT2FBT and t-OCP.
The TEM images also provided more direct evidence to support the better performance of the PSC with t-OCP relative to those with t-MCP and t-PCP. As shown in Fig. 6g–i, compared to the blend films with t-MCP and t-PCP, the internal morphology of the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP blend film was much more homogeneous with nanophase segregated crystalline structures; this structure may be more favorable for effective exciton diffusion based on the formation of a continuous charge transport pathway. The results illustrate a higher Jsc value for the t-OCP-based PSC than that achieved with the other structural isomers.

In addition to the surface and internal morphologies, charge recombination is another important factor governing the Jsc and FF of PSCs. Here, the light intensity-dependent Jsc characteristics can reveal the effects of non-geminate bimolecular recombination on the charge extraction properties of PSCs (Fig. 7a and S13a). The power-law dependence of Jsc upon the incident light intensity can generally be expressed as Jsc ∝Pα, where P is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor. If the value of α is close to unity, bimolecular recombination during the charge sweep-out under short-circuit conditions can be considered negligible. The α value of the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP-based devices was 0.97, whereas the corresponding values for the t-MCP and t-PCP-based devices were lower at 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. The suppression of bimolecular recombination correlated with the fine morphology mentioned above could partially account for the higher Jsc of 11.17 mA cm−2 and the fill factor of 68.86% for the devices based on PPDT2FBT:t-OCP relative to those employing the other isomers.

When non-fullerene acceptor materials are utilized for PSCs, achieving balanced hole and electron mobility is very crucial for attaining high-performance devices because this balance is directly related to charge transport and recombination. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the active layers were measured by using the steady-state space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the optimized donor–acceptor blend condition (Fig. 7b, c, S13b, c and Table 2). Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated using the respective conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al configurations. The detailed method for the fabrication of the devices is described in the ESI. The mobilities of the blend films were determined by applying the Mott–Gurney law in the SCLC trap-free regime. The calculated μh, μe, and μh/μe values are summarized in Tables 2 and S4. The devices fabricated with the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP blend had a much smaller μh/μe ratio (1.18) compared to the corresponding values for the other isomer-based devices. These results may explain the relatively high FF (>68%) of the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP BHJ devices because the better-balanced hole/electron ratio of the t-OCP-based devices leads to reduced bimolecular charge recombination.
Furthermore, the device employing the mixture of c,t-MCP-m with cis- and trans-configurations had a well-balanced μh/μe ratio (∼3.01) relative to that of the t-MCP bearing device (∼9.95). The strategy of employing c,t-MCP-m was effective for tuning the tendency towards severe intermolecular aggregation in the t-MCP only device by forming a more favorable internal morphology. These results unambiguously demonstrated that the PPDT2FBT:c,t-MCP-m blend has an appropriate multi-dimensional interconnectivity of donor polymer and acceptor phases between the constituents, compared to PPDT2FBT:t-MCP. The well balanced μh/μe ratio plays an important role in reducing bimolecular recombination, resulting in high Jsc and FF values.

Five PDI-based isomers containing neat cyclohexane as sp3-σ cores were successfully synthesized and systematically studied for application to bulk heterojunction PSCs. By tuning the geometry of the isomers by varying the anchoring position of the PDI units on the cyclohexane core, the intrinsic properties of the isomers and the resulting blend film morphologies were systematically optimized, thereby affording high performance PDI-based non-fullerene solar cells. Among the studied isomers, para-positioned t-PCP was found to have an almost planar structure, inducing poor solubility and promoting self-aggregation of PDI. The t-PCP isomer led to relatively poor power conversion efficiency (PCE = 0.56%) of the BHJ PSCs. On the other hand, the efficiency of the PPDT2FBT:t-OCP-based solar cells reached 6.23% with a higher Jsc and fill factor than those of the other isomer-based PSCs. The higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of t-OCP is mainly ascribed to the highly twisted molecular structure. This structure minimizes the strong tendency towards the crystallization of individual PDI moieties and forms a nanophase interpenetrating network with well-balanced carrier mobility in the blend film. By designing various kinds of isomers, the geometries and crystalline properties of PDI-based small molecules were investigated in depth using indirect and direct visible instrumentation. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the highly congested molecular design of the PDI structure can be an effective tool for achieving more desirable photovoltaic properties in BHJ PSCs.

Pre-patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass (150 nm thick, AMG Corp.) was used as the cathode; the ITO-coated glass (R = 15.0 Ω cm−2) was cleaned by the sequential application of acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol for 10 min each by sonication. Zinc acetate dihydrate (1 g) and ethanolamine (0.28 g) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 24 h for the hydrolysis reaction in air to prepare the ZnO precursor. ZnO, as a cathode buffer layer (40 nm), was prepared on the surface of the washed ITO glass substrates by the spin-coating method (3000 rpm, 40 s) after pre-treating the substrate with UV-ozone for 20 min, followed by thermal annealing at 170 °C for 1 h. The blend solutions of t-OCP, t-OCP-m, t-MCP, c,t-MCP-m, and t-PCP with PPDT2FBT were spin-coated on the ZnO layer from a chlorobenzene (CB) solution with diphenylether (DPE) as an additive. Subsequently, 10 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Ag were deposited on the photoactive layer through shadow masks using a thermal evaporator to produce a 0.04 cm2 active area. A Keithley 2400 SourceMeter was used to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics in the dark and under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2; illumination was supplied by a solar simulator (Oriel, 1000 W).
