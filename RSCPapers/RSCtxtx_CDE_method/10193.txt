A universal synthetic strategy toward thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) derivatives was developed. Three conjugated polymers (PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT) containing N-alkyl-TI as the donor units, 2,1,3-benzodiathiazole (BT) as the acceptor units and thiophene as the spacers were synthesized. The thiophene spacers have a dramatic impact on the physical and electrochemical properties of these copolymers. These polymer donors were used for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs). Preliminarily, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) based on the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al exhibit a large distinction (1.61% for PTIBT, 5.83% for PTITBT and 1.79% for PTIDTBT) at optimal device fabrication conditions. The device based on PTITBT:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) shows the best PCE of 5.83% (Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 13.92 mA cm−2, FF = 61.8%), which represents one of the best performances among PCDTBT analogues. In addition, the Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 is also among the highest Jsc values of all PCDTBT analogues. On the basis of our results, one can conclude that incorporating TI and its derivatives into donor–acceptor conjugated polymers is a feasible and effective way to develop novel donor materials for high efficiency PSC applications.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted an increasing amount of attention due to their potential as a low-cost clean means to convert solar energy into electricity, as well as applications in flexible, lightweight, transparent and large-area devices. With the discovery of efficient photo-induced electron transfer from a conjugated polymer to a fullerene derivative, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC has become the most successful device geometry for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) to date. The PCE of PSCs can be improved by synthesizing novel donor and acceptor materials, increasing the light absorption and optimizing the morphology of the active layer. With great endeavors devoted to molecular engineering of conjugated donor materials, assisted by limited successes with fullerene derivatives, the PCE of BHJ PSCs has been improved from below 1% to over 11% rapidly during the past few decades. However, they still cannot achieve the targeted 15% PCEs and satisfactory lifetime, which are crucial for future commercialization. Despite the development of PSC device fabrication techniques, more promising candidate donor conjugated polymers are still much in demand.

Main chain donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers have dominated the library of donor materials for PSCs because of their intrinsic optical and electronic properties, which can be readily tuned by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor units to acceptor units. Among the reported D–A copolymer donor materials, poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) (as shown in Scheme 1), based on 2,7-carbazole and 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) units, is an excellent parent structure with a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −5.45 eV, showing outstanding stability against oxidation at high temperatures and feasible synthesis. Since PSCs based on PCDTBT were first reported by Leclerc et al. in 2007, the initial PCE of 3.6% in a typical single junction BHJ device has been subsequently improved from 6.0% to 7.5% by BHJ layer thickness optimization, nanomorphology control using mixed solvents or electric contact optimization with electron-transporting layer. In addition, tandem and triple-junction PSCs with PCEs of 8.9% and 9.6% containing PCDTBT-based layer have been reported by Janssen et al. Yet, one must be aware that the polymer PCDTBT possesses a limited absorption range, which results in a medium Jsc. The bandgap of PCDTBT (1.85 eV) is still larger than the value (1.5–1.7 eV) of the ideal polymers for PCE values exceeding 10%. Recently, to further lower the bandgap of PCDTBT, many efforts have been made to develop PCDTBT analogues. For example, Hsu et al. and Yang et al. independently reported PCDTBT-based ladder type polymers with impressive PCEs of up to 5.9%. However, the multiple synthetic steps for ladder-type PCDTBT analogues have restricted the realization for their usage in BHJ devices. Bo et al. have reported systematic investigations of the molecular engineering on both carbazole units and BT units, such as incorporating alkoxy groups on BT units or F-atoms on carbazole units, leading to another series of PCDTBT analogues with higher PCEs of 7.39%. Nevertheless, most of those PCDTBTs also suffer the difficulties of monomer synthesis. A novel strategy for designing PCDTBT analogues is still in demand.
It was reported that poly{N-[1-(2′-ethylhexyl)-3-ethylheptanyl]dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2,6-diyl-alt-4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5′,5′′-diyl} (PDTPDTBT), based on dithienopyrrole (DTP), a carbazole-like unit with N-atom bridged dithiophene, showed a high-lying HOMO (−5.0 eV), a narrow bandgap of 1.46 eV and strong absorption from 300 nm to 850 nm with low Voc (0.52 V) in similar PSC devices. The extended-DTP unit of pentacyclic pyrroloindacenodithiophene (NIDT) has emerged as an electron-rich building block for conjugated polymers used in OFETs and OPVs. For example, Donaghey and Cheng reported that NIDT-based copolymers showed a hole mobility as high as 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OFETs and BHJ solar cells with PC71BM as acceptor affording a PCE close to 3.8%. Both DTP- and NIDT-based copolymers possess relatively high planarity, light-harvesting property and high mobility, due to the rigid and planar feature of thiophene-fused indolo unit. Inspired by the advantages of carbazole- and DTP-based copolymers, copolymers based on the tricyclic donor unit thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI), which is formed by merging DTP and carbazole, are expected to show high performance as donor materials for PSCs. The TI unit has been rarely explored after it was first reported in 1977. TI was first introduced into an organic dye for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) which give a relatively high PCE of 7.8% and medium Voc of 0.7 V as reported in 2010. Interestingly, very recently, Suh et al. reported PTTITBT-h with a PCE of 3.35% and a Voc of 0.81 V. Both works indicate significant efforts should be made to exploit the application of TI in D–A conjugated semiconducting materials.
Herein, a universal synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize TI and its derivatives. A series of PCDTBT analogues, namely PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT, by introducing none, single and double thiophene spacers in TI–BT repeat units were designed and synthesized (see Scheme 1). Among various D–A conjugated polymers, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) has been proven to be an excellent acceptor for high-performance PSC donor materials owing to its stability, moderate electron affinity and planar structure. So, the BT unit was chosen as the acceptor unit. To ensure good solubility in organic solvents, we attached large branched 2-decyltetradecyl (C24) substituents on TI units. We expected the thiophene spacers to tune the energy levels, bandgap and ICT effect from TI to BT to further improve the photovoltaic performance. The resulting copolymers were synthesized, fully characterized and used as donor materials in PSC devices. The PCE of the device based on PTITBT reached 5.83% with a high Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 in a conventional single junction PSC, which is 30.1% higher than that obtained from a PCDTBT-based reference device (PCE of 4.48% in our previous report).

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Energy Chemical, J&K and Suna Tech Inc. (China). They were used as received unless otherwise specified. Anhydrous toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were freshly distilled after being processed with Na and benzophenone under argon atmosphere prior to use. Other solvents and reagents were directly used without further treatment. 1H NMR and 13C NMR data were measured by a Bruker Ultra Shield Plus AV400 spectrometer in CDCl3 (DMSO-d6 or THF-d8 when necessary) solution at 298 K with tetramethylsilane (TMS; d = 0 ppm) as the internal standard (1H NMR: 400 MHz; 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Elemental analysis was performed with a Vario EL III Elementar system (Elementar Analyzen-systeme, Hanau, Germany). Elemental analyses are the average of three runs. All samples were measured simultaneously for C, H, N and S. Weight ratio of O was measured individually with IR detection. The elemental fractions of Br were estimated based on the measured values of other elements (C, H, N, S and O). Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was conducted using a Bruker Autoflex II mass spectrometer using anthracene-1,8,9-triol as matrix. Molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene as standard and o-DCB (HPLC grade) as eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 120 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed with a Mettler DSC823e thermal analyzer and a Rigaku TG-DTA 8120 thermal analyzer, respectively, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectra were collected with a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrometer and a RF-5301 fluorometer, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in dry acetonitrile with a CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer. A gold disc with a diameter of 2 mm, a Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The scan rate was 50.0 mV s−1. The polymer films were drop-cast from chloroform solution (ca. 2 mg mL−1). CV curves were calibrated using ferrocene as the standard, whose oxidation potential was set at −4.73 eV with respect to zero vacuum level in present test conditions. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation HOMO = −e(Eoxonset − Eferroceneonset + 4.73) eV. The LUMO levels of polymer were obtained from the equation LUMO = −e(Eredonset − Eferroceneonset + 4.73) eV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation of thin films cast from o-DCB solutions of polymers was carried out with a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer equipped with a diffracted-beamed monochromator set for Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. The data were collected using a Ni-filtered Cu-target tube at room temperature in the 2θ range from 5° to 45° at an angular rate of 0.2 s per step, with a scan step width of 0.02°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted with a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The samples for TEM observation were obtained by stripping the active layer off the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer and then transferred onto a copper grid. The surface morphology was measured via tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Thermo. Auto Probe C P Res.). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined with a source meter, silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source–monochromator–lock-in system.


BHJ PSCs were fabricated by the following process. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA). They were then treated with Jelight UV-ozone cleaner for 15 min. A thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with a thickness of 40 nm was formed on each ITO substrate by spin coating a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 5000 rpm for 1 min and baking at 140 °C for 15 min. The ITO substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were then transferred into a glove box filled with dried nitrogen to coat the active layer. Polymers were dissolved in o-DCB, and then PC71BM was added. The solution was then heated at 45 °C and stirred overnight at the same temperature. Prior to deposition, the solution was filtered (0.45 μm filters). The solution of copolymer:PC71BM was then spin coated to form the active layer. A cathode made of calcium (2 nm) and aluminum (200 nm thick) was sequentially evaporated through a shadow mask under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Each sample consists of 4 independent pixels defined by an active area of 0.1 cm2. Finally, the devices were encapsulated and characterized in air. The thickness of the active layer was determined by a Dektak 150 profilometer. The photovoltaic performance of the devices was measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 4200 sourcemeter and a Newport Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and was certified to the JIS C 8912 standard. The EQEs of solar cells were analyzed by using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. The surface morphology was measured via tapping mode AFM (Agilent 5400). In order to investigate the hole mobilities of the different polymer films, unipolar devices were prepared following the same procedure except that the Ca/Al cathode was replaced by evaporated gold (40 nm). The hole mobilities were calculated according to space charge limited current theory (SCLC) (see ESI).

In a Schlenck tube (25 mL), M1 (333.4 mg, 0.5 mmol) and 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (193.8 mg, 0.5 mmol) were added. Freshly distilled toluene (12 mL) and 2 M K2CO3 (1.5 mL) were also added to the mixture. After the mixture was flushed with argon for 20 min, 5 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added rapidly. After another flushing with argon for 5 min, the reaction solution was heated to reflux for 36 h under argon atmosphere in the dark. Then, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into a mixture of methanol (500 mL) and 1 M HCl (10 mL) to precipitate the copolymer, PTIBT. The precipitate was filtered off and washed in a Soxhlet apparatus with acetone, hexanes, DCM and CHCl3. The CHCl3 fraction (∼300 mL) was reduced to ∼50 mL and precipitated into methanol (450 mL), filtered through 0.45 μm nylon filter and finally dried overnight under vacuum. A blue to black solid polymer was obtained (183 mg, 69%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, THF-d8) δ (ppm) 8.64–6.70 (m, 6H), 4.08–4.02 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H), 2.17–1.90 (m, 1H), 1.57–1.19 (m, 40H), 0.89 (m, 6H). GPC (120 °C, using o-DCB, with polystyrene as standard): Mn = 11.9 kg mol−1, Mw = 30.7 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.58.


The copolymer PTITBT was synthesized and purified via a similar procedure as for PTIBT. PTITBT was obtained as a black solid with metallic luster (159 mg, 52%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, THF-d8) δ (ppm) 8.53–7.27 (m, 8H), 4.08–4.02 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H), 1.95–1.90 (m, 1H), 1.58–1.18 (m, 40H), 0.86 (m, 6H). GPC (120 °C, using o-DCB, with polystyrene as standard): Mn = 27.3 kg mol−1, Mw = 57.4 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.10.



PTIDTBT was synthesized and purified via a similar procedure as for PTIBT. PTIDTBT was obtained as a deep blue solid with metallic luster. Yield: 225 mg (91%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) 8.12–8.09 (m, 2H), 7.87–7.66 (m, 2H), 7.66–7.54 (m, 2H), 7.54–7.44 (m, 2H), 7.19–6.99 (m, 2H), 4.49–3.29 (m, 2H), 2.06 (m, 1H), 1.77–1.28 (m, 40H), 0.91–0.87 (m, 6H). GPC (120 °C, using o-DCB, with polystyrene as standard): Mn = 11.1 kg mol−1, Mw = 29.2 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.63.


The synthetic routes for TI derivatized monomers M1, M2 and M3 are depicted in Scheme 2. 2,5-Dibromo-1-nitrophenyl (1) was obtained by nitration of the commercially available 1,4-dibromobenzene through a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 (2.8:1, v/v) in dichloromethane (DCM) at 0 °C with a good yield. 2-(4-Bromo-2-nitrophenyl)thiophene (2) and 2,2′-(2-nitro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (6) were prepared by Suzuki coupling reaction with compound 1 and 2-thiophenylboric acid at a molar ratio 1:1 and 1:2.1, respectively. Cadogan annulation of 2 and 6 with 2.5 equivalents of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) in chlorobenzene at 135 °C for 7–12 h led to the formation of 6-bromo-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (3) and 6-(thiophen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (7), respectively.3 and 7 were subjected to alkylation with 1-bromo-2-docyltetradodecane under basic conditions to furnish 6-bromo-4-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (4) and 4-(2-decyltetradecyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (8), respectively. The bromination step transformed 4 into 2,6-dibromo-4-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (M1) with N-bromosuccinimide for NBS in THF quantitatively. Similarly, 2-bromo-6-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-4-(2-decyltetradecyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (M2) was obtained from 8. M3 was obtained by Suzuki coupling reaction with M1 as starting material followed by NBS bromination of compound 5.



M1, M2 and M3 were copolymerized with 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole by Suzuki coupling methodology to afford the three D–A copolymers: poly(4-(2-decyltetradecyl)-2-methyl-6-(7-methylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole) (PTIBT) (Mw = 30.7 kDa, PDI = 2.58), poly(4-(2-decyl-tetradecyl)-2-methyl-6-(5-(7-methylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thia-diazol-4-yl)thio-phen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole) (PTITBT) (Mw = 57.4 kDa, PDI = 2.10) and 4-(2-decyltetradecyl)-2-methyl-6-(5-(7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (PTIDTBT) (Mw = 29.2 kDa, PDI = 2.63), respectively (Scheme 3). The three polymers were purified by Soxhlet extractions using successively improved solvents of acetone, hexanes, dichloromethane and chloroform. The purified polymer was obtained from the chloroform fraction. All polymers show good solubilities in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and THF. They are able to be formed into uniform thin films using spin coating. The chemical structures of all copolymers were determined by 1H NMR. According to the NMR spectra (see Fig. S14–S16 in ESI), it can be clearly found that the unsymmetric TI units make the aromatic hydrogen signal very complicated. This result indicates that the TI units are copolymerized alternatingly with BT units in a random fashion.


The thermal stability of the polymers was analyzed by TGA, which revealed that the 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) were higher than 380 °C (see Table 1, Fig. 1). This high thermal stability is sufficient for their application in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. Thermally induced phase-transition behavior of the polymers was investigated using DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere. However, no obvious crystallization temperatures (TCr) were observed during both the heating and cooling processes.

The optical properties of PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. In chloroform solution, all copolymers exhibit similar profiles with two distinct absorption bands at around 400 nm (weak) and 630 nm (broad, strong) (Fig. 2a). The shorter wavelength absorption comes from the localized π–π* transitions of TI units, while the lower energy band (from 550 to 750 nm) is attributed to the strong ICT between TI and BT segments. Compared to the absorption spectra in the solution state, all polymers showed not only a bathochromic shift but also broadening of the ICT bands in the solid state (Fig. 2b) due to the main chain aggregation and strong interchain electronic interactions in films. Their optical band-gaps (Eoptg) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra are in the following order: PTIBT (1.66 eV) > PTITBT (1.60 eV) > PTIDTBT (1.56 eV) (Table 2). Obviously, the band-gaps are much narrower than those of PCDTBT (1.85 eV). The difference of the λmax as well as Eoptg points out that the donor strength of TI unit is larger than that of carbazole, which is in agreement with earlier studies in that the replacement of benzene ring with thiophene results in a reduction of Eoptg due to the increase of ICT transition in the polymer backbone. Besides, the deep blue color of PTITBT and PTIDTBT solutions is observed unlike the red color of PCDTBT in solution. Compared to PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT with one and two additional thiophene rings in repeat unit, respectively, exhibited the red-shifted π–π* transition band due to longer conjugated length. However, this modification of incorporation of thiophene spacers also results in a blue-shift of the ICT band of PTIDTBT due to the weaker donor–acceptor interaction. The absorption coefficients deduced from the solution absorption spectra are in the following order: PTITBT > PTIBT > PTIDTBT (see Table 2). This order indicates that PTITBT possesses better light absorbing capability in the visible light region, which gives PTITBT the potential for higher performance for PSC application. These results apparently suggest that the conjugation length and ICT transition both can be finely tuned by incorporating thiophene spacers in the repeat unit of TI-based copolymers.

The electrochemical properties of the copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in order to evaluate the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers (Fig. 3, Table 3). The polymers showed stable and reversible process both in oxidative and reductive scans, which are important prerequisites for p-type semiconductors. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these copolymers were calculated from onset oxidation potential (Eoxonset) and the onset reduction potential (Eredonset), respectively. The oxidation onsets of the polymers PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT are estimated to be 0.54, 0.49 and 0.41 V, which correspond to HOMO levels of −5.27, −5.22 and −5.14 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels of PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT are estimated to −3.66, −3.65 and −3.63 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels are higher than that of PC71BM acceptor (−4.30 eV) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. According to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers, the electronic bandgaps were calculated to be 1.61, 1.57 and 1.51 eV for PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT, indicating that the bandgaps are becoming narrower with the introduction of the thiophene spacers. Compared to the bandgap of PCDTBT at 1.85 eV, all three copolymers show narrower bandgaps, indicating they can harvest more solar photons and provide remarkable short-circuit current densities (Jsc). In addition, the LUMO energy levels of these copolymers are around −3.65 eV, which is closer to the LUMO level of PC71BM (−4.3 eV) than that of PCDTBT (−3.5 eV). The material-design rules described by Scharber et al. suggested that the PCEs of a BHJ PSC should be much more sensitive to changes of the donor LUMO level compared to variations of the donor bandgap. On the basis of these rules, the estimated PCE from the Eoptg and the LUMO value of TI-containing copolymers should be higher than that of PCDTBT (6.5%), indicating that TI-containing copolymers are highly promising materials for PSCs.

Theoretical calculations were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) basis set. Only the dimer compound of each polymer with all the alkyl side chains replaced by methyl groups was subjected to the calculation in order to simplify the procedure. The calculated HOMO levels for PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT are −5.05, −4.89 and −4.79 eV, respectively. According to the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels, the calculated bandgaps for the polymers are 2.14 (PTIBT), 1.86 (PTITBT) and 1.73 eV (PTIDTBT). Obviously, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the bandgaps are in agreement with the experimental results from CV investigation. As illustrated in the figures in Table 4, for all polymers, the LUMO energy levels are mainly located around the BT derivative units, while the HOMO energy levels are delocalized over the polymer backbones, showing that the HOMO energy levels are determined by the donor and acceptor units of the polymer. D1 is a dihedral angle between the donor and acceptor units, and D2 is a dihedral angle between two repeat units of the copolymer. The dihedral angles between donor and acceptor units in PTITBT (D1 = 23.73°) and in PTIDTBT (D1 = 20.97°) are smaller than those in PTIBT (D1 = 33°), which leads to a good co-planarity of copolymers and is beneficial to intrinsic π–π stacking and ICT from donor units to acceptor units. Interestingly, with one thiophene-spacer introduced, PTITBT shows the smallest D2 of 0.45°, which also reveals PTITBT has the best co-planar backbone and intrinsic π–π stacking. These calculated results are in good agreement with the absorption properties both in solution and in solid states.

To gain a better understanding of the molecular packing and solid-state morphology, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and UV-vis absorption were both carried out on thermally annealed thin films spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution (15 mg mL−1) on Si/SiO2 substrates. As shown in Fig. 4a, each polymer film showed a strong halo at about 23.5°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.8 Å, which is associated with the π–π stacking distance. After being annealed at 150 °C for 5 min in N2, the intensity of these reflection halos increased, which indicated that thermal annealing can improve the packing order of these polymers. Such short distance indicates that the polymer backbones are of a relatively planar conformation and can be closely stacked in the solid state. In addition, the thermally annealed films showed stronger absorption than the as-prepared films (without thermal annealing). This phenomenon implies that thermal annealing can improve their intermolecular packing and enhance their light-harvesting capability.


BHJ photovoltaic cells were fabricated with the standard architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al (Fig. 5). The asymmetric PC71BM was selected as the acceptor owing to its stronger light absorption in the visible region than PC61BM. o-DCB was used as the solvent to make a solution of active layer for spin-coating. The photovoltaic properties of all three copolymers were screened by blending copolymers and PC71BM in o-DCB in different weight ratios and different spin-coating speeds. Thermal annealing and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive during the spin-coating process were both employed to optimize the device performance. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all PSCs under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) are depicted in Fig. 6 and in ESI. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters for all the polymers including open circuit voltages (Voc), short circuit current densities (Jsc), fill factors (FF), and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are summarized in Table 5.

After the optimization, PSCs fabricated with blends of polymer and PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:3 gave the best performance for each polymer. As a result, PTITBT-based PSC devices showed a high PCE of 5.83% with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 13.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.8% after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. Additionally, the PCE values of PTITBT are still higher than 5.1% with thermal annealing at 25 °C and 80 °C (Fig. 6(c)). In sharp contrast, the devices based on PTIBT:PC71BM and PTIDTBT:PC71BM counterparts only achieved low PCEs of 1.57% and 1.79% after thermal annealing at 150 °C and 80 °C, respectively. Clearly, the Voc values for the optimized PSCs based on PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT were directly proportional to their HOMO levels. Note that PTITBT:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) demonstrated a hole mobility of 1.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of PTIBT (9.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PTIDTBT (1.31 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). This is in good agreement with its high current density and fill factor. In addition, PTITBT exhibited the highest Jsc and PCE values owing to its best light-harvesting capability among these materials. It is worth noting that the Jsc of PTITBT-based devices, to the best of our knowledge, is among the highest Jsc values reported to date for PCSs based on PCDTBT analogues, in good agreement with the extended absorption of sunlight through the low bandgap and broadened absorption band of PTITBT. The PCE of 5.83% for PTITBT-based PSCs is 74% higher than that of the TI-containing copolymer reported in the literature (PCE of 3.35%) and about 30.1% higher than that obtained from the PCDTBT-based reference device (PCE of 4.48%).
It is found that the device performance can be slightly improved by thermal annealing treatment (Table S1 in ESI). Especially for the devices based on PTITBT/PC71BM blends, the PCEs were improved from 5.1% to 5.83% with enhanced Voc (0.66 to 0.69 V) and FF (54.8% to 61.8%). This is in good agreement with the results shown in Fig. 4a and b that thermal annealing will enhance their absorption capability and the molecular packing order in film states. AFM was also utilized to gain insight into the surface morphology of the optimized PTITBT/PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blended films on the top of PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO glass substrate (Fig. 7). After being annealed at 150 °C for 15 min, the film had a uniform feature and possessed a large root mean square roughness of 2.16 nm presumably due to the strong aggregation of the polymer main chains, resulting in the favorable morphological phase separation. Thus, it is reasonable that PTITBT shows a high Jsc.
The effect of the additive treatment of DIO on the PSC performance is complex (as shown in Fig. 6(b) and Table 5). For example, the PCE value of PTIBT-based devices was improved from 1.23% to 1.61% due to the increased Voc from 0.66 to 0.83 V. As to PTIDTBT-based devices, the FF was dramatically improved to 67.6%, but the Jsc decreased from 6.29 to 3.93 mA cm−2. Compared to the nonadditive PTITBT-based device, the device processed with DIO additive exhibited lower performance with decreased PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF (see Table 5; Table S1 in ESI). To gain more insight into the performance changes upon the introduction of DIO additive, the morphology of the PTITBT/PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blended films was investigated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 8, nanoscale phase separation of PTITBT and PC71BM occurs. The fibrillar-like light regions in TEM images are attributed to PTITBT aggregation. The size of PC71BM aggregates in DIO-processed film is larger than that in nonadditive processed blends, which limits the donor/acceptor connecting interface to result in a performance decrease.
To evaluate the accuracy of measurements, the EQE curves of the PSC devices fabricated from the blend of the corresponding polymer and PC71BM (1:3, w/w) in o-DCB solution were measured under illumination of monochromatic light. As presented in Fig. 6(d), a significant and broader photon-to-current response at the short wavelength region than the corresponding absorption spectra in solutions (Fig. 2(b)) can be observed for each polymer-based solar cell, which indicates the contribution from PC71BM to the photocurrent is very pronounced. The EQE values of the devices for PTITBT-based PSCs reached 50% for nearly the entire visible range of 350–700 nm and a maximum EQE of 61% at 420 nm. Significantly, all Jsc values calculated from the integration of the EQEs of the devices agree well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements. In the case of the other two polymers, they show maximum EQE value of 43% at 435 nm for PTIDTBT and 32% at 403 nm for PTIBT. Considering that PTITBT possesses the highest absorption coefficient (Table 2) and the strongest light-absorbing capability among all polymers (Fig. 4b), PTITBT-based devices can effectively absorb more photons from solar radiation, consistently, exhibit high Jsc values and an improvement in the device performance. Note that the theoretical Jsc values obtained by integrating the product of EQE data under AM 1.5G solar spectrum are 5.42 mA cm−2, 13.55 mA cm−2 and 6.86 mA cm−2 for PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT, respectively (Table 5; Fig. S4, ESI), which are in good agreement with the measured Jsc within a few percent, indicating the accuracy of the J–V measurements.

In summary, a universal synthetic strategy towards the electron rich, N-bridged building block of thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) has been presented. The synthesis of three novel analogues of PCDTBT, namely PTIBT, PTITBT and PTIDTBT, by incorporating TI, BT and thiophene spacers has been described, aiming to render energy levels as well as the light absorption properties toward further improving the photovoltaic parameters. Both experimental results and theoretical simulation have revealed that the incorporation of thiophene spacers can have a dramatic impact on the resulting polymers, such as optical and electrochemical properties, energy levels, charge-carrier transporting capability and molecular packing. The resulting copolymers show the desired narrower band gaps (∼1.6 eV, with HOMO levels of −5.14 to −5.27 eV) than PCDTBT (1.85 eV, with HOMO level of −5.45 eV), possibly allowing higher Jsc.

The photovoltaic performances of the PSCs using blends of the resulting copolymers with PC71BM have been investigated and are consistent with their chemical and electronic structures. Under similar device fabrication conditions, the PTITBT-based devices showed a much higher efficiency than the corresponding PTIBT- and PTIDTBT-based devices (5.83% vs. 1.61% and 1.79%). According to the EQE evaluation, the improvement is mainly the result of much enhanced Jsc, which is in good agreement with the largest absorption coefficient of PTITBT and its strongest absorption properties in thin-film form among all three polymers. The optimized device based on PTITBT:PC71BM (1:3, w/w, 150 °C thermal annealing for 15 min) demonstrates a PCE of 5.83% (Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 13.92 mA cm−2, FF = 61.8%) under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2), indicating PTITBT is a promising donor material for PSC application. The high Jsc obtained from the PTITBT-based device is among the highest Jsc values for PSCs based on PCDTBT analogues. This work provides a feasible strategy for a novel family of TI-based copolymers for high-performance PSCs and reports useful insights into a new electron-rich unit for D–A conjugated copolymers. Further exploration of PTITBT-based PSCs is still warranted for high-performance PCEs by means of controlling the film morphology with other additives such as DMSO and improving the electric contacts.
