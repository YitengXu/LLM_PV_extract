Conjugated oligomers with various ratios of cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) to benzothiadiazole (BT) repeating units are reported. These oligomers can be polymerised to high molecular weight polymers (Mn > 100k) by oxidative polymerisation using iron(III)chloride. The electronic properties of these materials were examined by cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis spectroscopy and the results compared to those calculated using density functional theory (DFT). Polymers with optimum ratios of CPDT:BT (2:1) units show hole mobilities in excess of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as the active layer in organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices of these polymers with PCBM as the electron acceptor show a power conversion efficiency of 2.1% when processed in the absence of any additives. The reported OFET performance is significantly higher than the parent PCPDTBT alternating copolymer (CPDT:BT = 1:1) and also shows a moderate improvement in OPV performance.


Conjugated polymers have demonstrated tremendous potential for applications: the active layers of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors (OFETs) and photovoltaic devices (OPVs). One of the important advantages of conjugated macromolecules is the ability of these materials to be processed from solution. This enables the fabrication of electronic devices such as OPVs by low cost, large area, high throughput production techniques such as gravure, inkjet and screen printing or slot-die coating. The performance of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) based OPV devices has rapidly improved recently, as increased structural diversity of organic materials and improved processing protocols have led to record power conversion efficiencies in excess of 8%.

The most extensively investigated semiconducting polymers for application in OPVs are derivatives of polythiophenes. In these polymers the introduction of fused ring systems such as cyclopentadithiophenes (CPDTs) (the homopolymer, PCPDT, is depicted in Chart 1),thienothiophenes, dithienopyrroles and dithienosiloles leads to extended conjugation and enhanced intermolecular stacking. Furthermore the introduction of acceptor units such as benzothiadiazole (BT) into these polymers leads to higher performance in OFETs and OPVs. The charge transfer between donor and acceptor units leads to a reduction in the optical band gap and more effective light harvesting in OPV devices. For example, the onset for absorption of poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBT) (Chart 1) is around 1.4 eV and this polymer has been used to fabricate OPV devices in combination with fullerene derivatives with power conversion efficiencies of up to 5.5%.
Effective capture of solar light in OPVs requires polymer films that are thick enough to absorb all incident photons with energies above the band gap (>100 nm). In general to attain these film thicknesses by spin coating, polymers with good solubilities are necessary and for PCPDTBT this has led to the substitution of the cyclopentadithiophene group with two 2-ethylhexyl chains.
However the use of thick polymer films requires carrier mobilities that are high enough to enable efficient extraction of charges from the device and in PCDPTBT it has been shown that higher molecular weight polymers show improved carrier mobilities. It is well known that oxidative polymerisation of oligomeric precursors by iron(III)chloride gives regioregular polymers with large molecular weights. Previously, we reported that oxidative polymerisation of alkylated cyclopentadithiophenes gave polymers with molecular weights (Mn) in excess of 150000. Dehalogenative polycondensation using zerovalent nickel catalysts gave lower molecular weight polymers (Mn = 8000) and a slightly larger band gap (1.7 vs. 1.8 eV). Mullen et al. studied PCPDTBT having linear hexadecyl groups at the bridging carbon. They showed that polymers with molecular weights (Mn) in excess of 35000 have remarkable hole mobilities (>3 cm2 V−1 s−1) determined from OFET measurements. The hexadecyl substituents at the 4-position of the cyclopentadithiophene lead to stronger intermolecular stacking and better alignment in the solid state than the branched chains. Unfortunately the solubility of the linear alkyl substituted PCPDTBT is lower than that of the branched alkyl substituted polymer, and this reduces the suitability of this polymer for use in OPVs.
Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of PCPDTBT oligomers that contain different ratios of cyclopentadithiophene donors to benzothiadiazole acceptors. These oligomers were polymerised by oxidation using iron(III)chloride to form high molecular weight polymers with different component CPDT:BT ratios in the main chain. The 2-ethylhexyl group was used as the substituent of the 4,4-position of cyclopentadithiophene as this gives a higher solubility of the polymer, leading to higher molecular weight during the polymerisation reaction. Cyclic voltammetry, optical absorption and theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were employed to estimate the structures and the electronic states of the new materials. These materials were used to fabricate OFET and bulk heterojunction OPV devices with fullerene acceptors. OFET devices prepared using these polymers show significantly higher mobilities than those reported for previous amorphous cyclopentadithiophene polymers.

Oligomers 1 and 2 were synthesised by palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction of three equivalents of mono-brominated cyclopentadithiophene, an equivalent amount of dibrominated cyclopentadithiophene and two equivalents of the benzothiadiazole diboronic acid pinacolate ester, as shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 and 2 were isolated by column chromatography. Yields of these molecules were relatively low (30% for 1 and 10% for 2) as the reaction can also produce higher oligomers. However this simple reaction route provides these oligomers without further synthesis steps directly. Fig. 1 (top) shows the 1H NMR spectra of 1 and 2 in deuterated chloroform solution (see ESI for H–H COSY, C–H COSY and H–H NOESY).

Peaks Ha–Hd for 1 and Ha–Hf for 2 were assigned to the aromatic region and peaks around 2.1–0.6 ppm were assigned to hydrogen atoms of 2-ethylhexyl groups. Three signals are observed for the cyclopentadithiophene hydrogen Ha in 1, this signal multiplicity is associated with the presence of the four racemic ethylhexyl side chains and triad level tacticity with mm, mr and rr placements. The 1:2:1 ratio is consistent with racemic side chains and Bernoullian statistics. In oligomer 2 six signals are observed which are consistent with tetrad structures due to the presence of six racemic side chains and mmm, mmr, mrm, rmr, mrr, and rrr placements. The ratio of signal intensities are 1:2:1:1:2:1 and this is again consistent with Bernoullian statistics for racemic side chains.
The cyclopentadithiophene copolymer (3a) was synthesised by an oxidative polymerisation of monomer 1 using iron(III)chloride in chlorobenzene, as shown in Scheme 2. Polymer 3a was de-doped by treatment with hydrazine and purified by precipitation in methanol. Interestingly, this polymer was of high molecular weight (Mn = 107000) when compared to the previous reports of PCPDTBT (Mn = 5000–55000) obtained by Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling polymerisation. It is well known that the molecular weight of polymers is one of the factors that controls the performance of polymeric electronic devices. Higher molecular polymers have less defects as well as improved thin film processability. The polydispersity index of 3a was slightly lower (2.29) than the previously reported poly(cyclopentadithiophene) (PCPDT) (2.7–3.3) obtained by this method. This broader molecular weight distribution compared to some polymers obtained by polycondensation is due to the poor control achievable in oxidative polymerisation using iron(III)chloride.Copolymer 4a was also synthesised by an analogous method and was determined to have a lower molecular weight (Mn = 46500) and higher polydispersity index (5.89) than 3a, as shown in Scheme 2.
The1H NMR spectra of 3a and 4a show broad peaks around 8.1 and 7.9 ppm that are assigned to the thiophene rings and the hydrogen atoms of the benzothiadiazole group, as shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). Content of Fe in polymers was determined by elemental analysis using an ICP-MS instrument to obtain 0.044% for 3a and 0.055% for 4a.
An electrochemical polymerisation of 1 and 2 afforded polymers 3b and 4b, respectively, enabling comparison of the optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers obtained by oxidative reaction (3a and 4a). The polymerisation of cast films of 1 and 2 on a platinum plate was carried out by scanning the potential between −2.0 and +0.8 V vs.Ag/AgNO3 in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6. The electrochemically prepared polymers were of lower molecular weight (Mn = 21300 for 3b and Mn = 11800 for 4b) than the corresponding polymers obtained by oxidative polymerisation. Additionally, these polymers also had a high polydispersity index (2.56 for 3b and 3.14 for 4b) for lower molecular weight.

The absorption spectra of oligomers (1, 2) and polymers (3a, 4a) were measured in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution and as a thin film. They were compared with those of PCPDT and PCPDTBT, as shown in Fig. 2. Oligomer 1 showed an absorption maximum at 563 nm which was similar to the homopolymer of cyclopentadithiophene (PCPDT, 574 nm) in THF solution. Oligomer 2 showed an even longer wavelength absorption at 631 nm. Copolymers 3a and 4a showed a maximum absorption above 700 nm, which is slightly higher than PCPDTBT (693 nm). This red shift of the absorption bands could be explained by a higher conjugation and delocalisation of electrons for the polymers 3a and 4a because of the presence of bis-cyclopentadithiophene segments in these polymers, whereas PCPDTBT does not contain bis-cyclopentadithiophene segments. The higher molecular weight of these polymers may also lead to the red shift. Thin films of 3a and 4a also showed a slightly higher λmax than that of PCPDTBT. However the onset of absorption was observed at a shorter wavelength than PCPDTBT resulting in a slightly larger optical gap (1.54 eV for 3a and 1.55 eV for 3b) than that of PCPDTBT (1.44 eV).

The electronic properties of polymers 3a and 4a were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. 3. The polymers showed reversible oxidation and reduction peaks at 0.5 and −1.5 V vs.Ag/AgNO3. The reduction peak areas of 3a and 4a were smaller than that of PCPDTBT due to the lower ratio of the electron accepting benzothiadiazole group in the polymer main chain. However, the redox peak positions of all of these polymers were equal to one another within the errors of the experiment. Electrochemical band gaps (Eg-ec) were estimated from the onset of these redox peaks to afford Eg-ec = 1.70 eV for 3a, Eg-ec = 1.71 eV for 4a and Eg-ec = 1.81 eV for PCPDTBT, respectively.
Electrochemical oxidation of oligomers 1 and 2 gave the corresponding copolymers 3b and 4b. During potential scans, the visible colour of the films on platinum plates changed from purple for 1 and blue for 2 to green. The polymers (3b and 4b) showed lower wavelength shift than 3a and 4b. The restricted movement of monomers in films might give reactions between 2- and 3- or 3- and 3-positions of CPDT leading to less conjugation. On the other hand, 3b and 4b showed smaller electrochemical band gaps (1.28 and 1.29 eV) than those of 3a and 4a, presumably as transportation of counter ions was restricted in polymer films.
The electron affinity and ionisation potential of the oligomers were estimated from the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied Kohn Sham orbitals of oligomers. These were calculated using density functional theory (B3LYP functional, 6-31g* basis set). The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies for oligomers of length one, two and three repeat units are shown in Fig. 4. The values are uncertain around 0.1 eV as a result of the limited level of theory and variations in chain conformation expected experimentally. The energy levels of the two polymers agree with each other within the uncertainty in the method and also agree with the optical gaps determined from the UV-vis spectroscopy for these polymers (see Table 1). However, we note that increasing oligomer length has a large effect on the energy of the HOMO, because of the increased delocalisation of the HOMO on the cyclopentadithiophene units, whilst the LUMO energy is less affected as the LUMO is mostly localised on the BT units. We have also calculated the energies for cis- and trans-oligomers of benzothiadiazole and find that the values agree to within the uncertainty in the method.

The performance of compounds 1–4 in OFET devices was investigated. Bottom gate, top contact OFETs were fabricated on wafers consisting of OTS-treated SiO2/p++Si. The compound was dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and spin coated at 3k rpm for 60 seconds. The same device configuration and fabrication technique was used for all measurements, with a channel length of 60 μm and a channel width of 2000 μm, defined by shadow masking of the gold source and drain electrodes during thermal evaporation. Mobilities were extracted from field-effect transistor transfer characteristics operated in the saturation regime.

The results of OFET measurements for all devices are summarised in Table 2. The hole mobility of oligomer 1 is shown as 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with oligomer 2 showing no field-effect operation due to dewetting on the OTS substrate, preventing a uniform film formation. Polymer 3a demonstrated the highest mobility, μh = 9.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was improved to 1.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing for 1 hour at 100 °C under nitrogen (Fig. 5a). This mobility is approximately four times higher than PCPDTBT measured under the same conditions. Polymer 4a showed lower hole mobility (μh = 3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than 3a, but again higher than PCPDTBT (Fig. 5b) and like 3a, a small increase in hole mobility was observed after annealing the polymer for 1 hour at 100 °C under nitrogen (μh = 4.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The increase in hole mobility caused by annealing is small, which is probably equated to removal of an residual solvent in the film and improved molecular packing (discussed in Section 2.2).

Photovoltaic devices of 3a and 4a were fabricated on glass substrates with an indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode. The active layers were spin cast from chlorobenzene solutions of the polymer mixed with C61-PCBM; for polymer 3a, the PC61BM content was varied between 33 and 75%, whilst for 4a, the content was kept at 50%. Spin speeds were varied between 1 and 3k rpm for each polymer and blend ratio to ensure the optimal thickness of the active layer was achieved. In addition, two different active layer drying conditions were tested: room temperature and 100 °C. Prior to coating, the polymer:fullerene blends were allowed to dissolve for 1 week on a hotplate stirrer and filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The cathode electrodes consisted of 3 nm of lithium fluoride (LiF) followed by 80 nm of aluminium (Al), which were used to define an active area of 0.13 cm2. In order to prevent light from outside the active area over-calculating PCE, measurements were conducted with an aperture mask. As a comparison, PCPDTBT-C61-PCBM OPVs were simultaneously tested. From previous studies, the optimised fullerene content for this material system was found to be 78% blended with chlorobenzene and spin cast with a thickness of ∼130 nm. In Fig. 6, the best performing current density–voltage curves (dark and under AM1.5G illumination) of polymer 3a and 4a blended with C61-PCBM are shown and the data for all experiments are summarised in Table 3.

For polymer 3a, the best performing blend ratio was with a fullerene content of 50 wt%, where a PCE of 2.12% was measured, which shows a relative increase of ∼9% PCE over an optimised device using PCPDTBT. Data were obtained from 12 devices with a spread in absolute measurement of ±0.068 for 3a and ±0.096 for PCPDTBT, so is therefore a distinguishable difference. It is worth noting that all these values were obtained from the OPV devices without adding any additives to the active layer to control film morphology.
OPVs fabricated with polymer 3a exhibited a slightly lower VOC than with PCPDTBT (∼40 mV drop), which is to be anticipated owing to the lower HOMO level of polymer 3a; (HOMO [3a] = −4.93 eV, HOMO [PCPDTBT] = −5.00, from CV data). However, this drop in performance was offset by the increase in FF (∼16% relative increase) and JSC (∼6% relative increase). This increase in JSC is observed despite the optical band gap of 3a being larger than that of PCPDTBT, so the overlap to the AM1.5 spectrum is actually slightly worse. However, the additional factor that contributes to the improvement of the devices is the increase in hole mobility of 3a (Table 2). The increase in hole mobility enables the series resistance, RS to decrease, which contributes to higher JSC and improved charge transport properties, which is reflected in the higher FF. Polymer 4a exhibited the worst OPV performance, with a PCE limited to 0.77%. The material appears to suffer from poor solubility in chlorobenzene, so filtering the blended solution is likely to remove a large quantity of polymer, which reflects in the poor JSC value measured with 4a.
For all blended solutions tested with either 3a or 4a, it was observed that annealing the BHJ at 100 °C decreased the OPV performance (∼18% relative drop overall), predominantly as a result of decreases in FF and JSC. This is in contrast to OFET data, which showed an improvement in device performance after annealing. The likely reason for this deterioration relates to a worse morphology for efficient charge separation and transfer and the fact that the slow drying process results in a more favourable morphology. It is also very apparent that the performance is highly sensitive to blend ratio and that higher polymer content degrades the device performance. It is shown that the performance of the 67 wt% PCBM content device blend ratio maintained a reasonable performance (∼18% relative difference in PCE), but with the 33 wt% blend ratio, performance dropped off significantly (∼72% relative decrease in PCE); the primary reason for this was a large decrease in JSC. For the 75 wt% PCBM content device, performance is dominated by the transport properties of PCBM and the low visible absorption causing a significantly drop off in OPV performance.
The surface morphology of 3a:PCBM films were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Large domains with diameters in the size of about 100 nm were observed for the film prepared from a solution of 33 wt% composition ratio. The likely source of these domains is poor solubility of polymer 3a resulting in aggregation. The observed domain size decreased to 10–20 nm for the 50 wt% PCBM content film. It appears that increasing the PCBM concentration decreased the domain size and the film surface became smoother in the topographic images. Sariciftci et al. have reported related morphologies for PCBM:poly[2-(methyldimethyloctyloxy)]-p-phenylenevinylene (4:1 wt%) blend films. Changing the spin-casting solvent from toluene to chlorobenzene decreased the domain size from around 500 to 100 nm and increased the efficiency from 0.9 to 2.5%. In P3HT:PCBM blend films devices with domains of 10–30 nm showed the highest power conversion efficiencies (4–5%). Similarly, the best performance for 3a:PCBM films was found for blends of a 50 wt% ratio which also showed domain sizes in the region of 10–20 nm.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the nature of the molecular stacking in polymer 3a in thin films and with C61-PCBM (see Fig. 8). Pristine films of the neat film prior to annealing showed a broad feature with a peak at 2θ = 23° (3.9 Å), likely due to the π-stacking between polymer chains and no further intermolecular stacking. After annealing, the peak 2θ = 23° (3.9 Å) increased, suggesting that annealing enables closer molecular packing of polymer 3a, explaining the reason for increase in OFET performance after annealing. The observed crystallinity is similar to XRD studies undertaken on PCPDTBT:PCBM, but the π-stacking is slightly lower in PCPDTBT:PCBM (the corresponding intermolecular distances measured at 3.7 Å). XRD studies on polymer 3a with C61-PCBM showed an additional peak at 2θ = 8.6° (9.02 Å) that is likely to correspond to the separation of the polymer main chains. The peak is strong, but has a spread of ∼10°, indicating domains of material with a range of intermolecular spacings between 7.5 Å and 9.4 Å. Both peaks seem to decrease with annealing, consistent with the behaviour of PCPDTBT:C61-PCBM films.

In this paper, the synthesis of narrow band gap oligomers and polymers based on cyclopentadithiophene and benzothiadiazole units is reported. The oligomers (1 and 2) were polymerised by oxidative reaction using iron(III)chloride to give high molecular weight polymers up to Mn = 107000. The polymers were used to fabricate OFET devices and the best performing polymer (3a) exhibited a hole mobility of 1.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. One of the reasons for this high mobility for the amorphous like polymer is probably due to high molecular weight of polymer 3a obtained by the oxidative polymerisation reaction. The best performing device shows a power conversion efficiency of 2.1% for the polymer:fullerene blend ratio of 1:1 wt%, which shows a moderate improvement over devices fabricated using the related PCPDTBT.


All synthesis experiments were performed under an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Polymer molecular weight was determined by GPC in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution using a Viscotek GPC max VE2001 and a Viscotek VE3580RI detector (referenced to polystyrene standards). 1H NMR spectra were obtained using Bruker 300 MHz and 500 MHz spectrometers. FABMS was recorded using a MICROMASS TRIO-2000 in the presence of benzyl alcohol as matrix. Elemental analysis for C, H, N and S was undertaken using an Elementar Vario EL-III and for Fe, it was determined by an ICP-MS instrument. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. CV was performed at 100 mV s−1 in a BASI Epsilon electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode cell, Ag/AgNO3 as reference electrode, platinum wire as counter electrode and polymer film on a platinum plate as the working electrode in an argon-purged anhydrous 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate acetonitrile solution at room temperature. XRD patterns were recorded using a Phillips X-PERT PRO diffractometer with CuKα1 (1.54060 Å) irradiation. In order to model the electron affinity and ionization potential, the highest occupied Kohn Sham orbital and the lowest unoccupied Kohn Sham orbital of oligomers without the side chains were computed using density functional theory (DFT). Becke's three parameter exchange and the Lee-Young—Parry correlation functionals (B3LYP) were used together with a double split basis set with added polarisation basis functions (6-31g*).


2-Bromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (1.17 g, 2.42 mmol), 2,6-dibromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (0.450 g, 0.805 mmol) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) (0.624 g, 1.61 mmol), K2CO3 aqueous solution (6 ml, 2 M) and a drop of Aliquat 336 (phase transfer catalyst) were dissolved in 20 mL toluene in a 50 mL Schlenk tube. The solution was purged with nitrogen gas for 30 minutes, then tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.100 g, 0.087 mmol) was added. After the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 24 hours, the organic layer was separated and dried in vacuo. The reaction residue was subjected to chromatography on silica gel. Elution with petroleum ether (bp. 40–60 °C) gave a purple oil-solid after solvent removal in vacuo. This was identified as oligomer 1 (Rf value = 0.46) (0.460 g, 30%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.08, 8.06, 8.05 (s, 2H, 3-cyclopentadithiophene, the ratio was 1:2:1 due to racemic 2-ethylhexyl groups), 7.83 (s, 2H, benzothiadiazole), 7.21, 7.20 (d, 2H, J = 5.0 Hz, 6-cyclopentadithiophene), 6.99 (m, 2H, 5-cyclopentadithiophene), 1.98 (m, 8H, CH2), 1.27 (m, 4H, CH), 1.03–0.84 (m, 32H, CH2), 0.76 (t, J = 10.0 Hz, 12H, CH3), 0.64 (t, J = 10.0 Hz, 12H, CH3). 13C{1H} NMR spectrum (125 MHz, CDCl3): δ 158.6, 158.3, 152.6, 139.1, 138.7, 137.0, 126.1, 125.3 (CH), 124.2 (CH), 122.7 (CH), 122.4 (CH), 53.7 (4-cyclopentadihiophene), 43.3 (CH2), 35.2 (CH), 34.2, 28.7, 27.4, and 22.8 (CH2), 14.1 and 10.7 (CH3).

Anhydrous FeCl3 (0.076 g, 0.470 mmol) was slowly added to a solution of oligomer 1 (0.200 g, 0.213 mmol) in 5 mL of chlorobenzene under nitrogen gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 3 days. After polymerisation, the reaction mixture was precipitated into methanol containing 5% hydrazine hydrate. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed by an excess amount of methanol. It was then collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and dried in vacuum to yield a dark green powder (0.180 g, 90% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.09 (broad, 3-cyclopentadithiophene), 7.86 (broad, benzothiadiazole), 2.00–1.26 (broad, 44H, CH and CH2), 1.03 (broad, 12H, CH3), 0.69 (broad, 12H, CH3).
