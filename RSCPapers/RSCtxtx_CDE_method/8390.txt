Perovskite solar cell performance is critically dependent on the characteristics of the electron transporting layer (ETL) and its interface. This work demonstrates the importance of interface modification in which the charge transport kinetics is improved through band gap engineering of the interfaces in perovskite solar cells with La2O3. The surface of a mesoporous TiO2 ETL (mp-TiO2) on CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells is modified using a simple dip-coating method involving a lanthanum salt solution. The layer thickness of La2O3 was optimized, and its effects on the conduction band position, interfacial charge recombination, and photovoltaic performance were investigated. Modifying the mp-TiO2 ETL with La2O3 resulted in a nearly 46% enhancement of the power conversion efficiency because of the energetically favourable band gap engineering, which allowed the fast transfer of photo-generated electrons from the perovskite absorber layer to the ETL. Our simple interfacial control approach uses a new efficient interface-modifying material, demonstrating that interface engineering could be a key strategy for improving the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Over the past few years, perovskite solar cells have received tremendous attention from the scientific community and have also been of commercial interest. Recent studies reveal that the perovskite absorber layer exhibits several desirable properties for photovoltaic applications, including a moderate direct band gap (1.3–2.3 eV), a broad light absorption range (350–1100 nm), a longer charge carrier diffusion length (>100 nm), and ambipolar charge transport properties. In typical perovskite solar cells, when sunlight irradiates the perovskite absorber layer, excitons (electron–hole pairs) are generated; the resulting electrons are subsequently injected into the electron transporting layer (ETL) as a result of the built-in electrical field over the energy band level, and the holes are transported into the hole transporting layer (HTL). In principle, the charge extraction is closely related to the kinetic selectivity depending upon the difference between the energy band levels of the ETL and the perovskite absorber layer. In this regard, controlling the energy band position over the interface, i.e., between the ETL and absorber layer, is essential. Misaligned energy band positions can induce interfacial energy barriers that will cause undesirable charge accumulation/recombination at the ETL/perovskite interfaces, deteriorating the device performance.

To alleviate these interfacial energy barriers, various methods such as metal doping and interface modification have been developed to mitigate the charge recombination losses and to thereby achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in perovskite solar cells. In particular, placing a thin layered material on ETLs seems to be an effective tool to tune the electrical, chemical, and mechanical interactions with the perovskite absorber layer. Moreover, the interface layer can modify the energy band gap position/work function because the presence of an electrostatic dipole moment near the metal surface induces surface polarization, which affects electron–hole injection, charge transport, and recombination. The strengthened electrostatic potential can promote exciton dissociation and increase the charge extraction efficiency across the interface, resulting in an enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). With these considerations, the effect of interface modification on electron transport and recombination kinetics in perovskite solar cells should be carefully emphasized.
Recently, Ryu et al. systematically studied the modification of the interface of the perovskite absorber with organic materials such as tri-arylamine polymer derivatives containing fluorene and indenofluorene having different highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, suggesting that an energetically well-controlled band position assists in maximizing the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Schlichthörl et al. reported that 4-tert-butylpyridine/ammonia treatments affect the charge recombination kinetics and band edge movement in nanocrystalline TiO2. Snaith and co-workers also demonstrated that the presence of a CsBr interfacial modifier between the TiO2 and the perovskite layer enhances the stability of ultraviolet (UV) light soaking. Therefore, careful engineering of the interface is needed to minimize electron losses and to provide a correctly matching energy band level.
In liquid, quasi-solid and solid-state TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells, several wide-band-gap metal oxide materials, such as ZrO2, In2O3, and Nb2O5, have proven their effectiveness in reducing charge recombination and increasing the PCE. However, to the best of our knowledge, controlling the interface engineering between the ETL and perovskite absorber using a wide-band-gap metal oxide has rarely been investigated in TiO2-based perovskite solar cells. Han et al. reported the significance of a thin MgO coating layer on mp-TiO2 to block the charge recombination at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface in perovskite-type solar cells. Marin-Beloqui et al. also reported that interfacial modification of mp-TiO2 with Al2O3, which acts as a physical barrier at the mp-TiO2/perovskite interface, decreases the rate of back electron transfer after photo-induced electrons inject from the perovskite into the conduction band of TiO2. Surveying the literature suggests that La2O3 is a good candidate for interfacial modification because of its wide band gap and high basicity. These properties of La2O3 can induce a shift in the energy band levels and the flat band potential, leading to the formation of closely matching energy states at the interface and thereby reducing the energy barrier for electron injection/transport at mp-TiO2-La2O3/perovskite interfaces.
In this article, we introduce a new interface-modifying material onto mesoporous (mp)-TiO2 in perovskite solar cells. Simple dip coating into a La precursor solution enables the deposition of a thin layer of La2O3, conformally covering the mp-TiO2 surfaces. The La2O3 interface modification layer not only results in better electron transport properties by reducing the charge carrier losses but also alleviates the interface recombination by perfectly matching the energy levels, resulting in an ∼46% enhancement in the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell. The PCE using the mp-TiO2 decorated with a La2O3 (mp-TiO2-La2O3) ETL-based device (15.81%) significantly outperformed that of its unmodified mp-TiO2-based counterpart (11.10%). Our findings propose the possibility of a new class of wide-band-gap materials as an efficient interfacial modifier applicable to mp-TiO2 to further improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells.

TiO2 paste was purchased from Dyesol (18NR-T, average particle size ∼20 nm) and diluted with anhydrous ethanol (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) before use. All the other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used in the as-received condition, including lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate (99.9%), 2-propanol (99.7%), hydrochloric acid (37%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, Dyesol), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), N-N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (99.8%). In addition, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was obtained from Borun Chemical (98%, Ningbo, China).


The devices were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (TEC15, Pilkington, 15 ohm sq.−1). Initially, the FTO was patterned by laser etching (μ-LAB, Advanced Laser Technology) to define the regions where the anode contact was made. The substrates were then cleaned sequentially with detergent, acetone, ethyl alcohol, and deionized water (Milli-Q water; 18.2 MΩ cm) in an ultrasonic bath. Finally, UV irradiation removed organic residues on the FTO glass substrates. A hole blocking layer of compact TiO2 (C-TiO2) was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s using an organic sol of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) followed by sintering in a furnace at 500 °C for 30 min. Moreover, the mp-TiO2 layer was also deposited onto the C-TiO2 using spin coating. A colloidal solution containing 1.2 g of TiO2 paste diluted with 10 ml of anhydrous 1-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s before being annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in a box furnace.


The La2O3 interface modification layer was deposited on mp-TiO2 using dip coating. First, 0.54 mg lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in a 2-propanol solution and allowed to deposit on the mp-TiO2 surface with dipping times of 30 s, 1 min, and 3 min. During the dip coating process, a chemisorption reaction occurs by reacting with the TiO2 surface hydroxyl groups, which leads to the formation of a thin La2O3 layer on the TiO2 surface. The annealing was performed at 450 °C for 30 min.


To prepare a MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct solution, 461 mg PbI2, 159 mg MAI, and 78 mg DMSO (molar ratio 1:1:1) were mixed in 600 mg of DMF solution at room temperature under stirring for 1 h. The completely dissolved solution was spin coated on the ETL at 4000 rpm for 25 s, and 0.5 ml of diethyl ether was slowly dripped on the rotating substrate for over 10 s before the surface became turbid because of the rapid vaporization of DMF. The transparent MAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct film was heated at 100 °C for 2 min to obtain a dense CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer. A volume of 60 μl of spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The solution was prepared by dissolving 72 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.6 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml of acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) were added. Finally, 70 nm of gold was deposited at ∼10−6 bar via thermal evaporation on the spiro-OMeTAD-coated film.


Plane-view and cross-sectional images of CH3NH3PbI3 coated on two different ETLs (mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 nanostructures) were analysed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7001F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and a focused ion beam (FIB) cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, Titan 80-300, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). The phase structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 film coated on the ETLs was confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation of λ = 0.1542 nm (Rigaku Miniflex 600, The Woodlands, TX, USA). The optical properties of the two ETLs were measured at room temperature using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (V-530, Jasco, Oklahoma City, OK, USA). The photovoltaic performance in terms of current–voltage (J–V) characteristics was determined using a solar simulator (Sol3A Class AAA, Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT, USA) and a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) under air mass (AM) 1.5 and 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) conditions. The 1 sun light intensity level was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell certified by the Newport Corporation. All the devices were measured in a light-tight sample holder, with an active area of 0.06 cm2 for each cell, fixed using an aperture mask. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurements, Inc.) as a function of wavelength from 300 to 850 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were also obtained using a potentiostat (SI 1287, Solartron) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, applying the Voc derived from the J–V test and under dark conditions.

To construct Mott–Schottky plots, both mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs were attached to Cu wires with conductive Ag paste, and the unnecessary parts of the electrode were then covered with epoxy resin. The Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted in a typical three-electrode configuration in which a Ag/AgCl electrode (in saturated KCl) was used as the reference electrode and Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode in a 0.5 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (this solution was adjusted to pH 10 with the addition of NaOH). The Mott–Schottky analysis was performed under dark conditions at a frequency of 5 kHz using a potentiostat (SI 1287, Solartron). The photoelectrochemical properties using these sample configurations under 1 sun light illumination were also measured. The potential was expressed with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at pH = 10. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL spectroscopies of CH3NH3PbI3 coated on both the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs were also performed using micro photoluminescence measurement systems (IK350IR-G with 325 nm He Cd laser and MicroTime-200 with a single-mode pulsed diode laser of 470 nm, PicoQuant, Germany). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analyses for both mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 were performed using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe (Ulvac-PHI) under a background pressure of 2.0 × 10−7 Pa.

The FE-SEM images in Fig. 1a reveal interconnected mp-TiO2 nanoparticles ∼20 nm in diameter; this nanoparticulate morphology was mostly maintained after dip coating with the La2O3 layer (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c and d present plane-view images of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layers coated on both the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs. Irregular-shaped CH3NH3PbI3 crystals are observed on the mp-TiO2 ETL with small pinholes (highlighted with yellow circles), whereas CH3NH3PbI3 crystals formed on the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL with densely packed smooth grains and pinhole-free full coverage. Fig. 1e and f present cross-sectional views of the CH3NH3PbI3 coated on both ETLs, wherein the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layers on the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs are relatively uniform, with thicknesses of ∼332 and ∼338 nm, respectively. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum in Fig. S1 reveals that the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL consists of Ti, O, and La. The existence of La and O peaks supports the formation of a thin La2O3 layer on the surface of the mp-TiO2. The absence of peaks corresponding to impurities is indicative of the formation of a phase-pure defect-free mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL. Fig. S2(a) presents a focused ion beam (FIB) cross-sectioned HR-TEM image, confirming the presence of La2O3 on the surface of the mp-TiO2. The lattice fringes in the HR-TEM image indicate the crystalline nature of the La2O3. The lattice fringe spacing of 3.52 Å shown in the inset of Fig. S2(b) corresponds to the d-spacing of the (101) crystallographic plane of mp-TiO2, whereas the 3.09 Å lattice fringe spacing matches the d-spacing of the (011) plane of La2O3 (inset, Fig. S2(b)). Fig. S2(c) shows the cross-sectional details of FTO/C-TiO2/mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs. The EDX analyses of areas 1 and 2 in this image clearly prove the presence of La on the TiO2 surfaces, while there is no La on the FTO substrate (area 3).

Fig. S3 presents the XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 layers deposited on two different mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs. The reflection peaks at 2θ = 14.33°, 23.80°, 24.69°, 28.80°, 32.01°, and 50.64° are assigned to the (110), (211), (202), (220), (310), and (404) planes, respectively, confirming the formation of a perovskite tetragonal structure. The presence of the high-intensity diffraction peak at 2θ = 14.33° implies the preferred crystal growth of the (110) plane, which is consistent with a previous report.

UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained for the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layers deposited on both ETLs (i.e., mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3) (Fig. 2a). The CH3NH3PbI3 layers on both ETLs demonstrate wide absorbance in the visible region (centered at ∼750 nm). The absorption band edge for both samples is almost the same, indicating that the total amount of perovskite loaded in each case is nearly identical. This finding correlates well with the cross-sectional FE-SEM images in Fig. 1e and f. Comparing the J–V measurements for the perovskite solar cell with the La2O3 interface modification confirms the significant enhancement of the photovoltaic parameters compared with those of the mp-TiO2 ETL-based cell (Fig. 2b and Table 1). The photovoltaic device with the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL exhibits a notable increase in Jsc from 18.73 to 20.84 mA cm−2, Voc from 0.90 to 1.01 V, and FF from 65.73% to 74.64%. The mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL-based device exhibits improvements of over 46% in the PCE compared with the mp-TiO2 ETL-based device, i.e., 15.81% vs. 11.10%. To optimize the layer thickness of La2O3, the cell performance of the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL-based devices for various dip coating times (30 s, 1 min, and 3 min) was also investigated (Fig. S4 and Table S1). For the 30 s dipping time, the device exhibited a poor PCE of 12.53%, which may be due to the low coverage/extremely thin La2O3 layers. The 3 min La2O3 dip coating time led to a slightly improved PCE performance of ∼14.55%, and the best performance (PCE = 15.81%) was observed for the 1 min La2O3 dipping time. This finding indicates that dip coating for 3 min likely results in a relatively thick La2O3 insulating layer that prevents excited electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 layer into the mp-TiO2 ETL. For further device characterization, a 1 min dip coating time was used for La2O3 interface modification.

Dark current analysis can be used to measure a conduction band shift or to determine the existence of an energy barrier at the ETL surface. The dark current of the mp-TiO2 ETL-based device was observed at a low forward bias (Fig. 2c), implying that charge recombination is facilitated at the mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface. After La2O3 interfacial modification, the dark current was shifted to a higher forward bias direction, which may be due to the suppressed back flow of electrons, i.e., electron recombination from mp-TiO2 to the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, which is in good agreement with the higher Voc of the modified device. To further verify the cell performance, EQE spectra were obtained and are presented in Fig. 2d. The mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL-based device exhibited a higher EQE value at 520 nm (∼80.1%) compared with its mp-TiO2 ETL-based counterpart (∼73.6%). The enhancement in the EQE after interface modification implies efficient photon-to-current conversion in the modified ETL device, which is consistent with the increased Jsc value.

To verify the energy level alignment and understand the enhancement of Voc upon La2O3 interface modification, UPS measurements were performed, and the results are presented in Fig. 3a and b. The high binding energy cut-off (Ecut-off) values of the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs were determined to be 8.43 and 8.52 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy onset values, called the binding energy onset (Eonset) values, relative to the Fermi level of Au (at 0 eV), were also evaluated to be −5.26 and −5.02 eV for the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs, respectively. Then, the valence band minimum (VBM) energy levels were calculated using eqn (1):

VBM = hν − (Ecut-off − Eonset),
(1)
where
h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency of vibration of light. This simple calculation was used to determine the corresponding VBM energy levels, i.e., −7.52 eV for mp-TiO2 and −7.67 eV for mp-TiO2-La2O3. The optical band gap energies (Eg) of the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs were estimated using eqn (2):

(αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg),
(2)
where
A is the proportional constant and α is the absorption coefficient. Fig. S5 presents UV-vis spectra for only mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs, in which the Eg values were obtained by extrapolating the linear portions of the curves near the onset of the absorption edge to the energy axis (inset of Fig. S5). The Eg values were determined to be 3.46 and 3.38 eV for the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs, respectively. The Eg of the mp-TiO2 ETL matches the reported value. Several factors affect the Eg value of binary/layered metal oxides, including the thickness, doping level, and interstitial oxygen vacancies. It has been suggested that additional oxygen vacancies can be generated when different valence states of La and Ti are formed. In our case, the decreased Eg energy after La2O3 interface modification might be due to the formation of a thin layer with different optical properties on the mp-TiO2 surface.

Using the optical band gap, the conduction band minimum (CBM) energy levels were also evaluated using eqn (3):
CBM = VBM + Eg,
(3)
the calculated CBM levels for mp-TiO
2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 were −4.06 and −4.29 eV, respectively (Table 2). To obtain a clear understanding of the electron transfer pathway through the ETLs, an energy band diagram of the FTO/ETLs/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD was drawn based on their appropriate band levels.Fig. 4 demonstrates that both the CBM and VBM positions are shifted in a downward direction after the La2O3 interface modification with respect to the unmodified mp-TiO2. This downward shifting in the CBM position corresponds well with the perovskite energy band level, which facilitates the suppression of recombination at the interface during electron transfer, as similarly observed by Chun et al., who demonstrated that phosphotungstic acid treatment of TiO2 caused the CBM position to shift downward, thereby accelerating electron transfer and retarding recombination. Notably, La2O3 interface modification allows for downward shifting the VBM position with respect to the unmodified mp-TiO2 (i.e., −7.67 to −7.52 eV). This downward shifting in the VBM position might affect the enhancement of both the Jsc (from 18.73 to 20.84 mA cm−2) and the FF (from 65.73% to 74.64%) according to a recent study by Wang et al. in which Mg-doped TiO2 resulted in shifting the VBM position downward, leading to hole blocking and less recombination at the interface.

EIS is a simple but useful method to investigate the charge recombination resistance and interfacial properties of perovskite solar cells. Fig. 5 presents Nyquist plots for the device conducted under 1 sun illumination at an applied bias voltage of 0.2 V, revealing two distinct semicircles (one in the high-frequency range and another in the low-frequency range) measured over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The Nyquist plot was fitted using an equivalent circuit model, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5, and the curve fitting data of both the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL-based devices are summarized in Table 3.

The series resistance (Rs) is related to the wiring and FTO substrate measured in the high-frequency region. R1 is the interface resistance of the counter electrode, and CPE1 is its capacitance. In the Nyquist plots, the main arc is responsible for the ETLs/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces as expressed by a combination of the interface recombination resistance (R2) and the chemical capacitance (CPE2). After La2O3 interface modification, R2 increased from 313.5 to 521.2 Ω cm2. The increased R2 (inversely related to the interface recombination rate) indicates the retardation of electron back flow from the mp-TiO2 CB to spiro-OMeTAD. This result is consistent with the observation of dark J–V curves. The determination of R2 as a function of bias potentials provides additional support for less interface charge recombination when the interface is modified with La2O3, as shown in Fig. S6.

The flat band (FB) potential of the ETL can be measured by evaluating the intercept of the linear extrapolation in the Mott–Schottky plots, as shown in Fig. 6a. The FB potential provides information about Voc. The FB potential values of the mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs were determined to be −0.75 V and −0.90 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. A negative shift in the FB potential was observed after La2O3 interface modification on the mp-TiO2 surface, which explains the Voc increase (from 0.90 to 1.01 V) observed in Fig. 2b. The negative shift in the FB potential upon La2O3 modification can be understood in terms of the acidity and basicity of metal oxides. The mp-TiO2 is acidic because its isoelectric point is ∼5.8, whereas La2O3 is basic with an isoelectric point of ∼10. The photoelectrochemical measurements enable us to understand the role of La2O3 modification in ETLs. The mp-TiO2 electrode generated an anodic photocurrent under illumination, as observed in Fig. S7a and b, which is indicative of the n-type semiconducting properties of the TiO2 layer. The onset potential of mp-TiO2 was determined to be +0.84 V vs. RHE, as defined by the x-axis intercept of the photocurrent. After La2O3 interface modification, a negative shift in the onset potential and increased photocurrent were observed at +0.42 V for the mp-TiO2-La2O3 electrode. The photoelectrochemical results clearly suggest that the La2O3-modified mp-TiO2 ETL is responsible for the negative shift in the onset potential, which possibly originates from the band bending, resulting in fast charge transfer, as expressed by the increased photocurrent. The negative shift in the onset potential for the La2O3-modified mp-TiO2 is also in good agreement with the Mott–Schottky measurement. The negative shifts in both the onset and FB potentials when the interface was modified with La2O3 contribute to the improved Voc and enhanced device performance.

The PL measurements also reveal the photo-induced charge transfer and charge recombination loss. Fig. 6b presents the PL spectra of the glass/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and glass/mp-TiO2-La2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 films. The PL intensity of the glass/mp-TiO2-La2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film is reduced compared with that of the glass/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film, indicating that the charge transfer effectively occurred before the carrier recombination at the interface and eventually improved the electron extraction rate from the perovskite absorber layer. The decrease in the PL intensity also supported the enhancement in PCE for the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL-based device compared with that of its mp-TiO2 ETL-based counterpart.
To further understand the charge transfer at the interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 and ETL layers, time-resolved PL decay measurements were carried out. Both mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and mp-TiO2-La2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on glass substrates were measured. The time-resolved PL lifetime was fitted with a bi-exponential decay function containing a fast decay and a slow decay process. The lifetime of the fast decay process was used to identify the quenching effect of free carriers in the perovskite grains through transport to the ETL interface, whereas the slow decay process represents the results of radiative decay. Fig. S8 displays the time-resolved PL decay in which the fast decay lifetime was 4.79 ns for the CH3NH3PbI3 coated mp-TiO2 film. This fast decay lifetime is significantly reduced to 3.74 ns after La2O3 interface modification on mp-TiO2, indicating that charge transfer between the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL is improved owing to the surface modification.

The hysteresis behaviour of the La2O3-interface-modified mp-TiO2 ETL device was also investigated. The photocurrent hysteresis behaviour, mainly originating from the defect-assisted traps in the perovskite grains and ionic migration in the electric field, can be another critical issue in perovskite solar cells. The hysteresis behaviour of both mp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETLs, at different scan rates (a high scan rate of 520 mV s−1 and a low scan rate of 8.5 mV s−1) and different scan directions (reverse scan: black and blue solid symbols; forward scan: black and blue open symbols) was confirmed, and the results are presented in Fig. S9a–f and Table S2. Slight hysteresis was observed at a slow scan rate, where PCE = 15.81% for the reverse scan and 14.38% for the forward scan (Fig. S9f). The reduced hysteresis behaviour is attributed to the enhanced charge transfer at the mp-TiO2/perovskite interface via La2O3 interface modification. The stabilized power output under applied bias at the maximum power point is indeed a significant parameter reflecting the reliable performance of the solar cell. To corroborate the J–V curves, we determined the stabilized power output close to the maximum power point (0.83 V), which reflects the true sustainable PCE of the perovskite solar cells. The interface-modified mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL devices exhibited a significantly higher PCE, reaching 14.9% (Fig. S10). To verify the reproducibility of the CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, 20 devices were fabricated under each ETL condition. Fig. 7a–d present the average values of the photovoltaic device parameters. The mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL-based devices exhibited fairly high reproducibility for Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE with relatively smaller standard deviations of 0.68%, which is dramatically lower than those of the mp-TiO2-based cell (1.82%). The photovoltaic performance enhancement (∼46%) obtained in this study is much better than other interface modifications reported in the literature (see Table S3). This underlines the importance of a new class of wide-band-gap materials as an efficient interfacial modifier applicable to mp-TiO2. Our results suggest that interface engineering using La2O3 is an effective and reliable approach to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.


In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that wide-band-gap La2O3 can be effectively employed as an interface modifier between the mp-TiO2 and perovskite absorber layer, resulting in highly efficient perovskite solar cells. A simple dip-coated La2O3 interface modification on mp-TiO2 resulted in a downward shift in the conduction band energy level, the suppression of interfacial charge recombination, and improvement in the electron transfer rate in perovskite solar cells. A remarkable enhancement in the PCE of the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL (15.81%) with good reproducibility was also achieved compared with its unmodified mp-TiO2-based counterpart (11.18%). Additionally, EIS and dark current analyses revealed that the mp-TiO2-La2O3 ETL has decreased charge recombination, which significantly contributed to the improvement of the Voc. Furthermore, Mott–Schottky analysis confirmed a negative shift in the flat band potential after La2O3 interface modification, thus favouring fast and easy electron transfer from highly mobile CH3NH3PbI3 to the conduction band of mp-TiO2. Our findings demonstrate that the employment of La2O3 interface modification is a promising approach to tune Eg and to thereby reduce interface charge recombination in perovskite solar cells.
