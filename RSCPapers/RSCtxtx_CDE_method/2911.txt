n-Type polymer electron acceptors have attracted significant attention due to their advantages such as adjustable energy levels and bandgaps, high absorption coefficients and excellent electrical and photovoltaic properties. Thus, designing and synthesizing high-performance n-type polymer electron acceptors have become one of the mainstream research topics of organic solar cells (OSCs). Due to the rapid development of n-type polymer electron acceptors, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of related OSCs have increased to 15–17% in the last few years. Intense investigations on molecular structure tailoring and new n-type polymer electron acceptors have been reported. These developed n-type polymer electron acceptors play a vital role in improving the photovoltaic performance. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the innovation of n-type polymer electron acceptors and structure–property relationships and the compatibility of donors and acceptors as well as the guidelines for future structure designs, morphology control and direction for the development of n-type polymer electron acceptors.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are emerging as alternative photovoltaic technology to utilize solar energy due to their advantages of low cost, flexibility, lightweight, and solution processability. Fullerenes and their derivatives have been used as electron acceptors in the past years, but the shortcomings of fullerenes and their derivatives limit the further improvement in the photovoltaic performance. n-Type polymer electron acceptors have been developed due to their adjustable energy level, modifiable molecular structure and regulated blend film morphology, which has triggered a research upsurge in the field of OSCs. Thus, the recent advances in the innovation of n-type polymer electron acceptors are summarized in this review.


With the rapid development of society and the continuous increase in population, the global demand for energy is increasing annually, and finding clean, green and renewable energy has become one of the urgent problems to be solved for the sustainable development of mankind. Solar energy has the advantages of being inexhaustible, non-polluting and renewable, and it is considered to be one of the best ways for mankind to obtain clean energy. Devices that convert solar energy into electrical energy are called solar cells, which can be divided into inorganic solar cells and organic solar cells (OSCs). OSCs have attracted considerable interest from both the industrial and academic communities due to their advantages such as compatibility with flexible substrates, potentially low-cost manufacturing and easy processability over a large area via roll-to-roll or printing technologies. They have quickly become a research hotspot and achieved rapid development. After decades of development, the performance of OSCs has greatly improved, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 19%.

According to the type of electron acceptor materials in the active layer of OSCs, they can be divided into fullerene OSCs and non-fullerene OSCs. Fullerene OSCs employ small molecules or polymers with hole transport properties as electron donors and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or other fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors. Fullerene OSCs have been extensively researched during the first 20 years of the development of OSCs due to the excellent charge transport properties, high electron affinity and the easy-to-control phase separation morphology of fullerene. Although fullerenes and their derivatives have promoted the development of OSCs, their inherent shortcomings, such as fixed energy levels, difficult synthesis and purification and weak light absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, limit further improvement in the device performance.
It is known that acceptors having complementary absorption spectra and matching energy levels with donors are beneficial to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the related photovoltaic devices, and thus it is necessary to develop acceptors with complementary absorption spectra and matching energy levels with the donors. Therefore, non-fullerene OSCs have received increasing attention. Non-fullerene acceptors can be divided into polymeric acceptor materials and small-molecule acceptor materials, and in this review, we focus on polymeric acceptor materials.
The first OSCs using n-type conjugated polymers as acceptors were reported in 1995. Heeger et al. used a nitrile-substituted PPV derivative CN-PPV as the polymer acceptor and p-type conjugated polymer MEH-PPV as the donor to prepare OSCs, and a PCE of 0.25% was obtained. In addition to CV-PPV, early polymer acceptors for OSCs include fluorene and benzothiadiazole-based polymers such as F8TBT and PFI2TBT, but the electron mobility of these polymer acceptors was much lower than that of fullerene acceptors. Therefore, the transport of holes and electrons in the active layer of OSCs based on these acceptors and polymer donors was unbalanced, resulting in devices with severe charge recombination and relatively low fill factor (FF). In addition, the morphology formed by the two polymers was difficult to control, resulting in the poor morphology of the blend film, which limited the further development of OSCs.
To further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs based on polymer acceptors, researchers have continued to develop polymer acceptors with high mobility. Polymer acceptors have the advantages of easy modification of their chemical structure, adjustable energy level, adjustable spectrum, and stable morphology. Based on these advantages, OSCs based on polymer acceptors have developed rapidly in recent years, and consequently have become a new research hotspot.
OSCs based on polymer acceptors can be divided into two types, i.e., all-polymer OSCs (all-POSCs) and small-molecule donor/polymer-acceptor OSCs (MD/PA OSCs) (Fig. 1). Thus far, all-POSCs and MD/PA OSCs have achieved a PCE of over 17% and 9%, respectively. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent research progress of all-POSCs and MD/PA OSCs. Focusing on the development of polymer acceptors, the recent advances of all-POSCs and MD/PA OSCs are introduced from the perspectives of molecular structure and photovoltaic properties. Finally, we look forward to the future development direction and prospects of OSCs based on polymer acceptors.

OSCs with an active layer is composed of a polymer donor and polymer acceptor are called all-POSCs. Due to the mutual entanglement of polymer chains, all-POSCs generally have excellent morphological stability, mechanical stability and thermal stability, which have broad application prospects in flexible devices. Compared with the wide variety of polymer donors, there are fewer polymer acceptor materials, thus limiting the performance improvement of all-POSCs. Due to the recent emergence of new polymer acceptors, the performance of all-POSCs has been rapidly improved, achieving PCEs higher than 17%. Here, we focus on the development of polymer acceptors in all-POSCs. The molecular design strategy of polymer acceptors usually involves the use of strong electron-deficient units, such as naphthalene diimide (NDI), perylene diimide (PDI), bithiophene imide (BTI), boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B ← N) unit, dicyano-benzothiadiazole (DCNBT) and polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs), which will be briefly introduced below.


n-Type polymer acceptors should have low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, and therefore diimide structures with strong electron-deficient properties are often used in the molecular design of polymer acceptor materials. NDI is a strong electron-deficient unit with a large π planar backbone, where NDI-based polymers have been widely investigated due to their high electron affinity, electron mobility, and broad optical absorption.

Watson et al. first reported donor–acceptor conjugated polymers based on NDI. N2200 (Fig. 2a) reported by Yan et al. in 2009 is one of the most widely used polymer acceptors in all-POSCs. The polymer acceptor N2200 was obtained by the copolymerization of an NDI unit and bithiophene unit, which has a narrow optical bandgap (Eg = 1.45 eV), high electron affinity (LUMO < −4.0 eV) and excellent electron mobility.
Huang et al. fabricated all-POSCs with N2200 as the acceptor and p-type wide bandgap polymer PTzBI (Fig. 3e) as the donor, which are made up of imide-functionalized benzotriazole units and benzodithiophene (BDT). They systematically investigated the synergistic effects of the molecular weight of N2200 and processing solvents on the photovoltaic performance of all-POSCs. Their results showed that exciton generation and dissociation can be enhanced with an increase in the molecular weight of N2200, consequently facilitating the charge extraction. A high PCE of 9.16% was realized by an all-POSC consisting of PTzBI and high molecular weight N2200 (75.1 kg mol−1) processed with 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), which is a greener alternative to THF. They developed a novel wide-bandgap conjugated copolymer named PTzBI-Si (Fig. 3g), which has the same backbone with PTzBI but a siloxane-terminated side-chain benzotriazole. The all-POSCs based on PTzBI-Si:N2200 afforded a PCE of 10.1%. Liu et al. further improved the PCE to 11.76% by slot die printing. A novel wide-bandgap electron-donating copolymer named PBTA-Si (Fig. 3h) with a siloxane-terminated side chain was developed by Huang and co-workers. The ternary All-POSC with PBTA-Si:PTzBI-Si:N2200 (1:1:1) as the active layer obtained a PCE of 9.56%. The binary all-POSC with PTzBI-Si:N2200 (2:1) as the active layer achieved a high PCE of 11.0% by manipulating the bulk heterojunction structure (BHJ) morphology using a green solvent system based on cyclopentyl methyl ether. They also investigated the effects of the molecular weight of PTzBI-Si on the photovoltaic performance of all-POSCs. The all-POSCs based on high molecular weight (58.2 kg mol−1) of PTzBI-Si exhibited a higher PCE of 11.5% with improved stability. Huang et al. modified the molecular geometry of N2200 by incorporating a truxene unit as the core and NDI-DT as the branches, and obtained two starburst NDI derivatives P3F-0.5 and P3F-2 (Fig. 2g). They exhibited comparable absorption spectra and the molecular orbital energy levels of N2200. All-POSCs based on PTzBI-O:P3F-2 yielded a PCE of 8.00% after device optimization. Our group designed and synthesized three middle band-gap polymer donors with a thiazole moiety as the π bridge and different alkyl side chains (PTBTz-2, PTBTz-3, and PTBTz-4, Fig. 3k). We systemically investigated the influence of a branched alkyl side chain (PTBTz-2), linear alkyl side chain (PTBTz-3) and alkylthio side chain (PTBTz-4) on polymer–polymer miscibility and the resulting photovoltaic performance. The results showed that the photovoltaic performance is sensitive to the solubility of the polymer and the miscibility of the polymer–polymer pair. Among the three polymers, the 2-ethylhexyl-modified PTBTz-2 had best solubility and the most approximate lamellar aggregation size (2.51 nm) with that of N2200 (2.49 nm). Consequently, the PTBTz-2:N2200-based all-POSC yielded the highest PCE of 6.42%.
The NDI-based polymer N2200 is a promising polymer acceptor for all-POSCs. Researchers have developed numerous acceptor materials based on NDI by adjusting the conjugated main chain, flexible side chains and ternary random copolymerization.
Kim et al. designed and synthesized two new polymer acceptors (PNDITCVT-HD and PNDITCVT-OD, Fig. 2e) by incorporating electron-withdrawing cyanovinylene groups into the backbone of N2200. Benefitting from its efficient exciton dissociation and well-balanced charge transport, the all-POSCs fabricated from PBDTTTPD (Fig. 3c) and PNDITCVT-HD or PNDITCVT-OD exhibited a PCE of 6.5–7.4%. To investigate the effect of branching point of the side-chain of NDI-based conjugated polymers, Kim and co-workers incorporated four different side-chains (2-hexyloctyl, 3-hexylnonyl, and 4-hexyldecyl, 5-hexylundecyl) in NDI-based conjugated polymers (P(NDI1-T), P(NDI2-T), P(NDI3-T), and P(NDI4-T), respectively), and their structures are showed in Fig. 2b. Their results showed that the intermolecular interactions become stronger as the branching point is located farther away from the conjugated backbones. When these polymers were applied in all-POSCs as electron acceptors, PCEs of 6.1–7.1% were achieved. Huang et al. introduced linear oligoethylene oxide (OE) side chains to replace the branched alkyl chains on the NDI units and obtained a series of NDI-based polymer acceptors NOEx (Fig. 2h). Compared to N2200, the OE-chain-containing polymer NOE10 offered a higher PCE of 8.1% with PBDT-TAZ (Fig. 3n) as the donor polymer. Moreover, the NOE10-based all-POSCs showed an excellent storage life and thermal stability with a retention of >97% of the initial PCE after 300 h of aging at 65 °C. Based on this work, they incorporated PTB7-Th (Fig. 3q) in the binary PBDT-TAZ:NOE10 system to fabricate ternary all-POSCs, achieving a PCE of 8.5% in a broad ternary polymer ratio. We designed and synthesized a new polymer acceptor named PNDIOD-30Se (Fig. 2f) based on N2200 by partially replacing thiophene with selenophene. The asymmetric PTBD-BZ (Fig. 3i) not only improved the morphology of the active layer by creating an ordered microstructure, but also improved the charge transfer efficiency. PNDIOD-30Se was blended with the asymmetric PTBD-BZ as the active layer to construct all-POSCs, and obtained a PCE of 6.42%. Jenekhe and co-workers synthesized a series of NDI-selenophene/PDI-selenophene random copolymers (10PDI, 30PDI, and 50PDI, Fig. 2c) and investigated their performance as polymer acceptors in all-POSCs. Bao et al. replaced a certain amount of alkyl side-chains with compact bulky side-chains (CBS) to modulate the self-aggregation of N2200. They synthesized a series of PNDI-CBSx with different molar fractions of the CBS units, and their results showed that the solid-state crystallinity of these acceptors was progressively suppressed with an increase in x. Blending of the more amorphous acceptor PNDI0.5 (Fig. 2d) with the donor polymer PBDB-T (Fig. 3j) increased the PCE of the all-POSCs (8.5%). Chen and co-workers introduced porphyrin unit in an NDI-based polymer and obtained a series of random copolymers, PNDI-Px (Fig. 2i). Compared with N2200, PNDI-Px showed a higher absorption coefficient and raised LUMO. PNDI-Px matched with PBDB-T for application in all-POSCs and PCEs of 5.04–5.93% were obtained. The parameters of the all-POSCs based on NDI-based polymer acceptors are summarized in Table 1.

Although NDI-based polymer acceptors show good photovoltaic performances in all-POSCs, their weak absorption coefficient in the near-infrared region limits the further improvement of the JSC and PCE.

It is known that building electron-deficient units is one of the main strategies for the development of efficient polymer acceptors. PDI is a stronger electron-deficient unit with a larger π planar backbone than that of NDI, making it another widely used imide unit for designing n-type polymer acceptors. Normally, PDI-based polymer acceptors have high electron mobilities and electron affinity. In 2007, Zhan et al. synthesized polymer P1 (Fig. 4a) by Stille coupling of N,N′-dialkyl-1,7-dibromo-3,4,9,10-perylene diimide with a distannyl derivative of dithienothiophene and fabricated all-POSCs with polymer P1 as the acceptor and a bi(thienylenevinylene)-substituted polythiophene (P2, Fig. 3a) as the donor, achieving a PCE of 1.03%.

Given that the PDI unit has a large π plane, it is usually copolymerized with small conjugated units such as ethylene and thiophene to ensure the planarity of the polymer and promote the π–π stacking between molecules, which is beneficial to achieve high photoelectric conversion performance. Hou et al. designed and synthesized the PDI-based polymer acceptor PPDIODT (Fig. 4b) by Stille coupling of 2-octyldodecyl-substituted PDIs with a distannyl derivative of thiophene. By utilizing anisole as the processing solvent, a PCE of 5.43% was obtained in the PBDT-TS1:PPDIODT-based all-POSCs without introducing any additives or post-treatments. Yan et al. designed and synthesized a novel polymer acceptor, PDI-V (Fig. 4c), which consisted of alternating PDI and vinylene units. PDI-V exhibited high electron mobility due to its relatively planar polymer backbone. They fabricated inverted structure all-POSCs based on PTB7-Th:PDI-V and a PCE of 7.57% was achieved without the use of any post-treatment or processing additives. We copolymerized PDI with naphthyl-substituted asymmetric benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene and obtained a novel conjugated polymer acceptor named PBDTβNPDI (Fig. 4d). PBDTβNPDI has broad absorption spectrum and tuned aggregation with the asymmetric donor unit. The PTBTz-2 polymer (Fig. 3k) with a deep large ionization potential, medium bandgap (1.72 eV), high extinction coefficient, and planar molecular configuration was employed as a donor to fabricate all-POSCs. The crystallites and phase separation of PTBTz-2:PBDTβNPDI was fine-tuned by thermal treatment and DIO additive. A PCE of 6.14% was realized after device optimization.
To further improve the π–π stacking packing, researchers fused two adjacent PDIs to improve the planarity, enhance the polymer crystallinity, and then improve the device performance. To reduce the conformational disorder in the backbone of PDI-V, Zhao et al. designed and synthesized a novel polymer acceptor, NDP-V (Fig. 4e), which consisted of alternating naphthodiperylenetetraimide (NDP) and vinylene units. The enhanced electron and hole transport abilities of the active layer (PTB7-Th:NDP-V) proved that the use of NDP could improve the molecular packing behaviors of the acceptor and improve the morphology. With NDP-V as the acceptor, a high PCE of 8.59% was achieved. Zhang et al. reported a novel fused PDI-based polymer electron acceptor, PFPDI-BDF (Fig. 4f), which consisted of alternating fused PDI and benzodifuran (BDF) units. The PCE of 6.05% was obtained in the PTB7-Th:PFPDI-BDF based all-POSCs. Zhong et al. designed and synthesized a novel fused PDI-based polymer acceptor FPDI-BT1 (Fig. 4g). They fabricated all-POSCs based on PBDB-T:FPDI-BT and realized a PCE of 7.15%.
NDI and PDI-based polymer acceptors have been widely used in all-POSCs, but these polymers still have some drawbacks such as weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared light region, strong tendency to aggregate and fixed LUMO energy level. Therefore, designing and developing novel building blocks to construct efficient polymer acceptors are highly urgent to further increase the PCE of all-POSCs. Another imide-functionalized heteroarene, BTI, has been proven to be efficient for constructing n-type polymer acceptors.
Guo et al. designed and synthesized a novel imide-functionalized arene, di(fluorothienyl)thienothiophene diimide (f-FBTI2), and synthesized a high-performance polymer acceptor f-FBTI2-T (Fig. 4i), which consisted of alternating f-FBTI2 and thiophene units. f-FBTI2-T showed a lower-lying LUMO energy level and reduced bandgap than the polymer analog without F functionalization. An excellent PCE of 8.1% was achieved by PTB7-Th:f-FBTI2-T based all-POSCs without any solvent additive or thermal treatment. They introduced thienopyrroledione (TPD) into f-BTI2-FT and obtained a series of terpolymers BTI2-xTPD (Fig. 4j) having a distinct TPD content. Benefitting from the reduced crystallinity of the irregular backbone, the miscibility with the polymer donor PTB7-Th was improved. An excellent PCE of 8.28% was achieved by the PTB7-Th:BTI2-30TPD based all-POSCs with a small energy loss of 0.53 eV. Guo et al. designed and synthesized two triimide-functionalized n-type acceptor polymers, f-BTI3-T and f-BTI3-FT (Fig. 4k), which showed an improved film morphology, reduced bandgap and lower-lying LUMO energy levels than the diimide-functionalized analogue polymers f-BTI2-T and f-BTI2-FT. The authors blended f-BTI3-T with PTB7-Th (Fig. 3q) and an outstanding PCE of 8.98% with high VOC of 1.03 V was obtained. Guo and co-workers synthesized a homopolymer PBTI (Fig. 4h) and copolymer P(BTI-BTI2) (Fig. 4i) from the distannylated electron-deficient BTI monomer (BTI-Tin). PBTI and P(BTI-BTI2) featured with an acceptor–acceptor backbone with high molecular weight. The all-POSCs based on PTB7-Th:PBTI and PTB7-Th:P(BTI-BTI2) achieved a high PCE of 6.67% and 8.61%, respectively. The parameters of the all-POSCs based on PDI and BTI-based polymer acceptors are summarized in Table 2.

Although the PDI- and BTI-based polymer acceptors showed a good photovoltaic performance, they still suffered from several inherent drawbacks including narrow absorption range, deficient absorptivity, and low-lying energy levels.

Owing to the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atom and the vacant p-orbital of the boron atom, B ← N can be formed through the occupation of the vacant p-orbital of the boron atom by the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atom. In the B ← N unit, the nitrogen atom shows cationic character, while the boron atom shows anionic character. When the B ← N unit was embedded in a π-conjugated system, the cationic character of the nitrogen atom increased the static potential of the π-system, thus enhancing the electron-deficient nature of the π-system and leading to a low-lying LUMO energy level. Liu Jun's group introduced B ← N into n-type polymer semiconductors for the first time.

Polymers containing B ← N units are mainly divided into two categories, i.e., A–A type polymer acceptors based on B ← N-bridged thienylthiazole (BNTT) containing one B ← N unit and D–A-type polymer acceptors based on double B ← N-bridged bipyridine (BNBP) containing two B ← N units.
To reduce the energy levels of polymers containing BNTT units, Liu et al. copolymerized BNTT units with electron-deficient units and obtained A–A type polymers. The electron mobility of these A–A type polymers was low. Liu and co-workers adopted a strategy of extending the length of the monomer units to improve the molecular packing and enhance the charge transport ability. The P-BN-IID and rr-PBN polymers were designed and synthesized by copolymerizing BNTT units with isoindigo units (IID) and pyridine-terminated DPP units, respectively. Their structures are shown in Fig. 5(a and b), respectively. The μe of PTB7-Th:P-BN-IID and PffBT4T-2OD:rr-PBN was 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of 5.04% and 6.60% was realized in the all-POSCs, respectively. The all-POSCs based on PD-nF:rr-PBN achieved PCEs of 3.22–6.45%.
In the BNBP unit, due to the co-intercalation of two B ← N units in the bipyridine, it has low HOMO/LUMO energy levels, planar configuration and quinoidal structure. Based on the above-mentioned characteristics of the BNBP unit, by adjusting the unit copolymerized with BNBP, the absorption spectra, energy levels, charge transport ability and solid-state stacking structure of the polymer could be regulated, and a series of polymer acceptors with excellent performance was designed and synthesized.
Liu et al. synthesized two polymer acceptors, P-BNBP-T and P-BNBP-Se (Fig. 5d), via the copolymerization of the BNBP unit with thiophene or selenophene. However, affected by the axisymmetric configuration of thiophene and selenophene, the skeleton structure of P-BNBP-T and P-BNBP-Se was tortuous, which is not conducive to the solid-state packing of the polymers, respectively. Therefore, to obtain linear polymers, Liu et al. copolymerized a rotationally symmetric fluorine-containing bithiophene unit with BNBP and obtained the polymer acceptor P-BNBP-fBT (Fig. 5c) with good planarity. P-BNBP-fBT exhibited good crystallinity and high electron mobility, and the all-POSC based on PTB7-Th:P-BNBP-fBT achieved a PCE of 6.26%. To further improve the crystallinity of polymers, Liu et al. designed and synthesized a series of highly crystalline polymer acceptors with the D–A1–D–A2 configuration, such as PBN-10, PBNBP-4f, PBN-12, PBN-14, P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T, and their structures are shown in Fig. 5. The authors blended them with polymer donors (such as PTB7-Th, CD1, J61, and CD-Cx, Fig. 3q, r, and l) to fabricate all-POSCs and achieved PCEs of 0.20–10.07%. Among them, PBN-12 with benzothiadiazole as the A2 unit and thiophene as the D unit realized high crystallinity, fast charge transport (1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and suitable phase separation morphology. The all-POSCs based on CD1:PBN-12 realized a promising PCE of 10.07%, reflecting the great potential of polymer acceptors containing B ← N units. Liu and co-workers introduced a small amount of BN-T (Fig. 5i) in the PM6:PY-IT blend to fabricate ternary (PM6:PY-IT:BN-T = 1:1:0.1) all-POSCs and achieved a breakthrough PCE of 16.09%. The parameters of the all-POSCs based on the B ← N unit-based polymer acceptors are summarized in Table 3.

Although B ← N unit-based polymer acceptors show good photovoltaic performances, their low electron mobility limits the further improvement of the PCE.

Cyano substituents have strong electron-deficient properties and can effectively reduce the energy levels in π-conjugated systems, and thus they are widely used in the design of n-type semiconductor materials.

DCNBT is one of the few structural units containing CN, which can achieve high PCE. For example, Guo et al. copolymerized the DCNBT unit with IDT and obtained the polymer acceptor DCNBT-IDT (Fig. 5m), which has a narrow band gap (1.42 eV), high absorption coefficient (6.15 × 104 cm−1) and low-lying LUMO level (−3.75 eV). DCNBT-IDT was blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T (Fig. 3j) as the active layer to fabricate all-POSCs and a PCE of 8.32% was achieved. Based on this work, the authors copolymerized DCNBT with two highly electron-rich building blocks, 4,4,10,10-tetraoctyl-4,10-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrano[2,3-g]thieno[3,2-c]chromene (TPC) and 5,5,11,11-tetraoctyl-5,11-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:5,6] pyrano[3,4-g]thieno-[3,2-c]isochromene (TPIC) and obtained two novel polymer acceptors, DCNBT-TPC and DCNBT-TPIC (Fig. 5n and o), respectively. DCNBT-TPC and DCNBT-TPIC have ultra-narrow bandgaps of 1.38 and 1.28 eV, respectively. Upon blending with the polymer donor PBDTTT-E-T (Fig. 3), the resultant all-POSCs based on DCNBT-TPC and DCNBT-TPIC achieved remarkable PCEs of 9.34% and 10.22%, respectively. This was the first example of all-POSCs achieving a PCE higher than 10% using ultra-narrow bandgaps polymer acceptors. To maximize light-harvesting and improve the photovoltaic performance, Guo and co-workers fabricated ternary all-POSCs based on DCNBT-TPC, the medium bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th and wide bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T (Fig. 3j). The optimized ternary all-POSC (PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:DCNBT-TPC = 0.6:0.4:0.8) yielded an excellent PCE of 12.1%. These results demonstrate the great potential of DCNBT in the design of polymer acceptors. The parameters of all-POSCs based on DCNBT-based polymer acceptors are summarized in Table 3.
However, DCNBT-based polymer acceptors have strong aggregation tendency, there are few matching donors, and their morphology is difficult to control, which limit their further applications.

To overcome the intrinsic limitations of electronic energy level regulation and the weak absorption of fullerene acceptors, researchers have designed and synthesised many small-molecule acceptors (SMAs), which are alternatives to fullerene acceptors. Zhan et al. developed A–D–A type SMAs, such as ITIC and IDIC, with the fused ring unit as the central core and the strong electron-deficient unit as the end group. Zou et al. developed high-efficiency A2–D–A1–D–A2-type SMAs, such as Y5 and Y6. These SMAs have a narrow bandgap, strong absorption, and suitable electronic energy levels and could be easily modified through core engineering, side-chain engineering, halogen substitution and symmetry-breaking strategy. With the participation of scientific researchers worldwide, intense investigations have been conducted on the structural tailoring of the molecules and lots of SMAs with new structures and excellent performance have been reported. At present, OSCs based on SMAs can realize a PCE higher than 19%.

In 2017, Li et al. proposed a strategy of PSMAs, which possess the advantages of preserving the merits of SMAs and the good film-forming property, higher morphology, and light-irradiation stability of the polymers. More importantly, numerous SMA building blocks and different conjugated linkage units can be selected to tune the photovoltaic and physicochemical properties of PSMAs. Recently, PSMA n-type polymer acceptors have received increasing attention and significant improvements of PCE of all-POSCs have been realized.

Polymerizing small-molecule acceptors is a valid method for combining the advantages of small-molecule acceptors and polymer acceptors. Li et al. copolymerized the high-efficiency fused-ring small molecule acceptor IDIC with a thiophene unit to obtain the polymer PZ1 (Fig. 6a). They fabricated all-POSCs with PZ1 as the acceptor and wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T as the donor, achieving a high PCE of 9.19%. The fluorinated wide-bandgap p-type conjugated polymer PM6 (Fig. 3j) was also employed as a donor to fabricate all-POSCs with PZ1 as the acceptor. The optimized PM6:PZ1 blend films not only exhibited matching energy levels and complementary absorption, but also possessed suitable phase separated morphology, predominantly face-on stacking and high crystallinity. The all-POSCs exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.2% with this active layer.

Yan et al. synthesized the newly designed polymer acceptor PIDTC-T (Fig. 6b) with thiophene-fused end groups. The all-POSCs based on PM6:PIDTC-T achieved a PCE of 8.35%, which indicated the good compatibility of PIDTC-T with PM6. The authors also added 2% PIDTC-T to the PM6:Y6 blend as an involatile solid additive and achieved a remarkable PCE of 16.76% compared to the original 15.87%. Yan and co-workers designed and synthesized two novel D–A conjugated polymers, PBQxBE and PBQxTE (Fig. 3u and v), respectively. They fabricated all-POSCs with PIDTC-T as the acceptor and PBQxBE or PBQxTE as the donor, and achieved a PCE of 10.17% and 7.40%, respectively.
Zhang et al. designed and synthesized a new polymer acceptor, PN1 (Fig. 6c), with the electron-withdrawing 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis[3-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)benzene]-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the core building block and thiophene as the linking unit. PN1 has a narrow band gap (1.55 eV), high absorption coefficient (1.28 × 105 cm−1) and high electron mobility (9.39 × 104 cm−2 V−1 s−1). The all-POSCs based on PM6:PN1 achieved a PCE of 10.5%. Yan and co-workers designed and synthesized a new polymer acceptor, PT-IDTTIC (Fig. 6d), which exhibited a narrow optical bandgap (1.49 eV) with strong absorption coefficient (2.41 × 105 cm−1). They fabricated all-POSCs with PM6:PT-IDTTIC as the active layer achieved a PCE of 12.06%.
The BDT unit can also be used as a linking unit to synthesize PSMAs. Yan and co-workers designed and synthesized a new polymer acceptor, PFBDT-IDTIC (Fig. 6e), with BDT as the linking unit. A PCE of 10.3% was achieved by combining the fluorinated donor polymer PM6 with PFBDT-IDTIC. Chen and co-workers employed an Si atom-functionalized BDT unit and S and F-functionalized BDT unit to synthesize two PSMAs named PSi-IDIC and PSF-IDIC (Fig. 6f and g), respectively. The all-POSC based on PM6:PSi-IDIC achieved a PCE of 8.29%, while that based on PM6:PSF-IDIC achieved a much higher PCE of 10.18%. The better performance of PM6:PSF-IDIC is attributed to the optimized morphology, decreased charge recombination, and higher exciton dissociation and charge transport. The parameters of the all-POSCs based on IDIC and its derivative-based PSMAs are summarized in Table 4.

Huang et al. adopted the PSMAs strategy to copolymerize the fused-ring small-molecule acceptor Y6 with a thiophene unit to obtain the polymer acceptor PJ1 (Fig. 7d). PJ1 was blended with PBDB-T to fabricate all-POSCs and a high PCE of 14.4% was achieved, which is attributed to the efficient charge separation and collection, broad absorption, and low energy loss. They systematically investigated the effect of the molecular weight of PBDB-T on the photovoltaic performance of all-POSCs. A high PCE of 15.4% was realized by the all-POSCs consisting of PJ1 and medium molecular weight polymer donor PBDB-T (38.1 kg mol−1), which benefited from the proper phase separation in the medium molecular weight PBDB-T:PJ1 blend. Huang et al. designed and synthesized four large-bandgap polymer donors (JD40, JD40-S, JD40-F, and JD40-S-F) comprised of dithieno [3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (fDTBT) and BDT units with or without sulfur/fluorine substitution in the side-chains, and their structures are shown in Fig. 3s and t. The authors blended them with the polymer acceptor PJ1 to fabricate all-POSCs and the devices based on JD40:PJ1 achieved the highest PCE of 15.80%.

Yang and co-workers separated two isomeric end groups (IC-Br(in) and IC-Br(out)) to synthesize three polymer acceptors, PY-IT, PY-OT, and PY-IOT (Fig. 7f–h), respectively, where PY-IOT is a random terpolymer with the same ratio of the two acceptors. They fabricated all-POSCs with PM6 as the polymer donor and PY-IT, PY-OT or PY-IOT as the acceptor. The PM6:PY-IT system achieved an excellent PCE of 15.05%, which is higher than that of PY-IOT (12.12%) and PY-OT (10.04%). Based on this work, they extended the alkyl chains of PY-IT and PY-OT to obtain the PA-5 and PA-6 polymers (Fig. 7f and g), respectively. After device optimization, the all-POSCs based on JD40:PA-5 and JD40:PA-6 realized a PCE of 16.11% and 14.99%, respectively. Gao and co-workers chose PM6 and J71 blended with PY-IT to fabricate ternary all-POSCs and achieved a PCE of 16.52%, which benefited from the tuned crystallinity, effective energy transfer and improved phase separation. Yan et al. applied the fluorination of end groups strategy to develop a dihalogenated end-group IC-FBr, which was modified by fluorine and bromine atoms, simultaneously. Then, they employed IC-FBr to construct a new polymer acceptor, PYF-T (Fig. 7b). PYF-T exhibited red-shifted and stronger absorption spectra, higher electron mobility and stronger molecular packing compared with the non-fluorinated PY-T. The all-POSC based on PM6:PYF-T achieved a PCE of 14.10%, which was higher than that of PM6:PY-T (11.09%). They also investigated the effect of the polymerization sites of small-molecule acceptors on the photovoltaic performance of PYF-T, and the results indicated that polymerization sites play vital roles in determining the device performance of all-POSCs. Min and co-workers developed a new fluorinated polymer acceptor named PY2F-T (Fig. 7c), which has one more fluorine atom than PY-T. The all-POSCs based on PM6:PY2F-T achieved a PCE of 15.0%. They further introduced 20% PYT in the acceptors to fabricate ternary all-POSCs (PM6:PY2F-T:PYT = 1:1.2:0.3) and achieved a breakthrough PCE of 17.2%. Zhou and co-workers designed and synthesized a polymer acceptor, A702 (Fig. 7e), based on dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzo[d][1,2,3]-triazole. The all-POSC based on PBDB-T:A702 obtained a PCE of 11.84%.
Guo and co-workers developed a series of PSMAs featuring an acceptor–acceptor (A–A)-type backbone, L14, L15 and MBTI. These PSMAs were synthesized by copolymerizing a dibrominated fused-ring electron acceptor with distannylated BTI, and their structures are shown in Fig. 7l, p, and s, respectively. The authors blended them with the polymer donor PM6 to fabricate all-POSCs and achieved PCEs of 7.84–15.22%. They also fabricated ternary all-POSCs based on PM6:L15:MTBI (1:1:0.05) and achieved a PCE of 16.18%.
Designing PSMAs that contain the same building blocks as their polymer donor counterparts is an effective approach to increase the compatibility of the blend. Wang et al. copolymerized the high-efficiency fused-ring small molecule acceptor Y5 with BDT unit to obtain the polymer PF5-Y5 (Fig. 7r). They fabricated all-POSCs with PF5-Y5 as the acceptor and wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T as the donor, and a high PCE of 14.45% was achieved, which benefited from the small energy loss (0.57 eV), broad absorption coverage and efficient charge separation and transport. Kim and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of PSMAs named P(BDT2BOY5-X) (Fig. 7q) with BDT as the linking unit. The authors blended them with the polymer donor PBDB-T to fabricate all-POSCs and achieved PCEs of 8.81–11.12%.
Despite the great success achieved by the strategy of PSMAs, most polymers are synthesized from mixed monomers, which can affect the photovoltaic performance and batch-to-batch reproducibility. He et al. synthesized two isomeric polymeric acceptors (PBTIC-γ-2F2T and PBTIC-δ-2F2T, Fig. 7i and j, respectively) by controlling the polymerization site. The δ-position-based polymer PBTIC-δ-2F2T is insoluble and could not be processed, while the γ-position-based polymer PBTIC-γ-2F2T showed good solubility and achieved a better PCE of 14.34%. Jen and co-workers developed a new class of narrow-bandgap polymer acceptors named PZT series (Fig. 7n and o), which incorporated a benzotriazole (BTz)-core fused-ring segment. They synthesized a regioregular polymer acceptor PZT-γ to achieve higher regiospecificity for avoiding the formation of isomers during polymerization. The all-POSCs based on PBDB-T:PZT-γ achieved a record-high PCE of 15.8%, which could be attributed to the better backbone ordering, more extended absorption and more optimal blend morphology. Kim and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of regioregular and regiorandom polymer acceptors with BDT, selenophene or biselenophene as the linking units, named RRg-Cx, Y5-Se-In, Y5-Se-Out, Y5-BiSe-In and Y5-BiSe-Out (regioregular), RRd-Cx, Y5-Se-Mix, and Y5-BiSe-Mix (regiorandom), and their structures are shown in Fig. 7(t, u, v, w, x, y, z, and aa, respectively). The all-POSCs based on PBDB-T and the PSMAs yielded PCEs of 7.60–15.12%, and the highest PCE of 15.12% was obtained in the all-POSCs based on the regioregular RRg-C20 with the optimal side chain length, which is attributed to the high crystallinity and electron mobility as well as optimal blend morphology with a polymer donor. The results demonstrated that the engineering of regioregularity of PSMAs can effectively enhance the electron mobility and realize high-performance all-PSCs. The parameters of the all-POSCs discussed above are summarized in Table 4.
Although PSMAs showed good photovoltaic performances in all-POSCs, most of them are regiorandom polymers given that they are synthesized from mixtures of two monomers with γ-Br-IC or δ-Br-IC end functional groups, which negatively affects the batch-to-batch reproducibility and discourage molecular planarity, affecting the intermolecular packing and decreasing the charge transfer. Developing regioregular PSMAs is an effective strategy for high-performance all-POSCs.

Compared with all-POSCs, all-small-molecule OSCs, and polymer-donor/small-molecule-acceptor OSCs, the current PCE of MD/PA OSCs is relatively low. The reported MD/PA OSCs have good morphology stability, which can maintain good morphology even under high-temperature conditions, and the device performance is stable. The development of active layer materials with excellent morphological stability is of great significance for the practical application of OSCs.


Polymer acceptors should have low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. PDI and NDI units have strong electron-deficient properties and large π-conjugated planes, and polymer acceptors based on PDI units or NDI units generally have excellent electron transport properties and strong electron affinity. Therefore, PDI units or NDI units are often used in the molecular design of polymer acceptors.


In 2014, Zhan et al. reported MD/PA OSCs for the first time. The small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was used as the donor and a polymer acceptor based on PDI named PPDIDTT was used as the acceptor. Their structures are shown in Fig. 8a and e, respectively. The small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 has strong crystallinity and aggregation ability. Consequently, when blended with the polymer acceptor PPDIDTT, a fractured and discontinuous small molecule crystal phase was formed, which is not conductive for the diffusion and dissociation of excitons. Therefore, the PCE of the device was only 0.29%. Accordingly, to solve this problem, they fabricated layer-by-layer solution-processed MD/PA OSCs with PPDIDTT as the acceptor and the squaraine small molecule DIB-SQ (Fig. 8j) as the donor. DIB-SQ exhibits matched energy levels and complementary absorption with PPDIDTT. The layer-by-layer OSCs exhibited improved morphology for exciton dissociation and reduced charge recombination compared to the blend structure. Finally, a PCE of 1.12% was achieved after annealing.

Zhou et al. used a PDI unit to copolymerize with carbazole, thiophene, and selenophene and developed a series of PDI-based polymer acceptors named PC-PDI, PT-PDI and PSe-PDI (Fig. 8b–d), respectively. They constructed MD/PA OSCs with the small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor. When the three acceptors were blended with the small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, it was found by 2D-GIWAXS that the characteristic diffraction signals of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 were mainly exhibited in the blended film, indicating that the strong crystalline p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 dominated the phase separation morphology in the process of film formation and it is easy to form large-scale phase separation. The authors also investigated the effect of the additive DIO. The crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 further increased after the addition of DIO. Although this is beneficial for improving the hole transport, the large-scale phase separation was still maintained. The MD/PA OSCs based on PSe-PDI:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 achieved a PCE of 3.01%. The parameters of the MD/PA OSCs are summarized in Table 5.

Among the NDI-based polymer acceptors, N2200 based on NDI units and bithiophene units is one of the most widely used polymer acceptor.

In 2014, Nguyen et al. constructed MD/PA OSCs with the small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor and polymer N2200 as the acceptor. To facilitate efficient charge transport, the authors optimized the active layer morphology by thermal annealing at 80 °C or adding 0.4% DIO. It was found by 2D-GIWAXS that thermal annealing or addition of DIO could simultaneously increase the order of donor and acceptor, improve the crystallization, and promote efficient charge transport, ultimately achieving a PCE of 2.11%. Park et al. investigated the effect of thermal annealing (80–200 °C) on the morphology of the active layer and device performance of MD/PA OSCs based on p-DTS(FBTTh2):N2200 (3:1). A PCE of 3.02% when annealed at 180 °C was obtained. BDT units have been widely used in the design of donor materials due to their large conjugate planes and excellent charge transport properties. Lee and co-workers designed and synthesized a the small molecule BDT2TR (Fig. 8f) with bi-BDT as the core, thiophene as the π bridge and ethyl rhodanine as the terminal group. BDT2TR has a narrow optical bandgap of 1.55 eV. Accordingly, blending it with N2200 as the active layer to construct OSCs, a PCE of 4.43% was realized.
The pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) unit is an electron-deficient unit, which has been widely used in the design of polymer donors. Ma et al. synthesized three small molecule donors, DPP-B, DPP-N and DPP-P (Fig. 8g–i) with DPP as the core, thiophene as the π bridge and benzene, naphthalene or pyrene as the terminal group, respectively. DPP-B, DPP-N and DPP-P were blended with the polymer acceptor N2200 as the active layer to fabricate MD/PA OSCs. Their results showed that as the terminal group varied from benzene and naphthalene to pyrene, the planarity of the small molecules improved, the solid-state stacking became more orderly, and the charge mobility gradually increased. The DPP-P:N2200-based MD/PA OSCs exhibited a PCE of 2.05%. Inganäs et al. employed thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF) as the core and DPP as the terminal group to synthesize the small molecule donor DTD (Fig. 8k), which was blended with N2200 as the active layer to construct OSCs. In this system, the acceptor N2200 tended to form larger aggregates, and the authors obtained a more suitable phase-separated morphology by adding chloronaphthalene as an additive, achieving a PCE of 3.74%. Jo et al. synthesized small molecule donors DTP-DPP (Fig. 8m) with 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTP) as the core and DPP as the terminal group. The MD/PA OSCs based on DTP-DPP:N2200 exhibited a PCE of 4.82%, which can be ascribed to the advantageous optoelectronic properties of DTP-DPP, such as proper frontier energy levels, intense and broad light absorption, high hole mobility and crystallinity. Jen et al. designed and synthesized two 3D donors, C-DPP and Si-DPP (Fig. 8l), with tetraphenyl-methane or tetraphenyl-silane as core and DPP as terminal groups, respectively. The 3D configuration could effectively inhibit the packing of molecules. Nanoscale phase separation could be formed when the two small molecule donors were blended with N2200 and PCEs of 4.64% and 4.02% were obtained, respectively. The parameters are summarized in Table 5.

Different from the method of using electron-deficient units such as imide to construct polymer acceptors, Liu et al. employed B ← N to reduce the LUMO energy level of the π-conjugated system and synthesized polymers containing B ← N in 2015. These polymers containing B ← N have tunable energy levels, absorption spectra and electron mobility, and thus have also been used as acceptors in MD/PA OSCs.

Liu et al. selected the B ← N-based polymer P-BNBP-T-2 (Fig. 9a) with a high LUMO level (−3.50 eV) as the acceptor and blended it with the small-molecule donor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the active layer. They systematically investigated the effects of thermal annealing and the additive DIO on the morphology of the active layer and device performance. The results showed that the aggregate size and crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 increased after thermal annealing, and the charge transport ability also improved. Consequently, the PCE improved from 1.00% to 2.75%. By adding a small amount of DIO additive, the phase separation size was reduced and the PCE was further increased to 3.50%.
Small-molecule donors with high crystallinity lead to large-size phase separation. Liu et al. adopted the ternary strategy to optimize the morphology of the blends. They selected two small molecules, BTR and DR3TBDTT (Fig. 9d and e), respectively, with the same conjugated backbone but different alkyl side chains as donors and the B ← N-containing polymer P-BNBP-fBT (Fig. 5c) as the acceptor to construct ternary OSCs. Compared with the binary blends of BTR:P-BNBP-fBT and DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT, the ternary blend of BTR:DR3TBDTT:P-BNBP-fBT could effectively inhibit the crystallization of small molecules, reduce the domain size and improve the exciton dissociation. The 2D-GIWAXS results showed that the molecular donors adopted an edge-on orientation in the binary blend films, while they adopted a face-on orientation in the ternary blend, which is favorable for charge transport. Finally, a PCE of 4.85% was achieved.
Based on DR3TBDTT, Liu et al. replaced the thiophene substitute on the BDT unit with carbazole to synthesize DR3TBDTC (Fig. 9g), which was blended with the B ← N-containing polymer acceptor PBN-11 as the active layer to construct MD/PA OSCs. A PCE of 8.01% was obtained after thermal annealing at 180 °C. The device could maintain 89% of its initial PCE after thermal annealing the active layer at 180 °C for 7 days and could maintain 74% of its initial PCE under illumination for 3 days, indicating its excellent thermal stability and light stability. They also systematically studied the effect of the molecular weight of the polymer acceptor P-BNBP-fBT on the phase separation morphology and device performance based on DR3TBDTC:P-BNBP-fBT. The results showed that the high molecular weight P-BNBP-fBT has strong tendency to aggregate in solution, which can effectively inhibit the crystallization of DR3TBDTC. The high molecular weight P-BNBP-fBT blended with DR3TBDTC could achieve a PCE of 6.38%. These results indicate that the molecular weight of the polymer acceptor had an important influence on the phase separation morphology and device performance of the MD/PA OSCs. The polymer PBN-15 (Fig. 5g) with strong aggregation tendency was also used as the acceptor to blend with DR3TBDTC to construct MD/PA OSCs. During the film formation process, the polymer acceptor PBN-15 with strong aggregation tendency inhibited the crystallization of DR3TBDTC to obtain a small-size phase separation morphology, and finally achieve a high PCE of 9.51%, which is the highest among the reported MD/PA OSCs. The parameters are summarized in Table 5.

IID is a promising unit for constructing low-band gap conjugated polymers due to its strong electron-deficiency with low-lying HOMO levels, off-axis dipole moment and ease to function with side chains. IID-based polymers have been widely applied in organic electronics. Liu and co-workers designed and synthesized two polymer acceptors consisting of an alternating FIID unit and thiophene or selenophene unit named PFIID-T and PFIID-S (Fig. 9b and c), respectively. PFIID-T and PFIID-S showed broad absorption spectra, low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels and high electron mobilities. The authors blended them with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 to construct MD/PA OSCs. Due to the weak crystallinity of the PFIID-T and PFIID-S polymers, the high crystalline p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 dominated the phase separation morphology, resulting in a large-scale phase separation morphology, which is not conducive to exciton dissociation and charge transport and results in a PCE of 1.50%. The parameters are summarized in Table 5.


The strategy of PSMAs is one of the effective strategies for designing efficient polymer acceptors, and PZ1 is a highly efficient polymer acceptor synthesized based on this strategy. In 2018, Li et al. selected two small molecules, SM1 and DR3TBDTT (Fig. 9f and g), respectively, with different end groups as donors and blended them with the polymer acceptor PZ1 as the active layer to construct MD/PA OSCs. To promote the absorption intensity, enhance the carrier mobility and reduce the recombination of excitons, the authors added N-methylpyrrolidone and chloronaphthalene to SM1:PZ1 and DR3TBDTT:PZI as additives, respectively. The SM1-based OSCs and DR3TBDTT-based OSCs showed PCEs of 3.97% and 5.86%, respectively. This work proves that PSMAs also have great potential in MD/PA OSCs. The parameters are summarized in Table 5.

According to the above introduction, it can be seen that there are few donors suitable for MD/PA OSCs at present. Although the development of some new materials have improved the PCE of MD/PA OSCs, there is still a big gap compared with all-POSCs. It should be noted that MD/PA OSCs exhibit the characteristics of good morphology and thermal stability, where stability is one of the inevitable requirements in the development of practical applications of OSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal the reasons for the excellent morphological stability.

n-Type conjugated polymer acceptors have experienced nearly 30 years of development. The PCE of OSCs based on polymer acceptors has grown from less than 1% for CN-PPV in the early stages to 8–10% for polymer acceptors based on PDI and NDI, and 17% for PSMAs, where OSCs based on polymer acceptors have reached the threshold of practical applications. To realize the application of OSCs based on n-type conjugated polymer acceptors, further research is needed in the following aspects:

1) Design and synthesis of novel PSMAs. The strategy of “polymerized small-molecule acceptors” opens up an efficient way for the design and synthesis of novel polymeric acceptors. In recent years, the narrow band gap SMAs have developed rapidly, and various new small-molecule acceptors have been emerging, which has laid a solid foundation for the design and synthesis of novel PSMAs. All the strategies used to optimize the structure of SMAs, such as core engineering, side-chain engineering, halogen substitution and symmetry-breaking strategy, can be used to optimize the structure of PSMAs. In addition, the synthesis of regioregular polymers by controlling the coupling sites is also an efficient strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of PSMAs.
2) Studies on the stability of n-type polymer acceptors and devices. Realizing the practical applications of OSCs requires a service life of at least 3–5 years, and thus researching and solving the stability of photovoltaic materials and devices is the key to realize practical applications, including the chemical stability, light stability, morphology stability of photovoltaic materials, and the reproducibility and stability of the device. The chemical stability and morphological stability of polymer photovoltaic materials are better than that of small-molecular materials, but the control of their relative molecular mass and batch stability require great efforts.
3) For all-POSCs: large-area flexible all-POSCs. All-POSCs are expected to be preferentially applied in flexible OSCs. However, there are few studies currently focusing on flexible all-POSCs. Researchers should carry out systematic and in-depth research on the preparation of large-area all-POSCs, the selection of electrode interface modifiers and their effects on device performance, and anhydrous and oxygen-free packaging of flexible devices. This will lay the foundation for the industrialized preparation and application of flexible all-POSCs in the future.
4) For MD/PA OSCs:
a) Developing small-molecule donors with weak crystallinity and controlling their morphology through molecular structure design. At present, there are few materials suitable for use in MD/PA OSCs. The small-molecule donors are mainly p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, DR3TBDTT and DPP derivatives, and the acceptors are mainly N2200 based on NDI units and polymer acceptors based on B ← N. Small molecules have strong crystallinity and aggregation tendency, while the crystallinity of polymers is weak. Therefore, during film formation, small molecules dominate the film morphology and easy to form large-scale phase separation, resulting in a low device performance. Thermal annealing and the use of additives can improve the PCE to a certain extent. Therefore, subsequent research should focus on the development of small-molecule donors with weak crystallinity and controlling the morphology through molecular structure design.
b) Investigating the mechanism of the excellent morphological stability of MD/PA OSCs. Although the PCE of MD/PA OSCs is still far from that of other types of OSCs, MD/PA OSCs have excellent morphological stability. Thus, it is necessary to reveal the reasons for their excellent morphological stability, which has important implications for the future practical application of OSCs.
5) Green solvent processing. Given that conjugated polymers have better solubility in halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, high-performance OSCs are usually processed with halogenated solvents, although they are considered highly hazardous to the environment and human health. Accordingly, the using of green solvents (such as ortho-xylene (o-XY) and para-xylene (p-XY, etc.) in the fabrication process can effectively mitigate the environmental impact of solution-processed OSCs, which will accelerate the mass fabrication of OSCs and is crucial for their industrial-scale implementation.
6) Large-area devices. At present, high-performance OSCs are usually small-area devices (less than 0.1 cm2) fabricated by spin coating with an active layer thickness of about 100 nm. Large-area devices are more conducive to industrialization, but there are several issues associated with large-area OSCs, such as the presence of defects, film uniformity, and the sensitivity of the devices to these aspects, and thus it is inappropriate to prepare large-area OSCs with thin active layers. Consequently, photoelectric materials with high thickness tolerability should be developed to fabricate effective large-area OSCs. The modular design of large-area OSCs is an effective strategy to reduce their PCE losses. Spin coating is the most commonly used technique to fabricate OSCs, but it leads to several unintentional and bewildering variations in device processing, and thus it is not suitable for the fabrication of large-area devices. At present, researchers have developed various scalable techniques for the fabrication of large-area devices, such as knife coating, gravure printing, slot-die coating, and inkjet printing. By combining thick-film material systems with efficient modular design and using a suitable printing method, the fabrication of large-area OSCs will be successfully realized.
