Three perylenediimide (PDI) acceptors (P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4) were synthesized by functionalizing the bay positions of PDI with benzil, 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and 2,3,7,8-tetraphenylpyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline as linkers, respectively. The photovoltaic properties of the three acceptor molecules have been investigated. The different PDI linker units show different physical and chemical properties of the PDIs. The three PDIs display different non-planar geometrical structures because of the different linker units, which affect the corresponding morphology of the blend films and also influence the charge mobility and fill factor (FF) of the organic solar cells (OSCs). Furthermore, the gradient energy levels of the three PDIs provide an efficient research model for the relationship of device open-circuit voltage (Voc) and energy levels. As the result, the P4N4 based non-fullerene devices show the best photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.71%, whereas the P2O2 and P2N2 based non-fullerene devices show relatively lower PCEs of 2.53% and 3.86%, respectively.

Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on organic donor materials and acceptor materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their outstanding potential of producing light-weight and flexible photovoltaic devices via low-cost large-scale fabrication. Fullerene derivative acceptors, combined with the efficient polymer or small molecular donor materials, constitute high-efficiency OCSs due to the good electron transport properties and the suitable morphology in the BHJ films. However, the weak absorption in the visible region, the limited band gap variability and the high cost of the fullerene derivatives impede the development of OSCs. On this occasion, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have gained much attention for their superiorities such as the adjustable energy levels, suitable absorption, and easy synthesis. Meanwhile, the OSCs based on NFAs, including fused aromatic imides, calamitic (A–D–A type) acceptors, polymer acceptors,etc., have made great progress recently.

The perylenediimide (PDI) unit is a promising building block for NFAs applied into large-scale OSCs because of its favorable absorption, energy levels, electron mobility, and low cost. However, the PDI block unit with a large planar structure shows a large aggregated nanostructure and excessively large domains in the active layers which severely degrade the performance of OSCs. Hence, much attention has been devoted to non-planar PDI acceptors to overcome that drawback recently. There are various methods to prepare non-planar PDI derivatives, including the PDI dimers, trimers or tetramers synthesized by the different position functionalization. The PDI dimers, trimers or tetramers show the obvious non-planar geometries compared to the PDI core unit, which is conducive to form the suitable nanostructure in blend films for the enhancement of the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). The different linker units of the non-planar PDIs can result in different LUMO levels of the PDI acceptors, which closely relate to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in OSCs. Recently, Yan and co-works demonstrated a non-fullerene OSC with 9.5% efficiency and with a small driving force, and obtain a Voc of 1.11 V for a spiro-fluorene linked PDI dimer (SF-PDI2) and a novel polymer (P3TEA) blend film, which creates a good path towards highly efficient OSCs with a low energy loss.
Hence, it is important to obtain high-efficiency PDI acceptors with matched energy levels to achieve high Voc, and a suitable non-planar geometrical structure to form a good nanostructure to achieve high Jsc and FF. Herein, we report a PDI system with three relevant PDI acceptors to access high performance non-fullerene OSCs. The relationship of the structure and performance of PDI acceptors has been systematically studied. As shown in Scheme 1, the three PDIs are named P2O2 (PDI dimer bay position functionalization with the benzil linker), P2N2 (PDI dimer bay position functionalization with the 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline linker), and P4N4 (PDI tetramer bay position functionalization with the 2,3,7,8-tetraphenylpyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline linker). The different linker units generate different PDI geometrical structures and energy levels, which affect the device performance parameters. The PDI non-fullerene devices were fabricated with a well-established wide-bandgap polymer (PDBT-T1), and yield the gradient Voc, Jsc and FF data which matched well with the design strategy. In particular, the P4N4 based OSC devices show the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.71% with a Voc of 0.958 V, a Jsc of 9.40 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.4%.


Scheme 2 shows the chemical structures and the synthetic routes of these three non-fullerene PDI acceptors. Diboronic ester monomer 1 was synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling with 4,4′-dibromobenzil and bis(pinacolato)diboron, and the product was purified by recrystallization from methanol. The important intermediate 1-bromo-PDI (PDI-Br, 2) was synthesized according to the previously reported literature procedures. The P2O2 was synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling with monomer 1 and PDI-Br, then the P2O2 was reacted with o-phenylenediamine and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride to give the products P2N2 and P4N4, respectively. The P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 were purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The acceptors were characterized using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS. The acceptors were easily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which ensures the preparation of the neat film using the acceptors. The thermal stability of the acceptors was investigated by thermal gravity analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the results are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI). P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 showed good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss at temperatures (Td) of 393, 408 and 394 °C, respectively.


The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to optimize the ground state geometries of the acceptor molecules using the Gaussian 09 package40. As shown in Fig. 1, for the 3 acceptors, the dihedral angle between the benzene ring and the conjoint PDI unit (A1 or A3) is calculated to be about 57° to 60°. The dihedral angle A2 between the two benzene rings in the middle of the P2O2 is calculated to be 139.2°, while the diketone unit was reacted with the o-phenylenediamine or 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine, for P2N2 and P4N4, the A2 is calculated to be 11.7° and 11.2°, respectively. The relevant dihedral angle data are summarized in Table 1. The difference of A2 makes the PDI linker units show different geometrical types, which make the P2O2 molecule show a linear-type linker, the P2N2 molecule exhibit a V-type linker, and the P4N4 molecule display an X-type linker. These different geometrical type linkers make the intermolecular non-planar structures of the PDI molecules different, which are shown in Fig. 1. The 3 different sides of view for the relevant calculated structure are also shown in Fig. 1; the moderate dihedral angles A1 and A3 of the 3 acceptors make the three PDI molecules show the non-planar geometries which is expected to effectively prevent the three PDI acceptors from forming the a large aggregate state in the solid film, which is beneficial for the PDI blend film applied in the OSCs. In particular, the P4N4 shows a more polydirectional symmetrical geometry compared with the P2O2 and P2N2, which could make the P4N4 provide a more smooth film and good isotropic electron transport properties.

Fig. 2a shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the PDI acceptors in 10−5 M chloroform solution, and Fig. 2b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PDI acceptors in the film state. The results are summarized in Table 2. In chloroform, P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 show the maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 534, 538 and 538 nm, respectively. In the film state, P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 show the λmax at 538, 540 and 538 nm, respectively, while the P4N4 shows an absorption peak at 457 nm in chloroform and an absorption peak at 461 nm in the film, which is due to the absorption of the 2,3,7,8-tetraphenylpyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline unit inside the P4N4 molecule. In the film state, P2O2 shows a distinct shoulder peak of the λmax at 502 nm compared to P2N2 and P4N4, which indicates that the linear-type linker PDI (P2O2) shows a large aggregate state than the V-type linker PDI (P2N2) and the X-type linker PDI (P4N4), in agreement with the DFT calculated results. The absorption onsets of P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 in thin films are 592, 597 and 589 nm, respectively, which correspond to an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 2.09, 2.08 and 2.11 eV, respectively.

The energy level of the PDI acceptors was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The CV curves are presented in Fig. 2c. The onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials are measured, and the HOMO and LUMO levels are calculated relative to the redox potentials of the ferrocene internal standard. The HOMO levels of P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 are −6.04, −5.96 and −5.97 eV, respectively, the LUMO levels of P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 are −3.80, −3.73 and −3.69 eV, respectively, which correspond to an electrochemical band gap (Ecvg) of 2.24, 2.23 and 2.28 eV, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 2. Based on these data, the energy level diagram of the OSCs is shown in Fig. 2d. The work functions of the ITO electrode, Al electrode and Ca, as well as the HOMO and LUMO levels of PDBT-T1 were adopted from the values reported in the literature. Interestingly, for these PDI acceptors, the electron-donating bridge units cause the elevation of the energy levels. The LUMO offsets of the donor polymer between P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 (ΔLUMO) are 0.37, 0.30 and 0.26 eV, respectively. It can be speculated that P4N4 should lead to the relatively highest Voc when used in OSCs.

In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 as non-fullerene acceptors, solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells based on these PDIs were fabricated with a conventional device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT-T1:PDIs/Ca/Al, as shown in Scheme 1. The PDBT-T1 was used as the donor polymer. The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the studied OSCs as well as the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The best device parameters are summarized in Table 3, and the average values and standard deviation of device statistics are listed in Table S1 (ESI). The P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 based devices without the DIO additive showed the PCE of 2.27%, 2.69% and 4.28%, respectively. In particular, the P2O2 based devices showed a Voc of 0.911 V, while the P2N2 and P4N4 based devices exhibited the Voc of 0.958 V and 0.976 V, respectively. The difference of the Voc values of the three PDI acceptor devices is in agreement with the trend of the ΔLUMO values listed in Table 2, which can match up with the relationship of electron-donating bridge units for PDIs, energy levels and the device Voc. For the Jsc and FF parameters, the P4N4 based showed a Jsc of 8.71 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50.3%, while the P2O2 and P2N2 based devices exhibited a lower Jsc and FF parameters compared with the P4N4 based devices. The difference of the Jsc and FF of the different acceptor devices can also verify the geometric structures of the acceptors calculated by the DFT method, which with the device of the P4N4 acceptor showed the best geometric structure and efficient Jsc and FF. Moreover, the hole and electron mobility of the devices and the morphology of the active layers also affirm that difference, which will be discussed below. By inclusion of the 0.5% DIO additive, the PCE of the devices was considerably enhanced. In particular, the P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 based devices with the 0.5% DIO additive showed the PCE of 2.53%, 3.86% and 5.71%, respectively. For P2N2 and P4N4 acceptor devices, the DIO additive plays an important role in the increase of performance, which is mainly shown in the enhancement of Jsc and FF. This is attributed to the enhancement of the hole and electron mobility of the devices and the optimized morphology of the active layers by DIO addition, which also will be discussed below.

Fig. 3b shows the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, the EQE curves can match up with the enhancement of Jsc for the devices with/without DIO additive. The OSC devices based on P2O2 and P2N2 acceptors exhibited an EQE, the maximum value of about 45% to 50% at 540 nm, and showed a trough around 420 nm, while the P4N4 based devices exhibited an EQE exceeding 45% in the range of 360 to 650 nm with the maximum value reaching 56% at around 560 nm. The broad EQE of P4N4 devices indicates that the efficient electron transfer from the LUMO of PDBT-T1 to the LUMO of P4N4 and the efficient hole transfer from the HOMO of P4N4 to the HOMO of PDBT-T1 take place together compared to those of the P2O2 and P2N2 devices, which can match up with the UV-vis absorption spectra of PDIs and PDBT-T1 in neat films and blend films (Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI)).

To understand the difference of the Jsc and FF of the different acceptor devices, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of PDBT-T1:PDI blend films without or with 0.5% DIO and the PDI neat films in space-charge-limited current (SCLC) devices were measured. The device structures of the electron only and hole only devices are ITO/Al/PDBT-T1:PDIs (or PDI neat film)/Al and ITO/MoO3/PDBT-T1:PDIs/MoO3/Al, respectively. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics from the corresponding SCLC devices are shown in Fig. 4 and S4 (ESI), and the corresponding electron/hole mobility data are listed in Table 4. In the PDI neat films, P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 exhibit the electron mobility of 2.42 × 10−3, 2.60 × 10−3 and 2.69 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are suitable for use as electron acceptor materials. For the blend films, the hole mobilities are significantly lower than electron mobilities without the DIO additive. Generally, the addition of 0.5% DIO into PDBT-T1:PDI blend films increased both the electron and hole mobilities, which can be ascribed to the fact that the addition of 0.5% DIO can provide a better morphology than the blend films without DIO. So, the devices with the 0.5% DIO additive show higher Jsc and FF than those corresponding devices without the DIO additive. Moreover, the PDBT-T1:P4N4 blend film with the 0.5% DIO additive shows a μe/μh ratio of 1.57, which is the most balanced μe/μh ratio compared to that of the other blend films. The better-balanced electron/hole ratio in the PDBT-T1:P4N4 devices with 0.5% DIO additive is responsible for their reduced bimolecular charge recombination, which is the reason for the corresponding devices showing the best performance with a Jsc of 9.40 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.4%.

Since the morphology is an important factor for the device performance of OSCs, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the morphologies of the active layers. The corresponding AFM images are shown in Fig. 5. The blend films of PDBT-T1:P2O2, PDBT-T1:P2N2 and PDBT-T1:P4N4 without DIO exhibited smooth and uniform morphologies with the root mean square (RMS) values of 1.45, 1.17 and 1.03 nm, respectively. While the 0.5% DIO additive was mixed into the blend films, the RMS of the corresponding AFM images improved from 1.45 to 2.04 nm for PDBT-T1:P2O2, from 1.17 to 1.61 nm for PDBT-T1:P2N2 and from 1.03 to 1.23 nm for PDBT-T1:P4N4, specifically. The higher RMS values for the corresponding blend films with DIO show more obvious aggregations and phase separations, which is consistent well with the significantly increased charge mobility and FF after adding 0.5% DIO in the PDI based devices, especially for the P2N2 and P4N4 devices. The TEM study results also provided more direct evidence to support the different performances of the P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 based devices. The TEM images of the blend films without DIO are shown in Fig. 6a, c and e, which demonstrated that the linear-type linker molecule (P2O2) based blend film showed the obvious black aggregation compared to the V-type linker molecule (P2N2) and the X-type linker molecule (P4N4) based blend films. The direct distinction observed in the TEM images of the P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4 based blend films can match well with the corresponding RMS values, which could be attributed to the different linker units and the distinctive non-planar structures among the PDI molecules. Moreover, the different morphologies of the blend films are in agreement with the trend of the corresponding Jsc and FF. While the 0.5% DIO additive was mixed into the blend films, the TEM images of the P2N2 and P4N4 based blend films (Fig. 6d and f) showed slightly increased aggregate domains compared with the corresponding blend films without DIO, which increased the charge mobility and FF after adding 0.5% DIO in the P2N2 and P4N4 based devices. The morphology of the P2O2 blend film with 0.5% DIO was much more homogeneous with a nano-phase segregated crystalline structure, which matches well with the corresponding largest RMS change from the AFM images. Therefore, the P2O2 based blend films showed a relatively larger aggregation nano-phase morphology, which reduced the charge separation and mobility compared with the P2O2 and P4N4 based blend films. These results illustrate the higher Jsc and FF values for the P2N2 and P4N4 based devices (especially for the P4N4 based devices) than that achieved with the P2O2 based devices.

In summary, three PDI acceptors (P2O2, P2N2 and P4N4) are synthesized by PDI bay positions functionalization with benzil, 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and 2,3,7,8-tetraphenylpyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline linker, respectively. The three PDIs display different non-planar geometrical structures because of the different linker units, which affect the device performance parameters. The V-type linker molecule (P2N2) and the X-type linker molecule (P4N4) show more non-planar geometrical structures than the linear-type linker molecule (P2O2), which benefits the corresponding morphology of the blend films and promote the charge mobility and FF of the OSC devices. Furthermore, the gradient energy levels of the three PDIs provide an efficient research model for the relationship of device Voc and energy levels. Meanwhile, the P4N4 shows an efficient absorption from 400 nm to 450 nm, and this absorption also provide an efficient EQE response, which indicate that the efficient hole transfer from the HOMO of P4N4 to the HOMO of PDBT-T1 takes place in the P4N4 devices. Finally, the P4N4 based non-fullerene OSC devices show the best performance; the PCE of these devices reached 5.71% with a Voc of 0.958 V, a Jsc of 9.40 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.4%. The results demonstrate that the geometrical type tuning of the PDI linker units is an efficient method to design efficient non-fullerene acceptors.

The organic solar cells (OSCs) with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT-T1:PDIs/Ca/Al were fabricated. First, PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP A 4083) was spin-coated on top of a cleaned ITO and annealed in air at 150 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the active layer with an optimal thickness of ca. 100 nm was formed by spin-coating the mixed solution of PDBT-T1 and PDIs (P2O2, P2N2 or P4N4) in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (PDBT-T1:PDIs, 1:1, w/w; the concentration of PDBT1 is fixed at 10 mg mL−1; without/with the 0.5% DIO (v/v) additive for each PDI acceptor blend) at 1600 rpm for 60 s atop the PEDOT:PSS layer. After that, the active layers were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min for the devices obtained by thermal annealing treatment. Finally, a 10 nm Ca and a 100 nm Al layer were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation onto the active layer through a shadow mask at a vacuum of ∼5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the devices was 4.50 mm2. During the test, an aperture with an area of 3.14 mm2 was used. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were tested in a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The device performances were measured under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 tested by a calibrated silicon solar cell and a read out meter (Model 91150V, Newport) with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (ClassAAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel). The EQE spectra were determined from a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV measurement, Inc).


The charge carrier mobilities of PDBT-T1:PDI blend films without or with 0.5% DIO and the PDI neat films were determined from space-charge-limited current (SCLC) devices. The device structures of the electron only and hole only devices are ITO/Al/PDBT-T1:PDIs (or PDI neat film)/Al and ITO/MoO3/PDBT-T1:PDIs/MoO3/Al, respectively. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark J–V current to the model of a single carrier SCLC using the equation: J = 9ε0εrμV2/8d3, where J is the current density, d is the thickness of the blend films or the neat films, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, and μ is the charge carrier mobility. V = Vapp − Vbi, where Vapp is the applied voltage and Vbi is the offset voltage. The carrier mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves.
