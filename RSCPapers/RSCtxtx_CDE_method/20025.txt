We report perylene diimide (PDI) small molecules based on diphenylmethane, triphenylmethane, and tetraphenylmethane cores, named PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4, respectively. The OSC performances of PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 are comparable. The PM-PDI3 based device with PDBT-T1 as the donor achieved a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.58% along with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 11.02 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) of 69.9%, a 1.32 times boost in PCE with respect to the PM-PDI2 based control device (3.26%). The high photovoltaic performance of the PM-PDI3 based device can be attributed to its relatively high-lying LUMO level, complementary absorption spectra with the polymer donor material PDBT-T1, relatively favorable morphology and improved exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency. A PCE of 7.58% is among the highest efficiency of phenyl-methane as core based non-fullerene organic solar cells. Overall, this work provides a new approach to enhance the performance of non-fullerene acceptors.

In the past decade, organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of donors and acceptors as active layers have attracted increasing attention owing to their advantages of light weight, low cost, solution-processing ability and their potential application in flexible devices. Fullerene derivatives have been dominant electron acceptors in OSCs for the past few decades, and their success is attributed to their outstanding electron-withdrawing ability and charge transport properties. However, they suffer from some intrinsic drawbacks, such as poor spectral absorption, limited tunablity of chemical structures and energy levels, high-cost purification and morphological instability, hindering the further commercialization of fullerene OSCs. Therefore, research on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is of significance.

NFA materials, possessing favorable electron-accepting and transporting properties, are believed to excel fullerene and have undergone rapid development. A variety of high performance fullerene-free acceptors have been invented, especially for the systems of ITIC and perylene diimides (PDIs). Recently, Zou's group reported that single-junction OSC devices based on Y6 exceeded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16%; Chen's group reported the highest PCE of 17.3% in tandem devices based on PBDB-T:F-M and PTB7-Th:O6T-4F:PC71BM, demonstrating the great potential of non-fullerene acceptors for future commercialization.
Perylene diimide (PDI) small molecules are competitive among the various non-fullerene acceptors. They have several advantages: (1) easy large-scale preparation and purification; (2) adjustability of molecular structure, energy levels, and absorption range (the PDI moiety provides several substitution sites, including the bay position, the non-bay position and the nitrogen atoms); (3) high electron mobilities in the order of 101–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Despite the above-mentioned advantages of PDI derivatives, PDIs tend to form large aggregate domains due to their large and planar structures, which may aggravate geminate recombination and deteriorate device performance. Accordingly, we need to make efforts to suppress the formation of 1D π stacking while trying to retain sufficient intermolecular LUMO–LUMO overlap for adequate electron transport. This can be achieved by constraining two or more PDIs to be non-planar and/or with the introduction of a conjugated bridge. Previously, Yan's group reported that a PDI dimer featuring a spirobifluorene linker, named SF-PDI2, achieved an impressive PCE of 9.50% with a high VOC of 1.11 V with the low bandgap polymer P3TEA. Our group developed a star-shaped PDI trimer TPA-PDI3 with a triphenylamine (TPA) core, which displayed weak molecular aggregation, strong absorption and energy levels matching with the donor of PBDB-T; OSCs based on PBDB-T:TPA-PDI3 gave a PCE of 5.84%. Yan's group used the ring-fusion strategy to obtain a novel PDI tetramer named FTTB-PDI4, and achieved a PCE of 10.58% by matching FTTB-PDI4 with the polymeric donor P3TEA, which is the highest value for PDI small molecule-based OSCs.
Despite the progress mentioned above, more efforts should be made to improve photovoltaic performances towards commercialization. Therefore, it is of importance to design and synthesize new acceptor materials, and investigate the relationship between molecular structure and OSC performance.
Bearing these considerations in mind, we designed and synthesized a phenyl-methane based PDI dimer, PDI trimer and PDI tetramer, named PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4, respectively. Their structures are shown in Scheme 1. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties, molecular simulations, charge transport and photovoltaic properties were investigated in detail. All these acceptor molecules have a central phenyl-substituted methane core and the peripheral PDI units are directly linked to the benzene. PM-PDI2 is a V-type molecule, which contains two flanked PDI units; PM-PDI3 is a star-shape C3-symmetrical molecule with three peripheral PDI units; and PM-PDI4 is a C4-symmetrical molecule with four PDI units linked to the central benzene. The influences of the varied molecular geometries on the photophysical properties, the active layer morphologies and the photovoltaic performances are studied in detail.

The synthesis routes to all three compounds are shown in Scheme 1. The precursor of the borate ester (1–3) was synthesized via a borylation coupling reaction of the corresponding bromide with bis(pinacolato)diboron catalyzed by Pd(dppf)Cl2. Another precursor of monobromo-PDI (4) was obtained via bromination of PDIs according to known procedures. Then, the final products of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 were obtained by reacting the borate ester and monobromo-PDI via a Suzuki coupling reaction in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4. The purification of PM-PDI2 was easy due to the relatively few by-products, but the purification of PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 was very different due to the multiple reaction sites, and we purified them by repeated column chromatography. All of the new compounds have been fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Although satisfactory mass spectra of PM-PDI2 and PM-PDI4 were not available owing to the influence of the matrix, ion detection mode and concentration of samples, the molecular ion peaks (MALDI-TOF-MS) of these three compounds have been successfully acquired (Fig. S15–S17, ESI). All of the new compounds have been fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS). The three target products are highly soluble in general organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, tetrahedrofuran (THF), ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and chloroform at room temperature. Such good solubility is mainly ascribed to the tridimensional molecular scaffold. The thermal properties were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The three target products have a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of above 300 °C (Fig. S18, ESI).


The absorption spectra of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2, S3 (ESI) and the corresponding data are provided in Table 1. The three PDI acceptors demonstrated similar absorption spectra in solution. PM-PDI2 in dichloromethane solution showed a broad absorption in the range of 450–600 nm with a maximum at 534 nm. PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 demonstrated almost the same absorption spectra as PM-PDI2, but the molar extinction coefficient ε values of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 solutions ascend from 1.44 × 105 to 1.90 × 105 to 2.09 × 105 M−1 cm−1 with increasing number of PDI units. From the solution to the film, the absorption edges red-shift by ca. 50 nm, suggesting the intermolecular π–π stacking of these acceptors in the solid state. PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 pure films exhibit optical absorption onsets of 598 nm, 596 nm and 596 nm, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the main absorption of PDBT-T1 is in the range from 400 to 700 nm, which complements the absorption spectrum of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4. The optimal band gap (Eoptg) values of the three PDI derivatives estimated from the film absorption edges are 2.07, 2.08 and 2.08 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 in dichloromethane solutions were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 2. The LUMO energy levels of these molecules were calculated from the onset reduction potentials according to the equation of ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) (eV), assuming Fc/Fc+ to be −4.8 eV. The HOMO energy levels were estimated from the equation EHOMO = ELUMO − Eoptg (eV). The corresponding energy level data are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO levels up-shift from −3.90 to −3.86 eV, with the increased number of PDI units. The high-lying LUMO of PM-PDI4 potentially contributes to the high open-circuit voltage. It is worth noting that PM-PDI2 exhibits lower LUMO energy levels than PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4, which should be attributed to the relatively lower dipole moment of the symmetric structure.

To gain deep insight into the structural and electronic properties of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4, density functional theory (DFT) calculation (B3LYP/6-31G*) was performed on the three molecules. The optimized configurations and orbital distributions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are illuminated in Fig. S6 (ESI). The electron clouds of the HOMO energy levels were delocalized throughout the PDI core, while the LUMO energy levels are dominated by the perylene diimide core. Moreover, the distinct dihedral angles (Fig. S6, ESI) between adjacent PDIs indicate that the flanking PDIs in the phenyl–methane core form large steric repulsion, especially for PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4, suggesting that the more PDI units introduced, the more twisted the molecular configuration. Furthermore, the theoretically predicted HOMO and LUMO energy levels and bandgap of the three compounds fit quite well with the values obtained by CV experiment (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI).

We used a polymeric donor (PDBT-T1) and the PDI acceptors (PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4) to construct OSCs with a conventional device configuration: ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/Zracac/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide, PEDOT is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and PSS is poly(styrenesulfonate). The p-type polymer PDBT-T1 was selected as the donor material because of the complementary absorption and the matched energy levels with these three acceptors (see Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, ESI). The processing solvent for the active layer is ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The detailed device fabrication and measurements are reported in the ESI. The optimal conditions for preparing the devices were obtained by changing film thickness, annealing temperature and additives carefully. The optimized weight ratio of D/A was 1:1 and the optimized film thickness is ca. 95 nm. The optimized ratio of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was 0.25%. Fig. 4a illustrates the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs based on PDBT-T1:PM-PDI2, PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3, and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2. The PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4-based device yields a PCE of 7.52%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.01 V, a JSC of 11.20 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.67. In contrast, the PDBT-T1:PM-PDI2-based device exhibits a low PCE of 3.26%, with an enhanced VOC (0.98 V) but reduced JSC (8.49 mA cm−2) and FF (39.3%). PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 showed an impressive PCE as high as 7.58%, with a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 11.02 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.9% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Benefiting from the increased JSC and FF of PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4-based OSCs, both devices exhibit higher PCEs than the PDBT-T1:PM-PDI2 counterpart.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimal devices based on PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 are displayed in Fig. 4b. JSCs integrated from the IPCE match well with the values from the J–V curves within 4% error (Table 2). We can see that the IPCE curves for all the three types of devices cover a broad and strong photoresponse range from 300 to 700 nm. The IPCE values of PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4-based solar cells are distinctly higher than the counterpart of PM-PDI2.

To clarify the charge mobilities in the OSC devices, we have measured the electron and hole mobilities in the blend films by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only diodes with the structure of ITO/MoOX/active layers/MoOX/Al and electron-only diodes with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Zracac/Al were fabricated and measured to extract the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of PM-PDIx pure films, and PDBT-T1:PM-PDIx blend films (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, Table S2, ESI.). The μes values of PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 pristine films changed from 5.78 × 10−4 to 7.08 × 10−4 to 7.39 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1 with increasing number of PDI units. PM-PDIx pure films and PDBT-T1:PM-PDIx blend films have μes of the same magnitude, which implied that efficient electron-transport pathways are unaffected to a great extent by the presence of the donor polymer. The μh/μe of the three blend films is 2.19, 1.70 and 1.75, respectively. PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4-based blend films showed increased hole and electron mobilities and more balanced μh and μe values, which benefits the charge transport and corresponds to a high fill factor.


The surface morphology measurements of the BHJ active layer were performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As can be seen from the AFM height images (Fig. 6), PDBT-T1:PM-PDI2 blend film displayed a smooth and uniform morphology with a slightly larger root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.81 nm than those of PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4, which could be attributed to the stronger PDI aggregation therein. In contrast, PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4 demonstrated relatively clear and delicate nanofibrillar structures; and no strong molecular aggregation between PDBT-T1 and the two acceptors occurred, which is beneficial for charge transport and extraction.


Charge collection and exciton dissociation in active layers were also investigated and the corresponding curves of photocurrent density versus effective voltage of the optimal OSCs are shown in Fig. 7a. The saturation photocurrent density (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be estimated from the curves of Jph and Veff. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss = JSC/Jsat) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll = Jmax/Jsat) were calculated under the short circuit and maximum power output conditions, and the ηcoll values are 74.6%, 92.8% and 90.8%, respectively, and the corresponding ηcoll values are 39.4%, 77.6% and 74.2%. The much higher ηdiss and ηcoll values of PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4-based devices demonstrate their higher exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies, corresponding with their higher JSC and FF.


We investigated charge recombination by measuring JSC at different light intensities (P), as shown in Fig. 7b, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S3 (ESI). The relationship between JSC and P can be described using JSC ∝ PS, wherein S = 1 indicates that all the free carriers are collected and swept out before recombination, and S < 1 indicates a certain degree of bimolecular recombination. The recombination parameter S values are 0.872, 0.971 and 0.940 for the devices with PDBT-T1:PM-PDI2, PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4 BHJ films, respectively, suggesting weak bimolecular recombination of PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4-based devices, which is consistent with their higher JSC and FF.

In addition to the OSC performance, the acceptor's cost still deserves the attention of materials scientists. Facile synthesis and the high yields for such PDI-based acceptors enable ready material access at greatly reduced cost. Taking PM-PDI3 as an example, the synthesis cost of the PDI material was estimated to be 620 RMB g−1 (≈90$ per g) based on the price of solvents and chemicals supplied in China (Table S4, ESI), which is far less than the price of fused-ring electron acceptors represented by ITIC. Furthermore, if large-scale preparation is performed, the cost is expected to be further reduced, showing the distinctive advantage of PDI materials for industrial applications.

In conclusion, we designed and synthesized three methane-perylene diimide-based small molecular acceptors, PM-PDI2, PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4, and investigated the effects of PDI number on the photophysical, electronic, charge-transport, photovoltaic, and morphological properties. PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 exhibit relatively stronger absorption profiles, upshifted LUMO energy levels and a higher electron mobility than PM-PDI2, which endow PM-PDI3 and PM-PDI4 with better prospects for OSC applications. Furthermore, PDBT-T1:PM-PDI3 and PDBT-T1:PM-PDI4 active layers delivered a high PCE of 7.58% and 7.52%, respectively, outcompeting PDBT-T1:PM-PDI2. Notably, compared with PM-PDI4, the slightly enhanced PCE of PM-PDI3 is mainly attributed to the improved FF of 69.9%, which is one of the highest FFs for the PDI-based OSCs to date. Our results demonstrated that PDI number in PDI small molecules has a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance.
