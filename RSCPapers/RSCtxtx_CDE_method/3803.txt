Three asymmetrical dithienosilole monomers with different electron withdrawing groups (nonanoyl group, octyl cyanoacetate or malononitrile) were synthesized and a series of silicon containing conjugated polymers (PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 to PBDTDTSi-3) were prepared from these asymmetrical dithienosilole building blocks via microwave assisted polymerization. Density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemistry calculations were employed for the optimization of molecular structures, deep understanding of the electronic structures and their photophysical properties. When these polymers were utilized as the donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs), the influence of side chains on the photovoltaic performance was investigated and all the polymers presented high open-circuit voltage above 1.0 V. PSCs with a blend of PBDTDTSi-1:PC71BM (1:4, by weight) as the active layer showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 3.29%, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V, a short-circuit current density of 7.53 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.41. Our research revealed that the variation of substituents on the dithienosilole moieties had a great influence on the morphology of blend films and charge carrier mobilities, which are crucial to the performance of PSCs.

Silicon containing aromatic compounds are attractive building blocks due to their unique electronic structures, which possess low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and relatively small band gaps due to the interaction between the silicon σ* orbital and the π* orbital of the butadiene moiety. Furthermore, the silicon atom stabilizes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and should enhance the ambient stability of silole-containing polymers with respect to O2 oxidation. Inspired by these properties, several research groups have developed silole-containing conjugated polymers or small molecular organic compounds as active materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Dithienosilole (DTSi) is a typical representative among these silicon-containing building blocks and three symmetrical DTSi isomers, namely, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTSi-1), dithieno[2,3-b:3′,2′-d]silole (DTSi-2) and dithieno[3,4-b:4′,3′-d]silole (DTSi-3) have been reported (Scheme 1). Up to now, most research studies on DTSi in the organic electronic field only focused on the symmetrical DTSi-1 and its derivatives. Very recently, our group developed an efficient synthesis of a novel asymmetrical 7,7-dimethyl-4,6-di(trimethylsilyl)-dithieno[2,3-b:3′,4′-d]silole (DTSi-4 in Chart 1), which may be utilized as an interesting building block for conjugated materials exploration. With the incorporation of the annulated silole ring at the two β positions of the thiophene ring, the silole unit could be introduced into the polymer chain as the lateral substituent.

Currently, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted more attention and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 10% has been achieved. In order to realize high photovoltaic performance, the intrinsic properties of conjugated polymers, including their absorption spectra, molecular energy levels, hole mobilities and morphologies, must be carefully tuned. It's crucial to design and explore novel electron donating materials, especially novel monomers for PSCs. As a typical π-conjugation unit, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) with a symmetrical and planar conjugated structure has been demonstrated to be one of the most excellent building blocks for the synthesis of organic functional materials and a tight stacking can be expected for the BDT-based conjugated polymers. When polymerized with thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) based monomers, a lot of quinoid polymers were synthesized. Among these BDT and TT containing polymers, PTB-7 is one of the outstanding representatives and has been widely used in device studies of PSCs. Additionally, Stefan et al. reported two BDT based donor–acceptor conjugated polymers, which possessed a deeper HOMO energy level, and a higher Voc of 1.04 V in PSCs was obtained. Considering the fascinating properties of the silole based materials and the excellent performances of BDT based polymers (e.g. PTB7), in this manuscript, three new DTSi based monomers with different electron withdrawing groups (nonanoyl group, octyl cyanoacetate or malononitrile) were prepared from the basic DTSi-4 unit. Our intention in this work is to prepare polymers possessing similar conjugated backbones to PTB polymers and introducing side annulated silole rings to the main chains; hopefully we can take advantage of the combined properties of BDT and our novel DTSi building blocks.
Benefiting from the silole rings, all of the three PBDTDTSi polymers exhibited good thermal stability and the 5% weight loss temperatures ranged from 371 °C to 440 °C. The synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical properties, along with the photovoltaic device performances of PBDTDTSi were described. Meanwhile, the UV-Vis behaviour of the polymers was also described by virtue of DFT calculations to further understand the origin of different absorption bands; and efficient charge transfer was observed for the optical transitions from the ground state to excited state. As in the PSC device fabrication, all of the PBDTDTSi polymers displayed high open circuit voltages (Voc) over 1 volt and PBDTDTSi-1 demonstrated a PCE of 3.29% with a Voc of 1.07 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.53 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.41. Considering the relatively large band gap of about 2.0 eV, these PBDTDTSi polymers may be promising large band gap materials for the fabrication of tandem solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that DTSi-4 based conjugated polymers were prepared and used as donor materials for PSCs. And a Voc of 1.07 V, which is the highest open-circuit voltage for DTSi based polymers up to now, was obtained.

The synthetic routes of all the monomers are shown in Scheme 1(a). Compound 1 is the basic building block for the synthesis of the DTSi monomers and it could be efficiently synthesized according to our previous report. Starting from compound 1, via deprotonation by LDA and quenching with DMF, the basic and crucial building block 2 was obtained in a yield of 85% as a yellow solid. When compound 2 was treated with n-octylmagnesium bromide at −78 °C in dry ethyl ether, the hydroxy intermediate 3 was generated in a high yield of 90% as a colorless solid. Then, compound 4 was prepared via the dehydration reaction of compound 3 with PCC as the oxidant in the presence of KOAc and dichloromethane. Finally, compound 4 was treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in a mixture of CHCl3 and HOAc to afford monomer M1 in a yield of 64%. Also from compound 2, via the bromination reaction by NBS, the dibromo precursor (5) could be efficiently synthesized in a yield of 77%. Then, monomer M2 could be afforded in a yield of 50% via Knoevenagel condensation of compound 5 and octyl cyanoacetate. As for M3, we have tried two different routes. In the first route, the Knoevenagel condensation between the dibromo compound 5 and malononitrile was carried out to afford the target compound M3 in a yield of 60%. While, in the other way, Knoevenagel condensation was firstly set up with compound 2 and malononitrile producing compound 6 in a high yield of 91%; followed by the bromination reaction of compound 6 to afford the monomer M3 in a yield of 70%. Meanwhile, M4 was prepared according to the literature. Finally, microwave-assisted Stille polymerization of DTSi monomers (M1, M2 or M3) and BDT monomer (M4) was carried out with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst precursor in a mixture of o-xylene/DMF (5:1) to afford polymers PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 as dark red solids in yields of about 85%.


The crystals of 6 and M2 were obtained via the slow evaporation of solutions in CHCl3–CH3OH (3:1, v/v). The structures of some DTSi compounds (6 and M2) were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis as shown in Fig. 1. They belong to the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c and triclinic space group P, respectively. From the side view in Fig. 1(b) and (d), it's obvious that the three fused aromatic rings of these two molecules are basically coplanar, indicating that a good conjugation could be obtained in the final materials synthesized from these DTSi building blocks.


All of the PBDTDTSi polymers displayed good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature. The molecular weights and polydispersity index (PDI) of these polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The polymers have the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 23.3, 14.3 and 11.5 kg mol−1 for PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3, with the PDI of 3.13, 2.95 and 3.25, respectively (in Table 1) and the diverse molecular weights may be caused by the solubility differences of polymers. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies revealed that all of these PBDTDTSi polymers were stable; PDBPTBT-1 and PBDTDTSi-3 presented a higher 5% weight loss temperature up to 440 °C (in Fig. 2 and Table 1) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. Glass transition temperatures of all the polymers were not observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating and cooling speed of 20 °C min−1.

The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three PBDTDTSi polymers in chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 3 and the details are listed in Table 2. Generally, all of the three polymers exhibited a similar absorption coverage ranging from 250 to 600 nm; slightly broader and red-shifted features were observed for all of the polymers in film absorption when compared with that of their solution. However, the absorption behaviour of PBDTDTSi-1 in both solution and film was greatly different from the other two polymers and it showed two clear absorption bands located around 500 nm (Band I) and 350 nm (Band II), respectively. As for PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3, they presented very similar absorption behaviour to each other in either solutions or thin films, and with the stronger electron withdrawing groups incorporated at the side chains, their photophysical properties changed greatly compared with PBDTDTSi-1. For example, their absorption band edges were red shifted about 20 nm and 40 nm relative to that of PBDTDTSi-1 in solution and films, respectively; but the maximal peak of the main bands at the long wavelength (Band I) of these two polymers were blue shifted about 70 nm when compared with PBDTDTSi-1. It's obvious that PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 shared a similar peak at 350 nm (Band II) with PBDTDTSi-1, which may be related to the mutual components of these polymers; while, the differences of the absorption peak at the long wavelength (Band I) should originate from the different intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) activities due to the different electron withdrawing properties of acceptor groups. In addition, enhanced shoulder peaks were observed for all the PBDTDTSi polymers in thin films, which is the typical behaviour of the polymer packing peak induced by molecular aggregation.

The electrochemical properties of PBDTDTSi polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. Ag/AgNO3 was used as the reference electrode and a standard ferrocene/ferrocenium redox system was used as the internal standard. The CV curves of PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 are shown in Fig. S36 and their HOMO energy levels are −5.54, −5.51 and −5.43 eV, respectively, which were calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) of these polymers according to the following equations:

EHOMO = −[Eox − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8] (eV)
(1)
ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg
(2)
Eg = 1240/λmax (eV)
(3)
The LUMO energy levels of PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 are −3.41, 3.45 and −3.40 eV, respectively, which are higher than that of PC71BM (−4.1 eV), guaranteeing the photo-induced electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, i.e. from polymers to PC71BM. The optical band gaps (Eg) of PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 were determined from the onset of absorption to be 2.13, 2.06 and 2.03 eV, respectively. For a clear comparison, the energy levels determined by the electrochemical method are shown in the energy level diagrams in Fig. 4. The CV results illustrated that these new polymers should be good candidates as donor materials and high Voc PSC devices may be obtained with such deep HOMO energy levels.

To obtain further insight into the effect of molecular structure and electron distribution on the spectroscopic properties of these polymers, their electronic structure and excited-state calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 suite by the TD-DFT/PCM approach at the 6-31G (d,p) level. The visualized HOMO and LUMO distributions and the calculated frontier orbital energies of the dimers are shown in Fig. 5. During the calculation, the dimers were optimized with the alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculations, which did not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries and the electronic properties. The electronic wave-functions of the HOMO were similar to each other (shown in Fig. 5), which were distributed almost entirely over the conjugated main chains; whereas after light irradiation, a different phenomenon was observed and it seems that the substituents on the DTSi moieties had a great influence on the LUMO energy levels (Fig. 5).

As for PBDTDTSi-1, the electron densities of both HOMO and LUMO were mainly localized on the conjugated main chains and only a small portion of the electron density of LUMO was distributed on the silole and thiophene rings at the side direction, indicating that the electron withdrawing ability of the nonanoyl group was weak and wouldn't disturb the electron mobility on the conjugated backbones. While it was so different in PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3, the electron density of LUMO flowed from the main chains to the side silole and thiophene rings due to the introduction of the stronger acceptors (octyl cyanoacetate or malononitrile). This different electron distribution of LUMO resulted in different calculated photophysical properties, which showed good agreement with the experimental UV-Vis absorption behavior as shown in Fig. 6 and provided us more details about their photophysical activities.
The predicted UV-Vis spectra are quite consistent with the experimental curves in Fig. 6(a)–(c) and the selected transition contributions are listed in Table 3. From the calculated results, it's clear that the absorption Band-I at the long wavelength of PDBTDTSi-1 is associated with the HOMO → LUMO and H−1 → LUMO transitions. Replacing the nonanoyl group with the stronger electron withdrawing groups (octyl cyanoacetate or malononitrile), Band-I of PDBTDTSi-2 is generated mainly by HOMO → L+2, HOMO → L+3 and H−4 → L+1; while for PDBTDTSi-3, it is related to the HOMO → L+2, H−4 → L+1 and H−5 → LUMO. These frontier orbitals and the energy diagrams are shown in Fig. 6(d)–(f), which clearly displayed the main contributions to the low-lying energy excitation (Band I) for these PDBTDTSi polymers. As for absorption Band II at the short wavelength, it's shared by all the three PDBTDTSi polymers and is associated with the mixed transitions from the higher energy excitations in TD-DFT predictions, which are listed in Table 3.

Hole mobility has a direct effect on the charge transport in PSCs. Higher mobility values are desired for better PCEs. So the hole mobilities of PBDTDTSi polymers were investigated in a typical device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:4, w/w, with 2% DIO)/Au via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mode. Dark J–V curves of the devices were fitted by using the Mott–Gurney equation: J = 9εoεrμV2/8d3, where J is the space charge limited current, εo is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the permittivity of the active layer, μ is the hole mobility, and d is the thickness of the active layer. According to the equation, the average hole mobilities of PBDTDTSi-1:PC71BM, PBDTDTSi-2:PC71BM and PBDTDTSi-3:PC71BM were evaluated to be 1.01 × 10−4, 2.50 × 10−6 and 1.95 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (shown in Table 3). Although these three polymers shared the same conjugated backbones, they presented different hole transport properties and the differences may be attributed to the variation of substituents on the dithienosilole moieties.


Photovoltaic properties of PBDTDTSi-1, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 were investigated in devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/TiOx/Al. The active layer is mainly a blend of the polymer and PC71BM. The ratio of the polymer to PC71BM, the concentration of the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive used in the active layer, and the influence of the interfacial layers in between the active layer and electrode were investigated to achieve the best photovoltaic performance (Tables S16 and S17). And the final optimized results are summarized in Table 4 and their J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7(a). For all of the three PBDTDTSi polymers, the optimized ratio of the polymer to PC71BM is 1:4 (w/w), the concentration of the polymer is 5.0 mg mL−1, the concentration of DIO in DCB is 2% (in volume), and the spin-coating speed is 2000 rpm. A TiOx thin layer has been proved to be an effective optical spacer between the active layer and the top metal electrode that can redistribute the light intensity within the active layer, block the hole transportation back to the top electrode, shield against physical damage and chemical degradation of the active layer, and significantly increase the PCE of the photovoltaic devices. Herein, the TiOx buffer layer was also employed for PSC device optimization. Generally, the Voc of the PSC is largely dependent on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor polymer and the LUMO energy level of PCBM. Therefore, the measured high Voc of 1.00–1.07 V for PBDTDTSi devices is attributed to the lower lying HOMO energy level of these polymers (−5.43 to −5.54 eV). The theoretical Voc can be roughly calculated using the equation Voc = 1/e(|EdonorHOMO| − |EPCBMLUMO|) − 0.3 V regardless of other reasons that affect the Voc. The theoretical Voc for devices based on PBDTDTSi-1 to 3 are 1.14, 1.11 and 1.03 V, respectively, which present a similar trend to the measured values, since other factors such as the cathode, interface resistance, exciton nonradiative recombination, etc. also play important roles in determining the Voc of the resulting device.

Among these polymers, PBDTDTSi-1, which contains the nonanoyl group at the end of the DTSi monomer, exhibited the best PCE of 3.29% (Voc = 1.07 V, Jsc = 7.53 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.41). The photocurrent of the photovoltaic cells was recorded under monochromatic illumination and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these solar cells are shown in Fig. 7(b). All the devices were observed to have significant photo-to-current responses in the range from 350 to 700 nm and EQE values are between 40% and 50% from 350 to 600 nm for PBDTDTSi-1. With the introduction of the stronger electron withdrawing groups, PBDTDTSi-2 and PBDTDTSi-3 didn't present enhanced PCEs, but they still possessed high Voc above 1 V. Since the conjugated backbones, band gaps and the electronic properties of the three polymers are very close to each other, the better Jsc and overall device performance in PBDTDTSi-1 devices may benefit from the observed higher space charge limited current (SCLC) mobility.
In addition, the quantum calculation results of the frontier orbitals in Fig. 5 offered some other explanations from the view of the polymer structures. The incorporation of stronger acceptor moieties (cyanoacetate or malononitrile) at the side direction greatly influenced the electron distributions on the polymer backbones (Fig. 5b and c) and then affected their charge carrier mobility, resulting in different Jsc in PSC device characterization. Therefore, it is significantly important to select the appropriate electron withdrawing group at the side direction for polymer design in PSCs.

In PSCs, the morphology of blend films can largely affect the charge separation and transport; the surface morphology of the PBDTDTSi:PC71BM (1:4) blend films spin coated from CB solutions with 2% DIO as the additive was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode and the results are shown in Fig. 8. With various electron withdrawing groups incorporated into the same polymer backbones, the blend films showed different surface morphologies. Although there are some larger aggregated particles, small phase separation is clearly observed in the blend film of PBDTDTSi-1. The diameters of these small domains are in the range of 40–60 nm and the root-mean-square (RMS) value of PBDTDTSi-1:PC71BM is 2.21 nm. As for PBDTDTSi-2, no clear phase separation and only aggregated particles were observed with a RMS of 1.21 nm. However, the blend film of PBDTDTSi-3:PC71BM presented a quite smooth surface with a RMS of 0.50 nm. Phase separation and RMS of the blend films are rather important factors for achieving high performance organic photovoltaic devices and these AFM results are therefore quite consistent with the device performances mentioned above.


In conclusion, three novel DTSi based monomers were designed and efficiently synthesized with different electron withdrawing groups (nonanoyl group, octyl cyanoacetate or malononitrile); and a series of silicon containing conjugated polymers were prepared from these asymmetrical dithienosilole building blocks. By introducing the DTSi unit, the HOMO levels of the polymers were lowered and the PSCs showed noticeably high Voc of above 1.0 V. These polymers exhibited good solubility in common solvents and good thermal stability. Meanwhile, the device made from PBDTDTSi-1 demonstrated the best PCE of 3.29% with a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 7.53 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.41. The differences in SCLC mobilities and morphology are probably the cause of the varied photovoltaic performances, which may be produced by the structural differences at the DTSi units. In all, this is the first example of the introduction of the silole units at the lateral directions of the conjugated backbones and DTSi has been proved to be a novel and interesting building block towards the design of conjugated polymers.
