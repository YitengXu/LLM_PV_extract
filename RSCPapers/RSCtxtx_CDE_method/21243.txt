A new heterocyclic aromatic structure, thieno[3,2-c]quinolin-4(5H)-one (TQO), was designed and synthesized as an electron-accepting building block for donor–acceptor-type copolymers. TQO was copolymerized with 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) to give PBDT-TQO. Thieno[3,2-c]isoquinolin-5(4H)-one (TIQO), an isomeric structure of TQO, was also synthesized to give PBDT-TIQO. The absorption regions of both polymers cover 300–600 nm, complementary to those of well-known non-fullerene acceptors (ITIC or IT-4F). PBDT-TQO exhibited a slightly wider bandgap and a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level than PBDT-TIQO, owing to the different intra-molecular charge transfer characteristics. Photovoltaic devices fabricated using PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO donors with a fullerene acceptor (PC71BM) showed the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.02 and 3.92%, respectively, while those using the non-fullerene acceptors (ITIC or IT-4F) showed much higher PCEs. The device using PBDT-TQO:IT-4F showed the highest PCE of 7.62%, with a short-circuit current of 14.44 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.90 V, and a fill factor of 58.92%.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much interest because of their distinctive merits of low cost, flexibility, and suitability for the high-throughput roll-to-roll process compared with silicon-based inorganic solar cells. Semiconducting polymers or small molecules with diverse absorption ranges and frontier molecular orbital energy levels have been used as p-type electron donor materials in OSCs. On the other hand, fullerene derivatives, namely, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), have been widely utilized as n-type electron acceptors due to their strong electron affinity and good electron-transporting characterstic. Due to the narrow absorption of these fullerene-based electron acceptors, low bandgap donor polymers have been mainly synthesized and characterized to cover the narrow absorption region. Recently, two of the low bandgap donor polymers (PffBT4T2OD and PffNT4T2OD) achieved PCEs over 11% when blended with PC71BM.

Wide bandgap polymers have attracted less attention than low bandgap donor polymers due to their relatively low PCEs when they were fabricated to OSCs with fullerene-based acceptors. The absorption region of wide bandgap polymer donors overlap with that of the fullerene-based acceptors consequently, OSCs fabricated using wide bandgap polymer donors and fullerene-based acceptors have limited absorption ranges. More recently, OSCs fabricated using non-fullerene acceptors have shown remarkably improved performance, because of their broad absorption range from visible to near infrared, and good miscibility with the donor polymers. Therefore, to utilize the high performance of some recent low bandgap non-fullerene acceptors, new wide bandgap donor polymers with complimentary absorption should be designed and synthesized.
So far, weak electron accepting groups including benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD), benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole, and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione derivatives, and aromatic lactam structures have been used to synthesize wide or medium bandgap polymer donors. Among them, the polyaromatic lactam structures demonstrated great potential as electron accepting building blocks for wide bandgap polymers, due to their weak electron withdrawing ability, good planarity, and facile control of frontier orbital energy levels. The Ding group reported the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of polymer donors containing thieno[3,2-c]isoquinolin-5(4H)-one (TIQO). The fabricated OSC devices using the donor polymers consisting of TIQO and DTBT and fullerene acceptor showed a high PCE of 10.16%.
In this work, we designed and synthesized thieno[3,2-c]quinolin-4(5H)-one (TQO), which has an asymmetric architecture with solubilizing group, as a new weak electron accepting building block for polymer donors (Fig. 1). Stille-cross coupling polymerization was used to synthesize the donor–acceptor (D–A)-type copolymer consisting of TQO and 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), namely poly(7-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)thieno[3,2-c]quinolin-4(5H)-one) (PBDT-TQO). The TIQO-containing analogue polymer, poly(7-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-4-(2-hexyldecyl)thieno[3,2-c]isoquinolin-5(4H)-one) (PBDT-TIQO), was also synthesized for comparison. The overall synthetic routes of the monomers and the desired polymer donors are shown in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively.

The ring closure step for forming the lactam structure was carried out successfully through an intermolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction with high yields. The synthesized TQO or TIQO was polymerized with BDT via Stille cross-coupling polymerization to give PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO, respectively. The synthesized polymers showed good solubility in common chlorinated organic solvents. Their molecular weights were measured by gel permeation chromatography using chlorobenzene as an eluent at 40 °C and calibrated by polystyrene as a standard. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) was 19000 g mol−1 for PBDT-TQO with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 5.49, and 23000 g mol−1 with PDI of 4.04 for PBDT-TIQO. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the polymers were conducted to investigate their thermal properties. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td, at 5% weight loss) was 396.0 and 372.8 °C for PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO, respectively. No significant enthalpy changes were observed in the DSC thermograms between 30 and 300 °C (Fig. S23–S26, ESI).


The DFT-based calculations were performed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set to obtain the structural geometries, dihedral angles, frontier orbital energy levels, and the charge distributions along the conjugated backbone of both TQO and TIQO (Fig. 1(a and b)) as well as their dimeric models (BDT-TQO-BDT-TQO and BDT-TIQO-BDT-TIQO, Fig. S27, ESI). As expected, both TQO and TIQO models exhibited a higher degree of planarity with weak accepting characteristics. The calculated highest molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for TQO and TIQO models were −5.77/−1.48 eV and −5.54/−1.25 eV, respectively. In particular, TQO model showed lower-lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels than those of TIQO, indicating that TQO is much weak accepting building block than TIQO, leading to wide bandgap polymer with deep frontier molecular orbital energy levels. Moreover, the calculated HOMO energy levels of dimeric models were −5.07 and −4.89 eV for BDT-TQO-BDT-TQO and BDT-TIQO-BDT-TIQO, respectively, which displayed similar trends to the DFT results of TQO and TIQO models.


The UV-visible absorption spectra of PBDT-TQO, PBDT-TIQO, fullerene-, and non-fullerene acceptors in the films are displayed in Fig. 2(a). The two newly synthesized polymers showed absorption below 600 nm with two main peaks. The main absorption peaks for PBDT-TQO in the film state are located at 491 and 530 nm, while the film of PBDT-TIQO exhibited slightly red-shifted absorption profile with distinct peaks of 513 and 553 nm compared to that of PBDT-TQO. The PBDT-TQO film showed a slightly higher absorption coefficient (8.8 × 10−4 cm−1 at 537 nm) than that of PBDT-TIQO (7.5 × 10−4 cm−1 at 555 nm), as shown in Fig. S28 (ESI). The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of synthesized polymers were estimated by the absorption edge of the polymer film to be 2.20 and 2.05 eV for PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO, respectively. These differences would come from the stronger intramolecular charge transfer character of the TIQO unit than TQO. Therefore, PBDT-TIQO has a smaller bandgap than PBDT-TQO, while the latter could have a relatively wider bandgap with the deeper HOMO energy level. These results are well consistent with the DFT calculation data. The absorption ranges of both polymers are complementary to those of well-known non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC or IT-4F, while largely overlapping with that of PC71BM.

Cyclic voltammetry was performed to evaluate the electronic energy levels of two polymers (Fig. S29, ESI). The HOMO energy levels of PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO were determined from the first oxidation potential (Eox) of their thin films to be −5.49 and −5.40 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the synthesized polymers were estimated from their HOMO energy levels and Eoptg. These energy levels for both the polymers and non-fullerene acceptors are well matched for efficient hole and electron extraction. The optical and electrochemical characteristics of PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO are provided in Table 1.

The photovoltaic properties of fullerene and non-fullerene OSC devices on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) were estimated using the inverted device architecture of indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer:fullerene (PC71BM) or non-fullerene (ITIC or IT-4F)/MoO3/Ag. The device fabrication conditions were optimized by commonly used methods, such as adjusting the donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio, adding a processing additive solvent, changing the thickness of the active layer, and pre-annealing process. Details about the optimization processes and the photovoltaic parameters are provided in the ESI (Fig. S30–S33 and Tables S1–S4). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices fabricated using polymers with fullerene acceptors are shown in Fig. 3, and photovoltaic parameters of the optimized OSC devices are summarized in Table 2. The best device performances were found for the D/A blend ratio of 1.0:2.0 in chlorobenzene (CB) with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a processing additive solvent. The devices fabricated using the fullerene acceptor without DIO showed the maximum PCEs of 1.35% and 2.34% for PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO, respectively. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of these devices are relatively high (0.89 V for PBDT-TQO and 0.84 V for PBDT-TIQO) because of the deep-lying HOMO energy levels of the two polymers. However, the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) were poor for both devices, while they were slightly increased after adding DIO additive, and the PCE reached up to 3.02% and 3.92%, respectively. The poor device performances are mainly attributed to the low Jsc value of the devices, and this could originate from the narrow absorption ranges of the active layers composed of the polymers and PC71BM. Photovoltaic devices using polymers with non-fullerene acceptors (ITIC and IT-4F) were also fabricated. The D/A ratio of the optimized device was 1.0:0.7 in CB, as shown in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI).

To further improve the device performances, the active layers were thermally annealed in the range of 100–180 °C for 10 min before electrode deposition. The optimum pre-annealing condition was found to be 160 °C for 10 min. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of the devices fabricated using polymers with non-fullerene acceptors are shown in Fig. 4, and performances of the optimized devices are provided in Table 2. The overall photovoltaic performances of the non-fullerene devices were much improved compared with the corresponding fullerene devices, especially in Voc and Jsc. The PBDT-TQO:ITIC device showed significantly high Voc up to 1.04 V due to the higher LUMO energy level of ITIC than PC71BM. The maximum PCE of PBDT-TQO:ITIC was 5.16% with Jsc of 9.32 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.04%. On the other hand, the Voc of fabricated PBDT-TQO:IT-4F device was slightly lower (0.90 V) than that of PBDT-TQO:ITIC device, because of the relatively low-lying LUMO energy level of IT-4F. Despite the lower Voc, the PBDT-TQO:IT-4F device showed higher PCE (7.62%) than PBDT-TQO:ITIC, possibly due to the higher absorption coefficient and broader absorption region of IT-4F than ITIC. Photovoltaic devices with PBDT-TIQO and the same non-fullerene acceptors were also fabricated. The Voc of PBDT-TIQO:ITIC device (0.95 V) was slightly decreased compared to the corresponding PBDT-TQO device due to the higher HOMO energy level of PBDT-TIQO, while it showed a much higher Jsc than that of PBDT-TQO:ITIC device. The PBDT-TIQO:ITIC device showed the maximum PCE of 6.56% with Jsc of 13.33 mA cm−2 and FF of 51.67%. In the PBDT-TIQO:IT-4F device, Voc was decreased similar to the PBDT-TQO:IT-4F device, but the Jsc was not significantly improved. The fabricated PBDT-TQO:IT-4F device exhibited a maximum PCE of 5.97% with Jsc of 14.72 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V, and FF of 50.31%. The devices fabricated using the non-fullerene acceptors responded to a broader range of the solar spectrum up to 800 nm (Fig. 4(b)) than those of the corresponding PC71BM devices (Fig. 3(b)), leading to significantly improved Jsc in the former.
The charge carrier mobility of the OSC device was measured by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to investigate the impact on the JSC and FF (as shown in Fig. S34, ESI). The measured hole mobilities (μh) of both OSCs exhibited similar values (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas PBDT-TQO:IT-4F showed the highest electron mobilities (μe) of 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. High charge carrier mobility can effectively transport of the generated hole and electron to each electrodes while competes with the charge recombination. Thus, PBDT-TQO:IT-4F devices showed high Jsc due to high charge carrier mobilities and well-balanced μh and μe (μh/μe) to 1.40 which was able to minimize the generated charge recombination, resulting in high FF. On the other hand, the lowest μe (3.00 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was detected in PBDT-TIQO:IT-4F device and led to poor μh/μe balance (6.70), resulting in low FF (50.31%).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were used to further analyze the morphology of the blended or neat polymer films. Pronounced PC71BM aggregates with large domains (300–500 nm) were observed in the blended polymer:PC71BM films without added DIO, as shown in Fig. 5(a and e). The isolated aggregates have unfavorable effects on the exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport, resulting in lower mobility, FF, and PCEs. After adding the DIO, noticeable changes were observed, namely the formation of uniform and bi-continuous surface between the polymers and PC71BM, a smaller domain size, and smoother surface compared to the blended films without DIO. In contrast, both blended polymer:non-fullerene films exhibited homogeneous morphologies with no distinct phase separation. Among the non-fullerene blended films, PBDT-TQO:IT-4F and PBDT-TIQO:ITIC exhibited nano-sized fiber-like aggregates.

2D-GIWAXS images (Fig. 6) and the in-plane (IP)/out-of-plane (OOP) line cut profiles (Fig. S34, ESI) were used to characterize the structure order of the neat and blended polymer films. PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO exhibited mainly face-on orientation with lamellar and π–π stacking diffraction peaks, which were located at 0.29 and 1.65 Å−1 and corresponded to a distance of 21.67 and 3.81 Å in the IP and OOP directions, respectively. For the polymer:PC71BM blended films, the strong π–π stacking diffraction peaks in the OOP direction for the neat polymer films disappeared, suggesting that the orientation was changed from face-on to amorphous. On the contrary, the blended films of polymer:non-fullerene maintained the face-on orientation, with π–π stacking diffraction peaks along the OOP direction located at 1.69 and 1.70 Å−1 for PBDT-TQO:non-fullerene and PBDT-TIQO:non-fullerene (corresponding to the stacking distances of 3.72 and 3.70 Å, respectively).

In conclusion, a new heteroaromatic lactam structure, thieno[3,2-c]quinolin-4(5H)-one (TQO), was designed and synthesized as an electron-accepting building block for D–A-type copolymers. PBDT-TQO showed a wider bandgap and a deeper HOMO energy level than PBDT-TIQO as the isomeric polymer donor. The synthesized PBDT-TQO and PBDT-TIQO have absorption regions that are complementary to the well-known non-fullerene acceptors like ITIC or IT-4F. Photovoltaic devices fabricated using the synthesized polymers with non-fullerene acceptors showed much improved Jsc and PCEs compared with those using the corresponding fullerene acceptor, due to their broader absorption of the solar spectrum. The photovoltaic device using the combination of PBDT-TQO and IT-4F showed the best performances among the fabricated devices. This novel lactam building block would be a good candidate electron-accepting unit for D–A copolymers in high-performance OSCs.
