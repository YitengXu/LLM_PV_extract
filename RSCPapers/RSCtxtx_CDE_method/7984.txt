The role of hetero-atom manipulation/hetero-aryl group insertion in the triarylamine to obtain hetero triarylamine as a donor in highly efficient photosensitizers was investigated to study the structure–efficiency relationship in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A newly synthesized sensitizer was explored containing N-phenyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl) pyridine-2-amine (DPPA) and N-(pyridin-2-yl)-N-(thiophen-2-yl) pyridine-2-amine (DPTA) as the donor along with a strong electron-withdrawing cyano group (–CN) as the auxiliary acceptor group and cyanoacetic acid and rhodamine-3-acetic acid as anchoring groups. The triphenylamine donor was manipulated for the first time with the insertion of a nitrogen atom in the aryl ring for DSSCs. These hetero-aryl-based sensitizers showed a significant improvement in the photophysical as well as photovoltaic performance. The replacement of cyanoacetic acid by rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an anchoring unit resulted in a significant red-shift in absorption as well as emission maxima. The methylene group in rhodanine-3-acetic acid interrupted the LUMO delocalization on the anchoring group in sensitizers DP3 and DP4, as shown by DFT calculations. The presence of cyanoacetic acid in sensitizers DP1 and DP2 showed effective charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO and efficient electron injection from LUMO to the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor. The sensitizer DP2 showed a maximum efficiency of 4.7%, a short-circuit current Jsc = 11.78 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage Voc = 0.608 V and a fill factor FF = 0.62. The enhanced efficiency of sensitizer DP2 was attributed to the presence of the strong electron-withdrawing cyanoacetic acid anchoring group and the presence of the thiophene linker at the N-aryl core.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained significant importance in the past two decades due to the world demand for clean, renewable, environmentally friendly and freely available energy sources. Grätzel and co-workers in 1991 reported the first dye-sensitized solar cell based on a ruthenium complex and since then, DSSCs research has gained a revolutionary momentum. Several metal-based sensitizers have been synthesized in recent years and they have shown remarkable light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies. However, tedious synthetic protocol, high metal cost and environmental burden restricts their commercial exploration. Therefore, metal-free sensitizers are preferred in place of organometallic compounds. The metal-free organic sensitizers have an advantage due to their easy synthesis and purification process, economic desirability, high molar extinction coefficient and ease in optimizing their photophysical properties by structural modification. The efficient metal-free organic sensitizers have a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure, where the modification of every part plays a significant role in altering the photovoltaic performance. The photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties can be fine-tuned by changing the donor part, the π-linker or the acceptor. The different types of donating groups used in D–π–A type sensitizers include coumarin, merocyanine, cyanine, indole, triphenylamine, thiophene, carbazole, phenothiazine, julolidine and phenoxazine. These donor units are attached to the acceptor units using various π-linkers, which show moderate to high efficiencies. Among these donors, triphenyl amine-based sensitizers have shown improved performance over the years. Various strategies have been employed to boost the donating capacities of triphenyl amine by utilizing a two donor (D–D 2D), two donor–pi system attached to new donor {(D–π)2-D}, donor–pi–donor (D–π–D), auxiliary donor systems. The utilization of a pyridine-based triphenyl amine-based donor remains unexplored in DSSCs. In this paper, we are report four novel molecules (DP1–DP4) based on N-phenyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl) pyridine-2-amine (DPPA) and N-(pyridin-2-yl)-N-(thiophen-2-yl) pyridine-2-amine (DPTA) as the donor group for their potential application in DSSCs (Scheme 1). We used phenyl and thiophene as a pi-linker and cyano acetic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as the acceptor. The thiophene π-linker has shown better performance over the phenyl group as it has less delocalization of the electron cloud over the ring and its electron density is available for charge transfer, which shows desirable polarizability, and tuneable electrochemical and spectroscopic properties. It also plays a significant role in electron conduction and affects the absorption and emission maxima of the sensitizers.DP1 and DP2 were compared with their reported analogues to establish the impact of donor manipulation on the photophysical and photovoltaic properties.



Schemes 2 and 3 explain the synthetic approach for the four sensitizers: DP1–DP4. Compound 1 was synthesized by the nucleophilic substitution reaction of 2-amino pyridine with 2-bromo pyridine. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between compound 1 and 4-bromo benzaldehyde and 5-bromo-thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde gave 2a and 2b, respectively. The condensation of intermediates 2a and 2b with thiophene acetonitrile gave intermediates 3a and 3b, while the Rieche formylation of 3a and 3b gave intermediates 4a and 4b. The Knoevenagel condensation of intermediates 4a and 4b with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine resulted in the sensitizer DP1 (72% yield) and DP2 (76% yield) and with rhodamine-3-acetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate resulted in the sensitizer DP3 (81% yield) and DP4 (84% yield) as the final products.


The UV-visible spectra of DP1–DP4 were recorded in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) (2 × 10−6 M) and the corresponding spectra are replicated in Fig. 1(a). The absorption maxima and molar extinction coefficient data in DMF for all the sensitizers are given in Table 1. The sensitizers DP1 and DP2 show two absorption peaks in DMF. The first weak absorption peak lies in the range of 330–360 nm due to aromatic π–π* electron transition, while the second broad peak in the range of 370–600 nm is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from DPPA and the DPTA donor group to the cyanoacetic acid acceptor group via the thiophene π-bridge. Similarly DP3 and DP4 also show two absorption peaks in the range of 310–650 nm.

The first absorption peak near 395 nm is very prominent and occurs due to aromatic π–π* electronic transition, while the second broad peak lies in the range of 430 to 650 nm and is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from DPPA and the DPTA (donor group) to rhodanine-3-acetic acid (acceptor group) via thiophene π-bridge. The sensitizers DP1 and DP3 have same donor group and thiophene π-bridge but DP3 shows red-shifted absorption maxima. This red-shift in absorption maxima is due to the manipulation of the rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group as compared with DP1 having cyanoacrylic acid group. The red-shift in DP3 in comparison with DP1 suggest that rhodanine-3-acetic acid group has a better electron-withdrawing capacity in comparison with cyanoacrylic acid group, which lowers the LUMO level of the dye, thus reducing the band gap. This was further proved by the cyclic voltammetry data and DFT calculations. A similar trend was observed between DP2 and DP4, having the same donor group and thiophene π-bridge. DP4 has the highest absorbance maxima value at 534 nm, which is due to the presence of the thiophene π-bridge with the strong electron-withdrawing cyano (CN) group, which acts as an electron trap and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an anchoring group. The sensitizer DP2 has a comparatively high molar extinction coefficient value due to the presence of the thiophene ring with the CN group (acts as an electron trap) in the π-bridge and the universal famous anchoring group cyanoacetic acid, which suggests a good light-harvesting capacity. The molar extinction coefficients values of DP1, DP2, DP3 and DP4 was found to be 63479, 72512, 54562 and 58313 M−1 cm−1 respectively. The same trend was observed when we measured the UV-visible reflectance spectra of the dye-loaded TiO2 films (Fig. 1(b)). Here, the observed broadening of the spectra was compared with the spectra recorded in the solvent along with the red-shift in the absorbance, which confirmed the anchoring of the sensitizers on the nanocrystalline porous titania. DP3 and DP4 show absorption red-shifts of 70 nm and 65 nm, respectively, and a large broadening of the spectra, which indicates a poor charge transfer due to the presence of rhodanine-3-acetic acid as the anchoring group. Whereas, DP1 and DP2 show a lower broadening of the spectra and large absorption red-shifts of 82 nm and 81 nm for DP1 and DP2, respectively. This higher absorption red-shifts indicate good charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor due to the presence of cyanoacrylic acid as a strong acceptor and the same is responsible for the higher absorbance coefficient profile of DP1 and DP2 on the TiO2 surface.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2a) was used for investigation of the electrochemical properties of these four sensitizers to obtain the HOMO and LUMO energy level positions of the sensitizers (Table 1). Under the application of a positive potential, CV showed two quasi-reversible oxidation waves, which corresponded to the oxidation–reduction process. These two peaks were observed at 0.85 V and 1.25 V for DP2versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) and were attributed to the oxidation of the π-conjugated backbone and donor, respectively.

The well-defined first oxidation peak for DP2 compared to DP1 confirmed the better charge transformation between donor (D) and acceptor (A) in the case of the DPTA donor as compared to the DPPA donor. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these four sensitizers were determined by DFT calculation B3LYP/6-31G(d) as well as CV data, which are summarized in Table 1.
The HOMO energy levels of DP1, DP2, DP3 and DP4 was found to be 0.87, 1.14, 1.02 and 1.07 V vs. the NHE (normal hydrogen electrode), respectively. These values were larger than the redox potential of I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. the NHE) of the electrolyte. This ensured a facile regeneration of the sensitizer by the I−/I3− electrolyte after electron injection. The LUMO energy levels of DP1, DP2, DP3 and DP4 was found to be −1.60, −1.03, −1.24 and −0.88 V vs. NHE, respectively. The LUMO energy level of the DP sensitizers was higher than the conduction band of TiO2 (0.5 V vs. NHE), which indicated the feasibility of smooth electron injection on TiO2 upon photo-excitation.

The geometries of the sensitizers at their ground state were optimized by using the DFT global hydride B3LYP functional with 6-31G(d) basis set was used for all the atoms. B3LYP is a combination of Becke's three parameter exchange functional (B3) with the nonlocal correlation functional by Lee, Yang and Parr (LYP). The first excited singlet states were optimized using the TD-DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set. Frequency computations were also carried out on the optimized geometry of the low-lying vibronically relaxed first excited state of the molecules. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) was used for optimization in a solvent (DMF). The Gaussian 09 program was used for the DFT and TD-DFT computations. Generally, for molecules that have both n–π* and π–π* states (D–π–A system), global hybrids, such as B3LYP, will provide an accurate estimate and hence we preferred to use the TD-DFT B3LYP method to perform the calculations.

The frontier molecular orbital diagram (FMO) of all the sensitizers are shown in Fig. 3, which shows that the electron density was uniformly distributed on the donor group in the HOMO. Upon excitation, the electron cloud shifted towards the anchoring group at the LUMO level, resulting in the more effective intramolecular charge separation was observed in sensitizers DP1 and DP2 as compared to with DP3 and DP4. The charge delocalization from the donor to the acceptor upon excitation encouraged the effective injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 through the carboxyl anchoring group. The electronic distribution of HOMO and LUMO of all sensitizers at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and their corresponding energy gap are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI). It can be seen that the HOMO–LUMO energy gap is high in DP1 as compared with the other sensitizers, and in the case of DP4, it is low compared with other sensitizers and the same results were obtained from the CV data. The optimized geometries of all four sensitizers at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.
The calculated electronic vertical transition energy, oscillator strengths (f), maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) and nature of the transitions in various states are collected in Table 1. Table 1 show that, the strongest absorption peaks for all the dyes mainly related to the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO. Moreover, one can find that the maximum absorption wavelength of DP2 to DP4 is remarkably red-shifted in DMF solution compared to DP1 and DP3, and increases in the order DP1 < DP3 < DP2 < DP4. At the same time, the extent of the red-shift of DP3 and DP4 is larger, which can be explained by the difference in electronegativity for sulphur (S) atoms and the better electron delocalization allowed by the sulphur atom in relation to the other atoms. However, the red-shift in sensitizers DP2 and DP4 as compared with DP1 and DP3 is due to the thiophene (S) ring present in DP2 and DP4. All the sensitizers with a D–A′–π–A configuration could be better as compared to the D–π–A structure. As a result, the calculated spectral data confirmed that the introduction of the additional acceptor in the D–A′–π–A system could be favourable for the long wavelength light-harvesting, and could be beneficial for an enhanced photo-to-electric conversion efficiency of related solar cells, as compared to D–π–A systems.
The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) is one of the most significant parameters related to the intensity of the absorption spectra of the sensitizer and is calculated using the following eqn (1),
LHE = 1 − 10−f,
(1)
where
f is the oscillator strength of the sensitizers. For an efficient photocurrent conversion, the value LHE of the sensitizers should be high. The LHE values were calculated for various bands of all the sensitizers and are shown in Table S2 (ESI). The LHE of the sensitizers increases with an increase in the red-shift, as observed in the Table S2 (ESI). The maximum value of LHE of around 0.984 by TD-B3LYP is observed for DP4. Generally, all the sensitizers show a LHE nearer to unity, notably DP2 showed more power conversion efficiency compared to other sensitizers.



Fig. 4a shows the current (I)–voltage (V) characteristics of DSSCs fabricated with these dyes (DP1 to DP4) as sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions at 1 Sun illumination, whereas Fig. 4b shows the I–V characteristics in dark conditions, which confirms the absence of dark reactions as all the devices give zero current density. The detailed parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2.

The short-circuit current Jsc is correlated with the molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of the sensitizers, hence the sensitizers with higher εmax yielded the higher short-circuit current. The εmax of DP2 was highest among all the other DP series, hence showing the highest Jsc = 11.78 mA cm−2. The low Voc = 0.608 V of DP2 in comparison with DP1 was attributed to the low LUMO level with respect to DP1. The trend in the photon light-to-current conversion efficiency was observed in the order DP3 < DP4 < DP1 < DP2. DP2 showed the highest light-to-current conversion efficiency at 4.7% (Table 2). DP1 showed the second highest photocurrent efficiency of 3.5% and highest Voc of 0.624 V, owing to the lowest λmax value, but it had beneficial properties like DP2. The lower performance of DP3 and DP4 originated from the lower molar extinction coefficient and the week acceptor/anchoring group rhodanine-3-acetic acid, due to this the decrement in Jsc value reflected in the device performance. Individually, between DP2 and DP1, keeping similar anchoring groups and changing the donor portion from a phenyl to a thiophene group, provides the hike in terms of increasing the molar absorption coefficient and λmax absorbance, which make DP2 more efficient in terms of photovoltaic performance. A similar trend was observed in the DP3 and DP4 sensitizers. Correlating DP2 and DP4, the effect of the different anchoring groups revealed the performance difference between the different capacity of charge injection into TiO2 in Jsc as well as the Voc values. The DP3-based DSSC showed a Jsc of 4.11 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.589 V and a fill factor of 0.59. Visible differences in the Voc parameters between DP1/DP2 to DP3/DP4 were related to a negative shifting of the TiO2 conduction band after anchoring the sensitizer, where the strong cyanoacrylic acid group led to a more negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band and resulted in a higher Voc compared to rhodanine-3-acetic acid. The photocurrent characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs were estimated from the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values measured under short-circuiting against the wavelength.
All the sensitizers showed high fill factors (FF) between 59% and 66%. Fig. S2 (ESI) represents the IPCE spectra of the fabricated DSSCs exhibiting the highest values of ∼80–82% for DP2 and the other sensitizers, showing a broad plateau in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. The trend in IPCE spectra of the fabricated DSSCs was observed to be in the order DP3 < DP4 < DP1 < DP2. This ensures a saturated light absorption by all the sensitizers DP1, DP2, DP3 and DP4, which is in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra. It was important to note that DP2 showed a higher value of photon-to-current conversion efficiency, higher IPCE spectra value, higher molar extinction coefficient and higher Jsc value.

To get a better understanding of the power conversion of DSSC devices based on different sensitizers, we investigated the interfacial charge transfer process within DSSCs using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. As shown in Fig. 5 EIS showed two semicircles in the Nyquist plots for all the sensitizers.

The smaller (higher frequency from 103 to 105 Hz) and larger semicircles (lower frequency from 1 to 102 Hz) in the Nyquist plots were related to charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. Third arc, the slightly visible arc was related to iodide diffusion in the electrolyte, which was very moderate due to use of a liquid electrolyte. The first small arcs were almost similar in all the sensitizers, which was due to the use of the same counter electrode and electrolyte components. In the EIS measurement, the curves were fitted using an equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 5) and the obtained parameters are shown in Table 3. The recombination resistance of the DP2 device was higher than that of the other devices according to the value derived from curve fitting in Z-view software. The trend observed for the recombination resistance was DP3 < DP4 < DP1 < DP2.

DP3 and DP4 showed the lowest recombination resistance as compared to the other device. DP1 showed the second highest value of recombination resistance. The electron lifetime (τr) calculated for all the four devices was in the following order: DP2 (2.53 ms) > DP1 (1.86 ms) > DP4 (0.56 ms) > DP3 (0.27 ms). Here, the higher electron lifetime τr indicates the lower recombination of an electron from TiO2 to the electrolyte and results in a higher Jsc value. Based on the said phenomenon, the trend was in good agreement with the variation tendency of Jsc observed in the J–V curves.
To support the phenomena observed from the EIS characteristics, the Tafel polarization technique is used to gain a better understanding of the recombination kinetics of the electrolytes and electrode components in solar cells (Fig. 6). Tafel analysis briefly describes the interfacial charge transfer of the electrolyte redox couple at the catalyst platinum electrode and the oxidation/reduction reaction exhibited at the semiconductor electrolyte interface, which can be understood with the help of the Buttler–Volmer equation. Here, the nature of the Tafel plots looked very similar, indicating the similar smooth catalytic reaction at the counter electrode and electrolyte interface. Tafel measurement data were fitted using corrview software and the exchange current density was estimated for all the devices.
The order of the exchange current density well supports the recombination resistance extracted from the EIS spectra, while they also proved the obtained I–V performance of the DSSC with these sensitizers.

All the chemicals and synthetic reagents required for synthesis were procured from S. D. Fine Chemicals. 3-Methoxy propionitrile (MNP), guanidinium thiocyanate (GSCN), 4-tert butyl pyridine (TBP), iodine and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and TCI chemicals. FTO substrates (7 Ω cm−2) and hot melt tape were purchased from Solaronix Inc., Switzerland. 0.25 mm silica gel 60 F254 percolated plates on alumina were used for monitoring the reaction progress, which was visualized with UV light. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on Agilent technology 500 MHz instrument by using TMS as an internal standard. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the compounds were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-25 spectrometer. The solid UV-visible reflectance of the dye-loaded TiO2 was performed using an Ocean optics spectrometer, analyzing with spectra suite software. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with an (CH instruments model 660E) electrochemical workstation with three standard electrochemical cells. Dye solutions prepared in acetonitrile and a platinum disc was used as the working electrode, Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference and Pt wire as the counter electrode. 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) dissolved in acetonitrile solvent was used as the supporting electrolyte. CV curves were calibrated by using ferrocene as the standard. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs were measured using a Keithly-2450 digital source meter controlled by a computer scan rate of 10 mV s−1. A solar simulator (PET 80AAA, USA) 300 W xenon lamp, connected with an AM 1.5G filter to serve as the light source, gave 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the test cell to remove ultraviolet and infrared radiation. While electrochemical and impedance measurements were carried out using a SOLARTRON electrochemical analyzer (Solartron 1287 + 1260). The impedance of the DSSC was measured by sweeping a low amplitude AC signal (10 mV), with the frequency ranging from 120 kHz to 0.1 Hz. During the measurement, the cells were held in the dark under the application of −0.70 V DC bias. Tafel polarization curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from −0.7 to 0.7 to the DSSC in the dark and the resulting data were fitted using the Buttler–Volmer equation.

DSSCs were fabricated as per our previously reported method using a sandwich-type configuration of a photoelectrode and counter electrode. The FTO-coated glass substrate was cleaned with the soap solution, water, and ethanol, followed by 10 min sonication in every step. Using this cleaned substrate, the photoelectrode was made from a commercial TiO2 nanocrystalline semiconductor (P25, Sigma-Aldrich). A thin film of the TiO2 particles was deposited through screen printing from a TiO2 paste containing ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol. The electrodes were calcined in a tubular furnace at 450 °C for 25 min and then soaked in the 10 mM dye solution. Dye soaking of the photoelectrode was carried out in a glove box filled with nitrogen under very low light levels for 24 h. Counter electrodes were fabricated by spin coating a 50 mM H2PtCl6 solution in isopropanol onto a pre-drilled FTO substrate, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 15 min. The dye-coated photoelectrode and Pt counter electrode were sealed together using hot melt sealing tape upon the application of heat. The electrolyte solution comprising the 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, 0.5 M GSCN in 3-methoxy propionitrile, was inserted through the pre-drilled holes onto the counter electrode. The holes were sealed using epoxy adhesive and cover glass. The DSSCs were stored in the dark at room temperature for 12 h prior to the measurements. The active area of the DSSCs was set to 0.16 cm2 and was maintained constant using the same screen for coating. The thickness of the TiO2 nanocrystalline layer was 12 μm.


Manipulation of the novel metal-free organic sensitizers DP1, DP2, DP3 and DP4 having N-phenyl-N-(pyridin-2-yl) pyridine-2-amine (DPPA) and N-(pyridin-2-yl)-N-(thiophen-2-yl) pyridine-2-amine (DPTA) groups acting as the electron donor. All the sensitizers had thiophene acetonitrile π-conjugation systems, which were attached to cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as the anchoring groups. Their structural, electrochemical and optical properties were assessed, and device fabrication studies were carried out to evaluate the manipulation effect. It is important to note that the absorption maximum values were red-shifted in the order DP1 < DP3 < DP2 < DP4. The thiophene acetonitrile linker was present in all the above sensitizers, but DP4 had higher absorption maxima due to the presence of the DPTA donor group and rhodamine-3-acetic acid. The sensitizer (DP2) comprising a DPTA donor group with thiophene acetonitrile as a π-spacer and cyanoacetic acid as an acceptor group showed good efficiency as compared with the other sensitizers having the same or different donors with the same or different acceptor, like rhodanine-3-acetic acid. The significant trend in molar extinction coefficients was observed in the order DP3 < DP4 < DP1 < DP2, where the sensitizer DP2 had a higher value of molar extinction coefficient than the other sensitizers due to the DPTA donor group and cyanoacetic acid anchoring group. It was concluded that DP2 was a superior sensitizer for photovoltaic performance than the other DP sensitizers.
