A carbon black–silicon nitride (CB–Si3N4) nanocomposite is prepared as a cost-effective counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The CB–Si3N4 nanocomposite is coated on an FTO substrate via the screen printing method. The results demonstrate that when the thickness is fixed at 4.7 μm the CB–Si3N4 composite CE exhibits lower charge transfer resistance and higher electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of tri-iodide over the CB and Si3N4 electrodes. The CB–Si3N4-3% CE achieves the best catalytic activity and the prepared DSSC shows a power conversion efficiency of 8.06%. As the thickness of the CB–Si3N4-3% CE increases, the electrocatalytic ability is enhanced, and the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/CE interface decreases. The overall performance of the CB–Si3N4-3% CE with a thickness of 14.1 μm is comparable to that of Pt-doped CEs. Furthermore, a DSSC equipped with CB–Si3N4-3% CEs of 14.1 μm thickness exhibits a high efficiency of 8.37%, which is comparable to that of the Pt-based DSSC (8.50%). The simple preparation technique, outstanding electrocatalytic activity, and low cost of production allow the CB–Si3N4 nanocomposite to be a promising and efficient CE for DSSCs.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have drawn great attention as promising alternatives to the traditional silicon solar cells because of their low cost, flexibility, relatively high conversion efficiency and simple manufacturing processes. A standard DSSC is composed of mesoporous TiO2 loaded with dye as the photoanode, a liquid electrolyte usually with an iodide/tri-iodide redox couple and Pt deposited FTO as the counter electrode (CE). A key role of the CE, besides its essential role in catalyzing the reduction of redox mediator (I3−/I−) which is required for the regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules, is to gather electrons from the external wires. Pt is the conventional CE in DSSCs due to its remarkable catalytic activity toward the reduction of tri-iodide. However, its high cost, scarcity and poor corrosion resistance in the presence of an iodide electrolyte to form PtI4 and H2PtI6, seriously affects the overall efficiency of the device toward large scale application. Therefore, a lot of work has been devoted to replacing Pt based CEs with cheaper, highly abundant and chemically stable alternatives. Materials such as conducting polymers, metal–organic frameworks, transition metal compounds and their composites, and carbon based materials have been utilized as promising alternative CEs in DSSCs due to their high abundance and low cost, high conductivity and high corrosion resistance, especially in the presence of an iodide based liquid electrolyte. CB has received great attention as a promising candidate for DSSC counter electrodes, in particular because of its low crystallinity, large surface area, and electrical conductivity. However, the overall performance of the DSSCs based on CB CEs is still low and comparable to Pt based cells, which is due to its low catalytic activity. To overcome this issue a great amount of effort has been made in incorporating metals and inorganic nanostructured materials into CB, which has been proven to produce highly efficient and low-cost as well as stable and highly available counter electrode materials for DSSCs.

Owing to their higher stability and availability with low prices, introducing silicon-based materials in CEs is a promising strategy to enhance the total performance of DSSCs. SiO2/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been employed as a transparent CE for bifacial DSSCs with a power conversion efficiency comparable to that of Pt-based cells. Nano-silicon was successfully extracted from waste rice husk (RH) by activated carbon. The efficiency of the DSSCs with isolated Si-AC as the CE was 8.01%, which is better than that of a Pt-cell (7.20%). High catalytic activities were obtained by inserting different weight portions of silicon compounds such as Si3N4, SiO2, SiS2 and SiSe2with PEDOT:PSS to be employed as CEs in DSSCs. The obtained efficiency of the fabricated DSSCs with 5 wt% Si3N4 and 5 wt% SiSe2 (8.2%) was comparable to that of Pt (8.5%).
In this work, for the first time commercial Si3N4 was added to CB paste. The total performance of the CB based DSSCs was greatly boosted by preparing a new CB counter electrode via incorporating different proportions of Si3N4 (1, 3 and 5 wt%, depending on the weight of CB) to prepare a composite film (CB–Si3N4 films) using a printing technique. Si3N4 was chosen due to its thermal and chemical stability. A printing technique was employed to ensure high adhesion of the catalytic film with the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). The morphology and electrochemical properties of CB–Si3N4 films were reported. The electrochemical and conversion efficiency study indicated that CB–Si3N4-3% shows the best performance. The effect of the CB–Si3N4-3% CE thickness on the total performance of the DSSCs is evaluated and discussed.

Carbon black and Si3N4 nanopowder (average particle size: 20 nm) were purchased from Aladdin. Lithium iodide (LiI, 99%), iodine (I2, 99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, C9H13N, 96%), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA, [(CH3)2CHO]2Ti(C5H7O2)2, 75 wt% in isopropanol), bis(tri-fluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and hexachloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 37.50% Pt basis) and Pt wire (0.5 mm diameter, 99.99% basis, 10.6 μΩ cm at 20 °C), which were used in CV analysis, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ru dye, cis-di(thiocyanato) bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II) (N719) was purchased from Dyesol. Acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.80%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Titanium dioxide paste (average particle size: 30 and 400 nm) was purchased from OPV Tech Co., Ltd. Ethyl cellulose (EC, 40–100 cPa s) and absolute ethanol (C2H6O) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Terpineol was purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All of the reagents used were of analytical purity and used as received. The FTO conductive glass (2 mm thickness, square resistance of 10–15 Ω sq−1) was purchased from OPV Tech Co., Ltd.


CB–Si3N4 composites were prepared as follows. First, 100 mg of CB was dispersed in 6 ml of binder solution (prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of ethyl cellulose in 8.0 ml of terpineol) under stirring and sonicated for 1 h. Then different wt% portions of Si3N4 nanopowder (1, 3 and 5 wt% based on the weight of CB) were mixed with CB paste, followed by stirring and ultrasonic irradiation for 1 h at room temperature to form the CB–Si3N4 dispersant. The obtained CB–Si3N4 paste was then coated onto an FTO-glass substrate via a successive screen printing method to get the desired thickness. Finally, the coated films with an active area of 0.49 cm2 were dried at 120 °C for 10 min and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and employed as CEs. By the same procedure, CB and Si3N4 CEs were prepared for comparison. A Pt CE was prepared by dropping 10 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol onto the FTO glass followed by thermal treatment at 400 °C for 20 min in air. In this study, the CB–Si3N4 films with 1, 3 and 5 wt% Si3N4 content were assigned as CB–Si3N4-1%, CB–Si3N4-3% and CB–Si3N4-5%, respectively.


TiO2 photoanodes were prepared using a method based on a previous report. Typically, FTO conductive glass substrates were washed with a detergent solution and rinsed with de-ionized water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min before use. An alcoholic solution of titanium isopropoxide 10% (v/v) was sprayed onto a previously cleaned FTO glass substrate by airbrushing at 450 °C on a hot plate to form a blocking compact layer. A commercial TiO2 paste was coated onto the treated FTO-titanium isopropoxide using a printing technique. TiO2 paste of 18 nm particle size was screen-printed to form a transparent layer. The printing process was repeated five times and followed by annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. The scattering layer was coated onto the top of the transparent layer by the repeated printing of TiO2 with a 400 nm particle size four times. The obtained TiO2 films with a 0.16 cm2 active area were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in a programmed control system. After being cooled to room temperature, the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was bathed in a 20 mM TiCl4 (aq.) bath at 70 °C for 30 min. Finally, the obtained TiO2 films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min then bathed in a 0.3 mM solution of N-719 dye in absolute ethanol for 18 h at room temperature. The DSSCs were assembled by clipping the loaded dye TiO2 anode to the as-prepared CE using a 25 μm thick spacer (Solaronix) with an inner that has dimensions of 5 × 6 mm. A liquid electrolyte, consisting of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile was injected into the gap between the electrodes. Symmetric cells with 0.49 cm2 active areas were fabricated for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization tests with two identical CEs using a 25 μm thick spacer and filled with the same liquid electrolyte as used in the photovoltaic study.


The surface morphologies of the CB and CB–Si3N4-3% CE were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was performed on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer using a Cu K radiation source. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the powder samples were recorded using dry KBr pellets at room temperature in the region of 4000–400 cm−1. The surface area and the pore size distribution of the CB, CB–Si3N4-3% and CB–Si3N4-5% powder samples were obtained using a N2 gas adsorption/desorption technique on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 system. Before the measurements the samples were degassed at 77 K under vacuum overnight. The surface area and pore size distribution of the prepared samples were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) models, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies of the prepared CEs were performed using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell on a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. Ag/Ag+ served as the reference electrode, Pt coil as the counter electrode, and the as-prepared CEs as the working electrodes in a nitrogen purged anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiTFSI, 5 mM LiI and 0.5 mM I2 electrolyte. CV curves were recorded in the potential range from +1.0 V to −1.0 V at a 50 mV s−1 scan rate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the symmetric cells was performed on an Ametek 1260 EIS instrument in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with 10 mV AC amplitude at a zero bias potential under dark conditions. Z-view software was used to fit the impedance spectra using a suitable equivalent circuit. A Tafel polarization test was performed on the electrochemical workstation with a 100 mV s−1 scan rate. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs were recorded using a Newport solar simulator, USA (450 W Xe source) with a Keithley 2400 source meter, under irradiation (AM 1.5G, 0.1 W cm−2 light radiation intensity). The light intensity was adjusted using a standard Si solar cell.


The surface morphology of the CB film (Fig. 1a) shows the aggregates of porous interconnected nanoparticles with an average size of 37 nm. Such spherical particles exhibit a higher rate of coalescence with an average particle size of 31 nm after incorporating Si3N4, as shown in Fig. 1b. The low-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1c) reveals that the CB–Si3N4-3% framework is entirely porous, which is good for the mass transport efficiency of the electrode, high electrochemical surface area and the exposure of more catalytic active sites for effective reduction reactions. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1d) also shows that the film is porous with a 4.7 μm mean thickness.

To examine the phase structure of CB, Si3N4 and the CB–Si3N4-3% composite, XRD patterns were recorded and are shown in Fig. 2a. The CB pattern shows two broad peaks at 2θ = 25.4° and 43.4°, which are assignable to the (002) and (100) diffraction planes of graphite and the long-range disordered structure, respectively. The Si3N4 nanopowder also shows an amorphous structure. Compared to CB and Si3N4, the as-prepared CB–Si3N4-3% composite exhibits a mixed structure with a broad peak at 2θ = 25.4°, indicating a good dispersion of the Si3N4 nanoparticles in the CB paste. FT-IR spectra of the CB, Si3N4 and CB–Si3N4-3% powder samples were recorded to confirm the composite formation. As shown in Fig. 2b, the CB spectrum shows a band at 3452 cm−1, which is due to adsorbed water molecules, while the observed low intensity band at 1620 cm−1 is assignable to the C–O stretching vibration of carboxylic acid. The Si3N4 spectrum shows clear peaks at 3386 cm−1 relating to the N–H stretching mode and at 1010 cm−1 relating to the N–H bending mode. Furthermore, the weak peak at 2516 cm−1 corresponds to the Si–H stretching mode, while the small peaks at 881 and 480 cm−1 belong to the Si–N asymmetric stretching and Si–N symmetric stretching modes respectively. The peak at 1630 cm−1 is assigned to the H–N–H vibration mode. The CB–Si3N4 composite spectrum displays a combination of peaks from both CB and Si3N4, indicating that the chemical structure of the CB–Si3N4 composite is composed of both phases.
Although CB exhibits significant catalytic activity, the overall performance of its DSSCs is still low in comparison with Pt-based cells, which may be due to its insufficient exchange current density. To enhance the exchange current density, the specific surface area and the porosity of CB based CEs must be enhanced. As shown in Fig. 2c, the samples exhibit type IV isotherms with an H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the formation of mesoporous structures. The obtained surface area of the CB–Si3N4-3% composite is 131.7 m2 g−1, which is 72.6% larger than that of CB (76.3 m2 g−1). The large surface area can offer a large contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte and expose more catalytically active sites for I3− reduction, thereby improving the total performance of the DSSCs. From Fig. 2d, it can be noticed that the addition of 3 wt% of Si3N4 to the CB paste results in the enhancement of the pore volume from 0.29 cm3 g−1 to 0.46 cm3 g−1 for CB and the CB–Si3N4-3% composite respectively, further confirming the high porosity of the CB–Si3N4-3% composite structure. However, further increasing the Si3N4 content in the CB paste leads to a significant reduction of the surface area (to 80.0 m2 g−1) and pore volume (to 0.32 cm3 g−1) of the resultant composite CB–Si3N4-5%, which may be attributed to the high rate of agglomeration of Si3N4 nanoparticles.

The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CEs toward the reduction of I3− was systematically investigated by a CV test. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CB and CB–Si3N4 CEs exhibit two pairs of redox peaks, while Si3N4 shows only one redox peak at the more positive potential region (inset of Fig. 3a), indicating the poor catalytic activity of Si3N4 toward I3− reduction. The two pairs of redox peaks in CB and in different CB–Si3N4 composites signifies their ability to catalyze the reduction of I3− and their suitability for use in DSSCs. From the CV curves, the more negative redox peaks represent the reduction of I3− according to eqn (1)

I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−
(1)
The more positive peaks are related to the reduction of I
2 molecules according to eqn (2)

3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−
(2)
As the main function of the CE is to catalyze the reduction of I3− toward the regeneration of sensitizer molecules, the redox reaction in eqn (1) represents the electrocatalytic activity of the CE. The standard reduction potential of the I3−/I− redox couple is ∼0.35 V. The electrocatalytic ability of the CE is inversely related to the magnitude of the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) and is directly correlated to peak current density (Ipc). It can be noticed from Table 1 and Table S1 in the ESI that the addition of a small amount of Si3N4 boosts the current density (Ipc) from 0.14 to 1.3 mA cm−2 and reduces the peak–peak separation (Epp) from 0.62 to 0.56 V for CB and CB–Si3N4-3%, respectively, demonstrating higher electrocatalytic activity. Such enhanced activity can be attributed to the large surface area which offers a large amount of active sites and high mass transport efficiency towards I3−/I− species. However, CB–Si3N4-5% shows a slight decrease in the reduction current (1.15 mA cm−2) and lower catalytic activity as a result of decreased conductivity and particle agglomeration which reduces the specific surface area, thus less active sites are available for the effective reduction of I3−. EIS was utilized to further investigate the electrocatalytic activity and the interfacial electrochemical properties of the as-prepared CEs. The obtained Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c) were fitted using the equivalent circuits (Fig. S2(b and c) in the ESI). From the equivalent circuit, the intercept on the real axis at high frequency represents the solid–solid interface (Rs) owing to the square resistance of the FTO glass substrate, external wire resistance and the conductivity of the CEs. The higher frequency semicircle represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the constant phase element (CPE). The catalytic activity of the CE is inversely related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct). The Warburg element (W) in the second semicircle at low frequency represents the Nernst diffusion impedance of I−/I3− in the electrolyte. Based on its lower electrical and catalytic activity compared to the mass transport, the resistance of electrolyte must be taken into account, thus the equivalent circuit (Fig. S2(c) in the ESI) of the CB–Si3N4 composite CE has two Warburg elements (W1 & W2) to fit the mass transport limitation of electrolyte diffusion and the diffusion impedance in the catalyst respectively. From the summarized data in Table 1, all of the Rct values of the CB–Si3N4 composite CEs are lower than that of CB (18.10) film, implying an enhanced charge transfer rate at the CE/electrolyte interface. This can mainly be explained by two factors; (i) Si3N4 nanoparticles act as additional catalytic sites (as illustrated in Scheme S1 in the ESI), and (ii) the large surface areas of the composites compared to that of CB which is shown by BET analysis. The CB–Si3N4-3% CE shows the smallest Rct value (2.34 Ω) which can be attributed to its much larger surface area and higher catalytic active sites available for tri-iodide reduction as indicated by the BET and CV analysis. Although CB–Si3N4-5% CE also shows a small Rct value (2.48 Ω) compared to CB (18.10 Ω), it is still higher than that of CB–Si3N4-3% (2.34 Ω). From the summarized data in Table S1 in the ESI, it can be seen that the double layer capacitance (CPE) increases from 6.75 μF for CB to 21.98 μF for the CB–Si3N4-3% CE, and the mass transport impedance reduces from 92.77 Ω for CB to 21.16 Ω for the CB–Si3N4-3% CE. This indicates that a larger amount of catalytically active sites are available for the redox couple reduction in the CB–Si3N4-3% CE. In addition, the CB–Si3N4-3% CE shows the lowest Nernst diffusion impedance (W2) among all of the CEs, indicating the faster diffusion of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Also, from the bode phase diagram in Fig. 3(d), the higher frequency peak assigned to the Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface shows a relationship with f according to eqn (3)
(3)
where,
f is the peak frequency. This peak shifts to a higher frequency upon adding Si3N4 to CB, demonstrating lower charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. The electron lifetime (τ) of the generated photoelectron at the CE/electrolyte interface plays a critical role in the catalytic activity of the CEs. The shorter the time, the lower the recombination rate and τ can be determined by the following relation,τ = 1/2πf. The obtained τ value decreased from 28.30 μs for CB to 10.40 μs for CB–Si3N4-3%, which reveals a lower recombination rate and higher electrocatalytic activity which in line with the CV and EIS results.

Tafel polarization analysis was performed to further investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the CB–Si3N4 composite CEs toward I3− reduction. The Tafel curves of the prepared symmetric cells are shown in Fig. 3b, and the relevant parameters are given in Table 1. In general, the Tafel curve is composed of three zones; (i) the polarization zone (|V| < 120 mV), (ii) the Tafel zone (120 mV < |V| < 400 mV), and (iii) the diffusion zone (|V| > 400 mV). The exchange current density (J0) can be determined from the cross point of cathodic and anodic curves in the Tafel zone. A higher J0 value indicates lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and can be evaluated from eqn (4).
(4)
where
R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin (290 K), n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.

It can be observed that the CB–Si3N4-3% CE displays the highest exchange current density (J0) toward the reduction of tri-iodide, suggesting lower charge transfer resistance, which is in agreement with the EIS analysis. The diffusion-limited current density (Jlim) can be obtained from the intercept of the cathodic curve with the Y-axis in the controlled diffusion zone. Jlim is the diffusion coefficient of the redox species as shown in eqn (5).
(5)
where
D is the diffusion coefficient of tri-iodide, l is the thickness of diffusion layer, C is the concentration of tri-iodide, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction (n = 2), and F is the Faraday constant.

From the Tafel plot (Fig. 3b), it can be noticed that CB–Si3N4-3% exhibits the highest Jlim value compared to the other CEs, (Table S1 in the ESI), demonstrating an increase in the diffusion kinetics of the redox couple in a liquid electrolyte as a result of the low diffusion resistance of the redox couple. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with CB, Si3N4 and different CB–Si3N4 composite CEs under illumination conditions (100 MW cm−2, 1.5 AM) are presented in Fig. 4. The thickness of the CEs was uniform at 4.7 μm. The obtained photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The DSSCs with the Si3N4 CE show quite low efficiency (0.24%), which can be attributed to the lower fill factor (FF), which is possibly related to the lack of conductivity and poor catalytic activity toward I3− reduction. However, adding Si3N4 to the CB paste greatly improves the total performance of the DSSCs. The assembled DSSCs with the CB–Si3N4-3% composite CE achieved the highest efficiency (8.06%), which is about 55% higher than that of the CB based cell (5.18%). However, for the DSSC with the CB–Si3N4-5% composite CE, the overall performance slightly decreases by about 10%, which is in line with the above electrochemical analysis.

CB–Si3N4-3% composite CEs with different thicknesses ranging from 1.4–14.1 μm were prepared to study their effects on the total performance of the DSSCs. A Pt CE was also prepared for comparison. Fig. 5a show the CV curves of the CB–Si3N4-3% electrodes with different thicknesses. As displayed in Table 2, the peak current density increases from 0.33 to 1.71 mA cm−2 for 1.4 and 14.1 μm thicknesses, respectively, suggesting that a thicker film offers higher catalytic activity. This is attributed to the increase in surface area which favorably enhances the contact area between the electrolyte and the electrode, thereby improving the reactivity and catalytic activity. Electrochemical impedance spectra were also recorded for the symmetric dummy cells of the CB–Si3N4-3% CEs with different thicknesses. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots and the related parameters are stated in Table 2 and Table S2 in the ESI. Also, it can be clearly shown that all of the CB–Si3N4-3% CEs with different thicknesses show higher Rs values than that of Pt. This may be due to the larger thickness, which results in higher internal resistance. It can be shown that the charge transfer resistance Rct dramatically decreases with increasing thickness. The CB–Si3N4-3% CE with a thickness of 14.1 μm yields a charge transfer resistance of 0.85 Ω, which is about 4 times lower than that of Pt (3.19 Ω), indicating the superior electrocatalytic activity of our prepared composite CEs. The higher Rct value of CB–Si3N4-3% with 1.4 μm thickness is due to the thinness of the catalytic layer and thus the insufficient amount of catalytic sites. From Table S2 in the ESI, when the thickness increased, the CPE values gradually increased as well as both the mass transport impedance and Nernst diffusion impedance, which indicated the enhancement of catalytic activity and was reflected in the increase in the total performance of the full DSSCs devices. The interfacial charge transfer properties at the CE/electrolyte interface were investigated by obtaining Tafel polarization curves as shown in Fig. 5c and the resultant parameters are shown in Table S2 in the ESI. The exchange current density (J0) of the CB–Si3N4-3% composite CE is greatly improved when the thickness of the catalyst layer is increased such that a 14.1 μm thick layer shows a higher J0 value compared to that of the Pt electrode, indicating the improved charge transferability. In addition, the improvement of the diffusion current density and diffusion coefficient is a reflection of the decrease in the diffusion resistance of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Based on the high catalytic activity of CB–Si3N4-3%, the performance of DSSCs using this CE is expected to be comparable to Pt-based cells. To study the effect of CE thickness on the performance of DSSCs, a set of cells were fabricated employing CB–Si3N4-3% with different thicknesses. As shown in the J–V curves (Fig. 5d) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters in Table 2, the efficiency of the DSSCs is greatly enhanced with increasing the thickness of the CE and the efficiency of CB–Si3N4-3% CE that is 14.1 μm thick is 8.37% which is comparable to that of Pt-based cells (8.50%). It can be noticed from the photovoltaic parameters that increasing the thickness of CB–Si3N4-3% results in enhancing the FF and the overall efficiency increases due to the decrease in internal resistance, which is in good agreement with the EIS and CV results. This is strong evidence that our CEs can be employed as a suitable cheap alternative to the expensive Pt CE for large scale applications.

In summary, CB–Si3N4 based nanocomposites have been prepared as highly efficient CEs for DSSCs. Due to its large specific surface area (131.7 m2 g−1) and abundant amount of exposed catalytically active sites; CB–Si3N4-3% displays high efficiency toward the reduction of tri-iodide. The prepared DSSC with a 4.7 μm thick CB–Si3N4-3% CE exhibits a high conversion efficiency of 8.06%. Moreover, the conversion efficiency of an assembled DSSC based on the CB–Si3N4-3% CE with a thickness of 14.1 μm is 8.37%, which is better than the efficiency of pure CB (5.18%) and comparable to that of Pt (8.50%). This work demonstrates that CB–Si3N4 is a promising candidate to replace the expensive and rare Pt-based CE to realize large-scale application. In addition, our prepared CEs may show good performance with a cobalt based electrolyte, due to the improvement of the pore volume of the prepared CE.
