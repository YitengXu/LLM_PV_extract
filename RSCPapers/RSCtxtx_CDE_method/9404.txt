In this study, two new pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (PPD)-based polymers (P3 and P4) incorporating a 2-octyldodecyl (branched alkyl) group on the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit were prepared. Their properties were briefly compared to those of the structurally quite similar PPD-based polymers (P1 and P2) with an n-octyl (linear alkyl) group on the PPD unit, in order to understand the importance of the pyrrole N-alkyl group. The calculated optical band gaps (Eg) and highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels of P3 and P4 were found to be around ∼0.1 eV higher and deeper, respectively, compared to those of the respective linear alkylated polymers P1 and P2. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) obtained for the polymer solar cells made by using P3 or P4:PC70BM blends without any additive was around ∼2%, which was quite similar to that of the PSCs made using P1 or P2:PC70BM blends. However, P3 and P4 exhibited a notably lower PCE than that of P1 and P2, respectively, when the polymer solar cells were created with an additive. This study confirmed that the alkyl substituent on the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit significantly affects the properties of the resulting polymer.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are made by blending a π-conjugated polymeric donor with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) or a π-conjugated organic small molecule acceptor. They have attracted a great deal of attention due to their many advantages such as high energy conversion efficiency, low cost, light weight, and as large-area devices on flexible substrates made via solution-processed printing techniques. Studies on tuning the photo-physical properties of the π-conjugated polymer or π-conjugated organic small molecule are crucial because even a slight modification of the properties of the π-conjugated material greatly influences its photovoltaic performance. Currently, side chain engineering on a π-conjugated semiconducting material is considered to be the most important research area. This is because it could not only lead to changes in the solubility of the π-conjugated semiconducting material, but also greatly affects the absorption, energy levels, crystallinity, charge transport, and surface morphology of the active layer, and consequently, the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, we have been interested in developing high energy converting wide band gap polymeric materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs).

Recently, we reported a series of pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (PPD)-based efficient wide band gap electron donor polymers for highly efficient PSCs. Among these, polymers P1 and P2 (Fig. 1) are found to be very promising polymeric donor materials for PSCs. In particular, P2 showed outstanding photovoltaic performance when used as an electron donor along with the electron-accepting PC70BM, even though its band gap is over 2.0 eV. It is worth noticing that P2 does not show good solubility in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB), and dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. However, in order to make an efficient interpenetrating network between the polymer and PC70BM on the photoactive layer of PSCs, it is essential to create polymers that are freely soluble in chlorinated solvents. A simple and efficient way to improve the solubility of the polymer in such solvents is to incorporate bigger alkyl groups on its side chains. Therefore, we believe that the insertion of a relatively bigger alkyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit of P1 and P2 could greatly improve the solubility of the resulting polymer. Herein, we report the synthesis of two new PPD-based polymers (P3 and P4) containing a 2-octyldodecyl alkyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen (Fig. 1). The optical, electrochemical, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties of these polymers were briefly compared to those of P1 and P2 in order to understand the property modulation of the PPD-based polymer when replacing the linear alkyl group with a branched one.

Reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The compounds prepared in this study were purified by column chromatography (silica gel, Merck Kieselgel 60, 70–230 mesh ASTM). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the compounds and polymer were recorded on a Varian Mercury Plus spectrometer (300 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C). High resolution fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra of the compounds were analyzed using a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer. An Agilent 1200 Infinity Series separation module was used to determine the molecular weights of the polymer using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with chloroform as an eluent at ambient temperature. The GPC instrument was calibrated with the polystyrene standard prior to analysis. The film state UV-visible absorption spectrum of the polymer was recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer, and a CH Instruments Electrochemical Analyzer was used to determine the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the polymer. The polymer cast film on the platinum working electrode was immersed in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4), Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and the measurement was then performed. Before starting the CV analysis, the instrument was calibrated with the common ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) standard. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Seiko instruments SPI 3800N-SPA 400. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Hitachi H-7500.


The organic field effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated on highly n-type-doped silicon (Si) substrates with a 200 nm layer of thermally grown silicon oxide (SiO2). The Si substrates were subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 30 min for activation and then treated with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer. The n-type doped Si substrate functions as a gate electrode and the SiO2 layer acts as a gate dielectric. The chlorobenzene (CB) solution of the polymer (10 mg mL−1) was spin-cast on top of the Si substrate (2000 rpm) and dried at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes. The source and drain electrodes (Au, 70 nm) were deposited on top of the polymer layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of approximately 2 × 10−6 Torr. The channel length (L) and channel width (W) of the device were 50 μm and 3.0 mm, respectively. The output and transfer characteristics of the OFETs were measured using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200). All the preparation processes and the characterization of the OFETs were performed inside a N2-atmosphere glove box. The mobility (μ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime:
IDS,sat = μ(WCi/2L)(VGS − VT)2
where
Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 dielectric (Ci = 15 nF cm−2) and VT is the threshold voltage.


The PSCs were fabricated with the simple device structure of ITO-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Al. The pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate was dried overnight in an oven. A 40 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-cast from an aqueous solution on an ITO-coated glass substrate. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the photoactive layer. A solution containing a mixture of polymer:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) in chlorobenzene (CB):1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) at a different volume ratio was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer. The film was then dried for 30 min at RT in a glove box. Subsequently, an aluminum (Al, 100 nm) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of approximately 3 × 10−6 Torr. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSC devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The solar cell performance was determined using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated by comparing the solar simulator spectrum with the AM 1.5 spectrum at RT. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the PSCs was measured as a function of the wavelength in the wavelength range of 300 to 1000 nm using a xenon lamp as the light source, and the calibration was performed by using a silicon reference cell.

Monomers M1 (0.27 g, 0.30 mmol) and M2 (0.26 g, 0.30 mmol) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (20 mL). The solution was purged well with argon for 45 min and then Pd2(dba)3 (7 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (15 mg) were added in one portion. The entire mixture was stirred and refluxed for 36 h under an argon atmosphere. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to RT and then added drop by drop into vigorously stirred methanol (200 mL). The precipitates were recovered by filtration, and the crude polymer was extracted with methanol and acetone for 24 h each in a Soxhlet apparatus affording the pure polymer P3 as a brown solid. Yield (0.33 g, 87%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.90–8.10 (m, 2H), 7.50–7.80 (m, 4H), 6.70–6.90 (m, 4H), 4.30–4.60 (m, 2H), 3.40–3.80 (m, 2H), 2.70–2.90 (m, 5H), 0.80–2.00 (m, 83H).


Polymer P4 was prepared using a similar procedure as that mentioned for P3. A solution of M1 (0.27 g, 0.30 mmol) and M3 (0.34 g, 0.30 mmol) was used for the synthesis of polymer P4. Polymer P4 was obtained as a red solid. Yield (0.44 g, 95%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.87 (s, 2H), 7.75 (s, 2H), 7.48 (s, 2H), 7.35 (s, 2H), 6.97 (s, 2H), 4.44 (s, 2H), 3.47 (s, 2H), 2.91 (s, 4H), 0.70–2.00 (m, 108H).


The key intermediates such as 4,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5-octyl-5H-furo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (1) and diethyl 2,5-dibromo-1-(2-octyldodecyl)-1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate (2) were prepared using methods found in the reported literature. The synthetic route to monomers, M2 and M3, and polymers, P3 and P4, is outlined in Scheme 1. As expected, both polymers P3 and P4 exhibited excellent solubility at ambient temperature in all the chlorinated solvents that were tested (CHCl3, CB, and DCB). The estimated weight average molecular (Mw) weight/number average molecular (Mn) weight values of P3 and P4 were 2.68 × 104 g mol−1/1.20 × 104 g mol−1 and 3.25 × 104 g mol−1/1.66 × 104 g mol−1, respectively. The calculated polydispersities (PDI) of the polymers were 2.22 and 1.95, respectively.


The absorption spectra of polymers P1–P4 were measured as a thin film on glass and are presented in Fig. 2. The absorption bands of polymers P3 and P4 were blue-shifted compared to those of polymers P1 and P2, respectively. Therefore, the maximum absorptions of the newly developed polymers (P3 and P4) were blue-shifted by ∼24 nm and ∼18 nm compared to those of P1 and P2, respectively. The absorption maxima and band gap values of P1–P4 are listed in Table 1 for comparison. The band gap values of P3 and P4 estimated from the onset absorption were 2.14 eV and 2.13 eV, respectively. These values were around 0.1 eV higher than those of the respective linear polymers P1 and P2.

In order to determine the reason for the blue-shifted absorptions of P3 and P4, DFT calculations using the B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-31G* basis sets were performed on PPD units bearing linear and branched alkyl groups on the pyrrole nitrogen. The respective optimized structures are shown in Fig. 3. As can be observed, the dihedral angle between the thiophene and pyrrole groups in the linear alkylated PPD unit was around 26° (Fig. 3a), while in the branched alkylated PPD unit, the value was around 43° (Fig. 3b). It is also worth noting that the presence of a branched and bigger alkyl group on the PPD unit could diminish the π–π stacking between the polymer chains. Consequently, polymers P3 and P4 showed a blue-shifted absorption band compared to P1 and P2, respectively. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry analysis revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of P3 and P4 (−5.54 eV and −5.52 eV) are around 0.1 eV deeper than those of P1 and P2 (−5.44 eV and −5.41 eV), respectively. In contrast, the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of P3 and P4 (−3.40 eV and −3.39 eV) were found to be similar to those of P1 and P2 (−3.40 eV and −3.37 eV). The respective cyclic voltammograms of polymers P1–P4 are shown in Fig. 4.
The organic field effect transistor (OFETs) prepared using P3 and P4 exhibited a maximum hole mobility of 1.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. The OFET characteristics of P3 and P4 are displayed in Fig. 5 and the mobility values of polymers P1–P4 are included in Table 1. It is worth noting that polymers P3 and P4 exhibited one order lower mobility than those of polymers P1 and P2 (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results indicate that the substitution of the linear alkyl group with a branched alkyl group significantly altered the solubility, optical, electrical, and charge transport properties of the resulting polymers.

PSCs were prepared using P3 and P4 as electron donors and PC70BM as an electron acceptor with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3 or P4:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + different vol% of additive/Al. The J–V characteristics obtained for the PSCs made by using P3 or P4:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without an additive, as well as with 3, 5, or 10 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and with 3, 5, or 10 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), are shown in Fig. 6. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters such as power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The maximum PCEs achieved for P3- and P4-based PSCs made without additives were 0.98% (Voc ∼ 0.73 V, Jsc ∼ 3.96 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 34%) and 2.15% (Voc ∼ 0.84 V, Jsc ∼ 6.22 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 41%), respectively.

The comparison of the photovoltaic performances of P3 and P4 to those of their respective parent polymers P1 (PCE ∼ 1.23%, Voc ∼ 0.75 V, Jsc ∼ 5.54 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 29%) and P2 (PCE ∼ 2.22%, Voc ∼ 0.69 V, Jsc ∼ 7.61 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 42%) suggested that the photovoltaic parameters are quite similar to those of the device made without DIO. However, P1 and P2 showed a greatly enhanced PCE (over 6.5%) for the device prepared with 3 vol% DIO additive. Therefore, we also prepared PSCs using P3 or P4:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends with DIO (3, 5, or 10 vol%) and CN (3, 5, or 10 vol%). As can be observed from Tables 2 and 3, the Voc of the devices considerably improved but there was no further increase in the Jsc, FF. Consequently, these devices displayed quite a similar performance to that of their respective devices created without any additive.
To verify the Jsc value obtained from the PSCs, we obtained the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs made with (10 vol%) and without CN (Fig. 7). It was found that the integrated Jsc value estimated from the IPCE spectra and the Jsc value obtained for the respective J–V curves correlate well with each other. In general, PPD-based polymers (∼P1 and P2) bearing a linear alkyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen showed an improved interpenetrating network with PC70BM, lower root mean square (rms) roughness, and high grains when the film contained 3 vol% DIO compared with when it was made without any additive. Consequently, P1 and P2 offered high photovoltaic parameters when the device was made with 3 vol% DIO. However, the PPD-based new polymers P3 and P4 with branched alkyl groups on the pyrrole nitrogen displayed a much lower photovoltaic performance when the device contained 3 vol% DIO.
In order to understand the different behavior of P3 and P4, we examined the surface morphology of the films prepared from P3 or P4:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without additive, and with DIO (3, 5, or 10 vol%) or CN (3, 5, and 10 vol%), using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The phase (inset: respective topology, a*–g*, and 3D topology, a**–g** images) mode AFM images are presented in Fig. 8 and 9. As can be observed, the films processed without additive had a better interpenetrating network and lower surface roughness compared to those of the films processed using DIO. Therefore, the PSCs made without any additive showed a relatively better performance compared with the devices made with additives such as DIO and CN. The use of a 3 vol% additive clearly induced cluster formation on the surface. When the additive content was gradually increased to 10 vol%, the size of the cluster decreased reasonably and the root mean square (rms) roughness values were lowered. However, the morphology was still not good enough for efficient exciton separation since the life time of the exciton was a few picoseconds only. Overall, P3 and P4 showed a better morphology for the film made without any additive, whereas P1 and P2 showed good morphology for the film made with an additive.
We further measured the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the films processed using the P1 or P3:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without and with 5 vol% DIO. The respective TEM images are shown in Fig. 10. Each polymer P1 and P3 behaves differently when it blends with PC70BM. The TEM images showed a quite similar cluster formation trend as those of the AFM images. The film processed using P1:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blend without DIO showed a uniform and small size of cluster formation between the polymer and PC70BM. However, the cluster formation was completely removed with the use of 5 vol% DIO. Consequently, the device made with DIO offered a relatively high PCE compared to that of the device made without DIO for P1. In contrast, the film processed using P3:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) + 5 vol% DIO blend showed a large size of cluster formation compared to that of the film processed without DIO. Consequently, the device made without DIO offered a relatively high PCE compared to that of the device made with DIO for P3.
In addition, we also measured the hole mobilities of P1 and P3, and the hole and electron mobilities of P1 or P3:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without and with 5 vol% DIO using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer or polymer:PC70BM/MoO3/Al (hole-only device) and ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC70BM/ZnO/Al (electron-only device). The hole and electron mobilities were calculated according to the standard method and the results are summarized in Table 4. The hole mobilities of P1 (∼1.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and P3 (∼3.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) estimated from the SCLC method are comparable with those of the OFETs. Notably, both polymer P1 and P3 exhibited quite similar hole mobilities, in the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, for P1 or P3:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without and with 5 vol% DIO. However, the electron mobilities of P1:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without and with 5 vol% DIO (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) were found to be two orders higher than those of P3:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends without and with 5 vol% DIO (∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). In particular, P1 showed increased electron mobility for the film processed with DIO but P3 exhibited a slightly lower electron mobility compared to that of their corresponding film processed without DIO. It is also worth noting that a balanced charge transport is expected for P1:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends due to their similar hole and electron mobilities but imbalanced charge transport is expected for P3:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt%) blends due to their very different hole and electron mobilities. The imbalanced charge transport significantly decreased the performance of P3 compared to P1.

The results of the studies suggest that the morphology and electron mobility of polymer:PC70BM blend of PPD-based polymers was highly affected by the alkyl chain attached to the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit. It is possible that the presence of the branched and bulky 2-octyldodecyl group on the PPD unit created some steric hindrance between the polymer chains as well as between the polymer and PC70BM. As a result, a better network formation was observed when the film was created without any additive. We believe that the insertion of a more suitable alkyl group, such as heptadecan-9-yl, on the pyrrole nitrogen might create freely soluble and highly efficient PPD-based polymers that could be used in additive-free PSCs.

In this study, we elaborately studied the effects of the incorporation of a branched (2-octyldodecyl)alkyl group in place of a linear (n-octyl)alkyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen of pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (PPD)-based polymers. New polymers, P3 and P4, were developed comprising a 2-octyldodecyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit, and their optoelectrical, charge transport, and photovoltaic properties were thoroughly studied. The properties of P3 and P4 were briefly compared to those of P1 and P2, which contained an n-octyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit. This study revealed that the incorporation of a 2-octyldodecyl instead of an n-octyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen of a PPD unit greatly alters the optical (higher band gap), electrical (deeper HOMO), and charge transport properties (lower hole and electron mobility mobility), as well as the morphology (no additive required) and photovoltaic performance (lower PCE) of the resulting polymer. Hence, we can conclude that the N-alkyl group on the pyrrole nitrogen of the PPD unit is critical in controlling the properties of PPD-based polymers. We believe that this is study is beneficial for researchers designing new polymers for PSCs and OFETs for use in optoelectronic applications.
