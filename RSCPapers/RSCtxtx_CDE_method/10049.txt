The natural biomaterial sarcosine as an electron transport layer (ETL) to modify ITO or ITO/ZnO was successfully introduced into inverted organic solar cells (OSCs) with PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl as the active layer. The introduction of sarcosine on the surface of ITO or ITO/ZnO resulted in lower work function (WF) and higher surface energy. The active layers processed on the surfaces of ITO or ITO/ZnO presented a more optimized morphology and a more ordered molecular arrangement after their modification with sarcosine. The introduction of sarcosine as an ETL promoted charge transport and collection in the OSCs. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs increased to 13.53% from 3.86% by modifying ITO with sarcosine. The PCE of the OSCs with ZnO as ETLs improved to 16.45% from 14.85% by modifying ZnO with sarcosine. The improved PCEs benefited from the simultaneously improved short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open-circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, this work demonstrates that sarcosine has great potential as an ETL to improve the performance of OSCs.

The development of environmentally friendly and sustainable energy has become inevitable nowadays due to the increasingly serious problems caused by environmental pollution and energy shortage. Solar energy has become a focus for developing novel renewable energy technologies. Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered as one of the potential candidates to generate electricity utilizing solar energy due to their advantages such as low cost, light weight, flexibility, and large-area fabrication. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has constantly been promoted with the development of photoactive materials and device technology. OSCs with PCEs of more than 17% have been fabricated in the laboratory by multiple scientific teams. Further advances toward commercialization require improvement in the efficiency and stability of OSCs, which is the focus of research today. The interfacial properties between the active layer and the electrode play an important role in the construction of efficient and stable OSCs. A good interface layer can improve the Ohmic contact between the electrode and the active layer, and promote charge transport and collection. Alternatively, electrons or holes can be selectively transmitted to reduce charge recombination due to reverse collection. An interface layer can also be used as an optical spacer to control the light field distribution of a device and enhance the photon trapping efficiency of the active layer. At the same time, it can prevent water, oxygen, ultraviolet rays, and metal ions from destroying the active layer, thereby improving the stability of the device. Due to the advantages of various preparation methods, high chemical stability, high transparency, and high electron mobility, ZnO is one of the most typical electron transport layer (ETL) materials used in inverted OSCs. However, there are still some disadvantages when ZnO is used as an ETL of OSCs. For example, surface defects will inevitably be introduced in the process of preparing ZnO. These surface defects will increase charge recombination losses, increase the adsorption of water and oxygen to the device, and result in a reduced stability of the device. The poor organic/inorganic inherent compatibility between ZnO and the active layer could increase the series resistance of the device and reduce the charge transport efficiency. The energy level offset between ZnO and acceptor is hardly adjusted, which is unfavourable for the formation of an Ohmic contact at the interfaces. Therefore, a modification of ZnO is needed to obtain a higher PCE and achieve better stability of OSCs based on ZnO.

Surface modification of ZnO is one of the common methods to improve the performance of OSCs with ZnO as an ETL. Polymer, small molecule, metal oxide, metal salt, and ionic liquid have been applied in OSCs as ZnO surface modification materials. Organic compounds account for a large proportion of all ZnO surface modification materials, and some representative works are shown in Table S1. Most of these organic materials for ZnO surface modification are synthetic, requiring complex synthesis processes and high costs. In nature, there are a lot of organic compounds in plants, animals, microorganisms, and their metabolites. Natural biomaterials have the inherent advantages of widespread existence, low cost, environmental friendliness, and renewability. The application of natural biomaterials in OSCs can reduce the cost of device preparation and environmental pollution. Some natural biomaterials have been attracting attention as useful interfacial materials of OSCs, such as DNA, Amino acid (L-Arg, α-PLL, poly-lysine), chlorophyll, polydopamine, and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC). Some representative works of natural biomaterials only as ETL materials or as ZnO surface modification materials are shown in Table 1. Most of the natural biomaterials have hydrophilic groups so that they are soluble in water. Many natural biomaterials contain polar groups, which can easily form a strong hydrogen bond with metal oxides and adsorb on the surface of metal oxides. At the same time, the existence of a polar group may result in the formation of the interface dipole moment and reduced work function (WF) of the electrode, which can possibly improve the PCE of OSCs.

Amino acid sarcosine is a natural biomaterial, which is widely found in animal muscle. In this work, sarcosine as an ETL was successfully introduced in inverted OSCs with PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl as the active layer. The utilized device structure with ITO/ETL/PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl/MoO3/Ag and the chemical structures of the used materials are shown in Fig. 1. A PCE of 13.53% was achieved in the optimized OSCs with sarcosine as the ETL, resulting from the simultaneously increased short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.10 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 63.21%, and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.82 V compared with the OSCs without ETL. A PCE of 16.45% was achieved in the OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as the double ETL, benefiting from the simultaneously improved JSC of 26.65 mA cm−2, FF of 72.64%, and VOC of 0.85 V compared with the OSCs with ZnO as the ETL. Optical characterization analyses indicate that sarcosine has high transmittance in a wavelength range from 300 to 1000 nm. The morphological characterization analyses of thin films show that the introduction of sarcosine can result in an improved compatibility between ITO or ITO/ZnO and the active layer, a more optimized morphology, and a more ordered molecular arrangement in the active layer. Measurement analyses by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) show that the introduction of sarcosine can significantly reduce the WF of ITO or ITO/ZnO, resulting in a better energy level match between modified ITO or ITO/ZnO and the acceptor. Electrical characterization analyses of the device reveal that the introduction of sarcosine can promote charge transport and collection.

To determine the positive effect of sarcosine on the device performance, a series of OSCs with different ETLs were prepared for the configuration of ITO/ETL/PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl/MoO3/Ag. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs were obtained under illumination with AM 1.5 G simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as exhibited in Fig. 2a. The key photovoltaic parameters of all OSCs are summarized in Table 2. The statistical average values of PCEs for each kind of OSC were calculated based on 20 cells from different batches. A PCE of 14.85% was achieved in the OSCs with ZnO as the ETL along with a JSC of 25.92 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.84 V and a FF of 68.19%. An optimized PCE of 16.45% was obtained by OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as the double ETL along with a JSC of 26.65 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.85 V and a FF of 72.64%. The JSC, VOC, and FF values of OSCs are all improved by the surface modification of ZnO with sarcosine. The statistical average value of PCE is 16.19% for OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as the ETL. The J–V curves of 20 cells for OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs are shown in Fig. S1. The key photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding OSCs are summarized in Table S2. A series of OSCs with different ETLs were prepared to determine the ability of sarcosine alone used as the ETL in OSCs. The OSCs without ETL exhibit a PCE of 3.86%, resulting from a JSC of 22.65 mA cm-2, a VOC of 0.41 V and a FF of 41.61%. The OSCs with sarcosine as the ETL exhibit a JSC of 26.10 mA cm-2, a FF of 63.21% and a VOC of 0.82 V, resulting in a PCE of 13.53%. In this work, sarcosine was dissolved in the blend solvent of deionized water and methanol at a weight ratio of 1:9. Methanol can also play a role in cathode interfacial modification as shown in the previous work. To clarify the effects of blend solvents as ETLs, OSCs were prepared using the blend solvent of deionized water and methanol at a weight ratio of 1:9 as the ETL. A PCE of 7.37% was achieved in the OSCs with the blend solvent as the ETL along with a JSC of 25.22 mA cm-2, a VOC of 0.56 V and a FF of 52.22%. To explore the positive effect of the blend solvent, the contact potential difference (CPD) of ITO/blend solvent was measured by KPFM. The captured CPD images, CPD data, and WFs are shown in Fig. S2. The WFs and CPD data of ITO modified with different ETLs are shown in Table S3. The WF was estimated by assigning the value of 4.70 eV to the WF of ITO as determined. The WF of the ITO electrode decreased from 4.70 eV to 4.61 eV by blend solvent modification. The decreased WF should be attributed to the interfacial dipole between ITO and the active layers induced by methanol. The built-in potential across the device may be increased due to the introduction of an interface dipole, which is beneficial for charge transport and collection. Compared with OSCs without ETL, the enhanced performance of OSCs with blend solvent as the ETL should be attributed to the positive effect of methanol in the blend solvent. Compared with sarcosine, the effect of blend solvents as ETLs in the OSCs is relatively small, which suggests that sarcosine can play a significant role in modifying the cathode interface. To further investigate the effect of sarcosine as an ETL in OSCs, the electron transport properties of the sarcosine films at different temperatures were evaluated with the electron-only device structure of ITO/Al/sarcosine/PDIN/Al using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model. The corresponding ln(Jd3/V2) − (V/d)0.5 curves of electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S3. The intrinsic electron mobility (μe) of sarcosine at 293 K is 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is sufficient for the electron transport materials of OSCs. A similar μe (1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of sarcosine is obtained at 270 K, which means there are a few defects in sarcosine. In general, the JSC, VOC and FF values of the OSCs can all be increased by introducing sarcosine as only ETL or as a ZnO surface modification layer into OSCs. The performance of OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as the double ETL is higher than that of OSCs with ZnO or sarcosine alone as the ETL.

A series of film and device characterization studies have been performed to explore the working mechanism of sarcosine in OSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of OSCs with different ETLs were obtained and they are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE values of the OSCs with ZnO, sarcosine, or ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs are enhanced in most of the spectral range compared with OSCs without ETLs. The enhancement trend of EQE is consistent with the rule of JSC for OSCs with different ETLs. It is worth noting that the enhancement ratios of EQE in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm for the OSCs with sarcosine as the ETL are larger than those of OSCs with ZnO or ZnO/sarcosine as the ETL. To explore the effect of light absorption of ETLs on JSC, the absorption spectra and transmission spectra of the sarcosine, ZnO, and ZnO/sarcosine films on quartz glass substrates were measured with a UV-Visible spectrophotometer and they are displayed in Fig. 2c and Fig. S4. The absorption intensities of the sarcosine film are close to 0 in the wavelength range of 300 to 1000 nm. The transmission ratios for the sarcosine film are close to 100% in the wavelength range from 300 to 1000 nm. This indicates that the sarcosine film showed no absorption of the incident light in the region from 300 to 1000 nm. This property of sarcosine can minimize the parasitic absorption loss to maximize the photocurrent generated in OSCs. The absorption spectra of the ZnO and ZnO/sarcosine films have a similar wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm with the same absorption peak at 334 nm. It should be the main reason for the smaller EQE values in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm for the OSCs with ZnO or ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs compared with the OSCs with sarcosine as the ETL. The absorption spectra or transmission spectra of the ZnO or ZnO/sarcosine films are coincident, which reconfirm the high transmittance of sarcosine. To explore the influence of ETLs for light absorption of the active layer on OSCs, the absorption spectra of the active layer processed on different ETL films on quartz glass substrates were measured and are shown in Fig. 2d. Compared with the active layer, the absorption spectra of the ZnO/active layer and ZnO/sarcosine/active layer films have a remarkable absorption enhancement in the range of 300 to 400 nm, which corresponds to the absorption of ZnO itself. The absorption spectrum of the sarcosine/active layer film is almost identical to that of the active layer film. It was further confirmed that the introduction of sarcosine had no negative effect on the absorption of the active layer.
The interface characteristics of ETLs play a significant role in the evolution of the active layer grown on top of them. To explore the influence of sarcosine for interfacial surface characteristics, the surface energy of the different ETLs was characterized by contact angle measurements. The total surface energy (γtot) of the films was calculated using contact angle goniometry coupled with the Wu model, as shown in the ESI. The deionized water (W) and ethylene glycol (EG) are used as the probing liquids for the contact angle measurements. The γtot value is equal to the sum of the dispersive energy (γd) and the polar energy (γp). The contact angle images of ITO/ETLs are shown in Fig. 3. The values of contact angle and relevant surface energy are summarized in Table 3. The values of γtot of the ITO, ITO/sarcosine, ITO/ZnO, and ZnO/sarcosine films were calculated to be 28.88, 75.02, 42.44, and 51.26 mN m−1 from the contact angle data. The γtot values of the ITO/sarcosine and ITO/ZnO/sarcosine films are higher than that of ITO/ZnO. The higher surface energy values of the ITO/sarcosine and ITO/ZnO/sarcosine films could be related to the hydrophilic properties of the hydroxyl-functional groups in sarcosine. A high value of γtot means more ready adhesion to the contacting active layer materials. Therefore, the compatibility between the ETLs and the active layer may be improved by introducing sarcosine on the surface of ZnO or ITO.

To explore the influence of surface morphology on surface energy, the morphology images of ITO with different ETLs were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The height images are shown in Fig. 4a. The surfaces of ITO and ITO/sarcosine are relatively smooth with small root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of 2.28 nm and 1.63 nm. The surfaces of the ITO/ZnO films have many big aggregates, which exhibit a large RMS surface roughness of 13.76 nm. These big aggregates may induce adverse effects upon contacting with the adjacent layers. The ITO/ZnO/sarcosine film has a smooth and orderly surface morphology. The RMS surface roughness of the ITO/ZnO film is significantly decreased to 2.27 nm by modifying ZnO with sarcosine. The decreased RMS roughness of ITO/ZnO/sarcosine indicates that sarcosine could effectively passivate the surface of ZnO. The smoother surface could provide higher surface energy and uniform contact with the active layer, which is beneficial for the formation of the active layer. In the meantime, the smooth surface is considered to be a prerequisite for obtaining good charge transport behavior at the interface. So that the smooth surface with fine homogeneity of the ITO/ZnO/sarcosine film is favorable for electron transport, which can effectively promote the increase of JSC and FF. To gain more insight into the influence of sarcosine on the surface characteristics of ZnO, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the ZnO and ZnO/sarcosine films on quartz glass substrates were measured using a 325 nm excitation source and they are shown in Fig. 5a. A strong PL emission peak at about 540 nm is observed for the ZnO film, which corresponds to the excitation peak of oxygen vacancy surface defects. Oxygen vacancies can serve as potential electron wells, which can capture one or two electrons for each vacancy, thus increasing the electron recombination probability. The PL spectra of ZnO modified with sarcosine have a marked decrease, which contributes to the improved interface electron extraction ability. It means that the surface defects of ZnO can be dramatically reduced by introducing sarcosine.
To confirm the influence of interfacial surface characteristics on the quality of the active layer, the morphology of the active layer processed on different ETLs is characterized by AFM. As shown in Fig. 4b, the morphology of the active layer processed on the ITO film has some molecular aggregates with a RMS surface roughness of 5.07 nm. The morphologies of the active layers processed on the ITO/sarcosine and ITO/ZnO films are similar, which have bigger molecular aggregates with great RMS surface roughness values of 6.83 and 7.05 nm, respectively. A more homogeneous and smoother surface morphology can be observed from the AFM images of the active layer processed on the ITO/ZnO/sarcosine films, where the RMS surface roughness is down to 1.76 nm. This result reveals that the ZnO/sarcosine double ETLs can effectively modulate the morphology of the active layer, which may result in enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and charge transport in the derived devices. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was performed to gain deeper insights into the effect of the interfacial surface characteristics on the quality of the active layer films. The out of plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) direction GIXD profiles of the active layer on the different substrates of ITO/ETLs are plotted in Fig. 5b and c. All the active layers on different substrates exhibit relatively obvious (100) diffraction peaks at about 0.23 Å−1 in the OOP direction and relatively weak (010) diffraction peaks at about 1.60 Å−1 in the OOP direction, and the (100) diffraction peaks at about 0.37 Å−1 in the IP direction. These results suggest that the 3D texture of the molecular arrangement in the active layer exists with the co-existence of face-on and edge-on molecular arrangements. The (100) and (010) diffraction peaks represent the lamellar structure and the π-π packing direction, respectively. The (010) diffraction peak intensity in the OOP direction of the blend film is increased by spin coating sarcosine on the ITO substrate, indicating that the π-π packing of the face-on molecular arrangement becomes more ordered. The more ordered face-on molecular arrangement is beneficial for charge transport along the normal direction of the substrate. The (100) diffraction peak intensity in the OOP direction is enhanced by adding ZnO on the ITO substrate, indicating that the lamellar structure of the edge-on molecular arrangement becomes more ordered. The more ordered edge-on molecular arrangement is beneficial for charge transport along the parallel direction of the substrate. The (100) and (010) diffraction peak intensities in the OOP direction are enhanced by adding ZnO/sarcosine on the ITO substrate, indicating that the 3D texture of the molecular arrangement becomes more ordered. The enhanced 3D texture of the molecular arrangement may provide more efficient charge transport channels in the active layer. To explore the energy level match between ITO modified by different ETLs and the active layer, the CPDs of ITO/ETLs were measured by KPFM. The captured CPD images and the CPD data are reported in Fig. S2. The WFs were estimated by assigning the value of 4.70 eV to the WF of ITO as determined. The mean data of WFs and CPDs for ITO modified with different ETLs are shown in Table S3 and Fig. 6a. The WF of the ITO electrode is decreased from 4.70 eV to 4.53 eV or 4.49 eV by either ZnO or sarcosine modification. The WF of the ITO electrode is further reduced to 4.28 eV by ZnO/sarcosine double ETL modification. A simplified energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 6b. The lowest WF of ITO/ZnO/sarcosine is more matched to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of BTP-BO-4CL (∼4.09 eV). The WF of ITO/ZnO/sarcosine is farthest away from that of the anode Ag by MoO3 modification. As a result, the increased WF difference between the anode Ag by MoO3 modification and the cathode ITO by ZnO, sarcosine or ZnO/sarcosine modification can result in increased built-in potentials and enhanced VOCs. The increased built-in potential can play an important role in charge transport and collection, which can effectively promote the increase of JSC and FF.
The J–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices under dark conditions were measured to characterize the charge transport properties of OSCs with different ETLs. The charge mobility was fit to the SCLC model. The structures of the hole-only and electron-only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ETLs/active layers/PDIN/Al, respectively. The corresponding ln(Jd3/V2) − (V/d)0.5 curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices are displayed in Fig. S5 and Fig. 7a, respectively. The hole mobility (μh) in the active layer is 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μe values and the ratios of μh/μe for the active layers processed on ITO modified by different ETLs are summarized in Table 4. The μe values of the active layers processed on the ITO films are only 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the corresponding ratio of μh/μe is 3.5. The μe values of the active layers processed on the ITO/sarcosine or ITO/ZnO films are increased to 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and ITO/ZnO films are increased to 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μe value of the active layers processed on the ITO/ZnO/sarcosine film is further increased to 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ratios of μh/μe for the active layers processed on the ITO/sarcosine, ITO/ZnO, or ITO/ZnO/sarcosine films are 2.6, 1.6, and 1.2, respectively. The increased μe values and more balanced μh/μe ratios of the active layers processed on the ITO/ZnO/sarcosine film should contribute to the improvement of FF and the JSC of the corresponding OSCs. As discussed above, the increased electron mobility is attributed to the optimized morphology, the more ordered molecular arrangement of the active layer, and better matched energy level between ITO modified with different ETLs and the active layer. To further investigate the effect of sarcosine as an interfacial layer on the charge transport in the active layer, the PL spectra of the active layer processed on different ETLs on quartz glass substrates were measured and they are shown in Fig. 7b. The PL spectra were excited with 650 nm light. Compared with the ZnO/active layer film, the PL intensity of the sarcosine/active layer film is markedly quenched, suggesting that the surface defect of sarcosine is smaller than that of ZnO. Compared with the bare active layer and ZnO/active layer, the PL intensities are quenched by inserting sarcosine. It means that the introduction of sarcosine could reduce charge recombination and enhance electron transport into the electrode.

To further investigate the influence of ETLs for the charge transport properties on the OSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at an applied bias of VOC in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under one standard simulated sunlight illumination. The Nyquist plots of the OSCs with different ETLs are shown in Fig. 7c. All Nyquist plots showed a single semicircle in the complex plot of the imaginary part versus the real part of the complex impedance. The Nyquist plot data were fitted to the corresponding equivalent circuit model, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7c. The equivalent circuit is composed of an Ohmic series resistance (ROS) and a parallel combination of a charge transfer resistance (RCT) and a constant phase element (CPE). The fitted resistances are summarized in Table 4. The ROS arises from the electrode resistances and the bulk resistances in the active layer, which is illustrated by the starting point of Nyquist plots. All OSCs with different ETLs exhibit small and similar ROS. The RCT is the charge transport resistance inside of the active layer and electrode/active layer interfaces, which can be illustrated by the semicircle radii of Nyquist plots. The OSCs without ETL exhibit relatively large RCT values of 278 Ω, indicating more charge transport obstruction and lower FF. The RCT values are decreased to 81 Ω, 53 Ω, and 29 Ω for OSCs with sarcosine, ZnO, or ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs. The lowest RCT value in the OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as an ETL may be ascribed to the optimized morphology of active layers, and the improved compatibility between the active layer and ETLs. The low RCT could promote the charge transport from the active layer to the electrode, which may result in higher FF. The CPE in an equivalent circuit is a capacitance-like element, which shows the non-ideal behavior of the capacitor resulting from the dispersive charge transport in cells. The CPE is defined by CPE-T and CPE-P, which are a capacitance value and an inhomogeneous constant with a varying range (0–1), respectively. If CPE-P = 0, the CPE can be regarded as a pure resistor. If CPE-P = 1, the CPE is identical to an ideal capacitor without grain boundaries and defects at the donor/acceptor interface. All CPE-P values are greater than 0.98 for OSCs with different ETLs, which suggests the ideal interfacial capacitance at the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl interface. The average carrier lifetime (τ) in the active layer can be calculated using the equation: τ = RCT × CPE-T. A charge transfer time of 5.3 μs for OSCs without ETL is larger than that for OSCs with ETL. The enlarged transfer time will result in the increased charge recombination, which may be one of the main reasons for the low FF for OSCs without ETL. The charge transfer time of OSCs without ETL or with ZnO as ETLs are reduced to 251 ns and 20 ns from 5.3 μs and 58 ns by the addition of sarcosine. These results indicate that charge recombination can be significantly suppressed by introducing sarcosine on the surface of ITO or ITO/ZnO, which can improve charge collection from the active layer to the electrode. To gain more insight into charge recombination, EIS was carried out at an applied bias of VOC in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz in the dark. The Nyquist plots of the OSCs with different ETLs are shown in Fig. 7d. The Nyquist plot data were fit to the corresponding equivalent circuit model, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7d. The charge recombination resistance (RREC) represents the carrier recombination resistance which depends only on the nonradiative recombination in the device, as there is no photon generation in the dark. The fitted RREC values are summarized in Table 4. The OSCs without ETLs or with ZnO as ETLs exhibit relatively small RREC values of 403 Ω and 446 Ω, respectively. The RREC values are increased to 524 Ω and 665 Ω by inserting sarcosine as ETLs on the surface of ITO or ITO/ZnO. The higher RREC values mean smaller charge recombination probability, which may be due to the reduced surface defects by introducing sarcosine. The influence of sarcosine modification on the charge recombination process in OSCs was studied by measuring the J–V curves of the OSCs with ZnO or ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs at different light intensities (Plight). According to the J–V curves, the dependence of JSC and VOC on the light intensity is shown in Fig. S6. In general, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity follows the power-law (JSC ∝ (Plight)S), where S is the exponential factor. Weak bimolecular recombination in the active layers would result in a linear relationship between JSC and Plight with S close to 1. The S values of the fitted lines in logarithmic coordinates are 0.95 and 0.97 for the OSCs with ZnO or ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination in OSCs can be suppressed by introducing sarcosine between ZnO and the active layer. The relationship of VOC dependence on Plight determines the degree of trap-assisted recombination, which can be evaluated using the formula: VOC ∝ n(kT/q)ln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and n is the ideality factor under illumination and presents the recombination dynamics in the device. The slope of the VOC – Plight curve could be higher than kT/q when the trap-assisted recombination is involved. The slope of OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs (1.22nkT/q) is smaller than that of the OSCs with ZnO as ETLs (1.47nkT/q), which implies that the OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as ETLs have less trap-assisted recombination. These results indicate that the bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination can be effectively suppressed by introducing sarcosine between ZnO and the active layer. These results can account for the higher JSC and FF values for the devices with sarcosine modified ZnO as ETLs.

In summary, a series of OSCs with different ETLs were fabricated with PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl as active layers. The OSCs without ETLs achieved a PCE of 3.86% with a JSC of 22.65 mA cm−2, a FF of 41.61%, and a VOC of 0.41 V. The PCE of OSCs with sarcosine as ETLs increased to 13.53% with a synergistically improved JSC of 26.10 mA cm−2, FF of 63.21% and VOC of 0.82 V. The OSCs with ZnO as ETLs achieved a PCE of 14.85% with a JSC of 25.92 mA cm−2, a FF of 68.19% and a VOC of 0.84 V. The PCE of OSCs with ZnO/sarcosine as double ETLs increased to 16.45%, benefiting from the synergistically improved JSC of 26.65 mA cm−2, FF of 72.64% and VOC of 0.85 V. A series of analyses show that the introduction of sarcosine on the surface of ITO or ITO/ZnO can result in a lower WF of ITO or ITO/ZnO, a passivated ZnO surface, a reduced surface defect of ZnO, an improved compatibility between ITO or ITO/ZnO and the active layer, an optimized morphology and a more ordered molecular arrangement. Eventually, the OSCs, after the modification of sarcosine on the surface of ITO or ITO/ZnO, suppressed charge recombination and promoted charge transport and collection. This work demonstrates that sarcosine has great potential as an ETL to improve the performance of OSCs.
