As a rising star of third-generation photovoltaic technology, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have exhibited high power conversion efficiency. However, the most investigated high-performance perovskites contain toxic lead, which may hinder their widespread applications. Among various alternative metal ions to replace lead for environmentally benign perovskites, tin has been successfully used in PSCs with the highest efficiency over 13% at present, making tin-based perovskites the most promising active materials for lead-free PSCs. In this review, we first summarize the device design of PSCs and the physical properties of tin-based perovskites. Then we state the major challenges for this field and discuss the essential techniques in film preparation. Specifically, tin rich conditions (tin halide) and suitable reducing agents are needed in the film preparation to prohibit Sn2+ oxidation, and solvent modulation is a feasible approach for controlling the film morphology. Meanwhile, chemical substitutions of A site and B site cations and X site anions to improve the optoelectronic properties of tin-based perovskites are comprehensively addressed. Moreover, tin–lead mixed perovskites that contain less lead than conventional perovskites for high-performance PSCs and tandem solar cells are discussed. This comprehensive review can shed light on the development of environmentally friendly PSCs and provide a guideline for realizing lead-free PSCs with high efficiency and stability via synergistic approaches.

With the increasing demand for clean and renewable energy, photovoltaic technology, which converts solar energy into electricity directly, has attracted more and more attention in recent years. As one type of third generation solar cell, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on metal halide perovskite materials have been considered to be one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies due to the rapid development of their power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.5% in the past decade, low cost and facile solution-based fabrication process. It is expected that the PSC market can reach USD 2.35 billion by 2026 with a market growth rate of 32.0% per year.

An organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite material was first reported by T. Miyasaka et al. in 2009. Generally, metal halide perovskites have a formula of ABX3, where A is an organic (CH3NH3+, MA, or HC(NH2)2+, FA) or alkali metal (Cs+) cation, B is a divalent metal (Pb, Sn or Ge) and X is a halide anion. The B site cations are octahedrally coordinated by six X anions while the A cations reside at the eight corners of the cubic unit, as shown in Fig. 1a. To stabilize the 3-dimensional (3D) perovskite structure, it is necessary to have a suitable empirical Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t), i.e. t = (RA + RX)/[21/2(RB + RX)], where RA, RB and RX are the ionic radii of the A, B and X ions, respectively. The tolerance factor should range from 0.813 to 1.107, otherwise the cubic crystal structure is unstable. The tolerance factor of a series of common halide perovskites is shown in Fig. 1b. Analysis of this tolerance factor is helpful for understanding the structural transition in compositional engineering of perovskite materials. Excellent optoelectronic properties, like long carrier recombination lifetime, small effective masses of electrons and holes, wide absorption of light and high carrier mobility, come from this 3D perovskite structure. On the other hand, adopting alkylammonium cations in the A position will result in a layered 2-dimensional (2D) perovskite structure (Ruddlesden–Popper [RP] phase). The RP phase layered perovskite has a general formula of L2An−1BnX3n+1, where L is a large cation (such as phenethylammonium C8H9NH3+ [PEA+], and butylammonium C4H9NH3+ [BA+]) and n is an integer. Another low dimensional perovskite structure is the Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type, which features divalent (2+) interlayer spacers. Moreover, a new type of low dimensional perovskite, which adopts two different alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI), was reported in 2017. The ACI type perovskites have a formula of A′AnBnX3n+1, where two A cations and one larger A′ cation alternatively occupy the interlayer space.
Among various kinds of perovskites, Pb2+ is still indispensable for guaranteeing excellent photoelectric properties. However, the degradation products of lead-based perovskites can be toxic to the environment, humans and other species, which impedes the commercialization of this technology. Therefore, less toxic lead-free perovskite light absorbers have attracted much attention recently. Tin has been considered as a less toxic alternative to lead, which comes from the same group 14 (IVA) of the periodic table as lead. Moreover, tin-based perovskites have optical bandgaps ranging from 1.2–1.4 eV, which is very close to the optimum bandgap (1.34 eV) for the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit under the AM 1.5 solar spectrum. Thus, tin-based perovskites are expected to find promising applications in photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices.
Tin-based halide perovskites were first introduced as conducting channels for thin film field-effect transistors more than twenty years ago. In 2012, a tin-based perovskite was used as a light absorber for Schottky solar cells and a champion PCE of 0.9% was achieved. In 2014, Noel et al. and Hao et al. reported tin-based PSCs almost at the same time, and a promising PCE of around 6% was obtained. Researchers are encouraged by these initial results and tin-based PSCs have undergone rapid progress in the past few years. For example, low dimensional tin-based PSCs have reached a PCE over 9%. The major problem for tin-based PSCs is the poor air stability due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Thus, lots of approaches have been developed to prohibit the oxidation of tin-based perovskites during device fabrication and operation. Recently, many unique techniques have been developed, leading to a rapid efficiency increase of tin-based PSCs as shown in Fig. 1c. Currently, tin-based PSCs demonstrate a maximum PCE over 13% together with excellent device stability, making them a very attractive photovoltaic technology to be further developed in the near future.
In this review, we introduce the features of tin-based perovskites, including the basic properties and the device design of PSCs, at the beginning. Then, several promising approaches recently developed for improving the performance of tin-based PSCs are reviewed in the following three sections. First, the incorporation of tin compensators (tin salts) and reducing agents to improve the device stability is summarized. Second, useful solvents and additives for improving the film morphology based on different mechanisms are reviewed. Third, compositional engineering as a facile way to modify the properties of perovskites to enhance the device performance is described, focusing on the effects of both 2D/3D crystal structures and representative cations/anions in tin-based PSCs. In the next part, considering the difficulty to replace lead completely in PSCs, we review an emerging hot topic about Sn–Pb mixed PSCs that contain less lead while exhibiting comparable photovoltaic performance to lead-based PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1d. Sn–Pb mixed perovskite materials show extended absorption to the near infrared (NIR) region and hold great promise for tandem solar cells. In addition, the toxicity and encapsulation techniques of tin-based PSCs are addressed, which are critical to practical applications. Finally, a conclusion and outlook are provided to describe the future development of stable and high-performance tin-based PSCs.

As shown in Fig. 2a and b, PSCs are usually prepared with two types of device structures, i.e. the normal structure and inverted structure, which primarily consist of a transparent electrode mainly made of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) like indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), a perovskite layer, an electron transport material (ETM) and a hole transport material (HTM). The normal structure can be further divided into mesoporous and planar structures, while the inverted structure is usually planar. Generally, when a perovskite layer is illuminated by sunlight, electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) and holes are left in the VB. Then, the generated electrons and holes transfer/diffuse to each interface and are injected into the ETM and HTM, respectively. Here, the CB and VB of the perovskite should form proper energy level alignments with the charge transport layers. In addition, charge transport layers with high carrier mobilities are preferred to ensure efficient charge transport across them. Finally, electrons and holes are collected by cathode and anode electrodes and transported to external circuitry.


For a normal structure, large-bandgap metal oxide semiconductors, such as TiO2 and SnO2, are usually used as ETMs. The mesoporous normal structure has a mesoporous layer on a thin compact layer, which acts as both an electron transport layer (ETL) and a scaffold layer to absorb the perovskite films. The normal mesoporous structure has the advantage of tolerating a poor film morphology and short carrier diffusion length to avoid device short-circuit, which is usually used for newly investigated light absorbers. Some initial work on tin-based PSCs adopted the mesoporous structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. In the case of the planar normal structure, a long carrier diffusion length and high quality perovskite morphology are needed. Ma and co-workers reported the first planar normal structure device for tin-based PSCs with an architecture of FTO/blocking TiO2/MASnI3/poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA)/Au and a moderate PCE of 0.32% was obtained. However, tin-based PSCs with normal structures always exhibit relatively low efficiencies due to some drawbacks difficult to overcome. For example, the dopants, like lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), which are added into spiro-OMeTAD to enhance its hole mobility, can cause damage to the underneath tin-based perovskite films. In addition, Ti–O–Sn bonds are formed at the interface between TiO2 and tin-based perovskites, which causes charge carrier recombination.


Perplexed by the negative issues of normal structures, researchers have turned to developing an inverted structure, which shows advantages of low-cost, simple fabrication and suppressed hysteresis. Wang and co-workers first reported inverted planar CsSnI3 solar cells with a structure of ITO/NiOx/CsSnI3/PCBM/Al and a promising PCE of 3.31% was achieved, which is much higher than that based on a normal structure. At the same time, Liao et al. reported planar inverted FASnI3 solar cells with an architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/FASnI3/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag and a high PCE of 6.22% was acquired. Notably, the energy level alignment at the interfaces of the perovskite and charge transport layers can greatly affect the device performance. Liu and co-workers introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) to tune the work function of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2c), which was reduced from 5.1 eV to 4.79 eV. Benefiting from the better energy level match between FASnI3 and the HTM, the efficiency was increased from 2.01% to 5.12%. Thus far the highest reported PCE for tin-based PSCs is based on an inverted structure.


Besides the perovskite layer, the device performance of PSCs is greatly influenced by the physical properties of the charge transport materials, including the ETMs and HTMs. Compared with lead-based perovskites, the CB and VB of tin-based perovskites exhibit large variation, leading to inevitable energy alignment mismatch and a severe voltage loss of the open circuit voltage (VOC). Hence, it is crucial to optimize the energy band alignment of the devices for performance enhancement.


The ETM plays a decisive role in high-performance PSCs, which should not only transport photo-generated electrons but also minimize interfacial charge recombination. In order to decrease the conduction band offset, Yokoyama and co-workers introduced niobium oxide (Nb2O5) as the ETM in FASnI3 PSCs with a planar normal structure. Compared with TiO2, the conduction band offset between Nb2O5 and FASnI3 is close to zero, resulting in an increased VOC from 0.27 V to 0.42 V. Fullerene and its derivatives are common ETMs for inverted PSCs. Lee et al. compared fullerene (C60), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as ETMs for FA0.9PEA0.1SnI3 solar cells. Among them, ICBA has the highest energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leading to a minimized energy offset with the CB of the FA0.9PEA0.1SnI3 perovskite (Fig. 2d). Consequently, PSCs with the ICBA ETM exhibited a high VOC of 0.651 V, which is 0.161 and 0.248 V higher than those employing PCBM and C60 as the ETMs, respectively.


Considering that the dopants of spiro-OMeTAD could decompose tin-based perovskites, many other HTMs have been used in tin-based PSCs by several groups recently. For example, Ke and co-workers prepared small molecule tetrakis-triphenylamine (TPE) as a dopant-free HTM for tin-based PSCs. Benefiting from the suitable energy band alignment and excellent hole transport properties, the champion device exhibited a PCE of 7.23%. As for the inverted structure, the commonly used PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic, which can result in deteriorated device stability in air. Thus, HTMs on the bottom should be optimized. For example, Cao et al. introduced copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) with suitable band alignment as an HTM for FASnI3 solar cells, and a promising PCE of 7.34% was achieved. In another study, Liao and co-workers used NiOx as a hole extraction layer for low-dimensional tin-based PSCs, leading to an efficiency of 5.94%. Considering the big voltage losses normally observed in tin-based PSCs, the interface properties between tin-based perovskites and charge transport layers are yet to be optimized. Thus, HTMs that can specifically match the band structure of tin-based perovskites with a low density of interface states are urgently needed in this field.


Because of the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ (to be discussed later), timely encapsulation of tin-based PSCs is highly needed to avoid oxygen contamination and thereby improve the long-term device stability. Airtight encapsulation of photovoltaic devices can prevent the permeation of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite layers, which is a feasible way to enhance the operation stability of the devices. The encapsulation materials should have good processability, high light transmission and good resistance to ultraviolet (UV) degradation and thermal oxidation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used to encapsulate perovskite layers to enhance the humidity stability of PSCs. However, the ALD process is expensive and may increase the complexity of fabrication. Other common encapsulation methods include roll lamination (the devices are encapsulated by two adhesive sheets), heat sealing (thermal energy is introduced to soften the sealants for encapsulation) and coverage of a piece of glass sealed by UV-curable epoxy. Currently, most tin-based PSCs are sealed by cavity glass with UV curable glues, while encapsulation techniques for large area devices are yet to be developed.


It has been recognized that the major problem for tin-based PSCs is the poor air stability. In tin-based perovskite films, Sn2+ can be easily oxidized to Sn4+ and lead to high density p-type doping. Oxidized perovskite layers normally show a short carrier lifetime and high nonradiative carrier recombination rate, which is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Thus, the underlying mechanism for this issue and approaches for ameliorating the stability of tin-based perovskites will be discussed in this section.


Located in the same IVA group as Pb, Sn is one of the most promising metals that can replace toxic Pb in perovskites. Theoretical calculations indicate that tin-based perovskites ASnX3 (A = MA, FA or Cs, X = halide) should have excellent optoelectronic properties (like high carrier mobility, strong light absorption and direct bandgaps) suitable for solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. So tin-based perovskites have attracted much attention recently mainly due to the potential application in lead-free PSCs.

It has been reported that MASnI3 has an optical bandgap of 1.2–1.4 eV, which enables a much broader absorption spectrum compared with that of the MAPbI3 counterpart (Fig. 3a). Through fluorescence quenching measurements, Lin et al. estimated the carrier diffusion length in an MASnI3 film, which can be as long as 500 nm. Snaith et al. first reported entire lead-free PSCs based on MASnI3. They used a traditional normal structure with mesoporous TiO2 as a scaffold, achieving a PCE of 6.40%.
Similar to the case in lead perovskites, FA+ is another highly investigated organic cation in tin-based perovskites. Although FAPbI3 has multiple phases (yellow δ phase and dark α phase), FASnI3 has only one stable black phase (cubic structure). Besides, because of the large cation size of FA, FASnI3 has a larger bandgap than that of MASnI3 (Fig. 3a). In 2015, Koh et al. used FASnI3 as a light absorbing layer for PSCs and a high current density of 24.45 mA cm−2 was achieved due to broad light harvesting from the UV to the infrared region.
Recently, all-inorganic lead-free CsSnI3 has also attracted intensive investigation. Typically, CsSnI3 has two polymorphs at room temperature; one is the yellow phase (Y) with a 1-D double-chain structure, and the other is black (B-γ) with a 3D perovskite structure. The Y phase can be changed to the black cubic phase (B-α) when the former is heated above 425 K under an inert environment. With the temperature going down, the black cubic perovskite phase (B-α) gradually changes to the black tetragonal phase (B-β) at 426 K and black orthorhombic phase (B-γ) at 351 K. The phase transformation of CsSnI3 is illustrated in Fig. 3b. Moreover, the B-γ CsSnI3 phase will be oxidized to Cs2SnI6 after exposure to air. The black B-γ phase of CsSnI3 has a direct bandgap of ∼1.3 eV and high carrier mobilities, making it a promising material for solar cell applications. The potential of CsSnI3 as an absorber for PSCs was discovered by Mathews et al., and a PCE of 2.02% was obtained by them in 2014.

Point defects are the most common defects in perovskite materials, which include vacancies, interstitials and anti-site occupation. The outer ns2 electron structure of metal ions has a great influence on the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. Unlike Pb2+, the very active 5s2 electrons of Sn2+ undergo easy oxidization to Sn4+ in ambient air and form Sn vacancies (VSn) in the crystal lattice of a perovskite, resulting in shallow traps close to the valence band. A high density of Sn vacancies will lead to serious p-type doping of the material and a limited carrier diffusion length. Based on theoretical calculations, Zhao et al. reported that the A-site cation and synthesis conditions could greatly influence the defect states of tin-based perovskites. For MASnI3, VSn was the dominant defect under various synthesis conditions due to the low formation energy of VSn resulting from the strong Sn 5s–I 5p antibonding coupling. Because of the larger ionic size of FA+ and longer Sn–I bond, the Sn 5s–I 5p antibonding coupling in FASnI3 is weaker than that in MASnI3, resulting in a higher VSn formation energy in FASnI3. Thus, the conductivity of FASnI3 can be regulated from p-type to intrinsic under a Sn-rich synthesis environment while MASnI3 has high p-type conductivity regardless of the conditions of synthesis. Besides, halide interstitials and anti-site substitutions can also be common point defects in tin-based perovskites.

Defects on the surfaces of perovskite grains play an important role in the optoelectronic properties of tin-based perovskites. Due to the easy loss of tin ions on grain surfaces, the undercoordinated I ions may result in deep level traps in the bandgap. These deep trap states will cause nonradiative carrier recombination, leading to the loss of photogenerated carriers in the perovskite materials. Besides, the fast crystallization process of tin-based perovskites (we will give a detailed discussion in the morphology control section) will generate film defects like pinholes, cracks and impurities. These film defects will also cause serious carrier recombination and negatively influence the photovoltaic performance of tin-based PSCs.

To improve the stability of tin-based perovskites, SnX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I, SCN) has been introduced as an essential additive in film deposition, which is a typical reducing agent that can prohibit the oxidation of perovskites. More importantly, SnX2 additives enable Sn compensation in the films to lower the probability of tin vacancy formation, reduce the background hole density and improve the film morphology.

SnF2 was first introduced by In Chung et al. to dope CsSnI3 in 2012, which later served as an HTM in all-solid-state dye sensitized solar cells. The addition of SnF2 into CsSnI3 to reduce Sn vacancies was first demonstrated by Kumar et al. in 2014, which makes CsSnI3 less conductive, and consequently a high current density of 22 mA cm−2 was achieved in PSCs. They found that with 20 mol% excess SnF2 doping, the carrier density dropped 2 orders of magnitude compared with that of pristine CsSnI3. In 2015, the same group investigated the effects of doping SnF2 in FASnI3. With 20 mol% SnF2 doping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data showed the mere presence of Sn2+ without Sn4+, indicating that all tin perovskite samples were unoxidized. The addition of 20 mol% of SnF2 leads to the increase of the current density from 2.14 mA cm−2 to 12.4 mA cm−2, yielding an overall PCE of 1.41% in PSCs based on a normal mesoporous structure. The thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer was further optimized and a best PCE of 2.10% was obtained.
In addition, Min and co-workers showed that SnF2 can be helpful for the crystal growth of tin-based perovskites. Because of its limited solubility, SnF2 will be the first precipitate during the spin-coating process. These SnF2 particles will create more nucleation sites and thus enable more uniform and compact perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 4a. With improved perovskite film quality and reduced carrier recombination, PSCs with 30 mol% SnF2 added to MASnIBr2 show a best PCE of 3.7%. Hartmann et al. studied the impact of SnF2 on the electronic structure of CsSnBr3, and found that the addition of 20 mol% SnF2 could suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Currently, SnF2 is incorporated into most tin-based PSCs to get ideal photovoltaic performance.
SnCl2 is another commonly used reducing agent. Marshall et al. added it into CsSnI3 to improve the device performance of PSCs. Using high-resolution XPS analysis, they found that SnCl2 was presented at the perovskite surface, and the SnCl2 layer could function as a desiccant to improve the stability of CsSnI3 (Fig. 4c). They also analysed the effect of different tin halide additives (SnCl2, SnBr2, SnI2 and SnF2) on PSCs. Devices with a planar architecture (ITO/CsSnI3/PC61BM/BCP/Al) were prepared to find the resultant performance. The devices with the SnCl2 additive exhibited the best PCE of 3.56% and the performance was further improved substantially after storage in nitrogen. Improved crystallization of the fullerene electron transport layer (PCBM) under light illumination during device characterization and n-type doping of PCBM by SnCl2 may contribute to the performance improvement. Very recently, Liu and co-workers added both SnF2 and SnCl2 to enhance the performance of Cs0.2FA0.8SnI3 PSCs. The excess SnF2 and SnCl2 can form an amorphous polycrystalline structure layer outside the perovskite polycrystals (Fig. 4b), which blocks the diffusion of outer moisture and oxygen. The champion device exhibits a certified efficiency of 10.08%. The devices also demonstrate outstanding stability, which retain over 95% of the original efficiency after 1000 h under simulated solar illumination of AM 1.5G.
SnI2 was also used as an excess tin source to compensate the missing Sn2+. Hatton et al. prepared CsSnI3 perovskite films with extra SnI2 in the precursor solution. Their devices have an inverted planar structure with CuI as the HTM and fullerene as the ETM. The devices with excess SnI2 exhibited a best VOC of ∼0.55 V, which was twice that of a previous CsSnI3 based PSC. They also pointed out that the energy alignment at the CsSnI3/fullerene interface has a great effect on the open circuit voltage. An increase in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene ETM contributes to the increase of the device VOC, which is consistent with a reduction in the energy lost when electrons move from CsSnI3 to the ETM as previously proved in organic solar cells.
Heo and co-workers studied the effect of different SnX2 additives on the photovoltaic performance and device stability of CsSnI3 based PSCs, and found that SnBr2 was the best additive for CsSnI3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible absorption spectra also indicated that SnBr2 is the most effective additive in stabilizing the B-γ CsSnI3 phase, and the device with SnBr2 showed the highest PCE of 4.30% and enhanced stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the SnX2 additive tends to occupy interstitial sites to stabilize the B-γ CsSnI3 phase and SnBr2 is the most effective one (Fig. 4d). On the other hand, SnX2 shows the function of surface passivation by forming an adsorption layer on the CsSnI3 slab, and the adsorption energy of SnBr2 is the largest. Thus, SnBr2 is a suitable additive for CsSnI3 to improve both the device performance and stability.
In summary, SnX2 additives have been widely used as Sn2+ compensators to decrease tin vacancies in perovskite films and enhance the photovoltaic performance of tin-based PSCs. Among them, SnF2 is most widely used during the preparation of tin-based perovskites, while the actual effect of each one could be dependent on the film composition and preparation conditions, especially organic solvents. Although those SnX2 additives have pronounced effects on the performance enhancement, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be investigated in depth in the future.

Because of the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, reducing agents should be introduced during the preparation of tin-based perovskites to suppress the oxidization. Meanwhile, some reducing agents can also improve the perovskite film morphology. Besides SnX2, many other reducing agents, such as Sn powder, hydrazine (N2H4) compounds and gallic acid, have been successfully used in devices with promising effects.

SnI2 used in the preparation of tin-based perovskites can be easily oxidized by air and adding metallic tin to SnI2 solution to prevent its oxidation is a convenient approach. Low purity SnI2 employed in the preparation can lead to high doping levels and greatly affect the photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices. Gu et al. firstly used Sn powder to purify low purity SnI2 (99%) to reduce the Sn4+ content. Sn powder was added to the perovskite precursor solution and stirred for about 5 hours to ensure the completion of the following redox reaction: Sn4+ + Sn → 2Sn2+. After the Sn powder treatment, the PSCs show the best PCE of 6.75% with a VOC of 0.58 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.3%. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated device showed good shelf stability, retaining 90% of its original PCE after storing in a glovebox for 860 h. This work provides a cost-effective way to purify the SnI2 source and improve the device performance.
Hydrazine is a well-recognized reducing agent and has been previously used in copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells. Song et al. introduced hydrazine vapors (Fig. 5a) during the preparation of MASnI3 perovskites. It is found that the ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+ is dramatically reduced under a hydrazine vapor atmosphere. With a normal structure using a mesoporous TiO2 layer as a substrate, MASnI3 based PSCs showed a PCE of 3.89%. Then, the same group prepared CsSnI3-based solar cells under a hydrazine vapor atmosphere, achieving a PCE of 4.81%. In addition, the influence of the AI/SnI2 ratio (A = Cs, FA and MA) on the device performance was investigated, and just FASnI3 shows normal function close to the stoichiometric ratio. This may indicate that the formation energy of Sn2+ vacancies is the highest in FASnI3. In another study, Kayesh and co-workers added hydrazinium chloride (N2H5Cl) to the precursor solvents to prepare FASnI3 perovskite films. Hydrazine compounds can release electrons to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, the chloride ions from N2H5Cl can form an intermediate, which will lead to larger perovskite grains. With 2.5 mol% N2H5Cl doping, a PSC with an inverted planar structure exhibited a PCE of 5.4%. In terms of stability, the PSCs with N2H5Cl retained 65% of the initial PCE after storage in a glovebox for 1000 h, while the control device degraded to failure after 850 h. More recently, Wang et al. incorporated phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) with a reductive hydrazine group into an FASnI3 film to enhance the device performance. As a result, the XRD pattern demonstrated an obvious decline in the diffraction angle, indicating that PH+ is incorporated into the crystal lattice. The champion device shows a PCE of 11.4% along with good stability.
In recent work, Jiang et al. introduced reducing additive trihydrazine dihydriodide (THDH) into a perovskite precursor solution to reduce the background carrier densities of the resultant perovskite films. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectrum suggested that one N2H4 molecule in THDH would be evaporated during the preparation of the perovskite film and only N2H5I remained in the final perovskite film. Because of the reducing nature of hydrazine, the oxidation of Sn2+ in the perovskite film was significantly suppressed. Moreover, the remaining N2H5I can interact with the perovskite to improve the morphology of FASnI3 films. Using 99% purity SnI2 as a tin source, the device with 5% THDH exhibits an efficiency of 8.48%. Very recently, He et al. introduced 4-fluorobenzohydrazide (FBH) as an additive to form an antioxidant capping layer on the FASnI3 perovskite film. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed the coordination effect between the CO group of FBH and Sn2+, which favoured the formation of large oriented perovskite grains. Meanwhile, the reduction of Sn4+ by the hydrazide group in FBH was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum. DFT calculations indicated that the energy barrier for oxygen absorption after FBH modification is increased, which could retard the oxidization process of the perovskite. In a normal N2 glovebox (the O2 level is 0.1 parts per million (ppm)), the PCE of the device with an FBH capping layer is increased from 8.34% to 9.47%. Interestingly, under a condition of a higher oxygen level of 100 ppm, the FBH-introduced device showed a PCE of 9.03% while the control device only has a PCE of 4.14% due to serious oxidation.
Similar to hydrazine, piperazine (C4H10N2) was introduced into CsSnI3 to suppress the oxidization of Sn2+. Tze-Bin and co-workers introduced piperazine to the CsSnI3 perovskite precursor and found that the diamine group of piperazine can strongly interact with SnI2 to enhance the perovskite film morphology. Meanwile, 20% piperazine-modified CsSnI3 film showed over 4 orders of magnitude increased resistance than the pristine film, indicating its validity in suppressing the formation of Sn vacancies. Based on the normal mesoporous structure, the best PCE of 3.83% was achieved.
Hypophosphorous acid (HPA) has been used in lead-based perovskites to improve the film quality by reducing the oxidized I2 back to I− and facilitate an improved stoichiometry in the perovskite crystal. For tin-based perovskites, Li et al. reported the effect of HPA on CsSnIBr2. With the addition of HPA solution, the color of the perovskite precursor was changed from bright yellow to dark brown, which may reveal the formation of new compounds. Meanwhile, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements demonstrated an obvious increment in the charge carrier lifetime, which is a sign of reduced tin vacancies. Based on a normal mesoporous structure, an average PCE of 3.0% was achieved.
In another study, Hoshi et al. added 5-ammonium valeric acid (5-AVAI) to enhance the oxidation stability of MASnI3. 5-AVAI has been used in lead-based perovskites to improve the charge-carrier lifetime and device stability by forming (5-AVAI)xMA1−xPbI3. However, the cubic perovskite structure of MASnI3 is retained regardless of the addition of 5-AVAI, which is different from the situation of MAPbI3. The improved oxidation stability may come from the formation of a 5-AVAI layer on the surface of MASnI3, which stems from the hydrogen bonds formed between NH3+ from 5-AVAI and I− ions from the SnI64− octahedra. Similarly, Islam and co-workers used 5-AVAI to enhance the oxidation stability of FASnI3 perovskite films.1H NMR spectra indicated the hydrogen bond interaction between 5-AVAI and iodide from SnI64− octahedra. XPS measurements revealed the existence of 5-AVAI on the perovskite film surface, which would be beneficial for the enhanced air stability of the perovskite film. Benefiting from enhanced perovskite crystallinity and reduced charge recombination, the device performance is increased from 3.4% to 7.0% with 3 mol% 5-AVAI addition. Recently, Yu and co-workers used 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine hydrochloride (TFEACl) together with SnF2 to improve the efficiency and stability of FASnI3 solar cells. The presence of TFEACl in the perovskite film was confirmed by FTIR and XPS measurements. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films show an obvious shift, which indicates the reduction of the lattice constant and the incorporation of Cl into the crystal lattice. Moreover, the incorporation of Cl can tune the work function of the perovskite films and result in better energy alignment between the perovskites and charge transport layers, which is favourable for charge collection and device performance. With 5 mol% TFECl addition, the device efficiency is increased from 3.63% to 5.3% and the light soaking stability is enhanced as well.
Our group has recently introduced hydroxybenzene salt (KHQSA) as a reducing additive along with excess SnCl2 to enhance the air stability of tin-based PSCs. KHQSA can interact with SnCl2 to form a SnCl2–KHQSA complex, which can in situ encapsulate the perovskite grains to enhance the oxidation resistance of the perovskite film (Fig. 5b). With the introduction of 1.5 mol% KHQSA, the device efficiency is improved from 3.53% to 6.76% (Fig. 5c). Meanwhile, the PSCs without encapsulation can retain 80% of the original PCE after storing in air for more than 500 h (Fig. 5d). Later on, we used ammonium hypophosphite (AHP) as a bifunctional additive to prohibit the oxidation of Sn2+ and simultaneously improve the perovskite film morphology. The interaction of the PO bond in AHP with SnCl2, as confirmed by the FTIR spectrum, can lead to a uniform dispersion of SnCl2 in the perovskite film so as to eliminate phase separation. XPS measurements confirmed that the AHP-modified perovskite films had a much lower Sn4+ ratio, indicating the reducing ability of AHP. Based on an inverted device structure with CuSCN as the HTM, the champion device exhibits a PCE of 7.34% with much enhanced light soaking stability.
Recently, our group introduced antioxidant gallic acid (GA) as an additive along with excess SnCl2 to enhance the performance of FASnI3 solar cells. As confirmed by FTIR and XRD measurements, GA can coordinate with SnCl2 and form a complex that has a uniform distribution on the perovskite grain surface (Fig. 6a). The antioxidant ability of GA comes from the hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the aromatic ring (Fig. 6b), which can donate hydrogen atoms and electrons to scavenge oxygen. Because of the larger bandgap of SnCl2 or the SnCl2–GA complex than that of the FASnI3 film, the SnCl2 layers present on perovskite grains could be an obstacle for achieving high performance of tin-based PSCs. To clarify this issue, the band structures of SnCl2, and SnCl2–GA and SnCl2–KHQSA complex films were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements and the SnCl2–GA complex demonstrates the lowest barrier height for electron tunnelling (Fig. 6c). Moreover, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements indicate that the SnCl2–GA complex has a relatively higher electron mobility than that of the SnCl2–KHQSA complex. The more suitable electronic property of the SnCl2–GA complex is beneficial for enhanced device performance, and the GA-introduced solar cells exhibited a high PCE of 9.03%. Furthermore, due to the antioxidant effect of the SnCl2–GA complex, unencapsulated GA-based solar cells can retain over 80% of their original efficiency after storing in air for 1000 h, which is the best air stability of tin-based PSCs so far (Fig. 6d). This work provides a guideline for selecting antioxidant additives in tin-based PSCs and sheds light on achieving highly stable tin-based PSCs in the future.
In another study, Zhang and co-workers introduced cobaltocene (CoCp2) as an electron donor to suppress the oxidation of the CsSnI3 perovskite. The oxidation of cobalt ions from Co2+ to Co3+ was observed in the XPS scan, suggesting electron transfer from CoCp2 to CsSnI3 to build a reducing environment, which was favourable for the reduction of Sn4+. Based on a mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/NiOx/carbon structure, the device showed a maximum PCE of 3.0%. This work suggests that the introduction of donor elements could be a promising way to suppress Sn2+ oxidation.
In 2020, Nakamura and co-workers prepared Sn(IV)-free FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films by in situ Sn(0) nanoparticle treatments. It was found that 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-dihydropyrazine (TM-DHP) could selectively react with SnF2 over SnBr2 and SnCl2 to form Sn(0) nanoparticles, which resulted from the strong affinity of the trimethylsilyl group in TM-DHP with fluorine atoms. These Sn(0) nanoparticles can reduce SnI4 at the Sn(0) nanoparticle surface to produce a Sn(IV) free perovskite (Fig. 6e). With 1 mol% TM-DHP and 10 mol% SnF2, the champion device showed a PCE of 9.9%. Then, the perovskite surface was post-treated using a Lewis base to reduce interface recombination. Moreover, a thin layer of PC61BM was inserted between the perovskite and C60 to form good energy alignment. Consequently, the PCE was increased to 11.5% and a certified PCE of 11.2% was obtained. This in situ Sn(0) nanoparticle reduction method can be used for other tin-based perovskite optoelectronic devices.
To briefly summarize, the introduction of reducing agents in the precursors of tin-based perovskites is an effective method to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and enhance the device stability (Table 1). There are many reducing agents like metals, acids and hydrazine compounds that can be considered as additives in the device fabrication. Tin powder and nanoparticles have been proven to be effective in tin-based devices, yet the effects of many other metals have not been tested. Hydrazine compounds have been widely used in tin-based perovskites, which can not only suppress Sn2+ oxidation but also reduce Sn4+ back to Sn2+, while they are usually toxic and should be handled carefully. For some other reducing agents like KHQSA and GA, more –OH groups bring higher antioxidant ability and a better effect for performance improvement, which can be a concern in designing novel reducing agents. Further improvement of the stability of tin-based perovskites is expected to be achieved by using more effective reducing agents under optimum fabrication conditions. On the other hand, we need to notice that the reducing agents normally have poor conductivity and too much addition may prohibit charge transfer in the devices. Hence, novel reducing agents with better charge transfer capability are needed.

Preparing a uniform and pinhole free perovskite film is essential to the photovoltaic performance of the resultant PSC. However, Sn2+ has higher Lewis acidity than Pb2+, which results in fast crystallization and leaves pinholes on the perovskite film. The unsatisfactory film quality usually leads to poor device performance or even a short circuit due to the direct contact between the two electrodes through pinholes. Hence, it is of paramount importance to develop effective methods to enhance the morphology of tin-based perovskites for high-performance PSCs.

Solvent engineering has been one of the most effective approaches to preparing high-quality lead-based perovskite films. Briefly, perovskite films are prepared based on Lewis acid–base adducts. The solvents (dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), n-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) etc.) to dissolve MAI and PbI2 are polar aprotic solvents, which can act as Lewis bases. On the other hand, PbI2 is a Lewis acid. Thus, an intermediate phase of MAI·PbI2·DMSO will be formed through the weak chemical interaction, which greatly influences the crystal growth and morphology of perovskite films.
In the case of tin-based perovskites, Hao et al. studied the solvent effects on the crystallization of MASnI3 perovskite films. The preparation of a 3DMSO·SnI2 intermediate phase before the spin-coating procedure can enable homogeneous nucleation and an adjustable perovskite growth rate (Fig. 7a), leading to uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films (Fig. 7b and c). A depleted heterojunction solar cell without a hole transport layer based on a high-quality MASnI3 film was prepared and a photocurrent density up to 21 mA cm−2 and an overall PCE of 3.15% were obtained. In comparison, the devices using DMF only as a solvent often suffered from short circuits. This work highlights the importance of solvent engineering in optimizing the perovskite film morphology. Notably, Sargent and co-workers recently reported that DMSO and Sn2+ experienced an irreversible redox reaction to form dimethylsulfide (DMS) and Sn4+ above 100 °C, which should be avoided in the preparation of tin-based perovskites. Therefore, different solvent systems and new fabrication methods need to be developed.
Liu et al. compared the effect of different antisolvent treatments on the film quality and electrical properties of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films. Among diethyl ether (DE), toluene (TL) and chlorobenzene (CB), CB treatment can result in a uniform perovskite film with reduced charge carrier recombination (Fig. 7d and e). Chlorobenzene has a suitable boiling point and miscibility, which will enable a balance between nucleation and perovskite crystal growth. With an improved perovskite film morphology, the devices exhibited a champion PCE of 9.06%. The temperature of an antisolvent (e.g. chlorobenzene or Ph–Cl) can influence the process of antisolvent treatment because the solvent miscibility can be affected by the temperature. Liu and co-workers systematically studied the effect of the antisolvent temperature on the formation of tin-based perovskite films to improve the film coverage. It was found that hot antisolvent treatment (HAT) can increase the density of nucleation sites, leading to high quality perovskite films without pinholes (Fig. 8a–d). Furthermore, they used solvent vapor annealing (SVA) to increase the crystallite size by annealing the perovskite films in a DMSO vapor atmosphere. By carefully controlling the vapor density of DMSO during SVA treatment, they increased the average grain size from 237 nm to 440 nm and obtained better photovoltaic performance. Combining hot antisolvent treatment and SVA, they obtained a best PCE of 7.2%.
SnF2 is a common Sn compensator to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. However, excess SnF2 can cause phase separation and impair the device performance. Therefore, Lee et al. introduced pyrazine to form a SnF2–pyrazine complex, which can enable the homogeneous dispersion of SnF2. Consequently, a dense FASnI3 film without phase separation was obtained. Moreover, the combination of pyrazine and SnF2 can decrease trap states and consequently improve the performance of the resultant device. With a normal mesoporous structure, the device showed a PCE of 4.8% with good reproducibility. Based on a similar principle, Duyen et al. used trienthyphosphine (TEP) as a Lewis base to interact with Sn2+ in 2D (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites. With a small amount of TEP in the perovskite precursor solution, the perovskite crystallization rate was slowed down and the film morphology was improved. Specifically, solar cells based on (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskite films showed improved stability and retained more than 90% of their original PCE after 1 month. Trimethylamine (TMA) is a soft Lewis base, which can form a SnF2–TMA complex through Lewis acid–base interactions. Based on this principle, Zhu et al. employed TMA to facilitate homogeneous film formation of the FASnI3 perovskite. Using a two-step deposition method, they fabricated planar inverted PSCs and obtained a PCE of 7.09%. Recently, Hu and co-workers used poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as an additive to improve the film quality and electrical properties of FASnI3 perovskite films. The CO bond of PMMA can act as an electron donor to interact with the ammonium group and optimize the film morphology. Moreover, the PMMA modification can reduce the trap density of perovskite films, which is beneficial for the fill factor of the devices. With the addition of PMMA, the photovoltaic performance was increased from 2.78% to 3.62% and the device stability was substantially improved.
To improve the hole transfer between a tin-based perovskite and a hole transport layer, Chen et al. introduced poly[tetraphenylethene3,3′-(((2,2-diphenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)tetraphenylethene] (PTN-Br) into the FASnI3 perovskite precursor to form a bulk heterojunction film. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the interaction between SnI2 and PTN-Br to form Lewis adducts to passivate the trap states of perovskite films (Fig. 8e). Moreover, PTN-Br has suitable energy levels to form a gradient band alignment between the perovskite and the HTM, which may enhance hole transportation and collection in PSCs (Fig. 8f). With the addition of PTN-Br, the device performance was increased from 5.12% to 7.94% and the stability was enhanced. Later, Chen and co-workers introduced poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) to regulate the crystallization of the FASnI3 perovskite. The CO group of EVA could interact with uncoordinated tin atoms to form Lewis acid–base complexation, which can slow down the crystallization rate of FASnI3 and favour orientated growth of perovskite grains. The champion device showed a PCE of 7.72% with prolonged environmental stability.
In recent work, Meng and co-workers used poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to slow down the crystallization rate of the FASnI3 perovskite.1H NMR measurements indicated that hydrogen bonding between PVA molecules and iodide ions is formed in the films. The hydrogen bonding interactions could slow down the crystal growth of FASnI3 films, leading to homogeneous and pinhole-free perovskite films. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interactions at the grain boundary can suppress the migration of iodide ions, leading to enhanced long-term stability of the devices. In addition, the hydroxyl groups in PVA have an antioxidant property, which can be oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids to retard the oxidation of Sn2+. Based on a planar inverted structure, the devices with PVA exhibited a champion efficiency of 8.92%. Interestingly, the encapsulated FASnI3–PVA based devices showed enhanced operational stability with a negligible decay in PCE after 400 h under one sun illumination in ambient air. The much-improved operational stability could be ascribed to the suppressed iodide ion diffusion and the antioxidant property of PVA.
Hayase et al. used Lewis base ethane-1,2-diamine (edamine) post treatment to suppress the charge carrier recombination of tin-based perovskites. The presence of edamine on the perovskite surface was observed from FTIR spectroscopy. The amine group of edamine molecules could stabilize the undercoordinated Sn to reduce charge recombination. XPS measurements indicated that iodide deficiency rather than tin oxidation is the main reason for the large VOC loss. With 0.05 mM edamine post treatment, the champion device exhibited an efficiency of 10.18%, which was one of the highest reported efficiencies for tin-based PSCs at that moment.
Han and co-workers introduced pentafluorophen-oxyethylammonium iodide (FOEI) to regulate the nucleation of the FASnI3 perovskite from the solution/air interface. The FOEI additive can reduce the surface energy of FASnI3 solution, which enables more controllable crystal growth from the solution/air surface, leading to a highly orientated perovskite film. Moreover, the surface-controlled growth leads to shiny smooth perovskite films with much reduced surface roughness. The champion device exhibited a PCE of 10.81% and a certificated efficiency of 10.16% was obtained from an accredited laboratory. This work offers a new strategy to control the crystallization of tin-based perovskites.
More recently, Wu and co-workers used π-conjugated Lewis base molecules to control the crystallization rate of FASnI3 perovskites. They synthesized three π-conjugated Lewis base molecules and found that the electron-donating triphenylamine unit on 2-cyano-3-[5-[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl1]-2-thienyl]-propenoic acid (CDTA) could result in a more stable Lewis adduct during the nucleation process. The coordination reaction between such molecules and Sn2+ components was observed from FTIR spectroscopy. Meanwhile, this coordination could reduce the crystallization rate of the FASnI3 perovskite and lead to pinhole-free perovskite films (Fig. 9a–c). Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the aromatic ring on the CDTA molecule could prevent the permeation of moisture into the perovskite lattice and thus slow down the oxidation process of FASnI3 films. Based on a planar inverted structure, the PSCs with CDTA treatment exhibited a high PCE of 10.17% and a certified PCE of 9.39%. The encapsulated PSCs also demonstrated good light soaking stability, maintaining over 90% of their original PCE after 1000 h. Later on, this group introduced n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) as a growth template for FASnI3 crystals. The templated growth of the FASnI3 perovskite was realized by spin coating PAI solution in mixed chloroform and DMSO solvent on pre-prepared perovskite films. DMSO can dissolve the perovskite crystals near the surface and then the large PAI cation would aggregate around the nucleus of FASnI3 to induce templated growth. The perovskite films prepared by templated growth show preferential orientation along the (100) plane, while the plain perovskite films are randomly orientated. The champion device obtained an efficiency of 11.78% and a certified efficiency of 11.22%.
Islam and co-workers used the post deposition vapor annealing (PDVA) process with MACl to prepare large area tin-based PSCs. Compared with the normal annealing method, this MACl vapor method can lead to uniform and dense FASnI3 films with increased crystallinity and decreased defects. Consequently, the efficiency of the PSCs (area: 1.02 cm2) was increased from 4.18% to 6.33%. In another study, He and co-workers introduced redissolved FASnI3 crystals as a precursor solution to prepare high quality perovskite films. They used a temperature-lowering method to grow bulk FASnI3 crystals and redissolved the FASnI3 crystals to obtain the precursor solution. Meanwhile, an antisolvent free high-vacuum quick-annealing technique was used to fabricate FASnI3 films. Compared with the precursor solution consisting of monomers (FAI and SnI2), the redissolved crystal solution may have more [SnI6]4− cages, which leads to uniform perovskite films with large grains and a low density of deep defects. The champion device exhibited a PCE of 8.9% and a steady-state efficiency of 8.55%. This work provides a unique method for the preparation of high-quality tin-based perovskite layers.
In summary, solvent engineering and additives are effective approaches for modifying the nucleation and crystallization process of tin-based perovskites (Table 2). Additives with Lewis base groups can interact with Sn2+ components to slow down the crystallization rate of tin-based perovskites, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect density. Some reducing agents containing Lewis base groups can also function as morphology mediators. Thus, additives which combine the functions of reducibility and crystallization mediation could result in higher performance enhancement, which should be tackled in the future.

Perovskites feature the advantages of adjustable compositions in the A, B and X sites, which is a useful method to tune their optoelectronic properties and enhance the device stability. For the time being, most of the high-performance lead-based PSCs are based on mixed ion perovskites. Similarly, compositional engineering has been a facile approach for performance improvement in tin-based PSCs.


The A site cations (MA+, FA+ and Cs+) which occupy the central position of the perovskite structure can directly affect the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. Mixing the cations to combine their advantages has been an effective method in component engineering of metal halide perovskites. Ferrare and co-workers demonstrated an FA1−xMAxSnBr3 mixed system for the first time. XRD patterns showed that the cubic lattice of MASnBr3 was retained with the incorporation of FA into the perovskite structure. Surprisingly, the band gap shows continuous reduction from 2.4 eV to ∼1.92 eV when x increases from 0 to 0.82. Such huge energy variation is unusual for cation mixing although it is often observed for X-site anion replacement. Theoretical calculations suggested that MA and/or FA can influence the valence band characteristics of tin-based perovskites, resulting in a widely tunable bandgap. However, the photovoltaic performance of the mixed FA1−xMAxSnBr3 perovskite has not been studied by this group.

Zhao et al. reported the optoelectronic properties of mixed (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3. SnF2 was introduced as an additive to reduce Sn vacancies and DMSO was used as a solvent to slow down the crystallization. Upon the substitution of the MA cation by the larger FA cation, the lattice parameters of (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3 are increased, as indicated by the XRD patterns (Fig. 10a). Meanwhile, the optical bandgaps increase with the increase of the FA content (Fig. 10b). PSCs with an inverted structure, where PEDOT:PSS was used as the hole transport layer, showed the best efficiency when (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3 was used, exhibiting a maximum PCE of 8.12%. The enhanced film morphology and reduced carrier recombination induced by mixed FA and MA cations contribute to the performance enhancement. Later on, Li and co-workers used gas pump treatment to prepare (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3 films for PSCs. Compared with the common antisolvent method, this gas pump treatment technology is more eco-friendly and promising for large-area fabrication (>20 cm2). However, PSCs with a normal structure of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/PTAA/Au show an efficiency of only 1.85%. In another study, Rath et al. prepared an MA rich mixed MA0.75FA0.15PEA0.1SnI3 perovskite, which has an extended wavelength region up to 1000 nm. PSCs based on this triple cation perovskite showed a PCE of 5.0% and relatively good stability, retaining 87% of the original efficiency after more than 5000 h storage in an N2 glovebox.
Apart from the most widely studied MA and FA, other organic cations are also promising in A site component engineering of perovskite materials. Ke and co-workers introduced ethylenediammonium (en) to FASnI3 to produce a hybrid {en}FASnI3 perovskite. Regardless of the relatively large size of en, it could be incorporated into the 3D perovskite structure. Consequently, B and X site atoms are expelled from the perovskite structure, which leads to the formation of a “hollow perovskite” structure. Interestingly, {en}FASnI3 has relatively good optoelectronic properties, such as a tunable bandgap and reduced background carrier density. {en}FASnI3 based PSCs showed a best PCE of 7.14%. Moreover, the unencapsulated {en}FASnI3 device showed much enhanced stability, retaining 50% of its initial efficiency under AM 1.5 G illumination in air for 60 min, while the PSCs with pristine FASnI3 totally degraded after 20 min. Then, this group added en into other tin-based perovskites. With the incorporation of en, MASnI3 showed improved film morphology and optoelectronic properties. Similarly, en can enter the 3D perovskite structure and replace MA to form a hollow structure (Fig. 10c). The {en}MASnI3 based PSCs showed a best PCE of 6.63% with high reproducibility. In addition, similar results were obtained from CsSnI3-based PSCs with the incorporation of en. In brief, the results indicate that the performance and stability of tin-based PSCs can be simultaneously enhanced with the incorporation of suitable cations.
Later, Ke and co-workers further popularized the concept of hollow 3D perovskite structures with large cations other than en. For example, they incorporated diammonium cations propylenediammonium (PN) and trimethylenediammonium (TN) into a perovskite to form a “hollow” structure. With the incorporation of diammonium cations, the 3D structure of FASnI3 was retained while better film morphology and enhanced optoelectronic properties were achieved. Dark current measurements indicated that FASnI3 films with PN and TN had suppressed p-type doping and lower trap-state densities, which were beneficial for improved photovoltaic performance. With a regular mesoporous structure, the solar cells using PN-incorporated FASnI3 showed an optimum PCE of 5.85%, which was twice that of the control device based on pristine FASnI3. Their work suggests that the incorporation of proper diammonium cations such as TN, PN and en into tin-based perovskites can be a promising way for improving the performance of tin-based PSCs.
In an effort to enhance the photovoltaic performance and operational stability of MASnI3 based PSCs, Sergey and co-workers added hydrazinium ions (HAI) to partially substitute MA cations. Notably, MA and HA cations have a similar size (Fig. 10d). Hybrid MA1−xHAxSnI3 was successfully prepared at a small amount of substitution (x < 0.3). Moreover, the introduction of HAI is helpful in achieving uniform and smooth perovskite films. PSCs with an inverted device structure showed a PCE of 2.6% when 20% HAI was introduced. Meanwhile, the MA0.8HA0.2SnI3 film showed much enhanced photostability, which did not degrade after 100 h light exposure because of the suppressed transformation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Later, Li et al. used a cation exchange approach to prepare an MASnI3 film from HASnI3. Briefly, HASnI3 perovskite films were prepared by a solution deposition method, and then an MA atmosphere was introduced to in situ transform the HASnI3 films to MASnI3 films. During the cation displacement process, reducing agent hydrazine would be generated inside the perovskite film to restrain the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Devices based on this two-step processed MASnI3 film showed an efficiency of 7.13%. Recently, Wang and co-workers used similar ion exchange/insertion reactions to prepare MASnI3. In brief, a SnF2/PEDOT:PSS mixture solution was spin-coated onto ITO and then MAI gas was introduced to start the reaction. Solid-state SnF2 and gaseous MAI would undergo an ion exchange reaction to generate SnI2, and MAI gas is further inserted into SnI2 to produce MASnI3. Benefiting from the presence of high concentration SnF2 during the reactions, the obtained MASnI3 films contained a low defect density and the resultant devices based on a planar inverted structure showed a PCE of 7.78%.
Jokar and co-workers added bulky organic cations ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) and butylammonium iodide (BAI) to enhance the photovoltaic properties of the FASnI3 perovskite. The introduction of these bulky cations can enhance the perovskite morphology. Like another organic cation PEAI, BAI can coalesce crystal grains to form continuous films, but some pinholes still exist. On the contrary, uniform and pinhole-free films were observed with the addition of EDAI2. With two ammonium functional groups, the diammonium cations could effectively decrease the crystal growth rate, leading to dense and uniform perovskite films (Fig. 11a). As demonstrated by XPS spectra, the organic cations can also restrain the oxidation of Sn2+, which resulted from the surface passivation by these bulky cations. Based on an inverted planar structure, the PSCs showed increased efficiency from 4.0% to 7.4% when 1% EDAI2 is doped. More interestingly, the efficiency of the encapsulated device was further increased to 8.9% after storage for 1462 h. It was suggested that EDAI2 can slowly passivate the surface defects and relax crystal strain after nearly 1500 h, leading to improved efficiency. Later on, the same group added guanidinium (GA+) to replace FA in tin-based perovskites. It is found that the incorporation of GA+ can decrease defect states and suppress the oxidation of tin. With the presence of SnF2 and EDAI2, PSCs with 20% GA+ incorporation showed a certified PCE of 8.30 ± 0.29%. Meanwhile, the device performance increased gradually during glovebox storage and a maximum efficiency of 9.6% was achieved after 2000 h, which was one of the highest values for FASnI3 based PSCs at that moment.
Malavasi et al. introduced dimethylammonium (DMA) to form MA1−xDMAxSnBr3 perovskites. The crystal structure of the alloyed MA1−xDMAxSnBr3 remains cubic when x ≤ 0.6 and the cell volume increases with increasing ratio of the bigger DMA cation. Moreover, the inclusion of DMA causes an obvious blue shift of the absorbance edge of the alloyed perovskite. Compared to MASnBr3, DMASnBr3 shows much improved air stability, which may come from the hydrogen bonding network or the special electronic structure of this material.
Very recently, Wu and co-workers introduced conjugated amines 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine (PPA) in the FASnI3 perovskite and a high efficiency of 9.61% was achieved. PPA can replace the surface FA or passivate the surface FA vacancies of the perovskite (Fig. 11b). Meanwhile, PPA can decrease the crystallization rate of the perovskite and lead to a larger grain size. Two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) measurements demonstrated that the perovskite films have preferential in-plane (100) orientation after PPA modification, which is favourable for charge transport and extraction. With 15% PPA, the champion device showed a PCE of 9.61%, which was among the highest PCEs of tin-based PSCs at that moment. Interestingly, the PPA-based device shows a self-healing effect. The devices can regain much of their original PCE after being stored in N2 for 24 h, which results from the steric hindrance effect.
Diau et al. introduced 2-hydroxyethylammonium (HEA) into HEAxFA1−xSnI3 to control the crystal structures. It is found that the HEA cations have a great effect on the crystal structure of HEAxFA1−xSnI3, which turns from orthorhombic (x = 0) to rhombohedral (x = 0.2–0.4) and then to a tetragonal 3D structure with vacancies (x ≥ 0.6). The evolution of the crystal structure has a high impact on the optical properties and electronic structures of these perovskites, which greatly affect the photovoltaic performance. With 40% HEAI and 3% EDAI2, solar cells based on the normal structure with a mesoscopic carbon electrode had an efficiency of 3.9%.
Incorporation of Cs+ is a common method to improve the performance of mixed-cation PSCs. Liu et al. investigated the influence of Cs+ incorporation on the properties of tin-based perovskites. With the addition of Cs, a homogenous perovskite film with uniform crystals was obtained as a result of a reduced crystallization rate. The crystal lattice of Cs-incorporated perovskites tends to contract because of the relatively small ionic radius of Cs+. Due to the contracted crystal lattice and denser film, the ambient stability of tin-based perovskites was improved by the incorporation of Cs+. The PCE of PSCs was improved from 0.11% to 1.38% when 20% Cs was incorporated. Later, Wu and co-workers used Cs+ to increase the geometric symmetry of FASnI3 and enhance the thermodynamic stability of FASnI3 perovskites. With the doping of Cs, the XRD peak showed an obvious increase to a higher degree, which confirms that Cs was incorporated into the crystal lattice. Due to the smaller ionic radius of Cs, doping FASnI3 with Cs could regulate the tolerance factor to the cubic phase region and improve the stability of FASnI3 (Fig. 11c). Moreover, DFT calculations indicated that Cs doping could enhance the thermodynamic stability of FASnI3. With 8% CsI addition, the champion device had an efficiency of 6.08% with enhanced device stability, retaining 90% of its original performance after storage in N2 for 2000 h.
Malavasi et al. performed the substitution of Cs+ with rubidium (Rb+) in inorganic Cs1−xRbxSnBr3 perovskites. XRD patterns show that the crystal structure changes from cubic (x = 0) to tetragonal (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) and orthorhombic (x = 0.30), which is also the highest Rb content for single phase compounds. Moreover, the as-synthesized compounds show a clear blue shift of the bandgap with the increase of the Rb content. Interestingly, stability tests show that the mixed compounds have enhanced chemical stability, which are promising for photovoltaic applications. Khadka and co-workers incorporated Rb into FASnI3 to improve the device performance. XRD patterns indicated that Rb was incorporated into the lattice of the FASnI3 crystal. Moreover, the introduction of Rb is favorable for better crystal quality and reduced oxidation of Sn2+. With 8% RbCl doping, the device performance was increased from 3.25% to 5.89%.
Hayase and co-workers studied the relationship between the lattice strain and efficiency of tin-based PSCs with a composition of Q0.1(FA0.75MA0.25)0.9SnI3, where Q is replaced with Na+, K+, Cs+, BA+ and ethylammonium+ (EA+). The lattice strain was calculated by the Williamson–Hall method. It was found that the lattice strain decreased as the tolerance factor got close to 1.0, and the composition with 0.1% EA had the lowest lattice strain. Meanwhile, the lattice strain has a great effect on the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility decreases with the increase of the lattice strain. The device performance also shows a good correlation with the lattice strain, and the device based on the perovskite with the lowest lattice strain had the highest efficiency (Fig. 11d). This work provides guidance for designing perovskite compositions for high-performance tin-based PSCs.
Recently, the same group introduced EAI to GeI2-doped (FA1−xEAx)0.98EDA0.01SnI3 perovskites to tune the energy level and lattice distortion. The inclusion of EA+ cations can downshift the valence band of the perovskite layer, leading to efficient charge extraction at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface. Together with surface passivation by a Lewis base, the champion device showed a PCE of 13.24% along with a VOC of 0.84 V, which is the highest reported PCE for pure tin-based PSCs to date.
In summary, many different cations, including mixed MA+/FA+, en, PN, TN, HA+, DMA+, HEA+, Cs+, Rb+, Na+, K+, Cs+, BA+ and EA+, have been introduced at the A-site of tin-based PSCs, leading to successful modulation of the crystal tolerance factor, strain and structure of perovskite films. Properties like the carrier mobility, band structure and stability of the perovskite films are influenced by the cations. Hence, judicious selection of the cations or a mixture of them in a precursor solution is a feasible strategy for further improving the device performance.

If the A-site cation is replaced with a bulky organic ammonium ion, the 3D perovskite structure could be reduced to two or one-dimensional. By introducing hydrophobic organic spacers, 2D perovskites may have enhanced resistance to moisture. Meanwhile, benefiting from the superior optoelectronic properties, 2D perovskites have been proved to be excellent materials for photovoltaic applications. Cao and co-workers synthesized a series of 2D (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites (n = 1–5) and studied their optoelectronic properties. It is found that single phase 3D perovskite films could be obtained by using the precursor solvent with stoichiometric amounts of starting materials while clean 2D perovskite films cannot be obtained from such a precursor. Moreover, the solvent used to dissolve the presynthesized bulk perovskite can greatly influence the orientation of the final 2D perovskite film. When DMF is used, a 2D perovskite film can grow perpendicular to the substrate, which is favorable for charge transport. The 2D perovskite based PSC showed a PCE of 2.53% at n = 4.

Liao and co-workers studied low-dimensional (PEA)2FAn−1SnnI3n+1Sn perovskites. With the increased incorporation ratio of PEAI, the perovskite film changed from 3D to a 2D–3D mixture to pure 2D (Fig. 12a). In terms of orientation of the 2D perovskites, only 20% PEAI addition can lead to growth perpendicular to the substrate, probably due to the favorable thermodynamic stability under this condition. First-principles DFT calculations were used to investigate the thermodynamic stability of (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites. The decomposition enthalpy (ΔHdec) obviously declines as n decreases, indicating the enhanced stability of the 2D perovskite. PSCs with an inverted structure showed an overall PCE of 5.94% when 20% PEAI was added. The unencapsulated devices showed good shelf stability, retaining 96% of the initial PCE after 100 h storage in N2. Later on, Shen et al. synthesized 2D perovskite (PEA)2CsSn2I7 with high hole mobility. XPS measurements indicated the absence of Sn4+ in the perovskite samples, which may benefit from the reducing agent H3PO2 used in its precursor.
To study the crystallization kinetics of low dimensional BA2MA3Sn4I13 perovskites, Qiu and co-workers used different solvent systems. Pure DMSO or ionic liquid solvent methylammonium acetate (MAAc) resulted in poor film quality, while perovskite films prepared from a mixture of DMSO and MAAc showed smooth and pinhole-free morphology. It is supposed that the intermediate phase 3DMSO·SnI2 and BAMASn·Ac formed from the mixed solvent could affect the balance between Lewis adducts and the ion exchange process, leading to smooth perovskite films with large crystal grains. Perovskite films prepared from the mixed solvent also showed lower trap density and higher charge carrier mobility, which would be beneficial for the photovoltaic performance. PSCs with an inverted device structure based on the low dimensional BA2MA3Sn4I13 showed a PCE up to 4.03% as well as outstanding device stability.
Later on, this group used BA+ and PEA+ as mixed bulky cations to control the crystallization process of 2D tin-based perovskites. It was found that when only BA or PEA was used, 2D intermediate phases would be formed. These intermediate phases show a parallel growth orientation to the substrate, which will result in uneven nucleation and disordered orientation. In contrast, when BA and PEA were used together, no 2D intermediate phases were observed, which was beneficial for the vertical growth of RP phase perovskites. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements suggested that crystals tend to grow perpendicular to the substrate in the mixed cation system due to the suppressed formation of the 2D intermediate phase, which is beneficial for carrier transfer and consequently the device performance. The devices based on mixed BA/PEA cations show efficiency up to 8.82%, which is one of the highest values among 2D tin-based PSCs.
Recently, Liu and co-workers studied the effects of the alkyl chain length on crystal growth of 2D tin-based perovskites. They introduced different alkylamine spacer cations [butylamine (BA), octylamine (OA) and dodecylamine (DA)] to prepare 2D tin-based perovskite films, and found that the alkyl chain lengths could significantly affect the crystal orientation and phase distribution of the 2D perovskite films. A shorter alkyl chain length favors perpendicular crystal growth of 2D perovskite films, leading to the suppression of Sn2+ oxidation and efficient charge transport, while a longer chain promotes parallel crystal growth, which is detrimental to the device performance (Fig. 12b). As a result, BA-based PSCs exhibited a highest PCE of 4.04% and little hysteresis. This work provides insight on the effect of organic spacer cations on the crystal orientation of low dimensional perovskites.
To reduce the bandgap of 2D tin-based perovskites, Iwan and co-workers used symmetrical benzimidazolium (Bn) and benzodiimidazolium (Bdi) as organic cations to prepare 2D perovskites. Compared with other 2D perovskites using organic cations having –NH3+ groups, the distortions in the SnI6 octahedra are much smaller in Bn2SnI4 and BdiSnI4. These smaller distortions would result in narrower bandgaps, which is beneficial for light absorption. Compared to FASnI3, these 2D perovskites Bn2SnI4 and BdiSnI4 have much lower electrical conductivity, which may come from the protection effect of organic cations around perovskite sheets to slow down self-doping effects. Using the normal device structure without an HTM layer, solar cells based on Bn2SnI4 showed an efficiency of 2.3%.
To enhance the stability of 2D tin-based perovskites, Loh and co-workers used stilbene derivatives as large organic cations. The hydrophobicity of the fluorostilbene moiety improves the air stability of these perovskites. Moreover, face to face π–π interactions, CH⋯X type H bonds and interlayer F⋯F interactions result in more compact packing of the organic cations, which makes a compact water resistant layer (Fig. 12c). As a result, these 2D perovskites show much better air and chemical stability than other tin-based counterparts.
Later, Gao et al. used π-conjugated oligothiophene ligand 2-(3′′′,4′-dimethyl[2,2′:5′,2′′′-quaterthiophen]-5-yl)ethan-1-ammonium (4Tm) as a large organic cation to improve the stability of 2D tin-based perovskites. Compared with the benchmark perovskite (PEA)2SnI4, (4Tm)2SnI4 shows dramatically improved environmental and thermal stability. The π-conjugated 4Tm molecule is hydrophobic and bulky, which can prevent the penetration of oxygen and moisture. Meanwhile, the intermolecular interactions between the conjugated 4Tm molecules can help to stabilize the crystal structure to improve the intrinsic stability. DFT calculations also show that the formation energy of (4Tm)2SnI4 is more negative than that of (PEA)2SnI4, which confirms the stabilization effects of the 4Tm ligand. Kumar and co-workers used ab initio calculations to study the effect of surface ligands on the stability of tin bromide perovskites. It is found that van der Waals (vdW) interactions between these long chain molecules can enhance the stability and higher stability can be achieved with longer molecules. Their work highlights that proper design of organic cations can enhance the stability of low dimensional tin-based perovskites.
More recently, Li et al. introduced PEACl to prepare 2D tin-based perovskites and studied the effect of the annealing temperature on the crystal orientation within perovskite films.In situ synchrotron-based grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was used to detect the effect of the annealing temperature on the crystal orientation. It is found that 3D tin-based perovskites show disordered orientation regardless of the annealing temperature. With the introduction of PEACl, both low member and high member 2D crystal structures are formed at room temperature. With the increase of the annealing temperature, the low member 2D crystal phase gradually decreases, and the high member 2D crystal structure with vertical orientation becomes the dominant phase when the annealing temperature is 100 °C. The highly orientated perovskite films are favorable for charge transport and an efficiency of 9.1% is achieved. This work highlights the importance of the annealing conditions in regulating the orientation of low dimensional tin-based perovskites.
Dong et al. used in situ and ex situ structural analysis to investigate the crystallization mechanism of 3D FASnI3, 2D PEA2SnI4 and hybrid PEA2FAn−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites. Combining GIWAXS results, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence spectroscopy, they found that crystallization tends to begin at the air/solution interface and long organic cations can greatly affect the crystal orientation. For pure 3D FASnI3, nucleation and growth of crystals occur inside the precursor solution, which leads to randomly orientated crystallites. In a pure 2D PEA2SnI4 solution, crystallization starts from the air/solution interface or the solution/substrate interface without significant bulk crystallization, which is similar to the situation of Pb-based perovskites. In the case of 2D/3D mixed samples, for n ≥ 24 bulk crystallization still results in randomly oriented crystals. For n ≤ 8, bulk crystallization is largely suppressed and the predominant nucleation process occurs at the air/solution interface, which leads to strongly oriented crystals. This work provides better understanding of fundamental aspects of crystal formation of tin-based perovskites.
Low-dimensional Dion–Jacobson (DJ) tin-based perovskites were first reported by Chen and co-workers, and the crystal structure of the (4AMP)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 perovskite is shown in Fig. 13a. With 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP) as an organic cation, (4AMP)FA3Sn4I13 shows an absorption edge at 860 nm, which is promising for photovoltaic applications. Based on a normal mesoscopic structure, solar cells based on (4AMP)FA3Sn4I13 show a PCE of 4.22% and decent stability. This work exhibits the potential advantages of DJ tin-based perovskites. Later on, the same group added a low amount of 4AMP to enhance the optoelectronic properties of tin-based perovskites. Under optimized conditions, the 4AMP molecules would encapsulate the grain boundaries of the perovskite to retard the ingression of oxygen and moisture. The champion device exhibited a PCE of 10.9% along with good operational stability, which retained 77% of its original PCE after continuous 1 sun illumination for 500 h. This result suggests that the incorporation of divalent cations could be a promising method to enhance the optoelectronic properties of tin-based perovskites.
Later, Li and co-workers incorporated 1,4-butanediamine (BEA) into FASnI3 to develop DJ phase (BEA)FAn−1SnnI3n+1 perovskites. It is found that (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 has a direct bandgap of 1.47 eV. DFT calculations indicated that the formation energy of (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 is much higher than that of FASnI3, confirming the enhanced structural stability of (BEA)FA2Sn3I10. The (BEA)FA2Sn3I10 based solar cells exhibit a champion PCE of 6.43% and good stability against humidity and thermal corrosion.
Shao and co-workers mixed a 2D tin-based perovskite with a 3D FASnI3 perovskite to enhance the device performance. GIWAXS measurements indicated that the 2D perovskite is prone to locate near the substrate (Fig. 13b), and the 2D perovskite can induce the preferential orientation of the 3D perovskite grains. Interestingly, the incorporation of the 2D perovskite can coalesce FASnI3 grains and reduce trap states. Time-resolved PL measurements indicate that the 2D/3D perovskite films have a significantly improved lifetime compared to that of a control film, and a PCE of 9% is achieved in the resultant devices. The unencapsulated device based on the 2D/3D perovskite shows improved stability, retaining 59% of its original PCE after storage in air for 76 h, while the control device based on the 3D perovskite totally failed after storage.
Later on, the same group used ethylammonium iodide (EAI) to further improve the crystallinity of 2D/3D perovskite films. GIWAXS measurements indicated that EAI-modified 2D/3D perovskite films had stronger orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport and collection. Meanwhile, SEM measurements showed that the EA cation could eliminate pinholes and increase the grain size, which would reduce the leakage current and suppress charge recombination. The devices with EA cations exhibited an overall PCE of 8.40% and negligible hysteresis. The device efficiency was lower than that of the group reported before, which may come from the use of lower quality SnI2 (99.99%) than the one used before (99.999%).
Vapor deposition has been one useful method to fabricate homogeneous, smooth perovskite films with high surface coverage. Ran and co-workers introduced PEAI to enhance the stability of vapor deposited FASnI3 perovskites. They evaporated PEAI molecules on top of a pre-spin coated FAI film and then SnI2 was evaporated to obtain the 2D–3D bulk heterojunction film. It is found that PEAI can fill in the large spaces between FAI particles, thus leading to perovskite films with higher surface coverage. Moreover, the introduction of PEAI can form a hybrid perovskite/perovskite heterojunction, which can reduce the recombination rates and enhance the device stability. With an optimized PEAI amount, the planar structure device using PEDOT:PSS as the HTM showed an overall PCE of 5.28%. Furthermore, they inserted LiF between ITO and PEDOT:PSS to tune the work function of PEDOT:PSS to get better energy alignment between the HTM and the perovskite. Because of the reduced potential loss at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite, VOC of the PSC was improved to 0.09 V and an overall PCE of 6.98% was achieved.
Recently, Chen and co-workers introduced a low-dimensional perovskite (LDP) between the HTM and FASnI3 to improve the perovskite film morphology and reduce trap states. Using an inverted structure with PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport material, they spin-coated a PEABr layer on PEDOT:PSS before FASnI3 film deposition and the formation of a low-dimensional perovskite interlayer was confirmed by spectroscopic methods. It is proposed that the low-dimensional perovskite might serve as seeds to assist the growth of the adjacent 3D perovskite, leading to improved film morphology, which can reduce the trap-state density and carrier recombination near the HTM/perovskite interface. Benefiting from the introduction of the low-dimensional perovskite, the device performance was increased from 4.92% to 7.05%. This work shows that trap passivation at the interface is an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Similarly, He et al. used PEABr to passivate the FASnI3 film and improve the interface between the ETM and perovskite. XPS measurements show that the PEABr treatment can reduce the Sn4+ and improve the device performance. With PEABr treatment, the device efficiency was increased from 4.77% to 7.86% and better light soaking stability was achieved as well.
Kim et al. prepared a quasi-2D tin-based perovskite by introducing formamidinium thiocyanate (FASCN) as an additive. It is found that SCN− could form coordination with Sn2+ to restrain the oxidation. Consequently, the champion device exhibited a PCE of 8.17%. Meanwhile, the FASCN containing device showed much better stability, retaining more than 90% of the initial efficiency after storing in a glovebox for 1000 h. This work suggests that the introduction of pseudohalogen ions into tin-based perovskites can improve both the device performance and stability.
Recently, Ning and co-workers introduced NH4SCN as a mediator to prepare hierarchical 2D–quasi-2D–3D tin-based perovskite films. It is suggested that the interaction between Lewis base SCN− and Lewis acid SnI2 could simultaneously regulate the nucleation and perovskite crystal growth. As a result, 2D PEA2SnI4 and quasi-2D PEA2FASn2I7 tend to be formed near the surface of the perovskite film (Fig. 13c). With the introduction of 5% NH4SCN, devices based on the hierarchical perovskite showed a PCE of 9.41% with excellent reproducibility. Later, this group used indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as the ETM to replace PCBM, and a higher efficiency of 12.4% was achieved. They introduced NH4SCN as an additive to modify the PEA15FA85SnI3 perovskite film growth process. Compared with PCBM, ICBA has a shallower conduction band energy level, which enables a larger maximum attainable open voltage. Benefiting from the good energy level alignment and reduced interfacial recombination, the device achieved a certified PCE of 12.4% and a VOC as high as 0.94 V (Fig. 13d).
Xu and co-workers used ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) to control the orientation of tin-based quasi-2D perovskite films. GIWAXS analysis indicated that pristine AVA2FAn−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 5) (AVA = 5-ammonium valeric acid) showed random orientation. With 5% NH4Cl additive, the perovskite showed sharp Bragg spots, indicating a preferential vertical orientation, which is favorable for charge transport between two electrodes. Moreover, the NH4Cl additive can improve the perovskite film quality, leading to a uniform and compact morphology. The champion device with a vertically orientated perovskite showed an efficiency of 8.71% and good air stability.
In summary, 2D tin-based perovskites with RP or DJ phases have been prepared by introducing PEA, BA, 4Tm, 4AMP or BEA organic cations in perovskite crystals. The organic groups on the surface of 2D perovskites can protect the underneath perovskite layers and dramatically improve the material stability. However, the organic cations normally have poor conductivity and may prohibit charge transfer across them. Notably, quasi 2D structures or 2D/3D mixed structures can combine the benefits of both 2D and 3D structures, which is a promising direction to simultaneously enhance the stability and photovoltaic performance of tin-based PSCs. Meanwhile, the introduction of new hydrophobic cations and the successful regulation of the growth orientation of perovskite grains hold promise for further improving the performance of tin-based PSCs.

Computational studies indicate that the conduction band (CB) of perovskites is mainly formed by the p orbitals of B site cations while the p orbitals of X site anions and s orbitals of B site cations constitute the valence band (VB). Hence, B site cation component substitution can greatly affect the energy band structure and the photovoltaic properties of perovskites. In addition, suitable B site cations can improve the stability of the perovskite crystal structure.

The perovskite phase of CsSnCl3 is metastable at room temperature and could not be stabilized by A site or X site compositional engineering. To stabilize the CsSnCl3 perovskite lattice, Wu and co-workers used Mn2+ and In3+ for B site substitution. They used volume per formula unit V/Z as a structural indicator for these quaternary compositions. Based on the V/Z value, two target compositions CsSn0.9Mn0.1Cl3 (CTMC) and CsSn0.9In0.067Cl3 (CTIC) were synthesized and both of them could maintain the cubic perovskite pattern after six months of storage under N2. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements suggest that both of the as-synthesized compositions are homogeneous and thermodynamically stable at room temperature. This work highlights the structural effects of B site substitution in inorganic CsSnCl3 and could be applied to stabilize other metastable perovskites.
Bismuth (Bi) doping was introduced by Inabe et al. to tune the bandgap of the MASnI3 perovskite. From the diffuse reflectance spectra, it was found that the bandgap can be tuned from 1.3 eV to 0.8 eV with 8.7% Bi doping. Theoretical calculations suggest that Bi doping results in a lower CB level while the energy of the VB remains unchanged (Fig. 14a). Later on, this group introduced indium (In) to tune the electronic properties of MASnI3. It was found that a small amount of In doping could decrease the conductivity of the mixed perovskite. Meanwhile, In doping did not change the bandgap of the mixed perovskite because of the low doping content. This work suggests that metal substitution can be an effective method to tune the photovoltaic properties of tin-based perovskites.
Based on first principles computations, Zeng et al. reported mixed Sn and germanium (Ge) perovskites. The electronic bandgap, carrier mobility and structural stability of these materials were comprehensively studied. Interestingly, it is predicted that RbSn0.5Ge0.5I3 has a direct bandgap and a comparable optical absorption spectrum with that of MAPbI3, which is very promising for photovoltaic applications.
Similarly, Su and co-workers used ab initio DFT calculations to predict mixed calcium (Ca)/tin and strontium (Sr)/tin lead-free perovskites. It was found that MACa0.125Sn0.875I3 and MASr0.125Sn0.875I3 have suitable bandgaps for single junction solar cells. Moreover, the calculated decomposition energy indicates that these perovskites have good structural and thermodynamic stability, making them promising candidates for future applications.
Hayase et al. prepared mixed Sn/Ge perovskites and used them in PSCs. They observed that the XRD diffraction patterns of FA0.75MA0.25Sn1−xGexI3 shifted to larger angles because Ge with a smaller ionic size can reduce the lattice parameters. The 5% Ge doped device showed an efficiency of 4.48% and an increased value to 6.90% after storage in N2 for 72 h. Moreover, Ge doping can improve the air stability of the device. 80% of its initial performance was retained while the control device only retained 10% of its initial efficiency under the same condition. Later, this group used thermally stimulated current (TSC) to expound the effect of Ge doping in reducing trap states. After delicate analyses, it is found that 5 mol% Ge doping can substantially reduce the trap density and improve the carrier lifetime. The 5 mol% Ge doped device showed an efficiency of 7.9%, which is 3-fold higher than that of the control one.
To improve the performance of inorganic tin-based perovskites, Chen and co-workers synthesized the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 perovskite. XPS spectra with different incidence angles indicated that an ultrathin oxide layer comprising Sn doped GeO2 would be formed on the perovskite surface to enhance the air stability (Fig. 14b). Moreover, this oxide layer can suppress carrier recombination between the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 perovskite and HTM to enhance the photovoltaic performance. The champion device showed an overall efficiency of 7.11% and negligible hysteresis. The devices also showed enhanced stability, with 92% of the initial PCE remaining after continuous 1-sun illumination in an N2 atmosphere for 500 h. Further study on tuning the properties of this oxide layer and using a charge transport layer with better energy alignment with the perovskite may result in enhanced device performance.
In recent work, Liu et al. synthesized inorganic CsSn0.6Ge0.4I3 perovskite nanocrystals. Ge atoms could fill the Sn vacancies and reduce the surface traps to enhance the photophysical properties of the nanocrystals (Fig. 14c). Based on a planar normal structure, the CsSn0.6Ge0.4I3 solar cells showed a PCE of 4.9%. Cheng and co-workers synthesized a series of 2D (PEA)2Ge1−xSnxI4 perovskites. XRD patterns indicated that the compounds (PEA)2Ge1−xSnxI4 can retain their original structure with a moderate amount of Sn doping (x ≤ 0.5). Experiments and DFT calculations indicated that Sn substitution can reduce the bandgaps of these compounds (Fig. 14d). Specifically, (PEA)2Ge0.5Sn0.5I4 was found to have a bandgap of 1.95 eV and good thermal stability, which holds promise for optoelectronic applications.
In summary, many divalent cations like Ca2+, Ge2+ and Mn2+ have been successfully incorporated into tin-based perovskites at the B-site, which is an effective method to improve the structural stability and optimize the optoelectronic properties of tin-based perovskites. Meanwhile, other metal ions like Bi3+ and In3+ also demonstrate potential in component substitution at the B-site of tin-based perovskites while the underlying physicochemical mechanism still needs more investigation.

The anions of perovskites can greatly affect the photoelectric properties of the perovskite. Mixing halides in tin-based perovskites can help to achieve better photoelectric performance. Hao and co-workers implemented the first substitution of I− with Br− to produce MASnI3−xBrx perovskites. The lattice parameters demonstrate a clear contraction from MASnI3 to MASnBr3, resulting in increased bandgaps. The absorption onset of MASnI3−xBrx shows a clear blueshift, which can be adjusted from 954 nm to 577 nm. VOC of the corresponding devices increases from 0.68 V to 0.88 V when the perovskite materials change from MASnI3 to MASnBr3, while JSC decreases from 16.30 mA cm−2 to 8.26 mA cm−2 due to the blueshift of absorption (Fig. 15a). Moreover, the incorporation of Br can lower the series resistances of devices, which can improve the device fill factor. The device based on MASnIBr2 exhibited the highest PCE of 5.73%.

Lee et al. added Br− into FASnI3 to form FASnI3(1−x)Br3x perovskites. The introduction of smaller Br atoms in the FASnI3 lattice resulted in the reduction of the lattice spacing. With 25 mol% Br doping, the carrier density of an FASnI3 film was reduced by 3 orders of magnitude, which is a sign of reduced Sn vacancies. The 25 mol% Br-doped PSCs achieved a best PCE of 5.5%. Interestingly, the encapsulated device retained 83% of its initial performance after continuous one sun illumination for 1000 h in an ambient atmosphere. It is proposed that a thin blocking layer of Sn4+ would be formed between the perovskite and TiO2 because of the oxidation of the tin-based perovskite, thus suppressing the degradation at the perovskite/TiO2 interface.
To improve the open circuit voltage of all inorganic lead-free CsSnI3 PSCs, Sabba and co-workers introduced chemical doping of CsSnI3 with bromide. With the incorporation of Br, the crystal structure of CsSnI3−xBrx changes from orthorhombic to cubic (Fig. 15b). Similarly, the inclusion of bromide in the crystal lattice of CsSnI3 results in an increase of the bandgap. It was observed that the color of the perovskite film changes from black to light brown as the substitution of bromide increases, confirming the bandgap tuning achieved by incorporating Br. As a result, the open voltage of the PSCs increases from 201 mV (pure CsSnI3) to 410 mV (CsSnBr3).
In recent work, Yu et al. incorporated MABr into FASnI3 to form MAxFA1−xSnI3−xBrx perovskites and a champion efficiency of 9.31% was obtained. It was found that MA+ cations could lead to orientated crystallization of the perovskite films, with a preferential facet of (001). In the meantime, the incorporation of MABr could suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and modulate the electronic structures of the perovskites to form better energy alignment with charge transport layers for enhanced carrier transport. The MA0.25FA0.75SnI2.75Br0.25-based PSCs exhibited a champion efficiency of 9.31% while the control device based on FASnI3 only showed a PCE of 5.02%. The devices also demonstrated good light soaking stability, which retained 80% of their initial efficiency after 300 h continuous light irradiation, while the control device quickly degraded after 120 h.
Similar to Br doping, the introduction of Cl during film fabrication can also improve the photoelectric properties of tin-based perovskite films. Diau and co-workers synthesized mixed tri-halide tin-based perovskites MASnIBr2−xClx. Because of the large difference in ionic radius between I− and Cl−, a continuous solid phase of MASnI3−xClx cannot be formed. For the mixed tri-halide MASnIBr2−xClx, a small amount of Cl anions can be incorporated into the lattice when Br anions occupied more than half of the halide sites (x ≤ 0.5). Otherwise phase separation would occur, and both MASnI3−yBry and MASnBrzCl3−z can be formed (x ≥ 1) (Fig. 15c). With the incorporation of a small amount of Cl in the perovskite, charge recombination is retarded and the exciton lifetime is enhanced. PSCs based on MASnIBr1.8Cl0.2 exhibited a best PCE of 3.1% along with enhanced long term stability.
Superhalides such as BF4− and PF6− have been used to enhance the device stability and passivate trap states of lead-based PSCs. Diau et al. synthesized a mixed halide/superhalide FASnI3−x(BF4)x perovskite and studied its optoelectronic properties. Plane-wave DFT calculations and experiments confirmed the successful preparation of FASnI(BF4)2 (referred to as FSB) (Fig. 15d). Due to the highly electronegative fluorine atoms in BF4−, tetrafluoroborate ions could form strong bonding with Sn atoms to suppress Sn2+ oxidation. Based on a mesoporous carbon electrode structure, the FSB-based devices exhibited a PCE of 1.3% with enhanced light-soaking stability.
Recently, Li et al. used a one-pot solution method to incorporate Cl into a 2D (BA)2SnI4 perovskite. The as-synthesized (BA)2SnI4−xClx shows a thin flake morphology and changes to a needle-like shape with an increased ratio of Cl incorporation. This is due to new nucleation centers created by Cl adjusting the growth process of the mixed perovskite. XRD patterns showed a gradual shift to smaller angles with the increased ratio of incorporated Cl, indicating that Cl is doped into the crystal lattice. Moreover, XPS and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) also confirmed that Cl is incorporated into the crystal lattice of (BA)2SnI4. With an increased concentration of Cl, the PL emission peak of (BA)2SnI4−xClx showed a clear redshift because of the bandgap narrowing effect. At a higher Cl concentration, the (BA)2SnI4−xClx crystal shows improved conductivity.
In conclusion, compositional modulation of tin-based perovskites is a feasible strategy for enhancing the performance of tin-based PSCs (Table 3). Although promising results have been obtained, the impact of component engineering on the properties of tin-based perovskites, like the defect states, charge carrier dynamics and crystal orientation, still needs more systematic investigation. In this regard, theoretical calculations could be a valid tool to get insight into the material properties. For low dimensional tin-based perovskites, RP and DJ phases have been intensively reported while no report on the ACI phase of tin-based perovskites can be found. Compared with RP and DJ low dimensional perovskite phases with long chain cations, ACI type perovskites adopt smaller cations at the interlayer sites, which may afford better charge transport properties. Moreover, multiple site mixing in tin-based perovskites is a viable method to combine the merits of different ions, like reducing groups and coordinating bonds, which can be a promising direction to further improve the optoelectronic properties and stability of tin-based perovskites.

An alternative way to alleviate the toxicity of lead in conventional PSCs is to partially replace lead with tin in the perovskite materials. Compared with tin-based ones, mixed Sn–Pb PSCs demonstrate enhanced performance and stability induced by Pb incorporation. Opposite to Vegard's law, a bandgap bowing effect is observed in mixed Sn–Pb perovskites, which can be tuned from 1.2 eV to 1.6 eV, making them ideal light absorbers approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. They also can be used in low-bandgap perovskite subcells for tandem devices. Goyal et al. used DFT calculations to investigate the origin of this anomalous bandgap behavior on chemical composition of Sn–Pb perovskite alloys. It is found that this nonlinear bandgap change is a consequence of the energy mismatch between s and p orbitals of Pb and Sn, which form the band edges of the mixed perovskites. Because of the less bound Sn atomic orbitals that form the bands, the band edges of the tin-based perovskite are less bound than those of the lead-based one. Consequently, the bandgap of the mixed Sn–Pb perovskites is formed between the Sn-derived valence band maximum (VBM) and Pb-derived conduction band minimum (CBM), which is lower than those of the perovskites based on an individual compound (Fig. 16a).


Similar to tin-based perovskites, binary Sn–Pb mixed perovskites also face the problem of easy oxidation of Sn2+, which causes a high trap density and short carrier lifetime. In 2014, Zuo et al. prepared mixed MAPb1−xSnxI(Cl) perovskites from MAI, PbCl2 and SnCl2, and for the first time a PCE above 10% was achieved based on mixed Sn–Pb perovskites. Xu and co-workers introduced a common antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) in the perovskite precursor to enhance the performance of mixed Sn–Pb PSCs. Besides retarding the oxidation of Sn2+, the counter anion of AA can function as a Lewis base to interact with SnI2/PbI2 and influence the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite. With AA as an additive, MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3-based solar cells showed an efficiency of 14.01% with improved stability.

Zhu et al. introduced DMSO as a capping agent to control the crystallization of mixed Sn–Pb perovskites. It is found that the high affinity of DMSO with metal iodides can slow down the reaction rate between MAI and SnI2/PbI2, leading to larger perovskite grains and enhanced crystallinity. Moreover, EDS analysis indicated that DMSO could ameliorate the inhomogeneous distribution of Sn in the alloyed perovskite, which can improve the film quality and thus the device performance. Based on a planar inverted structure, the best device had a PCE of 15.2%. Zong and co-workers used Lewis-adduct SnF2·3FACl as an additive to realize a uniform and continuous distribution of SnF2 along the grain boundaries of Sn–Pb perovskites, which enhanced the physical properties of these alloyed ideal bandgap halide perovskites (IBHPs). The Lewis base–acid interaction between SnF2 and FACl was evidenced by the FTIR spectrum. This coordination is not stable at high temperature, which will realize the uniform distribution of SnF2 along the grain boundaries in the alloyed perovskite after annealing due to the release of the FACl byproduct (Fig. 16b). The tin-rich grain boundary can reduce the Sn vacancy concentration and improve the chemical stability of the mixed Sn–Pb perovskite films. The device performance was increased from 12.9% to 15.8% with enhanced environmental stability.
Recently, Z. Zhu et al. used a galvanic displacement reaction (GDR) to prepare Sn–Pb binary PSCs. Briefly, they added Sn metal powders to a pure Pb perovskite precursor to get Sn–Pb binary precursor solutions by the equation: Sn(s) + Pb2+→ Sn2+ + Pb(s). XRD patterns and PL spectroscopy confirmed the formation of MAPb1−xSnxI3 films from the precursor solutions, and XPS analysis was used to find the x value. With an inverted device structure, MAPb0.4Sn0.6I3 based solar cells showed an efficiency of 15.76%. Furthermore, (FAPb0.6Sn0.4I3)0.85(MAPb0.6Sn0.4Br3)0.15 based solar cells exhibited a PCE of 18.21%. This method can be used to prepare other mixed metal PSCs. Similarly, Lin and co-workers used metallic Sn powders to prepare narrow bandgap Sn–Pb perovskites. Based on the comproportionation reaction Sn + Sn4+ → 2Sn2+, the metallic Sn powder can suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. With the introduction of Sn power, the device performance is increased from 18.3% to 21.1%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among Sn–Pb mixed PSCs. Using a similar in situ reduction method with excess Sn powder, Jiang and co-workers got a PCE of 20.7% in the PSCs based on the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 perovskite.
Kapil et al. added Cs to the lattice of the (FASnI3)0.5(MAPbI3)0.5 perovskite to reduce the lattice strain and improve the intrinsic stability of perovskites. XRD patterns showed gradual shifts to higher angles, indicating the incorporation of Cs+ into the crystal lattice and the shrinking of the lattice. Derived from the Williamson–Hall plot, it was found that the strain was first relaxed with a small amount of addition of Cs+ and then it increased with a large amount of Cs+. As confirmed by thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements, both the shallow and deep level trap densities dropped with a proper amount of Cs+ addition. Moreover, FTO glasses were used instead of frequently used ITO because FTO has higher transmission in the infrared region, which can help to get a higher current density at wavelengths longer than 800 nm. With the incorporation of 2.5% Cs+, the best PCE of 20.4% and a high current density of 33.14 mA cm−2 were achieved. Tong and co-workers used guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) to improve the optoelectronic properties of Sn–Pb mixed perovskites. The high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image indicated that a small amount of GuaSCN additive could form a 2D structure at grain boundaries (GBs), which would passivate GBs and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Moreover, the GuaSCN additive could enhance the carrier lifetime and thus the carrier diffusion length, which would result in more light absorption in the infrared region and generate more photocarriers. Sn–Pb mixed PSCs modified with 7% GuaSCN showed a PCE of 20.5% and a much improved current density. Notably, the enhancement of the device performance should be ascribed to the combination function of GuaSCN other than a single effect of Gua+ or SCN−.
Recently, Yang and co-workers added cadmium (Cd2+) ions into the Sn–Pb mixed perovskite precursor to improve the performance of narrow bandgap PSCs. It is supposed that a very small amount of Cd2+ ions can fill the Sn vacancies to reduce the background carrier concentration and result in enhanced minority carrier mobility and a longer carrier diffusion length. The improved properties of Sn–Pb mixed perovskites can increase the optimum thickness of perovskite films to guarantee light absorption in the near infrared wavelength region (Fig. 16c). With the introduction of 0.03 mol% Cd2+, FA0.5MA0.45Cs0.05Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 based solar cells showed an efficiency of 20.3% with negligible hysteresis.
Zhao et al. added Cl into Sn–Pb mixed perovskite layers. It was found that the incorporation of 2.5% Cl into the perovskite can enlarge the grain size, increase the carrier mobility and suppress charge recombination. Based on a planar inverted structure, the champion device showed a PCE of 18.4%. Later, this group used Br to passivate GBs to improve the performance of mixed Sn–Pb PSCs. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) indicated that the dark saturation current was mainly caused by leakage current from GBs and Br incorporation can passivate GBs to reduce carrier recombination (Fig. 16d). With the incorporation of 6% Br, the champion device showed a PCE of 19.03% with good reproducibility. Therefore, halide mixing in iodide-based perovskites could be a useful way to improve the performance of mixed Sn–Pb PSCs. Recently, Hu and co-workers prepared an all inorganic Sn–Pb mixed perovskite with a bandgap of 1.38 eV for PSCs. To enhance the stability of the CsPb0.6Sn0.4I3 perovskite film, the SnF2·3FACl additive was incorporated to decorate the grain boundaries with antioxidant SnF2 phases. Then, the perovskite surface was functionalized by (aminomethyl)piperidinium diiodide (4AMP)I2, which could passivate the surface defects and form a hydrophobic layer to protect the perovskite film. Benefiting from these, the champion device exhibited a PCE of 13.37%. Meanwhile, the interface-functionalized PSCs demonstrated good operational stability, retaining 71% of their original efficiency after continuous one sun illumination for 1000 h. The detailed device performance of mixed Sn–Pb PSCs is summarized in Table 4.

Multijunction tandem solar cells, which can absorb complementary parts of the solar spectrum, provide a convenient way to overcome the SQ limit. Generally, tandem solar cells are composed of wide bandgap front cells and low bandgap rear cells, which are monolithically integrated by an interconnection layer (ICL). Monolithic all perovskite tandem solar cells feature the merits of excellent photovoltaic properties and low cost deposition techniques, which make them powerful competitors for the next generation photovoltaic market.

High-performance low-bandgap PSCs are an essential prerequisite for all perovskite tandem solar cells. In 2016, Eperon and co-workers added Cs to enhance the performance and stability of mixed Sn–Pb PSCs. With the addition of 25% Cs, a best efficiency of 14.8% was achieved based on FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 as a light absorber. Combining with a wide bandgap top cell, the tandem device showed a PCE of 17.0%. The interconnection layer plays a critical role in determining the performance of tandem solar cells, which should not only protect the top cell during the preparation of the bottom cell but also facilitate efficient charge collection. Plamstrom et al. introduced a thin layer of poly(ethylenimine) ethoxylated (PEIE) as a nucleation layer to enhance the coverage of ALD-deposited aluminum zinc oxide (AZO). FA0.6Cs0.3MA0.1Pb2.4Br0.6 with a bandgap of 1.7 eV was produced as the top material. Combining with the low bandgap FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite, 2-terminal tandem solar cells with an interconnecting layer of C60/PEIE/AZO/sputtered indium zinc oxide (IZO)/PEDOT:PSS were fabricated (Fig. 17a). This tandem device shows a PCE of 23.1% on a rigid substrate. Based on a flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate, a high efficiency of 21.3% was achieved along with good bending stability (Fig. 17b).
Recently, Yu and co-workers introduced a combination of C60/SnO2−x (0 < x < 1) as an interconnection structure. After adjusting the parameters of atomic layer deposition, a compact SnO1.76 layer was produced. The transfer curves of field-effect transistors based on the SnO1.76 film indicate the ambipolar carrier transport capability of SnO1.76, which makes it a functional ICL in tandem solar cells (Fig. 17c). The champion tandem solar cell based on C60/SnO1.76 as an ICL shows a high PCE of 24.6% (Fig. 17d). Moreover, the encapsulated tandem solar cells exhibited excellent stability, retaining 94% of their original efficiency after 1000 h one sun illumination. Very recently, Xiao and co-workers introduced a formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) additive to enhance the efficiency and stability of low bandgap FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 PSCs. As a strong reducing agent, the FSA molecules can suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and passivate defects. Benefiting from reduced defects and enhanced film uniformity, the mixed Sn–Pb solar cells achieved a high PCE of 21.7% and a certified efficiency of 20.7%. Combining with a wide bandgap FA0.8Cs0.2PbI1.8Br1.2 top subcell, the tandem device exhibits a JSC of 15.5 mA cm−2, VOC of 2.01 V, and FF of 79.3%, yielding a high PCE of 24.7% and a certified efficiency of 24.2%. As shown in Fig. 17e, the integrated current densities of the wide and narrow bandgap subcells are 16.1 and 15.7 mA cm−2, respectively, indicating good current matching. Moreover, tandem devices with an aperture of 12 cm2 are prepared and a best PCE of 21.4% was achieved.
In summary, various strategies like additives and compositional engineering have been developed to prepare high performance mixed Sn–Pb PSCs. Currently, researchers can get high efficiency over 20% when more than 50% of the lead was replaced with tin, indicating a promising effect in alleviating the toxicity of lead in PSCs. Benefiting from high performance low bandgap mixed Sn–Pb PSCs, the PCEs of monolithic all perovskite tandem solar cells have exceeded 24%, which is comparable with those of silicon solar cells. However, some critical issues like device stability and large-area fabrication for mass production still need more research in the future.

Currently, the state-of-the-art perovskites still need Pb2+ to achieve outstanding optoelectronic properties, which causes the concern of perovskite toxicity for the environment and human health. In 2011, the European Union released the “Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS)”, which restricts the maximum concentration of lead in any electronic devices to 0.1% in weight. However, almost all the high performance perovskites contain more than 10% lead in weight. Furthermore, perovskites are sensitive to moisture, light, heat and oxygen, which leads to environmental concerns in the life cycle of perovskite photovoltaics. In general, toxic metals include thallium, cadmium, manganese, lead, mercury and the radioactive metals, while the toxicity of tin and its compounds is almost unknown. But tin can be finally degraded into inactive and water-insoluble SnO2 in air. Thus, the photovoltaic research community has turned to tin as an environmentally benign alternative for perovskites. However, there still remains debate about the lower toxicity of tin compared with its lead counterparts because the toxicity and environmental effects of tin are quite complex. The environmental impacts of Pb and Sn halide perovskites are compared by tracking the reaction of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the degradation products of perovskites. The results indicate that exposure to SnI2 is more toxic to zebrafish than exposure to PbI2, which stems from more serious acidification effects resulting from SnI2 than PbI2. But if we consider the quick oxidation of SnI2 in air, the above effect of tin-based perovskites may not be found in circumstances with a major concern on the long-term impact.

Li et al. used plants to assess the environmental impact of halide perovskites. The ability of mint plants (Mentha spicata) to take up heavy metals from the ground (bioavailability of metals) is measured to indicate the metal contamination. As shown in Fig. 18a, after adding 250 mg kg−1 of perovskite, which is the safety level of agriculture regulation in China, most of the mint plants experienced blackening and rotting, indicative of lead intoxication. After adding 35 mg kg−1 metals, the roots of plants take up much less tin than lead (Fig. 18b and c). As a highly unstable product in the environment, the Sn2+ from perovskites can decompose into Sn4+ compounds with low solubility in water, which reduces its bioavailability. On the other hand, if the soil is contaminated by only PbI2 or SnI2, the metal concentration in roots of mint is a little lower than that grown on perovskite polluted soil. This is due to the hygroscopic nature of organic cations, which facilitates the degradation of perovskites and influences the pH of the soil and then affects metal bioavailability. In this regard, all-inorganic tin-based perovskites like CsSnI3 could reduce the toxic effect due to its reduced solubility. Notably, research about the toxicity of perovskites is still limited, and it is urgent to establish a standard system of biological experiments to make a reliable assessment of the toxicity of tin-based perovskites.

We have systematically reviewed the recent progress in tin-based PSCs. Tin-based perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties, and a highest PCE of 13.24% has been achieved. However, Sn2+ in tin-based perovskites faces notorious stability issues, which hinders the further development of tin-based PSCs. Great efforts have been made to settle this problem, like using excess tin halide to create a tin rich environment and introducing reducing agents to inhibit oxidation. Meanwhile, additives are introduced to improve the film quality of tin-based perovskites, which enables significant enhancement of the device performance.

Similar to lead-based perovskites, compositional engineering has been a successful approach to preparing tin-based PSCs with significantly enhanced photoelectric performance. Chemical modification of the A site cations can not only improve the perovskite film morphology and consequently the device performance but also increase the long term stability. Specifically, introduction of larger cations like PEA+ and BA+ into 3D tin-based perovskites to form 2D or 2D/3D mixed perovskites can greatly improve the device stability. Meanwhile, anions can also affect the properties of perovskite films. The inclusion of Br into the perovskite lattice can tune the bandgap and reduce the background carrier density, leading to better device performance. Besides, pseudohalide anions tend to have larger electron affinity than traditional halide atoms and more electrons could be taken from Sn atoms in tin-based perovskites, which will suppress the further oxidation of Sn2+. The introduction of pseudohalide anions into tin-based perovskites should be further explored in the future.
The device design and interface properties are critical to the device performance. The inverted structure has been popularly used in tin-based PSCs due to the limited choices of suitable charge transport materials for the devices. The interfaces between the tin-based perovskite and the charge transport layers should be further optimized, which have a great influence on the device performance and long-term stability. Thus, novel charge transport materials specifically for tin-based PSCs should be investigated, which should have a suitable energy alignment and a perfect interface with tin-based perovskites. In addition, some techniques such as epitaxial growth for improving the perovskite crystallinity will be very effective in improving the device performance. Furthermore, the application of 2D materials to improve the performance of tin-based PSCs could be a promising research direction.
Though great progress has been made in tin-based perovskites, deep understanding of the photophysics and photochemistry process is yet to be obtained. Encouragingly, simulation models suggested that a maximum PCE of more than 20% can be achieved from tin-based PSCs under optimized conditions. In summary, many effective approaches have been successfully developed for improving the performance of tin-based PSCs, as depicted in Fig. 19, which can be classified into four strategies: (1) introduction of reducing agents, (2) morphology control, (3) compositional engineering and (4) device engineering.
To further improve the performance of tin-based PSCs, we need to consider more effective approaches to overcome the limitations of the current devices from the point of view of device physics. The performance of tin-based PSCs is limited by the following three photovoltaic parameters, including the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). Compared with their lead-based counterparts, tin-based PSCs have a much lower VOC with a record value of only 0.94 V, which severely limits the overall efficiency of tin-based PSCs. Generally, VOC of solar cells can be described by the following equation: VOC = Eg/q − Vrad − Vnon, where Eg is the bandgap of the light absorber material, q is the elementary charge, and Vrad and Vnon are the VOC losses caused by radiative and nonradiative recombination, respectively. Since radiative energy loss is inevitable, nonradiative recombination is the key reason for low VOC in tin-based PSCs. Trap states can be easily generated by oxidation in tin-based perovskites, which will act as nonradiative carrier recombination centers, leading to low VOC of the device. In this regard, high quality tin-based perovskite films with low defect density are highly needed to improve VOC of tin-based PSCs. Interestingly, 2D/3D mixed tin-based perovskites always lead to higher VOC than pure 3D perovskites presumably due to the passivation effect of the 2D perovskite layer on the surface. On the other hand, conventional charge transport materials used in lead-based PSCs may be unsuitable for tin-based PSCs and could cause mismatched band alignment and serious interfacial charge recombination. Hence, a higher VOC of tin-based PSCs can be expected by judiciously optimizing charge transport layers specifically for tin-based perovskites.

J
SC of solar cells is mainly determined by the optical absorption edge and charge transfer process. For tin-based perovskites with bandgaps of 1.2–1.4 eV, the maximum JSC could be as high as 40 mA cm−2. However, the reported JSC of tin-based PSCs is much smaller than the theoretical value for the following reasons. One is due to additives like reducing agents and 2D perovskites in the perovskite layer that can prohibit charge transfer across them (Fig. 6a). Second, high-density defects in tin-based perovskite films will decrease the carrier lifetime, diffusion length and mobility and induce serious carrier recombination. Third, the perovskite films are not thick enough to guarantee sufficient optical adsorption. Notably, the perovskite thicknesses of reported tin-based PSCs are normally about 200–300 nm while the ideal thickness could be 500 nm according to theoretical calculations. Indeed, the optimum thickness of a tin-based perovskite layer in a PSC is limited by the carrier diffusion length L (, where μ is the carrier mobility, τ the carrier lifetime, k the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature and q the electron charge) inside it. In this regard, a high-quality tin-based perovskite film with a longer carrier diffusion length and higher thickness is required to enhance JSC of tin-based PSCs.
The reported FF for tin-based PSCs is around 70% while the FF values of lead-based PSCs can reach over 80%. The FF of a solar cell is mainly determined by the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the device. Under ideal conditions, Rs should be close to zero and Rsh should approach an infinite value to get the maximum FF. For tin-based perovskites, the rapid crystallization process will result in many trap states in the film and serious nonradiative recombination, leading to decreased Rsh and low FF. Meanwhile, as discussed above, the mismatched energy alignment at the interfaces will increase Rs of a device, leading to serious interfacial recombination and low FF. Therefore, an optimized film fabrication method and suitable charge transport layers should be the solutions for further improving the FF and overall performance of tin-based PSCs. Overall, there is plenty of room for performance enhancement of tin-based PSCs. If all of the problems mentioned above can be solved, device efficiencies close to the SQ limit are expected to be achieved. Notably, the ultimate goal of the research field is to enable mass production of large-area devices with low cost for commercialization. Thus, large-area device fabrication techniques such as screen printing and roll to roll processing should be developed, which however have been rarely reported until now. In this case, the perovskite materials, organic solvents and charge transport materials need to meet the requirement for printing processes, which should be tackled in the future.
Although tin is a heavy metal, it has not been classified as a toxic metal. But the toxicity of tin-based perovskites may also be related to other components in the perovskite material. So the toxicity of tin-based perovskites in some specific environments should be systematically studied and the underlying mechanism should be made clear once the materials or devices are found to be toxic. If we cannot completely avoid the use of lead eventually, we can consider mixed Sn–Pb perovskites with less lead being incorporated in the devices. Blending Sn with Pb, the mixed perovskites have tunable bandgaps from 1.1 eV to around 1.3 eV, making them excellent candidate materials for ideal bandgap single-junction solar cells to meet the SQ limit. Great efforts have been made to enhance the optoelectronic properties of mixed Sn–Pb perovskite films. Currently, mixed Sn–Pb PSCs have achieved an efficiency of more than 21%, while the use of lead in the material is less than 50% in comparison with typical lead-based perovskites. Moreover, these materials with tunable bandgaps are suitable for tandem solar cells. Combining with wide bandgap top solar cells, such tandem solar cells can exhibit higher efficiency than the best-performing silicon solar cells. Even with all perovskite active layers in the tandem solar cells, a PCE of 24.7% has been achieved at this stage and a big improvement is expected to be obtained after further optimization of the device design and fabrication.
Device stability is another important issue to be considered in tin-based PSCs, which is critical to the commercialization of the technology. By introducing reducing agents and undertaking compositional engineering in perovskite films, the device stability has been improved much faster than we expected before. Air-stable tin-based PSCs have been obtained and the device efficiency can be relatively maintained over 80% after 1000 h exposure to air, which is even better than some lead-based PSCs. Such devices encapsulated with impermeable layers on the top are expected to show much better stability under light illumination. The best stability of tin-based PSCs under light soaking is also very high. The device efficiency can maintain 95% of its initial value within 1000 h under simulated 1-sun light in an N2 gas environment. Further studies are needed to optimize the stability of the devices and enable compatible encapsulation techniques especially for the mass production of large-area devices.
It is necessary to develop tin-based PSCs with novel functions, like semitransparent and flexible devices, to meet the requirements of some niche applications, such as wearable electronics, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and building integrated photovoltaics. Due to the tunable bandgap of tin-based perovskites, semitransparent PSCs with different colors can be achieved. Tin-based devices can be prepared on flexible substrates with light weight by solution processes, which however have been rarely reported. For these applications, we should consider more special requirements of the transparent electrodes, perovskites and charge transport materials in the devices. Some novel materials like 2D materials (e.g. graphene, black phosphorous, Mxenes and MoS2) and organic semiconductors with high carrier mobilities are needed in the devices to achieve not only efficient carrier transport but also mechanical flexibility. Moreover, the introduction of nanocrystals, like PbS quantum dots, carbon dots and supranano liquid metal, in tin-based perovskite films could be a promising strategy for improving photovoltaic performance. Thanks to the fast development of various functional materials that can be integrated in devices with fascinating optoelectronic properties, we strongly believe that a new era of lead-free PSCs has just begun.
