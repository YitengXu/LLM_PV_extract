Poor stability is the most intractable factor undermining the confidence of academic and industry communities and impeding the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The mostly used small molecule transport materials in PSCs such as spiro-OMeTAD always suffer from undesired glass transition at relatively low temperatures. Glass transition would induce phase transition, crystallization and further physical deformation of the film and formation of a charge trap and short-circuited pathway that deteriorates the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. To achieve stable and efficient PSCs, we propose a robust small molecule and polymer hole transport composite (SMPHTC), wherein a polymer is used as the skeleton, and small molecule materials as the crevice filler. In particular, we present a visualized method at the microscopic level to thoroughly understand the component spatial distribution of the SMPHTC, and its morphological evolution within the devices under thermal stress. Planar n–i–p structure PSCs based on this composite showed a PCE of 22.7% (reverse 23.3% and forward 22.0%) and a stable output of about 22.9%. Moreover, the obtained planar PSCs based on the SMPHTC showed obviously improved stability and preserved 90% of the original efficiency below 85 °C for 1000 h and 92% of the highest stabilized power output (SPO) after tracking for 560 h at room temperature without cooling. These results provide a deep understanding of low temperature glass transition suppression and suggest a general method for efficient and stable PSCs.

Long-term stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are the most important issues for the photovoltaic industry. Compared with the fast-growing efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), long-term stability is an even tougher obstacle for commercialization. The instability of PSCs induced by intrinsic factors such as perovskite materials and interface degradation could be further increased by environmental factors such as oxygen, moisture, heat, and ultraviolet light. The components of perovskite materials, such as MA+, Pb2+ and I− are large ions and highly polarized, which means that the crystal lattice is soft and susceptible to various extrinsic factors. Perovskite materials would decompose into volatile species such as HI, I2, and CH3NH2 and nonvolatile species such as PbI2 and metallic Pb (Pb0) during the preparation process and under working conditions. The resulting volatile decomposition products and other mobile component ions would diffuse across the upper transport layer (refers to the layer between the metal electrode and perovskite layer, which was prepared after the deposition of the perovskite layer) under thermal stress, leading to an irreversible chemical reaction with metal electrodes such as Ag, Al, Cu and even inert Au. Meanwhile, metal electrodes were also found to penetrate the upper transport layer and reach the perovskite layer, which would induce perovskite degradation and the formation of short-circuited pathways in solar cells. To obtain PSCs with high efficiency and stability, the upper transport layer should be compact, robust and possess good electrical properties.

Small molecule transport materials [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene] (spiro-OMeTAD) are widely used in n–i–p structure PSCs due to ease of film fabrication and excellent transport properties. However, pure spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs suffer from severe degradation under thermal, light and other environmental stress during the operational lifetime due to their relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg) of nearly 126 °C, and the employed additives would lead to further significant drop in Tg. Glass transition induces phase transition, crystallization, physical deformation of the film and formation of short-circuited channels in PSCs that deteriorates the PCE. Generally, polymers in a large temperature range and small molecule thin films at the glass transition temperature are amorphous. Small molecule materials would crystallize above Tg. Amorphous thin films with high glass transition temperatures are more resistant to thermal stress. High thermally durable and amorphous organic thin-film materials are always utilized for carrier transport, light absorption and emission in optoelectronic devices including organic light emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, PSCs etc. Therefore, the exploration of a composite transport layer featuring both robustness and outstanding optoelectronic properties becomes a crucial challenge, and it is essentially required to achieve deep understanding on the underlying mechanism that governs the efficiency and stability of PSCs. The exploration of a composite transport layer combining the outstanding characteristics of robustness and optoelectronic properties is the most feasible approach to simultaneously realize high efficiency and stability in PSCs, yet it received limited success.
In this work, we proposed a robust “concrete”-like small molecule and polymer hole transport composite (SMPHTC) to construct efficient and stable PSCs, by using poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) for constructing the skeletal network filled with spiro-OMeTAD. For the first time, photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) technology is employed to reveal the structural and distributional features of SMPHTC films, which visualized the components of the PTAA skeleton and spiro-OMeTAD filler at the microscopic level. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were used to probe the morphological evolution of the SMPHTC films and the resulting PSCs by a thermal aging test for 1000 h at 85 °C. Combined with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and synchronous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, it was revealed that the PTAA skeleton effectively suppressed the undesired low Tg glass transition of spiro-OMeTAD under thermal stress and formation of crystal boundary, short-circuit and decomposed species diffusion channels in the films. Additionally, planar PSCs based on this glass transition suppressed composite films showed substantial improvement in both the original PCE and long-term stability. This concept could also be extended to other optoelectronic devices.

A typical n–i–p planar configuration, ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/Au, was used for stable and efficient planar PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1a. Two types of perovskite layers with a small component difference were used in planar PSCs. The perovskite layers were prepared by a sequential two-step deposition method. One type of perovskite layer is prepared with cation isopropanol (IPA) solution containing 20 mg MAI and 40 mg FAI, and marked as Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) perovskite, in which MA is methylammonium and FA is formamidinium. MA is thermally less stable than FA. To obtain better thermal stability, MAI was mostly replaced by FAI (5 mg MAI and 55 mg FAI) in another type of perovskite layer for balancing phase and thermal stability requirements, which was marked as Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) perovskite.

Suppression of low Tg glass transition would prevent the formation of crystal boundary, short-circuit and decomposed species diffusion channels (Fig. 1b). The SMPHTC consisted of the small molecule spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S1a and b) and the polymer PTAA (molecule structure, Fig. S1c and d), which is expected to effectively inhibit the crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD and further obtain PSCs with better performance and thermal stability. In this composite, we propose that PTAA and spiro-OMeTAD serve as the skeleton and crevice filler respectively, to form a robust “concrete” like hole transport composite. As shown in Fig. S1e, SMPHTC solution is prepared by mixing a given volume ratio of spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA solutions (defined as SxPy, and a 1:1 volume ratio of spiro-OMeTAD:PTAA is defined as S1P1). Unless specified, the adopted concentration of spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA solutions is 80 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1 respectively, wherein lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, dissolved in acetonitrile) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) additives are also included. The hole transport composite films were deposited by spin-coating.
The PTIR technology was utilized to visualize the components of the PTAA skeleton and spiro-OMeTAD filler to reveal the morphology and distribution features of the SMPHTC film. PTIR is a powerful technique combining the chemical specificity of infrared (IR) spectroscopy with the lateral resolution of atomic force microscopy (AFM), wherein the tip of an AFM probe is used to locally detect thermal expansion in a sample resulting from absorption of infrared radiation. This enables the acquisition of IR absorption spectra and mapping images of components with nanoscale resolution. Accordingly, conventional IR spectroscopy measurements of spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA and their mixture based on KBr pellets were firstly performed to obtain the characteristic vibration absorption for further mapping in PTIR characterization. As shown in Fig. S2, the absorption peaks at 1295 and 1035 cm−1, correspond to the –CH3 wag vibration in the plane of PTAA and the C–O–C stretching vibration of spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Fig. 2a and S3 display the AFM topographic images of the composite film with the clear “skeletal network” in which a certain amount of particles was distributed homogeneously. The mapping images of single and combined PTAA and spiro-OMeTAD components are shown in Fig. 2b–d. Additionally, PTIR spectra of both “particle” and “filler” sites were shown in the inserted topographic image of the film (Fig. 2e). The results identified that the skeleton region was PTAA-rich, and the rest interval area was spiro-OMeTAD-rich. In this HTM composite, the long chain polymer PTAA serves as the skeleton, which works like “sand” in “concrete”, while the small molecule spiro-OMeTAD is able to fill the gaps and enhance the adhesion, which could be regarded as “cement” in “concrete”.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were conducted to estimate the charge extraction and recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface. As shown in Fig. S4a, regardless of the different ratios, the photoluminescence of the perovskite layer quenched significantly when in contact with charge-extracting layers at nearly 780 nm, indicating efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. The perovskite/HTM interface is one of the main sources of luminescence quenching for perovskite devices. Combined with the TRPL results (Fig. S4b and Table S1), we could reasonably deduce that the introduction of PTAA into spiro-OMeTAD, to some extent, improved the charge extraction capability and reduced interfacial non-radiative recombination. Meanwhile, photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) was employed to estimate the energy band alignment of the perovskite/HTM interface. As shown in Fig. S5, the valence band of perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of different HTMs were obtained by PESA. The HOMO of HTMs shifts down from −5.00 eV to −5.15 eV with the PTAA ratio increasing from S1P0 to S0P1, which would facilitate hole injection from the perovskite to the top metal electrode.
Planar configuration (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/Au) PSCs based on two types of perovskites Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) and Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) with different ratios of spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA HTMs were fabricated. The two types of devices showed similar trends. The PCE of SMPHTC, especially S1P1, based PSCs is improved when compared to that of pure spiro-OMeTAD, pure PTAA or other ratio SMPHTC based PSCs. The average PCE measured under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) is improved from 18.9% of S1P0 (or 14.2% of S0P1) to 20.7% of S1P1 based Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSCs (Fig. 3a and Table 1). Similarly, the average PCE was improved from 18.2% of S1P0 (or 11.2% of S0P1) to 20.2% of S1P1 based Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSCs (Fig. S6 and Table S2). As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3, the lower open circuit voltage (VOC) of pure PTAA based PSCs could not be improved by merely increasing the thickness of the PTAA HTM layer. It might be induced by the poor conductivity and the possible oxygen de-doping effect that affects trap states. As shown in Fig. 3b, one of the optimized Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSCs based on S1P1 achieved a PCE of 22.7% (reverse 23.3% and forward 22.0%). As shown in Fig. 3c, compared with the S1P0 PSC and S0P1 PSC, the S1P1 PSC presented an obvious improved stable output of about 22.9% measured at 1.01 V.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with an appropriate equivalent circuit to estimate the charge extraction/recombination and polarization relaxation of the perovskite layers. In hybrid perovskites, both electronic conductivity and ionic conductivity contribute to charge transport, the equivalent circuit has a combination of resistor–capacitor circuits. As shown in Fig. S8, the Nyquist plots exhibit two arcs, which are associated with charge transport/extraction of PSC devices in the high frequency region and the Debye ionic relaxation in the low frequency region. The series resistance (Rs) corresponds to the resistance of full PSCs, and the difference originates from the resistance of different HTM layers considering other functional layers to be the same. Rext (extraction/transport resistance) and Cint (capacitance at interfaces of PSCs) originate from the charge extraction at interfaces of PSCs and are also related to the overall electronic charge transport properties of different layers. The component Rdr (resistance due to dielectric Debye relaxation) and Cdr (capacitance due to Debye relaxation) mainly originates from the Debye ionic relaxation of the perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S4, PSCs employing different ratios of spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA HTMs, especially S1P1, showed the minimum Rs and Rext, which indicates more efficient hole extraction/transport of SMPHTCs, resulting in the promoted short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The result of EIS is consistent with the results of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. As shown in Fig. S9, the PSCs based on SMPHTCs, especially the S1P1, possess the best photon-to-electron conversion efficiency compared with pure spiro-OMeTAD, pure PTAA or other ratio SMPHTC based PSCs. Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectrum of the S1P1 based PSC generates a current density of 22.7 mA cm−2. The integrated JSC is the highest among all samples, which may also reflect the improved hole extraction.
More importantly, the stability of SMPHTC based PSCs is improved substantially. As shown in Fig. 3d, thermal aging tests of Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSCs based on different ratios of spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA HTMs without encapsulation were carried out under inert conditions at 85 °C. The most stable PSCs were based on S1P1. They could even maintain 90% of the original efficiency after 1000 h of the thermal aging test (78% of the peak efficiency). Mild efficiency improvement during the initial stages of thermal aging tests could be observed. As a comparison, the PCE of pure spiro-OMeTAD/pure PTAA based PSCs dropped to merely 42%/15% of the original PCEs (37%/15% of the peak efficiencies, respectively). The stabilized power output (SPO) tracking at the initial maximum power point voltage (MPP, 0.96 V) of the S1P1 PSC was continuously conducted (Fig. 3e). The Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSC could maintain 92% of the initial efficiency after tracking for 560 h at room temperature without cooling. To further study the stability with respect to the synergistic aging test factors of the electric field, heat and light, the efficiency change at 85 °C was also tracked at the initial MPP voltage (0.97 V). As shown in Fig. S10, the efficiency decreased obviously in the 200 h test. Similarly, the PCE of S1P1 based MA-rich Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSCs also suffered an obvious decrease in the 85 °C test (Fig. S11).
To better understand the mechanism of thermal stability improvement, we firstly studied crystallization changes of SMPHTCs. As shown in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S12), pure spiro-OMeTAD crystallizes with strong and sharp diffraction peaks, while the polymer PTAA is amorphous without appreciable diffraction peaks. However the sharp diffraction peaks of spiro-OMeTAD disappeared after the incorporation of the PTAA polymer. This result proves that the introduction of the PTAA skeleton effectively suppresses the crystallization of the pure spiro-OMeTAD material. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with synchronous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were utilized to study the crystallographic properties of different ratios of spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA. As shown in Fig. S13, pure spiro-OMeTAD powder with LiTFSI and tBP additives presents an obvious glass transition phenomenon at 86 °C, which is similar to that observed in a previous report. In contrast, the glass transition phenomenon at 86 °C could not be clearly observed in S1P1 and pure PTAA.
The morphologies of different ratios of spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA HTM films coated on the perovskite film were characterized before and after the thermal aging test. As shown in Fig. 4a, HTM layers were deposited on the perovskite layer by spin-coating. The cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 4b) revealed that the thickness of HTMs decreased gradually with the increase of the PTAA content. The accurate thickness was obtained by step profiler measurements. As shown in Table S5, the film of S1P0 is the thickest, reaching 285 nm, and the pure PTAA film (S0P1) is 44 nm which is the thinnest, and the S1P1 film is 143 nm. This medium thickness may also contribute to the improved efficiency of S1P1 PSCs.
SEM images of perovskite films and different spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA ratio HTM films coated on perovskite films in Fig. 4c (fresh films) and Fig. 4d (films after annealing for 1000 h at 85 °C in a nitrogen filled glove box) showed an obvious difference in the microstructure. Firstly, the grain boundary of the perovskite film became “brighter” after the thermal aging test, which represents the decrease of conductivity and aggregation of electrons in SEM. Compared with the fresh perovskite film, some stacking features can be more commonly observed in the perovskite films after annealing for 1000 hours (the first column in Fig. 4d). Combined with the XRD results (Fig. S14), we could confirm that more PbI2 appeared in the perovskite film after the thermal aging test. We could reasonably deduce that in PSCs much volatile species were generated in the same aging test and these volatile species are likely to diffuse through the upper transport layer and induce degradation of PSCs. Meanwhile, some “stripes” could be observed in the fresh spiro-OMeTAD film. This feature became more distinct after the thermal aging test, and the film is no longer continuous with particles aggregated, which is similar to that reported in previous reports. This result further proves that pure spiro-OMeTAD is not an ideal HTM to withstand thermal stress under actual working conditions. Interestingly, even after coating with 10 mg mL−1 PTAA solution, the distinct grains of the perovskite film could still be observed in the SEM images of both before and after the thermal aging test (the last column in Fig. 4). The thickness of PTAA films prepared from 10 mg mL−1 to 50 mg mL−1 solution increased from 44 to 416 nm (Table S5). As shown in Fig. S15, the signal of the perovskite layer would be weaker after coating with concentrated PTAA solution, and PTAA can be observed when the thickness is increased. However, obvious holes can still be observed in the thicker PTAA film, and it is difficult to guarantee a device with high stability. By contrast, SMPHTC films are substantially different. No obvious morphological changes were observed in the SMPHTC coated perovskite films (e.g. S2P1 and S1P1) before and after the thermal aging test. Particularly for the S1P1 SMPHTC, the PTAA skeleton could effectively suppress the glass transition, crystallization and aggregation of the small molecule spiro-OMeTAD material, which could be responsible for the thermal stability improvement of SMPHTC based PSCs.
To further estimate the crystallization/aggregation difference of pure spiro-OMeTAD and the S1P1 SMPHTC and better understand the thermal stability difference in full PSC devices under thermal aging conditions, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were performed on both Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) and Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) full PSCs after the thermal aging test for 1000 h at 85 °C. The obtained results could be further used to estimate the diffusion of the metal electrode and volatile degradation species across the upper charge transport layer indirectly. The S1P0 Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSC shown in Fig. 5a and c–f and the S1P1 Cs0.06FA0.87MA0.07I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSC shown in Fig. 5b and g–j showed substantial differences. Lots of cavities/holes were presented in the large-scale HAADF-STEM cross-sectional image of the S1P0 HTM layer between the Au electrode and perovskite layer (Fig. 5a). Enlarged HAADF-STEM and EDX images (Fig. 5c–f) showed further features of the cavities/holes. The formation of cavities/holes in the S1P0 HTM layer could be reasonably attributed to the occurrence of morphological deformation of the pure spiro-OMeTAD layer under thermal aging conditions. In contrast, no obvious cavities/holes could be observed in the aged S1P1 HTM layer (Fig. 5b and g–j). Additionally, the Cs0.06FA0.58MA0.36I2.88Br0.12(Cl) PSCs based on pure spiro-OMeTAD and the S1P1 SMPHTC showed similar results. As shown in Fig. S16a, after the thermal aging test, the thickness of the HTM layer between the perovskite layer and Au electrode layer in S1P0 PSCs was not uniform (i.e. some regions are thick, and other regions are thin). Moreover, the Au and perovskite layers were almost in direct contact in some regions. The discontinuous HTM layer with lots of short-circuited channels could not effectively inhibit the diffusion of the metal electrode and components of the perovskite layer across the upper charge transport layer. In contrast, the electrode and perovskite layer were well separated by the SMPHTC layer in S1P1 PSCs (Fig. S16b), and the thickness was almost uniform and even the substrate was uneven. This suggested that the PTAA skeleton effectively suppressed the glass transition, and crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD, further preventing the formation of short-circuited and decomposed species diffusion channels. These results clearly clarified the mechanism of thermal stability improvement of PSCs.

In summary, by using a typical conductive polymer PTAA as the skeleton, and spiro-OMeTAD as the filler, we developed a robust “concrete”-like hole transport composite for planar PSCs. We carefully studied the low Tg glass transition suppression. We provided a thorough examination of the structural, distributional and morphological features of the composites and/or PSCs at the microscopic level. The aging test of the HTM layer and devices below 85 °C for 1000 h proved that the glass transition induced crystallization, physical deformation of the film and formation of short-circuited pathways were suppressed in this composite. The initial efficiency of PSCs based on the composite was improved substantially, in which the champion average PCE approaches 22.7% with negligible hysteresis (reverse 23.3% and forward 22.0%) and a stable output of about 22.9%. The modified PSCs also exhibited remarkable long-term thermal stability for more than 1000 h below 85 °C by maintaining 90% of the original efficiency, and 92% of the highest stabilized power output (SPO) after tracking for 560 h at room temperature. These results suggest a feasible and general approach to design and engineer the upper charge transport layer for highly efficient and stable PSCs and provide a clear understanding of the undesired low temperature glass transition of the charge transport layer. This could be extended to other optoelectronic devices.
