Herein, 3D hierarchical TiO2 microflowers with a well faceted profile and high crystallinity were successfully obtained via a surfactant directed single step facile hydrothermal technique. TiO2 thin films were subjected to different characterization techniques such as UV-Vis-NIR spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for their optical, structural, morphological and compositional analysis. The morphological characterization indicated that the microflowers are made from numerous nanorods growing homocentrically. The length, diameter and degree of aggregation of the nanorods increase rapidly and become aggregated with increase in concentration of CTAB. The effect of CTAB concentration on the microstructure and photoelectric properties of solar cells i.e. open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (η%) were investigated under UV illumination. The synthesized 3D hierarchical microflowers can act as a scattering overlayer and 1D nanorod underlayer. 1D nanorods can accelerate the movement of electrons in one direction, while microflowers can scatter light and can enhance the cell performance by light harvesting. An effective improvement in the photoconversion efficiency was observed and lies in the range 0.23% to 3.72%.

Over the past few years, many kinds of solar cells have been designed and fabricated. Titanium oxide (TiO2) received intensive interest due it's applications in lithium ion batteries, photocatalysis, self cleaning devices, quantum dot/dye sensitized solar cells (QD/DSSC) and tissue engineering scaffolds. In recent years, the control over the morphology of metal oxide has attracted great attention. TiO2 with different morphology such as nanoparticle, nanotube, nanorods, nanobelts, microsphere, nanofibers have been prepared by sol–gel method, electrochemical anodic oxidation, hydrothermal method, electrospinning method, chemical vapour deposition and spray pyrolysis technique. For instance, the aforesaid the 1D nanostructure possess low internal surface area resulting poor light harvesting and low conversion efficiency. One cure for this problem is to synthesize branched nanostructure or to synthesize 3D nanostructure, which provides large internal surface area for better light harvesting for better conversion efficiency.

Recently, considerable results were achieved with self assembled 1D nanostructure into 3D hierarchical architecture because longer pathway for photon transports, large number of active sites, unique multidimensional hybrid morphology and enhanced light harvesting property. Till now, extensive research has been conducted to improve PEC performances with scattering layers in the field of materials chemistry, Y. C. Park et al. synthesized mesoporous TiO2 as a scattering layer by a two step synthesis process with highest efficiency 9.37%. J. Jiang et al. demonstrated novel microemulsion-based spherical multihollow TiO2 nanostructures by two step synthesis which acts as scattering overlayer and Degussa P25 underlayer gives 2.33% conversion efficiency. 9.43% energy conversion efficiency based on DSSC is achieved by H. J. Koo et al. by preparing a nano-embossed hollow spherical TiO2 layer on 20 nm thick TiO2 particulate film. S. R. Gajjela et al. reported a photoconversion efficiency of 10.63% for 1 Sun MPT while 10.84% for 0.16 Sun MPT based on DSSC after surface treatment by 40 mM TiCl4 (aq.) solution and screen printing by MPT or NPT of TiO2. H. Pang et al. demonstrated the visible range scattering effect of the submicron-sized hollow TiO2 spheres and a bilayered photoelectrode constructed by coating approximately 10 μm thick layer of the hollow TiO2 on top of approximately 10 μm layer of commercial P25 TiO2 which gives conversion efficiency 7.48%. All above results based on two step synthesis of double layered/bilayered TiO2 for effective solar cell performance.
Herein we design a novel hierarchical multidimensional hybrid structured TiO2 photoanode by facile one step hydrothermal method. In preliminary the TiO2 thin films were synthesized without CTAB surfactant (sample S1) and in order to investigate the effect of CTAB surfactant on morphology, the concentration of CTAB was varied from 0.025–0.15% (S2–S5). This shows enhancement in the photoconversion efficiency from 0.23–3.72% by providing the direct pathway for photogenerated electrons to flow through TiO2/FTO interface. There is formation of TiO2 microflowers which is act as scattering overlayer and nanorod underlayer. Therefore it is significant to fabricate hierarchical TiO2 photoanode with both high light harvesting and good electron transferring property.

The chemical reagents used for the synthesis of hierarchical multidimensional hybrid structured TiO2 microflowers were commercially available titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethylene glycol (EG) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a Ti-precursors, acid medium, cosolvent and surfactant respectively. To prepare TiO2 thin films a mixture of 0.04 M TTIP, 3 M HCl and EG (TTIP:EG = 1:1) were used as a starting material, mixed with appropriate volume and stirred for 30 min. To this mixture different percentage of CTAB were added, again stirred for another 10 min to improve its homogeneity. The mixed solution was transfer into Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave containing FTO with conducting side facing up. Subsequently, autoclave was maintained at 160 °C for 6 h, cool the autoclave naturally. Then TiO2 thin film removed from autoclave washed with water dried in air and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h.

In order to investigate the effect of CTAB on the morphology and photoelectrochemical performance the concentration of CTAB was varied from 0.00%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.15% samples designated as S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 respectively. The reaction temperature and time is kept constant as, 160 °C and 6 h respectively for all deposition.

The crystal structure of the samples were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with Rigaku, D/MAX Ultima III XRD spectrometer (Japan) using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in 2θ range 20–80°. The morphology and microstructure were examined by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) model (SEM, JEOL-6360) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The elemental composition and valance state of elements were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a VG Multilab 2000-Thermo Scientific, USA, K-alpha. UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-1800 (Japan) in the wavelength range 350–1100 nm. Crystallographic characterization was done by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern by using TECNAI F20 Philips, operating at an acceleration voltage 200 kV. The photoelectrochemical measurement was carried out by irradiating the photoanode (TiO2) with UV light recorded at electrochemical workstation AUTOLAB PGSTAT100 potentiostat. The photoelectrochemical cell was a two electrode system: TiO2 film as a working electrode with active surface area of 1 cm2, Graphite as a counter electrode and 0.1 M NaOH as an electrolyte illuminated by 5 mW cm−2 intensity UV source. The charge recombination properties and electron transport resistance of TiO2 microflowers were investigated by electrochemical impedance measurements (model: AUTOLAB PGSTAT100 potentiostat) in frequency range 0.1–105 Hz.


The growth of hybrid nanostructured TiO2 microflowers takes place by formation of titanium glycolate complex via hydrothermal treatment. The Ti species initially react with ethylene glycol (EG) to form large molecular network by complexation between EG and Ti species to form, [Ti(OC3H7)m(OC2H4OH)6−m](4−m) species. In this reaction process (OC2H4OH)− as a barrier to control the hydrolysis rate of Ti(OC3H7)4 in water. At high temperature and pressure condition hydrolysis was accelerated to form [Ti(OH)n(OC3H7)m(OC2H4OH)6−n−m](4−n+m) species leading to nucleation which is advantageous for further growth. Then the addition of CTAB enhances the surface morphology. After addition of CTAB the hydrogen atom of the OH group can be substituted with cationic head group of CTAB which results in the formation of spherical composite consisting micelle. The role of hydrochloric acid to make the Ti species be charged leads to electrostatic repulsion between charged [Ti(OH)n(OC3H7)m(OC2H4OH)6−n−m](4−n+m) species which is beneficial for the formation of microflowers like structure (Scheme 1).


The band gap energy (Eg), type of transition and absorption coefficient (α) of TiO2 thin films were determined from optical absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1. The optical absorption of S1– S5 samples shown in Fig. 1 indicates absorption lies mainly in UV region due to its wide band gap (3.02 eV). The strong UV absorption of TiO2 sample is due to electronic transition of electron from valance band to conduction band. The absorption coefficient can be expressed by eqn (1).


αhν = a(hν − Eg)n

(1)
where,
α is absorption coefficient, hν is photon energy, Eg is band gap energy, A is constant.

The exponent ‘n’ depends on nature of transition during absorption process. For direct allowed transition n = 1/2 and for indirect allowed transition n = 2. The band gap energy can be estimated by extrapolating straight portion of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν) shown in inset of Fig. 1 indicating indirect and allowed optical transition.
The band gap energy determined and it varies between 2.89–2.94 eV for samples S1–S5 respectively thus there is no remarkable change is observed in band gap of TiO2 upon addition of CTAB.

The XRD pattern of 3D hierarchical hybrid structured TiO2 microflowers shown in Fig. 2. From XRD, the 2θ values 27.70°, 36.22°, 41.35°, 54.58°and 56.97° assigned to (110), (101), (111), (211), and (220) crystal planes of TiO2. All the peaks observed in XRD are indexed to Tetragonal rutile phase of TiO2 with lattice constant a = 4.5570 Å and c = 2.9457 Å which is well agreement with standard space group: P42/mnm, JCPDS: 00001-0562 (Table 1).

The presence of highly intense, well defined and sharp peaks indicates good crystallinity of the samples. The other peaks observed in XRD which are originated from FTO substrate. The XRD pattern of TiO2 thin films shows no difference in the peak orientation. This indicates that on increase in surfactant concentration there is increase in intensity of reflection. Average crystallite size of TiO2 sample were calculated by using Scherrer's formula shown in eqn (2).

where,
θ is Peak position of X-ray diffraction, β is Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM) of (110) plane for rutile TiO2 in radian. λ is Wavelength of X-ray used (0.154 nm).

The calculated crystallite size of TiO2 for (110) planes are found to be 39, 30, 28, 27 and 23 nm for S1–S5 samples respectively, such crystalline nature suppress the electron hole pair recombination which is beneficial for enhancement in the PEC performance. The * symbol indicates the presence of peak due to FTO substrate.

Crystallographic characterization of hybrid structured TiO2 microflowers was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shown in Fig. 3(a).

The basic unit of TiO2 is made up of nanorods as building blocks assembled to form microflowers with length 1.5 μm and diameter 5 μm which is well agreement with SEM results. HRTEM (Fig. 3b) study illustrate that the TiO2 microflowers possess a single crystalline structure of rutile TiO2 with lattice spacing d110 = 3.3 Å indicating the growth along [110] crystal plane with preferred [001] orientation it is well indexed with XRD results. The [110] plane is thermodynamically stable plane so; the growth rate along this plane is faster than that of the other planes. Fig. 3(b) indicates that the microflower is made from numerous nanorods having average diameter 25 nm. The TEM observation is consistent with the XRD results.
SAED pattern shown in Fig. 3(c) manifests that TiO2 microflowers are not aggregation of small crystallites but made up of monocrystal nanorods growing homocentrically. HRTEM and corresponding SAED pattern confirms single crystalline nature of TiO2 microflowers and the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance can be attributed to improved charge-separation by superior charge transportation through single-crystalline 3D TiO2 microflowers.

Fig. 4 shows top view and cross sectional view of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for S1–S5 samples of hierarchical hybrid structured TiO2 microflowers on FTO substrate prepared by a simple single step hydrothermal method. In preliminary the TiO2 thin films were synthesized without CTAB surfactant (sample S1) and in order to investigate the effect of CTAB surfactant on morphology, the concentration of CTAB was varied from 0.025–0.15% (S2–S5).

The SEM study manifests that the shape of microflowers changes significantly from samples S1 to S5. By increasing concentration of CTAB the length, diameter and degree of aggregation of nanorods are increased and formation of microflowers takes place by nanorods growing homocentrically. In case of sample S1 there is formation of incompletely grown microflower while as the surfactant concentration increases well defined microflowers were formed. Such microflowers are made from numerous nanorods display open structure, extended outside and become gradually compact inside.
The cross sectional view of the sample S4 Fig. 4(b) showing that the obtained material is made from two parts, the upper part is made from microflowers with diameter 5 μm while the lower part is made from nanorods nearly perpendicular to FTO with 1.5 μm length. Most of nanorods are densely packed in to bundles. The 1D nanorods can accelerate the movement of electron in one direction while 3D hierarchical microflowers being used as a scattering layer and it can enhance the cell performance by light harvesting. Therefore, double layered structure with scattering layer has been widely used to improve the conversion efficiency of solar cell. It is also observed that there is good connection between microflowers and nanorods which strengthened the interpartical connection offering abundant transfer pathway for photogenerated electrons improving the solar cell performance.

Chemical composition of pure TiO2 estimated by energy dispersive spectroscopy [EDS] shown in Fig.5. The EDS spectrum shows prominent peak of titanium [Ti] and oxygen [O]. From the EDS pattern it is confirmed that, TiO2 microflowers synthesized by hydrothermal method belong to pure TiO2 (1:2).


The elemental composition and valance state of elements present in the material was determined by XPS spectra shown in Fig. 6. The XPS survey spectrum Fig. 6(a) indicates the presence of Ti, O and also C elements.

The presence of carbon at binding energy 284.05 was due to surface contamination when TiO2 thin film was exposed to atmosphere. The core level spectrum of Ti 2p Fig. 6(b) shows peak at binding energy 464.27 and 458.49 eV attributed to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 respectively. The energy difference between Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peak was found to be 5.78 eV which corresponds to Ti4+ state of titanium in rutile TiO2 which is well agreement with standard value.
The high resolution scan of O 1s peak shown in Fig. 6(c) can be deconvoluted into two peaks at binding energy 529.58 and 531.52 eV respectively. The peak at binding energy 529.58 eV corresponds to lattice Oxygen (O–Ti–O) and latter is related to hydroxyl group (OH) adsorbed during transfer.

Fig. 7 demonstrates the photocurrent density versus the voltage plot recorded by using linear sweep voltammogram with two electrodes system illuminated under 5 mW cm−2 UV light. The cell configuration used to record the J–V curve is as follows, Glass/FTO/TiO2/0.1 M NaOH/G.

The photoelectric performance i.e. Fill Factor (FF) and overall light to electric energy conversion efficiency (η%) was calculated by eqn (3) and (4) respectively as follows.
(3)
where,
Voc is open circuit voltage, Jsc is short circuit current density, Vmax is maximum voltage, Jmax is maximum current density.

(4)
The solar cell based on hierarchical hybrid structured TiO2 photoanode gives a short circuit current density (Jsc) 0.113 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) 383 mV and fill factor (FF) 0.28 yields a power conversion efficiency (η%) is 0.23% for ‘S1’ sample. Effective enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance is observed with increase in CTAB concentration.
As the CTAB concentration is 0.1% for sample S4 the photocurrent density increases up to 1.255 mA cm−2, Voc is 573 mV and FF is 0.26 giving rise to 3.72% power conversion efficiency. There is sharp increase in photovoltaic performance from sample S3 to S4. This is because in case of sample S3 the unabsorbed light penetrates through nanorods without being scattered for the improvement in PEC performance but for samples S4 the microflowers are assembled with nanorods to form microflowers causes scattering of incident light many times for better photoconversion efficiency i.e. 3.72%.
Such improvement in conversion efficiency can be explained on the basis of surface modification by CTAB. The improvement in the energy conversion is due to bilayered structure of TiO2 in which 3D microflowers can act as a scattering overlayer and 1D nanorods underlayer (Scheme 2). The 1D nanorods can accelerate the movement of electron in one direction while 3D hierarchical microflowers being used as a scattering layer and it can enhance the cell performance by light harvesting. The microflowers forms a compact layer, which favours the accumulation of electrons at the TiO2/FTO interface resulting shifting its potential to higher value.
As the concentration of CTAB increased above 0.1% (sample S5) the rods are densely packed into bundles. Due to formation of densely packed bundles on the surface less scattering of light takes place which results into decrease in the power conversion efficiency. Due to that reason sample S5 posses low photoconversion efficiency i.e. 1.18%. Thus, the effect of surfactant on the photoelectrical performance was summarized in the Table 2.
The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were examined from J–V curve using eqn (5) and (6) respectively as follows,
(5)
(6)
The ideal solar cells have Rsh value approaching infinity and Rs near zero. The variation in Rs and Rsh summarized in the Table 2 and Rs and Rsh varies from 471.76 to 2367.6 Ω and 571.42 to 10365 Ω respectively for sample S1–S5. High value Rsh of the material shows no shorts of current in circuit and low value Rs gives high current flow through the circuit. Thus the monotonic increase in open circuit voltage (Voc) due to less resistance to electron transfer and reduction in charge recombination rate. These voltage characteristics largely dependent on shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs).

Electrochemical impendence is a powerful steady-state technique used to measure the ability of circuit to resists to the flow of electric current. In typical impendence spectra we observed three electric arcs in the frequency range 103 to 105 Hz corresponds to the resistance at FTO conducting layer/TiO2 interface, 1–103 Hz and 0.1–1 Hz have been assigned to the resistance at TiO2/Electrolyte interface and counter electrode/electrolyte respectively.

Fig. 8 shows Nyquist plots for samples S1–S5, measured under 0.6 V open circuit voltage in dark and frequency range is from 0.1–105 Hz. The equivalent circuit model fitted to the value is shown in inset of Fig. 8. The equivalent circuit consists of various components: ohmic series resistance [Rs], charge transfer resistance at counter electrode/Electrolyte interface (R1), charge transfer resistance at TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface (R2), constant phase capacitance corresponds to R1 and R2 are CPE1 and CPE2 respectively and fitted values are listed in the Table 3

Electrochemical impendence study reveals that at lower series resistance for sample S4 (85.3 Ω cm−2) which favours the injection of more electrons to the TiO2 photoanode and thereby raising the Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode and thus shifting its potential to higher value causes enhancement in the photoconversion efficiency.
EIS study suggests that the electric arcs for sample S1–S5 at high frequency region and the electron concentration in TiO2 is low due to frequent recombination, referable to reason that efficiency of TiO2 is limited. The EIS measurement reveals that the impedance of both the electrochemical reaction at counter electrode (R1) and the charge transfer at TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface (R2) decreases with surface modification by CTAB. The substantial reduction in resistance mainly ascribed to the improvement in the electron transport. Thus, the sample S4 has R1 = 1020 Ω cm−2 and R2 = 3770 Ω cm−2 which shows lower resistance than that of other samples. Lower the resistance to the flow photogenerated charge carriers adventitious for higher conversion efficiency.

In this study the, surfactant directed single step facile hydrothermal technique was implemented to form better interconnecting network of TiO2 microflowers for boosting the photoelectrochemical performance. Different CTAB concentration reveals the formation of nanorods assembled microflowers with different length, diameter and degree of aggregation with high crystallinity contribute positively in photoelectrochemical performance. The SEM study manifests that microflowers are made from numerous nanorods growing homocentrally, display open structure, extended outside and becomes gradually compact inside. The 3D hierarchical microflowers can act a scattering overlayer while the 1D nanorods underlayer. By using this underlayer and overlayer built from nanorod and microflowers, TiO2 photoanode was constructed. The microflowers forms a compact layer, which favours the accumulation of electrons at the TiO2/FTO interface resulting shifting its potential to higher value. The increase in CTAB concentration (S1–S5) results into increase in power conversion efficiency from 0.23–3.72 %. The monotonic increase in power conversion efficiency is due to less resistance to electron transfer and reduction in charge recombination rate. As well EIS study demonstrated that, lower series resistance (85.3 Ω cm−2) is favourable for injection of more electrons to the TiO2 photoanode causes rising in Fermi energy level of the TiO2 photoanode. The overall study signifies that, the formation of hybrid structured TiO2 microflowers is highly useful for enhancement in power conversion efficiency due to high crystallinity, well-interconnected compact layer and scattering phenomenon.
