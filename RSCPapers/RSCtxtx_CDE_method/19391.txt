Fast recombination of electrons from semiconductors with the oxidized redox species in the electrolyte represents a major bottleneck in the improvement of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). While processes at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface are well studied on TiO2 electrodes, the interactions of the ZnO surface with the electrolyte solution in DSSCs are less explored. This work aims at clarifying the different impact of the two contrasting redox couples I3−/I− or [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ (bpy-pz = bis(6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine)) in electrolytes containing either no additives or Li+ ions and/or 4-tert-butlypyridine (TBP) in DSSCs using screen-printed nanoparticulate TiO2 (NP-TiO2) or electrodeposited ZnO (ED-ZnO) photoanodes sensitized with the indoline dye DN216. A detailed photoelectrochemical study is performed to investigate light absorption, charge transfer and mass transport in these cells. We demonstrate that the chemical nature of the semiconductor directly influences the affinity of adsorbates. This drastically influences the energy levels and recombination kinetics at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, electron and ion transport in the porous system as well as light absorption of dye molecules by the Stark effect. The present investigation reveals the origin of major performance losses in DSSCs based on ED-ZnO photoanodes as well as the relevance of ionic interactions with NP-TiO2 photoanodes that can both serve as the starting point for rationally guided improvement of their conversion efficiencies.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received attention in the last few years as an economic, efficient and sustainable alternative to established technologies. Especially in niche applications, DSSCs are discussed as a promising candidate for the generation of electric power. These cells can yield high conversion efficiency under indoor lighting and can be prepared on flexible or textile-based substrates. The conventional methods for DSSC preparation from TiO2 nanoparticle pastes include one or more energy-demanding, high-temperature processes and are limited to the preparation on planar substrates. Thus, such films are not applicable to polymeric and fiber substrates. The highest efficiencies by improved open circuit photovoltages (Voc) in DSSCs are achieved by utilizing reversible redox couples such as cobalt or copper complexes as redox mediators (Scheme 1a). To fully exploit their fast kinetics of dye regeneration these redox couples require fast mediator diffusion and high electron mobility in the porous photoanode to compensate faster recombination rates compared to the classical I3−/I− redox system. However, photoanodes for DSSCs processed at low temperature mostly suffer from poor nanoparticle interconnection and, therefore, low electron mobilities. Replacement of the commonly used nanoparticulate TiO2 (NP-TiO2) photoanodes by electrodeposited porous ZnO (ED-ZnO) paves a possible way to prepare photoanodes by low-temperature processes (70 °C) on conductive substrates of arbitrary shape without sacrificing the electron mobility. ED-ZnO, therefore, is an ideal substitutional material for TiO2. Its use can open the door for using DSSCs with reversible redox couples in a wider range of applications.

Although ZnO offers a similar bandgap, position of band edges and charge carrier mobility to TiO2 which should theoretically enable its use in DSSCs with similar efficiencies, significantly lower record efficiencies of 8.0% have been reported for ZnO-based devices compared to 14.3% for TiO2-based devices. This discrepancy has already been the subject of several studies, from which the following conclusions can be summarized: (i) the conventional sensitizing dye molecules used on TiO2 are incompatible with ZnO since their acidity can decompose ZnO. (ii) The injected electrons are more strongly bound to oxidized dye molecules in ZnO because of a lower permittivity of ZnO leading to the overall lower quantum efficiencies. (iii) Recombination is faster in ZnO which leads to significantly lower photovoltages compared to their TiO2-based counterparts. These findings leave room for improvements of ZnO-based DSSCs. The general understanding of the interplay between electrolyte components and sensitized semiconductor interfaces was extended over the years with significant optimization in the electrolyte composition for TiO2-based DSSCs. Considerably less progress was made in the understanding of the effect of electrolyte components in ZnO-based DSSCs. Instead, electrolytes optimized for TiO2 were tested for ZnO cells but they showed rather low performance for reasons (i)–(iii) stated above. It is, therefore, important to investigate the specific effect of the electrolyte components on the respective photoanode materials to understand how they might influence the rate of recombination reactions. Consequently, Ziółek et al. have studied the effect of electrolyte additives on nanoparticulate ZnO (NP-ZnO) photoanodes compared to NP-TiO2. They found significantly lower efficiency of NP-ZnO and did not find any influence of additives on the properties of NP-ZnO-based devices, although NP-TiO2 was shown to be very sensitive to the electrolyte composition. This contrast was explained by a different permittivity of ZnO and a significantly higher density of deep trap states in NP-ZnO. On the other hand, ED-ZnO has shown to produce reasonable efficiencies as a photoanode material in the past. In combination with an indoline sensitizer, such as DN216 (Scheme 1b), one would expect similar efficiencies for both NP-TiO2 and ED-ZnO photoanodes. For both materials, devices with high quantum efficiencies, fill factors and high open-circuit voltages have been demonstrated. In particular, ED-ZnO photoanode materials show a steep distribution of trap states below the conduction band. These traps in ED-ZnO should not mitigate the performance of electrolyte additives as opposed to NP-ZnO in ref. 23. In fact, Ciofini et al. have found that additive 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) shows a clear effect on the performance of DSSCs based on ED-ZnO. Furthermore, reversible redox couples, such as cobalt complexes, have been identified to show contrasting interactions with electrolyte additives as compared to I3−/I−. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no direct studies available on the influence of different components in the redox electrolyte with NP-TiO2 compared to ED-ZnO photoanodes.
Thus, this study aims at investigating the interplay of components in the redox electrolyte such as the redox couples I3−/I− and [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ (bpy-pz = bis(6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine)) (Scheme 1c) as mediators and additives (Li+, (TBP)), with NP-TiO2 or ED-ZnO photoanodes, in order to clarify the reasons for higher performance of NP-TiO2-based DSSCs compared to ED-ZnO. Solar cells were prepared and characterized by current–voltage (I–V) characterization, photocurrent spectroscopy to measure incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and optical transmission spectroscopy. A single donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) indoline dye DN216 was used as a sensitizer allowing for a good comparison of the influence of electrolyte components. Effects predicted from the literature are observed on NP-TiO2. New relevant interactions with NP-TiO2 are established and it is demonstrated that electrolyte components often have a completely different impact on ED-ZnO photoanodes.

The preparation of ED-ZnO photoanodes followed the procedure described in detail elsewhere. In brief, glass sheets with aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO, Kaivo, <10 Ω □−1) were ultrasonically cleaned with RBS® 25 solution (Roth), acetone and 2-propanol. A cleaned AZO sheet attached to a rotating disk electrode (Belltec) with 500 rpm was used as a working electrode in a three-electrode setup for the electrodeposition of ZnO. The reference electrode was a RedRod Ag/AgCl electrode with 0.152 V vs. NHE at 70 °C (Radiometer Analytical) and the auxiliary electrode was a coiled platinum wire with an immersed surface area of approximately 1 cm2. The deposition bath consisted of an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KCl and 5 mM ZnCl2 (Merck, >98%) heated to 70 °C and continuously purged with oxygen. For the deposition of a compact ZnO underlayer, a potential of −1.06 V was applied for 10 min. Afterwards, 50 μM of eosin Y (Chemplex, >88%) was added, the platinum wire was exchanged for a zinc wire and −0.96 V was applied for 20 min in order to deposit a hybrid ZnO/eosinY film on top of the compact layer. Immediately after the deposition, the samples were immersed in an aqueous solution of KOH (pH 10.5, 70 °C) and left there for 16 h. Finally, the samples were rinsed with water and dried in air resulting in porous ED-ZnO films with a thickness of 2.5 to 3 μm as determined by profilometry.

For the preparation of NP-TiO2 photoanodes, FTO substrates (NSG-10, Nippon Sheet Glass) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath subsequently using ethanol and acetone for 10 min. The substrates were heated to 500 °C and annealed for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were immersed in 53 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min followed by rinsing with water and ethanol. The TiO2 paste (18 NR-T, DYESOL) which contains ca. 20 nm TiO2 particles was screen-printed onto the substrates, and then heated at 450 °C for 30 min to remove organic components and to sinter TiO2 nanoparticles. The prepared ca. 3 μm thick NP-TiO2 films were again immersed in 53 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min. After rinsing with water and ethanol, the substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min.

Sensitization of the photoanodes was carried out in a solution of 0.5 mM 5-[3-(carboxymethyl)-5-[[4-[4-(2,2-diphenylethenyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydrocyclopent[b]indol-7-yl]methylene]-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene]-4-oxo-2-thioxo-3-thiazolidinehexanoic acid (DN216) and 1 mM lithocholic acid in a 1:1 (v:v) acetonitrile:tert-butanol ratio for 15 min (ED-ZnO) or 60 min (NP-TiO2) at room temperature. Different adsorption times were chosen for ED-ZnO and NP-TiO2 samples because of different dye adsorption rates in order to achieve a similar dye coverage. Several redox electrolytes of mediators I3−/I− (I-el) or [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ (Co-el) with either no additives (pure), 0.1 M Li+ (Li+), 0.5 M 4-tert-butlypyridine (TBP) or 0.1 M Li+ and 0.5 M 4-tert-butlypyridine (Li+ and TBP) were used whose detailed compositions are listed in Table 1. In all cases, the solvent was acetonitrile. As counter electrodes, predrilled and cleaned FTO coated glass sheets (Kaivo, <15 Ω □−1) were either modified with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layer for Co-el based cells by electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (Sigma-Aldrich, >97%) as described before, or coated with platinum for I-el based cells by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, >37.5% Pt basis). The counter electrodes were attached to the working electrodes by hot-melting Surlyn® foil (25 μm). The electrolyte was injected through the filling holes in the counter electrodes that were sealed by a coverslip glass and Surlyn® foil.

Current–voltage (I–V) characterization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photocurrent spectroscopy to measure the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were performed on solar cells using an IM6 potentiostat and a CIMPSpcs system (Zahner Elektrik). All measurements shown in this study were carried out at least 1 hour after device assembly in order to ensure that the respective DSSC characteristics have equilibrated. I–V characteristics were measured at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 with 0.01 V steps in the dark or under illumination (100 mW cm−2) by an LS0106 Xenon arc lamp with an LSZ189 AM 1.5G filter (LOT-Oriel) calibrated with an ML-020VM pyranometer (EKO Instruments). The cells had a circular active area of 0.283 cm2 and were covered with a circular mask with an area of 0.385 cm2 (slightly larger than the active area as suggested in ref. 40). The deviation of DSSC characteristics from the mean value was less than 7% as determined by fivefold reproduction of the cell with the highest efficiency. EIS was performed in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.3 Hz with an amplitude of 0.01 V under open-circuit conditions and illumination by a green LED (510 nm) at different intensities to achieve measurements at different open-circuit voltages Voc. The resulting spectra were fitted with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S1a (ESI). IPCE measurements were performed using a white LED with a monochromator at an intensity of 0.1 mW cm−2 with a sinusoidal modulation of 30%, controlled with a Thorlabs Si photodiode FDS100. IMPS was performed under short-circuit conditions and illumination by a red LED (632 nm) with several intensities to achieve measurements at different short-circuit current densities jsc. The light intensity was modulated by 5% and the frequency range was the same as for EIS.

Diffuse transmission spectroscopy was performed by mounting the DSSCs in front of an integrating sphere (getProbe 5393 SET, getAMO) and illuminating through the working electrode. The transmitted light was integrated for 3.6 s using a tec5 spectrometer, the measurement was repeated 20 times and the data were averaged. Since the samples did not have a scattering layer the losses due to back scattering were minimal.
Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) analysis was performed in an instrument that has developed steadily in this laboratory. Compared to the last description, a piezoelectric actuator for the vertical approach and the control electronics (P780.20 and E665, Physikinstrumente), a digital potentiostat (Gamry Ref600) and a set of motors and controllers for the positioning of the microelectrode in the horizontal direction (N661.21A, Nexcect controller E681, Physikinstrumente) were incorporated. Sensitized ED-ZnO photoanodes were illuminated on an area of 1.5 mm2 by a blue LED (455 nm) at a fixed photon flux of Jhv ≈ 1.43 × 10−5 mol cm2 s−1 managed by an XPOT potentiostat (Zahner Elektrik) using the reading of a photodiode in the beam. The light intensity was calibrated with a power meter (Gigahertz-Optik). The SECM working electrodes were Au microdisk electrodes for Co-el and Pt microdisk electrodes for I-el with an average radius rT of 25 μm and sheath thickness rglass = 75 μm (RG = rglass/rT = 3). The auxiliary electrode and the quasi-reference electrodes were Pt wires. The approach curves were recorded at a translation rate of 0.5 μm s−1 in solutions of different oxidized mediator concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 2 mM in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. All the experiments were run using the program SECMx.

The I–V characteristics of DSSCs with either NP-TiO2 or ED-ZnO as a photoanode, I3−/I− or [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ as a redox mediator and different combinations of additives were measured. The extracted parameters, short-circuit photocurrent density jsc, open-circuit photovoltage Voc, fill factor FF and power conversion efficiency PCE, are listed in Table 2. The respective I–V curves are shown in Fig. S2c and d (ESI). With the I-el redox electrolytes ED-ZnO achieved a PCE comparable to that of NP-TiO2. For NP-TiO2, these are the highest efficiencies achieved in this study. We note that the efficiencies for our NP-TiO2-based cells are lower than established literature data with similar sensitizers, most apparent from the roughly halved jsc. The IPCE measurements (Fig. S2a and b, ESI), however, indicate facile injection and regeneration in our cells since IPCE values ≥ 80% were achieved for both NP-TiO2 and ED-ZnO. The small increase of IPCE towards the absorption maximum indicates rather weak overall light harvesting which is due to the slightly different sensitizer molecule, a lower film thickness and the lack of a light scattering layer. These conditions have been chosen to allow a reasonable comparison between the cells with different photoanodes, mediators and additives. For highly efficient DSSCs, the film thickness should be increased and a scattering layer has to be added. However, Voc and FF of NP-TiO2-based DSSCs with the I-el redox mediator were found to be in good correspondence with the literature using a related indoline dye D149. Thus, despite the lower reported PCE the present results are of relevance for high-efficiency DSSCs.

We observe that the performance of ED-ZnO is the highest in pure I-el opposed to even small enhancements of the performance for NP-TiO2 when additives are added to these solutions. These results confirm the findings made by Ciofini et al. for ED-ZnO and deviate from the findings of Ziółek et al. for NP-ZnO. Furthermore, additives clearly enhance the PCE in cells with Co-el for both NP-TiO2 and ED-ZnO as photoanodes. When Co-el is used with NP-TiO2, the efficiencies largely deteriorate compared to I-el, which is most notably due to a low jsc. For ED-ZnO, even a higher efficiency can be achieved with Co-el than with I-el because of the higher Voc resulting from the more positive formal redox potential of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ (E0 = 0.86 V vs. NHE compared to E0(I3−/I−) = 0.35 V vs. NHE). Please note that sensitizer DN216 used here lacks sterically demanding alkyl or alkoxy side chains, which have been found to be necessary to achieve high-efficiency DSSCs with cobalt redox mediators and NP-TiO2. Interestingly, this seems to be less important for ED-ZnO-based devices. The highest efficiency of 4.81% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and 5.15% under 53.4 mW cm−2 illumination was reached for an ED-ZnO-based device with [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ and both Li+ and TBP as additives (Fig. S2e and f, ESI).

For each cell shown in Table 2, EIS was performed at different Voc achieved by different background illumination intensities. The spectra were fitted with the model shown in Fig. S1a (ESI) and the extracted parameters are depicted in Fig. 1. According to the model described in the ESI, the chemical capacitance Cμ was obtained from the capacitance Cse in Fig. 1a and c (eqn (SI-1), ESI). The recombination resistance Rrec was extrapolated from the resistance Rse in Fig. 1b and d as described in the ESI. Experiments with the sample in contact with pure I-el served as a reference for obtaining the relative conduction band position ΔEcb (Fig. 1e, eqn (SI-2), ESI) and the Voc-loss due to recombination ΔVrecoc (Fig. 1f, eqn (SI-5), ESI). A schematic view of the energy levels in the cells, the observed differences and their consequences for ΔEcb and ΔVrecoc are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI).

The observed shift in Cμ (Fig. 1a and c) showed that adding Li+ to the I3−/I− electrolyte induces a downward shift of the conduction band edge energy Ecb in both NP-TiO2- and ED-ZnO-based DSSCs when compared to the respective cells in contact with the pure electrolyte (Fig. 1e). Li+ is sufficiently small to penetrate the dye layer and adsorb onto the semiconductor surface. The resulting positive surface charge stabilizes the electrons in the semiconductors leading to a downward shift in their potential. Thus, the adsorption of small ions such as Li+ is often used to influence the electrode potential. However, the expected Voc loss of the cells due to the downward shift of Ecb would be far higher than that observed experimentally. This deviation is caused by passivation of the semiconductor surface against recombination of electrons with the oxidized redox species by adsorbed Li+ ions which is evident from a higher Rrec (Fig. 1b, d and f).
A decreased PCE upon Li+ addition was observed for the ED-ZnO cells with I3−/I−-based electrolytes as opposed to a PCE increase for NP-TiO2 cells (Table 2). Transmission spectroscopy (Fig. S3b, ESI) reveals a shift of the absorption maximum of the dye to shorter wavelength when adsorbed onto ED-ZnO and in contact with the Li+-containing I-el electrolyte. This indicates an interaction of Li+ with the dye bound to ED-ZnO. Such interaction may influence the binding of I− or I2− to the dye and lead to less efficient dye regeneration, which would explain the observed decrease in jsc (Table 2). We further note that the PCE of these cells deteriorates over some days after cell assembly (Fig. S3a, ESI), most apparent from the decrease of jsc. Interestingly, the effect of Li+ on Cμ and Rrec is weakened over this time scale, slowly returning to the values of the Li+-free electrolyte (Fig. S3c–f, ESI). This indicates that the interaction of the dye with Li+ progresses over time and fewer Li+ ions are adsorbed on the semiconductor surface. In order to exclude the possibility that the particular Li+ source (LiI) causes a lower jsc, we prepared cells with LiClO4 as the Li+ source and found basically the same change (Fig. S3a, ESI). Interestingly, adding Li+ to Co-el electrolytes in combination with ED-ZnO or to any electrolyte in contact with NP-TiO2 does not show such negative influence. We propose that binding of Li+ on NP-TiO2 is more favorable than interacting with the DN216 molecules and, thus, such an effect is not observed.
Adsorption of cations onto the semiconductor surface induces an electric field across the dye layer. This field imparts a Stark-effect on D–π–A sensitizers such as DN216 by stabilization of the LUMO (semiconductor-side) relative to the HOMO (electrolyte side), as illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI). This causes a red shift in the absorption edge ΔEabs that is measured by diffuse transmission spectroscopy of the DSSCs (Fig. 3a). This shift is found to directly correlate with ΔEcb (Fig. 3b) and, thus, both effects can act as a monitor for the concentration of cations adsorbed at the semiconductor surface. Under illumination at open circuit, ionized donor states in the semiconductor are compensated by trapped electrons. Therefore, the contribution of ionized donor states to the electric field across the dye layer can be neglected. For NP-TiO2 and I-el, the Stark shift is also visible as a red shift in the IPCE spectra (Fig. S2b, ESI) and contributes to higher jsc by spectrally broader light absorption. The Stark effect is not observed in the ED-ZnO-based DSSCs with I-el due to the aforementioned interaction of the dye with Li+.
EIS and IMPS measurements were performed at different background light intensities while the DSSCs were kept under short-circuit (IMPS) or open-circuit (EIS) conditions. EIS data were fitted as mentioned above and the transit time τtr was obtained according to established models as the product of the transport resistance Rtr and the semiconductor capacitance Cse. We note that Rtr could not be reliably obtained from EIS for conditions under which the transport rate was significantly faster than the recombination rate. This leads to missing data points in Fig. 2, most prominently for the combination of ED-ZnO and I-el. Independent values for τtr were obtained by IMPS from the frequency at the minimum of the imaginary part of the transfer function after correcting by the device collection efficiency. As reported before,Li+ in the I-el electrolytes leads to a change in semiconductor trap distribution in the bandgap most prominently observed for NP-TiO2. This can be concluded from a smaller slope of Cμvs. Voc (Fig. 1a and c). These deeper traps on the one hand can promote electron injection from the dye to NP-TiO2 leading to an increase in total IPCE and jsc. On the other hand, this change in trap distribution leads to an increase in τtr as observed both from EIS and IMPS measurements (Fig. 2b) by reducing the effective diffusion coefficient due to more trapping–detrapping events along a given path. Interestingly, such an increase in τtr is not observed for ED-ZnO-based DSSCs (Fig. 2a).
When adding Li+ ions to Co-el and comparing with the respective pure electrolyte, the changes in ΔEcb (Fig. 1a, c and e), ΔVrecoc (Fig. 1b, d and f), ΔEabs (Fig. 3) and τtr (Fig. 2) are found to be consistent with the observations made for I-el. For Co-el, the Stark effect can also be observed in the ED-ZnO-based DSSCs (Fig. S5, ESI) since there is no specific interaction of this redox electrolyte with DN216. However, some peculiar observations are made when comparing the pure Co-el cells with the pure I-el cells. At first, we notice that the Ecb in the Co-el cells is significantly downward shifted. Since also a significant Stark shift of the dye absorption is observed, we conclude that Co2+ or Co3+ with or, most likely, without their coordinating ligands adsorb onto the semiconductor surface and act in a similar manner to Li+. No shift in Ecb was observed in contact with pure I-el, as explicitly shown by a constant Cμ of ED-ZnO in these cells compared to ED-ZnO in water at pH 7 (Fig. 1a). The pure Co-el cells, further, show much faster recombination than their I-el counterparts which is generally observed for reversible redox couples because of their higher density of unoccupied states close to Ecb. Both the downward shift of Ecb and the higher recombination losses lead to Voc in the pure Co-el cells which is similar to the Voc in the I-el cells although a gain of around 500 mV would be expected in view of the more positive redox potential. Interestingly, τtr in NP-TiO2 with pure electrolyte is vastly reduced when switching from I-el to Co-el (Fig. 2b). Aside from the adsorption reaction discussed above, cobalt ions seem to intercalate into the NP-TiO2 lattice and induce ambipolar charge transport, as has already been observed for other cations in NP-TiO2.
The observed shifts of Ecb (Fig. 1e) and Rrec (Fig. 1f) show similar characteristics for the NP-TiO2-based and the ED-ZnO-based DSSCs, except for the combination of I-el on ED-ZnO-based DSSCs where Li+ interacts with the sensitizer as discussed above. In contrast to the observations made for NP-ZnO electrodes, an influence of cations in the electrolyte on ED-ZnO electrodes can be clearly stated. Thus, we conclude that the lower permittivity of ZnO does not exclude the stabilization of the electronic levels in ZnO by cations. Differences in the preparation conditions of ZnO may influence the number of binding sites for specifically adsorbed cations. Different observations for ED-ZnO and NP-ZnO may be caused by a significantly lower effective particle size in ED-ZnO (<10 nm)vs. that of NP-ZnO (40–100 nm) relative to the Debye-length of doped ZnO (about 4 nm), which should completely rule out the contributions of space charge in the present experiments. However, the effect of the addition of cations is generally stronger on NP-TiO2 than on ED-ZnO. This also results in a stronger decrease in Voc when cations are added to the electrolyte in NP-TiO2-based DSSCs (Table 2). The observation that cations slow down recombination in DSSCs based on NP-TiO2 more strongly than in cells based on ED-ZnO indicates a higher concentration of adsorbed cations at NP-TiO2. In conclusion, shifts of Ecb and surface passivation by cations are more effective on NP-TiO2 electrodes. These observations as a consequence of cation adsorption are illustrated in the second line of Scheme 2.
It is further interesting to note that cations induce changes in τtr in NP-TiO2, either by intercalation or changes in the trap distribution (Fig. 2b). On the other hand, τtr in ED-ZnO is shorter in average by one order of magnitude compared to NP-TiO2 and unaffected by adding any cations to the electrolyte (Fig. 2a). This correlates well with the findings in the literature, where charge transport in NP-ZnO was generally faster than in NP-TiO2. Moreover, ED-ZnO has been demonstrated to yield even faster transport than NP-ZnO because of the lack of grain boundaries. Interestingly, due to the ambipolar nature of charge transport in NP-TiO2 for the pure Co-el electrolyte caused by intercalated cobalt ions, the collection efficiencies for NP-TiO2 (Fig. S4b, ESI) and ED-ZnO (Fig. S4a, ESI) are almost identical leading to comparable values for IPCE and jsc. Since τtr in NP-TiO2 is increased upon addition of Li+ to the electrolyte, the collection efficiency does not increase despite increased Rrec. Since ED-ZnO still provides fast transport in this case, the IPCE and jsc of the ED-ZnO-based DSSCs significantly improved. It is also important to note that the electron injection or dye regeneration in ED-ZnO-based devices seems to be much more efficient. In I-el, remarkable values for IPCE ≈ 90% in the maximum of absorption were observed for ED-ZnO (Fig. S2a, ESI) compared to ≈80% for NP-TiO2 (Fig. S2b, ESI) at identical light harvesting efficiency (<1% of light transmitted in the absorption maximum).

E
abs of the sensitized semiconductor electrodes in contact with pure I-el is red-shifted compared to the as-sensitized electrode without electrolyte (Fig. 3b and Fig. S5b, ESI). If this is also interpreted as a Stark shift, it would indicate that the PMI+ cations of pure I-el also reside close to the semiconductor surface, although being too large to affect Ecb (Fig. 1a). Their presence could sterically hinder the approach of the oxidized redox species and attenuate recombination rates. A better passivation against the recombination reaction by PMI+ would be an explanation for an increased Voc by around 50 mV observed in NP-TiO2 cells with pure I-el compared to ED-ZnO. However, such a difference would also be explained easily by other factors, e.g. by a respective offset of the conduction band between both materials.

Adding alkaline TBP to pure I-el has no clear effect on Ecb for NP-TiO2 or ED-ZnO, as indicated by a similar Cμ (Fig. 1a, c and e). TBP is known to control the concentration of surface-adsorbed cations. However, since pure I-el does not contain small cations that can adsorb, TBP does not show any effect on Ecb. Adding TBP to pure Co-el or the Li+-containing electrolytes, on the other hand, leads to a recovery of the downward shifted Ecb. A higher Rrec in all cases (Fig. 1b, d and f) indicates attenuation of recombination as another beneficial effect of TBP. Multiple reasons for this effect have already been proposed in the literature: (i) TBP adsorbs onto the semiconductor surface and sterically hinders the approach of the oxidized redox species, (ii) TBP passivates surface trap states in the semiconductor and (iii) TBP molecules form bulky complexes with the oxidized redox species. Overall, both the desorption of surface-adsorbed cations and the attenuation of the recombination reaction result in an increase in Voc of the DSSCs.

A blue shift of Eabs is observed in the absorption spectra when TBP is added to either the pure or the Li+-containing electrolytes (Fig. 3a and b, Fig. S5a and b, ESI). The reason for this observation lies in the release of cations, such as Li+, Co3+/2+ or PMI+, that led to a red shift caused by the Stark effect. Consequently, the release of ions causes a full recovery of the original spectrum. This blue shift (compared to electrolytes with cationic additives) is also evident in the respective IPCE spectra and, therefore, partially explains the lower jsc that is observed for TBP-containing electrolytes.
It is, further, observed that the addition of TBP to the electrolytes leads to increased τtr for the NP-TiO2 cells (Fig. 2b). Charge transport is slowed down presumable by changes in the trap distribution in NP-TiO2 as indicated by changes in the slope of Cμ upon addition of TBP to the electrolytes (Fig. 1c) and because of the release of intercalated cations. This results in a widely constant collection efficiency (Fig. S4b, ESI) although recombination is attenuated by TBP. In contrast, τtr is not increased by TBP for the ED-ZnO-based cells (Fig. 2a) which, in combination with the increase in Rrec, leads to an increase in collection efficiency (Fig. S4a, ESI), as explicitly determined when TBP is added to both pure Co-el or Li+-containing Co-el. Therefore, an increase in absolute IPCE and jsc is observed in this case. The collection efficiency for cells based on ED-ZnO in pure I-el or Li+-containing I-el already reached unity and, therefore, could not be increased by addition of TBP.
When comparing the effect of the addition of TBP to the electrolyte in NP-TiO2 and ED-ZnO cells, we find identical trends in terms of their shifts of Ecb (Fig. 1e) and Rrec (Fig. 1f) but more pronounced for NP-TiO2, similar to the effects of cations. As in the case of adsorbed cations, these results are in contrast to NP-ZnO for which no shift was reported. We, therefore, propose that the differences between TiO2 and ZnO in terms of their interaction with TBP are explained by the differences in surface chemistry rather than solely by different dielectric characteristics. The interaction of TBP with specifically adsorbed cations and the semiconductor surfaces is illustrated in the bottom part of Scheme 2. It is known that the surface of ZnO represents a stronger base than TiO2 as evidenced by an isoelectric point (IEP) of 9 for ZnO and 6 for TiO2. Thus, TBP would be less effective in desorbing cations and also less prone to adsorb at ZnO. Consequently, a large uncompensated downward shift of Ecb and less effective attenuation of recombination are observed, leading to a smaller increase of Voc upon addition of TBP. By use of the stronger base 2,2′-bipyridine as an electrolyte additive, a more complete recovery of ΔEcb was observed. However, 2,2′-bipyridine was not as effective in passivating the recombination reaction since bulky substituents are missing.
Since ED-ZnO shows much faster charge transport than NP-TiO2 even when additives are added to the electrolyte, high collection efficiencies are presently measured even with the [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ redox mediator, and, as a result, higher conversion efficiencies are achieved.

SECM experiments were recorded in the feedback mode with different concentrations of the oxidized mediators. The set of approach curves (Fig. S6, ESI) was fitted with a model for irreversible finite kinetics to obtain the effective rate constant keff. The oxidation rate constant kox of I− or [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ at illuminated dye-sensitized films of ED-ZnO was estimated from the fitting of keffvs. c* (Fig. 4) and optimized by the linear fitting of keff−1vs. c* Jhv−1, according to previous literature. A high kox stands for fast oxidation of the electrolyte, i.e., fast dye regeneration. One can clearly see that dye regeneration occurs more slowly in the case of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ compared to I3−/I− caused by the much more positive formal redox potential of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+. The overpotential for regeneration of DN216 of around 0.3 V is lower than 0.4 V which was reported to be necessary to achieve sufficiently fast dye regeneration by cobalt complexes. An overpotential of about 0.5 V is needed for dye regeneration by I3−/I−. The overpotential of 0.8 V in the present experiments causes faster regeneration by I− than by [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+.

The kox of 532 mol−1 cm s−1 for the regeneration of DN216 by [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+ is approximately fivefold slower than the kox found in a comparable experiment for the regeneration of D35 by [Co(bpy)3]2+. Nonetheless, a fivefold slower regeneration of D35 by different cobalt complexes was previously reported to be sufficient for regeneration efficiencies of about 80%. Accordingly, the regeneration of DN216 by [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ in the present work was sufficiently fast to achieve IPCE ≈ 80% (including reflective losses) for the ED-ZnO-based DSSCs with Co-el, Li+ and TBP (Fig. S2a, ESI). This value lower than IPCE ≈ 90% for I-el is caused by the smaller kox since the cell shows almost 100% collection efficiency (Fig. S4a, ESI).
Since the pore size of the ED-ZnO films is similar to the size of metal bipyridine complexes, a significant attenuation of mass transport inside the ED-ZnO films can occur leading to an asymmetric mass transport in the cells and the broadening of the frequency-dependent impedance (Fig. S1b and c, ESI). Transport is attenuated by a lower saturation concentration and a lower bulk diffusion coefficient of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ compared to iodide salts. The diffusion coefficients in the electrolyte were determined by microelectrode cyclic voltammetry as D = 2.07 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for I3− compared to D = 0.72 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+. In DSSCs with I-el, the diffusion part of the impedance (Warburg) is very small and superimposed to other impedance elements and, therefore, does not contribute significantly. However, this contribution to the impedance is relevant for cells with Co-el and can be reliably determined (Fig. S1b and c, ESI). EIS data of full DSSCs were fitted according to the model described in the ESI for mass transport in porous electrodes.
The fitting results for the Warburg impedances are depicted in Table 3, with RW,WE, RW,CE, τW,WE and τW,CE being the diffusion resistances and the characteristic time constants for diffusion at the working or counter electrodes, respectively. A roughly constant RW,CE is found for all additives in both ED-ZnO-based and NP-TiO2-based cells. Since RW,CE is associated with the bulk electrolyte, a constant contribution of diffusion in the bulk is indicated for all cells. RW,WE, which is associated with mass transport of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+ at the porous electrodes, however, increases upon adding Li+ and/or TBP, in particular for ED-ZnO. This implies that additives significantly attenuate the diffusion of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+ in the pores of ED-ZnO. Li+ and TBP specifically adsorb, reside in the porous network and, thus, sterically hinder the diffusion of [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+. TBP also increases the viscosity of the electrolyte solution which results in an overall lower diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, TBP can also form more bulkier complexes by ligand exchange resulting in a lower diffusion coefficient. These processes result in a higher RW,WE and, therefore, a higher total series resistance and a lower FF in the ED-ZnO cells with Co-el, Li+ and TBP (Table 2). Adding too much TBP can even result in a limitation of the photocurrent by mass transport. The requirements for the mass transport become less important at lower illumination intensity and the cell efficiency improves, most notably because of an increase in FF and jsc (Fig. S2e and f, ESI).

The present study of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on NP-TiO2 or ED-ZnO photoanodes with different electrolyte components such as redox couples (I3−/I−, [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+) and additives (pure, Li+, TBP, Li+ and TBP) revealed fundamental differences in the characteristics of the two photoanode materials:

(I) NP-TiO2 allows a higher concentration of cations (Li+ and Co3+/2+) at the surface than ED-ZnO.
(II) Specific adsorption of TBP and the modulation of surface charge by TBP are more effective on NP-TiO2 than on ED-ZnO.
(III) ED-ZnO photoanodes do not require bulky dye molecules to achieve efficient charge separation in combination with Co3+/2+-based redox couples.
(IV) The larger pores in NP-TiO2 allow for a fast diffusion of metal complexes while the narrow pores in ED-ZnO significantly slow down diffusion.
The revealed influence of surface modifications on reaction kinetics is of interest for the optimization of DSSCs but can also be relevant in other fields, such as, e.g. (photo)catalytic reactions. In the literature, DSSCs based on ZnO have been reported with typically lower efficiency than those based on TiO2. This study shows that the crucial impact of the electrolyte composition on DSSC performance diverges between NP-TiO2 and ED-ZnO and, therefore, different strategies are necessary to realize high efficiency DSSCs with ZnO. Based on the present results, it is needed to (i) use stronger bases as additives which might better compensate the downward shifted conduction band of ZnO and more effectively passivate its surface against recombination and (ii) widen the pores in ED-ZnO films to enable faster diffusion of redox mediators.
