Super flexible TCO-free FAPbI3−xBrx planar type inverted perovskite solar cells with a 17.9% power conversion efficiency under 1 sun conditions were demonstrated by introducing an APTES (3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane) adhesion promoter between a PET flexible substrate and a AuCl3-doped single-layer graphene transparent electrode (TCE). Due to the formation of covalent bonds by the APTES inter-layer, the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET substrate had excellent flexibility, whereas the AuCl3-GR/PET substrate and the ITO/PET substrate had significant degradation of the sheet resistance after a bending test due to the break-off or delamination of AuCl3-GR from the PET substrate and the cracking of ITO. Accordingly, the perovskite solar cells constructed on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate exhibited excellent bending stability and they maintained their PCE at over 90% of the initial value after 100 bending cycles at R ≥ 4 mm.

As our societies are developing, the demands on light weight, flexible, foldable, stretchable, wearable and portable power generation systems for smart phones, tablets, laptop PCs and wearable PCs are continuously growing to date. From these aspects, perovskite solar cells can be considered as a promising candidate for future power generation systems because they have a high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low temperature solution processability (<150 °C), excellent flexibility and are light weight. In order to develop highly flexible, high-performance perovskite solar cells the development of a highly flexible transparent conductive electrode (TCE) with a low sheet resistance and high transmittance is a pre-requisite because the flexible TCE is the first layer the light passes through before reaching the perovskite active layer and is the main substrate that determines the mechanical stability of the solar cell. So far, glass based ITO (indium tin oxide) and FTO (F doped tin oxide) TCEs have been used for high-performance perovskite solar cells but they cannot be used for flexible perovskite solar cells. Therefore, plastic based ITO TCEs such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) or colorless polyimide (CPI) based ITO TCEs were adapted for flexible perovskite solar cells. However, the mechanical stability of the perovskite solar cells was limited by the cracking of the inherently brittle ITO TCE. Accordingly, a lot of studies have been done to develop more flexible TCEs using materials such as carbon-based materials (carbon nanotubes and graphene), conducting polymers, metal-based materials (nanowires, grids and networks) and oxide–metal–oxide layers. Among them, graphene (GR) seems an ideal TCE material for solar cells because it has high transmittance, low resistivity, super flexibility and excellent chemical stability. However, practically it is very difficult to form perfect (defect-free) single-layer GR on Cu or Ni foil so that the pristine GR TCE’s sheet resistance is higher than that of ITO TCE. In addition, the single-layer GR formed on the Cu or Ni foil is physically transferred onto certain substrates by the floating and transferring method. Thus there is no chemical bonding between the single-layer GR and the substrate. It is expected that the performance of GR TCEs will deteriorate due to delamination caused by severe mechanical deformation such as repeated bending. Accordingly, the above issues should be solved to allow the application of single-layer GR for the TCE for highly-flexible perovskite solar cells. To reduce the sheet resistance of GR, chemical doping has been widely recognized as one of the most effective methods because the doped chemical species can decrease the sheet resistance and can also modify the work function of GR.

Recently, Sung et al. reduced the sheet resistance of a pristine single-layer GR TCE on a glass substrate to ∼500 Ω cm−2 by MoO3 modification and thereby attained a 17.1% PCE. Very recently, they reported a 16.8% PCE for flexible perovskite solar cells fabricated by switching the glass substrate to a PEN substrate, which is still a poorer PCE than that of the ITO/PEN based device (17.3%). Another approach using chemical doping is controlling the Fermi level and conductivity of GR TCEs by p-type chemical doping with AuCl3 (gold chloride) under ambient conditions and we attained a 17.9% PCE using AuCl3 doped single-layer GR (AuCl3-GR) on a rigid glass substrate. To reduce the sheet resistance and improve the adhesion of the single-layer GR TCE, here we doped the single-layer GR with AuCl3 and introduced chemical bonding between the single-layer GR and the PET substrate with a 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) inter-layer. Through chemical doping and introduction of an APTES inter-layer, the sheet resistance of the single-layer GR TCE on a PET substrate was reduced to ∼80 Ω cm−2. In addition, we fabricated the highly flexible CH(NH2)2PbI3−xBrx (FAPbI3−xBrx) and used it instead of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) to widen the range of absorption wavelengths. Therefore, we improved the PCE of flexible FAPbI3−xBrx solar cells to 17.4% and 17.9% for the forward and reverse scan condition, respectively.

Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic device structure of a p–i–n type planar MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell composed of an APTES treated PET substrate/AuCl3-GR TCE (or ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)) HTL (hole transporting layer)/MAPbI3/PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) ETL (electron transporting layer)/Al top electrode. For the APTES treatment, we dropped 0.1 mL of 1 wt% APTES in methanol on the Ar/O2 plasma treated PET substrate and spin-coated it at 3000 rpm for 60 s. We then dried it at room temperature to remove residual solvent. The silanol groups can make covalent bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the plasma treated PET substrate by condensation reaction. The single-layer GR grown on the Cu foil by CVD was then transferred onto the APTES treated PET substrate via the conventional floating and transferring method. It is well known that epoxy groups are often formed on the CVD-GR sheet as defects and the epoxy rings make covalent bonds with amine groups by an epoxy-amine addition reaction. Therefore, it is expected that strong chemical bonds will be formed between the plasma treated PET substrate and the single-layer GR TCE as depicted in Fig. 1(b). To confirm the formation of chemical bonds between APTES and the single-layer GR sheet we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra as shown in Fig. 1(c and d). For this model experiment, we used the SiO2/Si substrate instead of the PET substrate because the C 1s peak of GR is overlapped by those of the PET substrate. Fig. 1(c and d) show the XPS spectra corresponding to the C 1s and N 1s core levels, respectively, for GR before and after APTES treatment. There are four or five components in the C 1s spectrum of the GR. The main peak at 284.8 eV corresponds to the graphite-like C–C bond, indicating that most of the C atoms in the GR are arranged in a conjugated honeycomb lattice. The small peaks at 285.8, 286.2, 287.1 and 289.0 eV indicate the bonding structures of the C–N, C–O, CO and C–CO bonds, respectively. Evidently, the C–N related peak in the C 1s spectrum was observed only in the APTES treated sample. These results suggest that the C–N peak would originate from substitution of the N atoms. Furthermore, in the GR without APTES treatment the N 1s peak is absent, while in the GR with APTES treatment one component of the N 1s peak is clearly resolved in the spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The weak peak at 401.0 eV corresponds to a C–N–H peak, which is attributed to the N atoms that are located in a π conjugated system and contribute to the π system with two p-electrons. To clarify the analysis of bonding between GR and APTES we used Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In the case of GR, there was a difficulty in the FTIR measurement because it was too thin. Therefore, the experiment was conducted using graphite in place of the GR material. Fig. 1(e) shows the FTIR spectra of APTES, graphite and graphite/APTES. For the graphite, the strong peak at 3415 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretch vibration of –OH on the surface of the graphite. The absorption peaks at 1630 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretch vibration of CC in the graphite. In the APTES spectrum, the bending vibrations of Si–O–Si, –NH2 and CH2 can be detected at 1070 cm−1, 3360 cm−1 and 2938 cm−1. In the combined FTIR spectrum of the two materials, the same peaks related to Si–O–Si, CC, CH2 and –OH observed in APTES and graphite were observed as shown in Fig. 1(e). Additionally, the bending vibration of C–N–H can be detected at 1550 cm−1. These results demonstrate the successful combination of graphite and APTES. Therefore, we believe that single GR and APTES materials are well formed.
To check whether the AuCl3 chemical doped GR is suitable for a TCE, it is necessary to analyze the sheet resistance (Rs), the carrier concentration (n) and the electron mobility (μ), and to compare these with those of an ITO TCE. The measured values are summarized in Table 1. The Rs of the AuCl3-GR/PET TCE and the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE was 78/85 (Hall measurement/4 probe van der Pauw method) and 75/80 Ω cm−2, respectively. It should be noted that the sheet resistance of the 7.5 mM AuCl3 doped GR TCE is greatly reduced compared to that of the MoO3 modified GR TCE (Rs = ∼500 Ω cm−2). The n and μ of the AuCl3-GR/PET TCE and the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE were 6.3 × 1018 cm−3 and 492 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.6 × 1019 cm−3 and 500 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. On the other hand, the ITO/PET TCE had Rs = 8.5/9.8 (Hall measurement/4 probe van der Pauw method) Ω cm−2, n = 7.8 × 1019 cm−3 and μ = 30 cm2 V−1 s−1. It can be seen that AuCl3-GR and AuCl3-GR/APTES have better μ than ITO, whereas their sheet resistance is higher. This is because the sheet resistance is the resistivity/sample thickness and the thickness of the single-layer GR is 0.34 nm which is much thinner than the 150 nm ITO. However, the Rs of GR was significantly reduced by AuCl3 doping. These results indicate that AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET are suitable for the TCE of flexible perovskite solar cells due to the reduced sheet resistance by chemical doping.

To check if the mechanical stability of the single-layer AuCl3-GR/PET TCE can be improved by introduction of the APTES inter-layer, we compared the mechanical stability of ITO/PET, AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCEs using the repeated bending test and the bending radius of curvature as shown in Fig. 2. We conducted the bending tests of the flexible electrodes at a 0.5 Hz bending frequency at room temperature in the outer bending condition.
We evaluated the variation of Rs of the above three TCEs with respect to the bending radius of curvature (R) (R = 12, 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2 mm, respectively) (Fig. 2(a)) and the 100 times repeated bending test (Fig. 2(b)). The initial Rs values of the ITO/PET, AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCEs were 9.5–10.3, 78–95 and 75–85 Ω cm−2, respectively. Apparently, the Rs values of the three TCEs seem to be maintained under a small bending deformation (R = 12 mm) but the Rs values gradually deteriorated under large deformations (R = 10 to 2 mm) in the ITO/PET and AuCl3-GR/PET TCEs, possibly due to cracking of the ITO TCE and damage of the AuCl3-GR TCE, whereas the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE did not show a significant degradation of the Rs under large deformation. It is well known that the brittle ITO/PET TCE shows cracks after bending because the cracks are initiated at defects or impurities in ITO and are propagated more across the whole surface due to the increased strain as the bending radius of curvature is increased. In contrast, the Rs of the AuCl3-GR/PET TCE is expected to be maintained after bending with respect to the bending radius of curvature and repeated bending test due to its excellent flexibility, however, the Rs was significantly increased after the bending test, which is consistent with the previous reported literature. This might be associated with the fact that the adhesion between the GR and the PET substrate is not perfect so that delamination will occur or some spaces will be formed at the GR/PET interface under deformation. As expected, the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE did not show significant degradation of the Rs with respect to the bending radius of curvature and the repeated bending test due to the promoted adhesion at the GR/PET interface by the APTES inter-layer due to covalent chemical bonding. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) surface images of the AuCl3-GR/PET (Fig. 2(c and d)) and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET (Fig. 2(e and f)) TCEs before and after the 100 times repeated bending test with a curvature radius of 4 mm indicate that the pristine AuCl3-GR sheet was toned by the mechanical deformation, whereas the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE was not. Therefore, we could fabricate a highly flexible TCE substrate for flexible perovskite solar cells using AuCl3 doped GR and by introducing an APTES inter-layer.
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties and mechanical stability of flexible FAPbI3−xBrx or MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with respect to flexible TCE substrates such as ITO/PET, AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET, we fabricated planar type perovskite solar cells as shown in Fig. 3. The bent image and the SEM cross-sectional image of a flexible MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell constructed on a AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate are shown in Fig. 3(a). The SEM cross-sectional image indicates that the p–i–n type planar MAPbI3 flexible perovskite solar cell was fabricated by depositing ∼40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS, ∼400 nm MAPbI3, ∼50 nm PCBM and ∼60 nm Al on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate. The other devices also had similar thicknesses of each layer with the exception of the TCE substrate. The energy band diagram of the perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig. 3(b). Under illumination by light, free charge carriers or loosely bonded excitons are generated in the MAPbI3 layer due to its small exciton binding energy. The holes and electrons are then transferred/transported into the PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer and the PCBM electron transporting layer, respectively.
The photovoltaic properties of flexible FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 solar cells based on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate are shown in Fig. 3(c and d) (see Fig. S1 for the flexible MAPbI3 solar cell with the (a) AuCl3-GR and (c) ITO TCEs). The photovoltaic properties of each device are summarized in Table 2. The J–V (current density–voltage) curves in Fig. 3(c) show that the best efficiency of the FAPbI3−xBrx solar cell with the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET substrate had a 1.08 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), a 21.2 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density (Jsc), a 76.2% fill factor (FF) and a 17.4% PCE for the forward scan and a 1.08 V Voc, a 21.2 mA cm−2Jsc, a 78.1% FF and a 17.9% PCE for the reverse scan condition, whereas the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE-based MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell exhibited a 1.10 V Voc, an 18.7 mA cm−2Jsc, a 75.7% FF and a 15.6% PCE for the forward scan and a 1.10 V Voc, an 18.8 mA cm−2Jsc, a 77.9% FF and a 16.1% PCE for the reverse scan condition. In addition, the AuCl3-GR (or ITO) TCE-based MAPbI3 device showed a 15.5% (15.5%) PCE for the forward scan and a 16.0% (15.8%) PCE for the reverse scan condition, as shown in Table 2. The statistical deviations of the average PCE for 24 samples of p–i–n perovskite flexible solar cells based on FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 with AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET, AuCl3-GR/PET and ITO/PET TCE substrates were 15.58 ± 1.32%, 13.87 ± 1.26%, 13.77 ± 1.18% and 13.63 ± 1.22%, respectively (see Fig. S2).

Fig. 3(e and f) show the transmittance spectra of the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 perovskite flexible solar cells, respectively. The AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrates have better transmittance than the ITO/PET TCE substrate in the visible region and consequently the AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE based devices exhibit a better EQE than the ITO/PET TCE based one. Accordingly, it is expected that the Jsc of the AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE based devices will be higher than that of the ITO/PET based device because the EQE is the product of the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), the exciton diffusion efficiency (ηed ≈ 1, because free charge carriers or loosely bonded excitons are generated in MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells), the charge injection/transfer efficiency (ηinj) and the charge collection efficiency (ηcc). The calculated Jsc values from the integration of the EQE spectra are 20.65 and 18.65 mA cm−2 for the FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 flexible solar cells constructed on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE, respectively. The MAPbI3 solar cells constructed on the AuCl3-GR and ITO TCEs have calculated Jsc values of 18.51 and 18.09 mA cm−2, respectively. Here it should be noted that a comparable PCE with the conventional ITO/PET TCE substrate based flexible perovskite solar cells can be achieved by using the AuCl3-GR/PET and AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrates. This implies that the AuCl3 chemical doping on the single-layer GR sheet is a very promising technique to demonstrate highly flexible and efficient perovskite solar cells.
Finally, the mechanical stabilities of the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET, AuCl3-GR/PET and ITO/PET TCE based flexible perovskite solar cells were investigated with respect to the bending radius of curvature (Fig. 3(g)) and the repeated bending test (Fig. 3(h)). We conducted a bending test of the flexible solar cells at a 0.5 Hz bending frequency at room temperature in the outer bending condition. The inner and outer bending results are shown in Fig. S3. The bending test was performed in the same manner as the bending test for the three TCEs as shown in Fig. 2. The degradation of the PCE with respect to the bending radius of curvature and the repeated bending test was consistent with the degradation of the Rs values in the three different TCEs. When the ITO/PET TCE based perovskite solar cells were bent 100 times at R = 12, 8 and 4 mm, the PCEs deteriorated to 9, 21 and 30%, respectively, compared to their initial value. This indicates that the ITO/PET TCE substrate is not adequate for highly flexible perovskite solar cells. The AuCl3-GR/PET TCE substrate based flexible perovskite solar cells had better mechanical stability than the ITO/PET TCE based ones but they also exhibited significant degradation of the PCEs with respect to the bending radius of curvature and the repeated bending test. On the other hand, both the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate based flexible FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 solar cells did not show significant degradation of PCE with respect to the bending radius of curvature and maintained their initial PCEs after the 100 times repeated bending test under the R ≥ 4 mm condition. Both flexible FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 solar cells constructed on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate had a less than 25% efficiency degradation compared to their initial efficiency after the 1000 times repeated bending test under the R ≥ 4 mm condition as shown in Fig. S4. These results clearly confirm that the introduction of the APTES inter-layer between the PET substrate and the AuCl3-GR TCE can significantly improve the mechanical stability. In addition, the light stabilities of the flexible inverted perovskite solar cells were compared as shown in Fig. S5. Similarly to our previous report, the unencapsulated flexible inverted perovskite solar cells maintained their performance under a continuous light soaking of 1 sun at 50% relative humidity for 100 h because the adhesion at the PET/graphene interface is promoted by the introduction of the APTES interlayer.

We successfully fabricated highly efficient flexible FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells by the introduction of an APTES interlayer between AuCl3-GR and the PET substrate due to the formation of covalent bonds. Therefore, the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET substrate exhibited a high flexibility, whereas the AuCl3-GR/PET substrate and the ITO/PET substrate showed significant degradation of the sheet resistance during bending tests due to the break-off or delamination of AuCl3-GR from the PET substrate and the cracking of ITO. Similarly, the perovskite solar cells constructed on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate exhibited excellent bending stability, maintaining a PCE of over 90% of the initial PCE after 100 bending cycles at R ≥ 4 mm. In addition, the flexible FAPbI3−xBrx and MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells constructed on the AuCl3-GR/APTES/PET TCE substrate exhibited the highest PCEs of 17.9 and 16.1%, respectively, under 1 sun conditions.
