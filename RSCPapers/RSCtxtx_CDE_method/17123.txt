A low bandgap conjugated polymer, i.e., poly[2,2′-bithiophene-alt-7-fluoro-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)isoindigo] (P(1FIID-BT)), was synthesized. The polymer was soluble in non-chlorinated solvents such as o-xylene and mesitylene, and exhibited a film optical bandgap of 1.61 eV as calculated from the absorption onset and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.46 eV as measured by an electrochemical method. Remarkably high mobilities of 0.33 and 0.42 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on pristine and annealed films, respectively. Inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor material and o-xylene as the processing solvent. The device efficiency was insensitive to the thickness of the active layer, and all devices with film thickness in the range of 105–340 nm showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 6.5%. The devices based on 270 nm thick films displayed the highest performance with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 14.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.58, leading to a PCE of 7.46%. This is the first low bandgap conjugated polymer for PSCs which combine three features: non-chlorinated solvent processability, high efficiency and insensitivity of efficiency to the active layer thickness.

In recent years, tremendous efforts have been focused on developing low bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers for high efficiency polymer solar cells (PSCs). In the past several years, a number of D–A conjugated polymers with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 8% have been reported, and the highest PCE of single-junction PSCs has surpassed 10%. However, most of the PSCs with a PCE above 8% were fabricated with chlorinated solvents, despite these solvents being harmful for human beings and the environment. On the other hand, a high PCE with a thick active layer is highly desirable when large-scale, high throughput and roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing processes are considered as future commercialization technology of PSCs. Thereby, it is crucial to develop novel high performance polymers which can be processed with environmentally benign solvents and meanwhile exhibit a high PCE even with a thick active layer.

In the past several years, extensive studies have been devoted to discovering solutions to supersede the halogenated solvents. Of those, few were focused on improving the solubility of conjugated polymers via molecular design. In general, three ways can be employed to increase the solubility of conjugated polymers. Foremost, the introduction of bulky side chains to the conjugated backbone can decrease the interaction between the macromolecules or increase the interaction between the polymer and the solvent, and then enhance the solubility of the polymer. For instance, Jen et al. demonstrated PSCs with a PCE up to 7.15% using a ladder-type conjugated polymer, in which aryl solubilizing groups were introduced via sp3-hybrized carbon-bridges, as the donor material and o-xylene/1,2-dimethylnaphthalene as the solvent. Secondly, using polar side chains instead of alkyls can endow polymers with good solubility in solvents with moderate or high polarity. Hou et al. synthesized a PTB7 analogue with triethylene glycol monoether side chains, and found it to be soluble in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), allowing the fabrication of PSCs with this solvent. A diketopyrrolopyrrole-based conjugated polymer carrying similar side chains is also soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Thirdly, the strong aggregation tendency of conjugated polymers could be suppressed by reducing regioregularity, resulting in an increase of solubility. For example, Zhu et al. have shown that decreasing regioregularity, to some extent, may give polythiophene derivatives good solubility in o-xylene without deteriorating their organic field-effect transistor (OFET) performance. Besides, Kwon et al. demonstrated that an irregular polymer PDPP-BTT(1)-SVS(9), which was obtained through random copolymerization of three co-monomers, can be processed with several environmentally benign solvents including THF, toluene, xylene and tetalin and a field-effect mobility of ca. 5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was realized.
Recently, our group reported dithienocarbazole (DTC) and isoindigo (IID) based D–A low band gap conjugated polymers for preparing PSCs with a PCE up to 8.2%, and found that introducing one fluorine atom in the IID unit could improve the solubility of the polymer in non-chlorinated solvents such as o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethyl-benzene, allowing the fabrication of 7.5% PSCs with o-xylene as the solvent. However, the mobility of this polymer is rather low (field-effect mobility was 10−3 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to its amorphous nature. This weakness may hinder its future applications, particularly while considering a thick active layer is necessary for making large area PSCs via printing techniques. It is known that the alternating copolymers of IID and bithiophene are highly crystalline along with short π–π stacking distances, and thereby exhibit high field-effect mobility (0.3–3.62 cm2 V−1 s−1 depending on chemical structures). Therefore, in the current paper we synthesized a D–A conjugated polymer, i.e., poly[2,2′-bithiophene-alt-7-fluoro-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)isoindigo] (P(1FIID-BT)), comprising alternating mono-fluorinated IID and bithiophene. The polymer is soluble in non-chlorinated solvent o-xylene although it is crystalline. OFETs with a field-effect mobility up to 0.42 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PSCs with a PCE up to 7.46% (with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor) have been fabricated with o-xylene as the processing solvent. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is among the highest for PSCs processed with non-chlorinated solvents. Most importantly, the PCE of the PSCs was not sensitive to the thickness of the active layer. The devices with the thickness in the range of 105–340 nm all displayed a PCE higher than 6.5%. This is the first report on low band gap conjugated polymers for efficient thick PSCs prepared with a non-chlorinated solvent.

The polymer P(1FIID-BT) was synthesized via Stille coupling polycondensation as shown in Scheme 1. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (Đ) of P(1FIID-BT) are 65 kDa and 3.36, respectively, as measured by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. P(1FIID-BT) is not only soluble in commonly used chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (9 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene and 12 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene), but also soluble in non-chlorinated solvents, such as toluene, o-xylene and mesitylene, attributed to the regiorandom distribution of fluorine atoms along the conjugated backbone. At room temperature, the solubility of P(1FIID-BT) is 3 mg mL−1 in toluene, 5 mg mL−1 in o-xylene and 5 mg mL−1 in mesitylene. The solubility of P(1FIID-BT) in o-xylene is enhanced to 10 mg mL−1 at 50 °C. However, its mother polymer, i.e., poly[2,2′-bithiophene-alt-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)isoindigo] (P(IID-BT)) cannot form stable solution in o-xylene (Fig. S1a and Table S1 in the ESI). P(1FIID-BT) is thermally stable with a decomposition temperature beyond 405 °C (5% weight loss) as evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1b). Like PIID-BT, no distinct thermal transitions were observed from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements at a temperature below the decomposition temperature (Fig. S1c).


Fig. 1a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of P(1FIID-BT) in o-xylene solution and the film state. Two absorption bands were observed in the absorption spectra. The weak absorption band at 300–460 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition and the strong one at 460–800 nm is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. From solution to film, a small hypochromatic shift of the spectrum was observed. Compared to the absorption spectra of P(IID-BT) (Fig. S2), about a 15 nm red shift of the ICT band of P(1FIID-BT) was observed in both solution and film states due to the introduction of an F atom in the IID unit. The optical band gap of P(1FIID-BT) as calculated from the film absorption onset is 1.61 eV, slightly lower than that of P(IID-BT) (1.65 eV). This is beneficial for enhancing light absorption in PSC devices. Thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to study the electrochemical properties of P(1FIID-BT). For comparison, CV curves of P(IID-BT) were also measured under the same conditions (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 1b, P(1FIID-BT) displayed irreversible p-doping and n-doping processes. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of P(1FIID-BT) are −5.46 and −3.57 eV, respectively, as calculated from the equations HOMO = −(4.80 + EOXonset) eV and LUMO = −(4.80 + Ereonset) eV, in which EOXonset and Ereonset are oxidation and reduction onsets of P(1FIID-BT) versus Fc/Fc+, respectively (Table S2). Both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P(1FIID-BT) are slightly lower than those of P(IID-BT) (−5.44 and −3.52 eV, respectively), owing to the introduction of the electron-withdrawing F atom in the IID unit.

To investigate the semiconducting properties of P(1FIID-BT), bottom gate and top contact OFETs were fabricated by spin-coating a 5 mg mL−1o-xylene solution of P(1FIID-BT) on a silicon wafer covered with 300 nm silicon dioxide as the dielectric layer. The substrate was modified with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) prior to active layer deposition. Device characteristics were measured under ambient conditions, and the mobility was calculated from the saturation regime. Table S3 summarizes the performance data of the devices based on a pristine film and films annealed at 150 and 200 °C. Fig. 2 shows typical output and transfer curves of OFETs based on the film annealed at 150 °C for 20 min, and those of the devices based on the pristine film are displayed in Fig. S3. Unlike the polymer based on difluorinated-IID that exhibited ambipolar characteristics, P(1FIID-BT) is a p-type polymer and its OFETs featured a unipolar transport behaviour. The devices based on its pristine film exhibited a hole mobility of 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 along with an current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) > 104 and a threshold voltage (VT) of −29.8 V. Upon thermal annealing of the film at 150 °C, the mobility was increased to 0.42 cm2 V−1 s−1 along with an enhanced Ion/Ioff (>105) and a decreased VT (−15.5 V). Enhancing the annealing temperature to 200 °C did not result in further improvement of device performance. For comparison, OFETs of P(IID-BT) were also fabricated with the same device structure but with o-DCB as the processing solvent, and a hole mobility of 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained. This value is comparable with those reported in the literature using a similar device structure.

As aforementioned, the mobility of P(1FIID-BT) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of our previously reported P(IID1F-DTC) based on DTC and mono-fluorinated IID units. We supposed that the higher crystallinity or film order is responsible for the enhanced hole mobility. To verify this point, the film of P(1FIID-BT) was characterized by thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the in-plane XRD patterns (Fig. S4) of the films on Si/SiO2 before and after thermal annealing, a weak (010) peak at 2θ ≈ 24.66°, which corresponds to a d-spacing of ∼3.60 Å and is ascribed to the π–π stacking distance, was observed. In out-of-plane XRD patterns (Fig. S4), the (100) diffraction peak with a d-spacing of 20.92 Å could be observed for the pristine film. After thermal annealing, the (100) diffraction peak (d-spacing of 20.63 Å) became sharper and stronger along with the presence of the (200) diffraction peak. This implies that macromolecules packed in an edge-on arrangement and formed two-dimensional ordered crystalline microstructures, and the thermal annealing could increase the packing order of the conjugated backbones. The film morphology of P(1FIID-BT) was also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S5, the film of P(1FIID-BT) featured a fibre-like morphology. After thermal annealing at 150 °C, larger crystalline domains comprising long fibres with a diameter of 20–30 nm were observed along with an enhancement of root mean square (RMS) roughness (from 1.87 to 2.66 nm). All these observations are consistent with the increased field-effect mobility after thermal annealing.

To study the photovoltaic properties of P(1FIID-BT), conventional PSCs with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, 40 nm)/P(1FIID-BT):PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w, 210 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated with o-xylene as the solvent. PC61BM was used as the acceptor because of its higher solubility in o-xylene. The devices displayed moderate performance with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.56 and a short circuit current density (JSC) of 6.63 mA cm−2, resulting in a PCE of 3.19% (Fig. 3a). The relatively low JSC is attributed to severe phase separation between the polymer and PC61BM. Large domains (100–300 nm) were observed in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the blend film (Fig. 4a). The device performance could be improved by adding octane-1,8-dithiol (ODT) as an additive, and using 2 vol% ODT in o-xylene afforded the best device performance (Fig. S6 and Table S4). Fig. 3a and b show the representative J–V curves and EQE profiles of the devices. After 2 vol% ODT was added, the VOC and FF of the devices were slightly enhanced to 0.89 V and 0.57, respectively. However, the JSC of the devices dramatically increased to 12.41 mA cm−2. As a result, the PCE was enhanced to 6.29%. The enhancement of JSC is ascribed to the improvement of film morphology. As shown in Fig. 4b, upon adding 2 vol% ODT, a fibre-like morphology with domain sizes < 80 nm was observed and preferable inter-penetrating networks were formed. ODT is a good solvent for PC61BM but a poor solvent for P(1FIID-BT), and has a higher boiling point than o-xylene. When it was added, more crystalline nuclei for P(1FIID-BT) might be formed and the crystallization of PC61BM should be retarded, leading to the above optimized film morphology. This promising micro-phase separation can facilitate more efficient exciton dissociation at the D/A interface and also efficient charge transport and collection, leading to improved device performance.

PSCs with inverted structures usually deliver better device performance due to improved contact and efficient charge transfer and collection as well as enhanced light absorption. Besides, inverted devices manifest better long-term ambient stability by eliminating highly acidic PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, inverted PSC devices with MoO3 and ZnO as hole and electron transport layers, respectively, were fabricated. With P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM = 1:1.5 (w/w), the inverted devices exhibited a PCE of 6.92%, ca. 10% increase compared to conventional devices owing to a higher FF (0.64 versus 0.57). In order to improve device performance, the ratio of P(1FIID-BT) and PC61BM was further optimized. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S5, the device performance was not very sensitive to the weight ratio, and the PCE was all higher than 6% when P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM was varied between 1:1.2 and 1:2. The best device performance was observed with P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM = 1:1.8 (w/w), and a PCE of 7.07% along with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 12.36 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.65 was realized. This value is higher than those of PSCs based on P(IID-BT)/PC61BM processed from chloroform. The poorer device performance of P(IID-BT) can be attributed to the low JSC which may have resulted from the inferior morphology of the P(IID-BT)/PC61BM blend film.
We noted that the active layer thickness of the devices was ca. 230 nm, much thicker than the generally optimized thickness (∼100 nm) of PSCs, but a high PCE was still achieved. Therefore, the thickness dependence of the device performance was studied with P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM = 1:1.8 (w/w) and 2 vol% ODT as the additive. Fig. 5a and b reveal the J–V profiles and EQE curves, respectively, of the devices with different film thickness, and the data are outlined in Table 1. When the thickness of the active layer was below 200 nm, the devices exhibited a high FF but a relatively low JSC. For instance, the FF of the devices based on the 130 nm-thick film was as high as 0.69, but the JSC was only 10.87 mA cm−2. Accordingly, a PCE of 6.74% was obtained. Increasing the film thickness to above 230 nm resulted in an obvious enhancement of JSC, but decreased FF (Fig. 5c). For thicker devices, the higher JSC can be attributed to enhanced light-absorption, while the lower FF is probably owing to increased recombination opportunities for free charges since they need to travel a longer distance to be collected at electrodes. The trend of the dependence of JSC on the film thickness is consistent with the previous prediction for some IID-based polymers. Accordingly, the optimized film thickness was observed to be 270 nm in the P(1FIID-BT) system. With this thickness, the devices exhibited a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 14.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.58, and a PCE of 7.46% was achieved. Although the JSC could be further enhanced by increasing the film thickness to 340 nm, the FF was decreased to ca. 0.50, leading to a lower PCE (6.55%). To ascertain the accuracy of the measurement, JSC was also calculated from EQE profiles. PCEs obtained from calculated JSC are very close to directly measured ones with an error of ∼3%. Nevertheless, the PCE (7.46%) is among the highest for PSCs processed with non-chlorinated solvents. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5d, PCEs of the devices were not very sensitive to the thickness of the active layer. All devices with a film thickness in the range of 105–340 nm showed a PCE higher than 6.5%. This phenomenon was also observed for some IID-based polymers. Although several low bandgap conjugated polymers for efficient PSCs with thick active layers have been reported, no non-chlorinated solvent processed thick PSCs have been reported yet. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on low bandgap conjugated polymers for PSCs which combine three features: (1) non-chlorinated solvent processability, (2) high efficiency, and (3) insensitivity of efficiency to the film thickness.

To understand the origin of the above photovoltaic properties of P(1FIID-BT), hole and electron mobilities of the P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM (1:1.8 w/w) film were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The device structures were glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (∼300 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) and glass/PEDOT:PSS/Al (100 nm)/active layer (∼300 nm)/Al (100 nm) for hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively. Fig. S8 shows the J–V curves of the devices in the dark. The mobility calculated according to the Mott–Gurney equationJ = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3 is 6.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons. The hole mobility is higher than that of previously reported P(IID1F-DTC)/PC61BM (3.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Therefore, we attribute the above device properties of P(1FIID-BT) (efficiency is not very sensitive to the film thickness) to high and balanced hole and electron mobilities of the P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM blend film.


Fig. 6 reveals the grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of the P(1FIID-BT) film and the P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM blend film on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. As shown in Fig. 6a, (100) and (200) diffraction peaks at qz = 0.29 and 0.58 Å−1 were observed for the neat film, indicating an edge-on alignment of macromolecules with a lamellar distance of 21.6 Å. However, for the P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM blend film, other than the (100) diffraction peak at qz = 0.30 Å−1 and a d-spacing of 20.9 Å, a (010) peak at qz = 1.70 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.69 Å, was also observed. This indicates that part of macromolecules packed in a face-on fashion in the blend film, which can facilitate efficient hole transport and collection in the PSC device geometry and is beneficial for high hole mobility and thereby good device performance at the thick active layer. Meanwhile, a diffraction arc ascribed to crystalline domains of PC61BM was also observed. Therefore, the P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM blend film displayed relatively high and balanced hole and electron mobility. The above microstructures of the P(1FIID-BT)/PC61BM blend film may be responsible for the good device performance at the thick active layer as mentioned above.

A semi-crystalline low bandgap conjugated polymer P(1FIID-BT), which is soluble in non-chlorinated solvents due to regiorandom distribution of F-atoms along the conjugated backbone, has been designed and synthesized. The polymer exhibited an optical bandgap of 1.61 eV and a HOMO of −5.46 eV. The polymer backbone formed two-dimensional ordered microstructures in films, resulting in remarkably high hole mobility as measured with OFETs, which was 0.33 and 0.42 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices based on pristine and thermally annealed films, respectively. The device performance of inverted PSCs fabricated with P(1FIID-BT) as the donor, PC61BM as the acceptor and o-xylene as the processing solvent was insensitive to the thickness of the active layer. All devices exhibited PCEs higher than 6.5% when the active layer thickness was varied in the range of 105–340 nm. The devices based on the 270 nm thick film displayed the highest performance with a PCE of 7.46%, which is among the highest for PSCs processed with non-chlorinated solvents. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first report on efficient thick PSCs processed with non-chlorinated solvents.


Toluene and acetonitrile were dried and distilled before use. MoO3 and PC61BM were purchased from American Dye Source. Inc. (ADS). Anhydrous o-xylene was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. (E)-6,6′ Dibromo-7-fluoro-1,1′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo, 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene and P(IID-BT) were synthesized according to the literature. Other materials and reagents were purchased and used without further purification.


(E)-6,6′-Dibromo-7-fluoro-1,1′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-isoindigo (490.0 mg, 0.49 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (246.1 mg, 0.50 mmol, 1.02 equiv.), Pd2(dba)3 (9.0 mg, 9.80 μmol, 2 mol%) and P(o-tol)3 (23.9 mg, 78.40 μmol, 16 mol%) were added to a Schlenk tube in a N2-filled glovebox. Then, toluene (50 mL) was added under an argon flow. The resulting mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 48 hours, and then bromobenzene (1.50 g, 9.55 mmol) was added and the reaction was continued for 12 hours for end-capping. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer solution was added to methanol dropwise. The precipitate was collected by filtration and dissolved in o-DCB (20 mL), and then sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihyrate (200 mg) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12 hours to remove catalyst residues. The organic phase was separated and added into ethanol for precipitation. After collection by filtration, the crude polymer was finally purified by Soxhlet extraction with ethanol, acetone and hexane in succession. The remaining solid was dissolved in o-DCB, and then re-precipitated to afford the product as a dark brown solid (488 mg, yield 96%). Found: C, 76.49; H, 9.41; N, 2.79; S, 6.31%. Calcd for C64H91FN2O2S2: C, 76.59; H, 9.16; N, 2.79; S, 6.39%.


The cleaned Si/SiO2 substrates were modified with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) under argon according to the literature. The polymer films were deposited on treated substrates by spin-coating 5 mg mL−1 P(1FIID-DT) solution in o-xylene at 800 rpm for 1 min in a glovebox. The gold source and drain electrodes were deposited under vacuum conditions by using a shadow mask. The channel width (W) and length (L) of the devices were 3000 and 100 μm, respectively. Thermal annealing of the films was done in a glovebox with an annealing time of 20 minutes. All devices were measured with two Keithley 236 source/drain under ambient conditions.


Conventional and inverted PSCs were fabricated with device structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/P(1FIID-BT):PC61BM/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) and glass/ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/P(1FIID-DT):PC61BM/MoO3 (8 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. The fabrication procedure is identical to that in our previous report. The active layer was deposited in a glovebox by spin-casting P(1FIID-DT):PC61BM solution in o-xylene (7 mg mL−1 for the polymer) at 50 °C, and the thickness was tuned by varying the spin-rate. The active area of devices is 12 mm2. J–V curves were measured in a glovebox using a Keithley 236 source meter at the light power 100 mA cm−2, AM 1.5G. EQE curves were recorded on a QE-R3011IPCE measurement system (Enli Technology Co. Ltd).


Hole-only and electron-only devices with the structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) and glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Al (80 nm)/active layer/Al (80 nm), respectively, were fabricated according to a previous report. The devices were measured using a Keithley 236 source meter in the dark under ambient conditions. The mobilities were calculated by fitting the dark current using the Mott–Gurney relationship: J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
