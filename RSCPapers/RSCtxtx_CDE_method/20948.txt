Tandem solar cells (TSCs) are widely recognized as an effective device architecture for overcoming the spectral loss in single-junction solar cells and surpassing the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are an emerging class of materials for use in TSCs as light absorbers as they carry a significant set of intriguing attributes, which include tunable direct bandgaps, large absorption coefficients, high ambipolar carrier mobilities, small exciton biding energies, and solution processability. In this context, the ability to engineer all-perovskite TSCs (all-PTSCs) offers new opportunities to render low-cost, low-temperature solution-processing of photovoltaics with markedly enhanced device performance. Notably, an efficient interconnecting layer (ICL) represents a key component for high-efficiency monolithic tandem devices as it concurrently imparts good electrical, optical, and mechanical interconnections between the subcells. In particular, an interdiffusion barrier is required to ensure the chemical stability of the bottom cell against solvents for solution-processed all-PTSCs. In this review, the triple functions of ICLs noted above and the structural requirements for achieving them, as well as the mechanism that underpins efficient recombination in ICLs, are first discussed. Subsequently, recent advances in efficient ICLs (i.e., tunnel-junction-based ICLs and recombination-layer-based ICLs) implemented for monolithic all-PTSCs are critically examined. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities for rationally designing and developing robust ICLs for high-efficiency and stable all-PTSCs are also presented.

In recent years, the need for renewable and sustainable energy resources has increased dramatically due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources. Photovoltaics hold great potential for solving current energy and environmental issues. Notably, tandem solar cells (TSCs), which consist of multiple light absorbers with considerably different band gaps, are promising for breaking the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells via increasing the overall power output of solar modules at low cost. Monolithic TSCs exercise the same working mechanism as those single-junction counterparts, yet contain an interconnecting layer (ICL) as an additional key constituent to concurrently provide electric, optical, and mechanical interconnections. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances in the rational design of ICLs in all-perovskite TSCs (all-PTSCs), which represent a rapidly evolving cutting-edge research field in TSCs. This timely review will guide future fundamental and applied research on ICLs in all-PTSCs and a wide range of other forms of TSC.


Metal halide perovskites with the general formula ABX3 (A+ = CH3NH3+ (MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (FA+), and Cs+; B2+ = Pb2+, Sn2+, etc.; X− = I− and Br−) (Fig. 1a) possess an array of outstanding optoelectronic properties, including a large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1), a high ambipolar carrier mobility (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1), a long carrier diffusion length (>1 μm), inherent tolerance to defects,etc. The past decade has witnessed unprecedented advances in metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiency (PCE) values increasing from 3.9% to a certified value of 25.7%. The PCE of a single-junction solar cell (SC) is ultimately dictated by the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit, which is due essentially to the limited light absorption and inevitable thermalization loss of the light absorber. Notably, their convenient bandgap tunability and facile processability render perovskites one of the most appealing candidates for tandem solar cells (TSCs), which offer an efficient strategy for overcoming the single-junction S–Q limit and further promote the development of perovskite-based photovoltaics.


TSCs are constructed to overcome the S–Q limit by introducing multi-absorbers to broaden the light absorption and mitigate hot-carrier thermalization loss. Henry pioneered a simple graphical method to clearly show the contributions of the intrinsic losses in ideal SCs, which include spectral loss and radiative recombination loss (Fig. 1c and d). Spectral loss contains two parts, that is, the energy lower than the bandgap (hv < Eg) at which photons cannot be utilized (represented by the yellow forward slashes in Fig. 1c), and energy higher than the bandgap (hv > Eg), where thermalization loss occurs (yellow backslashes; Fig. 1c). Despite the spectral loss, the work done by each absorbed photon at the maximum power point (WMPP) is limited by the radiative recombination (W < Eg; yellow horizontal lines; Fig. 1c). Therefore, the power per unit area delivered to the load in single-junction SCs is depicted by the light-green area (Fig. 1c). It is notable that the S–Q limit of single-junction SCs is 33.7% with an Eg of the light absorber of 1.34 eV under 1 Sun illumination (AM 1.5). By contrast, two-junction (2J) TSCs enable a significantly reduced spectral loss, as high-energy photons are absorbed by the top subcell, with a larger Eg, and low-energy photons are harvested by the bottom subcell, with a smaller Eg. On the basis of Henry's graphical efficiency analysis, by varying the Eg of the light-absorbing materials in 2J TSCs, the theoretical PCE of TSCs can be markedly increased, as represented by the enlarged light-green area with a step (Fig. 1d). Under 1 Sun irradiation, the theoretical PCEs for TSCs with 2J, three junctions (3J), and an infinite number of junctions are ∼46%, ∼50%, and 65%, respectively. In particular, a PCE of 86.8% is attainable with an infinite number of junctions under highly concentrated sunlight. Specifically, there are two typical configurations of TSCs, depending on the connection form of the subcells, that is, mechanically integrated four-terminal (4-T) and monolithically integrated two-terminal (2-T) configurations. The 4-T configuration has not found any industrial applications as it involves a higher overall cost and greater optical losses compared with its 2-T counterpart. In this context, monolithically integrated 2-T all-PTSCs stand out as a commercially viable configuration with respect to potentially lighter weights and lower costs for installation.


It has been demonstrated that a front subcell with a bandgap of 1.70–1.9 eV and a rear subcell with a bandgap of 0.9–1.2 eV constitute the most optimal 2J TSCs. It is noteworthy that the bandgap of the perovskites can also be readily tailored over a large range from 1.17 eV to 3 eV by simply engineering the composition of the X and B sites (Fig. 1b). The absorption onset blue-shifts with substitution of the halide of a larger radius with a smaller one (i.e., I− > Br− > Cl−). Importantly, the tuning of the I/Br ratio in Pb halide perovskites progressively alters their bandgap from 1.58 eV to 2.28 eV (785 nm to 544 nm), 1.48 eV to 2.23 eV (840 nm to 556 nm), and 1.80 eV to 2.35 eV (690 nm to 528 nm) for A = MA+, FA+, and Cs+, respectively. The incorporation of Cl− further expands the bandgap up to ∼3 eV. Substituting Pb with Sn could lower the bandgap (1.3eV for CsSnI3, 1.3eV for MASnI3, and 1.41eV for FASnI3). Interestingly, partial incorporation of Sn into Pb-based perovskites greatly lowers the bandgap to 1.17eV, as in MASnxPb1−xI3 where 0.8 > x > 0.5. Such bandgap tuning from MAPbI3 (1.55eV) to MASnI3 (1.30eV) does not follow Vegard's law with a monotonic bandgap decrease, which is due possibly to the competition between the spin–orbit coupling and lattice distortion. Low Sn-containing MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskites (x < 0.5) share the tetragonal I4cm structure of β-MAPbI3, whereas high Sn-containing perovskites (x > 0.5) show the pseudo-cubic tetragonal P4mm structure of α-MASnI3.

As discussed above, the tunable optical absorption of perovskite halides from the NIR to the visible region positions them well for constructing all-perovskite TSCs (all-PTSCs) and hybrid TSCs with various counterparts, including silicon (Si) solar cells, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells, organic solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, etc. Among all perovskite-incorporated TSCs, perovskite/Si, perovskite/CIGS, and all-PTSCs are the most promising ones due to their high efficiencies, the record values of which have reached 29.8%, 24.2%, and 26.4%, respectively. Perovskite/Si TSCs are expected to realize industrial application first due to the dominant position of Si solar cells in the market and their mature scaled production. Perovskite/CIGS TSCs and all-PTSCs represent prospective alternatives to perovskite/Si TSCs since the Si subcell cannot be processed on flexible substrates and it is hard to tune the band gap. Yet, in the long term, the ability of low-temperature solution processing for all-PTSCs contrasts them sharply with perovskite/Si and perovskite/CIGS TSCs, where the bottom cells (CIGS or Si) of high PCE values are only yielded via vacuum-deposition methods. Solution-processing approaches are advantageous in terms of their cost-effectiveness and fabrication flexibility, thereby rendering all-PTSCs compatible with flexible substrates via roll-to-roll manufacturing for future commercialization. It has been estimated that the cost of all-PTSCs is only 1/2–1/3 of that of the perovskite/Si TSCs. Thus, all-PTSCs have been considered as the ultimate goal owing to their high efficiencies, low-cost solution processability, compatibility with flexible devices, etc.
Benefiting from the progress of mixed Pb–Sn halide perovskites with narrower bandgaps as the rear subcell, the past several years have witnessed rapid advances in high-efficiency monolithic all-PTSCs via rational optimization of the perovskite bandgap, device fabrication, and improvements in the interconnecting layer (ICL). Notably, the PCE of 2J (3J) all-PTSCs has been boosted from 10% (6.7%) initially to 26.4% (20.1%) most recently (Fig. 2). In sharp contrast to copious work on single-junction PSCs, investigations into monolithic all-PTSCs have been comparatively rare and limited in scope (Table 1). The ability to tailor the interconnecting layer (ICL), which renders effective electrical, optical, and mechanical interconnections between the subcells, represents an important endeavor towards high-efficiency monolithic all-PTSCs. Notably, compared with much research on light absorbers in subcells, attention has rarely been concentered on the engineering of the ICL in TSCs, and, not surprisingly, far less so in all-PTSCs. In this Review, we aim to provide fundamental insight into the ICL in all-PTSCs. First, the key characteristics required for a robust ICL (i.e., electrical, optical, and mechanical interconnections) to ensure efficient charge-carrier recombination in the ICL are discussed. Afterward, recent advances in state-of-the-art ICLs, both tunnel-junction-based ICLs and recombination-layer-based ICLs, implemented in all-PTSCs are closely assessed. Finally, the challenges and future directions in crafting practical ICLs for high-performance all-PTSCs are outlined.

The introduction of an ICL in monolithic TSCs represents an additional key parameter that strongly dictates the overall performance of TSCs as it simultaneously affects the short-circuit current density (JSC), the fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the tandem devices by imparting good electrical, optical, and mechanical interconnections between the subcells. In particular, a robust mechanical interconnection of the ICL is greatly needed in all-PTSCs to ensure the chemical stability of the front cell since the precursor solution in fabricating the front and rear subcells shares the same types of strong polar solvent (i.e., dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). Actually, there are three strategies to avoid damaging the front subcell when depositing the rear subcell: (1) process the rear subcell using a non-solution approach, i.e., evaporation; (2) develop orthogonal solvents for the rear subcell; and (3) deploy a dense ICL as an interdiffusion barrier against solvents. However, it is currently very challenging to fabricate efficient mixed Pb–Sn narrow-bandgap perovskite devices through the evaporation approach or using alternative solvents to DMF and DMSO. In view of the difficulties with the first two strategies and the advantages of solution processing, a dense ICL as a solvent barrier in all-PTSCs has thus been highlighted at this stage.


The electrical interconnection of the ICL in TSCs has two important aspects, that is, (1) to form an ohmic contact and extract carriers from adjacent subcells with opposite polarities; and (2) to promote the recombination of electrons and holes from these subcells. The working mechanism of each subcell in monolithic all-PTSCs is the same as in single-junction PSCs. Electrons and holes are extracted to an n-type electron-transport layer (ETL) and a p-type hole-transport layer (HTL) in each subcell, respectively, and subsequently annihilate each other within ICL. Notably, as the ETL usually possesses a relatively low work function while the HTL demonstrates a relatively high work function for efficient carrier extraction in PSCs, their work-function difference builds a significant barrier to the current flow. Thus, a direct connection of the p-type HTL in one subcell with the n-type ETL in the other subcell may form a p–n junction with an opposite direction to that of the subcells (Fig. 3a), thereby reducing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of all-PTSCs.

Generally, there are two effective strategies to eliminate the parasitic diode and enable efficient charge recombination from the subcells, that is, introducing a tunneling junction (Fig. 3b) or inserting a recombination layer (Fig. 3c). The former comprises degenerately doped p–n junctions (p++–n++) and is ideal for connecting two p–n junctions without experiencing a voltage drop. This is because high doping concentration (p++ and n++) can significantly reduce the width of the depletion region (l_depletion) at the semiconductor junction, which follows (the equation), where ε is the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor, NA and ND are the number of ionized acceptors and donors per unit length, respectively, ϕ0 is the built-in voltage, and V is the applied bias. 
 In practical application, a high dopant concentration of approximately >10
19 cm−3 is usually applied. With the extremely narrowed depletion region, carriers can easily tunnel through the depletion region to recombine with counter carriers extracted from the neighboring subcell. Meanwhile, Φ0 must be low enough for the energy states of some electrons that tunnel to be equal to the energy states of the holes available on the other side of the barrier. Consequently, the current density through the tunnel junction is high while the resistance and Φ0 are extremely low. ICLs based on the tunnel-junction approach have been widely applied in III–V semiconductor TSCs, as III–V semiconductors usually satisfy the condition of degenerate doping to achieve atomically sharp homojunctions through epitaxial growth via high-vacuum deposition techniques. However, it is usually enormously difficult to attain degenerate doping in both constituents of a heterojunction, especially for the broadly used carrier-transport layers in PSCs.

As noted above, the second strategy for removing the parasitic diode is to introduce a recombination-layer-based ICL, which provides a recombination site for carriers extracted from different subcells in all-PTSCs (Fig. 3c). Such an ICL has been widely employed in many TSCs, such as organic TSCs and silicon TSCs, as it can conveniently adopt the original materials of the HTL and ETL and the structures of the individual subcells. Regarding the recombination layer, there are three main requirements, that is, (1) an appropriate work function to form an ohmic contact with the charge-extraction layers from different subcells of opposite polarities; (2) a high carrier mobility to facilitate charge recombination within the recombination layer; and (3) a low lateral conductivity to prevent shunts due to in-plane conduction of the current from the top subcell to large areas of the bottom subcell.

Based on Kirchhoff's law, the VOC in monolithic TSCs is the sum of the voltages generated from the two subcells, whereas the JSC equals that of the subcell with the lowest produced current. To maximize the PCE of TSCs, the subcells should have equal current densities at their respective maximum power point (MPP), which can be generally achieved by engineering the spectral response or quantum efficiency of the subcells. In this context, an ideal ICL positioned between the subcells is required to be highly optically transparent, particularly in the NIR region, to reduce the optical absorption losses to the narrow-bandgap subcell. Currently, the ICL in all-PTSCs is usually structured as HTL/recombination layer/ETL (Fig. 4 and Table 1), thus light management in ICL should be conducted from two sides, i.e., both charge-transport layers and the recombination layer. Comprehensive consideration of the polarity and selection of the materials for tandem cells is imperative for better compatibility of the materials and the fabrication process. For example, the most commonly used hole-transport material, spiro-OMeTAD, has been identified as a disqualified HTL candidate for single-junction SCs with a p–i–n structure due to strong parasitic absorption losses in the blue and UV spectral regions. However, this does not affect its application in ICLs for all-PTSCs since the absorption of spiro-OMeTAD is not to be compared with that of a wide-bandgap perovskite.


The requirement of the ICL for a mechanical connection between the subcells can be discussed from the viewpoint of device fabrication. During fabrication, firstly, the processing conditions of the ICL should not damage the underneath subcell, as the perovskite absorber can be easily destroyed by a high-energy or high-temperature process. Secondly, the ICL itself should be stable enough against the fabrication of the top subcell. Lastly, the ICL needs to provide a good interdiffusion barrier to solvent penetration for solution-processed all-PTSCs in order to protect the underlying subcells. After fabrication, the effectiveness of the mechanical interconnection of the ICL is largely reflected by its long-term stability in (1) avoiding ion penetration from the subcells into each other, and (2) preventing the detachment of itself or other layers above it.



Fig. 4 summarizes the VOC loss, PCE and FF data in state-of-the-art ICLs used in 2J all-PTSCs. As noted in Section 2.1, tunnel-junction (TJ)-based ICLs and recombination-layer (RL)-based ICLs represent two effective ICLs that render efficient charge recombination from the subcells. Notably, investigations into TJ-based ICLs for all-PTSCs have been comparatively rare and limited in scope, as discussed in Section 3.1. So far, four RL-based ICLs (i.e., a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) RL, an ultrathin metal RL, a highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) RL, and an ambipolar SnO1.76 RL) have been reported. In what follows, recent advances in these state-of-the-art ICLs are scrutinized.


Most ETL and HTL materials employed in single-junction PSCs have a low lateral conductivity and a high charge selectivity. However, the simple ETL/HTL stack interface cannot ensure a fast recombination of carriers from the individual subcells, thereby disqualifying it as an efficient recombination junction for monolithic all-PTSCs. Notably, a large VOC loss was seen using such a rough ETL/HTL interface-based ICL, leading to low FF and PCE values in all-PTSCs. The more efficient tunnel junction based on the ETL/HTL stack can be constructed through further doping of the ETL and HTL, resulting in a significantly decreased VOC loss and a greatly improved FF in the corresponding all-PTSCs (Fig. 4). There are two key issues associated with the implementation of TJ-based ICLs in all-PTSCs: (a) it is difficult to concurrently attain degenerate doping in both the ETL and HTL materials, and (2) the ETL/HTL, often solution processed, is not dense enough to function as a chemical barrier during the solution processing of the top subcell. It is notable that recent studies on TJ-based ICLs in all-PTSCs are not conducted using perovskites with an optimized bandgap and film thickness of the subcells, leading to small JSC and low PCE values of the TSCs (Table 1). Thus, it is challenging to accurately evaluate the performance of these TJ-based ICLs in the corresponding devices. As such, investigation into TJ-based ICLs with optimized subcells is highly desirable to bring about their further improvement.

The first implementation of an ICL in 2J monolithic all-PTSCs was reported in 2016 by simply stacking the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) or poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) HTL of one subcell with the [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETL of the other subcell (Fig. 5a). The two subcells are laminated by pressurizing with a clip and subsequently dried to yield the TSCs. However, a thick HTL (∼2000 nm) is needed to maintain the adhesion between the two subcells during the lamination process, which imposes a significant barrier to carrier recombination due to the low conductivity of the thick HTL. By introducing bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) additives in the P3HT or PTAA HTL, their conductivity displayed a significant 40-fold increase due to the Li/Li+ redox shuttling, thus facilitating hole transport and carrier recombination at the P3HT/PCBM or PTAA/PCBM interface. Further doping of the ETL and HTL was developed to construct more efficient tunnel junctions with decreased depletion widths as the ICL (Fig. 5b). Specifically, to avoid solvent damage during the spin-coating process, both the ICL and the rear subcell are fabricated through thermal evaporation. The structure of the ICL is TaTm/TaTm:F6-TCNNQ/C60:PhIm/C60, where TaTm = N4,N4,N4′′,N4′′-tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine, F6-TCNNQ = 2,2′-(perfluoronaphthalene-2,6-diylidene), C60 = fullerene C60, and PhIm = N1,N4-bis(tri-p-tolylphosphoranylidene)benzene-1,4-diamine, in which F6-TCNNQ and PhIm are used as the dopants in the TaTm HTL and C60 ETL, respectively. Notably, the conductivity of TaTm can be largely increased by two orders of magnitude through F6-TCNNQ doping. Electrons and holes are efficiently recombined in the tunnel junction of TaTm:F6-TCNNQ/C60:PhIm with only 49 mV of VOC loss in the champion device. Despite the absence of optimized bandgaps, the Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.3Br0.7)3–MAPbI3 TSC demonstrates a record PCE of 18.1% with a VOC of 2.29 V. The tunnel junction with an identical structure has also been used in a MAPbI3–MAPbI3 TSC.
In order to render the solution processing of entire all-PTSCs, an ICL comprising the crosslinked p-doped HTL (PTAA) and n-doped fullerene ETL (PCBM) was developed (Fig. 5c). PTAA is crosslinked with the 1,2-bis[4-(azidomethyl)phenyl]-1,2-diphenylethene (TPE-MN3; crosslinker) under UV-irradiation (Fig. 5d), resulting in a dense and robust polymer network with high solvent resistance. Incorporation of the p-type dopant molybdenum tris-[1-(trifluoroethanoyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene] [Mo(tfdCOCF3)3] in PTAA dramatically increases the thick film conductivity by more than three orders of magnitude. On the other hand, hexamethonium bromide (HMB) is adopted to dope the PCBM. The crosslinked PTAA:Mo(tfdCOCF3)3/PCBM:HMB tunnel junction affords a PCE of up to 18.69% in solution-processed all-PTSCs. Recently, covalent crosslinkable materials have been successfully exploited as the HTL or ETL in single-junction PSCs to improve their efficiency and ambient and thermal stability. The introduction of crosslinked carrier-transport layers in the ICL offers a promising strategy to enhance the solvent resistance and ensure the structural integrity of the ICL upon deposition of the subsequent layers.

As noted above, TCO, an ultrathin metal, highly conductive PEDOT:PSS, and ambipolar SnO1.76 have been used for the recombination layer (RL) in the ICLs of all-PTSCs. The highly conductive PEDOT:PSS RL-based ICL was an early attempt and has only been implemented for n–i–p-structured all-PTSCs (Fig. 4 and Table 1). By comparison, p–i–n-structured all-PTSCs with either a TCO RL or an ultrathin metal RL have been more widely investigated. Although a relatively small VOC loss and a high FF are achieved with both TCO and ultrathin-metal RLs (Fig. 4), significant concerns arise from TCO RL due to the need for a high-energy deposition process and its high lateral conductivity. As such, the ultrathin-metal RL stands out as a more promising RL for use in all-PTSCs. Specifically, the recently developed ambipolar-material-based RL greatly simplifies the conventional RL-based ICL, thereby affording a unique platform for the rational design and implementation of novel, simplified ICLs for TSCs.


Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO), and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO), possess both high electrical conductivity and optical transmittance in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions, making them perfect RL candidates for the construction of ICLs through pairing with appropriate ETL and HTL materials in all-PTSCs. TCOs are usually deposited using magnetron sputtering at high temperatures to enable high electrical and optical properties; this technique, however, presents a double-edged sword in terms of its application for ICLs. Clearly, the dense and compact nature of sputtered TCOs could act as an effective physical barrier and the render chemical stability of the bottom cell against solvents during the fabrication of the top cell. However, the high kinetic energy of sputtered particles may damage the underlying soft layers. In order to protect the perovskite and organic carrier-extraction layers from damage during sputtering, a buffer layer prepared at low temperature is required. In principle, the buffer layer should be highly optically transparent with a large bandgap, be energetically well-aligned for carrier-selective contact, and be chemically stable with the contacts (i.e., TCO and the carrier-transport layer). In addition, the buffer layer may function as a diffusion barrier to prevent both organic cation evolution and moisture penetration, thereby overcoming the thermal and environmental instability of PSCs. Metal oxides prepared via atomic layer deposition (ALD) and thermal evaporation, such as SnO2, MoOx, and AZO, were thus judiciously chosen. Notably, significant performance improvements, especially FF (often >0.75), have been achieved in all-PTSCs with a TCO RL due largely to the reduced resistive losses enabled by the high conductivity of the TCOs.

The first report on the ITO RL-based ICL involved the complex structure of PCBM/SnO2/ZTO/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 6a). The thin stack of ALD SnO2 (4 nm)/ZTO (2 nm) layer was used as a buffer to minimize the damage from ITO sputtering. A 100-nm-thick layer of ITO was sputtered to simultaneously serve as the RL and a physical barrier against solvents. It is important to note that this was also the first all-PTSC with an optimized bandgap yet non-optimized film thickness of the perovskite, thus displaying a current density mismatch of 1.7 mA cm−2 from the subcells (Fig. 6b). However, the energetics of ITO relative to the adjoining interlayers along with its superior electrical conductivity imparted the effective transfer of charge carriers and efficient recombination to reduce electrical losses, yielding a small VOC loss of 200 mV and a high FF of 0.7. As a result, the corresponding 2J all-PTSC demonstrated a PCE of 16.9% for a 0.2 cm2 device (Fig. 6c) and 13.8% for a 1 cm2 device. Following this pioneering work, ITO has been used frequently as an efficient RJ in all-PTSCs with continuous improvement of the ICL. For example, recently, ITO was sputtered on the evaporated C60 ETL with only a solution spin-coated bis-C60 buffer layer. In another study, thermally evaporated molybdenum oxide (MoOx) (3 nm) was employed as the buffer layer for the high-energy ITO sputtering process, resulting in a new ICL structure of C60/BCP/Ag/MoOx/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 6d). The ultrathin Ag layer (1 nm) was inserted because of the relatively low electrical conductivity of MoOx. Notably, with both optimized perovskite bandgaps and film thicknesses, the current density mismatch was largely decreased to 0.3 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6e) and a PCE of 21% in the 2J all-PTSC was demonstrated (Fig. 6f). It is worth noting that the PCE of 2J all-PTSCs has recently been enhanced to 23.1% with negligible VOC loss by adopting the same ICL. However, concerns over the long-term stability have arisen from using MoOx as a sputter buffer layer, since iodide in the perovskite can chemically react with MoOx.
As noted above, the sputtered ITO usually has a thickness of 100–120 nm to block solvent penetration. However, further development of such a thick ITO RL is greatly challenged by the following three aspects. First, thick ITO induces a more severe parasitic absorption in the near-infrared spectral range, which will decrease the JSC and PCE of the TSCs. The ITO RL with a thickness of 120 nm only exhibits a transmittance of ∼70% over the range of 720–900 nm, which restricts light harvesting by the low-bandgap perovskite bottom subcell. Second, a thick ITO layer results in shunting between the subcells that severely constrains the performance of large-area devices and prevents the cell-to-cell monolithic integration in thin-film modules. Finally, the thick ITO is not suitable for applications in flexible devices owing to its brittle nature. In this context, chemical protection has been slowly diverted from the ITO RL to the buffer layer during device fabrication (Fig. 7).
Recently, a conformal ALD-aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) layer was developed to concurrently function as a sputter buffer layer and an interdiffusion barrier through the use of ultrathin poly(ethylenimine)-ethoxylated (PEIE) (1 nm) as the nucleation layer (Fig. 6g and h). The nucleophilic hydroxyl and amine functional groups in PEIE can serve as nucleation sites during the ALD process, resulting in a densely nucleated AZO layer that exhibits substantially improved barrier properties against DMF and H2O permeation. With this effective solvent barrier, the thickness of the sputtered IZO RL is decreased to as thin as 5 nm while retaining a significant carrier-combination capability. This thin ICL enables the construction of both rigid and flexible 2J all-PTSCs with a high performance of 23.1% and 21.3% (Fig. 6i), respectively. Further improvements can be achieved through precise tuning of the growth conditions to yield compact ALD layers without the assistance of a nucleation layer. To this end, recently, a conformal ALD-SnO2 buffer layer with a thickness of only 12 nm was fabricated, which alone prevents solvent damage, while the thicknesses of the ITO RL were reduced to 10 nm (Fig. 7b). Notably, an ALD-SnO2 buffer layer of 10–20 nm is widely noted in the literature.
Since the high-power deposition of ITO via sputtering stands out as an obstacle that could limit further improvement of the ITO RL-based ICL in all-PTSCs, a solution-processed PEDOT:PSS/ITO nanoparticle layer as the RJ was thus developed. Using a highly volatile acetonitrile (CH3CN)/methylamine (CH3NH2) (or ACN/MA) solvent-based perovskite solution, the first fully solution-processed monolithic 3J all-PTSC was demonstrated with this PEDOT:PSS/ITO nanoparticle RL. A VOC of 2.83 V was achieved with three perovskite absorbers of cascade bandgaps of 1.94, 1.57, and 1.24 eV. Despite a PCE of only 6.7% from this 3J all-PTSC, this proof of concept opens up new opportunities for large-scale, low-cost, printable perovskite multi-junction solar cells. Very recently, a highly efficient interconnect based on an ultrathin ALD-grown InOx layer with a thickness of only about 1.5 nm was developed for perovskite-organic tandem cells. As such, the low-temperature ALD technique was used to shed light on the improved deposition of TCO-based RLs for future use in all-PTSCs.

In addition to TCO, an ultrathin metal is another extensively used RL. Carrier recombination in the ICL is energetically similar to Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination, yet all carriers involved are majority carriers collected from the respective subcells (rather than one minority and one majority carrier as in the classic SRH case). Thus, the mechanism of RL-based ICLs can be taken as trap-assisted tunneling. The incorporation of metal represents a typical strategy for enhancing this mechanism. As an ALD-grown SnO2 film with an exceptional conformality as thin as ∼10–20 nm can serve as an excellent chemical barrier to the underneath perovskite and functional layers, an ultrathin metal is thus inserted as the RL to replace sputtered ITO, thereby avoiding the potential damage associated with high-temperature sputtering. By contrast, metal is usually compatible with thermal evaporation, which operates at a much lower temperature. Currently, gold (Au) is the most widely used ultrathin metal RL due to its appropriate work function, good conductivity, and stability. Regarding optical transmittance, a thinner metal film is better. In practical application, an Au film with a thickness of ∼1 nm is adopted for efficient carrier combination while maintaining a large sheet resistance (i.e., a low lateral conductivity to reduce shunting). In the ALD-SnO2/Au combination, SnO2 can provide superior carrier extraction as the ETL and act as a solvent barrier. However, an additional organic ETL (e.g., C60) is still needed on the bottom perovskite film for protection. This is because the ALD technique cannot be applied directly on bare perovskite films as H2O is used to hydrolyze the SnO2 precursors in the ALD process.

The first study that employed ultrathin metal as the RL in 2J all-PTSCs had an ICL structure using a hybrid fluoride silane–incorporated PEIE (or FSIP) system, i.e., FSIP/C60/BCP/Cu:Au alloy/PEDOT:PSS. The FSIP hybrid system was designed to afford chemical protection for the underlying perovskite film. However, a large VOC loss of 150 mV was found in this work due to the energy band mismatch and high optical loss. Robust ALD-SnO2 was then incorporated as a solvent barrier to protect the underneath perovskite and work together with the ultrathin metal RL (Fig. 8a). The SnO2 barrier layer also improved the performance of the wide-bandgap front cells by providing excellent electron extraction. Notably, the ultrathin Au layer (∼1 nm) affords efficient electron–hole recombination as the TSCs without the Au layer exhibit an obvious ‘S’ shape in the J–V curves near the open-circuit voltage and thus a low FF (Fig. 8b). Certified PCE values of 24.8% for small-area devices (0.073 cm2; Fig. 8c) and 22.1% for large-area devices (1.05 cm2; Fig. 8d) were enabled by this effective ICL with its small VOC loss and high FF (>0.80). In addition, the VOC and FF of large-area devices are comparable to those seen in small-area devices, suggesting the promise of this ICL in scaling up all-PTSCs. Accordingly, a PCE of 21.4% has been achieved for a 12 cm2 device by adopting the same ICL. Notably, the efficiencies of 3J all-PTSCs also increase significantly due to robust ALD-SnO2/Au-based ICLs. A record PCE of 20.1% with a VOC of 2.8 V and FF of 81.1% were obtained via ALD-SnO2/Au-enabled efficient interconnection, with optimal bandgaps of 1.99, 1.60, and 1.22 eV for the front, central, and rear subcells, respectively (Fig. 8e). A highly transparent, thick NiO layer was implemented in this work for interface engineering to yield a compact HTL (80 nm NiO/8 nm PTAA) for subsequent fabrication of the central subcell (Fig. 8f). In another study via assembling 1.73 eV wide-bandgap, 1.57 eV mid-bandgap, and 1.23 eV narrow-bandgap perovskite absorbers, a PCE of 16.8% for monolithic 3J all-PTSCs was attained with the ICL of C60/SALD-SnO2/Au/PEDOT:PSS, where SALD represents atmospheric-pressure spatial-ALD. It is notable that, since the conventional ALD technique requires a vacuum, ALD has a low deposition rate and is thus very time-consuming. By contrast, SALD operates at a much higher deposition rate and is closer to industrial requirements. The high deposition rate not only enables conformal and pinhole-free deposition but also leads to the formation of large grains with fewer grain boundaries and thus improved transmittance and conductivity.

Highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as an RL in the early stages of ICL study for all-PTSCs. PEDOT:PSS is a conductive organic semiconductor with high transparency from the near-UV to the near-IR region. Remarkably, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be markedly improved by many orders of magnitude through post-treatment (i.e., secondary doping) with various compounds (e.g., salts, zwitterions, cosolvents, acids, alcohols, and phenol), making it comparable to ITO and suitable as a transparent electrode. Depending on the different doping levels, PEDOT:PSS can operate as an HTL or an electrode. Highly conductive PEDOT:PSS with its appealing transparency and ductility makes it a promising candidate as an RL. Commercial PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) with a conductivity of 0.2–1 S cm−1, a widely used conductive electrode in optoelectronic devices, has been explored as an RL for all-PTSCs. However, these studies on PEDOT:PSS RL were not performed using optimized subcells (Table 1), thus resulting large VOC losses and relatively low FF values (Fig. 4). In this context, the implementation of PEDOT:PSS RL with optimized subcells is the key to providing reliable evaluation and insight into its further improvement. In addition, the development of PEDOT:PSS as an efficient RL has been rather restrained due to the following two issues. First, PEDOT:PSS is usually dispersed in H2O, and the direct spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS may damage the underneath perovskite subcell. Second, the simple HTL/PEDOT:PSS/ETL architecture may fail to function as a chemical barrier during fabrication of the rear perovskite subcell. In this context, organic-solvent-soluble PEDOT:PSS with an appropriate doping level and dense film-forming characteristics may render it a more appealing RL for use in all-PTSCs. This can be a subject of future research.

Nonetheless, PEDOT:PSS was first introduced as an RL in a MAPbI3–MAPbI3 TSC. The ICL had the structure spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI, during which the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) was used to modify the surface and form a work-function contrast between the top and bottom sides of the PEDOT:PSS film via electrostatic interaction between the positively charged PEI and the negatively charged PEDOT:PSS. A film transfer lamination technique was used to form the PEDOT:PSS RL from its aqueous solution. Notably, this ICL is robust for supporting the solution-processed perovskite top cell because of the incorporation of the PEI/PCBM:PEI ETL. By contrast, a similar ICL with the structure of spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/C60 was found not to be compatible with solution processing of the subsequent perovskite film. Clearly, a material that promotes the interaction with the constituent layer in the ICL would enable the formation of a dense ICL with an efficient solvent-resistance capability. By extension, the use of a crosslinking agent will also render a dense ICL to protect the bottom subcell against solvent penetration, thereby dispensing with the need for the deposition of thick TCO or SnO2 layers as a chemical barrier.

As noted in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, ALD-SnO2 has been broadly implemented as an outstanding chemical barrier in ICLs for all-PTSCs while providing superior electron extraction as an ETL. However, recently, the incomplete oxidization of tin was reported to form ALD-SnO2−x (0 < x < 1), which demonstrates ambipolar carrier-transport properties due to the co-existence of Sn2+ and Sn4+. The incorporation of Sn2+ leads to a mid-gap band at ∼0.8 eV, which enables the hole transport and forms an ohmic contact with the rear perovskite subcell (Fig. 9b). Such an ambipolar carrier mobility is truly revolutionary for constructing ICLs in all-PTSCs, as it enables ALD-SnO2−x to currently function as an ETL for the front subcell, an HTL for the rear subcell, and an RL for charge recombination, in addition to providing a chemical barrier. The greatly simplified ICL, which consists of C60 (15 nm)/SnO1.76 (9 nm), not only outperforms the typical ICL of C60/SnO1.76/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 9a and c), by avoiding the parasitic absorption from the ITO and PEDOT:PSS, but also improves the stability by eliminating the possible damage caused by the deposition of the ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers. As a result, PCEs of 24.4% (Fig. 9d) and 22.2% were achieved with small-area (5.9 mm2) and large-area (1.15 cm2) devices, respectively. This seminal work on the n+/n (i.e., C60/SnO1.76) stack-based ICL demonstrates a new materials concept that ICLs for TSCs do not necessarily require both n-doped and p-doped layers to ensure decent electrical interconnections between the subcells.


In spite of promising recent advances in RL-based ICLs, considerable efforts are still required to increase the PCE to >30% and promote large-area production of all-PTSCs. To this end, we outline the scientific and practical challenges in achieving robust ICLs and the outlook concerning materials design and development, ICL characterization, ICL stability and scalability in order to realize the full potential of ICLs for high-efficiency and stable all-PTSCs.


To render efficient TJ- and RL-based ICLs, carrier-extraction layers are essential. In contrast to single-junction PSCs that only require one transparent carrier-extraction layer, all-PTSCs, and by extension TSCs, necessitate transparent ETLs and HTLs in the ICL. Despite the large variety of organic and inorganic materials developed as effective ETL (TiO2, SnO2, C60, etc.) and HTL materials (spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS, NiOx, etc.), only some of these are suitable for application in ICLs considering the issues involving their fabrication compatibility with perovskites, their optical transparency, and their long-term stability. The widely used HTL material spiro-OMeTAD, in single-junction PSCs, resulted in a large parasitic absorption in the blue and UV regions when employed in the ICL of n–i–p structured all-PTSCs. In particular, the acidic and hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS is the only most widely used HTL in ICLs for all-PTSCs with a p–i–n configuration, although it has been found to be highly reactive with Pb–Sn narrow-bandgap perovskites. Clearly, it is highly desirable to develop new transparent ETL and HTL materials with sufficient chemical inertness with perovskites, for constructing efficient ICLs with greatly enhanced stability. This calls for substantial efforts, not only from the chemistry and materials-science communities but also from the theoretical community. In particular, machine learning, as a powerful computational tool to formulate the structure–property relationships of new materials, is envisioned for greatly accelerating the development of robust carrier-extraction layers.

Specifically, the complicated fabrication of ICLs and the parasitic absorption due to thick ICLs represent two significant limitations that may hinder the broad application and attainable PCE of TSCs, respectively. Recently, a simplified ICL based on ambipolar SnO1.76 was constructed for all-PTSCs. In this context, the use of ambipolar two-dimensional semiconductors (e.g., graphene; black phosphorene; and metal chalcogenides (MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2, etc.)) with outstanding gate-controlled capabilities and unique physical properties could open up an avenue to crafting ICLs with new architectures (i.e., a greatly simplified ICL). In particular, the development of organic ambipolar materials with the ability to crosslink may lead to breakthroughs over current ICLs of rather complex architectures as they impart a multi-functional ICL, that is, simultaneously performing as an ETL, an HTL and a solvent barrier.

For TJ-based ICLs, further degenerate doping is advantageous for decreasing the width of the depletion region and thus enhancing the carrier recombination, since all-PTSCs that capitalize on simple organic ETL/HTL stacks as TJ-based ICLs report low PCE values due to the significant losses associated with low VOC and FF values. Since it is often difficult to concurrently achieve degenerate doping in both the ETL and HTL in TJ-based ICLs, particularly for those commonly used materials in single-junction PSCs, this entails the development of new ETL and HTL materials that can be conveniently doped. In this context, lessons may be learned from tandem organic light-emitting diodes and small-molecular-weight organic photovoltaics, as small-molecule organic semiconductors exploited in these devices demonstrate largely tunable conductivities over several orders of magnitude by simply varying the dopant concentration. In particular, hydrophobic dopants are preferred to ensure the long-term stability of all-PTSCs. In addition to degenerate doping, interfacial engineering represents a vital strategy to promote the quality of the HTL/ETL stack for efficient charge recombination. To this end, placing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that conformally cover the ETL/HTL interface may stand out as a promising means of greatly improving the HTL/ETL stack interface.

For RL-based ICLs, the ALD-SnO2/Au combination exemplifies the most encouraging candidate, which displays a negligible VOC loss and high FF (FF > 0.8 in 3J all-PTSCs). However, it is appealing to replace the expensive noble metal Au with earth-abundant Cu to reduce the cost towards industrial application. It is notable that Ag is not appropriate as an alternative replacement for Au as I− ions migrating from the perovskite film could react with it. Other materials with a suitable work function, such as graphene and CNTs, which are widely used as transparent electrodes in optoelectronic devices, are also potential RL candidates.

The ability of low-temperature solution processing to afford all-PTSCs with low-cost fabrication and compatibility with flexible substrates, does, however, require a good interdiffusion barrier against solvent penetration for protection of the subcell underneath. So far, this chemical barrier has been provided primarily by hard materials, such as sputtered ITO and ALD-SnO2, although this has hampered extensive research on all-PTSCs due to limited accessibility to the required instruments. Recently, PSCs with crosslinkable ETL and HTL materials have been reported with markedly improved photo, moisture, and thermal stabilities, signifying their promising potential for affording chemical protection. The soft chemical barrier enabled by the crosslinked carrier-extraction layers opens up an avenue towards all-solution-processed ICLs with excellent solvent resistance. From the viewpoint of structures, crosslinking can be performed either by synthesizing new materials that contain crosslinkable functional groups (e.g., alkyl side chains) or by incorporating crosslinkable small-molecule agents in the host materials. The latter approach is relatively facile as it could readily employ commercially available agents, dispensing with the need for any complex synthesis of the former. In addition, it is particularly important to be able to perform crosslinking under mild conditions (e.g., low temperature, visible light, etc.) due to the stability issues of the underlying perovskite absorber. On the other hand, the development of alternative solvents to DMF and DMSO for perovskite-precursor dissolution could provide an additional strategy to avoid chemical damage of the bottom perovskite. For example, use of the highly volatile CH3CN/CH3NH2 (ACN/MA) solvent mixture has been found to enable solution processing of MAPbI3 and MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3.


Considering the complexity of the multilayer structure in the ICL, its optimization can be extremely time-consuming, which thus highlights the need for its comprehensive characterization prior to fabricating into tandem devices to avoid working laboriously on tandem prototypes. Investigation into the properties and performance of the ICL is a sophisticated process, and includes the morphological, electrical, optical and mechanical characterization of the function of the ICL in TSCs. Overall, a standardized technique for this, as well as the definition of key diagnostic parameters, are yet to be established. However, based on routine characterization techniques and theoretical simulations, much information is attainable to accelerate the improvement of ICLs for TSCs.

Since the topography is decisive for the deposition method or the resulting film quality and the required thickness of the subsequent layers, gaining insight into the morphological properties of the underneath perovskite absorber and ICL enable better deposition of the ICL and the top perovskite absorber, respectively. The morphological characteristics of the ICL in terms of complete coverage, roughness, thickness, etc., can be carried out via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. The complete surface coverage of the ICL is essential in TSCs to avoid shunt and short paths. In addition to the influence on the top perovskite deposition, the surface topography of the ICL also strongly affects light scattering and thus reflection and interference in the layer stack. Similarly, the layer thickness also has a great effect on the optical properties of the ICL, such as parasitic absorption. Notably, conformal and thin ICLs can be fabricated via monitoring and improving the morphology of the underlayers to decrease the optical loss in all-PTSCs. ALD-AZO has been reported as a sputter buffer layer and an interdiffusion barrier in ICLs, and was significantly thinned using an ultrathin PEIE film (1 nm) as a nucleation layer.
For electrical characterization, first the electronic properties of the different functional layers in the ICL stack can be obtained using photoelectron spectroscopy, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Together with optical spectroscopy (e.g., UV-vis), the band edge positions of the materials in the ICL are available for understanding the charge-transfer energetics. The carrier mobilities and charge-carrier densities of the functional materials can be assessed using Hall measurements to gain insight into the carrier-transport properties. In particular, the electrical resistivity or the sheet resistance of the RL in the ICL is needed to identify a large lateral resistance and avoid shunts in large-area devices. As for the ICL performance, an immediate method for understanding its electronic properties is to evaluate the diode's performance of the ICL junction. This approach is commonly used in III–V multi-junction tandem research.
To characterize the optical properties of functional materials in the ICL, optical transmittance and reflectance spectra via spectrophotometry as well as spectroscopic ellipsometry techniques are well-established methods for daily experiments. In addition, EQE and IQE measurements also provide the overall response of the tandem devices. Using these methods, the parasitic absorption and back-reflectivity of the layers in the ICL can be analyzed. For TJ-based ICLs, the optical characterization should be conducted using doped films as it has been reported that the parasitic absorption increases upon doping in organic materials. It is worth noting that for the TCO RL-based ICL, an increased conductivity is usually accompanied by increased parasitic absorption in the IR part of the optical spectrum. This tradeoff between high conductivity and sufficient optical transparency therefore highlights the importance of optical and electrical characterization.
Regarding the mechanical characterization, permeability tests of the ICL with polar solvents (i.e., DMF and DMSO) are first suggested as it will easily identify the capacity of the ICL against solvent penetration and facilitate thickness tuning of the ICL. Measurement of the Young's modulus, toughness, thermal expansion coefficient, and the glass transition temperature of the functional layers in the ICL can deliver important information that reflects the internal mechanical stresses in the ICL stack. Through such basic and easy characterization, the mechanical reliability of the ICL used in all-PTSCs can be established.
In addition to experimental characterization, theoretical simulations, including optical simulation and electrical simulation, are powerful tools for gaining detailed insight into the loss in all-PTSCs. It is worth noting that there is open-access and commercial software available for both optical simulation and electrical simulation in any given specific solar-cell architecture. With optical simulation, it is easy to determine the impact of reflections and parasitic absorbance for any functional layer in the ICL with a given thickness, and this has already been carried out in several reports. As for electrical simulation, detailed information related to the charge generation in the perovskite absorber, charge transfer and recombination in the ICL can be obtained to yield knowledge on performance-limiting factors such as barriers at heterojunctions and the density of recombination centers at different locations in the ICL. In a next step toward improved ICLs for all-PTSCs, simulations are expected to play a greater role in largely simplifying this process, thus avoiding labor-intensive procedures in the experimental investigation of tandem prototypes.

Although the instability of perovskite absorbers is the biggest challenge in all-PTSCs, the device stability reflects the collective stability profiles of the wide-bandgap front subcell, narrow-bandgap rear subcell, the ICL, and the interfaces. Thus, rational ICL design is an important part of improving the environmental and operational stability of all-PTSCs. The primary principle of ICL design in terms of the device stability can be addressed from two perspectives. First is the stability of the ICL itself, that is, the functional materials incorporated in the ICL including the ETL, HTL and RL, need to be stable, non-reactive with perovskite absorbers under various conditions, and it is better if they are hydrophobic. Second is the role of the ICL in promoting the stability of the resulting all-PTSCs. This contains different aspects such as protecting the underneath subcell, benefiting the deposition of the top subcell, and maintaining the long-term stability of all-PTSCs.

Among the various functional layers in the ICL, it is worth noting that the HTL is the most unstable component for all-PTSCs with either n–i–p or p–i–n structures. The thermal stability of the functional layers in the ICL plays an important role since annealing of the top subcell, that is fabricated on the ICL, is usually needed at ≥100 °C. However, spiro-OMeTAD as the most commonly used HTL in the ICL for n–i–p-structured all-PTSCs is especially unstable at elevated temperatures. Besides, the hygroscopic dopants, usually lithium salts, that are used to increase the hole-extraction and -transfer ability of spiro-OMeTAD, can result in the poor operational stability of the devices. To improve the ICL for n–i–p-structured all-PTSCs, efforts on increasing the glass transition temperature of spiro-OMeTAD, replacing the hygroscopic dopants with hydrophobic ones, as well as developing alternative HTL materials are needed. Currently, high-performance all-PTSCs are all fabricated with a p–i–n structure since the mixed Pb–Sn subcell demonstrates a higher PCE in the p–i–n configuration. This is because the oxidation of Sn2+ into Sn4+ will form a layer of n-type SnOx on the top surface of the Pb–Sn perovskite, which will block hole transfer to the HTL in an n–i–p-structured device but will not block electron transfer to the ETL in a p–i–n-structured device. Notably, PEDOT:PSS is the only widely used HTL in ICLs for p–i–n-structured all-PTSCs. However, it has been found to react adversely with Pb–Sn perovskites, leading to severely worsened charge extraction and thermal stability. This is currently one of the most urgent problems related to ICL improvement in all-PTSCs with a p–i–n configuration. Fortunately, the replacement of acidic PEDOT:PSS with neutral PEDOT:PSS has been shown to largely extend the lifetime of mixed Pb–Sn PSCs, which is expected to benefit the stability of all-PTSCs. For future study, strategies such as adding a buffer layer, adopting an alternative HTL material (e.g., NiOx), and developing HTL-free rear subcells deserve further exploration to avoid this reactivity issue between PEDOT:PSS and the Pb–Sn perovskite. Specifically, NiOx is the most stable HTL material reported so far. However, PSCs with a NiOx HTL usually suffer from a lower performance compared with PEDOT:PSS HTL-based devices. Improvements in the preparation of the NiOx HTL and the corresponding interfaces, which enhance the performance of NiOx HTL-based single-junction devices, are promising for promoting the implementation of NiOx in all-PTSCs.
As for the influence of the ICL on the stability of the all-PTSCs, this is mainly related to the ICL deposition techniques and morphology, and the morphology is dictated by the deposition method. Considering the complexity of the multilayer structure in the ICL, a combination of different deposition methods is usually adopted, including solution processing (e.g., spin-coating), evaporation, sputtering and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Spin-coating, as one of the most convenient and low-cost deposition methods, has been widely used to prepare the ETL (e.g., PCBM), HTL (e.g., spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS, PTAA) and even the RL (e.g., ITO nanoparticles, PEDOT:PSS) in the ICL stack. However, solution processing is highly substrate dependent, and often leads to pinholes, cracks, and non-uniform coverage on rough substrates. On one hand, these defects can act as a point of ingress for solvent during processing of the top subcell and cause detrimental effects on the bottom subcell; on the other hand, these defects can affect the uniform deposition and crystallization of the top perovskite, leading to more defects in the top perovskite absorber layer that may result in shunts or even short circuits in the tandem cells. This will all decrease the stability of the resulting tandem devices. Notably, these issues mentioned above in solution processing can be minimized via modifying the solution and substrate characteristics. The addition of a self-assembled monolayer has been reported to enable the uniform and conformal coating of functional layers on the CIGS layer with a large surface roughness of 1 μm. The use of multiple thin layers is also beneficial to minimize the influence of defects because it can disrupt the growth of defects and increase the solvent diffusion path length. Similarly, more improvements are expected in future studies to further promote the application of low-lost solution processing of ICLs and also deal with solvent permeation. Compared with solution processing, using evaporation, sputtering and ALD it is much easier to achieve a conformal, uniform and pinhole-free film on rough substrates. In addition, the introduction of nucleation layers can further improve the growth of the subsequent layer via these techniques. The application of these three methods in ICL deposition can be found in Table 1. Notably, the morphology and film quality of the ICL stack also play a significant role in the long-term stability of all-PTSCs. A highly conformal ICL not only functions as a solvent barrier layer but also acts as a good ion-diffusion barrier to avoid ions penetrating from or into the subcells, thereby enhancing the operational and long-term stability of tandem devices. Specifically, TCOs in ICLs can effectively prevent ion diffusion and unfavorable reactions, and thus play a positive role in enhancing the device stability. By contrast, the use of ultrathin metal as an RL in the ICL may pose a problem as metal ingress from the top contact during device operation has been found to exacerbate perovskite degradation. However, further experimental exploration is needed before excluding ultrathin metals from ICLs due to the tiny amount used and other hard materials involved in the ICL as a diffusion barrier.
It is worth noting that there are lots of internal and external mechanical stresses in solar cells, which can result in fracture and delamination in the devices during operation. The internal stresses are usually generated due to the thermal expansion coefficient difference between the layers, as well as thermal excursions and damage accumulation during operation, whereas external stresses can result from deformation (e.g., bending, stretching, and twisting) during manufacturing, installation, maintenance and servicing. Specifically, the internal stresses induced in all-PTSCs, due to thermal-expansion-coefficient differences, are predicted to be much higher than those in single-junction PSCs due to their multi-layer structure, which thus largely enhances the risk of delamination. Although currently there are fewer reports dealing with delamination in all-PTSCs, experience may be gained from delamination in single-junction PSCs. The approaches developed to enhance the toughness of the interface in single-junction PSCs, such as adding interfacial layers, scaffolding, interpenetrating interfaces, and introducing additives, are also applicable in all-PTSCs. Specifically, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) has recently been developed to increase the adhesive toughness at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite to enhance the mechanical reliability of a single-junction PSC, thus highlighting the application of SAMs as multifunctional layers. Last but not the least, in addition to the strategies discussed above, the development of encapsulation plays a crucial role in protecting the device from external stimuli and enables decent long-term operational stability.

Currently, nearly all all-PTSCs are fabricated with small areas, with several reports published on 1 cm2 devices. This is mainly because, compared with single-junctions PSCs, the difficulty in fabricating tandem devices and scaling them up is much larger due to their complicated structure. However, the ability to scale up devices is a critical step towards their future application and commercialization. Regarding the scaled-up fabrication of ICLs for all-PTSCs, it can be discussed from two aspects, that is, the material properties and the deposition techniques.

As for the ICL properties, one important issue that has been less studied in small-area all-PTSCs is the lateral conductivity. As has been known in the Si tandem community for years, the ICL in tandem devices should have good vertical conductivity to facilitate charge recombination through the junction but have minimal in-plane conductivity to minimize the spatial impact of shunts. The in-plane conductivity of the ICL may exert a minimal effect in small-area tandem devices, yet can significantly affect the performance of large-area tandem devices or tandem solar modules. So far, the high-performing all-PTSCs have all been fabricated based on an RL-based ICL (Table 1). Due to the conductive properties of the RL, minimizing the lateral conductivity of RL-based ICLs is more critical and urgent for the scalability of all-PTSCs. As discussed in Section 3.2, ITO and ultrathin Au are the two most widely used RLs in the ICL for all-PTSCs. Although relatively small VOC loss and high FF values are achieved with ITO RLs, the high lateral conductivity of ITO may limit its use in large-area all-PTSCs, especially for ITO RLs with a large thickness of ∼100–120 nm. However, reducing the lateral conductivity of the TCO RL in all-PTSCs has recently been demonstrated. The fabrication of a thin and conformal PEIE (1 nm)/AZO (25 nm)/IZO (5 nm) RL resulted in an RL with a sheet resistance of the order of 10–100 kΩ sq−1, which is significantly higher than a 120-nm-thick ITO recombination layer at ∼30 Ω cm−2. This high sheet resistance can significantly inhibit lateral conduction to shunt pathways and is expected to pave the way for TCO RLs for use in large-area all-PTSCs or solar modules. Regarding the ultrathin Au RL, a thickness of ∼1 nm is usually adopted in practical applications (Table 1). Although there have been no reports on measuring the sheet resistance of a 1 nm Au RL-based ICL, a large sheet resistance is expected since the Au film should be discontinuous with such a thin thickness. Specifically, the recently developed ambipolar material SnO1.76 not only greatly simplifies the conventional RL-based ICL but also excludes the use of conductive materials as the RL, thereby showing promising applications in all-PTSCs modules. Although TCO with a large sheet resistance, ultrathin Au and ambipolar SnO1.76 function as promising candidates for use in RL-based ICLs in large-area all-PTSCs, systematic studies and improvement of their lateral resistance are still needed in future work.
As shown in Table 1, solution processing (mostly spin-coating), evaporation, sputtering and atomic layer deposition (ALD) are widely used deposition techniques in ICL fabrication. While evaporation and sputtering are well-established industrial techniques, sputtering uses more energy and heat compared with evaporation. Thus, neutralization or other advanced approaches to manage the energetic plasma in sputtering should be used in future studies to minimize the damage to soft materials. As for conventional ALD, which requires vacuum conditions, its low deposition rate and time-consuming characteristics limit its application in large-scale deposition. Fortunately, spatial-ALD (SALD) that operates at atmospheric pressure has a much higher deposition rate in all-PTSCs, and paves the way towards industrial operation. Notably, it has been reported that the high deposition rate in ALD facilitates the formation of large grains whilst retaining conformal and pinhole-free deposition, thus leading to improved transmittance and conductivity. For solution processing, it is important to transfer from spin coating to more scalable techniques, such as blade coating, slot-die coating, bar coating, spray coating, inkjet printing and screen printing. It is worth noting that up-scaling a thin-film technology is not trivial and often needs systematic modifications, which is of great importance since the morphology and film quality of the ICL significantly affect both the bottom and top subcells, as well as the efficiency and stability of the tandem devices (Section 4.3). In this context, the experience can be learned from single-junction PSCs to avoid working laboriously on tandem prototypes.

All-PTSCs use the same working mechanism as their single-junction counterparts, yet containing an ICL as an additional key constituent concurrently provides electrical, optical, and mechanical interconnections. In addition to wide- and narrow-bandgap perovskite subcells, the ICL is a critical component that has hindered the development of all-PTSCs. Fortunately, continuous efforts have recently led to all-PTSCs with efficiencies exceeding those of the best-performing single-junction PSCs. However, to further push the efficiency evolution of all-PTSCs, further understanding of the ICL and its improvement represents an important endeavor. In this Review, the essential characteristics of ICLs in monolithic all-PTSCs are presented, and are aimed at providing the guiding principles for new materials and engineering designs for ICLs. Subsequently, recent progress in viable TJ-based ICLs and RL-based ICLs employed for all-PTSCs is discussed. Finally, we analyze the main scientific and practical challenges of ICLs in terms of the materials and structure design, characterization, stability and scalability. Identifying these challenges would enable the PSC community to better address these issues with creative solutions, thus rendering all-PTSCs for industrial applications as affordable photovoltaic systems.
