Long term device stability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) are important for practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Here, we report the use of ethyl cellulose (EC) and acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (oMWCNTs) as a co-gelator to gel organic solvents and the application of these gels for quasi-solid state DSCs. The gels are formed by blending EC and oMWCNTs with methoxypropionitrile (MPN) and acetonitrile (ACN). The loadings of EC and oMWCNTs can be as low as 4 wt% and 1.5 wt%, respectively, for the gel formation. The total minimum gelator loading of EC and oMWCNTs is lower than that with EC alone. In the absence of oMWCNTs, the EC loading must be more than 12 wt% for the gel formation. Gel electrolytes were prepared by adding iodine, 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), guanidinium thiocyanate and 4-tert-butyl pyridine into the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels, and they were used to fabricate quasi-solid state DSCs. The optimal PCE of the gel DSCs was 6.97% under AM1.5G illumination, quite close to that of control liquid DSCs, while the gel DSCs have better long term stability than their liquid-state counterparts. The former retains more than 98% of the initial PCE after 30 days, whereas the PCE of the latter decreases to about 80%.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are deemed as promising candidates to replace silicon solar cells in the future because of their low cost and decent power conversion efficiency (PCE). PCEs as high as 11–12% had been achieved for DSCs employing I−/I3− or Co2+/Co3+ complexes as the redox mediators. A DSC is fundamentally a photoelectrochemical device, which comprises a mesoporous anatase TiO2 layer anchored with dye, a redox mediator and a catalytic counter electrode. The electrolyte which comprises the redox mediators plays a key role in the photon-to-electricity conversion, including the regeneration of the dye molecules, the transport of the redox couples and the pore filling of the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode. An electrolyte with a high diffusion coefficient of the redox mediators is required to generate a high PCE for DSCs. Organic solvents with low viscosity and high dielectric constant, such as acetonitrile (ACN), are commonly used as the solvents of the liquid electrolyte for DSCs. One major problem with these organic liquid electrolytes is their high volatility. This leads to a severe leakage problem, causing poor performance stability. Several approaches have been reported to overcome this problem. Inorganic p-type semiconductors, organic hole conductors, non-volatile ionic liquids, quasi-solid state gel electrolytes and solid-state electolytes have been explored to replace the volatile liquid electrolytes. Quasi-solid state gel electrolytes can improve the photovoltaic stability while they do not remarkably compromise the photovoltaic performance. A gel comprises fluid(s) immobilized by three-dimensional solid networks inside. Gels can be categorized into chemical and physical gels according to the interactions within the solid networks. The solid networks of a chemical gel are held together by covalent chemical bonds, whereas the three-dimensional solid networks are due to physical interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, in a physical gel. Thermally reversible physical gels can readily penetrate into the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 work electrode and are frequently used for DSCs. Polymers, nanoparticles, and low molecular weight organic molecules have been used as gelators for the physical gels of organic solvents. Recently, it has been found that carbon nanomaterials could gel some organic solvents. For example, carbon nanotubes can gel ionic liquids and some liquid organic surfactants. Graphene oxide can form gels with organic solvents, liquid organic surfactants and water because of the functional groups.

The ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes has a significant effect on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs. Nanometer materials, such as TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles and functionalized carbon nanotubes, were investigated as additives in the gel or polymer electrolytes. These nanometer additives can facilitate the dissociation of the ions and ion diffusion, so as to improve the photovoltaic performance of the solid or quasi-solid state DSCs. Unfunctionalized CNTs were also investigated as additives in gel electrolytes, in order to improve the electron transfer and electronic conductivity. Only one material is usually used as the gelator in gels. If organic solvents can be gelled by two gelators simultaneously, the loading required for one gelator can be reduced, and new functions can be introduced by the second gelator.
In this work, we report the preparation of organogels with ethyl cellulose (EC) and acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (oMWCNTs) as co-gelators and application of the gels for high-performance quasi-solid state DSCs. EC is a commercially available and biodegradable polymer, which is chemically inert and non-toxic. oMWCNTs are also chemically inert and have good thermal stability. They have a high specific surface area and a large amount of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups. EC can gel the cosolvent of MPN and ACN when its loading is more than 12 wt%, whereas oMWCNTs cannot gel the cosolvent. But addition of 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs can lower the loading of EC to 4 wt% for the formation of the organogel. The quasi-solid-state DSCs with EC and oMWCNTs as the co-gelator show a PCE as high as 6.97% and have good performance stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report gels with a polymer and functionalized CNTs as the co-gelator for organic solvents and their application for quasi-solid state DSCs.

MWCNTs produced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) were purchased from the Chendu Organic Chemicals Co Ltd in China. They had a purity of higher than 95%, outer diameter of 8–15 nm, inner diameter of 3–5 nm, length of approximately 50 μm and a specific area of greater than 233 m2 g−1. MWCNTs were functionalized by refluxing in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid (volume ratio = 3:1) at 60 °C for 10 h.

DSL 18 NR-T (20 nm) and WER2-O (350–450 nm) TiO2 pastes were purchased from Dyesol. Ruthenium 535-bis TBA (N719 dye) and Surlyn (ionomer films of 25 μm thickness) were obtained from Solaronix SA. PMII (purity >98%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (purity = 99%), tert-butanol anhydrous (purity >99.5%), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, iodine, 3-methoxypropionitrile (purity >98%), acetonitrile (purity = 99.8%) and EC (containing 48–49.5% ethoxyl groups) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Guanidinium thiocyanate was purchased from Fluka. Titanium tetrachloride was obtained from Merck. These chemicals were used as received.
The EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels were prepared by blending appropriate amounts of EC and oMWCNTs into the ACN-MPN cosolvent (volume ratio = 1:1). The mixtures were then constantly stirred at 80 °C for 24 h to ensure complete dispersion of EC and oMWCNTs in the co-solvent. The gels were formed after the solutions were cooled down to room temperature. The gel electrolytes were prepared by adding 0.2 M iodine, 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) into the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN solutions. These mixtures became gel electrolytes after they were stirred at 80 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to room temperature.

DSCs were fabricated through the conventional process. The TiO2 working electrode consists of a 10 μm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T of 10) and a 5 μm-thick scattering TiO2 layer (Dyesol WER2-O Reflector paste). The TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (volume ratio = 1:1) for 24 h. An EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel electrolyte was spread evenly on the dye-impregnated TiO2 photoanode. Then, the photoanode and the counter electrode were sealed together with a 25 μm-thick Solaronix polymer melt. The assembled devices were kept at 80 °C for 10 min to allow the electrolyte to penetrate into the mesoporous dye-impregnated TiO2 layer.


Dynamic mechanical analyses were carried out using an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES) G2 Rheometer in the dynamic mode. The cone diameter and cone angle were 20 mm and 1°, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Zeiss Supra 40 field emission scanning electron microscope. The ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes were measured using a CDM 210 Conductivity Meter equipped with a CDC 641T cell and a temperature sensor. The thicknesses of the TiO2 layers were determined using a Tencor P-10 Alpha-Step profiler. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were acquired with an ECO CHEMIE Autolab (PGSTAT 302N and FRA2) system. The frequency range was 105 to 10−1 Hz, and the amplitude of the ac signal was 10 mV. A dc bias of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was superimposed on the ac signal. Steady-state cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with the ECO CHEMIE Autolab system. A platinum microelectrode with a diameter of 25.6 μm, a platinum strip and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential scan rate was 10 mV s−1.

The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) by a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which was certified by the JIS C 8912 standard. A circular mask with a diameter of 5.2 mm was placed on the DSCs during the tests. The area of each device was 0.212 cm2. The DSCs were kept in the dark at room temperature for the device ageing study.

The chemical structure of EC is shown in Scheme 1(a). It has hydroxyl and ether groups. It can be dissolved in ACN and MPN at 80 °C. The EC/ACN-MPN solution is still a fluid after it is cooled down to room temperature, when the concentration of EC is low, such as 6 wt% (Fig. 1(a)). It becomes immobile at room temperature when the EC concentration is higher than 12 wt% (Fig. 1(b)). EC cannot form a gel with the cosolvent when its concentration is lower than 12 wt%.
EC and oMWCNTs were used a co-gelator for organic solvents in this work. The chemical structure of oMWCNTs is shown in Scheme 1(b). The presence of the carboxylic groups is confirmed by FTIR as reported in our previous work. oMWCNTs can be dispersed in polar organic solvents in an ultrasonic bath. Though oMWCNTs could gel ionic liquids, we found that oMWCNTs could not gel the ACN-MPN cosolvent. This is because to gel ionic liquids is usually much easier than to gel polar organic solvents.
Both EC and oMWCNTs were used as a co-gelator to gel the ACN-MPN cosolvent. MPN is used in this work because of its relatively good thermal stability. In the presence of oMWCNTs, less EC is required for the gel formation. The EC loading can be lowered to 6 wt% for the gel formation, when 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs are added (Fig. 1(c)). The rheological behavior of EC/ACN-MPN and EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN mixtures was studied by the dynamic mechanical analyses at room temperature. The viscoelastic behaviour of a material is governed by the frequency dependence of the storage (G′) and loss (G′′) moduli, which represents the elastic and viscous components of the material, respectively. For an ideal elastic solid, G′′ is zero, while G′ is zero for an ideal viscous fluid. As shown in Fig. 2, G′ is always much greater than G′′ in the whole frequency range at an applied strain of 1% for both the EC/ACN-MPN and EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN mixtures. The dynamic mechanical results indicate that both the EC/ACN-MPN and EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN mixtures behave as gels at room temperature. In the absence of oMWCNTs, the EC loading must be higher than 12 wt% for the gel formation, while oMWCNTs cannot gel the organic cosolvent. As shown in Fig. 1(a), only 6 wt% EC cannot gel the cosolvent at room temperature. The formation of the organogel with 6 wt% EC and 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs suggests that both EC and oMWCNTs act as a co-gelator for the organic cosolvent. The solid networks in the gels consist of both EC and oMWCNTs. In terms of the chemical structure of EC and oMWCNTs, we infer that the oMWCNTs bridge the EC chains via mainly the hydrogen bonds for the formation of the three-dimensional solid networks. The polar ACN and MPN solvents are immobilized by the solid networks because of the polar–polar interactions and hydrogen bonds between the fluids and the solids.
Both the G′ and G′′ values are greater for the EC/ACN-MPN gel than for the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel. These differences also suggest the different solid networks in the two gels. In the EC/ACN-MPN gel, the gel formation is related to the intertwining of the EC chains due to the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of the EC chains. This is different from the solid networks in the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel that also involve the interactions between EC and oMWCNTs.
The three-dimensional solid networks in the EC/ACN-MPN and EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels were further investigated by investigating their corresponding xerogels. The xerogels were prepared by freezing the organogels with liquid nitrogen and removing the liquid phase via a vacuum pump. The SEM image of the EC/ACN-MPN xerogel shows porous three-dimensional networks comprising fibrillar structures (Fig. 3). This microstructure is similar to other polymer gels. The SEM image of the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN xerogel is different from that of the EC/ACN-MPN xerogel. oMWCNTs are present and they bridge the EC chains. The bridging effect by the oMWCNTs accounts for the low EC loading required for the gel formation.
The EC loading required for the gel formation is related to the dispersion of the oMWCNTs. To improve the oMWCNT dispersion, oMWCNTs were dispersed in the ACN-MPN cosolvent with an ultrasonic disperser. EC was then added into the mixture, and it was heated to 80 °C and subsequently cooled down to room temperature for the gel formation. The ultrasonication of oMWCNTs can reduce the minimum EC loading required for the gel formation from 6 wt% to 4 wt% in the presence of 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs. This also evidences the participation of oMWCNTs in the three-dimensional solid networks in the gels. Because the ultrasonication does not affect the dissolution of EC in the cosolvent, the reduction in the EC loading must be related to the ultrasonication-induced improvement in the dispersion of oMWCNTs in the cosolvent. In addition, the ultrasonication time can affect the length and bundling of the oMWCNTs, so that it can affect the solid networks and the properties of the organogels. The morphology change in solid networks of the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels with the ultrasonication time of oMWCNTs was investigated by SEM, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The average pore size of the gels decreases with increasing ultrasonication time of the oMWCNTs, from 0 to 60 min, while the density of pores increases.
Both EC and oMWCNTs function as gelators to gel the organic cosolvent in this work, and they participate in the same solid networks. This is different from other studies using nanometer materials, such as oxide nanoparticles and CNTs, as additives. The additives in those works may not participate in the formation of the three-dimensional solid networks in the gels or they form their own solid networks. This work is also different from the gel formation of unfunctionalized or functionalized CNTs with ionic liquids. Though it is much easier to gel ionic liquids than organic solvents, our previous work indicates that a very small amount of oMWCNTs cannot gel ionic liquids but lowers their viscosity.

Gel electrolytes were prepared by adding I2, PMII, guanidinium thiocyanate and TBP into the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels. The ionic conductivity of the former is 14.57 mS cm−1 for the gel electrolyte with 4 wt% EC and 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs at room temperature, higher than that (12.6 mS cm−1) of the latter. This can be attributed to the lower gelator loading for the former in comparison with the latter.

As discussed above, the solid network structure of the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels is affected by the ultrasonication dispersion of oMWCNTs. The ultrasonication of oMWCNTs can affect the ionic conductivity of the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels as well. Fig. 5 presents the dependence of the ionic conductivity at room temperature on the ultrasonication time of oMWCNTs. The EC loading was 6 wt% for the gel prepared by dispersing oMWCNTs by mechanical stirring, and it reduced to 4 wt% when ultrasonication was applied for the oMWCNT dispersion. The ionic conductivity increased to 14.57 mS cm−1 when the oMWCNTs are subjected to ultrasonication for 20 min. But a further increase of the ultrasonication time to 60 min decreased the ionic conductivity of the 4 wt% EC-1.5 wt% oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel to 12.87 mS cm−1.
The ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes were studied from 25 °C up to 70 °C (Fig. 6). All the ionic conductivities increase with the increasing temperature. The temperature dependence of ionic conductivities is analyzed with the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) model,
σ(T) = σoT−1/2 exp[−Ea/R(T − To)],
where
σo is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and To is the glass transition temperature of the electrolyte.
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the conductivities of the organogels with and without oMWCNTs have similar temperature dependence. The activation energy is 2.72 kJ mol−1 for the 12 wt% EC/ACN-MPN gel, slightly higher than that (2.57 kJ mol−1) of the 4 wt% EC-1.5 wt% oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel. The difference is consistent with their ionic conductivities at room temperature. Usage of less gelator can facilitate the ionic transport across the gels.
The effect of the ultrasonication time of oMWCNTs on the ionic conduction was also investigated (Fig. 6(b)). The activation energy was plotted versus the ultrasonication time of oMWCNTs (Fig. 7). The activation energy decreases from 2.66 kJ mol−1 to 2.57 kJ mol−1 when the ultrasonication time increases from 0 to 20 min. Then, it increases to 2.78 kJ mol−1 when the ultrasonication time is further increased to 60 min. The dependence of the active energy on the ultrasonication time is consistent with the dependence of the ionic conductivity on the ultrasonication time. These can be attributed to the effect of the ultrasonication time on the structure of the solid networks of the gels. As observed in the SEM images, the pore size decreases and the pore density of the gel network increases with increasing ultrasonication time of the oMWCNTs. The increasing pore density facilitates the permeation of the ions throughout the three-dimensional solid network, giving rise to the increase in the rate of diffusion of the ions. However, if the ultrasonication time is too long, the pore size of the gel network may become too small and retard the ion transport.
The ion diffusion in the organogels was investigated by steady-state cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 8). Because the size of I3− is larger than I−, the I3− diffusion is the current-limiting factor. Thus, the cathodic current is related to the reduction of I3−. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) can be estimated according to the following equation,
Iss = 4nrCFDapp,
where
Iss is the steady state current, n is the number of electrons per molecule involved in the electrochemical process, F is the Faraday constant, r is the radius of the microelectrode, and C is the concentration of the redox species. The presence of oMWCNTs in the gel electrolytes has an effect on the current. The Dapp value of the 12 wt% EC/CAN + MPN gel electrolyte without oMWCNTs is 2.31 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, lower than that (3.32 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) of the gel electrolyte with oMWCNTs. These results are consistent with the temperature dependence of ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes.
As mentioned above, the ultrasonication of oMWCNTs can affect the ion transport through the gel electrolytes. The steady-state cyclic voltammograms of the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gels prepared by ultrasonication of the oMWCNTs for different times are presented in Fig. 8(b). The Dapp value is plotted against the ultrasonication time of oMWCNTs (Fig. 9). The Dapp value for the gel electrolytes increases from 2.97 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 to 3.32 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, when the ultrasonication time increases from 0 min to 20 min. It drops to 2.28 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 when the oMWCNTs are ultrasonicated for 60 min. The ionic diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with the activation energies of the organogels.

The EC/ACN-MPN and EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel electrolytes were used as the electrolytes of DSCs. A control device with the ACN-MPN liquid electrolyte was also fabricated. Fig. 10(a) shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the quasi-solid state DSCs using EC/ACN-MPN gel electrolytes with different EC loadings. The photovoltaic performances, including the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE, of these DSCs are listed in Table 1. Jsc and Voc drop with the increasing EC loading, leading to a decrease in PCE. This suggests that less gelator can lead to a higher photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs because the three-dimensional networks formed by the gelator can impede the diffusion of the ionic species.

The J–V curves of DSCs using EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel electrolytes with different ratios of EC to oMWCNTs are illustrated in Fig. 10(b), and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. When 0.1 wt% oMWCNTs are added into the 12 wt% EC/ACN-MPN gel electrolyte, the photovoltaic efficiency of the gel DSCs decreases. Thus, the photovoltaic efficiency cannot be improved when oMWCNTs are used as an additive for a gel electrolyte of DSCs. But the photovoltaic efficiency of the gel electrolyte with 6 wt% EC and 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs is 6.82%, higher than the gel DSCs without oMWCNTs. The increase in the photovoltaic efficiency can be attributed to the less gelator loading because of the usage of the EC-oMWCNTs co-gelator. The diffusion of ionic species in the gel electrolytes is enhanced, which improves the Jsc of the solar cell. When the oMWCNTs loading is further increased to 2.5 wt%, the PCE falls to 6.37%. The black oMWCNTs scatter light and reduce the light absorption by the dye molecules. Hence, when the loading of oMWCNTs was further increased, Jsc decreases and so does the PCE. The Voc remains almost constant regardless of the oMWCNT loading.

Because the ultrasonication of oMWCNTs can reduce the total gelator loading and improves the ionic transport through the gel electrolyte, gel DSCs with the oMWCNTs dispersed by ultrasonication for different times were fabricated and tested (Fig. 11). The photovoltaic parameters are recorded in Table 3. The PCE increases to 6.97%, when the oMWCNTs are ultrasonicated for 20 min. This is mainly caused by an increment in the Jsc of the solar cells. This PCE is quite close to that of the control liquid DSC. Prolong ultrasonication of oMWCNTs causes a drop in the photovoltaic efficiency, which is a result of the decrease in both Jsc and Voc. These can be attributed to the effect of the ultrasonication on the ionic transport through the gel electrolytes.

The EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel DSCs were also investigated by EIS (Fig. 12). There are two semicircles on the Nyquist plots. The semicircle at the high frequency regime represents the charge transfer at the counter electrode, while the one at the low frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, TiO2/dye interface and the transport of electrons through the mesoporous TiO2 film. The interfacial resistance (Ri) and charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode (Rct) can be determined by fitting the Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 12. The Ri and Rct values are 3.95 Ω μm−1 and 2.54 Ω, respectively, for the gel DSC. Both of them are only slightly higher than those (3.33 Ω μm−1 and 2.07 Ω, respectively) of the liquid DSC. These values are comparable to those reported in the literature. The different Ri and Rct values for the two devices with gel and liquid electrolytes can be ascribed to the slow ion diffusion in the gel electrolyte than in the liquid electrolyte. The interface between the counter electrode and the electrolyte is also different for the two devices. When the solid networks are in contact with the counter electrode, the effective surface area for the electron transfer from the counter electrode to the electrolyte is reduced. As a result, the Rct value is higher for the device with the gel electrolyte than with the liquid electrolyte.
Presumably, the effect of the incorporation of oMWCNTs into the gel electrolytes on the photovoltaic efficiency of DSCs is due to the increase in the ionic conductivity of the gel electrolyte, because less gelator is needed for the gel formation. As oMWCNTs have carboxylic groups, they are able to anchor the surface of the TiO2 electrode. However, the oMWCNT loading is quite low, and they are almost immobile because they form solid networks in the gel electrolytes. Thus, only a little amount of oMWCNTs may anchor the TiO2 surface. This cannot give rise to an appreciable effect on the photovoltaic efficiency of the devices.
However, the incorporation of oMWCNTs into the gel electrolytes can affect the light absorption by the dye molecules. In fact, the gel electrolytes with oMWCNTs are dark because oMWCNTs scatter light.
The ageing stability of DSCs with the EC-oMWCNT/ACN-MPN gel and ACN-MPN liquid electrolytes was investigated over a period of 30 days (Fig. 13). The cells were kept in the dark at room temperature when not tested. The photovoltaic performance of the gel DSC is more stable than that of the liquid DSC. The PCE of the gel DSC drops by 1.28% after 30 days. In contrast, the PCE of the liquid DSC falls by 19.1% over the same period. Obviously, the different stabilities are due to the different electrolytes used in the two DSCs. Gel electrolytes behave like solids, so that the leakage problem caused by the liquid electrolyte is effectively relieved.

EC and oMWCNTs are used as a co-gelator to gel an organic cosolvent of ACN and MPN. The presence of oMWCNTs can lower the minimum EC loading required for the gel formation. In the absence of oMWCNT, the EC loading must be higher than 12 wt% for the gel formation. The EC loading can be reduced to 4 wt% EC, when 1.5 wt% oMWCNTs are dispersed in the cosolvent by ultrasonication. Both EC and oMWCNTs participate in the three-dimensional solid networks in the gels. The oMWCNTs can bridge the EC polymeric chains. The organogels with EC and oMWCNTs as the co-gelator are used for quasi-solid state gel DSCs. The PCE of the gel DSCs can be as high as 6.97%, quite close to that of liquid ACN-MPN DSCs, whereas the gel DSCs have much better photovoltaic stability than the liquid DSCs.
