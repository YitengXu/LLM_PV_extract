Synthetic access to new push–pull molecules based on 3-cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene and triphenylamine moieties is presented herein using a clean methodology. The key step involves a direct heteroarylation coupling reaction in the presence of a homogeneous or heterogeneous [Pd] catalyst followed by Knoevenagel condensation performed in ethanol as a solvent. Structure–electronic property relationships of the new molecular materials are discussed and then their use as donors in bilayer planar heterojunction solar cells is investigated.

Within the class of conjugated materials, the donor–acceptor (D/A) approach with electron-donating (D) and electron acceptor (A) blocks in the conjugated backbone is currently one of the most widely investigated strategies for the development of active materials for organic electronics. High power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells were also achieved with D/A materials (small molecules or polymers) that present moderate or low band gaps and broad absorption bands. The D/A structures vary from the simple push–pull systems of D–π-A small molecules, in which the D and A groups are separated by a π-conjugated spacer, to an alternated repartition of the D and A blocks along the conjugated systems, i.e. D–A–D or A–D–A in molecular systems or (D–A)n in π-conjugated polymers. Most of the synthetic pathways to prepare D/A conjugated systems are based on cross-coupling reactions requiring the use of halogenated heterocycles and organometallic reagents. Even if high yields can be achieved, coupling reactions undoubtedly generate the dispersion of metallic residues within the conjugated materials requiring improved purification processes. The direct (hetero)arylation of activated C–H moieties has emerged as an alternative to avoid organometallic coupling reactions, thus allowing both the decrease of the number of steps and the enhancement of the atom efficiency along the synthetic procedures. The use of simpler syntheses based on activated C–H moieties for the elaboration of symmetrical D–A conjugated systems for organic electronics, polymers or small molecules is increasingly used, and special attention was paid to thiophenes over the past few decades. To achieve high yields, the coupling procedures generally involve homogeneous [Pd] catalysts and ligands such as phosphine derivatives. The use of heterogeneous catalysts such as Pd(OH)2/C (Pearlman's catalysis) or supported palladium has recently emerged and is more and more used for the synthesis of conjugated semiconductor materials. The main advantage of the heterogeneous catalyst lies in the fact that it can be separated from the medium and reused even if a partial loss of activity was highlighted due to homogeneous catalysis. Consequently, the environmental impact and the cost of the catalyst are reduced and make it a tool of choice for the development of compounds whose uses are in connection with sustainable development.

We have developed new D/A building blocks in which the D and A groups are grafted on the 3 and 4 positions of a thiophene cycle. Due to the asymmetric electronic distribution, the reactivities of the 2 and 5 positions of the thiophene ring are different, thus allowing the regioselective building of designed D/A structures. From 3-alkoxy-4-cyanothiophene, various symmetrical D–A–D structures were synthesized, some of which were used as donor materials in organic photovoltaic devices. As a further contribution, we have investigated the synthesis of unsymmetrical D–A small molecules I–III based on 3-cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene, triphenylamine (TPA) and dicyanovinyl moieties (Fig. 1), by focusing on green synthetic pathways combining direct C–H functionalization and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The hexyloxy and the cyano groups grafted on the thiophene ring have been respectively localized on the side of the donor and acceptor parts in order to reinforce the push–pull nature of the molecules.

The starting material 3-cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene 1 was prepared according to a previously reported three step synthesis from acrylonitrile and methyl thioglycolate. In order to check if the reactivity of the 2 and 5 positions of 1 is different, the first attempts of direct arylation were realized with bromotriphenylamine (TPA-Br) under conventional conditions (Scheme 1). The analysis of the crude revealed the formation of a non-separable mixture of mono and disubstituted thiophene. Cyano and alkoxy groups have both the potential to direct arylation according to the CMD mechanism, and make the regioselective arylation even more difficult.

To overcome this lack of regioselectivity, the aldehyde function was first grafted. The latter was regioselectively introduced onto the position 2 of the 3-cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene 1 using the conventional BuLi/DMF sequence (Scheme 2) affording 2 in 67% yield. It can be noted that (i) the acidity of the thiophene to afford a 2-lithiated derivative is enhanced by the acceptor character of the cyano group and (ii) no nucleophilic addition of BuLi on the nitrile group was observed. The protection of the aldehyde with ethylene glycol was carried out to isolate the acetal derivative 3 in 87% yield.
As the direct arylation of thiophene carbaldehyde with TPA-Br has already been described, attempts of direct arylation were realized on the thiophene carbaldehyde 2 using the synthetic procedure reported by Fagnou et al. (Scheme 3 and entry 1 in Table 1). Under these conditions the target compound I was not obtained and 2 was not recovered. To check the compatibility of the starting aldehyde under basic conditions, compound 2 was stirred with K2CO3 in toluene at room temperature. It turns out that the medium became black instantaneously and proton NMR showed a complete disappearance of the proton of the aldehyde group. However, after protection of the aldehyde in the acetal group, direct arylation was performed with 3, under the previous conditions, which led to the target molecule 4 in 90% yield (entry 2 in Table 1). A simplified procedure by removing the expensive ligand PCy3 also gave compound 4 in 88% yield (entry 3). Nonetheless, high yields achieved by Fagnou's procedure require an excess of thiophene derivatives. Well justified in the case of cheaper thiophene carbaldehyde, in the case of acetal 3, whose excess is lost, the yield calculated with respect to thiophene drops to 45%. Moreover, under stoichiometric conditions (entry 4) the conversion is drastically lowered to 43% yield.

Consequently, to improve the coupling reaction with TPA-Br with respect to the high-added value compound 3, various conditions have been used as illustrated in Scheme 4 and gathered in Table 2. First, attempts were made, using Pd(OAc)2, KOAc and dimethylformamide (DMF) as the catalyst, base and solvent respectively. By heating the mixture at 90 °C in a slight excess of TPA-Br (i.e., 1.1 equiv.) and without a ligand, the yield of the TPA-thiophene derivative 4 reached 58% (entry 1, Table 2). The addition of 10 mol% of triphenylphosphine in the solution did not enhance the coupling conversion (entry 2, Table 2). However, by increasing the quantity of TPA-Br to 1.5 equiv. the yield rose up to 63% (entry 3, Table 2). In addition, it is noteworthy that heating the reaction mixture to 150 °C led to 76% yield (entry 4, Table 2).

Second, to simplify the procedure, direct arylation has also been investigated using the traditionally-heterogeneous catalyst Pd(OH)2/C (Pearlman's catalyst), in dimethylacetamide (DMA) at 150 °C. The arylated thiophene 4 was isolated in 80 and 93% yield depending on the amount of TPA-Br (entries 5 and 6, Table 2). Thus, it turns out that these two tests using the heterogeneous catalyst in a very simplified procedure interestingly led to the highest yields. Moreover, the purification processes involved to isolate the target molecule 4 are simplified since a simple filtration on a small plug of silica gel is sufficient. When TPA-Br is used by default relative to compound 3 (entries 2 and 3, Table 1) yields for the conversion are high but on the down side 55% of the high-added compound 3 is lost. The use of the two compounds in stoichiometric amounts remains interesting since the yields are correct and only 20% of 3 and TPA-Br are lost (entry 5, Table 2). Nevertheless, since compound 3 is produced in three steps with high production costs (economy and time), synthetic conditions allowing to minimize the loss of 3 rather than the stoichiometric consumption of reagents have been privileged (entry 6, Table 2).
Acetal 4 was quantitatively hydrolyzed by treatment with HCl (1 M) and acetic acid to give target aldehyde I. This derivative was further engaged in Knoevenagel condensations with malononitrile under reflux in ethanol to give compound II in 95% yield (Scheme 5). The condensation of I with para-trifluorophenyl acetonitrile was also performed at room temperature in ethanol in the presence of a catalytic amount of tBuONa leading to compound III in 60% yield.
The crystallographic structures of single crystals of compound II, obtained from a slow evaporation of ethanol–chloroform solutions, have been analysed by X-ray diffraction. Compound II crystallizes in the triclinic P space group. The structure is determined from two independent molecules IIa and IIb differing in the conformation adopted by the extremity of the hexyl chains (Fig. S1 in the ESI). For both molecules the dicyanovinyl moiety is in the plane defined by the thiophene unit and adopts a δ cis conformation with the cyano groups pointing in the direction of the sulfur atom. The molecules stack along the same axe with an alternation of IIa and IIb. The distances between the plane defined by the thiophene rings is about 3.5 Å. Between the column of molecules no close interactions are observed.
The electronic properties of the push–pull molecules II and III have been evaluated by theoretical calculations and analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Theoretical and experimental data are gathered in Table 3.

Theoretical calculations were performed at the ab initio density functional level with the Gaussian09 package by using Becke's three parameter gradient corrected functional (B3LYP) with a polarized 6.31G(d,p) for the HOMO and LUMO level determinations. Hexyl chains were replaced by propyl chains to limit the computational time (Fig. S2 in the ESI). The optimized structures of compounds II and III present the planar structures of the π-conjugated backbones and a torsion of the outermost phenyl units of TPA. The HOMOs are mainly allocated on the TPA moiety and alkoxy-thiophene side whereas the LUMOs are localized on the cyano-thiophene part extended on the dicyanovinyl unit for II and III. In the case of III, we can also observe a slight delocalization on the benzene ring. Thus the alkoxy and the cyano groups reinforce the push–pull nature of the molecules. By comparison with III, the HOMO and LUMO levels of II are stabilized due to the double cyano effect. The internal charge transfer is much more efficient in the case of II diminishing the band gap from 2.40 eV to 2.19 eV for III and II respectively.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of II and III in CH2Cl2 exhibit two distinct absorption bands (Fig. 2). The high energy band with a maximum around 300 nm always observed for small molecules or polymers based on the alkoxycyanothiophene could be assigned to the specific transition involving this building block. The second band at 493 nm for III and 566 nm for II, strongly dependent on the acceptor character, corresponds to an internal charge transition (ICT) as already demonstrated for analogue push–pull molecules. Comparison of the spectrum of II with the unsubstituted derivative, showing an ICT band at 501 nm, confirms that the localization of the alkoxy and the cyano groups reinforcing the push–pull character of the molecule. UV-vis absorption spectra have also been realized on the spin cast films of II and III (Fig. S3 in the ESI) and show a red shift with maxima of the absorption bands at 591 nm for II and 512 nm corresponding to band gaps of 1.70 and 1.94 eV respectively for II and III. These results confirm that the second cyano group of the dicyanovinyl unit compared to the para-trifluoromethylphenyl moiety increases the acceptor character, thus allowing reduction of the band gap of the push–pull molecules.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in methylene chloride in the presence of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as a supporting electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3, both compounds can be oxidized and reduced. Compound II shows a reversible one-electron oxidation wave with an anodic peak potential Eox1 at 1.02 V and a non-reversible reduction peak Ered1 at −0.88 V. In the positive potential region, the CV of III presents two one-electron oxidation processes with anodic peaks Eox1 and Eox2 at 0.96 and 1.47 V respectively, corresponding to the formation of a radical and dication. Compound III can also be reduced in the radical anion and dianion through two reversible one-electron waves with the cathodic peak potential Ered1 and Ered2 at −1.13 and −1.53 V respectively. Compared to II, the more extended conjugated system of III allows access to poly-charged species both in oxidation and reduction. On the other hand, the values of Eox1 for the two compounds are close and around 1.0 V, whereas the replacement of the pCF3 phenyl unit of III by a cyano group leads to a positive shift of 250 mV for Ered1. These results have the same trends compared to the theoretical calculations indicating the proximity of the HOMO levels for the two compounds and a stabilization of the LUMO level for II due to the more acceptor character of the dicyanovinyl unit. Gaps determined by electrochemistry are in good agreement with optical gaps.
The potentialities of these small push–pull molecules as donor materials in photovoltaic devices have been evaluated. Simple bilayer planar heterojunction solar cells (BHJ) have been prepared by spin-casting a chloroform solution of the donor onto indium tin oxide (ITO) precoated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) followed by a 30 nm layer of C60 deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum and then by the deposition of an 80 nm aluminium electrode (27 mm2 of active area). After a thermal treatment for 15 min at 100 °C, devices made from II as donor materials under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination presented a photovoltaic effect with average values of the short circuit current density JSC of 4.94 mA cm−2, the open circuit voltage Voc of 0.70 V, the fill factor FF of 0.29, and the power conversion efficiency PCE of 1.22% with a maximum of 1.23% for the best devices (Fig. S3 in the ESI). It can be noted that no notable photovoltaic effect (PCE < 0.1%) has been observed for compound III.

In conclusion new push–pull donors have been synthesized by using direct arylation coupling between the acetal derivative of 2-formyl-3-hexyloxy-4-cyanothiophene and TPA-Br. Several procedures with various relative amounts of reactants in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous [Pd] catalysts have been tested. It was demonstrated that a simple procedure by using Pearlman's catalyst obtained the best yield for the acetal thiophene derivative. Finally, from the key TPA-thiophene formyl derivative, push–pull molecules were easily obtained by Knoevenagel condensation in ethanol. The optical and electrochemical studies have shown that the new derivatives presented electronic properties compatible for applications in organic photovoltaics. First attempts in bilayer planar heterojunction solar cells revealed a modest photovoltaic effect that could be improved by working on device engineering such as bulk heterojunction and on structural modifications, for example by introducing a new tailored acceptor part.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively, with CDCl3 as the solvent and the 1H and 13C chemical shifts were determined by reference to residual nondeuterated solvent resonances (7.26 ppm for 1H NMR and 77.36 ppm for 13C NMR). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift in ppm (δ), multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration.

All reactions were carried out under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents of the highest purity grade were used as received. 3-Cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene 1 was prepared according to a previously reported procedure and bromotriphenylamine (TPA-Br) was purchased from a commercial source and used without purification.
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using a platinum disk as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel as the reference electrode. The crystallographic data of compound II, the preparation and the characterization of solar cells are presented in the ESI.

To a solution of 3-cyano-4-hexyloxythiophene 1 (3.34 g, 15.9 mmol) in anhydrous THF (50 mL) cooled at −78 °C was added a solution of n-BuLi in hexane (13 mL, 20.8 mmol, 1.3 equiv.) under an argon atmosphere. After stirring for 1 h at −78 °C, anhydrous dimethylformamide (2 mL, 25.8 mmol, 1.9 equiv.) was added dropwise.
