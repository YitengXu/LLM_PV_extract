A novel acceptor of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) with diphenylamine-vinylene side chains was firstly designed and synthesized for building efficient low bandgap (LBG) photovoltaic copolymers in this paper. Based on benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene and the designed new BT acceptor, two dimensional (2D) like conjugated copolymers have been prepared by Stille coupling polymerization. The resulting copolymers were characterized by NMR, elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. UV-vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry measurements indicate that these copolymers have good optical and electrochemical properties. A copolymer with thiophene modified benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene exhibits better light harvesting and a smaller bandgap of the two copolymers. The electronic structures of the model compounds were also studied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated and measured with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PCBM/Ca/Al. The primary results showed that the device based on the copolymer with thiophene modified benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene had a higher efficiency of 1.88%, attributed to the smaller bandgap and improved active film morphology. All the prepared copolymers are promising candidates for efficient PSCs with high Voc.

Over the past few years, there has been increasing interest in polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to the growing demand for clean and renewable energy. Compared to the commercial inorganic solar cells, PSCs are expected to be cheaper because they can be fabricated at a much lower cost with the aid of large area solution casting or roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible modules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs achieved a significant improvement due to the introduction of the so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept, where an active blend consisted of an interpenetrating network of electron-donating polymer donors and electron-withdrawing fullerene derivatives. In earlier times, the regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was the most extensively investigated polymer donor with high charge carrier mobility and strong absorption in the visible region. However, the PCEs of these PSCs based on P3HT as donors and PCBM as acceptors are limited at 4–5%, because P3HT has a relatively large bandgap and a high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. To address these issues, low bandgap (LBG) polymers were developed to capture more solar photons and achieve higher PCEs. The push–pull effect of the donor and the acceptor in this system will form an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and further result in the lower energy absorption band. Actually, PCEs over 7% were successfully obtained by using low bandgap copolymers in BHJ solar cells as electron-donating materials.

Most of the above-mentioned LBG copolymers focused on the main chain system. In the past few years, two dimensional (2D) like conjugated polymers with conjugated side chains have been designed and synthesized to improve the absorption, charge transport, as well as their device performance. The “side chain conjugation” concept can also facilely adjust the energy levels of the pristine copolymers via conjugated bridges, and enhance the miscibility with fullerene acceptors in BHJ device fabrication. In order to broaden the absorption spectrum, Li and his co-workers firstly reported some polythiophenes modified with conjugated side chains of bi(phenylenevinylene), bi(thienylenevinylene) and phenothiazinevinylene. Subsequently, triphenylamine, carbazole, phenothiazine and phenanthrenylimidazole were designed and integrated on the thiophene units as conjugated side chains. Huang et al. recently attached the strong electron-withdrawing groups onto the end of the side chains using the electron-donating conjugated bridges, resulting in a novel two dimensional D–A copolymer system. By this strategy, the copolymers based on fluorene, silafluorene, carbazole, phenothiazine, dithienopyrrole and cyclopentadithiophene with different pendant acceptor groups of malononitrile and 1,3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acid were designed and prepared for PSCs. As mentioned above, most of the conjugated side chains were combined with the donor units in the reported D–A copolymers, it still remains a challenge to explore novel 2D like acceptors and understand the relationship of their structures and properties.
In this paper, we designed and synthesized two 2D like low bandgap copolymers, PBTBD1 and PBTBD2 (Scheme 1), with novel 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptors modified by conjugated diphenylamine-vinylene side chains for efficient polymer solar cells. BT was chosen here as the parent acceptor skeleton because its derivatives were the most promising blocks for building high-performance polymeric donor materials. At present, almost all the work is focused on naked BT or alkyl and alkoxyl modified BT framework, however, some of the important properties of BT units modified by conjugated side chains have not been explored fully. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the prepared 2D like copolymers would have good photovoltaic properties.

NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and under a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were made on an CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an anhydrous nitrogen-saturated acetonitrile solution (0.1 mol L−1) of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4). The copolymers were coated on the platinum plate working electrodes from dilute chloroform solutions. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Carry 300 spectrophotometer. Polymer solar cells were fabricated with ITO glass as an anode, Ca/Al as a cathode and the film blend of the copolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the photosensitive layer. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a solution blend of the copolymer and PC71BM in chlorobenzene on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measurement system. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. The thickness of the films was measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer.

The synthetic route of the monomers and copolymers is outlined in Scheme 2. Using diphenylamine as a starting material, 4-formyl-N-dodecyldiphenylamine (2) was synthesized via the Vilsmeier reaction in a good yield. Bromination of 4,7-dibromo-5-methyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole with N-bromosuccimide (NBS) can easily afford 4,7-dibromo-5-bromomethyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (3), which was then reacted with triethyl phosphite to give phosphonic acid diethyl ester (4). At last, monomer 7 was synthesized via the Wittig–Horner reaction by the coupling of 4 and aromatic aldehyde 2. The copolymers were synthesized from organic tin monomers and bromide 7 by the Stille coupling reaction, using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 as catalysts. Crude copolymers were purified by extracting with methanol, hexane and chloroform in this order. The resulting copolymers were obtained by reprecipitation of the concentrated chloroform solution in methanol several times. The structures of the copolymers were confirmed with NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

These copolymers exhibit good solubility in organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, xylene and chlorobenzene. The weight-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent and polystyrene as the internal standard. Both PBTBD1 and PBTBD2 have high Mn values of 69.0 and 35.0 kg mol−1 with PDI values of 2.04 and 2.40, respectively. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the two polymers were not observed in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans. Decomposition onset temperatures (Td) (about 5% weight loss) were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to be 345 and 420 °C for PBTBD1 and PBTBD2, respectively. Obviously, the combinations of such good thermal properties are adequately suitable for avoiding the deformation and degradation of the polymeric active layer in PSCs.

The UV-vis absorption properties of the obtained copolymers were measured both in CHCl3 solutions (Fig. 1a) and thin films spin-coated on quartz slides (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1a, the copolymers in chloroform solutions showed broad absorptions ranging from 300 to 800 nm with three peaks at 334, 393, 508 nm and 335, 408, 512 nm for PBTBD1 and PBTBD2, respectively. The two peaks ranging from 300 and 450 nm were attributed to the absorption of the diphenylamine-vinylene side chains and the π–π* electronic transitions of the conjugated polymer backbones. Another absorption band from 450 to 800 nm was due to the intramolecular charge transfer transitions (ICT) between the donor segments and the acceptor moieties. Compared to PBTBD1, PBTBD2 showed slight red shifts, which were due to the increased conjugation length by the thiophene groups attached on the benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene unit. From Fig. 1a, the relative absorbance in the region of 300–450 nm also decreased with the reduction of conjugation. The same behavior was observed for the absorption spectra of the copolymer films as shown in Fig. 1b. As compared to their counterparts in the solution state, the broad peaks in the wavelength range of 450–900 nm showed different red-shifts of 100 and 101 nm for PBTBD1 and PBTBD2, respectively. The reason could be explained by the aggregation and strong interchain interactions between the conjugated main chains of the conjugated polymers in the solid state, which could facilitate charge transportation for photovoltaic applications. The energy bandgaps calculated from the absorption band edges of the optical absorption spectra were about 1.67 and 1.65 eV for PBTBD1 and PBTBD2, respectively. The results indicated that PBTBD2 had a smaller bandgap due to the stronger ICT effect than PBTBD1, which was useful to enhance the short circuit current (Jsc) in PSCs. Compared with the non-substituted benzothiadiazole based copolymers, the obtained bandgaps were smaller, which indicates enhanced absorption across the entire visible wavelength region was achieved by combination of diphenylamine-vinylene side chains on the BT skeleton, implying this strategy can be employed to develop efficient photovoltaic materials with improved properties.


The energy levels of the polymeric materials, including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments. The CV measurements were performed using a three-electrode cell in an anhydrous CH3CN solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4). A Pt plate coated with a thin film of the studied copolymer, a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the work electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.32 eV according to the previous methods. The electrochemical cell was purged with pure argon prior to each measurement. The scans toward the anodic and cathodic directions were performed separately at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. The reversible oxidation (p-doping) and reduction (n-doping) processes were observed, and the obtained curves of the copolymers were shown in Fig. 2. Both copolymers show predominant oxidation peaks due to the electron-donating benzodithiophene, thiophene and diphenylamine-vinylene segments and a slight reduction peak related to the electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit. From the onset potentials of the p-doping process, the HOMO energy levels were determined to be −5.15 and −5.13 eV for PBTBD1 and PBTBD2, respectively. On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.39 and −3.46 eV for PBTBD1 and PBTBD2 from the onset potentials of the cathodical sweep, respectively. Thus, the bandgaps (Eg) of PBTBD1 and PBTBD2 were calculated to be about 1.76 and 1.67 eV. The values and the changing trends are consistent with those obtained by the optical method above.


The optimal geometries and electronic structures of the conjugated copolymers were simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level on model compounds using the Gaussian 09 program suite. The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculations, which did not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries and the electronic properties. As shown in Fig. 3, the results indicated that the electron density of LUMO was mainly localized on the benzothiadiazole segment for BD-BT1 and BD-BT2. On the other hand, the electronic wavefunction of the HOMO was distributed almost entirely over the conjugated molecule, which was beneficial for obtaining a higher hole mobility. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BD-BT1 and BD-BT2 were calculated to be −4.94 eV, −2.55 eV and −4.89 eV, −2.53 eV, respectively. The bandgaps were determined to be 2.39 and 2.36 eV. Obviously, the trends in HOMOs, LUMOs and bandgaps were similar to those obtained by the CV and UV-vis measurements. The calculated values were somewhat different from the experimental data because of the part extended π-conjugation system or because just several repeating sections were chosen from the designed copolymers. However, the theoretical analysis is still important to provide direct insight into the interplay between their structural modifications and the resulting electronic and optical changes.


Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were made and investigated in a series of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al devices based on the blends of copolymer:PC71BM according to our previous work. Here, ITO (indium-tin oxide) glass spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS (poly(ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonic acid)) was used as an anode, Ca/Al as a cathode. PC71BM was used instead of PC61BM due to its significantly broader and stronger absorption in the visible region. The devices were optimized by changing some conditions, such as the ratio of the copolymer and PC71BM from 1:1 to 1:4, and the thickness of active layer. The best fabrication condition was obtained by spin-coating from a 10 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution of copolymer/PC71BM ratio of 1:3 (w/w). The optical thicknesses of polymeric blend films for both devices was about 80 nm. The photovoltaic results of these studies are depicted in Fig. 4. In addition, hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM (1:3)/Au were fabricated to evaluate the hole mobility in the blended films by space charge limited current (SCLC) method according to our previous work. The measured hole mobilities of PBTBD1:PC71BM and PBTBD2:PC71BM were 4.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.


Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for PSCs under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PBTBD1 and PBTBD2 devices show open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.95 and 0.90 V, short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of 5.11 and 5.23 mA cm−2, fill factors (FF) of 0.34 and 0.40, resulting in PCEs of 1.64% and 1.88%, respectively. The results indicated both devices had relatively high Voc of more than 0.9 V. To the best of our knowledge, 0.95 V is among the highest Voc values for PSCs based on BT-based polymers. It is known that the Voc is dependent on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor. The Voc of the PBTBD1 device is as expected to be higher than that of the PBTBD2 device due to the deeper HOMO energy level of PBTBD1. However, the lower Jsc of the PBTBD1 device results in the lower PCE, which may be attributed to the larger bandgap of 1.76 eV and relatively lower hole mobility compared to those of PBTBD2. To evaluate the accuracy of measurement, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of PSCs based on the polymeric blend with PC71BM (1:3) under monochromatic illumination were measured and shown in Fig. 4b. The shapes of the EQE curves of the devices are similar to their absorption spectra, indicating that the excitons are mainly generated in copolymer phases. As shown in Fig. 4b, the spectral responses of the two devices exhibited efficient photoresponses at wavelengths between 300 and 800 nm, with the maximum EQEs of 44% and 43% at around 500 nm. Since the EQE values are almost the same, the broader profile of the PBTBD2 results in a higher Jsc in the PBTBD2 device than that in the PBTBD1 devices.
Furthermore, an active film morphology with an ideal domain size of 10–20 nm in interpenetrating bicontinuous networks is important for achieving high-performance devices.Fig. 5 shows the AFM height and phase topographic images of the films of copolymer:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blends by tapping-mode. The root mean squares roughness (Ra) of the film blends based on PBTBD1 and PBTBD2 are 3.56 and 2.72, respectively. The observed morphologies imply the good miscibility between the copolymers and PC71BM. From the phase images, the polymer and fullerene domains were homogeneously distributed throughout the blend film with a nanometer-scale interpenetrating network. At the same the 1:3 blend ratio, the PBTBD1:PC71BM blend film showed a little larger phase separation, which would decrease the D–A interfacial areas and deteriorate the formation of bicontinuous interpenetrating networks. However, the PBTBD2:PC71BM film with a smoother surface would induce a better contact with the cathode and a reduced internal series resistance in PSCs. The improved film surface with nanoscaled texture benefits the internal light scattering and enhanced the light absorption, resulting in higher Jsc and FF in the PBTBD2 device relative to the PBTBD1 device. Compared to the efficiencies of other PSCs based on BDT and BT containing copolymers, the PCE values in this work are still relatively low. Considering the relatively low FF, there is big room for future improvement in the performance of PSCs based on the resulting copolymer–PCBM system. Further detailed studies of device optimization of thermal annealing, solvent/vapor annealing, the addition of solvent additives, as well as charge transfer and exciton separation and recombination are in progress.

In summary, a novel 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor with functional conjugated diphenylamine-vinylene side chains was firstly designed and synthesized for building efficient low bandgap photovoltaic copolymers. Two dimensional (2D) like donor–acceptor copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene and the new BT acceptor, PBTBD1 and PBTBD2, have been prepared by Stille coupling polymerization. These copolymers possess good solubility and thermal properties. UV-vis measurements indicated both copolymer thin films exhibited strong and broad absorption in the region from 300 nm to 900 nm, relatively low HOMO levels, which were beneficial for the stability and the increase of Voc of the fabricated PSCs. PBTBD2 had a better light harvest and smaller bandgap compared to PBTBD1. The electronic structures of model molecules were also studied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The PSCs based on these copolymers were fabricated and measured with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The results showed that PBTBD2 devices had a higher efficiency of 1.88% due to the improved Jsc and FF. The present results indicated that these copolymers with functional conjugated diphenylamine-vinylene side chains would be promising candidates for efficient PSCs with high Voc.
