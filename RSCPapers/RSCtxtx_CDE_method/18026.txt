A small amount of methylammonium in the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite precursor solution or on the perovskite surface is decomposed spontaneously, but this is very adverse for the preparation of high-quality MAPbI3 perovskite and devices in experiments. Herein, proton transfer between the CH3NH2 molecule and the cations (H5O2+, CH3OH2+, H2F+, and so on), as well as the properties of MAPbI3 perovskites with H5O2 super-alkalis, were studied systematically via high-throughput first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated results indicate that the cations with low deprotonation energy could spontaneously convert the highly volatile CH3NH2 molecule into MA+ both in the free (solution) form or on the perovskite surface, which strongly suggests that the decomposition of MA+ can be inhibited in the perovskite precursor solution or on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface by using easy-to-deprotonate cations to achieve the self-healing of the MAPbI3 perovskite. Moreover, the MAPbI3 perovskites with H5O2 super-alkalis showed negative formation energies, stable dynamics performances, tunable direct band gaps, small carrier effective masses, low exciton binding energies, and power conversion efficiencies over 28.70%. These findings suggest that preparing high-quality MAPbI3 perovskites and their devices may be feasible by using easy deprotonated cations as additives or surface-treatment agents.

Metal halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention as promising active layers in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and lasers due to their low cost, easy solution-based synthesis, benign defects, tunable components and band gaps, and other advantages. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the single-junction solar cells based on halide perovskites has reached 25.7%. The MAPbI3 perovskite, which is the prototype material of ABX3-type hybrid perovskites, shows poor thermal stability. One of the reasons for this is that the few MA+ cations spontaneously degrade into the highly volatile CH3NH2 molecule in the perovskite precursor solution or on the perovskite surface, which is very adverse for the preparation and stabilization of high-quality perovskites containing methylammonium cations and their devices.

To stabilize the MAPbI3 perovskite, cation engineering, i.e., using three cations, namely MA+, NH2CHNH2+ (FA+) and Cs+, at the A-site has been used in previous works. On the other hand, cations and molecules containing hydrogen atoms have been employed as additives to improve the film morphology, crystal quality and stability of the MAPbI3 perovskite. For instance, using a small amount of water as an additive improves perovskite film morphology, crystal quality and efficiency. The PCE of the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell could be improved from 18.7% to 20.1% by using 1-naphthylmethylamine. Moreover, self-healing of the MAPbI3 perovskite can be achieved by using H2O because MA+ decomposes into CH3NH2 and H+, which is then captured by H2O to form H3O+, further resulting in the reaction CH3NH2 + H3O+ → MA+ + H2O. The competing photochemical reactions of the formation and annihilation of lead vacancies and interstitial halogen defects have been observed under illumination in the previous report, which may suggest that the self-healing or stabilization of the MAPbI3 perovskite is related to controlling the competing photochemical reactions. Herein, we mainly focus on inhibiting the degradation of MA+ ions for MAPbI3 stabilization because this degradation has been observed under light or in solution. The other reason is that MA+ can stabilize the PbI3 frame of the MAPbI3 perovskite, and the loss of MA+ can accelerate perovskite degradation. Recently, some calculation results indicated that the halide perovskites with H5O2 super-alkali show stable dynamics and excellent optoelectronic properties, implying that cations containing hydrogen atoms may be doped to the halide perovskites. However, few only cations containing hydrogen atoms may inhibit the decomposition of free MA+ or MA+ on the perovskite surface. Moreover, occupying the A site holes of the hybrid perovskites or may not be possible using these cations. Obviously, by solving these problems, it is feasible to prepare high-quality MAPbI3 perovskites and their devices because the spontaneous decomposition of the few MA+ cations in the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution or on the perovskite surface is unavoidable. However, these problems have not been solved yet as we know.
To explore this, we chose cations with different deprotonation energies, such as H5O2+, (CH3)3NH+, NH4+, and LiOH2+. Then, we systematically studied the proton transfer between these cations and the CH3NH2 molecule, and the interaction between these cations and the CH3NH2 part in the (001) MAI plane of the MAPbI3 perovskite, as well as the dynamics property, electronic structure, carrier property and the PCE estimation of the MA−x(H5O2)xPbI3 (x = 0, 1/16, 1/8, 1/2, or 1) perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure by using the high-throughput ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and first-principles calculations. The calculation results show that the CH3NH2 molecule neither in the free form nor in the (001) MAI plane can be spontaneously transformed into the MA+ cation by the H3O+, H5O2+ H2F+, CH2OH+ or CH3OH2+ cations with a low deprotonation energy. However, converting spontaneously the CH3NH2 molecule into the MA+ cation using cations with higher deprotonation energy than MA+ is adverse. Moreover, the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites show stable dynamics, tunable direct band gaps, small hole and electron effective masses, and low exciton binding energies, as well as PCE over 28.70%.

The structures of the molecules and cations containing hydrogen atoms are shown in Fig. 1a. The proton affinities of the molecules and the vertical deprotonation energies of these cations were calculated using their free energies, as shown in Table S1 and Fig. 1b. The calculated proton affinities of Table S1 were consistent with the experimental values; for example, the calculated and experimental proton affinities of H5O2+ were 8.16 and 8.08 eV, respectively (see Table S1 or Fig. 1b). The vertical deprotonation energy of MA+ was 9.12 eV, which is significantly lower than that of FA+ (9.73 eV), suggesting that FA+ was not easily decomposed compared with MA+, further indicating that the FAPbI3 perovskite would show better thermal stability than the MAPbI3 perovskite.

To study the spontaneous conversion of the free CH3NH2 molecule to the MA+ cation using cations containing hydrogen atoms, the proton transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. 1c, d and S1. Barrier-free proton transfer from the H3O+/H5O2+ cations to the CH3NH2 molecule was observed, and then, the MA+ cation was obtained (see Fig. 1c and d) because the transition states were below the reactants in terms of energy; that is, the TS1 transition state at −0.73 eV was below that of the R1 reactant at 0 eV (see Fig. 1c). The results suggest that a small amount of water may improve the MAPbI3 perovskite film morphology and crystal quality, which offers a new understanding of the phenomena reported previously because H3O+ and H5O2+ have been observed in liquid water. More energy was released from R1 to P1 than that from R2 to P2 (see Fig. 1c and d) because decomposing the H5O2+ cation into an H3O+ cation and an H2O molecule needs the energy of 1.18 eV (see Fig. S1a). Moreover, the proton could also be transferred spontaneously from H2F+, CH3OH2+, or CH2OH+ to the free CH3NH2 molecule to form the MA+ cation due to the lower free energy of the products than that of the reactants (see Fig. S1d–f). However, the proton transfer from NH4+ or (CH3)3NH+ to the free CH3NH2 molecule was not spontaneous due to the lower energy of the reactants than that of the products (see Fig. S1b and c) and their big vertical deprotonation energy (see Table S1). In all, proton transfer from these cations to the free CH3NH2 molecule can be summarized by the reaction RH+ + CH3NH2 → MA+ + R, where RH+ and R are the cation with a low vertical deprotonation energy and the molecule with low proton affinity, respectively.
To explore that the conversion of the CH3NH2 molecule on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface to the MA+ cation can also be spontaneous while using the cations with low vertical deprotonation energies, the spontaneous conversion of CH3NH2 to MA+ was systematically studied on the (001) MAI plane of the MAPbI3 perovskite. As shown in Fig. S2 and Movie.zip, the MA+ cation was spontaneously obtained because of the spontaneous proton transfer from the cations (such as H5O2+, H2F+, CH2OH+, and so on) to the CH3NH2 on the MAPbI3 perovskite surface. Herein, we noted that spontaneous proton transfer did not occur from the (CH3)3NH+/NH4+ cations to the free CH3NH2 molecule (see Fig. S1b and c). To explore the reason, the binding energy of the hydrogen atom (EHb) of the free or bound CH3NH2 molecule was calculated as EHb = EH + Ecation − Em, where EH, Ecation and Em are the total energy of the single hydrogen atom, single cation, and single CH3NH2 molecule/the MAPbI3 perovskite with the (001) MAI plane with CH3NH2, respectively. The EHb values 1.34 and 5.55 eV were obtained for the free CH3NH2 molecule and the (001) MAI plane with CH3NH2, respectively. The results show that the protons of the cations were very easily transferred to the CH3NH2 on the MAI plane, suggesting that the CH3NH2 embedded on the MAI plane can be converted spontaneously into the MA+ cation by cations containing hydrogen atoms and further indicating that the lone-pair electrons on the N atom of the CH3NH2 embedded on the MAI plane have higher proton affinity than that of the free CH3NH2 molecule. This spontaneous proton transfer can be described by the reaction RH+ + Plane-CH3NH2 → Plane-MA+ + R. The above results suggest that using cations that can be easily deprotonated than the MA+ cation can facilitate the transformation of the free or MAPbI3 perovskite-plane-embedded CH3NH2 to the MA+ cation, indicating that it is profitable to use such cations as additives for preparing high-quality MAPbI3 perovskites and their devices. As previous reports, I2 vapor-induced degradation can be observed for perovskite solar cells under heat-light soaking conditions, which suggests that the additives should be composed of the easy deprotonated cations and the halogen/superhalogen anions, such as Br−, Cl−, BF4−, ClO4−, PF6−, and so on. The additive materials, such as H5O2+ClO4− (CH3)3NHCl, [H5O2]BF4, H3OBF4 crystals, and so on, can inhibit the degradation of MA+ and occupy the iodine vacancies in theory, suggesting that they may be effective in solution or the surface treatment.
To further explore whether the occupation of the A site holes by these cations influences the photoelectric properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite, we chose the H5O2+ cation according to the restriction of the tolerance factor in the 0.8–1.0 range. The ion radii of 1.87, 2.38, 1.19, and 2.20 Å were employed for H5O2+, MA+, Pb2+ and I−, respectively. The tolerance factor (t) of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskite was estimated using the equation , where Ry is the radius of the y ion. Tolerance factors from 0.85 to 0.96 were obtained as the value of x reduced in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites, suggesting that they are the formed perovskite. The previous works also indicate that the H5O2+ cation can be implanted successfully in lead halide perovskites. The lowest energy structures of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure are shown in Fig. 2a–e, respectively. All possible structures and the relative energies of the MA0.875(H5O2)0.125PbI3 perovskite are shown in Fig. S3. As x is increased in MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3, the negative formation energies also increased from −3.92 to −3.76 eV (Fig. 2f), indicating that the formation of these perovskites was thermodynamically feasible, but it became increasingly difficult with the increase of x during crystallization, further suggesting that the existence of a small (rather than large) number of H2O molecules makes it possible to obtain high-quality MAPbI3 perovskites, which is also consistent with the conclusion of previous experimental work. The negative formation energies show that the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites were formed.
To estimate the dynamics of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites, their AIMD simulation results are shown in Fig. 3 and S4. Small oscillations were observed in their energy, temperature, and lattice parameter change curves after AIMD simulation for 1 ps (see Fig. 3 and S4). As shown in the top and side views in Fig. 3 and S4, the H5O2+ and MA+ cations were not agglomerated, and the phase transition or structural collapse of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites was not observed, suggesting that they exhibit stable dynamics performance. To further explore the interaction between the H5O2+/MA+ cations and I atoms, the calculations of the hydrogen bond energy (EH-bond) in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure and a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell were executed using the equation,EH-bond = (Et−Et′)/16, where Et = xEH5O2+ + (1−x)EMA+ + EPbI3− − EMA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3, Et′ = E+Cs + EPbI3− − ECsPbI3, and 16 is the number of A-site cations in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites. Et and Et′ represent the electrostatic interaction energy between H5O2+/MA+ and PbI−3 in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites and that between Cs+ and PbI−3 in the CsPbI3 perovskite, respectively. For the CsPbI3 perovskite, herein, the structure was obtained from the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites by replacing H5O2 and MA with Cs. EH5O2+, EMA+, EPbI3−, EMA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 and ECsPbI3 represent the total energies of H5O2+, MA+, PbI3−, MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 and CsPbI3, respectively. As shown in Table S2, the hydrogen bond energy of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites was positive, suggesting that the H5O2+ and MA+ cations were bound to the PbI3 frame, which forbade the agglomeration of the A site cations. The hydrogen bond energy of 0.31 eV/A-site-cation was obtained for the MAPbI3 perovskite with a tetragonal crystal structure and a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell, which is consistent with the previous report. Based on the AIMD simulation and the calculation of the formation energy and hydrogen bond energy, the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites show stable thermodynamics and kinetics properties, further suggesting that the H5O2+ cations were successfully doped into the MAPbI3 perovskite with a tetragonal crystal structure.
To explore the change of the electronic structures of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites with an increase in x, the band structures and density of states (DOSs) were calculated, as shown in Fig. 4 and S5. The DOSs near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) were contributed mainly by the Pb 6p orbitals and I 5p orbitals and a little by the Pb 6s orbitals, respectively. The DOSs of the MA and H5O2 parts were far away from the band edge. The DOS results suggest that the optical transition types, i.e., strong s–p and p–p transitions, were retained with increasing x in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites. A band gap of 1.61 eV was obtained for the MAPbI3 perovskite with a tetragonal crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 4a, which is consistent with the band gaps obtained in previous works. With the increase in x, the band gaps could be tuned from 1.55 to 1.72 eV for the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites (see Fig. 4 and S5), resulting in the weakened light absorption with the introduction over two H5O2+ cations in the MAPbI3 perovskite with a tetragonal crystal structure and a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell.
As we know, the quantitative estimation of the effective carrier masses and exciton binding energy, as well as the partial charge densities of the CBM and VBM states related to the generation and transportation of the electron–hole pairs, influences the performance prediction of the photoelectric devices based the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites. Fig. 5a shows the small effective carrier masses in these perovskites. As x was increased in MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3, the hole and electron effective masses could be tuned from 0.24 me to 0.29 me and 0.17 me to 0.21 me, respectively. The exciton binding energy ranged from 43.03 to 54.32 meV with the increase in x, as shown in Fig. 5b, suggesting that the electron–hole pairs in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites were easily separated for carrier transportation. Fig. 5c shows the CBM and VBM charge densities mainly spreading over the Pb and I atoms of the MA0.9375(H5O2)0.0625PbI3 perovskite, respectively. Other MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites had a similar distribution of the partial charge densities of the CBM and VBM states, as shown in Fig. S6. The results of the partial charge density also suggest that the electron–hole pairs can be easily separated and transported in the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites. The above results show that these perovskites have excellent light absorption capability and superior carrier transportation, suggesting that they can be used as excellent light-absorbing materials in solar cells. The PCEs of the single junction solar cells based on these perovskites were estimated, and their PCEs as the function of the bandgap are shown in Fig. 5e, whereas all the calculated parameters of the single junction solar cells based on the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites are shown in Table S2. The highest PCE of 31.50% was obtained for the MA0.9375(H5O2)0.0625PbI3 perovskite solar cell (see Table S2) due to the direct bandgap of 1.55 eV and superior carrier performance. The H5O2PbI3 perovskite solar cell showed a high open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V because of the direct bandgap of 1.72 eV. The PCEs of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskite single junction solar cells could be tuned from 28.73% to 31.50% by adjusting x because the bandgap of the MAPbI3 perovskite with a tetragonal crystal structure can be tuned by varying the doping amount of H5O2+ cations. The PCE results show that the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites are excellent light-absorbing materials; therefore, the model of the single-junction solar cells based on these perovskites is shown in Fig. 5f.

In summary, we systematically studied proton transfer between cations containing hydrogen atoms and the CH3NH2 molecule. Moreover, the thermodynamic properties, electronic structures and PCEs of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure were also explored. The calculation results show that the CH3NH2 molecules in the free state or on the MAI plane can be spontaneously converted into MA+ cations by using cations that are more easily deprotonated than MA+ cations. A small amount of H5O2+ cations can be implanted into the three-dimensional MAPbI3 perovskite with a tetragonal crystal structure because of the negative formation energy and the stable dynamics properties. The MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites have negative formation energies, stable dynamics properties, tunable direct bandgaps from 1.55 to 1.72 eV, electron and hole effective masses below 0.29 me, and exciton binding energies below 54.32 meV. Calculated power conversion efficiencies over 28.70% were obtained for the single-junction solar cells based on the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure.


The ground states of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 (x = 0, 1/16, 1/8, 1/2, or 1) perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure and a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell were obtained using the projected augmented wave (PAW) method and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) implanted in the VASP code during geometrical optimizations, wherein the lattice parameters from previous work were used for obtaining the accurate bandgap. These perovskites had 192, 191, 190, 184 and 176 atoms for x = 0, 1/16, 1/8, 1/2 and 1, respectively. The interaction between the H5O2+/MA+ cations and the PbI3 framework was evaluated using the non-local van der Waals (vdW) interactions with Grimmer's DFT + D2 correction. Atomic force below 0.02 eV Å−1 and the cutoff energy of 520 eV were set in the SCF cycle. These parameters were used for the geometrical optimization of the (001) plane of the MAPbI3 perovskite with the H2F+, CH2OH+, H3O+, or H5O2+ cations. To construct the PAW potentials, we adopted the valence states of H (1s1), C (2s22p2), N (2s22p3), O (2s22p4), F (2s22p5), I (5s25p5) and Pb (6s26p2). Moreover, the 2 × 2 × 2 k-point was used for Monkhorst–Pack sampling during geometrical optimization and electronic structure calculations. To well-estimate the reaction, the free energies of the cations, molecules and transition states were calculated using the DFT method implanted in the Gaussian 09 software, and b3lyp/6-311++g(3df,3pd) was employed. The QST2 (QST3) method was used to find the transition states. Moreover, all vibrational frequency analyses were implemented to ensure geometrically optimized structures without any imaginary frequency and transition structures with only one imaginary frequency.


The AIMD simulations were performed with the NpT ensemble of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites using VASP codes with the PAW method and PBE-GGA including vdW correction. ISIF = 3 was set for all perovskites to allow changes in the lattice parameters, and the constant pressure and temperature were calculated using a Langevin thermostat with Parrinello-Rahman dynamics. We used the time step of 1 fs and collected atomic trajectory data every 10 fs after the AIMD simulation of 5 ps. Moreover, 300 K and 105 Pa were set as the temperature and external pressure in the simulation, respectively. Other parameters were consistent with those of the geometrical optimizations.


The formation energy (Ef) of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites with a tetragonal crystal structure and a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell was defined as Ef = [Et − 16[xEH5O2 − (1−x)ECH3NH3] − 8EI2 − 16EPbI2]/16, where Et, EH5O2, ECH3NH3, EI2, and EPbI2 are the total energies of the perovskites, single H5O2, single MA, single I2 molecule, and the PbI2 bulk with a unit cell, respectively. 16 is the total number of Pb atoms. The electron and hole effective masses (m*) of the perovskites were calculated as , where ε(k), ℏ, and k are the energy eigenvalue, the reduced Planck constant, and the wave vector, respectively. The k values were set from 0 to 0.01 Bohr using the finite difference method for the calculation of the effective masses. The exciton binding energy was calculated using the equation,
, where
ε0 and εs represent the electron effective mass, hole effective mass, dielectric constant in vacuum, and static dielectric constant considering local field effects, respectively.


The open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), the maximum short-circuit current density (Jsc), and PCE (η) of the single-junction perovskite solar cells were calculated using the bandgaps of the MA1−x(H5O2)xPbI3 perovskites. Herein, the detailed balance limit from the previous work was used to obtain the maximum estimation of PCEs. Moreover, the assumption that a photon can be absorbed totally when its energy is higher than Eg and consequently an electron–hole pair is generated, was used. The parameters of the single-junction perovskite solar cells were calculated using the equations,,  and , where e, S(E) and E are the electronic charge, radiant energy per unit area and incident photon energy, respectively. Ps was obtained using the solar spectrum data offered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
