We report a detailed comparison of absorption spectroscopy, electrochemistry, DFT calculations, field-effect charge mobility, as well as organic photovoltaic characteristics between thiophene- and selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor low-band-gap copolymers. In these copolymers, a significant reduction of the band-gap energy was observed for selenophene-bridged copolymers by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Field-effect charge mobility studies reveal that the enhanced hole mobility of the selenophene-bridged copolymers hinges on the solubilising alkyl side chain of the copolymers. Both cyclic voltammetry experiments and theoretical calculations showed that the decreased band-gap energy is mainly due to the lowering of the LUMO energy level, and the raising of the HOMO energy level is just a secondary cause. These results are reflected in a significant increase of the short circuit current density (JSC) but a slight decrease of the open circuit voltage (VOC) of their bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPVs), of which the electron donor materials are a selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymer: poly{9-dodecyl-9H-carbazole-alt-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(selenophen-2-yl) benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole} (pCzSe) or poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(selenophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole} (pBDTSe), or a thiophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymer: poly{9-dodecyl-9H-carbazole-alt-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole} (pCzS) or poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole} (pBDTS); the electron acceptor material is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Judging from our device data, the potential Se–Se interactions of the selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymers, which is presumably beneficial for the fill factor (FF) of BHJ OPVs, is rather susceptible to the device fabrication conditions.

In the last two decades, polymer-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted intensive studies in both academy and industry due to their potential value in the global solar energy market. The so-called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) has been proven to be the most successful device structure for OPVs so far. Using π-conjugated polymers as the electron donors and soluble fullerene (such as PCBM) as the electron acceptor is most common in BHJ OPVs. Many recent research activities have focused on improving polymer donor materials toward low band-gap energy (Eg), the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels. Low band-gap polymers have an advantage of more light harvesting of influx photons in matching the solar spectrum and hence a larger short-circuit current density (JSC) of OPVs. On the other hand, the low lying HOMO energy level of the polymer donor material is important to keep the high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of OPVs. Many experimental or theoretical studies have demonstrated that there is a linear relation between the VOC and the energy difference between the LUMO level of the electron accepting material and the HOMO level of the electron donating material. It is not uncommon that a conflicting situation may take place in optimizing the JSC and VOC of OPVs, if the small Eg of the electron donating polymer material is managed by elevating its HOMO level. Here, we want to report that replacing the thiophene π-conjugated bridge of the donor–acceptor copolymers with selenophene is an effective approach to increase JSC without the comprise of much VOC of BHJ OPVs.

Thiophene-containing polymers are among the best investigated materials as electron donors in BHJ OPVs due to their π-conjugated character and incredible synthetic versatility. The current state-of-the-art thiophene-containing polymers utilized in BHJ OPVs as electron donors have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 7%. Selenophene is the chalcogenophene homologue with chemical and physical properties similar to those of thiophene. Several possible advantages of selenophene over thiophene would be expected for application in organic electronics. For examples, increased conductivity of organic conductors has been found by the replacement of the sulfur atom by the selenium atom, such as tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetraselenafulvalene (TSF) derivatives. This is due to the intermolecular Se–Se interactions, which would facilitate intermolecular charge transfer. Similarly, it has been shown that selenophene-based polymers have better conductivity and charge mobility than thiophene-based polymers due to the larger π-overlap of the larger π-orbitals of selenium atoms. Furthermore, both theoretical studies and experimental evidence indicate that selenophene-based polymers have a lower Eg. This is due to the more pronounced quinoidal character found for selenophene than thiophene, which facilitates the π-conjugated connection to other structural moieties, and hence lengthens the π-conjugation along the polymer chain. Since the ionization potential of oligoselenophenes is around 4.6 eV, which is only 0.05 eV lower than the calculated ionization potential for oligothiophenes, it is not enough to account for the 0.18 eV difference of Eg. In other words, the heteroatom of the polychalcogenophene alters the energy level of the material more on the LUMO than the HOMO.
Various thiophene- or selenophene-containing materials, including small molecules, oligomers, and polymers, have been synthesized for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and similar or enhanced charge mobility has been observed for most selenophene-containing materials. However, materials containing selenophene designed for light harvesting are still rare. Just a couple of reports regarding thiophene- and selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymers used for BHJ OPVs have been published very recently. In this work, a series of thiophene- and selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor low band-gap copolymers have been designed and synthesized. Two different electron donor moieties, carbazole and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, were chosen to combine with a common acceptor moiety, benzo[c][1,2,5]benzothiadiazole, resulting in two pairs of copolymer couples pCzS–pCzSe and pBDTS–pBDTSe (see Fig. 1). A detailed comparison of absorption spectroscopy, electrochemistry, DFT calculations, field-effect charge mobility, as well as the OPV characteristics between these thiophene- and selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymers is presented herein.

In order to obtain high molecular weight copolymers with good solubility, all monomers, Cz, BDT, BTS, and BTSe (Scheme 1), were anchored with long and/or branched solubilizing alkyl chains in their designs. One kind of alkyl chain and two kinds of alkoxy substituent were utilized in the electron-donating and electron-accepting units, and they are N-dodecylcarbazole, 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, and 5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole.

With incorporation of a thiophene or selenophene spacer in these copolymers, steric hindrance between the side chains of the donor and acceptor monomers, which is more pronounced between benzene-based monomers such as carbazoles (Cz) and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazoles (BT), can be minimized. This minimized steric hindrance, enabling a more planar and extended π-conjugation, and thus a smaller band-gap energy.
The synthetic procedure for the corresponding monomers used in the polymerization reaction is shown in Scheme 2. For the Cz electron donating monomer, the boron ester group was functionalized at the 2- and 7-positions of carbazole in order to extend the electron π-conjugation of the polymer and it (compound 1) was synthesized from 4,4′-dibromo-1,1′-biphenyl according to the reported procedures. For another electron donating monomer, BDT, it was synthesized from compound 2 and the trimethyltin attachment was readily achieved according to reported procedures. Two solubilising dodecyloxyl chains attached to the electron-accepting BT unit were in place from the very beginning of the BT synthesis and the detailed synthetic procedures can be found in the literature reported by Janssen et al. In our synthetic design, the π-conjugating bridge, thiophene or selenophene, was first attached to the electron-accepting BT unit instead of the electron-donating unit. They were synthesized from 2-stannylated thiophene or 2-stannylated selenophene by a Stille cross-coupling reaction with compound 3 to give 4S and 4Se, which were then subjected to bromination to afford BTS and BTSe, respectively.
Copolymers were prepared by conventional Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling with high isolated yields of 87–93% (Scheme 1). For the copolymers pCzS and pCzSe, the polymerization reaction was readily achieved by Suzuki cross-coupling. For the copolymers pBDTS and pBDTSe, the Stille cross-coupling reaction was chosen to facilitate the copolymerization between BTS or BTSe and BDT. All four copolymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with a washing solvent sequence of methanol, hexane, and finally chloroform. The copolymers pCzS, pCzSe, pBDTS, and pBDTSe are readily dissolved in common organic solvents like chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzne at room temperature.


Table 1 summarizes the characterization results of all copolymers prepared herein. All copolymers exhibit high polymerization yields (87–93%) and high molecular weights (Mw = 94.1–112.3 kg mol−1), even after a series of Soxhlet solvent purifications. This can be attributed to their good solubility by adding long and branched alkyl chains both on the donor and acceptor moiety of the copolymers. It has been reported in the literature that solubilizing alkyl chains have a very significant influence on the polymerization yields and molecular weights of donor–acceptor copolymers. Heteroatom substitution on these donor–acceptor copolymers only slightly affects the polymerization yields and molecular weights, which is due to the same polymer backbone being shared by the S- and Se-containing copolymers. All copolymers have thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) over 300 °C (Fig. 2), indicating the good thermal stability of these copolymers. In addition, it can be found that similar Td values were observed for copolymers with the same polymer backbone (pCzSvs.pCzSe or pBDTSvs.pBDTSe). We ascribe this to the thermal decomposition starting with the soft part (alkyl chains) of the copolymers, which is the same for the same type of copolymer.

Both UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were significantly affected by the heteroatom substitution of these copolymers (Fig. 3 and 4). Either in solution or as thin film, an obvious red-shifted UV-visible absorption was observed for pCzSe or pBDTSe compared with pCzS or pBDTS, respectively. Such red-shifted absorption happens to both absorption bands at short and long wavelengths, 390–440 and 530–645 nm, respectively. The detailed spectroscopic data are summarized in Table 2.

Vision-wise, these four copolymers are highly colorful and they are quite distinctive from each other (Fig. 3). Owing to the aggregation between copolymer chains in the solid state, both pCzS–pCzSe and pBDTS–pBDTSe couples exhibit a red-shifted absorption in their thin film states compared with their dilute chloroform solutions.
Their Eg values were calculated from the onset absorption edge of the thin film samples. pCzSe (Eg = 1.86 eV) exhibits a reduced band-gap energy of 0.1 eV when compared with that of pCzS (Eg = 1.96 eV). The same reduced band-gap energy was observed for pBDTS (Eg = 1.81 eV) and pBDTSe (Eg = 1.71 eV) as well. This result demonstrates a similar effect of narrowing band-gap energy in the two types of donor–acceptor copolymer when the thiophene π-conjugation bridge between the donor and acceptor moieties is replaced by selenophene. The reduction of the band-gap energy can be mainly attributed to the more electron rich and more quinoidal character of selenophene than thiophene. Polymers with a smaller band-gap energy are advantageous for sunlight harvesting of OPVs.

The energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) of the electron donating material are crucial parameters governing the overall performance of BHJ OPVs. The HOMO of the electron donating material is closely related to the VOC of BHJ OPVs. On the other hand, the LUMO–LUMO energy offset (at least 0.3 eV for P3HT exciton) between the donor and acceptor materials is responsible for the dissociation of excitons, which enables the passing of the electron from donor to acceptor and sustaining the JSC of BHJ OPVs. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to analyze the impact of heteroatom substitution on the energy levels of the donor–acceptor copolymers. Fig. 5 shows electrochemical cyclic voltammograms of the copolymer couples pCzS–pCzSe and pBDTS–pBDTSe. For all copolymers, both oxidation and reduction potentials were measured separately and were estimated from their onset potentials in the cyclic voltammograms. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from their onset potentials using the ferrocene–ferrocenium redox couple (0.4 V vs. Ag–Ag+ in the study herein) as the reference to vacuum level (4.8 eV).

As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3, the selenium-containing copolymers (pCzSe and pBDTSe) are oxidized slightly easier than their sulfur analogues (pCzS and pBDTS) by 0.04 and 0.03 V, respectively. On the other hand, a greater decrease of reduction potential (0.06 and 0.07 V) was observed for pCzS–pCzSe and pBDTS–pBDTSe, respectively. These results show that the substitution of sulfur with selenium in these donor–acceptor copolymers has a more significant impact on the LUMO than the HOMO energy level. Therefore, lowering the LUMO energy level of these copolymers is the major cause of the reduction of band-gap energy with the change of heteroatom (S to Se). In addition, the difference in band-gap energy acquired from electrochemical measurements for sulfur- and selenium-containing copolymers is 0.10 eV for both copolymer couples, which is consistent with that obtained from the optical band-gap. This also demonstrates the same magnitude of band-gap energy reduction happens to both copolymers when the bridged thiophene is replaced by selenophene. However, a disparity was observed for the band-gap energy measured from spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. This is due to the energy barrier at the interface between the polymer thin film and the electrode surface. Also, the difference can be ascribed to the exciton binding energy that differentiates the transport band-gap (electrochemical method) and optical band-gap (spectroscopic method).

Both spectroscopic and electrochemical methods showed a meaningful reduction of Eg for the selenophene-bridged copolymers. Thiophene and selenophene mainly play a role as a “π-conjugation bridge” in extending π-conjugation and eliminating steric hindrance in these donor–acceptor copolymers. The extension of π-conjugation and elimination of steric hindrance decrease Eg, and the magnitude of the decreased Eg is closely related to the quinoidal character of the bridging moiety along the donor–acceptor copolymer chain. According to the estimated aromatic stabilization energy (ASE), which is 18.6 and 16.7 kcal mol−1 for thiophene and selenophene, respectively, it is consistent with the fact that there is a more quinoidal character in selenophene- than in thiophene-containing copolymers.
Heeney et al. have reported that poly(3-hexylselenophene) (P3HS) shows a reduction in Eg when compared with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), principally due to the lowering of the polymer LUMO, with the HOMO being almost unaffected. Based on a computational study of P3HT, it has been reported that the HOMO of thiophene-based polymers has no orbital coefficient on the sulphur heteroatom, whilst the LUMO has a significant contribution from the sulphur heteroatom. Although P3HT and P3HS are not donor–acceptor type copolymers like those studied herein, computational studies have also been found to be adequate for probing the electron density distribution of the HOMO–LUMO in donor–acceptor π-conjugated copolymers. Therefore, it the following section, the influence of heteroatom substitution on the HOMO–LUMO of these copolymers is investigated by a computational study in order to get an in-depth understanding of the relationship between Eg and the HOMO–LUMO of pCzS–pCzSe and pBDTS–pBDTSe copolymers.

A theoretical model of D–π–A–π–D–π–A–π, a dimer-like (D–π–A–π)2 segment, is set up for the computational study due to its resemblance to the copolymer structure and its computational simplicity as well. In simulating the copolymer chain structure, the centered donor (D) or acceptor (A) are connected to each other, or peripheral A and D, respectively, through a π-conjugation bridge, either thiophene or selenophene. In addition, we limit the long alkyl chains of the copolymer to ethyl groups for computational simplicity. The replacement of long alkyl chains with shorter ones does not affect the optimized structure of the π-conjugated molecules but speeds up the computational process significantly. The experimental details of the computational method are described in the ESI.


Table 3 summarizes the calculation results of the dimer-like model of copolymers and the comparisons with experimental data. Although the predicted energy levels of these copolymers are not quite the same as those obtained from experimental CV data, certain correlations between the experimental results and theoretical calculations are found to be consistent with each other. For instances, DFT accurately predicts deeper lying HOMO levels and a larger Eg for the sulphur-containing copolymers (pCzS and pBDTS) compared to the selenium-containing ones (pCzSe and pBDTSe). Moreover, DFT predicts that the replacement of sulphur by selenium in these donor–acceptor copolymers has a more significant impact on the LUMO than the HOMO energy level. Specifically, the heteroatom Se substitution results in an increase of the HOMO energy levels of 0.02 and 0.03 eV for the pCzS–pCzSe and pBDTS–pBDTSe couples, respectively, which are much smaller than the 0.06 and 0.09 eV lowering of the LUMO energy levels, respectively. This computational result provides further confirmation of the influence of the heteroatom substitution on the HOMO–LUMO energy levels found by experimental methods.
The distinct electronic influence of heteroatom substitution on the HOMO and LUMO of these copolymers can be observed from their electron density distribution in the π-conjugated copolymers. As shown in Fig. 6, it can be clearly seen that the HOMO electron density mostly spans over the central π–A–π–D–π moiety, except the heteroatom sulphur (yellow color) of thiophene or selenium (orange color) of selenophene on the π-conjugation bridge. There is an electron density nodal plane across the sulphur of thiophene or selenium of selenophene. Such an electron density nodal plane accounts for the small HOMO energy level difference between the thiophene- and selenophene-bridged copolymers. On the other hand, the electron density of the LUMO is mainly concentrated on π–A–π on the left-hand side, and π–A–π on the right-hand side of the D–π–A–π–D–π–A–π model structure shown in Fig. 6. Different from those of the HOMO, most of the sulphur atoms in thiophene or selenium atoms in selenophene are covered by electron density in the LUMO of all four model structures. Our computational results indicate that the heteroatom of the π-conjugation bridge thiophene or selenophene plays a more significant role in the LUMO than in the HOMO of these donor–acceptor π-conjugated copolymers. These data also suggest that the thiophene–selenophene spacer behaves like a part of the acceptor unit, in addition to just a simple π-conjugation extending unit. Our computational results provide insight into the origin of reducing Eg for selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymers. Basically, our computational results are similar to what was found for P3HT and P3HS previously, although P3HT and P3HS are not donor–acceptor copolymers like the four copolymers studied herein.

To understand the influence of the heteroatom substitution on the charge transporting properties of the materials, the charge mobility characteristics of these sulphur- and selenium-containing copolymers were examined in their organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The detailed fabrication process and testing of the bottom-gate, top-contact copolymer OFETs can be found in the Experimental section. The current–voltage output and transfer characteristics of the four copolymer OFETs can be found in the ESI. The copolymer OFET testing results indicate that all four copolymers are hole transporting with no sign of electron transport, although the electrical characterization of the OFETs was conducted in an ambient air environment. From the data summarized in Table 4, the OFETs based on pCzSe show an average hole mobility (μavg) of 9.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of pCzS (μavg = 8.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, pBDTSe exhibits a hole mobility of 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable with or somewhat smaller than that of pBDTS (μavg = 6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

The enhanced mobility in pCzSe-based OFETs may be attributed to the increased inter-polymer chain contact by Se–Se interactions. Similar Se–Se interactions are somehow inhibited due to the more sterically demanding 2-ethylhexyl side chains that prevent the pBDTSe copolymer chain from close contact. Our inference above is consistent with the fact that branched alkyl side chains (such as 2-ethylhexyl) are better than longer but linear alkyl side chains (such as dodecyl) in enhancing polymer solubility.

The comparison of thiophene and selenophene-bridged low band-gap donor–acceptor copolymers applied for BHJ OPVs is presented in this section. These copolymers are designed to function as electron donors and PCBM is employed as the electron acceptor. Fine-tuning the thickness of the active layer is necessary in the performance optimization of BHJ OPVs. Although it is advantageous for light absorption by increasing the thickness of the active layer, the optimum active layer thickness is limited by the low charge carrier mobility and short diffusion length or lifetime of photo-generated excitons in organic materials. In order to achieve a fair comparison between the thiophene- and selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymers in BHJ OPVs, devices were fabricated with varied concentrations and spin-coating rates to achieve the optimal thickness.


Table 5 summarizes the photovoltaic results of S- and Se-based BHJ OPVs fabricated under different conditions, and some of the results are displayed in Fig. 7. It can be clearly seen that the OPVs based on Se-containing copolymers (pCzSe and pBDTSe) exhibit significantly higher JSC than those of the S-containing copolymers (pCzS and pBDTS). For examples, a maximum JSC of 9.54 mA cm−2 can be achieved for pCzSe (device Se5), which is significantly larger than the maximum JSC that can be obtained for pCzS (6.66 mA cm−2, device S2). A similar trend in JSC can also be found between the pBDTS (maximum JSC = 7.38 mA m−2, device S10) and pBDTSe (maximum JSC = 8.62 mA m−2, device Se10) OPVs. Furthermore, the magnitude of the enhanced JSC of the pCzSe–pCzS couple is higher than that of the pBDTSe–pBDTS couple. This can be explained by the much increased hole mobility of the pCzSe–pCzS couple than the pBDTSe–pBDTS couple. It is known that the hole mobility of the donor polymer is responsible for the transportation of positive charges (holes) dissociated from excitons. Hence, the enhanced JSC values of the pCzSe OPVs are not only due to increased sunlight absorption, but also due to the increased charge transport ability of the pCzSe copolymer.

The higher JSC for the selenophene-containing OPVs can be attributed to their longer absorption wavelength, i.e., more influx photons from the solar simulator are absorbed in the selenophene-containing OPVs compared with the thiophene-containing OPVs. Such higher JSC values also get verified from their incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. As shown in the bottom part of Fig. 7, the Se-based copolymers (pCzSe and pBDTSe) exhibit broader photocurrent wavelengths and/or more enhanced photocurrents relative to the S-based copolymers (pCzS and pBDTS).
Regarding diffusion and dissociation of copolymer-based excitons, wavelength dependent IPCE reveals insightful information. The photocurrent contribution from the second absorption band around 420–430 nm of pCzSe is very pronounced, surpassing the photocurrent contribution from the first absorption band at longer wavelengths of 500–600 nm. A similar enhanced IPCE can be found for the second absorption band around 410–420 nm of pBDTSe. Such wavelength dependent IPCE enhancement is not proportional to the absorption intensity at the long and short wavelength of pCzSe or pBDTSe shown in Fig. 3. Since such IPCE enhancement at the second absorption band does not happen to pCzS or pBDTS, we may make the following two inferences. Firstly, the excitons generated in the selenophene–π-conjugation bridged copolymers, particularly with the second absorption wavelength 410–430 nm, may be more readily separated into electrons and holes than the thiophene–π-conjugation bridged ones. Secondly, the short wavelength-generated excitons of pCzSe or pBDTSe may be more efficient for exciton diffusion than the longer wavelength-generated excitons of the respective copolymer. Our two inferences are directly derived from the fundamental principle of IPCE, also known as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OPVs, documented in the literature.
Concerning the HOMO energy level of the copolymers and the VOC of the OPVs, the correlation among the four copolymers studied herein is rather clear. For most of the device data listed in Table 5, the VOC of the thiophene-bridged copolymer OPVs is slightly larger than those of the selenophene-bridged copolymer OPVs. This is in general consistent with the thiophene-bridged copolymers having slightly deeper HOMO energy levels, as determined experimentally. With the results obtained herein, it is fair to say that there is an advantage of selenophene rather than thiophene in donor–acceptor copolymer BHJ OPVs, i.e., what it gains from increased JSC is more than what it loses from decreased VOC.
For the fill factor (FF) aspect of OPVs, it seems to be more sensitive to the device fabrication conditions than the effect of heteroatom substitution of the copolymers studied herein. Most selenophene-bridge-containing OPVs exhibit slightly lower FF values than the thiophene-bridge-containing OPVs when the devices are fabricated under similar conditions, for example, device S2-6 vs. Se2-6 or device S7-11 vs. Se7-11 in Table 5. This can be mainly attributed to the poor RSH of the devices (see data in Table 5). Poor RSH usually indicates more current leakage pathways due to charge recombination or trapping. In terms of the interdigitated charge-transporting nano-morphology, the selenophene π-conjugation bridged copolymers do not form as good a thin film with PCBM as the thiophene π-conjugation bridged copolymers do. However, the selenophene-containing pCzSe devices (Se1–Se6) exhibit the widest range of FF variation (36.1–72.3%) among the four copolymer-based OPVs. This could be a good indication that the potential Se–Se interactions of the selenophene-containing copolymers depend on the device fabrication conditions.

In conclusion, this work has demonstrated a detailed comparison between thiophene- and selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymers in spectroscopic, thermal, electrochemical, field-effect charge transporting as well as photovoltaic properties. Significant red-shifted UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence were observed for the selenophene-bridged copolymers. The reduction of the band-gap energy by the replacement of thiophene with selenophene is more due to the lowering of the LUMO energy level than the raising of the HOMO energy level of the copolymers. The photovoltaic results obtained for the selenophene-bridged copolymer BHJ OPVs show a higher JSC than that of their thiophene-bridged copolymer counterparts, mostly due to the enhanced photocurrent, responsive to the exciton dissociation or diffusion at short wavelengths and sunlight absorption at long wavelengths. The contribution of the selenophene with higher hole mobility to the larger JSC of the BHJ OPVs is structure (solubilizing side chain of the copolymers) dependent. Although the selenophene-bridged donor–acceptor copolymer OPVs exhibit a higher JSC, which is beneficial for the PCE of OPVs, such an advantage is partially offset by a smaller VOC and FF. The inferior VOC and FF are ascribed to the higher HOMO energy level and the less appropriate nano-morphology of the PCBM blended thin film (and hence smaller RSH), respectively.



1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 MHz or AV-500 MHz Fourier transform spectrometer at room temperature. Elemental analyses (on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer), electron ionization (EI), or fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectroscopy (MS) were performed by the Elemental Analyses and Mass Spectroscopic Laboratory, respectively, in-house service of the Institute of Chemistry, Academic Sinica. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Waters GPC-1515 with a 2414 refractive index detector, using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard at 40 °C. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F-4500. Thermal decomposition temperatures (Td's) of the copolymers were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 analyzer systems. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to study the electrochemical properties of the copolymers. The copolymer thin film coated on a platinum electrode was studied in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Ag–Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) was used as reference electrode. For calibration, the redox potential of ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc–Fc+) was measured under the same conditions. Under these conditions, the onset oxidation potential of ferrocene (φox, Ferrocene) was 0.40 V versus Ag–Ag+. It is assumed that the redox potential of Fc–Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV to vacuum. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) were then calculated according to the following equations:
EHOMO = −[(φox − φox, Ferrocene) + 4.8)] (eV)
ELUMO = −[(φred − φox, Ferrocene) + 4.8)] (eV)
where
φox and φred are the onset oxidation and reduction potentials vs. Ag–Ag+ of the copolymer, respectively.

Solvents such as dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chlorobenzene, terrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and toluene were distilled after drying with appropriate drying agents. The dried solvents were stored over 4 Å molecular sieves before use. 2,7-Dibromo-9-dodecyl-9H-carbazole (1), 4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzol[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (2), 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (3) were synthesized following procedures reported in the literature. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were purchased from UR and H. C. Starck, respectively. They were used as received.


To a solution of compound 1 (0.99 g, 2.00 mmol) in dried tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) in a flame-dried 150 mL flask at −78 °C was added dropwise 1.70 mL (4.20 mmol) of n-butyllithium (2.5 M in hexane). The mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 1 hour and 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (0.90 mL, 0.819 g, 4.4 mmol) was added rapidly to the solution. After one additional hour at −78 °C, the resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 16 hours. The mixture was poured into water, extracted with diethyl ether four times and dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the magnesium sulfate, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by passing through a silica gel flash column using hexane:ethylacetate (10:1) as the eluent.

The copolymers pCzS and pCzSe were synthesized via Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization. A representative procedure is as follows. To a 25 mL two-neck round bottom flask, Cz (73.4 mg, 0.125 mmol), BTS (103.4 mg, 0.125 mmol) or BTSe (115.1 mg, 0.125 mmol), dry toluene (10.0 mL), and 1.0 mL of 20% aqueous tetraethylammonium hydroxide, Et4NOH(aq), were added.

The copolymers pBDTS and pBDTSe were synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polymerization. A representative procedure is as follows. To a 25 mL two-neck round bottom flask, BDT (96.5 mg, 0.125 mmol), BTS (103.4 mg, 0.125 mmol) or BTSe (115.1 mg, 0.125 mmol), and dry chlorobenzene (12.0 mL) were added.

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on patterned ITO glass substrate. The active layer of each solar cell device is 0.04 cm2. ITO glass substrates were sonicated sequentially in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The ITO substrates were then baked on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 minutes. A PEDOT:PSS thin film was spin-coated (2000 rpm, 60 s) and then baked at 150 °C for 10 minutes. Next, an active layer was spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer from a 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB) solution of the copolymer:PCBM blends. Different concentrations and spin-coating speeds were tested to optimize the best active layer thickness. Finally, 20 nm of Ca and 80 nm of Al were deposited on top of the active layer in a vacuum of about 8 × 10−6 Torr to complete the photovoltaic device fabrication. All devices were encapsulated inside a nitrogen-filled glove box.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ OPVs were measured in the dark and under AM 1.5G solar illumination from a class A solar simulator (Oriel 300 W), controlled by a programmable source meter (Keithley 2400). The light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode (PVM 172; area = 3.981 cm2) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device was calculated based on JSC, VOC, and FF, obtained from device measurements that were conducted under 1-sun AM 1.5G solar illumination. The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) were estimated by taking the reciprocal from the slope of a tangent to the J–V curve at the open- and short-circuit conditions, respectively.
For the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements, an AM 1.5G solar simulator was used to generate the bias light. A monochromator (Newport Model 74100), which was calibrated with a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated photodiode and chopped at 250 Hz, was used to select the wavelengths between 400 and 750 nm for illuminating the OPV. The photocurrent from the OPV was measured through a lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery 7265), which was in turn referenced to the chopper frequency. All electrical measurements were carried out in air.
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated with a bottom-gate, top-contact structure. The channel width (W) and length (L) of the transistors are 2 mm and 50 μm, respectively. The device was built on a heavily doped Si wafer with a layer of thermally grown SiO2 (∼300 nm) with a capacitance of 12 nF cm−2. The Si wafer functioned as the gate electrode while the octyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified SiO2 layer acted as the gate dielectric. The SiO2-covered Si wafer was cleaned and treated with OTS prior to use. The OTS treatment was performed by immersing the substrate in OTS solution (10 μL OTS in 40 mL dried toluene) for 5 minutes, followed by rinsing with toluene, and then air drying. The solution of S- or Se-containing copolymer in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and spin-coated on the substrate at 1500 rpm for 60 s at room temperature in a glove box. Subsequently, the gold (Au) source/drain electrode pairs (70 nm) were deposited on top of the polymer thin film by high vacuum thermal evaporation through a shadow mask to define the channel length (L, 50 μm) and width (W, 2 mm).
The electrical measurements were carried out in air using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 2636). The saturation mobility (μsat) was extracted from the slope of the square root of the drain current plot vs. VG from the following equation:
where
ID,sat is the drain-to-source saturated current; W/L is the channel width to length ratio; Ci is the capacitance of the insulator per unit area (Ci = 12 nF cm−2), and VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
