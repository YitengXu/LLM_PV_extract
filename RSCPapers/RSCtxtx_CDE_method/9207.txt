Mn3O4-anchored reduced graphene oxide (Mn3O4/RGO) nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized via a facile, effective, energy-saving technique. The surface morphology and structure of the Mn3O4/RGO composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda porosity (BJH). The composite material was applied as the counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel polarization measurements revealed a better electrocatalytic performance for the reduction of triiodide in Mn3O4/RGO based DSSCs, compared with the devices with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) CEs. The Mn3O4/RGO improves the fill factor by 56% and the power conversion efficiency of this kind of DSSC reaches 5.90%, which is much higher than the DSSC assembled from RGO CEs. A Pt counter electrode as a reference was also tested.

Since 1990s, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been a hot topic, because of the low cost, environmental friendliness and simple preparation procedures for this kind of photovoltaic device. Generally, a DSSC is composed of a semiconductor oxide sensitized by a dye, an electrolyte containing a redox couple (usually triiodide/iodide), and a counter electrode (CE usually Pt). The electrons flow through the external circuit and let the triiodide be reduced to iodide at the CE. By formerly researches, it has been confirmed that Pt is a superior CE material with good electrocatalytic properties and high electrical conductivity. However, as it is a noble metal, Pt CE is an expensive component in the DSSCs system. Therefore, several kinds of new materials, such as carbon materials and organic polymers, have been proposed to replace Pt. Unfortunately, most of them have low catalytic activity or bad corrosion resistance to a corrosive redox couple in the electrolyte.

Hausmannite Mn3O4, which has distinctive structure and physicochemical properties, is interested in energy conversion, magnetics and catalysis, etc. Mn3O4 always used as a catalyst for the reduction of nitrobenzene or oxidation of methane. Recently, Mn3O4 has been studied as an electrode for lithium ion batteries, but the poor electronic conductivity limits the performance of Mn3O4 as supercapacitive active material. In order to improve the capacitive performance of Mn3O4 electrodes, a promising approach is to construct composite electrodes with Mn3O4 nanostructures embedded in a highly conductive porous matrix.
Graphene nanosheet (GN), a single-layer material of sp2-bond-carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice, was noticed to have some unique physicochemical properties, such as excellent thermal conductivity, high surface area, strong mechanical strength, and good electric conductivity. These properties make it possible to decorating Mn3O4 films would increase both electrocatalytic activity and electron transport. In this work, we developed a Mn3O4/RGO composite using in the DSSCs system as CE catalysts. The composite structure enhances the catalytic performance for I3− reduction remarkably due to the synergistic powers of the mixture, such as increase both electrocatalytic activity, electron transport and the surface area. A power conversion efficiency of 5.90% for the DSSCs with the Mn3O4/RGO composite CE has been achieved, which is 100% larger than that for the RGO CE based DSSCs. It should be noted that all the processes for fabricating the Mn3O4/RGO composite CEs were performed in air and room temperature and the store is convenient (just in the air and room temperature). The method of fabricating this kind of CEs offers a potential way for effective and cheaper CEs of DSSCs.

Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powder (99%, Aladdin) by a modified Hummers method and the RGO suspension was prepared by hydrazine hydrate reduction as described in a previous publication. Manganese dioxide (MnO2, ≥72.0%, CP) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Inc., 0.3 g GO was added to 8 mL H2O and 8 mL ethanol solution. After the mixture was ultrasonic disrupter for 2 h, 0.3 g MnO2 was mixed into it and stirred for 15 min. 3 mL hydrazine hydrate (10 wt%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) was added to the above suspension, which was heated in a water bath at 90 °C for 1 h to form the Mn3O4/RGO suspension.


The Mn3O4/RGO CE was fabricated by a doctor-blade technique. The Mn3O4/RGO suspension is smeared on a FTO (fluorione-doped SnO2, 15 Ω sq−1) glass immobilized by an adhesive tape strip, which determines the film thickness. Then they were dried at room temperature for about 1 hour. Mn3O4/RGO films with certain thickness were prepared in one batch. Pure RGO CEs, which were employed as reference, were prepared via the same method as that for the Mn3O4/RGO CEs, GO was reduced by hydrazine hydrate. A series of CEs were prepared with different weight ratios between GO and MnO2. CEs from GO/MnO2 ratio of 1:2 (GO is 0.2 g and MnO2 is 0.4 g), 1:1, 2:1 were denoted as RGO/Mn3O4-1, RGO/Mn3O4-2, and RGO/Mn3O4-3, respectively. For comparison, platinized CEs were prepared by the thermal decomposition. Shortly as, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Pt ≥ 37.5%, AR, Aladdin) in isopropanol (C3H8O, ≥99.5%, AR, Aladdin) was spread on a FTO glass that followed by 390 °C heat treatment for 15 min.

TiO2 was synthesized by using the hydrothermal method. Then the TiO2 films (ca. 11 μm) were fabricated on the FTO glass using a doctor-blade method and the electrode were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. When the temperature cooled to about 90 °C, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.5 mM cis-Ru (H2dcbpy)2 (NCS)2 (H2dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridyl) (N3) in ethanol for 24 h. The DSSCs were assembled with a dye-sensitized photoanode, a CE and a redox electrolyte containing 0.5 M LiI (AR, Acros), 0.05 M I2 (AR, Acros), 0.6 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, AR, Aldrich), and 0.6 M 3-hexyl-1-methylimidazolium iodide (HMII) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%, GC, Alfa).

XRD patterns were recorded with a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 diffraction (WAXRD, 20–70°), equipped with Cu Kα radiation (scanning step 8° min−1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to measure the surface elements and the chemical state. The binding energies were calibrated by C1s photoelectron peak (284.6 eV). FTIR was conducted on Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–500 cm−1. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with an JEM2010 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The surface morphologies of graphene and the Mn3O4/RGO composite were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 15 kV) attached with an energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) analyzer. The surface areas of samples were determined from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature using a TriStar II 3020 instrument. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used for surface area calculation, and the pore size distribution (pore diameter, pore volume and micropore surface area of the samples) was determined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.

Photocurrent–photovoltage behaviors of the assembled DSSCs were measured using a computer-programmed Keithley 2611 Source Meter under illumination of simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5) supplied by a solar simulator (Oriel, 91160-100091192, Perccell Technologies). The incident light was calibrated with a power meter (model 350) and a detector (model 262) before each measurement. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.2 cm2.
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained in acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4, using Solartron SI1287 electrochemical interface system at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A Pt wire was used as counter electrode, an SCE as reference electrode and various CEs as the working electrode.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on DSSCs under 1.5 AM illumination at open-circuit voltage situation employing Solartron 1255B frequency response analyzer and Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system. The frequency range was 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and the amplitude of the ac voltage was 10 mV. Tafel polarization curve was measured with an electrochemical workstation system (Solartron, SI 1287). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1.

The XRD patterns of curve a in Fig. 1 shows the commercial MnO2 have the typical Ramsdellite type structures, the three strongest diffraction peaks are at 2θ = 22.011°, 55.776°, 36.883°, corresponding to the (101), (212), (210) crystal faces, respectively. Curve b in Fig. 1 shows the graphene oxide (GO) reduced by hydrazine hydrate become RGO, it has a broad peak near 2θ = 23.0°. It is known that GO has a broad peak near 2θ = 11.9° (d(002) = 7.63 Å). This significant shift to a higher 2θ angle suggests that the interlayer distance is reduced due to the removal of most of the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO. Compared curve a and curve c, a phase transformation can be found after MnO2 was reduced by hydrazine hydrate. The peak positions and intensities agree well with the data reported in the JCPDS standard card (PDF 24-0734) for Hausmannite. The three strongest peaks are at 2θ = (36.085°, 32.315°, 59.840°), corresponding to the (211), (103) and (224) crystal faces. Curve d shows that when the mixture of MnO2 and GO was reduced by hydrazine hydrate, the phase transformed to the mixture of Mn3O4 and RGO.

Chemical state information are analyzed (Fig. 2a) by focusing on the regions where the signals of Mn2p3, C1s, O1s are expected. The C1s peak located at 284.8 eV is related to the graphitic carbon in graphene (Fig. 2b). The O1s XPS spectrum of the hybrid shows three different peaks centered at 530.0, 531.7, 533.5 eV, which are corresponding to Mn–O–C bond, Mn–O–Mn bond, and Mn–O–H bond, respectively (Fig. 2c). In Fig. 2d, the binding energy value of Mn2p3/2 is 641.50 eV, and the spin orbit splitting between the Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2 level is 11.8 eV, which perfectly matches the Mn3O4.
The FTIR spectrum of GO (Fig. 3a) shows a strong OH peak at 3600–3300 cm−1 attributable to the hydroxyl stretching vibrations of the C–OH groups, and other C–O functionalities, the O–H deformation peak at 1365 cm−1, a weak bank at 1728 cm−1, assigned to COOH, 1225 cm−1 assigned to C–O–C stretching, 1040 cm−1 due to C–O stretching vibrations, and 871 cm−1 (weak) due to (O–CO). The spectrum depicts a peak at about 1620 cm−1, which corresponds to the remaining sp2 character. These characteristic bands were similar with previous reports.
As shown in Fig. 3b, the reduction treatment eliminated most oxygen-containing groups on the surface of GO. The peak at 1640 cm−1 is assigned to the sp2 character of graphene, indicating the formation of graphene nanosheets. Fig. 3c shows the FTIR spectrum of Mn3O4. The Mn3O4 is prepared by reducing MnO2. The absorption bands at 637, 532 cm−1 were assigned to the coupling modes between the Mn–O stretching modes of tetrahedral and octahedral sites.
In Fig. 3d, it is seen that in Mn3O4/RGO, the oxygen-containing groups of GO decrease significantly and two additional peaks at 620 and 510 cm−1 due to Mn–O. It is also noticed that these two peaks are blue shifted than the corresponding pure counterparts (Fig. 3c), indicating the attachment of Mn3O4 phase with the graphene surface.
TEM images in Fig. 4a reveal that the Mn3O4 nanoparticles are distributed on the surfaces of the graphene nanosheets in the form of either single particles or small particle aggregates. The nature of the Mn3O4 particles is revealed by the HR-TEM image which is shown in Fig. 4b. The Mn3O4 particles were anchored on the graphene sheets, and their crystal lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.491 nm can be assigned to the (101) planes of tetragonal Mn3O4.
SEM was initially used to determine the surface morphologies of RGO and Mn3O4/RGO films on FTO glasses. Fig. 5a and c are the SEM images of RGO films while Fig. 5b and d are for Mn3O4/RGO films. Compared Fig. 5a and b, The RGO CE showed a relatively homogeneous and smooth morphology with less cracks and pores on the film surface while Mn3O4/RGO film has a rougher surface and larger pores. The incorporation of Mn3O4 nanoparticles in the RGO film probably enhances specific surface area. From Fig. 5c and d, the thickness of the RGO film and Mn3O4/RGO films are both measured about 6 μm. As shown in the elemental mapping of Mn3O4/RGO (Fig. 5e), we observed the presence of the RGO nanosheets by distinctive elements such as C as well as the presence of Mn3O4 nanoparticles by Mn and O elements. Given the rather non-uniformly distributed Mn3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of RGO (Fig. 5f), we postulate that because of the Mn3O4 are attached onto the RGO sheets. This was further supported by the peak for Mn in the EDS spectrum due to the created Mn3O4.
Based on the SEM and TEM images, it could be confirmed that there is an intimate interaction between the Mn3O4 particles and the graphene sheets, and this combination could be an ideal way to construct composite materials which take advantage of the graphene sheets to enable fast electron transport from the graphene matrix to the Mn3O4 nanoparticles.
The nitrogen physisorption isotherms and the pore-size distribution of RGO and Mn3O4/RGO are shown in Fig. 6a. Both of them show a typical absorption/desorption isotherm of type IV with an H3 hysteresis loop. The BET surface area of the RGO film tested in this work is 32.2 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 0.076 cm3 g−1 while the BET surface area of Mn3O4/RGO composite film increases to 66.9 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 0.23 cm3 g−1. Therefore, Mn3O4 attributes to increase surface area of the composite. Moreover, the pore volume of Mn3O4/RGO greatly increased compared to that of RGO. Fig. 6b shows that the pore size distribution of Mn3O4/RGO and Mn3O4. They both have broad pore size distribution, from 2 nm up to nearly 40 nm, which is centered at 2.5 nm. The larger pore volume of Mn3O4/RGO composite indicates that it is more desirable for electrode materials because it creates a pathway for electrolyte ions to access active material and tolerate the volume expansion of active material during the oxidation–reduction process.
To optimize the CE towards higher solar cell performance, the different ratios of RGO and Mn3O4 composites are tested on the DSSCs. As introduced in the experiment section, Mn3O4/RGO-1, Mn3O4/RGO-2, Mn3O4/RGO-3, RGO, Pt CEs are tested. Five parallel devices for each sample were tested.
Fig. 7 compares the photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs with the five different CEs. The photovoltaic parameters were summarized in Table 1.

The DSSC using RGO as a CE shows photovoltaic parameters of open-circuit voltage at (Voc) of 555 mV, short-circuit current density (jsc) of 13.47 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.39 and an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 2.93%. The incorporation of Mn3O4 into RGO can improve the cells performance significantly. The DSSCs with the Mn3O4/RGO-2 CE exhibits an highest η of 5.90% (jsc = 15.20 mA cm−2, Voc = 635 mV, FF = 0.61), up to 86% of that obtained using the Pt CE (jsc = 16.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 635 mV, FF = 0.66, η = 6.84%). Compared with the RGO devices, the incorporation of Mn3O4 increased the FF remarkably, the η was almost raised by 100%. With the amount of RGO furtherly increased, the jsc is decreased (from 15.20 mA to 13.47 mA), while the FF firstly raised and later reduced.
The electrocatalytic activities of the prepared CEs were further verified by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 8 shows the CV curves for the Mn3O4/RGO-1, Mn3O4/RGO-2, Mn3O4/RGO-3, RGO, and Pt CEs. The anodic peaks I and II presented in the anodic scan correspond to the oxidation of I− to I3− and subsequent oxidation of I3− to I2, respectively. In the reversed cycle (i.e., cathodic scan), cathodic peaks II′ and I′ were observed corresponding to the reduction of I2 to I3− and I3− to I−, respectively.

Fig. 8 compares the CV curves for the five different kinds of CEs. For the Pt CE, the two pairs of redox peaks are distinct, implying its great catalytic activity. The peak attributed to the reduction of I3− (peak I′) was clearly observed for the Mn3O4/RGO-2 composite film, while it was not resolved for the RGO film. The cathodic and anodic peak current densities corresponding to reaction (1) for all the Mn3O4/RGO films are much higher than those for the RGO film. This also signifies that dispersing intrinsically electrocatalytic Mn3O4 nanoparticles onto the RGO surface leads to a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction; a result that is therefore favorable for the dye-regeneration process at the photoanode. What's more, the peak I′, I and II of Mn3O4/RGO-2 is clearer than Mn3O4/RGO-1 and Mn3O4/RGO-3, which means Mn3O4/RGO-2 CE has a better catalytic performance than the two others. The result of CV performance is as similar as the photocurrent–voltage characteristics. The anodic peaks of Mn3O4/RGO-3 are higher than Mn3O4/RGO-1's while cathodic peaks are not both higher, so we need further tests.
The charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, which were performed on the DSSCs under AM 1.5 illumination in open-circuit voltage conditions. The equivalent circuit of this type of cells is described in the inset of Fig. 9, which includes the series resistance (Rs) in the high frequency region, the RC (resistor–capacitor) processes of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface consist of interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) and capacitance of the electrical double layer (CPE1) in the medium-frequency region, and the RC processes of the TiO2 electrode/electrolyte interface consist of interfacial charge transfer resistance (RR) and capacitance of the depletion layer of the TiO2 electrode (CPE2) in the low-frequency region. The electrocatalytic performance of the counter electrode toward triiodide reduction can be evaluated in terms of Rct, which is determined by the diameter of the semicircle presented in the medium frequency region of impedance spectra.
As shown in Fig. 9 and Table 1, the Rct of Pt is 1.43 Ω, illustrating that Pt has a superior catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. Compared with the rest, RGO has the largest Rct (10.31 Ω) resulting in relatively low catalytic activity. The Rct of Mn3O4/RGO-2 is 5.24 Ω, which is smaller than Mn3O4/RGO-1 (6.94 Ω) and Mn3O4/RGO-3 (7.20 Ω), has a higher catalytic activity. As Rs is similar for the composite films, the different FF should be related to the Rct. FF increased from 0.59 to 0.61 firstly and then it decreased to 0.58, while Rct decreased from 6.94 Ω to 5.24 Ω firstly and then increased to 7.20 Ω.
It is well known that Tafel polarization measurement is a powerful electrochemical characterization method. To further investigate the catalytic activities, we measured the Tafel curves of the Mn3O4/RGO-1, Mn3O4/RGO-2, Mn3O4/RGO-3, RGO and Pt CEs. Fig. 10 shows their Tafel curves, and the logarithmic current density (log j) as a function of voltage (U). Theoretically, the Tafel curve can be divided into 3 zones. The curve at low potential curve (|U| < 120 mV) is attributed to the polarization zone, the curve at middle potential (with a sharp slope) is attributed to the Tafel zone, and the curve at high potential (horizontal part) is attributed to the diffusion zone. In the latter two zones, we can obtain information on the exchange current density (j0) and the limiting diffusion current density (jlim), which interconnects closely with the catalytic activity of the catalysts. In the Tafel zone, the cathodic branch of the curve shows a large slope for Pt, indicating a high j0 on the Pt electrode surface according to the Tafel equation. This means Mn3O4/RGO-2 can catalyze reducing triiodide to iodide best except Pt. In addition, according to eqn (3), Rct which can be estimated from Fig. 10 varies inversely with j0. The change tendency of calculated Rct results on Mn3O4/RGO-1, Mn3O4/RGO-2, Mn3O4/RGO-3, RGO and Pt CEs are generally in accordance with the results obtained in EIS measurement.

where
R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.

The jlim depends on the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide/iodide redox couple in the DSSC system. As shown in the Fig. 8, the jlim values of the five electrodes are of the same magnitude. This finding indicates that there is a similar diffusion coefficient in the symmetrical dummy cell according to eqn (4), Where D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, C is the triiodide concentration and n and F retain their established meanings.

In summary, we successfully synthesized Mn3O4/RGO nanocomposites via GO and MnO2 reduced by hydrazine hydrate. It is a facile, effective, energy-saving technique to not only effectively reduce the mixture but also well combined RGO and Mn3O4. The Mn3O4 particles and RGO sheets interact with each other intimately because of Mn3O4 particles directly grow on the surfaces of graphene sheets. What's more, we firstly use it in DSSCs, developed a new type of Pt-free counter electrode. It deserves to be mentioned that all the processes for fabricating the Pt-free Mn3O4/RGO CEs are carried out in air at room temperature. The films did not peel off during the fabrication of DSSCs, which means a good adhesion of these materials. By changing the ratio between RGO and Mn3O4, the DSSCs assembled with the Mn3O4/RGO-2 reached a best conversion efficiency of 5.9% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2). Compared with the DSSCs which were assembled from pure RGO CEs, the power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs improved, because of the Mn3O4 particles created into the RGO lamellar structure as props. This is a useful way to enlarge the RGO surface area. The RGO also improved both electrocatalytic activity and electron transport of Mn3O4. CV, EIS, Tafel polarization, and photocurrent–voltage analysis confirm the excellent catalytic activities of the synthesized Mn3O4/RGO composites, which are comparable to that of pure RGO and the expensive Pt catalyst prepared by a pyrolysis method. These results demonstrate that doping MnO2 into GO and reduced it to Mn3O4/RGO composite is a good way to improve electrochemic performance of RGO and this new type of composite material is a promising material to replace the expensive Pt as a CE for DSSCs.
