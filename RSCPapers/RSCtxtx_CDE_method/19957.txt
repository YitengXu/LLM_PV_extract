Environmentally friendly earth-abundant Cd-free Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells have recently achieved increasing power conversion efficiency by using ZnSnO as the buffer layer. However, the large open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit remains the key concern. Here, we report a Cd-free CZTS solar cell that exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of 10.2% resulting from the application of an aluminium oxide (Al2O3) passivation layer prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). We found that the application of full ALD cycles as well as trimethylaluminum (TMA) exposures resulted in a significant increase in Voc and relate this to the properties of the CZTS interface. Both processes facilitate the formation of a thicker Cu-deficient nanolayer with a higher concentration of Na and O, forming a homogeneous passivation layer across the CZTS surface. This nanolayer reduces the local potential fluctuation of band edges and leads to the widened electrical band gap and suppressed defects recombination at the heterojunction interface, thus improvement in Voc and device performance. The ability of nanolayers to alter the atomic composition in the near surface region of compound semiconductors might be beneficial for a wider range of semiconductor devices.

Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells have recently emerged as a promising candidate for scalable thin-film solar cell development, mainly due to a generic similarity to commercialized CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) and CdTe solar cell technologies while consisting of only earth-abundant and non-toxic constituents. The current record efficiency for pure sulphide CZTS is already at 11%, although relying on a toxic CdS buffer layer. In addition, although much progress has been made with CZTS solar cells, performance is mainly hampered by the large open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit. In this paper, we reported the first Cd-free CZTS solar cell beyond 10% efficiency, bringing this low-cost and green absorber one step closer to commercial practicality. This efficiency improvement was obtained by using an atomic layer deposited (ALD) aluminium oxide (Al2O3) passivation layer to reduce interface recombination at the top surface heterojunction, thus significantly reducing the Voc deficit. The CZTS surface modifications by each ALD sub-step are systematically investigated to understand the origin of the passivation effect. This work demonstrates the effective application of ALD-Al2O3 for Cd-free CZTS solar cells and provides fresh insights into the mechanism of Al2O3 passivation on the nanoscale. Achieving above 10% efficiency confirms the opportunity to further develop of kesterite solar cells.


Thin film photovoltaic devices comprising earth-abundant, non-toxic materials are considered as a promising option for next-generation photovoltaics. Among the most promising thin-film technologies, kesterite solar cells including Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) have witnessed rapid development in the past decades to the current power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%. However, most high-performance kesterite devices have been fabricated using CdS as the buffer layer which is obviously not desirable when aiming for a fully environmentally-friendly process. Cd-Free buffer layers have shown great potential in chalcogenide solar cells as evidenced by the fact that Solar Frontier recently announced a record efficiency of 23.35% for a Cd-free CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) solar cell. By contrast, Cd-free CZTS solar cells have only demonstrated a champion efficiency of 9.7% to date, posing significant constraints in competing with CIGS at a commercial level. Further improvements have been hampered by difficulties in tackling the large deficit in the open-circuit voltage (Voc), which at least in part, is attributed to intrinsic point defects and local fluctuations of the band gap and electrostatic potential in CZTS.

There have been various factors proposed associated with defects passivation of surfaces and grain boundaries. The band offset at the heterojunction has been found to impact the extent of recombination across the interface. Our previous study has shown that interface recombination can be partially suppressed using an atomic layer deposited (ALD) ZnSnO buffer layer in the CZTS solar cell, which resulted in an improvement of the band alignment and lattice mismatch at the heterojunction interface. Alkaline doping (e.g. Na, K, and Rb) has also been reported to suppress the interface recombination by modifying the surface and grain boundary chemistry in chalcogenide and kesterite solar cells. Specifically, an alkaline postdeposition treatment (PDT) in CIGS solar cells is shown to affect the electronic structure of the heterojunction interface via an enlarged surface band gap or downshift of the band edges. For example, a NaF PDT induces a widening band gap at the surface of CIGSe in high performing CIGSe solar cells. This surface band gap became even larger if the NaF PDT is replaced by a NaF/KF PDT, which could be attributed to the formation of Cu- and Ga-depleted layer near the CIGSe surface. In addition, a RbF postdeposition treatment on CIGSe/CdS heterojunction is found to cause an additional downward band bending which reduced interface recombination, leading to a pronounced improvement in the device performance. Annealing in air, air exposure or an oxygen plasma treatment also work as an effective approach to reduce the defect density at the surface of CZTS(Se). The introduction of oxygen (O) from the ambient atmosphere into Cu2ZnSnSe4 is believed to generate Cu2ZnSn(Se,O)4, which both lowers the valence band maximum as well as widening the bandgap, leading to effective minority carrier suppression at the grain boundary and surface. It is interesting to note that surface sodium is usually correlated with the presence of oxygen in CZTS which combined play a key role in the suppression of the Voc deficit.
A conformal coating by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can provide precise modification and passivation at the interface due to the intrinsic self-terminating nature of the process. Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) nanolayers deposited by ALD have shown to be an effective way to passivate p- and n-type silicon surfaces through chemical and field-effect passivation. Generally, chemical passivation is achieved by hydrogen passivation or the interfacial silicon oxide layer whereas the field-effect passivation is associated with the high density of negative fixed charges located within the first nanometers of the Al2O3 layer. The origin of negative fixed charges may arise from excess oxygen during the initial growth of nonstoichiometric Al2O3 or a gradient in coordination through the negative charges of the tetrahedral coordination. In addition, the utilization of ALD-alumina for surface passivation has been demonstrated for organic, dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells by forming a recombination barrier layer and thereby improving the device performance. ALD-Al2O3 has also been employed in chalcogenide thin film solar cells such as Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CdTe, and CZTSe solar cells, demonstrating good interface passivation. With the introduction of ALD-Al2O3 before the CdS buffer, Lee et al. demonstrated effective surface passivation as well as improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), leading to an enhancement of 15% in the relative efficiency for CZTSSe devices. The applicability of ALD-Al2O3 was also extended to CZTS solar cells with CdS buffer in the work of Park et al., where hydrogen was proposed to account for the passivation effect at the surface. Despite the seminal studies demonstrating the benefits of Al2O3 in CZTS(Se) devices with CdS buffer, the application of Al2O3 in CZTS device with Cd-free buffer has not been investigated to date. Note that a CZTS/ZnSnO solar cell implemented a dry ALD process to deposit buffer layer whereas CZTS/CdS used a wet chemical bath deposition process, which might affect the pre-deposited ALD Al2O3 in a quite different way. Furthermore, the factors governing the underlying passivation mechanisms have only partly been uncovered, especially on the evolution of the chemical and electronic properties of CZTS surface when it is subjected to the ALD treatment. Hence, a detailed investigation is required on the interaction of CZTS with ALD precursors and co-reactants during the deposition of Al2O3 on the CZTS surface.
We elucidate for the first time how an ALD-Al2O3 coating can effectively passivate the interface defects in a Cd-free CZTS device with ZnSnO buffer layer. We demonstrate that ultrathin Al2O3 films deposited by ALD can effectively improve the performance of Cd-free CZTS devices (with a structure of Mo/CZTS/ZnSnO/i-ZnO/ITO) through heterojunction modification. With a significant gain of Voc and FF, we achieved a device efficiency of 10.2%, the highest efficiency ever reported for a Cd-free CZTS solar cell to the best of our knowledge. To understand the mechanism governing the passivation and performance improvement in CZTS device with Al2O3, the effects of trimethylaluminum (TMA) precursor, H2O precursor and heating effects were all carefully investigated independently as well. The resulting photovoltaic performance demonstrated that the TMA exposure step plays a key role in the passivation of CZTS/ZnSnO heterojunction. Optoelectronic characterisation confirmed that the improvements could mainly be attributed to the passivation of defects at the heterojunction interface. The improvement in Voc after the various processes was found well correlated with the Na concentration variation at the CZTS surface as identified through surface chemical and electronic analysis. We then demonstrate that the excess oxygen originating from the initial growth of ALD-Al2O3 might explain the segregation of Na from the bulk to the interface. Finally, a plausible mechanism for the passivation induced by ALD-Al2O3 is proposed. ALD-Al2O3 facilitates the formation of a thicker Cu-deficiency nano-layer with a higher concentration of Na and O, forming a homogeneous passivation layer across the CZTS surface. This nano-layer reduces the local potential fluctuation of the band edges and locally widens the band gap and promotes downward band bending, hence the improvement in Voc and device performance.

In this work, we integrated an ultrathin ALD-Al2O3 layer into CZTS/ZnSnO heterojunction based on the previously proposed structure (Mo/CZTS/ZnSnO/i-ZnO/ITO) as shown in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig. 1a. The optimization of ALD-Al2O3 layer thickness was done by fabricating a series of CZTS solar cells with a different number of ALD cycles ranging from 2 to 10, which was equal to 0.2–1 nm in thickness. The box-plot diagram of the PV performance parameters of CZTS cells incorporating various ALD cycles can be found in Fig. S1 (ESI). For 2 cycles of ALD-Al2O3, no significant effect on the CZTS device performance can be seen, probably due to the incomplete coverage of the CZTS absorber. When the number of the cycles reached 10 (1 nm thickness), both Jsc and FF decreased significantly, most likely due to impaired carrier transport through the thick Al2O3 layer. 5 Al2O3 ALD-cycles seems to be the optimum parameter in terms of efficiency of the CZTS device. As a direct demonstration of the benefits of ALD-Al2O3 passivation layer, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the champion Cd-free CZTS cell is shown in Fig. 1b. This ALD-treated device was obtained by depositing 5 cycles of Al2O3 before the ZnSnO buffer layer, leading to a Jsc of 21.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 736 mV, FF of 65.8% and PCE of 10.2%, enabling an increase of 10% relative in efficiency compared to previous record device without Al2O3, as shown in Table 1. Fig. 1c presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best performing device with Al2O3. The EQE-derived Jsc under 1 sun illumination at 1000 W m−2 was measured to be 22.0 mA cm−2 for the Al2O3 device, which was higher than the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurement. This is reasonable as the small spot measurement used in EQE avoids the optical loss from the metal grid shading that was present in the J–V measurement. Therefore, an active area efficiency of 10.7% was obtained for the record solar cell. Another noticeable improvement for the device with ALD treatment was the higher Voc and FF, pointing to the improved electronic quality of the CZTS/ZnSnO interface, especially considering that both devices were fabricated using otherwise identical experimental conditions.

To understand the mechanism governing the passivation and performance improvement in CZTS device with ALD Al2O3, we investigated the independent effects from the TMA precursor, H2O and heating effects separately. A schematic illustration of the investigated absorbers treated with different ALD process is presented in Fig. 2a. The procedure of sample preparation with different ALD treatment is described in the Experimental methods section. All the samples were then processed to make full devices in order to study each effect on the solar cell performance, as shown in Fig. 2b. While all the treatments had little influence on the Jsc, they mainly affected the Voc and FF in most cases except heat treatment. Devices with TMA treatment show a similar improvement in Voc with respect to Al2O3 treatment, which was significantly higher than the H2O treatment. The FF, however, does not show a strong variation but still follows a similar trend with the Voc. Therefore, the combination of all the trends results in the highest efficient devices with Al2O3 and TMA treatment followed by the devices with the H2O treatment. These results demonstrate that TMA plays a key role in the passivation scheme, which might help to understand the underlying mechanism of Al2O3 passivation. The Voc becomes our main focus in evaluating the mechanism from ALD treatments, as it presents the most pronounced variation in the device with different treatments.

Optoelectronic measurements were performed on the champion devices with different ALD treatment, to study the origin of the performance improvement. The EQE spectra of the champion devices are shown in Fig. 3a. We observe an enhanced blue response in the curves of devices with ALD treatment. These improvements were consistent with the trend of PCE improvement, where TMA shows better blue response than the other effects. On the other hand, the ALD treatment leads to a blue shift of the band edge which is observable between 750 and 850 nm in the EQE spectrum, corresponding to an increased optical bandgap of the CZTS. Several studies showed that the post-annealing treatments could affect the bulk bandgap of CZTS by changing the bandgap fluctuation induced by the Cu–Zn order in CZTS. Therefore, the widened bandgap after all the ALD treatments with annealing effects involved can be partly explained by the reduced bandgap fluctuation. It is interesting to see that both the Al2O3 and TMA treatment present a larger shift in optical bandgap than the other effects compared to the control device. We suspect more effects from Al2O3 and TMA treatment should exist other than annealing effects. Furthermore, this bandgap value change agrees with the PL peak positions determined from the photoluminescence (PL) measurement shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), which demonstrate a blue shift for the ALD-treated device. Note that an excitation laser with a wavelength of 405 nm was used in the PL measurement, thus the luminescence mainly came from the top surface of CZTS. Hence, the improvement in Voc might be correlated with the enhanced bandgap of CZTS surface after the ALD treatment. In terms of the PL peak intensity, it has been reported that the photoluminescence intensity increased after the CZTS subject to Al2O3 coating. We also observed an increase in photoluminescence intensity for our devices with ALD treatment, which means the non-radiative recombination has been suppressed. A TMA exposure was again found to passivate the CZTS better compared to an H2O or heat treatment as evidenced by the fact that the PL intensity was found to be significantly higher.

Another important issue which needs to be addressed is whether the recombination was mainly suppressed in the bulk or just within the heterojunction region. For this reason, we carried out the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and Suns–Voc measurements to identify the location of the passivated defects. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was used to qualitatively compare the effects of different ALD treatment on the minority charge carrier lifetime of the device. The measurement was done using an excitation wavelength of 470 nm, which has a penetration length of 256 nm and consequently is mainly sensitive to the surface of CZTS absorber. As shown in Fig. 3b, the normalized PL decay curves could be fitted by a two-exponential function and the decay time were extracted to be 5.4, 6.3, 6.0, 5.5, 4.8 ns for devices with no treatment (Ref), Al2O3, TMA, H2O and heat treatment, respectively. A prolonged carrier lifetime for the Al2O3 and TMA sample indicates that the defects being passivated after those treatments could mainly stem from the heterojunction region. This conclusion can be further confirmed from the Suns–Voc measurements, where the Voc was measured as a function of incident light intensity. The saturation current J01 and J02 were then extracted by using a two-diode model fit to identify the origin of the passivation effects. Note that the recombination in the bulk of the solar cell is usually represented by J01, while recombination at the space charge region is attributed to J02. It can be understood from Fig. 3c that the J01 values were approximately identical for all the treated devices, whereas J02 was significantly lower after the TMA and Al2O3 treatment compared to the H2O and heat treatment. Again, we can conclude that TMA and Al2O3 treatment helped to suppress defects recombination at the space charge region (SCR) more efficiently than those of H2O and heat treatment.

Furthermore, we use the capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements and drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) to distinguish the defects between bulk and interface. Generally, we obtain information about the free carriers, bulk and interface defects deduced from the C–V measurements, while we identify the response only from the free carrier and the bulk defects using the DLCP technique. Thus, the defects density at CZTS/ZnSnO interface can be determined by subtracting the DLCP defect density (NDLCP) from the C–V defect density (NCV), as shown in Fig. 3d. The near overlap of the C–V and DLCP profile in the case of Al2O3-treated sample means the interface defects were mostly passivated. Quantitatively, the relative value between NDLCP and NCV at Vdc = 0 were chosen to quantify the defect density (in Fig. S3, ESI), where the Ref device possessed a larger interface state response (7.3 × 1016 cm−3) than the Al2O3-treated one (1.7× 1016 cm−3), suggesting a lower density of interface defects in the device with an Al2O3 passivation layer. With this strong device level evidence of interface passivation triggered by Al2O3 and TMA, it is interesting to understand the chemical origin of this performance improvement.

Firstly, the structural properties of CZTS were examined after ALD treatment using Raman spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). The measurements were taken on bare CZTS absorbers and CZTS/ZnSnO with different ALD treatment recorded with a 514 nm excitation wavelength. No significant changes in the CZTS phases can be seen either from the intensity or the peak position of the characteristic peaks. Hence, we turned our focus to the chemical modifications of the CZTS surface after each ALD treatment. XPS analysis was then carried out on a bare CZTS surface (Ref) as well as CZTS surface after Al2O3 treatment, TMA treatment or H2O treatment. The exposure time of the samples (within 15 min) to the ambient atmosphere was kept similar to that in the fabrication process of CZTS device to minimize the chemical difference between samples and devices. In order to determine the surface composition and the chemical state of Al, O, Na and Cu after each treatment, curve fitting was performed on the Cu 3s/Al 2s, O 1s, Na 1s, and Cu 2p3 peaks, as shown in Fig. 4a–d. It has been reported that surface oxides and Na-containing compounds may exist on the surface of CZTS absorber with air exposure. This was also found in our case, where the characteristic O 1s peak (531.2 eV) and Na 1s peak (1071.6 eV) were identified in the bare CZTS surface. Besides, the binding energy peak at 532.8 eV which is representative of the hydroxyl (–OH) species presents in the CZTS surface without treatment and with H2O treatment. In the Al 2s region, the component 118.7 eV assigned to oxidized Al species was found in the CZTS after Al2O3 and TMA treatment, indicating the presence of Al2O3 after either treatment. This was corroborated by the complementary decrease in the –OH bonds in the case of Al2O3 and TMA treated sample, as was determined by the decreased intensity of –OH peak at 532.8 eV. It is interesting to note that TMA consumed the hydroxyl groups on CZTS surface even when no H2O cycle was used in the experiment. Residual water from the wall of ALD chamber might also react with the deposited TMA to form higher aluminium oxidation state, as evidenced by the increasing Al–O peak at 531.2 eV. The O 1s (Al–O contribution) and Al 2s peak areas were then used to estimate O and Al atomic percentages. For the Al2O3 and TMA sample, the Al–O contribution was roughly evaluated by subtracting the contribution of metal–O of the Ref sample from the entire O 1s area. Thus, the O/Al ratio after Al2O3 and TMA treatment is found to be 8.0 and 7.0, much higher than the stoichiometric ratio 1.5. The resulting excess oxygen at the interface was suggested to contribute as oxygen interstitial (Oi) defects as has been earlier reported for ALD Al2O3 on top of Si, which is believed to contribute to the negative charge at the interface. This might be indicative for a similar growth behaviour of ALD-Al2O3 based on –OH terminated surface, either on Si or CZTS.

Besides the O-rich Al2O3 layer formed after Al2O3 and TMA treatment, we also notice the significant increase of [Na] accompanied by the decrease of [Cu], [Zn], [Sn] and [S] (see Fig. S4, ESI). This observation indicates the formation of surface oxides with an even larger amount of Na after either Al2O3 or TMA treatment. The variation in the atomic concentration of Na and Cu as a function of treatment is presented in Fig. 4i. We notice a clear increase of Na accompanied by a decrease of the Cu after ALD treatment, while the overall quantity maintains relatively constant. The variation of the Na amount agrees well with the change tendency in the Voc along with different ALD treatment. It seems that heat treatment prompted the transportation of Na to the CZTS surface, while Al2O3 and TMA treatment make the amount of Na segregation to the surface even larger. These measurements suggest that the increased Na composition along with Cu deficit at the CZTS surface induced by the ALD treatment might contribute to the Voc improvement.
To investigate the near-surface region of the CZTS before and after ALD-Al2O3 treatment, XPS measurements were also carried out after sputtering to remove approximately 0.5 nm of material, as illustrated in Fig. 4e–h. The characteristic Al 2s peak almost completely disappeared for the Al2O3 treated sample after sputtering, confirming the removal of Al2O3. Meanwhile, the O and Na was almost completely removed for the Ref sample after sputtering indicating that surface oxides and Na-containing compounds are limited to a thickness around 0.5 nm. However, there were still oxides accompanied by Na present at CZTS/Al2O3 interface in the Al2O3 sample, likely due to a larger amount of Na segregation in the presence of the Al2O3 coating. Unlike the etching of Al2O3 by ammonium hydroxide in the case of CZTS/CdS solar cell when the CZTS/Al2O3 was subjected to the subsequent chemical bath deposition of CdS, Al2O3 should remain at the CZTS/ZnSnO interface due to the non-etching dry process of ALD-ZnSnO buffer layer. The presence of Al was also confirmed from the near atomic-scale chemical analysis by atom probe tomography (APT). Fig. 5a shows the 3-D distribution of the atoms at the CZTS/Al2O3/ZnSnO interfaces of the 10.2% efficient CZTS device. Only the Na ions (green) and Cu ions (orange) are shown in this reconstruction. The concentration profile of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, O and Na atoms along the cylinder positioned across the interface (see Fig. 5a) is illustrated in Fig. 5b. A bin size of 1 nm was chosen and all species present were decomposed into their constituent elements, as several molecular ions were present in the mass spectrum. It is interesting to find that a Zn hump appeared at the CZTS/ZnSnO interface, which is most likely correlated to an ultrathin Zn(S,O) tunnel layer that was confirmed at the CZTS/ZnSnO interface by performing detailed microscopy analysis in our previous investigation. The concentration changes in Fig. 5b show that Na segregated between CZTS and ZnSnO, together with Al. If only the [Na], [O], and [Al] is plotted it can be seen that the Al accumulation is also accompanied by an oxygen peak right between the CZTS absorber and ZnSnO buffer layer, hence confirms the excess O induced from the Al2O3. Together with the more O-rich surface layer of the passivated sample that was confirmed by the XPS results, we hypothesize that the excess oxygen, originating from the initial growth of ALD Al2O3, could form negative charged interstitial Oi−, and therefore attract interstitial Nai+ from bulk to the interface. The role of Na has been found to act as a surfactant and suppressor of non-radiative recombination at the interface of CZTS solar cells.
Furthermore, after sputtering the Cu related peaks increased drastically compared with the as-received samples. In Fig. 4j, a further check of the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio before and after sputtering demonstrate that the Cu concentration increased considerably after sputtering, revealing a depletion of Cu at the near-surface region of the CZTS. Al2O3 and TMA treatment lead to a stronger reduction of the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio compared to the Ref treatment, thus leading to more depletion of Cu near the surface. The Cu depletion has also been observed at CIGS surfaces, however caused by different mechanisms. Some reports suggested that the oxygenation-induced redistribution and increased Fermi energy at the surface should contribute to the liberation of Cu from surface to bulk. From the complementary relationship between Na and Cu, the increased concentration of Na seems to induce enhanced Cu depletion, probably attributed to ion exchange itself or the promotion of oxygenation. It is also interesting to note that the Al2O3 and TMA lead to a modification of the chemical composition at the CZTS surface (Na-rich, Cu-depletion) thus could induce the enlargement of the band gap at the near-surface. The Al2O3/TMA induced band gap widening at the CZTS surface suppressing the defects recombination between absorber and buffer layer might also be the reason for the improved solar cell performance.

Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was performed to study the effects of the Al2O3 treatment at the CZTS/ZnSnO heterojunction by detecting the local surface potential, providing the morphology and local electronic properties of the CZTS films upon passivation treatment. A schematic of the KPFM measurement setup is shown in Fig. S5a (ESI). The topography of the Ref and Al2O3 samples are shown in Fig. 6a and e, no clear difference in the surface morphology and grain size due to the Al2O3 treatment could be seen. Fig. S5b (ESI) depicts the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (Rq) distribution of the CZTS/ZnSnO heterojunction films with and without Al2O3 treatment, where the Ref (56.7 nm) sample shows a similar roughness compared to the Al2O3 sample (49.5 nm). To compare the electronic surface properties of the samples, the simultaneously recorded contact potential difference (CPD) spatial maps were captured in dark conditions for Ref and the Al2O3 samples, as shown in Fig. 6b and f. Due to the absence of photoinduced charge carriers, the CPD results collected in dark condition merely represent the properties of the as-prepared surface. It is visibly distinguishable that CPDs at the grain boundaries (GBs) are lower than grain interiors (GIs); a similar surface potential was also observed in the CZTS film without any treatment when measured in the dark in our previous research. This lower GB potential formed due to the built-in electrical field arising from the passivation effects through Na segregation at the GBs. According to previous first-principle calculations, an interstitial Nai+ atom around the GB region could create a dip in the energy band diagram of CZTSe, which assists electron flow towards the GB and simultaneously repel holes.Fig. 6i shows the distribution histogram of the CPD values measured in dark where a narrower distribution of CPD is observed in the sample with Al2O3 treatment, suggesting enhanced homogeneous chemical and/or electronic characteristics.

Also, the overall CPD is shifted to a higher value for the Al2O3 sample which indicates higher band bending in respect to the tip and implies that the surface electronic and chemical states are different from the reference sample. Combining with above chemical analysis results, we suspect that change of the surface chemistry, rich in Na and O concentration, increases the overall CPD, thus, results in more band bending in respect to the tip. We then check the CPD values at the GBs and GIs for corresponding samples in Fig. 6k. It shows that average CPD value increased by 5.6% (7.0%) at the GIs compared to 9.0% (11.2%) at the GBs after treatment at a wavelength of 400 nm (750 nm), which infers that the increase of the overall CPD is mainly attributed to the CPD value increase at the GBs. Assuming that the electron affinity is nearly uniform over the CZTS surface, the potential distribution profile can be considered as a profile of the conduction band edge of the CZTS materials without regard to their raw numerical values. The schematic band gap fluctuation for CZTS with and without Al2O3 treatment is shown in Fig. 7a. Generally, the CZTS band gap exhibits large local potential fluctuations triggered by a random distribution of charged point defects and Cu–Zn disorder. When the CZTS treated with Al2O3, the charged point defects can be passivated thus resulting in less local potential fluctuations, thus a large Voc improvement is expected.
To further examine the charge separation behavior in CZTS heterojunction before and after Al2O3 treatment, KPFM measurements under the illumination were performed using an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and 750 nm, respectively. Note that, a laser excitation wavelength of 400 nm is expected to induce the photo-generated carriers near to the surface of CZTS, whereas 750 nm excitation produces a more uniform photogeneration within the bulk of CZTS. For each excitation wavelength, the illumination was switched on about every 1 μm during continuous scanning with increased illumination intensity from 0 to 894 mW cm−2 for 400 nm and 0 to 12000 mW cm−2 for 750 nm (scan axis is from bottom-to-top), as shown in Fig. 6c, d and g, h for Ref and Al2O3 sample, respectively. We notice the two samples depict clearly different CPD contrast changing with the light intensity, as well as quite different response to illumination of different excitation wavelength. Fig. 6j shows the average CPD values for the corresponding samples as a function of illumination intensity. The average CPD decreases as the light intensity increasing suggest that the photo-generated free electrons are accumulated at the front surface separated by the CZTS/ZnSnO heterojunction. The CPD drops from dark to highest intensity of illumination for Al2O3 sample is almost 2.3 times (1.8 times) larger than the Ref sample at a wavelength of 400 nm (750 nm) (shown in Fig. S5c, ESI), indicating the more effective charge-separation capability induced by the passivation layer. Especially at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm, the passivated sample shows an even larger CPD drop than the reference sample, likely due to the more efficient carrier separation at the surface of CZTS. Therefore, the Al2O3 sample passivates defects at the surface which promotes photo-generated charges carrier collection at short wavelength, thereby explaining the enhanced blue response from EQE in the Al2O3 device (Fig. 3a).
The CPD values difference between dark and light, also known as surface photovoltage (SPV), were calculated at GBs and GIs for corresponding samples, as shown in Fig. 6k. For the Ref sample, SPVGI was 23 mV whereas SPVGB was almost zero which indicated that there is no charge separation at the GB. On the other hand, the SPVGB becomes 34 mV when passivated and SPVGI becomes slightly higher compared to the Ref sample indicates that charge separation is much more enhanced at the GBs compare to GIs. We suspect that more Na will accumulate at GBs during the negative charged interstitial Oi− at the CZTS surface which attracts the interstitial Nai+ from bulk to the interface. The partial atom probe reconstructions of the CZTS absorber layer shown in Fig. 5c was used to examine the elemental concentrations in the vicinity of GBs. It is observed that significant amounts of Na segregated towards the CZTS grain boundary, whereas hardly any Na was detected in the grain interior. A cylinder was positioned perpendicular across the grain boundary to determine the concentration changes as illustrated in Fig. 5d. Please note that a common problem with APT is that ion identification and range widths within the mass spectrum have an extensive effect on chemical composition. Since a large number of molecular peaks were detected in the mass spectrum of this dataset, there is a chance that some of them might have been identified incorrectly, which would lead to errors in the concentration profile. Furthermore, there are several peak overlaps between some of the major peaks, e.g. Zn and S2 at 32 Da. The concentration values should therefore be regarded as qualitative, rather than quantitative. After careful analysis, we found Cu and Zn enrichments, and Sn, S depletion at GBs compared to the GIs. Additionally, segregation of O accompanied by Na were also detected at GBs as shown in Fig. 5e. Our result suggests that the presence of Na in combination with O contributed to the passivation of the point defects at the CZTS grain boundary. Similar results have been reported in CIGS and CZTSSe films, where the formation of oxide at the GBs also played an important role in defect passivation. Furthermore, an oxygen-substituted layer at the grain boundary resulted in lowered CBM of the CZTS grain boundary, thus formed hole barriers in the vicinity of the GBs.

The energy level of the CZTS surface before and after ALD treatment were characterized using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. S7, ESI). The valence band maximum (VBM) estimated from the valence band spectra for Ref sample was 0.53 ± 0.1 eV below the Fermi energy level (EF). This value seems unchanged for the H2O treated sample while it improved for the TMA and Al2O3 treated samples. It was found that the valence band maximum shifted by about 0.12 ± 0.1 eV away from the Fermi energy level after Al2O3 treatment. Subsequently, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CZTS surface can be obtained by adding the bandgap determined from the EQE band edge at long wavelength. Herein, the band diagrams illustrating the band alignment at the heterojunction for CZTS with and without Al2O3 treatment are depicted in Fig. 7b and c. Clearly, the Al2O3 passivated sample demonstrated a lowered VBM at the surface, as well as slightly lowered CBM, compared to the reference. Consequently, the additional downward band bending induced by Al2O3 treatment is expected to decrease the interface recombination. This modified band alignment can be attributed to the Cu-depleted compound with a higher concentration of O and Na (see the XPS analysis) formed at the near-surface region of CZTS/Al2O3. Density function theory (DFT) calculations on Cu2ZnSnSe4 and oxidized Cu2ZnSnSe3O1 have shown that O substitution for Se can suppress the VBM and lead to an increase in bandgap. This O substitution for S might also take place at the surface of CZTS and demonstrate a similar change in the electronic band structure of Cu2ZnSn(S,O)4. The downward band bending also suggests the net negative charge originated from interstitial Oi− at the surface has been mostly compensated, due to a large amount of Na segregation.

We then propose a potential mechanism of the CZTS absorber surface modification when exposed to the ALD-Al2O3 treatment in Fig. 7d. The pristine CZTS absorber after sulfurization had a Na-containing nano-layer when exposed to ambient atmosphere, accompanied by –OH groups on the surface. This nano-layer was Cu-poor, Zn- and Sn-rich compared to the bulk composition, which might be attributed to the oxygenation-induced redistribution of Cu or Na substitution for Cu. When the absorber was subjected to a TMA or Al2O3 treatment, Al2O3 clusters featured by a higher O/Al ratio than the stoichiometric value will form at the initial growth of the ALD process. The resulting excess of oxygen at the interface is speculated to be at least partly present negative charged interstitial Oi−, therefore, attracting interstitial Nai+ from bulk to the interface. Thus, the Al2O3 treated CZTS surface had a thicker Cu-deficiency nano-layer with an even higher concentration of Na and O. The additional Na and O then acted as surfactant and suppressor of non-radiative recombination at the interface of CZTS solar cells, hence reduces the local potential fluctuation of band edges and leads to the widened electrical band gap, hence the improvement in Voc and device performance.

We have demonstrated a champion efficiency of 10.2% for Cd-free CZTS device resulting from the application of an Al2O3 passivation layer prepared by ALD. The ALD-Al2O3 as a passivation layer can greatly enhance the performance of CZTS solar cells by promoting downward band bending, reduced bandgap fluctuation and suppressed defect recombination at the heterojunction interface. Specifically, we showed that TMA plays a key role rather than other ALD sub-steps in the passivation of CZTS/ZnSnO heterojunction. This prompted us to identify the origin of the chemical modification of CZTS surface through different sub-steps of the ALD process. The improvement in Voc resulting from the different ALD treatments was found to be well correlated with the Na variation at the CZTS surface. We then demonstrated that the excess oxygen originating from the initial growth of ALD alumina might explain the enhanced segregation of Na at the CZTS/Al2O3 interface. Finally, a plausible mechanism for the passivation induced by ALD-Al2O3 was proposed. ALD-Al2O3 facilitates the formation of a thicker Cu-deficient nano-layer with a higher concentration of Na and O, forming a homogeneous passivation layer across the CZTS surface. This nano-layer reduces the local potential fluctuation of band edges and leads to the widened electrical band gap, hence the improvement in Voc and device performance.


The CZTS absorbers were prepared by co-sputtering on Mo-coated soda lime glass substrates with a size of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2. The co-sputtering of the CZTS absorber was done from Cu/ZnS/SnS precursors using a magnetron sputtering system (AJA International, Inc., Model ATC-2200) as described in the previous work. ICP-OES confirmed that the composition of CZTS absorbers was Cu-poor (Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.88) and Zn-rich (Zn/Sn = 1.18). The films were then loaded into a closed graphite box with combined elemental sulfur and SnS. Our baseline annealing process was performed at 560 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 for 3 min. After sulfurization, the samples were either stored in a nitrogen box or immediately transferred into the ALD reactor for subsequent treatments. The ALD treatments were done in a Fiji G2 ALD system (Cambridge Nanotech) at a substrate temperature of 150 °C. Al2O3 was directly deposited on the CZTS absorber by using TMA and deionized water as precursors, with argon (Ar) as the carrier gas. Both water and the TMA precursor were kept at room temperature. The ALD process contained an Al:Ar:H2O:Ar cycle with pulse lengths of 0.06:10:0.06:10 s, repeated to obtain the desired thickness. TMA (H2O) treatment was conducted using TMA (H2O) half-cycles while leaving other conditions the same as the Al2O3 deposition. A control sample (“Heat”) was subjected to the identical deposition temperature and reactor ambient with no ALD process running. The parameter details of different ALD processes were listed in Table 2.

After the sulfurization process ALD-ZnSnO layers were synthesized using diethylzinc [Zn(C2H5)2 DEZ, Sigma-Aldrich], tetrakis(diethylamido)tin(IV) [Sn(N(CH3)2)4 or TDMASn, Strem Chemicals] as Zn, Sn precursor, and water as an oxidant. The Zn to Sn sub-cycles with a 3:1 ratio was employed and the substrate temperature was kept at 150 °C. Such conditions contribute to the best performing Cd-free CZTS solar cell based on our previous study. A transparent front contact of i-ZnO/ITO (50 nm/210 nm) bi-layer was then deposited by radio frequency sputtering before Al grids were deposited using evaporation. For the best performing devices, an antireflection coating of 100 nm MgF2 was deposited by thermal evaporation and 0.224 cm2 solar cells were finally defined by mechanical scribing.


The atomic fractions of Sn/(Sn + Zn) of the films on glass substrate were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). XPS data were acquired using an ESCALAB250Xi (Thermo Scientific, UK) under ultra-high vacuum (better than 2 × 10−9 mbar). The X-ray source was a monochromated Al K alpha (energy 1486.68 eV) with binding energy scale calibrated using carbon reference. Depth profiling data were achieved by mildly sputtering the buffer/CZTS surface with 1 keV Ar+ ions over an etching area of 2.5 × 2.5 mm. XPS data were analyzed using Avantage software. For atomic percentage analysis, non-metallic species of aluminum (Al 2s) and oxygen (O 1s) were fitted with symmetric Gaussian/Lorentzian line shapes. The O 1s (Al–O contribution) and Al 2s peak areas were calculated from the curve-fitting. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) data were acquired using an ESCALAB250Xi (Thermo Scientific, UK) under ultra-high vacuum (better than 2 × 10−9 mbar). The excitation energy during the UPS experiment was 21.2 eV. KPFM measurements were taken using an AFM (AIST-NT SmartSPM) in an ambient atmosphere. The data were collected by using a 6 nm radius of curvature (HYDRA6R-100NG-10, APPNANO) with an AC voltage of −1 to +1 V. An external laser source with tunable wavelength and intensity was used to illuminate on the surface of the sample. Laser light with a wavelength of 1300 nm was used for beam deflection to avoid the absorption of the sample under test. Atom probe tomography (APT) was performed on needle shaped specimens with a tip diameter of less than 100 nm. These were prepared using a Zeiss Auriga FEG SEM, equipped with a focused ion beam (FIB). Due to extreme beam damage of the APT specimens, once the diameter of the needle was below 1 μm, an accelerating voltage of less than 5 kV had to be used for imaging and milling in order to avoid any damage. The atom probe measurements were conducted on a Cameca LEAP 4000XSi, at a temperature of ∼50 K, using a pulse frequency of 200 kHz, a pulse energy of 50 pJ and a detection rate of 0.5%. All data sets were reconstructed in IVAS 3.6.18.


The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a solar simulator from PV Measurements at one sun and a Keithley 2400 source meter. EQE data were collected by a QEX10 spectral response system (PV Measurements, Inc.) calibrated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-certified reference Si and Ge photodiodes. The Suns–Voc measurements were performed using a decaying light pulse with a full-width half maximum (FWHM) of about 2 ms from a xenon flash lamp, which enables the quasi-steady state photovoltage Voc to be measured across the p–n junction in the open-circuit condition. The light intensity was monitored by a single-crystal silicon reference cell plotted against Voc. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement was carried out using an impedance analyzer at a frequency of 100 kHz with a DC bias voltage sweeping from −1.5 to 0.5 V. Drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurement was performed with the a.c. amplitude varied from 10 mV to 110 mV and the d.c. bias from −1.6 V to 0.6 V. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a 1/4 m monochromator (Cornerstone 260) equipped with a silicon charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A continuous wave laser (405 nm, 50 mW) was used as the excitation source and the luminescence signal was detected by a CCD. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a Microtime-200 (Picoquant) system. This system was equipped with a 780–800 nm detector and a 470 nm solid-state laser excitation source tuned at a repetition rate of 10 MHz with an incident power of 0.18 W cm−2.
