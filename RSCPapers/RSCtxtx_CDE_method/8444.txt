In this work, dithieno[3,2-a:3′,2′-j][5,6,11,12]chrysene diimides (DTCDI), an electron-deficient π-building block, were firstly incorporated into polymer main chains by using the 3,9-positions of chrysene and the α,α′-positions of thiophene units of DTCDI to connect with the 2,2′-bithiophene unit, affording copolymers P1 and P2, respectively. Due to their different connection ways the two polymers feature different optoelectronic properties.

π-Conjugated polymers have received increasing interest for their potential applications in low-cost, large-area, and flexible optoelectronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). During the past two decades, great progress in π-conjugated polymers has been made in terms of the molecular design, synthesis, physicochemical properties and optoelectronic device performance, as well as their structure–performance relationships, which greatly promotes the development of polymeric semiconductors.

The construction of donor–acceptor (D–A) structures that alternatively combine electron-rich D units and electron-deficient A moieties in the polymer main chain has become a popular and efficient technology for achieving high performance polymeric semiconductors. It is facilely to tune the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, the electronic structure characteristics as well as the intermolecular interactions of D–A copolymers by the selection of appropriate D and A units. The properties of the D–A copolymers are greatly affected by the characteristics of A segments in the polymer backbones. However, only limited novel electron-deficient A building blocks have been developed due to the challenge of molecular design and synthesis. The typical A units for D–A conjugated polymers, including rylene diimide moieties such as perylenediimides (PDI) and naphthalene diimides (NDI), bis-lactam moieties such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo (IID), and the B ← N conjugated units, lag far behind the D moieties. Therefore, more elaborated A building blocks possessing attractive characteristics are highly desirable for constructing high-performance D–A architectures.
For the past ten years, 1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimides (1,4,5,8-NDI) (Fig. 1), a typical class of A unit, have been widely used for constructing D–A conjugated polymers, showing electron-dominating charge transport behaviors. Meanwhile, 1,2,5,6-NDI (Fig. 1), the isomers of 1,4,5,8-NDI, were found to be new A moieties for developing D–A conjugated polymers with hole-dominating charge transport features. Recently, a novel electron-deficient building block, dithieno[3,2-a:3′,2′-j][5,6,11,12]chrysene diimides (DTCDI) (Fig. 1), was developed by our group, which can be regarded as a core-expanded 1,2,5,6-NDI derivative. The advantages of the DTCDI building block include: (i) a π-extended conjugated molecular backbone that could improve the charge carrier transport by effective intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid state; (ii) the twisted molecular π-backbone combined with suitable N-substituted groups could afford solution-processable organic/polymeric semiconductors with multi-dimensional charge transport properties; and (iii) the strong chemical derivatization enables the synthesis of diverse organic/polymeric optoelectronic materials, even two-dimensional polymeric semiconductors. The above features make the DTCDI unit a promising building block for constructing novel organic/polymeric optoelectronic materials. In this manuscript, two D–A copolymers P1 and P2 based on DTCDI (Scheme 1) were synthesized by using two different sets of reaction sites (the 3,9-positions of chrysene and the α,α′-positions of thiophene units, respectively) of DTCDI to react with the 2,2′-bithiophene (TT) unit. The physicochemical properties of P1 and P2 as well as their applications in organic optoelectronic devices were investigated.
As shown in Scheme 1, two different halogenated DTCDI derivatives 1 and 2 were first synthesized. Then the D–A copolymers P1 and P2 were readily prepared via the Stille cross-coupling reaction of 1 and 2 with 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-dithiophene, respectively. Details of the synthesis and purification procedures of monomer 2 and copolymers P1 and P2 are available in the ESI.
The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI, Mw/Mn) values of these two D–A copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) that calibrated against narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI). P1 has Mn and PDI values of 24.3 kDa and 1.6, and was soluble well in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and chloroform at room temperature. P2 showed relatively higher Mn (65.7 kDa) and PDI (3.1) values, and was soluble in warm chlorinated benzenes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data indicated that both P1 and P2 polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of up to 450 °C (Fig. S3, ESI). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data (Fig. S4, ESI) showed that P1 has endotherm and exotherm transitions at about 280 °C and 245 °C, respectively, while no endotherm or exotherm transitions were observed for P2 from the entire scanning range of repeated heating–cooling DSC cycles between room temperature and 350 °C (Fig. S5, ESI).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 in dichloromethane and P2 in chlorobenzene solution are displayed in Fig. 2, and the related optical data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). As shown in Fig. 2, P1 and P2 both show two main absorption bands from 300 nm to 800 nm. The former absorption band in the high energy region from 300 nm to 500 nm can be attributed to the delocalized excitonic π–π* transition, and the low energy region from 500 nm to 800 nm can be assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the D and A units in the polymeric main chain. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) for P1 and P2 in the low energy region were located at 607 nm and 638 nm, respectively, with optical band gaps of 1.76 eV and 1.63 eV. From solution to as spin-coated films, P1 shows widened absorption with red shifts of about 30 nm for the onset absorption edge (Fig. S6, ESI), while the absorption of P2 does not exhibit obvious change (Fig. S7, ESI).
To understand the relationship between the molecular structure and the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of P1 and P2, their HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, the long side chains were replaced by methyl groups, and the trimers were utilized to represent the polymeric backbone in order to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 3, the electron density distributions of the LUMO of P1 and P2 are mainly localized on the central 1,2,5,6-NDI cores. The electron density wave functions of the HOMO of P1 are largely distributed on the TT units, while those of the HOMO of P2 are relatively homogeneously delocalized over the entire conjugated thiophene moieties. The results indicate that the HOMO electron density distributions are greatly affected by the different connected positions of the DTCDI unit. The calculations also predict a more twisted conformation of P1 with a torsional angle of ∼34.99° between the thiophene ring of TT and the benzothiophene unit of DTCDI (Fig. S8, ESI). The corresponding torsional angle of P2 is relatively smaller (∼23.45°). Therefore, the main chain of P1 is more twisted than that of P2, which could partly explain the relative better solubility and larger optical band gap of P1 than those of P2. Meanwhile, the calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are −5.28/−3.26 eV and −5.07/−3.20 eV, respectively. P1 and P2 have comparable LUMO energy values, but the HOMO energy levels of P1 shift downward 0.21 eV versus that of P2, thus P1 has a larger energy gap (2.02 eV) than P2 (1.87 eV). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements performed on the thin films of P1 and P2 (Fig. S9, ESI) display quasi-reversible reduction and irreversible oxidation processes for both P1 and P2. Based on the CV results, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −6.05/−4.01 eV and −5.76/−3.96 eV for P1 and P2, respectively (Table S1, ESI). Although the HOMO/LUMO data are different from those obtained by DFT calculations, the overall trend is consistent.
To investigate the charge transport properties of P1 and P2, their bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) thin-film OFET devices were fabricated by the spin-coating method (see the ESI for details). All the OFET devices were tested under a nitrogen atmosphere and the device performance data of P1 and P2 are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, OFET devices based on P1 show typical n-channel charge transport behaviors. When annealed at 200 °C, a thin-film OFET device based on P1 exhibits an electron mobility (μe) of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a current on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of about 106. As shown in Table S3 and Fig. S10 (ESI), OFET devices based on P2 exhibit ambipolar charge transport characteristics, both the electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh) manifested a stepwise improvement with the thin-film annealing temperatures ranging from 80 to 200 °C, affording μe and μh values of up to 1.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and Ion/Ioff ratios of about 104.
To investigate the microstructures as well as the morphology of the neat films of P1 and P2, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to probe their film features. For the thin films of both P1 and P2, the enhanced first order diffraction peaks in XRD patterns (Fig. S11, ESI) and the improved film morphology in AFM images (Fig. S12, ESI) are well in accordance with the stepwise improved device performance. It should be noted that P1 and P2 display distinct charge transport behaviors due to the different connection positions of their DTCDI units. The DTCDI-3,9-connected P1 with relatively lower LUMO and HOMO energy levels exhibits unipolar n-channel charge transport behavior, while DTCDI-thiophene-α,α′-connected P2 with a relatively higher HOMO energy level shows ambipolar charge transport characteristics. In spite of the less coplanar backbone of P1 (vs.P2), its lower and more extended LUMO and larger grain sizes (vs.P2) in thin films revealed by AFM might explain its higher electron mobility in OFETs.
In consideration of the strong and broad absorption, the low-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels, the high electron mobility, as well as the high solubility, P1 would be a potential polymeric electron acceptor material for all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). By using PTB7-Th (Fig. S13, ESI) and P1 as the electron donor and acceptor, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) all-PSCs were fabricated in an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:P1/MoO3/Ag. High boiling point 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to optimize the blend film morphology and the device performance. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices are shown in Fig. 5, the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table S4 (ESI). As shown in Table S4 (ESI), all-PSCs based on P1 and PTB7-Th exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 4.15% without thermal annealing treatment and processing solvent additives. Most importantly, after adding 1% (v/v) DIO as a processing solvent additive, the device performance significantly increased with an impressive PCE value of 7.52% (one of the highest PCE values for all-PSCs), a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.43 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 61.1%. The EQE plots display a broad photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm, in which the EQE values reached over 45% at 432 nm and nearly 60% at 632 nm (Fig. 5b). It is noteworthy that the photon energy losses (Eloss) of these all-PSCs are around 0.57 eV, to the best of our knowledge, this value is among the smallest Eloss reported for all-PSCs.
The μh and μe values of the optimized blend films were estimated by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, and the J–V curves of the hole-only device and the electron-only device are shown in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI), respectively. The average μh and μe for the blend films are 1.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.58, the relatively balanced hole and electron mobilities are beneficial to the high device performance.
The top surface and bulk morphology of the as-cast and optimized polymer blend films were characterized by AFM (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S18, ESI). As shown in Fig. 6, both the as-cast blend films and the optimized blend films with 1% (v/v) DIO are quite smooth with a small root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.07 and 1.33 nm, respectively. The optimized blend films show obvious uniform fibril-like nanostructures that are conducive to the formation of interpenetrating networks and better phase separation (Fig. S18a and c, ESI). These morphology features are beneficial to efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, and thus yield higher Jsc and FF values. The XRD patterns (Fig. S16, ESI) of the blend films show no diffraction peak. The exceptional performance of P1-based all-PSCs can be attributed to the combination of the favorable morphology features and high balanced hole- and electron-transport capability of the blend films.
In summary, the twisted molecular backbone and strong chemical derivatization of the DTCDI unit make it a versatile building block for developing diverse solution-processable organic/polymeric optoelectronic materials. The optoelectronic properties of DTCDI-based materials can be fine tuned by suitable chemical modifications of the DTCDI unit. DTCDI-3,9-connected P1 exhibits unipolar n-channel charge transport characteristics with μe of up to 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and all-PSCs with P1 as the acceptor achieved a PCE value of 7.52% without any post-treatment, while DTCDI-thiophene-α,α′-connected P2 displays ambipolar charge transport properties with both hole and electron mobilities of about 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, DTCDI would be a versatile electron-deficient building block for constructing high performance, multifunctional, and even two-dimensional organic/polymeric optoelectronic materials.
