Using a ternary blend consisting of two donors/one acceptor or one donor/two acceptors is a potential strategy to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, ternary PSCs based on PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F blends have been investigated by employing narrow bandgap O6T-4F as a second acceptor. Our studies indicate that introduction of 20% O6T-4F in the acceptor moiety can increase the PCE from 9.5% for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) cell to 10.5% for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) cell. The enhancement is attributed to a compromise between the increased short-circuit current (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the decreased fill factor (FF) with addition of the O6T-4F acceptor. It is shown that O6T-4F lowers the energy loss (Eloss) occurring in the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) blend, leading to a higher VOC of the ternary PSCs with regard to the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F PSCs. Eloss is decreased from 0.80 eV for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) blend to 0.61 eV for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blend. At the same time, the addition of the O6T-4F acceptor reduces the aggregation of the PBDB-T donor in the ternary blends. Ultra-fast transient absorption demonstrates that the hole transfer and subsequent carrier recombination occur faster in the ternary blend than in the PBDB-T:IT-4F blend, which accounts for a slightly decreased FF in the ternary PSCs.

As a potential renewable energy source featuring easy and cheap device processing, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have continued to attract great research interest in the past decades. Soluble fullerene derivatives have been previously employed as electron acceptors to fabricate PSCs due to their superior electron-acceptor ability, high electron mobilities and isotropic charge transport. However, limited by their inevitable disadvantages including weak absorption in the visible region and hard to tune energy levels, fullerene acceptor-based PSCs encounter bottlenecks in enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Non-fullerene organic molecule acceptors have been developed to replace fullerene-based acceptors since they possess significant advantages such as tunable energy levels and strong absorption in the visible or near-infrared region with regard to fullerene derivatives. The PCEs of single junction non-fullerene PSCs have exceeded 16% by employing the non-fullerene acceptor Y6 series. More recently PCEs up to 18% have been achieved based on narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors. At the same time, the photovoltaic performance of large-area and flexible PSCs has also been enhanced by using non-fullerene acceptors.

Besides developing novel donor and acceptor materials, the ternary strategy has demonstrated its advantages in boosting the PCE of PSCs. One of the advantages of a ternary blend is to strengthen the spectral coverage of the active layer in the solar spectrum by employing donor and acceptor materials with complementary absorption profiles, which thus leads to an increased short circuit current (JSC). Up to now, some narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors have been developed and used successfully to increase JSC in ternary PSCs. The introduction of a third component in a binary blend may bring morphological changes and result in an improved PCE. Chen et al. reported efficient ternary PSCs by using weak crystalline acceptor IEICO-4F to optimize the domain sizes of PBDB-T:HF-PCIC blends. The ternary blend also brings about more complex morphologies and the related photovoltaic conversion process. For example, Wei et al. found that the ternary DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-E:PC71BM blend would experience morphological variances by post annealing from alloy to cascade model, which resulted in a higher photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices. It has been proved that the ternary strategy is also promising in reducing the energy loss (Eloss), thus leading to a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) for PSCs. Wang et al. successfully fabricated high-efficiency ternary PSCs with larger VOC and smaller energy loss than the binary counterparts. Despite these merits, deep understanding of ternary PSCs based on different blends is still required for researchers due to the complicated morphology and photophysical behaviors. Since the blend morphology is directly correlated with exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination processes in photovoltaic devices, figuring out the relationship between the blend morphology and photophysical behavior is the key to further improve the PCE of ternary cells.
Here, we have fabricated a kind of ternary PSCs by incorporating a near-infrared acceptor O6T-4F into the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F blend. The optimized ternary PSC demonstrates an increased PCE of 10.53%, a high VOC of 0.749 V, and a large JSC of 20.31 mA cm−2 compared to the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) control cell. Eloss is decreased from 0.80 eV for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) blend to 0.61 eV for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blend, which helps to increase VOC from 0.722 V for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) cell to 0.749 V for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) cell. The addition of the O6T-4F acceptor weakens the aggregation of the PBDB-T donor in the ternary blends and ultra-fast transient absorption shows that that leads to faster hole transfer in the ternary blend than in the PBDB-T:IT-4F blend; however, the subsequent carrier recombination also occurs faster, accounting for a slightly decreased fill factor (FF) in the ternary PSCs.

The device configuration and molecular structures of the PBDB-T donor, IT-4F acceptor and O6T-4F acceptor are shown in Fig. 1a. A conventional device structure is used to fabricate the binary or ternary PSCs, where PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br serve as the hole-transporting and electron-transporting layers, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the normalized absorption spectra of the PBDB-T, IT-4F and O6T-4F neat films with their dominant absorption peaks at 630, 720 and 850 nm, respectively. The energy levels of these active materials are presented in Fig. 1c according to previous literature. It can be seen that the LUMO level offsets between the donor (PBDB-T) and the acceptors (IT-4F and O6T-4F) are about 0.60 eV, large enough for efficient exciton dissociation and electron transfer from the donor to the acceptors. The HOMO level offsets between the donor and the acceptors are at least 0.11 eV for hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor.

We have fabricated a series of PSCs with various IT-4F/O6T-4F weight ratios while keeping the donor (PBDB-T)/acceptor (IT-4F + O6T-4F) weight ratio at 1:1. The detailed photovoltaic parameters for the prepared binary and ternary PSCs are summarized in Table 1 and their J–V curves under illumination are plotted in Fig. 2a. The binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) PSC shows a VOC of 0.722 V, a JSC of 18.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.716, leading to a PCE of 9.48%, while the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) device gives a VOC of 0.775 V, a JSC of 16.84 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.56 and a final PCE of 7.31%. It is noted that the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) device shows a higher VOC than that of the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) device. However, the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) device shows a lower JSC compared to the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) device in spite of its broader absorption than the PBDB-T:IT-4F blend. The FF of the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) device is also low compared to the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) PSC. With the increase of the O6T-4F content in the ternary blend, the resultant ternary PSCs show gradually increased VOC. However, the FF of the PSCs gradually decreases when increasing the O6T-4F content. JSC increases from 18.35 mA cm−2 for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) device to the highest 20.76 mA cm−2 for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.6:0.4) device, and then gradually declines. The highest PCE of 10.53% is achieved for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) device due to a compromise among the VOC, JSC and FF of the PSCs. The trend of the photovoltaic parameters for the PSCs is plotted as a function of the O6T-4F content in the acceptor component in Fig. S1 (ESI).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of all these devices are shown in Fig. 2b and the integrated values of JSC from the EQE spectrum are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the EQE response is gradually broadened when adding more O6T-4F in the acceptor component. With 20% O6T-4F in the acceptor component, the EQE response at 800–960 nm originating from the second O6T-4F acceptor is increased while the spectral response in a range of 300–800 nm is almost unchanged compared to the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) control device, which leads to an obvious JSC increment. The EQE response at 800–1000 nm can be increased with further increasing the O6T-4F content over 40%. However, the spectral response at 300–800 nm remarkably declined, bringing about JSC not being increased or even decreased. The absorption characteristics of the ternary blend may be one of the origins causing such spectral response changes. The absorption spectra of the blends with different acceptor ratios are given in Fig. S2a (ESI). The absorption spectra show an obvious downtrend at 300–770 nm and an uptrend at 770–1000 nm when increasing the O6T-4F content in the acceptor component. The PL quenching status of PBDB-T and IT-4F in different blend films also has been tested and the curves are given in Fig. S2(b and c) (ESI). These results indicate that excitons generated in PBDB-T or IT-4F can be dissociated completely in different blend films.
The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of different blend films were calculated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The calculated results are listed in Table 1. μh and μe for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) blend are 2.1 × 10−4 and 2.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while they are 1.94 × 10−4 and 2.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend. When a combination of IT-4F and O6T-4F is used as the acceptor component, both μh and μe are decreased in the resultant ternary blends. μh and μe are 1.65 × 10−4 and 2.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blend, respectively, higher than the other ternary blends. It should be noted that the hole and electron mobilities are moderate and balanced in the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend; however, the resultant binary device shows the lowest FF. We have investigated the charge carrier recombination status in these PSCs by measuring the dependence of JSC on the incident light intensity (Plight) and the results are shown in Fig. 2c. According to the equation JSC ∝ Palight, bimolecular recombination is more suppressed when a is closer to 1. The exponential factor a is 0.953 for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) device, which is higher than 0.930 for the optimized ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) device and 0.912 for the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) device. It indicates that the bimolecular recombination would increase with the O6T-4F content. This phenomenon coincides with the FF trend of the devices as discussed above. It implies that bimolecular recombination may play a more important role in determining the FF than the charge carrier mobilities in the blend films. The dependence of VOC on Plight is also measured to explore the relationship between bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination in different blend films. Usually, the slope will be close to 1kT/q when bimolecular recombination is dominant. It would be close to 2kT/q when trap-assisted recombination is dominant. Within the light intensity range from 1 to 100 mW cm−2, the calculated slopes are 1.19kT/q for the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) device and 1.08kT/q for the optimized ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) device. It may imply that the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the optimized ternary device is slightly lowered compared with that in the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F device. However, the slope for the PBDB-T:O6T-4F device is lower than 1kT/q (about 0.93kT/q). The origin is not clear and such a phenomenon is considered to be caused by surface recombination in other research.
It is mentioned above that VOC for the PBDB-T:O6T-4F based device (ca. 0.78 V) is higher than the PBDB-T:IT-4F based device (ca. 0.72 V) though O6T-4F and IT-4F have quite similar LUMO levels. It may be caused by the quite different energy loss (Eloss) in these devices. Eloss is calculated by using the equation: Eloss = Eg − qVOC, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 2. The Eg values of different blend films are obtained referring to a previously reported method as illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI).Eloss is estimated to be ca. 0.80 eV in the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F device. Owing to a narrower bandgap of O6T-4F and a higher VOC, Eloss is only 0.48 eV in the PBDB-T:O6T-4F based device. With the addition of 20% O6T-4F in the acceptor, Eloss is reduced to 0.61 eV in the optimized ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) device and VOC is also increased to 0.75 V.

2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to investigate the film morphologies. The 2D diffraction patterns for the blend and neat films are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 (ESI), respectively. The corresponding profiles extracted along the qxy axes (in-plane) and qz axes (out-of-plane) are plotted in Fig. 3d. As shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S4c (ESI), the neat O6T-4F film exhibits several strong scattering peaks, indicating its good crystallization ability as reported by Ding et al. The neat IT-4F film does not show an obvious characteristic scattering peak, implying that IT-4F tends to be amorphous in the spin-coated film. As for the neat PBDB-T film, obvious (100) diffraction peaks at qxy = 3.0 nm−1 in the in-plane direction and at qz = 3.3 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction are observed. A characteristic (010) peak at qz = 17.5 nm−1 is also presented in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the edge-on and face-on orientation co-exist in the neat PBDB-T film. However, only the diffraction peaks of PBDB-T are observed in the three kinds of blend films in Fig. 3 and there is no obvious diffraction signal from O6T-4F for the binary PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) and ternary PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blends despite its good crystallization ability. This phenomenon can be attributed to phase separation of the blend which is dominated by PBDB-T crystallization. It can also be seen that the scattering intensity of PBDB-T is significantly reduced for the blend films when more O6T-4F is introduced. This result illustrates that introduction of O6T-4F could disrupt the aggregation of PBDB-T in the blend films.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were also carried out to investigate the blend morphologies as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) film is about 2.8 nm. The RMS roughness is reduced to 2.5 nm for the PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blend and 2.4 nm for the PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend. In Fig. S5d (ESI), fiber-like domains can be seen in the PBDB-T:IT-4F phase image, which may be accounted for by phase separation dominated by PBDB-T. The fiber-like domain is reduced in the PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blend (Fig. S5e, ESI) and nearly disappears in the PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend (Fig. S5f, ESI). These results also demonstrate that the aggregation of PBDB-T is weakened by O6T-4F.
As discussed above, the PSCs based on the representative PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1), PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) and PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blends exhibit quite different FF values, demonstrating different charge extraction capabilities in these films. Figuring out the ultrafast photophysical processes occurring in these blend films may help to disclose the charge generation and recombination status in these blend films. Transient absorption (TA) measurements were carried out to investigate the ultrafast charge transfer and recombination status in the representative PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1), PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) and PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend films. The evolution of the ground state bleaching (GSB) spectra of PBDB-T in different blend films and extracted dynamic decays are shown in Fig. 4. Their detailed TA spectra are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). The excitation wavelength is fixed at 750 nm to excite the acceptor only for all the blend films. According to the steady absorption spectra of the neat films given in Fig. 1b, the presented negative absorption (ΔA) in a range of 580–640 nm belongs to GSB of PBDB-T. In Fig. 4d, the GSB decay for the PBDB-T donor is selected at 590 nm, at which both the IT-4F and the O6T-4F acceptor exhibit low absorption. Since PBDB-T is not excited at 750 nm, the presented GSB signal from PBDB-T is attributed to hole transfer from IT-4F or/and O6T-4F. As shown in Fig. 4d, the GSB signal is quickly increased for all the three blend films, indicating efficient hole transfer from the acceptors to PBDB-T. The hole transfer time is estimated to be 2 ps, 1 ps and less than 0.2 ps (<IRF) for the PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F blends with ratios of 1:1:0, 1:0.8:0.2 and 1:0:1, respectively, by fitting the rise signal of their GSB kinetics at 590 nm. The rising signals at several picoseconds for the PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) and PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blends are mainly due to exciton diffusion in large domains of the acceptors. However, in the PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend films, the rising signal is fastest, illustrating intimate mixing between the donor and the acceptor. This phenomenon is consistent with the morphologies discussed above. The subsequent recovery of GSB on a long time scale corresponds to charge carrier recombination. The long-lived component lifetime can be estimated to be 32 ns, 25 ns and 7 ns for the PBDB-T:IT-4F:O6T-4F blends with ratios of 1:1:0, 1:0.8:0.2 and 1:0:1, respectively. The slowest GSB recovery in the PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) blend film means that the photogenerated charge carriers have a long lifetime and thus can be extracted efficiently, leading to a high FF. Meanwhile, in the PBDB-T:O6T-4F (1:1) blend, the GSB recovery is very fast, implying that the charge carriers cannot be totally swept out in time. These results can be correlated to their blend morphologies as discussed above. The small phase separation in the PBDB-T:O6T-4F blend is not favorable for charge extraction and thus leads to a low EQE and FF in the corresponding device.

In summary, we have fabricated a kind of ternary PSCs by adding a narrow bandgap acceptor O6T-4F into typical binary PBDB-T:IT-4F blends to broaden the spectral response. It is found that a ternary PSC containing 20% O6T-4F in the acceptor moiety shows an increased PCE compared to the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F cell. A small amount of O6T-4F in the ternary blend is favorable to increase JSC and VOC; however, the FF is slightly lowered. It is shown that O6T-4F lowers Eloss occurring in the binary PBDB-T:IT-4F (1:1) blend, leading to a higher VOC of the ternary PSC with regard to binary PBDB-T:IT-4F PSCs. Ultra-fast photophysical studies show that the hole transfer and subsequent charge carrier recombination occur faster in the ternary blend than in the PBDB-T:IT-4F blend due to the different blend morphologies.


The PSCs were fabricated with a traditional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The materials of PBDB-T, IT-4F and PFN-Br were bought from Solarmer Ltd. The O6T-4F acceptor was bought from One Materials Ltd. All these materials were used as received without further purification. The ITO glass substrates (sheet resistance of 10 Ohm per square) were cleaned sequentially with detergent, acetone, and ethanol. The ITO glass substrates were then dried and UV-ozone-treated for 25 minutes before PEDOT:PSS deposition. The PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) films were prepared by spin coating at 3000 rpm to produce a 35 nm-thick hole transport layer on the substrates. The PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were annealed at 140 °C in air for 20 minutes. PBDB-T, IT-4F and O6T-4F were dissolved in their respective chlorobenzene solution with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and stirred at 70 °C for 8 hours. The target blend solutions were obtained by mixing different volumes of the individual solutions. The additive of 0.5% DIO (v/v) was added just 30 minutes before the spin coating process. The spinning speed was fixed at 2500 rpm for 1 min to obtain an about 100 nm-thick active layer. The samples were annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes. A thin PFN-Br cathode buffer layer was deposited on the active layer by spin coating its solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in methanol) at 3500 rpm for 30 seconds. The 100 nm Al cathode was thermally deposited at a base pressure of 1 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of a PSC device is 8 mm2.

The J–V curves were measured in an N2 atmosphere with a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 illumination provided by an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Newport, AAA). The EQE measurements were carried out on a QE-R3011 (Enlitech Ltd). The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the films were recorded on an Agilent Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer and PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorometer, respectively. The hole and electron mobilities of various active layers were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only devices have a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/MOO3 (10 nm)/Ag and the electron-only devices have a structure of ITO/PEIE (5 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/PFN-Br (5 nm)/Al. 2D grazing incidence X-ray diffraction characterization was performed at BL 1W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The thin film samples were prepared on silicon wafer substrates. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements were performed using quartz substrates with encapsulation. A Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier is used to produce one beam of the pump pulse (750 nm) with an optical parametric amplifier and the other white light beam probe pulse using sapphire or proprietary crystals. The spectra were measured using a Helios Fire TA spectrometer with an 8 ns delay stage. The TA spectra were processed by removing noise, subtracting the background and scattered light, and chirp correction before dynamics analysis.
