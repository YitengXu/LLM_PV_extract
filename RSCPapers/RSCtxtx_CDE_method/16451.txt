Non-fullerene organic solar cells employing small molecule acceptors have recently crossed the PCE of 17% through the design and synthesis of efficient acceptor materials. One of the greatest advantages of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is the tunability of the absorption spectrum, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels and solubility via molecular engineering. Electron deficient chromophoric groups play an important role in the synthesis of efficient non-fullerene acceptors. End groups enhance the absorption, electron acceptor properties and overall performance of a molecule as an acceptor after attaching with a π-conjugated backbone. In this review, a number of NFAs are highlighted focusing on the effect of terminal chromophoric groups on the overall performance of organic photovoltaic devices.

Fossil fuels such as natural gases, petroleum, and coal have become the major energy sources in the last few centuries. Fossil energy sources are limited and after burning produce CO2 and other pollutant chemicals. Therefore, the development of clean, green, and renewable energy sources is one of the most important research topics in the 21st century. Biomass, wind power, fuel cells and solar energy are the most promising energy generation technologies for the production of renewable energy. Conversion of solar energy into electrical energy is one of the most interesting fields in the research area. Currently, inorganic solar cells such as silicon solar cells have a dominant position in industrial production, having a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 44.4%. However, these inorganic solar cells have major limitations in terms of high cost materials, environmental toxicity, operating solar panel weight and complex fabrication processes. Organic π-conjugated materials have the capability of absorbing photons from the UV-visible region of the solar spectrum and convert them into electrical energy in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The photovoltaic performance of organic materials can be easily improved by tuning the energy of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels and increasing the conjugation of molecules via molecular engineering. Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention in the research area due to their potential advantages such as light weight, low production cost, ease of engineering and processing, flexible device fabrication and higher absorption coefficients of molecules. Nowadays, the field of OPV cells has been dominated by solution processable bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a PCE of up to 12%. In BHJ solar cells, donor and acceptor materials are sandwiched between two different electrode layers such as tin doped indium oxide (ITO) (anode) and a metal like aluminum (cathode). In BHJ solar cells, p-type (donor) and n-type (acceptor) semiconductor materials are mixed together to form an active layer which increases the interfacial area between the donor and acceptor and minimizes the travelling distance of excitons that are responsible for reducing the charge recombination of excitons resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of OPV cells. In solution processed BHJ solar cells, excitons (holes and electrons bound together via electrostatic attraction force) are generated by the absorption of photons and these excitons migrate towards the donor/acceptor interfacial layer. At the interface, excitons dissociate into free charge carriers (holes and electrons) and transport via the donor–acceptor interfacial layer to the respective electrodes (anode and cathode) and charges are collected at the corresponding electrode resulting in the generation of electrical power (Fig. 1). During the past few decades, the OPV research field has been dominated by polymer donor and fullerene derivative (acceptor) based bulk heterojunction solar cells. A variety of polymer and small molecule donors were employed in fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs. Among them a selection of polymer donor molecules which we discussed in this review are presented in Fig. 2 and their optoelectronic properties are summarized in Table 1. Until a few years ago, fullerene derivatives had been predominantly used as acceptors in OSCs because of their superior charge transport properties, but fullerene derivatives have suffered from some intrinsic shortcomings such as high production cost, weak light harvesting properties, low optical absorption coefficients, difficulty of purification, and poor tunability of band gaps. To overcome these disadvantages in recent years, research on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has progressed rapidly and developed outstanding performance OSCs with a PCE of up to 17%. The significant advantages like low cost production, easily tunable FMO energy levels, straightforward synthesis procedures and easy purification, high molar extinction coefficients and light harvesting properties of small molecules make them potential molecular alternatives to fullerene acceptors. However, still a clear guideline is needed to design efficient NFAs.

In this review article, we aim to compare the performances of reported calamitic type NFAs based on different types of chromophoric end groups (Fig. 3) and try to provide some useful information about the effect of a particular end group on the overall performance of NFAs for further development in this field. The introduction of different chromophoric groups enhances the light absorption, electron affinity and photovoltaic performance of organic molecules as acceptors. The device performance of different acceptors varies depending upon the types of terminal end groups according to their electron withdrawing capability and it can be further improved via molecular engineering at terminal units. There are a few points that have been mentioned in this review.
(1) Detailed information about different types of NFAs has been provided in several reviews. This review article mainly focuses on calamitic type small molecule NFAs with a structural configuration of A–π–D–π–A and the data are summarized in the tabular form.
(2) All the NFAs are classified and discussed on the basis of having the same chromophoric groups as terminal units. Such a type of comparison should be easier for readers to get guidelines to design their own acceptors or enhance the performance of existing NFAs via molecular engineering.
Calamitic type small molecules are a promising class of NFAs, which include three different structural units comprising the central core (weak electron donor) flanked with another donor or acceptor group (linker/spacer) and a terminal acceptor unit. Calamitic shape NFAs with an electron deficient (acceptor) core such as benzothiadiazole are reported and these materials have shown lower photovoltaic performance compared to those of NFAs with an electron rich central core.

Rhodanine derivatives (rhodanine units with different alkyl chains) are commonly used chromophoric groups in the synthesis of dye molecules and donor (p-type semiconductor) materials for OSCs (Fig. 3). Rhodanine is an electron withdrawing group which increases the electron deficient character at the periphery of molecules because of the electronegative carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups and the solubility of molecules can be controlled by altering the amide alkyl chain. The rhodanine group enhances the conjugation of molecules and reduces the band gap which can cause a bathochromic shift (red shift) in the UV-visible absorption profile of molecules. Short circuit current density (Jsc) depends on the optoelectronic properties of molecules such as the optical band gap, absorption coefficient and charge carrier mobility of photoactive materials. The shape of IPCE/EQE curves is dependent on the absorption spectrum of the active layer as well as its absorption coefficient. The Jsc can be measured by integration of EQE spectra over the wavelength range of the absorption combined with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. Hence with increasing absorption the Jsc value increases and finally increases the PCE of solar cells. The non-planar molecular structures of rhodanine based NFAs have non-anisotropic charge transport and a reduced crystalline tendency which is useful to prevent the formation of large crystalline domains in the BHJ composite film over extended lifetimes. During the past few years chemists have introduced rhodanine as the terminal end group to provide n-type semiconductor materials for OPV.

A MPU1 NFA based on the DPP core coupled with 3-ethyl rhodanine end groups via the thiophene spacer was designed and synthesized by Langa et al. This acceptor molecule has strong and broad absorption in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm and a low band gap (1.48 eV). The OSC based on the P3HT:MPU1 and P:MPU1 blend exhibited a PCE of 2.16% and 7.52%, respectively. Lim and co-workers reported two novel small molecules Cz-RH and Flu-RH by applying carbazole and fluorene as central building blocks, 3-ethyl rhodanine as the terminal end group and thiophene as the π-bridge to use as electron acceptors in solution processed OSCs (Fig. 4). BHJ solar cells based on P3HT:Cz-RH and P3HT:Flu-RH blend films after thermal annealing treatment showed a promising PCE of 2.56% and 3.08%, respectively. Their higher LUMO energy levels well matching with the P3HT donor are responsible for achieving high Voc and PCE. Holiday and co-workers explored a new small molecule acceptor FBR via replacing the thiophene spacer in Flu-RH NFA with a strong electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole (BT) linker to connect the fluorene core and 3-ethyl rhodanine terminal acceptor unit. By insertion of the BT unit, the FMO energy level of the molecule can be tuned easily and the electron affinity can be increased. The LUMO energy level of FBR is higher lying than PC61BM and for such types of acceptors P3HT is a suitable donor material. To achieve a high open circuit voltage (Voc) it is necessary that the LUMO level of the acceptor should be as high lying as possible allowing for electron transfer from the donor. Without any additional treatment the BHJ OSCs based on the P3HT:FBR film yielded a PCE of 4.11%. Our group recently explored new NFA FRd2 by introducing furan as an additional π-spacer in the FBR molecule (Fig. 4). Extended conjugation by the furan unit results in red shifted absorption spectra, a reduced band gap and an improved PCE of 9.4% when blended with the PTB7-Th donor. A 3D structured NFA having spiro fluorene as the central core and rhodanine as the terminal acceptor unit (SF-OR) was developed by Chen and co-workers. SF-OR gives PCE over 4.66% when combined with the P3HT donor material. NFAs containing four or more fused-rings in their central donor (ladder type) units show enlarged absorption profiles towards a longer wavelength region, efficient intramolecular charge transfer, appropriate aggregation and crystallinity. Zhan et al. presented a novel A–D–A structured NFA (IDT-2BR) bearing 5 fused heterocyclic ring-containing indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the core flanked by benzothiadiazole (BT) and rhodanine as terminal chromophoric groups. It has strong absorption in the 300 to 750 nm wavelength region and suitable FMO energy levels matching with those of the donor molecule. The OSC based on the blend of the P3HT donor and IDT-2BR exhibited PCEs of up to 5.12% with a FF of 68.1%. Further, more NFAs were explored for OSCs by doing modifications at the central IDT core and employing different spacer units in the IDT-2BR molecule. Holiday and co-workers developed two NFAs O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR using the same core as in IDT-2BR with different alkyl chains. Compared to IDT-2BR both NFAs showed red shifted absorption in the range of 550 nm to 830 nm. These two acceptors exhibited the best PCEs from 6% to 6.3%, indicating that the alkyl chains have significant effects on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties in IDT-BR based systems. Zhou et al. developed a novel NFA (BTA1) first using the benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) linker in place of the BT spacer in the IDT-2BR acceptor molecule. BTA is a strong electron withdrawing group and it reduces the band gap and due to the absence of the S atom it reduces the charge recombination in OSCs. Non-fullerene OSCs based on the P3HT:BTA1 blend film exhibited a PCE of up to 5.24%. Chen and co-workers designed and synthesized another indacenodithiophene (IDT) core based NFA containing 3-octyl rhodanine as the end group and thiophene fused benzothiadiazole (BTT) as the π-linker (Fig. 4). Introduction of a fused thiophene ring into the spacer group stabilized the quinoid resonating structure of acceptor A1 and the additional carbonyl group on the fused thiophene ring decreases the potential energy of the system, reduces the band gap and shifts the absorption spectrum of the molecule toward a higher wavelength. The OSC device based on the PTB7-Th:A1 active layer gave a PCE of 5.79%. The rhodanine flanking group mainly serves the purpose of extending the conjugation, tuning the molecular energy levels and further reducing the band gap. Zhou and co-workers developed two NFAs (Qx1 and Qx1b) using IDT with different alkyl side chains as the core, quinoxaline (strong electron acceptor) as the π-bridge acceptor and rhodanine as the terminal acceptor. Qx1 and Qx1b acceptors offered a PCE of 4.03% and 4.81% when fabricated with the P3HT donor material, respectively. Zheng and co-workers developed a NFA (DTNR) using angular shaped thieno naphthalene as the central donor flanked with the 3-ethylrhodanine end group attached via the benzothiadiazole spacer. The OSC based on the DTNR acceptor and polymer donor PTB7-Th achieved a PCE of 9.51% with a Voc of 1.08 V (Table 2).

The CN group enhances the electron deficiency in the molecule via its electronegative sp hybridized C and N atoms and improves the electron accepting properties of the molecule (Fig. 2). The CN group increases the conjugation of the molecule and red shifts the absorption spectrum after attaching to the π-conjugated backbone, without disturbing the planarity of the molecule. However, the electron deficient units attached with the CN group behave as electron traps to transfer the electron from the donor to the acceptor. Thus the electron deficient unit attached with CN is the barrier for the electron injection to the cathode which is beneficial for a red shift of the absorption profile. In such cases the matching of the acceptor with the π-spacer is important; for example for the strong electron withdrawing CN unit the use of an electron rich unit as a linker may be beneficial to reduce the electron trapping effect, resulting in the improved photovoltaic performance of molecules. The electron withdrawing CN group improves the photovoltaic performance and lowers the energy of FMO energy levels, which leads to reduction of energy loss during the charge transfer process and enhanced Voc of the molecule. Chen et al. presented an NFA using the fluorene core and thiophene-2-carbonitrile end units attached via the thiophene diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) linker. This molecule showed broad absorption in the 550–750 nm range and a narrow band gap (1.66 eV). A PSC based on P3HT as the donor and F8-DPPTCN as the acceptor gave a PCE of 2.37%. Aso and co-workers developed a series of NFAs (MHPI-BTCN, PHPI-BTCN, NpPI-BTCN, F4PI-BTCN, and F4PI-(BTCN)2) using different substituents on the N atom of cyclic imide and carbonitrile as the terminal unit attached via the benzothiadiazole unit (Fig. 5). All acceptors were fabricated with an inverted device structure using P3HT as the donor and a maximum PCE of up to 0.32% was observed. Yoshida and co-workers reported a benzothiadiazole core based acceptor attached with the CN end group via thiophene and benzene spacers. Its photovoltaic performance was investigated with the P3HT donor and it turned out that the OPV device based on BTD-CN exhibited a PCE of 0.86% (Table 3).

2-(3-Oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) (IC) is the most widely used flanking group in NFAs for OSCs (Fig. 2). IC is a highly electronegative group having a malononitrile group at the 1st position. IC shifts the absorption profile of the molecule towards a higher wavelength (red shift) via extending π-conjugation, reduces the band gap, and increases the electron deficient properties and photovoltaic performance of the molecule as an acceptor. During the past few years chemists have adopted IC as the terminal electron withdrawing group attached with different π-conjugated backbones to provide efficient n-type semiconductor (acceptor) materials and further modification was also made at the IC unit to adjust molecular orbitals and develop efficient acceptors for OPVs. OSCs with IC based NFAs have great potential in achieving outstanding photovoltaic performance.

Zheng and co-workers reported two novel push pull NFAs CDTDI and ITDI, by applying cyclopentadithiophene (CDT) and asymmetrical indenothiophene (ID) as the central core and electron withdrawing IC as the flanking group for solution processed OSCs. The BHJ OSCs based on PBDB-T:CDTDI and PBDB-T:ITDI blends yielded a PCE of 2.75% and 8.0%, respectively. Zhan and co-workers explored an A–D–A structure NFA (ITIC) having long π-conjugated ladder indacenodithieno[3,2-b]dithiophene (IDTT) core as the donor unit and an electron withdrawing IC group as terminal chromophoric units. This acceptor shows a PCE of 6.8% after blending with the PTB7-Th polymer donor. The performance of ITIC as the acceptor was further investigated with different donor materials and a maximum PCE of up to 12.80% was achieved. Recently, Bazan et al. developed a new near infra-red (NIR) absorbing NFA (ITIC-2F) by replacing the IC end group of ITIC with mono-fluorinated IC. Compared to ITIC, ITIC-2F shows a down-shifted LUMO level, a low band gap and a red shifted intermolecular charge transfer absorption band. Two new NFAs (IOTIC-2F and ITOTIC-2F) were also synthesized by the same group using IDT and IDTT as the central core, alkoxy substituted thiophene spacers and mono fluorinated IC end groups, respectively (Fig. 6). IOTIC-2F exhibits red shifted absorption and a low band gap while ITOTIC-2F having a more conjugated backbone shows a slightly blue shifted absorption profile compared to ITIC-2F. The non-covalent interactions between the spacer and central donor/terminal acceptor units enhance the planarity of the molecular backbone which is advantageous for inter and intra-molecular interactions. Because of the more conjugated framework, the ITOTIC-2F molecule has lower solubility, and hence during the rapid film-formation process ordered domains are formed and the material is kinetically quenched in a more disordered state. The reduced solubility of ITOTIC-2F leads to de-mixing of active layer components during the formation of the blend film. The active layer of ITIC-2F and IOTIC-2F exhibits a well-mixed blend film morphology and further improved morphologies were obtained by using processing additives. ITIC-2F, ITOTIC-2F and IOTIC-2F offered PCEs of over 8.7%, 3.7% and 11.6% when blended with the PTB7-Th donor material, respectively. The Nguyen research group studied different characteristics such as current density–voltage, steady state, transient, recombination density and life time in ITIC:PTB7-Th based devices. Two narrow band gap NIR NFAs (COTIC-4F and SiOTIC-4F) were designed and synthesized by the same research group employing cyclopentadithiophene and dithienosilole as the central core, alkoxy thiophene as the spacer and difluorinated IC as the terminal end group, respectively (Fig. 6). The COTIC-4F NFA shows red shifted absorption in the NIR region with a narrower band gap than SiOTIC-4F. Both NFAs have complimentary absorption with PTB7-Th. The COTIC-4F and SiOTIC-4F gave PCEs up to 7.4% and 9% after blending with the PTB7-Th donor. The low ΔHOMO (HOMOdonor − HOMOacceptor) offset of SiOTIC-4F based devices is responsible for reduced Eloss and high PCE compared to the COTIC-4F based solar cell. Further side chain modifications (one by one replacement of alkoxy groups of thiophene with alkyl groups) were performed at the π-spacer of COTIC-4F to explore new NIR NFAs (CO1-4F and CTIC-4F) for OSCs. Modification at the side chain results in the red shift of the absorption profile from 714 nm to 814 nm and 875 nm. By introducing alkyl chains, the band gap of the molecules is increased and the HOMO energy levels are upshifted. The up-shifted HOMO levels of CO1-4F and CTIC-4F result in efficient charge generation and a high PCE of solar cells fabricated with the PTB7-Th donor material. By this side chain engineering the PCE was enhanced up to 10.5%. Hou and co-workers explored a new acceptor IT-4F via fluorination at the terminal end group of ITIC. The PSC device based on the new fluorinated PBDB-T-SF donor and IT-4F acceptor gave a remarkable PCE of 13.1%. Fluorine is a strong electron withdrawing group which increases the electron affinity of the molecule, downshifts the FMO energy levels and enhances the absorption coefficient of molecules without any steric hindrance in molecules. Moreover fluorinated molecules have a greater dipole moment and reduced electrostatic force between holes and electrons of excitons. Non-covalent inter and intramolecular interactions in fluorinated molecules enhance their crystallinity and facilitate charge transport. Bo et al. reported indacenodithieno[3,2-b]dithiophene (IDTT) core based three new acceptor molecules (ITIC-SC6, ITIC-SC8 and ITIC-SC2C6) with different 4-(alkylthio)phenyl side chains and demonstrated that alteration of the alkyl side chain also affects the photovoltaic performance of the acceptor. The OSC devices based on PBDB-ST:ITIC-SC2C6 exhibited a maximum PCE of up to 9.16%. By a side chain isomerization of the alkyl phenyl group (shifting of the alkyl group from the para to the meta position) of ITIC another acceptor m-ITIC was synthesized (Fig. 6). The PSC based on J61:m-ITIC demonstrated a higher PCE of 11.77%. Zou and co-workers designed and synthesized a new fullerene free acceptor (m-ITIC-OR) based on indacenodithieno[3,2-b]dithiophene with the m-alkoxy phenyl side chain and BHJ solar cells based on the m-ITIC-OR acceptor and HFQx-T donor exhibited a PCE of up to 9.3%. Zhan and co-workers explored another acceptor IEIC with indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the donor unit and electron withdrawing group IC as the end group. The PTB7-Th:IEIC blend film without any post treatment has a PCE value of 6.3%. IEIC exhibits an increased PCE of over 7.2% when employing different donor materials. Hou and co-workers developed a very low band gap NFA IEICO by introducing an oxygen atom in the thienyl alkyl chain in the IEIC acceptor. IEICO based OSCs showed high photovoltaic performance with a maximum efficiency of 8.4%. The same research group presented another NFA IEICO-4F with an ultra-narrow band gap by incorporating two fluorine atoms in terminal end groups. IEICO-4F exhibited the highest PCE of 10% (10.9% in ternary solar cells) with different donor molecules. Introduction of four fluorine atoms reduces the band gap via upshifting of the HOMO and downshifting of the LUMO energy levels of the molecule. IEICO-4F shows more polarization than its non-fluorinated counterparts indicating enhanced internal charge transfer (ICT) from the electron donor core to the electron deficient units. A new NFA (i-IEICO-4F) was explored by the Wu group via changing the position of the alkoxy group on thiophene in the IEICO-4F acceptor (Fig. 6). Due to the steric hindrance between the side chain at the central core and the alkoxy group at the spacer the new acceptor molecule has a twisted molecular backbone and reduced π-conjugation. The reduced conjugation in i-IEICO-4F increases the LUMO energy levels, band gap, and absorption profile shifts towards shorter wavelengths (blue shift). The blue shifted absorption leads to the complimentary absorption of the acceptor molecule with the polymer donor J52. A PCE of 13.18% was obtained from OSCs based on the J52:i-IEICO-4F blend film. Zhan and co-workers reported another narrow band gap NFA (ITIC-Th) by employing hexyl thienyl substituted indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (IDTT) as the core and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) (IC) flanking groups. ITIC-Th has low frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels and high charge carrier mobility due to the σ-inductive effect of the thienyl chain and intermolecular sulfur–sulfur interaction. The ITIC-Th acceptor with different donor molecules showed a maximum PCE of 9.6%. By introducing a fluorine atom onto the end group of ITIC-Th a new NFA ITIC-Th1 was designed and synthesized. After blending ITIC-Th1 with the polymer donor FTAZ the OSC delivered a higher PCE of 12.1% which is due to the enhanced short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), intermolecular and intramolecular interactions via the electronegative F atom. To observe the effect of substituents at the terminal end group further molecular engineering was done at ITIC-Th by the same group. Four NFAs ITIC-Th, ITIC-Th1, ITIC-Th2 and ITIC-Th3 were explored containing a H atom, one fluorene atom, a methoxy group and two fluorene atoms at the terminal IC group, respectively (Fig. 6). The electron accepting capacity of the acceptor increases with increasing electron deficient characters of molecules (from methoxylated to unsubstituted, fluorinated and difluorinated) leading to the red shift of the absorption
profile, downshift of FMO energy levels and reduced band gaps. The methoxylated acceptor (ITIC-Th3) has an increased band gap and blue shifted absorption compared to the unsubstituted molecule (ITIC-Th). PSCs based on these NFAs exhibited PCEs from 8.8% to 12.1%. A series of NFAs (NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F) using hexacyclic naphthalene-(cyclopentadithiophene) as the central core and IC with different substituents as the terminal acceptor unit were explored. A highest efficiency of 8.63% was obtained for PBDB-T:NTIC film based BHJ solar cells.
A NFA (IDTIDT-IC) bearing fused 10-heterocyclic(indacenodithiophene-indacenodithiophene) was reported by Liao and co-workers (Fig. 7). IDTIDT-IC has a low LUMO energy level and a low band gap due to the longer conjugation length. Polymer solar cells based on the PTB7-Th:IDTIDT-IC blend film achieved a PCE of 6.48%. Based on ITIC, Li and co-workers explored a series of NFAs by introducing different halogen atoms at terminal chromophoric groups. The electronegativity of halogen atoms decreases with increasing molar mass and atomic size. Due to the strong electronegativity and heavy atom effect of halogens these NFAs possess high lying FMO energy levels and high crystalline properties. Because of the steric hindrance effect derived from the large atomic size of other halogen atoms (Cl, Br and I) the fluorinated molecule shows better device performance than other halogenated molecules. OSCs based on halogenated NFAs yielded high PCE over 9.5%. Chen and co-workers explored a new acceptor ITTIC by incorporating a thiophene bridge between the IDTT central donor and the IC terminal acceptor unit of ITIC (Fig. 7). Compared to pristine ITIC, ITTIC has a high LUMO energy level, low band gap and red shifted absorption profile. The PSCs based on the PBDB-T1:ITTIC blend film showed a PCE of 9.12%. Hou and co-workers successfully developed two new acceptors by introducing one and two methyl groups in the terminal electron withdrawing groups of ITIC denoted as IT-M and IT-DM, respectively. By introducing a weak electron donating methyl group the electron negativity of the terminal end group (IC) decreases resulting in the increase of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of molecules and hence increased Voc in OSCs. The FMO energy levels of the molecule gradually increase by increasing the number of methyl substituents. The OSC based on the PBDB-T:IT-M blend exhibited a higher PCE of up to 12.05% while a PCE of 11.29% was obtained for the PBDB-T:IT-DM based PSC. Liao and co-workers also designed and synthesized a new NFA BT-IC bearing a fused seven-membered heterocyclic ring as the core and IC as the electron withdrawing end group. BT-IC is a NIR absorbing and low band gap acceptor and PSCs based on this acceptor achieved PCEs up to 9.6% and 10.5% after blending with J61 and J71 donor materials, respectively. Forrest et al. developed another NFA BTCIC via replacing the H atom at the terminal end group of the BT-IC acceptor with a more electronegative Cl atom (Fig. 7). The more electronegative Cl atom reduces the energy band gap and enhances the absorption via increasing intramolecular charge transfer. The single junction solar cell based on PTB7-Th:BT-CIC offered a PCE of over 11.2%. Zhan and co-workers also reported planar fused ring NFA IC-C6IDT-IC with six hexyl chains synthesized by a one step facile reaction. The OSCs based on PDBT-T1:IC-C6IDT-IC without any post treatments achieved a PCE of over 8.71%. Recently a new ladder type A–D–A structure NFA named as NFBDT based on heptacyclic benzo di(cyclopentadithiophene) using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene as the central core was developed. The NFBDT acceptor offered a PCE around 10.42% when combined with the PBDB-T donor. Another two new NFAs (NFBDT-Me and NFBDT-F) were explored by incorporating two substituents methyl and fluorine at the terminal end group (INCN) of the NFBDT acceptor (Fig. 7). Methyl and fluorine are small substituents which improve the overall performance of the molecule as an acceptor without creating any steric hindrance. The weak electron donating methyl group upshifts the LUMO energy level leading to the enhanced Voc of the molecule, while the strong electron withdrawing fluorine group downshifts the FMO energy levels and reduces the band gap, resulting in the red shift of the absorption band gap and increase of Jsc of the acceptor. Compared to NFBDT these two NFAs NFBDT-Me and NFBDT-F based devices offer a higher PCE of 11.00% and 10.62%, respectively. The result demonstrated that changing different substituents on the terminal chromophoric groups is a promising way to tune the energy levels for better photovoltaic performance. Cheng et al. developed an acceptor BDCPDT-IC and a PSC based on PBDB-T as the donor and BDCPDT-IC as an acceptor gave a PCE of over 9.73%. Sun and co-workers adopted a new dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) core based NFA (DTCC-IC) by using a four p-octyloxy phenyl substituted DTCC derivative as the central donor and IC as the terminal strong electron withdrawing group. BHJ PSCs based on the PTB7-Th:DTCC-IC blend yielded a PCE of up to 6%. Zhan and co-workers reported a series of NFAs using fused-nonacyclic 6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-indacenobis(dithieno[2,3-b2′,3′-d]thiophene) (IBDT) as an electron rich unit and IC with 0–2 fluorine as the electron deficient end group. Due to the electron withdrawing characteristics of the fluorine atom, fluorinated NFAs (INIC1, INIC2 and INIC3) exhibited a bathochromic shifted absorption profile, lower FMO energy levels and high electron mobility compared to the non-fluorinated acceptor (INIC). The fluorine atom encourages intermolecular and intramolecular interactions forming F–S and F–H bonds to facilitate charge transport. Non-fullerene BHJ solar cells based on the polymer donor FTAZ and INIC series acceptors gave high PCEs of 7.7–11.5%. Fluorinated molecules, especially difluorinated INIC3 exhibited high photovoltaic performance compared to the other three counterparts. Liao and co-workers presented an NFA bearing five-fused heterocyclic ring containing a selenium atom named as IDSe-T-IC (Fig. 7) having a low band gap (1.52 eV), high LUMO level and strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region. The PSCs based on J51:IDSe-T-IC blend films yielded a PCE of up to 8.6%. A new planar fused ring NFA (IDIC) based on indacenodithiophene with four hexyl side chains was developed. Based on IDIC many OSCs were optimized and a highest PCE of up to 12.5% was achieved.
Sharma and co-workers reported a NFA (DCI-2) based on di thieno[3,2-b:2′3′-d]pyrrole as the donor attached with highly electron deficient flanking groups via two alkylated thiophene bridges (Fig. 8). This molecule possesses broad absorption extending up to 1000 nm. PSC devices based on DCI-2 exhibited PCE over 6.94% when mixed with the polymer donor P1. Zhan and co-workers developed an NFA DC-IDT2T with the IDT central donor attached to the acceptor unit via the thiophene linker and achieved a PCE of 3.93%. Huang et al. designed and synthesized a new NFA via introducing the thiazole π-spacer in place of thiophene in the IDT-T acceptor. The electronegative N atom in the thiazole unit decreases the energy of the LUMO level and increases the difference between the LUMO energy of the donor and acceptor resulting in the increase of exciton dissociation and Jsc of the molecule in the OSC. Noncovalent bonding between the N atom of thiazole and the S atom of IDT increases the rigidity and planarity of the building block which enhances the charge carrier mobility and FF of the OSC. The BHJ solar cell based on the PTB7-Th:IDT-Tz and PBDB-T:IDT-Tz blend films offered a PCE of 8.4% and 8.52%, respectively. Zhu and co-workers recently explored a new fullerene free electron acceptor (NITI) with indenoindene (14-π electron system) as the central core and difluorinated IC as the terminal end group attached via the 2-octylthieno[3,4-b-thiophene] linker (Fig. 8). By fabricating NITI with the polymer donor PBDB-T a higher PCE of over 12.74% was achieved. Liu and co-workers reported another ITIC derivative NFA denoted as ITIC-OE with the OE (oligoethylene oxide) alkyl side chain at the core unit which showed the same optical properties but a higher dielectric constant as compared to ITIC. ITIC-OE offered a PCE of over 8.5% when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Zhan et al. developed a fused ring electron acceptor IOIC2 with the naptho[1,2-b;5,6-b′]dithiophene based fused octacyclic ring (NTT) as the core and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) as the terminal chromophoric groups (Fig. 8). Relative to the IHIC2 electron acceptor with a naphthalene based smaller core, IOIC2 exhibits a red shifted absorption profile and higher FMO energy levels and electron mobility with increased Voc, Jsc and FF. The OSCs based on FTAZ:IOIC2 yielded a PCE of up to 12.3%, which is much higher than that of FTAZ:IHIC2 (7.45%). Marder and co-workers explored a new naphthalene core based acceptor IHIC-N. The PSC based on the PTB7-Th:IHIC-N blend film achieved a PCE of up to 6.91% and a ternary photovoltaic cell based on PTB7-Th:IHCI-N:IHIC offered a PCE of over 11.9%. Choi et al. designed and synthesized highly π-extended acceptors (IM-IDT3 and IM-BDTIDT2) with IDT-IDT-IDT and IDT-BDT-IDT cores as central donor units and IM as the terminal acceptor group. These acceptor molecules exhibited a broad absorption profile with high lying FMO energy levels. The PSC devices based on IM-IDT3 and IM-BDTIDT2 showed a PCE of over 3.25% and 5.33%, respectively when blended with the polymer donor PTB7-Th. Zheng and co-workers developed two new NFAs (DTNIC6 and DTNIC8) based on the ladder-type dithienonaphthalene (DTN) core having a linear or branched alkyl chain and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) was chosen as an electron withdrawing group to lower the energy of the LUMO level (Fig. 8). The PSC based on PBDB-T:DTNIC6 and PBDB-T:DTNIC8 offered a PCE of 3.39% and 9.03%, respectively. Chen et al. designed and synthesized a simple NFA (DICTF) containing fluorene as the central building block and 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile as the end-capping group and the OSC with this acceptor provides a PCE of up to 7.93%.
Another A–D–A type NFA (FDICTF) was explored by the same group via fusing the fluorene core in DICTF with the adjacent thiophene unit to make a ladder type backbone (Fig. 9). Compared to DICTF the new NFA has more red shifted absorption and tunable FMO energy levels. The PSC based on the PBDB-T:FDICTF blend film achieved a PCE of over 10.06%. Chen and co-workers developed another new small molecule acceptor (FDNCTP) via replacing the INCN end group of FDICTF with napthyl-fused indanone (NINCN). Due to the extended π-conjugation at the end group via phenyl ring light absorption, the charge mobility and overall performance of the molecule as an acceptor improved simultaneously. This acceptor molecule demonstrated a PCE of 11.2% when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Further three more NFAs (F–F, F–Cl and F–Br) were developed via a halogenation strategy of FDICTF (F–H) (Fig. 9). These fluorinated acceptors show a red shifted absorption profile and high charge carrier mobilities compared to the non-halogenated counterpart (F–H). When blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T the F–F, F–Cl and F–Br based devices gave PCEs of 10.85%, 11.27% and 12.05%, respectively. Chen and co-workers designed and synthesized two NFAs (F–M) via introducing a methyl substituent at the terminal end group of the F–H acceptor and (NOBDT) by incorporating an octyloxy side chain at the central core and fluorine at the terminal end group of the NFBDT acceptor. The OSC based on the F–M acceptor offers a PCE of 10.29% with a Voc of 0.98 V when blended with a wide band gap polymer PBDB-T. NOBDT acceptor achieved a PCE of up to 10.55% with an increased Jsc of 19.16 mA cm−2 after blending with the narrow band gap polymer PTB7-Th. A tandem organic solar cell (TOSC) based on PBDB-T:F-M (front cell) and PTB7-Th:NOBDT (rear cell) offered an outstanding PCE of up to 14.11% with a Voc of 1.71 V. A new NFA (NCBDT) with an octyl side chain at the central core and a fluorine atom at the terminal group of the NFBDT acceptor was designed and synthesized by the same group (Fig. 9). The PBDB-T:NCBDT based solar cell demonstrated a PCE of 12.12%. Recently a new NFA 3TT-FIC containing three fused thieno-[2,3-b]thiophene as the central core and di-fluoro substituted indanone as the flanking group was developed. 3TT-IC shows broad absorption up to 995 nm with a low optical band gap of 1.25 eV. The PSC based on the PTB7-Th:3TT-FIC blend film achieved a PCE of over 12.21% while in the ternary solar cell a PCE of up to 13.54% was achieved. New NFAs ITIC3 and FOIC having IDTT and a fused octacyclic building block with fused tris(thieno thiophene) as the central donor unit and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidine)malononitrile and 2-(5/6-fluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidine)malononitrile as strong electron accepting groups were reported by Zhan and co-workers. Compared with the ITIC3 acceptor, FOIC exhibited broad absorption with a low band gap of 1.32 eV, a high molar extinction coefficient of up to 2 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and a high electron mobility of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSC based on the PTB7-Th:FOIC blend film without any post treatment gave a PCE of over 12.0%, which is much higher compared with its counterpart ITIC3 based PSC. Jen et al. designed and synthesized a new NFA (4TIC) based on fused ring thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene-thiophene as the core flanked with IC as the acceptor unit. The PSC based on 4TIC as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor exhibited a PCE of up to 10.43%. A new NFA (IDT-OB) with an asymmetric side chain was developed by Bo and co-workers (Fig. 9). The PBDB-T:IDT-OB blend film based device showed a high PCE of 10.12% with high charge carrier mobility compared to acceptor molecules with a symmetric side chain (IDT-2B and IDT-2O). Hou and co-workers explored a series of DT-IDT core based NFAs (IT-OM-1, IT-OM-2, IT-OM-2 and IT-OM-4) with methoxy modified dicyanovinyl indane-1-one (DCI) as the end group and demonstrated the effect of position of the substituent in the IC group on the optoelectronic and morphological properties of molecules. The dissimilarity of energy levels in molecules can be explained by the resonance effect of the methoxy group while the variations in the molecular packing corresponded to the distortion of the end group. Because of the resonance electron donating effect of the methoxy group in planar IT-OM-2 and IT-OM-3 a stronger π–π interaction was observed which further causes a reduced band gap and more red shifted absorption compared to other acceptors. The steric hindrance of the methoxy group with cyano and carbonyl groups in IT-OM-1 and IT-OM-4 acceptors is responsible for the distortion from planar geometry, respectively (Fig. 9). The more distortion of the end group relative to the planar central core unit could be the reason for the overall low performance of the IT-OM-1 acceptor. Thus the more planar structure of IT-OM-2 and IT-OM-3 is responsible for the strong molecular interaction and high electron mobility. The highest PCE of 11.9% with a Jsc of 17.53 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73% was achieved in the PSC based on the PBDB-T:IT-OM-2 blend film.
Four DT-IDT core based NFAs (IT-O1, IT-O2, IT-O3 and IT-O4) containing different alkoxy groups with different alkyl chains (from methyl to butyl) at the terminal acceptor unit were explored by the same group to investigate the effect of side chain length of the end group on acceptor molecules (Fig. 9). The optoelectronic properties of these molecules are not much affected while the photochemical properties of these molecules gradually decrease with increasing the length of the alkyl group. The BHJ solar cell devices based on these acceptor molecules exhibited PCEs from 11.6% to 4.2% when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Li and co-workers developed a NFA (SJ-IC) via introducing a double bond as the π-linker in the IDT-IC acceptor molecule. According to the molecular orbital theory (MOT) the extended conjugation of the molecule by the double bond results in the reduced band gap, red shifted absorption and enhanced charge mobility of the molecule. The PSC based on the J61:SJ-IC blend delivered a PCE of up to 9.27%. A novel NFA (IDIDT-C8) containing the cis-alkyl side chain at the central core was designed and synthesized by Bo and co-workers. The OSC fabricated with the PBDB-T:IDIDT-C8 blend film achieved a PCE of over 10.10%. Zhang and Zhu developed two new NFAs (NFDTS and NFDTSB) using thieno[3,2-b]thienobis(silolothiophene) (FDTS) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bis(dithienosilole) (FDTSB) as the central core, respectively and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN-2F) as the terminal chromophoric group (Fig. 10). The BHJ solar cells based on PTB7-Th:NFDTS and PTB7-Th:NFDTSB as the active layer demonstrated a PCE of up to 6.15% and 9.60%, respectively. Two NFAs (IDT-BC6 and IDT-BOC6) having IDT as the building block and cyano indanone as the terminal unit linked through bis(alkoxy) substituted or dialkyl substituted benzene were developed for OSCs. Due to the presence of non-covalent O–H and O–S conformational locking the IDT-BOC6 has rigid and good planarity compared to IDT-BC6. Because of this reason IDT-BOC6 shows a higher fluorescence quantum yield, less energy loss generated from non-radiative recombination and enhanced Voc compared to IDT-BC6. The PSC based on IDT-BOC6 demonstrated a PCE of 9.6% while IDT-BC6 gave a PCE of up to 2.3% when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Zhu and co-workers designed and synthesized a new NFA (NIDBT) using weak electron donating indacenodibenzothiophene (IDBT) as the building block and 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile as the electron withdrawing terminal unit. The OSC based on NIDBT as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor delivered a PCE of up to 4.45%.
Zhan et al. explored three NFAs (IC-1IDT-IC, IC-2IDT-IC, and IC-3IDT-IC) with increasing numbers of IDT units in the central building block to observe the effect of the IDT unit on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of acceptor molecules (Fig. 11). Among these three acceptors the IC-2IDT-IC and IC-3IDT-IC acceptors show red shifted absorption with low band gaps and low HOMO levels compared to IC-1IDT-IC, which indicates increasing π-conjugation by IDT units and thus enhanced delocalization of electrons resulting in increased absorption towards higher wavelengths. Relative to IC-2IDT-IC and IC-3IDT-IC, IC-1IDT-IC has more planarity, strong π–π stacking, high charge carrier mobility and the highest PCE up to 7.39% with the PDBT-T1 donor. Three fused ring electron acceptors (F6IC, F8IC and F10IC) containing different cores (with varying fused ring) end capped with the electron acceptor unit 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile were developed by the same group (Fig. 11). Increasing conjugation via the thiophene unit results in red-shifted absorption, up-shifted FMO levels and reduced band gaps which are beneficial to high Jsc and Voc of OSCs. Fluorination at the end group downshifts the energy levels and lowers the band gap which results in decreased Voc and increased Jsc of OSC, respectively. Recently two NFAs (DTPC-IC and DTPC-DFIC) based on the dithienopicenocarbazole (DTPC) core based flanked with IC and DFIC end groups were explored and achieved a PCE of 10.21% with the PTB7-Th donor material. The optoelectronic properties, morphology and charge transport properties of molecules can be improved by side chain modifications at the central core and terminal end group. Three new ITIC derived NFAs (pO-ITIC, mO-ITIC and FpO-ITIC) via molecular engineering at the side chain of ITIC by incorporation of alkoxy chains and end groups were developed for OSCs and achieved a PCE of up to 9.28% when blended with the polymer donor PTZ-DO. Recently, new NFAs (6TIC) having the tris(thieno thiophene) fused octacyclic unit as the central donor and IC as the terminal chromophoric unit were developed by Jen and co-workers (Fig. 11). The strong, broad and complimentary absorption and suitable FMO energy levels of the porphyrin based small molecule donor (ZnP-TBO) and acceptors are advantageous for efficient charge generation and high Jsc in OPV cells. The OPV device based on the donor (ZnP-TBO) and acceptor (6TIC) offered a PCE of up to 12% with the highest Jsc of 20.44 mA cm−1. An electron deficient central unit (BT) based ladder type new NFA Y6 containing dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT) as the core and difluorinated IC as the terminal end group was presented by the Zou and research group. The Y6 molecule exhibits strong absorption in the NIR region, while the PM6:Y6 blend film shows slightly blue shifted absorption spectra compared to the neat film of Y6. The blend morphology of the blend film shows a smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) value of 0.93 nm which indicates the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor. The PM6:Y6 blend film based both conventional and inverted devices gave the highest PCE of 15.7%. Further a PCE of 16% was reported for BTPTT-4F (Y6) using polymer P2F-EHp as the donor material. Both donor and acceptor materials have complimentary absorption and well matched energy levels which are beneficial for effective charge transfer and high PCE of the OSC. Hou and co-workers developed a new NFA (BTP-4Cl) via replacing the fluorine atom at the terminal end group of the Y6 acceptor with the chlorine atom (Fig. 11). Because of the larger size of the Cl atom and C–Cl bond length BTP-4Cl shows red shifted absorption spectra and a high molar extinction coefficient. The blend film of BTP-4Cl shows a higher RMS value than BTP-4F. The OSCs based on PBDB-TF:BTP-4F (Y6) and PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl offered the highest PCE of 15.6 and 16.5%, respectively.
The introduction of the IC group as the terminal electron withdrawing unit lowers the energy of the LUMO level by its carbonyl and cyano groups which results in the reduced optical band gap and extended absorption band of acceptor molecules. The incorporation of the F atom at the end group downshifts the energy of FMO energy levels, reduces the band gap and broadens the absorption band and absorption coefficient of the molecule which helps in the improvement of Jsc and PCE of OSC devices. Thus fluorination at the end group is a promising approach for development of efficient non-fullerene acceptors. Due to electronegative and heavy atom effect of halogen atoms the acceptor molecules with halogen substituted end groups have deep lying FMO energy levels and high crystallinity. Both IC and fluorinated IC based NFAs exhibit good miscibility with the donor material, and a smooth and uniform morphology with a lower root mean square (RMS) value which indicates their lower crystallinity than other halogenated IC based acceptors. Hence IC and F-IC based acceptors show high charge carrier mobility and high PCE in the OPV device. In OSCs the binding energy of excitons (electron hole pair binds together with electrostatic force) depends on the chemical nature of the molecule and its surroundings. The binding energy of excitons is on the order of 0.5 eV or larger. The donor–acceptor interface provides driving force for charge separation. The energy offset between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor must be above a certain minimum value for efficient charge generation. The Eloss of polymer based OSCs can be calculated as Eloss = Eg − eVoc. Due to the larger size of the Cl atom and larger C–Cl bond length, Cl-IC end group based NFAs show a higher dipole moment and more intermolecular π–π packing than IC and X-IC containing NFAs (X = F, Br, I). More intermolecular interactions result in the lowering of FMO energy levels, reducing the band gap and enhancing the absorption of molecules. Hence the higher values of the molar extinction coefficient and red shifted absorption profile are beneficial for efficient conversion of photons. In BHJ solar cells Voc is directly proportional to the difference between the HOMOD and LUMOA. The Cl-IC based NFAs have higher lying FMO energy levels than other halogenated IC based NFAs. Hence, the OPV device based on the Cl-IC end group containing acceptor molecule exhibits high Voc and low Eloss. Incorporation of the weak electron donating methyl group at the end group results in the elevated energy of FMO energy levels and increased Voc acceptors in OSCs. The D–A blend film of di-methyl substituted IC based NFAs exhibits a rough surface with larger RMS values (RMS = 4.43 nm) than IC and methyl substituted IC based acceptors (RMS = 2 nm). The length of the alkyl chain (from methyl to butyl) at the IC end group does not affect the photoelectronic properties of acceptor molecules, but a considerable effect can be observed on the morphology of the blend film. The methyl and ethyl substituted IC end group based acceptors show a much smoother surface with a RMS roughness of 1.79 nm and 2.29 nm than propyl and butyl substituted IC (RMS = 19.5 nm for propyl-IC and RMS = 20.9 nm for butyl-IC), respectively. Hence the Me-IC and Et-IC acceptor based devices exhibit a smoother and uniform blend morphology which is responsible for their high charge carrier mobility, high Jsc and PCE (Table 4).

Dicyano rhodanine is an easily synthesized strong electron withdrawing chromophoric group. Dicyano rhodanine used as the terminal end group in the synthesis of different n-type semiconductor materials enhances the conjugation and reduces the electron density of the molecule resulting in the increase of photovoltaic performance of acceptor materials. The malononitrile group in the dicyano rhodanine group lies out of plane from the plane of the conjugated backbone which disturbs the cofacial stacking of molecules. Hence the intermolecular cofacial interaction and crystalline order decrease. The dicyano rhodanine based NFAs show a smaller crystal domain size, uniform morphology and smoother blend film surface than rhodanine based acceptors which are advantageous for efficient charge transport and improved efficiency of OPV devices.

Chen et al. designed and synthesized the NFA SF-ORCN with a 3D structure based on dicyano rhodanine as the terminal acceptor group and achieved a PCE of 4.48% using the P3HT donor material (Fig. 12). The introduction of the dicyano group at the terminal chromophoric rhodanine unit shifts the absorption profile towards longer wavelengths and enhances the electron accepting ability of the molecule. Zhu and co-workers developed a NFA ATT-1 using the indacenodithiophene core attached with rhodanine groups through thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TbT). PSCs based on the PTB7-Th:ATT-1 blend film delivered a PCE of over 10.07%. Langa and co-workers developed a new small molecule acceptor by incorporating dicyano rhodanine at the edge of the thiophene diketopyrrolopyrrole core. Small molecule BHJ solar cells based on MPU2 and DTS(QxHTh2)2 donor materials gave PCEs up to 7.76%. The SFBRCN acceptor based on the spiro fluorene core attached with the benzothiadiazole linker and end capped with the strong electron withdrawing dicyano rhodanine group was synthesized. A highest PCE of 10.12% was obtained for the BHJ solar cell based on the PTB7-Th:SFBRCN blend film. Our group explored the BAF-4CN acceptor molecule based on the fluorene core flanked with dicyano rhodanine groups and the BHJ solar cell based on PffBT4T-2OD:BAF-4CN achieved a PCE of 8.4% (Fig. 12). Our group explored another NFA (FRdCN2) using the fluorene core and dicyano rhodanine as the chromophoric group linked through benzothiadiazole and furan linkers. The PTB7-Th:FRdCN2 blend film based PSC gave a PCE of 10.7%.
Huang and co-workers designed and synthesized two wide band gap NFAs (IDTCR and IDTzCR) having indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the central core and dicyano rhodanine as the end group linked via thiophene and thiazole spacers, respectively. The electronegative N atom in the thiazole group lowers the energy of the LUMO level and increases the ΔLUMO (energy difference between the LUMO of the donor and acceptor) resulting in increased charge transport and Jsc of the molecule in the OSC. The PSC based of PTB7-Th:IDTCR and PTB7-Th:IDTzCR demonstrated a PCE of over 6.10% and 8.71%, respectively. Chen and co-workers developed a new NFA (A2) by incorporating the dicyano methylene group at the end group of acceptor A1. The PTB7-Th:A2 blend film based device delivered a PCE of 9.07% (Fig. 12). The introduction of the dicyano rhodanine end group enhances the electron withdrawing properties of molecules and reduces the energy band gap via its ketone and cyano groups. The dicyano methylene group enhances the light absorption and lowers the LUMO energy levels by increasing π-conjugation which results in the increase of Voc of the OSC (Table 5).

Diketopyrrolopyrrole is an electron withdrawing chromophoric group with characteristics of coplanar conjugated bicyclic structure, excellent optoelectronic properties and strong light absorption. DPP derivatives are extensively used as high performance dye molecules due to their excellent photochemical and thermal stability. The DPP unit was successfully introduced to synthesize donor and acceptor molecules for OSCs. A variety of NFAs with DPP and terminal end groups were designed and synthesized for BHJ solar cells.

Jo and co-workers developed two new acceptor molecules with (difluorinated and non-fluorinated) benzothiadiazole as the central core and TDPP as the end group (Fig. 13). The PSCs with PTB7 as the donor and the DTDfBT(TDPP)2 acceptor exhibited a PCE of 5.0%. Zhan and co-workers explored another novel 3D-star shaped NFA using the triphenylamine core and DPP as the flanking group. A PCE of 1.20% was obtained in BHJ solar cells based on the P3HT:S(TPA-DPP) blend film with a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.18 V. Bhosale and co-workers designed and synthesized a NFA (named as 4D) through the conjugation of tetraphenylethylene and DPP functionalities. Solution processable BHJ solar cells based on the P3HT:4D blend film afforded a PCE of over 3.86%. Another H shaped NFA coded H1 using DPP as an arm was synthesized by the same research group. The H1 acceptor exhibited a high absorption coefficient, high thermal stability and electron mobility and achieved an efficiency of 5.42% when blended with the P3HT donor material. Chen and co-workers developed a spirobifluorene core and benzene end capped DPP arm based NFA denoted as SF(DPPB)4. The OSCs based on the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 blend provided a PCE of up to 5.16%. Zhan and co-workers adopted another small molecule acceptor DBS-2DPP and the blend film P3HT:DBS-2DPP exhibited a PCE of over 2.05% (Fig. 13).
The fluorene core based NFA (DPP1) flanked with the DPP acceptor unit was synthesized and achieved a PCE of over 1.2%. Bhosale and co-workers developed another fullerene free acceptor N7 based on carbazole as central core and DPP as the terminal building block and afforded 2.3% efficiency tested with the polymer donor P3HT. Russell and co-workers explored two series of NFAs (SF-DPP) and (SFA-DPP) using the spirobifluorene core and DPP end unit with different alkyl chains. SF-DPPEH was the best acceptor and provided a PCE of 3.63%. Zhan et al. developed a new NFA IDT-2DPP containing IDT as the central building block and DPP as the terminal chromophoric group (Fig. 14). The BHJ solar cell based on the P3HT:IDT-DPP based blend film exhibited a PCE of over 0.83%. In conclusion, the DPP unit is a strong electronegative group having a planar π-conjugated lactam skeleton and strong π–π interaction. The devices based on acceptors with the DPP end group have a high Voc and low voltage loss (Table 6).

Malononitrile is an electron withdrawing group which enhances the electron deficient character at the periphery of the molecule after introduction of the π-conjugated backbone. By increasing the conjugation of the molecule it reduces the optical band gap of the molecule resulting in the shift of the absorption spectrum towards higher wavelength region.

Beaujuge et al. designed and synthesized three NFAs (FBM, CBM and CDTBM) using the malononitrile end group attached with different cores through benzothiadiazole (BT). PSCs based on the PTB7-Th donor and NFAs obtained a higher PCE of up to 5.3%. Ma and co-workers explored 2,2-dicyanovinyl (DCV) end capped A–π–D–π–A type acceptors containing dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTSi), cyclopenta[1,2-b:3′,4′-b′]dithiophene (DTCP) or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTPy) units as central donors and mono-thiophene as the π-bridge (Fig. 15). OSCs devices using these acceptors achieved a higher PCE of up to 1.31% and 1.56% for P3HT and PTB7 as donors, respectively. Zhan and co-workers also developed A–D–A type acceptors denoted as IDT-2BM and IDTT-2BM using fused ring indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenothienodithiophene (IDTT) units as the central donor and strong electron withdrawing unit 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-ylmethylene)malononitrile (BM) as the terminal group. Fullerene free OSCs with PBDTTT-C-T as the donor and IDT-2BM and IDTT-2BM as acceptors afforded a PCE of up to 4.26% and 4.81%, respectively. Choi et al. developed a new NFA IDT(DCV)2 containing IDT as the building block flanked with dicyanovinylene (DCV) as the terminal chromophoric group. The PSC with the PTB7-Th:IDT(DCV)2 blend film showed a PCE of up to 2.59%. Recently two new NFAs (D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M) based on fluorine substituted oligothiophene as the core terminated with the malononitrile acceptor unit were developed by the Beaujuge group and achieved a PCE of up to 4.5% when fabricated with the PTB7-Th polymer donor (Fig. 15). F atoms exhibit inter and intramolecular interactions and reduce electrostatic attraction force between charge carriers and hence improve the active layer morphology and life time of charge carriers (Table 7).

Barbituric acid and thiobarbituric acid are electron withdrawing groups which enhance absorption and reduces the band gap by extending the conjugation of molecules. The more polarizable nature of the thioketone (CS) group in thiobarbituric acid than the ketone (CO) group increases the electron accepting properties of thiobarbituric acid. Hence the thiobarbituric acid group increases the more electron deficient characteristics in molecules, lowers the LUMO level, reduces the band gap and finally increases the absorption. Chen et al. explored a small molecule non-fullerene acceptor (DTBTF) using fluorene as the block unit and thiobarbituric acid as the terminal electron withdrawing group (Fig. 16). The OSC device based on the DR3TSBDT:DTBTF blend film gave a PCE of up to 3.84% with of Voc 1.15 V and a low energy loss of 0.59 eV. The Durrant group developed fluorene core based NFAs (FTB and FTTB) employing di-methyl substituted barbituric acid thiobarbituric acid as the terminal end group and thiophene as the linker (Fig. 16). Compared to FTB the FTTB acceptor exhibits a red shifted and more intense absorption profile. The OPV devices based on PSEHTT:FTB and PSEHTT:FTTB gave a PCE of 5.4% and 7.2%. Compared to the FTB based device (EQE = 54%) the higher PCE of the FTTB based device can be attributed to the more photocurrent generation and high value of EQE (84%). Sullivan and co-workers reported another non-fullerene acceptor denoted as EBB based on the barbituric acid end group and bisthiophene as the central unit. The bilayer device fabricated with SubPc as the donor and EBB as the acceptor achieved a PCE of 2.6%. Recently two new NFAs TT-BBAR and TT-OBAR were synthesized by Lim et al. using different alkyl chain substituted barbituric acid as the end group in the EBB NFA (Fig. 16). Both NFAs show almost similar photoelectronic properties. TT-BBAR and TT-OBAR gave a PCE of up to 1.16% and 1.34% when blended with the polymer donor PTB7-Th. 2-(6-Oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophene-4-ylidne)malononitrile (CPTCN) is an electron withdrawing group which shows better electron delocalization and strong intermolecular interactions and due to this reason acceptor molecules with the CPTCN end group exhibit a more planar structure, red shifted absorption and better charge carrier mobility. A new fullerene free molecular acceptor ITTC was synthesized via replacing the terminal group INCN of ITIC with the CPTCN group (Fig. 16). The PSCs with the HFQx-T:ITTC blend film achieved a PCE of 10.4%. Yang et al. explored another NFA ITCPTC with the thiophene fused end group by engaging a new active methylene group of (CPTCN). The ITCPTC based polymer solar cell with PBT1-EH as the donor achieved a high PCE of up to 11.8%. Yang and co-workers explored two new NFAs (ITCPTC-Th and ITCPTC-Se) via side chain engineering at the central core of the ITCPTC acceptor. New NFAs ITCPTC-Th and ITCPTC-Se with n-hexylphenyl and n-hexyl selenophenyl exhibited a PCE of up of 10.61% and 9.02%, respectively when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Choi et al. developed new NFAs IDT(TCV)2 and IDTT(TCV)2 having IDT as the central core flanked with tricyanovinylene (TCV) as the terminal chromophoric group. OSCs with PTB7-Th:IDT(TCV)2 and PTB7-Th:IDTT(TCV)2 blend films showed a PCE of up to 2.84% and 3.57%, respectively. The TCV group increases the π-conjugation of the molecule, and reduces the energy of the LUMO level and optical band gap of the molecule and due to this reason TCV containing molecules have long term stability and good electron chemical stability. A new NFA (IDTN) based on indaceno[1,2-b;5,6-b′]-dithiophene (IDT) as the core end capped with the naphthyl fused 2-(3-oxocyclopentylidene)malononitrile acceptor group was designed and synthesized (Fig. 16). The fused naphthalene unit in the 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalene-1-ylidene)malononitrile (CPNM) end group maintains the planarity of the conjugated central core and the extended π-conjugation via the terminal CPNM group enhances π-electron delocalization in the molecule. Therefore, the more planar backbone of IDTN shows a much stronger π–π interaction, lower band gap and deeper LUMO energy level. This acceptor demonstrated a PCE of up to 12.2% with a high fill factor of 78% when blended with the fluorinated polymer donor PBDB-TF. Four new NFAs with two different dye end groups ethyl cyanoacetate (ECA) and 1,3-indanedione (IN) attached with carbazole (Cz) and fluorene (Flu) central donor units through the thiophene spacer were designed and synthesized for OPV applications (Fig. 16). All NFAs except Cz-IN exhibited performance in BHJ solar cells with PCE up to 1.32%.

Our group developed a new NFA BAF-2HDT bearing diathiafulvalene (HDT) as the end capping group and fluorene as the core attached by the benzothiadiazole spacer (Fig. 17). BAF-2HDT has broad absorption and excellent electron accepting ability. PSCs made from the PffBT4T-2OD:BAF-2HDT blend film achieved a PCE of over 7.13%. Benzothiadiazole core based NFA BDT-CF3 flanked with trifluoro methane electron withdrawing units was developed and gave a PCE of 0.09% when blended with the P3HT donor molecule. Sharma and co-workers reported another NFA (PY-1) based on dithieno[3,2-b:2′3′-d]pyrrole as the donor attached with a highly electron deficient flanking group 1-butyl-4-methyl-2,6-dioxopyridine-3-carbonitrile (PY) via two alkylated thiophene bridges. This molecule shows broad absorption from 400–900 nm. OSCs based on PY-1 exhibited PCE over 4.89% when mixed with the polymer donor P1. Yang et al. explored a new NFA IDTCN containing indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT) as the central electron donor unit and 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophene-4-lidene)malononitrile (CPTCN) as the electron withdrawing end-capping group (Fig. 17). The BHJ device based on the PBT1-EH:IDTCN blend offered a PCE of up to 8.69%. Zhou and co-workers developed a new NFA (BTA2) via replacing 3-ethyl rhodanine of BTA1 with the thiazolidine-2,4-dione terminal acceptor group. A new NFA based on the P3HT:BTA2 blend achieved a PCE of up to 4.5%. Hou et al. synthesized a novel NFA (ITCC) via incorporating thienyl fused indanone as the terminal group in the ITIC acceptor. Due to the more polarizability of S atom compared to C atom the thiophene containing molecules have more intermolecular π–π interaction and high electron mobility relative to the phenyl containing molecules. Because of the more electron donating nature of thiophene compared to the phenyl unit the ITCC molecule has an up-shifted LUMO energy level and increased Voc compared to the ITIC molecule. The ITCC based PSC exhibited a higher PCE of up to 11.4% when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Yang and co-workers designed and synthesized a NFA (m-MeIC) with 6,12-dihydro-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT) as the building block, terminated with the methylated thiophene fused end group (Me-CPTCN) (Fig. 17). The PSCs based on the m-MeIC acceptor demonstrated a PCE of over 12, 10.93% and 8.12% when blended with J71, PBDB-T and PTB7-Th donor materials, respectively. Liu et al. developed a high performance medium band gap NFA (IDTT-T) by replacing the IC end group of the ITIC acceptor with a weak electron withdrawing group N,N′-diethyl thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The OSC device using PTB7-Th:IDTT-T as the active layer offered a PCE of 11.8% with low energy loss. Geng and co-workers explored two new low band gap NFAs (IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F) using selenophene as the π spacer to connect the central donor unit (IDT) to the terminal acceptor unit (IC and 2F-IC). More polarizability of the Se atom compared to the S atom induces the Se–Se intermolecular interaction and hence increases the charge carrier mobility of molecules. Further incorporation of the electronegative F atom reduces the energy levels and band gap which enhances the absorption of molecules. PSCs based on PBDB-T:IDT2Se and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F active layers offered PCEs up to 9.36% and 11.19%, respectively. Two new NFAs (IDTT-BH and IDTT-OBH) using IDTT with different alkyl side chains as the central core and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalene-1-ylidene)malononitrile (CPNM) as the terminal acceptor unit were designed and synthesized which have the same optical properties. Both NFAs fabricated with different polymer donor materials and a highest PCE of 11.03% were achieved with the J71:IDTT-BH blend film based PSC. Two NFAs (IDTC and IDTO) were designed and synthesized via insertion of alkyl chains and alkoxy chains at the thiophene spacer having IDT as the core and CPTCN terminal acceptor unit (Fig. 17). The alkoxy substituted IDTO acceptor exhibited a hypsochromic (blue) shifted absorption profile compared to the alkyl substituted IDTC acceptor. Non-covalent bonding between O and S atoms enhances the intramolecular interaction which is responsible for the better charge transport of the IDTO acceptor compared to IDTC. IDTC and IDTO acceptors gave a PCE of 10.02% and 9.35% when fabricated with the PBDB-T polymer donor (Table 8).

As we discussed, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are potential alternatives to fullerene derivatives in solution processed BHJ solar cells. In the past few years significant progress has been made in the synthesis of SMNFAs. The ideal acceptor molecule should have specific intrinsic properties such as (1) strong and broad absorption covering the range of 400–850 nm, and it is good if the absorption ranges of donor and acceptor materials are complimentary, (2) a high molar extinction coefficient (εmax), (3) a low band gap and suitable FMO energy level matching with the donor molecule to achieve high Voc, (4) high electron mobility, and (5) good solubility. However, it is very difficult to achieve all the above properties in a single acceptor through molecular engineering. Thus, a far better understanding of the effect of different units on the device performance of NFAs is necessary for developing efficient acceptors. We firstly discussed the effect of end groups on the photovoltaic performance of NFAs. Electron accepting capacities of the molecules varied according to terminal end groups which affect the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of acceptor molecules. Due to the electronegative carbonyl and thiocarbonyl functional groups the rhodanine unit increases the electron deficient properties and the amide alkyl chain increases the solubility of molecules. The rhodanine group reduces the band gap via enhancing conjugation which can cause a red shift in the absorption profile. Further the malononitrile group in dicyano rhodanine enhances the photoelectronic and photovoltaic properties via increasing the conjugation and electron withdrawing characteristics. The electron withdrawing IC group downshifts the LUMO level due to carbonyl and cyano groups which results in improved absorption by reducing the band gap of acceptor molecules. Due to the electronegative and heavy atom effect of halogen atoms, the introduction of different halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br and I) at the IC group lowers the energy of FMOs, and increases the optoelectronic properties of molecules which are advantageous for high Jsc, crystallinity and PCE of OSC devices. Thus, halogenation at the IC end group is an encouraging approach for development of efficient NFAs. Because of the larger size of the Cl atom and larger C–Cl bond length, Cl-IC end group based NFAs are more polar and show more intermolecular π–π packing than IC and X-IC containing NFAs (X = F, Br, I). More intermolecular interactions result in the lowering of FMO energy levels, reducing the band gap and enhancing the absorption of molecules. Hence the more intense and bathochromic shifted absorption spectrum is advantageous for efficient charge generation. In BHJ solar cells Voc is directly proportional to the difference between the HOMOD and LUMOA. The Cl-IC based NFAs have higher lying FMO energy levels than other halogenated IC based NFAs. Hence, the OPV devices based on the Cl-IC end group containing acceptor molecules exhibit high Voc and low Eloss. Incorporation of weak electron donating and less sterically hindered methyl groups at the end group results in the elevated energy of FMO energy levels and increased Voc of the acceptor in OSCs. With increasing the number of methyl groups and length of alkyl chains (from methyl to butyl) at the terminal IC end group there is a negligible effect on the photoelectronic properties of molecules. The mono methyl substituted IC based OPV device shows a uniform morphology which is advantageous for its high charge carrier mobility and high PCE compared to the di-methyl substituted IC based acceptor. The roughness of the blend film increases with increasing the length of alkyl chains and hence the charge carrier mobility and PCE of OPV devices decrease. Thus for the terminal end group molecular engineering with heteroatoms or alkyl groups or aromatics can be done to improve the performance of the molecule as an acceptor.


Although great progress has been achieved in improving the efficiency of non-fullerene OSCs, power conversion efficiency as high as 25% is commonly regarded as the target for enabling commercial viability. To achieve a 25% efficiency new material, interface and device strategies need to be more explored. The new non-fullerene acceptor materials should be designed and developed with more red shifted absorption up to near infrared (NIR) region, low energy band gap with suitable FMO energy levels, low energy loss and high electron mobility beyond that of fullerene derivatives. For the development of a highly efficient NFA a suitable modification of the molecular structure may also enhance the PCE value significantly. In this review, we compare the photovoltaic performance of different acceptors having the same terminal end groups. Molecules with a similar structure will exhibit similar optoelectronic properties and PCE performances. However, some suitable molecular engineering will also bring significantly improved results; for example compared with FBR, the BAF-4CN acceptor has one more malononitrile group at the terminal end group. However, BAF-4CN exhibits better photovoltaic performance with a much higher PCE value of over 8.4% than that of FBR (4.11%). By molecular engineering in IEICO, another NFA IEICO-4F with two fluorine atoms in terminal chromophoric groups was developed. These two NFAs exhibit significantly different photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 8.4% and 10%, respectively.
