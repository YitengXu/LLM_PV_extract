The electrical properties, optical properties and stabilities of hybrid lead iodide perovskite homologous semiconductors with 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D structures have been investigated based on their electronic structures calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The results indicated that the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) estimated according to the absorption spectra of 1D perovskite homologues (1.9–10.9%) and 2D perovskite homologues (4.4–6.9%) are similar. However, the charge transport properties of 1D perovskite homologues (only ∼0% of that of the reference, CH3NH3PbI3) are entirely different from those of 2D perovskite homologues (reaching 43% of that of the reference) when a polycrystalline model has been introduced, although both of them are anisotropic materials. More charge transport paths of 2D perovskite homologues have been found in the polycrystalline state, compared with those of 1D perovskite homologues. Our findings have a great realistic significance to understand the properties of polycrystalline perovskite homologues.

Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have witnessed a spectacular surge in scientific interest, since the first perovskite solar cell (PSC) was reported by T. Miyasaka with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% in 2009. In 2017, the PCE of PSCs has been propelled to a striking record of 22.1%. Although the absorber, CH3NH3PbI3 with a three-dimensional (3D) structure, exhibits great optical and electrical properties, including a high absorption coefficient, a desirable band gap, low exciton binding energy, ambipolar carrier transport, long charge diffusion lengths and unusual defect tolerance, the instability issues still remain as a bottleneck hampering its commercial application. Theoretical studies partially attributed the superior optical and electrical properties of CH3NH3PbI3 to the 6s2 lone pairs of Pb, which cause the antibonding valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) in the high symmetry perovskite structure. Hence, on one hand, researchers have focused on 3D halide compounds containing ns2 lone pairs as the candidates for CH3NH3PbI3, such as perovskites ABX3 and double perovskites A2CDX6 (A = Cs+, MA+, and FA+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+, and Ge2+; C = 1+ cation; D = Bi3+ and Sb3+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−, and SCN−); on the other hand, 2D, 1D and 0D perovskite homologues also attract the investigators' attention due to the smallest octahedral unit (PbI64−) observed in them. For low dimensional perovskite homologues, 2D perovskite homologous solar cells (PHSCs) have been widely explored and the absorbers can be usually expressed as (A)n−1(A2)2PbnI3n+1 (A2 = aminium with a long alkyl chain or aromatic group; n = the number of layers). The PCE of single layer (n = 1) 2D PHSCs (0.1–1.1%) is much lower than that of 3D PSCs, but the optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskite homologues can be tuned by changing their n values. The PCEs increased obviously from 1.2–4.8% (ref. 18, 19 and 22) (n = 2) to 4.0–11.4% (ref. 20, 23 and 24) (n = 3) and to 7.0–16.0% (ref. 24–26) (n > 3) with the increase of n. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, 1D perovskite homologues possess the possibility to serve as absorbers, because of the similar band gaps of 1D (2.56–3.18 eV; single chain) and 2D (2.73–2.98 eV; single layer) perovskite homologues. But in fact, there were no successful attempts reported for 0D and 1D PHSCs. The possible reasons may be the poor charge transport properties of 0D and 1D perovskite homologues, especially in the polycrystalline state.

In this paper, we selected a series of 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid lead iodide perovskite homologous semiconductors from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC), and all of them are the most typical and common ones, such as PbI6(CH3NH3)4(H2O)2 (FOL) with 0D structure, PbI3(C4H4N2)CH3 (BAT), C9N2H17PbI3 (NUG), CH3(CH2)2NHC(CH3)2PbI3 (QEX) and (NH2)2CIPbI5 (YUV) with 1D structure, NH3(CH2)6NH3PbI4 (WOG), NH3(CH2)12NH3PbI4 (AKO), (NH3(NH2)2OH)2PbI4 (NIC) and (CH3NH3)(CH3(CH2)4NH3)2Pb2I7 (UMU) with 2D structure and Cu(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2Pb2I6 (XOC) and CH3NH3PbI3 (3D-MAP) with 3D structure. The electrical properties, optical properties and stability of them have been investigated based on their electronic structures. The theoretical PCEs estimated using Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME) mathematical models were 1.9–10.9% for 1D perovskite homologues and 4.4–6.9% for 2D perovskite homologues according to their absorption spectra. However, the charge transport properties of 1D and 2D perovskite homologues display a big difference. The voltage current characteristics of the polycrystalline model show that 2D perovskite homologues maintain 43% of the electrical conductivity of 3D-MAP, but the electrical conductivity of 1D (both α and β type) perovskite homologues decreases to ∼0% of that of 3D-MAP. There are more charge transport paths in polycrystalline 2D perovskite homologues than those in polycrystalline 1D perovskite homologues. Our results provide reasonable explanations to the fact that 2D perovskite homologues are more easy to fabricate as solar cells compared with 1D perovskite homologues by the traditional preparation processes (spin-coating) of PSCs.

The regular DFT (GGA/PBE) calculated band gap for 3D-MAP is in good agreement with experiments, due to the canceling-out of underestimating GGA and neglecting SOC. And this situation has also been observed for 2D perovskite homologues (Table S3). So, regular DFT calculations were used in this paper. The typical electronic structures of 0D-FOL, 1D-QEX, 1D-YUV, 2D-AKO, 2D-NIC, 2D-UMU, 3D-XOC and 3D-MAP (crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1) are described by the density of states (DOS) and band structures (Fig. 2).

For similarities, the optical and electronic properties of perovskite homologues are mainly determined by the Pb–I framework of 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D perovskite homologues. The VBM contributed by the Pb–I framework is called VBMPb,I, and the CBM contributed by the Pb–I framework is called CBMPb,I. VBMPb,I is derived from the 6s orbital of Pb and the 5p orbital of I. CBMPb,I is derived from the 6p orbital of Pb and a little 5p orbital of I. These behaviours are generally consistent with 3D perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 2h). There might be some bands (BM) between VBMPb,I and CBMPb,I. They are the N–H bond of 0D-FOL (Fig. 2a), the antibonding Π orbital of CH3(CH2)2NHC(CH3)2 of 1D-QEX (Fig. 2b), and the coordination bond in CuM of 3D-XOC (Fig. 2g). These bands can be neglected, because the electron transition between BM and VBMPb,I (CBMPb,I) is hard to happen.
For differences, perovskites with different dimensionalities possess different band structures.
For 0D perovskite homologues (0D-FOL), the VBMPb,I and CBMPb,I gently vary in the Brillouin zone (BZ) and present localization, which results from the fact that there is no electronic coupling between isolated components PbI64− as shown in Fig. 1a.
For 1D perovskite homologues, the α type is totally different from the β type. For α-1D-QEX, the types of VBMPb,I and CBMPb,I are similar to those of 0D-FOL, which means electronic localization in all directions, in spite of the 1D crystal structure of QEX (Fig. 1b). For α-1D-BAT and α-1D-NUG, the electronic structure is similar to that of α-1D-QEX as shown in Fig. S3 and S4. For β-1D-YUV, the VBMPb,I and CBMPb,I along the stretched direction of chains Y (0 0.5 0) → A (0.5 0.5 0) vary more steeply than those along the b axis and c axis (Fig. 2c). The electron gas is dispersive along the a axis in β-1D-YUV.
For 2D perovskite homologues, the single layer perovskite homologues (Fig. 1f–h) possess similar crystal structures to multilayered perovskite homologues (Fig. 1i). The lead atoms and iodine atoms form two-dimensional plate-like meshes with organic components filled between two meshes. For 2D-AKO (Fig. 2d), 2D-WOG (Fig. S5) and 2D-UMU (Fig. 2f), the VBMPb,I and CBMPb,I vary more steeply within the mesh than those perpendicular to the mesh, which means good characteristics of the electronic delocalization in the 2D planes. For 2D-NIC, the distance between the closest I atoms (that make the major contribution to VBMPb,I) in two neighbouring meshes is only 4.232 Å, which enhances the electron coupling between meshes and makes the VBMPb,I dispersive in all directions (Fig. 2e). However the CBMPb,I still exhibits 2D electron delocalization, because the CBMPb,I is mainly derived from the 6p orbital of Pb.
For 3D perovskite homologues, the band structure of the ‘cuboid’ 3D-XOC gently varies along the a axis direction Y (0 0.5 0) → A (0.5 0.5 0) and along the b axis direction A (0.5 0.5 0) → B (0.5 0 0), but the band structures along the direction Z (0 0 0.5) → G (0 0 0) steeply vary (Fig. 2g), which means that the electron coupling is stronger along the c axis. For ‘cuboid’ 3D-MAP, both VBMPb,I and CBMPb,I steeply vary along the a axis direction C (0 0.5 0.5) → E (0.5 0.5 0.5), along the b axis direction G (0 0 0) → Y (0 0.5 0) and along the c axis direction Y (0 0.5 0) → C (0 0.5 0.5), which means electronic delocalization in all directions.

In order to explain why the large difference of band structures exists in perovskites with similar structural dimensionality, such as α type and β type 1D perovskite homologues, the wave functions of 0D-FOL, 1D-QEX, 2D-WOG, 3D-XOC and 3D-MAP have been analyzed. The wave functions are different at different BZ points; herein the wave functions of samples at top of the valence band have been compared. The wave functions VBMG;Pb,I for 0D-FOL, 2D-WOG and 3D-MAP were calculated at point G (0 0 0). For 1D-QEX, the wave functions VBMX;Pb,I were calculated at point X (0 0 0.25). For 1D-YUV, the wave functions VBMA;Pb,I were calculated at point A (0.5 0.5 0). For 3D-XOC, the wave functions VBMZ;Pb,I were calculated at point Z (0 0 0.5), as shown in Fig. 3.

For the smallest octahedral unit, PbI64− of 0D-FOL, the 6s of Pb and 5p of I follow this rule: 6sPb (+)—5pI (−) 5pI (+). And in the 1D periodic system such as β-1D-YUV, the periodic wave function form, —6sPb (+)—5pI (−) 5pI (+)—6sPb (−)—5pI (+) 5pI (−)—, has been found along the chain stretched direction. Similar periodic wave function forms can be found in the 2D periodic system (2D-WOG) and 3D periodic system (3D-MAP). However, in α-1D-QEX and 3D-XOC, another type of periodic wave function form has been found: —6sPb (+)—5pI (−)—6sPb (+)—, due to the vertical alignment of the p orbital of I (Fig. 3b and e), which results from the formation of triple and double Pb–I–Pb bridges instead of a single Pb–I–Pb bridge.
According to a new concept, electronic dimensionality, proposed by David B. Mitzi and Yanfa Yan, we found that the electronic dimensionality of perovskite homologues could be inferior to the structural dimensionality due to the formation of triple and double Pb–I–Pb bridges. Therefore, α-1D perovskite homologues possess 0D electronic dimensionality and 3D-XOC possesses 1D electronic dimensionality. The electronic dimensionality of perovskite homologues can also exceed the structural dimensionality, for example the electronic dimensionality of 2D-NIC is three dimensionality for holes.

The experimental band gap is an important parameter for the S–Q and SLME mathematic models, and 0D-FOL, 1D-BAT, 1D-QEX, 1D-YUV, 2D-AKO, 2D-WOG, 3D-XOC and 3D-MAP possess experimental band gaps, with the simulated absorption spectra shown in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 4a, from 3D-MAP and 1D-QEX to 3D-XOC to 2D-WOG to 2D-AKO to 1D-BAT to 1D-YUV and to 0D-FOL, the edge of the absorption peak gives a blue-shift. All of the 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid lead iodide perovskite homologous semiconductors we calculated exhibit a relatively high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1), owing to the similar constituent part of the VBM (Pb 6s and I 5p) and CBM (Pb 6p and I 5p) to that of CH3NH3PbI3. The intra-atomic Pb 6s to Pb 6p transition probability is high, which makes the VBM–CBM transition probability of perovskite homologues very large.


In order to make a good understanding of the optical and electrical properties of hybrid lead iodide perovskite 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D homologous semiconductors, we introduced PCE simulation models, Shockley–Queisser maximum solar cell efficiency (S–Q) and Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME). The input parameters in S–Q are AM1.5G and band gaps of these materials, and those in SLME are AM1.5G and absorption spectra. Similar PCEs of perovskite homologous semiconductors calculated by S–Q and SLME are shown in Fig. 4b. As shown in Fig. 4b, the perovskite homologous semiconductors with different dimensionalities distribute at the bottom, in the middle and at the top of the curve of S–Q. 0D-FOL is located at the foot of the ‘hill’ (∼0.1%); 1D-QEX, 1D-BAT, 1D-YUV, 2D-WOG, 2D-AKO and 3D-XOC are located at the mountainside (2.0–12.0%); 3D-MAP is located at the ‘mountain’ top (∼30.5%). In SLME, when the absorption spectrum of the material has been taken into consideration, the thickness of the active layer becomes another parameter of the simulated PCE. For a solar cell, the thicker the absorber is, the better the absorbing ability becomes, but the thickness of an absorber should be smaller than the carrier diffusion length. The majority of carriers generated by photons may recombine and decrease the conversion efficiency observably, in case the thickness of the absorber exceeds the carrier diffusion length. According to the values of experiments, the appropriate thickness of the active layer is set to 250 nm, which balances the absorption depth with the carrier diffusion length of these selected materials. Considering the thickness of the active layer and the absorption coefficient, the PCEs were 0.1% for 0D perovskite homologues, 1.9–10.9% for 1D perovskite homologues, 4.4–6.9% for 2D perovskite homologues, 6.6% for 3D perovskite homologues (3D-XOC) and 27.1% for the reference, 3D-MAP. The band gaps of 1D (2.56–3.18 eV) and 2D (2.73–2.98 eV) perovskite homologues are larger than the best gap for a PV absorber (1.0–1.5 eV), which makes the short-circuit current density (Jsc) lower (0.7–5.3 mA cm−2 for 1D perovskite homologues, and 1.8–3.1 mA cm−2 for 2D perovskite homologues) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) larger (2.20–2.74 V for 1D perovskite homologues, and 2.38–2.59 eV for 2D perovskite homologues), compared to those for 3D-MAP (Voc = 1.23 V and Jsc = 24.8 mA cm−2). The simulated fill factor (FF) by using SLME is relatively high (89.8–95.5% for these materials, as shown in Fig. S6) due to the ideal diode model used in SLME. Without taking carrier transport properties into consideration, 1D perovskite homologues seem to possess a similar device performance to 2D perovskite homologues.


For a light absorption layer of solar cells, both a good ability of charge carrier transport and a balanced electron and hole transportation are needed. For the traditional perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAP), the experimental carrier mobility of both electrons and holes is ∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1, which means a fast and balanced electron and hole transportation. From the theoretical point of view, the electron carrier mobility and hole carrier mobility are inversely proportional to the effective electron mass and the effective hole mass. The effective mass (m*) of electrons (holes) can be estimated by fitting the VCM (CBM) to:
where
ε(k) is the energy dispersion relation function described by band structures. The effective masses of the electrons and holes of 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid lead iodide perovskite homologues are shown in Table 1. The difference between the effective mass obtained by the second-order partial derivative method and the polynomial fitting method has been discussed in the Computational Methods Part: 8. Effective masses calculation, including Fig. S2 and Tables S1 and S2.

For 0D perovskite homologues, the structure of 0D-FOL is isotropic, and the average effective masses (Me,abc and Mh,abc) are 6.84 and 3.38, which means that the carrier mobility is low in all directions.
For 1D perovskite homologues, the α type is totally different from the β type. Given the example of α-1D-NUG, there were slight differences between the average effective masses (all effective masses are larger than 1) in the a–b plane (6.79 for Me,ab and 10.41 for Mh,ab) and those along the c axis (3.59 for Me,c and 1.29 for Mh,c along the stretched direction of chains), which means that the carrier mobility is low in all directions. The effective mass property is similar for 1D-QEX and 1D-BAT. For β-1D-YUV, 1D carrier transport properties are present because of the smaller effective masses (0.12 for Me,a and 0.23 for Mh,a along the stretched direction of chains) in the a axis.
For 2D perovskite homologues, the structures of 2D-AKO, 2D-NIC and 2D-WOG are anisotropic. The meshes are formed by Pb and I perpendicular to the a axis in crystal structures. The distances between each two layers of 2D-AKO, 2D-WOG and 2D-NIC are 16.0 Å, 11.9 Å and 10.2 Å. Due to the large interlayer spacing of 2D-AKO, the effective masses of both electrons and holes on the bc plane (0.23 for Me,bc and 0.26 for Mh,bc) are smaller than those along the a axis (32.44 for Me,a and 32.50 for Mh,a), which means that the charge carriers are confined within the 2D meshes. The effective mass property is similar for 2D-WOG and multilayered 2D-UMU. For 2D-NIC with a smaller interlayer spacing, the effective electron mass on the bc plane (0.21 for Me,bc) is smaller than that along the a axis (2.19 for Me,a), but the hole electron mass Mh,bc (0.36) is close to Mh,a (0.50). The result is that the VBM is derived from the 5p-orbital of I and the distance between the closest I atoms in two layers of 2D-NIC is so small that a large electron coupling effect has been created. The crystal structures of 2D-AKO, 2D-WOG and 2D-NIC are anisotropic, and the carrier mobilities are anisotropic.
For 3D perovskite homologues, the effective masses on the bc plane of 3D-XOC (1.67 for Mh,ab and 1.82 for Me,ab) are larger than those along the c axis (0.28 for Mh,c and 0.09 for Me,c), which means that the carrier mobility is higher along the c axis. The carrier mobilities are anisotropic for 3D-XOC. The crystal structures of 3D-MAP are almost isotropic, and the carrier mobilities are almost isotropic (0.29 for Mh,abc and 0.36 for Me,abc).
In general, the electronic dimensionality determines the carrier transport properties in single crystals. 0D and α-1D perovskite homologues with 0D electronic dimensionality present poor carrier transport properties in all directions. β-1D perovskite homologues and 3D-XOC with 1D electronic dimensionality present 1D carrier transport properties. 2D perovskite homologues with 2D electronic dimensionality present 2D carrier transport properties. 3D-MAP with 3D electronic dimensionality presents 3D carrier transport properties.

Normally, materials used as absorbing layers are in a polycrystalline state in the traditional preparation technology of perovskite-based solar cells. As a result, a polycrystalline model was used to discuss the voltage current characteristics of anisotropic materials. To better understand the establishment process of this model, a 2D example is shown in Fig. 5a. Firstly, we set a 2D box with a size of 250 × 250 nm at time t0. Secondly, at time t1, 20 points were created randomly in the box, and every point presents a crystal nucleus with 2D anisotropy. Every point has its independent coordinate system. For example, the coordinate systems for point A and point B are different, which means different orientations of crystal nuclei. Thirdly, we let 20 crystal nuclei grow with the same speed at the same time. The time t2 is a certain time of the crystal growth process. At time t2, the edges of some crystal nuclei came into contact with other crystal nuclei, these crystal nuclei stopped growing in this direction. Finally, when there is no space for crystal nuclei to grow, the polycrystalline model was built completely at time t3. The formed diagram is the so-called 2D Voronoi diagram. In a 3D box with a size of 250 × 250 × 250 nm, we can also use this method to create a 3D polycrystalline model with 50 different crystal nuclei, as shown in Fig. 5b. And then, 1 volt was applied along the z axis direction. The finite element analysis method was introduced to solve the voltage current characteristics and the polycrystalline model was divided into 50 × 50 × 50 small units. From Fig. 5b, when the material possesses an isotropic carrier transport ability, the electric current density is homogeneous around the x, y bottom plane. And if the isotropic carrier transport ability is good, the total x, y bottom plane presents green, which means that the electric current density is about 16 mA cm−2 (as a ‘turn on’ state), like in 3D-MAP. If the isotropic carrier transport ability is poor, the total x, y bottom plane presents blue, which means that the electric current density is close to 0 mA cm−2 (as a ‘turn off’ state), such as in 0D-FOL, α-1D-BAT, α-1D-NUG and α-1D-QEX. Different from isotropic carrier transport materials, when the material possesses an anisotropic carrier transport ability, the electric current density varies around the x, y bottom plane. When the carrier mobilities in a, b and c directions are 10, 10−1 and 10, some areas of the x, y plane present yellow or orange, which means that the electric current density reaches 20, 24 mA cm−2 or higher (as the section of charge transport paths). At the same time, other areas present cyan and blue, which means that the electric current density is 4 or ∼0 mA cm−2. When the carrier mobility in the b direction decreases from 10−1 to 10−2 to 10−3 to 10−4, the electric current density distribution diagram changes very little. From Fig. 5c, we can see that the average electric current density in the x, y plane decreases slowly with the increase of k2 (k2 = log(μa/μb) = log(μc/μb), where μb (μa, μc) is the carrier mobility in the b (a, c) direction, μa = 10 cm2 V−1 s−1). And we fitted with y = A1exp(−x/t1) + y0,2 and found y0,2 = 6.86 mA cm−2, which means no matter how low the carrier mobility in the b direction is, the polycrystalline 2D carrier transport materials can maintain a good carrier transport ability, due to many charge transport paths existing in the polycrystalline state (as a ‘turn on’ state), such as in 2D-WOG, 2D-NIC, 2D-AKO and 2D-UMU. When the carrier mobilities in a, b and c directions are 10−1, 10 and 10−1, similarly, some areas of the x, y plane present a high electric current density, while other areas present a low electric current density. When the carrier mobility in the a and c direction decreases from 10−1 to 10−2 to 10−3 to 10−4, the electric current density distribution diagram changes a lot. The blue area increases rapidly, meaning that more and more areas present a low electric current density. From Fig. 5c, we can see that the average electric current density in the x, y plane decreases rapidly with the increase of k1 (k1 = log(μb/μa) = log(μb/μc), μb = 10 cm2 V−1 s−1). And we fitted with y = A1exp(−x/t1) + y0,1 and found y0,1 = 0.43 mA cm−2, which means that the polycrystalline 1D carrier transport materials may present poor carrier transport due to fewer charge transport paths in the polycrystalline state (as a ‘turn off’ state), such as in β-1D-YUV and 3D-XOC.

So, the 3D carrier transport materials are the best in the polycrystalline model, while the performance of 2D perovskite homologues reached 43% electric conductivity of 3D-MAP. Our estimated value is in line with the reported experimental values (∼6 cm2 V−1 s−1 carrier mobility for polycrystalline 2D perovskite homologues and ∼25 cm2 V−1 s−1 carrier mobility for the reference 3D polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 by using the same measuring method).

We investigated the stability of hybrid lead iodide perovskite homologous semiconductors with 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D structures ((PbI2)n(MI)m, where n and m are different for different materials) by calculating their decomposition energies with respect to possible decomposition pathways. The straightforward and predominate pathway is the decomposition of (PbI2)n(MI)m into corresponding binary materials, such as PbI2 and MI. Usually halide perovskites are synthesized via inverse reactions. As shown in Fig. 6, the formation energies were −0.69 eV for 0D perovskite homologues, −2.27 to −0.99 eV for 1D perovskite homologues, −2.68 to −1.51 eV for 2D perovskite homologues, −0.95 to −0.85 eV for 3D perovskite homologues. The formation energies are negative values, which means that the reaction that generates (MI)m(PbI2)n from PbI2 and MI is an exothermic reaction. The energy of the product is lower than that of reactants, which is the base for (MI)m(PbI2)n to exist in thermodynamics. The absolute values of formation energies for 2D perovskite homologues are larger than those for 0D, 1D and 3D perovskite homologues. 2D perovskite homologues are more stable.


According to the above analysis, the least dimensionality for perovskite homologues which are suitable to fabricate solar cells seems to be two dimensionality. And the 2D perovskite homologues used in this paper are Ruddlesden–Popper type, which is the most common structure according to our statistical data (Fig. S8; Table S10). The theoretical PCEs estimated for single layer 2D perovskite homologues (4.4–6.9%) are much larger than the experimental PCEs (0.12–1.10%, Fig. 7a, Table S9) resulting from the optical and orientation issues. For optical issues, the exciton binding energies (380–540 meV (ref. 20 and 52)) for single layer 2D perovskite homologues are so large, compared with those for CH3NH3PbI3 (10–50 meV). For multilayered 2D perovskite homologues, An−1(A2)2PbnI3n+1, when n increases from 1 to 2 to 3, a critical factor (layer-edge-states) appears, which could potentially trap electrons at the layer-edge and helps excitons dissociate to free carriers, accompanied by the reduction of the binding energy (120–270 meV (ref. 20 and 53)). When n increases from 3 to 4 to 30–60, the reduction of the band gap plays a leading role in the increase of PCE. Fig. 7a shows that when the layer number (n) increased, the band gap reduced and the experimental PCEs increased with the enlarged theoretical PCEs simulated by the S–Q limit.

For issues of orientation (Fig. 7b), some researchers considered that single layer 2D perovskite homologous (n = 1) films showed the preferential orientation parallel to the substrate. When n > 1, a competition arose between BA (C4H9NH3+) and MA (CH3NH3+) ions; BA ions tried to confine the growth within the planar layer, while MA ions expanded the perovskite crystals outside the layer. Consequently, with the increase of n, 2D layered perovskite films tended to grow with the preferential orientation perpendicular to the substrate. And some researchers considered that the carrier transport properties of 2D perovskite homologues with unordered orientation can be improved by the preferential orientation perpendicular to the substrate induced by TiO2 (ref. 54 and 55) or by using the hot-cast method. However, Laura M. Herz et al. observed that single layer 2D perovskite homologues showed the preferential orientation parallel to the substrate, but multilayered (n > 3) perovskite homologues were polycrystalline and powder-like, by using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. For the three viewpoints mentioned above, we made a comprehensive consideration according to our research: the device maintains a ‘turn off’ state for the in-plane orientation, but maintains a ‘turn on’ state for both unordered orientation and out-of-plane orientation, which is a special property for 2D perovskite homologues.

The electrical properties, optical properties and stability of a series of 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D perovskite homologues have been investigated on the basis of their electronic structures. For optical properties, both 1D and 2D perovskite homologues seem to be suitable for wide-band-gap-absorbers. For electrical properties, α-1D perovskite homologues exhibit poor isotropic transport. β-1D perovskite homologues exhibit 1D charge transport properties but also maintain a ‘turn off’ state in the polycrystalline state. However, both single layer and multilayered 2D perovskite homologues exhibit 2D charge transport properties and maintain a ‘turn on’ state in the polycrystalline state. More charge transport paths of 2D perovskite homologues (more close to 3D-MAP) have been observed in the polycrystalline state, compared with those of 1D perovskite homologues.
