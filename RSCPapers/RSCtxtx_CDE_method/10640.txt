To meet the increasing demand for power sources, scientists are continuously trying to improve the efficiency of solar cells. In these circumstances, Cs-based perovskites have attracted attention due to their intriguing performance. In this paper, eight different solar cells based on Cs-halide perovskite absorbers (CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsSnCl3, Cs2BiAgI6, Cs3Bi2I9, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, and Cs3Sb2I9) are investigated using the SCAPS-1D simulation program. Besides, ZnO and CFTS materials are proposed as promising candidates for charge transport material application, along with gold as the back contact. Initially, the impact of the absorber and the electron transport layer (ETL) thickness on the photovoltaic performance was evaluated. In addition, various parameters, such as the thickness, the donor and acceptor densities and the defect density, are investigated to locate the final optimized Cs-based structures. From this optimization, it is evident that among all the optimizing features, absorber materials and the hole transport layer (HTL) thickness, the HTL acceptor density enhanced the performance much more than the other optimizing features. Furthermore, to evaluate the characteristics of these devices, the series resistance, shunt resistance, working temperature, current–voltage density, and quantum efficiency are also simulated. Among all eight Cs-based perovskites, the ITO/ZnO/CsPbBr3/CFTS/Au and ITO/ZnO/Cs3Bi2I9/CFTS/Au devices achieved the best performance, with a conversion efficiency of 19.28% and 19.23%, respectively. Lastly, the performance of the SCAPS-1D simulator software is verified using the wxAMPS simulation program, where both yield results that are in excellent agreement. In conclusion, this research provides useful information for optimizing solar cell architectures and understanding the effects of various device components.

To lessen pollution and climate change caused by the use of traditional fossil fuels, our society is shifting towards gathering renewable sources of electrical energy. Solar cells are the most popular sustainable and cost-effective alternative energy source. An incredible class of materials that have revolutionized the photovoltaic market over the past decade is that of perovskites, which deliver a high conversion efficiency, potentially at a much lower cost. Owing to their low cost-processing, tunable bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, low surface recombination rates, and potential for high conversion efficiency values, researchers have dedicated many years of working to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Since 2009, the performance of hybrid perovskites has increased from 3.8% to 25.6% at present. Hybrid PSCs are popular due to their simple and low cost fabrication. These hybrid perovskites have a high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and a long carrier lifetime. However, the major challenges faced by the photovoltaic (PV) industry with hybrid perovskite technology are its poor stability (it breaks down with time upon exposure to moisture, light, heat, and oxygen), and neurotoxin lead content, which make it unfit for long-term outdoor use and commercial sales, respectively.

Although perovskite technology has come a long way in a very short time, compared with any other PV technology, and it is expected that perovskite technology will come onto the market in the coming 2–3 years. Researchers are working hard to deal with the major roadblocks of stability and the presence of lead to enhance the lifetime, reduce costs and increase the conversion efficiency. To deal with the stability of the perovskite materials, Cs-based planar and inverted perovskites (ABX3: A = Cs; B = Sn, Bi, Ge, Ag, and Sb; and X = I, Br, and Cl) have been reported in the literature as Cs can significantly adjust the characteristics and functionality of PSCs, leading to high device stability in particular. Nowadays, a significant amount of research is being focused on enhancing the stability, reproducibility, and optical features of Cs-based perovskites. It is exciting to see that experimental investigations consistently demonstrate the durability of Cs-based perovskite materials via their stability and growing PCE measurements. Therefore, in this study, we chose to study Cs-based perovskites as they have shown promise in achieving high efficiency values in PV applications and with improved stability and moisture resistance compared with other perovskite materials, such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites.
Among the Pb-based perovskites, CsPbI3-based PSCs have received interest due to their comparable photoelectric properties, bandgap, and increased thermal stability over hybrid perovskites, although CsPbI3-based PSCs have a lower PCE than hybrid perovskite solar cells. For CsPbI3, the rapid change from the black perovskite phase to the yellow orthorhombic non-perovskite phase at room temperature and humidity has hindered its optoelectronic properties. Recently, a CsPbI3-based PSC achieved PCE values of 19.03% and 19.06% using SCAPS-1D simulation. CsPbBr3 has a band gap of 2.3 eV and yet shows good light harvesting and ambient durability. CsPbBr3 exhibits an electron mobility of 1000 cm2 V s−1 and an electron lifetime of 2.5 μs, which are greater than all other cesium-based perovskites. Lead-free Sn-based halide perovskites (CsSnI3 and CsSnCl3) have an enhanced device performance but a strong “self-doping” effect due to the easy oxidation of divalent Sn (Sn2+) to tetravalent Sn (Sn4+), and the low formation energy of Sn vacancies (VSn) results in near-metallic electrical behavior, which leads to poor device reproducibility and reliability. Recently, lead-free A3M2X9 (A = Cs+, M = Bi3+ or Sb3+, X = I−) perovskite-like materials have drawn interest owing to their stability and lower toxicity. The strong carrier mobility, low toxicity, and great absorption coefficient make these absorbers suitable photovoltaic materials. Cs2AgBiI6 is another lead-free perovskite material with a comparable band gap, carrier mobilities, and good moisture stability. CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 perovskite thin films are air-stable and structurally stable due to Goldschmidt's tolerance (0.94) and octahedral (0.4) factors. The high oxidation activity of Ge(II) enables the rapid formation of an ultrathin (5 nm) uniform native-oxide surface passivating layer on the perovskite, providing it with high stability.
To achieve a high performance, the proper selection of ETL and HTL materials is crucial. Some commonly used ETLs for PSCs include TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, and PCBM, while commonly used HTLs include spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA, and PEDOT:PSS. These materials have been extensively studied and optimized due to their compatibility with perovskite materials, high conductivity, and efficient charge transport. However, the choice of the ETL and HTL depends on the specific application and device architecture. To enhance the performance of Cs-based PSCs, both the ETL and HTL play a significant role. In planar Cs-based perovskites, the ETL is crucial for contact selectivity and the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. The ETL pulls electrons to one side of the device and prohibits direct contact between the transparent conductive oxide and the hole-transporting layer. In addition, the ETL affects the shape and loading of the perovskite layer, and controls the quality of the perovskite/ETL interface and the perovskite layer itself. By contrast, inverted Cs-based structures work alike and vice versa. Among commonly used ETLs, ZnO is suitable because of its satisfactory energy level alignment, superior electron mobility, larger size than TiO2, and excellent light transmittance, and compared with TiO2, ZnO has a low-temperature solution production procedure that does not require sintering.
HTLs affect the performance of PSCs as well as their durability and manufacturing cost. HTLs are classified based on their chemical structures and contents, and are classed as inorganic HTLs, small molecule HTLs, and polymeric HTLs. Among these, Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) is considered to be an HTL due to its applications in light-harvesting devices, e.g., in water purification and as the counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Another same-type material, Cu2BaSnS4 (CBTS), is an air-stable, earth-abundant, thin-film material with an adjustable bandgap and a high light absorption. CBTS is already attractive as an HTL material due to these properties. In addition, CFTS nanocrystals with band gaps of 1.3–1.5 eV have been reported and used in photoelectrochemical cells in a few studies.
In this study, using SCAPS-1D (the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulation program) we determined the best Cs-based perovskite among CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsSnCl3, Cs2BiAgI6, Cs3Bi2I9, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, and Cs3Sb2I9 together with ZnO as the ETL, CFTS as the HTL and gold (Au) as the back contact metal. Our objective was to optimize the PSC characteristics of these Cs-based absorbers to enhance their performance. At the same time, we aimed to identify any variation among these absorbers into Cs-based lead-added absorbers and Cs-based lead-free absorbers. There has never been a research project like this before, so the results will be the first of their kind. Physical investigations may be challenging to complete since it requires time and money to investigate all of the materials. In this study, we optimized a variety of PSC characteristics, such as the effect of the absorber layer thickness, the HTL, and the ETL. The acceptor density, donor and defect densities of the absorber layers, ETL and HTL are also investigated to enhance the performance of the PSCs. Besides, the optimized device findings are validated using the wxAMPS (widget provided analysis of microelectronic and photonic structures) program. Finally, the eventual optimized structures were compared with previous studies to showcase their capability in enhancing the conventional PCE.

SCAPS-1D was developed by the University of Gent's ELIS department to simulate perovskite PSCs. SCAPS is flexible PV software that enables a broad variety of device topologies to be designed and investigated, using realistic and precise back-end physical equations to replicate photovoltaic activities such as light capture, exciton formation, charge transport, and recombination. Poisson's equation (eqn (1)) relates to the charges of the electrostatic potential:

(1)
where
ψ denotes the electric potential, εr denotes the relative permittivity, ε0 denotes the permittivity of free space, ND denotes donor density, NA denotes the density of ionized acceptors, n denotes the electron density, p denotes the hole density, ρp denotes the hole distribution, ρn denotes the electron distribution, and q denotes the electric charge.

For the carriers, SCAPS-1D finds solutions to three different equation systems: transport, Poisson, and continuity. Eqn (2) and (3), for determining the carrier continuity, are as follows:
(2)
(3)
Here,
Jn denotes the current density for holes, Jp denotes the current density for electrons, Gn denotes the electron generation, Gp denotes the hole generation, and Rn and Rp denote the electron and hole recombination, respectively.


Eqn (4) and (5) estimate the solar cell electron and hole current densities using charge carrier drift–diffusion:
Jn = qμnn∈ + qDn∂n
(4)
Jp = qμpp∈ − qDp∂p
(5)
Here,
μn and μp denote the mobility of the carriers, Dn and Dp denote the diffusion coefficient of electrons and holes, respectively, and from Einstein's relation the diffusion coefficient relies on the carrier mobility and the carrier lifetime.

SCAPS-1D resolves the Poisson equation and continuity equations for electrons and holes at interfaces and contacts. Eqn (6) defines the fill factor (FF) of the device as:
(6)
Here, Vmp and Jmp denote the voltage and current density at the maximum power points, respectively, JSC denotes the short-circuit current density, and VOC indicates the open-circuit voltage. Defining how the above components combine to create the study's principal results, eqn (7) shows the device efficiency η standardized to the power input Pin:
(7)

Numerical simulations using the wxAMPS software represent Poisson's equation in a one-dimensional space using eqn (8):

(8)
Here, the electrostatic potential is
ψ′, and the concentrations of the ionized donor-like and acceptor-like dopants are ND+ and NA−, respectively. Free electrons and holes are represented by n and p, respectively, whereas trapped electrons and holes are represented by nt and pt, respectively.


Eqn (9) describes free electrons in delocalized conduction band states:
(9)
where the electron current density is represented by
Jn. The net recombination rate occurs due to band-to-band (direct) recombination, and the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) (indirect) recombination traffic that occurs through gap states is denoted using the term R(x).

Similarly, eqn (10) describes the continuity of free holes in delocalized valence band states:
(10)
where the hole current density is represented by
Jp. The net recombination rate occurs due to band-to-band (direct) recombination, and the SRH (indirect) recombination traffic that occurs through gap states is denoted using the term R(x). Eqn (11) shows the rate of net direct recombination:

RD(x) = β(np − ni2)
(11)
In this context, n and p denote the band carrier concentrations in the devices after voltage bias, light bias, or even both types of bias. In addition, β is the proportionality constant for the bandgaps of the cell. The term Gop(x), which stands for the optical generation rate as a function of x owing to externally supplied light, is included in the continuous equation.

Eight Cs-based perovskite solar cell simulations were conducted in the study. Among these one-dimensional structures, both n–i–p planar and p–i–n inverted perovskites are studied. For the n–i–p planar structures, the perovskite, HTL, and ETL are placed in the i-area, p-area, and n-area, respectively. The perovskite i-layer produces an exciton (consisting of an electron–hole pair) when the cell is exposed to light. Because of their sufficient diffusion length, they can penetrate the n(p) area. The exciton separates into its components at the n-layer as well as at the i-layer junction, transporting the electron to the n-layer and the remaining hole to the p-layer. Similarly, the exciton separates at the i-layer and p-layer junction, leading the hole to move to the p-layer and the remaining electron to move to the n-layer. The inclusion of an electrostatic charge in this region between the layers facilitates acceleration of the exciton's dissociation, which enables the transfer of electrons and holes. By contrast, the working of p–i–n inverted structures is the opposite of that for n–i–p planar structures.

In this simulation, indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) was used along with the Cs-based perovskite absorbers of CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsSnCl3, Cs2BiAgI6, Cs3Bi2I9, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, and Cs3Sb2I9. To identify the ideal combination, the PSCs were studied using ZnO as the ETL and CFTS as the HTL (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The SCAPS-1D software package also supports the insertion of an interface defect density at each of the junctions listed in Table 2. The simulations were carried out at a working temperature of 300 K under the AM1.5G 1 solar spectrum with an incident power density of 100 mW cm−2 to assess the impact of the working temperature on the cell efficiency.

Table 1 describes a fixed 800 nm thickness for all absorber layers throughout the initial optimization, along with a 1015 cm−3 acceptor density, and a 1015 cm−3 bulk defect density. Table 2 shows the beginning simulation inputs for each interface defect layer. After the initial simulation, the ITO/ZnO/Cs3Sb2I9/CFTS/Au device showed the lowest performance efficiency among all the devices, of 6.10% (Table 3). By contrast, the ITO/ZnO/CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3/CFTS/Au and ITO/ZnO/CsPbBr3/CFTS/Au devices showed a better performance compared with the others.

Fig. 2(a–h) shows that quasi-Fermi levels Fn and Fp coexist with EC and EV in the Cs-based absorber layers. At the same time, Fp is overlaid on EV in the ZnO ETL, whereas Fn and EC continue harmonically. Here, the band gap of the Cs-based absorbers could play a vital role. From the figure, the bandgaps of the CsPbBr3 and Cs3Sb2I9 absorbers are very close. From Table 3, the performance of these two absorbers validates this statement as well. So, Fp and EV remain at the same level in the CFTS HTL; however, Fn may cross through EC. This stops holes from entering the ZnO ETL and electrons from entering the HTL. The rear contact may collect holes from the HTL, whereas the front contact can collect electrons from absorber layers. By contrast, the bandgap values of other Cs-based bandgap do not support passing electrons and holes from the CFTS HTL and ZnO ETL. The back metal contact of gold has a 5.1 eV work function, and the front contact is made of indium dioxide, which has a 4.0 eV work function.



Fig. 3–6 show the contour maps of the projected VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE, respectively, for the Cs-based PSCs with a changing ETL thickness (from 10 nm to 500 nm) and perovskite thickness (from 100 nm to 1300 nm). As shown in Fig. 3, the VOC is found to be 0.892 V for the Cs3Bi2I9 device with absorber and ETL thicknesses of 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively (Fig. 3(e)). Moreover, the VOC of Cs2BiAgI6 is 0.713 V, which is the lowest among all the Cs-based perovskites (Fig. 3(g)). With the increase in the absorber and ETL thicknesses, the VOC of the devices tends to decrease. The JSC for all the Cs-based devices is depicted in Fig. 4. The maximum output is 28.10 mA cm−2 for both the CsSnI3 and CsSnCl3 heterostructures, with an absorber and ETL thickness of 1000 nm and 200 nm, correspondingly, for both devices (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). Among all the devices, CsPbBr3 showed the lowest JSC of 16.58 mA cm−2 when the perovskite and ETL thicknesses are about 800 nm and 150 nm, respectively (Fig. 4(b)). For all the devices, JSC increased with the absorber thickness between 800 and 1200 nm and the ETL thickness of less than 200 nm. Beyond these thicknesses, the JSC of all the devices decreases drastically. Fig. 5 shows the FF values for all the devices, where 81.90% is the maximum FF for the Cs3Bi2I9 device at an absorber and ETL thickness of 100 nm and 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 5(e)). By contrast, the lowest FF is 69.10% for CsSnI3 and CsSnCl3 when the absorber and ETL thicknesses are 100 nm and 10 nm, respectively, for both devices. An absorber thickness of ≥600 nm and an ETL thickness of ≥100 nm show a tendency to decrease the FF for all Cs-based devices.

Finally, Fig. 6 illustrates the efficiency for all the devices, where both CsSnI3 and CsSnCl3 show a maximum PCE of 10.50%. For this, the absorber thickness is 200 nm, and the ETL thickness is 30 nm. Moreover, the CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, Cs3Sb2I9, and CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 devices show similar levels of performance, at 8.04%, when the absorber and ETL thicknesses are 200 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The performance of all the devices tends to decrease with the increase in the absorber and ETL thicknesses, which is similar to a previous study.

The thickness of the absorber layer in a PSC can have a significant effect on the performance of the cell. The absorber layer is the layer of perovskite material that absorbs light and converts it into electricity. In general, thicker absorber layers lead to a higher efficiency for the solar cell, although there are trade-offs that need to be considered. As the thickness of the absorber layer increases, the absorption of light in the material also increases, leading to a higher efficiency. However, when the thickness of the absorber layer becomes too large, the charge carriers in the material may experience recombination before they can be collected at the electrodes, leading to a lower efficiency. Researchers are working to optimize the thickness of the absorber layer in order to achieve the highest possible efficiency while also addressing issues such as cost and stability. In summary, the thickness of the perovskite layer is one of the most crucial parameters that affect the performance of PSCs, although it is not the only one. Therefore, it is important to find the optimal balance between the thickness of the absorber layer and the conversion efficiency.

Hence in this study, for CsPbI3, CsSnCl3, Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9, and Cs2BiAgI6 we varied the absorber thickness from 50 nm to 1300 nm; for CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, and CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 the thickness was varied from 300 to 1300 nm. The change in the PV characteristics with the absorber thickness for all PSCs is shown in Fig. 7(a).
At the time of optimization, VOC decreases with the absorber thickness for all Cs-based PSCs apart from CsSnI3 and CsPbBr3 (Fig. 7(a)). This decreasing tendency is caused by charge recombination sites being distributed across the film. The increasing thickness increases the recombination of light-generated charge carriers due to low diffusion length compared with the thickness of the absorber layer.Fig. 7(a) shows that, except for CsSnI3, JSC increases for all PSCs with increasing thickness until it reaches a certain thickness value that is related to the diffusion length, which is different from one material to another. The increasing thickness enhances the generation of electron–hole pairs and the current density. Despite this, recombination centers and matrix defects increase. These two forces have an inverse effect on all the PSCs. Moreover, the FF decreases for all Cs-based PSCs apart from CsSnI3 and CsPbBr3. Because the FF is a qualitative measure of the electron–hole pair's ability to move through the cell without recombination or other potential losses, and positive and negative charge carriers must pass through the active layer to reach the HTL and ETL, this drop is due to the higher series resistance and a weaker electric field across the photoactive layer. The efficiency of all the PSCs decreased at both a lower thickness and a higher thickness, because thin absorbers can absorb only a small number of photons and thick ones can convert only a small amount of power. Under these circumstances, a balance between light absorption and carrier mobility is required. For all the Cs-based PSCs, the optimized results were used for the subsequent studies.

The thickness of the ZnO ETL was varied from 30 nm to 500 nm to optimize the performance of all Cs-based PSCs. The ETL, owing to its higher bandgap, is almost transparent to the spectrum used by PSCs and enables the coupling of photons to the underlying perovskite absorber layer. From Fig. 7(b), the variation of the ETL thickness affects the PV parameters of the devices only slightly. With increasing ETL thickness, there is a negligible decrease in the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE due to the transparent nature of the ETL. A thicker ETL partially absorbs light and delays the rate at which charges are collected in the external circuits. The suitable selection of the ETL for individual PSCs can decrease the recombination current while transmittance can be enhanced. It is clear from the findings that the thickness of the ZnO ETL has little impact on the Cs-based PSCs, which is identical to previous studies. So, 50 nm is the optimal ETL thickness for all the Cs-based PSCs apart from the CsPbBr3 absorber.


To determine the ideal HTL thickness, the thickness of the CFTS HTL was varied from 50 nm to 500 nm. Fig. 7(c) depicts its impact on the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE performance characteristics of the PSCs. From 50 nm to 150 nm, the performance of all the Cs-based PSCs increases except for CsSnI3. After that, the performance of the Cs-based PSCs is unaffected. In the case of the n–i–p structures, a p-type layer (HTL) must be thicker than an n-type layer (ETL), which enhances the safe transport of the charge carriers to the terminal and lessens the possibility of recombination and related issues. As a result, the optimal thickness of an HTL ought to be greater than the optimal thickness of an ETL; this trend was followed for all Cs-based PSCs. In addition, increasing the thickness of the HTL makes the light-harvesting layer more capable of collecting photons, which is advantageous. For all the Cs-based PSCs, the optimized results were used for the subsequent studies.

From Fig. 7(c) is it seen that the performance of CsSnI3 is not affected by the HTL thickness. The reason for this can be explained as follows: CsSnI3 is a direct bandgap material with a high absorption coefficient, which means that it can efficiently absorb light and generate charge carriers. These unique properties of CsSnI3 make it relatively insensitive to the thickness of the HTL in PSCs. The HTL is typically used to facilitate the extraction of holes from the perovskite layer and to reduce the recombination of charge carriers, thereby improving the overall performance of the PSC. However, in the case of CsSnI3, the high absorption and efficient charge carrier generation and extraction can compensate for any variation in the HTL thickness, resulting in a consistent performance across a range of HTL thicknesses. This is in contrast to other perovskite materials which may be more sensitive to the thickness of the HTL because of differences in their optoelectronic properties. Therefore, the insensitivity of CsSnI3 to the HTL thickness is probably a result of its unique material properties, and highlights its potential as a robust and stable candidate for PSC applications.
If we compare Fig. 7(b) and (c), it is clear that the HTL thickness has a more obvious influence on device performance than the ETL thickness. The reason for this can be explained as follows. The use of a ZnO-based ETL with a high transparency and carrier mobility in the PSC contributes to the device's insensitivity to variation in the ETL thickness. By contrast, the CFTS HTL with a bandgap of 1.3 eV plays a critical role in photon absorption and carrier generation in the device. Therefore, increasing the thickness of the HTL layer enhances the photon absorption, leading to a corresponding increase in the JSC of the device. Notably, the VOC and FF remain mostly unaffected by HTL thickness variation. Overall, an increase in the JSC results in a higher PCE of the device. Consequently, the device performance is more sensitive to a variation in the HTL thickness variation than it is to the ETL thickness.

The acceptor density (NA) in the perovskite absorber layer is an important parameter that can affect the performance of a perovskite solar cell. Increasing the acceptor density can lead to a higher VOC and efficiency, but if it is too high it can lead to increased recombination and a poor charge balance. Therefore, it is important to find the optimal balance between the acceptor density and other factors to achieve the highest possible efficiency and stability. In addition, the performance of the solar cell device is impacted by the electrical behavior of the absorbers, which is influenced by NA. The acceptor density of most Cs-based absorbers was varied from 109 cm−3 to 1018 cm−3, whereas for CsSn0.5Ge0.5I6 it was varied from 109 cm−3 to 1021 cm−3, to better understand how NA affects the PV characteristics.


Fig. 8(a) illustrates that VOC is stable at NA = 1016 cm−3 and rapidly increases when NA surpasses 1017 cm−3. This is due to an increase in the built-in potential at the collecting interfaces, which results in a higher potential across the absorber layer and a higher VOC. At NA = 1018 cm−3, the fill factor reaches a maximum for the studied absorbers. A higher NA is unfavorable for increasing impurity (p-type) scattering and the Auger recombination rate, which inhibits hole transportation and prevents an increase in the FF and VOC, and a higher PCE value. A suitable doping concentration is chosen to acquire an improved FF and JSC. The perovskite's semi-conductive character transforms into a metallic nature with an excessive NA, impeding the carrier transport mechanism. Thus, the optimal findings of the Cs-based absorber were included in the next steps of this study.

The defect density in the perovskite absorber layer can have a significant effect on the performance of a PSC. Defects in the perovskite material can refer to a variety of different types of defects, such as lattice defects, chemical defects, or electronic defects. These defects can act as recombination centers for charge carriers, reducing the overall efficiency of the solar cell. Increasing the defect density in the absorber layer can lead to a lower efficiency of the solar cell. This is because a higher defect density leads to more recombination centers for the charge carriers, which reduces the overall current generated by the cell. Defects can also trap charge carriers, reducing the charge carrier lifetime and hence the efficiency. Another important factor that affects the performance of the PSC is the stability of the solar cell over time. Defects can also lead to the instability of the perovskite layer, making it more susceptible to degradation under the operating conditions.

The quality of the perovskite layer, the purity, and the homogeneity of the material can affect the performance of the cell and its stability. A higher quality layer, with better homogeneity and a purer composition, can lead to a better performance and stability. In summary, the defect density in the perovskite absorber layer is an important parameter that can affect the performance and stability of a PSC. Increasing the defect density can lead to a lower efficiency and stability issues, Therefore, the impact of the defect density is studied in this subsection to provide more insight. During optimization, to get the most out of the absorbers, both the electron- and hole-capture cross-sections were maintained at 10−15 and 10−15 cm2, respectively, and a Gaussian distribution with an energy level of 0.6 eV was used for all the absorbers.

Fig. 8(b) illustrates the relationship between the defect density level and the PV parameters upon varying the absorber defect density (Nt) from 109 to 1018 cm−3. There was no significant change in the PV parameters until the defect density of the Cs-based absorbers reached 1015 cm−3, and the PV parameters tend to decrease from 1016 cm−3. The devices lose their semi-conducting properties, and the formation of a suitable p–n junction is hampered when the defect concentration exceeds the defect concentration of the absorber layer. As a result, the device's efficiency and performance are decreased. This decline in performance is caused by the SRH non-radiative recombination defined in eqn (12) and (13), which is a key cause of the device lifetime reduction and carrier recombination.

τ = 1/[σ × Nt × Vth]
(13)
Here, the capture cross-section of electrons and holes is denoted by σ, the lifetime of electrons and holes is denoted by τ, and the thermal velocity of charge carriers is denoted by Vth. As the PV parameters decrease drastically after 1015 cm−3, achieving the best performance of the absorber's defect density will be appropriate. The optimal defect density of the Cs-based absorber was used for the subsequent studies.


Fig. 9(a) depicts the variation of the PCE, FF, JSC, and VOC for solar cells with different Cs-based absorbers as a function of the ETL (ZnO) donor density (ND). To find the ideal ND of the ETL, the ND of ZnO was changed from 1013 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3. For the Cs-based absorbers, with an increase in ND, the PV parameters were stable and remained unchanged.

For optimization, from 1013 cm−3 to 1020 cm−3, the VOC values for all the Cs-based absorbers were unchanged. Except for CsSnI3, the JSC values of all the other absorbers remained unchanged and stable. For FF and PCE, Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9, and CsSnI3 changed after 1017 cm−3, whereas for the other Cs-based absorbers these parameters remained unchanged. Overall, we may state that, for optimization of the above parameters for these Cs-based absorbers, a change in ND shows little effect. The optimal findings of this study were included in the next steps of this investigation.


Fig. 9(b) illustrates the effect of the defect density (Nt) of the ETL (ZnO) on the PCE, FF, JSC, and VOC. To obtain the desired Nt of the ETL, the Nt of ZnO was optimized from 1011 to 1017 cm−3. For all Cs-based absorbers, with a change in Nt the electrical parameters remained constant.

During optimization, the VOC of CsPbI3 achieved the lowest value, and by contrast, CsSnI3 achieved the highest VOC. Like VOC, among the Cs-based devices, CsSnI3 achieved the lowest JSC, and CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 achieved the highest JSC. In the case of the FF, CsSnCl3 achieved the lowest FF, and CsPbBr3 achieved the highest FF. The PCE of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 was the highest and the PCE of CsPbI3 was the lowest. From these findings, increasing the defect density has no effect on the PV parameters. The optimal findings of this study were included in the next steps of the investigation.


Fig. 10(a) shows the impact of varying the acceptor density concentration (NA) of the CFTS HTL from 1015 to 1021 cm−3 on the PV performance of the Cs-based PSCs.

From the device optimization, the PV performance of the CsSnI3 device remained unchanged and stable upon increasing the NA. The VOC increased from 1019 cm−3 upon increasing the NA. In the case of the JSC, a decreasing trend was seen from 1017 cm−3 as NA was increased. Moreover, the FF increased from 1017 cm−3 with an increase in NA; from 1017 cm−3, the PCE of all the devices decreased except for CsSnI3 and CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3. We can state that with an increase in the HTL NA, the performance of the PCE tends to decrease. Thus, the optimal findings were included in the next steps of this study.


Fig. 10(b) depicts how the defect density concentration (Nt) of the CFTS HTL affects the PV performance in terms of the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE. To determine the optimum performance, the HTL Nt was modified from 1012 cm−3 to 1018 cm−3 for the Cs-based devices. With the increase in Nt, the PV parameters of the CsSnI3-based device remained unchanged and stable. With the increase of Nt for the other Cs-based devices, the PV parameters like VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE decreased from 1016 cm−3; before 1016 cm−3, the device performance was constant and unchanged. From these findings, the performance of the Cs-based devices decreases with an increase in Nt. The optimized performance of the devices was included in the next steps of this study.



Fig. 11(a) shows how the PV parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) are affected by variation of the Nt of the CFTS HTL/Cs-based absorber layer interface, which was varied from 1010 cm−2 to 1022 cm−2. At the interface between the absorber and the HTL, charge recombination must be minimized for carrier extraction to function properly.

From the optimization measurements, the performance characteristics of the Cs-based devices all changed except for CsSnI3. In general for these devices, the performance decreased with the increase in Nt. The presence of defect states reduces VOC, JSC, and the FF, which in turn affects the efficiency of the PSC. However, flaws in the absorber layer affect the device performance more than flaws in the CFTS HTL. This makes sense because the absorber layer captures the majority of the light. As a result, the impact on the carrier lifetime and recombination rate will be greater. The literature on the CFTS-based HTL and an absorber layer demonstrate a good effectiveness at low defect densities. Thus, the optimal findings were included in the next steps of this study.


Fig. 11(b) indicates how the PSC characteristics (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) are influenced by variation of the defect density (Nt) at the interface between the Cs-based absorber layer and the ZnO ETL, from 1010 cm−2 to 1018 cm−2. For carrier recombination to function properly, charge recombination at the interfaces between the Cs-based absorber and the ETL must be kept to a minimum.

The performance characteristics of the Cs-based devices were impacted as a result of the optimization. During optimization, the performance of all Cs-based devices decreased with the increase in Nt. The ionization energy (IA) of the HTL should be lower than that of the perovskite to extract holes at the ZnO/Cs-based absorber interface, whereas the electron affinity (EA) of ZnO should be greater than that of the perovskite to extract electrons at the ZnO/Cs-based absorber interface. An energy level mismatch at the ZnO/Cs-based absorber interface affected the VOC and JSC. Thus, the initial value 1010 cm−2 was chosen as an optimal result for all the PSCs.

In PSCs, the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the cell. RS refers to the resistance that the current encounters as it flows through the various layers of the cell. This can include the resistance of the electrodes, the perovskite layer, and any other layers that are present. A high series resistance can lead to a decrease in the overall efficiency of the cell, as some of the current is lost as heat rather than being converted into electrical energy. This can be mitigated using materials and structures that have a low resistance, such as using highly conductive transparent electrodes.


R
SH refers to the resistance that the current encounters as it tries to bypass the active layers of the cell. In PSCs, the RSH can occur when there are defects or impurities in the perovskite layer. These defects can act as “short circuits” that allow current to bypass the active layers, reducing the overall efficiency of the cell. To reduce RSH, researchers often focus on improving the quality of the perovskite layers, for example, using high-quality precursors and reducing the number of impurities. In summary, both RS and RSH can greatly impact the overall performance of PSCs; thus, Sections 3.9.1 and 3.9.2 are devoted to analyzing the effect of the series and shunt resistance on the performance of the PSCs under consideration.


Fig. 12(a) shows the impact of RS on the ITO/ZnO/Cs-based absorber/CFTS/Au devices in the range of 0–6 Ω cm2, while RSH is constant at 105 Ω cm2. The figure shows how the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE change with variation of the series resistance.

The series resistance affects the FF and JSC device performance characteristics. Fig. 12(a) shows that the fill factor decreases with an increase in the series resistance. In PSCs, a high series resistance reduces the conversion efficiency, and in these PSCs the series resistance affected the PCE and FF.
(14)
(15)
Here, eqn (14) is used to analyze the effect of the series resistance on a Cs-based device's performance, where eqn (15) represents the equivalent circuit. Here IL and ISC denote the light-induced current and the short circuit current, respectively, and RSH denotes the shunt resistance. It is evident from the above equation that the value of ISC decreases with an increase in the series resistance. This is the main reason for the decrease in efficiency as well as the FF. At lower resistance values, the PSCs exhibit an enhanced performance with a higher FF value.


Fig. 12(b) shows the impact of RSH on the ITO/ZnO/Cs-based absorber/CFTS/Au devices in the range of 10–107 Ω cm2, while RS is constant at 0.5 Ω cm2. The figure shows how the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE change with variation of the shunt resistance.

The RSH is induced by manufacturing flaws. A higher RSH changes the p/n junction into a low-resistance route for junction current flow. According to our studies, the RSH affects the VOC, FF, and PCE of the Cs-based absorbers. The figure shows a change for RSH from 10 to 103 Ω cm2, where the performance changes significantly. The performance stabilized from 105 to 107 Ω cm2. In a prior investigation, despite the shunt resistance exceeding 8000 Ω cm2, the VOC climbed but the JSC remained almost constant. The device's FF and PCE increased steadily with the shunt resistance value of 8000 Ω cm2. Thus, the PV parameters of all of the studied Cs-based absorbers changed with an increase in RSH.

Temperature can have a significant impact on the performance of PSCs. As the temperature of the cell increases, the efficiency of the cell typically decreases. This is because the increased temperature can lead to the increased recombination of charge carriers, which reduces the overall current produced by the cell. In addition, the increased temperature can lead to degradation of the perovskite material, which can further reduce the efficiency of the cell. One of the main effects of temperature on PSCs is a change in the VOC, where, as temperature increases, the VOC decreases. The reason for this is that the bandgap of the perovskite material increases with temperature, which leads to a reduction in the voltage at which the cell can generate electricity.

Another effect of temperature on perovskite solar cells is a change in the FF, which is a measure of how well the current is flowing through the cell, and as the temperature increases, the FF also decreases. This is because the temperature-dependent recombination process of the carriers takes place more frequently and leads to less current being generated by the cell. To mitigate the effects of temperature on PSCs, researchers often focus on developing materials and structures that are more stable at high temperatures. This can include using heat-resistant perovskite materials or designing the cell to dissipate heat more effectively. There are also techniques to increase the stability of the perovskite material under high temperatures, such as thermal treatment, which has been used to improve the performance of cells.
In summary, the temperature can greatly impact the performance of PSCs, by reducing both the VOC and the FF. Thus, a detailed study is reported in this section to understand the impact of the operating temperature on the PSC performance. Photovoltaic properties like the bandgap, resistance, charge carrier mobility and material concentrations are affected by the temperature. All PV parameters are satisfactory at room temperature, even though solar cells work better at lower temperatures. Higher temperatures hinder performance. To understand the behavior of our Cs-based PSCs, the operational temperature was increased from 275 K to 475 K while other parameters remained constant under 1000 W m−2 light.
From Fig. 12(c), JSC and VOC both increase as the device temperature is increased. Temperature increases reverse the saturation current, reducing open circuit voltage. Moreover, temperature affects the short-circuit current density. At high temperatures, the bandgaps are reduced and generate more electron–hole pairs. Thus, temperature increases short-circuit current density. The dependence of the open circuit voltage on the temperature can be expressed using eqn (16) and (17):
(16)
(17)
where the variables
VOC, JSC, JO, T, Eg, q, n, and k defines open circuit voltage, short current density, reverse saturation current, temperature, bandgap, electronic charge, ideality factor, and Boltzmann constant, respectively. For all the Cs-based absorbers, the FF and PCE also tend to decrease with the increase in temperature. The increase in temperature will raise the recombination scattering phenomena that cause mobility degradation, which in turn increases the series resistance.


This section displays data on the J–V curves of the eight Cs-based PSCs with an optimized device arrangement. Fig. 13(a) and (b) focus on the before and after optimization of the Cs-based devices, respectively. From the results, the un-optimized devices showed poor J–V curves since some s-shaped curves are observed in Fig. 13(a). These variations showed higher resistive losses and power loss in the un-optimized devices compared with the optimized devices shown in Fig. 13(b). The s-shaped behavior was completely absent in the optimized devices.



Fig. 13(c) and (d) represent the relationship between the wavelength (λ) and the quantum efficiency (QE). The figure signifies the QE that was calculated for the eight Cs-based PSCs both before and after the optimization procedure. During the study, the wavelength range used for the QE was 300–1000 nm.

Before optimization, among the Cs-based PSCs, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 showed the best performance from 300 nm to 850 nm, whereas CsSnI3 showed a lower QE for this wavelength range. After optimization, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 and CsSnI3 showed the best and least QE, respectively, from 400 nm to 850 nm. An increase in the absorber layer thickness shows an improvement in the QE.


Table 4 shows the final optimized and further implemented parameters of the ITO/ZnO/Cs-based absorber/CFTS/Au devices. Among all the studied devices, the thickness and the defect density of the absorbers, the ZnO ETL and the CFTS HTL were all optimized. At the same time, the acceptor density of the absorbers and the CFTS HTL, and the donor density of the ZnO ETL were optimized. Between the devices, all of the listed parameters that were affected during optimization enhanced the performance significantly.

Table 5 demonstrates the results of both SCAPS-1D and wxAMPS simulations using the final optimized parameters of Table 4. As with SCAPS-1D, the wxAMPS simulation software was run at a working temperature of 300 K with an AM1.5G 1 sun spectrum. Among all the studied Cs-based perovskites, the trends produced using the wxAMPS software were very similar to those obtained using the SCAPS-1D simulator. The differences between the results for all the Cs-based absorber configurations were similar to the findings of previous studies. Thus, SCAPS-1D simulation was validated through wxAMPS simulation. Furthermore, in comparison to our numerical study, the recent experimental outcomes of the CsPbBr3- Cs3Bi2I9-, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3-, and Cs3Sb2I9-based perovskites were very effective concerning their performance, which offers a new dimension for future studies.

In this study, Cs-based PSCs with a ZnO ETL and a CFTS HTL were investigated using the SCAPS-1D simulation program. A holistic optimization strategy was adopted to determine the best Cs-based perovskite solar cell design parameters, such as the effect of (i) the thickness and defect density variation of the Cs-based absorber, the ZnO ETL layer, and the CFTS layer, (ii) the acceptor densities of the absorber and the HTL, (iii) the donor density of the ETL, and (iv) the interface defect density of the CFTS HTL/absorber interface and the absorbers/ZnO ETL interface, which were investigated and the results are summarized below:

1. The thickness variations of the Cs-based absorbers and the CFTS HTL were found to significantly enhance the performance of all the device structures when compared with variations in the thickness of the ETL.
2. The PCE showed a similar performance trend to the variation of the absorber and ETL thickness when compared with all studied Cs-based devices.
3. It has been observed that the effect of the HTL thickness on device performance is more pronounced than that of the ETL thickness, with optimal HTL thickness ranging from 100 to 200 nm.
4. In the studied Cs-based absorbers, the device performance was found to improve with an increased acceptor density in the HTL, while variations in the absorber and ETL defect densities had less of an impact during optimization.
5. In addition, the impact of crucial parameters, such as the series and shunt resistance values and the temperature, were thoroughly examined. It was found that the CsPbBr3- and Cs3Bi2I9-based absorbers exhibited an improved performance compared with other types of absorber.
6. Of all the optimized devices, the CsPbBr3 and Cs3Bi2I9 absorber-based structures displayed the highest performance improvement, with PCE values of 19.28% and 19.23%, respectively. Conversely, the CsPbI3-based structure exhibited the lowest PCE among all the devices.
In conclusion, the results obtained from SCAPS-1D and wxAMPS simulations demonstrate a strong correlation, indicating the high precision of the numerical data obtained from SCAPS-1D. In addition, the CsPbBr3-, Cs3Bi2I9-, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3-, and Cs3Sb2I9-based absorbers showed an improved performance compared with recent experimental studies. This suggests that these absorbers have the potential to provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based devices.

The raw/processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also form part of an ongoing study.
