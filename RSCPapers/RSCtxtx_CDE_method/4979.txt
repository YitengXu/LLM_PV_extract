A novel hole transport layer (HTL) composed of ultrathin two-dimensional, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) sheets decorated with 20 nm gold nanoparticles (NPs) (MoS2@Au) was developed to make use of plasmonics for organic solar cells (OSCs). Both experimental and theoretical simulations revealed that the device with the MoS2@Au composite as the HTL exhibited enhanced short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and efficiency compared to that with MoS2 alone as the HTL.

The employment of light trapping based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of metallic nanostructures has proven to be a promising strategy to improve light harvesting for organic solar cells (OSCs). Such efficient light trapping and coupling strategies achieve the balance between charge transport and light absorption required to improve the efficiency of thin film photovoltaics. Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) are the most widely utilized sub-wavelength antennas for two primary reasons. Firstly, the plasmonic near-field can be coupled with the adjacent photoactive materials to effectively increase the cross-section of absorption. Secondly, metallic NPs can also be used as sub-wavelength scattering elements to prolong the optical path of the incident light within the photoactive layer.

We have previously shown that large-sized, metallic NPs can reflect and scatter light better than smaller ones. However, small-sized NPs (i.e., <50 nm) are a much better choice because of the ultra-thin layers of the OSC devices. For these small-sized NPs, enhanced light trapping is mainly contributed by plasmonic near-field enhancement instead of by plasmonic scattering effects. Because the spatial arrangement of the enhanced optical absorption is confined to the area close to the metal surface, the most straightforward and efficient way to achieve enhancement is to place metallic NPs in the photoactive layer where the near-field enhancement of electromagnetic fields from the LSPR generates enhanced light absorption in the active materials surrounding the NPs. Nevertheless, in this approach, the possibility of carrier recombination and exciton quenching between the active materials and the metallic NPs through the non-radiative energy transfer may also increase. In addition, the incorporation of NPs into the active layer may induce the formation of unfavorable film morphologies and disturb the donor–acceptor phase distribution, depressing the exciton separation and charge collection. As a result, even though there are numerous methods to successfully embed metallic NPs in the interfacial layers [e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)] adjacent to the photoactive layers, the direct incorporation of plasmonic NPs into the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer of OSC devices remains an urgent challenge.
Very recently, chemically-exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been reported to be a novel hole transport material with the potential to replace traditional PEDOT:PSS in OSCs. MoS2 is a layered two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide material. A single layer of MoS2 (thickness of 0.65 nm) consists of two planes of hexagonally-arranged sulfur atoms linked to a hexagonal plane of Mo atoms via covalent bonds; in its pristine bulk form, the individual layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces. The chemical exfoliation method and subsequent solution-based thin film formation facilitates their optoelectronic applications. Normally, the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer used in OSCs is approximately 40–50 nm, which might mask most plasmonic effects produced by the NPs embedded inside the PEDOT:PSS layer. In contrast, ultrathin MoS2 layers consisting of 2D MoS2 sheets of atomic thicknesses have the potential to template Au NPs and maximize the plasmonic effects of NPs for OSCs. It is possible to realize such Au NPs on ultrathin 2D MoS2 layers that touch but do not seriously influence the subsequently deposited BHJ layer; thus, the plasmonic near-field effects generated by the Au NPs can efficiently extend into the BHJ layer.
Based on this concept, we designed a novel hybrid structure of Au NPs decorated on 2D MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2@Au). Such MoS2@Au composite thin films act as a multi-functional hole transport layer (HTL) for OSCs, and the MoS2 thin film serves as a hole extraction material that facilitates hole collection at the anode. The Au NPs function as sub-wavelength antennas where the plasmonic near-field can be coupled with the photoactive materials to effectively increase the cross-section of absorption. By employing MoS2@Au HTL in poly{[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]}/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7/PC71BM) blend solar cells, we indeed achieved 15.6% and 17.3% enhancements in the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE), respectively, compared to the OSCs with a 2D MoS2 layer without Au NPs. The experimental results agree well with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations.
MoS2@Au composite sheets were synthesized on a large scale by a simple and low-cost solution process where 20 nm Au NPs (Fig. 1a) were introduced onto the surface of pre-synthesized MoS2 nanosheets. MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized by a chemical method combining lithium intercalation and exfoliation followed by exhaustive dialysis. A majority of the MoS2 sheets have a thicknesses of approximately 1 nm and lateral sizes of 200–300 nm, suggesting that the monolayer morphology was generated by this method (Fig. 1b and S1). The high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image in Fig. 1c reveals the individual Mo and S atoms and their honeycomb arrangement. Compared to the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bulk MoS2, all peaks except the one corresponding to the (002) plane disappeared from the spectrum of the MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. S2). This is primarily because of the fact that the MoS2 sheets exhibit preferred orientations on the substrate, and the (002) plane is thermodynamically stable. Au NPs with sizes of 20 nm were synthesized using the Frens method (Fig. 1a), followed by decorating them onto the MoS2 surface which was achieved by simply mixing the MoS2 and Au NPs colloidal suspensions at different volumetric ratios. Fig. 1d–f show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the MoS2@Au composites with different Au coverages which were obtained using mixing ratios of 5 vol%, 12.5 vol%, and 20 vol%, respectively. A higher magnification TEM image of MoS2@Au composites with an Au decoration of 12.5 vol% is shown in Fig. S3. The Au NPs on the MoS2 surface clearly have a uniform size of 20 nm with negligible aggregation, and the quantity of Au NPs on the MoS2 surface is increased by increasing the mixing ratio. In addition, Au NPs were selectively adsorbed onto the MoS2 surface; no individual Au NPs were observed outside of the surface, as indicated by the red area in Fig. 1d. The decoration is believed to occur on both sides of the MoS2 sheets and might be driven by the interaction between the metal surface and the defects in the MoS2 nanosheets; further investigation of their interactions is needed. The stability of the MoS2@Au composite suspension enables us to use a very simple spin-coating method to prepare MoS2@Au thin films.
Before the experimental study, we performed FDTD simulations to investigate the LSPR effect of our MoS2@Au HTL and compare it to conventional PEDOT:PSS-doping methods (where Au NPs are embedded within the PEDOT:PSS layer) in a conventional OSC device. The effectiveness of LSPR is strongly dependent on the size of the NPs and the dielectric properties of their surrounding environments. To be consistent with the size of the Au NPs used in the present experimental study, we simulated 20 nm sized Au NPs. The calculated extinction (extinction = absorption + scattering) of the 20 nm sized Au NPs in aqueous solution is 523 nm, which is identical to the plasmon resonance peak of the experimental results (Fig. 2a and b). However, because of their relatively small size, the plasmonic scattering peak for the 20 nm Au NPs is negligible (Fig. 2b). Thus, the increase in the absorption cross-section of the photoactive materials with such NPs is mainly attributed to the plasmonic near-field enhancement. This preliminary calculation suggests that strategies for harnessing light using small-sized Au NPs should be developed with the focus on utilizing plasmonic near-field enhancement. Thus, for the conventional plasmonic device configuration with 20 nm Au NPs integrated in the PEDOT:PSS HTL layer, it is reasonable that only a little photoactive material could be affected by the near-field enhancement because almost all of the NPs are wrapped in the 40–50 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 2c). In contrast, our MoS2@Au composite could possibly maximize the near-field enhancement effect because the Au NPs on the ultrathin MoS2 layer extend upwards into the BHJ layer, allowing much more photoactive material to surround the metal surface (Fig. 2d). To confirm this, we investigated the near-field effect as a function of the media surrounding the Au NPs and the near-field effect distribution directions.
The plasmonic behaviours of the gold nanostructures are strongly dependent on their surrounding media. To show the near-field effect of the Au NPs in different environments, the extinction spectrum and near-field distribution of a 20 nm Au NP were simulated using the FDTD method. The simulated extinction cross-section spectra of a 20 nm Au NP in different environments (water, PEDOT:PSS, or PTB7/PC71BM blend) are shown in Fig. 3a. The resonance position of the 20 nm Au NPs dispersed in either PEDOT:PSS or PTB7/PC71BM blend was red-shifted compared to that in water (λres = 523 nm), which is ascribed to their different dielectric constants. Notably, compared to the relatively small shift in PEDOT:PSS (λres = 542 nm), the resonance position reached 750 nm with an increased extinction cross-section in the whole 500–800 nm range when doping the Au NPs in the PTB7/PC71BM blend. The large wavelength shift led to a significantly more matched spectral overlap between the resonance wavelength and the absorption of the photoactive material (PTB7, with absorption range of 500–750 nm), suggesting an advantage if the 20 nm Au NPs can be incorporated in the active layer. The near-field distributions of a 20 nm Au NP in different environments at the corresponding resonance wavelengths (water, λres = 523 nm; PEDOT:PSS, λres = 542 nm; PTB7/PC71BM blend, λres = 750 nm) are shown in Fig. 3b–d. The incident light was concentrated around the Au NP surface because of the plasmonic effect. The 20 nm Au NP in the PTB7/PC71BM blend had a very similar enhanced light intensity to that of the NP in PEDOT:PSS (the simulated electric field |E|2 = 94.6 and 95.8, respectively); these values represent an enhancement of nearly 100-fold compared with the incident light and more than four times compared to that in water (|E|2 = 22.9). Such a high intensity near-field could effectively enhance the absorption of the surrounding photoactive materials.
To further evaluate the near-field distribution at different directions, electric field components along the horizontal (Ex and Ey) and vertical (Ez) direction around an Au NP were simulated and compared with the simulated incident light electric field (Fig. 4), where x represents the polarization direction and z represents the polymer growth and light incident directions. For the first time, it was found that the enhanced electric field for 20 nm Au NPs is mainly distributed within the horizontal direction, whereas the enhancement in the light incident direction is negligible (Fig. 4a–i). This phenomenon is of importance for designing near-field enhancement strategies; enhancing the in-plane harvest of light with optimized Au NPs coverage on MoS2 surfaces is discussed below. For the small sized 20 nm NPs, although the photoactive materials could fall partly in the near-field region (10–20 nm from the metal surface) of the Au NPs embedded into the PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 2c), the near-field enhancement in the horizontal direction could not be efficiently coupled with the photoactive layer because of the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer. In contrast, our MoS2@Au composite HTL should sufficiently utilize the near-field enhancement produced by the Au NPs upwards into BHJ layer, especially in the horizontal direction because of the ultrathin MoS2 layer (Fig. 2d). In addition, it was demonstrated that the BHJ layer incorporated by Au NPs on MoS2 will not significantly disturb the film morphology and phase distribution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of BHJ layers on MoS2 HTL and MoS2@Au HTL are shown in Fig. 2e–f and S4. Their similar roughnesses reveal that the morphology and phase distribution of the BHJ layer was not significantly altered.
For a direct comparison, the calculated plasmonic resonance positions, light electric field intensities, and electric field components along the different directions of 20 nm Au NPs in different surrounding media are plotted in Fig. 4j and k. Our simulation results suggest the following advantages of utilizing the plasmonic effects of the MoS2@Au composite as the HTLs in OSCs. Firstly, the device architecture with the MoS2@Au composite HTL could provide the optimal configuration to couple the near-field enhancement to the surrounding photoactive material. The BHJ layer incorporated by plasmonic NPs could be realized without disturbing the film morphology and phase distribution by simply manipulating the interfacial materials. Secondly, the long range red-shifted resonance position (Fig. 4j) is localized in the absorption range of PTB7, maximizing the near-field enhanced absorption of photoactive materials. Thirdly, the enhanced near-field along the horizontal direction could be sufficiently coupled into the active layer.
We fabricated plasmonic OSC devices with MoS2@Au composites such as the HTLs (Fig. 5a) to verify our hypotheses based on the previous simulations. The HTL was formed by sandwiching an ultrathin layer of MoS2 or MoS2@Au composite film between the indium tin oxide (ITO) and the PTB7/PC71BM active layer. A layer of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was deposited on the active layer as an electron transport layer to extract electrons from the Al cathode. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PTB7/PC71BM BHJ films before and after the incorporation of the MoS2 HTL with Au NPs are presented in Fig. 5b. The absorption enhancement after the incorporation of Au NPs onto MoS2 sheets is also shown. From Fig. 5b, we found that the light absorption in the 500–800 nm region of the BHJ film (PTB7/PC71BM blend) was enhanced; the largest enhancement (740 nm) was observed for the use of MoS2@Au as the HTL compared to the HTL composed of MoS2 alone. This enhancement location matches well with the plasmon resonance peak (750 nm) of 20 nm Au NPs in PTB7/PC71BM blend simulated by the FDTD method (Fig. 3a). The results are also in good agreement with the simulation of the environment-dependent resonance wavelength shift, and the LSPR effect derived from the MoS2@Au composite did indeed enhance the light absorption of the BHJ layer in OSCs based on the PTB7/PC71BM blend.
The performances of OSCs with our MoS2@Au composite HTLs containing different coverages of Au NPs were investigated. Under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G), the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices using an HTL consisting of MoS2 alone and the MoS2@Au composite HTL are shown in Fig. 5c; their performances are summarized in Table 1. The reference device with the MoS2 HTL has a PCE of 6.18% with an open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of 0.73 V, 13.36 mA cm−2, and 0.634, respectively. By decorating the MoS2 layer with Au NPs, we obtained a maximum Jsc of 15.44 mA cm−2 using a mixing ratio of 12.5 vol%. A higher mixing ratio of Au NPs could sacrifice the near-field plasmonic effect by inducing more recombination centres to depress the carrier collection, resulting in the decreased Jsc. As a result, we obtained a PCE of 7.25% for the OSCs with MoS2@Au HTLs using the optimized decoration coverage; this corresponds to a 17.3% enhancement compared to the reference device. The unchanged Voc and FF indicate that the introduction of Au NPs into the HTL did not alter its interfacial properties, and it remained in ohmic contact with the electrode. Thus, the enhanced PCE is mainly because of the increased Jsc.

To investigate the origins of the increase in photocurrent, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured (Fig. 5d). Compared to the reference device, the EQE of the device with the MoS2@Au composite HTL was enhanced, primarily in the region between 500 and 800 nm. This result is consistent with the observed enhanced light absorption (Fig. 5b), verifying that the enhanced absorption is the main reason for the increases in EQE and PCE. Slight enhancements in the 350–450 nm region are observed in both the absorption and EQE spectra (Fig. 5b and d), illustrating that the improved EQE in this region also stems from the absorption enhancement. Although no obvious peaks are observed in the 350–450 nm region of the Au NP extinction spectrum, certain non-zero values were observed. Thus, the slightly enhanced absorption in this region might still result from the plasmonic effects of the Au NPs. Note that the absorption spectra were measured from the structure without the rear electrode of the OSCs, therefore, the 17.3% PCE enhancement originated primarily from the near-field plasmonic effect of the small Au NPs.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that ultrathin 2D MoS2 layers can effectively template plasmonic Au NPs to harvest near-field optical absorption for high performance OSCs. The small Au NPs decorated on 2D MoS2 layers increased the absorption cross-section of the photoactive materials without disturbing the morphological structures of the photoactive layer. Our simulation and experimental results show that the MoS2@Au composite HTL for OSCs can more efficiently utilize the enhanced near-field, particularly along the horizontal direction. Coupled with the hole extraction capacity of the 2D MoS2 layer, the plasmonic OSC device with MoS2@Au HTL containing 12.5 vol% Au decoration density led to a Jsc enhancement of 15.6%; this resulted in a PCE of 7.25%, corresponding to an enhancement of 17.3% compared to the device with an HTL consisting of 2D MoS2 alone. The findings of our study provide new insights into the utilization of the plasmonic near-field enhancement of small-sized Au NPs. They also provide a new strategy for integrating Au NPs into the BHJ layer for OSCs.
