Nest-shaped TiO2 (NS-TiO2) structures were fabricated by an electrospinning technique and used as an effective scattering layer on the top of TiO2 nano-particle electrodes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The NS-TiO2 scattering layer enhanced the photocurrent of DSSCs due to the enhanced light harvesting via the improved light scattering and lower electron transfer resistance. Under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), a high efficiency of 8.02% was achieved for the cell with a NS-TiO2 scattering layer, which was an increase of 7.1% compared to the cell without a scattering layer (7.49%).

With increasing concern over the twin crises of fossil fuel depletion and environmental degradation, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable interest as one of the most promising devices for converting solar energy to electricity at low cost. Until recently, the highest DSSC power conversion efficiency that has been achieved is more than 12%, which is lower than that achieved with bulk silicon solar cells. To develop highly efficient DSSCs, plenty of research has been carried out to improve the performance of DSSCs by various methods. One effective method to increase the light harvesting capability is introducing optical scatters into the photoanode. However, traditional scattering layers, typically made of large spherical TiO2 particles, will unavoidably decrease the total surface area of the electrodes which in turn will decrease the dye loading. Recently, Ho et al. synthesized a mesoporous TiO2 film with higher surface area and dye loading by incorporating P25 nanoparticles into the mesoporous TiO2 matrix as an anode for DSSCs to improve the conversion efficiency. Despite the progress to date, further exploration of the design of the optical scattering structures to improve both the light scattering and the dye loading is still necessary.

The electrospinning technique is a well-established, simple, versatile, cost-effective and scalable means to produce different structured materials. Recently, some studies reported that TiO2 with various morphologies was fabricated by electrospinning and applied in sensitized solar cells. Joshi et al. reported that a composite made of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers and conventional TiO2 nanoparticles was used as an electrode for DSSCs to improve the conversion efficiency. Zhu et al. fabricated the rice grain-shaped TiO2 by an electrospinning technique as a scattering layer for DSSCs. It is found that the DSSCs based on the rice grain-shaped TiO2 scattering layer showed a higher efficiency (7.45%) than the one without a scattering layer (6.44%). However, further optimization of TiO2 scattering structures for DSSCs prepared by the electrospinning method should be carried out because their current performance still needs to be improved for practical application.
In this study, we report a novel multifunctional structure layer composed of electrospun nest-shaped TiO2 (NS-TiO2) structures, offering efficient light scattering and dye loading, on the top of a TiO2 (P25) nanoparticle layer for DSSCs. The as-synthesized DSSCs with a NS-TiO2 scattering layer show a conversion efficiency of 8.02% under one sun illumination, which is an increase of 7.1% compared to the cell without a scattering layer (7.49%).
NS-TiO2 was fabricated by using an electrospinning technique. In brief, the precursor solution was composed of 3 g poly(vinylpyrrolidone), 14 g titanium(IV) butoxide, and 12 mL glacial acetic acid (Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd.) in ethanol (48 mL). The solution was then loaded into a syringe connected to a 22 gauge stainless steel needle. The applied voltage was 20 kV, and the distance from the tip of the needle to collector was 10 cm. The flow rate of solution was 1 mL h−1. The samples were then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The transparent layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 (P25, Degussa) was prepared by screen printing of TiO2 paste on the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (resistivity: 14 Ω sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) glass. Subsequently, the scattering layer of as-prepared NS-TiO2 was deposited by screen printing. The as-prepared electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, sintered electrodes were immersed into 0.5 mM N-719 dye solution in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio 1:1) and kept for 24 h at room temperature. The active area of the cell is 0.2 cm2. The dye-treated electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and dried under nitrogen flow, and assembled with as-prepared Pt counter-electrodes using a 25 μm spacer (Surlyn). The redox electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in a solvent mixture of 85% acetonitrile with 15% valeronitrile by volume.

Fig. 1(a) and (c) show field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) images (top views) of P25 and P25/NS-TiO2 electrodes, and (b) and (d) are the corresponding magnified FESEM images, respectively. The P25 electrode is constructed by the random agglomeration of tiny sized TiO2 nanocrystalline particles. Fig. 1(d) shows that the as-prepared TiO2 has nest-shaped structures with a diameter in the range of 200–500 nm. It can be seen that these nest-shaped TiO2 structures are composed of packed TiO2 nano-particles with a cavity at the center of each nest (refer to the white arrows in Fig. 1(d)). From the cross-sectional FESEM image of the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode (as shown in Fig. 1(e)), it can be seen that the bifunctional structure layer consists of a 11 μm thick TiO2 (P25) nano-particle transparent layer and a 2 μm thick NS-TiO2 scattering layer. UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of P25 and P25/NS-TiO2 electrodes were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Hitachi U-3900), as shown in Fig. 1(f). It is observed that the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode has a higher light reflectance than the bare P25 electrode, which confirms that the additional NS-TiO2 layer can improve the light scattering capability, resulting in the improvement of the light harvesting.
We fabricated the cell with a 13 μm thick P25 electrode for comparison to make sure that the total thickness of the anodes in different cells is the same. The following experiments are based on the cell with a P25 (13 μm) electrode and the cell with a P25 (11 μm)/NS-TiO2 (2 μm) electrode.

J–V measurement was performed with a Keithley model 2440 Source Meter and a Newport solar simulator system (equipped with a 1 kW xenon arc lamp, Oriel) at one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs with P25 and P25/NS-TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 2(a). The open circuit potential (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of all the cells are listed in Table 1. The data in Table 1 are mean values calculated from four samples for each group in two batches of experiments. It can be observed that the Jsc and η have significantly increased from 13.41 mA cm−2 and 7.49% for the cell with the P25 electrode to 14.29 mA cm−2 and 8.02% for the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode, respectively. However, the change of Voc and FF is small, which is ascribed to the following reasons: (i) the value of Voc is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of the TiO2 electrode and the redox potentials of I−/I3, and the Fermi level of the TiO2 electrode has been not changed by adding a NS-TiO2 layer and (ii) the FF is mainly dependent on the series resistance (Rs). However, the Rs values of the cells with and without a NS-TiO2 layer are almost the same (10.79 and 10.56 Ω) derived from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra in Fig. 3(a). The J–V curves of the cells with P25 and P25/NS-TiO2 electrodes in dark conditions are shown in Fig. 2(b). The cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode shows a lower dark current density compared with that for the cell with the pure P25 electrode, which indicates that the back electron transfer process is suppressed when using the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode.

Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 800 nm using an Oriel 300 W xenon arc lamp and a lock-in amplifier M 70104 (Oriel) under monochromator illumination. IPCE spectra show that the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode exhibits a maximum IPCE value of 47% at 530 nm, while for the cell with the P25 electrode, the peak reaches 45%, as shown in Fig. 2(c). It should be noticed that a red-shift in the IPCE spectrum for the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode as compared with that for the cell with the pure TiO2 electrode is due to the enhanced light scattering.
The advantages of using an electrospun NS-TiO2 as a scattering layer in DSSCs could be summarized as follows: (i) improved light scattering, which has been confirmed from the enhanced diffuse reflection of the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode; the efficient light scattering layer can localize the incident light within the electrode and enhance the light absorption by increasing the optical path length, which improves the performance of the cell and (ii) lower electron transfer resistance. The EIS measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz, and the applied bias voltage and ac amplitude were set at the open-circuit voltage of the cells and 10 mV between the counter-electrode and the working electrode, respectively. The EIS spectra of the cells with P25 and P25/NS-TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 3(a). The spectra are composed of three semicircles situated in high, intermediate, and low frequency regimes. In general, three semicircles extending from total series resistance (Rs) can be recognized and fitted according to an equivalent circuit model in the inset of Fig. 3(a), where the finite diffusion element is also represented by the shunt resistance and the low frequency constant phase element (CPE). The semicircle in the high frequency region represents the impedance corresponding to charge transfer at the counter-electrode (RCT1), while those in the intermediate frequency and low frequency regions give information on the impedance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface (RCT2) related to the charge transport/recombination and finite diffusion of the electrolyte (RW), respectively. The fitted RCT2 of the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode at intermediate frequency is lower than that of the cell with the P25 electrode, reflecting the acceleration of the electron transfer process in the electrode, which should be ascribed to the improvement in electrolyte permeation. The Bode phase plots of EIS spectra, as shown in Fig. 3(b), display the frequency peaks of the charge transfer process at different interfaces for the two cells. The characteristic low-frequency peak (fmax) of the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode shifts slightly to a lower frequency (15 Hz) compared with the P25 electrode (21 Hz). The peak shift from high frequency to low frequency reveals a more rapid electron transport process. These results indicate that the introduction of the NS-TiO2 scattering layer favors the electron transfer and suppresses electron recombination.
The desorption of dye on the surfaces of different electrodes was carried out by soaking dye-sensitized films in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The concentration of desorbed dye in solution was calculated from UV-Vis absorbance measurements obtained from a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The adsorbed amount of dye in P25 and P25/NS-TiO2 electrodes is almost the same from the absorption spectra of the dye loading in the electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4, which indicates that the amount of dye loading is not improved when using the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode. It also shows the dye loading does not play an obvious role in the improvement of the cell performance in this work.
To further display the advantages of the NS-TiO2 structure as a scattering layer, a cell with a 11 μm thick P25 layer and a 2 μm thick scattering layer consisting of TiO2 particles with a diameter of about 400 nm was fabricated and measured under one sun illumination. Its photovoltaic performance is shown in Table 1. It can be observed that the Jsc and η values for the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode are higher than those for the cell with the P25/TiO2 electrode. The improved performance should be mainly ascribed to the increased dye loading in the NS-TiO2 structure, as shown in Fig. 4.
The stability test of the cell with the P25/NS-TiO2 electrode was carried out at different time intervals. It is found that about 10% degradation of η is observed after 200 h mainly due to the photoanodic corrosion. Further works should be carried out to improve the long-term stability of the DSSCs.
In summary, NS-TiO2 has been employed as a scattering layer for DSSCs. Due to the enhanced light harvesting via the improved light scattering and lower electron transfer resistance, the as-prepared cell with a NS-TiO2 scattering layer shows a marked improvement in conversion efficiency (8.02%) compared with the cell without a scattering layer (7.49%).
