In this work, a new electron-rich building block, o-fluoro-p-alkoxyphenyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit, has been used to construct donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated copolymers with electron-deficient units 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (C8DTBTff) and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(4-hexyl-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (C6DTBTff), named P-o-FBDTP-C8DTBTff (P2) and P-o-FBDTP-C6DTBTff (P3), respectively. The experimental results indicate that the incorporation of fluorine into the ortho-position of the alkoxyphenyl substituted BDT unit can enable its resultant polymer to efficiently tune the energy levels and improve the mobility of the derived bulk heterojunction layer, which results in a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P2 (8.10%). Moreover, replacing the 2-ethylhexyl chains on the DTBTff unit with hexyl chains can improve the planarity of the conjugated backbone of the polymer, which makes the P3/PC71BM blends exhibit higher carrier mobility than P2/PC71BM. Finally, a PCE of 9.02% for the device of P3 is obtained without any additive treatment, which is the highest value achieved for the widely reported D–A polymers with fluorine substituted BDT as the electron-donor unit in single junction polymer solar cells.

Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention in the past decade, owing to their flexibility, low fabrication cost, and light weight. Recently, PSCs based on conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have made significant progress toward commercialization. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been obtained for single junction PSC devices.

Conjugated polymers with alternating electron-rich units (D) and electron-deficient moieties (A), known as D–A copolymers, are one of the most successful structures to obtain high-performance donor materials in PSCs, since the D-A copolymers can offer the unique feature of tuning the energy levels, band gaps, and mobility through modifying the chemical structures and conformations of D or A moieties. Until now, a large amount of donor materials have been designed and synthesized as new D–A copolymer photovoltaic materials. As the electron-rich moiety, BDT consists of two thiophene moieties fused by a benzene ring, the conformation of which endows it with a rigid and planar conjugated structure. The central benzene core of the BDT unit can be substituted by different groups to tune the properties including the energy level, band gap, and mobility of the polymers. For example, the conjugated substituted groups with the aromatic structure can enhance intermolecular π–π interactions, which can be beneficial for improving the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. Moreover, it has been proven that the introduction of a fluorine atom onto the BDT unit can also efficiently influence the photovoltaic performance of D–A polymers due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the fluorine atom. Furthermore fluorine substitution can also alter the surface energy of the polymer and thus greatly influence the morphology of the active layer through weak bonds such as C–F⋯H and F⋯S interactions.Fig. 1 shows the possible substituted positions on alkoxyl-, thienyl-, and phenyl-substituted BDT units. The performance of the reported polymers with the above fluorinated BDT units is listed in Table 1. Interestingly, the positions where the fluorine atoms are bonded may result in much difference in the performance of the polymers. For example, Yu and coworkers reported that the modification of the thiophene ring (3-b position of BDT units in Fig. 1) by fluorination could have a significant effect on the physical properties of polymers, however, PCEs only reached 3.3% and 2.8% for polymers PTBF2 and PTBF3, respectively, which was ascribed to the poor miscibility of the polymers with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and the lower mobility of the polymers. Hou and coworkers reported the fluorination of the conjugated thienyl-side groups of the BDT unit, and showed a synergistic effect on the molecular energy level modulation of the polymers. When quinoxaline derivatives were employed as the acceptor unit to construct D–A polymers, a high PCE of 8.55% was obtained for polymer PBQ-4, while when thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) was selected, a comparative PCE value of 8.6% was achieved for polymer PBT-3F. Compared to the thienyl-group, the phenyl-group had a better symmetric structure and weaker electron-donating ability. As shown in Fig. 1, there are three reaction sites on the phenyl substituted BDT (BDTP) moiety including para-, meta-, and ortho-positions. While fluorine atoms are introduced to the above positions, the electron density of the polymer backbone will be redistributed due to the strong electron inductive effects of fluorine, which will further affect the energy levels of the conjugated polymers. Recently, our group introduced fluorine at the meta-position of the alkoxyphenyl group substituted BDT unit. The resulting polymer showed a relatively low lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, and the device based on the polymer and PC71BM exhibited good photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 7.02%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.11 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 65.28%. Meanwhile, Zou et al. also compared two polymers containing meta-fluoro-para-alkoxyphenyl- (m-FPO-) and para-fluoro-meta-alkoxyphenyl- (p-FPO-) substituted BDT segments, and showed quite different photovoltaic performance of the two polymers. Most recently, Bo et al. introduced two fluorine atoms on the meta-positions of the BDTP moiety, and reported two polymers with 4-alkyl-3,5-difluorophenyl substituted benzodithiophene as the electron donor moiety and benzothiadiazole or benzooxadiazole as the electron acceptor unit, named PTFBDT-BZS and PTFBDT-BZO, respectively. The photovoltaic devices with PTFBDT-BZS:PC71BM as the active layer showed a PCE of 8.24% without any additive treatment. As shown in Fig. 1, the ortho-position is adjacent to the conjugated backbone, where fluorine can influence the molecular packing and photovoltaic performance of the two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers efficiently, however, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no report on the modification on the ortho-positions of BDTP.

Based on the above considerations, we introduced a fluorine atom to the ortho-position of the BDTP unit and prepared polymer P-o-FBDTP-C8DTBTff (P2) with the well-known electron-withdrawing monomer 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (C8DTBTff).
Meanwhile, PBDTP-DTBTff (P1) without F on the phenyl group was prepared as a reference polymer. The design strategy and structures of polymers are shown in Fig. 2. The inclusion of the F atom on the ortho-position of the alkoxyphenyl substituted BDT unit greatly decreased the HOMO energy level of P2. As a result, the Voc value was increased to 0.94 V for P2. Meanwhile, the inclusion of the F atom in the conjugated side chain of the polymer also increased the mobility and regulated the morphology of the active layer. These synergistic effects increased the PCE of P2-based devices to 8.10% after additive treatment. Furthermore, considering the steric effect of the alkyl chain on the thiophene bridge of the DTBTff unit, we replaced the 2-ethylhexyl chain in P2 with a hexyl chain in the DTBTff moiety, and prepared polymer P3, which showed a more planar backbone than P2. Inspiringly, the mobility of the P3/PC71BM film was 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was about 2.6 times higher than that of the P2/PC71BM film. Finally, the PSC device based on P3 and PC71BM showed the highest PCE of 9.02% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 12.97 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.49% (Table 1).

The synthetic routes to the monomers and the target polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The alkoxyphenyl or o-fluorine alkoxyphenyl substituted groups were bound to BDT via the nucleophilic and reduction reactions to afford compounds 4 and 2, respectively. It should be noted that the hydrogen atom on the meta-position of the o-fluorine alkoxyphenyl substituted group in compound 2 has high reactivity due to the combined ortho directing effects of the adjacent fluoro- and alkoxy-groups. Subsequently, the monomer o-FBDTP was prepared from a brominated BDT derivative (compound 3) by lithiation using butyl lithium and then quenching with trimethyltin chloride with a satisfactory yield, which was obviously different from the BDTP with a one pot reaction. The electron deficient monomers C8DTBTff and C6DTBTff were synthesized through the Stille coupling reaction between 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2-tributylstannyl-4-alkyl-thiophene, followed by the bromination reaction.

Finally, the D–A structured polymers were obtained via Stille cross-coupling polycondensation in the presence of the Pd2(dba)3 catalyst and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine ligand with high yields. All the polymers can be dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Table S1). There was only a small difference in the Mn and PDI values of the three polymers, which indicated that the photovoltaic performance of these polymers was not mainly influenced by the molecular weights. The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1, all the polymers exhibit good thermal stability and the decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss is over 330 °C.

Electronic energy levels of the polymers are crucial for their application in OPVs. To evaluate the molecular energy levels of the three synthesized polymers, their HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were measured by both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) methods. As shown in Fig. S2a, the polymer films exhibited an irreversible oxidative potential. The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated from the onset potentials according to the equation HOMO = −[(Eoxonset − Efoc) + Eref] (eV), where Efoc is the potential of the external standard, the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Foc/Foc+) couple, and Eref is the reference energy level of ferrocene (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). As shown in Table 2, the HOMO energy levels of P1, P2 and P3 calculated in this method were −5.50, −5.63 and −5.56 eV, respectively. It could be seen from the CV results that the HOMO of P2 was lower than that of P1, which was ascribed to the inclusion of fluorine on the ortho-position of the phenyl substituted BDT. Therefore, high Voc for the devices based on P2 and P3 would be expected. As a verification of the CV results, UPS spectra of the three polymers are also provided in Fig. S2. A similar changing trend for the HOMO of the three polymers was observed from the UPS results (Table 2), which indicated that the comparison of HOMO energy levels among the polymers was reliable in this work. To further understand the above experimental results, the calculations of energies and distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of these polymers were performed by density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. The optimized molecular geometries were confirmed to be minimum-energy conformations since there were no imaginary frequencies by vibrational calculation at the same level. In this work, only one repeating unit was chosen, and alkyl chains on the alkoxyphenyl substituted group and DTBTff unit were simplified to the methyl group to reduce the calculation time. The fluorine atom substituted on BDTP was placed adjacent to the hydrogen atom on the backbone of the BDT unit (see conformation 2 in Fig. S3a) to avoid the repulsive force of the hydrogen atom, which would increase the calculated total energy. Fig. S3b shows the molecular geometries and electronic wave function distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of the D–π–A model compounds. For the three polymers, the electronic wave function of the HOMO was distributed entirely over the conjugated molecule, which was beneficial for obtaining higher hole mobility. The electronic wave function of the LUMO was mainly localized on the electron accepting segment. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1, P2, and P3 were quantitatively in agreement with the observed experimental results, which confirmed that fluorine substituted on the ortho-position of the alkoxyphenyl side groups would lower the HOMO energy level efficiently.

The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of three polymers P1, P2, and P3 in chlorobenzene solution and thin films at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra of the three polymers in the chlorobenzene solution under different temperatures are also presented in Fig. S4. The absorption data are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3, these polymers showed quite different absorption bands in chlorobenzene solution with major absorption peaks at 560 nm for P1, 544 nm for P2, and 555 nm for P3, which were assigned to the intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT). Meanwhile, a strong shoulder peak at around 645 nm for P1, and a weak one at around 623 nm for P3 were observed, which indicated the different aggregation abilities of the two polymers in solution. Interestingly, no shoulder peak for P2 in solution was found, which indicated that the aggregation ability of P2 was much weaker than those of P1 and P3. With increasing temperature, the intensities of the shoulder peaks of P1 and P3 declined gradually (Fig. S4a and c), because the aggregates of the polymers were weakened step by step. Finally, the shoulder peaks disappeared and all three polymers exhibited similar absorption profiles (Table 2, and Fig. S4), while the aggregates of the polymers in solutions were all broken at high temperatures. The above results indicated that the different absorption spectra in solution at room temperature were mainly caused by the different aggregation abilities of the three polymers, which originated from the different substituted groups or side chains. Compared to P1, the inclusion of fluorine on the ortho-position of the BDTP moiety could enlarge the dihedral angle θ1 (Table S2) between the conjugated side chains and backbone of the polymer. Furthermore, the electron density of the conjugated backbone was reduced because of the electron-withdrawing ability of the fluorine on the ortho-position, which could further weaken the π-orbital overlap between BDT and adjacent thiophene rings in the DTBTff moiety, and thus enlarge the dihedral angle θ3. Therefore, the inclusion of fluorine on the ortho-position of BDTP can significantly tune the conformation and aggregation of P2. On the other hand, the dihedral angle θ3 in P3 was very small, probably due to the smaller steric hindrance of the linear hexyl in P3 than the branched 2-ethyl-hexyl side chain in P2, indicating that the aggregation and planarity of P3 could be strengthened to some extent compared to P2. As discussed above, the incorporation of fluorine into the ortho position of the alkoxyphenyl substituted BDT unit will weaken the aggregation of its resultant polymer (from P1 to P2), and the substitution of 2-ethyl-hexyl side chains with the hexyl group on the thiophene bridge will strengthen the aggregation of the relevant polymer (from P2 to P3). It is clear that the above two effects on the aggregation is opposite. In our designed polymer system, the effect of the former (introducing fluorine) is more effective than that of the later one (changing the alkyl side chains). As a result, P3 is more aggregated than P2.
In the solid state, the main absorption profiles become broader, and the maximum absorption peaks moved toward a longer wavelength of 603 nm for P1, 589 nm for P2, and 586 nm for P3. These large red-shifts against the absorption in solution meant stronger interchain π–π stacking in the solid state. The optical band gaps were estimated to be 1.75, 1.82, and 1.81 eV for P1, P2, and P3, respectively, from the onsets of the UV-vis absorption in the thin solid films.

The photovoltaic properties of polymers were investigated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm−2. The device fabrication conditions, such as the weight ratio of the polymer to PC71BM and the amount of the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, were carefully optimized. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table 3, the optimal D/A ratios for P1, P2 and P3 were all 1:1.5. The device of P1:PC71BM at a 1:1.5 weight ratio showed a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 11.27 mA cm−2, a FF of 46.96%, and correspondingly a PCE of 4.67% (Table S3). At the same ratio, a Voc of 1.03 V was obtained for P2, which was 0.15 V higher than that of P1. Obviously, the higher Voc of the P2 based device resulted from the deeper HOMO energy level of P2. Then, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as the additive to further optimize the morphology of the above polymer/PC71BM blends with a volume fraction of 1, 2, and 3%. Unfortunately, only a small improvement in P1-device performance was observed. The optimized amount of DIO was 2% and the device showed a PCE of 4.91% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 11.81 mA cm−2, and a FF of 49.43%. However, DIO has a significant effect on the P2/PC71BM blend. When 2% DIO was added, a Jsc of 12.48 mA cm−2 was obtained, and the FF improved to 69.03%, and a higher PCE of 8.10% was realized (Table 3). It should be noted that a Voc of 0.94 V for the optimized P2/PC71BM device was one of the highest values derived from the polymers with the PBDT-DTBTff backbone. Excitingly, without any processing additives or post-treatments, the devices based on P3 exhibited a maximum PCE of 9.02%, with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 12.97 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.49%, which were the first reported single junction devices with PCE over 9% based on the BDT-DTBTff structure, meanwhile, it was also the highest one for the D–A polymers with fluorine substituted BDT as the electron-donor unit in single junction polymer solar cells. The performance of P3 based devices showed no improvement when treated with DIO (Table S3).

The EQE spectra of P3 gave the photo-to-current response in the wavelength range from 330–700 nm with maximum 79% at 515 nm, as shown in Fig. 4b, illustrating the high Jsc of the P3-device obtained. The substantial EQE together with a high fill factor of 74.49% for the P3 device probably reflected higher hole mobility and a more preferable morphology of the active-layer for the P3-device compared to those of P1 and P2. The Jsc values (11.35 mA cm−2 for P1, 12.02 mA cm−2 for P2 and 12.37 mA cm−2 for P3) integrated from the EQE spectra were consistent with the Jsc recorded from the J–V measurements.

The morphologies of the blend films of polymers and PC71BM have been examined by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All the blend films were prepared under the same conditions with the optimized photovoltaic devices. As shown in Fig. 5a, the blend film of P1 and PC71BM showed a surface root mean square (RMS) roughness of 4.03 nm. While the blend film was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution containing 2.0% DIO as the additive, the RMS data increased to 9.78 nm (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, its TEM image showed large polymer and PC71BM aggregation domains (Fig. 6b), which indicated poor phase separation in the blend film. This might be one of the reasons for the much lower FF (49.43%) for the P1 based device. Compared to P1, the only difference in the chemical structure of P2 is the introduction of the fluorine on the ortho-position of BDTP. However, a quite different morphology was observed for the blend film of P2 and PC71BM. A very smooth surface with a small RMS roughness of 1.24 nm was found. The TEM image of the blend film also showed a well-ordered separation network distribution between the polymer and acceptor (Fig. 6c). While the blend films were spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution containing 2.0% DIO as the additive, the RMS data were increased to 5.13 nm. The morphological change of the active layer after treating with DIO, which would result in different contact situations between the donor and acceptor domains, might be one of the possible reasons for the decrease of Voc value for the P2-based devices with DIO additive treatment. As shown in Fig. 6d, a fibrillar-like bicontinuous interpenetrating network was observed. This might explain the higher FF of 69.03% for the P2 based devices. These results indicated that the inclusion of fluorine on the ortho-position of the BDTP segment in P2 could efficiently tune the aggregation of the polymer and improve the miscibility of the polymer with PC71BM in the blend films. Polymers P2 and P3 shared the same conjugating backbone, the only difference was the nonchromophoric alkyl chains in the thiophene bridge in the BDT-DTBTff backbone. However, the influence of the DIO on the morphology of the blend film was quite different. Without treatment by DIO, the neat blend film of P3 with PC71BM showed a uniform interpreting structure with RMS data of 3.84 nm (Fig. 5e and 6e), while 2% DIO was added, large P3 and PC71BM domains appeared and the RMS data of the film increased to 7.76 nm, which might account for the decline of the FF to 57.61%. The above results indicated that the morphology of the active layer could be optimized by precise modification of the chemical structure of the polymer. In our work, P1 had the strongest self-aggregation ability, which resulted in the large phase separation of the P1/PC71BM blend film. It was also consistent with its optical properties. After the introduction of fluorine on the ortho-position of the BDTP segment, the aggregation ability of P2 was weakened drastically, which made it form a preferable blend film with PC71BM after DIO treatment. To further decrease the steric hindrance and improve the planarity, the branched 2-ethylhexyl group was replaced with a linear hexyl group in P3. As a result, the blend film of P3 and PC71BM showed a well ordered nanoscale phase separation without DIO treatment. It can be seen from our results that the morphology of the active layer can be optimized by the following two methods. One is by using a post-treatment technique such as adding an additive, which can tune the morphology and phase separation of the active layer in the process of film formation. In this work, the performance of P2 is optimized through this way. The other pathway is to optimize the chemical structures of the polymers, which can affect the conformation and aggregation of the polymers. In this work, the molecular structure of P3 with a suitable side chain can make the active layer exhibit a preferable morphology, and finally show champion performance without an additive.


To further analyze and understand the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, the hole mobility was measured using a vertical diode with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S6. By taking current–voltage in the range of 0–4 V and fitting the results to a space charge limited current (SCLC) model, where the SCLC is described by JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εrμh((V2)/(L3)), where J stands for the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential in the device and L is the thickness of the active layer, the hole mobilities for P1, P2, and P3 are calculated to be 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Among the three polymers, P3 exhibits the highest hole mobility, which is 2.6 times and 8.8 times higher than those of P2 and P1, respectively. The higher mobility contributes to obtaining high Jsc and FF of the P3 based devices.

The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) method was used to further characterize the crystalline structure of the active layer of the PSCs. In our experiment, all the blend films were prepared on silicon substrates following the same fabrication conditions used for the optimized photovoltaic devices. As shown in Fig. 7a and 8, the (100) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane pattern at qz = 2.34 nm−1 was observed for the blend film of P1 and PC71BM with 2% DIO treatment, indicating an edge-on alignment of P1 with a lamellar distance of 2.69 nm. In addition, a weak (010) peak (qz = 17.5 nm−1, d-spacing = 0.36 nm) also appeared in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that some face-on crystallites existed. Although a crystalline structure was found in the active layer of optimized P1-devices, the excessively strong self-aggregating ability of P1 and large phase separation in the blend film might hinder the formation of interpenetrating bicontinuous networks of P1 and PC71BM, which would increase geminate recombination at the interface of the donor and acceptor domains, and result in poor mobility and device performance of P1 based devices. As for the blend films containing P2 or P3, polymer crystallinity was observed to be relatively low due to the much lower (100) peak intensity and the absolutely absence of any other higher order reflections. Nevertheless, the P3/PC71BM blend film showed a broad (100) peak in the in-plane direction, indicating the existence of some crystalline structure in the face-on pattern, which may be one of the possible reasons for the higher device performance of P3 than that of P2.

In conclusion, a fluorine atom was first introduced to the ortho-position of the alkoxyphenyl group on BDT units. Subsequently, three polymers, named PBDTP-DTBTff (P1), P-o-FBDTP-C8DTBTff (P2) and P-o-FBDTP-C6DTBTff (P3), were constructed. The optical properties, molecular energy levels, hole mobility, morphology and crystalline structures of the three polymers showed significant differences, which resulted in obviously different device performances. Finally, the optimized device of P3 demonstrated a PCE of 9.02% without any additive treatment, which was 11.4% and 83.7% higher than those of P2 and P1, respectively. Note that a PCE of 9.02% is the highest value for the reported D–A polymers with BDT-DTBTff as the backbone in single junction polymer solar cells. Our work indicates that a BDT unit with fluorine on the ortho-position of alkoxyphenyl side chains is a promising electron-donor building block for highly efficient light-harvesting polymers, and there is still room for further improvement of the device performance through rationally selecting the electron-acceptor segment and alkyl side chains on D–A conjugated polymers.
