Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) can efficiently convert solar energy into electricity, which is considered a promising approach to reduce the dependence on fossil resources. However, the development of counter electrodes (CEs) has been limited. Hence, the search for efficient earth-abundant CE materials is highly desired. Herein, an improved simple synthesis method is reported for the deep optimization of electrode activity by coupling the N-defect carbon with the NiO/Fe2O3 heterojunction (denoted as NiO/Fe2O3@NC). The carbon layers with large specific surface area and high conductivity as bridging transporters not only can maintain structural stability but full exposure to active sites. Moreover, the synergetic effect of NiO and Fe2O3 can promote I3− reduction reaction and suppress iodide ion coupling simultaneously. The obtained NiO/Fe2O3@NC serves as CEs. Compared with the unsupported NiO@NC, the Fe2O3@NC composites displayed superior electrochemical properties. Meanwhile, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSC with NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE attained 8.69%, exceeding that with NiO@NC (6.51%), Fe2O3@NC (6.22%), and commercial Pt CEs (7.52%). This study would contribute to the construction and development of excellent electrocatalysts for other important reactions.

High-efficiency solar energy conversion into more useful power reduces the use of fossil fuels and release of toxic substances, enhancing the quality of human existence. An excellent photoelectric conversion tool for producing clean energy is dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In addition, it has received considerable attention owing to its straightforward design and affordable price. In general, photoanode, counter electrode (CE), and electrolyte are the three main components in DSSCs, of which CE is mainly used to collect and transfer external circuits, thus catalyzing the reduction of I3− on the interface between CE and electrolyte. Commercially, Pt is generally considered the benchmark for CE, but the high cost and lack of availability restrict its wide usage. Therefore, the development of non-noble CE material for DSSCs is greatly attractive but remains a great challenge.

Numerous advanced synthetic materials, including transition metal phosphides, transition metal sulfides, and transition metal oxides, have been examined in the field of energy conversion and storage. Among these materials, iron oxides have the advantages of being innocuous, affordable, and resource-rich, which has attracted significant attention. However, iron oxides have lower electrical conductivity, poor ion transport kinetics, and are easy to agglomerate during synthesis. Numerous initiatives have been made to improve the electrochemical properties of Fe2O3. For example, Fe2O3 is constructed into different morphologies, such as nanospheres, nanoflowers, nanosheets, and nanotubes.
This is mainly to improve the catalytic performance by changing the contact area with the electrolyte. Furthermore, Fe2O3 supported on carbon materials can also be applied to enhance the electrochemical performance of electrodes. For instance, Sun et al. reported α-Fe2O3 solid nanoparticles that were uniformly distributed on the RGO surface. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.12% was attained by DSSC using α-Fe2O3/RGO CE, which was 88% higher than Pt CE. Moreover, it is much greater than that of pure α-Fe2O3 and pure RGO CEs. In light of this, interactions between metallic oxide and RGO originating due to the synergistic effect are a very effective way to enhance catalytic activity. However, the value of PCE is still not ideal. Assembling the heterostructure material is another approach to increase the activity of electrodes because they often have better physical and chemical properties than their single counterparts. Because of their increased edge exposure, heterojunctions should have a lot of catalytically active sites available. Relevant research shows that NiO has low cost and no pollution, and has superior performance in HER and supercapacitors, which has attracted close attention from the scientific research community and industry. Meanwhile, carbon materials have attracted extensive attention in energy conversion applications due to their high conductivity, robust chemical stability, and easily tunable surface properties. However, the performance of the CE in DSSC needs to be also further improved. Combined with the above analysis, we assumed that the nano heterojunction based on Fe2O3 and NiO, combined with carbon materials should have better catalytic performance.
Here, we report a facial one-pot synthetic process to obtain NiO/Fe2O3 heterostructure dispersed in the nitrogen-doped carbon layer. The huge specific surface area (192.36 m2 g−1) produced by this particular carbon-layered structure when combined with NiO/Fe2O3 nanoparticles is advantageous for the electrolyte's contact area. Moreover, the limiting of carbon materials can also effectively prevent the agglomeration of NiO/Fe2O3 particles, which is conducive to the increase of active sites and the full accessibility to electrolytes for accelerating redox reactions, thus improving ion transport efficiency. The electrochemical test showed that NiO/Fe2O3@NC possesses excellent conductivity and I3− reducing activity, which is far better than Fe2O3@NC and NiO@NC. Additionally, according to the current–voltage characteristic curves, the DSSC with NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE outperformed NiO@NC (6.51%) and Fe2O3@NC (6.22%), achieving the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.69%. This work provides insight into the synergistic effect of heterojunction-carbon materials of CE and facilitates the rational construction of high-performance CE for DSSC.

Fe2O3@NC was prepared by the following process. Briefly, 0.2 mmol of Fe(C5H7O2)3 was dissolved in a uniformly mixed solution (45 ml of deionized and 15 ml of ethyl alcohol) and sonicated by probe sonication for 10 min. The obtained suspension solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min. Then, 6.7 mmol of glucose and 2 mmol of urea were added, followed by an intense agitation for 30 min. Afterward, this suspension solution was dried at 70 °C. The obtained solid powders were annealed in argon at 600 °C for 2 h and cooled to room temperature to obtain the Fe2O3@NC composite material.

The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is the base material of the counter electrode in DSSC. In the beginning, FTO transparent glass substrates (NSG, 13 Ω sq−1) were placed into alcohol and ultrasonically cleaned and then placed in alcohol. The as-prepared sample (0.04 g) and polyethylene glycol powder (0.01 g) were added to 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol and then the colloid was formed by grinding. FTO glass substrates were used as CEs by scalpel hanging film with subsequent natural drying. Subsequently, the obtained samples were annealed at 400 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 80 min. CEs were obtained after natural cooling to room temperature.


DSSC was constructed using the as-prepared CE, dye-sensitized photoanode TiO2, and electrolyte. The surface of TiO2 was 0.4 × 0.4 cm (Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd) was dipped into N719 (Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd) dye solution at room temperature for 24 h, then washed with ethanol and dried at room temperature. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.12 M I2, 1.0 M 1, 2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazole iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile solution. The two electrodes were clamped together with solid paraffin as a sealant to prevent electrolyte leakage. The actual area of the prepared CE was 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 and the area of the Pt film was 0.4 × 0.4 cm (Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd). For comparison, the production process of each battery was maintained the same.


Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a digital source meter (Keithley 2410) (an illumination of 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were collected using a three-electrode system with the specific electrolyte (10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 100 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile) under the range from −0.4 to 1.1 V at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. Furthermore, the cathode and reference electrodes were Pt thin film and Ag/AgCl with saturated KCl solution, respectively. The working electrode was from the as-prepared materials. The electrochemical tests of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were performed using a symmetrical cell. Tafel polarization measurements were performed at the voltage range −1 to 1 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. EIS was recorded in a frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz and at an alternating current voltage amplitude of 10 mV. Meanwhile, EIS and Tafel measurements were carried out in a dark environment.

The surface morphologies of the cathodes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6701F, JEOL accelerating voltage of 5 kV), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010, operating voltage of 200 kV), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL-2010). All samples were prepared by depositing a drop of diluted suspension in ethanol on a carbon-film-coated copper grid. The crystalline structures of the obtained powders were recorded on a Rigaku/Max-3A X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed using a Smart Lab 9 kW.

The precursors could be converted into NiO/Fe2O3@NC composites in one step through direct pyrolysis, the steps are shown in Scheme 1. The distribution of NiO/Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the morphology of NiO/Fe2O3@NC were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The acquired samples after pyrolysis indicated that the surface of NiO/Fe2O3@NC was accidented and had a layered structure (Fig. 1a (SEM)). Fig. 1b displays the TEM image of NiO/Fe2O3@NC. A mass of NiO/Fe2O3 nanoparticles with a higher density of the uniformly dispersed carbon layers can be clearly observed. From Fig. 1c, it was observed that the diameter of NiO/Fe2O3 was about 12 nm. Moreover, a high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of the as-prepared NiO/Fe2O3@NC (Fig. 1d) displayed tightly held two different interfaces corresponding to NiO and Fe2O3, respectively. The lattice fringe of 0.37 nm is in accordance with the (210) plane of Fe2O3, and the lattice fringe of 0.20 nm is aligned with the (200) plane of NiO. It strongly revealed the formation of high-quality interfacial contact for NiO/Fe2O3@NC heterostructures. In addition, the relevant selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 1e) exhibited scattered dots and several rings that could be matched with diffraction planes of crystalline NiO and Fe2O3. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 1f–k) confirmed that Ni, Fe, C, N, and O elements were uniformly scattered in the entire material. These results indicated that the NiO/Fe2O3 heterostructure nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and anchored into the NC substrate. SEM and TEM images of NiO@NC (Fig. S1a and 1c), and Fe2O3@NC (Fig. S1b and 1d) indicated that the morphology of the NiO/Fe2O3@NC heterojunction is almost identical to that of pure NiO@NC and Fe2O3@NC. Therefore, the influence of morphology can be ignored.

Fig. 2a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesized NiO/Fe2O3@NC, NiO@NC, and Fe2O3@NC. The sample NiO@NC has feature peaks at 2θ = 37.2°, 43.3°, 62.8°, 75.4° and 79.3°corresponding to (101), (012), (110), (113), and (202) crystal planes, respectively, consistent with the planes of NiO (JCPDS No. 44-1159). For Fe2O3@NC, a series of peaks at 30.2°, 35.6°, 43.3°, 53.7°, and 57.3°, which can be ascribed to (220), (311), (400), (422), and (511) planes, respectively, were observed. The peaks well matched with those from JCPDS No. 39-1346. Moreover, the characteristic diffraction peaks of NiO/Fe2O3@NC were composed of two different characteristic peaks, which corresponded to NiO and Fe2O3, suggesting the formation of NiO/Fe2O3 heterostructures. However, the characteristic peak of carbon was not found in the XRD pattern, which can be ascribed to the fact that the metal peak concealed the strength of the carbon peak. The Raman data are also shown in Fig. S2. It is evident that the NiO/Fe2O3@NC peaks contain pure NiO@NC and Fe2O3@NC. The D and G bands are represented as the primary peaks in the Raman spectrum of NiO/Fe2O3@NC and are located at roughly 1320 and 1580 cm−1, respectively. The intensity of the D peak exceeds that of the G peak, and the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) was 1.01, indicating the presence of multiple dense flaws. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Ni 2p for NiO/Fe2O3@NC (Fig. S3a) showed Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 were located at 854.3 and 872.1 eV, respectively. The Ni 2p3/2 peaks of Ni3+ were seen at 856.1 eV and 874.2 eV and those of Ni2+ were located at 854.1 eV and 872.2 eV. The high-resolution spectrum (Fig. S3b) of Fe 2p showed two main peaks at about 711.85 eV and 725.2 eV corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe3+, respectively. As shown in Fig. S3c, the N1s XPS spectrum can be classified into four groups: pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, quaternary N, and oxidized pyridinic N; the primary peaks of these groups were found at energies of 398.8, 399.4, 400.3 eV, and 403.2 eV, respectively, and they indicate N doping in the hollow carbon sphere structure. The high-resolution spectrum of C 1s (Fig. S3d) can be separated into three peaks, corresponding to CC peaks (284.8 eV), C–N (286.1 eV), and CO (290.2 eV). The heteroatom (N) may offer additional flaws to alter the electrical surface structure of carbon and increase the corresponding conductivity.
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was implemented using the three-electrode system with a 25 mV s−1 scan rate to analyses the study of catalytic I3− reduction reaction (IRR). As exhibited in Fig. 3a, it can be evidently seen that each CV curve contained two pairs of redox peaks. They were located at the redox pair of low potential representing eqn (1) and marked as Red1 and Ox1, respectively. Another redox pair (Red2 and Ox2) are located in higher potential, which corresponds to eqn (2).

I3− + 2e− = 3I−

3I2 + 2e− = 2I3−.

Theoretically, the peak current density for Red1/Ox1 and the horizontal voltage difference between Red1 and Ox1 (
Epp) are extremely important parameters to assess the performance of the catalytic I3− activity and reaction kinetics. Usually, the peak current density of Red1/Ox1 can directly reflect the catalytic ability of electrocatalysts. A high value of peak current density indicates the redox reaction ability of iodine ions. It is noteworthy that the NiO/Fe2O3@NC composite exhibits the highest peak current density for Ox1 and Red1 compared to other materials, as illustrated in Fig. 3b and c. Besides, the lower Epp signifies the quicker transfer charge and better reversibility. It is noteworthy that the Epp value (Fig. 3d) of NiO/Fe2O3@NC is the smallest (0.26 V), which is much lower than that of NiO@NC (0.47 V), Fe2O3@NC (0.58 V) and Pt (0.28 V). It indicates that NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE has high electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed using the symmetrical cells to disclose the interfacial charge transport resistance of NiO/Fe2O3@NC, NiO@NC, Fe2O3@NC, and Pt CE. The corresponding EIS curves are revealed in Fig. 4. Remarkably, the EIS curve was made of two semicircles. The left semicircle was located in the high frequencies area and the right semicircle was situated in the low frequencies. Rs is the intercept from the left semicircle and X-axis, which is mainly determined by the resistance of the material itself and the external factors. Since the external factors are the same, the influence can be ignored. Therefore, the value of Rs was primarily decided by the material itself. The Rs values of the obtained CEs are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that the value of NiO/Fe2O3@NC was the smallest compared to that of the other as-prepared CEs. Furthermore, the diameter of the left semicircle is marked as Rct. It is a core parameter to reflect the interface electron transfer ability between CE and electrolyte. Clearly, the Rct value of NiO/Fe2O3@NC is the smallest compared with NiO@NC, Fe2O3@NC, and Pt, suggesting that the electron transfer ability is the strongest and there was high catalytic I3− activity at the CE/electrolyte interface. The Rct values of the related samples are shown in Table 1.

The electrocatalytic performances of NiO/Fe2O3@NC, NiO@NC, Fe2O3@NC, and Pt can be detected by Tafel polarization measurements and these results are shown in Fig. 5. Two important parameters are closely related to catalytic activity, namely, exchange current density (marked as J0) and limiting diffusion current density (marked as Jlim). These parameters are obtained from the cathodic branch of the polarization curves. In theory, the J0 value of the as-prepared samples is inversely proportional to the Rct value. Jlim mainly reflects the diffusion coefficient of the I3−. Usually, the higher values of J0 and Jlim signify better catalytic properties. The achieved parameters are shown in Table 1. Visibly, the J0 and Jlim values of NiO/Fe2O3@NC are the highest compared to NiO@NC, Fe2O3@NC, and Pt CE. CV measurement results combined with EIS and Tafel polarization reflect that NiO/Fe2O3@NC achieves a higher diffusion coefficient of I3− and better electrocatalytic activity.
The photocurrent density-potential (J–V) curves (Fig. 6a) of the constructed DSSCs with the same dye-sensitized photoanode, electrolyte, and different CEs (NiO/Fe2O3@NC, NiO@NC, Fe2O3@NC, and Pt) were studied via the solar simulator (I = 100 mW cm−2 light illumination) at room temperature. The related J–V curve parameters are exhibited in Table 2. The corresponding PCE values are presented in Fig. 6b. Jsc denotes short-circuit current density, FF relates to the fill factor, and Voc represents open-circuit voltage. Notably, compared with other achieved CE [NiO/NC (6.51%), Fe2O3@NC (6.22%), and Pt (7.52%)]; the constructed DSSC with NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE can reach a greater output of PCE (8.69%). Since the same dye-sensitized photoanode and electrolyte are used, the obtained different PCE results only rely on CE to catalytic regeneration of the I3−/I− redox pair. Combining the electrochemical analysis, the enhancements of PCE for DSSCs are summarized as follows. Firstly, the uniform NiO/Fe2O3 heterojunction nanoparticles have synergies between NiO and Fe2O3, which is beneficial for improving the electrocatalytic activity. On the other hand, NiO/Fe2O3 nanoparticles are anchored to the N-doped carbon layer with an excellent network structure, which is conducive to speeding up the electronic transmission.

In summary, we have exploited a facile approach to fabricate a novel NiO/Fe2O3 heterostructure anchored to NC, presenting high electrocatalytic I3− activity for DSSCs. NiO/Fe2O3@NC has a larger specific surface area, which contributes to expose more active sites. The obtained electrochemical results indicated that DSSC with NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE exhibited excellent I3− reduction and exceeded the electrocatalytic activity of Pt, which is mainly due to the synergistic effect between the catalytic performance of NiO and Fe2O3. The PCE of the DSSCs assembled with NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE was 8.69%, up to around 116% of that obtained with Pt CE. Therefore, it has great potential for NiO/Fe2O3@NC CE to replace Pt and has broad application prospects in DSSC.
