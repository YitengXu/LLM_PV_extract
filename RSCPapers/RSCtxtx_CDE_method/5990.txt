Anatase TiO2 nanocrystals enclosed by well-defined {101} and {001} crystal facets were prepared via a facile hydrothermal method using H+ exchanged potassium titanate nanowires (H-KTNWs) as precursors. The size and shape of the nanocrystals could be tuned by simply altering the precursor dosage and the NH4F concentration. The photovoltaic tests show that with decreasing of particles size, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) exhibits lower open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) due to the increased grain boundaries. However, because of the high short circuit current density (Jsc) stemming from the enhanced dye loading capacity, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was promoted. Moreover, the shape effect on the DSSC performance was evaluated by comparing the nanocrystals with similar surface area but different shapes. The cell derived from truncated octahedrons exposing ∼25% {001} facets shows a ∼10% PCE improvement compared with the cell derived from octahedrons exposing ∼94% {101} facets. Based on the optical and recombination dynamic tests, the enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF could be ascribed to the enhancement in light scattering effect and suppressed electron recombination, which may result from the improved connectivity of the adjacent nanoparticles because it is energetically favourable for the truncated octahedrons to be linked together by the high energy {001} facets.

Inorganic single crystals with elaborately engineered size and shape have attracted tremendous research interest because the surface conditions including the bond structure, surface tension and atom arrangement determine the physical and chemical performances of the material. TiO2 represents a versatile wide band gap semiconductor and received intensive research focus in the territories of water splitting, photocatalysis, gas-sensing and energy conversion/storage. Recently, anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exposing particular crystal facets were designed and prepared with different strategies. It was found that the anatase nanocrystals exposing high energy {001} or {100} facets possess improved catalytic, water splitting, lithium storage and solar energy conversion performances compared with the regular octahedrons enclosed by the inert {101} facets.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively studied for the past two decades as a low-cost and high efficient device to harness the green, abundant and renewable solar energy. Anatase TiO2 nanocrystals were considered the best photoanode material for DSSCs because of its suitable energy band structure, pleasant long term stability against photo/chemical corrosion and sophisticated size/shape engineering strategies. As for the nanoporous photoanode film of DSSCs, the particle size of the photoanode materials is of the foremost importance because it determines the dye loading capacity of the film at a given thickness. Although the particles with smaller size could substantially increase the accessible surface area and thus enhance the dye loading capacity, the decreased size would bring forth more undesired grain boundaries. Therefore, the increased trap states at the particle interfaces and the reduced connectivity of the film would prolong the electron residence time in traps and increase the length of electron diffusion, which boosts the recombination opportunities between the injected photoelectrons and the oxidized dye molecules or the electron acceptors in electrolyte. On the other hand, TiO2 nanocrystals with different shapes might also induce variation in the DSSC performances. Yu et al. firstly evaluated the shape effect via comparing the DSSCs derived from nanosheets exposing a high percentage of {001} facets and the regular octahedrons enclosed with {101} facets. They found that the cell derived from highly crystallized anatase nanosheets exhibits much higher Jsc and PCE compared with the cell based on the regular octahedrons. The enhancement is mainly attributed to the promoted electrolyte diffusion rate and the improved crystallinity of the nanosheets. Lu et al. investigated the performance of the cells derived from the anatase nanocrystals exposing different percentages of {001} facets. They found the sample exposing ∼80% of {001} facets possesses the best photovoltage performances, and the improvement was believed to result from the suppressed recombination rate. These works all aimed to evaluate the shape effects of the anatase TiO2 nanocrystals on the PCE of DSSCs. However, the size of the products in these comparisons is not considered and controlled. Therefore, the PCE differences may simply result from the variations of the particle size (specific surface area) and the crystallinity.
Herein, we employed a simple hydrothermal method to prepare anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with different sizes and shapes (octahedrons exposing {101} facets and the truncated octahedrons exposing the {001} facets). Moreover, the nanocrystals were deposited as photoanode films to study their DSSC performances. Particularly, a set of octahedrons and truncated octahedrons with similar size and surface area was deliberately selected for comparison. It was shown that the cell based on truncated octahedrons (with surface area of 43.1 m2 g−1) exposing ∼25% {001} facets demonstrates a PEC of 7.4% which experiences a ∼10% enhancement compared with 6.7% of the cell derived from the octahedrons dominated by the inert {101} facets and with surface area of 43.7 m2 g−1. Based on the optical and electron recombination dynamic investigations, the film composed of truncated octahedrons possesses a better scattering effect in the visible range. Moreover, due to the high surface free energy, the adjacent truncated octahedron are more inclined to fuse together by coupling the high energy {001} facets, which may result in fewer grain boundaries and improved connectivity of the nanoporous film. Therefore, higher Jsc, Voc and FF were demonstrated, which finally leads to the PCE enhancement.

The potassium titanate nanowires (KTNWs) were firstly prepared by hydrothermal reaction of P25 powder (Degussa) in KOH solution. Briefly, 2 g P25 was dispersed in 80 mL of 10 M KOH solution and sealed tightly in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After reacting at 200 °C for 24 h and cooling to room temperature, the white precipitate was separated by centrifugation and subsequently washed with deionized water several times until the pH value of the supernatant was reduced to less than 10. The as-prepared H-KTNWs were ion-exchanged in 0.1 M HNO3 with agitating for several hours and then isolated by centrifugation. This exchange step was repeated several times until the pH value of the supernatant equalled about 7. The obtained H-KTNW were washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol, dried at 60 °C in vacuum and stored for later use.


A certain amount of the H-KTNWs was dispersed in 40 mL deionized water and sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After reacting at 200 °C for 24 h, the white precipitate was separated by centrifugation and subsequently washed with deionized water and ethanol. In order to obtain octahedrons with different size, the H-KTNW dosage was changed to 0.05 g, 0.1 g and 0.2 g. The samples are accordingly denoted as 0.05O, 0.1O and 0.2O, respectively.


0.1 g H-KTNWs was dispersed in 40 mL NH4F aqueous solution and sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave. After reacting at 200 °C for 24 h, the white precipitate was separated by centrifugation and subsequently washed with deionized water and ethanol. In order to control the size of the truncated octahedrons, the NH4F concentration was altered to 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 M. The samples are accordingly denoted as 0.05TO, 0.1TO and 0.2TO, respectively.


The products were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI, S4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542, 40 kV, 100 mA) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micrometrics ASAP 2010).


Hydroxypropyl cellulose (Aldrich) was added to diethylene glycol with a concentration of ∼10 wt% to prepare the paste which was added in the stock wet TiO2 nanocrystalline product (containing ∼15% net TiO2) in a proportion of ∼40% of TiO2 weight. The mixture was vigorously stirred to obtain the slurry. The nanocrystal slurries were spread onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (TEC-8, LOF) with adhesive tape to control the film thickness. After drying in air, the film was heated up to 500 °C at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained for 30 min.


After cooling to 80 °C, the films were sensitized in cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridy1-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) ethanol solution (3 × 10−4 M) for 24 h.

The photoanodes were then sandwiched together with platinized FTO counter electrodes and electrolyte was then injected into the cell from the edges by capillary. The content of the electrolyte is 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.1 M GuNCS and 1 M BMII in a mixture solvent of 85% acetonitrile and 15% valeronitrile.

The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed on a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system using simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement was performed under the open circuit condition and the voltage decay was then measured in function of the time after the illumination was cut off. Incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on Keithley 2000 source meter under the irradiation of 150 W tungsten lamp with 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). The optical diffuse reflection spectra were recorded by a spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-4100). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark on a potentiostat (EG&G, M283) equipped with a frequency response detector (EG&G, FRD100). The spectra were scanned with a bias voltage of −800 mV and in a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 100 MHz. The alternating voltage amplitude was set at 10 mV and the impedance parameters were obtained by fitting the spectra in Zsimpwin software.


One dimensional titanate nanofibers derived from the alkali treatment of TiO2 particles represent a group of promising precursors to prepare high quality TiO2 crystals. By exchanging the alkali ions with protons for H-titanate, followed by hydrothermal transformation, the fibers were destroyed by bond cleavage and TiO2 crystals with high thermal stability and various structures/morphologies were prepared.Fig. 1a and b show that the H-KTNWs are prepared in high yield and possess a one dimensional structure. The wire-like product is several micrometers in length and tens of nanometers in diameter. Moreover, the XRD displayed in Fig. 1c indicates that the as-formed H-KTNWs have similar diffraction peaks to the K2Ti6O13 structure (monoclinic C2/m JCPDS 40-0403, shown as the standard value), suggesting the ion-exchange would not destroy the Ti–O–Ti framework.


Figs. 2a–c show the SEM images of TiO2 nanocrystals prepared in aqueous solution with different precursor dosages. In the pure water system, only octahedrons enclosed by well-defined {101} facets are observed. It is obvious that with decreasing precursor dosage from 0.2 g, 0.1 g to 0.05 g, the average particle size of 0.2O, 0.1O and 0.05O is gradually decreased. In addition, based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements, the surface area of the samples is increased from 38.6, 38.7 to 43.6 m2 g−1, respectively. Fig. 2d–f display the TiO2 truncated octahedrons prepared with 0.1 g precursor dosage and different NH4F concentrations. In the NH4F system, the as-prepared truncated octahedrons all have more uniform size distributions compared with octahedrons. In addition, decreasing the NH4F concentrations from 0.2, 0.1 to 0.05 M, it is interesting to find that the particle size of 0.2TO, 0.1TO and 0.05TO is gradually reduced. The BET measurement indicates the surface areas of the samples increase accordingly from 40.8, 43.1 to 47.9 m2 g−1.
The samples of 0.05O and 0.1TO with similar surface areas but different shapes were further characterized by the TEM and XRD investigations. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the samples. Fig. 3a shows an individual octahedron from 0.05O, the angle between the two crystal planes is ∼43.4° which is in accordance with the angle between the (101) and the (01) facets. Moreover, the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3b displays two sets of lattice fringes and the interplanar spacing could be measured as 0.48 nm and 0.35 nm, which are in accordance with the (001) and (101) facets, respectively. The longitude (001) lattice fringes are evidence that the octahedron grows along the <001> crystallographic orientation. Therefore, we can conclude that the octahedron is enclosed predominately by the thermodynamically stable {101} facets. Moreover, it should be noted that for the octahedrons, the {001} exposing percentage is generally less than 6%, according to the Wulff construction.Fig. 3c depicts an individual truncated octahedron, the angle between the truncated plane and the lateral plane is ∼68.3° which matches well with the angle between the {001} and {101} facets. As for 0.1TO, the HRTEM displayed in Fig. 3d shows the lattice fringe parallel with the truncated plane has an interplanar spacing of 0.48 nm, indicating the truncated planes are the (001) facets. Therefore, the as-prepared truncated octahedrons are enclosed by two {001} facets and eight {101} facets. The inset fast Fourier transfer (FFT) images further confirm the structure of the samples. In order to define the degree of truncation, the edges of the truncated octahedron are labeled as A and B as displayed in the inset of Fig. 3c. The B/A value could be measured as ∼0.68, indicating the exposing percentage of the {001} facets is ∼25%. As displayed in Fig. 4, the crystallinity and purity of the samples were investigated by XRD. All the diffraction peaks of the octahedrons and the truncated octahedrons could be indexed to anatase TiO2, which matches well with the standard value (tetragonal, I41/amd, JCPDS 21-1272). Moreover, the peak intensities indicate that the as-prepared samples have a similar crystal quality. No diffraction peak belonging to impurities is detected, suggesting the high purity of the samples.

Scheme 1 depicts the possible growth process of the two types of nanocrystals. For the octahedrons prepared in pure water, the crystal growth experiences a dissolution and nucleation process, which has been described in detail in a previous report. In this process, the H-KTNWs are gradually dissolved to release the Ti(OH)4 units for the later nucleation and growth of the nanocrystals. Moreover, the nucleation may occur at any time in the dissolving stage, which results in octahedrons with a broad size distribution. On the other hand, in the NH4F system, because of the strong binding capacity of F− ions towards the Ti atom, the NH4F aqueous solution could completely dissolve the precursor in the initial stage by the cleavage of the Ti–O bonds of the precursor and the formation of Ti–F bonds in the solution. When heated at high temperature, homogenous nucleation occurred in the solution, in which the nucleus would form in a short period of time. Therefore, the truncated octahedrons all have narrow size distributions. In addition, it is reasonable to anticipate that under higher NH4F concentration, fewer nuclei could be formed in the initial stage because the Ti species could be sufficiently stabilized. Therefore, with lower nucleus numbers and the same Ti precursor, truncated octahedrons with greater particle size are formed in the reaction. Moreover, considering the Ti–F bonds can significantly reduce the surface free energy of the {001} facets to lower than that of the {101} facets, the F− ions could also function as the capping regent to stabilize the high energy {001} facets and hinder the growth along the <001> direction, which finally shapes the truncated octahedrons.

Considering samples 0.2O and 0.1O have the similar surface areas and morphologies, five samples were deposited as the photoanode films for the DSSCs test and the corresponding cells were labelled as Cell-0.1O, Cell-0.05O, Cell-0.2TO, Cell-0.1TO and Cell-0.05TO. The photoanode film thicknesses were all controlled at ∼11 μm and the active film areas at ∼0.16 cm2. The photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that the smaller particle size would lead to higher surface area and thus higher dye loading capacity, which could directly contribute to the higher harvesting efficiency of the incident light and the higher Jsc. The enhanced Jsc is considered as the primarily cause for the PCE improvement. However, the small particle size would also bring forth more grain boundaries in the nanoporous film, which results in more recombination opportunities and the increased inner series resistance of the cell. Therefore, the Voc and the FF of the cell are decreased with reducing the particle size. In the comparison, the film thickness is relative thin (∼11 μm). Thus, although the Voc and FF are both slightly reduced, the substantially increased Jsc still leads to the improved overall PCE. Typically, when sample 0.05TO with the largest surface area was employed as the photoanode, Cell-0.05TO demonstrates the highest Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2 and PCE of 7.7%. On the contrary, Cell-0.1O with the lowest surface area finally evidences a low Jsc of 7.2 mA cm−2 and PCE of 4.1%.

In order to gain insight into the shape effect between the octahedron and the truncated octahedron on the DSSCs performances, sample 0.05O and 0.1TO with similar surface areas but different shapes were selected for comparison. As displayed in Table 1, Cell-0.05O demonstrates a Jsc of 12.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 792 mV and FF of 66.6%. As a result, the PCE reaches to 6.7%. In contrast, Cell-0.1TO shows a Jsc of 13.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 794 mV and FF of 67.5%. Therefore, the PCE is enhanced to 7.4%, indicating a ∼10% improvement over Cell-0.05O. As displayed in Fig. 6, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were investigated to evaluate the scattering effects of the photoanode films. The reflectance of Film-0.05O derived from the octahedrons experiences a fast decrease in the visible region, which is a typical behavior of the nanocrystal based film. However, the reflectance of Film-0.1TO is slightly improved to alleviate the downward trend, which may be ascribed to the unique structure of the truncated octahedrons. The improved scattering effect of the photoanode film helps to trap the incident light within the photoanode and finally contribute to the Jsc enhancement. Moreover, the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra provide straightforward evidence for the Jsc variations. Fig. 7 shows the IPCE spectra as a function of wavelength for the two cells. Cell-0.1TO shows a higher IPCE value at the whole wavelength range compared with that of Cell-0.05O. Moreover, a clear IPCE peak is observed in Cell-0.1TO at the region of 600–700 nm, which is supposed to result from the enhanced scattering effect of the photoanode.

To further interpret the mechanism of shape effect on the PCE, the electron recombination dynamic was investigated. Fig. 8 shows the open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) tests. The measurements were carried out under open circuit conditions. When the illumination was removed, considering no electron is transported through the external circuit, the photoinduced electrons are all recombine with the electron acceptors in the electrolyte. Therefore, the Voc would follow an exponential decay during the recombination process. The dots shown in Fig. 8a represent the measured Voc data points after the illumination was cut off. After fitting with exponential decay functions, the solid lines indicate that Cell-0.05O has an evidently faster Voc decay, indicating a more rapid recombination compared with that of Cell-0.1TO. Based on previous work, the electron recombination lifetime in function of Voc could be obtained by differentiating the OCVD curves and then taking an inverse, which are displayed in Fig. 8b. Obviously, Cell-0.1TO exhibits higher electron lifetime in the whole voltage range than Cell-0.05O, indicating the nanoporous film composed of truncated octahedrons possess fewer grain boundaries and lower recombination rate.
Moreover, the cells were also characterized by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Fig. 9a depicts the typical Nyquist plots of the EIS, and the inset is the equivalent circuit. Under the dark testing conditions, the electrons transport through the film and react with the I3− in the electrolyte. Meanwhile, I− is simultaneously oxidized to I3− at the counter electrode. The major concern of the current research is the recombination resistance occurring at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface, which could be fitted as Rct2. On the other hand, the Rct1 represents the charge transfer resistance ascribed to the process at the electrolyte–Pt counter electron interface. Based on the inset equivalent circuit and the Zsimpwin software, Cell-0.1TO has a larger Rct2 (111.3 Ω) compared with Cell-0.1TO (93.4 Ω), indicating a slower electron recombination for the former cell. Fig. 9b shows the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra. Moreover, the middle frequency peak of Cell-0.1TO is slightly shifted to the low frequency region, indicating a greater electron lifetime (τnEIS) compared with that of Cell-0.05 O. Based on the equation of τnEIS = 1/ωmax = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the intermediate frequencies peak, Cell-0.1TO has a τnEIS of ∼35 ms, indicating a 75% improvement than that of Cell-0.05O (∼20 ms). As we know, compared with free electrons in the conduction band, it is energetically favorable for the electrons confined in the trap states to recombine with the I3− in the electrolyte. The longer electron lifetime in Cell-0.1TO reflects the lower trap state density in the cell system, indicating fewer grain boundaries and surface defects exist in the truncated octahedron based film framework.
The electron dynamic measurements of OCVD and EIS agree that Cell-0.1TO driving from TiO2 truncated octahedrons shows more effective suppression for the back reaction of the injected electron with the I3− in the electrolyte. As illustrated in the inset of Fig. 9b, considering the F− ions adsorbed on the {001} facets could be removed by heat treatment, it is reasonable to anticipate that adjacent truncated octahedrons are inclined to be linked together by the exposed high energy {001} facets in the calcination process for photoanode fabrication. In contrast, the linkage of octahedrons can only be formed in a manner of eliminating the neighbouring low energy {101} facets, which is less thermodynamically feasible. As a result, compared with the octahedron nanoporous film, the film based on truncated octahedrons is expected to possess better interparticle connectivity and conductivity, which could possibly suppress the recombination and reduce the series resistance of the cell. Therefore, better Jsc, Voc and FF were achieved in Cell-0.1TO compared with Cell-0.05O.

In summary, well-defined anatase TiO2 octahedrons exposing ∼94% {101} facets and the truncated octahedrons exposing ∼25% {001} facets were prepared by hydrothermal treating of the H-KTNW precursor. The size and the overall surface area of the nanocrystals could be tuned by altering the precursor dosage or the NH4F concentration. The DSSCs test shows the PCE is promoted steadily as decreasing of the particle size, which is ascribed to the high Jsc stemming from the enhanced dye loading capacity. Typically, the cell based on the truncated octahedron with the largest surface area demonstrates the highest PCE of 7.7%. Moreover, the shape effects on the DSSCs performance were intensively investigated by comparing two samples possessing similar surface area. Film-0.1TO comprised of truncated octahedrons shows enhanced scattering effect in the visible range compared with Film-0.05O derived from the octahedrons, which leads to a better harness of the incident light. Moreover, the OVCD test shows the Cell-0.1TO exhibits a longer τn than that of Cell-0.05O, which may probably derive from the improve connectivity of the neighboring truncated octahedrons due to the exposed high energy {001} facets. Therefore, the suppressed recombination rate and the reduced series resistance of the cell result in an improved Voc and FF. As a result, Cell-0.1TO demonstrates a PCE of 7.4%, indicating a ∼10% enhancement compared with the octahedron cell (6.7%).
