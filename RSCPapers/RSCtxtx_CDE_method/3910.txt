Two small molecules with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures, i.e. SN(BTTh2)2 and SN(BTAOTh2)2, denoted as J and K, respectively, containing an electron rich planar S,N-heteropentacene as the central core flanked with alkoxy substituted and un-substituted benzothiadiazole (BT) and end capped with hexyl-substituted bi-thiophene units, were designed and synthesized. Optical and electrochemical investigation of these two small molecules reveals that these compounds possess low optical bandgaps and broader absorption profiles to harvest solar photons, as well as suitable electrochemical molecular energy levels for application as donors in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The photovoltaic properties of these two small molecules as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor in solution processed bulk heterojunction cells were investigated. Devices based on cast J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM active layers showed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 1.96% and 1.57%, respectively; these efficiencies improved to 6.02% and 5.06% when the active layers were subjected to two steps annealing (TSA), i.e. combined thermal annealing followed by solvent vapor annealing. The increase in PCE was due to the enhancement of both the short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) due to the enhancement of the light harvesting ability of the active layer, better phase separation between the small molecules and PC71BM, and more balanced charge transport induced by the TSA treatment.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers are the subject of current research in both academia and industry throughout the world due to their potential use for cost effective and flexible solar energy conversion devices. A BHJ active layer consists of a blend of a p-type organic semiconductor (donor) and an n-type organic semiconductor (acceptor), sandwiched between two electrodes. A record power conversion efficiency of over 10% has been reported using soluble π-conjugated low bandgap copolymers as donors in single junction BHJ solar cells with device architecture modification. Although copolymer based solar cells have shown excellent photovoltaic performance, the high degree of complexity of the polymer structures affects the reproducibility of synthesis, the ease of purification, and the optical and electrochemical properties of the final materials. On the other hand, in a recent development, small molecules have emerged as an alternative to copolymers owing to their well-defined chemical structure, reproducibility of synthesis, ease of purification and fine-tunable optical and electrochemical properties. Recently, solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells based on small molecules as donors have shown PCE in the range of 7–10%, which is similar to that of recently reported polymer solar cells. These high performances are the result of inter-disciplinary research efforts in device optimization, control of interfacial morphology using additives, solvent annealing techniques and the synthesis of new donor small molecules.

In general, the donor material used for the BHJ active layer in an organic solar cell should exhibit strong photon absorption in the visible and near infrared region of the solar spectrum, suitable molecular orbitals, i.e. highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, high carrier mobility, excellent film nanoscale morphology and good miscibility with fullerene derivatives. To meet the abovementioned requirements, one approach is to design low bandgap small molecules with donor–acceptor (D–A) structures. Among these, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) oligothiophenes have been used as donor materials for solution processed organic solar cells. It was reported that proper functionalization and substitution of these molecules allows good processability and control of the molecular orbital energy levels, which not only leads to a broad absorption in the solar spectrum but also results in a high open circuit voltage due to deeper HOMO energy levels and excellent stability toward oxidation. Recently, Mishra et al. introduced fused thiophene (S)–pyrrole (N) based S,N-heteroacenes and their acceptor end-capped dicyanovinylene (DCV) derivatives as A–D–A type donor materials and implemented them as donors for vacuum processed BHJSCs with C60 as the acceptor; they achieved promising PCE values, up to 6.5%. Recently, the same group achieved a PCE of 4.9% for solution processed BHJ organic solar cells using similar types of A–D–A small molecules as donors, together with PC61BM as the acceptor. It has previously been reported that rigid multi-fused heteroacene structures have been used as donor blocks in D–A copolymers for efficient BHJ polymer solar cells. Bazan and co-workers implemented a penta-fused silaindacenodithiophene unit in a structurally defined D–A–D–A–D molecule; excellent PCEs of up to 6.4% have been reached in the corresponding solution-processed BHJSCs. Moreover, Steck et al. recently employed acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type low band gap hole transport materials (HTM) comprising S,N-heteropentacene central units for solid-state perovskite-based solar cells.
Because S,N-heteroacenes have the favorable properties of oligothiophenes, such as good donor ability, high charge carrier mobility and the adaptation of alkoxy substituents to adjust the HOMO level, we have designed and synthesized two low bandgap small molecules with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures, SN(BTTh2)2 (J) and SN(BTAOTh2)2 (K), containing an electron rich planar S,N-heteropentacene as the central core, flanked with alkoxy substituted and un-substituted benzothiadiazole (BT); we also investigated the optical and electrochemical properties of these molecules to use them as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for solution processed organic BHJ solar cells. The devices based on cast J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM active layers showed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 1.96% and 1.57%, respectively; these efficiencies improved to 6.02% and 5.06% when the active layers were subjected to two steps annealing (TSA), i.e. combined thermal annealing followed by solvent vapor annealing. We employed separate thermal annealing and solvent vapor annealing steps; however, the PCE was not significantly enhanced.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, TCI and Alfa Aesar. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Elba Instruments CHNS-OEA 1108 analyzer. Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL JMS-SX102A instrument. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out with a BAS 100B apparatus (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.). A three electrode system was used, which consisted of a non-aqueous reference electrode (0.1 M Ag/Ag+ acetonitrile solution; MF-2062, Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.), a platinum working electrode (MF-2013, Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.), and a platinum wire (diam. 1.0 mm, 99.9% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) as the counter electrode. The redox potentials of the dyes were measured in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4NPF6 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (vs. Fc/Fc+ as an external reference).

The small molecule BHJ organic solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO coated glass/PEDOT:PSS/J or K:PC71BM/Al using a conventional solution spin coating method. First, the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned subsequently by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min. A layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated (3500 rpm, ∼40 nm) onto the ITO coated glass substrate and baked at 120 °C for 20 min. The active layer was spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer according to the different weight ratios of J or K and PC71BM in dichlorobenzene (DCB) at 1500 rpm for 25 s. For the two step annealing (TSA) treatment, first, the optimized active blended layer underwent thermal annealing (TA) by placing the active layer on a hot plate at 110 °C for 5 min and then cooling it to room temperature. The active layer was placed in a glass Petri dish containing 200 μL THF for 5 min for subsequent solvent vapor annealing. The thickness of the active layer was about 80 ± 5 nm. Finally, 50 nm aluminum (Al) layer was deposited on top of the active layer under high vacuum using a shadow mask. The effective area of each device was about 20 mm2. Hole-only and electron-only devices with ITO/PEODT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer:PC71BM/Al architectures were also fabricated in an analogous way to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. The current–voltage characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of each device was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and monochromator; the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.


We have synthesized two A–D–A type small molecules, J and K, based on an S,N-heteropentacene donor central core unit and different acceptors according to the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1. These molecules were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as described in the Experimental section.


The optical absorption spectra of J and K in chlorobenzene (CB) and spin cast from the CB solution are shown in Fig. 1, and the data are summarized in Table 1. The small molecules J and K showed strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption bands at 650 nm and 629 nm, respectively, with high molar extinction coefficients (ε) of 84482 M−1 cm−1 and 77765 M−1 cm−1 for J and K, respectively. The red shift of 21 nm and the higher ε for J compared to K can be ascribed to the stronger electron accepting ability of un-substituted BT compared to alkoxy substituted BT. In addition to ICT bands, both J and K showed absorption bands in the short wavelength region, around 400–410 nm; this is ascribed to the characteristic π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone. In comparison to the spectra in solution, the absorption spectra in thin film showed significant broadening, and the absorption maxima assigned to the ICT band was red shifted compared to that measured in solution; this can be attributed to the increased intermolecular interactions of the molecules in the solid state. The vibronic shoulder observed might arise from better molecular packing in the solid state. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) for J and K estimated from the onset absorption spectra in thin film were about 1.52 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively. These values are lower than the Eo–o (Fig. 2b) estimated from the intersections of the absorption and emission spectra of the molecules in solution (1.68 eV and 1.77 eV for J and K, respectively).

We have estimated the HOMO energy levels from the cyclic voltammograms of these small molecules in thin film (Fig. 2a). The electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels were deduced from the oxidation onset with the assumption that the energy level of ferrocene is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. However, the reduction potentials of these molecules were not clearly observed in the cyclic voltammograms. Therefore, we have determined the Eo–o transition energies from the intersections of the absorption and emission spectra of J and K in solution (Fig. 3). The HOMO energy levels of J and K, estimated from the onset oxidation potentials observed in the CVs, were −5.09 eV and −5.12 eV, respectively. A deeper HOMO energy level is beneficial for a high value of Voc when a compound is used as a donor for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The LUMO energy levels were estimated according ELUMO = EHOMO − Eo–o and were about −3.41 eV and −3.35 eV for J and K, respectively. In general, exciton dissociation and efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor molecule requires that the LUMO level of the donor be higher by at least ∼0.3 eV than the LUMO energy level of the acceptor molecule. The LUMO level of PC71BM has values in the range between 3.9 eV and 4.1 eV. In our case, the LUMO–LUMO offsets between J or K and PC71BM were larger than 0.3 eV, expecting that the exciton might easily dissociate at the donor–acceptor interface formed in the BHJ active layer.

Optimized structures were calculated by TD-DFT using the B3LYP functional and the 6-21G* basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies were determined using minimized singlet geometries to approximate the ground state. Isodensity surface plots of J and K calculated by the time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the B3LYP functional/6-31G* basis set are shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO levels of both J and K were predominantly located at S,N-heteropentacene, whereas the LUMO levels of J and K were located at un-substituted and alkoxy substituted benzothiadiazole (BT), respectively. The theoretical values of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are compiled in Table 1 and are consistent with the experimentally observed values.


Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated using J and K as electron donors along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J or K:PC71BM/Al using a conventional spin coating method for BHJ active layer deposition. The concentration ratio of the donor and acceptor in the blended active layer is important for the photovoltaic performance of the device, because there should be a balance between the absorption of the active layer and the charge transport of the carriers towards the electrodes. We used different concentrations in the weight ratio of the donor and acceptor and found that the 1:1 w/w ratio exhibits the best power conversion efficiency. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the organic solar cells with optimized active layers cast from CB are shown in Fig. 4a and 5a for the J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM active layers, respectively; the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 2. The optimized solar cell cast as J:PC71BM blended film showed a PCE of 1.96% with open Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 6.52 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.36. The corresponding solar cell based on K:PC71BM exhibited PCE of 1.57% with Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 5.58 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.32. The similar Voc values of both devices could be attributed to the similar values of the HOMO energy levels of the J and K small molecules. The relatively high value of Jsc for the device based on J may be attributed to the broader absorption profile of the J:PC71BM film (Fig. 6) as compared to K:PC71BM. The low values of Jsc and FF for these devices may be attributed to the un-optimized morphologies of the active layers, which will be discussed later.

To improve the PCE of the devices, first we performed thermal annealing (110 °C for 10 min) of the active layer and found that the devices based on J:PCBM (1:1) and K:PC71BM (1:1) showed PCEs of 2.78% and 2.14%, respectively. We also fabricated devices using a solvent vapor annealing treatment of the active layer; PCEs of 4.14% and 3.77% were achieved for the J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM based devices, respectively. It was reported that a simple two step annealing (TSA) approach that combined thermal annealing and solvent vapor annealing could improve the morphology of the active layer to improve the PCE. Herein, we have also employed same approach for the optimization of the morphology of the active layer in order to improve the PCE. The devices based on J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM with TSA treatment showed PCEs of 6.02% (Jsc = 11.13 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V and FF = 0.66) and 5.06% (Jsc = 9.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.84 V and FF = 0.61), respectively.
The IPCE spectra of the devices based on the J and K small molecules as donors are shown in Fig. 4b and 5b, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b and 5b, the devices fabricated with both J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM blended films (as cast) showed relatively low IPCEs (maximum IPCE values were 38% and 32% for J and K, respectively). After TSA treatment, the IPCEs of the devices based on J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM were significantly improved, with maximum values of 54% and 43%, respectively. Moreover, the IPCE spectra of the TSA treated devices exhibited red shifts in their responses. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra for these devices are also compiled in Table 2 and are consistent with the experimentally observed values. However, a slight decrease in the Voc of the devices based on TSA treated active layers may be due to the increasing intermolecular interaction between the donor and acceptor, as evidenced from the increased values of Rsh compared to the devices based on cast active layers.
As the overall PCE of a solar cell depends upon the light absorption and charge transport properties of the active layer used in the corresponding device, we investigated the changes in these parameters with and without TSA treatment. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the blended films with TSA showed red-shifted absorption as well as higher absorption coefficients, which is consistent with the red-shifts in the IPCE spectra. Moreover, the blended films of either J or K with PC71BM without TSA exhibit blue-shifted absorption peaks, indicating that the mixing of PC71BM disrupts the intermolecular packing of the donor molecules. After the TSA treatment, the absorption peaks in the blended film were red-shifted relative to the cast film and also exhibited increasing shoulder peaks. These results suggest that the molecular ordering is improved for the donor molecules in the corresponding blended films after TSA treatment. In addition, the presence of a strong donor also demonstrates the better ordering of J and K in their respective blends after TSA treatment. The broader absorption profiles and higher absorption coefficients of the TSA treated blended films could increase the exciton generation efficiency, leading to an increase in Jsc and PCE.
To obtain information about the molecular ordering induced by the TSA, the changes in the microstructures of the donors in the blends were investigated by X-ray diffraction. The thin films of both pure J and K showed strong (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.23° and 5.20°, respectively (Fig. 7a), corresponding to the d-spacings of 2.24 nm and 2.15 nm, respectively, between the molecular layers; this indicates that the different acceptor units had a slight effect on the crystal dimensions. The XRD patterns of the as cast and TSA treated J:PC71BM films are shown in Fig. 7b. Similar XRD patterns were also observed in the K:PC71BM films. The cast blended film showed a relatively broad and weak (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.23°, corresponding to the d-spacing of 2.16 nm between the molecular layers of J. However, in the TSA treated film, the (100) diffraction peak increased slightly to 2θ = 5.26° and also became narrower and more intense. The FWHM value was high, indicating an increase in the crystalline nature of the active layer. An increase in the crystalline nature of the active layer also leads to improvement in the molecular packing. Moreover, the shifting of the (100) diffraction peak toward a higher 2θ also indicated denser molecular packing. The overall increase in the order of the molecular packing improved the IPCE values and is likely responsible for the increases in the Jsc and PCE values.
Transmission electron microscopy studies show that the morphologies of the as cast and TSA treated blended thin films are quite different (Fig. 8). Without TSA, both blended films show no indication of phase separation between the donor and acceptor, which is not favorable for efficient charge transport and thus leads to low Jsc and FF values. When the blended films are subjected to TSA treatment, the film exhibits a clear phase separating interpenetrating network with domain sizes of 25–30 nm, which is comparable to the exciton diffusion length. The TSA treatments may redistribute the donor and acceptor phases in the active layers to form optimal phase separation by increasing the molecular ordering and crystallization. The improved phase separation and morphology of the active layers with TSA treatment may increase the exciton dissociation and charge transport and suppress the charge carrier recombination, resulting in increase in the Jsc and FF values.
To determine the effect of TSA treatment on the charge transport of the devices, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to estimate the hole mobility with hole only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J or K:PC71BM/Al). The SCLC can be fitted by the Mott–Gurney expression: J = (9/8)εoεrμ(V2/d3), where J is the dark current density, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, εo is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the thickness of the active layer, and V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage and Vbi is the built-in potential that results from the difference in the work function of the anode and cathode. Fig. 9 shows the J–V characteristics of the hole only devices for the J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM blends with and without TSA treatment. For the devices as cast blended films, the hole mobilities are 5.68 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM, respectively. After TSA treatment, the hole mobilities improved to 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM, respectively. The increase in the hole mobility may be attributed to the increase in the crystallinity of the active layers. The electron mobilities for the as cast J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM devices were about 3.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, the electron mobilities did not change greatly, i.e. 3.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM, respectively, after the TSA treatment. Therefore, the improved and more balanced electron to hole mobilities in the blended films after TSA treatment may promote charge transport and suppress charge recombination, resulting in PCE enhancement.
To obtain further information about the effects of TSA on the charge generation and extraction processes, the variation of photocurrent (Jph) with the internal voltage of the devices was investigated. The photocurrent (Jph) is the difference between the current under illumination (JL) and the dark current (JD), i.e. Jph = JL − JD. Jph can be expressed as Jph = qLGmaxPc, where L is the thickness of the active layer, Gmax is the maximum generation rate for electron–hole pairs and Pc is the charge collection probability. In any solar cell, upon illumination, the photoactive layer absorbs solar photons and generates excitons, which undergo dissociation at D/A interfaces, forming bound e–h pairs. The bound e-h pairs are separated into free charge carriers and then drift toward different electrodes under the drive of the internal field. The internal effective field is defined as Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vappl is the applied voltage. The variation of Jph with internal voltage Veff is shown in Fig. 10. The log–log plot of Jph versus Vint shows two distinct regions: a linear region and a saturation region, where Jph was saturated at Vo − Vappl > 0.52 V for the devices based on TSA treated active layers. The field independent saturation region suggests negligible trapped charges and efficient charge extraction and collection. On the other hand, the devices based on the active layers without TSA treatment showed no clear saturation in Jph with increasing Vint, indicating significant electron–hole recombination, wherein a stronger internal electric field is needed to sweep out the photogenerated charge carriers and separate the germinate electron–hole pairs. This is closely related to the film morphology of the active layers with TSA, which hinders efficient charge transport. In addition, the photogenerated Jph values of the TSA treated devices were higher than those of the devices without TSA, suggesting higher charge generation and charge extraction. The values of Gmax can be calculated by Jphsat = qGmaxL. The increase in the value of Gmax for TSA treated devices suggests that the treatment of TSA amplifies the exciton generation rate, which is a measure of the number of photons absorbed. These results are consistent with the absorption profiles and morphologies of the active layers and the photovoltaic performance of the devices. To obtain information about the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency, the ratios of Jsc/Jphsat were estimated to be 0.59, 0.83, 0.53 and 0.78 for the J:PC71BM (as cast), J:PC71BM (TSA), K:PC71BM (as cast) and K:PC71BM (TSA) active layers. The greater values of this ratio for the devices processed with TSA treatment are attributed to the better phase separation in the active layer, increased hole mobility, improved balanced charge transport and enhancement in the light harvesting ability. All these parameters demonstrate that TSA improves the exciton dissociation efficiency and the charge transport and collection efficiencies while reducing the carrier recombination.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized two new A–D–A small molecules with the same electron rich planar S,N-heteropentacene central core flanked with alkoxy substituted and un-substituted benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor units and end capped with hexyl-substituted bi-thiophene units; we have also investigated their optical and electrochemical properties. The devices based on optimized active layers J:PC71BM and K:PC71BM processed from CB solvent exhibit overall PCEs of 1.96% and 1.57%, respectively. The higher PCE of the former device is attributed to its broader absorption profile and larger hole mobility compared to that of the latter device. The overall PCEs improved to 6.06% and 5.02% for these devices when TSA treatment of the active layers was employed. The enhancement in the PCE has been attributed to the increased values of Jsc and FF. The morphological investigation demonstrated that the higher valves of Jsc and FF were attributed to the suitable phase separations between the donor and acceptor, the increased light harvesting efficiency, the higher exciton dissociation efficiency due to more balanced charge transport, and the reduced charge recombination induced by the TSA treatment of the active layers.
