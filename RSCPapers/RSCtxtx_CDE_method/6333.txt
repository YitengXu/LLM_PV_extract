Low-lying triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) transitions of osmium complexes induced by spin–orbit coupling (SOC) are promising for extending the photocurrent response in dye-sensitized solar cells. In this study, we present a new osmium complex (CYC-33O), incorporating a 2-thiohexyl-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene functionalized bipyridyl ancillary ligand to red-shift the absorption and enhance the absorbance of singlet and triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT and 3MLCT) transitions. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations show that the reinforced 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions of CYC-33O are mainly from osmium to the 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine anchoring ligand, increasing the heterogeneous electron transfer between CYC-33O and TiO2. The device sensitized with CYC-33O exhibits panchromatic conversion beyond 1000 nm, yielding a photocurrent density of 19.38 mA cm−2, which is much higher than those of the cells based on the ruthenium analogue (CYC-33R) and model osmium complex (Os-3) sensitizers.

New materials, device fabrication and performance characterization are crucial to the commercialization of photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Among next-generation photovoltaics, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted great attention and exhibited promising potential for both outdoor and indoor applications. DSCs can be semi-transparent, colorful, and flexible, and have impressive power conversion efficiency, good stability, and low manufacturing costs. In DSCs, photosensitizers self-assembled on the surface of mesoporous metal oxides, such as TiO2 and ZnO, not only serve as the photon-to-electricity conversion centers, but also play vital roles in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and durability of the devices. In contrast to metal-free organic dyes, metalloporphyrins, and Ru sensitizers designed for DSCs, there are few Os sensitizers. The main reasons are the lower abundance of Os in the Earth's crust and poorer device efficiency. Nevertheless, terpyridyl (tpy) Os complexes-sensitized cells have a broad spectral response up to 1100 nm, which is comparable with that of crystalline silicon solar cells and favorable for use in tandem and spectral splitting PV devices. The main feature of the wideband photon-to-current conversion of Os-based dye arises from both singlet (1MLCT) and triplet (3MLCT) metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions. In particular, the 3MLCT transitions of heavy metal complexes can be induced through singlet–triplet spin–orbit coupling (SOC).

For the application of Os complexes in DSCs, a method to increase the absorbance of their 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions simultaneously is important. In this study, two new metal complexes (CYC-33O and CYC-33R) and a model Os dye (Os-3) (Fig. 1) are reported to clarify the effects of the ligand and metal on the MLCT transitions. Our study shows that introducing 2-thiohexyl-3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene (TH-EDOT) to the bipyridyl (bpy) ancillary ligand of a heavier metal, such as Os in CYC-33O, can simultaneously red-shift the absorption and increase the absorbance of 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions, yielding a panchromatic sensitizer for DSCs.

All reagents and solvents for material syntheses and device fabrication were obtained from commercial sources and used as received unless specified. The molecular structures of Os-3, CYC-33O, and CYC-33R were identified from 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and HRFAB-MS. The NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) with a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker). The high resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (HRFAB-MS) spectra were obtained using a HRMS (JMS-700, JEOL). Absorption spectra of the complexes in dimethylformamide (DMF) were measured using a spectrometer (U-4100, Hitachi). Electrochemical properties of the complexes (concentration of 1 mM) in anhydrous DMF were studied in a single-compartment, three-electrode cell. The reference electrode was Ag/Ag+, and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAClO4). The square-wave voltammograms of the complexes were recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT 30, Eco-Chemie, Netherlands). The potential step increment and frequency were 1 mV and 25 Hz, respectively. Ferrocene was used as an external standard for potential calibration (0.63 V vs. NHE).


A solution containing (TBA)2OsCl6 (0.200 g, 0.225 mmol) and 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (H3tctpy) (0.0822 g, 0.225 mmol) in 30 mL of n-butanol was refluxed for 12 h, followed by adding 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dmbpy) (0.0414 g, 0.225 mmol) in n-butanol (5 mL). After further refluxing the mixture for 12 h, and then cooling it to room temperature (RT), 6 wt% HPF6(aq.) was added to obtain a precipitate. The solid was collected, washed sequentially with deionized water and dichloromethane (DCM), and then dried under vacuum. The solid was dissolved in a mixture of 40 wt% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in water (TBAOH(aq.)) (4 eq.) and methanol (MeOH) for purification on a Sephadex LH-20 column, using MeOH as an eluent. The main band was collected and the pH value of the concentrated solution was lowered with 6 wt% HPF6(aq.) to obtain the precipitate. The collected precipitate was successively washed with deionized water, ether, and DCM. After repeating the purification procedures described above three times, Os-3 was obtained as a dark solid (0.0615 g, 29.7% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, δ/ppm in DMSO-d6): 9.70 (d, J = 5.8 Hz, 1H), 9.21 (s, 2H), 9.14 (s, 2H), 8.87 (s, 1H), 8.49 (s, 1H), 7.97 (d, J = 5.8 Hz, 1H), 7.94 (s, 2H), 7.63 (s, 2H), 6.83 (d, J = 5.8 Hz, 1H), 6.73 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 1H), 2.97 (s, 3H), 2.34 (s, 3H).

A mixture of (TBA)2OsCl6 (0.261 g, 0.294 mmol) and 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine-4,4′,4′′-tricarboxylic acid triethyl ester (Et3tctpy) (0.132 g, 0.294 mmol) in 35 mL of n-butanol was refluxed for 8 h. After cooling the solution to RT, deionized water was added to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was collected and successively washed with deionized water and acetone, and then dried under vacuum. The solid and ancillary ligand TH-EDOT-bpy (0.188 g, 0.281 mmol) dissolved in 30 mL of ethylene glycol were stirred at 175 °C for 12 h and then cooled to RT. To obtain a precipitate, 6 wt% HPF6(aq.) was added to the solution. The solid was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried under vacuum. To hydrolyze the solid, NaOH (0.332 g, 8.30 mmol) in 35 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used. The solution was refluxed for 1 h, and then cooled to RT. To precipitate crude product CYC-33O, 6 wt% HPF6(aq.) was added to the solution. The solid was collected, washed sequentially with deionized water and DCM, and dried under vacuum. The purification was conducted three times with a Sephadex LH-20 column using the same procedures mentioned above to afford CYC-33O as a dark solid (0.0922 g, 22.3% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, δ/ppm in DMSO-d6): 9.79 (s, 1H), 9.25 (s, 2H), 9.17 (s, 2H), 8.93 (s, 1H), 8.51 (s, 1H), 8.26 (s, 1H), 7.84 (s, 2H), 7.68 (s, 2H), 6.99 (s, 2H), 4.59–4.32 (m, 8H), 2.92 (s, 2H), 2.77 (s, 2H), 1.40 (m, 16H), 0.86 (m, 6H). MS: m/z 1405.15 ([M]+); HRFAB-MS found: 1260.1826 ([M–PF6]+).


RuCl3 (0.050 g, 0.241 mmol) and H3tctpy (0.0881 g, 0.241 mmol) in n-butanol (30 mL) were refluxed for 6 h, and then TH-EDOT-bpy (0.161 g, 0.241 mmol) in n-butanol (15 mL) was added. The mixture was further refluxed for 6 h, and then cooled to RT. To obtain a precipitate, 6 wt% HPF6(aq.) was added. The precipitate was collected, washed sequentially with deionized water and DCM, and then dried under vacuum. After the same purification methods as described above using a Sephadex LH-20 column, CYC-33R was obtained as a dark solid (0.0831 g, 26.2% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, δ/ppm in DMSO-d6): 9.94 (d, J = 6.1 Hz, 1H), 9.35 (s, 2H), 9.18 (s, 2H), 8.90 (s, 1H), 8.55 (s, 1H), 8.24 (s, 1H), 7.95 (s, 2H), 7.80 (s, 2H), 7.15 (s, 2H), 4.58–4.26 (m, 8H), 2.90 (d, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H), 2.77 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 1.62–1.09 (m, 16H), 0.84 (m, 6H). MS: m/z 1315.09 ([M]+); HRFAB-MS found: 1170.1257 ([M–PF6]+).


The Amsterdam Density Functional program (ADF2017) was used for all calculations. The ground state molecular geometries of the three complexes were optimized in the gas phase using the Becke–Perdew (BP) exchange-correlation functional and the zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA) triple-zeta polarization (TZP) basis set for all atoms (1s cores for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, 1s–2p cores for chlorine and sulfur, 1s–3d cores for Ru, and 1s–4d cores for Os were frozen). The scalar relativistic (SR) effects were included by the ZORA Hamiltonian, as implemented in the ADF2017 package. The hexyl terminals in CYC-33O and CYC-33R were replaced with methyl groups to save computational cost. All the complexes were examined in their tri-deprotonated forms to mimic the deprotonated state of metal complexes in DMF. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations using the Becke-3-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) exchange-correlation functional and the ZORA TZP basis set based on BP geometry were performed to calculate the absorption spectra. The TDDFT calculations considered the SR effects and include SOC. The solvent effects of DMF were considered with the conductor-like screening model (COSMO).


The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (surface resistivity of 7 Ω sq−1) was sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and UV/ozone. After treating the FTO glass with 40 mM TiCl4(aq.) at 70 °C for 35 min, a 16-μm-thick transparent TiO2 layer was printed using the TiO2 paste we reported previously and calcined at 500 °C for 30 min. A 4-μm-thick scattering layer using PST-400C TiO2 paste (JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd., Japan) was then superimposed onto the transparent layer. After post-treating the TiO2 electrode with 40 mM TiCl4(aq.) at 70 °C for 35 min, the electrode was calcined again at 500 °C for 30 min. The electrode was immersed in the dye solution (0.2 mM) containing 10 mM tetrabutylammonium chenodeoxycholic acid salt as a coadsorbent in a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN), DMSO and t-butanol (volume ratio 1:1:1) at RT for 12 h. The cell was sealed with a 25-μm-thick Surlyn spacer at 125 °C for 30 s to the counter electrode (FTO glass chemically coated with platinum). An electrolyte containing 1.3 M LiI, 1.3 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and 25 mM I2 in ACN was injected into the cell through a pre-dilled hole in the counter electrode. The hole was then sealed with a UV-curable epoxy.


A black aluminium mask with an aperture area of 0.12 cm2 was attached to the devices to confine the area of the devices and to reduce the light reflection and diffusion. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were obtained with an IPCE measurement system (EQE-R-3011, Enli Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan) calibrated using a single crystalline silicon photodiode. The direct current mode was used to reduce the measurement time for all the devices. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and PV parameters (short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE) were measured under an illumination of AM 1.5 global simulated sunlight (YSS-50A, Yamashita Denso Corporation, Japan) with a source measure unit (2400, Keithley, USA). The total irradiance of the AAA-class solar simulator was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 with a single crystalline silicon reference cell with calibration traceable to the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. The J–V curves were measured from −0.05 to +0.60 V with a sampling delay time of 1 s (corresponding to a scan rate of 10 mV s−1). The intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were used to study the internal charge dynamics of the devices. The electron transfer time (τtr), recombination lifetime (τrec), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) were calculated with [τtr = (2πfmin (IMPS))−1], [τrec = (2πfmin (IMVS))−1], and [ηcc = 1 − τtr/τrec], respectively, where fmin is the minimum frequency of the IMPS or IMVS response.


Light-harvesting is the main role of the photosensitizers in DSCs. According to the spectral distribution of the AM 1.5 global spectrum standardized for ranking terrestrial PV technologies, the absorption capability of a dye should cover the whole visible region and a portion of the near-infrared (NIR) to achieve high current density. The absorption spectra of the new metal complexes and N749 dissolved in DMF are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption maximum (λmax), molar absorption coefficient (ε), and assignments of the transitions are summarized in Table 1. The model Os complex (Os-3) shows a broad absorption band centered at 703 nm (ε of 3.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1), which is ascribed to the 3MLCT transitions. λmax of the 3MLCT transitions for CYC-33O red-shifts is over 100 nm and the ε value enhancement exceeds 45% compared with those of Os-3. Furthermore, the transition band of CYC-33O centered at 546 nm (ε of 19.6 × 103 M−1 cm−1) is more intense than those of Os-3 (ε of 6.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at 531 nm), the Ru counterpart CYC-33R (ε of 17.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at 545 nm), and N749 (ε of 7.5 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at 599 nm). These results clearly indicate that the Os complex shows excellent visible and NIR photon harvesting, superior to that of the Ru analogue. More importantly, the TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand in CYC-33O has a synergistic effect on red-shifting the absorption, reinforcing the spin-allowed 1MLCT transitions, and enhancing the degree of the SOC (3MLCT). The same large 1MLCT intensity improvement also occurs between CYC-33R and N749, also attributed to the TH-EDOT-bpy conjugated ligand.

The frontier orbital energy level of Os-3, CYC-33O, CYC-33R, and N749 measured with square-wave voltammetry combined with the optical transition energy (E0–0) estimated from the absorption onset are also listed in Table 1. The energy level diagram of the metal complex dyes, the conduction band edge of anatase TiO2 (−0.50 V vs. NHE), and the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide couple (0.35 V vs. NHE) used in the liquid electrolyte are provided in Fig. S1. These data suggest that the frontier orbitals potentials of the three new complexes satisfy the essential requirements for electron injection to TiO2 and dye regeneration by the iodide electrolyte. Compared with the Ru core in CYC-33R and N749, the electron-rich Os center increases the frontier orbital potentials of Os-3 and CYC-33O, which results in the higher electron injection driving force. The difference in the frontier orbitals' energy level between the two Os complexes reveals that the TH-EDOT moieties do not alter the ground state potential of CYC-33O much. However, they lower the excited state potential of CYC-33O substantially, which indicates that the TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand is highly involved in the singlet and triplet MLCT transitions.
To gain insight into the electronic structures and transitions of Os-3, CYC-33O, and CYC-33R, density functional theory/time-dependent density functional theory (DFT/TDDFT) calculations including relativistic effects were performed. The frontier molecular orbitals of Os-3, CYC-33O, and CYC-33R calculated at the SR-B3LYP/ZORA TZP level are displayed in Fig. 3, and their characteristics are provided in Table S1. In the three new complexes, the metal t2g orbitals are the main components of the three highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2). Regarding the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of Os-3 complex, the π* orbitals of the H3tctpy anchoring ligand are dominant for LUMO and LUMO+2, whereas the π* orbitals of the dmbpy ancillary ligand are the main components for LUMO+1. The LUMOs of CYC-33O and CYC-33R consist of the π* orbitals of TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand (major) and the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand (minor). In contrast, the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand are the dominant components for LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 of CYC-33O and CYC-33R. These results suggest that the low-lying excitations are likely the MLCT transitions from the metal t2g orbitals to the π* orbitals of the ligands.

Fig. 4 presents the scalar relativistic TDDFT (SR-TDDFT) and spin orbit coupling TDDFT (SOC-TDDFT) calculated absorption spectra of Os-3, CYC-33O, and CYC-33R along with their experimental data. The SR-TDDFT results of Os-3 (Fig. 4a and Table S2) show three distinct absorption peaks at 553 nm (S5 state), 528 nm (S6 state), and 493 nm (S8 state) with oscillator strengths (f) of 0.159, 0.270, and 0.110, respectively. These transitions mainly correspond to the experimentally observed absorption band centered at 531 nm. The natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis was carried out, which transforms the transition density matrices into single-particle hole–electron pairs for each excitation, and provides a compact orbital representation of the electronic transition between the ground and excited states. NTO analysis has been widely used to investigate the excited state properties of dye molecules for DSCs. The NTO pairs for the S5, S6, and S8 states of Os-3 illustrated in Fig. S2 show that the hole NTOs are highly localized at the Os atom, whereas the electron NTOs are distributed over the ligands. In particular, the electron NTOs for the S5 and S8 states are mainly delocalized over the anchoring ligand. Based on the NTO analysis, the S5, S6, and S8 states can be characterized as 1MLCT transitions. The SOC-TDDFT calculations of Os-3 (Fig. 4a and Table S2) exhibit one weak transition at 787 nm (ST3; f = 0.011), which is mainly induced by the SOC between the SR T1 excitation at 725 nm and the SR S1 excitation at 657 nm. As shown in Fig. 5a, The hole and electron NTOs contributing to the T1 and S1 transitions are mainly localized on the Os atom and the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand, respectively. The NTO analysis characterizes the ST3 state as a triplet charge transfer transition from Os to the anchoring ligand.
The SR-TDDFT results of CYC-33O (Fig. 4b and Table S3) show the two most intense signals at 568 nm (S5 state; f of 0.594) and 461 nm (S10 state; f of 0.464). The oscillator strengths of these transitions are significantly higher than the corresponding peaks for Os-3, which are consistent with the experimental observations (Fig. 2). Furthermore, CYC-33O displays two transitions at 487 nm (S8 state; f of 0.108) and 478 nm (S9 state; f of 0.121), which are also consistent with the experimental data (Fig. 2). The electron NTOs of S5 and S10 states are mainly delocalized over the π* orbitals of the TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand (Fig. S3). In contrast, the S8 and S9 states have the electron NTOs distributed over the π* orbital of the anchoring ligand (Fig. S3). More importantly, the SOC-TDDFT calculations for CYC-33O show two transition peaks in the far-red domain (760 and 756 nm) with large oscillator strengths (f of ca. 0.02), which match the experimental observations. The largest oscillator strength at 760 nm (ST6 state; f = 0.025) is induced by SOC between some spin-forbidden triplet states (mainly T4 and T3) and two singlet states (S1 and S5). The ST6 state borrows the intensity from the most intense S5 state, which arises from the functionalized ancillary ligand. Moreover, the electron NTOs of the T4 and S1 states are delocalized over the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand (Fig. 5b). The ST7 state at 756 nm is also induced by SOC involving T4, T2, T5, and S2 states. The electron NTOs of these triplet states are delocalized over the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand (Fig. 5b and S3). These results clearly indicate that both the ST6 and ST7 states are the 3MLCT transitions from the Os center to the anchoring ligand. Furthermore, the conjugated TH-EDOT units in the ancillary ligand of CYC-33O are involved in a more intense singlet transition and further enhance the 3MLCT in the far-red region by an intensity borrowing mechanism through SOC. The electron NTOs of the ST6 and ST7 states of CYC-33O distributed over the anchoring ligand and near the carboxyl groups that immobilize the sensitizer to the TiO2 surface indicate that the 3MLCT transitions efficiently contribute electrons to the TiO2 conduction band.
Both the SR- and SOC-TDDFT calculations of CYC-33R (Fig. 4c and Table S4) agree with the experimental absorption profile. The SR-TDDFT simulated spectrum shows two intense peaks at 526 nm (S5 state; f = 0.434) and 431 nm (S10 state; f = 0.409) as well as two low–energy transitions at 589 nm (S1 state; f = 0.107) and 534 nm (S4 state; f = 0.103). Fig. S4 shows that the hole NTOs of the former two states are localized at the Ru atom, whereas the electron NTOs are distributed over the π* orbitals of the ancillary ligands. The electron NTOs for the less intense S1 and S4 states are mainly delocalized over the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand, which also facilitate the electron injection. However, the SOC-TDDFT calculations of CYC-33R show a weak 3MLCT transition at 662 nm (ST3 state; f = 0.002), which is induced by SOC between the triplet states (mainly T1 and T2) and the S1 state. The electron NTOs of the T1 state are delocalized over the π* orbitals of the ancillary ligand, whereas the T2 and S1 states are distributed over the π* orbitals of the anchoring ligand (Fig. 5c). These SOC-TDDFT calculations of the three new complexes reveal that the heavy-atom effect of the metal center is a decisive factor in inducing the low-lying triplet states. Moreover, the conjugated TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand provides higher intensity singlet transitions, which further increase the intensity of 3MLCT transitions in the far-red region via SOC.

Fig. 6a presents the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices sensitized with Os-3, CYC-33O, CYC-33R, and N749, respectively. The response of the cell based on Os-3 is low, which is probably caused by dye aggregation. In contrast, the CYC-33O-sensitized device exhibits remarkable panchromatic conversion extending beyond 1000 nm, which is broader than those of CYC-33R and N749 cells showing the IPCE onset at 860 and 910 nm, respectively. The maximum responses of the CYC-33O dye cell in the visible and NIR regions are 73.0% (560 nm) and 41.7% (870 nm), which are strongly associated with the 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions centered at 546 and 810 nm (Table 1), respectively. In other words, the IPCE spectrum confirms that the 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions of CYC-33O simultaneously enhanced by Os and the TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand contribute substantially to the photocurrent of the cell by transferring the charge from the Os center to the anchoring ligand. The corresponding J–V curves and the PV parameters of the devices sensitized with various metal complex dyes are presented in Fig. 6b and Table 2, respectively. The Jsc values of the devices calculated from the overlap integral of the IPCE spectra with the standard AM 1.5 global spectrum (also included in Table 2) show that the spectral mismatch is less than 4%. The device sensitized with CYC-33O shows Jsc, Voc, and FF of 19.38 mA cm−2, 0.474 V, and 0.623, respectively, yielding a PCE of 5.7%. The Jsc value of the device based on CYC-33O is much higher than those of the cells sensitized with other dyes studied here, owing to the 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions strengthened by the TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand. Using the same cell fabrication conditions, CYC-33R-sensitized device displays Jsc of 16.69 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.533 V, FF of 0.686, and PCE of 6.1%. The higher Voc of the devices based on CYC-33O (vs.Os-3) and CYC-33R (vs.N749) reveals a further advantage of the TH-EDOT-bpy ligand of suppressing undesired charge recombination in the cells.

Intensity modulated photocurrent/voltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) techniques are helpful tools for investigating the internal charge transfer dynamics of the DSC devices. To scrutinize the dissimilar IPCE response (λ < 650 nm), which is highly relevant to the 1MLCT transitions of the complex dyed cells, an intensity-tunable green light-emitting diode (λmax of 527 nm) was used. The electron transfer time (τtr), recombination lifetime (τrec), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) of the devices sensitized with various complexes are summarized in Fig. 7. Under the same illumination level, the order of τtr (Fig. 7a) extracted from the IMPS measurement is Os-3 < CYC-33O < N749 < CYC-33R. The shorter τtr of the devices based on Os-3 and CYC-33O suggests the electron diffusion in TiO2 is faster than that in their Ru counterparts. The excited state potentials of the metal complexes show the reverse trend (Table 1 and Fig. S1). The correlation implies that the faster charge diffusion could be prompted by the higher electron injection driving force or the better overlap between the excited states of the Os-based dyes and the TiO2 conduction band. The order of τrec (Fig. 7b) extracted from the IMVS measurement is consistent with that of τtr and Voc, which reveals that the devices sensitized with Os-3 and CYC-33O encounter a higher magnitude of charge recombination resulting from the higher ground state potentials and the lower dye regeneration driving force. Consequently, ηcc (Fig. 7c) is in the order Os-3 < CYC-33O < CYC-33R < N749, clarifying that the different IPCE response around 527 nm is influenced by the competition between charge transfer and recombination time. These results hint that lower-lying ground states for a larger dye regeneration driving force are critical to the molecular design of high-performance Os complex sensitizers.

Three metal complexes based on Os or Ru were designed and synthesized to red-shift the absorption and enhance the absorbance of both 1MLCT and 3MLCT for DSC applications. The functionalized Os-based photosensitizer, CYC-33O, displayed superior light-harvesting capability compared with Os-3 and CYC-33R. The TH-EDOT-bpy ancillary ligand in CYC-33O enhanced not only the spin-allowed singlet transitions, but also the spin-forbidden triplet transitions via SOC. The SR- and SOC-TDDFT simulations showed that the red-shifted and enhanced 1MLCT and 3MLCT transitions of CYC-33O were principally from the Os center to the H3tctpy anchoring ligand, leading to a panchromatic response beyond 1000 nm of the device. In addition, the Voc extracted from the J–V curves and the internal charge transfer dynamics investigated with the IMPS/IMVS techniques both suggested that the conjugated TH-EDOT-bpy helps to suppress the charge recombination inside the cell. Our results provide new information that will help advance molecular engineering of Os-based sensitizers for highly efficient DSCs.
