Recently, perylene diimide (PDI)-based all-polymer solar cells (All-PSCs) have gained increasing attention due to molecular structural diversity, facile chemical modification, and mechanical and morphological stability. However, acceptor–acceptor (A–A)-structured PDI-based polymeric acceptors (PAs) exhibit inferior photovoltaic performance to donor–acceptor type and/or fused-PDI-based ones. Herein, two A–A type thermo- and photo-stable PAs, namely, PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT, by choosing a long 2-octyldodecyl-substituted PDI unit and 4,7-dithienylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) and/or partially fluorinated 4,7-dithienyl-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTFBT) subunits to construct a polymer backbone, were developed. Both of them possess a complementary absorption profile and a similar ELUMO to donor PTB7-Th. Not only a slightly descended LUMO energy level, better molecular planarity and aggregation, and reduced exciton binding energy (Eb), but also enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency, more closed and ordered stacking, higher and balanced charge mobility and a desired microstructural morphology structure were achieved in partially fluorinated PPDI-DTFBT. Moreover, femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectra suggested faster and more efficient exciton dissociation and transfer characteristics in the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT system. These changes enabled the PPDI-DTFBT-based device to acquire a PCE of 6.04%, which was 51.76% higher than that (3.98%) of its counterpart. This increase was mainly profited from 32.70% increased JSC from 11.10 to 14.73 mA cm−2 and 13.92% enhanced FF from 46.54% to 53.02%. The current results demonstrate that precisely incorporating fluorine into an A–A type PDI-based polymer backbone can synergistically adjust the molecular aggregation and improve the photophysical process, with the aim of gaining an inspirational device efficiency in all-PSCs.

Recently, organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained growing attention and been regarded as an environment friendly alternative to directly convert clean and sustainable solar energy into electricity, due to their richly varied chemical structure, flexibility, semitransparency and large scale roll-to-roll fabrication. The insurmountable downsides including weak light-harvesting ability in the visible region, fossilized electronic energy levels, morphological instability and high cost of fullerene-like electron acceptors curtailed the further development and the relevant devices exhibited a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.7%. To surmount this obstacle, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), whose photoactive layers consist of a binary blend of polymeric donors (PDs) and polymeric acceptors (PAs), have been particularly focused on and they underwent swift and violent development, because of the unparalleled superiorities such as versatile and easily-tuned molecular structures, excellent mechanical properties, good miscibility with polymeric donors and morphological stability. Assisted by exploiting the efficient so-called polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) and reasonably selecting matched polymeric donors, all-PSCs achieved a comparable photovoltaic (PV) performance to small molecular acceptor Y6 derivative systems, and the state-of-the-art efficiency has also outstripped 17%.

Apart from the aforementioned PSMAs, rylene diimides (RDIs), mainly embodying 1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide (perylene diimide for short, PDI) building blocks were demonstrated to be the most efficient building blocks to build sterling electron acceptors, because of the following features including, (i) strong and variable sunlight-harvesting ability, (ii) remarkable electron affinity originating from the strong electron-withdrawing diimide group, (iii) high electron transfer capability induced by quasi-planar conjugated structures, (iv) easy chemical tailoring at different positions, and (v) outstanding thermal-, chemical-, and photo-stability. Thanks to the excellent field-effect transistor (FET) mobility as high as 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mobility of up to 5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, the NDI-based star polymer N2200 obtained via a polycondensation reaction between 2-octyldecyl substituted NDI-based dibromide and bithiophene-containing bitin exhibited a record PCE of 11.0% using green processing solvent cyclopentyl-methylether (CPME) when paired with heptamethyltrisiloxane-terminal-group-functionalized 6-octyl[1,2,3]triazole[4,5-f]isoindole-5,7(2H,6H)-dione-containing electron donor PTzBi-Si. Following this, the efficiency was further up-shifted to 11.76% after optimizing the morphology by utilizing the method of combining the 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran volatile solvent and solvent vapor annealing. In contrast, the PDI moiety has an extended conjugated system and undergoes stronger intermolecular interaction, which is conducive to acquiring a high crystallinity, an elevated electron mobility and thus anticipated PV properties. Nevertheless, the PDI-based PAs displayed a relatively inferior device performance (6.58%, 7.57% and 8.59% for the corresponding unfused PPDIODT, PDI-V, and fused NDP-V) to NDI-based counterparts. The first PDI-containing polymer PPDIDTT made of bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-side-chain-substituted PDI and dithienothiophene (DTT) was exploited by Zhan and his coworkers in 2007 and exhibited a PCE of 1.03% when paired with bi(thienylenevinylene)-bonded polythiphene. Subsequently, the PCE was increased to 3.04% when choosing PBDTTT-C-T as the donor in 2014 and then was continuously maximized to 3.49% when matched with donor BDDT in 2017. Assisted by the design idea of the well-developed PDs, substantial efforts devoted to constructing donor–acceptor (D–A) structured alternating conjugated polymers (CPs) via coupling with numerous electron-rich units, i.e., vinylene (V), fluorene (F), carbazole (Cz), benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT), thiophene (T), selenophene (Se), tellurophene (Te), bithiophene (2T), thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), thienylenevinylene (TVT), cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP), and so on. Apparently, among these PDI-based D–A type CPs, thiophene, tellurophene and vinylene building blocks possessing relatively small volume cubage exhibited an excellent PCE of over 6% (Table S1, ESI). Besides the aforementioned D–A CPs, another combination scenario was the selection of two electron-deficient units to build up acceptor–acceptor (A–A) type PAs (Chart 1), due to their sterling air-stability and outstanding electron transfer properties. Actually, there were limited A–A type PDI-based CPs to be focused on. Early in 2012, Zhan and his coworkers developed an A–A type PA with excellent air stability by combining PDI and fluorenone. Following this, Li et al. introduced the electro-deficient benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) moiety into a PDI-based polymer backbone, and found that 2-octyl-dodecyl (OD) substituted PDI-based P1-C20 with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 2.01 eV acquired a PCE of 0.31%. In 2018, Zhou et al. incorporated 4,7-dithienylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) into a polymer backbone to develop the PPDI-DTBT, exhibiting a remarkably reduced Eoptg of 1.59 eV, increased EHOMO and ELUMO, and thus the markedly enhanced PCE of 4.07% resulting from the increased short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) regardless of the reduced open circuit voltage (VOC); meanwhile, after performing annulation to obtain fused PDI units, the PCE of the corresponding polymer PFPDI-DTBT increased to 6.23%. Besides BT, isoindiago (IIG)-based PIIG-PDI(OD), thieno[2′,3′:5,6]-pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11-dione (TPTI)-based PIP, TPTI's isomer thieno[2′,3′:4,5]-pyrido[2,3-g]thieno[3,2-c]quinoline-4,10-dione (TPTQ)-based PQP and its difluorinated PFP, and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based PDPP-PDI were developed, displaying unsatisfactory PV performance with the PCEs spanning from 0.97% to 3.52% (Table S1, ESI). Therefore, it is of great significance and challenging to explore new efficient A–A type PAs and to delineate the structure–property–performance relationship, aimed at enhancing the PV performance for all-PSCs.
Inspired by the merits of electron-deficient PDI and the advantages of BT, herein, we selected the partially-fluorinated 4,7-dithienyl-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTFBT) moiety to construct the A–A type PDI-based polymeric acceptor PPDI-DTFBT. For comparison, the unfluorinated PPDI-DTBT was prepared for better comparison (Scheme 1). The effects of partially fluorinating BT on absorption, energy levels, molecular configuration, electrostatic potential (ESP), exciton binding energy (Eb), charge mobility, morphology, photophysical procedure and thus PV performance were investigated comprehensively. It was found that partial fluorination of BT not only led to a reduced Eb, enhanced aggregation, and desirable morphology, but also led to improved photophysical properties. Therefore, the PPDI-DTFBT-based device achieved a winning efficiency of 6.04% over that of its counterpart PPDI-DTBT when paired with PTB7-Th.

Synthesis processes of the selected electron-deficient BT-based bistin comonomers 4,7-di(5-(trimethylstannyl)thienyl-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBTSn) and monofluorinated 4,7-di(5-(trimethylstannyl)thienyl-2-yl)-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (DTFBTSn) were obtained according to a previously reported method (Scheme S1, ESI). To ensure enough solubility and solution-processability, large branched fatty primary amine 2-octyldodecylamine (NH2-OD) was selected and obtained via a Gabriel reaction in 76% yield, and dibromide PDI-ODBr2 was prepared according to a similar method with the yield of 39% (Scheme S2, ESI). Chemical structures for all intermediates and comonomers were characterized and verified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR (Fig. S1–S8, ESI) and elemental analyses. Note that the 1H NMR of PDI-ODBr2 (Fig. S7, ESI) demonstrated that the mole ratio between 1,7-isomer and 1,6-isomer was ca. 4:1, due to enormous difficulty in separating these isomers, which was also found by other groups. Both A–A type PAs PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT were synthesized by standard Stille polycondensation and post-treated with Soxhlet extraction applying methanol and hexane successively to eliminate the remaining catalysts and oligomers, and collected toluene fraction as a black solid, with excellent yields of higher than 90% (Scheme 1 and Table S2, ESI).

As can be seen from the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI), the chemical shifts ranging from 9.00 to 8.10 ppm are ascribed to the aromatic protons from the PDI ring, broad peak placed at 7.93 and 8.36 ppm belong to protons of the benzothiadiazole core and ones around 7.45 and 7.05 ppm are ascribed to protons of thiophene, and the signals at 4.12, 2.01, 1.50–1.10 ppm and 0.83 ppm are in turn ascribed to the protons of N–CH2– directly linking to imide N, methylene >CH–, methylene –CH2– and methyl –CH3, suggesting that these A–A type PAs were successfully prepared, with the aid of element analyses. PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT possessed enough solubility in chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) at elevated temperatures, ensuring the congenial films of the photoactive layer during the device fabrication process. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydisperse index were in turn found to be 13.7 kDa and 1.85 for PPDI-DTBT, and 12.4 kDa and 1.91 for PPDI-DTFBT (Table S2, ESI). Thermal stability was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in Fig. S11 (ESI) and the 5% weight-loss decomposed temperatures (Td) under a nitrogen atmosphere were found to be 352 °C for PPDI-DTBT and 444 °C for PPDI-DTFBT, respectively (Table S2, ESI).

The absorption spectra of the resulting A–A type PAs PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT were recorded and are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Both PAs exhibit two distinct vibration peaks and one weak peak in the region ranging from 300 to 800 nm. The high energy peaks placed at 332 nm (0–2) belong to the π–π* transition from DTBT and fluorinated DTFBT moieties, ones around 493 nm (0–1) are ascribed to the π–π* transition of the PDI aromatic ring, and the weak peaks at 616 nm (0–0) are assigned to the weak intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction from the electron-deficient DTBT/DTFBT moiety to another electron-deficient PDI unit. As for CB solution, the spectra of PPDI-DTBT exhibit three absorption bands around 332, 495 and 618 nm. In contrast, the 0–2 peak unchanged, and both 0–1 and 0–0 peaks blue-shifted by 3 nm from 495 to 492 nm and from 618 to 615 nm, respectively, after incorporating one fluorine atom into the BT core. Ongoing from the solution to film state, both PAs exhibit the red-shifted 0–1 and 0–0 peaks. Monofluorinating the BT core enabled the 0–1 and 0–0 peaks to blue-shift by 7 and 8 nm. Furthermore, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT estimated from the corresponding onset absorption (λonset) in the thin film state were 1.63 and 1.67 eV, respectively (Table 1). The molar absorption coefficients (ε) of these A–A type PAs in solution and film states were measured and are shown in Fig. S12 and S13 and Table S2 (ESI), and the ε values were 3.25 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 3.49 × 104 cm−1 for PPDI-DTBT and 3.66 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 4.11 × 104 cm−1 for PPDI-DTFBT, respectively. Obviously, although an enlarged Eoptg was obtained for PPDI-DTFBT, both PAs exhibited similar complementary absorption profile and sunlight-harvesting ability when paired with PTB7-Th. Temperature-dependent absorption (TD-Abs) spectra were recorded to probe into the aggregation ability in the solution state (Fig. S14, ESI). When the temperature was increased from 25 to 105 °C, peaks 0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 were all blue-shifted, and the relevant intensities decreased by inches. Seen from the variation of absorption intensity (Fig. S14c, ESI), it was inferred that fluorination would have an inconsequential effect on the solution aggregation. Considering the importance of photo-stability in the practical All-PSC application, the photo-stability of PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT was measured in Fig. S15 (ESI) using the our reported method. Encouragingly, along with the prolongated light-soaking time from 0 to 240 min, the absorption intensity for PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT almost never fell, indicating that the resulting A–A type PAs possessed excellent photo-stability, which was similar to the PDI-containing dimers 2T-(PDI-HD)2 and F2T-(PDI-HD)2 embodying 2,2′-bithiophene (2T) and 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (F2T) linking cores and TVT-(PDI-HD)2 utilizing thiophene-vinylene-thiophene (TVT) as the linkage.

To clarify the influence of partially fluorinating BT on the electronic energy level, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was applied utilizing ferrocene as the internal standard and the CV curves are shown in Fig. 2. The onset oxidation peak (φonsetox) and onset reduction peak (φredox) were 1.04 V and −0.84 V for PPDI-DTBT, and 1.21 V and −0.82 V for PPDI-DTFBT, respectively. Values for EHOMO and ELUMO were estimated from the equations,  and , respectively, where the  is found to be 0.10 V under our test conditions. Thereupon, the EHOMO and ELUMO of PPDI-DTBT were in turn calculated to be −5.74 and −3.86 eV. After partially incorporating fluorine into BT, the EHOMO and ELUMO were down-shifted to −5.91 and −3.88 eV, respectively (Table 1), which was due to the introduction of large electronegative fluorine atoms into BT and weakening of the electron-deficient ability. Obviously, ELUMO difference values of 0.29 and 0.31 eV between PTB7-Th and PPDI-DTBT and/or PPDI-DTFBT were observed, ensuring the adequate driving force for efficiently dissociating excitons into free charges, and the observed 0.17 eV down-shifted EHOMO was propitious to hindering the hole back transfer from PPDI-DTFBT to the anode (Fig. 2(b)). The increased electrochemical bandgap (Eecg) was consistent with the variation trend of Eoptg.

To understand the effect of monofluorinating BT on molecular geometry and intrinsic characteristic in these investigated A–A type PAs, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP-(D3)BJ/6-31g(d,p) level. The actual polymers PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT were simplified into dimers, (PDI-DTBT)2 and (PDI-DTFBT)2, which embodied two repeating units and 2-octyldodecyl side chains that were simplified into iso-butyl, to save cost and enhance the efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3, the LUMO orbitals were mainly concentrated on the PDI core, while the HOMO orbitals were mainly distributed over the whole polymer backbone. The calculated EHOMO, ELUMO and bandgap were in turn found to be −5.60, −3.72 and 1.88 eV for (PDI-DTBT)2, and −5.69, −3.74 and 1.95 eV for (PDI-DTFBT)2. The tendency of down-shifted EHOMO and ELUMO and increased band gap after partially fluorinating the BT is consistent with the observed tendency in the CV test (Fig. 2(b)).

Furthermore, the twisted angles θ1 and θ2 (between thiophene and BT), and θ3 and θ4 (between PDI and thiophene) were found to be 167.73°, 167.94°, −122.60° and −127.11° for (PDI-DTBT)2, and 172.65°, −178.51°, −122.18° and 113.35° for (PD-DTFBT)2, respectively (Table 2). Obviously, the twisting angles inside the DTBT/DTFBT units were smaller than those between PDI and DTBT/DTFBT. Surprisingly, the dihedral angle between two neighboring PDI units was markedly decreased from 77.69° to 18.54° after fluorination (Fig. 3). The reduced twisting angles and dihedral angles between PDI units suggest that partial fluorination resulted in better molecular planarity, which is conducive to obtaining ordered molecular stacking and improving the charge transfer properties.

Molecular electrostatic potentials (ESPs) of (PDI-DTBT)2 and (PDI-DTFBT)2 were calculated and are shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI). For better comparison, the ESP distribution for model molecule (TB7-Th)2 predigested from the electron donor PTB7-Th is listed in Fig. S16 (ESI). The positive ESP was found in the most surfaces of (PDI-DTBT)2 and (PDI-DTFBT)2, and the negative ESP regions were mainly located only at the highly electronegative carbonyl oxygen from PDI. After monofluorinating BT, the overall surface area increased from 1404.51 to 1409.09 Å2, and the molecular polarity index (MPI) slightly uplifted from 7.65 to 7.92 kcal mol−1. Also, the total average ESP value maximized from 1.83 to 1.96 kcal mol−1; that is to say, the ESP difference between donor PTB7-Th and the investigated polymeric acceptors increased from 3.44 to 3.57 kcal mol−1. Such variations could produce the intermolecular electric field (IEF) which was instrumental in forming and dissociating processes of the exciton. Generally, organic semiconductors exhibit low dielectric constant and high coulombic attractive interaction between charge carriers, and the exciton binding energy (Eb), which is referred to the energy when the exciton is dissociated into free charge carriers, is an important parameter for OSCs. Therefore, the Eb value was calculated (Table 3) and the corresponding value was found to have reduced from 0.29 to 0.27 eV after partially fluorinating BT. The 0.02 eV reduced Eb could promote the dissociation process of excitons and thus improve the device efficiency.

To find out the impact of partially fluorinating the BT core on the photovoltaic performance, devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTBT-Th:polymeric acceptors/PDINO/Al were fabricated. The device test process included selecting the donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio using the solvent additive. As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI), when the D:A ratio was varied from 1:1.5 to 1:1.2, to 1:1, then to 1.2:1, the PCE of PPDI-DTBT-based devices first increased from 2.34% to 2.77% then decreased to 2.27% and then to 1.89%, and in contrast, the PCE of the PPDI-DTFBT-based device first increased from 2.27% to 2.59% and then decreased to 2.42% and then to 1.77% (Table S4, ESI). Therefore, the best weight ratio for both these polymer acceptors was 1:1.2. Subsequently, the solvent additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) were selected to adjust the microstructural morphology of the photoactive layer and further maximize the device efficiency. When utilizing 3% DIO (volume content) as the additive, an increase of 14.08% in the PCE from 2.77% to 3.16% was achieved in the PPDI-DTBT-based device, mainly benefiting from an 21.25% elevated FF. In the meantime, an increase in 9.65% in the PCE from 2.59% to 2.84% was achieved after partially fluorinating the BT, chiefly profiting from collectively 5.38% increased JSC and 3.19% ameliorated FF (Fig. S18 and Table S4, ESI). Following this, after utilizing 0.5% CN (volume content), an increase of 33.41% in the JSC from 8.32 to 11.10 mA cm−2 contributed to an increase of 25.95% in the PCE from 3.16% to 3.98% in the PPDI-DTBT-based device in spite of the marginally decreased VOC and FF. In contrast, an increase of 87.88% in the JSC from 7.84 to 14.73 mA cm−2 and an increase of 12.93% in the FF from 46.95% to 53.02% jointly contributed to an increase of 112.68% in PCE from 2.84% to 6.04% in the PPDI-DTFBT-based device (Fig. S18 and Table S4, ESI). We can see that the optimal PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT-based device achieved a PCE of 3.98%, with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 11.10 mA cm−2 and an FF of 46.54%, which was comparable to the previously reported value measured from Zhou's group. Similarly, the best PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT-based device exhibited a PCE of 6.04%, with a VOC of 0.77 V, a JSC of 14.73 mA cm−2 and an FF of 53.02% (Fig. 5(a) and Table 4). Evidently, after monofluorinating BT, the increase of 32.70% in JSC from 11.10 to 14.73 mA cm−2 and an increase of 13.92% in FF from 46.54% from 53.02% synergistically led to an increase of 51.76% in PCE from 3.98% to 6.04%. The increased FF was supported by the reduced series resistance (Rs) from 17.24 Ω cm2 to 10.11 Ω cm2 and latter improved charge mobility (Table 4).

We recorded the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in order to evaluate the accuracy of the J–V measurement which are shown in Fig. 5(b). The EQE spectra exhibited a wide response range spanning from 300 to 800 nm for both devices, which was identical to the preceding absorption spectra observed in Fig. 1(b). It could be deduced that the photo-response smaller than 600 nm with a peak of ca. 480 nm mainly resulted from PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT; meanwhile, the photo-response between 600 and 800 nm chiefly correlated with that of donor PTB7-Th. Evidently, the photo-response spanning from 350 to 750 nm of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT-based cell was higher than that of the PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT-based one, which was identical to the previously observed enhanced light-harvesting ability (Fig. 1(b)). The integrated JSC values estimated from the EQE curves were found to be 10.95 mA cm−2 for PPDI-DTBT and 14.90 mA cm−2 for PPDI-DTFBT; these deviations smaller than 5% implied the good accuracy of the J–V test. In addition, the device stability was also measured at room temperature and under 1 sun LED light in an N2-filled glovebox with O2 and H2O contents less than 1 ppm and is shown in Fig. S19 (ESI). We can see that after light-exposure for 72 h, the values of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE remained at 98%, 90%, 95% and 86%, respectively, of their initial values, indicating that these A–A type polymeric acceptors possess good stability.

The measurement of characteristics of the photocurrent density (Jph) relative to effective voltage (Veff) was performed to probe into the impact of partially fluorinating BT on the exciton dissociation process. Note that Jph is equal to JL–JD, in which JL and JD are the current–density under the conditions of light-irradiation (JL) and dark (JD), respectively. And Veff is defined as V0–Vappl where V0 is the voltage when Jph is equal to 0, and Vappl is the applied bias voltage. The exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) was obtained from the ratio of Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions. PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT- and PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT-based devices displayed the Pdiss of 77.31% and 81.99%, respectively, as exhibited in Fig. S20 (ESI) and Table S5 (ESI). An increase of 6.05% in Pdiss was indicative of efficient exciton dissociation after partially fluorinating BT units, which was good for enhancing the JSC. The influence of partially fluorinated BT units on the charge transfer characteristic was also studied using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC, in Section 1.3 of ESI). The related mobilities of hole (μh) and electron (μe) were measured as shown in Fig. S21 (ESI) and the detailed data are listed in Table S5 (ESI). The values of μh and μe in the optimal PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT-based device were found to be 9.92 × 10−5 and 8.78 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which were close to the values found in Zhou's measurement. After partially fluorinating the BT unit, both μh and μe were found to have increased to 1.36 × 10−4 and 1.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 4), which agreed with the previous trend of improved planarity and enhanced aggregation. Furthermore, the decreased ratio of μh/μe from 11.30 to 8.59 was observed after monofluorinating the BT unit. These lately discovered 6.05% increased exciton dissociation efficiency, 37.10% enhanced μh, 79.95% elevated μe and more balanced μh/μe ratio could partially explain the reason of the 32.70% improved JSC, 13.92% enhanced FF and 51.76% boosted PCE.


To further analyze the origin of the boosted charge mobility and photovoltaic properties of partially fluorinating the BT core, we chose the two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) to ascertain the molecular orientation and crystallinity in the blend films. Note that the corresponding 2D-scattering images are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), one-dimensional (1D)-line cut profiles are presented in Fig. 6(c) and (d), and the GIWAXS data are collected in Table S6 (ESI). Both the resultant blend films preferred the predominately face-on molecular orientation relative to substrate in the direction of out-of-plane (OOP), corresponding to the distinct (010) diffraction peaks at q = 1.643 Å−1 and 1.653 Å−1, respectively, indicative of the π–π stacking distances of d(010) = 3.82 Å and 3.80 Å for PPDI-DTBT- and PPDI-DTFBT-based films, respectively. Also, the corresponding (100) diffraction peaks placed at q = 0.260 Å−1 and 0.262 Å−1, corresponding to lamellar stacking distances of d(100) = 24.14 Å and 23.98 Å, were observed (Table S6, ESI). The enhanced π–π and lamellar intermolecular interaction were both observed in mono-fluorinated PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT-based blend films. The values of crystal coherence length (CCL) were calculated according to Scherrer equation. We can see that when incorporating fluorine into BT unit, the CCL(010) and CCL(100) values were both increased from 12.7 Å to 13.8 Å and from 62.8 Å to 65.0 Å, respectively. Obviously, more closed molecular stacking, stronger crystallinity and greater nano-scaled aggregation in the PPDI-DTFBT system could be observed, which was helpful in exciton dissociation and charge transport, which could explain the reason of improved JSC, FF and thus the elevated overall PCE.

To comprehensively figure out the reason why partially fluorinated BT units within the polymer backbone achieved the champion device performance, the morphology of the photoactive layer was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It can be seen that both blend films were smooth and uniform, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Significantly, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was increased from 1.11 to 1.25 nm and a slightly improved phase separation within a nanoscaled bicontinuous interpenetrating network was formed (Fig. 7(c) and (d)) after partially fluorinating the BT unit of the polymer backbone. These morphological features tallied with the enhanced aggregation in 2D-GIWAXS analysis and reduced miscibility when blending with PTB7-Th, and in turn contributed to the improved device performance.
The miscibility and molecular interaction between polymeric acceptors PPDI-DTBT, PPDI-DTFBT and PTB7-Th were analyzed by comparing the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χD–A = (γD0.5 − γA0.5)2) obtained from the contact angle (θ) tests of pure films according to the two-solvent method utilizing water and ethylene glycol (EG). The related contact angle measurements are shown in Fig. S22 (ESI) and the corresponding parameters including surface energy (γ) and χD–A are summarized in Table S7 (ESI). It was depicted that the γ values were successively 29.65, 31.52 and 31.81 mN m−1 for PTB7-Th, PPDI-DTBT, and PPDI-DTFBT. Therefore, the interaction parameter values χD–A for PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT to PTB7-Th were found to be 0.0286 K and 0.0379 K, respectively. Evidently, the increased χD–A suggested that PPDI-DTFBT possess reduced miscibility, agreeing with the improved aggregation observed in AFM analysis.

Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy of pure and blend films excited at 400 nm pump light was performed to explore the underlying reason of improved device performance via monofluorinating BT units in these PDI-based PAs. As shown in Fig. S23 (ESI), pure PTB7-Th films exhibited ground state bleaching (GSB) signals (560–750 nm) with a negative ΔA value, assigned to the electron transition from the ground state to excited state excited by pump light, matching with the anterior steady-state absorption spectra (Fig. 1(b)) and excited state absorption (ESA) signal (690–890 nm) with a positive ΔA value. In contrast, pure PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT films exhibited similar GSB signals (550–710 nm) and ESA signals (720–910 nm). As elucidated in Fig. S23(g)–(i) (ESI), the corresponding decay times (τ) were fitted through a bi-exponential decay function according to their GSB peaks at 712, 645 and 635 nm, respectively, aimed at understanding the ultrafast dynamics process. It was exhibited that two decay times τ1 and τ2, were 1.96 and 219.51 ps for PPDI-DTBT, 3.42 and 167.44 ps for PPDI-DTFBT, and 2.31 and 974.05 ps for PTB7-Th, respectively. The latter decay time was two orders of magnitude higher than the former one. These indicated the resulting PDI-based polymeric acceptors and PTB7-Th went through a similar physical process after being excited. To further investigate the charge transfer (CT) dynamics of the corresponding blend films, fs-TA spectroscopy was performed as shown in Fig. 8. The PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT blend film exhibited GSB signals ranging from 560–740 nm with peaks of 637 nm and 709 nm, with the former one belonging to PPDI-DTBT and the latter one belonging to PTB7-Th, as well as an ESA signal from 740 nm to 900 nm with a peak of 861 nm. After introducing fluorine into the BT core, these GSB and ESA peaks almost unchanged. To quantitatively analyse the hole-transfer and electron-transfer dynamics processes, the polymeric acceptor's signal at 637 nm and PTB7-Th's signal at 709 nm were both fitted by the bi-exponential function to assess the life times. Based on Fig. 8(c) and (f), the decay times τ1 and τ2 of hole-transfer were respectively found to be 1.56 and 121.29 ps for PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT, and 0.79 and 115.87 ps for PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT at 637 nm. Meanwhile, the decay times τ1 and τ2 of the electron-transfer were in turn found to be 1.96 and 187.15 ps for PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTBT, and 1.19 and 155.82 ps for PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT at 709 nm. The τ1 was assigned to the ultrafast exciton dissociation at the interface, and the τ2 was assigned to the exciton dissociation in the domain. After partially fluorinating the BT core, both for hole- and electron-transfer procedure, the found shorter τ1 implied the faster exciton dissociation at the D/A interfaces, correlating with the 0.02 eV reduced Eb and increased exciton dissociation efficiency, and shorter τ2 demonstrated faster exciton transfer from their intradomain to the D/A interface, corresponding to the enhanced aggregation, slightly improved morphology and elevated charge mobility, which could be accounted for the improved JSC, FF and thus total PCE in the PPDI-DTFBT-based device.


To conclude, via condensation polymerization between PDI-based dibromide and 4,7-dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT)- and/or 4,7-dithienyl-5-fluorobenzothiadiazole (DTFBT)-containing bistins, two A–A type polymeric acceptors PPDI-DTBT and PPDI-DTFBT were synthesized. Both of them exhibited wide absorption spanning from 300 to 780 nm, sterling thermo- and photo-stability, and an ELUMO of about −3.87 eV, exhibiting good compatibility with PTB7-Th. The partial fluorination barely influenced spectral complementarity regardless of an increased optical bandgap. And the gradually down-shifted EHOMO, reduced Eb, and better molecular planarity were also observed. Further fs-TA analysis exhibited that there exist efficient exciton dissociation and a transfer procedure in PTB7-Th:PPDI-DTFBT, which led to a higher photocurrent and fill factor. As a result, the conjointly 32.70% increased JSC and 13.92% enhanced FF were achieved, resulting in an 51.76% increased PCE from 3.98% to 6.04% after partially fluorinating the BT core. This improvement was benefited from the increased exciton dissociation efficiency, strengthened molecular aggregation and concomitant elevated and more balanced charge mobility, as well as improved microstructural morphology. Our experimental results proved that precisely choosing the fluorination can effectively adjust the molecular aggregation and influence the photophysical properties, giving rise to boosted device performance in PDI-based all-PSCs.
