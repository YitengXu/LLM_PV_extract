Complex three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures based on well-defined low-dimensional nanobranches of different sizes and specific exposed facets are highly desirable to obtain tunable physicochemical properties. Herein, a facile, one-step hydrothermal method is employed to construct self-branching anatase TiO2 (SBAT) 3D hierarchical nanostructures. By simply controlling the reaction time and weight ratio of F127/TBAH, SBAT nanorods can be obtained with a large percentage of exposed {010} facets. Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, a growth mechanism is proposed for the formation of such self-branching 3D nanostructures, which involves the formation of the L-shaped step edges on the [103] surfaces and the alignment of the crystal facets (103) of anatase nanocrystals with the (103) face on the tips of the main anatase TiO2 nanorods. The dye-sensitized solar cell assembled with the SBAT nanorods exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 7.17%, which is superior to that of the devices based on the 1D anatase TiO2 nanorods and P25 TiO2. This high performance can be attributed to the high dye-uptake density, large size and unique self-branching 3D hierarchical nanostructures built from 1D nanobranches growing epitaxially from the main rod.

Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) with tailor-made crystal facets and morphology has attracted intensive interest because its photoelectric and photocatalytic properties can be further enhanced or optimized by tailoring the surface atomic structures, phase composition, crystallite size, organization and surface area. For instance, Lu and co-workers synthesized anatase TiO2 single crystals with mainly exposed {001} facets and demonstrated that the {001} facets are much more reactive than {101} facets for the production of H2 from water splitting. Studies on photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) determined that the anatase {001} facets can increase the dye-uptake due to the higher density of 5-fold-coordinated Ti atoms on the (001) facets. Wu et al. reported rhombic-shaped anatase TiO2 with 43.4% {010} facets and exhibited conspicuous photocatalytic activity. Moreover, Wen et al. obtained anatase TiO2 nanocrystal-exposed {010} facets via hydrothermal treatment of titanate nanosheets and discovered that the {010} facets show high photocatalytic activity and high ruthenium dye adsorption ability. Recently, tetragonally faceted anatase nanorods with exposed {010} facets prepared from Na-titanate precursor exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity. Although the surface energy of {001} (0.90 J m−2) is much higher than that of {010} (0.53 J m−2) and {101} (0.44 J m−2), theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated that {010} facets have the highest catalytic activity among {001}, {010} and {101} facets. Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve the aspect ratio-controlled synthesis of well-faceted anatase TiO2 rods mainly enclosed by {010}. Nevertheless, owing to the instability of {010} with high surface energy during crystal growth, it remains a challenge to prepare tetragonally faceted anatase rods with dominantly exposed {010} facets. However, most synthesis methods of {010}-rich, well-defined anatase rods require tedious two-step reactions.

In addition, it is noteworthy that a substantial amount of research has recently been devoted to the controlled synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structures built from one-dimensional (1D) nanoscale building blocks. Nanorod-based, 3D hierarchically structured TiO2 can be prepared through the following approaches: vapor deposition, vapor oxidation, two-step solution, and a one-step hydrothermal routine. In these cases, the one-step hydrothermal approach is the most simple method and most of the as-prepared products are rutile TiO2, which is the most thermodynamically stable among the three polymorphs: anatase, rutile and brookite. However, rutile usually shows inferior photovoltaic performance compared to anatase TiO2 due to the smaller amount of adsorbed dye and slower electron transport rate. Moreover, nanorod-based 3D hierarchically structured TiO2 is highly desirable to increase the surface areas for enhanced dye adsorption. Nonetheless, in this work, we report a facile, one-step hydrothermal approach to produce self-branching anatase TiO2 (SBAT) 3D hierarchical nanostructures with a large percentage of exposed {010} facets, which shows a lower surface area compared to non-branched 1D anatase TiO2. Similarly, hyperbranched, hierarchical nanostructures have recently been reported for asymmetric crystal structures (e.g., TiO2, Bi2S3, Co2P, Fe2P, BaWO4, LnVO4 (Ln = Ce, Nd) and β-FeO(OH)) by several research groups. They attributed the formation of such hierarchical nanostructures to crystal splitting, which is regarded as one of the main origins for the formation of fractal crystals and self-assembled hierarchical nanostructures. However, one important growth mechanism for inducing crystal branching can employ an oriented attachment. As is well known, it is a challenge to distinguish between shape evolution during crystal growth and the oriented growth mechanism. Therefore, we propose a growth mechanism of self-branching 3D nanostructures based on the crystallographic alignment of the 1D nanobranch surfaces with the main rod crystal facets. The as-obtained SBAT exhibits promising behavior in DSSCs, giving rise to an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 7.17%, superior to that of the DSSCs based on the 1D anatase TiO2 nanorods and P25 TiO2. This can be ascribed to the high dye-uptake density, large size and unique self-branching 3D hierarchical nanostructures built from 1D nanobranches growing epitaxially from the main rod.

All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Poly(ethylene oxide)100-poly(propylene oxide)65-poly(ethylene oxide)100 (F127) was obtained from Fluka, and other reagents were of analytical purity and were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.


In a typical synthesis, 1.8 g of F127 was first dissolved in 20 g of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide solution (TBAH, 10 wt%) with ultrasonic stirring. The weight ratio of F127/TBAH was 0.9 in all cases. After a transparent solution was obtained, 4 mL of tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT) was added into the abovementioned solution, and then magnetically stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for different reaction times, i.e., 1, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h. After the reaction, the products were obtained by centrifugation, followed by rinsing several times with ethanol and deionized water. Finally, the products were dried at 70 °C for further use.


The as-produced TiO2 paste was obtained by adding 0.5 g of the as-produced TiO2 into 0.8 g of 5 wt% hydroxypropyl cellulose of diethylene glycol solution and stirred for two days at 60 °C. The resulting paste was spread onto the FTO glass by doctor blading using Scotch tape as a frame and spacer to control film thickness, dried at 200 °C for 10 min and subsequently heated in air for 40 min at 490 °C. After cooling to 80 °C, the as-produced TiO2 film was sensitized with a dry ethanol containing 0.3 mM N719 overnight.


To make a reasonable comparison, the thickness and active area of all the anode films was about 13 μm and 0.20 cm2, respectively. To assemble the solar cells, a Pt-coated conducting glass was placed on the sensitized TiO2 film, separated by a 50 μm thin membrane spacer. The assembled cell was then clipped together as an open cell. An electrolyte, which was made with 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a dry mixed solution (acetonitrile: valeronitile = 85:15) was injected into the open cell from its edges by capillarity.


The as-prepared TiO2 were characterized with the use of field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2010F operated at 200 kV), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2200 V diffractometer with CuKα radiation, λ = 0.1541 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA), UV-vis spectrophotometry (Lamda-2), and BET (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). Photocurrent–voltage measurements were performed under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 with a simulated AM 1.5 solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar Simulator).


SBAT nanostructures can be synthesized by a facile, one-step hydrothermal method. SEM and TEM images of corresponding branched nanostructures (Fig. 1) show the morphological features of SBAT synthesized with a reaction time of 24 h. The length of the self-branching TiO2 nanorods was 0.7–2.3 μm with a core nanorod and dense primary nanobranches growing from both ends of the core rod with different radial angles. Furthermore, observation reveals that the nanobranches atop were parallel to the long axis of the main rod, which is evident from the HRTEM observation, whereas the nanobranches surrounding the side surface of the main rod tended to be tilted with the long axis of the main rod. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1d) of the area marked by a dashed red square in panel c shows that there were four primary nanorods. The phase and crystal structure of the primary nanorods were confirmed by the lattice image of Fig. 1d. The distance between lattice fringes was assigned to (101) and (001) of the anatase TiO2 phase. The crystalline distances were exactly consistent with d101 = 0.352 nm and d001 = 0.476 nm of the anatase TiO2 phase. The interfacial angle of 43.4° agreed with the angle of the (101) and (−101) planes. The primary nanorods were of perfect single-crystal nature, which grew along the c axis and were exposed with the (010) plane. The (101) planes of the four primary nanorods were almost parallel to each other. This might suggest that the primary nanorods grew epitaxially from the core rod, reflecting a certain interfacial crystallographic relationship between the core rod and the nanobranches.

The as-synthesized samples were examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), and their patterns (Fig. 2) show that all of the XRD peaks matched well with the crystal structure of the anatase TiO2 phase (space group I41/amd, JCPDS card no. 21-1272), and no other phases can be detected. The XRD intensity of the sample prepared for 1 h was much lower than that of the other sample with different reaction times from 6 h to 24 h, which is closely related to their shapes and crystallinities. The (004) and (200) peaks were respectively used to estimate the lengths of the crystal-stacking domain along the c- and a-axes of the anisotropic particles (Fig. 2b). The intensity ratios of (004)/(200) were shifted from 1.00 for the sample obtained in 1 h to 0.86, 0.65, 0.71 and 0.75 for the samples prepared for 6, 8, 12 and 24 h, respectively. Such features hint that the as-prepared samples had a preferred growth orientation along the c-axes of the anatase lattice, and their anisotropic growth changed with increasing reaction time.
A series of hydrothermal experiments with different reaction times were carried out to investigate the time-dependent morphological evolution of the as-obtained anatase TiO2. We found that the formation of self-branching nanostructures was strongly dependent on the reaction time. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the reaction duration was as short as 1 h, 600 nm-sized starfish-like anatase TiO2 nanospindle aggregates coexisted with anatase TiO2 nanospindles (nanospindle-based TiO2 (NSBT) is named to refer to the sample prepared for 1 h) with a uniform diameter of about 70 nm and a length of about 700 nm. When the reaction was prolonged to 6 h (Fig. 3b), the starfish-like nanospindle-based aggregates disappeared, and the sample was composed entirely of well-faceted anatase TiO2 nanorods (ATN) with a main diameter of about 80 nm and a length of about 600 nm. Upon further increasing the reaction time from 6 h to 8 h (Fig. 3c), a mixture of non-branched nanorods that exhibited a wide-size distribution with a main diameter of about 50 nm and a length of about 490 nm and 70–125 × 500–810 nm-sized branched TiO2 nanorods composed of a few primary nanorods was obtained. One can observe that the non-branched nanorods had a smaller size than the nanorods obtained in 6 h, whereas the size of the branched TiO2 nanorods increased with an increase in the amount of their primary nanobranches. After the reaction evolved for 12 h (Fig. 3d), the as-obtained sample almost exclusively contained branched TiO2 nanorods with lengths of 0.7–1.5 μm, the primary branches of which were denser than the sample prepared for 8 h but less dense than the sample prepared for 24 h. The more detailed structural information of the as-prepared products synthesized with different reaction times were further analyzed by TEM and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements.

Fig. 4a shows a typical TEM image at low magnification of anatase particles prepared for 1 h, revealing that the anatase particles were composed of nanospindle-based aggregates and spindles, consistent with SEM observations. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a single spindle shows that the lattice fringes with spacings of 0.352 and 0.476 nm were ascribed to the (101) and (002) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively, indicating the preferred growth along the c-axis (Fig. 4b). The surface profile image of the spindle showed stepped terraces on the [101] surface, which were marked with black arrows. The stepped surface of the spindle was faceted with TiO2 anatase {101} faces as shown by red lines. Such a saw-toothed shape of the spindle with the inclined {101} surface indicated that the spindle-like structure was formed through oriented attachment occurring in the 〈001〉 direction. With the reaction time extended up to 6 h, only anatase TiO2 nanorods of 40–80 nm in lateral size and 340 to 740 nm in longitudinal size remained (Fig. 4c), which agrees well with the SEM results. Fig. 4d shows a TEM image of a representative single rod with a size of about 90 × 740 nm. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4e) can be indexed by the diffraction from the [010] zone axis, indicating the single-crystal nature of the rod and preferred growth direction along the c axis.Fig. 4f shows an HRTEM image of the rod tip, further confirming its single-crystal nature. The tip was truncated cone-like, and it was terminated by five different lattice planes. The three sets of lattice fringes with spacings of 0.352, 0.476 and 0.352 nm can be assigned to the (101), (002) and (−101) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. An angle of 100.1° observed on the rod tip was consistent with the theoretical value for the interfacial angle between the (103) and (−103) facets, indicating that the rod exhibited flat facets of {103}, and the result can be confirmed by SAED observation. Based on the SEM, TEM and SAED results together with the crystallographic symmetries of anatase, we can conclude that the anatase TiO2 nanorods were enclosed by lateral {010}, {101}, {103} and top {001} facets (see the inset in Fig. 4d).
As previously mentioned, one significant feature observation in Fig. 1 is that the growth directions of nanobranches atop the main rod seem to be parallel to the c-axis of the main rod, suggesting a specific defined relationship between the crystalline main rod and the nanobranches. To further understand the relationship between the morphological transformation of TiO2 particles and such structural relationships, we applied TEM to carefully examine the branched structure and particularly the connecting interfaces of the sample prepared for 8 h. Fig. 5a shows a typical overview image of anatase TiO2 rods with a few small nanobranches marked by the dashed red circles, demonstrating the earlier stage of the formation process of branched nanostructures. In this growth stage, an L-shaped step edge at the tip of the anatase TiO2 rods was formed as indicated by a dotted red square in Fig. 5a, and small nanobranches marked by the dashed red circles started to grow from the corner of the L-shaped step edges. Closer observation (Fig. 5b) found that the long axis of the nanobranch was parallel to that of the main rod and exhibited a 40° angle with respect to the normal of the nanobranch/main rod boundary. The SAED patterns (Fig. 5c) recorded from the nanobranch/main rod junction show that the (200) planes of the main rod were parallel to the (300) planes of the nanobranch and the interfacial angle of (002) and (103) planes was 50°, which is equal to that of the long axis of the nanobranch and the interface between the nanobranch and main rod. This indicates that the nanobranch epitaxially grew from the main rod and its (103) crystal facet was aligned with (103) facet of the main rod. An HRTEM image recorded from the nanobranch/main rod junction further confirms the perfect epitaxial growth (Fig. 5d).

Based on the experimental observations, we propose a possible formation mechanism of self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorods, as shown in Fig. 6. The final morphology of TiO2 crystals is related both to their crystal growth habit and reaction condition such as reaction solvents, reaction time, and surfactants. It is generally believed that the growth habit of TiO2 crystals under solution conditions is highly dependent on the relative order of surface energies. For anatase TiO2 crystals, the surface energy decreases in the order of γ{001} (0.90 J m−2) > γ{103} (0.83 J m−2) > γ{010} (0.53 J m−2) > γ{101} (0.44 J m−2). As the primary driving force for crystal growth, the reduction in surface energy leads to anisotropic growth due to different surface energies of various crystal planes. Furthermore, reduction in surface energy leads to crystal morphology evolution due to the minimization of the area of high surface energy faces. In the present work, the morphology evolution of anatase TiO2 particles is strongly dependent on the reaction duration while keeping other parameters fixed, including reaction temperature, concentrations of precursor, and weight ratio of F127/TBAH. After 10 min of reaction at 180 °C, the reaction solution started to become turbid, and a large amount of tiny nanoparticles coexisted with a small amount of starfish-like anatase TiO2 nanospindle aggregates and anatase TiO2 nanospindles (top-left side in Fig. 6). The formation of spindle-like nanostructures appears to be driven by the minimization of the overall surface energies via orientation attachment, which is regarded to generally exist in the early stages of crystal growth. This leads to the fusion of several particles into a single crystal by sharing a common crystallographic orientation, despite the presence of strong, surface-bound ligands. In our previous work, we found that high concentrations of TBAH can induce the anisotropic growth of TiO2 particles via orientation attachment, leading to the formation of anatase rod-shaped TiO2. After a reaction for 1 h at this temperature, the starfish-like anatase TiO2 nanospindle aggregates coexisting with anatase TiO2 nanospindles became dominant, and the anatase TiO2 nanospindles were dominantly enclosed by stepped terraces on the [101] surface, leading to nearly 100% exposed {101} facets. With an increase in reaction time to 6 h, the starfish-like anatase TiO2 nanospindle aggregates coexisting with anatase TiO2 nanospindles completely transformed into anatase TiO2 tetragonally faceted nanorods enclosed by lateral {010}, {101}, {103} and top {001} facets. In our reaction system, Bu4N+ cations generated from TBAH can selectively adhere to particular crystal facets such as {010}, {103} facets and hinder their growth. Moreover, OH− anions coming from TBAH preferentially adsorbed onto {010} facets forming O-terminated {010} facets and thereby thermodynamically stabilized the {010} facets, resulting in a large percentage of exposed {010} facets. As a co-surfactant, block copolymer F127 can completely cap the surface of TiO2 particles. It was reported that F127 plays a vital role in the anisotropic self-assembly of TiO2 nanoparticles via orientation attachment proceeding on the {200} planes. However, we found that in a controlled experiment, with an increase in the weight ratio of F127/TBAH from 0.9 to 1.0, no self-branching nanostructures were observed after 24 h of reaction time (Fig. S1a, ESI). Furthermore, increasing the weight ratio of F127/TBAH to 1.1 with 24 h of reaction time led to a mixture of nanorods and particles of irregular shape, which was composed of anatase (97.3%) and rutile (2.7%) (Fig. S1b, ESI). When the weight ratio of F127/TBAH reached 1.4, particles of irregular shape consisting of 47.8% anatase and 52.2% rutile can exclusively be obtained in 24 h of reaction time (Fig. S1c, ESI). Therefore, a sufficient quantity of F127 might tightly and completely bind to the surface of TiO2 particles, as well as hinder the selective absorption of organic amines and OH− anions from TBAH onto the specific facets of TiO2 particles, leading to the failure of the anisotropic growth. With a further increase in reaction time (more than 6 h) under 0.9 of the weight ratio of F127/TBAH, L-shaped step edges are found to be formed (bottom-left side in Fig. 6). This might be due to the considerably extended time (more than 6 h) by which F127 below its critical concentration broke the equilibrium adsorption on the surfaces of the anatase TiO2 nanorods, resulting in the exposure of the surfaces without F127 capping on the tips of anatase TiO2 nanorods. Furthermore, OH− anions from TBAH can then selectively etch the exposed clean surfaces, forming the L-shaped step edges on the [103] surfaces. To further reduce the surface energy of the reaction system, the crystal facets (103) of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles preferred to be aligned with the (103) face of the L-shaped step edges of the anatase TiO2 nanorods, forming nanobranches growing along the direction parallel to the long axis of the main anatase TiO2 nanorods. Such preferential growth explains the formation of nanobranches parallel to the c-axis of the main rod. However, it does not seem to explain the formation of nanobranches with tilted angles to the c-axis of the main rod. We believe that crystal splitting is most likely responsible for the formation of the nanobranches. In general, crystal splitting is associated with both thermodynamic and kinetic factors: variation in the total free energy of crystal growth, extra molecules appearing in the reaction system and fast crystal growth strongly dependent on the reaction solution oversaturation. The extra amount of surfactants and occurrence of crystal etching might produce a large amount of surfactant-passivated monomers, leading to fast crystal growth. The violent growth fluctuations within the solution layer closest to the starting seeds would locally accelerate monomer addition to the {103} surface with the highest energy among the exposed surfaces, leading to the nanocrystal splitting to form the nanobranches. Conflicting with the previous results, we increased the amount of F127 surfactant, leading to the failure of the crystal splitting formation. This may be due to the fact that increase in the amount of F127 prohibits crystal etching and changes the thermodynamic stability order of the possible TiO2 polymorphs, which is confirmed by the XRD results (Fig. S1, ESI). In addition, the dislocations at the interfacial connection confirmed by the TEM observation of Fig. S2 (ESI) tend to induce crystal splitting, leading to the formation of nanobranches.



Fig. 7 shows the UV-visible spectra of NSBT, ATN, SBAT-12 h, SBAT-24 h and commercial P25 TiO2. The bandgap energies are as follows: for P25 TiO2, the bandgap is 3.28 eV, for NSBT it is 3.25 eV, for ATN it is 3.23 eV, for SBAT-12 h it is 3.20 eV, and for SBAT-24 h, it is 3.18 eV. This indicates that the intrinsic absorption edge of the as-prepared samples with different reaction times (1–24 h) had an obvious redshift compared to P25 TiO2 and a sequential red shift of the absorption band edge from 3.25 to 3.18 eV occurs with increasing reaction time.



Fig. 8 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs based on NSBT, ATN, SBAT-12 h, SBAT-24 h and P25 TiO2 under simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). The surface area, dye-uptake density and solar cell parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1. It can be observed that the cell efficiency varied in the order: SBAT-24 h > SBAT-12 h > ATN > NSBT > P25 TiO2 as 7.17% > 6.66% > 6.08% > 5.52% > 5.36%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the Jsc was highest for SBAT-24 h with the lowest surface area of 11.1 m2 g−1 and a minimum for NSBT with the second highest surface area of 23.1 m2 g−1. The high surface area is desirable for considerable dye adsorption, which strongly affects the Jsc. However, in this case, the surface area may not have been a major factor in the amount of dye adsorbed. The increasing trend for Jsc is similar to that for dye-uptake density corresponding to dye molecules amount absorbed on the crystal surface per surface areas of the TiO2 crystal (mol m−2) and opposite to that for the surface areas, indicating the large percentage of exposed {010} facets, large particle size and unique self-branching nanostructures play key roles in the amount of dye adsorbed, resulting in the improvement of the Jsc. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. S3a, ESI) showing similar Type II curves with a Type H4 hysteresis loop were obtained for SBAT-12 h and SBAT-24 h, demonstrating the presence of mesoporous structures. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analyses (Fig. S3b, ESI) show that P25 TiO2 and self-branching TiO2 with reaction times of 12 and 24 h exhibited pore sizes of 85.0 and 3.5 nm, respectively. It is interesting to note that SBAT-12 h and SBAT-24 h with similar surface areas have the same pore sizes but different dye-uptake densities. This may be attributed to the variation in crystallinity caused by the difference in reaction time. Compared with P25 TiO2, the improvement in Voc for SBAT-12 h and SBAT-24 h can be explained as a consequence of effective charge transport of such one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and enhanced mass transport of the electrolyte ions in and out of the self-branching TiO2 due to the presence of the 3.5 nm pore size.

SBAT-24 h exhibits larger Jsc and η than that of the other samples, which can be ascribed to several factors. First, there is the trade-off effect of the decreased surface areas, the enhanced light scattering due to the large particle size, and the increased dye-uptake density resulting from the large percentage of exposed {010} facets having strong dye adsorption capacity and large particle size possessing good adsorption behavior. Second, the unique self-branching nanostructure built from 1D nanobranches growing epitaxially from the core rod can effectively minimize the grain interface effect and thus facilitate photogenerated electron transport.

In summary, SBAT with a large percentage of exposed {010} facets were synthesized by a facile, one-step hydrothermal reaction using TBAH as a capping and facet-controlling agent and F127 as a capping and shape-controlling agent. The reaction time and weight ratio of F127/TBAH played an important role in controlling the structure and morphology of the as-prepared TiO2. By increasing the reaction time from 10 min to 24 h, the formation of self-branching anatase TiO2 nanorods involved an evolution from 0D primary nanoparticles to 1D nanorods and eventually to 3D self-branching nanostructures by means of an oriented attachment complexed with crystal splitting of the anatase nanocrystals. The crystal facets (103) of anatase nanocrystals were found to be aligned with the (103) face on the tips of the main anatase TiO2 nanorods, leading to the formation of the 3D self-branching nanostructures. By increasing the weight ratio of F127/TBAH from 0.9 to 1.4, we observed the disappearance of the 3D self-branching anatase nanorods and the formation of the TiO2 with irregular shapes consisting of 47.8% anatase and 52.2% rutile.

The power conversion efficiency of the device based on the 3D SBAT could be up to 7.17%, superior to that of the devices based on the 1D anatase TiO2 nanorods and P25 TiO2. The improvement of the η cannot be explained by the high surface area because self-branching decreased the surface area. Such improvement could arising from the high dye-uptake density due to a large percentage of exposed {010} facets, high crystallinity and adequate pore size, as well as the enhanced light scattering due to the large particle size, and the unique self-branching nanostructure built from 1D nanobranches growing epitaxially from the core rod, which can effectively minimize the grain interface effect and thus facilitate photogenerated electron transport.
