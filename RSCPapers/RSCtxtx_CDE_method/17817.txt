The presence of defects formed during the growth and crystallization of perovskite films is a limiting factor to achieve high efficiency and stability in perovskite solar cells. Here, we present a robust route to passivate bulk and surface defects in perovskite films by using an amino-functionalized BODIPY fluorophore. The addition of amino-BODIPY into the prototype methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solution significantly altered the nanomorphology of the perovskite film and alleviated the defect formation leading to efficiency enhancement and prolonged stability of perovskite solar cells with a regular structure. Similar results were obtained when using the BODIPY fluorophore in chlorobenzene (CB)-based antisolvent treatment of spin-coated perovskite films in inverted perovskite solar cells. In addition, reduction in the electron extraction barrier was evidenced. Our approach represents a universal passivation methodology for boosting the efficiency and stability in both regular and inverted perovskite solar cells.

Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the best performing solar energy technologies, with the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction devices exceeding 25.5%. Organometal halide perovskites are low-cost solution processable materials with exceptional optoelectronic properties such as low exciton binding energies, low recombination rate, high charge carrier mobility and long carrier diffusion lengths, and an easily tunable bandgap, thus showing great promise for use in next generation photovoltaic devices. The fabrication of PSCs is also compatible with large-scale solution-based processing methods even on flexible substrates. A typical PSC architecture consists of multiple layers such as the light-absorber (i.e., perovskite), the hole and electron transport layer (HTL/ETL) and the metal contacts.

Despite the unambiguous role of the interlayers, the perovskite absorber itself holds the most crucial role in the device performance and stability. For instance, PSCs using polycrystalline films with a high amount of grain boundaries exhibit increased recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and inferior stability caused by mobile ions present in the perovskite film. Doping and additive engineering have emerged as easy methods to modulate the structural and morphological properties of the perovskite film, leading to stabilization of crystal structure, immobilization of ions in the perovskite lattice, and cross-linking of perovskite grains, thus resulting in the improvement of the device performance and stability. For example, long chain polymers containing S, N and O atoms are found to connect the material domains and form high quality films, while passivating the perovskite defects and trap states, leading to an improved charge transport and collection. Small organic dyes such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines derivatives have also been successfully used as additives as well as electron transport materials to enhance the performance of PSCs. Besides additive engineering, surface passivation approaches, such as antisolvent treatment, have been used to passivate dangling bonds and improve the perovskite quality.
BODIPY dyes, a class of fluorophores with very attractive characteristics such as ease of molecular engineering, electronic structure modification, tunable energetics, excellent thermal stability and photostability, and controllable photophysical and electrochemical properties, have never been applied either as surface modification agents or as additives in PSCs. To unravel their potential applicability in PSCs, we explore, in this work, an amino-functionalized BODIPY (BDP–NH2) dye as an additive and in antisolvent treatment of PSCs with the regular and inverted architecture, respectively. We based our selection on the excellent properties of the BODIPY segment and the well-known passivation capability of the amine group through coordination bonding between its nitrogen atoms and under-coordinated lead ions in the perovskite lattice. We show that BDP–NH2 passivates the perovskite film grain boundaries and enhances its crystallinity in both the regular and inverted PSCs. Reduced recombination losses and better film morphology and crystallinity synergistically lead to improved performance and environmental stability of the fabricated devices.

Tin oxide (SnO2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis [N,N-di (4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI ≥ 99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP 96.6%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, while FK209 (FK 209 Co(II) PF6) from Greatcell. Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) was purchased from Solaris (Mw = 20–70 kDa) and [6,6]-phenyl C70 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) from Solenne BV; bathocuproine (BCP) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The materials for the perovskite layer fabrication e.g. PbI2 and PbBr2 (99.99% purity) were bought from TCI, FAI and MABr were purchased from GreatCell Solar. CsI (99.999%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar and RbI (99.8%) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous ≥99.9%) and chlorobenzene (CB) 99.8% were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Toluene 99.7% and isopropanol (IPA) >99.8% were purchased from Honeywell Research Chemicals.


Indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass patterned substrates (ITO thickness of 100 nm and a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1, Ossila) were sequentially cleaned with soap water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol with ultrasonication for 10 minutes each. Afterwards, the substrates were transferred in a nitrogen filled glovebox and underwent a UV-ozone treatment for 15 minutes at 1.2 mW cm−2. SnO2 layers were developed by spinning a 1:5 diluted in water colloidal dispersion of tin(IV) oxide (15% in deionized water, Alfa Aesar) at 3000 rpm for 30 s followed by a thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. A methyl ammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or else MAPbI3) perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 0.4 g of PbI2 with 0.1379 g CH3NH3I in 0.62 mL dry DMSO. A 0.3% w/w of BDP–NH2 was added in the perovskite precursors to obtain the mixed MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 solution. All perovskite solutions were, next, placed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min, and then filtered through a PTFE filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm. Afterwards, the perovskite solutions were placed in a custom-made aluminum block and stirred at 300 rpm with a temperature of 70 °C. The prepared perovskite solutions were spin-coated on the SnO2 ETL at 2500 rpm for 10 s. Then, the samples were subjected to thermal annealing at 100 °C for 30 min (placed on a hot plate). Next, the hole transport layer was deposited on top of perovskite films. 86.6 mg of Spiro-MeOTAD was dissolved in 1 mL of CB and then 20 μL of Li-TFSI with concentration of 500 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile, 34 μL of TBP and 11 μL of FK209 with concentration of 300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile were added in the solution. The solution was filtered through a PTFE filter (pore size of 0.2 μm) and spin-coated on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form the doped Spiro-MeOTAD HTL. The samples were stored overnight in dry air to ensure the oxidization of the Spiro-MeOTAD layers. Finally, the devices were completed with the deposition of a 100 nm thick Ag top electrode through thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 10−6 mbar.


ITO/glass patterned substrates (purchased from Ossila) were cleaned as already reported. PTAA solution in toluene (Honeywell Research chemicals, ≥99.7%) with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 was spun at ITO substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. A (RbPbI3)0.04(CsPbI3)0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.91 perovskite solution, named hereafter as RbCsMAFA, was prepared by mixing MABr:FAI:PbBr2:PbI2 (0.2:1.14:0.2:1.24 M) in 4:1 v/v anhydrous DMF:DMSO. To this solution, 5 vol% of 1.5 M CsI solution and 4 vol% of 1.5 M RbI solution (both prepared in 4:1 vol/vol DMF:DMSO) were added. The perovskite layer was deposited by dynamically spinning the solution on the PTAA film at a speed of 6000 rpm for 45 s. 200 μL of antisolvent (anhydrous CB, 99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) with and without BDP–NH2 were dropped on the samples after 25 s of the start of spinning process. The as-processed perovskite film was immediately annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. The PC70BM (99%, Solenne) electron transport layer was formed by spinning a PC70BM solution (20 mg mL−1 in anhydrous CB), at 2000 rpm for 60 s and left to dry at room temperature for 30 minutes. On top of PC70BM layer, a thin buffer layer of bathocuproine (BCP, 0.5 mg mL−1, 96%, Sigma Aldrich) in IPA (99.5% extra dry, ACROS Organics) was spun at a speed of 4000 rpm for 45 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Ag top electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 10−6 mbar.


UV-Vis absorption and transmittance measurements of different perovskite films were performed using a PerkinElmer Lambda 40 spectrometer. SEM images (top-view and cross-section) of the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 films were recorded with a JSM-7610F-Schottky Field Emission ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscope (JEOL). The crystalline structure of both MAPbI3 and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 films was studied using an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens D-500 606). Raman spectra of perovskite samples with or without BDP–NH2 were measured by a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer with a 785 nm excitation laser at room temperature and in ambient air. For the stability study, the samples were kept in a dark place under high vacuum (9.6 × 10−5 Pa) and Raman spectra were measured every week for a period of three weeks. Each measurement lasted 50 s using a 50× objective, resulting in a narrow line width on the sample. The samples topography was evaluated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), with the use of an XE7 AFM (Park Systems) operating in tapping mode. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) and Transient PL measurements were performed on a FS5 Spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments) with a 478.4 nm laser used as an excitation source. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under standard simulated AM1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a Solar Cell I–V Test System from Ossila. The device active area of around 0.04 cm2 was defined using a black metallic aperture mask. The optoelectrical characterizations were performed using the commercially available measurement platform, ARKEO (Cicci Research s.r.l.). Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed in small perturbation mode. We limited the intensity of light pulse to less than 10% of the background in order to not alter the equilibrium of charge carriers in the device. The devices were connected to a 1 MΩ resistor for TPV measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed using the AlKα line at 1486.6 eV (12 kV with 20 mA anode current, not monochromized) with an analyser (Leybold EA-11) pass energy of 100 eV, giving a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.5 eV for the Au 4f7/2 peak. Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) used the He I excitation line (21.2 eV) with a negative bias of 12.22 V applied to the specimen in order to separate the high binding energy cut-off from the analyser. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements were performed with a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. Ambient photoemission spectroscopy (APS) was conducted with an APS04 N2-RH system (KP Technology). Contact potential difference (CPD) was measured by the vibrating gold alloy Kelvin probe (2 mm). Absolute WF of the tip estimated to be around 4.54–4.6 eV, which was calibrated by measuring a silver reference and calculating its absolute WF by APS.



Fig. 1a shows the frontier molecular orbitals (highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) of the amino-functionalized dye as calculated with density functional theory (DFT). It is observed that the HOMO (H) and LUMO (L) levels reside on the BDP segment, while the HOMO−1 (H−1) and LUMO+1 (L+1) orbitals are localized on the NH2 group. Additionally, DFT calculations revealed the optimal geometry of the dye with the vertical orientation of the two units, as well as, large molecular dipole moment of 6.3712 Debye (Fig. 1b). The BODIPY (BDP) unit bears an amine (NH2) group, as presented in Fig. 1c. Amines have shown to enable strong coordination with undercoordinated lead (Pb2+) cations in the perovskite film, which motivated us to use this fluorophore as a passivation agent. Moreover, a large molecular dipole moment of the passivation agent has been recently shown to simultaneously allow defect passivation and reduced energy difference between the perovskite and the HTL. In particular, it was demonstrated that a dipole layer formed by silane molecules decreased the perovskite work-function (WF), imparting an ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. As our BODIPY combines a high molecular dipole moment along with the presence of –NH2 in its structure, we expect that it will serve as affective passivation agent when inserted as additive (through the amine-Pb2+ coordination) in the bulk and as surface layer on top of the perovskite film.

We, therefore, introduced the BDP–NH2 as an additive into the perovskite solution and investigated its influence on the PSCs performance. In particular, an optimized 0.3% w/w concentration of the dye was added in the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor as described in the experimental section. Fig. 2a illustrates the regular PSC architecture ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3:BDP–NH2/Spiro-MeOTAD/Ag. A reference cell based on the pristine perovskite layer was also fabricated for comparison. Fig. 2b presents the corresponding energy levels of the materials used in the device architecture (considering vacuum level alignment before contact). The WF of the electrodes and the energy levels of the SnO2, MAPbI3, and Spiro-MeOTAD were taken from the literature. The HOMO and LUMO levels of BDP–NH2 were estimated to be −4.94 eV and −2.79 eV, respectively, by cyclic voltammetry measurements reported previously, and UV-vis absorption measurements (Fig. S1, ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs based on the BODIPY additive engineered perovskite absorber are shown in Fig. 2c and the extracted performance parameters of the champion cells along with mean values and statistics extracted from a batch of 25 identical devices of each type are summarized in Table 1. A 10% improvement in the PSCs performance is noted when the dye BDP–NH2 is added in the perovskite absorber. In particular, the reference cell without the dye showed a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.40 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 15.65% (mean value of 14.98%). In the case of PSCs based on MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 layer, higher PCE was achieved (champion 17.28%, mean value of 16.54%) attributed mainly to the significant enhancement in the JSC (JSC of 20.94 mA cm−2). Also, the VOC and FF of the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2–based device exhibited a slight improvement compared with the reference one (VOC of 1.10 V and FF of 0.75). Reduced series resistance (RS) was also estimated (from 4.1 Ω cm2 for the reference cell to 3.6 Ω cm2 for the device with the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 absorber) as expected by the significant increase in the JSC and the slightly enhanced FF.

In order to validate the increase in the JSC, incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE) measurements of the reference and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2–based PSCs are presented in Fig. 2d, showing slightly improved IPCE values for the doped device with respect to the reference one. These results indicate that the PSC with the BDP–NH2–doped perovskite absorber exhibited stronger photoresponse demonstrating higher PCE and JSC values than the reference cell. The unencapsulated BODIPY additive engineered devices also exhibited improved environmental stability compared to the reference ones when exposed to ambient for 20 days (Fig. 2e and f). The reference PSCs showed faster decrease in performance that can be attributed to the degradation of the MAPbI3 film. Raman spectra of fresh and aged MAPbI3 and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 presented in Fig. S2a and b show a larger decrease of the main peak at ∼130 cm−1, which is ascribed to methyl ammonium (MA) cations, for the pristine perovskite suggesting that MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 film is more stable in environmental conditions, in agreement with the device measurements. UV-vis absorption measurements also revealed similar results. Fig. S2c and d show the absorption spectra of fresh and aged (that were left in the laboratory environment −20 °C temperature, 40% relative humidity-for 20 days) MAPbI3 and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 films of the same thickness deposited on SnO2/FTO substrates. It is seen that the absorption spectrum of the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 film remained unaffected after 20 days; however, the spectrum of the pristine perovskite underwent significant changes upon aging. Photographs of aged samples are shown as insets in Fig. S2c and d supporting a profound degradation of the pristine perovskite film, which exhibited a yellow color suggesting hydrolysis of the perovskite crystal films. On the contrary, the color of MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 film remained dark after 20 days of exposure to ambient conditions.
To shed light on the enhancement in efficiency and boost in stability of the BODIPY engineered device, we next investigated the morphology of pristine and BDP–NH2–doped MAPbI3 films using SEM. Top-view SEM images of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 films deposited on ITO/SnO2 substrates as well as cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding solar cells are presented in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. It is observed that the addition of BDP–NH2 into the perovskite precursor results in the formation of larger grains and a subsequent decrease in the amount of grain boundaries in the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 sample, indicating the beneficial role of the dye on the growth of the perovskite. The improved morphology along with the reduction of the grain boundaries of the additive engineered perovskite film is due to effective coordination of –NH2 into the perovskite lattice as evidenced by the FT-IR spectra of MAPbI3, BDP–NH2 and MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 films shown in Fig. 3c. In the FT-IR spectrum of MAPbI3, all observed peaks correspond to vibrations of the MA (CH3NH3+) moiety. More specifically, there is a wide band centered around 3150 cm−1, which can be attributed to a combination of N–H stretching and C–H stretching. The peaks corresponding to the NH3+ group are found at 1578 cm−1 (NH3 bending), 1248 cm−1 and 960 cm−1 (NH3 rocking). For the –CH3 group, there are peaks observed at 1468 cm−1 (C–H scissoring) and 910 cm−1 (CH3 rocking). Another peak can be found at 1105 cm−1, corresponding to C–N stretching. For the BDP–NH2 molecule, the peaks corresponding to its primary amine group are located at 3460 cm−1 and 3380 cm−1 (N–H stretching), 1624 cm−1 (N–H bending) and 835 cm−1 (N–H wagging). Some weak signals corresponding to C–H stretching are observed around 3000 cm−1. Moreover, the pattern of BODIPY structure is found in the area 1550–900 cm−1, in the fingerprint region, where vibration modes such as aromatic ring stretching are included. In the spectrum of MAPbI3/BDP–NH2, the most prominent peaks are similar to the spectrum of the pure perovskite. The BODIPY pattern of peaks cannot be observed in this spectrum. However, it is important to mention that C–H stretching peaks are located around 3000 cm−1, which can correspond to a –CH3 group. The peak corresponding to C–N stretching at 1105 cm−1 seems to have disappeared or decreased in intensity. The –NH2 stretching mode peaks of BDP–NH2 also cannot be observed, like other BDP–NH2 peaks. The peak of the wagging mode of the –NH2 group of BDP–NH2 has shifted to higher wavenumbers and become slightly wider (NH2 wagging from 835 cm−1 to 740 cm−1). From those observations, it can be deduced that the C–N bond of methyl ammonium has been significantly elongated. This elongation, combined with the red shift of the NH2 wagging peak can be attributed to hydrogen bonding between the ammonium and the amine groups. No shifting of the ammonium group peaks is observed in the spectrum because of its excess in the solution. This speculation could also justify the inability to observe the –NH2 stretching peaks in the 3400–3300 cm−1 region, since it is possible that they have been incorporated in the wide peak at around 3200 cm−1.
We further investigated the role of BDP–NH2 on the crystallinity of the perovskite film using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 3d shows the diffraction patterns of the pristine and BODIPY engineered perovskite films (referred as fresh samples) coated on SnO2 substrates. All XRD peaks can be assigned to the MAPbI3 exhibiting good film crystallinity, while the peak at ∼12.7°, which is more pronounced in the pristine MAPbI3 film, is ascribed to the PbI2. Moreover, a small shift towards higher angles is observed in the XRD pattern of the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 sample in comparison with that of the pristine perovskite film. For example, the peaks at 14.12°, 28.47°, and 31.89° assigned to the (110), (220), and (310) plane, respectively, for the MAPbI3 film shift to 14.19°, 28.50°, and 31.95° for the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 sample (Fig. S3), suggesting some degree of coordination bonding between the perovskite matrix and amino-functionalized BODIPY.
The improved crystallinity of the BODIPY engineered sample was further indicated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS, with X-ray incident angle of 0.1 degrees for surface investigation) measurements (Fig. 4a and b). It is observed that the BDP–NH2–doped MAPbI3 film exhibits a stronger crystalline nature with several intense peaks between 1.0 A−1 and 2.0 A−1. In particular, the increased peak intensity of scattering ring at 1.0 A−1, which is assigned to the (110) plane of the perovskite structure, reveals a preferential orientation of MAPbI3, when the dye added into the precursor solution. Similar results were also extracted from the 2D-GIWAXS patterns with X-ray incident angle of 0.3 degrees for bulk investigation shown in Fig. 4c and d for the pristine and BDP–NH2–doped MAPbI3 films, respectively, implying that the introduction of the BDP–NH2 in the perovskite solution was beneficial to both surface and bulk crystallinity of the MAPbI3:BDP–NH2 film. Moreover, the comparison between the XRD patterns of fresh and aged MAPbI3 films without and with the BODIPY additive (Fig. 3d and S4) indicated easier penetration of moisture into the reference sample as witnessed by the pronounced increase in the intensity of the PbI2 peak at 12.7° upon aging of the pristine sample. BDP–NH2–doped MAPbI3 showed a slower degradation as also evidenced by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of fresh and aged samples of both perovskite types (Fig. S5). Notably, the synergistic effect of better crystallinity and nanomorphology of the BODIPY embedding film resulted in better stability of these samples when exposed to real world conditions for a period of 3 weeks (Fig. S6).
To further explore the capability of BDP–NH2 to passivate surface defects, we next tested diluted solutions of BDP–NH2 (in CB) with different concentrations as antisolvent treatment prior to the crystallization of the perovskite layer via thermal annealing. We verified the BDP–NH2 incorporation into the antisolvent with a UV-vis absorption spectrum taken in a 0.1 mg mL−1 BDP–NH2 in CB, where the characteristic absorption peak of the dye is evident (Fig. S7). The detailed procedure of the antisolvent treatment is described in Experimental section, while the device structure of the prepared PSCs based on the quadruple cation RbCsMAFA perovskite layer with the inverted architecture ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag is shown in Fig. 5a. Note that, inverted PSCs with pure CB as antisolvent (without BDP–NH2) were fabricated to serve as a reference for comparison reasons. J–V characteristics of the fabricated PSCs with pristine and BDP–NH2–treated RbCsMAFA layers are presented in Fig. 5b. The reference device exhibited a JSC of 19.09 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.09 V, a FF of 0.75, and a corresponding PCE value of 15.61% (Table 2). On the other hand, our champion device based on the BDP–NH2–treatment with concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 in CB showed improved electrical parameter values with JSC of 19.26 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.1 V, and FF of 0.76, resulting in a PCE of 16.10%. This enhancement in the device performance may be attributed to the improved crystallinity of the BDP–NH2–treated perovskite layer. However, the lower concentration of the BDP–NH2 antisolvent of 0.05 mg mL−1 seems to be unfavorable for the PSC performance exhibiting a PCE of 14.95% (JSC of 19.14 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.10 V, and FF of 0.71). PSCs based on the BDP–NH2–treated RbCsMAFA layer with an antisolvent concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1 also showed lower PCE than that of the reference device, which may be attributed to the increased surface roughness of the perovskite film hindering the charge extraction for the absorber to the selective electrode. The unfavorable charge extraction is also evident by the decrease in the FF from the 0.75 of the reference PSC to 0.71 and 0.74 for the devices with the BDP–NH2 0.05 mg mL−1 and BDP–NH2 0.2 mg mL−1, respectively, as well as the increase in the RS (from 5.6 Ω cm2 for the PSC w/o the BDP–NH2 to 8.3 Ω cm2 and 6.1 Ω cm2 for the devices based on the BDP–NH2 antisolvent with the concentrations 0.05 mg mL−1 and 0.2 mg mL−1, respectively). In addition, the significant improvement in the shunt resistance of the champion device with the BDP–NH2 0.1 mg mL−1 supports the argument of enhanced electron transport at the BDP–NH2–treated perovskite/PCBM interface. Focused on the BDP–NH2 0.1 mg mL−1 treatment, IPCE measurements were performed and the corresponding spectra are presented in Fig. 5c. Higher IPCE value and integrated photocurrent density, also shown in Fig. 5c, of the BDP–NH2–treated device compared with the reference PSC are observed, which are in good agreement with the measured JSC. Moreover, the identical UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite film without and with the BDP–NH2 treatment (Fig. S8) suggest that the dye does not induce the increase of photons absorption. Therefore, we can conclude that the higher photocurrent of the PSC with the BDP–NH2 treatment could be attributed to the enhanced electron extraction due to the better passivation of the perovskite's surface compared with the device treated with the pure antisolvent.

We identified the presence of BODIPY on the surface of treated perovskite using XPS measurements (Fig. 6a–g). Besides the characteristic perovskite XPS peaks, the presence of F 1s core level peaks in the spectrum of the treated sample clearly indicates the BDP–NH2 surface coordination. Moreover, we performed contact potential difference (CPD) and ambient photoemission spectroscopy (APS) measurements (Fig. 6h and i, respectively) for the estimation of the surface WF and valence band onset of pristine and BDP–NH2 treated sample. A reduction in the WF and downward shift in the valence band onset for the BODIPY treated sample are concluded which are in accordance to the –NH2 coordination on the perovskite surface (so as the molecular dipole moment vector points towards the perovskite). A downward shift of the valence band maximum also indicates a similar shift towards higher energies (with respect to the vacuum) of the conduction band minimum of the perovskite upon BODIPY antisolvent treatment. Since the energy gap value for the pristine and BODIPY sample are identical (Fig. S8) we conclude that the conduction band extremum of the treated perovskite shifts towards the lowest unoccupied molecular (LUMO) orbital of the PCBM (Fig. S9) hence reducing the electron extraction barrier. In addition, a surface passivation effect of BODIPY was evident by transient photovoltage measurements (TPV, Fig. 5d).
Moreover, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and transient photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively, demonstrate an increase in the PL intensity and a higher carrier lifetime, respectively, for the BDP–NH2 antisolvent treated film. Since both the reference and the BODIPY samples are deposited on the same non-quenching glass substrate and exhibit the same thickness, a significant increase in the PL intensity suggests a higher radiative recombination (a reduced trap-assisted non-radiative recombination) in the BDP–NH2 film. The improved PL properties of the BDP–NH2 treated film can also be due to its smoother surface morphology, which can improve interfacial contact between the perovskite and the underneath layer and reduce defects at the interface. The improvement in surface morphology is evident from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographies presented in Fig. 7c and d for the perovskite films without and with the dye treatment, respectively. AFM images show a lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 20.46 nm for the BDP–NH2–treated RbCsMAFA film than that treated with pristine antisolvent (RMS of 23.37 nm). The smoother and passivated surface of the perovskite film along with a reduction in the electron extraction barrier upon the BDP–NH2 antisolvent treatment facilitates electron transport thus improving the overall device performance.

In summary, we demonstrate the effective passivation of defects in the perovskite absorber using the dye BDP–NH2 as an additive and in antisolvent treatment. The addition of the dye into the perovskite solution improved the nanomorphology and crystallinity of the perovskite layer which exhibited a homogeneous film formation with larger grains and a subsequent decrease in the amount of grain boundaries. Consequently, the corresponding MAPbI3-based PSCs showed enhanced efficiency and stability both originating from the decreased amount of grain boundaries in the absorber layer. BDP–NH2 was also used in antisolvent treatment in inverted PSCs. A decreased charge recombination rate, along with increased charge carrier lifetime were reported, which is assigned to the smoother and passivated surface of the RbCsMAFA treated with the BDP–NH2 antisolvent. In addition, BODIPY antisolvent treatment attained a reduction in the electron extraction barrier through the alignment of the compound molecular dipole moment. Our findings pave the way for further exploration of the fascinating BODIPY family as key device components in solar cells and related technologies.
