The development of high-performance n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors lags far behind that of p-type counterparts due to a paucity of strongly electron-deficient building blocks. Nevertheless, n-type semiconductors are essential for constructing complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-like logic circuits and p–n junction devices. Among various electron-deficient building blocks, cyano-functionalized (hetero)arenes are emerging ones to enable high-performance n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in cyano-functionalized building blocks, including cyano-functionalized indenofluorene, cyano-functionalized imide-based (hetero)arenes, cyano-functionalized benzothiadiazole, and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile. Additionally, (hetero)arenes end-capped with dicyanomethylene are also elaborated. Based on these cyano-functionalized building blocks, a great number of n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors are developed, showing much suppressed frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) compared to their non-cyanated analogues. Thus, very promising device performance in various n-type organic electronic devices, including organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), is obtained. These results demonstrate that cyano functionalization is a powerful strategy for developing organic and polymeric semiconductors with deep-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) for n-type organic electronics. Finally, we offer our insights into the future development of cyano-functionalized n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors.

Organic and polymeric semiconductors have gained widespread attention owing to their unique advantages of being lightweight, excellent mechanical trait and solution processability, which has led to various applications in organic electronic devices, such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), and organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Organic and polymeric semiconductors can be divided into p-type and n-type ones based on the charge carrier polarity. Over the past few decades, p-type organic semiconductors have achieved great success in terms of material diversity and device performance. In contrast, the development of n-type semiconductors has lagged far behind that of p-type analogues, which is primarily due to the scarcity of building blocks with strong electron deficiency, excellent solubility, high backbone planarity, and small steric hindrance. As shown in Fig. 1a, if a building block imposes a small steric hindrance on the neighboring (hetero)arenes, it can lead to a low torsion angle (typically close to 0°) between two consecutive (hetero)arenes and the resultant semiconductors should have a planar backbone. A sizable steric hindrance will result in a large torsion angle (beyond 30°) and a high degree of backbone distortion for the resulting semiconductors, which may be detrimental to charge transport. For example, Marks et al. reported a series of naphthalene imide/amide-based polymer semiconductors. From single-crystal results, it was found that the dihedral angles between core NBL-4,8 and both neighboring thiophenes were 75.4° and 44.0° in NBL-4,8-T2, but the isomeric NBL-3,8-T2 showed two smaller dihedral angles of 52.7° and 7.9° between NBL-3,8 and two thiophenes. NBL-3,8-T2 was packed in a slipped face-to-face “brick-like” fashion while NBL-4,8-T2 was packed in a herringbone mode. And NBL-3,8-T2 displayed a shorter packing distance of 3.33 Å than that (3.55 Å) of NBL-4,8-T2. As expected, the resulting polymer PNBL-3,8-T2 with good backbone coplanarity showed an OTFT electron mobility of 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼5 times higher than that of NBL-4,8-T2. Interestingly, NBA-3,7-T2 exhibited much larger dihedral angles than those of isomeric NBA-2,6-T2, while NBA-3,7-T2 showed a smaller staking distance as compared to NBA-2,6-T2. PNBA-2,6-T2 achieved a high electron mobility of 0.025 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas PNBA-3,7-T2 is inactive. After annealing at 200 °C, the electron mobility of PNBA-2,6-T2 was improved to 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is obvious that, in addition to backbone coplanarity, there are many other aspects having an effect on mobility, such as the geometry, solution-processing method, and film packing orientation and crystalline size. Therefore, the compact topology to reduce steric hindrance is an essential trait to design new electron-deficient building blocks for n-type semiconductors. However, it is not easy to accomplish high electron deficiency and compact topology in one block simultaneously. In order to attain such building blocks, multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups are introduced on the building block. Such electron-withdrawing groups show limited solubilizing capability (such as a cyano group) and/or impose substantial steric hindrance on the neighboring (hetero)arenes (such as an imide group). Moreover, due to the high electron-deficiency and/or the sizable steric hindrance, it is also very challenging to synthesize these building blocks. As a result, the scarcity of such highly electron-deficient building blocks greatly limited the development of high-performance n-type semiconductors. For example, many p-type semiconductors with hole mobilities (μhs) exceeding 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been reported, such as PCDTPT (23.7 cm2 V−1 s−1), PDPPMT-2T (12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and pDPP4T-3 (13.1 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas most of the high-performance n-type organic semiconductors, particularly n-type polymers, exhibit low electron mobilities (μes) of 0.1–1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Nonetheless, high-performance n-type semiconductors are essential to p–n junction-based devices and complementary logic circuits.

To realize n-type performance, low-lying frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are of necessitation for organic and polymeric semiconductors. The low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are beneficial for the electron injection and stabilization of charge carriers in organic electronic devices. For example, in OFETs, high-lying LUMOs lead to substantial electron injection barriers from the Au electrode to a semiconductor layer because of the low work function of Au (−5.1 eV). In addition, the LUMO dominates the stability of charge carriers, i.e. electrons, since organic anions generated in n-type materials with high-lying LUMOs tend to react with water and oxygen. As discussed in the paper of de Leeuw et al., the redox potential for water reduction, at a pH of 7 and an overpotential of 0 V, amounts to −0.658 V (vs. SCE) (eqn (1). This potential can be translated to an electron affinity of approximately −3.7 eV, suggesting that a semiconductor with a LUMO of < −3.7 eV is expected to be stable with respect to H2O reduction.

2H2O + 2e− ⇆ H2 + 2OH−

E = −0.244 − 0.05912 × PH = −0.658

The corresponding redox potential of oxygen reduction is estimated to be 0.571 V (vs. SCE) according to eqn (2). However, there are rare semiconductors that have such large electron affinities. Taking into account an overpotential of 0.5–1 V to the reaction between the charge carriers and O2, a semiconductor with a LUMO of below −4.0 eV is expected to be stable with respect to O2 oxidation. Note that the magnitude of the excess voltage would also rely on the semiconductor and the device configuration in which it is used.
O2 + 4H− + 4e− ⇄ 2H2O
O2 + 2H2O + 4e− ⇆ 4OH−

E = 0.985 − 0.05912 × PH = 0.571

The imide group is the first and also most widely used group due to its outstanding electron-withdrawing properties and excellent solubilizing capacity, exemplified by naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI), which have advanced n-type semiconductors in the last two decades. However, phenyl-based NDI and PDI often impose a substantial steric hindrance on the neighbouring (hetero)arenes and therefore lead to a high degree of backbone distortion in the resulting polymers. Thus, other strong electron-withdrawing groups or functionalities, i.e. amide, a boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B ← N), and cyano, are utilized to functionalize π-conjugated backbones to lower the LUMO levels of semiconductors and build n-type semiconductors. Among various electron-withdrawing groups, the cyano group can yield greatly suppressed FMO levels due to its stronger electron-withdrawing properties compared to halogen, carbonyl, B ← N, and trifluoromethyl groups. The first reported cyano-functionalized organic semiconductor for n-type OTFTs can date back to cyanated perylenes S16. The cyano functionalization led to the resultant semiconductors with a lower-lying FMO, thus yielding a higher electron mobility of 0.64 cm2 V−1 s−1 and improved air-stability as compared to the non-cyanated analogue. Based on this pioneering work, a great number of cyano-functionalized n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors have been devised and synthesized continually. To date, most of the reviews have been dedicated to n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors based on electron-deficient building blocks, including amide-functionalized (hetero)arenes, imide-functionalized (hetero)arenes, and boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B ← N)- based (hetero)arenes. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there is no review targeting on the cyano-functionalized building blocks for high-performance n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors. In this review, we first summarize the recent progress of electron-transporting organic and polymeric semiconductors based on the key cyano group utilized for the design of electron-deficient building blocks, specifically FCN, ICN, CNBT, INCN, and QCN (Fig. 1b). The representative semiconductors built from these cyano-functionalized building blocks are illustrated in Fig. 1c. Based on these building blocks, a large number of organic and polymeric semiconductors have been developed, and applied in various n-type organic devices, including OTFTs, OSCs, and OTEs. The relationships between the chemical structure, property, and device performance are established accordingly, which provides important guideline for further constructing property-optimized n-type organic and polymer semiconductors. Finally, we offer our insights into the future development of cyano functionalized building blocks and their semiconductors.

In this section, we present a brief view of the basic device structures applied in this work (Fig. 1d). The definition of critical performance parameters and elementary equations used for calculating them from the experimental data are also given below. First, a typical OTFT device comprises three electrodes (source, drain, and gate), a dielectric layer, and a semiconductor layer. The left of Fig. 1d shows the representative bottom-gate top-contact device architecture. When a gate potential is applied, the semiconductor layer is induced with a charge, and the device turns on. Three key OTFT performance parameters include the charge carrier mobility (μ), current modulation ratio (Ion/Ioff) and threshold voltage (Vth). μ and Vth in the saturation region can be defined by the equation: ID = μWCi(Vg − Vth)2/2L, where ID is the drain current, W is the channel width, μ is the mobility in the saturation regime, Ci is the gate capacitance per unit area, L is the channel length, Vg is the gate voltage, and Vth is the threshold voltage.

Second, the widely used bulk-heterojunction OSC composed of a photoactive layer (donor/acceptor blend) is sandwiched between an anode (typically modified by a hole-transporting layer) and a cathode (typically modified by an electron-transporting layer), as shown in the center of Fig. 1d. When exposed to light irradiation, the photoactive layer absorbs photons and produces excitons, which diffuse toward the donor/acceptor interface of the blend and subsequently segregate holes and electrons. The separated electrons/holes transport in the separate donor/acceptor domains and are eventually collected by the cathode and anode, respectively. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the highly important parameter and can be described by the formula: PCE = VOC, JSC FF/Pin, where VOC, JSC, FF, and Pin are defined by the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current, the fill factor, and the light intensity power incident on the device, respectively. Finally, an OTE device consists of two semiconductors (p-type and n-type ones) and two metal plates. Upon applying distinct temperatures, the electrons/holes accumulate at both cold sides (the right of Fig. 1d), which would form an electrical current via a temperature gradient. The key OTE performance is usually evaluated by dimensionless ZT, given by the formula: ZT = S2σT/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal conductivity. Due to the low κ of the organic semiconductor, the power factor (PF) is generally utilized to benchmark the thermoelectric efficiency based on the formula: PF = S2σ.

Indenofluorene has been proved as a promising building block for developing high-performance p-type or bipolar semiconductors, such as dihydroindenofluorene, dihydroindacenodithiophene, and cyclopentadithiophene, due to its planar backbone and suitable FMOs. A stronger electron-deficient building block 2,2′-(indeno[1,2-b]fluorene-6,12-diylidene)dimalononitrile S1 was prepared by attaching additional cyano groups to indenofluorene. S1 shows a suppressed LUMO of −4.30 eV, much lower than the non-cyanated parent (−3.67 eV). In order to facilitate solution processability, Usta and co-workers reported two semiconductors, S2 and S3, by means of introducing different lengths of side-chains (Fig. 2). The longer side-chains lead to the resulting S3 with good solubility in common organic solvents, while S2 with short chains showed limited, preventing its characterization. Thus, S3 OTFTs exhibited a high μe of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 via low-temperature annealing to improve film crystallinity (Table 3). Trialkylsilyl side-chains were incorporated into S4 (Fig. 2) by Usta and co-workers, and the resulting OTFT exhibited a low μe of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to S4 having a large π–π stacking distance.

On the basis of S1, Marks and co-workers synthesized a new organic semiconductor S5 by extending the conjugation length (Fig. 2), which showed an increased LUMO of −4.15 eV. S5 OTFTs exhibited an impressive μe of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1. Covalently connecting S5 with electron-rich bithiophene yields a donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer P1. It had a band gap of 1.39 eV and a LUMO/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −4.32/−5.51 eV. Surprisingly, P1 exhibited ambipolar transport characteristics with a comparable μe and a hole mobility (μh) of ∼2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is due to of the fact that its HOMO (−5.51 eV) is accessible for hole injection by Au contacts. Yamashita et al. utilized pyrazine to modify the indacenodithiophene backbone and thus synthesized two semiconductors S6 and S7 (Fig. 2) with different side-chains. S6 was insoluble in common solvents due to it having linear n-hexyl side-chains, which prevented its characterization. In contrast, S7 had branched t-butyl side-chains and exhibited a LUMO of −4.1 eV measured by cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly, S6 OTFTs exhibits a much higher μe of 0.011 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of S7 (1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) by vapor deposition, which is attributed to the high crystallinity of S6.
Poriel and Geng et al. developed an indacenodithiophene-based semiconductor S8 and its isomer S9 (Fig. 2) by replacing marginal benzene with thiophene in S1. The axisymmetric S9 shows a lower HOMO (−5.80 eV) than the centrosymmetric S8 (−5.64 eV), but both LUMOs are comparable. When deposited on glass or flexible substrates (PEN), S8-based OTFTs exhibited higher μes (1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for glass and 3.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PEN) in comparison to S9 (7.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for glass and 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PEN). The enhanced S8 μe is associated with its denser packing. Poriel et al. also prepared two ihydroindacenodithiophene isomers, i.e. para-indacenodithiophene (IDT)-core S10 and meta-IDT-core S11, functionalizing with two N-cyanoimine groups. Two semiconductors exhibited deep-lying LUMOs. By modifying the OTFTs with 4-dimethylaminobenzenethiol (DABT), the μe of S10 was calculated to be 4.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at 80 °C. In contract, S11 exhibited a low μe (3.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the features of more ordered molecular organization than the meta isomer (Table 3). Based on S8, Geng et al. reported an alternating polymer P2 (Fig. 2) by introducing diketopyrrolopyrrole as co-units. Due to its high-lying LUMO and unfavorable intermolecular packing, P2 exhibited ambipolarity with a low μe/μh of 1.2 × 10−4/0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fluorine atoms were next inserted into S8 to afford S12. In comparison to S8, S12 having fluorine on the core showed improved solubility, effectively stabilizing and a deep-lying LUMO of −4.24 eV. S12 OTFTs exhibited an enhanced μe of 0.49 cm2 V−1 s−1 along with good retention of performance under ambient conditions employing blade coating, as compared to the fluorine-free analogue S6. Chi et al. further substituted the center benzene of indacenodithiophene with thienothiophene and attached alkyl groups onto the terminal of the thiophene ring to afford two semiconductors S13 and S14 (Fig. 2). Due to the low-lying LUMOs, both semiconductors exhibited predominant n-channel characteristics with the highest μe of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 enabled by S13-based OTFTs.

Imide functionalized arenes, such as NDI and PDI, have been successfully used to construct n-type semiconductors with high performance. Active positions, such as the bay position on PDI, provide a good chance to structural modifications for finely tuning FMOs and the packing model of semiconductors. Wasielewski et al. first reported two core-cyanated PDI derivatives, i.e. S15 and S16 (Fig. 3). Cyano incorporation leads to suppressed LUMOs compared to PDI. S16 delivered an OTFT μe of 0.64 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that (0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) of S15. Furthermore, S16 OTFTs showed better stability than S15, mainly attributed to forming the kinetic barrier to oxidation provided by perfluorobutyl chains.

Based on NDI, Wasielewski et al. synthesized two cyanated NDI derivatives, S17 and S18 (Fig. 3), by incorporating different numbers of cyano groups into the naphthalene core. The electrochemical reduction potential of S18 with two cyano groups versus the saturated calomel electrode in dichloromethane was −0.22 V, lower than that (−0.08 V) of S17 bearing one cyano group. S17 and S18 OTFTs exhibited average μe of 4.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a vacuum, respectively (Table 3). Under ambient atmosphere, the μe value of S18 was decreased to 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, S17 OTFTs showed rapid performance degradation when exposed in air caused by its high reduction potential. Moreover, the flexible OTFTs fabricated from S18 exhibited a μe of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 in ambient atmosphere.
Inspired by this promising work, a series of D–A polymers, P3, P4, P5, and P6 (Fig. 3), were synthesized by polycondensation between cyano functionalized NDI and electron-donating co-units, all of which showed very deep-lying LUMOs in the range of −4.39 to −4.46 eV. Among them, P4 OTFTs showed the highest μe of 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, after thermal annealing at 240 °C.
Zhu et al. utilized the electron-deficient blocks, such as dicyanomethylenes, to cap the merge of sulfur heterocyles or thiophenes in NDI derivatives, affording a series of n-type semiconductors S19–S23 (Fig. 3). All semiconductors show low-lying LUMOs (< −4.2 eV) with energy values (eV) in the following order: −4.63 eV for S22 < −4.30 eV for S19 and S20 < −4.28 eV for S23 < −4.23 eV for S21 (Table 3). The as-spun (unannealed) S19- and S20-based OTFTs exhibited a relatively low μes (∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). After thermal annealing, S20 OTFTs exhibit a significant improvement (μe = 0.51 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to S19 (μe = 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is originated from most enhanced lamellar ordering of the thin film and the increased grain size in the annealed S20 film. But both S17 and S18 OTFTs showed excellent air stability during the cycle test as a result of the combination of low-lying LUMOs and good crystallinity for two polymers. However, S21, S22 and S23 exhibited inferior device performance, with maximum μes of 4 × 10−3, 1.2 × 10−3 and 0.016 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which is attributed to the unfavorable polymer packings.
In addition to PDI and NDI, benzene-based anthracenedicarboximides and pyrene-1,2,6,7-tetracarboxylic diimides were also functionalized with cyano groups to afford S24 and S25, respectively. S24 OTFTs achieved μes of 0.02 and 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 when worked under ambient and vacuum conditions, respectively. The LUMO of S25 was estimated to be −3.84 eV, meaning a promising building block for n-type semiconductors (Fig. 3). 1,1′-Biphenyl-2,2′-dicarboximide (BPI) is also an imide-functionalized building block that has been used to create organic semiconductors. Based on this, imide-functionalized fluorenone (FOI) and its cyanated derivative (FCNI) were developed by our group. The theoretical calculation demonstrates FCNI having a lower LUMO than FOI, NDI and PDI. By incorporating the donor co-units, two polymers P7 and P8 (Fig. 3) were synthesized via microwave-assisted Stille coupling. Both P7 and P8 presented low-lying LUMOs of ∼−4.0 eV (Table 3). After annealing at 160 °C, P7 and P8 OTFTs exhibited low μes of 0.035 and 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, in good accordance with their low film crystallinity.
Marks et al. first synthesized thiophene-based bithiophene imide (BTI) with seven-membered imide rings. Enlightened by this pioneering work, Marks and Guo developed a variety of BTI-based polymers with promising performance in OTFTs and OSCs. However, these polymers had relatively high-lying LUMOs and mainly showed p-type charge transport characteristics due to the electron-rich bithiophene backbone. To lower the LUMOs, thiazole substitution and fluorination were introduced, resulting in the resultant semiconductors with LUMOs suppressed down to −3.9 eV. To further lower the LUMOs, we reported three novel building blocks, i.e. CNI, CNTI, and CNDTI, based on the cyano-functionalized approach, which were used to construct four acceptor–acceptor (A–A) polymers P9, P10, P11 and P12 (Fig. 3). These polymers exhibited much deeper LUMOs (−3.63 to −4.11 eV) than their parent PBTI (−3.43 eV). Among them, P11 OTFTs exhibited a maximum μe of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 3). Their deep-lying LUMOs should be advantageous for n-doping. When doped with the n-type dopant N-DMBI, P9, P10, P11, and P12 showed impressive conductivities of 0.19, 0.28, 23.3, and 0.56 S cm−1, respectively. These conductivities are ∼100 times higher that of PBTI. When applied in OTEs, P11 delivered the highest power factor (PF) of 10.0 μW m−1 K−2 (Table 4), resulted from its high μe and doping level.

Benzothiadiazole (BT) is a widely used candidate for constructing organic and polymeric semiconductors. However, these semiconductors have typically exhibited p-type performance owing to their relatively high-lying FMOs. To address this issue, Heeney et al. first prepared novel cyano-substituted 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTDCNBT) by incorporating cyano groups into 5,6 positions of BT. The DTDCNBT-based polymers P13 and P14 displayed n-type transport characteristics with low OTFT μes of 4.9 × 10−4 and 2.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 3). Our group prepared two new cyano-substituted benzochalcogenathiazoles, 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DCNBT) and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole (DCNBSe), without flanking thiophene units, which were used to construct two polymers P15 and P16 (Fig. 4). P15 and P16 OTFTs showed well-balanced ambipolar characteristics with μe/μh values 0.47/0.59 and 0.014/0.018 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

Our group further synthesized polymers P17 and P18 by replacing bithiophene with bifuran (Fig. 4), which had narrow band gaps of 1.36/1.24 eV with low-lying LUMOs/HOMOs of −4.11/−5.65 and −4.32/−5.75 eV, respectively. Both P17 and P18 showed unipolar n-type charge transport characteristics with a promising OTFT μe of 0.31 cm2 V−1 s−1 enabled by P17 (Table 3). We further synthesized a new D–A type polymer P19 by using IDT with a longer conjugation length as an electron-donating co-unit. It exhibited a high absorption coefficient of 6.15 × 104 cm−1, a bandgap of 1.43 eV, and a LUMO of −3.75 eV. When blended with a wide bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T, P19 all-PSC achieved a remarkable PCE of 8.32% with a VOC of 0.90 eV, a JSC of 14.20 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.65, which outperformed the benchmark polymer acceptor N2200 with a PCE of 6.13%. When DCNBT combined with another polymer donor PSTZ, the PCE is improved to 8.77% when processed with nonhalogenated tetrahydrofuran. To enhance the device performance, Peng et al. reported ternary solar cells based on two wide bandgap polymers PBDB-T and PNDT-T as donors and P19 as the acceptor. The ternary blend device of PNDT-T:PBDBT:P19 (0.7:0.3:0.8, wt:wt:wt) showed a highest PCE of 11.87% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 17.53 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.74, after p-doping with F4-TCNQ (Table 1).

Afterwards, we employed DCNBT to copolymerize with two highly electron-donating blocks, 4,4,10,10-tetraoctyl-4,10-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrano[2,3-g]thieno [3,2-c] chromene (TPC) and 5,5,11,11-tetraoctyl-5,11-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:5,6] pyrano[3,4-g] thieno[3,2-c]isochromene (TPIC), affording two D–A polymers P20 and P21, respectively. As a result of the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between DCNBT and co-units, P20 and P21 exhibited ultra-narrow bandgaps of 1.38 and 1.28 eV with low LUMOs/HOMOs of −3.80/−5.54 and −3.87/−5.51 eV, respectively, which are lower than those of P19. When applied in OTFTs, both polymer-based OTFTs exhibited unipolar n-type characteristics with the highest μe of 1.72 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for P20. When mingled with the polymer donor PBDTTT-E-T, P20- and P21-based all-PSCs exhibited a broad photoresponse up to over 900 nm, leading to excellent JSCs of 19.44 and 22.52 mA cm−2 and remarkable PCEs of 9.34% and 10.22%, respectively. This was the first time that an ultra-narrow bandgap polymer acceptor had been employed to achieve a PCE of over 10% in all-PSCs at that time. Building on P20 and P21, we fabricated two ternary all-PSCs, PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:P20 (0.6:0.4:0.8) and PTB7-Th:Si-BDT:P21 (0.6:0.4:0.6) having excellent PCEs of 12.1% and 13.45% with JSCs of 21.9 and 22.32 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 1).
In addition to constructing n-type polymers, cyano-functionalized BT can also be employed to construct n-type organic semiconductors. Lu et al. reported two A–D–A (acceptor–donor–acceptor) type semiconductors S26 and S27 based on IDT as core units and single cyano-substituted BT as end-groups. Both semiconductors exhibited comparable LUMOs (∼−3.5 eV) and wide bandgaps (∼1.90 eV). When blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T, OSCs based on S26 and S27 showed promising PCEs of 6.3% and 7.3%, respectively (Table 1). To further lower the FMOs of S27, Heeney and co-workers synthesized new A–D–A organic semiconductors, S28, with adding additional cyano groups into the BT unit of S27, leading to a LUMO suppression of 0.5 eV in S28 relative to 27 (Fig. 4). The low LUMO results in a stable monoclinic crystal structure upon film formation and enables the resulting OTFT with a μe of up to 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a prolonged device lifetime of over 100 hours in ambient atmosphere. Hwang et al. synthesized two n-type organic semiconductors S29 and S30 with CNBT as the core, two IDT as π-bridges, and two INCN as end-groups (Fig. 4). When S29 and S30 were blended with PBDB-T, the resulting OSCs showed PCEs of 11.22% and 12.33%, respectively.
Inspired by the high device performance of BT semiconductors, some CNBT-based derivatives have been devised and incorporated into polymeric semiconductors. Heeney et al. designed a new building block BT-DTYM annulated with a 2-(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)malonitrile (DTYM) group, and constructed a polymer P22. It showed a low-lying LUMO level (−3.92 eV) and n-type semiconducting behaviour with an OTFT μe of 5.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 when fabricated by blade coating.
The cyano-substituted quinoxaline QxCN, a derivative of CNBT, was reported by Kim et al. They synthesized three polymers P23, P24, and P25 by copolymerizing QxCN with three different donor units T2, TVT, and T3, respectively (Fig. 4). Compared to CNBT polymers, three polymers exhibited higher LUMOs (∼−3.6 eV), but also showed unipolar n-type transport characteristics in OTFTs. Among them, the P23-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 5.32% when blended with PBDB-T, which was attributed to its higher electron mobility and more exciton-dissociation probability.
Recently, Kim et al. further optimized the position (meta and para) of alkoxy side chains on QxCN to yield two novel isomeric polymers P26 and P27. The LUMO of P26 is −3.62 eV, much lower than P27 (−3.43 eV), owing to the improved electron-deficient capability of the meta-positioned side chains. A PCE of 5.07% was obtained for P26-based all-PSCs when mingled with PBDB-T, while only 1.62% PCE was obtained for P27.

2-(3-Oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (INCN) and its derivatives, a new class of cyano functionalized building blocks, have been widely used as end-groups to construct acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) for OSCs in recent years since INCN has strong electron deficiency and a cyano group away from the INCN backbone. Zhan et al. first reported INCN-based FREA S31, which exhibited a strong and broad absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, a high electron mobility, and low-lying FMOs. When blended with PTB7-Th, the PCE of S31-based OSCs reached 6.80% with a Jsc of 14.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V and an FF of 0.59. This pioneering work of Zhan inspires the community to employ INCN for constructing a great number of ITIC derivatives, such as S32, S33, S34, and S35, by modifying core moieties, π-conjugated bridges, side-chains and end-groups. The resulting FREAs have advanced the device performance of OSCs. For example, S34 with thiophene as the π-bridge between indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and the end-group (Fig. 5) exhibited a strong and broad absorption in the visible and even near-infrared regions, matched well with the polymer donor PTB7-Th. OSCs fabricated from PTB7-Th:S34 showed a PCE of 6.31% without any post treatment. By optimizing alkyl chains and end-groups of S34, Hou et al. synthesized an FREA S35 (Fig. 5) with a deeper LUMO (−4.19 eV) and a red-shifted absorption compared to S34. When blended with the donor PBDTTT-EFT, PBDTTT-EFT:S35-based OSCs exhibited an improved PCE of 10.9%.

Fluorine atoms were introduced into the end-groups of S31 to afford S33, as shown in Fig. 5. Fluorine incorporation leads to S33 with a red-shifted absorption in the near-infrared region and a low-lying LUMO (−4.14 eV) compared to non-fluorine S31. The best OSC fabricated from PBDBT-SF:S33 achieved a remarkable PCE of 13%. Furthermore, the OSCs exhibited an excellent tolerance toward an active layer thickness and a good stability with respect to efficiency. From the results of single-crystal packing, the long axis of these FREAs forms a close contact through end-group overlapping with a small distance. Furthermore, the close CN⋯π interactions can be found in some of the closely spaced π–π pairs of end-groups. Both advantages are contributed to the high efficiency intermolecular coupling and large electron transport, thus leading to high-efficiency OSCs.
Additionally, non-fused ring electron acceptors with INCN derivatives as end-groups have been widely studied due to their easy synthesis and low cost. Chen et al. reported two acceptors, S36 and S37, with non-fused (hetero)arenes as core moieties and halogenated INCN as end-groups. Both acceptors show excellent backbone planarity due to forming intramolecular non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and S…O interactions. The S36 and S37 OSCs showed PCEs of 7.04% and 12.76%, respectively, associated with the higher and more balanced μh/μe ratio. The S…N noncovalent interaction is an effective strategy to lock molecular geometry. Using this method, Chen designed two novel near-infrared acceptors S38 and S39 with an absorption extending to 900 nm. Due to the suitable domain size caused by the fluorinated terminal, S38 exhibited an enhanced J-aggregation. When blended with PBDB-T, PBDB-T:S38-based OSCs showed a PCE of 11.50% with a high Jsc of 21.80 mA cm−2 and a low energy loss of 0.53 eV, outperforming that (PCE = 10.17%) of S39 with the thiophene-fused terminal. A similar strategy was reported by the Huang group who synthesized S40 through side-chain engineering. S40 OSCs exhibited a remarkable lab PCE of 14.82% and a certified PCE of 14.5%.
In 2019, Zou et al. first introduced an electron-deficient BT unit into the centre of FREA to afford a novel A–DA′D–A acceptor S41 (Fig. 5). It exhibited a narrow optical bandgap of 1.33 eV, a low-lying LUMO of −4.10 eV, and a strong electron affinity. When blended with the polymer donor PM6, S41 OSCs showed a surprisingly high PCE of 15.7% with a VOC of 0.83 V and a JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2, which is the new record PCE of OSCs at that time. Since then, enormous S41 derivatives, such as S42, S43, S44, have been synthesized and the PCEs of the resulting OSCs have been significantly promoted to over 19% to date. For example, Yang et al. reported a new acceptor S45 consisting of dithienothiophen[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole (BZPT) as cores and INCN as end-groups. It showed a band gap of 1.50 eV and a low-lying LUMO of −3.95 eV. S45 OSCs achieved a high PCE of 13.42%. Min et al. synthesized a new acceptor, S46, by replacing the end-group (INCN) of S41 with 2-chloro-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophene-4-ylidene) dimalononitrile) (CPTCN-Cl). S46 exhibited up-shifted FMOs compared with S41, thus leading to an increased VOC (0.89 V). Introducing a polymer acceptor PZ1 employed as a dual functional solid additive, S46 OSCs achieved a PCE of 15.10% (Table 2). On the basis of symmetrical S41 and S46, Yan et al. first designed and synthesized an asymmetric S47. It achieved a more balanced Voc (0.869 eV) and a Jsc (25.38 mA cm−2) than those of S41 and S46, and thus an improved PCE of 17.06% in the resulting OSCs. Chen group reported symmetric S48 and symmetric S49 (Fig. 5). The FMOs of S49 (LUMO = −3.99 eV, HOMO = −5.56 eV) were slightly decreased relative to those of S48 (LUMO = −3.93 eV, HOMO = −5.52 eV). It was found that a significantly increased JSC (26.02 mA cm−2) of S49 was obtained compared to that of S48 (JSC = 22.32 mA cm−2) in relation to OSCs, due to the red-shifted absorption of S49. As a result, PM6:S49 devices achieved a higher PCE of 17.61%, whereas a relatively low PCE of 14.89% was achieved by PM6:S48.

Side-chain engineering plays a vital effect on the molecular arrangement of acceptors, thus dominating device performance. Hou et al. reported a new acceptor S50 with 2-butyloctyl groups as side chains, which achieved a high PCE of 17% when blended with PBDB-TF. Furthermore, a large-area of 1 cm2 of OPV cells yielded a high PCE of 15.5%. This group optimized the side-chains of S50 and synthesized two new acceptors, S51 and S52 (Fig. 5) with n-heptyl and n-nonyl side-chains, respectively. Both acceptors showed good solubility and tight intermolecular ordering. Thus, a PCE of 17.8% (certified as 17.3%) was obtained for PBDB-TF:S52-based OSCs (Table 2). However, S51 with shorter alkyl chains only achieved a PCE of 14.9% due to its low solubility and excessive aggregation in the blend.

Attaching two dicyanomethylenes to a π-conjugated structure is an effective approach to produce a quinoidal organic semiconductor with a low-lying LUMO, thus leading to n-type transport characteristics. Miller et al. reported a quinodimethane-substituted terthiophene oligomer S53 (Fig. 6). The quinoidal character results in S53 with reduced FMOs relative to unsubstituted terthiophene. The μes of S53-based OTFTs achieved in vapor and solution depositions were 0.005 and 0.002 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After carefully optimizing the morphology of S53, the μe value was improved to 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Takimiya et al. reported a new dicyanomethylene-substituted terheteroquinoid derivative S54 (Fig. 6). S54 OTFTs exhibited a μe of up to 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 by thermal annealing to induce the high-quality crystalline films. By extending the core conjugation length, Higuchi et al. reported a dihexylbithienoquinonoid derivative S55 (Fig. 6). However, S55 exhibited an ambipolar character with a low μe/μh of 0.005 and a μh of up to 6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

To further lower LUMOs, introducing the electron-deficient unit as the core is a feasible strategy. Zhu et al. first developed diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based organic semiconductors S56 and S57 with different side-chain lengths (Fig. 6). Thanks to their good backbone coplanarity and quinoidal characters, S56 and S57 showed low-lying LUMOs of ∼−4.50 eV. Under ambient conditions, the μe value of S56-based OTFTs was determined to be 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff of 106, while S57 OTFTs exhibited a low μe of 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff of 105–106 (Table 3). Moreover, the devices based on S57 presented good air stability over a two-week period and operating stability during cycle tests, highlighting the advantage of DPP-based quinoidal semiconductors. By manipulating the length and branched position of the alkyl side-chains of S56, they reported a series of quinoidal semiconductors, S58, S59, S60, and S61, all of which show excellent air-stable n-channel transporting behaviours with the highest μe of 0.72 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison to S56. Furthermore, two new quinoidal materials S62 and S63 with different side-chains were further prepared by extending the fused rings based on the S56 backbone (Fig. 6). Both semiconductors show lower-lying LUMOs (∼−4.60 eV) than those of S56 and S57. Optimized S62 and S63 OTFTs exhibited μes of 0.22 and 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a comparable Ion/Ioff of 106 (Table 3). Based on S62, Zhu et al. synthesized an isomer S64, which showed high and stable n-type OTFT performance with an μe of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff of 106 after thermal annealing. Afterwards, they synthesized a series of quinoidal terthiophenes S65–S68 by incorporating thieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as the core together with varying sulfur orientations in thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and side-chains. Branched alkyl chains had a significant influence on film morphology and induced a more optimal molecular orientation compared to linear chains. Combining the effect of the side-chain length and sulfur orientation, S65 exhibited a favourable 2D brickwork type face-to-face packing. As a result, it delivered a very high μe of 5.2 cm2 V −1 s −1. Subsequently, they reported two new quinoidal small molecules S69 and S70 based on bisthieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as the core and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and seleno[3,4-b]thiophene as bridges, respectively. Both S69 and S70 show extremely low LUMOs of −4.74 and −4.73 eV, respectively. S69 showed an electrical conductivity of 8 × 10−3 S cm−1 in the pristine film and thus achieved a PF of 0.34 μW m−1 K−2 under ambient conditions in the OTE (Table 4). It is noteworthy that the incorporation of selenophene into the oligothiophene imide-based quinoidal organic diradical S70 led to a significant enhancement in both its electrical conductivity (0.29 S cm−1) and power factor (1.40 μW m−1 K−2), which are significantly higher than those of S69.

Using more rigid frameworks in fused quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives can result in decreased reorganization energies and increased aromaticity, which would enhance the stability of diradical species. To take advantage of these characteristics, we devised oligothiophene imide-based quinoidal organic diradicals S71 and S72 (Fig. 6). Both semiconductors featured imide-bridged fused π-conjugated frameworks and exhibited deeply aligned LUMOs of −4.58 and −4.69 eV for S71 and S72, respectively. However, S71 displayed a relatively poor conductivity of ∼10−6 S cm−1, while S72, based on a tetrathiophene imide, exhibited cross-conjugation assisted self-doping in the film state, yielding a high electrical conductivity of 0.34 S cm−1. Surprisingly, this conductivity maintained at a high level of over 0.1 S cm−1 under ambient conditions for over 260 hours, likely due to the attachment of the strong electron-withdrawing imide group onto the tetracyano quinoidal framework. When applied in OTEs, a promising power factor of 1.52 μW m−1 K−2 was obtained for S72 (Table 4). Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of fused quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives as stable and efficient organic semiconductors.

In this review, we summarize the recent progress in n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors based on cyano functionalization. It is evident that the incorporation of cyano groups leads to semiconductors with greatly suppressed FMOs, thus yielding n-type transport behaviour. The introduction of cyano groups into various structures can produce a series of new electron-deficient building blocks, including cyano-functionalized indenofluorene, cyano-functionalized imide-based (hetero)arenes, cyano-functionalized benzothiadiazole, cyano-functionalized 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile, and (hetero)arenes end-capped with dicyanomethylene. These novel building blocks enable the construction of a large number of n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors, which have significantly improved the performance of various devices, including OTFTs, OSCs, and OTEs.

For further advances, it is urgent to develop highly electron-deficient novel building blocks maintaining good solubility and small steric hindrance. This would enable the resulting n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors to have lower-lying FMOs, narrower optical bandgaps, and outstanding backbone planarity. Integrating the design strategy is an available approach to realize these goals, thus facilitating the construction of high-performance n-type semiconductors. For example, one is the integration of cyano groups with other electron-withdrawing groups or other design approaches, such as ring fusion and replacement, in one building block. But taking account of minimize the steric hindrance should be noted when combining the design strategy. If not carefully designed, it will bring unfavorable effects, such as the distorted backbone and bad molecular stacking in the resulting semiconductors because the cyano group often imposes a higher steric hindrance than typical H and F atoms. After designing, the appropriate synthesis approach is also crucial for the development of n-type semiconductors. When overcoming these bottlenecks, it can be expected that the newly developed n-type organic and polymeric semiconductors will achieve much improved performance when combined with the backbone design and side-chain engineering.
