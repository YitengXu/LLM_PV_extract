A series of new pyridomethene–BF2/phenothiazine hybrid metal-free organic sensitizers K1–K8 containing different π-spacers were synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). The introduction of the pyridomethene–BF2 complex unit to the phenothiazine chromophore resulted in a high molar extinction coefficient in favor of light harvesting. Quantum chemical calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to investigate the structural properties and electron density distributions of these dyes. The effect of dyes K1–K8 on the performance of DSSC was investigated systematically with comparisons to the plain phenothiazine dyes R1 and R2. Upon co-adsorption with deoxycholic acid, the dye K3, with a thiophene unit between the phenothiazine and pyridomethene–BF2 units, exhibited the best photovoltaic performance. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) was 15.43 mA cm−2 with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62, which correspond to a power-conversion efficiency (η) of 6.58% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The n-hexyl chain attached to the thiophene in K4–K5 improved the Voc value. The presence of the phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 moiety at the N(10) atom of phenothiazine in K6–K8 reduced π–π aggregation. These results reveal the advantage of incorporating a pyridomethene–BF2 group in the dyes for high-performance DSSC cells.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been intensively studied as promising photovoltaic devices since their discovery by O'Regan and Grätzel et al. in 1991. This type of solar cell has the advantage of low fabrication cost compared to the classical silicon-based solar cells. The dye sensitizer plays a crucial factor in the performance of DSSC, both in power conversion efficiency (η) as well as device stability. In the development of DSSC, metal complexes such as N3,N719, black dye and YD2-o-C8 have exhibited impressive solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% under illumination with standard global air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5G). In contrast to metal complexes, organic dyes have been extensively explored in recent years due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, high molar absorption coefficient, tunable spectra, and other properties. Various kinds of organic dyes based on coumarin, phenothiazine, cyanine, indoline, and triphenylamine derivatives have been shown to work effectively for DSSC.

Although remarkable progress has been made, further optimization of the chemical structures of organic dyes is still needed. One of the main shortcomings of metal complex dyes is their weak absorption in the red region of the visible spectrum. The molar extinction coefficient of sensitizers in the visible region is an important factor that affects DSSC efficiency. A high absorption coefficient in the visible wavelength will increase the value of short-circuit current density (Jsc). Among various strategies for increasing the molar extinction coefficient, one common tactic is to make the π-chromophore more rigid in order to suppress the rotational disorder of molecules and to enhance the delocalization capacity of π-electrons. However, rod-like molecules may magnify aggregate formation between molecules and facilitate the recombination of electrons with triiodide electrolyte. The incorporation of an additional electron donor unit on the sensitizer to form the starburst 2D-π-A configuration is another approach to enhancing the molar extinction coefficient. In either of these two strategies, the complicated synthetic pathways usually become the limiting factor in practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to design relatively small and simple organic compounds to minimize the difficulty of synthesis.
Organoboron complexes are highly attractive dyes with high photochemical stability. They exhibit high molar absorptivity and electron-accepting property. Among various organoboron complexes, boron dipyrromethene derivatives (BODIPY) have been widely employed as biomolecule-labelling dyes, chemosensors, and in photodynamic therapy. By virtue of their high absorptivity in the visible and near-IR regions, BODIPY dyes have been used previously in both liquid electrolyte and solid-state DSSC. However, the overall conversion efficiencies were not quite satisfactory. In our earlier report, we designed a different pyridomethene–BF2 complex, with a similar structure to BODIPY, that exhibited a very large extinction coefficient (ε > 5 × 104 M−1 cm−1). With this experience, we envisioned that the introduction of the pyridomethene–BF2 complex unit into the framework of a sensitizer will be beneficial to light harvesting. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the use of pyridomethene–BF2 complexes as a sensitizer dye on DSSC.
Unlike BODIPY, phenothiazine-based sensitizers have been successfully utilized in DSSC and exhibited high conversion efficiency. The structure of phenothiazine contains an electron-rich heterocycle made with sulfur and nitrogen. Its geometry is not planar in the group state, but tilts slightly, like a butterfly. Therefore, it is not a fully π-conjugate system in a classical sense across the three rings of phenothiazine, which leads to a small oscillator strength (f) and a weak intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) efficiency. It is expected that grafting a pyridomethene–BF2 unit on a phenothiazine backbone may increase the molar absorptivity as a whole.
We designed and synthesized a series of dyes, K1–K8, by incorporating phenothiazine and pyridomethene–BF2 into one chromophore (Fig. 1). In the structure of compound K1, a pyridomethene–BF2 complex unit is linked to the C(7) position of phenothiazine, and a cyanoacrylic acid moiety to the C(3) position. An alkyl side chain is attached to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom in order to increase the solubility and to reduce the dark current by covering the surface of TiO2 from exposure to the electrolyte. In compounds K2 and K3, a thiophenylene group was introduced to the main chain of the dyes to broaden the absorption wavelength range. In compounds K4 and K5, an additional n-hexyl chain was attached to the thiophene unit to further improve the surface morphology. In compounds K6 and K7, a second pyridomethene–BF2 moiety was attached to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom, not only to enhance the molar extinction coefficient (ε > 1 × 105 M−1 cm−1) but also to function as insulator to suppress intermolecular π–π stacking. To clarify the influence of the second pyridomethene–BF2 unit on K6 and K7, compound K8 was prepared to serve as a reference material. Three other reference compounds, R1, R2 and P3 (Fig. 2), were also prepared to clarify the functions of both phenothiazine and pyridomethene–BF2 moieties in K1–K8. In compound R1, a triphenylamine group replaces the pyridomethene–BF2 unit in K1 as an electron-donating group. Compounds R2 and P3 provided the simplest models for expressing the properties of phenothiazine and pyridomethene–BF2, respectively. It is known that organoboron complexes possess high photochemical stability; therefore, the stability of all the pyridomethene–BF2 containing dyes is also examined. Detailed analyses of structural and electronic properties were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level for all molecules. The synthetic details for the preparations of dyes K1–K8, R1 and P3 are described in the ESI.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of K and R series dyes in THF solution are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption peaks and their molar extinction coefficients are listed in Table 1. All dyes displayed two major absorption maxima: a short-wavelength one at around 300–350 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition, and a long-wavelength one at about 440–480 nm. The featureless long absorption bands of R1 and R2 are assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. In contrast, the long-wavelength absorption bands of all K dyes show a shoulder on the blue edge. This absorption feature is apparently different from that of R dyes. In addition, the longer wavelength absorption bands of K dyes blue-shifted with increasing solvent polarity (e.g., K1 from 466 nm in THF to 460 nm in MeCN, Fig. S1). When compared to the reference dye R1 with a triphenylamine group, replacement with a pyridomethene–BF2 unit in K1 red-shifts the long absorption peak from 450 nm (R1) to 466 nm (K1) (Table 1) and increases the molar extinction coefficient from 1.64 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (R1) to 4.63 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (K1). The absorption band of K2 is nearly the same as that of K1 except that the absorption band is wider and the molar extinction coefficient is higher (5.74 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for K2) due to the presence of a thiophene unit. The spectrum of K3 shows a distinct red shift of 15 nm with respect to that of K1, which is caused by an increase in the π conjugation length. The molar extinction coefficient of K3 was further enhanced to 8.61 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which ensures a good light-harvesting ability in DSSC. The long-wavelength absorption bands of K4 and K5 are blue-shifted by 16 and 6 nm with respect to K3. The presence of a hexyl substituent on the thiophene disturbs the planar geometry, therefore reducing the degree of π conjugation. The geometry change was evidenced by molecular modelling analysis according to the density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional in combination with the standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The optimized geometry of K3 revealed that the two dihedral angles between the thiophene unit and its adjacent groups are 24.33° and 25.55° (Fig. 4). The corresponding dihedral angles in K4 and K5, however, increased to 40.89° and 43.28°. As a result, the spectrum of K3 displayed not only a red shift compared to those of K4 and K5, but also a higher molar extinction coefficient. In the spectra of K6 and K7, very large molar extinction coefficients of 1.39 × 105 and 1.21 × 105 M−1 cm−1 were observed at 460 nm as a result of the two pyridomethene–BF2 units in the molecules. The absorption spectra of K6 and K7 also displayed a blue shift in comparison to those of K5 and K4, mainly caused by the large torsional angle (e.g., 85°) between the phenyl and phenothiazine moieties (Fig. 4). When compared with K6 and K7, the dye K8 displayed a further blue shift. The long-wavelength absorption bands of K6–K8 are assigned to an ICT transition mixed with π–π* character. This assignment is supported by the result of theoretical calculations and is also evidenced by comparing the spectra of K6–K8 with that of P3. It can be concluded that the incorporation of pyridomethene–BF2 segments in all K dyes not only red-shifts the absorption edge but also increases the molar extinction coefficient. As the maximal radiation energy of sunlight appears at the 475 nm wavelength, it is anticipated that dyes K1–K8 should possess an excellent light-harvesting ability in DSSC.

In order to understand the origins of the long-wavelength absorption bands for dyes K1–K8, the absorption spectrum of reference P3 was measured for comparison. The long wavelength absorption bands of K1–K8 were similar to the features reported for the pyridomethene–BF2 complex. The long absorption band of P3 (λmax = 455 nm) overlaps well with those of K1–K8, and it also exhibits a high molar extinction coefficient (3.45 × 104 M−1 cm−1) (Fig. 3b). In particular for K6–K8, the π system of phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 chromophore is nearly perpendicular to that of phenothiazine. The spectral features of K6–K8 are very close to that of P3 as a result of their high structural similarity.
The absorption spectra of dyes K1–K8 and R1–R2 on the surface of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 1. When dyes R1–R2 are adsorbed onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 particles (2 μm), the ICT absorption bands are blue-shifted by 17 and 44 nm, from 450 and 437 nm in THF solution to 433 and 394 nm, respectively. The ICT absorption maxima for dyes K1–K8 on TiO2 particles are close to those in THF solution. In general, when sensitizers are adsorbed onto TiO2 surface, a spectral shift may be induced by deprotonation and aggregation. The blue shift for dyes R1 and R2 is likely a result of deprotonation that weakens the electron-withdrawing ability of the carboxylate. The effect of deprotonation was examined by the addition of triethylamine (TEA), which neutralizes the carboxylic acid in THF solution. The absorption spectra of the K and R dyes in the presence and absence of TEA are shown in Fig. 6 and S2. With an excessive amount of TEA, the ICT band of R exhibited an apparent blue shift, similar to that on the TiO2 surface. However, the ICT band of K dyes did not change much in the presence of TEA. The existence of pyridomethene–BF2 moieties in K dyes minimizes the influence of the carboxylate.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the redox potentials of the dyes. All dyes K1–K8 displayed two quasi-reversible oxidative waves (Fig. 7 and S3). The redox parameters are displayed in Table 1, and the HOMO–LUMO gaps are plotted in Fig. 8. The first oxidation potentials of dyes K1–K8 are close to that of R2, a response to the removal of an electron from the phenothiazine moiety. A slightly lower oxidation potential of K2 was observed due to the presence of an additional thiophene group adjacent to the cyanoacrylic acid. For R1, the second oxidation potential originates from the triarylamine moiety owing to its weaker electron-releasing ability than phenothiazine. The second oxidation of dyes K1–K8 occurred upon the removal of an electron from the pyridomethene–BF2 complex, and it is consistent with the oxidation potential of P3. The HOMO levels of all dyes were more positive than the reducing potential of the iodine/iodide pair (0.4 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), ensuring sufficient driving force for the oxidized dyes to recapture an electron from the electrolyte. The LUMO levels of the dyes were deduced from the first oxidation potential and the 0–0 transition energy (E0–0) estimated at the intersection of normalized absorption and fluorescence spectra. The LUMO levels of all the dyes were higher than the TiO2 conductive band (−0.5 V), thus warranting the feasibility of electron injection.


The effect of pyridomethene–BF2 on photovoltaic performance of dyes K1–K8 and R1–R2 was further analysed by using DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations (TDDFT). The electron distributions of frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 9 and S4–S5. A comparison with the results using Hartree–Fock (HF) and time-dependent HF with 6-31G(d,p) basis set is also included in Fig. S6. The optimized geometry of phenothiazine shows a tilted butterfly conformation (Fig. 4). The electron density of the HOMO orbital is delocalized across both the phenothiazine and the pyridomethene–BF2 moieties for dyes K1–K7. However, due to the large dihedral distortion of the phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 substituent at the N(10) position of K6–K8, orbital overlap between the substituent and the main chromophore is prohibited. In addition, a nearly orthogonal conformation between the phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 unit and phenothiazine is expected to widen the intermolecular distance on the surface of TiO2, which is beneficial to the surface morphology. The electron distribution in the LUMO of all dyes is localized on the cyanoacrylic acid group. Electronic transitions with oscillator strength (f) larger than 0.1 are summarized in Table S1 (cf. Tables S2 for B3PW91/6-31G(d,p) and S3 for HF/6-31G(d,p)). The lowest-energy absorption bands (S1 transition) for dyes K1–K8 (f = 0.31–0.70) correspond to the HOMO → LUMO transition. The values are larger than that of the reference dyes R1 (f = 0.27) and R2 (f = 0.26). The calculated results indicate that the long wavelength absorptions above 450 nm, mainly deriving from HOMO → LUMO transitions, are the ICT bands. It is found that dye K3 displays the largest f values (0.70) of S1 transition due to its undisturbed π conjugation. A relatively lower f value (0.31) of ICT transition for dye K8 can be ascribed to the interruption of electronic coupling between the phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 moiety and the phenothiazine unit. The f values of dyes K6 and K7 are modest, yet their molar absorptivity was quite large in the spectra (Fig. 3b and Table 1). This result can be attributed to the presence of two pyridomethene–BF2 units in the molecules. For example, a much higher intensity (f = 0.72) of HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition (i.e., π–π* transition of phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 complex side chain) of K6 is anticipated. The computed results comply well with the observed spectra of the dyes. The stimulated gas-phase absorption spectra of K and R dyes are shown in Fig. S7–S9.


DSSC based on the K and R dyes were fabricated by coating them on the surface of TiO2 as sensitizers. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) and J–V curves of all dyes are displayed under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in Fig. 10 and 11, along with that of R dyes for comparison (10 μm transparent + 5 μm scattering). Experiments using co-absorption with deoxycholic acid (DCA) were also carried out. The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) are summarized in Table 2, where N719 was used as a reference dye.

The IPCE values of most dyes are approximately 60% in the range of 400–550 nm, whereas that of K3 exceeds 70% in the range of 480–560 nm. The IPCE spectrum for DSSC based on K4 is the broadest among all K dyes. The overall quantum cell efficiency fell in the range of 3.82–5.15%. Among them, the device made with K8 exhibits the highest efficiency of 5.15% (Jsc = 12.64 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.65 V, FF = 0.63). In dye K8, a phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 moiety was introduced on the phenothiazine nitrogen atom, unlike all the other dyes that were substituted at the 7th position. We speculated that the cell performance of all the K dyes was depressed to various degrees by the existence of π–π stacking among pyridomethene–BF2 moieties. It has been observed in previous studies that pyridomethene–BF2 complex derivatives readily tend to form J-aggregations, which lead to the quenching of charge-separated species and the reduction of electron injection efficiency. A typical example is shown by comparing the loading amounts of K1 (4.08 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and R2 (3.75 × 10−7 mol cm−2). Although the molecular size of K1 is larger than that of R2 by the presence of an extra pyridomethene–BF2 group, the loading amount of the former was still higher than the latter.
A comparison between the two isomeric pairs, K4/K5 and K6/K7, is noteworthy. According to the IPCE spectra, dyes K4 and K7 performed better than their corresponding isomers K5 and K6. The introduction of a hexyl chain on the thiophene unit helps the dyes to form a better surface morphology. Nevertheless, the position of the hexyl substituent on the thiophene unit exhibits a crucial influence on the photovoltaic performance. If the hexyl chain on the thiophene is attached away from the phenothiazine, like those in K4 and K7, a better planarity (ca. 25°) is maintained between the two adjacent aromatic rings (Fig. 4). This leads to better delocalization across the main chromophore from thiophene to the cyanoacrylate acceptor. On the contrary, when the hexyl chain is attached next to the phenothiazine, like those in K5 and K6, a substantially larger dihedral angle (ca. 43°) appears between the thiophene and the phenothiazine. The conjugation of the main chromophore is interrupted and results in a slow charge injection and small Jsc values. Although dye K6, which contains two units of the pyridomethene–BF2 complex, exhibits the largest molar extinction coefficient, the device made with it displays the lowest Jsc value.
The charge injection efficiency is directly related to the IPCE value. The low IPCE for K5 and K6 can be further exemplified by an analysis of DFT and TDDFT calculations (Fig. 9 and Table S1). Upon photo-excitation, most electronic transitions in K5 and K6 proceed from HOMO or HOMO−1 to the LUMO+1 orbitals (i.e., localized on the pyridomethene–BF2 group) instead of to the LUMO orbital (localized on the cyanoacrylate moiety). This situation is opposite to the excitation processes in K4 and K7. For instance, the HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 transition of K6 expresses a large oscillator strength (f = 0.72) compared to the relatively smaller value (f = 0.49) of its HOMO to LUMO transition. Because the pyridomethene–BF2 moiety is located on the opposite side of the TiO2 surface, such a transition does not parallel the formal direction of electron flow.
In order to further understand the behavior of the K and R dyes on the TiO2 surface, the function of co-absorbent was investigated. DCA has been proven to suppress dye aggregation and effectively improve solar cell performance. Photovoltaic data based on K and R dyes with 10 mM DCA at the given 10 μm thick TiO2 film are summarized in Table 2. For all dyes, the Voc values of DSSC in the presence of DCA increased because of effective suppression of the dark current. As expected, dyes K1–K5 are effective in increasing the photovoltaic parameters with DCA from 3.95–4.82% to 4.81–6.58%. The remarkable enhancement of power conversion efficiency is ascribed mostly to the break-up of dye aggregation. The enhancement of Jsc values is shown in the IPCE spectra (Fig. 12). K1 and K3–K5 show reduced dye loading amounts when DCA was added (Table 2). This result further confirms that a significant π–π interaction exists on the TiO2 films of K1 and K3–K5 in the absence of DCA. A comparison between the isomer pair K2 and K3 reveals the significance of structural difference. Before adding DCA, the quantum efficiency of K3 (η = 4.78%) is close to that of K2 (η = 4.69%). After adding DCA, the quantum efficiency of K3 (η = 6.58%) increased substantially, while that of K2 (η = 4.81%) stayed nearly the same. The two structures differ at the thiophenylene group position. In K2, the thiophenylene group is located close to the cyanoacrylate anchoring site; therefore, the structure is bent to an angular shape near the TiO2 surface. It is more difficult to readjust its surface alignment with the insertion of DCA. A similar effect was observed on dyes K6–K8 when each of them was co-adsorbed with 10 mM DCA. In the structure of dyes K6–K8 there is a phenyl pyridomethene–BF2 substituent at the N(10) position of phenothiazine, which causes the molecular shape to be more irregular than those of K1, K4 and K5. Upon the addition of DCA, the alignment of the dyes was not much influenced by DCA. The cell performance of K6–K8 reduced slightly as a result of reduced loading amounts. The improvement of cell performance was most pronounced in the case of K3, wherein the best efficiency of 6.58% was obtained, with a Jsc of 15.43 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.69 V, and an FF of 0.62. When compared with reference R, the overall conversion efficiency of dye K1 (η = 6.02%) is higher than those of dyes R1 (η = 5.18%) and R2 (η = 4.97%) by an amount of ca. 16 and 21%, respectively; these results reveal an advantage of incorporating the pyridomethene–BF2 complex unit on K dye skeletons to enhance cell performance (Fig. 13).
Further investigation on the effect on dye aggregation was performed by changing the dye film thickness. A thinner film of dye K1 (5 μm transparent + 5 μm scattering) was prepared, and the cell made with it was compared with that made with a thicker film (10 μm transparent + 5 μm scattering). The photovoltaic parameters of IPCE and J–V curve are shown in Table S4 and Fig. S10. The DSSC cell made with the thinner K1 film yielded a better performance of 5.15% (Jsc = 12.36 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 0.61) than that made with a thicker film (η = 4.25%). The dye loading amount for K1 on 5 μm film is 2.28 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which is about half of that on 10 μm film. After it was co-adsorbed with DCA (2 mM), the surface coverage for K1 slightly decreased (1.97 × 10−7 mol cm−2); however, the power conversion efficiency of DSSC increased to 5.66% (Jsc = 13.37 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 0.62). These results again confirm that breaking up aggregation in the dyes containing pyridomethene–BF2 moieties (e.g., K1 and K3–K5) is an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance.
To get a deeper understanding on the interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSC, electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) analysis was performed on the devices using K and R dyes co-adsorbed with DCA. The Nyquist and Bode plots of the DSSC are measured under a forward bias in the dark, and the results are shown in Fig. S11. In the Nyquist plots, the larger semicircles at lower frequencies indicate charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radius of the larger semicircle decreased in the order of K4 > K5 > K3–K1 > K7 > K8 > R1–R2 > K2–K6, indicating that the charge recombination resistance is roughly consistent with the values of Voc. The additional long alkyl chain in K4 and K5 improves the dye layer morphology on TiO2 and inhibits charge recombination. In Bode plots, the peaks at lower frequencies correspond to a higher charge recombination rate and are inversely proportional to the electron lifetime. The peak maxima at the lower-frequency range decreased in the order of K4 > K5 > K3–K1 > K7 > K8 > R1–R2 > K2–K6. The longer electron lifetime of K4 and K5 implies that the introduction of two long alkyl chains can effectively inhibit the charge recombination rate across the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.

The stability of dyes is an important factor for sustained operation in practical applications of DSSC. Dyes adsorbed on 10 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 films were continuously irradiated by AM 1.5 light without redox mediators according to Katoh's method. After 30 min, the absorbance of reference dyes R1 and R2 decreased to some extent; the spectra of K dyes stayed nearly invariant both in absorption intensity and band shape (Fig. 14 and S12). This indicates the high photostability of the dyes and assures their good practical value.


In summary, a series of metal-free organic dipole dyes containing phenothiazine and pyridomethene–BF2 moieties were synthesized, and their usage on DSSC was investigated. Taking advantage of the high molar absorptivity of the pyridomethene–BF2 group, these dyes displayed remarkable light harvesting efficiency. With the assistance of DCA co-absorption, the best solar cell performance of dye K3 reaches a high quantum efficiency of 6.58%, with Jsc = 15.43 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.69 V, and FF = 0.62.

A few unique structural features that influence the cell performance are noteworthy. The relative position of a thiophenylene group in K2 and K3 makes a significant difference on their quantum efficiency. In the absence of DCA, the two isomers performed comparably (4.69% and 4.78%, respectively). In the presence of DCA, however, the quantum efficiency of K3 increased to almost 40% (up to 6.58%), while that of K2 stayed the same (4.81%). The position of the thiophenylene group in K2 caused the molecules to bend in a larger angle near the surface of TiO2, therefore becoming less sensitive to the influence of DCA.
The long hexyl substituents in K1–K7 have the effects of covering the surface of TiO2 and improving the film morphology. The relative position of the second hexyl group on the thiophene moieties of the isomeric pairs K4/K5 and K6/K7 induced an apparent difference in cell performance. In cases where the hexyl group is located close to the phenothiazine, like that in K5 and K6, the Jsc values (10.44 and 9.84 mA cm−2) were smaller than those in K4 and K7 (12.60 and 12.72 mA cm−2). This reduction is caused by the twisting of dihedral angles between adjacent aryl groups due to the steric hindrance of the hexyl group.
The addition of a second pyridomethene–BF2 group in K6 and K7 increased the absorption intensity substantially, so that more photons can be harvested by these dyes. Both the Jsc (12.72 mA cm−2) and η (5.10%) values of K7 are among the highest before the addition of DCA. However, the presence of two pyridomethene–BF2 groups increased the size of the dye molecules and reduced their sensitivity toward DCA. Upon adding DCA, the dyes with long, rod-shaped geometry, like those of K1 and K3–K5, were benefited to a higher degree than K6 and K7.
With respect to the reference R dyes, incorporation of the pyridomethene–BF2 unit can indeed increase the molar extinction coefficient, which is in favour of light harvesting. The effect of pyridomethene–BF2 group on the absorption spectra and charge transition characteristics was analyzed with the aid of DFT and time-dependent DFT theoretical models. Furthermore, the introduction of the pyridomethene–BF2 complex unit in K dyes confers excellent photostability as compared with R dyes.

Computations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program package. The geometry was optimized by using B3LYP (Becke three-parameter hybrid functional with Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functionals) with the Pople 6-31G(d,p) atomic basis set.


The TiO2 films used were comprised of a transparent layer with thickness of 5 or 10 μm and a scattering layer with thickness of 5 μm, as measured by a profilometer (Dektak3, Veeco/Sloan Instruments, Inc., USA). The TiO2 electrodes, with a 0.25 cm2 geometric area, were immersed in THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M organic sensitizers or in acetonitrile/tert-butanol solution (1:1 by vol) containing 3 × 10−4 M N719 [cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium)] for 12 h, then rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile, and dried. The best performance of DSSC with deoxycholic acid (DCA) as the co-adsorbent was found with the concentration of DCA at 10 mM. Another piece of FTO sputtered with 100 nm thick Pt was used as a counter electrode. The active area was controlled at a dimension of 0.25 cm2 by adhering 60 μm thick polyester tape on the Pt electrode. The photocathode was placed on top of the counter electrode and tightly clipped together to form a cell. Electrolyte was then injected into the seam between the two electrodes. An acetonitrile solution containing LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte. Devices made using the commercial dye N719 under the same condition were compared as a reference.
